1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,127
(Minionese)

2
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,003
(Minionese)

3
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,371
Minions.

4
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,925
Minions have been on this
planet far longer than we have.

5
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,889
They go by many names.
Dave, Carl, Paul, Mike.

6
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,883
Oh, that one is Norbert.

7
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,285
He's an idiot.

8
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,489
They're all different, but
they all share the same goal.

9
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,723
To serve the most despicable
master they could find.

10
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,801
Boss!

11
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,722
Making their master happy was the
tribe's very reason for existence.

12
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,925
But that's not to say that
they didn't have other passions.

13
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,007
(Minionese)

14
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,241
Huh?

15
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,405
Finding a boss was easy.

16
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,924
But keeping a boss,
there in lies the rub.

17
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,010
(Minionese)

18
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,250
Nope, it wasn't easy for these guys.

19
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,970
But they never gave up.

20
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,569
With the emergence
of the Stone Age

21
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,883
came the rise of a new species.

22
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,691
Man was very different
from the dinosaur.

23
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,330
He was shorter, hairier,

24
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,051
and way, way smarter.

25
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,326
The Minions took
an instant liking to man,

26
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,289
and helped him the best they could.

27
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,730
Oh, no, no.

28
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,325
(Minionese)

29
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,484
Eh?
(Minionese)

30
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,727
Poor man.
So trusting, so fragile.

31
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,322
So, so delicious!

32
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,249
Their quest for a boss put
the Minions front and center

33
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,682
for some of civilization's
most historic moments.

34
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,569
(Faux Egyptian)

35
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,847
Anubis!

36
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,123
Ancient Egypt held great promise.

37
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,201
(Minionese)

38
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,563
Okay! Pancake!

39
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,564
But it didn't last long.

40
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,131
Hmm. Oh!

41
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,210
(Minionese)

42
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,281
Ow!

43
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,644
The Dark Ages were
actually fun times.

44
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,329
Their new master had a tendency

45
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,324
to party all night
and sleep all day.

46
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,085
Ooh!

47
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,571
(Faux Romanian)

48
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,841
(Minionese)

49
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,929
(Minionese)

50
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,361
Oh.

51
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,681
But eventually, the party was over.

52
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,129
They bounced from
one evil boss to another,

53
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,567
but they never seemed
to find their perfect fit.

54
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,960
One particular employer took
their failure very, very badly.

55
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,085
Huh?

56
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,569
The Minions had no other
choice but to keep moving.

57
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,163
Oh.
(Minionese)

58
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,720
And then, when all hope
seemed lost,

59
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,608
they found sanctuary.

60
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,602
The Minions were safe!

61
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,400
(Minionese)

62
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,725
(Minionese)

63
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,689
Years passed as the Minions
forged their own civilization.

64
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,604
They truly made a life for themselves.

65
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,081
But something just wasn't right.

66
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,087
(Minionese)

67
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,084
They felt empty inside.

68
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,401
Without a master, they had no purpose.

69
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,245
They became aimless and depressed.

70
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,722
(Minionese)

71
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,049
If this continued any longer,
the Minions would perish.

72
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,922
But all was not lost
for one Minion had a plan.

73
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,040
His name was Kevin.

74
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,126
He was excited to share
his idea with the tribe.

75
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,046
He'd been preparing for days,
weeks, months.

76
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,729
But now he was ready.

77
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,847
(Minionese)

78
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,441
(Mumbles)

79
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,529
(Minionese)

80
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,370
Buddies!

81
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,211
(Minionese)

82
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,883
Kevin would leave the cave...

83
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,644
Go back to the outside world,

84
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,087
and he would not return
until he had found his tribe

85
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,527
the biggest,
baddest villain to serve.

86
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,601
(Minionese)

87
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,325
But he needed help.

88
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,526
Me!

89
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,840
(Minionese)

90
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,644
Bob was eager to go,

91
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,007
But Kevin felt he was
just not strong enough

92
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,003
for the dangerous journey ahead.

93
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,082
Uh, no.
(Minionese)

94
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,329
Luckily, someone stepped up.

95
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,367
Stuart!

96
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,487
(Minionese)

97
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,762
Huh? Me, me?
Oh! Thank you.

98
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,844
Truth be told, Stuart had no
idea what he was chosen for...

99
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,602
But was thrilled it made
people cheer for him.

100
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,284
Thank you.
(Minionese)

101
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,011
(Minionese)

102
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,167
(Minionese)

103
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,771
Me!

104
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,122
(Minionese)

105
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,684
Eh, okay.

106
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,127
(Minionese)

107
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,046
Eventually, Bob's energy and enthusiasm,

108
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,841
but mostly lack of other volunteers,
changed Kevin's mind.

109
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,725
(Minionese)

110
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,642
The tribe said their farewells.

111
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,167
Kevin had given them something
they hadn't had in a very long time.

112
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,520
Hope.

113
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,724
Bob!

114
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,848
Hey, Tony!
(Minionese)

115
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,604
Tom...
(Minionese)

116
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,564
Chris...

117
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,005
Hey, Bob.
(Minionese)

118
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,208
Oh.
(Minionese)

119
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,210
Bye bye.

120
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,284
(Minionese)

121
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,247
Kevin felt pride.

122
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,926
He was going to be
the one to save his tribe.

123
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,924
Stuart felt hungry mostly.

124
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,685
He was going to be the one
to eat this banana.

125
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,049
And Bob...

126
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,365
Bob was frightened
of the journey ahead.

127
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,726
Ah. Okay.

128
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,805
(Minionese)

129
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,166
Okay. Okay.

130
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,524
(Minionese)

131
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,005
And they were off.

132
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,368
Off to find their new boss!

133
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,364
(Minionese)

134
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,210
Huh? Kevin!

135
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,171
Huh?

136
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,127
(Minionese)

137
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,971
Huh? Banana!

138
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,766
Uh, Stuart?
(Minionese)

139
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,123
Banana. Banana!

140
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,526
Ugh! Ugh! Stuart!
(Minionese)

141
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,965
Stopa!

142
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,851
Uh, Bob! Stopa!

143
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,681
Huh? Oh!

144
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,969
Bob!
Huh?

145
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,770
(Minionese)

146
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,404
Uh, no, no.
No, no. No, no, no.

147
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,005
Profiterole.

148
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,681
No, no, no!

149
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,489
(Minionese)

150
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,800
Stuart...
(Minionese)

151
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,081
Ah!

152
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,968
(Indistinct)

153
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,765
Oh, look at that one!
Whoa!

154
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,888
(Minionese)

155
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,163
Peace!
Make love, not war!

156
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,321
Peace and love!

157
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,045
Boo ya! Boo ya! Boo ya!

158
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,360
Hey, hey, hey, oh.

159
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,601
(Minionese)
Kashmiri?

160
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,728
Boo ya! Boo ya! Boo ya!

161
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,330
Oh.

162
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,210
Banana!

163
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,561
Hey! Hey, taxi!
Hey! Hey!

164
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,641
Oh.

165
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,530
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

166
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,727
Banana! Hey, hey!

167
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,605
Stuart! Hey, oh!

168
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,887
(Minionese)

169
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,649
Kevin!

170
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,761
Bob!

171
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,204

Have you decided

214
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,289
which of these three gentlemen
you'll go on a date with?

215
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,010
Is it Bob?

Ugh.

275
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,925
Yeah, I see that!
Hey, Walter Junior!

276
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,001

Binky.
Mmm, mmm.

279

00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,208
Yay! New friends!

Stuart!
(Minionese)

285
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,449
Glad we came along before
some weirdos picked you up!

286
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,205
Who wants apple slices?

00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,731
Okay.
(Minionese)

291
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,961

Thanks, Man!

293
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,286
All righty!
Who needs to stretch their legs?

294
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,771
Yeah!
Yes! Me, me, me!

295
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,241
Sweet!
You guys wait here, we'll be right back.

296
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,527
Okay, Nelsons, let's do this!

297
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,810
(Minionese)

298
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,690
Go, go, go!

299
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,800
Okey dokey. On the road again.

300
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,049
Dad! We got company!

301
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,203
It's because I tripped the alarm.
I stink!

302
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,841
Hey, we all make mistakes, Sugarplum.
You're still learning.

303
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,646
Huh! What?

304
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,961
Your father's right, Tina.
Reload!

305
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,929
He wasn't this good
at being evil over night!

306
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,764
Reload!
Your time's coming.

307
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,325
It's jammed!

308
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,681
Huh?

309
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,169
(Minionese)

310
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,201
Okay, who did that?

311
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,687
Uh... (Minionese) Stuart!
Huh?

312
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,404
That was great!

313
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,130
Thank you!

314
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,890
(Minionese)

315
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,402
Say, fellas, can we get personal
for just a second?

316
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,529
Why are you going to Orlando?

317
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,409
(Minionese)

318
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,563
Come on. You can tell us.
You're going to Villain Con, aren't you?

319
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,440
(Minionese)
Villain Con.

320
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,164
Villain Con.

321
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,847
Wow! So many bad guys
in the car. What fun!

322
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,969
I knew it! I knew you were villains!
Didn't I, Honey?

323
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,850
What a small world!
Hope we're not in rival gangs.

324
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,446
Binky! Joke!
Babies, huh?

325
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,930
Yay.

326
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,323
(Minionese)
Big Boss!

327
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,971

328
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,688
(Minionese)

329
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,806
When we get to Orlando,

330
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,531
I'm gonna get all my favorite
villains to sign my magazine!

331
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,171
Dumo the Sumo!

332
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,890
(Minionese) Boss!

333
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,885
Oh, Kevin, you don't wanna work for him!
He ate his last henchmen!

334
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,961
Uh...

335
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,088
Frankie Fish Lips.

336
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,525
He lives in the ocean.

337
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,409
(Minionese) Boss?
Oh...

338
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,005
Can you breathe underwater?

339
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,525
Uh, so so.

340
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,886
Oh, oh, oh!

341
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,725
Look at her!
Scarlet Overkill!

342
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,485
The coolest super villain,
like, ever!

343
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,121
She started out as your average
little girl, braces, pigtails.

344
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,524
But by the time she was 13,
she built a criminal empire!

345
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,361
If I was a Minion,
that's who I'd want to work for!

346
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,602
(Minionese) Oh.

347
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,286
Here we are!
Beautiful Orlando!

348
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,805
Yeah! We're here!

349
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,768
Orlando!

350
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,611
Hey, Gang, watch this!

351
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,968
Welcome to Billy Bob's Bait Shop.
How can I help you?

352
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,923
Yeah, hi.
Uh...

353
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,409
We're here for, uh,
so much fun, it's a crime.

354
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,685
(Minionese)

355
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,081
Whoo hoo!

356
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,685
Villain Con!
(Minionese)

357
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,484
All right!
Here we go!

358
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,688
Well, this is it!
I wanna tell you, and I really mean this.

359
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,091
I really appreciate what you did

360
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,889
back there with the cops.
Really!

361
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,128
Dad!
It's Frankie Fish Lips!

362
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,248
I can smell him from here!

363
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,651
Junior!
Get my camera!

364
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,768
Good luck in there, Boys!

365
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,121
I hope you find what
you're looking for!

366
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,247
Bye!

367
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,321
(Minionese)

368
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,210
(Minionese)
Villain Con!

369
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,281
Yeah!

370
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,727
Villain Con!
Whoo!

371
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,082
Okay!
(Minionese)

372
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,647
Oh!

373
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,962
Any evil talents?

374
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,287
Not bad.

375
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,001
What about you?
Any evil talents?

376
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,127
Uh...

377
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,325
Bello!
La, la, la! La, la, la!

378
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,401
Eh?

379
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,881
That's not evil or a talent.

380
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,690
(Minionese)

381
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,327
Bello!

382
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,081
Ha ha!

383
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,481
No?

384
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,362
I'm sorry! But I'm not looking
for any more servants,

385
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,808
for I, Professor Flux, have invented

386
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,565
the world's first time machine!

387
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:35,602
Every time I visit the future,
I bring my future self back to help me.

388
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,681
Hello!

389
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,961
Oh.

390
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,922
Move that over there, Professor
Flux from two weeks from now.

391
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,049
As you can see,
I don't need any help.

392
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,690
Oh, way to go, Guys.
We killed the original!

393
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,281
Please!

394
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,888
Eh... (Minionese)

395
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,961
(Minionese)

396
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,441
Villain Con presents our
keynote speaker,

397
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,285
Scarlet Overkill!

398
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,931
The world's first
female super villain!

399
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,126
(Indistinct)

400
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,329
Appearing right now in Hall H!
Bob! Stuart! Buddies! Hey!

401
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,681
Buddies! (Minionese)

402
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,966
Scarlet?

403
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,405
Kevin!

404
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,771
Are you ready...

405
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,723
Yeah!
(Minionese)

406
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,406
For Scarlet Overkill!

407
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,487
Doesn't it feel so good to be bad?

408
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,050
Scarlet! Scarlet! Scarlet!
Yes!

409
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,360
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

410
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,286
Whoa.

411
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,091
Whoo hoo!

412
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,330
Awesome!

413
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,326
Yeah!

414
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,402
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
(Minionese)

415
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,329
Wow! Thank you!

416
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,368
Scarlet! Scarlet!

417
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,681
Thank you so much!

418
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,886
Okay.

419
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,926
Ah.

420
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,844
When I started out,
people said a woman

421
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,890
could never rob
a bank as well as a man!

422
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,368
Well, times change!

423
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,920
I love you, Scarlet!

424
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,765
Look at all those faces out there!

425
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,047
We are all so different!

426
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,963
But we have one thing in common.

427
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,290
We were born with flippers!

428
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,207
No? Just me? Okay.

429
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,764
We have big dreams!

430
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,446
And we will do anything
to make them come true!

431
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,570
Have any of you ever dreamt

432
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,850
of working for the greatest
super villain of all time?

433
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,480
Yeah!

434
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,567
Whoo hoo!

435
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,250
Well, what if I were to tell you

436
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,881
that I am looking for new henchmen?

437
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,168
Hey, Boss! Boss!
(Minionese)

438
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,608
I truly believe somewhere out there

439
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,651
is a villain with the potential
to serve greatness!

440
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,451
And it could be any of you.

441
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,681
Whoa!

442
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,842
Although, let's not kid ourselves.

443
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:31,608
Truly, the only men for this
job are Kevin and his Minions!

444
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,682
Huh? But... But...
Ten times the evil

445
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,969
in half the package!
I am just in awe!

446
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,963
Let's hear it for Kevin.

447
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,691
He saved his tribe!

448
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,041
Kevin! Kevin! Kevin!

449
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,367
Kevin! Kevin! Kevin...
Hey! Kevin. Hey. Hey!

450
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,647
Argh!
(Minionese)

451
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,203
So, how should we do this?
Hmm.

452
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,121
Oh.

453
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,601
You see this tiny little trinket?

454
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,242
Well, just take it from my
hand and you've got the job.

455
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,886
No big deal, it's almost too simple.

456
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,241
Uh...

457
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,810
Oh, come on!
Don't be afraid.

458
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,248
Just take the stone
and get that job! Come on!

459
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,321
Oh, okay.

460
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,129
(Minionese)
Boss!

461
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,440
That job is mine!

462
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,567
Ooh!

463
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,886
Now go easy on me.

464
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,769
Whoops!

465
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,203
Love the costume!

466
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,401
Ha!

467
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,961
Uh...

468
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,526
(Minionese)

469
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,886
So cool!

470
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,961
(Minionese)

471
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,641
Tim? Tim!

472
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,887
Uh...

473
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,883
Oh, no, Bob!
(Minionese)

474
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,247
Ah! Tim! Tim!

475
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,084
Is no one good enough?

476
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,287
Bob!

477
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,884
(Indistinct)

478
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,201
(Indistinct)

479
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,611
(Minionese)

480
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,966
I got it! I got it!

481
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,206
Ah!

482
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,365
Didn't my speech inspire anyone

483
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,211
to rise up and prove
themselves worthy?

484
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,606
All these villains and
yet I still have the bear.

485
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,967
Stuffed bear!
Why am I holding a bear?

486
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,929
(Indistinct)
Who has the ruby?

487
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,010
Wow! Who...

488
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,841
Who are you,
my Knights in shining denim?

489
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,651
(Minionese)
Stuart.

490
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,171
Bob.
Minions!

491
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,607
That was incredible!

492
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,371
Behold!
The last creatures you'd expect

493
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,165
to win the day have emerged victorious!

494
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,608
Everyone, meet my new henchmen.
The Minions!

495
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,048
Kumbaya! Kumbaya! Kumbaya!

496
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,205
Kumbaya!

497
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,450
Hey! I know those guys!
I gave them a ride here!

498
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,409
Whoo hoo!
Whoo hoo hoo!

499
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,846
Buckle up, Boys!
Next stop, England.

500
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,523
Oh... (Minionese)

501
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,884
(Minionese)

502
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,811
(Minionese)

503
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,121
(Mumbling)

504
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,006
Bello?

505
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,321
Hey, Kevin! Eh?

506
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,649
(Minionese)
Boss? In England?

507
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,880
Nah, (Minionese) Boss!

508
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,921
(Minionese)

509
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,048
(Minionese)

510
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,043
Ah, uh... Bello, Kevin?

511
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,281
(Minionese)
England?

512
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,209
(Minionese)
Uh huh. (Minionese) Boss?

513
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,442
Scarlet Popapil. Ah.

514
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,368
(Minionese)

515
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,442
Bello? Bello!
(Minionese) Bello?

516
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,244
Oh!
Wow!

517
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,204
Ah!

518
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,280
Here we go! There.

519
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,764
By the way,
I really like your bear.

520
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,084
Herb! My baby!

521
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,650
You know I am!

522
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,247
How'd it go?

523
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,765
Were you evil?

524
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,922
So evil!
Oh!

525
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,401
A little bird dropped this
off today.

526
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,806
(Whispers)

527
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,611
It's me, I'm the "H."

528
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,570
Also, there was no bird.
Also me.

529
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,440
Herb, seriously, I wanna dig
up that William Shakespeare

530
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,807
so he can see what true
writing is.

531
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,086
I love it!

532
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,970
Ah, that works out because I love...

533
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,964
Well, I love... Too.

534
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,849
Ah, the love, ah!

535
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,651
Oh! Oh, ah.

536
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,724
Oh, Boys, could you come here, please?

537
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:15,807
Meet my husband, Herb.
Inventor, super genius, fox.

538
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,128
Herb, these are the new recruits.

539
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,488
Kevin, Stuart, and that
cute little one is Bob.

540
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,846
Hey, Bello!
(Minionese)

541
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,720
Right on! You guys are crazy
little and way yellow,

542
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,201
And I dig that!

543
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,881
Sweet, Man!

544
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,202
Ah, ah.

545
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,890
Whoa! (Minionese)

546
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,724
I know, right?
Ah!

547
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,804
Just a few things I stole to
help fill the void.

548
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,966
Whoa!
(Minionese) Mega ukulele!

549
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,610
Checkin' out my can?

550
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,489
We stole that because finally someone

551
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,881
expressed my love of
soup in painting form.

552
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,291
Wow!
Ooh!

553
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:04,046
Okay, listen up!
It is time to get down to business.

554
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,606
Do you know who this is?

555
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,888
Uh... (Minionese)

556
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,601
This is Queen Elizabeth,
ruler of England.

557
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,768
Oh, I love England.
The music, the fashion.

558
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,286
I'm seriously thinking
about over throwing it someday.

559
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,522
Ooh!
(Minionese)

560
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,286
Anyway, this pale drink of
water over sees it all.

561
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,330
I'm her biggest fan, love her work!

562
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,324
And I really, really,
really want her crown.

563
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,482
(Minionese)

564
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,522
Steal me the crown and all
your dreams come true.

565
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,967
Respect! Power!

566
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,280
Banana!

567
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,450
Banana!

568
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,646
Whoo hoo hoo hoo!

569
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,370
(Minionese)

570
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,804
(Muttering)
Ha!

571
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,406
Henry!

572
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,610
(Minionese)
England. Uh...

573
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,409
(Minionese)

574
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,482
(Minionese)
England...

575
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,244
(Minionese)

576
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,449
(Minionese)

577
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,205
(Minionese)

578
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,851
(Minionese)

579
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,561
Oh, uh...

580
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,325
Hmm.
(Minionese)

581
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,606
Heh.
(Minionese)

582
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,842
Wow!
Whoa.

583
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,605
Ooh la la.

584
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,444
No!
Oh, no.

585
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,885
Don't get too close, Boys.

586
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,803
When it's completed,
it'll be my ultimate weapon.

587
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,363
But right now, it's leaking radiation
like you would not believe!

588
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,125
So, you're here for gear.

589
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,120
Whoa!

590
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,528
Bob, Robert, Bobby, My Boy.

591
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,043
(Minionese)
You get my far out stretch suit.

592
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,441
Wow!

593
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,726
Kevin, Kev bo, Seventh Kevin,

594
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,883
you are the proud owner
of my lava lamp gun.

595
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,248
Ah?
This baby shoots actual lava!

596
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,046
Ooh! (Minionese)

597
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,764
Pretty cool, right?

598
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:25,607
And finally, Stu. Stu art,
Stu perman, Beef Stu.

599
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,570
I got you the coolest invention,
probably ever.

600
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,210
Oh.

601
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,248
Hypno hat!
Uh, oh.

602
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,681
Uh...

603
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,521
(Mutters)

604
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,326
You can use it to hypnotize anyone.
Anyone!

605
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,325
Oh, you look so great!

606
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,289
I feel like a proud mama
with three

607
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,362
dashing evil sons.

608
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,603
Uh, Scarlet...
Scarlet... (Minionese)

609
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,411
No, no. Don't say anything.
I won't understand.

610
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,445
It's getting late.
You've had a big day, you must be exhausted!

611
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,686
Boing, boing, boing, boing, boing...

612
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,921
Wow! These cats are pumped!

613
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,164
Well, maybe I'll settle them
down with a bedtime story?

614
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,322
Ha ha!

615
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,682
How does that sound, Bob?
Bob. Bob! Bob!

616
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,569
Oh! Bedtime porry?

617
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,928
That is a groovy idea!
I'll go get some cookies and warm milk.

618
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,924
This is gonna be so fun!

619
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,286
(Minionese)
Bedtime porry.

620
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,809
Oh, yes, I've got a really,
really good bedtime porry.

621
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:38,729
Once upon a time,
there were three little pigs.

622
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,926
One fateful day, the pigs
encountered a big, bad wolf...

623
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,405
Who had a wonderful
surprise for them!

624
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,609
The wolf offered the three
piggies and all their friends

625
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,523
a job working for her.

626
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,365
Everyone would be so happy!

627
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,725
All the three little piggies
had to do

628
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,723
was just steal one little crown

629
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,484
that the beautiful wolf had wanted

630
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,531
ever since she was
a penniless little street cub,

631
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,649
unloved and abandoned.

632
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,847
But that crown would mean
she was a Princess,

633
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,082
and everybody loves a Princess!

634
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,640
So the wolf sent the piggies
to get that crown.

635
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,082
But the little pigs
weren't up to the challenge.

636
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,003
They failed their mission.

637
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:32,124
So the wolf huffed and puffed, and she
blew them off the face of the earth!

638
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,481
Yo, po, po!

639
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,286
The end.

640
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,970
(Indistinct)

641
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,642
Good luck getting that crown
tomorrow, Little Piggies.

642
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,121
I know you won't disappoint me.

643
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,841
Um.

644
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,040
Okay.

645
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,090
(Minionese) Scarlet.

646
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,844
Which way is the loo, please?
Hmm.

647
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,001
Oh, thank you.
Ah.

648
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,764
(Minionese)

649
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,925
Bello.

650
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,764
Uh...
(Minionese) Please.

651
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:24,164
You're not allowed in without an adult.
Scram, Hooligans!

652
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,651
Oh.

653
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,929
(Minionese)
Uh, mm.

654
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,291
Ooh...
(Minionese)

655
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,084
(Minionese)
Oh, la...

656
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,686
Stuart... (Minionese)

657
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,924
How many tickets, please?

658
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,206
(Indistinct)

659
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,520
(Minionese)
Please.

660
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,171
(Minionese)
Please.

661
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,322
(Minionese)

662
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,525
Enjoy yourself, Love.

663
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,965
Thank you!

664
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,531
It was nowhere near Hyde Park!

665
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,840
Bob's your uncle.

666
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,605
Huh, hmm.

667
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,569
(Minionese)
Okay.

668
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,730
Okay.
(Minionese)

669
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,529
Huh? Ah!

670
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,051
(Minionese)

671
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,964
He hey.

672
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,651
Okay.
(Minionese)

673
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,721
Hey!

674
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,723
What are you doing here?

675
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,484
(Minionese)

676
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,042
This is a restricted area!
Hands in the air!

677
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,770
No... (Minionese)

678
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,001
(Minionese)

679
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,648
(Minionese)

680
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,640
Stop that!

681
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,722
(Minionese)

682
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,609
Get back.

683
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,804
(Minionese)

684
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,201
Yay!

685
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,009
Ah!

686
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,762
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

687
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,604
Bob, Stuart...
(Minionese)

688
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,841
(Minionese)

689
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,124
(Minionese)

690
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,045
So...

691
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:09,324
So, you came for the Queen's
Crown, did you?

692
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,529
Well, you're gonna
have to get through me!

693
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,206
The Keeper of the Crown!

694
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,242
Ow! Hey!

695
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,130
You think it's funny to mock
the elderly, do you?

696
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,200
Uh... (Minionese)

697
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,601
I've been up here for decades,

698
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,728
just waiting for someone to try

699
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,768
and steal the Queen's treasure!

700
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,970
Okay.
(Minionese)

701
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,844
(Minionese)

702
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,127
What are you saying?
Never mind, don't care!

703
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,285
Oh, no! (Minionese)

704
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,806
Oh, no, you don't!

705
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,930
Oh, flippin' heck!

706
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,681
What's goin' on?

707
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,364
(Minionese)

708
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,720
Bob...
(Minionese)

709
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,531
Eh... Hmm.
Wow.

710
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,201
(Minionese)

711
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,771
(Minionese)

712
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,600
(Minionese)

713
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,045
Hello!

714
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,326
(Minionese)

715
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,128
Huh?

716
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,285
(Minionese)

717
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,643
(Minionese)

718
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,521
Hello!

719
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,127
Stone the crows!

720
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,201
Stop him, Lads!
Wait!

721
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,611
Go for the legs!

722
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,166
Gordon Bennett!

723
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,685
Kevin!

724
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,563
The Queen's been kidnapped, Sarge!

725
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,687
Blimey!

726
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,327
Hyah! Hyah!

727
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,401
Ooh!

728
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,006
(Minionese)

729
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,969
Ha! Boo ya!

730
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,008
Huh. Hyah! Hyah!

731
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,321
What's going on?
Bello!

732
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,481
Oh, my goodness!

733
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,001
Whoa!
Ha ha! (Minionese)

734
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,161
No!

735
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,249
Gentlemen do not steal
ladies' crowns!

736
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:57,966
Huh? Hmm?

737
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,570
Huh?

738
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,801
(Minionese)

739
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,845
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

740
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,841
Oh, dear!

741
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,766
Ah! Ahhh!

742
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,006
Yeah!

743
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,521
You scoundrel!
After them! Uh oh.

744
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,001
Stop the blighter!

745
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,848
Go on, grab him!

746
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,441
Huh?

747
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,280
Huh? Oh.

748
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,451
Cor, blimey!

749
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,643
One of England's most famous
myths has become a reality

750
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,727
as a new King has been crowned.

751
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,009
Bob, who appears to be a bald,
jaundiced child,

752
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,487
has pulled the famed sword
right from its stone,

753
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,291
which, legend dictates,
makes him the new King.

754
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,364
Tiny yellow traitor!

755
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,282
England!

756
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,283
England! England!

757
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,721
England! England! England!

758
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,644
England! England...

759
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,921
(Minionese)
Ha, ha!

760
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,202
(Minionese)

761
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,209
(Minionese)

762
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,048
(Indistinct)

763
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:12,766
(Minionese)

764
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,205
Bello!

765
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,521
Bello!

766
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,801
Cut!

767
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,002
Hey, Bob. (Minionese)

768
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,127
(Minionese)

769
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,443
Hello, King Bob.
Uh...

770
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,091
Welcome to Buckingham Palace.

771
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,286
Uh, no.

772
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,121
Oh, what's the matter, Your Majesty?

773
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,282
Whatever's bothering you,
we can make it right.

774
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,521
Just name it!

775
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,601
Oh.

776
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,689
Buddies!

777
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,886
Buddies! Buddies!

778
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,202
Buddies!

779
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,969
(Minionese)

780
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,485
Oh.
(Minionese)

781
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,050
Uh... (Minionese)

782
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,201
(Minionese)

783
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,010
King Bob!

784
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,846
Long live the King!

785
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,843
King Bob!
(Minionese)

786
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,131
Bob... (Minionese)
King...

787
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,805
(Minionese)

788
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,006
(Minionese)

789
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,483
So... (Minionese)

790
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,161
(Minionese)

791
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,001
King Bob!

792
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,486
Oh... Yeah!

793
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,005
King Bob! Wait!

794
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,323
Wow!
Whoa!

795
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,331
Whoo hoo!

796
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,367
Oh...

797
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,441
Yee haw!

798
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,641
King Bob!

799
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,960
Hyah!

800
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,365
(Minionese)

801
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,848
Hmm? Huh! Ah!

802
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,682
Yes, King Bob. Oh.

803
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,961
King Bob?

804
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,926
King Bob?

805
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,326
Ah, Claire.

806
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,811
Mmm, Tiffany.

807
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,202
(Minionese) Rawr!

808
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,485
Ball!

809
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,248
How dare you!

810
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,366
Scarlet!

811
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,206
Don't you "Scarlet" me,
you backstabbing little traitors!

812
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,045
Using Herb's invention
to steal my crown?

813
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,647
I feel used.
Not gonna lie.

814
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:34,489
You stole my dream!
I was going to conquer England someday!

815
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,483
There was gonna be a coronation,

816
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,086
and I was going to be made Queen.

817
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,003
Every moment was planned.

818
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,448
I'd wear a dress so sparkly,
it glowed!

819
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:48,809
And everyone who ever
doubted me would be watching,

820
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,724
and they would be crying!

821
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,441
I was going to be the picture
of elegance and class!

822
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,205
And you pinheads screwed it up!

823
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,129
No, no, no!
(Minionese)

824
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,681
No, no, no, King Bob!
You cannot just abdicate the throne!

825
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,444
Who invited the square?

826
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:11,206
And you definitely cannot just
give the job to this woman!

827
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,645
There are laws!

828
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,802
Boss. (Minionese)
Boss.

829
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,407
(Minionese)
Scarlet Popapil!

830
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,091
(Minionese)
King Bob has officially changed the law,

831
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,889
Clearing the way for Scarlet Overkill

832
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,849
to be crowned Queen of England!

833
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,242
She will be coronated at
London's historic Westminster Abbey.

834
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:35,211
If I wasn't so polite, I'd say this
spells certain doom for the country,

835
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,805
if not the world.

836
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,486
But I'm so very polite that
I shall keep my mouth shut.

837
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,961
But, seriously,
we're all in big trouble.

838
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,769
Scarlet! Scarlet!

839
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,240
I don't have time
to answer any questions.

840
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,970
I just want to thank the Minions

841
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,329
for going above and
beyond the call of duty.

842
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,404
You are three tiny, golden...

843
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,960
Pill shaped miracle workers,

844
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:03,523
and you have stolen
not just England but my heart.

845
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,090
Scarlet, over here!

846
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,481
(Minionese)

847
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,925
Pardon me?
(Minionese)

848
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,727
Eh?

849
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,930
Wow! So many!
Good for you!

850
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,923
Well, you'll all get what you deserve.

851
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,884
Serve! (Minionese)
Serve!

852
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,521
Whoo hoo!

853
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,683
(Minionese)

854
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:48,801
Oh.

855
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,769
Go ahead, go ahead.

856
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,370
Uh...

857
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,691
(Minionese)

858
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,363
Uh...

859
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,569
I don't want you to take this
the wrong way, but I hate you.

860
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,443
I thought I could get over what
you did, but I feel so betrayed.

861
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:16,484
I think... Yes, I think we're
gonna have to break up.

862
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,040
And it's not you.

863
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,727
Wait, hold on.
It is you. It's 100% you!

864
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,205
No, no.

865
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:28,649
So get comfortable, Minions.
Get real, real comfortable.

866
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,161
Because this is where
you're going to spend

867
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:35,245
the rest of your
worthless little lives.

868
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,764
All right!
Let's do this!

869
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,564
(Minionese) Herb!

870
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,768
Who's this handsome "Herb" fella?

871
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:48,526
No, my name is "Blerb."
I'm a dungeon master.

872
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,561
Prepare for torture, which I do!

873
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:57,723
All right, are we comfy?
Doesn't matter! This is torture!

874
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,205
Huh.
Oh. (Minionese)

875
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,520
(Minionese)

876
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,604
Wow! Harder than I thought.
Next machine!

877
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:12,562
Oh, welcome to Hang Town!
Population, you!

878
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,284
Oh.

879
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,683
(Minionese)

880
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,601
Whoo hoo!

881
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,126
Cut it out!
This is really unprofessional!

882
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,043
There's no laughing in the dungeon!

883
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,691
I wanna see tears and
I wanna hear screams,

884
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,922
or I'm gonna get... Wait!

885
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,002
Hey!
Ooh! I've got a groovy idea!

886
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,081
Ah!

887
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,242
Look at this!
Argh!

888
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,650
Hello!
Will the future King, Herb Overkill,

889
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,166
please come upstairs to
prepare for the coronation?

890
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,527
Well, I hope you learned
your lesson for today.

891
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,001
(Minionese)

892
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:56,688
And by the way, it was me,
Herb, the whole time!

893
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,411
I don't even know
anyone named "Blerb"!

894
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,284
Uh, Herb...
(Minionese)

895
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,801
Oh. Huh.

896
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:10,611
I am hours away from becoming
the Queen of England!

897
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,569
I know! It's a gas!

898
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,563
I will finally get my crown.
Yeah.

899
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,087
It's all I've ever wanted.
I'm going to be so happy.

900
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:22,483
But let me ask you something, Fabrice.

901
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,530
Does that look like this to you?

902
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:33,569
Mrs. Overkill, the hair in that
picture, it's just two wavy lines!

903
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,408
Oh, so, what,
now you're an art critic?

904
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,883
I drew that when I was five years old!
Get out of my sight!

905
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,125
Bye, Fabrice!

906
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,768
I liked him. He was fun.

907
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,408
So, what do you think of the dress?

908
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:57,044
Oh, it's so beautiful.
So fashion forward. So Valentino.

909
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,331
Gave it a sweetheart neckline
because you're my sweetheart.

910
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,129
The high collar and cinched waist

911
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,487
reflect a simpler,
more violent time.

912
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:08,121
The material is a blend of taffeta
and high density body armor.

913
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,645
Fully armed and loaded.

914
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,491
And that glow, that's nuclear.

915
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,608
Nice. Just one more thing to do.

916
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,722
Gotta look good for the public.

917
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,801
Ugh.

918
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,207
Do you mind?

919
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,281
My pleasure.

920
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,771
Little tighter, Sweetie.
Come on, I can take it.

921
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,402
Little tighter.

922
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,448
Tighter!

923
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,205
Must have tiny waist.

924
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,490
Seeing stars, seeing stars!

925
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,450
Losing feeling in my legs. Perfect!
Tie it, tie it, tie it, tie it.

926
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,284
(Minionese)

927
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,801
Huh?

928
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,001
Ah. Bob! Stuart!

929
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,320
Eh?
(Minionese)

930
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,967
(Minionese)

931
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:55,131
(Minionese)

932
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,841
Ooh! Bello!
Ooh ooh!

933
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,684
(Minionese)

934
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,808
Ah! Oh.

935
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,044
(Minionese)
Ah.

936
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,804
(Minionese)

937
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,689
Huh!

938
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,890
(Minionese)

939
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,081
Ah.

940
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,331
(Minionese)

941
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,410
Eh, eh, Kevin...
(Minionese) Scarlet.

942
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:26,647
(Minionese)

943
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,650
Ah!
(Minionese)

944
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,401
"Porry Scarlet."

945
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,001
(Minionese)

946
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,760
He, he!
(Minionese) Boss.

947
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,121
Oh.

948
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,486
(Minionese)

949
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,411
Ah, okay!

950
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,641
(Minionese)

951
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,165
(Minionese)

952
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,041
Huh?

953
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,444
I love you, Scarlet!

954
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,362
Queen wave, Queen wave!
Queen waving!

955
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,370
I am so, so excited! This is perfect!

956
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,442
Everyone looks so nice!

957
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:27,081
Oh! Oh, you are just adorable!

958
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:29,927
Oh, yes!

959
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,570
And that music, oh!

960
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:36,923
Who is that organist?
She is good! Right? She looks like an Edna.

961
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,686
Edna, you are very good!
Who was that? Whoa!

962
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,729
Thanks for doing this, padre. Big fan.
Uh huh.

963
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:50,486
Come here, let me squeeze you!
Oh, you are so squishy!

964
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,160
(Minionese)
Scarlet.

965
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,322
(Minionese)
Go, go, Go!

966
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,360
(Minionese)

967
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,365
Ouch! Ouch!

968
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,011
(Minionese)

969
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,484
(Minionese)
(Minionese)

970
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:16,846
(Minionese)
Sayonara!

971
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,571
Ciao...
(Minionese)

972
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,086
(Minionese)

973
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,445
(Minionese)
Bob...

974
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,806
Stuart!

975
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,729
(Minionese)

976
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,690
Aww! Oo ooh!

977
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,768
Okay! (Minionese)

978
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,001
Oh! Beh...

979
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,523
Will you to your power

980
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,722
cause law and justice...

981
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,211
(Minionese)
Popapil!

982
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,441
Oh!
Ah...

983
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,765
Hmm? Ah...

984
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,490
Huh? Uh... Uh...
(Minionese)

985
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,409
Stopa!
(Minionese)

986
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,045
(Minionese)
Bah!

987
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,929
(Minionese)

988
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,684
In mercy...

989
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,845
No, no, no!

990
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,691
Do you, Scarlet Overkill...

991
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:38,766
(Minionese)

992
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,251
Yeah!

993
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,805
Huh? Oh?

994
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,041
No!

995
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,964
(Minionese)

996
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,690
Uh, mmm...

997
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:54,921
(Minionese)

998
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,720
(Minionese)
(Minionese) Bob.

999
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,164
(Minionese)

1000
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:08,562
I proclaim thee, Scarlet Overkill,

1001
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,842
the Queen of England!
Oh! Huh?

1002
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,447
Kevin!

1003
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:16,561
Huh?

1004
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,525
Scarlet! Scarlet, My Queen?

1005
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,364
Somebody help me!

1006
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:33,644
Come on, come on!
Lift on two. One, two!

1007
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,725
One, two!

1008
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,404
(Minionese)

1009
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,811
Huh?

1010
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,810
Scarlet! You're okay!

1011
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,482
He tried to kill me!

1012
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,369
Uh, no...
(Minionese)

1013
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:59,163
Villains, this is no longer a coronation!
It is an execution!

1014
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,810
Get them!

1015
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:08,290
Whoa, Nelly!
Run, Fellas, run!

1016
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,689
Come back here, you!

1017
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,281
Ah!

1018
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,770
(Minionese)

1019
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,329
Uh?

1020
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,006
(Minionese)

1021
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:40,041
Hyah!

1022
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,161
(Minionese)

1023
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,281
Aah!

1024
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,601
(Minionese)

1025
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:54,681
You're mine!

1026
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,000
Stuart, Bob! Uh...

1027
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:00,651
(Minionese)

1028
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:09,921
Oops!

1029
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:14,921
Oh!
(Minionese)

1030
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,650
Hey! I got one!

1031
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:26,921
(Minionese)

1032
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:37,921
Tim!

1033
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,041
Huh?

1034
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:45,366
Oh? Aww! Oh!
(Minionese)

1035
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,601
Uh? Eh?

1036
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,481
Tim!

1037
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,485
Stuart! Bob!

1038
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,250
(Minionese)

1039
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,685
Buddies!

1040
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,684
Mind the gap.

1041
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,091
Mind the gap.

1042
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:15,287
Mind the gap!
Mind the gap! Mind the gap!

1043
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,885
Mind the gap.

1044
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,246
Mind the gap!

1045
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,166
He won't get away!

1046
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:22,446
He won't escape us!

1047
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,720
Huh?

1048
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,001
What about this one?

1049
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:34,406
Why did the Queen go to the dentist?

1050
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,128
To get her teeth crowned.

1051
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,441
Heh! (Minionese)

1052
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,727
Tell us another one, Lizzy!

1053
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,801
Uh, uh...

1054
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,450
Bello!
Oh!

1055
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:45,721
It's you.

1056
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,531
Everyone, this is one
of the little fellows

1057
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,171
who stole the monarchy from me.

1058
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,686
And how's that working out
for you?

1059
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,922
Uh, Scarlet...
(Minionese)

1060
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,810
Oh, yes, yes, I saw what
was going on on the telly.

1061
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,006
Uh, telly?

1062
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,849
What was meant to
be the coronation of

1063
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,810
Scarlet Overkill has
gone terribly wrong as...

1064
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,041
Move!

1065
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:11,201
Kevin, Kevin,
I know you're out there.

1066
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:15,285
You think you've gotten away?
Well, what do we have here?

1067
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,361
Bello!

1068
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,249
Oh, my goodness!
Bob? Stuart?

1069
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,721
Which one shall I kill first?

1070
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:23,610
Little Bob? Stuart?

1071
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:26,251
Bob! Stuart!

1072
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:31,169
I will do it, Kevin,
if you are not back here by dawn!

1073
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:32,927
Oh, my!

1074
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,001
No!

1075
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,889
(Minionese)
Buddies!

1076
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:37,246
(Minionese)
Scarlet.

1077
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,164
There he is!

1078
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,086
Follow me!

1079
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:07,601
Ah! Ha haa!

1080
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,322
Who the man, eh?

1081
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,245
Uh... Oh!

1082
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,566
Oh.

1083
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,281
Harder! It's just my head.

1084
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,364
Oh, no!

1085
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:24,805
This way! Let's get him!

1086
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,245
Go, go, go!

1087
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:32,205
No! (Minionese)

1088
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,400
Huh?

1089
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,641
Oh.

1090
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,171
Huh?

1091
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,761
Ultimate weapon initiated.

1092
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:01,164
Activation in three, two, one.

1093
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,930
Bello.

1094
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,448
Huh? (Minionese)
Buddies!

1095
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,204
(Mumbling)

1096
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:43,243
This is it, Boys!

1097
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:45,607
Things do not look good for you.

1098
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,290
Oh, and I'm keeping the bear.

1099
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,805
Tim!

1100
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,326
You're not gonna need him
where you're going.

1101
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:52,606
Heaven.

1102
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:59,250
Huh? Uh... Aah!

1103
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,800
Shoosh, shoosh, shoosh, shoosh!
Oh!

1104
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,484
Huh? Ah!

1105
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,731
Bye bye. Say bye bye,
Bob. Bye bye!

1106
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:38,811
(Mumbling)

1107
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:42,446
(Minionese)

1108
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,403
(Minionese)
Huh?

1109
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,005
Oh, whoa!

1110
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,762
Wait, what? How did he...

1111
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,922
Hold my bear.

1112
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,161
Huh?

1113
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,207
(Minionese)

1114
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,444
Yippee! Whoo hoo hoo!
Kevin!

1115
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,851
(Minionese)

1116
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,206
(Minionese)

1117
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,805
So, that's your plan?

1118
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:28,121
Make yourself a bigger target?

1119
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,442
(Minionese)

1120
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,602
(Minionese)
Huh?

1121
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,648
K-K-Kevin? Hey!

1122
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:39,290
(Minionese)
Kevin!

1123
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:42,250
(Minionese)

1124
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,400
Whoa!

1125
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,801
(Minionese) Ow!

1126
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,121
And so help me,

1127
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,407
I never wanna see another one of

1128
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,801
your goofy,
bug eyed faces ever again!

1129
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,880
Scarlet! Scarlet! Scarlet!
What?

1130
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,447
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me!

1131
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,684
Oh no, you don't!

1132
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,441
Whoa!

1133
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,844
And just for the record,
my little deviled eggs,

1134
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:34,288
you can thank Kevin for what
I'm about to do to you!

1135
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,524
Ow! Ow!

1136
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,603
Bob! Stuart! Buddies!

1137
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,127
Tony!

1138
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,440
Tom!

1139
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:50,443
(Minionese) Chris!

1140
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,045
You the man!

1141
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:56,125
Buddies! Mazel tov.

1142
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,806
Ugh! Ew!

1143
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,682
Ooh! Aah! Kevin! Kevin!

1144
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:16,044
Enough! This ends now!

1145
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,084
Kevin!

1146
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:48,801
You imbecile!
Have fun exploding!

1147
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,006
Baby!

1148
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,246
What's the rush?

1149
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,481
Got to get out of here!

1150
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:57,445
Let us go!

1151
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,247
No, no, no, no!

1152
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,288
Kevin!

1153
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,761
(Minionese)

1154
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,684
(Minionese)

1155
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,842
(Minionese)

1156
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:41,286
Kevin...
(Minionese)

1157
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:51,002
(Minionese)

1158
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,003
Huh?

1159
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,325
Ha ha! Whoo hoo!

1160
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:26,841
Ooh!

1161
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:46,570
Stuart?
Hmm.

1162
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:48,051
Bob?
(Minionese)

1163
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:51,881
Okay.

1164
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,406
(Minionese)

1165
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:12,251
Ladies and Gentlemen, we are here
today to celebrate the Minions!

1166
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,488
Huh!

1167
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:21,841
The country owes you
a great debt of gratitude.

1168
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:27,686
Bob, you were a wise and noble
King for all of eight hours.

1169
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:33,684
So for you, I offer this tiny
crown for your teddy bear, Tim.

1170
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,920
(Minionese)

1171
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,411
Oh, very good, Bob!

1172
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,442
Oh, spectacular!

1173
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,444
I'm so proud of you boys!

1174
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:49,330
Oh, Stuart.
(Minionese)

1175
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:54,964
For you, I have this beautiful,
super-duper, incredible...

1176
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,486
Ah!
Snow globe!

1177
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,449
Eh? Poglobe?
Uh, ze...

1178
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:02,808
And look, look, hours of excitement!

1179
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,931
Oh, uh...

1180
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,810
Yippee.
Uh, eh, gracias.

1181
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:13,524
Stuart, we're just messing
with you!

1182
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:17,603
Don't be mad at me,
it was Kevin's idea.

1183
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:19,682
Kevin!

1184
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:22,730
We have a much
better surprise for you!

1185
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:25,411
(Minionese) Super mega ukulele!

1186
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,687
Uh... Wow!
(Minionese)

1187
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:01,365
(Minionese)
Poglobe.

1188
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:03,680
Thank you.

1189
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,363
Right. Uh...

1190
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,568
And finally, Kevin!

1191
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:10,806
(Minionese)

1192
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:15,007
You are a hero of the highest order.

1193
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:19,290
For your bravery and valor,
I am knighting you.

1194
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:23,328
From here on out, you are Sir Kevin.

1195
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:25,486
Well done.

1196
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:37,847
What a beautiful moment!

1197
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:40,440
Kumbaya!
Kumbaya!

1198
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:45,560
The nation, nay, the world was
celebrating Kevin, Stuart and Bob.

1199
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:48,962
The last few thousand years
were rough, no question,

1200
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:52,647
but things were
finally going their way!

1201
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,970
Kevin had never been more proud.

1202
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,683
But something was missing.

1203
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:01,925
Yes, good show, good show!

1204
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,600
My crown is gone! It's gone!

1205
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,160
Blimey!

1206
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,043
She's lost the crown!
Oh, my days!

1207
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,121
(Minionese)

1208
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:14,961
Scarlet?

1209
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:18,442
(Minionese)
Scarlet! Hey!

1210
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,602
(Minionese)
Scarlet! Hey!

1211
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:24,480
They took everything from me!
My castle! My reputation!

1212
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,325
Things look bleak, Baby,
I'm not gonna lie!

1213
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:30,609
But now at least I have my crown!

1214
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,528
Child, give me that back.

1215
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,409
No, I don't think so!

1216
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:54,802
You have no idea who
you're messing with!

1217
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,724
I am the greatest
super villain of all time!

1218
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,370
Oh!

1219
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:00,811
Were you?

1220
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,882
B... B... Buddies...
(Minionese)

1221
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:23,644
Ah!

1222
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:31,969
(Minionese)
Boss! Ha, ha!

1223
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:35,283
Get back! Are you really going
to allow that little penguin

1224
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,170
to make off with my crown?

1225
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:41,480
Herb.

1226
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:43,810
I'm done.

1227
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,250
(Minionese)

1228
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:49,321
For me?

1229
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,450
(Minionese)

1230
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,001
Bye bye!

1231
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,250
Big Boss!

1232
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:03,002
And that is how the Minions
found their new boss.

1233
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:06,607
He was cunning, he was evil,
he was perfect.

1234
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:10,480
He was despicable.

1235
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:52,727
Huh?

1236
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:54,640
Banana!
Banana!

1237
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:55,721
Banana!

1238
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,840
(Minionese)
Banana! Banana! Banana!

1239
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:09,161
Banana!

1240
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,367
Cheese! Cheese! Cheese!

1241
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:33,685
Gru! Gru! Gru!

1242
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:45,570
Gru!

1243
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:35,607
(Minionese)

1244
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,688
Bob...
(Minionese)

1245
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:57,602
Hey! Come back here!

1246
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:45,445
Freeze ray!
