1
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,706
I promise you.

2
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,318
I'll make this right.

3
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,461
<i>Dear Jonas,</i>

4
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:34,561
<i>you promised to make
everything right again.</i>

5
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,835
<i>I want you to know you will do that.</i>

6
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,770
<i>You must never lose hope that
there is a way out of this maze.</i>

7
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,971
<i>A way to save me...</i>

8
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,656
<i>and you.</i>

9
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,815
<i>But we both have to make sacrifices,</i>

10
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,166
<i>do unimaginable things,</i>

11
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,178
<i>to untie the knot at the end.</i>

12
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:19,286
<i>Each fate in this knot
is tied to the next.</i>

13
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,706
<i>A thread,</i>

14
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,298
<i>red like blood,</i>

15
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,475
<i>that connects all our deeds.</i>

16
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:31,358
<i>In light...</i>

17
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,880
<i>and in shadow.</i>

18
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,926
Why is Adam doing this?

19
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,975
Why are you locking me up?

20
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,030
<i>But the apocalypse</i>

21
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,685
<i>must take place.</i>

22
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:02,248
<i>You must let me die</i>

23
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,870
<i>so I can live.</i>

24
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,270
<i>We have to let some things go before
they find their way back to us.</i>

25
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,578
<i>We are a perfect match.</i>

26
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:18,133
<i>Never believe anything else.</i>

27
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:27,003
LIGHT AND SHADOW

28
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:48,003
DAY OF THE APOCALYPSE

29
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,664
Martha?

30
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,248
Man, where were you?

31
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,080
Mum cried all night long.

32
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,583
Is everything okay?

33
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:22,791
Hey.

34
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,780
What happened?

35
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,166
What's wrong?

36
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,071
He was absolutely right.

37
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,495
Bartosz was right.

38
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,331
What he said in the forest...

39
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,083
about the end of the world.

40
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,373
The nuclear power plant. Today.

41
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,789
Bartosz's father is trying
to cover up an accident.

42
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,998
The barrels. I know this
sounds totally crazy, but...

43
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,280
the world's coming to an end today.

44
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,486
Have you got a screw loose?

45
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,245
When did you last sleep?

46
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,123
Are you even listening?

47
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,325
The...

48
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,246
I haven't got time
for your psycho crap.

49
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,281
I don't know what's going on with you.

50
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,081
But it's not fair to
let Mum down like that.

51
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,843
She doesn't deserve that.

52
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,375
He had to die.

53
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,596
You two are wrong...

54
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,788
in his world.

55
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,375
And in ours.

56
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,675
I know what you're feeling.

57
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,503
But you'll learn to let him go.

58
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,628
Everything will run its course,

59
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,748
just as fate determined...

60
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,600
for our world...

61
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,126
and his.

62
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,475
Why did you lock me up?

63
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:08,288
You promised me there would be
a way to change everything...

64
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,533
so that the apocalypse doesn't happen.

65
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,635
You lied to me just like
my older self lied to me.

66
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,000
Sic Mundus.

67
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,788
Old Tannhaus.

68
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:35,539
He firmly believed he
was creating a paradise,

69
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,041
where we would all be
free from our destiny...

70
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,728
and free of pain.

71
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,875
A world beyond your world and my world.

72
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,241
But I...

73
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,826
have finally realised
what paradise really is.

74
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,039
Eternal darkness,

75
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,241
in which nothing exists.

76
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,175
But for that...

77
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,100
the apocalypse must happen.

78
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,666
In my world...

79
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,871
and in yours.

80
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,623
Jonas!

81
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:17,706
Jonas!

82
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,628
Let me out! Jonas!

83
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:30,613
6 HOURS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

84
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,039
<i>Where are the barrels?</i>

85
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,206
<i>I want you to wait.</i>

86
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,123
I don't care about that.

87
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,539
You do what I say, Obendorf.

88
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:41,771
Got it?

89
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,420
Dad? Is everything okay?

90
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:54,581
I know I said I'd stay home
today, but something came up.

91
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,813
I'm sorry.

92
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,628
It's all right.

93
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,550
I have to tell you something.

94
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,445
Someone is blackmailing me.

95
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,498
What?

96
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,385
With something...

97
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,665
that happened a very long time ago.

98
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:39,331
MURDER IN MARBURG STILL
UNSOLVED 33 YEARS LATER

99
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,713
Sometimes we make decisions in
our lives that we can never undo.

100
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,953
My name isn't Aleksander.

101
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,383
It's Boris.

102
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,430
Boris Niewald.

103
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:02,164
But it was an accident.
You have to believe me.

104
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,289
I am not a murderer.

105
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,731
What about Mum?

106
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,838
Did Mum know about this?

107
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,125
Your mother is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

108
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,460
She saved me from all that.

109
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,428
And I never even told her the truth.

110
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,381
Bartosz.

111
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:35,923
I'm sorry.

112
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,864
Charlotte.

113
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,036
May I come in for a second?

114
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,333
Thanks.

115
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,898
I need to speak to Ulrich. Is he here?

116
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,506
No. He's still in the shower.

117
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,543
Could I maybe wait? It's important.

118
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,388
How are you?

119
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,939
Okay.

120
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,631
And at home? Is everything fine?

121
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,516
Now you listen to me...

122
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,708
Ulrich belongs to me.

123
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,655
And that's not going to change.

124
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,463
Charlotte.

125
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,631
- What are you doing here?
- I just wanted to show you something.

126
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,681
Drop by with Peter sometime.

127
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:07,155
We can all go out
together. While I still can.

128
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,911
- Are you done in the bathroom?
- Of course.

129
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,373
- What are you doing here?
- Your cell was off.

130
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,705
Don't ever do this again.
Never come here uninvited.

131
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,373
The microscopic examinations
of the two pennies are in.

132
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,375
And...

133
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,500
And?

134
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,776
And what?

135
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,956
WINDEN POLICE EVIDENCE

136
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,518
This is the penny I found in the bunker.

137
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,831
And this is the penny Helge had on him.

138
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,101
At first I thought it must be a mistake,

139
00:16:01,103 --> 00:16:03,565
that the photos were
labelled incorrectly.

140
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,414
But this here,

141
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,016
this little groove.

142
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,540
It is exactly identical.

143
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,748
I don't know how, but
it's one and the same coin.

144
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,960
But this one here, Helge has
had it as long as I've known him.

145
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,426
I know it makes no sense at all,

146
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,228
but...

147
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,116
But?

148
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,160
It's as if the penny...

149
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,670
had somehow travelled through time.

150
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,996
- Where's Helge now?
- Still in pre-trial custody.

151
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,375
Ulrich!

152
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,383
Oh, you startled me.

153
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,475
Where were you?

154
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,766
Did you cut your hair?

155
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,038
What happened?

156
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,256
Do you believe in fate?

157
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,060
I don't know.

158
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,658
No.

159
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,871
I believe we take our
lives into our own hands.

160
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,835
That we decide which path we take.

161
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,451
I know I...

162
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,706
I'm probably the last person
you want to talk to, but...

163
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,850
if you do want to...

164
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,700
I'm here.

165
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,391
Your dad and I...

166
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,220
A lot of things may be different now...

167
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,905
but that doesn't
necessarily mean it's bad.

168
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,850
No, it doesn't.

169
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,008
Are you going somewhere?

170
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,391
I promised someone I'd
take care of something.

171
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:39,706
WINDEN NUCLEAR POWER PLANT

172
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,998
GOD PARTICLE

173
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,490
FOLLOW THE SIGNAL

174
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,375
Stop!

175
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,253
Jonas.

176
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,628
You're alive.

177
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:35,015
I killed him.

178
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,825
Why is he still alive in his world?

179
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,535
The switch point...

180
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,918
at the junction in the loop of time.

181
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,414
<i>The moment</i>

182
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:06,456
<i>that allows things to run in
one direction or the other.</i>

183
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,260
<i>You bring him to our world,</i>

184
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,370
or you don't.

185
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:20,455
A line that meets
itself again in a loop.

186
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,433
<i>Two possible paths:</i>

187
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:27,045
<i>along the outer edge of the line,</i>

188
00:23:27,047 --> 00:23:29,531
<i>or along the inner edge of the line.</i>

189
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,978
<i>And yet it is the same line.</i>

190
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:37,126
<i>Two overlapping realities.</i>

191
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,425
On one of these paths, he dies.

192
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:47,613
On the other, he doesn't.

193
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:53,456
Both possibilities recur in the loop

194
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,788
again and again.

195
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:59,251
One triggers the other.

196
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:05,543
Quantum entanglement.

197
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:14,078
Adam has tried to sever this
entanglement for the past 33 years,

198
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:17,206
so what is growing inside you

199
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,998
will never come to be.

200
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,628
But it is impossible.

201
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:27,906
Our worlds

202
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:31,116
cannot be separated from one another.

203
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:35,288
Every step Jonas takes is guided by us.

204
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,748
He cannot escape his fate.

205
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:44,576
What is this?

206
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:49,483
This was left over...

207
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:52,638
after the catastrophe.

208
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:57,828
The God Particle.

209
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:04,206
And this here?

210
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:05,638
What is this?

211
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,998
I've seen what it will become,

212
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,580
in the future.

213
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:18,581
There's no way back now. The cave
collapsed. There's nothing left.

214
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,581
The passage no longer exists.

215
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:22,664
But this here...

216
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:25,373
if I find out how it
works, I can go back.

217
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:27,835
Then I can save them. Martha and Mikkel.

218
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:30,061
I can save them all.

219
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,310
How did you even find me?

220
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:43,776
How did you know I was here?

221
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:48,236
The device.

222
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:52,125
- The matter it needs...
- The device. Do you still have it?

223
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,550
Where is it?

224
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:11,976
It doesn't work.

225
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:16,055
Maybe it all had to
happen this way first,

226
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:19,455
for things to change next time.

227
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,480
The substance in the device,

228
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,848
you and I brought it
into the passage again.

229
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:31,978
We changed the variables
of the equation.

230
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:36,675
- Maybe it will work next time.
- I don't have time to wait 33 years!

231
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:41,535
Am I supposed to lie to myself again
to have things happen the same way?

232
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:44,311
But this time I'll be on the
other side of the bunker door?

233
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:54,536
Why didn't she say anything?

234
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:56,385
Your older self.

235
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:01,071
She knew Martha would die.

236
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:03,978
How she'd die.

237
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:09,933
Why should I trust you?

238
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:15,768
The matter in the nuclear power plant.

239
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,676
I know what it is.

240
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,250
I can help you save Martha,

241
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:29,205
to save them all.

242
00:27:31,541 --> 00:27:36,291
3 HOURS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

243
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,630
Bartosz?

244
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:58,173
Martha?

245
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,150
Can I come in?

246
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:04,788
Yes.

247
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:11,414
33 years ago, there was an
accident at the nuclear power plant.

248
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:15,616
Somehow the accident caused
some strange substance to form.

249
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:19,543
And your father helped
cover everything up.

250
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:26,056
The whole time, that stuff
has been in the caves.

251
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:28,886
It's all connected.

252
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,675
The substance...

253
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:34,528
it triggers it.

254
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:36,539
Today.

255
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:38,206
We have to talk to him.

256
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:39,708
Triggers what?

257
00:28:42,791 --> 00:28:44,381
The apocalypse.

258
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:51,373
POLICE

259
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:53,225
IDENTITY UNKNOWN

260
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:58,043
The time of death must have been
just before the body was found.

261
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:15,289
Is it possible that he's
been dead for a long time?

262
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:17,801
That his body had
been preserved somehow?

263
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:20,164
Preserved?

264
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:22,236
What do you mean "preserved"?

265
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:36,064
Everything okay?

266
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:37,996
The scar on his chin...

267
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:45,375
Ulrich?

268
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:15,121
The boy in the bunker.

269
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:17,633
You said you killed him.

270
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:21,581
But you didn't mean him.

271
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:23,273
You meant Mads.

272
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:27,773
The boy from the bunker
looks just like Mads.

273
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:31,081
How can that be?

274
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:34,253
She... she said I had to do it.

275
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,233
Who?

276
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:40,289
Do what?

277
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:42,623
Send him to the future.

278
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:44,375
To fill the gaps.

279
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:01,865
The pennies.

280
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:04,983
What does this mean?

281
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,670
- I have to stop him.
- Stop who?

282
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:15,475
Stop who?

283
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:22,003
You.

284
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:46,285
You can go.

285
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,963
<i>And this Jonas guy is dead now?</i>

286
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:18,523
And you killed him.

287
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:22,431
Well, not you, but...

288
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:24,963
some other you?

289
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:28,385
I was there.

290
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:30,675
In the future.

291
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,580
Nothing's left.

292
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:38,491
Nothing.

293
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:42,456
It all has something
to do with your father.

294
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:44,938
He can't be allowed to open the barrels.

295
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:51,753
Bartosz.

296
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:54,915
Please.

297
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,291
Charlotte, it's Aleksander.

298
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,920
I...

299
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:54,386
can you come to the nuclear power plant?

300
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:57,593
I want to show you something.

301
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:09,961
Come on out!

302
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:12,681
Adam's waiting for you.

303
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:31,415
Stop.

304
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:42,933
Take it off!

305
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,460
- What?
- Your clothing.

306
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:47,858
Take it all off.

307
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:59,466
Why are you doing as he says?

308
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:03,539
We, the chosen few, must fill the gaps.

309
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:06,351
So you can find your
way here, and Adam his...

310
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,266
and we'll finally find salvation.

311
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:20,326
We have waited a long
time for this moment.

312
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:28,626
You know what to do.

313
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:54,498
1 HOUR UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

314
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,000
What do you think it means?

315
00:36:57,875 --> 00:37:00,164
The birds? The light?

316
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:02,056
The boy in the bunker?

317
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:05,328
Martha is losing it.

318
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:10,211
She thinks the apocalypse
will happen today.

319
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:27,705
If we die today, then together.

320
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:32,435
Together.

321
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:56,161
What's this about?

322
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:02,365
It's better if you see it yourself.

323
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,540
Tick, tock.

324
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:11,831
Tick, tock.

325
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:17,331
Tick...

326
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:18,423
tock.

327
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:35,623
Charlotte, it's me. Listen,
the stuff with the pennies...

328
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:37,301
I know it sounds crazy,

329
00:38:37,303 --> 00:38:40,331
but the same thing happened
with the body in the bunker.

330
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:42,206
Have them run a DNA test.

331
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:44,164
I don't know how, but...

332
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:46,039
the boy in the bunker,

333
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:48,501
he's my brother. It's Mads.

334
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:51,661
Call me back when you get this.

335
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:19,023
Who are you?

336
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:23,883
Can't you guess?

337
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:33,458
Magnus?

338
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,081
You're from the future.

339
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,603
But not from yours.

340
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:50,768
What's going on?

341
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:53,456
They lied to you.

342
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:55,238
Your older selves.

343
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:58,285
They don't want to
prevent the apocalypse.

344
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:02,581
They're the ones who are
responsible for it happening.

345
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,539
But there is a way to change everything.

346
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:08,881
But you have to choose our world...

347
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:11,128
and trust him;

348
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:13,625
Jonas.

349
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:17,481
Jonas is alive?

350
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,805
In our world.

351
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:24,455
And he knows where the origin is.

352
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:30,748
But before that, you must save Jonas
from the apocalypse in his world,

353
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,990
and bring him into your world.

354
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,030
You're all out of your minds.

355
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:40,001
You can't stop what's
happening here, but...

356
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:43,289
if you come with us,

357
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:45,414
you can prevent it...

358
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:47,016
another time.

359
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:51,596
What is that?

360
00:41:05,541 --> 00:41:08,631
Martha, what's this all about?

361
00:41:12,916 --> 00:41:14,246
Martha?

362
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:19,498
You have to come with us.

363
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,920
- Come where?
- He doesn't belong with us.

364
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:25,413
He belongs with the others.

365
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:30,501
They will save him.

366
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,080
I'm sorry.

367
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,245
Martha, wait!

368
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:56,423
<i>It's time.</i>

369
00:41:57,291 --> 00:42:01,331
<i>Adam has moved each of
his pieces into position.</i>

370
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:05,289
It's time

371
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:07,161
that we do the same.

372
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:14,414
This knot has given us all life,

373
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:16,876
and we are its keepers.

374
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:19,773
In both worlds.

375
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,841
He'll never be able

376
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:27,351
to untie the knot.

377
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:30,748
In all these years, he hasn't understood

378
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,080
how everything is really connected.

379
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:36,463
How everything ends and begins.

380
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:39,633
Not only in our world,

381
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,330
but also in his.

382
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:45,331
We are...

383
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:47,626
destiny.

384
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:51,706
We build the walls...

385
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:53,623
of this labyrinth.

386
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:55,831
Each of us shapes the paths

387
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:57,673
and extends their hand.

388
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:05,914
Bartosz, you must save
yourself to save our lives.

389
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:11,664
Claudia, you must guide yourself
to be our eyes in Adam's world.

390
00:43:11,666 --> 00:43:17,786
Egon, you must create your past
to preserve the family tree.

391
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:19,581
Noah...

392
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,290
you bring love

393
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:26,423
to make everything new.

394
00:43:29,125 --> 00:43:31,956
Every darkness is followed by light.

395
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:35,038
With every death comes a life.

396
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:03,423
You brought me into your world.

397
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:07,998
You promised me I could change it.

398
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,670
Why are you doing this?

399
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:20,308
Where are the others?

400
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,235
Where did you send them?

401
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:27,411
They are all fulfilling their destinies.

402
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:30,164
Magnus and Franziska.

403
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:32,498
Charlotte and Elisabeth.

404
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,130
Silja and Agnes.

405
00:44:35,375 --> 00:44:38,373
They're perpetuating the cycle,

406
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:41,075
so that you and I can be here now.

407
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:45,175
What's that supposed to mean?

408
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:50,128
That we've come to the end.

409
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:54,343
What's growing inside you,

410
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,645
the origin,

411
00:44:57,583 --> 00:44:59,213
must die.

412
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:03,583
But it can't be killed by normal means.

413
00:45:04,541 --> 00:45:07,081
It's born of both worlds,

414
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:11,081
and the energy of both
worlds is necessary

415
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,773
to destroy it.

416
00:45:13,666 --> 00:45:15,946
The apocalypse in my world,

417
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:19,243
and the apocalypse in your world.

418
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:23,456
This here is the end.

419
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:29,246
A machine that not only
crosses time, but also space.

420
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:33,213
It focuses the energy
of both apocalypses

421
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:36,881
onto this one point.

422
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:41,175
Your son only exists

423
00:45:41,916 --> 00:45:44,331
because the matter exists.

424
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:48,039
And now he will die through the
matter, and all of us with him.

425
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:49,921
None of this...

426
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:52,398
will exist anymore.

427
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:56,831
Both worlds will extinguish one another.

428
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:01,205
Absolute annihilation.

429
00:46:03,958 --> 00:46:05,458
You're insane.

430
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:19,768
There is no hope.

431
00:46:20,625 --> 00:46:22,095
No salvation.

432
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:24,461
No paradise.

433
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:35,170
We're wrong,

434
00:46:36,291 --> 00:46:37,731
you and I...

435
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:42,583
in your world

436
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:44,958
and in mine.

00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:54,298
Jonas!

439
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,623
Jonas, please don't do it.

440
00:46:56,625 --> 00:46:57,745
Jonas!

441
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:00,458
Jonas!

442
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:02,380
Jonas!

443
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:05,956
Don't. Jonas, please!

444
00:47:05,958 --> 00:47:06,958
Jonas!

445
00:47:09,958 --> 00:47:11,158
Jonas, please!

446
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,126
No!

447
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:28,165
Jonas!

448
00:47:34,666 --> 00:47:36,876
No, no!
