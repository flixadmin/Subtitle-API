The King in the North!
The King in the North!

The King in the North!
The King in the North!

Here comes...
( all cheering )

18
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,713
- ( men chuckle )
- Hmm.

19
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,257
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

20
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,676
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

21
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,470
What are you doing?

22
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,263
I have a list.

23
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,432
A list of people
you mean to kill?

24
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,767
For laughing at me?

25
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,644
Do I look like
Joffrey to you?

26
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,604
No, death seems
a bit extreme.

27
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,773
Fear of death,
on the other hand...

28
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,441
You should learn
to ignore them.

29
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,610
My lady, people have
been laughing at me

30
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,612
far longer than they've
been laughing at you.

31
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,447
I'm the Halfman,

32
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,449
the Demon Monkey,
the Imp.

33
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,034
You're a Lannister.

34
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:06,663
I am the disgraced daughter
of the traitor Ned Stark.

35
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,332
The disgraced daughter
and the Demon Monkey.

36
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,876
- We're perfect
for each other.
- ( chuckles )

37
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,006
So how should
we punish them?

38
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,591
Who? Whom?

39
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,803
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

40
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,304
Ah.

41
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,599
I could speak to Lord Varys
and learn their perversions.

42
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:30,311
Anyone named
Desmond Crakehall
must be a pervert.

43
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,730
I hear that
you're a pervert.

44
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:33,982
I am the Imp.

45
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,817
I have certain standards
to maintain.

46
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,695
( chuckles )

47
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,281
We could sheep shift
Lord Desmond's bed.

48
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,075
You cut a little hole
in his mattress

49
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,868
and you stuff
sheep dung inside.

50
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,663
Then you sew up the hole
and make his bed again.

51
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,791
His room will stink,
but he won't know where
it's coming from.

52
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,334
Lady Sansa!

53
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,712
My sister used to do that
when she was angry with me.

54
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,506
And she was always
angry with me.

55
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,508
Why sheep<i> shift?</i>

56
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:04,012
That's the vulgar word
for dung.

57
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,930
My lady...

58
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,348
Well, you asked me.

59
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,891
Women:
Oh! ( giggle )

60
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,518
That's him!

61
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,354
My lord, my lady.

62
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,690
Your father has called
a meeting of the small council.

63
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,734
<i>( door closes )</i>

64
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,284
Killed a few
puppies today?

65
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,202
Show him.

66
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,288
Come on, show him.

67
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,545
Oh, apologies, my lord.

68
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,589
Old fingers.

69
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:50,391
"Roslin caught
a fine fat trout.

70
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:54,687
<i>Her brothers gave her</i>
<i>a pair of wolf pelts</i>
<i>for her wedding.</i>

71
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,648
<i>Signed Walder Frey."</i>

72
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,152
Is that bad poetry

73
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,404
or is it supposed
to mean something?

74
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,073
Robb Stark is dead.

75
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:08,743
<i>( laughing )</i>
<i>And his bitch mother.</i>

76
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,287
Write back to Lord Frey.

77
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,040
<i>Thank him for his service</i>
<i>and command him</i>

78
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,584
to send Robb Stark's head.

79
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:19,921
I'm going
to serve it to Sansa
at my wedding feast.

80
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:23,633
Your Grace, Lady Sansa
is your aunt by marriage.

81
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,885
A joke.
Joffrey did not mean it.

82
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,553
Yes, I did.

83
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,807
I'm going to have it served
to Sansa at my wedding feast.

84
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,225
Tyrion:
<i>No.</i>

85
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,894
She is no longer
yours to torment.

86
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,189
Everyone is mine
to torment.

87
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,819
You'd do well
to remember that,
you little monster.

88
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,445
Oh, I'm a monster.

89
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:48,282
Perhaps you should speak
to me more softly, then.

90
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,618
<i>Monsters are dangerous</i>

91
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:54,705
and just now kings
are dying like flies.

92
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,298
I could have
your tongue out

93
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,758
<i>for saying that.</i>

94
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,594
Let him make his threats.

95
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,639
Hmm? He's a bitter
little man.

96
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,892
Lord Tyrion should
apologize immediately.

97
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:18,020
Unacceptable,
disrespectful,

98
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,273
<i>and in very bad taste.</i>

99
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,984
I am the king!

100
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,652
I will punish you.

101
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:27,155
Any man who must say,
"I am the king"

102
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,657
is no true king.

103
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,576
I'll make sure
you understand that

104
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,286
when I've won
your war for you.

105
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,830
My father won
the real war.

106
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,000
He killed Prince Rhaegar.
He took the crown

107
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:42,003
while you hid
under Casterly Rock!

108
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,601
The king is tired.

109
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,853
See him to his chambers.

110
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,980
- Come along.
- I'm not tired.

111
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,566
We have so much
to celebrate.

112
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,819
A wedding to plan.
You must rest.

113
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,657
Grand Maester,
perhaps some essence
of nightshade

114
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,285
to help him sleep.

115
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:17,705
I'm not tired!

116
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,250
Come.

117
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,522
Not you.

118
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,823
You just sent the most
powerful man in Westeros

119
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,034
to bed without his supper.

120
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:58,871
You're a fool if you
believe he's the most
powerful man in Westeros.

121
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,916
A treasonous statement.
Joffrey is king.

122
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:05,044
You really think a crown
gives you power?

123
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,589
No.

124
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,342
I think armies
give you power.

125
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,262
- Mm-hmm.
- Robb Stark had one,

126
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,138
never lost a battle,

127
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,474
and you defeated him
all the same.

128
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:21,644
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I know.

129
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,647
Walder Frey
gets all the credit.

130
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,565
Or the blame,
I suppose,

131
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,359
depending on
your allegiance.

132
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,862
<i>Walder Frey</i>
<i>is many things,</i>

133
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,823
but a brave man?

134
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,116
No.

135
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,619
He never would have
risked such an action

136
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,163
if he didn't have
certain assurances.

137
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,874
Which he got from me.

138
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,668
Do you disapprove?

139
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,795
<i>I'm all for cheating.</i>
<i>This is war.</i>

140
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,006
But to slaughter them
at a wedding...

141
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,717
Explain to me
why it is more noble

142
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,885
to kill 10,000 men
in battle

143
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,304
than a dozen at dinner.

144
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,389
So that's why you did it?

145
00:09:58,472 --> 00:09:59,807
To save lives?

146
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,810
To end the war.
To protect the family.

147
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,855
<i>Do you want to write a song</i>
<i>for the dead Starks?</i>

148
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,566
Go ahead, write one.

149
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:12,320
<i>I'm in this world</i>
<i>a little while longer</i>

150
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:16,073
to defend the Lannisters,
to defend my blood.

151
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,784
The northerners
will never forget.

152
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,161
Good.

153
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,787
Let them remember
what happens

154
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,457
when they march
on the south.

155
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,003
All the Stark men
are dead.

156
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,672
Winterfell is a ruin.

157
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,593
Roose Bolton will be named
Warden of the North

158
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:40,806
until your son by Sansa
comes of age.

159
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:47,313
I believe you
still have some work
to do on that score.

160
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:51,525
Do you think she'll open
her legs for me

161
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,029
after I tell her how
we murdered her mother
and brother?

162
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,699
One way or another,
you will get that girl
pregnant.

163
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,035
I will not rape her.

164
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:05,581
Shall I explain to you
in one easy lesson
how the world works?

165
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:08,542
Use small words.
I'm not as bright as you.

166
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,587
The house that puts family
first will always defeat

167
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,173
the house that puts
the whims and wishes

168
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,510
<i>of its sons</i>
<i>and daughters first.</i>

169
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,762
A good man does
everything in his power

170
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:23,015
to better
his family's position

171
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,727
regardless of his own
selfish desires.

172
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,732
Does that amuse you?

173
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,485
No, it's a very
good lesson.

174
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:37,988
Only it's easy
for you to preach
utter devotion to family

175
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,616
when you're making
all the decisions.

176
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:42,576
Easy for me, is it?

177
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,746
When have you ever
done something that
wasn't in your interest

178
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,249
but solely for the benefit
of the family?

179
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,335
The day
that you were born.

180
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,550
I wanted to carry you
into the sea

181
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,885
and let the waves
wash you away.

182
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,515
Instead, I let you live.

183
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,436
And I brought you up
as my son.

184
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,191
Because you're a Lannister.

185
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,584
Sansa.

186
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:01,989
It's empty.

187
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,741
Let's find
a place to sleep.

188
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,209
( wind howling )

189
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,628
( echoing )
Hodor.

190
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,339
Hodor.

191
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,133
Don't, Hodor.

192
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,181
Maybe we shouldn't
stay here.

193
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,683
You'd rather
be out there?

194
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,937
There are a lot of stories
about this place.

195
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,564
Horrible stories.

196
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,691
I always quite liked
the horrible stories.

197
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,110
So did I.

198
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,029
Once.

199
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,242
You ever heard
about the Rat Cook?

200
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,452
No.
Who's he?

201
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,705
Just a cook
in the Night's Watch.

202
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,166
He was angry at the king
for something,

203
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,960
I don't remember.

204
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,712
When the king was visiting
the Nightfort,

205
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,465
the cook killed
the king's son,

206
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,300
cooked him
into a big pie

207
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:06,720
with onions, carrots,
mushrooms and bacon.

208
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:10,766
That night he served
the pie to the king.

209
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,727
He liked the taste
of his son so much,

210
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,230
he asked for
a second slice.

211
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:21,235
The gods turned the cook
into a giant white rat

212
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,445
<i>who could only eat</i>
<i>his own young.</i>

213
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,949
<i>He's been roaming</i>
<i>the Nightfort ever since,</i>

214
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,243
<i>devouring his own babies.</i>

215
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,622
But no matter
what he does,

216
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,499
he's always hungry.

217
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,709
( chuckles )

218
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,752
If the gods turned
every killer

219
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,087
into a giant white rat--

220
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,423
It wasn't for murder
the gods cursed the Rat Cook

221
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,717
<i>or for serving</i>
<i>the king's son in a pie.</i>

222
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,219
He killed a guest
beneath his roof.

223
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,221
<i>( distant clatter )</i>

224
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,682
That's something
the gods can't forgive.

225
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,730
<i>( rats squeaking )</i>

226
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,818
"The late Walder Frey,"
old Tully called me

227
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:06,655
because I didn't get
my men to the Trident
in time for battle.

228
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,074
<i>He thought he was witty.</i>

229
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,285
<i>Look at us now, Tully.</i>

230
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,413
<i>You're dead,</i>
<i>your daughter's dead,</i>

231
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,789
your grandson's dead,

232
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:19,084
your son spent
his wedding night
in a dungeon

233
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,004
and I'm Lord
of Riverrun.

234
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,631
( laughs )

235
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,716
The Blackfish escaped.

236
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,470
An old man on the run

237
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,680
<i>with no allies.</i>

238
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,724
I have Tywin Lannister
backing me.

239
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:36,810
- Who does he have?
- As you say.

240
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,687
<i>They all laughed at me,</i>

241
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,522
all those high lords.

242
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,734
They all thought
they were better than me.

243
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,362
Ned Stark,
Hoster Tully.

244
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,698
People snigger
when I marry a young girl,

245
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,327
but who said a word
when Jon Arryn married
the little Tully bitch?

246
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,496
You'll be needing
a new young girl.

247
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,581
Yeah.

248
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,417
Got that
to look forward to.

249
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,087
<i>And you,</i>

250
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,255
the Warden
of the North.

251
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,842
<i>No more Starks</i>
<i>to bow and scrape to.</i>

252
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,344
Must have been torture

253
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,471
following that stupid boy
all over the country.

254
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,724
He ignored my advice
at every turn.

255
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,559
If he'd been a trifle
less arrogant...

256
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,312
Calling himself
the Young Wolf.

257
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,147
How's that for pomposity?

258
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,691
( chuckling )

259
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,860
Well, here's to
the Young Wolf!

260
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,697
- ( howls )
- Forever young.

261
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,615
( laughs )

262
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,742
( laughs )

263
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,080
Will you move to Winterfell
now that the war's over?

264
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,708
At some point perhaps.

265
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,835
But Winterfell's in ruins.

266
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,796
Yeah.

267
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,506
What happened up there?

268
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,634
I heard the Greyjoy boy
seized the place.

269
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,137
I heard he killed
all the ravens.

270
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,723
And after that, nothing.

271
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,475
I sent my bastard Ramsay
to root him out.

272
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,271
Robb Stark offered
amnesty for the ironborn

273
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,189
if they gave us Theon.

274
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,108
Oh. And?

275
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,568
<i>Ramsay delivered</i>
<i>the terms.</i>

276
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:11,739
The ironborn turned on Theon
as we knew they would.

277
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:15,075
<i>They handed him over</i>
<i>trussed and hooded.</i>

278
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:19,079
<i>But Ramsay-- well...</i>

279
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,582
<i>Ramsay has his own way</i>
<i>of doing things.</i>

280
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,585
Well, the girls
weren't lying.

281
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,712
You had
a good-sized cock.

282
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,805
What?

283
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,432
No.

284
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,853
Pork sausage.

285
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,564
You think I'm some
sort of savage?

286
00:17:56,617 --> 00:18:00,245
People talk about
phantom limbs.

287
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,665
<i>An amputee might have an itch</i>
<i>where his foot used to be.</i>

288
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,335
<i>So I've always wondered...</i>

289
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,674
do eunuchs
have a phantom cock?

290
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,804
<i>Next time you think</i>
<i>about naked girls,</i>

291
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,431
would you feel an itch?

292
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,358
Sorry.

293
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,194
I shouldn't make jokes.

294
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,698
My mother taught me not
to throw stones at cripples.

295
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,664
But my father taught me
to aim for their head.

296
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,833
( quietly )
Kill me.

297
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,876
Sorry, what?

298
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,046
Kill me.

299
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,216
A little louder.

300
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,469
( sobbing )
Kill me!

301
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,348
You're no good
to me dead.

302
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,809
We need you.

303
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:27,332
You don't look like
a Theon Greyjoy anymore.

304
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,794
That's a name
for a lord.

305
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,047
But you're not a lord,

306
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,341
are you?

307
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,219
You're just meat.

308
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,637
( groans )

309
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:44,766
Stinking meat.

310
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,602
( sniffs )

311
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,105
You reek.

312
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:52,774
( gasps )
Reek!

313
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,277
That's a good name
for you.

314
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,906
What's your name?

315
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,366
Theon Greyjoy.

316
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,582
What's your name?

317
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,294
Th--

318
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,671
Theon Greyjoy.

319
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,216
( groans )

320
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:22,930
Please.

321
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:28,143
What is your name?!

322
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,146
Reek.

323
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,943
My name is...

324
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,863
Reek.

325
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,376
( wind howling )

326
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,051
-<i> ( distant gasp )</i>
<i>- ( gasps )</i>

327
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:09,351
- Hodor.
-<i> ( gasping continues )</i>

328
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,524
<i>( gasping continues )</i>

329
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,361

330
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:23,532
<i>( scraping,</i>
<i>footsteps approaching )</i>

331
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,621

00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,007
( panting )

335
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,508
- Don't kill me!
- Who are you?

336
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,511
- Sam! Sam!
- Who are you?!

337
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,431
Gilly.
Don't hurt us.

338
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,057
Where are you going?

339
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,436
To Castle Black.
I'm a brother of
the Night's Watch.

340
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,896
- My brother,
he's in the Night's--
- Shush.

341
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,732
- Who's your brother?
- Doesn't matter.

342
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,943
<i>( Summer growling )</i>

343
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,201
You're Jon's brother.

344
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,287
<i>The one who fell</i>
<i>from the window.</i>

345
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,247
No, I'm not.

346
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:16,877
I've been around Ghost
enough to know a direwolf
when I see one.

347
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,212
And I've heard
all about Hodor.

348
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,173
Hodor.

349
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:26,053
I'd be dead
if it wasn't for Jon.

350
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,138
If you're his brother,
you're my brother, too.

351
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,640
And anything I can do
to help you, I will.

352
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,060
Take us north
of the Wall.

353
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,608
What?

354
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,610
Why in the world
would you want to go--

355
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,361
I don't want to.
I have to.

356
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,447
How did you get
through the Wall?

357
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,825
Does the well lead
to an underground river?
Is that how you came here?

358
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,952
Come with us.

359
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,956
There are steps carved
into the south side
of the Wall.

360
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,708
Hodor can carry you
to the top.

361
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,460
We'll walk straight
to Castle Black.

362
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:02,255
Come with us.
There's nothing
north but death.

363
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,674
Sam:
<i>If Jon is alive,</i>

364
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,384
<i>then Castle Black's</i>
<i>where he'll be.</i>

365
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,261
It's the safest place
for you.

366
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,889
There's nowhere
safe any longer.
You know that.

367
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:14,518
What I know
is what I saw.

368
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,520
And if you saw it, too,
you'd run the other way.

369
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:19,856
You saw the white walkers
and the army of the dead.

370
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,526
How do you know
all that?

371
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,861
The Night's Watch
can't stop them.

372
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:28,782
The kings of Westeros
and all their armies
can't stop them.

373
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,499
<i>( baby fussing )</i>

374
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,918
But you're going
to stop them?

375
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,712
Please, Sam.

376
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,714
<i>I have to go north.</i>

377
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,260
I have to.

378
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,180
<i>( seabirds screeching )</i>

379
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,683
<i>( distant waves crashing )</i>

380
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,374
"Balon Greyjoy,
Lord of the Iron Islands

381
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,668
and invader of the North.

382
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,670
I give you
until the full moon

383
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:26,756
to order all ironborn scum
out of the North

384
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,926
<i>and back to those</i>
<i>shit-stained rocks</i>

385
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,053
<i>you call a home.</i>

386
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,973
<i>On the first night</i>
<i>of the full moon,</i>

387
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:37,601
<i>I will hunt down</i>
<i>every islander</i>

388
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:42,063
still in our lands
and flay them living

389
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,775
the way I flayed
the 20 ironborn scum

390
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,444
I found at Winterfell.

391
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:51,114
<i>In the box you'll find</i>
<i>a special gift--</i>

392
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,202
Theon's favorite toy.

393
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:58,663
He cried when I took it
away from him.

394
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,021
Leave the North now
or more boxes will follow

395
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:25,774
with more Theon.

396
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,817
Signed Ramsay Snow,

397
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,569
natural-born son
of Roose Bolton,

398
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,656
Lord of the Dreadfort
and Warden of the North."

399
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,911
Get that
out of my sight.

400
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,254
Theon disobeyed
my orders.

401
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,051
The boy is a fool.

402
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:58,515
He cannot further
the Greyjoy line.

403
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:03,436
I will not give up
the lands I have seized,

404
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,689
the strongholds
I have taken.

405
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,440
Get this away from me.

406
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,818
He's your son.

407
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,570
Son?

408
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,615
He's not
a man anymore.

409
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,117
He's your son.

410
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,745
He's my brother.

411
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:21,830
He's a Greyjoy.

412
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,124
Watch yourself.

413
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,751
I've made
my decision.

414
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,800
And I've made mine.

415
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:39,556
I'm going to pick
the fastest ship
in our fleet.

416
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:45,353
<i>I'm going to choose</i>
<i>the 50 best killers</i>
<i>on the Iron Islands.</i>

417
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,731
Man:
Get those ropes!

418
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,649
Yara:
<i>I'm going to sail</i>
<i>up the Narrow Sea</i>

419
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,943
<i>all the way</i>
<i>to the Weeping Water.</i>

420
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:56,531
<i>I'm going to march</i>
<i>on the Dreadfort.</i>

421
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:59,284
<i>I'm going to find</i>
<i>my little brother</i>

422
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,537
<i>and I'm going</i>
<i>to bring him home.</i>

423
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,711
What is it?

424
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,087
Dragonglass.

425
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,964
We found them
at the Fist.

426
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:16,676
Someone buried them
a long time ago.

427
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,636
Someone wanted us
to find them.

428
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,640
Why?
What are they for?

429
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,646
Killing white walkers.

430
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,190
How do you know that?

431
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,859
Gilly:
<i>The walker came</i>
<i>for my baby.</i>

432
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,195
And Sam...

433
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:38,573
But no one's killed
a white walker in
thousands of years.

434
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:42,702
Well, I suppose someone
had to be the first.

435
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,871
Take it, Hodor.

436
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,546
And the archer.

437
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,596
I got lucky

438
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,681
with one of them.

439
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,517
There are more.

440
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,978
<i>Many more.</i>

441
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,689
And for every one of them,

442
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,025
the dead men,

443
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,152
more than you
could count.

444
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,658
I wish you'd come
with us.

445
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:24,411
I wish I could.

446
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,997
I really do.

447
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:18,131
How are you keeping?

448
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,924
Great.

449
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,468
Never better.

450
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,887
It was just
a bit of blood.

451
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,639
I should have known.

452
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,142
Every time a highborn
asks my name, it's trouble.

453
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,187
We're not really people
to you, are we?

454
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,022
Just a million different ways
to get what you want.

455
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,816
- I'm not a highborn.
- She called you Ser.

456
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,818
I heard it.

457
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,490
A recent state
of affairs.

458
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:50,330
I was born in Flea Bottom
just like you.

459
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,499
Sure, you were.

460
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,250
You're my friend.
You're here to help.

461
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,252
I lived below
the Street of Flour.

462
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,545
<i>How far below?</i>

463
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,006
How close
to the Red Keep
were you?

464
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,551
The shit that poured
from their privy pipes

465
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:07,472
<i>flowed down the side</i>
<i>of Aegon's Hill</i>

466
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:11,684
along Tanner's Row
and right in front
of my front door

467
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,853
- on Gin Alley.
- Gin Alley.

468
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,358
The Street of Steel,

469
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:21,569
with your armor
and your knights?
Pfft.

470
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,405
You lived in the fancy
part of town.

471
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:30,870
And here we are now.

472
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:34,707
Two boys from Flea Bottom
in the castle of a king.

473
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,960
Yeah, we've come
a long way.

474
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,421
We're all
the same, really.

475
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,383
She went to great pains
to point that out to me.

476
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,552
If you mistrust
fancy people so much,

477
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:49,055
why were you
in such a hurry
to trust her?

478
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,600
You're me.

479
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,060
Never been with a woman.

480
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,854
<i>Never talked</i>
<i>to a woman, really.</i>

481
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,648
<i>And then she</i>
<i>comes at you--</i>

482
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,651
big words, no clothes.

483
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,236
What would you have done?

484
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:08,783
She does know her way
around a man's head,
I'll give her that.

485
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:10,994
( both chuckle )

486
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,250
So how'd you
become a lord?

487
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,710
Oh, that's a long story.

488
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:22,130
Better not, then.
I'm a bit busy.

489
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,135
Many years ago
I helped King Stannis

490
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,596
out of a difficult
situation.

491
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,099
He rewarded me
with a lordship.

492
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,560
And this.

493
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,606
You see?

494
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,691
Highborns.

495
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,614
I didn't want
to be a lord.

496
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,657
I nearly didn't accept.

497
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,950
Why did you?

498
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,828
I did it for my son.

499
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:56,414
I didn't want him to step
over a river of shit

500
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,125
every time he stepped
through his front door.

501
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,879
I wanted him to have
a better life.

502
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,591
Does he?

503
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,552
He's dead.

504
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,601
How'd he die?

505
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,812
Following me.

506
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,364
-<i> ( seabirds screeching )</i>
<i>- ( bells dinging )</i>

507
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:34,118
When did you come
to this strange country?

508
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,288
When I was 13.

509
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,082
You were only a child.

510
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,669
I stopped being a child
when I was nine.

511
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,838
My mother
made sure of that.

512
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,008
You've been
a good influence

513
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,427
on our mutual friend,
you know.

514
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,554
He used to drink
from sundown to sunup,

515
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,056
visit three brothels
a night,

516
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,517
gamble away
his father's money.

517
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,560
Now it's just
the drinking.

518
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,106
And now
I'm his wife's servant.

519
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,024
I brush her hair
and clip her nails

520
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,693
and empty
her chamber pot.

521
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,027
She is a sweet
young thing.

522
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,612
None of this
is her fault.

523
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,573
I love that girl.
I would kill for her.

524
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,659
Do you think that
makes it easier for me?

525
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,662
No, I expect not.

526
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,459
She's young
and she's beautiful
and highborn.

527
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,211
We break bread
with them,

528
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,714
but that doesn't
make us family.

529
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,298
We've learned
their language,

530
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,009
but we'll never be
their countrymen.

531
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:36,723
If you let yourself believe

532
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,683
that a foreign girl
with no name

533
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,185
could spend her life with
the son of Tywin Lannister--

534
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,063
- I have a name.
- You have one name.

535
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,606
As do I.

536
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,693
Here only the family
name matters.

537
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,987
What do you want
from me, Lord Varys?

538
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,242
Diamonds.

539
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:59,203
I'd tell you to beware
carrying so much wealth,

540
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,456
but you know how
to protect yourself.

541
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,417
Get on one
of those ships.

542
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,086
Sail to Pentos
or Lys or Myr.

543
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,423
You can buy a house
with these diamonds,

544
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,467
a very large house.

545
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,260
Hire servants.

546
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,511
Start a new life,

547
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,139
a good life,
far from here.

548
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,309
The mysterious
foreign beauty.

549
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,269
You'll have suitors
lining up.

550
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:25,605
Why do you
want me to leave?

551
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,149
Tyrion Lannister is one
of the few people alive

552
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,318
who could make this country
a better place.

553
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,069
He has the mind for it,
he has the will,

554
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,738
he has the right
last name.

555
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,573
And you--

556
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:38,951
you are a complication.

557
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,163
I know you love him.

558
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:46,209
And I know
it's true love not bought
by gold and silver.

559
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,795
I'm not asking you
to leave him for money.

560
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,464
I'm asking you to leave

561
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:54,592
because your presence
in the capital

562
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,677
endangers him.

563
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,473
This will never
be your home, my lady.

564
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:04,644
Find a true home
somewhere far from here...

565
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,064
while there's still time.

566
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,818
Lord Varys.

567
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:18,783
If he wants me to leave,
he can tell me himself.

568
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,584
Keep up.

569
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,671
I don't think
I can, my lord.

570
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:35,758
It's not easy
being drunk all the time.

571
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:40,471
Everyone would do it
if it were easy.

572
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,807
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

573
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,934
Leave.

574
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:57,738
So, enjoying
married life?

575
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:05,037
An unhappy wife
is a wine merchant's
best friend.

576
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,582
She doesn't
deserve this.

577
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,958
Deserve?

578
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,752
Be careful with that.

579
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:15,047
Start trying to work out
who deserves what

580
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,550
and before long you'll spend
the rest of your days

581
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,595
weeping for each
and every person
in the world.

582
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:24,390
There's nothing worse
than a late-blooming
philosopher.

583
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,683
( chuckles )

584
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,102
Will you be facing
your marriage to Ser Loras

585
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:31,314
with the same
philosophical spirit?

586
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,773
I won't be marrying
Ser Loras.

587
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,693
I seem to remember
saying something similar

588
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,737
about my own marriage.

589
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,947
You're not me.

590
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,284
You want to make things
better for Sansa?

591
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,911
Give her a child.

592
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,913
So you can tell Father
it was you

593
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:49,081
who finally
talked me into it?

594
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:52,418
So she can have
some happiness
in her life.

595
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,003
You have children.

596
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:57,423
How happy would
you say you are?

597
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,969
Not very.

598
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,432
But if it weren't
for my children,

599
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:09,727
I'd have thrown myself
from the highest window
in the Red Keep.

600
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:14,106
They're the reason
I'm alive.

601
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,233
Even Joffrey?

602
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,236
Even Joffrey.

603
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,201
He was all I had once.

604
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,954
Before Myrcella was born.

605
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,960
I used to spend hours

606
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,504
looking at him.

607
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,547
His wisps of hair.

608
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,301
His tiny little
hands and feet.

609
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,972
He was such
a jolly little fellow.

610
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:51,978
You always hear
the terrible ones
were terrible babies.

611
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,897
"We should have known.
Even then we should
have known."

612
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,191
It's nonsense.

613
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:01,696
Whenever he was with me,
he was happy.

614
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,159
And no one can take that
away from me,

615
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,828
not even Joffrey--

616
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,664
how it feels
to have someone.

617
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,209
Someone of your own.

618
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,596
How long
does it go on?

619
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:32,685
Until we've dealt
with all our enemies.

620
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:36,689
Every time we deal
with an enemy,

621
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,733
we create two more.

622
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:43,487
Then I suppose
it will go on for
quite a long time.

623
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,657
-<i> ( man laughing )</i>
<i>- ( man #2 wailing )</i>

624
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,617
<i>( both laughing )</i>

625
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:51,037
I'm telling you,
that's what she did.

626
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,456
- ( wailing )
- ( soldiers laughing )

627
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:56,417
<i>Sounded like</i>
<i>a cow in heat.</i>

628
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,711
- Aye, not for long.
- That's right.

629
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,963
Black Walder
shut her up
right quick.

630
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,883
<i>None of the Starks</i>
<i>had much to say about</i>
<i>the end of that meal.</i>

631
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,676
I'll tell you what,
though.

632
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,263
The hardest thing
was getting that wolf's
head to stay on the body.

633
00:39:09,346 --> 00:39:11,557
- You sewed it on?
- I did.

634
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,935
I bet there were 1,000 men
claiming they were the one.

635
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,562
It was me.

636
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:19,398
And Malcolm
and Talbott.

637
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:22,234
Well, the thing was so heavy,
it fell off the first time.

638
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,903
Took the skin
right with it.

639
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,947
<i>What we ended up having to do</i>
<i>was hook the needle</i>

640
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,449
<i>right under</i>
<i>the collarbone.</i>

641
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,744
Give it a nice
firm mooring and--

642
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,998
What do you want?

643
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:39,418
- Mind if I keep warm?
- Fuck off.

644
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,420
But I'm hungry.

645
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:45,216
Does fuck off mean
something different
where you're from?

646
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,551
I've got money.

647
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,474
What kind of coin
is that?

648
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,476
It's worth a lot.

649
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,271
Sorry.

650
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,440
Little shit.

651
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,693
( grunting )

652
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,738
Man:<i> Fool!</i>

653
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,131
Where did you
get the knife?

654
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,924
From you.

655
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,805
Hound:
<i>Is that the first man</i>
<i>you've killed?</i>

656
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,807
The first man.

657
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,769
Next time you're going
to do something like that,

658
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,855
tell me first.

659
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:54,910
( whispers )
Valar morghulis.

660
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:06,380
( winces )

661
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:07,840
<i>( wings flap )</i>

662
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,259
<i>( horse neighs )</i>

663
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,734
Ygritte, you know
I didn't have a choice.

664
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,615
You always knew who I was,

665
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,825
what I am.

666
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,788
I have to go home now.

667
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,418
I know you won't hurt me.

668
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,922
You know nothing,
Jon Snow.

669
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:54,053
I do know some things.

670
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,847
I know I love you.

671
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,936
<i>I know you love me.</i>

672
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:07,524
But I have
to go home now.

673
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,741
( grunts )

674
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,377
( groans )

675
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,093
( groans )

676
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:50,609
I know how
this must look.

677
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,240
- What I meant was--
- I swear to you, my lord--

678
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,534
I'm not a lord, my dear.

679
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:01,412
Not for many, many years.

680
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:04,707
<i>Every man who joins</i>
<i>the Night's Watch</i>

681
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:09,044
renounces
all former titles.

682
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,923
Among other things.

683
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,594
What is your name?

684
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,430
Gilly.

685
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,641
Ah, for the gillyflower.

686
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,310
Lovely.

687
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,603
Yes, my--

688
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:30,232
Maester.

689
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:32,693
Master.

690
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,029
Maester.

691
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,114
And the child?

692
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,534
She hasn't chosen
a name yet.

693
00:43:40,617 --> 00:43:43,078
His name is Sam.

694
00:43:46,623 --> 00:43:48,459
Tarly...

695
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:52,046
do you remember
the oath you swore

696
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,548
when you joined
this order?

697
00:43:54,631 --> 00:43:57,968
He's not my child,
Maester Aemon.

698
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:01,347
She's one
of Craster's wives.

699
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:09,480
I remember every word
of the oath.

700
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,192
Night gathers
and my watch begins.

701
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:17,279
<i>I am the shield that guards</i>
<i>the realms of men.</i>

702
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,867
The realms of men.

703
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:26,538
That means her
as well as us.

704
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,833
We didn't build
500 miles of ice walls

705
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,628
700 feet high
to keep out men.

706
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:36,924
The night is gathering,
Maester Aemon.

707
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,967
I've seen it.

708
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,595
It's coming
for all of us.

709
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:47,393
Gilly, you and your son

710
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,437
will be our guests
for the time being.

711
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:55,442
We certainly cannot
send you back

712
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,444
beyond the Wall.

713
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,905
Thank you...

714
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:02,366
Maester.

715
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,618
I can cook and clean
and I can--

716
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,078
Good.

717
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:10,791
Samwell, fetch a quill
and inkwell.

718
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:18,507
I hope your penmanship
is better than
your swordplay.

719
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,592
( chuckles )
Miles better.

720
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:26,098
We had 44 ravens
at last count.

721
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:29,435
Make sure
they're all fed.

722
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:33,063
Every one of them
flies tonight.

723
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:44,450
"To His Grace

724
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,910
King Stannis Baratheon.

725
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,582
Invaded-- inv--
invit-- invited

726
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:55,419
to the name day
celebration

727
00:45:55,502 --> 00:46:00,632
for Rylene Florent

728
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:03,051
on the first nigit--"

729
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,928
Night.

730
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,306
"First night
of the full moon."

731
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:08,640
Why is there
a G in night?

732
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,642
I don't know.
There just is.

733
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:14,229
Well, your father's
not going to go to that.

734
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,900
My books are better
than these boring scrolls.

735
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,860
You could read about
Balerion the Dread.

736
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:23,655
They say you can still see
his skull in the dungeons
beneath the Red Keep.

737
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,657
I'd like to see
that someday.

738
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:29,286
I've been trying
to stay out of those
dungeons my whole life.

739
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,831
"His fangs were as long
as bastard swords."

740
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,168
Aye, old Balerion's
definitely better

741
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:39,421
than anything your cousin
Rylene's got on offer.

742
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,757
But now that I'm your
father's Hand again,

743
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,092
I have to keep
him informed.

744
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:47,804
The king does not have
time for this drudgery.

745
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,519
"To all the lords
and knobble men of Westeros."

746
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:56,647
- Noblemen.
-<i> "Noblemen of Westeros,</i>

747
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:01,276
the Nig--
the Night's Watch...

748
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:06,323
implores..."

749
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:07,908
What is it?

750
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,827
<i>( bell tolling )</i>

751
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,248
Why are they
ringing the bells?

752
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,208
<i>Are we being attacked?</i>

753
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,752
Stay here.

754
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:20,796
Bar the door.

755
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,567
The usurper
Robb Stark is dead.

756
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,736
Betrayed by his bannerman.

757
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,740
And you take credit
because you dropped
a leech into the fire?

758
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,284
I take no credit.

759
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:53,704
<i>I have faith</i>
<i>and my faith</i>
<i>has been rewarded.</i>

760
00:47:56,498 --> 00:48:00,919
Your Grace, the world
has got so far bent.

761
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,505
I've seen things
crawl out of nightmares,

762
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,382
but my eyes were open.

763
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:08,594
I don't know
if Robb Stark died because
of the Red Woman's sorcery

764
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,596
or because at war
men die all the time,

765
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,890
but I do know that uniting
the Seven Kingdoms

766
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,601
with blood magic is wrong.

767
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:16,768
It is evil.

768
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,854
And you are not
an evil man.

769
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:21,481
Do you know who
had this table carved
and painted, Ser Davos?

770
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:23,984
Aegon Targaryen.

771
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,570
And do you know
how Aegon Targaryen
conquered Westeros?

772
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,614
On the back of his dragon
Balerion the Dread.

773
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:32,451
He had a smaller fleet
than the kings he faced

774
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:35,495
and a smaller army,
but he had three dragons.

775
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,581
Dragons are magic,
Ser Davos.

776
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:41,168
My enemies have made
my kingdom bleed.

777
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:44,963
<i>I will not forget that.</i>

778
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,716
I will not forgive that.

779
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:52,012
I will punish them
with any arms

780
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,305
at my disposal.

781
00:48:53,388 --> 00:48:56,224
You do not need
to burn the boy.

782
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:59,478
<i>If what you say is true,</i>

783
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:02,397
a drop of his blood
killed Robb Stark--

784
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,692
And our king is still
no closer to the Iron Throne.

785
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:11,573
A great gift requires
a great sacrifice.

786
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,676
His name is Gendry.

787
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,260
He's a good lad.

788
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,430
A poor lad
from Flea Bottom

789
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,266
who happens
to be your nephew.

790
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:47,025
What is the life
of one bastard boy
against a kingdom?

791
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,487
Everything.

792
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,615
The boy must die.

793
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:02,833
- What are you doing?
- You're leaving.

794
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,711
Is this some kind
of trick?

795
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:08,714
Yes, but not on you.

796
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:15,220
Aim for that star.
Don't stop.

797
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:17,681
There's bread and water.
Go slow with it.

798
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:19,391
If you finish it off,

799
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:22,519
no matter how
thirsty you get,

800
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,438
don't drink seawater.

801
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,398
I know not
to drink seawater.

802
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:30,277
Row for a full day and night
and you'll reach Rook's Rest.

803
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,071
You'll want to stop there.
Don't. She'll find you.

804
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,489
Where should I go?

805
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:35,907
You must keep the coast
on your left side

806
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,534
until you reach
King's Landing.

807
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:39,411
The gold cloaks
are looking for me.

808
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:41,079
They were looking
for me for 20 years.

809
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:43,081
- Do they know your face?
- No.

810
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,000
I'd worry more
about the Red Woman.

811
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:53,550
The other way.

812
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:59,931
You ever been
in a boat before?

813
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,475
No.

814
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,934
You know how to swim?

815
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,227
No.

816
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,562
Don't fall out.

817
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:08,315
Go on.

818
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,568
Why are you doing this?

819
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:13,945
<i>Because it's right.</i>

820
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,989
And because
I'm a slow learner.

821
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:22,245
When you get to Flea Bottom,
have a bowl of brown for me.

822
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:28,752
Guard:
<i>Horse approaching!</i>

823
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:31,838
Halt! Halt!

824
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,483
Jon! Jon!

825
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,026
<i>Jon, it's us.</i>

826
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:55,654
I don't think
he can see us.

827
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:02,661
Pyp?

828
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:04,663
Sam?

829
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:08,291
Hush, now.
You're home.

830
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:12,879
Carry him inside.
Gently.

831
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:23,014
<i>( vendors shouting )</i>

832
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,559
<i>( chickens clucking )</i>

833
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:40,532
Out of the way.

834
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:42,117
Step aside,
country boy.

835
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,160
People working here.

836
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,416
Cersei.

837
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,937
You don't deny it?

838
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,939
No.

839
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,983
I let him go.

840
00:53:57,067 --> 00:54:00,153
Your mercy
saved the boy's life.

841
00:54:00,236 --> 00:54:02,113
You feel good
about that?

842
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,490
Aye, I do.

843
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:06,034
Melisandre:
<i>You saved one innocent.</i>

844
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:09,829
How many tens of thousands
have you doomed?

845
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:15,460
There has got
to be another way.

846
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:16,711
What other way?!

847
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,505
Tell us about
this other way.

848
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,382
I don't know,
Your Grace.

849
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:23,343
I can't see the future
in the fire.

850
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:29,557
Very well,
Ser Davos Seaworth.

851
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:33,311
I, Stannis
of the House Baratheon,

852
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,563
First of My Name,
Rightful King of the Andals
and the First Men,

853
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,482
- sentence you to die.
- I understand.

854
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:39,943
But since you
haven't yet unnamed
me Hand of the King,

855
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:42,612
it is my duty
to advise you against it.

856
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:45,407
- You're gonna need me.
- Take him away.

857
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:48,576
Why am I gonna need you?

858
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:54,249
My king.

859
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:00,505
Davos:
<i>It's from Maester Aemon</i>
<i>of the Night's Watch.</i>

860
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:02,173
<i>Their Lord Commander</i>
<i>is dead.</i>

861
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:04,926
<i>Took a ranging party north</i>
<i>and never made it back.</i>

862
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,178
One lad did, though.

863
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:09,806
What he saw
beyond the Wall--

864
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:12,559
it's coming
for all of us.

865
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,241
When did you
learn to read?

866
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:29,617
Matthos taught me
before he died

867
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,995
so I could be
of better service to you.

868
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:42,589
This War of Five Kings
means nothing.

869
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:47,677
<i>The true war lies</i>
<i>to the north, my king.</i>

870
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,847
Death marches on the Wall.

871
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:53,600
Only you can stop him.

872
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,393
You can't stop him alone.

873
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:58,229
You need someone to rebuild
your army for you,

874
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,857
someone to convince this lord
and that lord to fight for you,

875
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:03,068
to bring sellswords
and pirates to your side.

876
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,528
I've made my decision.

877
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:09,908
He's right.
You need him.

878
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:12,786
He has a part to play
in the war to come.

879
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:18,625
( chuckling )

880
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:23,963
You see, Ser Davos?

881
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:27,592
You've been saved
by that fire god
you like to mock.

882
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,556
You're in his army now.

883
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:43,691
( dragons chirping )

884
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:58,623
They will come,
Your Grace.

885
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:00,458
When they're ready.

886
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,585
Perhaps they didn't
want to be conquered.

887
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:05,004
You didn't conquer them.

888
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,090
You liberated them.

889
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:10,718
People learn to love
their chains.

890
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:45,003

892
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,657
No.

893
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:54,447
- Mhysa!
- Mhysa!

894
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:57,492
( all shouting )
Mhysa! Mhysa!

895
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,619
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

896
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,664
What does it mean?

897
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:05,667
It is old Ghiscari,
khaleesi.

898
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:08,169
It means "mother."

899
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:11,464
( shouting continues )

900
00:59:11,547 --> 00:59:13,549
<i>( dragons screech )</i>

901
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:16,177
It's all right.

902
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,054
These people
won't hurt me.

903
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:23,268
Mhysa! Mhysa!

904
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:27,939

907
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:09,230
( shouting continues )

908
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:15,111
All:
Mhysa.

909
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:29,250
( chanting )
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

910
