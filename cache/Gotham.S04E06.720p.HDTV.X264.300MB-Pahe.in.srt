1
00:00:00,914 --> 00:00:03,351
- <i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>
- We will bust Penguin one day,

2
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:04,357
I promise you.

3
00:00:04,392 --> 00:00:05,825
Harvey, we cannot let this slide.

4
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,628
You find someone
with the license, they walk.

5
00:00:08,663 --> 00:00:10,963
Ms. Falcone, I need
to know that you are not

6
00:00:10,999 --> 00:00:13,399
on some fool's errand to
rebuild your father's empire.

7
00:00:13,434 --> 00:00:14,934
An example needs to be made.

8
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:16,902
SOFIA: You may think
you have everything,

9
00:00:16,938 --> 00:00:18,971
but there is one thing you don't have:

10
00:00:19,007 --> 00:00:20,006
the Falcone name.

11
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,007
GORDON: Was that your plan?

12
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:24,310
Get close to Penguin.
Gain his confidence. What then?

13
00:00:24,345 --> 00:00:26,746
NYGMA: I used to be smart, brilliant,

14
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:27,880
and now that's gone.

15
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,051
MAN: Never seen nothing like him before.

16
00:00:32,086 --> 00:00:33,219
(roaring)

17
00:00:33,254 --> 00:00:34,754
Who are you?

18
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:37,123
MAN (on recording): Solomon Grundy.

19
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:40,393
You... know... Grundy?

20
00:00:40,428 --> 00:00:42,194
We're the very best of friends.

21
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,398
NYGMA: With your muscles,
we can make money.

22
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:48,200
- We'd like to put our hat in the ring.
- Go get the doc.

23
00:00:50,872 --> 00:00:53,506
(indistinct shouting)

24
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,940
MAN: Come on!

25
00:00:54,976 --> 00:00:58,644
(grunting)

26
00:01:00,615 --> 00:01:04,083
(indistinct, overlapping shouting)

27
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:06,452
(audience groaning)

28
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,822
Hey!

29
00:01:09,857 --> 00:01:11,857
(audience cheering)

30
00:01:15,196 --> 00:01:16,562
(bones crack, man grunts)

31
00:01:16,597 --> 00:01:17,997
Good as new.

32
00:01:25,406 --> 00:01:27,340
Dr. Lee Thompkins.

33
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:30,776
Oh... my. (laughing)

34
00:01:30,812 --> 00:01:33,512
Now, what is a girl like you
doing in a place like this?

35
00:01:33,548 --> 00:01:35,181
I heard a rumor you were frozen.

36
00:01:35,216 --> 00:01:37,283
Should've known
it was too good to be true.

37
00:01:37,318 --> 00:01:39,485
Oh, you're not still mad at me, are you?

38
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,821
Mad at you for what?

39
00:01:41,856 --> 00:01:43,456
Killing Kristen Kringle?

40
00:01:43,491 --> 00:01:46,135
Or framing Jim for murder
so he would be in prison

41
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,627
when I lost our child? No.

42
00:01:48,663 --> 00:01:50,930
I'm over all that.

43
00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:53,332
Let's be friends.

44
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:55,768
I'm sensing sarcasm.

45
00:01:55,803 --> 00:01:57,536
(pours drink) Just as sharp as ever.

46
00:01:57,572 --> 00:01:59,872
Actually, funny that you mention that.

47
00:01:59,907 --> 00:02:00,940
Good-bye, Ed.

48
00:02:00,975 --> 00:02:02,675
- Wait.
- (groans)

49
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:04,777
Holy hell.

50
00:02:04,812 --> 00:02:07,513
Butch Gilzean?

51
00:02:07,548 --> 00:02:09,548
What have you done to him?

52
00:02:09,584 --> 00:02:11,150
Nothing, believe it or not.

53
00:02:11,185 --> 00:02:12,852
And he goes by "Grundy" now.

54
00:02:12,887 --> 00:02:14,954
Hey, why don't you hang
over there, big fella?

55
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:16,622
Make sure that wall doesn't wander off.

56
00:02:16,657 --> 00:02:18,691
(growls): Mm.

57
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:23,796
I have no idea what happened to him,

58
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:25,965
but he's freakishly strong,

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,367
can't remember anything
about his past life,

60
00:02:28,403 --> 00:02:31,129
and he seems to love me,
so, big improvement.

61
00:02:31,168 --> 00:02:33,005
But, I, on the other hand...

62
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,509
I'm, uh... I'm really hoping
to get back to who I was.

63
00:02:36,544 --> 00:02:40,379
When I was on ice, my head
got a little... scrambled.

64
00:02:40,415 --> 00:02:41,747
Why should I care?

65
00:02:41,783 --> 00:02:43,749
Okay, I came here with Grundy,

66
00:02:43,785 --> 00:02:46,318
gonna fight, make some money
to get me smart again.

67
00:02:46,354 --> 00:02:50,222
But... you...

68
00:02:50,258 --> 00:02:52,658
Dr. Leslie Thompkins...

69
00:02:52,693 --> 00:02:54,560
you can fix me.

70
00:02:54,595 --> 00:02:58,397
You want me to fix you?

71
00:02:58,433 --> 00:03:00,566
Oh, you really are dumb.

72
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:01,867
Okay, okay.

73
00:03:01,903 --> 00:03:03,769
You're here for some reason.

74
00:03:03,805 --> 00:03:06,539
I don't pretend
to know what that is, but...

75
00:03:06,574 --> 00:03:08,541
if you help me,

76
00:03:08,576 --> 00:03:11,110
I will help you.

77
00:03:11,145 --> 00:03:12,945
I know you're not
really smart right now,

78
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,347
so just try to understand this.

79
00:03:15,383 --> 00:03:17,383
I will never help you.

80
00:03:22,723 --> 00:03:25,124
- I was raised to be a gentleman.
- (thunder rumbles)

81
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,492
SOFIA: But you're also practical.

82
00:03:26,527 --> 00:03:29,762
We were seen at dinner, as we
have been the past three nights.

83
00:03:29,797 --> 00:03:33,132
All of Gotham knows you have the
support of the Falcone family.

84
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:36,702
And I'm fairly certain
no one's watching us now.

85
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,138
I...

86
00:03:39,173 --> 00:03:40,840
(thunder rumbles)

87
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:44,677
I just... I just like
to know where I stand.

88
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,083
This isn't easy for me.

89
00:03:52,553 --> 00:03:55,387
To have someone I can trust.

90
00:03:56,691 --> 00:03:58,891
A real friend.

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

92
00:04:07,668 --> 00:04:10,469
You can trust me.

93
00:04:11,506 --> 00:04:13,806
Let's have lunch tomorrow, just us.

94
00:04:15,643 --> 00:04:17,643
Till then.

95
00:04:22,149 --> 00:04:24,583
(door opens, rain falling)

96
00:04:24,619 --> 00:04:26,619
(door closes)

97
00:04:32,793 --> 00:04:34,660
Have a nice dinner?

98
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:38,030
How long have you been here?

99
00:04:38,065 --> 00:04:39,398
Long enough.

100
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:41,567
It's time you tell me
what you're planning.

101
00:04:41,602 --> 00:04:43,302
This again?

102
00:04:44,304 --> 00:04:45,804
Ever since you've come to Gotham,

103
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,207
all you've done is make Oswald stronger.

104
00:04:48,242 --> 00:04:50,042
- (drink pouring)
- It's time I know your end game.

105
00:04:51,846 --> 00:04:53,779
And if I refuse?

106
00:04:54,524 --> 00:04:56,682
I'll put you on a train home.

107
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:06,792
I want to make you a promise.

108
00:05:06,827 --> 00:05:08,060
In a matter of days,

109
00:05:08,095 --> 00:05:10,529
I'll have Cobblepot
in the palm of my hand.

110
00:05:11,732 --> 00:05:14,433
If I fail, I'll stay, I'll go,

111
00:05:14,812 --> 00:05:17,069
whatever you want.

112
00:05:24,445 --> 00:05:27,346
(distant sirens, rolling thunder)

113
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:31,984
Look, the count's good.

114
00:05:32,213 --> 00:05:34,086
Oh, now, go on. Get out of here.

115
00:05:34,221 --> 00:05:36,021
- I'll see you next month.
- Yeah.

116
00:05:43,397 --> 00:05:46,065
(growling)

117
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,100
Someone down there?

118
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:57,643
(low, rolling thunder)

119
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:22,468
(door creaks open)

120
00:06:22,503 --> 00:06:24,770
(mewing)

121
00:06:24,805 --> 00:06:26,749
(chuckles)

122
00:06:26,774 --> 00:06:28,407
Freakin' cats.

123
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:30,442
(mewing)

124
00:06:31,445 --> 00:06:33,112
MALE VOICE: Oink. Oink.

125
00:06:33,147 --> 00:06:34,747
What the...?

126
00:06:35,734 --> 00:06:40,735

127
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:43,756
(indistinct radio chatter, siren blaring)

128
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,124
Hey.

129
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:47,059
It really one of ours?

130
00:06:47,094 --> 00:06:49,428
Seems so. He was in the uniform,

131
00:06:49,463 --> 00:06:51,096
but the killer took his badge.

132
00:06:51,132 --> 00:06:53,065
No one recognizes him?

133
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,901
Well, that part
we have not figured out yet.

134
00:06:57,071 --> 00:06:59,071
Let me show you.

135
00:06:59,106 --> 00:07:01,507
(camera snapping)

136
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:02,808
Good God.

137
00:07:02,843 --> 00:07:04,443
Freaky, huh?

138
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:06,245
Let's find out who this guy is.

139
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,814
(distant siren blaring)

140
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:10,849
Here we go.

141
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:17,823
Dave Metzger. You know him?

142
00:07:17,858 --> 00:07:19,358
Seen him around.

143
00:07:19,393 --> 00:07:22,294
Not to speak ill of the dead,
but he was a grade A bastard.

144
00:07:22,563 --> 00:07:25,297
- He have enemies on the force?
- No. No cop would do this

145
00:07:25,332 --> 00:07:27,633
to another cop, but he was the candyman.

146
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:30,436
Penguin's bagman. He was
the one delivering

147
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:32,004
payoffs to cops in the precinct.

148
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,106
- I mean, that-that's the rumor.
- Yeah.

149
00:07:34,546 --> 00:07:36,513
So someone killed him to send a message.

150
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:38,177
(helicopter passing overhead)

151
00:07:38,212 --> 00:07:40,179
- Where you going?
- To see Penguin.

152
00:07:40,214 --> 00:07:43,382
Maybe he knows why someone
wanted to kill his employee.

153
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:45,818
Don't go stirring the pot!

154
00:07:46,854 --> 00:07:49,054
Enjoy your lunch, Mr. Cobblepot.

155
00:07:50,558 --> 00:07:52,558
I need to talk to you.

156
00:07:52,593 --> 00:07:55,461
If it takes less than three
minutes, I'm all ears.

157
00:07:55,496 --> 00:07:57,329
A cop was murdered last night.

158
00:07:57,364 --> 00:07:59,198
Dave Metzger?

159
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:01,840
A bagman on your payroll.

160
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:03,836
Oh, and you think I
might know something.

161
00:08:03,871 --> 00:08:07,072
Well, sadly, this is the
first I'm hearing his name.

162
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:09,842
A general does not need
to know every foot soldier.

163
00:08:09,877 --> 00:08:11,910
You don't need to know him.

164
00:08:11,946 --> 00:08:14,313
I think someone is trying
to send you a message.

165
00:08:15,344 --> 00:08:17,351
What sort of message?

166
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:22,054
The killer placed a severed
pig's head over Metzger's own.

167
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:24,256
Not a very clear message.

168
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:26,825
Could have all sorts of meanings.

169
00:08:26,861 --> 00:08:29,228
Metzger may have been dirty,
but he was still a cop.

170
00:08:29,263 --> 00:08:32,231
Someone killed him and is using
his death to make a point.

171
00:08:32,266 --> 00:08:34,566
If that is in relation
to you, I need to know.

172
00:08:34,602 --> 00:08:35,581
(laughs)

173
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,036
Jim, if someone had a problem with me,

174
00:08:38,072 --> 00:08:41,073
I would know about it,
and I would deal with it.

175
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,911
I guess you're always
one step ahead, Oswald.

176
00:08:45,946 --> 00:08:48,981
It's why I'm alive.

177
00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:50,949
But I would like to help.

178
00:08:50,977 --> 00:08:53,344
- Mr. Penn!
- Right here, Mr. Cobblepot.

179
00:08:53,387 --> 00:08:56,221
Do we have anything that
could assist Detective Gordon

180
00:08:56,257 --> 00:08:57,756
in doing his job?

181
00:08:57,792 --> 00:09:00,359
As a matter of fact, sir,
a few days ago,

182
00:09:00,394 --> 00:09:03,629
Mr. Wally Clarke applied
for a burglary permit.

183
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:06,365
The Pork Barrel.

184
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:09,101
It's a butcher on Third Street.

185
00:09:09,136 --> 00:09:10,302
They specialize in offering

186
00:09:10,337 --> 00:09:12,271
- the whole...
- Thanks... for the lead.

187
00:09:12,306 --> 00:09:13,972
Enjoy your lunch, Oswald.

188
00:09:14,008 --> 00:09:15,941
- (sniffs)
- Don't thank me, Jim.

189
00:09:15,976 --> 00:09:18,671
Thank the licensing
system you hate so much.

190
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:24,082
Now, be sure to let me know if
I need to get more involved.

191
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:27,873
Till then, I'm rooting for you, Jim!

192
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:31,824
(opera plays with man singing
in foreign language)

193
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:35,894
(man sings along with recording)

194
00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:41,433
(singing continues)

195
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,620
(man on recording holding final note)

196
00:10:01,655 --> 00:10:03,440
(man on recording laughs)

197
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,536
Ah, have a seat, Wally.

198
00:10:10,646 --> 00:10:13,122
You know how much trouble you're in? Huh?

199
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:14,884
You know what we do to cop killers?

200
00:10:14,939 --> 00:10:16,869
- Just told him, I didn't kill nobody,
- (handcuffs tighten)

201
00:10:16,923 --> 00:10:18,674
specifically not no cop.

202
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:21,009
Oh, so you didn't lure
Dave Metzger into that alley,

203
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:23,498
split open his skull,
and stick a pig's head on him?!

204
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:25,836
(laughing): What?! Are you crazy?

205
00:10:25,871 --> 00:10:28,131
It's funny, because we
searched the Dumpster

206
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,513
behind your apartment.

207
00:10:29,538 --> 00:10:31,279
Guess what we found.

208
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:33,210
BULLOCK: Whoa-ho!

209
00:10:33,245 --> 00:10:35,812
Look at that. Porky don't have no head.

210
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,567
GORDON: What do you want to bet

211
00:10:38,661 --> 00:10:42,349
that head was on the dead cop we found?

212
00:10:42,427 --> 00:10:43,921
BULLOCK: Screw it!

213
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:46,290
I have enough.
I don't need a confession.

214
00:10:46,325 --> 00:10:48,926
I'm charging you
with the murder of Dave Metzger!

215
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:51,361
Wait! No. It wasn't me.

216
00:10:52,841 --> 00:10:54,665
It must have been the Prof.

217
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,699
Who?

218
00:10:55,734 --> 00:10:57,367
The Professor. That's what I called him

219
00:10:57,403 --> 00:10:59,303
because he-he talked all fancy.

220
00:10:59,338 --> 00:11:01,238
He was the one who got
me to rob the butcher's.

221
00:11:01,273 --> 00:11:03,206
We need a name, a description.

222
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:04,875
We did it all over the phone.
The whole deal.

223
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,444
I-I dropped the heads under
the Midtown Bridge.

224
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:08,716
The money was there.
I never met the guy,

225
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:09,846
never got no name.

226
00:11:09,882 --> 00:11:12,153
What do you mean, "heads"?
As in more than one?

227
00:11:12,178 --> 00:11:13,517
How many did this guy want?

228
00:11:13,552 --> 00:11:15,118
It was... there was four.

229
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:18,221
You'd think he could've told me
that he only needed the heads.

230
00:11:18,257 --> 00:11:21,091
But, no, I had to drag 'em
to my house, chop the heads...

231
00:11:21,126 --> 00:11:22,592
Hey, shut up!

232
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:26,658
You know what this means?

233
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,132
Yeah. It means there's
three more victims out there.

234
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:31,936
How many bagmen did
Penguin have on the GCPD?

235
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:35,072
Wild guess, I'd say four.
The only one I knew was Metzger.

236
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,147
Yeah, well, the people who
got paid by those bagmen,

237
00:11:38,248 --> 00:11:39,676
they'll know who they are.

238
00:11:39,712 --> 00:11:41,278
They're not gonna talk.

239
00:11:41,313 --> 00:11:42,946
We'll make 'em.

240
00:11:42,982 --> 00:11:45,759
Hey! Don't leave me back
here with this thing!

241
00:11:46,151 --> 00:11:47,584

Looks like I got a new cash cow.

Take good care of him, Doc.

305
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:38,989
And clean up what's left of Hammer.

306
00:14:43,328 --> 00:14:44,694
BULLOCK: We're not looking
to bust nobody.

307
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,610
We just want the name of the bagman.

308
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,547
Who delivers Penguin's money?

309
00:14:48,594 --> 00:14:49,922
Don't know what
you're talking about, man.

310
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:51,601
- Wish I could help.
- Oh, yeah?

311
00:14:51,637 --> 00:14:54,685
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. Relax.

312
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:56,930
I know a couple
of other guys we can talk to

313
00:14:56,982 --> 00:14:58,408
who aren't such douche nozzles.

314
00:14:59,896 --> 00:15:01,229
OFFICER: Seems like
you should be looking

315
00:15:01,264 --> 00:15:02,563
for whoever killed Dave Metzger,

316
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:03,965
instead of shaking down other cops.

317
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,233
We're trying to save other cops.

318
00:15:05,268 --> 00:15:06,901
More lives are on the line here.

319
00:15:06,936 --> 00:15:08,703
Or you're using a cop getting killed

320
00:15:08,738 --> 00:15:10,371
to go on a fishing expedition.

321
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:12,707
(sniffs) Smells like I.A. to me.

Hey. (grunts)

323
00:15:13,943 --> 00:15:15,143
Hold on! Hey, hey!

324
00:15:15,178 --> 00:15:17,345
Just say you're not helping.
We get it, okay?

325
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,679
Get off me.

326
00:15:18,715 --> 00:15:21,416
BULLOCK: We're trying to stop
cops from getting killed.

327
00:15:21,451 --> 00:15:23,618
How can none of you nitwits see that?

328

snitch on another cop.

- Fine.

We'll do it your way.

332
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,353
Yeah, yeah.

Makes deliveries for the West Side.

353

- But don't say I told you.
- Where can we find him?

354

He's supposed to be in court all day.

BULLOCK: My contact
on the South Side said

their bagman's Jenny Butler.
Trying to reach her.

GORDON: Good. I just want
to find this guy Whitlock,

359

Should be getting out of court soon.

You ever think you'd be running around,

trying to save cops
on Penguin's payroll?

362
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:39,335
Bad cops. They deserve to be prosecuted

363
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,466
and stripped of their
badges, not butchered.

(indistinct police radio chatter)

367

Hundred thousand people
in a square mile,

368
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:09,956
and, of course, nobody saw nothing.

369
00:17:10,011 --> 00:17:11,777
Or is willing to admit it.

371
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:14,780
Butler got off duty last night.

Not seen since she clocked out.

373

Whitlock was due in court at 9:00.

374
00:17:19,387 --> 00:17:21,887
Never showed.

375
00:17:21,923 --> 00:17:24,724
So, they were both abducted,
taken somewhere, killed,

376
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:27,059
then brought to pose
in front of this building.

377
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:29,895
- Probably for us to find.
- That's a hell of a lot of work.

378
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:32,064
The killer believes
his message is important.

379
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,433
What, that he's got to rid
the city of dirty cops?

380

00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:09,056
- have him point to a name.
- No need.

494
00:23:09,252 --> 00:23:10,851
Nakajima's the bagman.

495
00:23:10,886 --> 00:23:12,286
How do you know?

496
00:23:12,321 --> 00:23:15,122
Peterson and Messengale are
both hard-core Bible-thumpers.

497
00:23:15,157 --> 00:23:16,757
That leaves three.

498
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:19,093
And I've heard Nakajima's dirty.

499
00:23:19,128 --> 00:23:20,961
Units are already
on the way to his apartment,

500
00:23:20,997 --> 00:23:22,062
same as the others.

501
00:23:22,098 --> 00:23:23,530
I say we retrace his beat.

502
00:23:23,566 --> 00:23:25,933
Concentrate our resources. Jim, hold on.

503
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:31,805
Doesn't something about this
feel weird to you?

504
00:23:31,841 --> 00:23:34,775
Whoever set the trap for
Metzger knew where he'd be.

505
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,878
And the killer also knew Butler
and Whitlock's schedules.

506
00:23:37,913 --> 00:23:39,947
Are you saying it's one of our own?

507
00:23:39,982 --> 00:23:42,549
Someone who's fed up with the
corruption, decided to make a stand.

508
00:23:42,585 --> 00:23:43,751
But to kill them,

509
00:23:43,786 --> 00:23:45,519
- display their bodies that way...
- I know,

510
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:48,455
brother, but it's something
we at least have to consider.

511
00:23:48,491 --> 00:23:51,358
Which means anything that we
say out there... (knocking)

512
00:23:52,379 --> 00:23:55,095
Got a lead on the plumbing van
your blind man saw.

513
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:57,364
Spotted near the abandoned dairy
on Commerce.

514

Should I get the Strike Force?

515
00:23:58,634 --> 00:23:59,833
No, Gordon and I'll cover it.

516
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:01,902
If we need backup, I'll give you a call.

517
00:24:01,937 --> 00:24:04,138
And until then, don't say a word.

If I may? A couple months ago,
I'd gotten word

00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,356
a secret buyer had purchased
the hotel at six percent

Do you have any openings in your building?

You know, Ed, what you should
be doing with your winnings

582
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:41,795
is finding yourself
a neurologist, which I am not.

It has to be you. You know me, Lee.

You know what this coconut's
truly capable of.

Which is why my answer is no.

00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,076

So?

592

that means something to you,

00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:17,898
You and I both see all too well

661
00:32:17,984 --> 00:32:19,450
the corruption,

662
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:20,985
the filth...

663
00:32:21,062 --> 00:32:24,156
inside the GCPD.

664
00:32:24,585 --> 00:32:27,224
You and I know

665
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,623
that Gotham cannot survive

666
00:32:29,662 --> 00:32:31,996
unless the cancer is cut out.

667
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:35,166
We both share the same mission.

668
00:32:35,302 --> 00:32:38,529
Only I do it
with a little bit more flair.

669
00:32:38,871 --> 00:32:41,631
Killing Penguin's bagmen
won't change anything.

670
00:32:41,982 --> 00:32:43,507
But it will for them.

671
00:32:43,756 --> 00:32:45,927
It will quite a bit.

672
00:32:46,879 --> 00:32:49,146
But in the larger scope, you're right.

673
00:32:49,182 --> 00:32:51,015
Which is why...

674
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:53,184
it doesn't stop there.

675
00:32:53,219 --> 00:32:57,655
Not until I've butchered
every single swine

676
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:00,090
on Penguin's payroll.

677
00:33:00,126 --> 00:33:02,393
That could be half the department.

678
00:33:02,428 --> 00:33:04,395
I never said it would be pretty.

679
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:07,064
Oh, it's the same old story.

680
00:33:07,099 --> 00:33:10,206
No one wants to see
how the sausage is made,

681
00:33:10,236 --> 00:33:12,770
but once it is made... (chomping) Mmm.

682
00:33:12,805 --> 00:33:14,705
Isn't it delicious?

683
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,402
Bite?

684
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:18,367
You're delusional.

685
00:33:18,678 --> 00:33:20,211
You're not doing this for
Gotham, you're doing it

686
00:33:20,246 --> 00:33:22,610
for your own demented reasons.

687
00:33:23,282 --> 00:33:25,115
My reasons...

688
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:28,193
are as real as they come, Jim.

689
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:32,492
I have suffered profound loss

690
00:33:32,826 --> 00:33:36,076
at the hands of
the greedy pigs in power.

691
00:33:36,802 --> 00:33:40,251
Profound.

692
00:33:40,998 --> 00:33:43,026
Then tell me.

693
00:33:43,675 --> 00:33:47,333
Let me help make it
right without all this.

694
00:33:47,365 --> 00:33:48,841
BULLOCK: Jim!

695
00:33:48,866 --> 00:33:50,808
Oops. Got to go.

696
00:33:50,843 --> 00:33:52,276
BULLOCK: Jim, where are you?!

697
00:33:52,311 --> 00:33:53,544
Never you fear, Detective.

698
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:54,745
You and I,

699
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,748
we'll meet anon.

700
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,598
Don't you touch him!

701
00:33:59,785 --> 00:34:01,252
Harvey!

702
00:34:01,287 --> 00:34:02,486
BULLOCK: Jim!

703
00:34:02,521 --> 00:34:04,879
Backup's coming!

704
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:07,124
Harvey!

705
00:34:26,114 --> 00:34:27,780
You heard Gordon, you freak.

706
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:30,171
Backup's on the way.
You got one chance to run.

707
00:34:30,216 --> 00:34:32,483
Lies from a liar.

708
00:34:32,518 --> 00:34:35,019
They would have been here by now.

709
00:34:35,054 --> 00:34:37,688
Besides, we both know, Captain Bullock,

710
00:34:37,857 --> 00:34:40,791
- you deserve this.
- (Gordon screams)

711
00:34:42,962 --> 00:34:44,962
(groans)

712
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,540
GORDON: Harvey!

713
00:34:49,502 --> 00:34:51,935
Ooh, I do hate to cut and run.

714
00:34:51,971 --> 00:34:53,837
(Bullock grunts)

715
00:34:53,873 --> 00:34:56,552
- Oopsy-daisy.
- Hold on, partner.

716
00:35:02,415 --> 00:35:03,681
(choking)

717
00:35:03,754 --> 00:35:06,317
Hold on, buddy. Hold on.

718
00:35:06,473 --> 00:35:08,173
You're gonna be all right.

719
00:35:08,287 --> 00:35:10,051
- Jim.
- You're gonna be all right.

720
00:35:10,106 --> 00:35:11,655
- I promise you.
- (approaching sirens wailing)

721
00:35:11,691 --> 00:35:13,390
You're gonna be all right.

722
00:35:13,497 --> 00:35:16,183
Hold on. Hold on, buddy.

723
00:35:16,841 --> 00:35:18,728
- Hold on, pal.
- (sirens wailing)

724
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,926
(coughing)

725
00:35:25,962 --> 00:35:27,533
I can't miss any more work.

726
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:29,230
- They'll fire me.
- It's okay.

727
00:35:29,265 --> 00:35:32,766
I'm gonna put you on
strong antibiotics, okay?

728
00:35:37,807 --> 00:35:39,807
(woman coughs)

729
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,209
Come on.

730
00:35:43,913 --> 00:35:45,913
(baby crying)

731
00:35:59,161 --> 00:36:00,394
Oswald.

732
00:36:00,431 --> 00:36:01,996
I didn't know you were coming over.

733
00:36:02,031 --> 00:36:04,265
I thought I'd surprise you.

734
00:36:05,899 --> 00:36:07,721
I'm sorry I had to cancel
our lunch yesterday.

735
00:36:07,746 --> 00:36:09,136
It was unavoidable.

736
00:36:09,171 --> 00:36:10,938
You have to let me make it up to you.

737
00:36:10,973 --> 00:36:12,072
How about now?

738
00:36:12,925 --> 00:36:14,722
I was actually on my way out.

739
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:17,581
Oh. Hmm. Where to?

740
00:36:18,781 --> 00:36:20,247
This is going to sound strange,

741
00:36:20,283 --> 00:36:23,350
but I can't tell you.

742
00:36:23,386 --> 00:36:25,920
Not yet. I-I want it to be a surprise.

743
00:36:25,955 --> 00:36:28,556
The thing is...

744
00:36:30,693 --> 00:36:32,426
...cat's out of the bag.

745
00:36:32,461 --> 00:36:34,094
I don't understand.

746
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,930
I know what you're doing!

747
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:38,599
The old Heritage Hotel.

748
00:36:38,634 --> 00:36:40,701
The fortress from which
you're going to attack me.

749
00:36:41,151 --> 00:36:43,470
What? No.

750
00:36:43,506 --> 00:36:46,373
Oh. Oh, so you weren't
pretending to be my friend

751
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:47,808
while building your power base?

752
00:36:47,843 --> 00:36:49,677
(laughing)

753
00:36:49,712 --> 00:36:51,820
I should have known.

754
00:36:51,948 --> 00:36:53,447
But, you know,

755
00:36:53,482 --> 00:36:57,318
your father's blood definitely
runs through your veins.

756
00:36:57,353 --> 00:36:59,053
Luckily, not for long.

757
00:36:59,088 --> 00:37:01,155
Oswald, you're making a mistake.

758
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,823
I'm your friend.

759
00:37:03,859 --> 00:37:05,826
We'll see, won't we?

760
00:37:05,861 --> 00:37:08,562
Now, let's go see what you're building.

761
00:37:08,598 --> 00:37:10,864
I can't wait!

762
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,900
(indistinct chatter)

763
00:37:15,204 --> 00:37:17,805
Barkeep, another grasshopper.

764
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,139
Those won't help.

765
00:37:19,618 --> 00:37:22,309
- All right, give me your money.
- What?

766
00:37:22,345 --> 00:37:23,978
The money you made...
well, that he made...

767
00:37:24,013 --> 00:37:26,013
give it to me.

768
00:37:30,786 --> 00:37:33,287
I don't make any promises,
but I'll see what I can do.

769
00:37:33,322 --> 00:37:34,688
Lee. Lee.

770
00:37:34,724 --> 00:37:36,090
I just got to know.

771
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:38,092
Why did you change your mind?

772
00:37:38,127 --> 00:37:39,660
Is it my charisma?

773
00:37:39,695 --> 00:37:41,095
Close.

774
00:37:41,341 --> 00:37:43,775
You asked what I was doing
in a place like this.

775
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,165
I don't want to be here.

776
00:37:45,201 --> 00:37:46,734
I don't want to be anywhere near Gotham.

777
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:47,935
I left.

778
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,637
But I couldn't stay away

779
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,206
because of the Tetch virus.

780
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:54,583
It hit the Narrows
harder than anywhere else.

781
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,876
So?

782
00:37:55,911 --> 00:37:58,512
So? It was my fault.

783
00:37:58,547 --> 00:38:00,881
Jim tried to stop the
virus and I didn't let him.

784
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:04,685
I was infected, but nonetheless,
I was there.

785
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,754
I don't have a choice.
I have to be here.

786
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:07,955
Wow.

787
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:12,226
If you wanted to
blackmail me, by the way,

788
00:38:12,261 --> 00:38:14,173
what you should have
done was taken advantage

789
00:38:14,198 --> 00:38:15,562
of Grundy being popular,

790
00:38:15,598 --> 00:38:17,131
threatened to take him away,

791
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:19,033
and then Cherry, afraid
of losing her star,

792
00:38:19,068 --> 00:38:21,135
would have forced me to help you.

793
00:38:24,707 --> 00:38:26,240
Come by the clinic tomorrow.

794
00:38:26,275 --> 00:38:27,741
We'll get started.

795
00:38:27,777 --> 00:38:29,697
Hi, pretty lady.

796
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,884
Ed's gonna be smart again.

797
00:38:36,919 --> 00:38:39,832
Ed's gonna be smart?

798
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:42,756
Ed's gonna be very smart.

799
00:38:42,792 --> 00:38:44,491
Hey.

800
00:38:48,764 --> 00:38:50,764
It's okay, Charlie.

801
00:38:52,234 --> 00:38:54,262
Oswald.

802
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,924
I want you to know I forgive you.

803
00:38:58,007 --> 00:39:00,007
(children yelling and laughing)

804
00:39:03,646 --> 00:39:05,396
ZSASZ: Uh, boss.

805
00:39:06,521 --> 00:39:08,082
OSWALD: What is this?

806
00:39:08,248 --> 00:39:09,983
What's happening?

807
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:11,952
(chuckles) Kids.

808
00:39:16,941 --> 00:39:20,060
You started an orphanage?

809
00:39:20,449 --> 00:39:22,196
I wanted to surprise you next week

810
00:39:22,231 --> 00:39:23,664
when everything was finished.

811
00:39:24,846 --> 00:39:26,245
I...

812
00:39:26,302 --> 00:39:29,221
- I...
- WOMAN: Children. Back inside, please!

813
00:39:30,606 --> 00:39:32,172
Oswald, I want you to know

814
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:34,983
I understand the pressure you face.

815
00:39:35,211 --> 00:39:37,711
Your very survival
depends on seeing everyone

816
00:39:37,747 --> 00:39:39,436
as a potential threat.

817
00:39:39,715 --> 00:39:42,975
And I watched my father
bear that weight for years.

818
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,244
I don't want you to end up like him.

819
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:50,324
Sofia, please forgive me.

820
00:39:51,927 --> 00:39:53,666
How can I?

821
00:39:53,896 --> 00:39:55,977
(chuckles) When I've
already forgiven you?

822
00:39:58,367 --> 00:39:59,733
But you do owe me one thing.

823
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:00,901
Anything.

824
00:40:00,936 --> 00:40:03,070
Lunch.

825
00:40:03,105 --> 00:40:05,598
How do you feel about mac and cheese?

826
00:40:06,742 --> 00:40:08,208
I love it.

827
00:40:09,411 --> 00:40:12,346
(train whistle blows)

828
00:40:12,381 --> 00:40:14,381
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

829
00:40:18,128 --> 00:40:20,087
GORDON: Hey.

830
00:40:21,924 --> 00:40:23,753
Hey.

831
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:25,993
(exhaling): You gave me
quite the scare back there.

832
00:40:26,028 --> 00:40:27,652
How are you feeling?

833
00:40:30,237 --> 00:40:32,413
I've had better days.

834
00:40:34,503 --> 00:40:36,436
Doc says you're gonna be okay.

835
00:40:36,472 --> 00:40:38,761
That shows what he knows.

836
00:40:39,341 --> 00:40:40,902
Pyg?

837
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:44,111
Son of a bitch.

838
00:40:44,448 --> 00:40:45,612
He could have killed me,

839
00:40:45,648 --> 00:40:47,347
but he cut me just deep enough

840
00:40:47,383 --> 00:40:49,316
to make you choose to go after him

841
00:40:50,051 --> 00:40:52,145
or save my worthless hide.

842
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:54,121
It wasn't a choice.

843
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,653
Either way, I owe you.

844
00:41:00,763 --> 00:41:02,472
So pay it back now.

845
00:41:03,532 --> 00:41:05,465
Tell me the truth.

846
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:07,634
How long you been taking money
from Penguin?

847
00:41:09,905 --> 00:41:11,913
You knew Metzger was the bagman.

848
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:14,475
You knew Nakajima was dirty.

849
00:41:15,147 --> 00:41:17,978
The Pyg says all this stuff

850
00:41:18,013 --> 00:41:20,280
about you deserving to be killed.

851
00:41:21,617 --> 00:41:23,584
I don't know why I didn't see it before.

852
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:25,563
Maybe I didn't want to.

853
00:41:28,824 --> 00:41:31,132
I just need to know how long.

854
00:41:31,483 --> 00:41:33,026
We talking years?

855
00:41:33,062 --> 00:41:34,294
No.

856
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,960
Just since this license crap started.

857
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,815
The commissioner ordered us to comply.

858
00:41:42,638 --> 00:41:44,504
Then Metzger started showing up

859
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,607
with these envelopes
stuffed full of cash.

860
00:41:48,043 --> 00:41:51,361
I didn't do nothing I
wouldn't have done anyway.

861
00:41:52,759 --> 00:41:54,348
You got to understand, Jim.

862
00:41:54,383 --> 00:41:57,484
The bills I got, the debts I got.

863
00:41:58,259 --> 00:41:59,947
It stops.

864
00:42:01,824 --> 00:42:03,423
It stops now.

865
00:42:09,131 --> 00:42:11,131
(sniffles)

866
00:42:13,102 --> 00:42:15,002
TV REPORTER:
<i>...has the city on high alert.</i>

867
00:42:15,037 --> 00:42:17,304
<i>Gotham finds itself gripped by terror</i>

868
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:19,473
<i>at the hands of a
ritualistic cop killer,</i>

869
00:42:19,508 --> 00:42:21,541
<i>being called Professor Pyg.</i>

870
00:42:21,577 --> 00:42:24,645
<i>He is still at large
after evading the police.</i>

871
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,481
The GCPD are urging people
to remain calm

872
00:42:27,516 --> 00:42:29,616
<i>and to report any suspicious activity</i>

873
00:42:29,652 --> 00:42:32,352
<i>to GCPD's Central Command.</i>

874
00:42:32,388 --> 00:42:34,388
(crickets chirping)

875
00:42:37,459 --> 00:42:39,843
PYG: Two mother pigs

876
00:42:40,162 --> 00:42:41,794
lived in a pen.

877
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:44,566
They each had four piglets.

878
00:42:45,238 --> 00:42:47,238
And that made ten.

879
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:50,657
All the piglets loved to play.

880
00:42:50,806 --> 00:42:56,344
And they rolled and they rolled
in the mud, all day.

881
00:42:56,698 --> 00:42:58,245
At night,

882
00:42:58,346 --> 00:43:00,346
with their mothers,

883
00:43:00,753 --> 00:43:02,753
crawled up in a heap,

884
00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:06,893
they screamed and they screamed

885
00:43:07,065 --> 00:43:10,625
until they went...

886
00:43:11,835 --> 00:43:13,493
to sleep.

887
00:43:14,805 --> 00:43:17,837
And sleep well for tomorrow

888
00:43:18,024 --> 00:43:20,845
the ***.
