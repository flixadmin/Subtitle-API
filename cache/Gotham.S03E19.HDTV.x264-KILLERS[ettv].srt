1
00:00:00,007 --> 00:00:01,085
<i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>

2
00:00:01,109 --> 00:00:03,373
Mario could've lived a normal life.

3
00:00:03,398 --> 00:00:04,464
Jim didn't have to kill him.

4
00:00:04,499 --> 00:00:05,832
James Gordon is one of them.

5
00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:08,765
When I get out of here,
he'll be the first that I judge.

6
00:00:08,804 --> 00:00:09,964
Now the Court's readying a weapon

7
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:12,038
- that could destroy the city.
- It's the virus, I'm sure of it.

8
00:00:12,073 --> 00:00:15,508
I have just discovered
someone has been deceiving me.

9
00:00:15,543 --> 00:00:17,528
I need you to kill him.

10
00:00:17,655 --> 00:00:19,528
You've never left that alley, Bruce.

11
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:23,138
And for you to accept what
I have to teach, you need to.

12
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:24,951
Selina, wait, this city has been judged.

13
00:00:24,986 --> 00:00:27,220
- You need to leave Gotham today.
- And why are you telling me?

14
00:00:27,255 --> 00:00:29,489
- Because I care about you.
- You're not even a real person.

15
00:00:32,727 --> 00:00:33,957
You're awake!

16
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:35,962
Selina, where are you going?

17
00:00:35,997 --> 00:00:37,230
To kill someone.

18
00:00:37,265 --> 00:00:39,399
What is this mysterious Court?

19
00:00:39,434 --> 00:00:42,802
Ed went on television,
and voilà, he disappears.

20
00:00:42,837 --> 00:00:45,238
- Oswald, drop it.
- No can do.

21
00:00:45,263 --> 00:00:47,130
You cannot do this to me.

22
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:50,042
I demand to speak to
the person in charge!

23
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,945
Oswald.

24
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:00,359
You're alive?

25
00:01:20,475 --> 00:01:22,515
How did you survive?

26
00:01:22,772 --> 00:01:24,671
In shooting me, Ed,

27
00:01:25,382 --> 00:01:27,976
you gave me something to live for:

28
00:01:29,584 --> 00:01:31,179
revenge.

29
00:01:31,868 --> 00:01:33,743
Yes...

30
00:01:34,486 --> 00:01:36,018
Unless...

31
00:01:38,726 --> 00:01:39,926
What?!

32
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:41,661
Just making sure you're real.

33
00:01:43,026 --> 00:01:45,731
Wow, you are difficult to kill.

34
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:47,700
More cockroach than penguin.

35
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,070
But don't... you...

36
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:53,670
dare call me "Ed."

37
00:01:54,256 --> 00:01:56,008
I'm...

38
00:01:56,295 --> 00:01:58,280
the Riddler.

39
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:00,980
And I became him when I killed you.

40
00:02:02,217 --> 00:02:04,262
News flash, Ed!

41
00:02:04,486 --> 00:02:06,552
I'm not dead!

42
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:08,426
That's true.

43
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:10,456
For now.

44
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:14,293
I came back from the dead
to kill you, Ed.

45
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,896
And ended up a prisoner yourself.

46
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:20,921
You really think a little steel

47
00:02:20,981 --> 00:02:22,995
and concrete is gonna stop me?

48
00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:24,704
The way I see it,

49
00:02:25,334 --> 00:02:27,521
I have you just where I want you.

50
00:02:27,976 --> 00:02:29,609
Perhaps.

51
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,745
But not for long.

52
00:02:57,338 --> 00:02:58,604
Selina.

53
00:03:00,488 --> 00:03:02,141
How?

54
00:03:02,347 --> 00:03:04,076
I came here to do one thing.

55
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,878
And it ain't answering questions.

56
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:11,317
Strange as it sounds,
I'm glad you're alive.

57
00:03:11,434 --> 00:03:13,598
That is strange.

58
00:03:13,731 --> 00:03:15,786
'Cause you pushed me
out a four-story window!

59
00:03:17,645 --> 00:03:19,887
What choice did I have?

60
00:03:20,014 --> 00:03:21,714
You were gonna tell Alfred about me.

61
00:03:21,796 --> 00:03:23,885
You mean how you're a freak?

62
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,965
How you're just the cheap

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,292
knock-off who kidnapped
the real Bruce Wayne?

64
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:41,013
Selina!

65
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:42,815
Selina, stop!

66
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,720
- Stop!
- He's not Bruce!

67
00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:46,652
- Stop!
- He's not Bruce!

68
00:03:48,089 --> 00:03:50,489
Oh, dear God. Selina! Selina.

69
00:03:50,614 --> 00:03:52,207
She-She attacked me, Alfred.

70
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,193
- She's out of her mind.
- She needs a doctor.

71
00:03:54,228 --> 00:03:56,295
You saw her, she... she was crazy.

72
00:03:56,843 --> 00:03:58,831
Put the iron down, Bruce.

73
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,867
I said put the iron down!

74
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,007
Alfred...

75
00:04:06,403 --> 00:04:07,773
You're cut.

76
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,786
You don't feel a thing, do you?

77
00:04:13,216 --> 00:04:14,402
Do you?

78
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:16,802
Now, I'm gonna ask you nicely,

79
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,576
or I swear to God, you're gonna
feel a whole lot of pain.

80
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:23,356
Where is Bruce?

81
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,183
Bruce is serving
a greater purpose than himself.

82
00:04:28,753 --> 00:04:30,620
As am I.

83
00:04:36,194 --> 00:04:37,803
Last time!

84
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:40,196
Where is Bruce?

85
00:04:49,778 --> 00:04:52,249
You were always kind to me, Alfred.

86
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:55,011
Even when you thought I wasn't Bruce.

87
00:04:57,212 --> 00:04:58,845
Please.

88
00:04:58,987 --> 00:05:00,249
Please.

89
00:05:00,987 --> 00:05:02,585
Just tell me where Bruce is.

90
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:24,201
Welcome home, Bruce.

91
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,775

92
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:48,462
Lee. Lee.

93
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,466
Wake up.

94
00:05:55,473 --> 00:05:56,939
Mario.

95
00:05:57,596 --> 00:05:59,175
Are you okay?

96
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,415
I was having the worst dream.

97
00:06:05,524 --> 00:06:07,724
Really? Tell me about it.

98
00:06:07,852 --> 00:06:11,314
God, there was this virus
that was loose in the city.

99
00:06:11,423 --> 00:06:13,932
It brought out a person's darkness,

100
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:17,807
whatever they had buried inside
and you had it.

101
00:06:18,182 --> 00:06:19,783
Really?

102
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:22,479
And what dark part of me
did it bring to light?

103
00:06:23,653 --> 00:06:26,122
You were jealous of Jim.

104
00:06:26,194 --> 00:06:27,336
Come on.

105
00:06:27,372 --> 00:06:28,989
Me, jealous of Jim Gordon?

106
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:31,641
- I'm sorry. You were.
- But I'm taller than he is.

107
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,241
Hey. What is it?

108
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,319
On our wedding night...

109
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,949
he shot you.

110
00:06:41,073 --> 00:06:43,386
God, it was so real.

111
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:45,441
I lost you.

112
00:06:45,597 --> 00:06:46,956
You didn't lose me.

113
00:06:47,316 --> 00:06:48,825
I'm right here.

114
00:06:49,253 --> 00:06:51,160
Now take your medicine

115
00:06:51,692 --> 00:06:53,075
and then off to bed.

116
00:07:06,913 --> 00:07:09,201
- I'm so sorry.
- I know.

117
00:07:09,765 --> 00:07:11,270
Now drink.

118
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,623
Think about it, Harvey.

119
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,786
The Court's been around
since the last century.

120
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,322
It makes sense they
have secure locations,

121
00:07:30,358 --> 00:07:31,880
safe houses all across the city.

122
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,457
And that's where
they're hiding the virus bomb?

123
00:07:33,482 --> 00:07:34,547
- Makes sense.
- Yeah.

124
00:07:34,572 --> 00:07:36,294
So I dug deeper into Kathryn's holdings.

125
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,028
She owns a tenement building
near Miller Harbor.

126
00:07:39,738 --> 00:07:41,536
But there's a discrepancy

127
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,876
between the square footage
listed in the city records

128
00:07:43,915 --> 00:07:46,439
and the blueprints...
over 2,000 square feet.

129
00:07:46,493 --> 00:07:48,423
You're saying they
got a secret room there.

130
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,775
Okay, but by your logic,

131
00:07:49,829 --> 00:07:51,563
there could be dozens of secret
rooms throughout the city

132
00:07:51,612 --> 00:07:53,679
and the virus bomb could
be in any one of them.

133
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,781
You're in the club now.

134
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,297
This Kathryn broad trusts you.

135
00:07:57,362 --> 00:07:59,514
Why not just wait for her to call?

136
00:07:59,654 --> 00:08:01,687
Because if I can do it
quietly, she'll never know.

137
00:08:01,723 --> 00:08:03,770
And if the bomb is there,
I can end this.

138
00:08:03,795 --> 00:08:06,371
Okay, where in this building
is the secret room?

139
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:08,360
- Lucius says the basement.
- Oh, Lucius says the basement.

140
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:10,160
Then I guess we should
check out the basement.

141
00:08:10,215 --> 00:08:12,364
- What is your issue with him?
- He's smarter than me.

142
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,769
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

143
00:08:17,588 --> 00:08:19,252
How come no one ever hides something

144
00:08:19,315 --> 00:08:21,057
in a place I actually
would like to search?

145
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:23,542
You know, like a brewery
or a strip joint.

146
00:08:23,596 --> 00:08:25,775
- Or a casino.
- Exactly.

147
00:08:26,013 --> 00:08:28,180
All I'm asking for is a little, uh...

148
00:08:28,282 --> 00:08:29,615
consideration.

149
00:08:29,938 --> 00:08:32,165
This is more like it.

150
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,329
What's this?

151
00:08:37,926 --> 00:08:40,199
There's a crease in the wall.
Think it's a door.

152
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:41,426
Let me hit the lights.

153
00:08:41,543 --> 00:08:43,801
Just need to find a way in.

154
00:08:48,257 --> 00:08:49,790
I meant to do that.

155
00:08:56,706 --> 00:08:58,617
Jeez.

156
00:09:00,093 --> 00:09:01,843
I don't see a bomb anywhere.

157
00:09:01,945 --> 00:09:04,271
Yeah. Why would it ever be easy?

158
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,108
What's that?

159
00:09:08,242 --> 00:09:10,411
Looks like an owl.

160
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:14,615
Made out of...

161
00:09:16,276 --> 00:09:18,120
- ...crystal.
- Whoa.

162
00:09:18,393 --> 00:09:20,754
Whoa. It's Gotham.

163
00:09:21,924 --> 00:09:23,057
That must be us.

164
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,992
That lower corner right there.

165
00:09:25,027 --> 00:09:26,227
Yeah.

166
00:09:26,323 --> 00:09:28,073
What do you think the white markers are?

167
00:09:29,296 --> 00:09:32,015
- Secret locations of the Court?
- Makes sense.

168
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:33,934
If so, that could be where the bomb is.

169
00:09:36,824 --> 00:09:39,006
- Holy mother of saints!
- Down!

170
00:09:47,415 --> 00:09:49,360
I see you haven't lost a step, Jim.

171
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:54,345
Can't say the same for Bullock.

172
00:10:01,442 --> 00:10:04,692
Remember I promised you'd
be punished for your crimes?

173
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:07,334
Well, I've come here
to keep that promise.

174
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:15,488
No, I said Gordon. Detective Jim Gordon.

175
00:10:16,426 --> 00:10:17,869
Well, have him call me

176
00:10:17,894 --> 00:10:19,590
the minute he gets this message,
all right, you nancy?

177
00:10:24,144 --> 00:10:26,007
You should see a doctor.

178
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:27,618
Mm-mm.

179
00:10:27,734 --> 00:10:29,773
Fine, whatever. Listen.

180
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:32,746
Think. Can you remember anything else?

181
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:34,681
Only what I already told you, Alfred.

182
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:36,404
The clone came to me.

183
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:39,353
Talking about how Gotham's
gonna be judged

184
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:42,049
and a lot of people are gonna die.

185
00:10:43,182 --> 00:10:45,080
It's the bloody Court of Owls, isn't it?

186
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:47,594
Mm-hmm. I warned you.

187
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:50,697
Warned you what would happen
if you poked the tiger.

188
00:10:50,725 --> 00:10:52,257
What, do you want a medal, dear?

189
00:10:52,343 --> 00:10:54,635
All that matters is they've got Bruce.

190
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,423
- Wait, you think he's still alive?
- My boy is still alive!

191
00:10:58,514 --> 00:11:02,408
And you... you are
gonna help me find him.

192
00:11:04,142 --> 00:11:07,064
- No, I'm not.
- Oh, don't-don't do that.

193
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,883
Then what? You're still angry with Bruce

194
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,185
'cause he never told you
your mom was a wonky con artist?

195
00:11:12,544 --> 00:11:14,348
That boy has been loyal to you;

196
00:11:14,403 --> 00:11:16,458
he's been good; he's been a friend,

197
00:11:16,518 --> 00:11:18,825
and now he's in trouble
you're not gonna lift a finger?!

198
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,581
I don't know what good it'll do me.

199
00:11:24,612 --> 00:11:25,866
You're a disgrace.

200
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:29,069
You're like your mum.

201
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,115
Go on then.

202
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:34,170
Run away.

203
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,842
And don't you ever come back here.

204
00:11:46,364 --> 00:11:48,855
I-I'm good, thanks. I'm good.

205
00:11:49,337 --> 00:11:50,603
Bullock,

206
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:52,901
got a kid who saw Barnes flee the scene.

207
00:11:52,924 --> 00:11:53,992
All right, kid, talk.

208
00:11:54,017 --> 00:11:57,531
I saw some guy in leather,
had an axe attached to his arm,

209
00:11:57,643 --> 00:11:59,199
drove off in some delivery truck.

210
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:01,368
- What kind?
- For chopping stuff.

211
00:12:01,456 --> 00:12:04,404
- What kind of truck?
- Oh, right.

212
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:06,498
Genovese Meats.

213
00:12:06,575 --> 00:12:07,941
Put a BOLO out on that truck.

214
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,910
Barnes has Jim.

215
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,812
He's taken him somewhere.

216
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,637
You're making your blade too thin.

217
00:12:21,888 --> 00:12:24,036
It's gonna snap off
when you try to stab me.

218
00:12:24,465 --> 00:12:27,732
Well, we'll soon find out,
won't we, Edward?

219
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:31,267
I told you not to call me that.

220
00:12:34,469 --> 00:12:36,712
What? Edward?

221
00:12:37,618 --> 00:12:40,376
But that's your name, Edward.

222
00:12:40,922 --> 00:12:44,295
Edward. Edward, Edward, Edward,
Edward, Edward, Edward, Edward...

223
00:12:44,342 --> 00:12:45,274
Enough!

224
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:48,170
You're pathetic, you know that?

225
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,591
At least I'm in here

226
00:12:50,972 --> 00:12:55,092
because I was trying
to figure out who runs Gotham.

227
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,786
You're here because what?

228
00:12:58,137 --> 00:13:00,246
I didn't love you back?

229
00:13:02,934 --> 00:13:04,567
Get over it.

230
00:13:10,966 --> 00:13:14,397
No. You did not love me back,

231
00:13:14,845 --> 00:13:16,564
but that's not why I'm here.

232
00:13:17,052 --> 00:13:20,347
I'm here because you destroyed
the empire I built.

233
00:13:20,795 --> 00:13:23,144
I'm here because you shot me.

234
00:13:23,251 --> 00:13:26,152
And no one does what you did and lives.

235
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,923
Well, good luck exacting revenge
when I'm gone.

236
00:13:30,673 --> 00:13:32,189
Oh, please.

237
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:34,379
Make one move to escape
and I call the guards.

238
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,566
Ah, I assumed as much,

239
00:13:37,995 --> 00:13:40,272
which is why I bribed the guards
to poison your coffee.

240
00:13:43,733 --> 00:13:45,716
- You're lying!
- Yes, I am,

241
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,220
but I did steal a dart

242
00:13:48,303 --> 00:13:49,988
from the guards a couple days ago.

243
00:13:50,024 --> 00:13:52,159
Was planning on using it on them, but...

244
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,027
Ow!

245
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,849
You're gonna have to do
a lot better than that...

246
00:14:03,673 --> 00:14:05,317
Ooh.

247
00:14:07,771 --> 00:14:08,997
Help.

248
00:14:10,427 --> 00:14:12,444
Help. Help.

249
00:14:16,877 --> 00:14:18,050
Hey!

250
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,353
What are you doing? Stop that! Stop!

251
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,556
Okay. Come on, come on.

252
00:14:27,165 --> 00:14:29,040
Stop that.

253
00:14:29,263 --> 00:14:30,562
- Stop it!
- What are you doing?

254
00:14:30,602 --> 00:14:32,498
No, no, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

255
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:43,070
I shall set you free, Bruce,

256
00:14:43,336 --> 00:14:48,615
free from the blinding rage
of your darkest memory.

257
00:14:49,162 --> 00:14:53,061
There is one final step to take.

258
00:14:54,452 --> 00:14:56,555
My parents' murder.

259
00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:00,608
You want to take away
the pain of that night.

260
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:02,171
Yes.

261
00:15:15,202 --> 00:15:17,491
But you must be willing.

262
00:15:18,163 --> 00:15:21,632
I cannot take what you will not give.

263
00:15:26,148 --> 00:15:27,819
My mother's pearls.

264
00:15:28,335 --> 00:15:31,757
Lock them away and be free of the pain.

265
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:34,952
Become strong.

266
00:15:35,605 --> 00:15:38,630
Become the protector Gotham needs.

267
00:15:51,011 --> 00:15:53,011
♪ ♪

268
00:16:07,294 --> 00:16:09,053
I'm sorry.

269
00:16:09,663 --> 00:16:13,881
I want to. I... I just can't. I-I can't.

270
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,264
Then I think it's time...

271
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:19,855
I told you the truth.

272
00:16:31,987 --> 00:16:34,050
You made a fool of me, Jim.

273
00:16:35,815 --> 00:16:37,222
It's a shame.

274
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,818
I had such high hopes.

275
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:45,079
You could've played a pivotal
role in Gotham's future.

276
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:46,498
Listen to me...

277
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:50,123
Don't insult me further by lying.

278
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:55,088
I know you took my key card
to Professor Strange's lab.

279
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:58,174
Odd that Strange said nothing.

280
00:16:59,346 --> 00:17:01,639
He and I will be having words.

281
00:17:02,186 --> 00:17:04,883
Who else have you brought
into your confidence?

282
00:17:04,918 --> 00:17:08,592
- Harvey Bullock, obviously.
- What is this, an exit interview?

283
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:11,418
If you like.

284
00:17:12,254 --> 00:17:14,760
Who else have you spoken to?

285
00:17:16,263 --> 00:17:18,644
Who else have you spoken to?

286
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:20,899
The Court ordered my father murdered.

287
00:17:21,168 --> 00:17:23,774
You drove my uncle to suicide.

288
00:17:24,181 --> 00:17:26,220
You can go to hell.

289
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,392
And what are you now, their lapdog?

290
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:31,543
I know you're a lunatic.

291
00:17:31,578 --> 00:17:33,135
At least you used
to stand for something.

292
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,525
Your attempts to turn Captain
Barnes against me are tiresome.

293
00:17:38,886 --> 00:17:41,286
He was following you not because

294
00:17:41,322 --> 00:17:43,546
I asked him to, but because he knows,

295
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,460
as I do...

296
00:17:45,726 --> 00:17:48,927
that you are an enemy of Gotham.

297
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,618
You Gordons always were stubborn.

298
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:58,937
But I am sad you won't see the end

299
00:17:58,972 --> 00:18:03,898
of our little story,
when the clock stops...

300
00:18:04,828 --> 00:18:07,008
and Gotham falls.

301
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:14,339
Captain.

302
00:18:15,253 --> 00:18:17,058
He's all yours.

303
00:18:23,481 --> 00:18:25,090
Let the record show that the trial

304
00:18:25,115 --> 00:18:27,256
of James Gordon has begun.

305
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:32,422
Nathaniel Barnes
presiding as judge, jury

306
00:18:33,008 --> 00:18:35,164
and executioner.

307
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:44,191
Twinkle, twinkle, pretty doctor,
how I wish I could unlock her.

308
00:18:44,504 --> 00:18:47,167
Here in Arkham, what a wonder.

309
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:50,057
Too bad her husband's six feet under.

310
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,128
Clever.

311
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:57,107
- How is life in the nuthouse?
- Oh, you know, it has its ups and downs.

312
00:18:57,912 --> 00:18:59,351
Forgive me

313
00:18:59,427 --> 00:19:01,022
for saying this, Leslie, dear,

314
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,381
but, uh, you don't look yourself.

315
00:19:04,658 --> 00:19:06,671
Have you been sleeping?

316
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:09,866
Or are you plagued by nightmares?

317
00:19:09,991 --> 00:19:12,057
You want to hear
the funny thing, Jervis?

318
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:14,448
Oh, do tell. I do so love funny things.

319
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:17,541
I never really blamed you
for infecting Mario.

320
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:20,768
I just thought, "Why blame the lunatic?"

321
00:19:21,182 --> 00:19:22,386
So I blamed Jim.

322
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,035
Wise...

323
00:19:24,207 --> 00:19:26,911
though hardly sidesplittingly funny.

324
00:19:27,105 --> 00:19:30,074
Why did you infect him?

325
00:19:30,191 --> 00:19:35,253
Oh, Doctor, is that the question
that's been ruining your sleep?

326
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:37,589
You wanted to hurt Jim.
Why not infect me?

327
00:19:38,024 --> 00:19:40,345
Why make Mario suffer?

328
00:19:41,352 --> 00:19:45,686
Do you remember our tea
party at your lovely home?

329
00:19:46,014 --> 00:19:47,832
When you shot Valerie Vale.

330
00:19:47,868 --> 00:19:49,865
Yes! Good memory.

331
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:54,309
Well, I saw the way that
you looked at James Gordon.

332
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:56,274
You loved him.

333
00:19:57,121 --> 00:20:00,606
And that love doomed Mario.

334
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:03,673
That doesn't make sense.

335
00:20:03,717 --> 00:20:05,215
It makes perfect sense!

336
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,951
Jim Gordon does not deserve love!

337
00:20:06,987 --> 00:20:09,021
Jim Gordon does not get love!

338
00:20:09,514 --> 00:20:11,356
I infect your husband.

339
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,793
You blame Jim.

340
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:18,063
Your love for him becomes hate.

341
00:20:18,671 --> 00:20:23,301
It makes perfect sense.

342
00:20:25,338 --> 00:20:27,122
And it worked.

343
00:20:27,574 --> 00:20:29,724
But you know the funny thing?

344
00:20:30,192 --> 00:20:33,423
There's poor Mario,

345
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,775
cold in the ground...

346
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:40,954
and here you are,
blaming Jim, even blaming me,

347
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:44,782
but guess who's really to blame?

348
00:20:47,461 --> 00:20:49,063
I am.

349
00:20:49,963 --> 00:20:53,162
Now, see, that's funny.

350
00:21:13,202 --> 00:21:16,600
My lockpick was confiscated!

351
00:21:18,147 --> 00:21:22,333
Now we're both stuck in this
unnaturally damp hellhole.

352
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:23,926
I hope you're happy.

353
00:21:23,997 --> 00:21:25,930
Did the guards club you?

354
00:21:26,957 --> 00:21:28,509
You know they did.

355
00:21:28,742 --> 00:21:30,535
Then I'm happy.

356
00:21:33,367 --> 00:21:35,179
Why are our captors
keeping us here, anyway?

357
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:37,107
- Why not simply kill us?
- I don't know.

358
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:42,177
Since my first meeting...
with some woman named Kathryn,

359
00:21:42,247 --> 00:21:44,826
I've had no contact
with upper management.

360
00:21:45,318 --> 00:21:46,231
But...

361
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:48,017
according to the guards' gossip,

362
00:21:48,522 --> 00:21:50,888
Court's planning
some attack on the city.

363
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:53,458
Fine.

364
00:21:57,343 --> 00:21:59,364
You want to kill me, I want to kill you.

365
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:02,890
But being locked in these cages
does neither of us any good.

366
00:22:04,981 --> 00:22:06,865
We have to escape.

367
00:22:08,121 --> 00:22:10,175
There's only one way
that's gonna happen.

368
00:22:11,692 --> 00:22:12,996
We work together.

369
00:22:14,482 --> 00:22:16,443
There have to be rules.

370
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:19,483
- No sabotage.
- Of course.

371
00:22:20,218 --> 00:22:22,251
And no murder on the premises.

372
00:22:22,303 --> 00:22:23,482
Agreed.

373
00:22:23,537 --> 00:22:26,149
Also, there needs to be
a six-hour window, post-escape.

374
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,624
If I get outside
and I'm worrying about you

375
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:29,477
stabbing my neck,
I won't be able to concentrate,

376
00:22:29,555 --> 00:22:30,961
and that's not good.

377
00:22:31,024 --> 00:22:33,723
Agreed, reluctantly.

378
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:37,512
Then we help
each other escape, together,

379
00:22:38,668 --> 00:22:42,270
so that we may be free
to murder each other outside.

380
00:22:47,591 --> 00:22:49,184
Deal.

381
00:22:55,649 --> 00:22:57,641
What are you going to show me?

382
00:22:58,021 --> 00:23:00,360
The truth, Bruce.

383
00:23:02,188 --> 00:23:03,962
My truth.

384
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:26,094
This isn't one of my memories.

385
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,907
It's one of yours.

386
00:23:31,297 --> 00:23:32,620
We had no choice.

387
00:23:32,714 --> 00:23:34,987
The laws are clear. And you were gone.

388
00:23:35,073 --> 00:23:39,370
Thomas and Martha Wayne
were leaders of Gotham.

389
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,363
The city honored them. I honored them.

390
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:43,896
He threatened exposure.

391
00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:46,240
What of their boy, Bruce?

392
00:23:46,477 --> 00:23:48,236
Their son.

393
00:23:49,126 --> 00:23:52,606
- He was not harmed.
- That, at least, is something.

394
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,683
All this time, Bruce,

395
00:23:58,738 --> 00:24:02,116
the Court was never more
than a means to an end,

396
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:05,824
allowing us to maintain order in Gotham.

397
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:08,370
Us?

398
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:11,561
Who are you?

399
00:24:11,639 --> 00:24:15,123
Mm. One thing at a time, Bruce.

400
00:24:15,451 --> 00:24:19,127
The point is, the Court's day is over.

401
00:24:19,346 --> 00:24:22,713
And they must finally
pay for their crimes.

402
00:24:22,892 --> 00:24:24,358
My parents' murder.

403
00:24:24,556 --> 00:24:26,017
Exactly.

404
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,502
This is your chance, Bruce.

405
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:31,822
Will you help me?

406
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:48,363
Things could've gone
so differently, James.

407
00:24:51,747 --> 00:24:54,279
We could've cleaned
this town up together.

408
00:24:55,046 --> 00:24:57,912
But when the moment came,
you stood against me.

409
00:24:57,974 --> 00:25:01,185
You stood against Gotham.
Against justice.

410
00:25:03,037 --> 00:25:05,014
- How do you plead?
- If you're asking

411
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:08,620
did I shoot your crazy ass and
send you to Arkham, then, yeah.

412
00:25:08,918 --> 00:25:10,394
I'm guilty.

413
00:25:11,097 --> 00:25:13,821
The sentence is death by beheading.

414
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,611
To be carried out immediately.

415
00:25:18,206 --> 00:25:19,901
You do know your new masters

416
00:25:19,956 --> 00:25:23,082
are nothing but a pack
of murderers, don't you?

417
00:25:23,745 --> 00:25:26,367
They're gonna unleash the virus
in a mass attack.

418
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:29,556
Infecting both the
innocent and the guilty.

419
00:25:32,587 --> 00:25:36,040
You still think this virus is a curse?

420
00:25:36,775 --> 00:25:38,134
Tell me.

421
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:42,407
What about strength is a curse?

422
00:25:42,786 --> 00:25:46,141
What about clarity is a curse?

423
00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:50,196
You're just like Lee Thompkins.

424
00:25:50,641 --> 00:25:52,368
What are you talking about?

425
00:25:52,448 --> 00:25:56,617
She came to me, just after you
blew her husband away.

426
00:25:56,933 --> 00:25:59,391
She wanted to know
if he would've killed her.

427
00:25:59,477 --> 00:26:02,602
I told her that the virus is a gift.

428
00:26:03,773 --> 00:26:06,174
Just like you, she didn't understand.

429
00:26:06,813 --> 00:26:08,703
If she did come to you,

430
00:26:09,274 --> 00:26:10,875
the only thing she took away

431
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:14,266
is that Mario was totally
and completely insane.

432
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:20,168
Any last requests?

433
00:26:20,723 --> 00:26:22,410
Yes!

434
00:26:22,792 --> 00:26:24,225
My badge.

435
00:26:26,145 --> 00:26:27,654
If I'm gonna die,

436
00:26:27,936 --> 00:26:29,857
I want to die wearing it.

437
00:26:30,147 --> 00:26:31,811
I deserve that.

438
00:26:32,269 --> 00:26:34,236
One soldier to another.

439
00:26:38,178 --> 00:26:40,670
One soldier to another.

440
00:26:52,655 --> 00:26:54,222
Fire in the hole, Captain.

441
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,228
You fool!

442
00:26:59,303 --> 00:27:00,560
James Gordon.

443
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,404
I hereby...

444
00:27:02,457 --> 00:27:04,787
- Don't move!
- Stop right there!

445
00:27:11,722 --> 00:27:14,222
- I got you, buddy.
- He's running!

446
00:27:24,449 --> 00:27:26,215
Alvarez. Any word on Barnes?

447
00:27:26,297 --> 00:27:27,745
Nothing yet.

448
00:27:27,802 --> 00:27:31,071
There's a nutjob running around
in a leather jumpsuit

449
00:27:31,153 --> 00:27:32,405
with an axe for an arm!

450
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,478
Now I know this is Gotham,
but come on, people, do something!

451
00:27:35,681 --> 00:27:36,954
Jim.

452
00:27:37,045 --> 00:27:38,704
I'm heading over to Kathryn's townhouse.

453
00:27:38,922 --> 00:27:41,113
Maybe I can get there
before she realizes I escaped.

454
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:43,142
In case I run into Barnes.

455
00:27:44,719 --> 00:27:45,766
This is Bullock.

456
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,149
What?

457
00:27:47,221 --> 00:27:49,929
Yes. Yes. Thank you.

458
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,445
That was O'Toole.
Strike Force beat you to it.

459
00:27:52,492 --> 00:27:55,561
They're bringing Kathryn in now.
Finally some freaking good news, right?

460
00:27:55,694 --> 00:27:56,976
Gordon!

461
00:27:58,281 --> 00:28:00,594
Where the bloody hell have you been?
I've been trying to call you all day.

462
00:28:00,664 --> 00:28:02,068
Alfred. What's happened?

463
00:28:02,297 --> 00:28:05,234
It's Bruce. He's been abducted.

464
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,903
Oh, why? Why can't anything be easy?

465
00:28:09,442 --> 00:28:12,263
Don't know how,
but he's definitely gone.

466
00:28:12,325 --> 00:28:14,857
And you're not gonna believe this,
but the people responsible

467
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:17,152
are this shadowy organization
that run the whole of Gotham,

468
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:19,324
- they're, they're called...
- The Court of Owls.

469
00:28:22,878 --> 00:28:24,933
We've been investigating the Court

470
00:28:24,972 --> 00:28:27,151
and a woman named
Kathryn Monroe for months now.

471
00:28:27,209 --> 00:28:29,051
Until this morning,
I was working undercover

472
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:30,216
inside the organization.

473
00:28:30,285 --> 00:28:31,439
Did they ever mention Bruce?

474
00:28:31,478 --> 00:28:33,299
Never. Why would they want
to kidnap him?

475
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:36,041
Well, we might've had a, a bit of a,

476
00:28:36,096 --> 00:28:37,737
a run-in early on in the year.

477
00:28:37,772 --> 00:28:40,282
- How long has he been gone?
- I don't know.

478
00:28:40,608 --> 00:28:42,153
Could be several days, several weeks.

479
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,840
Weeks? How can the kid
be missing for weeks?

480
00:28:43,879 --> 00:28:46,178
- That's your one freaking job.
- Don't you think I know that?

481
00:28:46,332 --> 00:28:47,744
They replaced him, all right?

482
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:51,383
With a... with an exact clone,
created in Indian Hill.

483
00:28:51,408 --> 00:28:54,863
H-Hold on a second. Wait, back up,
I-I thought I heard you say "clone."

484
00:28:55,113 --> 00:28:56,922
That's 'cause I did.

485
00:28:58,113 --> 00:28:59,660
I got to sit down.

486
00:28:59,774 --> 00:29:02,027
All right. Let's think
this through. Alfred.

487
00:29:02,094 --> 00:29:03,735
Is there anything
you and Bruce could've done

488
00:29:03,782 --> 00:29:05,465
that would've drawn attention
from the Court?

489
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,902
Well, we did break in
to one of their houses

490
00:29:09,512 --> 00:29:11,885
to try and find something
to give us leverage against the Court,

491
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:16,277
and all we found was this ridiculous...
crystal owl thingamajig

492
00:29:16,317 --> 00:29:19,170
- which I managed to break.
- Crystal owl?

493
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,068
Is there any way it
could be reassembled?

494
00:29:22,078 --> 00:29:24,325
- Why?
- We found another owl this morning.

495
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,692
When you shine a light through it,
a map of Gotham appears.

496
00:29:27,731 --> 00:29:30,606
We think this map indicates the
secret hideouts of the Court.

497
00:29:30,684 --> 00:29:32,287
So Bruce could be in one
of those hideouts, right?

498
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:34,271
So where's your bloody owl?

499
00:29:34,311 --> 00:29:36,990
Uh, well, due to circumstances
totally beyond our control,

500
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,168
the owl went kaboom.

501
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:41,871
But if we could reassemble
the owl that you stole,

502
00:29:41,965 --> 00:29:44,285
maybe we could find Bruce and the bomb.

503
00:29:45,422 --> 00:29:46,793
Do you still have the pieces?

504
00:29:46,848 --> 00:29:48,113
You're having a laugh, ain't you?

505
00:29:48,176 --> 00:29:49,271
After all the bloody trouble

506
00:29:49,296 --> 00:29:50,592
I went through to get it,
of course I do.

507
00:29:50,627 --> 00:29:52,126
Right. I'll be back in a minute.

508
00:29:55,009 --> 00:29:57,330
Help!

509
00:29:57,642 --> 00:29:59,486
Help!

510
00:29:59,511 --> 00:30:00,802
Let me out of here,

511
00:30:00,837 --> 00:30:03,150
- or I kill him! Now!
- Easy.

512
00:30:03,196 --> 00:30:05,234
What are you doing? Open my cell!

513
00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:08,269
Shoot him! What are you waiting for?

514
00:30:08,345 --> 00:30:09,444
Never mind.

515
00:30:14,603 --> 00:30:16,403
Back. Get back.

516
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,061
Wait. Is that Jell-O?

517
00:30:20,131 --> 00:30:22,029
Surprise.

518
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:34,789
Your death scene was quite convincing.

519
00:30:34,971 --> 00:30:38,273
Well. I've had some practice, haven't I?

520
00:30:43,465 --> 00:30:45,308
All right, if you see
anything, let me know, okay?

521
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:46,464
Yeah. You got it.

522
00:30:51,138 --> 00:30:52,716
Detective Gordon.

523
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:56,122
I suppose I really shouldn't
be surprised.

524
00:30:56,216 --> 00:30:57,292
No, you shouldn't.

525
00:30:57,537 --> 00:30:59,049
Put her in the box.

526
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,948
I've seen the map.

527
00:31:02,354 --> 00:31:05,073
I know the Court has secret
locations across the city.

528
00:31:05,557 --> 00:31:07,229
Where are you hiding the bomb?

529
00:31:07,845 --> 00:31:09,541
What bomb?

530
00:31:13,047 --> 00:31:15,752
What does Bruce Wayne
have to do with all of this?

531
00:31:16,037 --> 00:31:18,023
Why did you kidnap him?

532
00:31:18,706 --> 00:31:21,643
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

533
00:31:21,985 --> 00:31:24,260
They're not all powerful, you know.

534
00:31:24,628 --> 00:31:27,628
The Court, they can't keep you safe.

535
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,525
Besides, what are the members gonna think

536
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,597
when they see their leader behind bars?

537
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,980
You think I'm the leader?

538
00:31:36,472 --> 00:31:38,084
All this time,

539
00:31:38,123 --> 00:31:42,280
and you really
don't know anything, do you?

540
00:31:47,277 --> 00:31:49,085
Right.

541
00:31:49,593 --> 00:31:51,367
Here we go.

542
00:31:52,233 --> 00:31:54,108
Wait, this is the owl? What
the hell happened to it?

543
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,842
Jerome Valeska smashed it to bits
when he broke into the Manor, didn't he?

544
00:31:58,061 --> 00:31:59,354
Can you put it back together again?

545
00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:01,022
I can't even do a jigsaw puzzle.

546
00:32:01,057 --> 00:32:03,934
I just smash the pieces
in with my fists till they fit.

547
00:32:04,027 --> 00:32:05,716
But wait a second, we
have, we have a guy here

548
00:32:05,756 --> 00:32:08,329
who makes molds of murder
victims' faces out of clay.

549
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:10,373
- I'll give him a call.
- All right.

550
00:32:10,951 --> 00:32:12,459
Where's Gordon?

551
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:14,662
He's interrogating Kathryn Monroe.

552
00:32:15,238 --> 00:32:17,064
The woman from the Court of Owls?

553
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:18,376
Yeah.

554
00:32:18,441 --> 00:32:20,540
- Right...
- I mean, no! No.

555
00:32:20,595 --> 00:32:23,892
Not the woman from the Court of Owls!
Oh, God, no. Not her.

556
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,384
Right.

557
00:32:25,448 --> 00:32:27,337
Tell me where Bruce Wayne is,

558
00:32:27,391 --> 00:32:28,883
or I guarantee you'll regret it.

559
00:32:28,918 --> 00:32:30,251
Alfred, I've got this.

560
00:32:30,286 --> 00:32:32,344
Good cop, bad cop.

561
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,360
That routine's a bit tired,
isn't it, gentlemen?

562
00:32:36,274 --> 00:32:38,393
Yeah, but I'm not a cop.

563
00:32:38,475 --> 00:32:39,861
Am I?

564
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:44,102
I'm a butler.

565
00:32:50,894 --> 00:32:53,238
Ladies and gentlemen...

566
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,776
Who is this guy?

567
00:32:56,606 --> 00:32:59,014
Court is now in session.

568
00:33:06,326 --> 00:33:08,493
Alfred? Alfred!

569
00:33:08,594 --> 00:33:10,489
- Alfred, that's enough.
- Is he out of his freaking mind?

570
00:33:10,536 --> 00:33:12,747
- It's his play.
- Now, you tell me where Bruce Wayne is,

571
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:15,286
you evil old trout, or I will gut you!

572
00:33:16,135 --> 00:33:18,302
Or maybe I should try the other hand.

573
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,254
Alfred...

574
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:23,843
What the hell's going on?

575
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,619
Damn.

576
00:33:43,661 --> 00:33:45,583
- Easy, easy!
- All right, I'm all right.

577
00:33:45,653 --> 00:33:47,364
Hey, hey, you two, stop it right now.

578
00:33:47,466 --> 00:33:48,762
We got a bigger problem.

579
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:51,001
Barnes is out there.
He tore up the precinct,

580
00:33:51,051 --> 00:33:52,489
used some kind of knockout gas.

581
00:33:52,528 --> 00:33:55,439
I got to get you and her
out of here right now. Let's go!

582
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:57,253
- Take her.
- Get up. Up!

583
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,882
Where is he?

584
00:34:06,018 --> 00:34:07,674
I don't know.

585
00:34:08,354 --> 00:34:09,745
You.

586
00:34:09,845 --> 00:34:11,979
You corrupted this house.

587
00:34:12,088 --> 00:34:14,159
All of you, with your weakness,

588
00:34:14,247 --> 00:34:16,167
your compromise.

589
00:34:16,226 --> 00:34:19,108
This place was a church to me.

590
00:34:19,241 --> 00:34:20,739
All right, that's enough of this.

591
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:23,391
Bullock, you and Alfred take Kathryn
out through the garage.

592
00:34:23,484 --> 00:34:25,151
I'm not leaving you alone with him.

593
00:34:25,285 --> 00:34:28,118
All right, Alfred, you do it.
She's the key to finding Bruce.

594
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:30,412
Captain! Captain!

595
00:34:30,474 --> 00:34:32,185
- Help me!
- Shut up!

596
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:36,025
Barnes, this is your last chance!
Give yourself up.

597
00:34:36,134 --> 00:34:38,025
You dare threaten me?

598
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,673
You destroyed the thing
I care most about.

599
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,025
And for that, the sentence is death.

600
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,893
- I don't think he's giving up.
- Yeah.

601
00:34:52,731 --> 00:34:54,064
Hey Cap...

602
00:35:06,612 --> 00:35:07,765
Captain!

603
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,607
Captain, stop this nonsense
and take me out of here now!

604
00:35:13,752 --> 00:35:14,818
Nonsense?

605
00:35:15,036 --> 00:35:16,646
Nonsense?

606
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:22,795
This is justice.

607
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:24,578
No!

608
00:35:25,898 --> 00:35:27,297
Barnes!

609
00:35:32,345 --> 00:35:33,509
It's fitting, Jim.

610
00:35:34,649 --> 00:35:36,587
That you should meet your end here.

611
00:35:37,712 --> 00:35:39,810
The word will go out.

612
00:35:41,257 --> 00:35:43,468
No one will escape

613
00:35:43,953 --> 00:35:46,265
from the executioner's blade.

614
00:35:53,158 --> 00:35:54,769
No.

615
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,886
No!

616
00:35:57,597 --> 00:35:59,378
You will face judgment.

617
00:35:59,683 --> 00:36:01,456
You will be judged!

618
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,453
You know what, Captain?

619
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:05,316
This place is a church.

620
00:36:06,363 --> 00:36:07,462
Mine.

621
00:36:39,321 --> 00:36:41,344
Our agreement still holds
for five hours.

622
00:36:41,618 --> 00:36:43,110
I am aware.

623
00:36:53,995 --> 00:36:56,074
How do you expect to win, Oswald?

624
00:36:56,597 --> 00:36:58,871
Barbara Kean runs the underworld.

625
00:36:59,168 --> 00:37:00,401
We have the gangs.

626
00:37:00,754 --> 00:37:02,174
You have...

627
00:37:02,955 --> 00:37:04,658
yourself.

628
00:37:06,447 --> 00:37:09,139
Actually, I have an army

629
00:37:09,178 --> 00:37:11,076
of Hugo Strange's monsters
at my command.

630
00:37:11,904 --> 00:37:15,038
But even if I were alone,

631
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:17,905
you wouldn't stand a chance.

632
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:21,257
I suppose we'll see.

633
00:37:21,437 --> 00:37:23,132
I suppose so.

634
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:39,342
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Yeah, okay.

635
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,230
Lee?

636
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:45,479
What are you doing here?

637
00:37:45,504 --> 00:37:46,817
I just came to get some things.

638
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:51,205
You saw me, you thought
I'd heard about Barnes

639
00:37:51,241 --> 00:37:52,543
and I came to help?

640
00:37:52,832 --> 00:37:54,715
Is that such a crazy idea?

641
00:37:55,167 --> 00:37:56,699
It's just bad timing.

642
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:59,257
And if I had heard I wouldn't have come.

643
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:02,546
- I'm done with this place.
- So you keep saying.

644
00:38:02,786 --> 00:38:05,288
You know, Barnes loved the GCPD.

645
00:38:05,622 --> 00:38:07,522
But today he tried to destroy it.

646
00:38:07,691 --> 00:38:08,903
It was the virus.

647
00:38:09,005 --> 00:38:11,848
Or maybe he finally
discovered the truth:

648
00:38:12,195 --> 00:38:14,325
there is no justice here.

649
00:38:15,121 --> 00:38:16,790
Look at you... you still haven't paid

650
00:38:16,815 --> 00:38:18,675
for the pain that you've caused.

651
00:38:18,775 --> 00:38:20,538
But I guess that's the difference
between the two of us.

652
00:38:20,563 --> 00:38:22,647
I'm willing to pay for what I've done.

653
00:38:23,882 --> 00:38:25,648
What are you talking about,
what've you done?

654
00:38:25,893 --> 00:38:27,843
Nothing. Doesn't matter.

655
00:38:28,812 --> 00:38:31,101
Hey, Jim, my guy worked on the owl,

656
00:38:31,135 --> 00:38:33,035
says he's gonna need another hour.

657
00:38:33,133 --> 00:38:35,828
- What did Lee want?
- I have no idea.

658
00:38:36,553 --> 00:38:39,303
But, Harvey, if we do find
the location of the sites,

659
00:38:39,334 --> 00:38:40,897
we've got to be ready to move.

660
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:43,232
Kathryn's killing is only
gonna energize the Court,

661
00:38:43,263 --> 00:38:45,107
- force their leader to act.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wai-wait,

662
00:38:45,138 --> 00:38:48,172
there's someone above her? Who?

663
00:38:48,677 --> 00:38:50,533
I don't know.

664
00:39:11,396 --> 00:39:13,170
Go on, Bruce.

665
00:39:14,334 --> 00:39:17,842
The Court of Owls
must pay for what they did.

666
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:20,371
It's the only way.

667
00:39:58,768 --> 00:40:00,076
Thank you.

668
00:40:03,357 --> 00:40:04,920
Tell me,

669
00:40:05,342 --> 00:40:10,865
how do you feel now when
you think of your parents' murder?

670
00:40:11,481 --> 00:40:12,950
I feel...

671
00:40:16,432 --> 00:40:17,825
...nothing.

672
00:40:20,824 --> 00:40:22,453
Hmm.

673
00:40:30,467 --> 00:40:33,947
Talons have served the Court
since its inception.

674
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:37,049
The Court culls them from orphanages.

675
00:40:37,107 --> 00:40:38,573
Trains them.

676
00:40:38,608 --> 00:40:43,707
What I did to you, the Court has
done with them for 200 years.

677
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:48,014
But the process does more
than remove all feeling.

678
00:40:49,287 --> 00:40:53,740
Cut off the smallest finger
of your left hand.

679
00:40:59,888 --> 00:41:01,638
Shall I tell him to eat it?

680
00:41:02,482 --> 00:41:05,045
He will, if I say so.

681
00:41:06,725 --> 00:41:08,546
Bandage that.

682
00:41:09,721 --> 00:41:12,190
You see, Bruce, the pain of our memories

683
00:41:12,229 --> 00:41:14,987
can scar us, but it also defines us.

684
00:41:15,018 --> 00:41:16,744
Take away that pain

685
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:20,619
and your mind becomes clay
for me to mold.

686
00:41:20,823 --> 00:41:22,752
I told you the truth.

687
00:41:22,811 --> 00:41:25,531
We will destroy the Court of Owls.

688
00:41:25,594 --> 00:41:28,922
And in so doing, you will become
the perfect weapon.

689
00:41:28,952 --> 00:41:32,867
For you will do whatever I say.

690
00:41:34,203 --> 00:41:36,015
Won't you?

691
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,130
Yes.

692
00:41:43,817 --> 00:41:46,607
See? I told you it would work.

693
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:49,341
This is it, Alfred...
we can find Bruce and end this.

694
00:41:49,419 --> 00:41:51,296
Alvarez, call Strike Force.

695
00:41:51,382 --> 00:41:53,315
I want every cop
on the roster in uniform

696
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,264
and ready to roll in half an hour.

697
00:41:55,685 --> 00:41:57,272
What are you waiting for?

698
00:41:57,428 --> 00:41:59,858
I was coming to tell you.
I just got word from Arkham.

699
00:42:00,108 --> 00:42:01,793
Barnes escaped his transport.

700
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:04,186
Took out three guards. He's in the wind.

701
00:42:04,245 --> 00:42:06,333
We just busted that dude
five minutes ago.

702
00:42:06,723 --> 00:42:08,348
There's more.

703
00:42:12,816 --> 00:42:15,847
What is this doing in here?
It's supposed to be in Lucius' office.

704
00:42:15,956 --> 00:42:18,527
He must have moved it. He said
he needed to run some tests.

705
00:42:18,635 --> 00:42:21,362
The virus sample
we got from Hugo Strange...

706
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:23,276
- it's gone.
- Maybe Lucius took it.

707
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,712
You're the only two
with the combination, right?

708
00:42:24,737 --> 00:42:25,988
Yeah.

709
00:42:27,626 --> 00:42:29,824
No. Lee has it, too.
