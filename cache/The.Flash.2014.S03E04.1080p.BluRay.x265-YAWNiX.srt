1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,201
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,086
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,891
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,765
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,601
<i>After defeating Zoom
and saving the multi-verse,</i>

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,128
<i>I ran back in time and created
the alternate timeline, Flashpoint.</i>

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,004
<i>I restored the timeline to how it was</i>

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,810
<i>only to find things
weren't as I left them.</i>

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,969
<i>I brought new threats to our world.</i>

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,407
<i>And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,802
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,164
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,641
This has already been
a really amazing date, Flash.

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,922
Cecile. Thanks for stopping by.

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,645
Hey, anything for my favorite detective.

16
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,524
Then you restored the timeline
and things were different?

17
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,761
Exactly.

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,610
Jesse. You're a speedster.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,446
When I came back, things weren't the same.

20
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,607
You mean people?

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,926
Yeah.

22
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,161
How do I look?

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,091
Better. How much?

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,168
Do we really need to ask that question?

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,164
Our take wasn't that big.

26
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,888
Big enough.

27
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,765
But the only question you should be asking

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,403
is what size rock you want
dangling from this beautiful neck.

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,525
Kiss from you makes my world spin.

30
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,883
You're so full of it, you know that?

31
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,881
I gotta be honest.
I never understood this.

32
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,244
Well, like my sister says,
anyone can stoop over and pick up nothing.

33
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,726
What do you want, Snart?

34
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,842
I told you two to sit on your cut
for a while. Till things cool down.

35
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,562
Some of us like to actually
spend the cash we get from these jobs.

36
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,684
Not when it's from the ones with me.

37
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,291
You didn't pull 'em off yourself.

38
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,886
Without us, you'd still be
kicking down liquor stores.

39
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,203
I think you spend too much time
staring at yourself in the mirror,

40
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,648
because your perception of reality
is a bit warped.

41
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,881
You know the rules.

42
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,203
I don't give a damn about your rules.
Or laying low.

43
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,406
<i>There's no one in this city
who can stop us.</i>

44
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,050
Including you, Snart.

45
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,881
Sounds to me like
you're saying you want out.

46
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,401
- Mmm-hmm.
- Guess so.

47
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,971
Well, if you're out,

48
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,444
you're out.

49
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,441
No!

50
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,170
You lost, Scudder.

51
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,441
Sam!

52
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,962
Go. Go!

53
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,327
<i>Sam?</i>

54
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,165
Give me a hand here.

55
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,280
Demo starts in a month.
Get everything outta here.

56
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,440
The hell?

57
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,451
Where's Snart? Where's Snart?

58
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,045
This is from a security camera
inside Iron Heights.

59
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,006
Forensic analysis indicates that
the footage is genuine,

60
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,770
no evidence of tampering.

61
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,324
We're pretty sure this is
Doctor Alchemy that did this?

62
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,369
Last thing Clariss said before he died.

63
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,090
Unless someone else killed him.

64
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,849
Like a meta with telekinesis,
or cloaking abilities.

65
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,161
<i>We've got both on Earth.</i>

66
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,641
So what do we do now?

67
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,607
Our meta-human specialist at C.C.P.D.,
Julian Albert, he prefers to work alone.

68
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,723
But I got feelers out on
his investigation.

69
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,803
I'm gonna go there now
and see if he dug up anything.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,001
All right.

71
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,806
Okay.
Well, until then, you guys want to train?

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,843
Well, no. We have to think about
getting back to our Earth.

73
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,246
We've been here long enough.

74
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,202
I've still got a lot to learn.
I mean, your words, not mine.

75
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,241
Fine.

76
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,963
Well, if you want to train,
let's train. Speedster style.

77
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,767
Damn. Jesse's almost as fast as Barry.

78
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,611
Velocity's just under Mach three.
Heartrate, a 100 BPM's.

79
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,881
Her vitals are normal.

80
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,885
Yeah, no. We already know all that.
Cisco, we need to test her reflexes.

81
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,047
Can we test her reflexes?

82
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,971
Patience, Harry. Patience.
If anyone's gonna teach Jesse

83
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,650
- the ways of the speed force...
- It's Barry.

84
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,927
Thank you.

85
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,247
Okay.
Well, that wasn't very heroic.

86
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,011
Nope, uh, but there is
a lesson in there, somewhere.

87
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,167
What's that?

88
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,045
The difference between
having powers and having precision.

89
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,207
What do you mean?

90
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,449
I mean, it's gonna take more than speed
to take down some of these metas.

91
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,484
You gotta think. Anticipate.
When you enter a new environment,

92
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,802
you gotta case every inch of it.
You never run in blind.

93
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,925
Oh, my God. I've become Oliver.

94
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,049
<i>Maybe we should stay a little bit longer.</i>

95
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,767
Yeah, I guess so.

96
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,208
It's gonna take some time
to master your powers, Jesse.

97
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,441
You'll get the hang of it.

98
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,644
Yeah. I know. Thanks.
Well, since I will be here for a while

99
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,330
do you wanna get out of here?

100
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,887
Where to?

101
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,241
Does it matter?

102
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,561
No touching.

103
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,887
Not what I meant
by staying longer!

104
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,164
- I should probably get to CCPN.
- Okay.

105
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,361
I'll see you tonight?

106
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,085
- Can't wait.
- Okay.

107
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,126
- Hey, Harry.
- Yeah?

108
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,209
Are you really sure you have to leave?

109
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,562
Just a lot that I still have to
fix on my Earth.

110
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,370
Yeah. But you know it's more fun
when you're here

111
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,766
helping us fix stuff on our Earth.

112
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,641
He is right.
Hasn't been the same without you.

113
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,922
Team doesn't feel complete
without Harrison Wells.

114
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,441
Then change that.

115
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,682
There's a whole multi-verse of
Harrison Wells out there

116
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,081
at your fingertips.

117
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,607
You want one? Let's go get one.

118
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,408
Yeah, now I remembered it.
Thank you, Officer.

119
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,806
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

120
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,168
So sorry. I got held up at the courthouse.

121
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,408
No problem.
You're the one doing me the favor.

122
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,648
Yeah, I wouldn't thank me just yet.

123
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,928
Oh, you couldn't find anything.

124
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,408
Nope. No one at the DA's office knows
anything about anybody named Alchemy.

125
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,840
Oh, damn.

126
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,208
This is, um,
meta-human related, I assume?

127
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,687
It appears to be.

128
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,881
- Yikes.
- I know.

129
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,880
Okay, you let me know if there's anything
I can do for you, yeah?

130
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,447
Yeah.
Thanks for bringing it yourself, Cecile.

131
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,121
It's my pleasure.

132
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,486
This is really nice.

133
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,724
Staying in is so much better
than going out.

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,480
- When you have jobs like ours? Yes.
- Yes.

135
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,361
What?

136
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,160
You're just really handsome.

137
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,810
You are not so bad yourself.

138
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,681
Hey, um, hi. I thought...

139
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,162
I didn't think you were gonna
be home for a while. Right?

140
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,605
My plans changed. I... Unfortunately...
I'm just gonna go upstairs.

141
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,723
You can have a beer. Sit with us.

142
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,566
Have a good night.

143
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,006
I know.

144
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,411
- I'm sorry.
- Should we rain check or...

145
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,728
Barry, I am not upset because
our date got interrupted.

146
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,961
That I understand.

147
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,244
- What do you mean?
- You, speeding away when my dad walks in.

148
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,487
- Yeah.
- Because, what, we're kissing?

149
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,643
Yeah, Iris. Exactly.

150
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,086
What, you don't want to kiss me?

151
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,090
Of course I want to kiss you,
but not in front of him.

152
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,327
Why does that matter?

153
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,848
He's your...

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,002
Our Joe. I don't know.

155
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,163
Barry, we are adults.

156
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,768
- I know.
- We are dating. We should be able to kiss.

157
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,490
I agree.

158
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,525
Okay. Yep. Yep. You should talk to him.

159
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,126
Mmm, about...

160
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,682
For real?

161
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,843
Yeah. Go talk to him.

162
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,011
Yeah, sure. I'll talk to him.

163
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,770
- Okay.
- <i>About us kissing.</i>

164
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,849
- Yeah.
- It's not gonna be awkward at all.

165
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,001
Let me know how it goes.

166
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,964
It's gonna be awkward, so...

167
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,211
<i>Where's Snart?</i>

168
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,361
Who said that? Where are you?

169
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,041
Boo.

170
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,847
Scudder?

171
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,530
Where's Snart?

172
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,565
I don't know, man.

173
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,848
Then I guess I'll just have to
find someone who does.

174
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,325
And I know just the girl.

175
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,161
Yeah, Sam Scudder.

176
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,761
He threw me into a mirror,
I fell out of a second story window.

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,085
So Scudder's going after everyone
in Snart's old crew to track him down.

178
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,251
Yeah, but the only problem is Scudder's
not gonna find him. Snart's gone.

179
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,011
What do you mean, "He's gone?"

180
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,728
He's gone. I thought I...
Oliver told me that Snart left

181
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,049
with some friends of ours on a trip.

182
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,089
I don't even want to know.

183
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,930
One of Snart's old crew
is at Iron Heights.

184
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,361
I'll go see if I can talk to her.

185
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,722
Okay. I'll see if I can locate
any others at S.T.A.R. Labs.

186
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,729
Hey actually, I'm sorry. I just need to
talk to you about something really quick.

187
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,530
Um...

188
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:45,604
Okay. So, I know it's probably awkward,
seeing me and Iris kiss.

189
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,726
- Uh, yeah.
- Yeah. So, I was just thinking.

190
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,051
- Maybe if...
- Did it have to be awkward?

191
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,641
Uh, do you mean like this conversation?

192
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,408
Like this conversation. I don't know.
It's just cause the next time you see us.

193
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,485
- We may kiss again in front of you. So...
- Okay.

194
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,284
I just want to make sure that,
that is okay.

195
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,042
- Look, Barr...
- Uh-huh.

196
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,606
- You're an adult.
- Yes.

197
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,520
Do what you got to do. I love you.

198
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,649
- I love you, too.
- I love her.

199
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,448
I don't love watching you two make out.

200
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,489
Urn, okay. Just so you know, I am gonna
tell Iris that we talked about this.

201
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,365
Yeah. Like I said, do what you got to do.

202
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,641
Okay.

203
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,681
WOW.

204
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,282
How sure are you that this will work?

205
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,167
Pretty sure.

206
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,370
Okay, but how's this going to help us
find another Harrison Wells?

207
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,849
- You ever go fishing, Snow?
- No.

208
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,402
No, all right. When you go fishing,
you use lures. Lures attract fish.

209
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,644
Fish end up on your fishing pole.
This satellite is our fishing pole

210
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,729
through which we're gonna cast
our very tempting bait

211
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,729
out into the world's largest ocean.

212
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,843
Okay. How?

213
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,931
How. Cisco will open a breach and
this satellite will shoot a message

214
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,891
embedded with a tachyon-enhanced laser
out into the multi-verse

215
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,168
and any Earth that is technologically
advanced enough

216
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,407
should be able to receive it.

217
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,603
Okay. Let's say this somehow works.

218
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,842
Just 'cause they can solve a riddle,

219
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,724
doesn't mean they're
a right fit for the team.

220
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,922
- A riddle. Did you say riddle?
- Yeah.

221
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,564
How dare you, sir? This is not a riddle.
This is a complex algorithmic cryptogram

222
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,730
designed to test deductive reasoning, IQ,
problem solving skills,

223
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,211
anything that our team will need to combat
threats, meta-human or otherwise.

224
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,286
Okay. So you're just sending out
an intergalactic IQ test

225
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,249
to all of your doppelgangers
in the multi-verse.

226
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,249
Not just a test.
Think of it as an invitation,

227
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,091
think of it as an elaborate help
wanted ad.

228
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,123
Will it test their attitudes too?

229
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,886
I'm not sure I can stomach another Wells
with your bedside manner.

230
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,448
I care for you too, you jack wagon.
System is calibrated.

231
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,405
What are you waiting for?

232
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,451
And...

233
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,969
- That's it.
- That's it?

234
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,969
- Yeah. That's it.
- So, now what?

235
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,325
Now? We go get a Big Belly Burger.

236
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,131
That's insane. What a rush.

237
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,289
I know. I mean, it took me a while
to get used to it.

238
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,965
I can't believe you're not sick at all.

239
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,963
I must have an iron stomach.

240
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,681
Okay, so you're telling me that Barry
has never taken you on a run?

241
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,001
No.

242
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,965
Well, then, I guess it's
a good thing you've got me.

243
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,485
Guess so.

244
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,329
Whoa, um, hold up.

245
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,681
Oh, uh...

246
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,681
I'm sorry. Am I reading this,
like, completely wrong or something?

247
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,810
No, no. I like you, Jesse. It's just...

248
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,371
It's just what?

249
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,804
Well, you're going home soon.
To another Earth.

250
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,045
Ah, right.
Yeah, yeah. No. It's cool. Yeah.

251
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,207
Jesse, I...

252
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,370
No, no, no. It's totally cool. I get it.

253
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,890
So, uh, still friends, then?

254
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,241
Yeah. Friends.

255
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,926
Well, as friends, I mean,
we can still run around the city, right?

256
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,405
For sure.

257
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,888
Good looking guy. For a criminal.

258
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,764
Well, he's more than just a criminal now.

259
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,890
Apparently he's a meta
who can travel through mirrors.

260
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,923
Oh, oh, I got this one. He's a...

261
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,082
- Mirror Master.
- What the...

262
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,361
- Boom.
- That's good.

263
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,245
Thank you. We had a Mirror Master
on our Earth. Evan McCulloch.

264
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,842
He wasn't a meta, though. He had
some kind of Mirror Gun that he used.

265
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,041
How'd it work?

266
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,365
Must've had dimensional warping tech that
changed everything into two-dimensions.

267
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,370
Well, Scudder is hell-bent
on finding Snart

268
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,449
and he's going after anybody that
worked with him in the past.

269
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,761
Joe's interviewing one of them right now.

270
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,725
Well, all of Snart's known associates
are either presumed dead

271
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,244
or have gone AWOL except for one.
That's her.

272
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,441
Rosalind Dillon.

273
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,564
Says she has the ability
to induce crippling vertigo.

274
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,443
A top. Like a top. She's a top.
That's her name. Top. Amazing.

275
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,641
What? You wanna go?

276
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,760
Okay. Do we think that
she can lead us to Scudder?

277
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,042
Love to see if Joe gets
any answers out of her.

278
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,802
Heard your ex is back in town.
You know anything about that?

279
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,490
He pay you a visit, Miss Dillon?

280
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,087
They don't let people like me
have visitors here, Detective.

281
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,970
All day, all night,
in my boring little cell.

282
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,965
Makes a girl go crazy.

283
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:45,002
Scudder tried to kill one of your
old crewmates last night. Leon Williams.

284
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,605
Tried? Too bad he failed.

285
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,003
He's gonna try to kill more. Any idea who?

286
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,082
Give us a name, I'll see what we can do
about your current situation.

287
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,603
Okay. Let us know if you change your mind.

288
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,761
Sorry, Joe.

289
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,765
It's all right. I appreciate
you setting up the interview, though.

290
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,486
Looks like I owe you another one.

291
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,648
You know, these IOU's are
starting to pile up.

292
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,644
- I have an idea about that.
- Do you?

293
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,051
Scudder?

294
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,282
You want me, come and get me.

295
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,011
So you saw Sam Scudder and Rosalind Dillon
escape through a glass window?

296
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,841
Like I said, he grabbed her hand.
They walked to the window and poof.

297
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,041
They were gone.

298
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,523
So, mirrors, windows, it sounds like
he can travel through anything

299
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,801
that has a reflective surface.

300
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,201
How exactly does he do that?

301
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,051
He must be able to link
Einstein-Rosen bridges to anything

302
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,605
with high solar reflectance, right?

303
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,883
So he creates wormholes
through reflections. That's a new one.

304
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,402
Look, I can't pretend to understand
or care about the science of it all,

305
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,490
but we need to find Dillon and Scudder
before something really bad happens.

306
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,007
So, I'm gonna go old-school
at the precinct.

307
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,201
I'll see you later.

308
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,250
Oh, my God. Pings. We got pings.

309
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,205
Looks like some of your
doppelgangers out there

310
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,726
actually cracked your code, Harry.

311
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,001
That was fast.

312
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,881
Let's go take a look.

313
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,201
Guys...

314
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,202
Um, Dad seems fine.

315
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,728
Um, yeah. No, he's still a little weird
about it.

316
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,160
You talked to him though, right?

317
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,444
Um, yeah. I did. Yeah. It'll be good.

318
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,561
- Okay, great.
- Yeah.

319
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,285
- Then I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah.

320
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,720
You'll pick a good movie?

321
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,571
- I'll try.
- Okay.

322
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,842
Also gonna try to find the meta-humans

323
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,651
that apparently
no one else cares about right now.

324
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,171
Where the hell did you go?

325
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,002
How many times
do I have to tell you, Rosa?

326
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,125
I was stuck in there.

327
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,726
Whatever it was that hit me,
gave me this crazy ability.

328
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,971
And to me, all of this
just happened last night.

329
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,440
It's been three years, Sam.

330
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,850
So many things are different now.

331
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,491
You were hit, too, weren't you?

332
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,051
- You can do things like me?
- Yeah.

333
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,521
Show me.

334
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,844
You might want to hold onto something.

335
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,721
Oh...

336
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,451
See, Sammy?

337
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,730
Too much has changed.

338
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,285
Then let's change it back.

339
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,561
Huh?

340
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,282
I can stop Snart, Rosa.

341
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,530
We can stop Snart.

342
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,000
Snart?

343
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,090
He's gone. Long gone.

344
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,125
Then let's take this city.

345
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,089
We can be who we wanted, now.
We can be in control.

346
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,847
There's no one in this city
who can stop us now.

347
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,091
There's one person who can.

348
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,641
Who?

349
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,926
The Flash.

350
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,567
<i>Well, hey now.</i>

351
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,206
<i>I solved the riddle,
that you done beamed up.</i>

352
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,880
<i>My name is Wells. Harrison Wells.</i>

353
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,600
<i>They call me Hell's Wells.
They call me that 'cause of my past.</i>

354
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,407
<i>I gonna get into it with you now,
right and proper.</i>

355
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,242
<i>I like to hitch wagons and
I had a bad dinner...</i>

356
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,450
- Pass.
- All right. This is Earth-17.

357
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,647
<i>I'll be in touch.</i>

358
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,969
<i>Salutations to all
of you out there in the multi-verse.</i>

359
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,851
<i>I have of late, wherefore I know not,
received a communique</i>

360
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,123
<i>from the citizens of Terra-Prime.</i>

361
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,401
Terra-Prime?

362
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,601
Nerd. Pass.

363
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,769
- You can't trust a mime.
- Can't argue with that.

364
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,246
- Pass.
- Okay, guys!

365
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,528
We're oh-for-three now.
This is our last one.

366
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,042
He's coming from Earth-19.

367
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,006
<i>Hello, hello, hello.
Hello out there in the multi-verse.</i>

368
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,725
<i>Whoever you may be.</i>

369
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,001
Um...

370
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,482
<i>I really enjoyed cracking
the cryptogram you broadcast.</i>

371
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,290
<i>I like the cute trick.</i>

372
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,404
<i>Embedding the secondary measures
in the primary data string. It's clever.</i>

373
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,007
<i>Most people wouldn't have caught it,
I caught it. But that's the point.</i>

374
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,449
<i>You need a genius, I guess.</i>

375
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,726
<i>To help you in your fight against
these awful meta-hominids.</i>

376
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,244
<i>Well, I gotta tell you, I gotta tell you,
to me that sounds like fun.</i>

377
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,206
<i>So, I've enclosed my Curriculum Vitae.</i>

378
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,641
<i>You already know we speak
the same language, take a look,</i>

379
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,127
<i>tell me what you think.
Until our next communion.</i>

380
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,007
<i>Oh, where are my manners? Thank you.</i>

381
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,361
- Not bad.
- Not bad at all.

382
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,929
- Harry?
- Pass.

383
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,770
- What?
- Pass.

384
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,200
Wait, what... Wait a minute.

385
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,283
That guy cracked the code
and he wants to do it.

386
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,000
And he's nice and he's not evil.

387
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,929
And that's a combination of Wells
we haven't had thus far.

388
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,443
All my life, everyone I've ever hired,
to work for me, I have trusted my gut.

389
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,608
My gut tells me that's not the guy.
Keep looking.

390
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,331
<i>It's all right. He's my friend.</i>

391
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,645
Oh, I'm just gonna get...

392
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,528
Oh, for God's sake. Okay. You know what?
I can't take this anymore.

393
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,001
What?

394
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,767
I thought you guys were supposed
to talk about us.

395
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,927
- We did.
- We did.

396
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,169
- Then why are you being so weird?
- I'm not...

397
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,841
Dad?

398
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,050
Iris, I already told him.

399
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,643
If you two wanna cuddle, make out,
do whatever.

400
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,286
Go for it. I don't care.

401
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,409
- Barry?
- Hey.

402
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,161
- Should we give you guys a minute?
- No, no. It's fine.

403
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,565
Look, Barry. This isn't about
my dad anymore. He's fine with it.

404
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,970
- I'm not totally fine with it.
- So, why do you have a problem with this?

405
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,005
Thank God.

406
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,765
There's a robbery at First National.

407
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,885
Suspects match Scudder and Dillon's
description.

408
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,606
Scudder and Dillon. Yeah.
Sorry, I gotta go.

409
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,246
- Okay.
- Hey, uh, let me help.

410
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,086
We've been training for a reason, right?
You gotta try.

411
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,009
Yep. All right, cool.
Just, follow my lead.

412
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,848
We keep this up,

413
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,650
baby, we'll be set for life.

414
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,371
Then what are you waiting for?

415
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,446
Let's do it again.

416
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,528
Anything for you, baby.

417
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,764
<i>Yeah, so, uh, we're not gonna
let you leave here with that.</i>

418
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,490
Hey, Flash. Heard a lot about you.

419
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,160
That's great.

420
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,921
- Can't say the same for you, though.
- The name's Jesse Quick.

421
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,362
<i>So, I'm sorry, Scudder.</i>

422
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,126
But your little crime spree,
it's gonna have to end here.

423
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,049
Oh, I don't think you have
much of a say in it.

424
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,125
I'm gonna take whatever I want.

425
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,930
I thought you were
looking for Leonard Snart.

426
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:36,371
Why bother? His reign is over.
There's a new king in town.

427
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,806
And I'm the queen.

428
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,809
Yeah, I wouldn't be too sure about that.

429
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,041
Oh, I would, little girl.

430
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,202
- Where'd they go?
- There.

431
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,450
Stay here. I'm not kidding.

432
00:24:53,474 --> 00:24:55,474
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

433
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,601
- Nice skirt, Top.
- Top.

434
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,010
I like it. Because they spin, spin, spin.

435
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,805
What's this? What's happening?

436
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,523
- I can't get my balance.
- I know. It's okay. You're gonna be okay.

437
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,049
But you won't.

438
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,206
Good luck getting him out.

439
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,562
Barry!

440
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,720
What happened?

441
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,049
I don't know. I don't know, okay?
I looked at Dillon and I lost my balance.

442
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,689
She's a meta-human who induces vertigo.
She just whammied you.

443
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,730
Yeah, I guess so.
It doesn't really matter, does it?

444
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,002
Because now Barry's trapped in there
and it's because of me.

445
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,001
- Well, you know, I...
- I'll go talk to her.

446
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,207
- What is he saying?
- Is that some sort of mirror language?

447
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,531
Mirrors show objects in reverse.
Maybe that's what we're hearing here.

448
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,361
Only one way to find out.

449
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,681
What are you looking for, Cisco?

450
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,890
You ever seen Twin Peaks?
'Course not. Why do I ask?

451
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,530
This is an old back-masking trick they
used for The Man from Another Place,

452
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,570
where they record his audio backwards
and then play it forwards.

453
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,131
Like those Ozzy Osbourne records.

454
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,121
Sure, let's go with that.

455
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,725
Okay, Barry. Say something.

456
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,245
Say it again.

457
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,562
- <i>Um, get me out of here.</i>
- Now, we can understand you.

458
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,246
- How do we get him out of there?
- Barry, have you tried to phase out yet?

459
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,243
- <i>Yes, it's not working.</i>
- If Scudder's used this mirror

460
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,166
as a wormhole, then these molecules
are in a hyper state of flux. So all...

461
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,721
We need is something
really cold to slow them down.

462
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,650
I can help with that. Let's go.

463
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,930
Keep him company.

464
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,841
Aren't you gonna need that?

465
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,241
What's the point? I mean, I thought
I was ready but clearly, I'm not.

466
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,927
Jesse, you can't blame yourself for this.
What happened to Barry...

467
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,168
Was totally my fault.

468
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,283
I mean, he told me to stay back,
but I didn't listen.

469
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,082
I just ran in blind
and now he's stuck. So...

470
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,290
Look, you made a mistake. So what?

471
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,767
I mean, I'm sure Barry made
a lot of mistakes at first too.

472
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,921
Yeah.

473
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,520
Don't let this destroy your confidence.
You're meant to do this, Jesse.

474
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,446
You're meant to be a speedster.

475
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,284
That's why you have these powers
and I don't.

476
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,124
You're just trying to cheer me up.

477
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,448
I know you said
you don't want to hang, so...

478
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,321
You know, I said I didn't want to hang out
because I was scared.

479
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,286
Because you live on another Earth.

480
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,644
But I realized I don't want to be scared
of that anymore.

481
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,965
I don't think it's gonna work.

482
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,441
What do you mean
you don't think it's gonna work?

483
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,325
- I built this to go to absolute zero.
- I realize that. But we need the mirror

484
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,002
to maintain zero point energy long enough
for Barry's molecules to pass through it.

485
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,685
Absolute zero's more than
cold enough to do that.

486
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,888
Normally, but we have to account
for internal energy

487
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,804
of the mirror's molecules as well.

488
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,367
So absolute cold might be
lowest possible temperature...

489
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,324
It's not the lowest enthalpy state
possible.

490
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,681
Exactly right.

491
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,169
- So what are we gonna do?
- I don't know yet.

492
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,002
Okay. Go with me here.
What if we send this to the other Wells

493
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,650
- and see if he can figure something out?
- Yeah.

494
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,841
What? No. What?

495
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,247
Everybody's replaceable now?
Is that right? Is that what this is?

496
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,481
What? What are you talking about?

497
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,806
What are you talking about?
It's what you said.

498
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,411
- That's not what I said.
- It's exactly what you said.

499
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,210
I'm saying we need
to find a solution to this problem...

500
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,401
Yeah, that's not gonna help.

501
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,802
You're not contributing to the problem.
You're making things worse.

502
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,041
- You know what I think?
- What do you think?

503
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,009
I think you don't like the idea
of someone taking your place.

504
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,565
This is why you don't
like the other Wells.

505
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,046
What are you talking about?
It was my idea.

506
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,571
But that doesn't mean you have to like it.

507
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,841
It's got nothing to do with liking it.

508
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,088
You know what it has to do with?

509
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,924
- A Molecular decelerator.
- Molecular decelerator.

510
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,846
If we augment a molecular decelerator on
the cryogenic generator, the cold gun...

511
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,690
The cold gun. I can build that.
I can build that.

512
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,561
Great.

513
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,611
<i>What are you doing?</i>

514
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,448
- Do these pants make my butt look big?
- <i>I'm, literally, stuck in a mirror.</i>

515
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,841
Sorry. Yeah.

516
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,243
- Mmm.
- What's it like in there?

517
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,366
Um...

518
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,566
Dark.

519
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,406
<i>Look, Iris.</i>

520
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,726
<i>I'm sorry that I'm stuck right now.</i>

521
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,883
Oh, honey. I know that you're stuck.
It's okay.

522
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,048
- We're gonna get you out of there.
- No...

523
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,726
<i>No. That was misleading.
Not the mirror, I mean with us.</i>

524
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,487
<i>This thing with Joe...
And you were right. It's not Joe, it's me.</i>

525
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,451
<i>It's my problem.
I've just been feeling nervous</i>

526
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,803
<i>about this new dynamic
between the three of us.</i>

527
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,603
<i>I don't know. I have everything
that I've ever wanted right now.</i>

528
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,402
<i>And I've never had that in my life
and a lot of ways</i>

529
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,762
<i>it's scarier than having nothing</i>

530
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,922
<i>because it's easier to fail than succeed.</i>

531
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,125
<i>And I really want to succeed.</i>

532
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,489
<i>What could you possibly be
laughing about right now?</i>

533
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,120
I am so sorry, Barry.
You are really sweet,

534
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:33,241
but it is weird talking to you through
a mirror and a speaker

535
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:39,771
and I really want to kiss you right now.
But, can we please talk about this later?

536
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,331
<i>Yeah, we can talk about it later.</i>

537
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,561
<i>Guess it is pretty weird.
It's like I'm here but I'm not.</i>

538
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,481
What?

539
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,848
<i>I just thought of a way to stop Scudder.</i>

540
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,608
- What is that?
- This is how we get him out of there.

541
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,121
<i>Let's do it.</i>

542
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,367
Okay.

543
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,687
Try it now.

544
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,522
It's only negative 280 degrees Fahrenheit.

545
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,165
We got to get it colder somehow.

546
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,289
Thought you guys said this thing
could get him out of there.

547
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,643
Okay. "This thing," is a highly advanced
molecular decelerator

548
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,041
that's being powered by a cryo-engine.

549
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,850
We just kind of improvised it
in the last 30 minutes,

550
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,168
so let's just, just cut us
some slack, please.

551
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,486
Just keep trying, Barry.

552
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,887
- Meta-human alert.
- Oh, for God's sake.

553
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,042
- If it's not one thing...
- It's the other.

554
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,361
Hold on, Barr.

555
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,961
<i>Guys?</i>

556
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,521
<i>Hello?</i>

557
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,409
Central City Municipal Bank
just got robbed.

558
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,886
Let me guess by who.

559
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,366
<i>Guys?</i>

560
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,161
- Barry.
- Hey.

561
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,881
How?

562
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,446
I say, let's figure it out later.

563
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,444
Right now we need to stop
Scudder and Dillon.

564
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,444
- Okay, so what do we do?
- We're gonna use mirrors.

565
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,051
An old trick and an old friend.

566
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,527
Yeah?

567
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,247
<i>It's Snart.
I heard you were back in town.</i>

568
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,204
- Snart?
- Scudder. Rosa. Long time.

569
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,811
Not long enough.

570
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,129
Hang back. This guy owes me.

571
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,889
So you called us. The hell you want?

572
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,448
Same thing. You two. Gone.

573
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,481
Things have changed. This is our town now.

574
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,927
- Is that right?
- Yeah it is.

575
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,328
And that little cold gun of yours
isn't going to save you from me.

576
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,967
We'll see about that now, won't we?

577
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,081
Bang!

578
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,441
<i> Funny thing about holograms.</i>

579
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,563
They're just pale reflections
of the real deal.

580
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,521
Hello, again.

581
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,329
Jesse Quick. Quick to run,

582
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,845
quick to fall.

583
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,167
Quick to learn.

584
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,521
Uh-oh.

585
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,331
Well played, Flash.

586
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,201
Oh.

587
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,287
- What?
- I know, right?

588
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,530
This is the, uh, Droste effect.
I'm sure you've heard of it, right?

589
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,564
It's infinite reflective loop that
even you can't escape.

590
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,881
Good luck getting out.

591
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,043
<i>So you're sure he can't Mirror Master
his way out of this cell?</i>

592
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,560
It's impossible.

593
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,650
Every inch has been modified
with an anti-reflective material.

594
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,810
Even Scudder's gonna forget
what he looks like after a while.

595
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,770
Well, I should go.

596
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,648
Hey. So, thank you for everything.

597
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:34,128
Oh, no. Thank you. We got another bad meta
right where he belongs.

598
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,288
- Yep. All right.
- Hey, Joe.

599
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,047
We have an awful lot of IOU's.

600
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,685
Do you maybe want to
grab some dinner tonight?

601
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,967
- Dinner?
- Yeah.

602
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,161
Yeah. I...

603
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,448
Well, I got movie night with
my kids tonight, rain check?

604
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,603
Yeah. Of course. Another time then.

605
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,449
Yo. What was that about?
Why didn't you just say yes?

606
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,769
I don't know. You're not the only one
that gets nervous around here.

607
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,090
Guys, I've never vibed across
18 dimensions before.

608
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,044
Just a little bit longer.

609
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,289
Greetings, Earthlings.

610
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,928
I'm just kidding.
I don't really talk like that.

611
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,687
Just always wanted to say that.
"Earthlings."

612
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,242
Wells with a sense of humor. That's new.

613
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,971
Hey. Sharp shooter.

614
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,880
You, you're handsome.

615
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,329
- I know.
- I know.

616
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,887
Likewise.

617
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,770
- Yeah.
- I'm sure. Harrison.

618
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,201
Harrison. Call me H.R.

619
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,169
H.R. It is.

620
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,361
This is the team, then.
This is Cisco Ramon, he can do anything.

621
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,321
Mmm. Okay.

622
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,324
This is, uh, Doctor Caitlin Snow.

623
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,521
- Hi.
- She is brilliant.

624
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,364
- Single.
- Don't.

625
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,688
All right. That's my daughter,
you don't have to shake her hand,

626
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,042
uh, that gentleman there is Wally West,
this is Barry Allen.

627
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,006
Or as we call him on this Earth,
the Flash.

628
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,765
Welcome to Earth-1.

629
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,162
Thanks. Earth-1. That's weird.

630
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,011
Okay.
Well, we don't have to stand on ceremony.

631
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,527
We don't have to go through all
the tears again, do we gang? Right?

632
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,200
- Well, did I... Did I cry last time?
- I'm talking about myself.

633
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,361
Oh, that's right.

634
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,441
Hey, listen. Don't worry about him, okay?
There's only one Harry.

635
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,931
I wanted to tell you.

636
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,681
The molecular decelerator,
it wasn't working.

637
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,246
What does that mean?

638
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,364
It means that we did not get Barry
out of the mirror. It wasn't us.

639
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,285
Then who did it?

640
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,971
You tell me.

641
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,251
See you later.

642
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,484
Earth-2's gonna have
one hell of a speedster protecting it.

643
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,284
Well, I did learn from the best.

644
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,209
If you ever need any help,
you know how to get back.

645
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,971
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, I'll be back.

646
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,325
All right.

647
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,923
Okay. You guys. Ready?

648
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,924
Uh, yeah.

649
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,841
Okay, Cisco. Out with the old.
In with the new.

650
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,281
Oh...

651
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,085
You'll never be old to us, Harry.

652
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,809
- Ready?
- Yeah. Okay.

653
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,082
Okay. Let's do this.

654
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,204
Oh, one more thing. While I'm gone,
never, ever, no matter what...

655
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,081
Oh, oh.

656
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,527
What was he gonna say?
We're all, like, "What was he gonna say?"

657
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,362
That's cool, though. I'm starving.
You guys have Big Belly Burger?

658
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,610
Some things never change.

659
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,607
Famished.

660
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,811
Barry say anything about this
embarrassing moment with Cecile?

661
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,041
- Hey.
- Hey.

662
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,247
Hey.

663
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,488
How did your first meeting go
with the new Wells?

664
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,489
Uh, good.
Yeah, I think he'll work out fine.

665
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,007
- Good. I look forward to meeting him.
- Mmm. Whoa.

666
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,484
- What?
- I'm just kidding.

667
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,970
I gotta be honest. It's gonna take
a bit for me to get used to that.

668
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,281
Um...

669
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,003
I actually have something to run by you
guys that I think might help with that.

670
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,129
- Really? What up?
- Yeah.

671
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,761
Uh, well, I've just been thinking
that maybe for all of us

672
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,124
that I should probably,
um, get my own place?

673
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,043
- Really?
- Yeah. What do you think?

674
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,081
I say yes.

675
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,288
- I thought you'd never leave.
- Seriously?

676
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,891
- Dad!
- Yep. Look, Barr, come on.

677
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,884
I'm gonna miss you, but damn!
You're grown. About time.

678
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,044
I can't tell if I'm leaving or
if I'm getting kicked out.

679
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,725
You feel like you feel.

680
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,211
- I mean...
- Feel like I'm getting kicked out.

681
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,561
Yeah.
I feel like you're getting kicked out too.

682
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,730
Like, it's pretty obvious
you're getting kicked out. Dad!

683
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,441
Well. Cool.

684
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:13,465
