The Upside Down has probably been around
for thousands of years. Millions.

Before the cops came,

295
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,610
me and El, we... we had a bad fight.

296
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
We never fight.

297
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,780
I mean, we fought before,

298
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,030
but just, like,
silly fights, stupid fights.

299
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,660
But, I don't know,
this one just felt more adult.

300
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,580
Like, it... it just felt more real.

301
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,830
Like, a fight you can't come back from.

302
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,290
Maybe I should've said something,
and if I would've said that thing,

303
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,260
then maybe she'd want me there with her,
wherever she is.

304
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,550
No. Look, Mike,

305
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,550
you're gonna see her again,

306
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,470
and whatever you didn't say,
you can say it to her then.

307
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,560
Okay?

308
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,520
Yeah. Yeah.

309
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,980
She's gonna be okay.

She's not in Hawkins.
That's what we should be worrying about.

our last-ditch effort to save our thesis.

448
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,330
And I really...
I can't breathe in this thing.

449
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,380
Well, Rose, maybe you'd like
to go outside and get some air.

450
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,380
- Maybe I should, Ruth.
- Mm-hmm.

451
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,970
Because I'm starting to think
this whole thing is a colossal mistake.

452
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,890
I'm breaking out in a rash.

453
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,560
My boobs hurt.
And I'll tell you the truth, Anthony.

454
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,060
May I call you Anthony?
These aren't my clothes.

455
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,560
I borrowed them
because I wanted you to take us seriously.

456
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,980
Because nobody takes girls seriously
in this field. They just don't.

457
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,650
We don't look the part or whatever.
But can I tell you a story?

458
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,150
- <font color="#ff00ff">[INSPIRATIONAL MUSIC PLAYING]</font>
- 1978, I was at summer camp.

459
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,450
And my counselor Drew
told me and everyone in Cabin C

460
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,080
the true story
of the Victor Creel Massacre.

461
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,120
And little Petey McHew...
You know Petey, right, Ruth?

462
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,040
Of... Of course.

463
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,500
Yeah. Little Petey McHew
started sobbing right there on the spot.

464
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,380
Full-on hyperventilating.

465
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,420
The other campers
couldn't sleep for weeks.

466
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,720
I couldn't either,
but not 'cause I was scared.

467
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,720
Because I was obsessed with the question,

468
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,680
"What would drive a human being
to commit such unimaginable acts?"

469
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,350
Other kids wanted to be astronauts,
basketball players, rock stars.

470
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,730
But I wanted to be you.

471
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,520
I wanted to be you.

472
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,770
So, forgive me if I'll now
try anything in my power,

473
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,280
including wearing this ridiculous outfit,

474
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,320
if I might get to speak to the man
that ignited my passion

475
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,620
and learn a little more
about how his twisted, but let's face it,

476
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,200
totally fascinating mind works.

477
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,330
So, yes, we don't
have the official paperwork,

478
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:43,210
but don't tell me
that cry-baby Petey McHew

479
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,840
wouldn't have gotten
an audience with Victor in moments

480
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,000
if he'd asked politely,

481
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,170
because you and I both know that he would.

- You see damage to this hull?

Yuri was on sightseeing trip
to see polar bears.

504
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,600
And then bears got into plane

505
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:26,650
and pull him out of cockpit and kill Yuri.

- Yeah.
