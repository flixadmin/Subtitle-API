﻿1
00:00:15,838 --> 00:00:18,758
Man is a strange creature.

2
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:25,507
All his actions are motivated by desire,

3
00:00:27,755 --> 00:00:30,165
his character forged by pain.

4
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:40,708
As much as he may try
to suppress that pain,

5
00:00:42,213 --> 00:00:44,213
to repress the desire,

6
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:51,882
he cannot free himself from the
eternal servitude to his feelings.

7
00:00:57,463 --> 00:01:00,263
For as long as the
storm rages within him,

8
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:03,622
he cannot find peace.

9
00:01:05,255 --> 00:01:07,045
Not in life,

10
00:01:09,088 --> 00:01:10,798
not in death.

11
00:01:13,797 --> 00:01:18,167
And so he will do what
he must, day in, day out.

12
00:01:18,255 --> 00:01:19,755
The pain is his vessel,

13
00:01:21,213 --> 00:01:23,303
desire his compass.

14
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,340
It is all that man is capable of.

15
00:02:57,255 --> 00:02:59,165
June 26, 1954

16
00:02:59,255 --> 00:03:02,915
One day until the Apocalypse

17
00:03:06,922 --> 00:03:12,382
The deceased is female,
5' 7", Caucasian.

18
00:03:12,463 --> 00:03:15,593
Around 75 to 80 years old.

19
00:03:15,672 --> 00:03:18,512
Cause of death: gunshot wound.

20
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:21,417
The eyes are noteworthy.

21
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:24,547
One is blue, one is brown.

22
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:27,375
Known as heterochromia.

23
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,298
This woman, she...

24
00:03:36,755 --> 00:03:38,585
She was at the police station.

25
00:03:39,755 --> 00:03:42,375
The same day that
little Helge reappeared.

26
00:03:43,922 --> 00:03:45,212
And?

27
00:03:45,297 --> 00:03:46,797
She wasn't...

28
00:03:47,505 --> 00:03:49,125
in her right mind.

29
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,170
She kept apologizing for...

30
00:03:54,672 --> 00:03:56,592
something I didn't understand.

31
00:03:58,213 --> 00:04:00,553
You mean on the same
day Helge came back?

32
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,710
Maybe she's the madman's accomplice.

33
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:09,627
She could even be his mother.

34
00:04:10,838 --> 00:04:13,088
Had Helge with her this whole time.

35
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,710
There's something else.

36
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:20,007
It was only by chance that I noticed it.

37
00:04:21,338 --> 00:04:22,378
The corpse

38
00:04:23,005 --> 00:04:24,915
is heavily contaminated by radiation.

39
00:04:28,588 --> 00:04:30,628
Here.

40
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,090
Everywhere.

41
00:04:34,588 --> 00:04:37,022
She must have been exposed

42
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:39,402
to heavy radiation over
a long time period.

43
00:04:39,463 --> 00:04:40,883
That's strange.

44
00:04:40,963 --> 00:04:44,463
It's possible that
she was a radiographer.

45
00:04:44,547 --> 00:04:46,457
Radiographer?

46
00:04:49,463 --> 00:04:52,291
Go back to the Doppler kid
and show him a picture of her.

47
00:04:52,316 --> 00:04:54,117
He might recognize her.

48
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,880
The data suggests

49
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:11,013
that this particle breaks down
into two protons regularly.

50
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:15,048
Mass: 125 gigaelectronvolts.

51
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:27,052
However, in one case
it decayed into four muons.

52
00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:30,133
Oh, you're already here?

53
00:05:33,838 --> 00:05:35,878
I must've lost track of time.

54
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:38,837
What day is this?

55
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,588
Um...

56
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:41,922
It's...

57
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:43,875
the 26th of June.

58
00:05:44,713 --> 00:05:46,553
We're you here all night?

59
00:05:48,422 --> 00:05:50,802
Ex-Winden Chief Inspector,
found dead, June 26, 1987

60
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,170
June 26th.

61
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:57,173
What is it?

62
00:05:59,213 --> 00:06:02,963
You have the meeting with the French
this morning that I rescheduled.

63
00:06:07,505 --> 00:06:08,915
Mrs. Tiedemann?

64
00:06:42,047 --> 00:06:43,297
Mom?

65
00:07:41,755 --> 00:07:45,705
Nuclear Power Plant
What's behind the door?

66
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:57,512
It's all related to me.

67
00:08:00,422 --> 00:08:03,212
He said the world was
going to end tomorrow.

68
00:08:05,713 --> 00:08:08,133
And only those in the bunker make it.

69
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,173
And he said that she's alive.

70
00:08:30,505 --> 00:08:31,915
My mother.

71
00:08:42,713 --> 00:08:45,923
The documents from the Marburg
passport authorities have arrived.

72
00:08:47,857 --> 00:08:51,397
It's just as you expected, there
was only one Aleksander Köhler

73
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:54,012
during that period in
the entire registration.

74
00:08:54,505 --> 00:08:57,455
And so the eyes saw and the ears heard

75
00:08:57,547 --> 00:08:59,547
and nothing remained hidden.

76
00:09:00,297 --> 00:09:01,587
Freud.

77
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:08,207
Let Mr. Wöller know.

78
00:09:23,172 --> 00:09:25,092
We have to tell someone.

79
00:09:25,588 --> 00:09:28,258
Who? And what do we say, exactly?

80
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:32,382
Don't you want to say something?

81
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:38,922
- I bet he's here..
- Who?

82
00:09:40,505 --> 00:09:42,045
Jonas.

83
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,800
I think Bartosz is right. He's back.

84
00:09:45,297 --> 00:09:48,507
We traveled through time and
that's all you're interested in?

85
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,628
You're the one who said
he's involved in this.

86
00:09:51,653 --> 00:09:54,073
Maybe, unlike you, he
knows what this is about.

87
00:09:54,098 --> 00:09:57,148
He might know where Dad is,
or Mikkel, or anything, man!

88
00:09:58,463 --> 00:10:02,013
Magnus is right. We
have to tell someone.

89
00:10:03,047 --> 00:10:05,917
Everyone's been trying to
figure this out for months.

90
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,545
No one's talking.

91
00:10:09,672 --> 00:10:12,212
And what's the point? Nothing.

92
00:10:15,755 --> 00:10:17,005
Okay.

93
00:10:19,088 --> 00:10:20,668
We should do it.

94
00:10:21,713 --> 00:10:23,013
We?

95
00:10:24,922 --> 00:10:26,802
There is no "we".

96
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:34,133
- There never was.
- So what are you saying?

97
00:10:34,213 --> 00:10:36,179
You knew for months what was going on

98
00:10:36,204 --> 00:10:39,077
and you didn't tell me or anyone else!

99
00:10:51,338 --> 00:10:53,088
Do whatever you want.

100
00:11:04,755 --> 00:11:07,085
I hope it won't take too long.

101
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:10,168
Helge is still not doing well.

102
00:11:21,422 --> 00:11:23,092
Do you know this woman?

103
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,455
Answer the police inspector.

104
00:11:32,713 --> 00:11:34,513
Were you at her place?

105
00:11:37,172 --> 00:11:38,962
Did she lock you in?

106
00:11:43,463 --> 00:11:45,513
He told me about her.

107
00:11:48,005 --> 00:11:49,415
The White Devil.

108
00:11:57,547 --> 00:11:58,667
Who?

109
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,960
Who told you about her?

110
00:12:03,172 --> 00:12:06,052
The man... The man who did this to you?

111
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,550
The White Devil.

112
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,170
So tell me about this...

113
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,087
White Devil.

114
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,800
She wants to kill us.

115
00:12:47,297 --> 00:12:49,047
All of us.

116
00:12:51,463 --> 00:12:54,463
She's dead. She can't
hurt anyone anymore.

117
00:12:57,755 --> 00:13:00,295
But she hasn't even begun yet.

118
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:12,667
- Claudia.
- Hello, Dad.

119
00:13:15,213 --> 00:13:17,633
Don't you have to be at work?

120
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,053
Um... I took the day off.

121
00:13:20,755 --> 00:13:22,835
Is everything all right?

122
00:13:23,297 --> 00:13:25,257
I thought you were moving in with us.

123
00:13:26,088 --> 00:13:27,548
I...

124
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,090
Did you forget?

125
00:13:29,172 --> 00:13:31,922
You said I should give it some thought.

126
00:13:35,797 --> 00:13:37,417
I just figured...

127
00:13:38,213 --> 00:13:39,843
why waste any time?

128
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:44,172
And you'd get out of here for once.

129
00:13:46,005 --> 00:13:47,545
I prefer it here.

130
00:13:49,713 --> 00:13:50,713
I have to go.

131
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:53,262
To the hospital.

132
00:13:54,172 --> 00:13:55,632
Starting chemo.

133
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,008
Can I...

134
00:14:03,255 --> 00:14:05,165
Can I come along?

135
00:14:09,338 --> 00:14:11,548
Only... if you want me to.

136
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,800
I'd like that.

137
00:14:26,422 --> 00:14:30,262
What do you want?
I've already told you everything.

138
00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:32,668
I would like you to take a look at this.

139
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:33,755
Mr. Wöller.

140
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:40,665
What is it?

141
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:45,512
It's a copy of the documents
from the registration at Marburg.

142
00:14:45,588 --> 00:14:49,798
The data from your last personal
ID before you moved out here.

143
00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:54,089
I don't see how this is relevant at all.

144
00:14:54,114 --> 00:14:55,821
Nothing catches your eye?

145
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:01,303
No. Should there be something?

146
00:15:03,505 --> 00:15:08,085
You're 5' 6", I bet. Maximum.

147
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:10,212
But the document says 5' 8".

148
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,670
So... I'm wondering where it is.

149
00:15:16,588 --> 00:15:18,508
Where is what?

150
00:15:19,797 --> 00:15:21,707
The two inches missing.

151
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,798
This is ridiculous.

152
00:15:28,047 --> 00:15:29,257
You're under arrest.

153
00:15:31,505 --> 00:15:34,335
I'm charging you with
identity theft and obstruction.

154
00:15:36,922 --> 00:15:38,632
You can't do that.

155
00:15:53,422 --> 00:15:55,302
Hannah?

156
00:15:56,213 --> 00:15:57,513
Hannah!

157
00:16:00,922 --> 00:16:03,262
Anyone home?

158
00:16:06,088 --> 00:16:07,338
Hello!

159
00:16:17,005 --> 00:16:18,255
Hello!

160
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,800
Hannah, if you're at home,
please open the door.

161
00:16:28,463 --> 00:16:30,093
I'm sorry, I...

162
00:16:33,088 --> 00:16:34,588
Who are you?

163
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,300
Come in.

164
00:16:55,588 --> 00:16:57,048
I, um...

165
00:16:58,005 --> 00:17:01,335
I... I wanted Hannah's opinion.

166
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,762
She isn't here.

167
00:17:06,963 --> 00:17:08,263
You want a drink?

168
00:17:13,547 --> 00:17:15,457
Are you scared of me?

169
00:17:16,713 --> 00:17:18,343
I didn't want to scare you.

170
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:23,007
I think I'm having déjà vu or something.

171
00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:25,298
- I should go.
- A glitch in the matrix.

172
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:33,878
What?

173
00:17:38,672 --> 00:17:40,922
Or a message from the beyond.

174
00:17:42,005 --> 00:17:44,005
You read this all somewhere.

175
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:45,798
How do you know that?

176
00:17:56,505 --> 00:17:57,915
Did you find the pendant?

177
00:18:12,213 --> 00:18:13,633
Jonas?

178
00:18:29,505 --> 00:18:32,915
Do you think I was
a good police officer?

179
00:18:34,338 --> 00:18:37,418
Oh, Dad. How would I know?

180
00:18:38,547 --> 00:18:41,627
I'm sure you were good at
whatever you were doing.

181
00:18:45,963 --> 00:18:48,053
I don't think so myself.

182
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:05,455
You... were always different.

183
00:19:08,088 --> 00:19:11,628
You saw the world differently
right from the start.

184
00:19:20,297 --> 00:19:22,047
Sometimes I think...

185
00:19:24,172 --> 00:19:26,342
that's what my problem is.

186
00:19:27,255 --> 00:19:31,455
I can't see the world
for what it actually is.

187
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:38,378
I think I did something
very, very stupid.

188
00:19:39,838 --> 00:19:41,418
What do you mean?

189
00:19:44,047 --> 00:19:46,087
You know that film,

190
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:50,170
where the kid and the old man

191
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:53,165
traveled back in time with his car?

192
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,420
I know it sounds crazy,

193
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,590
but...

194
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:03,297
the stuff in the film,

195
00:20:05,463 --> 00:20:06,843
it really exists.

196
00:20:08,547 --> 00:20:10,127
Time travel.

197
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:15,955
And somehow...

198
00:20:18,005 --> 00:20:19,755
It has to do with

199
00:20:19,838 --> 00:20:23,008
Mads and Helge, too.

200
00:20:24,463 --> 00:20:26,213
Everything.

201
00:20:26,297 --> 00:20:28,957
All the things that
happened so many years ago.

202
00:20:41,922 --> 00:20:43,382
Mr. Tiedemann.

203
00:20:43,922 --> 00:20:45,882
Mr. Tiedemann.

204
00:20:45,963 --> 00:20:48,303
There's a woman waiting in your office.

205
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,960
- Did she say why she's here?
- It's about the man in the asylum.

206
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:59,668
The lunatic who murdered those
kids. She says she knows him.

207
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:05,338
Thank you.

208
00:21:24,005 --> 00:21:25,085
Good day.

209
00:21:26,797 --> 00:21:28,087
Good day.

210
00:21:41,005 --> 00:21:42,665
What can I do for you?

211
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,920
I'm...

212
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,012
looking for my husband.

213
00:21:50,797 --> 00:21:52,627
It was in the papers.

214
00:21:53,505 --> 00:21:55,255
The dead children.

215
00:21:57,505 --> 00:21:59,125
There was a photo.

216
00:22:01,422 --> 00:22:03,462
I think that's my husband.

217
00:22:27,963 --> 00:22:29,463
Is this him?

218
00:22:33,463 --> 00:22:35,513
It looks like him.

219
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:38,838
We searched for relatives.
No one came forward.

220
00:22:40,588 --> 00:22:44,378
He was arrested last winter in
connection with multiple murders.

221
00:22:48,588 --> 00:22:50,208
Can I see him?

222
00:22:52,213 --> 00:22:54,133
It's not that straightforward.

223
00:22:55,755 --> 00:22:59,045
Right at this moment he's
in a psychiatric institution.

224
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,255
He won't talk.

225
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,300
I understand.

226
00:23:10,172 --> 00:23:12,212
But he could talk to me.

227
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,760
Could I ask what your name is?

228
00:23:23,172 --> 00:23:24,462
Nielsen.

229
00:23:25,755 --> 00:23:27,295
Katharina Nielsen.

230
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:43,632
Where were you all this time?

231
00:23:53,047 --> 00:23:55,207
I promised I would try
to make it all right.

232
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,960
I am so sorry.

233
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,170
It makes sense all of a sudden.

234
00:24:34,922 --> 00:24:37,422
It's obvious now that I understand.

235
00:24:48,338 --> 00:24:51,168
Hannah!

236
00:24:52,755 --> 00:24:54,455
Hannah, are you here?

237
00:24:56,005 --> 00:24:57,005
Hannah?

238
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,548
Hannah!

239
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,300
Wait, don't. Please.

240
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,090
Martha?

241
00:25:20,297 --> 00:25:22,547
Do you know who that is? Huh?

242
00:25:23,005 --> 00:25:25,125
Did he tell you where your brother is?

243
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:27,053
Who your brother is?

244
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,630
This guy

245
00:25:30,713 --> 00:25:32,633
is the son of your brother.

246
00:25:32,713 --> 00:25:34,803
My grandson, your nephew!

247
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:40,050
Mikkel is Michael Kahnwald,
do you understand?

248
00:25:41,213 --> 00:25:43,553
And you are his aunt!

249
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,005
Martha...

250
00:25:52,338 --> 00:25:54,008
I am so sorry.

251
00:25:56,672 --> 00:25:58,172
I'm sorry.

252
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,880
I...

253
00:26:00,963 --> 00:26:02,713
Believe me, I wanted...

254
00:26:02,797 --> 00:26:04,837
Where's your machine?

255
00:26:04,922 --> 00:26:07,462
The machine that makes
it possible to go there.

256
00:26:09,213 --> 00:26:10,763
Hannah has it.

257
00:26:11,505 --> 00:26:12,915
She disappeared.

258
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,960
Hannah?

259
00:26:22,422 --> 00:26:25,302
Tell me now how I can get Mikkel back!

260
00:26:27,297 --> 00:26:28,667
Mom.

261
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:30,545
Magnus has a time machine.

262
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,840
What?

263
00:26:32,422 --> 00:26:34,132
We used it. It works.

264
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,010
You were there?

265
00:26:39,588 --> 00:26:41,168
Did you see him?

266
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,420
Mikkel?

267
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,420
Keep your dirty hands off her.

268
00:26:53,047 --> 00:26:54,797
Do you hear me?

269
00:26:56,213 --> 00:26:57,593
Come on.

270
00:28:15,922 --> 00:28:17,592
What is this?

271
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:20,047
My brother.

272
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,010
He also disappeared.

273
00:28:22,838 --> 00:28:24,168
In '86.

274
00:28:27,422 --> 00:28:30,422
Quite similar to the
case with Mads Nielsen.

275
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:34,548
No trace.

276
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,297
Nothing.

277
00:28:38,088 --> 00:28:39,958
His name was also Aleksander.

278
00:28:41,297 --> 00:28:43,007
Aleksander Köhler.

279
00:28:45,213 --> 00:28:46,673
Just like you.

280
00:28:47,297 --> 00:28:48,457
Mm...

281
00:28:49,463 --> 00:28:51,053
A regular name.

282
00:28:54,797 --> 00:28:58,877
To be precise, there are over 700
Aleksander Köhlers in Germany.

283
00:28:59,963 --> 00:29:04,423
So it wasn't easy to track down
each and every Aleksander Köhler.

284
00:29:06,047 --> 00:29:07,457
Especially...

285
00:29:07,963 --> 00:29:10,713
someone who chose to take
the last name of their wife.

286
00:29:11,838 --> 00:29:14,338
Believe me, I'm speaking
from experience.

287
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:19,762
After my parents separated,
I took my mother's last name.

288
00:29:19,838 --> 00:29:21,668
From Köhler

289
00:29:21,755 --> 00:29:23,205
to Clausen.

290
00:29:24,297 --> 00:29:27,707
For some people I'm still
untraceable to this very day.

291
00:29:29,463 --> 00:29:30,763
But...

292
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:35,048
a couple of months ago...

293
00:29:37,213 --> 00:29:39,013
this happened.

294
00:30:02,213 --> 00:30:03,593
Read it.

295
00:30:03,963 --> 00:30:05,303
Out loud.

296
00:30:20,755 --> 00:30:22,665
"He that has eyes to see

297
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:24,915
and ears to hear

298
00:30:26,672 --> 00:30:30,462
may convince himself that
no mortal can keep a secret.

299
00:30:32,255 --> 00:30:34,085
If his lips are silent...

300
00:30:34,505 --> 00:30:37,755
- ... he chatters...
- ... he chatters with his fingertips.

301
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:40,882
- Betrayal oozes out of him...
- ... oozes...

302
00:30:40,963 --> 00:30:43,343
- ... out of him at every pore.
- ... at every pore.

303
00:30:45,755 --> 00:30:48,705
Answers about your brother
can be found in Winden."

304
00:30:51,422 --> 00:30:52,882
"A friend"

305
00:30:54,922 --> 00:30:56,592
I have no idea

306
00:30:57,797 --> 00:30:59,877
what's going on in this town.

307
00:31:07,463 --> 00:31:09,303
But I know one thing for sure.

308
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,460
You...

309
00:31:18,172 --> 00:31:20,422
... are definitely not my brother.

310
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,170
Your husband never confessed.

311
00:31:42,255 --> 00:31:45,415
He kept insisting that he
wanted to save the children.

312
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:48,713
You and your husband...

313
00:31:50,672 --> 00:31:52,462
You have children, yes?

314
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:54,463
No.

315
00:31:56,505 --> 00:31:57,705
No.

316
00:31:57,797 --> 00:31:59,257
That's strange.

317
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:03,458
He kept saying he was
looking for his son.

318
00:32:08,963 --> 00:32:11,303
This may sound a bit odd, but...

319
00:32:13,838 --> 00:32:17,208
have you ever heard
mention of a "White Devil"?

320
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,340
No.

321
00:32:22,422 --> 00:32:24,462
What is that?

322
00:32:29,088 --> 00:32:30,758
When he talks to you...

323
00:32:31,297 --> 00:32:33,337
I mean, if he talks to you,

324
00:32:34,505 --> 00:32:36,665
get him to talk to the police.

325
00:32:38,922 --> 00:32:41,632
See if you can convince
him to make a confession.

326
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,882
And that man came from the future?

327
00:32:47,963 --> 00:32:50,463
To 1953?

328
00:32:50,547 --> 00:32:52,627
That's when you arrested him.

329
00:32:52,713 --> 00:32:56,173
And yesterday that man tried to
run away with that little child?

330
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,510
No.

331
00:32:59,213 --> 00:33:00,803
Not that man.

332
00:33:02,172 --> 00:33:03,592
Not quite.

333
00:33:04,338 --> 00:33:06,758
The same man, but...

334
00:33:06,838 --> 00:33:08,458
much older.

335
00:33:08,547 --> 00:33:10,507
And you say the boy is his son?

336
00:33:13,838 --> 00:33:15,008
I know.

337
00:33:15,755 --> 00:33:17,705
It all sounds ridiculous.

338
00:33:18,547 --> 00:33:21,087
The man, the old one...

339
00:33:23,963 --> 00:33:25,883
where is he now?

340
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,760
They sent him back.

341
00:33:33,797 --> 00:33:35,917
That does it. You're living with us.

342
00:33:38,088 --> 00:33:39,958
We're getting your things.

343
00:33:41,338 --> 00:33:42,918
So you believe me.

344
00:33:50,463 --> 00:33:53,093
You traveled... with this?

345
00:33:57,172 --> 00:33:58,672
To what year?

346
00:34:01,463 --> 00:34:02,923
What year?

347
00:34:10,797 --> 00:34:12,707
That's what's going on.

348
00:34:13,422 --> 00:34:15,512
You knew about this time travel shit.

349
00:34:16,297 --> 00:34:18,127
Why didn't you say anything?

350
00:34:22,005 --> 00:34:23,375
Martha.

351
00:34:23,463 --> 00:34:24,763
Hey.

352
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:26,758
At Franziska's.

353
00:34:26,838 --> 00:34:29,008
Yes, I'll be home right away.

354
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,590
You what?

355
00:34:32,297 --> 00:34:33,587
Who?

356
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:43,877
Jonas is back.

357
00:34:45,213 --> 00:34:47,053
Just like Bartosz predicted.

358
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,920
But he's older.

359
00:34:56,838 --> 00:34:58,838
It's better if you stay out of this.

360
00:35:04,588 --> 00:35:06,088
This is ridiculous.

361
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,670
You both knew that too?

362
00:35:09,422 --> 00:35:11,842
This is what ruins everything!

363
00:35:11,922 --> 00:35:14,052
All of your secret fucking bullshit!

364
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,821
You didn't even try to talk to us

365
00:35:15,846 --> 00:35:18,074
when Papa and Benni slept together!

366
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,460
You incompetent asshole!

367
00:35:21,463 --> 00:35:22,803
Franziska...

368
00:35:36,422 --> 00:35:38,512
Open K-53!

369
00:35:55,338 --> 00:35:57,588
I'd like a moment
with him alone, please.

370
00:35:59,755 --> 00:36:02,335
Uh... I'm not sure if
that's such a good idea.

371
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,200
Please. For just five minutes.

372
00:36:08,338 --> 00:36:09,758
As you wish.

373
00:36:16,047 --> 00:36:17,377
Come.

374
00:36:49,672 --> 00:36:50,922
Ulrich?

375
00:37:00,797 --> 00:37:02,207
Ulrich.

376
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:07,508
Ulrich, it's me.

377
00:37:08,588 --> 00:37:09,838
Hannah.

378
00:37:12,088 --> 00:37:13,418
Hannah?

379
00:37:15,213 --> 00:37:16,843
Ulrich, it's me.

380
00:37:18,297 --> 00:37:19,957
Is it really you?

381
00:37:21,047 --> 00:37:22,257
Yes.

382
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:26,757
Or are you an angel?

383
00:37:28,047 --> 00:37:29,667
Are you an angel?

384
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:39,838
- Is it you?
- Yes.

385
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,918
It is you.

386
00:37:55,505 --> 00:37:57,335
Do you know where Mikkel is?

387
00:37:59,922 --> 00:38:02,262
Katharina. How is Katharina?

388
00:38:02,797 --> 00:38:04,457
Martha, Magnus?

389
00:38:13,172 --> 00:38:16,212
It feels so different
now, seeing you again.

390
00:38:20,088 --> 00:38:21,378
What?

391
00:38:23,755 --> 00:38:25,585
If you could choose today

392
00:38:26,963 --> 00:38:28,923
between Katharina and me...

393
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,380
What are you...

394
00:38:34,963 --> 00:38:36,593
What are you asking?

395
00:38:39,755 --> 00:38:42,795
In all the time you and
I were together, you...

396
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:46,172
I...

397
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:51,960
I can't really remember if you
ever once said to me, "I love you."

398
00:38:52,047 --> 00:38:53,457
I loved you.

399
00:38:56,838 --> 00:38:59,208
I still do, love you.

400
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,590
Get me out of here and
I'll leave Katharina.

401
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:09,378
I love you.

402
00:39:09,463 --> 00:39:10,883
Okay?

403
00:39:12,255 --> 00:39:13,795
I love you.

404
00:39:15,963 --> 00:39:18,213
He said I wouldn't need anyone.

405
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:21,375
But the truth is...

406
00:39:22,297 --> 00:39:23,917
you don't need me now.

407
00:39:24,005 --> 00:39:26,375
I do. I need you, Hannah.

408
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:27,763
I love you.

409
00:39:28,838 --> 00:39:30,628
Get me out of here.

410
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,170
I'll do anything you want.

411
00:39:34,255 --> 00:39:36,505
Get me out of here, please!

412
00:39:36,588 --> 00:39:38,298
Hannah, I love you.

413
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:40,508
You hear me?

414
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,510
I love you.

415
00:39:43,963 --> 00:39:46,053
Hannah. Please!

416
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,090
I love you!

417
00:39:48,172 --> 00:39:50,172
You lying fucker!

418
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:52,625
Please! Stay with me!

419
00:39:54,338 --> 00:39:56,048
Stay with me!

420
00:39:56,547 --> 00:39:58,297
I love you!

421
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,920
She's a liar!

422
00:40:00,005 --> 00:40:02,295
She's a liar. Liar!

423
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:05,128
There is a resemblance, but...

424
00:40:05,213 --> 00:40:08,133
Hannah! I love you!

425
00:40:08,213 --> 00:40:10,013
That's not my husband.

426
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,210
Hannah!

427
00:40:13,422 --> 00:40:15,512
I love you!

428
00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:24,052
Get me out of here!

429
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,420
Mom.

430
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,960
It'll work out.

431
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,130
Okay?

432
00:41:11,588 --> 00:41:13,708
You've got the machine?

433
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:40,957
Do you know how to use it?

434
00:41:41,755 --> 00:41:42,875
I...

435
00:41:43,547 --> 00:41:44,837
I don't know.

436
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:47,633
Bartosz used it.

437
00:42:08,547 --> 00:42:09,957
It's them.

438
00:42:12,547 --> 00:42:13,837
Mikkel...

439
00:42:14,922 --> 00:42:16,672
Dad, they're alive.

440
00:42:16,755 --> 00:42:17,755
What?

441
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:20,668
They're just not here.

442
00:42:22,255 --> 00:42:24,085
They're in another time.

443
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,800
Just grab your pills.
We'll get everything else later.

444
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,880
I'll be needing a minute.

445
00:42:44,505 --> 00:42:46,625
Come on, let's go.

446
00:42:49,255 --> 00:42:50,755
I've been...

447
00:42:51,922 --> 00:42:54,672
wondering why he returned to the cave.

448
00:42:57,713 --> 00:43:02,013
- Maybe there's something in the caves.
- Papa, give it a rest.

449
00:43:13,297 --> 00:43:15,547
He tried it in '53 as well.

450
00:43:17,797 --> 00:43:19,377
And now again.

451
00:43:20,505 --> 00:43:23,375
- Maybe there is something...
- That isn't true.

452
00:43:23,463 --> 00:43:24,993
But don't you think

453
00:43:25,018 --> 00:43:27,577
there has to be a reason that
he wanted to go in there?

454
00:43:33,672 --> 00:43:35,212
Can we leave?

455
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:52,258
Why are you really here?

456
00:43:54,255 --> 00:43:56,045
What are you saying?

457
00:43:56,922 --> 00:43:58,342
You knew this!

458
00:43:59,547 --> 00:44:01,127
I knew what?

459
00:44:01,213 --> 00:44:03,763
You know about time travel!

460
00:44:06,588 --> 00:44:08,668
The nuclear plant is connected to it.

461
00:44:08,755 --> 00:44:10,625
How about we go now?

462
00:44:15,005 --> 00:44:17,125
I know you're a part of this.

463
00:44:19,255 --> 00:44:20,755
Don't be ridiculous.

464
00:44:23,297 --> 00:44:25,837
We must have the caves searched, then.

465
00:44:25,922 --> 00:44:29,592
There's nothing in the caves!
There is no time travel!

466
00:44:48,088 --> 00:44:51,258
- What are you doing?
- Calling the station.

467
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:53,508
We have to go search the caves.

468
00:44:56,297 --> 00:44:57,667
You have no idea.

469
00:44:57,755 --> 00:45:01,415
The thing inside the caves is beyond
any other scientific discovery.

470
00:45:01,505 --> 00:45:04,875
It turns everything we know
about the universe upside down.

471
00:45:04,963 --> 00:45:08,963
And you're willing to
jeopardize that? For nothing?

472
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:14,510
You know, you haven't changed at all.

473
00:45:18,797 --> 00:45:21,707
You are all you've ever cared about.

474
00:45:24,047 --> 00:45:25,877
You have no heart!

475
00:45:30,047 --> 00:45:31,167
Let go.

476
00:45:31,255 --> 00:45:32,415
Let go!

477
00:45:42,088 --> 00:45:43,508
Oh, God. Dad.

478
00:45:45,547 --> 00:45:47,127
Stay right there.

479
00:45:49,172 --> 00:45:50,882
Don't move.

480
00:45:51,672 --> 00:45:52,882
I...

481
00:45:54,422 --> 00:45:56,132
I'll call an ambulance.

482
00:46:05,297 --> 00:46:06,707
Come on!

483
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,510
Come on!

484
00:46:10,588 --> 00:46:13,418
Winden Emergency
Services, how can I help you?

485
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:15,755
Hello?

486
00:46:16,588 --> 00:46:17,588
Hello...

487
00:46:35,922 --> 00:46:37,712
"There will be sacrifices.

488
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:43,512
Everything will happen as it always has.

489
00:46:44,088 --> 00:46:46,668
But if everything goes
right, she will live."

490
00:46:47,755 --> 00:46:49,165
Regina.

491
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,050
I'm so sorry.

492
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:21,300
You are the White Devil.

493
00:47:50,422 --> 00:47:52,422
You're sure that's not your husband?

494
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:03,335
I, um...

495
00:48:04,088 --> 00:48:06,298
should've reacted sooner.

496
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:11,630
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right. Really.

497
00:48:16,588 --> 00:48:17,958
Nielsen...

498
00:48:19,588 --> 00:48:21,128
That is an...

499
00:48:22,297 --> 00:48:23,587
unusual name.

500
00:48:23,672 --> 00:48:25,842
Do you know an Agnes Nielsen?

501
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:27,920
No.

502
00:48:34,255 --> 00:48:36,545
Are you traveling back today?

503
00:48:41,422 --> 00:48:43,842
I lost everything I had at home.

504
00:48:46,297 --> 00:48:48,507
I'm just looking for a fresh start.

505
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:42,423
Sleeping over at a friend's, R.

506
00:53:01,713 --> 00:53:03,133
Who are you?

507
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:05,630
Why do you have a key to my house?

508
00:53:06,588 --> 00:53:09,088
You made me take it before you left me.

509
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:11,760
No, I didn't.

510
00:53:13,297 --> 00:53:15,257
I've never seen you before.

511
00:53:26,297 --> 00:53:28,507
I know who you got it from.

512
00:53:30,338 --> 00:53:31,628
My older self.

513
00:53:34,088 --> 00:53:37,758
We need to go. We don't have much time.

514
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:38,958
I don't understand.

515
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,710
I know what you've done.

516
00:53:57,588 --> 00:53:59,338
She told me.

517
00:54:12,713 --> 00:54:16,513
But she also said it
didn't have to happen again.

518
00:54:20,047 --> 00:54:21,797
Next time.

519
00:54:32,505 --> 00:54:33,955
Where are we going?

520
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,420
To the future.
