
1
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:45,244
There's a big gap.

2
00:00:49,147 --> 00:00:51,323
This feels like the only route,
let's keep going.

3
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:58,395
You okay?

4
00:01:01,531 --> 00:01:03,291
It's all right, kid.
Never be easy.

5
00:01:04,571 --> 00:01:05,660
Okay.

6
00:01:07,163 --> 00:01:08,323
- One...
- Be careful.

7
00:01:08,347 --> 00:01:09,947
...two, three!

8
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:12,795
You okay?

9
00:01:12,827 --> 00:01:14,236
Okay.

10
00:01:15,995 --> 00:01:17,276
Oh, my God.

11
00:01:17,308 --> 00:01:18,308
Never better.

12
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,020
Okay.

13
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:29,435
Whoa, whoa, you're good.
Shit.

14
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:30,587
You're good.
Yeah?

15
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,259
You're good?

16
00:01:32,603 --> 00:01:34,075
No.

17
00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:36,476
Okay, you've done
way scarier than this.

18
00:01:36,508 --> 00:01:38,875
Remember A.J. Hackett, Snake Dike.

19
00:01:38,908 --> 00:01:40,699
Stupid singing competition.

20
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:42,044
God, you married this sad sack,

21
00:01:42,076 --> 00:01:43,931
for Christ's sake.

22
00:01:43,964 --> 00:01:45,691
Yeah? Okay.
Okay.

23
00:01:46,555 --> 00:01:48,923
One...
Two...

24
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,908
Three!

25
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,500
Come on! I got you.

26
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:54,652
That's my girl.

27
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:59,324
Ew! Gross!

28
00:01:59,356 --> 00:02:01,019
You guys, get a room!

29
00:02:02,524 --> 00:02:04,348
Here comes Ethan Hunt.

30
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:06,619
Careful, H, there's loose
rock around the elbow.

31
00:02:06,651 --> 00:02:08,956
Worry about your ropes, bitches.

32
00:02:08,987 --> 00:02:10,459
I'm fine.

33
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:12,443
Whoo!

34
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:13,883
Try to keep up!

35
00:02:23,899 --> 00:02:26,875
Taking your time there, hotshot.

36
00:02:26,908 --> 00:02:29,723
Hunter, you show off!

37
00:02:29,755 --> 00:02:30,811
Whoo!

38
00:03:06,427 --> 00:03:07,612
Dan!

39
00:03:11,003 --> 00:03:12,124
Dan!

40
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:14,915
Hold on, Dan.
Hold on, I'm coming.

41
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:16,156
Dan, are you okay?

42
00:03:16,187 --> 00:03:19,067
Just hold on.
I'm coming down.

43
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,595
Come on. Come on.
I can't make it.

44
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:23,771
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, Becky, Becky.

45
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,060
I just need
a little more length.

46
00:03:25,084 --> 00:03:27,323
Can you un-clip?
Are you secure?

47
00:03:27,355 --> 00:03:28,732
Are you secure?
Yeah.

48
00:03:28,763 --> 00:03:30,427
Yeah, I'm... I'm secure.

49
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,323
Just un-clip and I'll be able
to swing to the rock.

50
00:03:32,347 --> 00:03:34,075
- Okay.
- I think I can reach it.

51
00:03:34,108 --> 00:03:35,131
Ready?

52
00:03:39,484 --> 00:03:40,731
Can you reach it?

53
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:42,076
Just...
Just one second.

54
00:03:42,107 --> 00:03:43,579
All right.
I think I can make it.

55
00:03:43,611 --> 00:03:45,052
Hold on, Dan.

56
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,459
I'm almost there.

57
00:03:46,491 --> 00:03:47,524
Just need
a little more momentum.

58
00:03:47,548 --> 00:03:48,635
Okay.

59
00:03:49,371 --> 00:03:50,843
No!

60
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,788
Dan!

61
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:19,204
<i>Hey!</i>

62
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:20,356
<i>Hey, this is Becky and Dan.</i>

63
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,275
<i>Leave a message.</i>

64
00:04:21,307 --> 00:04:23,387
<i>Hey, Becky, it's me.</i>

65
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,035
<i>Look, I've tried to console you
every way I know how.</i>

66
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,635
<i>But I...</i>

67
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:31,867
<i>I can't help you
if you don't pick up the phone.</i>

68
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,459
<i>Sweetheart,
I'm worried about you.</i>

69
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:36,379
<i>So whenever
you stop hating on me,</i>

70
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:38,651
<i>I am here.</i>

71
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,068
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

72
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,891
<i>This is just the voice mail.</i>

73
00:05:12,923 --> 00:05:14,267
<i>You've reached Dan.</i>

74
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,067
<i>Just leave a message,
I'll hit you back when I can.</i>

75
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:17,788
<i>Get it off at the beep.</i>

76
00:05:18,683 --> 00:05:19,771
Hey.

77
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:22,747
Miss you.

78
00:05:30,652 --> 00:05:33,628
Dad, what?
Are you stalking me now?

79
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:35,356
No, I just don't know
what else to do,

80
00:05:35,387 --> 00:05:37,019
'cause you're not
answering your phone.

81
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:38,396
Take a hint.

82
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:39,747
I... I think this is getting
a little bit ridiculous.

83
00:05:39,771 --> 00:05:41,212
"Ridiculous"?

84
00:05:41,243 --> 00:05:43,804
You told me I shouldn't be
so broken up about him,

85
00:05:43,835 --> 00:05:45,820
because he was an asshole. No.

86
00:05:45,851 --> 00:05:47,780
I said that maybe he didn't
belong on this pedestal

87
00:05:47,804 --> 00:05:49,595
that you were putting him up on,

88
00:05:49,627 --> 00:05:51,812
that he wasn't this martyr that
you've been making him out to be.

89
00:05:51,836 --> 00:05:53,564
This is how
you console your daughter?

90
00:05:53,596 --> 00:05:55,739
I just want you to be able
to move on with your life.

91
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,867
I don't want to move on.
I miss him!

92
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:02,075
Every day, I miss the way
he looked at me.

93
00:06:02,107 --> 00:06:03,299
I miss the way he made me feel.

94
00:06:03,323 --> 00:06:04,323
Sweetie.
Don't!

95
00:06:04,348 --> 00:06:05,691
Don't what?

96
00:06:05,723 --> 00:06:07,292
What do you think
you're doing, Becky?

97
00:06:07,324 --> 00:06:09,028
Getting away from you.
You are not driving. Stop it.

98
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:10,491
Fuck off!

99
00:06:10,523 --> 00:06:12,028
You don't get to
talk to me like that.

100
00:06:12,059 --> 00:06:14,876
Your mother and I, we
raised you better than that.

101
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:16,667
So getting shit-faced

102
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,195
and pushing the people away
that love you,

103
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:21,148
it's not gonna work.

104
00:06:21,179 --> 00:06:22,204
All right, look,

105
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:24,859
a horrible thing
happened to you,

106
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:27,004
but you have to start
living your life again.

107
00:06:27,035 --> 00:06:28,667
All right?

108
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:30,116
There's a whole big wide
world out there that needs you

109
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,804
and believe it or not,
I need you.

110
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,684
Let me give you a ride home.

111
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:37,948
I'd rather walk.

112
00:06:41,308 --> 00:06:42,556
Let me ask you something.

113
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:45,275
If roles reversed,

114
00:06:45,307 --> 00:06:48,028
if it had been you
that had fallen that day,

115
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:50,011
do you think Dan
is standing out here alone?

116
00:06:50,044 --> 00:06:52,828
Drowning in booze,
grief, sorrow,

117
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:54,748
whatever the hell this is?

118
00:06:56,027 --> 00:06:57,916
He's not.

119
00:06:57,947 --> 00:06:59,548
And you damn well know it.

120
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,195
God damn it, Becky,
I need you to try.

121
00:07:05,596 --> 00:07:07,547
Do you know what I need, Dad?

122
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,659
I need you to leave me alone.

123
00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:19,076
God damn it.

124
00:07:27,676 --> 00:07:29,828
<i>The number
you have called has been disconnected.</i>

125
00:07:32,027 --> 00:07:33,211
No.

126
00:07:34,171 --> 00:07:35,356
No!

127
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,836
Hi!
Hey.

128
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:18,491
You look, um...

129
00:08:18,524 --> 00:08:19,995
Awful.
Yeah.

130
00:08:20,027 --> 00:08:21,628
Yeah, like
really freakin' awful.

131
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:23,035
Well, come here.

132
00:08:26,524 --> 00:08:29,755
So, what brings you back?

133
00:08:29,788 --> 00:08:31,196
Are you finally ready to rest?

134
00:08:32,252 --> 00:08:33,916
I'll rest when I'm dead.

135
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,275
I have something that's planned.

136
00:08:37,307 --> 00:08:38,716
And I need a partner in crime.

137
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:44,315
Look, your dad called me
a few weeks ago.

138
00:08:44,347 --> 00:08:46,011
He didn't know
who else to turn to.

139
00:08:46,043 --> 00:08:47,995
And he said that
you were in a bad place.

140
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,204
He had no right to do that.
He's worried about you.

141
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:51,388
It's coming up on a year.

142
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:53,627
He doesn't want you to be alone.

143
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:55,579
Look, the only thing
that drives me crazier

144
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:58,427
than Dan's boxed ashes
collecting dust in there,

145
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:01,435
is my best friend
stuck in here with him.

146
00:09:01,468 --> 00:09:03,644
So I have something
that I wanna pitch you.

147
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:04,732
You're not gonna like it,

148
00:09:04,763 --> 00:09:06,524
but just try to keep
an open mind.

149
00:09:06,556 --> 00:09:07,708
Look...

150
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:12,923
The B-67 TV Tower.

151
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:14,843
It's only a six-hour drive
from here.

152
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,795
I was planning on
climbing it this weekend

153
00:09:16,828 --> 00:09:18,940
and I wanted to see
if you'd climb it with me.

154
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,515
It would be an adventure,

155
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:26,587
like old times.

156
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,571
And you could scatter
Dan's ashes on top.

157
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:32,284
I just...
I haven't climbed since...

158
00:09:32,315 --> 00:09:33,315
I get it.

159
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,260
But if you don't
confront your fears,

160
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,819
you are always
going to be afraid.

161
00:09:38,939 --> 00:09:40,603
What is it that Dan used to say?

162
00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:44,603
Don't die if you wanna live

163
00:09:44,635 --> 00:09:47,036
or keep living
even if you're dying.

164
00:09:47,068 --> 00:09:48,796
Shit, I feel like
I'm messing this pitch up.

165
00:09:48,827 --> 00:09:50,587
No, I'm sorry.

166
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,123
Hunter, I just... I can't.

167
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:56,251
It's like I know I
can't do it, I'm sorry.

168
00:09:56,284 --> 00:09:57,979
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

169
00:09:58,011 --> 00:09:59,899
I can't.
Hey, hey, it's okay.

170
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:01,787
It's okay.

171
00:10:38,747 --> 00:10:40,123
Morning, princess.

172
00:10:42,427 --> 00:10:44,603
What's wrong?

173
00:10:44,636 --> 00:10:46,907
"If you're scared of dying,
don't be afraid to live."

174
00:10:48,859 --> 00:10:50,363
That's what Dan used to say.

175
00:10:52,156 --> 00:10:53,788
Let's do it.

176
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:57,020
Let's climb your stupid tower.

177
00:10:57,052 --> 00:10:59,003
Oh, my God, Becky,
baby, I'm so excited!

178
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:08,540
I've never actually seen this video.

179
00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:11,835
Shit, I was really ripped.

180
00:11:11,867 --> 00:11:14,075
Yeah!
You're awesome.

181
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,124
That is the Becky
that we need for this trip.

182
00:11:18,587 --> 00:11:19,804
Aw!

183
00:11:19,835 --> 00:11:22,811
Holy shit!
Look at your beaming face.

184
00:11:22,844 --> 00:11:24,539
Now, who's this
in the photo with you?

185
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:26,491
I don't know.
It's an oldie.

186
00:11:26,524 --> 00:11:28,604
Who is it?
Nobody.

187
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:30,460
Just give it back.
Hunter has a boyfriend.

188
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:32,540
It's nothing.
Just some guy.

189
00:11:32,572 --> 00:11:35,164
Oh, that some guy sure knew
how to tickle your whistle.

190
00:11:47,548 --> 00:11:48,932
<i>Yo, what's up, guys?</i>

191
00:11:48,956 --> 00:11:51,323
<i>Danger D,
and I'm back stateside, yo,</i>

192
00:11:51,355 --> 00:11:53,211
<i>hashtag, super badass.</i>

193
00:11:53,243 --> 00:11:55,580
Okay, in my defense,

194
00:11:55,612 --> 00:11:57,628
I may act like
a total dick on camera,

195
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:58,659
but it's worth it.

196
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,220
I get paid for this shit.

197
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:02,332
It's enough to keep me
traveling and you know me,

198
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:04,955
I have to be doing dangerous
shit to keep my blood pumping,

199
00:12:04,987 --> 00:12:06,875
so I might as well
monetize that.

200
00:12:06,907 --> 00:12:09,595
I'm just saying if you're
gonna be a YouTuber,

201
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,483
why not be yourself?
You are awesome.

202
00:12:11,515 --> 00:12:13,948
Natural born click-bait.
No.

203
00:12:13,979 --> 00:12:17,147
What we're doing here,
this is clickbait.

204
00:12:20,251 --> 00:12:22,204
Excuse me?

205
00:12:22,235 --> 00:12:24,187
Do you have somewhere
I could charge my phone?

206
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,915
Power ain't free, ma'am.

207
00:12:25,948 --> 00:12:29,020
Oh, and do you know
where the B-67 TV Tower is?

208
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:30,171
We can't find it on the map.

209
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,531
You don't need a map.

210
00:12:33,563 --> 00:12:34,940
You see that light way up there?

211
00:12:36,635 --> 00:12:38,363
That's your tower.

212
00:12:38,395 --> 00:12:40,348
That's insanely high.

213
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:44,027
What's with the light?

214
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:44,955
I thought you said
it was out of commission.

215
00:12:44,987 --> 00:12:47,324
So aircraft can see it.

216
00:12:47,356 --> 00:12:49,755
You know, this was once
the tallest structure in the U.S.

217
00:12:51,196 --> 00:12:53,788
Now it's just this old relic.

218
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:55,771
They're due to tear it down
next winter.

219
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,555
Becky?

220
00:12:58,588 --> 00:13:00,411
Becky?

221
00:13:00,443 --> 00:13:02,363
What?
Give me your phone charger.

222
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:04,444
What are you doing?

223
00:13:06,716 --> 00:13:08,444
A very cool life hack.

224
00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:12,220
Now I'm just gonna
line up the prongs

225
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,236
with the elements in the lamp.

226
00:13:14,267 --> 00:13:15,292
And...

227
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:19,675
How's that for a dumb YouTuber?

228
00:13:38,811 --> 00:13:41,020
Hey, honey.

229
00:13:41,051 --> 00:13:42,875
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you sleep well?

230
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,979
I love you.

231
00:13:55,228 --> 00:13:56,987
You're not gonna say it back?

232
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,300
I am saying it.

233
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:01,187
One...

234
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,323
Four...

235
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:05,891
Three...

236
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,092
I love you.

237
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:30,523
Hey, come on, Becks.
Sun's up.

238
00:14:37,724 --> 00:14:39,580
What up, <i>El Capitan?</i>

239
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:42,491
I don't know, but something's
up, <i>Sports Illustrated.</i>

240
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:43,524
Tits for clicks.

241
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,532
Are you live streaming?

242
00:14:49,564 --> 00:14:51,707
No, dude.
Shoot now, post later.

243
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:53,084
Oh, good.
I don't wanna be in it.

244
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:57,212
<i>Hey, guys.

245
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:59,996

<i>totally bat shit crazy

249
00:15:08,668 --> 00:15:12,412
<i>The B-67 TV Tower.</i>

250

<i>This bad boy is
over 2,000 feet tall.</i>

251
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:17,276
<i>And your home girls</i>

252
00:15:17,308 --> 00:15:19,900

254
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:24,851
<i>Watch out!</i>

255
00:15:31,484 --> 00:15:33,596
Holy shit!

256
00:15:33,628 --> 00:15:34,652
Whoo!

257
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:36,795
<i>Eight more lives, baby!</i>

258
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:12,771
Shit.

259
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:22,939
Looks like
we're walking from here.

260
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:24,795
How far?
I don't know.

261
00:16:27,131 --> 00:16:29,084
Like a mile?

262
00:16:29,116 --> 00:16:30,299
Maybe two-ish?

263
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,700
Damn, it's hot.

264
00:16:36,731 --> 00:16:38,876
You'll cool down
once we get some air time.

265
00:16:40,348 --> 00:16:41,603
We've got enough water, you think?

266
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:43,995
Water's check.
Harnesses check.

267
00:16:44,027 --> 00:16:46,427
<i>Super badass 4K drone check.</i>

268

<i>Selfie stick,
all the essentials.</i>

269
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:50,300
Food?

270
00:16:50,332 --> 00:16:51,364
Nah, we'll be back in time
before lunch...

271
00:16:51,388 --> 00:16:53,084
Oh, Jesus.

272
00:16:56,827 --> 00:16:57,947
<i>Holy shit, they're big.</i>

273
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,348
It's still alive.

274
00:17:04,379 --> 00:17:05,467
Get off of him!

275
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,003
Hey! Hey!
Go away!

276
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:09,275
Just go. Go!

277
00:17:16,124 --> 00:17:17,339
Poor thing.

278
00:17:21,212 --> 00:17:22,491
Pricks.

279
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:25,820
<i>Survival of the fittest, right?</i>

280
00:17:27,707 --> 00:17:29,660
You'd do the same
if you were starving out here.

281
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,692
"Feeling peckish."
Hunter.

282
00:17:33,724 --> 00:17:35,164
What?

283
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:36,284
That's funny.

284
00:17:49,595 --> 00:17:51,515
Holy shit, 300 likes.

285
00:17:51,547 --> 00:17:52,828
Oh, wow.

286
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:56,251
350.

287
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,724
I wonder how many of
your followers are serial killers.

288
00:18:01,084 --> 00:18:02,300
Holy shit.

289
00:18:03,868 --> 00:18:05,755
Looks a lot bigger
up close, right?

290
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:09,691
This is sick.

291
00:18:11,387 --> 00:18:12,764
This is awful.

292
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,419
Hey, guys!

293
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:17,308
Danger D here.

294
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:21,019
And we are at the foot of this
stomach-churningly massive

295
00:18:21,051 --> 00:18:23,420
fourth-highest structure
in the U.S.

296
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:25,755
<i>We're gonna begin
our grueling journey</i>

297
00:18:25,787 --> 00:18:28,124
<i>with an 1,800-foot ladder climb</i>

298
00:18:28,156 --> 00:18:30,619
inside a steel cage.

299
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,835
And then after the cage...

300
00:18:33,244 --> 00:18:35,963
...we have a 200-foot,
vertigo-inspiring mast

301
00:18:35,996 --> 00:18:37,627
with an external ladder.

302
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,507
Your girl's gonna be wide open
to the elements.

303
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,420
And then beyond that,
we have the precipice.

304
00:18:43,451 --> 00:18:46,427
<i>The ledge.
The top of the world, Ma.</i>

305
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,460
<i>Hunter?</i>

306
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,788
I'm sorry.
I can't do it.

307
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:55,228
Babe, of course you can.

308
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,020
No, um, I really can't.
I'm, like...

309
00:18:58,108 --> 00:18:59,771
I'm petrified.
I'm, like, shaking.

310
00:19:00,796 --> 00:19:01,820
I'm here.

311
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,411
Take a breath.

312
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,340
After Dan died, I was
afraid of my own shadow.

313
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:12,284
But I pushed through.

314
00:19:12,316 --> 00:19:14,875
I overcame the fear.
I took control.

315
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,844
Do not let this fear
consume you.

316
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,820
Come at it head on
and kick its ass.

317
00:19:21,851 --> 00:19:24,923
If you can beat it,
you can beat anything.

318
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:28,219
And I'm right here
beside you the whole time.

319
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:32,284
You are so much stronger
than you think you are.

320
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:35,035
So shut your shit.

321
00:19:35,068 --> 00:19:36,251
And let's do this.

322
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:40,060
God, Hunter.

323
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:41,755
You know,
that's the kind of shit

324
00:19:41,788 --> 00:19:43,259
you should be posting
on Instagram.

325
00:19:44,219 --> 00:19:45,219
Come on.

326
00:19:49,403 --> 00:19:51,644
Dude, this is so cool.

327
00:19:51,676 --> 00:19:53,147
Holy shit.

328
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:56,955
Look at this.

329
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:59,835
Damn it, Hunter.
You are such an asshole.

330
00:20:00,955 --> 00:20:02,300
What are you getting us into?

331
00:20:02,332 --> 00:20:03,452
Don't worry.

332
00:20:03,484 --> 00:20:05,691
We've got 50 feet of rope
between us.

333
00:20:05,723 --> 00:20:07,579
We're clipped in
and we're all good.

334
00:20:08,764 --> 00:20:09,947
Okay.

335
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,387
One rung at a time,

336
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,819
and let me know
if you have to rest.

337
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:44,380
Okay, okay.

338
00:20:53,116 --> 00:20:54,555
See?

339
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,675
It's easy.

340
00:20:59,387 --> 00:21:00,475
Sure.

341
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:03,932
You're doing great.
Come on.

342
00:21:46,844 --> 00:21:47,996
You okay?

343
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:50,716
No.

344
00:21:52,315 --> 00:21:53,371
You're doing great.

345
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:54,819
Come on.

346
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,940
Hunter?

347
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,028
Hunter?
Yeah?

348
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:37,916
Can we rest a moment?

349
00:22:37,948 --> 00:22:39,323
I need a drink.

350
00:22:39,355 --> 00:22:40,355
Of course.

351
00:22:42,716 --> 00:22:44,507
Those guy lines means
we're halfway up.

352
00:22:48,604 --> 00:22:49,755
Perfect spot.

353
00:22:51,323 --> 00:22:52,891
Wanna know something crazy?

354
00:22:54,076 --> 00:22:55,067
What?

355
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,731
Halfway up.

356
00:22:56,764 --> 00:22:59,548
That means we've
climbed about 1,000 feet.

357
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:01,691
So we've climbed the height
of the Eiffel Tower.

358
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:04,819
Please don't say
shit like that, Hunter.

359
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,387
Whoa!

360
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,204
There's the motel.
And the diner.

361
00:23:10,235 --> 00:23:13,340
No way.
Looks like a little toy town.

362
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:19,579
Let's just get this over with.

363
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:20,611
Yeah.

364
00:23:24,124 --> 00:23:25,403
Come on.

365
00:23:25,435 --> 00:23:26,435
Catch up.

366
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,715
That's it.

367
00:23:46,747 --> 00:23:48,508
Becky, you're doing amazing.

368
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:53,275
Come on!

369
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:54,491
Come on, Becky!

370
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,635
Okay.

371
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:14,939
This is the end
of the internal ladder.

372
00:24:14,972 --> 00:24:17,211
One step at a time, okay.
You got this.

373
00:24:18,844 --> 00:24:22,011
The next 200 feet is external.

374
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,195
I'm not gonna lie.

375
00:24:23,227 --> 00:24:24,484
It's gonna get
a little bit crazy

376
00:24:24,508 --> 00:24:26,075
when we're out of the cage
in the open.

377
00:24:26,107 --> 00:24:27,164
But don't panic.

378
00:24:38,651 --> 00:24:40,251
Hunter.

379
00:24:40,283 --> 00:24:41,531
Hunter!

380
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,099
Hunter!
Hunter!

381
00:24:43,131 --> 00:24:45,500
Becky! You gotta come up.
It's so sick!

382
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,316
Okay.

383
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:02,299
Hunter?

384
00:25:02,331 --> 00:25:03,644
I'm here.

385
00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:05,435
It's just like 200 feet more,
that's all.

386
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:07,067
I can't!

387
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:08,507
Yes, you can!

388
00:25:09,371 --> 00:25:12,187
Just look up and only up.

389
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:19,259
You're doing great.
You got this.

390
00:25:22,427 --> 00:25:23,427
Okay.

391
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:24,867
Okay.

392
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:36,867
Okay.

393
00:25:57,371 --> 00:25:59,195
Yeah!
You're killing it!

394
00:25:59,227 --> 00:26:00,227
Whoo!

395
00:26:04,124 --> 00:26:05,124
You're okay.

396
00:26:06,587 --> 00:26:08,156
Remember, only look up.

397
00:26:14,395 --> 00:26:15,740
What the hell are we doing?

398
00:26:16,411 --> 00:26:17,723
Hey!

399
00:26:17,756 --> 00:26:19,387
Stop over thinking.

400
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,148
- How?
- I don't know.

401
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,548
Concentrate on
something else, like...

402
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:27,227
Sing a, a nursery rhyme
or some shit.

403
00:26:30,332 --> 00:26:31,675
Okay, okay.

404
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:33,851
Okay.

405
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:36,092
<i>♪ Ring around the roses ♪</i>

406
00:26:36,124 --> 00:26:38,684
<i>♪ Pocket full of posies ♪</i>

407
00:26:38,716 --> 00:26:42,460
<i>♪ Ashes, ashes
We all fall down ♪</i>

408
00:26:42,491 --> 00:26:44,091
Down!

409
00:26:45,307 --> 00:26:46,588
I wouldn't have picked that one.

410
00:26:48,187 --> 00:26:49,819
Wow.

411
00:26:49,851 --> 00:26:51,419
Okay.
Okay, Becks,

412
00:26:51,452 --> 00:26:54,683
this is gonna look a
little bit worse than it is.

413
00:26:54,715 --> 00:26:57,499
Ah, what the hell, Hunter?
Let's just go back down!

414
00:27:02,012 --> 00:27:05,243
Becky, if I let you go back now,

415
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:06,524
fear wins.

416
00:27:06,556 --> 00:27:09,115
And I'm not going
to let that happen.

417
00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:43,900
It's okay, Becks.

418
00:27:45,884 --> 00:27:46,876
It's okay.

419
00:27:46,907 --> 00:27:48,315
I've got your weight.

420
00:27:50,395 --> 00:27:52,283
Thanks. Okay.

421
00:28:09,116 --> 00:28:10,459
Reach up.

422
00:28:10,491 --> 00:28:11,524
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah.

423
00:28:19,355 --> 00:28:20,540
Okay.

424
00:28:20,572 --> 00:28:23,131
Smooth as sailing
to the top now.

425
00:28:23,164 --> 00:28:24,187
You got this.

426
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,828
I actually really
do hate you, Hunter.

427
00:28:30,172 --> 00:28:32,027
Hey, does this ladder
feel loose to you?

428
00:28:35,515 --> 00:28:37,403
Stop, you dick, Hunter!

429
00:28:37,435 --> 00:28:39,259
Sorry.

430
00:28:44,987 --> 00:28:48,091
What was that?

431
00:28:48,124 --> 00:28:50,396
Come on, we're almost there.

432
00:28:54,044 --> 00:28:55,771
Come on.
Okay.

433
00:29:24,604 --> 00:29:25,604
Wow.

434
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:31,235
Becky, you're not gonna
believe this.

435
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:32,619
You gotta come up here.
I'm coming.

436
00:29:34,492 --> 00:29:36,059
- Okay.
- Whoo!

437
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:38,044
Okay.

438
00:29:42,683 --> 00:29:43,683
Hunter.

439
00:29:51,004 --> 00:29:52,667
Hey, trust me.

440
00:29:54,812 --> 00:29:55,995
Okay, okay.

441
00:30:06,236 --> 00:30:07,867
Fuck, Becky!

442
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,691
Oh, I'm here.
Oh, my God.

443
00:30:18,395 --> 00:30:20,091
Oh, my God.

444
00:30:20,123 --> 00:30:21,436
We did it, Becks!

445
00:30:21,467 --> 00:30:22,523
I knew you could.

446
00:30:23,387 --> 00:30:24,859
Whoo!

447
00:30:41,243 --> 00:30:42,683
Whoo!

448
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:46,907
Here we go!

449
00:30:50,396 --> 00:30:52,348
On top of the goddamn world!

450
00:30:52,379 --> 00:30:53,819
Whoo!

451
00:30:56,987 --> 00:30:58,491
Do you wanna try?

452
00:31:00,604 --> 00:31:01,820
Shit!
Hunter, stop!

453
00:31:01,852 --> 00:31:03,580
Just focus on
getting a good shot.

454
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,404
I didn't wear this
stupid bra for nothing.

455
00:31:05,435 --> 00:31:06,524
No.

456
00:31:06,556 --> 00:31:07,676
No, Hunter.
Whoo!

457
00:31:10,043 --> 00:31:11,099
Swoop it around!

458
00:31:13,499 --> 00:31:15,004
Seize your day!

459
00:31:15,035 --> 00:31:17,147
Okay.
Oh, my God.

460
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,107
How'd it look?

461
00:31:30,139 --> 00:31:32,411
Insane! Insane.
Crazy.

462
00:31:33,947 --> 00:31:36,508
Let's get this bad boy back.

463
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:40,124
Holy shit, so sick, dude.

464
00:31:40,156 --> 00:31:42,779
Okay.
Now the ultimate, Becks.

465
00:31:42,811 --> 00:31:44,027
Your turn.

466
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,684
What?
No.

467
00:31:50,716 --> 00:31:52,571
Do you want to kick fear
in the dick or not?

468
00:31:52,604 --> 00:31:56,059
No. No, Hunter.

469
00:31:56,091 --> 00:31:57,947
The old Becky
would have done it.

470
00:31:59,516 --> 00:32:01,499
Just saying...
Dude.

471
00:32:01,532 --> 00:32:03,931
Here.
I'll hold your hand.

472
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:11,099
Okay.
Yeah?

473
00:32:11,132 --> 00:32:12,411
Okay.

474
00:32:13,052 --> 00:32:14,684
Shit.

475
00:32:14,716 --> 00:32:16,348
Come on, come on!

476
00:32:17,692 --> 00:32:19,099
You can do this.

477
00:32:21,724 --> 00:32:23,035
You can do it.

478
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:26,204
Okay, okay, okay.

479
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:29,084
- I got you.
- Okay.

480
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:30,619
Okay.
Whoa!

481
00:32:30,651 --> 00:32:32,132
- You can trust me.
- Whoa, okay.

482
00:32:32,156 --> 00:32:33,892
- I've got you, Becks.
- Oh, my God.

483
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:36,339
Careful over the ledge.

484
00:32:37,435 --> 00:32:39,195
Take it easy.

485
00:32:39,227 --> 00:32:41,692
Okay, I've got you.
I've got you.

486
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,180
Open your eyes.

487
00:32:51,323 --> 00:32:53,755
Whoo-hoo!

488
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:01,660
Okay, just one more.

489
00:33:06,203 --> 00:33:08,188
You're coming up right now.

490
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:13,147
My God, you did it.

491
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,964
You did it!
You did it, you idiot.

492
00:33:18,683 --> 00:33:20,860
Yes!
Look.

493
00:33:20,891 --> 00:33:23,003
Look how amazing these are.
Oh, my God.

494
00:33:23,036 --> 00:33:24,860
Whoa!

495
00:33:28,283 --> 00:33:31,324
Next time you are
ever afraid of anything,

496
00:33:31,355 --> 00:33:33,051
I want you to look at these

497
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:34,971
and know that you have
nothing to be afraid of.

498
00:33:36,508 --> 00:33:39,100
Thank you.
Yeah.

499
00:33:39,131 --> 00:33:40,603
I'm really proud of you.

500
00:33:41,755 --> 00:33:43,067
Dan would be, too.

501
00:33:47,003 --> 00:33:48,003
Yeah.

502
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:57,083
Okay.

503
00:33:58,043 --> 00:33:59,420
Okay, it's time.

504
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:36,700
You and I were one, Dan.

505
00:34:38,395 --> 00:34:40,187
And whenever I needed a laugh,

506
00:34:41,467 --> 00:34:43,995
you told me
one of your shit jokes.

507
00:34:48,955 --> 00:34:50,779
And whenever I needed
a shoulder to cry on,

508
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:51,868
it was yours.

509
00:34:55,004 --> 00:34:57,020
And now you're gone and I'm...

510
00:35:00,443 --> 00:35:02,363
I don't feel whole anymore.

511
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:11,099
I miss you, um,
just so much and I'm...

512
00:35:12,572 --> 00:35:14,267
I love you.

513
00:35:15,803 --> 00:35:16,987
Goodbye, Dan.

514
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,971
Hey.
I'm sorry.

515
00:35:36,508 --> 00:35:38,779
I just didn't expect it
to hit me like that.

516
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:41,212
Yeah.

517
00:35:41,243 --> 00:35:43,196
I've just been
so far away for so long.

518
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:46,811
It just didn't really
feel real until then.

519
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,179
Come on.

520
00:35:53,211 --> 00:35:58,139
Let's get back down
on earth, okay?

521
00:35:58,171 --> 00:35:59,971
I don't know about you,
but I really need to pee.

522
00:35:59,995 --> 00:36:02,035
I've needed to pee since
we passed the Eiffel Tower.

523
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:04,891
Okay?

524
00:36:04,924 --> 00:36:06,907
Okay, home time.

525
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,252
Home time.

526
00:36:08,284 --> 00:36:10,491
Harnesses?
Harnesses.

527
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:17,339
Think of the
ice-cold beers waiting for us.

528
00:36:17,371 --> 00:36:18,587
Oh, stop.

529
00:36:20,507 --> 00:36:23,356
I've got you.
Okay, slowly.

530
00:36:23,387 --> 00:36:24,572
Okay.

531
00:36:24,604 --> 00:36:26,332
Uh, I'm just getting
a stitch here.

532
00:36:26,363 --> 00:36:27,995
Okay, okay.

533
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,244
Okay.

534
00:37:02,395 --> 00:37:03,395
Hunter!

535
00:37:12,891 --> 00:37:14,332
No!

536
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:26,428
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, holy shit.

537
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:31,195
Don't let go.
Yeah, I got you.

538
00:37:31,228 --> 00:37:32,228
Hunter!

539
00:37:40,763 --> 00:37:41,963
Oh, God, please don't drop me.

540
00:37:46,523 --> 00:37:47,611
Don't drop me.

541
00:37:59,356 --> 00:38:00,356
Becks?

542
00:38:05,788 --> 00:38:07,004
I've got you, Becks.

543
00:38:10,012 --> 00:38:11,451
I can see the ladder.

544
00:38:25,499 --> 00:38:27,100
I've got you.

545
00:38:31,163 --> 00:38:32,571
I just died almost.

546
00:38:35,932 --> 00:38:38,428
Oh, my God.

547
00:38:38,459 --> 00:38:40,700
Did that really just happen?

548
00:38:40,732 --> 00:38:43,035
Oh, my...
Jesus Christ!

549
00:38:43,067 --> 00:38:44,188
I wish we'd filmed that.

550
00:38:45,979 --> 00:38:47,548
Oh, you're here.

551
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:49,827
Let's get back on the ground
before I actually pee myself.

552
00:38:49,851 --> 00:38:51,004
Yeah.

553
00:38:51,035 --> 00:38:52,035
Okay, take two.

554
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,524
Oh, no.

555
00:39:03,515 --> 00:39:04,515
The ladder.

556
00:39:05,275 --> 00:39:06,299
It's gone.

557
00:39:23,132 --> 00:39:25,339
Hunter, how do we get down?

558
00:39:25,371 --> 00:39:26,459
Shit!

559
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:27,587
Please tell me there's
a way to go down.

560
00:39:27,611 --> 00:39:29,852
There's nothing on the pole
I can get a good foothold on.

561
00:39:29,884 --> 00:39:31,643
No.
Oh, no.

562
00:39:31,676 --> 00:39:33,275
No, no, no.

563
00:39:33,307 --> 00:39:35,420
Um, there must be something.

564
00:39:37,403 --> 00:39:38,747
No. Shit.

565
00:39:38,779 --> 00:39:40,252
I don't have a signal.

566
00:39:42,844 --> 00:39:43,844
I don't get it, either.

567
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,523
I'm sure there's something,

568
00:39:46,555 --> 00:39:47,939
I'm sure it's just
really spotty up here.

569
00:39:47,963 --> 00:39:49,571
No, we're too freaking high.
There's no signal up here.

570
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:50,972
We're gonna be okay.

571
00:39:51,004 --> 00:39:52,355
Freaking out is not gonna
help anything right now.

572
00:39:52,379 --> 00:39:53,596
So just take a breath.

573
00:39:53,627 --> 00:39:55,131
We're stuck on
a pizza-sized platform

574
00:39:55,163 --> 00:39:56,572
in the middle of nowhere,
Hunter.

575
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:59,035
Becky, freaking out
is not gonna help anything.

576
00:39:59,068 --> 00:40:00,443
It's not gonna help, okay.

577
00:40:01,115 --> 00:40:02,115
It's okay.

578
00:40:03,771 --> 00:40:06,332
I'm sure we can... Wait, Hunter.
Hunter, Hunter.

579
00:40:06,364 --> 00:40:07,643
Look at this.

580
00:40:07,675 --> 00:40:09,467
Oh, my God.

581
00:40:09,499 --> 00:40:11,451
Binoculars. Amazing.
Okay.

582
00:40:12,347 --> 00:40:13,531
We have a flare.

583
00:40:13,564 --> 00:40:14,564
Okay.

584
00:40:16,379 --> 00:40:17,435
Okay.

585
00:40:17,467 --> 00:40:18,524
This is great news.
Okay.

586
00:40:27,164 --> 00:40:29,243
Oh, shit, our bag is down there.

587
00:40:30,907 --> 00:40:32,924
Oh, man, our water's in there.

588
00:40:34,876 --> 00:40:35,908
Shit, we're gonna die of thirst.

589
00:40:35,932 --> 00:40:37,660
No. No.
We don't have water.

590
00:40:37,691 --> 00:40:39,195
No, think about it...
The noise!

591
00:40:39,227 --> 00:40:40,483
That is how you die
when you're stranded.

592
00:40:40,507 --> 00:40:42,115
The noise that this thing made
when it crashed,

593
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:44,603
there is no way
nobody heard that.

594
00:40:44,636 --> 00:40:46,875
Okay? I'm...
I'm sure that there

595
00:40:46,907 --> 00:40:50,011
are like multiple calls to 911
as we speak.

596
00:40:50,044 --> 00:40:51,260
Do you really think so?

597
00:40:52,027 --> 00:40:53,212
Yeah.

598
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:54,275
Yeah, the cavalry
is coming, okay?

599
00:40:54,299 --> 00:40:56,635
We just...
We just have to wait.

600
00:40:56,668 --> 00:40:58,523
Okay.
Okay.

601
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,916
Holy...

602
00:41:01,948 --> 00:41:03,451
What? What?
Becky, your leg.

603
00:41:03,484 --> 00:41:05,115
My God.

604
00:41:06,203 --> 00:41:07,708
What the hell?

605
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:09,340
I didn't even notice this.

606
00:41:09,979 --> 00:41:11,452
Whoa!

607
00:41:11,483 --> 00:41:14,171
Um, whoa! Come here.
Let's compress it.

608
00:41:14,204 --> 00:41:15,844
Are you okay? I know.
Ow! It really hurts.

609
00:41:15,868 --> 00:41:17,156
Can you just like...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

610
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,748
Can you warn me?
Okay.

611
00:41:18,779 --> 00:41:20,507
Count of three?
Yeah. One...

612
00:41:20,539 --> 00:41:23,387
Two... Sorry.
I'm really sorry.

613
00:41:23,419 --> 00:41:24,635
I know.
Oh, man.

614
00:41:24,667 --> 00:41:26,524
Are you okay?

615
00:41:26,555 --> 00:41:28,667
Yeah, I know I'm like, I'm okay.
It's like...

616
00:41:32,732 --> 00:41:35,356
I really have to pee.

617
00:41:35,387 --> 00:41:37,084
- Just go.
- No.

618
00:41:37,115 --> 00:41:39,227
Just pee.
No, it's fine. I can hold it.

619
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,795
I just need to get comfortable.

620
00:41:49,787 --> 00:41:50,884
Can you go any farther?

621
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,892
It's, like, spraying.

622
00:41:52,924 --> 00:41:54,812
Okay, careful over the ledge.
I'm trying.

623
00:41:54,844 --> 00:41:56,732
Stop looking at me.

624
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,548
Oh, God.
That's a relief.

625
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:03,227
I'm just grateful
you didn't need to shit.

626
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,308
Okay, well, we should find
a way to get comfortable,

627
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:07,299
'cause I think we're gonna
be up here for a while.

628
00:42:09,052 --> 00:42:10,052
All right.

629
00:42:14,939 --> 00:42:16,283
All right!

630
00:42:22,235 --> 00:42:23,931
Do you really think
someone's coming?

631
00:42:25,436 --> 00:42:27,196
One million percent.

632
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:09,404

00:44:04,891 --> 00:44:06,044
<i>um...</i>

659
00:44:08,188 --> 00:44:10,876
<i>And this is gonna sound stupid,</i>

660
00:44:12,827 --> 00:44:14,331
<i>but I do this because of Dan.</i>

661
00:44:19,355 --> 00:44:21,500
What happened...

662
00:44:21,532 --> 00:44:23,867
It just made me realize
that life is fleeting.

663
00:44:26,428 --> 00:44:30,140
And I want to spread that
message, that life is short,

664
00:44:30,172 --> 00:44:31,259
too short.

665
00:44:33,052 --> 00:44:34,555
So, you gotta use every moment.

666
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:37,787
You have to do something
that makes you feel alive.

667
00:44:48,091 --> 00:44:49,403
That was amazing.

668
00:44:51,164 --> 00:44:53,851
Wow, I mean, I told you,
you should just be yourself.

669
00:44:55,324 --> 00:44:56,507
That was really great.

670
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,660
Should I kill Danger D?

671
00:45:01,691 --> 00:45:02,843
Mm-hmm.

672
00:45:02,876 --> 00:45:04,507
I'll help you bury the body.

673
00:45:20,924 --> 00:45:22,747
Oh, shit.

674
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,443
There's like
an old RV thing down there.

675
00:45:24,475 --> 00:45:25,660
Can I see?

676
00:45:25,691 --> 00:45:27,451
Just past the gate,
a little over.

677
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,660
Yeah.

678
00:45:31,547 --> 00:45:32,572
That looks abandoned.

679
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,059
It's been five hours.

680
00:45:36,091 --> 00:45:37,819
If anyone called 911,
they'd be here by now.

681
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,460
Oh, my God.

682
00:45:56,251 --> 00:45:57,563
Holy shit.

683
00:45:57,596 --> 00:46:00,572
Hold on, Becky,
we don't get service up here,

684
00:46:00,604 --> 00:46:02,075
but we definitely
did down there.

685
00:46:02,107 --> 00:46:03,419
Remember, I got all those likes?

686
00:46:03,452 --> 00:46:04,731
Shit.

687
00:46:05,404 --> 00:46:07,196
Okay.

688
00:46:07,228 --> 00:46:08,675
Okay, so we don't know at
what point we lost service.

689
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,076
Maybe it was just up here

690
00:46:10,108 --> 00:46:11,683
because of some
like interference with the...

691
00:46:11,707 --> 00:46:13,019
The broadcast antenna.
Yeah.

692
00:46:13,052 --> 00:46:14,756
I think you're definitely
onto something, Hunter.

693
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,475
Okay, we have 50 feet of rope.

694
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:18,203
We can try to fish for coverage.

695
00:46:18,235 --> 00:46:20,380
I just need something
to secure this with.

696
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:22,492
My hair tie.
Yeah, perfect.

697
00:46:22,523 --> 00:46:23,523
Okay.

698
00:46:24,476 --> 00:46:25,883
Okay.

699
00:46:25,915 --> 00:46:27,203
Can you message
emergency services?

700
00:46:27,227 --> 00:46:28,379
I don't think so.

701
00:46:28,412 --> 00:46:29,723
But I have
over 60,000 followers.

702
00:46:29,755 --> 00:46:30,971
Okay.

703
00:46:31,004 --> 00:46:37,852
"Help us. Stuck on B-67 Tower. Call 911."

704
00:46:37,883 --> 00:46:39,235
It's ready to post.

705
00:46:39,259 --> 00:46:40,700
We should hear it when it sends.

706
00:46:46,907 --> 00:46:48,347
Come on, come on.

707
00:46:48,891 --> 00:46:50,011
Okay.

708
00:46:50,939 --> 00:46:51,939
Okay.

709
00:46:55,643 --> 00:46:57,531
Let's see if I can get lower.

710
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:02,012
Just be careful.

711
00:47:02,044 --> 00:47:04,315
Got it, okay. Come on.

712
00:47:09,563 --> 00:47:11,003
That's the end.

713
00:47:11,035 --> 00:47:13,084
I didn't hear anything.
I didn't, either.

714
00:47:13,115 --> 00:47:14,428
I don't think it posted.

715
00:47:17,372 --> 00:47:19,163
Okay, maybe I can get lower.

716
00:47:20,635 --> 00:47:21,980
What? What do you mean?
Just...

717
00:47:22,012 --> 00:47:23,172
I've got it.
I've got an idea.

718
00:47:30,491 --> 00:47:32,699
Careful, Hunter.
Feels solid.

719
00:47:35,003 --> 00:47:36,580
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

720
00:47:42,107 --> 00:47:43,739
Okay.

721
00:47:43,771 --> 00:47:45,563
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.

722
00:47:45,595 --> 00:47:46,588
- Careful.
- Shit.

723
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:47,996
Oh, my God, Hunter.

724
00:47:48,028 --> 00:47:49,852
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

725
00:47:49,883 --> 00:47:50,980
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

726
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:55,451
Careful.
Shit.

727
00:48:03,739 --> 00:48:04,931
I don't hear anything.
Nothing.

728
00:48:04,955 --> 00:48:06,236
Okay, you need to come back up.

729
00:48:09,884 --> 00:48:10,972
Shit.

730
00:48:18,364 --> 00:48:19,364
I got it.

731
00:48:29,723 --> 00:48:30,844
Did it post?

732
00:48:32,027 --> 00:48:33,027
No.

733
00:48:34,139 --> 00:48:36,443
What do we do now?
I don't know.

734
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,435
Wait, hold on.

735
00:48:41,467 --> 00:48:43,484
We know there's a signal
at the base for sure.

736
00:48:43,516 --> 00:48:44,507
Yeah.

737
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,492
What if we just drop the phone?

738
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:48,100
Okay, but what if my phone
just shatters into a million pieces?

739
00:48:48,124 --> 00:48:49,468
Not if we reinforce it somehow,

740
00:48:49,499 --> 00:48:51,076
so it doesn't like
the egg drop challenge.

741
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,859
Yeah.
Okay, shit.

742
00:48:52,891 --> 00:48:55,771
Um, we just need
something to... To put it in.

743
00:48:55,804 --> 00:48:57,467
Yeah.
This.

744
00:48:58,204 --> 00:48:59,771
It's welded on.

745
00:48:59,804 --> 00:49:01,499
My shoe's too flimsy.

746
00:49:01,531 --> 00:49:04,283
Your shoe?
Yeah, perfect.

747
00:49:04,315 --> 00:49:05,723
Okay, got it.

748
00:49:08,636 --> 00:49:10,971
We need some padding.
Can we use your sock?

749
00:49:12,508 --> 00:49:14,267
Yeah.
Okay.

750
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:16,763
Okay.

751
00:49:19,163 --> 00:49:21,531
We still need something
more substantial.

752
00:49:22,491 --> 00:49:24,028
Oh, Hunter.

753
00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:25,627
Your push-up bra.

754
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,803
That is more substantial.
Yeah.

755
00:49:27,836 --> 00:49:29,723
Dying to get
this thing off, anyway.

756
00:49:31,324 --> 00:49:32,987
Thank you, VS.

757
00:49:35,035 --> 00:49:36,443
Okay.

758
00:49:36,476 --> 00:49:38,075
Hope it's strong enough.

759
00:49:38,107 --> 00:49:39,868
Shove it real good.

760
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,100
Okay.

761
00:49:46,747 --> 00:49:47,771
Here goes nothing.

762
00:50:02,267 --> 00:50:03,675
Did it work?

763
00:50:03,707 --> 00:50:05,067
I don't know.
I can't tell.

764
00:50:19,195 --> 00:50:20,603
Do you see anything?

765
00:50:20,636 --> 00:50:22,267
No, nothing.

766
00:50:23,324 --> 00:50:24,347
Don't worry.

767
00:50:25,276 --> 00:50:26,332
They're coming.

768
00:50:32,795 --> 00:50:35,963
Holy shit!
There's a freaking guy!

769
00:50:35,996 --> 00:50:38,363
- What?
- Oh, my God. Yes.

770
00:50:38,395 --> 00:50:39,547
And a dog, too.

771
00:50:41,147 --> 00:50:43,451
Hey! Up here!
Hey, help us!

772
00:50:46,396 --> 00:50:49,084
Look, I sent you the check, man.
Come on.

773
00:50:49,115 --> 00:50:51,388
I need that...

774
00:50:51,419 --> 00:50:53,243
- Hey!
- Hey, boy! Big boy!

775
00:50:58,555 --> 00:50:59,555
Parker.

776
00:51:00,764 --> 00:51:02,684
Come! Come on, boy.

777
00:51:02,716 --> 00:51:03,899
No, no, no, no, no.

778
00:51:05,243 --> 00:51:06,243
Shit!

779
00:51:07,484 --> 00:51:08,603
Hey!

780
00:51:11,035 --> 00:51:12,155
Let's go.

781
00:51:14,459 --> 00:51:16,067
God damn it,
they're getting away.

782
00:51:30,139 --> 00:51:31,420
Parker.

783
00:51:33,148 --> 00:51:34,364
He got the shoe.

784
00:51:34,396 --> 00:51:36,059
Hey! Up here!
Look up here. Please!

785
00:51:45,083 --> 00:51:46,139
Hey!
Hey!

786
00:51:46,172 --> 00:51:47,548
He's walking!
Hey!

787
00:51:54,299 --> 00:51:55,995
No, no, no, turn around!
Turn around!

788
00:51:56,027 --> 00:51:57,148
Right here!

789
00:51:57,179 --> 00:51:58,179
Hey!

790
00:51:59,452 --> 00:52:01,499
Shit! Shit!
Hey!

791
00:52:04,252 --> 00:52:05,755
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no.

792
00:52:05,788 --> 00:52:07,515
Do not fire the flare,
he's not looking.

793
00:52:07,547 --> 00:52:08,740
This might be our only chance.

794
00:52:08,764 --> 00:52:10,715
No, no, no, he's not looking.

795
00:52:12,443 --> 00:52:13,660
Wait.

796
00:52:13,691 --> 00:52:15,484
Hold on.
There's somebody by the RV.

797
00:52:15,515 --> 00:52:17,404
He's setting up
a grill or some shit.

798
00:52:17,435 --> 00:52:18,683
Okay.

799
00:52:18,716 --> 00:52:20,323
And we'll fire the flare
when the sun goes down

800
00:52:20,347 --> 00:52:22,108
in like...
In like an hour.

801
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,419
We've only got one shot at this.

802
00:52:25,115 --> 00:52:26,332
Oh, damn.

803
00:52:26,363 --> 00:52:27,388
What?

804
00:52:27,419 --> 00:52:29,947
They're making ribs.
Oh, no.

805
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,547
And they have really cold beer.

806
00:52:31,579 --> 00:52:32,635
Don't.

807
00:52:47,963 --> 00:52:50,075
These guys
are definitely a couple.

808
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:53,627
Dirty weekend away.

809
00:52:53,659 --> 00:52:54,748
I'm jealous.

810
00:53:11,483 --> 00:53:14,140
Hey, hey, hey.
They're finishing up.

811
00:53:14,171 --> 00:53:15,428
It's now or never,
fire the flare.

812
00:53:15,452 --> 00:53:17,659
Is it dark enough?
Uh-huh.

813
00:53:17,691 --> 00:53:19,835
Okay.

814
00:53:19,867 --> 00:53:21,052
Shit.
Shit. What the hell?

815
00:53:21,083 --> 00:53:22,811
Why isn't it firing?
I fired it.

816
00:53:22,844 --> 00:53:24,580
I cocked it, maybe there's
a safety or something?

817
00:53:24,604 --> 00:53:26,339
Shit. Okay, they're going in,
they're going in.

818
00:53:26,363 --> 00:53:27,491
- You have to do the flare now.
- I'm trying.

819
00:53:27,515 --> 00:53:28,580
Get it to go.
It's stuck.

820
00:53:28,604 --> 00:53:30,107
Okay, I got it. I got it.

821
00:53:35,387 --> 00:53:37,883
Hey, Randy,
come check this shit out.

822
00:53:37,915 --> 00:53:39,995
Okay, give me your phone.
Okay.

823
00:53:41,884 --> 00:53:43,835
Hey, sons of bitches, up here!

824
00:53:44,795 --> 00:53:46,780
Holy shit!
Check this out.

825
00:53:47,932 --> 00:53:49,371
Up here! Hey!

826
00:53:49,403 --> 00:53:50,467
Wait, wait, wait,
they're looking at us.

827
00:53:50,491 --> 00:53:51,484
What?
They can see us.

828
00:53:51,515 --> 00:53:52,604
Oh, my God!

829
00:53:52,636 --> 00:53:53,852
Holy shit!
Oh, my God,

830
00:53:53,884 --> 00:53:56,284
let me see, let me see,
let me see.

831
00:53:56,315 --> 00:53:57,915
Oh, my God,
they're coming.

832
00:53:59,068 --> 00:54:00,068
Hey!

833
00:54:03,739 --> 00:54:05,027
Holy shit, they found the car.

834
00:54:05,051 --> 00:54:06,683
They found our car,
they found our car.

835
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,715
They have a... A crowbar.

836
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,187
They're probably
gonna open the gate.

837
00:54:13,403 --> 00:54:14,620
- Okay.
- Okay.

838
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:15,716
Wait, what the hell?

839
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,179
Wait, what's going on?

840
00:54:17,211 --> 00:54:19,099
They stopped.
What?

841
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:21,307
Quit chatting,
go open the freakin' gate.

842
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:24,059
No. No, no, no.
What the hell?

843
00:54:24,091 --> 00:54:25,156
They're stealing
my freakin' car!

844
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:26,204
What?

845
00:54:26,236 --> 00:54:28,283
No, you sons of bitches!
Hey!

846
00:54:28,316 --> 00:54:30,299
You asshole!
What the hell?

847
00:54:30,332 --> 00:54:32,156
No! I need to see it!

848
00:54:33,884 --> 00:54:37,883
Oh, my God. No, no!
Die, you freakin' assholes!

849
00:55:26,587 --> 00:55:29,179
Okay.
New rule.

850
00:55:30,331 --> 00:55:32,444
If somebody falls off the tower,

851
00:55:32,476 --> 00:55:34,396
they bring the cell phone
with them.

852
00:55:34,427 --> 00:55:36,380
And call for help
on the way down.

853
00:55:38,779 --> 00:55:40,283
And maybe post that video.

854
00:55:41,723 --> 00:55:44,219
Kidding, ish.

855
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:48,956
Yeah, my leg.

856
00:55:48,988 --> 00:55:51,163
I could eat aspirin
like Skittles right now.

857
00:55:52,571 --> 00:55:54,331
Yeah.

858
00:55:54,364 --> 00:55:55,995
It's looking a little funky.

859
00:55:56,027 --> 00:55:57,563
Could use some washing, here.

860
00:56:08,987 --> 00:56:09,987
I'm sorry.

861
00:56:19,547 --> 00:56:21,179
We'll just keep it wrapped up.

862
00:56:24,028 --> 00:56:25,147
What's wrong?

863
00:56:28,891 --> 00:56:30,940
Dan could never say
the words, "I love you."

864
00:56:33,884 --> 00:56:35,579
1-4-3.

865
00:56:39,868 --> 00:56:41,500
1-4-3.

866
00:56:46,684 --> 00:56:48,891
Becky, I...
How long?

867
00:56:52,891 --> 00:56:54,555
Four months.

868
00:56:58,972 --> 00:57:01,531
It was a huge mistake.

869
00:57:01,564 --> 00:57:05,211
I'm sorry, I am so, so sorry.

870
00:57:05,243 --> 00:57:07,580
For sleeping with my husband
or me finding out about it?

871
00:57:07,612 --> 00:57:09,563
For falling in love
with the same guy.

872
00:57:40,091 --> 00:57:42,555
Who made the move?

873
00:57:42,587 --> 00:57:44,475
- Both super drunk.
- Who?

874
00:57:46,811 --> 00:57:48,443
He did.

875
00:57:50,331 --> 00:57:54,203
But it was a huge,
huge mistake, Becks.

876
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,500
No.

877
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:01,979
A mistake is a kiss.
A one-night stand.

878
00:58:03,356 --> 00:58:05,691
You said you loved him, so...

879
00:58:08,699 --> 00:58:10,523
It got out of hand.

880
00:58:10,555 --> 00:58:15,323
I tried so hard not to,
but I fell for him. I mean...

881
00:58:15,355 --> 00:58:18,268
He listened to me, he was...

882
00:58:18,299 --> 00:58:20,219
He was just different
than every other douche bag

883
00:58:20,251 --> 00:58:21,436
that I'd ever dated and...

884
00:58:23,452 --> 00:58:25,276
And I'd never
felt that way before.

885
00:58:27,452 --> 00:58:29,092
And then you asked me
to be your maid of honor

886
00:58:29,116 --> 00:58:30,715
and it all hit me
like a ton of bricks,

887
00:58:30,748 --> 00:58:32,188
how messed up this all was.

888
00:58:34,523 --> 00:58:36,347
I loved him,

889
00:58:38,299 --> 00:58:40,667
but I love you more,
so I ended it.

890
00:58:44,411 --> 00:58:46,907
It was just so hard
seeing you guys together.

891
00:58:48,604 --> 00:58:50,107
And after Dan died, I...

892
00:58:51,323 --> 00:58:53,243
I just didn't have the strength

893
00:58:53,276 --> 00:58:54,651
to be there for you.

894
00:58:54,683 --> 00:58:56,795
To be strong enough
for you, so...

895
00:58:57,884 --> 00:58:59,036
So, I ran away.

896
00:59:00,796 --> 00:59:02,843
And now you hate me
and I don't blame you,

897
00:59:02,876 --> 00:59:05,435
and now we're stuck on
this stupid, freaking tower

898
00:59:05,467 --> 00:59:07,163
in the middle
of freaking nowhere.

899
00:59:08,347 --> 00:59:09,596
And it's all my fault.

900
00:59:11,356 --> 00:59:14,204
I am so, so sorry.

901
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:27,739
What's that?

902
01:00:27,771 --> 01:00:30,076
I set it when we dropped
the phone down yesterday.

903
01:00:32,188 --> 01:00:33,787
It's been 24 hours.

904
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:38,651
I think it's time to accept

905
01:00:38,684 --> 01:00:40,516
that either your 60,000
followers don't give a shit

906
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:43,131
or your phone's down there
in a million pieces.

907
01:00:43,772 --> 01:00:46,204
Okay.

908
01:00:46,235 --> 01:00:49,340
Well, we've got one more shot.
Your phone.

909
01:00:49,372 --> 01:00:51,100
Yeah, no padding
this time, though.

910
01:00:51,131 --> 01:00:52,859
Even less of a chance.

911
01:00:52,891 --> 01:00:54,771
And if this fails we really
don't have any hope.

912
01:00:58,043 --> 01:00:59,804
How long till we die of thirst?

913
01:01:01,307 --> 01:01:02,627
It's just killing me
that our water

914
01:01:02,651 --> 01:01:04,667
is just right down there
in that bag.

915
01:01:06,331 --> 01:01:08,636
Yeah, with the drone.

916
01:01:08,668 --> 01:01:10,971
We could've used that
to get help.

917
01:01:11,003 --> 01:01:13,979
We could have flown it back to our
motel with a good old fashioned note.

918
01:01:19,643 --> 01:01:20,987
Wait, maybe I can get it.

919
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:23,804
What do you mean?

920
01:01:23,836 --> 01:01:25,411
You said it was too smooth.
No footholds.

921
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:26,819
Yeah, but when I hung
my cell down yesterday,

922
01:01:26,843 --> 01:01:29,179
I think the rope was
long enough to reach it.

923
01:01:31,676 --> 01:01:33,532
Are you serious?
Yeah.

924
01:01:35,356 --> 01:01:37,019
Yeah, I seriously think
I can get it.

925
01:01:45,563 --> 01:01:47,419
Hunter, I don't think
this is a good idea.

926
01:01:47,451 --> 01:01:49,948
Becky, I don't think
we have a choice.

927
01:01:49,979 --> 01:01:52,123
Every hour that passes,
the weaker we get.

928
01:01:56,444 --> 01:01:58,331
Besides...

929
01:01:58,364 --> 01:02:00,316
Maybe you'll get lucky
and I'll fall.

930
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:11,867
Hunter.

931
01:02:15,515 --> 01:02:16,515
Be careful.

932
01:02:19,324 --> 01:02:20,476
I'm sorry, Becks.

933
01:02:22,075 --> 01:02:23,227
I love you.

934
01:02:34,907 --> 01:02:35,996
Okay.

935
01:02:45,148 --> 01:02:46,523
Are you okay?

936
01:02:47,516 --> 01:02:48,516
Yeah.

937
01:02:49,851 --> 01:02:51,164
Yeah, all good.

938
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:59,451
Okay.

939
01:03:06,268 --> 01:03:07,268
Okay.

940
01:03:14,939 --> 01:03:15,995
Hunter, careful.

941
01:03:17,851 --> 01:03:18,851
Shit.

942
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:22,108
I can't quite reach it.

943
01:03:22,139 --> 01:03:23,451
Just come back up.

944
01:03:23,483 --> 01:03:24,988
We'll attach it lower.
Come on.

945
01:03:25,019 --> 01:03:26,908
Shit.

946
01:03:30,491 --> 01:03:32,123
I think I can drop myself lower.

947
01:03:32,155 --> 01:03:33,947
What?

948
01:03:33,979 --> 01:03:36,155
What the hell
are you doing, Hunter?

949
01:03:37,468 --> 01:03:38,468
Hunter!

950
01:03:46,076 --> 01:03:47,076
Shit.

951
01:03:54,556 --> 01:03:57,179
I think I can swing to it.
Hunter, no!

952
01:03:57,211 --> 01:03:59,356
Hunter! Come back up!

953
01:03:59,387 --> 01:04:00,572
Hunter, no!

954
01:04:00,604 --> 01:04:01,755
Hunter!

955
01:04:07,996 --> 01:04:09,403
Are you okay?

956
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:12,579
Yeah.

957
01:04:17,179 --> 01:04:19,355
Is there a way down?

958
01:04:19,387 --> 01:04:22,171
No. The ladder ripped
all the way off.

959
01:04:33,116 --> 01:04:34,116
Water.

960
01:04:37,724 --> 01:04:40,219
Oh, my God.
Wait, Hunter.

961
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:42,395
How are you gonna
get back on the rope?

962
01:04:46,267 --> 01:04:47,267
Uh.

963
01:04:48,059 --> 01:04:49,340
Shit.

964
01:04:51,323 --> 01:04:53,051
Can... Can you reach it?

965
01:05:03,004 --> 01:05:05,596
<i>♪ Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall ♪</i>

966
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,219
Oh, my God.

967
01:05:08,251 --> 01:05:10,619
<i>♪ Humpty Dumpty had a big fall... ♪</i>

968
01:05:22,715 --> 01:05:23,715
Shit.

969
01:05:28,251 --> 01:05:30,299
You okay?
Yeah.

970
01:05:30,331 --> 01:05:31,739
I have an idea.

971
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,619
Okay.

972
01:05:42,651 --> 01:05:44,795
I'm gonna try
to hook it on with this,

973
01:05:44,827 --> 01:05:47,483
and then we're gonna
work together to pull me up.

974
01:05:47,515 --> 01:05:49,724
Okay?
That's amazing.

975
01:05:49,756 --> 01:05:51,876
That's some good MacGyver
shit right there.

976
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:21,628
Oh, come on. Please.
Come on.

977
01:06:24,476 --> 01:06:26,715
You did it!
Okay.

978
01:06:26,747 --> 01:06:29,884
Okay.
I'm gonna jump onto this.

979
01:06:29,915 --> 01:06:31,931
I'm gonna need
your help to pull me up.

980
01:06:31,964 --> 01:06:33,435
Okay.
Get ready, Becks.

981
01:06:33,467 --> 01:06:35,419
Okay.
Okay.

982
01:06:35,996 --> 01:06:37,019
Okay.

983
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:42,380
Okay, come on, come on.
Come on, you can do it.

984
01:06:51,835 --> 01:06:52,987
Shit.

985
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:55,067
Hunter, are you okay?
You okay?

986
01:06:57,851 --> 01:07:00,059
Okay. I'm okay.

987
01:07:00,092 --> 01:07:02,012
Let's do this
fast and quick, Becky.

988
01:07:02,044 --> 01:07:03,580
Work together to pull me up.

989
01:07:03,611 --> 01:07:06,779
Okay.
I climb, you pull.

990
01:07:06,812 --> 01:07:10,043
Okay?
Okay, now!

991
01:07:39,131 --> 01:07:40,924
I can almost reach the ladder.

992
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:46,940
Almost there, Becks.

993
01:07:53,852 --> 01:07:55,228
Okay.

994
01:08:25,211 --> 01:08:27,388
Becky!
I landed on the bag!

995
01:08:27,419 --> 01:08:29,595
Oh, my God...
Are you okay?

996
01:08:29,627 --> 01:08:32,987
I hurt my hands, real bad.
I don't think I can climb.

997
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:34,876
You're gonna
have to pull me up, okay?

998
01:08:34,907 --> 01:08:36,059
Okay.
Okay.

999
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:40,763
I got you.

1000
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:18,020
Oh, shit.

1001
01:09:20,987 --> 01:09:23,003
Oh, no.
Are you okay?

1002
01:09:23,036 --> 01:09:25,595
Shit.
I thought you died there.

1003
01:09:25,627 --> 01:09:27,323
I'm not going anywhere, Becks.

1004
01:09:28,283 --> 01:09:29,756
Yeah, that was scary.

1005
01:09:37,244 --> 01:09:38,939
We should ration it.
Okay.

1006
01:09:38,971 --> 01:09:39,971
You're right.

1007
01:09:41,276 --> 01:09:43,515
Is there any food in there?

1008
01:09:43,547 --> 01:09:45,755
No, it's just
your cherry lip balm.

1009
01:09:45,787 --> 01:09:47,900
I don't think you can eat that.

1010
01:09:47,932 --> 01:09:50,012
Okay.
It's getting dark.

1011
01:09:50,044 --> 01:09:52,571
I think it's now or never
on that drone.

1012
01:09:52,604 --> 01:09:56,347
I guess we need to...
We need to write a note.

1013
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:58,460
Okay, the receipt
from the diner.

1014
01:09:58,492 --> 01:10:01,979
A pen... Do you have a pen?
Eye liner in here.

1015
01:10:02,011 --> 01:10:03,571
Aren't you glad
I brought up makeup now?

1016
01:10:06,172 --> 01:10:07,739
"Help.

1017
01:10:07,771 --> 01:10:12,796
"Stuck on top of B-67 Tower.
Call 911."

1018
01:10:14,587 --> 01:10:15,803
Yeah, perfect.

1019
01:10:19,739 --> 01:10:22,011
Okay.
See that?

1020
01:10:22,043 --> 01:10:24,380
That's the road
where we almost got wiped out.

1021
01:10:24,412 --> 01:10:26,843
It leads to the motel.

1022
01:10:26,875 --> 01:10:28,635
Let's do this while
we still have light.

1023
01:10:32,156 --> 01:10:33,403
Okay.

1024
01:10:36,539 --> 01:10:38,404
Okay, just keep it straight
and follow the line of the road.

1025
01:10:38,428 --> 01:10:40,411
Let it drift down as it goes.
Okay.

1026
01:10:53,659 --> 01:10:55,196
Okay.

1027
01:10:55,228 --> 01:10:57,595
Okay, we're almost
past the gate.

1028
01:10:57,628 --> 01:10:58,820
Oh, my God.

1029
01:10:58,844 --> 01:11:00,100
- No, no, no. The battery.
- What?

1030
01:11:00,124 --> 01:11:02,267
It's running out of juice.
Oh, shit.

1031
01:11:02,299 --> 01:11:04,667
Hit retrieve.
Or has it gone too far?

1032
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:06,556
Is it gonna make it?
There's no chance!

1033
01:11:06,587 --> 01:11:08,315
Are you sure?
It's not even at the gate.

1034
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:09,915
Shit.
It's dropping.

1035
01:11:09,947 --> 01:11:10,907
Hit retrieve, hit retrieve... Hunter.

1036
01:11:10,939 --> 01:11:11,963
...hit retrieve.
Okay.

1037
01:11:13,276 --> 01:11:14,755
- It's coming back.
- Fly it up.

1038
01:11:14,779 --> 01:11:16,163
Give it the best shot
to get back to us.

1039
01:11:16,187 --> 01:11:17,907
Come on, just get it
higher, higher, higher.

1040
01:11:19,835 --> 01:11:21,659
Just get it higher!
I'm trying.

1041
01:11:23,068 --> 01:11:24,059
We'll grab it
when it gets close.

1042
01:11:24,092 --> 01:11:25,275
Okay.

1043
01:11:28,507 --> 01:11:30,203
Okay.
We've got this.

1044
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:33,115
Get it, Becks, get it.

1045
01:11:36,155 --> 01:11:38,204
Nice! Good job.

1046
01:11:50,395 --> 01:11:52,251
We have a charger,
but we don't have any power.

1047
01:11:53,179 --> 01:11:54,491
Maybe just turn it off

1048
01:11:54,524 --> 01:11:56,164
and once it's rested,
it will have more juice.

1049
01:11:56,188 --> 01:11:58,556
It's never gonna be enough.
Hunter.

1050
01:12:07,771 --> 01:12:09,595
What are we gonna do?

1051
01:12:09,628 --> 01:12:11,675
Hey, we're not gonna panic.

1052
01:12:11,707 --> 01:12:13,979
We're gonna stay calm.

1053
01:12:14,012 --> 01:12:15,899
We're gonna figure it out, okay?

1054
01:12:15,932 --> 01:12:17,147
There's gotta be a way.

1055
01:12:20,507 --> 01:12:21,915
Are we gonna die?

1056
01:12:22,523 --> 01:12:23,579
No.

1057
01:12:24,412 --> 01:12:25,979
No, we're gonna be okay.

1058
01:12:53,947 --> 01:12:55,547
Hunter.
Hunter...

1059
01:12:56,603 --> 01:12:58,043
Where are you?
Hunter...

1060
01:13:05,243 --> 01:13:06,243
Hunter...

1061
01:13:07,643 --> 01:13:09,500
Hunter, where are you?

1062
01:13:13,276 --> 01:13:15,323
Hunter.
Hunter!

1063
01:14:15,707 --> 01:14:16,828
Becky, it's okay.

1064
01:14:17,852 --> 01:14:19,772
You just had a bad dream.

1065
01:14:19,804 --> 01:14:21,692
You're nice and safe,

1066
01:14:21,724 --> 01:14:25,051
2,000 feet up
in the middle of nowhere.

1067
01:14:33,628 --> 01:14:35,483
I have an idea.

1068
01:14:35,515 --> 01:14:36,860
How to charge the drone.

1069
01:14:38,524 --> 01:14:39,836
Your dumb life hack.

1070
01:14:40,859 --> 01:14:42,716
Becky, you freakin' genius.

1071
01:14:49,915 --> 01:14:51,964
I think it's light enough now.
Let's do it.

1072
01:15:11,068 --> 01:15:12,891
Okay, it's a standard
bulb fitting,

1073
01:15:12,923 --> 01:15:14,396
but it's gonna be hot.

1074
01:15:14,428 --> 01:15:16,283
It's 30 feet but it's
gonna feel like 1,000.

1075
01:15:20,284 --> 01:15:22,619
Is your leg okay?
Yeah.

1076
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:24,635
It smells,
but it doesn't hurt anymore.

1077
01:15:24,667 --> 01:15:25,667
It's fine.

1078
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:27,555
Okay.

1079
01:15:31,484 --> 01:15:32,603
You can do this.

1080
01:15:41,116 --> 01:15:42,492
Yeah!
Yeah.

1081
01:15:46,139 --> 01:15:47,579
Keep going, Becky.

1082
01:15:52,219 --> 01:15:53,404
You got this, Becky.

1083
01:16:03,419 --> 01:16:05,084
I can't.

1084
01:16:05,116 --> 01:16:06,555
It's okay, it's okay.

1085
01:16:06,587 --> 01:16:08,188
I can't.

1086
01:16:08,219 --> 01:16:09,691
You can do it, Becky.

1087
01:16:10,427 --> 01:16:11,427
You got it.

1088
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:16,348
It's okay.

1089
01:16:16,379 --> 01:16:18,524
It's just like pole dancing.

1090
01:16:18,556 --> 01:16:21,244
Um... Okay, <i>Cherry Pie.</i>

1091

Yes!

1102
01:16:53,788 --> 01:16:55,132
You did it,
my little cherry pie.

1103
01:16:55,163 --> 01:16:56,219
Good job!

1104
01:16:58,844 --> 01:17:00,604
Okay.
Yeah!

1105
01:17:00,635 --> 01:17:02,555
You did it, cherry pie!

1106
01:17:04,732 --> 01:17:05,819
All right.
All right.

1107
01:17:07,099 --> 01:17:08,572
Okay. Okay.
Remember, it's hot.

1108
01:17:11,356 --> 01:17:12,356
Be careful.

1109
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:32,507
Okay, just think back
to the diner.

1110
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:34,875
You're gonna want to line
the prongs of the charger

1111
01:17:34,907 --> 01:17:36,955
with the elements
of the bulb socket.

1112
01:17:42,619 --> 01:17:44,123
I don't think it's long enough.

1113
01:17:44,156 --> 01:17:45,947
I think the back prong
doesn't reach.

1114
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:47,675
Okay, you're gonna need

1115
01:17:47,707 --> 01:17:50,555
something small and metal
to carry the current, like a...

1116
01:17:50,587 --> 01:17:53,723
Like a screw or something
that you can jam in there.

1117
01:17:53,756 --> 01:17:56,444
There isn't anything.
Jesus. Um...

1118
01:18:23,931 --> 01:18:26,459
It's working!
It's freaking working!

1119
01:18:26,492 --> 01:18:28,412
Holy shit, my hero!

1120
01:18:28,444 --> 01:18:31,036
Okay, we're gonna need
a full charge.

1121
01:18:31,067 --> 01:18:33,659
I don't know.
It just has four lights.

1122
01:18:33,691 --> 01:18:35,740
Okay, we have to
charge it all the way.

1123
01:18:35,771 --> 01:18:37,531
Give ourselves the best shot.

1124
01:18:37,564 --> 01:18:38,812
You gonna be okay?

1125
01:18:38,843 --> 01:18:40,251
Yeah.

1126
01:18:40,283 --> 01:18:41,283
I got this.

1127
01:19:10,364 --> 01:19:11,452
You okay?

1128
01:19:12,572 --> 01:19:14,075
Yeah.

1129
01:19:14,107 --> 01:19:15,227
Hang in there, Becks.

1130
01:19:16,699 --> 01:19:18,172
Past halfway.

1131
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:39,771
Get off of me!

1132
01:19:47,675 --> 01:19:50,459
It's okay, it's okay, Becky.
You've got it.

1133
01:19:51,611 --> 01:19:53,243
Three lights.

1134
01:19:57,371 --> 01:19:59,387
Come on, Becky, you're so close.

1135
01:20:05,915 --> 01:20:07,996
Get the hell away from me!

1136
01:20:13,852 --> 01:20:14,852
You did it!

1137
01:20:20,251 --> 01:20:21,467
Jesus, I'm so proud of you.

1138
01:20:25,372 --> 01:20:28,060
Why didn't you
catch the bag? Uh...

1139
01:20:28,091 --> 01:20:29,915
Babe, you okay?

1140
01:20:36,827 --> 01:20:40,219
We need to fly that thing
when the motel is the busiest.

1141
01:20:40,251 --> 01:20:42,587
Checkout, 10:00 a.m.

1142
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:44,188
Just a couple of hours.

1143
01:21:11,612 --> 01:21:13,532
You know,
he was right about Dan.

1144
01:21:13,564 --> 01:21:15,292
He was just trying to help me.

1145
01:21:17,851 --> 01:21:19,867
And I was so horrible to him.

1146
01:21:22,972 --> 01:21:25,435
If there was anyone I
could text, it would be him.

1147
01:21:25,468 --> 01:21:26,524
Just to say...

1148
01:21:28,187 --> 01:21:29,564
I'm so sorry.

1149
01:21:32,059 --> 01:21:33,275
I love him.

1150
01:21:39,771 --> 01:21:41,020
I'm tapping out here.

1151
01:21:42,619 --> 01:21:44,188
Stay with me.

1152
01:21:44,219 --> 01:21:47,003
Try to keep your mind occupied.

1153
01:21:47,036 --> 01:21:49,660
Tell me something,
something that...

1154
01:21:49,691 --> 01:21:51,547
That you and your dad
used to do together.

1155
01:21:55,131 --> 01:21:56,699
We would watch wrestling.

1156
01:21:58,108 --> 01:22:01,115
WWE.
Yeah.

1157
01:22:01,147 --> 01:22:03,100
I forgot you guys
were into that.

1158
01:22:03,131 --> 01:22:04,283
Yeah.

1159
01:22:04,316 --> 01:22:06,779
It was our thing, you know.

1160
01:22:06,811 --> 01:22:08,188
He was always said

1161
01:22:08,219 --> 01:22:12,956
I'd be world champion
with my fighting spirit.

1162
01:22:12,988 --> 01:22:15,644
I always felt so close to him
when we would watch it.

1163
01:22:18,812 --> 01:22:21,083
Name some of
your favorite wrestlers.

1164
01:22:24,508 --> 01:22:27,067
Uh, "Stone Cold" Steve Austin.

1165
01:22:28,252 --> 01:22:30,748
The Rock.

1166
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:34,076
What was Cactus Jack's name
when he was wearing the mask?

1167
01:22:34,108 --> 01:22:35,451
Mankind.

1168
01:22:36,827 --> 01:22:38,235
Mankind.

1169
01:22:40,219 --> 01:22:42,075
Wait, I thought you said
you didn't watch it.

1170
01:22:42,107 --> 01:22:43,612
I didn't.

1171
01:22:43,643 --> 01:22:45,563
Keep going,
you need to stay awake.

1172
01:22:48,091 --> 01:22:49,307
Batista.

1173
01:22:54,875 --> 01:22:56,764
Okay.
It's checkout time.

1174
01:22:59,932 --> 01:23:01,403
Okay, here it goes.

1175
01:23:08,411 --> 01:23:10,043
Just keep that shit straight.

1176
01:23:10,075 --> 01:23:11,867
Follow the line of the road.

1177
01:23:16,699 --> 01:23:17,980
Come on, you son of a...

1178
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:25,724
I'm past the point of no return,

1179
01:23:25,756 --> 01:23:27,803
so how's the battery?

1180
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:29,211
Should I retrieve?

1181
01:23:29,243 --> 01:23:31,580
No, keep going.

1182
01:23:34,139 --> 01:23:36,284
Come on, come on,
just follow the road.

1183
01:23:43,036 --> 01:23:44,036
Oh, shit.

1184
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:51,772
It's gonna work.

1185
01:24:00,187 --> 01:24:01,436
Oh, God.

1186
01:24:05,116 --> 01:24:06,116
No.

1187
01:24:08,284 --> 01:24:10,844
Screw your truck.
Get the drone!

1188
01:24:10,876 --> 01:24:12,028
Get it!

1189
01:24:16,859 --> 01:24:19,387
No, no, no, no!

1190
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:22,235
Go back! Go back.

1191
01:24:22,267 --> 01:24:25,532
No, no, no.
Go back!

1192
01:24:25,564 --> 01:24:26,715
Go back!

1193
01:24:31,547 --> 01:24:32,956
Fuck, no!

1194
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:21,916
Is that a storm?

1195
01:25:23,963 --> 01:25:25,756
It's kind of beautiful
from up here.

1196
01:25:31,804 --> 01:25:34,139
I can't survive another night.

1197
01:25:34,171 --> 01:25:35,579
Becky, don't talk like that.

1198
01:25:39,196 --> 01:25:40,699
I just...

1199
01:25:40,731 --> 01:25:43,931
I just wanna sleep.
You can't sleep.

1200
01:25:43,964 --> 01:25:46,491
The vultures,
they can smell your leg.

1201
01:25:46,523 --> 01:25:48,643
They're waiting for you to
give up so they can attack.

1202
01:25:52,315 --> 01:25:54,075
Survival of the fittest.

1203
01:25:55,195 --> 01:25:57,115
You need energy.

1204
01:25:57,148 --> 01:25:59,035
We should eat something.

1205
01:25:59,068 --> 01:26:00,988
What?

1206
01:26:01,019 --> 01:26:04,220
We're 2,000 feet up in
the middle of the desert.

1207
01:26:04,252 --> 01:26:06,107
There's no food up here.

1208
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:07,708
There's always something.

1209
01:26:10,684 --> 01:26:12,283
It's hopeless.

1210
01:26:16,315 --> 01:26:18,524
Let's send another message.

1211
01:26:18,556 --> 01:26:20,636
We can pad the cell
better this time.

1212
01:26:20,668 --> 01:26:23,003
With what?
Give me your shoe.

1213
01:26:23,035 --> 01:26:25,532
I can't.
Why?

1214
01:26:25,564 --> 01:26:27,964
It's not up here, is it?
What?

1215
01:26:30,811 --> 01:26:32,092
It's down there.

1216
01:26:33,595 --> 01:26:34,907
It's on your foot.

1217
01:26:36,379 --> 01:26:37,468
Yes.

1218
01:26:39,355 --> 01:26:45,148
But I'm down there, remember?

1219
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:51,835
I fell.

1220
01:26:55,036 --> 01:26:57,595
<i>You can't have the shoe,</i>

1221
01:26:57,628 --> 01:26:59,644
<i>because I didn't catch the bag.</i>

1222
01:27:00,796 --> 01:27:02,235
<i>I bled out.</i>

1223
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:22,459
You didn't really think your scrawny
ass could pull me up, did you?

1224
01:27:35,899 --> 01:27:37,307
You pulled the bag up.

1225
01:27:45,691 --> 01:27:47,804
<i>I guess you were just too afraid</i>

1226
01:27:47,836 --> 01:27:51,195
to realize that
you were up here,

1227
01:27:51,227 --> 01:27:53,404
<i>all alone.</i>

1228
01:29:05,627 --> 01:29:07,003
<i>Hi, Dad.</i>

1229
01:29:09,051 --> 01:29:11,867
<i>I wanted you to know that I...</i>

1230
01:29:11,899 --> 01:29:13,979
<i>I found my fight again.</i>

1231
01:29:17,788 --> 01:29:19,172
<i>Please leave your message...</i>

1232
01:29:20,635 --> 01:29:22,012
<i>I wanna live.</i>

1233
01:29:23,644 --> 01:29:25,339
<i>I wanna go home,</i>

1234
01:29:27,644 --> 01:29:30,556
<i>but I'm not gonna make it.</i>

1235
01:29:35,995 --> 01:29:38,204
<i>You were right
about everything and I...</i>

1236
01:29:39,260 --> 01:29:40,891
<i>I'm sorry, Dad.</i>

1237
01:29:46,747 --> 01:29:48,604
<i>By the time you see this...</i>

1238
01:29:51,227 --> 01:29:52,315
<i>I'll be gone.</i>

1239
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:01,819
<i>I love you.</i>

1240
01:31:33,692 --> 01:31:35,420
That's it!
Fuck!

1241
01:31:58,971 --> 01:32:00,220
<i>You need energy.</i>

1242
01:32:01,307 --> 01:32:02,683
<i>You should eat something.</i>

1243
01:32:07,100 --> 01:32:08,827
<i>Survival of the fittest.</i>

1244
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:46,907
<i>I can pad the cell
better this time.</i>

1245
01:32:48,155 --> 01:32:49,340
<i>Give me your shoe.</i>

1246
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:06,523
Hunter.

1247
01:34:19,708 --> 01:34:21,211
God, I love you.

1248
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,268
I'm sorry.

1249
01:34:55,004 --> 01:34:56,731
I'm so sorry,

1250
01:34:56,764 --> 01:34:58,531
but I really have to make
sure this gets through.

1251
01:34:58,555 --> 01:35:00,379
God, God, I'm sorry.

1252
01:36:16,411 --> 01:36:17,596
You can't park here.

1253
01:36:17,627 --> 01:36:20,476
Becky!
Becky!

1254
01:36:26,171 --> 01:36:27,196
No.

1255
01:36:28,924 --> 01:36:30,076
No.

1256
01:36:32,603 --> 01:36:34,588
Dad?

1257
01:36:34,619 --> 01:36:35,619
Dad?

1258
01:36:36,923 --> 01:36:37,923
Dad!

1259
01:36:44,123 --> 01:36:46,588
I thought that was you.

1260
01:36:46,619 --> 01:36:50,204
Dad, I love you.
I'm so sorry.

1261
01:36:51,419 --> 01:36:52,859
It's okay.

1262
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:56,092
I just...

1263
01:36:56,123 --> 01:36:57,787
I just want you to be okay.

1264
01:37:01,820 --> 01:37:03,515
I am, you know.

1265
01:37:03,547 --> 01:37:04,667
I'm gonna be okay.

1266
01:37:05,756 --> 01:37:07,228
Really.

1267
01:37:21,691 --> 01:37:22,876
Let's go home.

1268
01:37:25,691 --> 01:37:27,163
<i>Life is fleeting.</i>

1269
01:37:27,899 --> 01:37:29,435
<i>Life is short.</i>

1270
01:37:30,268 --> 01:37:31,547
<i>Too short.</i>

1271
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:34,907
<i>So, you gotta use every moment.</i>

1272
01:37:34,939 --> 01:37:37,979
<i>You have to do something
that makes you feel alive.</i>

1273
01:37:38,011 --> 01:37:39,899
<i>And that shit?</i>

1274
01:37:39,931 --> 01:37:43,804
<i>That would spread that
message far and wide.</i>
