1
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:18,712
Hello, everyone.
My name's Kenneth Branagh

2
00:00:18,812 --> 00:00:21,006
Everyone calls me Ken,

3
00:00:21,106 --> 00:00:23,466
so please feel free to do so
if you choose to talk to me

4
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:26,261
while this director's commentary
is going on.

5
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:28,555
And I'm here to talk a little bit

6
00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:31,558
about how we came to some
of the artistic decisions we made

7
00:00:31,658 --> 00:00:35,954
when we were
creating our new film of <i>Thor</i>.

8
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:41,710
So first off, the marvel of it all.

9
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:49,701
I was asked to do this
back in the summer of 2008.

10
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:52,746
And one of the first things
that we had to decide is,

11
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:54,039
"What's the basic structure?"

12
00:00:54,139 --> 00:00:57,876
And one of the things that I was keen
about was that we should start on Earth.

13
00:00:57,976 --> 00:01:00,545
And so here we are in Puente Antiguo,

14
00:01:00,645 --> 00:01:04,758
"old bridge," for those of you
who know your Spanish, in New Mexico.

15
00:01:04,858 --> 00:01:06,760
And the sequence
that you're watching now

16
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,137
was one of the very first ones
that I worked on

17
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:11,556
with our first storyboard artist,

18
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:15,143
a brilliantly talented young man
called Federico D'Alessandro.

19
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:19,397
And it was about coming up with
a kind of teaser on contemporary Earth

20
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:21,316
that allowed us
to do a number of things.

21
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:25,111
First of all,
introduce a vast Earth landscape,

22
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:28,531
something that could be,
during the course of the picture, epic.

23
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:31,576
I'd worked in New Mexico as an actor,
I'd shot there,

24
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:33,536
and I knew it was
the land of the big sky.

25
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:35,747
And the sense of immensity
in that landscape

26
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:41,002
would be, visually, very powerful
and might work as a very strong mirror

27
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:42,754
for some of the epic landscapes

28
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:46,733
that we would try and convey off Earth,
as it were.

29
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:51,096
We also wanted to take this opportunity
to introduce the audience to characters,

30
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:52,263
contemporary characters.

31
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:55,016
In this case, Jane Foster,
played by Natalie Portman,

32
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:57,519
Erik Selvig, played by Stellan Skarsgård,

33
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:00,955
and Kat Dennings,
who plays Darcy Lewis here,

34
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:02,774
at the front of the movie

35
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:07,487
who are engaged in scientific activity
out in the desert watching the skies,

36
00:02:07,587 --> 00:02:12,383
and who are introduced to
this extraordinary aurora phenomenon.

37
00:02:13,927 --> 00:02:17,747
I will digress in various ways.
Let me tell you a little bit about auroras.

38
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:19,916
This kind of look, this kind of image

39
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:24,087
was the sort of image
that we were finding all over the world

40
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:27,465
during the course of the two
or three years of my involvement with it.

41
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:31,052
So, every time somebody saw some
amazing thing happening over Moscow

42
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:36,516
or over the desert in Finland,
we would pool these kinds of images,

43
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:39,786
and we would talk about it
with our visual effects team.

44
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:44,524
And we would work out how closely
we could mirror actual phenomena

45
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:45,900
that were found on Earth.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,321
And that's where the beginnings
of that Earth-like aurora phenomenon

47
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:55,577
meets the demands of the story,
which calls for a Rainbow Bridge,

48
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:59,956
the Bifrost as the comics have it,
which is part of the means

49
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:04,769
by which our characters will travel
from world to world.

50
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:09,340
This first shocking moment
of a race through the desert

51
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,260
and then hitting a man
who we don't quite see

52
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,846
was always a strong feeling

53
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:19,017
about literally starting the movie
with a bang in a big landscape,

54
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:20,852
new characters,
contemporary characters,

55
00:03:20,952 --> 00:03:24,189
a race, a chase,
and then a big question mark,

56
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:26,374
where did he come from?

57
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:33,198
And so, here, at this point in the movie,
in the original version of the screenplay,

58
00:03:33,298 --> 00:03:36,451
there was the idea
of some kind of prologue.

59
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:38,328
So, you have a teaser
to allow the audience,

60
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:40,016
perhaps, to understand
we'll be back on Earth,

61
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:42,707
a landscape and people
that we'll enjoy being with.

62
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:46,795
But now we go
into a version of a prologue

63
00:03:46,895 --> 00:03:51,090
that tries to introduce
some of the thematic material,

64
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,428
some of the world
of the larger <i>Thor</i> universe.

65
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:59,557
So here, for instance,
this Scandinavian influence, this fjord,

66
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:01,993
this world of Tonsberg, Norway,

67
00:04:02,702 --> 00:04:07,190
a name, indeed, which those of you
interested in the larger Marvel Universe,

68
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,753
may well find features elsewhere.

69
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:16,366
But as you can see through this
very concentrated, condensed,

70
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:20,094
we hope very impactive
storytelling here,

71
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,913
certainly what we were aiming for,

72
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:25,959
we introduce both the Viking element
in Viking Earth

73
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:27,564
and then the arrival of the Frost Giants.

74
00:04:27,644 --> 00:04:31,130
The Frost Giants are going to be
enormously important in our story

75
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,843
and technically, we created them

76
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:39,389
by actually designing
some very impressive make-ups

77
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:41,307
that real actors wore,

78
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:45,620
as well as creating some
computer-generated versions of them.

79
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:48,481
The King of the Frost Giants,

80
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:52,527
who is facing off here
with Anthony Hopkins as Odin,

81
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:55,989
was played by Colm Feore,
a marvellous Canadian actor,

82
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:58,549
and we wanted anybody
who had to face off

83
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:02,120
against the magnificent master
of the screen, Anthony Hopkins,

84
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:08,459
to be also wonderfully charismatic
and able to convey a little with a lot,

85
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:13,564
and Colm Feore, with the role of Laufey,
did just that.

86
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:18,177
We wanted, here, to understand
that there had been a battle,

87
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:21,222
as there were so many
in the history of the Norse myths

88
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:24,684
and the history of the Marvel version
of the comics,

89
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:28,313
that this is a warrior race
full of historical examples

90
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:32,483
of where they fought and lost worlds
and gained worlds,

91
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,003
and how their history was forged,

92
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,967
but also how their lives are led,
which is to tell tales of yore,

93
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,620
tales of dashing exploits.

94
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,373
And it allowed us also
to talk about where Jotunheim was,

95
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:50,501
and where Asgard is in the universe,

96
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:55,465
and to introduce it through
this rather disguised upside down shot

97
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:58,509
that may or may not be
some kind of power source,

98
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:01,012
some kind of lighting,

99
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:03,848
some sense
of an almost nuclear reactor

100
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:05,683
at the bottom of what we now see

101
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:09,270
revealed through the water,
is a fjord-like land.

102
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,375
You have the magic of the buildings
on the right floating above their base

103
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,366
and then this vast central tower
at the back of an Asgard,

104
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:26,079
which is very much influenced
by Jack Kirby, by empire,

105
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:28,873
this kind of image
that you might expect to see

106
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:30,875
in the Roman or Grecian empires.

107
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:33,920
And here, another example
of how we evoke Asgard,

108
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,048
which is with a shot like this,
that is a sort of cityscape shot,

109
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:40,426
to absolutely maximise
what I'll talk a little bit about later on,

110
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:42,528
which is 3-D.

111
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:48,159
But for now, let's find ourselves here,
arrived in Asgard,

112
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:51,162
with young Thor and young Loki.

113
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:57,043
These are terrific performers.
Dakota is Thor and Ted is Loki,

114
00:06:57,502 --> 00:07:00,905
and they were remarkable
for their ability

115
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:04,784
to capture something of the essence
of the older actors who play them,

116
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:06,744
and also to have fun with

117
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:10,790
and be up to speed
with Mr. Hopkins in this scene.

118
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:15,061
They loved being in this set,
this vault set, which we constructed.

119
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:19,841
Many of the sets, we constructed
because there was a concern

120
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:21,592
that we do as much as we can
to make sure

121
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:26,764
that as exotic and fantastical as some
of the worlds in the movie should be,

122
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,850
it should not feel synthetic.

123
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,935
There's a sort of relative reality

124
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:36,707
we discovered that we wanted to have
in a superhero movie, in this case,

125
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:41,154
which somehow wants you to believe
everything, even though it's fantastical.

126
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:43,740
And building sets
was part of seeing real textures,

127
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,701
real interaction with real people,
real shadows,

128
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:50,788
so that when we go to
the entirely computer-generated world,

129
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,791
which is the case
with a shot like that one,

130
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:59,881
we can feel the reality
of an architectural structure like this,

131
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:05,970
the great hall for the ceremony
that will be about to have Thor king.

132
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:10,641
And so this vast crown,
the great doors behind, the vast throne,

133
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:13,728
all of it were constructed
over many months by Bo Welch,

134
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:17,999
our production designer's
great art direction construction team.

135
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,712
And it did make a great difference,

136
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:22,695
for instance, here, to Chris Hemsworth,
who's our wonderful Thor,

137
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:26,616
embodying that willful,
rather arrogant, young warrior,

138
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:29,327
who needs to walk
through the halls of Asgard

139
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:33,164
for the purposes of our story,
as if he absolutely owns it.

140
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:35,541
So, if you're in a great space like that...

141
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:38,086
Although, it's entirely possible
for actors to imagine it,

142
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:39,440
they do it in the theatre all the time,

143
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,173
you have an empty space,
you have to imagine some exotic place.

144
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:45,009
Nevertheless, here,
with that costume on,

145
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:50,348
these golden walls, with this curious
mixture of a sort of primitive qualify

146
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:54,852
to the whole layout
with the patterns on the floor,

147
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:58,815
but also the sense
in the finish on the walls of a material

148
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:02,860
that you believe could be made
by a race that travels through space,

149
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,196
so that they are
technologically advanced,

150
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:06,697
much more advanced than us,

151
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:09,492
but also they have this
callback to an ancient culture

152
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:11,536
that uses ancient weapons,

153
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:16,624
like that spear, Gungnir,
the all-powerful weapon of Odin,

154
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:21,145
Mjolnir, the hard-to-pronounce
mighty hammer of Thor,

155
00:09:21,938 --> 00:09:25,399
an iconic part of the <i>Thor</i> story.

156
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,635
And I, as the director,
I love this combination

157
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:31,389
of the ancient and the modern,
the primitive and the sophisticated.

158
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:33,641
A character like Loki
wearing his horned helmet,

159
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:36,602
but they're inside
these kinds of remarkable buildings

160
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:40,648
which have their own
partly Viking-influenced layout,

161
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:45,570
but also have this
kind of super sci-fi qualify.

162
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,156
For me,
it was a fascinating combination

163
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:50,341
to try and bring to bear.

164
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,537
People interested
in the larger Marvel Universe, I think,

165
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:56,392
may be interested
to answer the questions of,

166
00:09:56,472 --> 00:10:01,018
what are those additional items
in these alcoves, in this vault?

167
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:04,463
One of the enjoyments of being
part of that larger Marvel Universe

168
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:08,259
was being able to, wherever we could,
maybe just offer a little indication

169
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:11,429
of how other elements of it
might play here

170
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:13,264
that perhaps feature elsewhere.

171
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:16,934
And so, I encourage
anybody who fancies doing it

172
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,745
to maybe have some fun working out
what else was in the vault.

173
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,698
It's time, probably,
to talk a little bit about

174
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:34,760
what, I think,
is the luxury casting of our film.

175
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:37,558
That man, Anthony Hopkins,
if you're going to cast someone

176
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:41,209
who looks as though he should
run the universe, he's your man.

177
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:45,046
It's a universe that has to protect itself
against this kind of thing,

178
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:48,341
the vicious violence of the Frost Giants,

179
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,927
these creatures
who can terraform worlds

180
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:52,929
as they do with the vault there,

181
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:56,641
creating ice that encapsulates the walls,
the water,

182
00:10:56,741 --> 00:11:01,037
being able to produce ice weapons
from their very hands.

183
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:04,232
But they are not invulnerable

184
00:11:04,332 --> 00:11:07,485
to something
as extraordinary as the Destroyer,

185
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:13,366
and we get a tiny hint of this creature
ruled by, run by Odin,

186
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:18,871
who will appear later on in the film
and who is a sort of killing machine.

187
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:20,623
This was a very early decision

188
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:23,918
to choose that particular creature,
monster, machine,

189
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:28,105
whatever you like to call the Destroyer,
as a key element in our picture.

190
00:11:30,608 --> 00:11:32,343
This brings me back to the casting,

191
00:11:32,443 --> 00:11:34,845
and how, with some of the things
we've spoken about,

192
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:38,808
the idea that at the centre of this there
would be a film that you could refer to

193
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:44,814
as being about fathers and sons,
or, indeed, about who would be king.

194
00:11:44,914 --> 00:11:45,960
Some people have said to me,

195
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,151
"There are Shakespearean
connections here."

196
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:52,363
Where I think connections lie
are between what Stan Lee was after,

197
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:55,700
and what classic, mythic tales look at,

198
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,554
and in this case, it is the story
of a fitness for responsibility.

199
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:05,376
Thor, here, reacts to the same thing
that Odin's reacting to.

200
00:12:05,476 --> 00:12:08,713
Odin reacts with what one might call
judgment and discretion.

201
00:12:08,813 --> 00:12:11,215
Young Thor, here,
is without those qualities,

202
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:14,635
he simply wants to go and hit out.

203
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:17,430
He wants to punch, he wants to fight.

204
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,724
And it looks like that may be the way

205
00:12:19,824 --> 00:12:22,184
he's going to run
his version of the kingdom.

206
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:25,896
But as you see in that very effective
reading from Anthony Hopkins,

207
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,624
he isn't king yet.

208
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:33,424
When we did this scene, and Anthony
Hopkins came out with that reading,

209
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:35,823
it was one of the moments
which we subsequently learned,

210
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:39,243
as it started to play,
where you could feel for what we hope

211
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:41,329
would be all the fun
of the opening of the film.

212
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:43,309
This was a moment
where the temperature changed a bit,

213
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:46,334
and suddenly you realise that
there was actually a very passionate

214
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:51,380
and hot familial relationship
at the centre of it.

215
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,008
We often talked about it,
for all that they're speaking

216
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:57,028
in a slightly more heightened way,
and they're speaking with this passion,

217
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:59,805
and here they are on an asteroid
at the top of the universe,

218
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:03,267
but we would often say
that the sort of emotional feeling here

219
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:08,647
is entirely contemporary in terms of
what a father might relate to his sons

220
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,649
and the frustration
that the sons might feel.

221
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:13,235
And so, that was something
in rehearsal

222
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,322
we did many times
ahead of the actual shooting.

223
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:18,949
We tried to encourage.
You just wanted to believe these people.

224
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,409
And in this scene, for instance,

225
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,453
you want to believe
that these two are brothers,

226
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:25,581
and that the Warriors Three
and the Lady Sif,

227
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:28,084
who join them here,
are their genuine friends.

228
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:32,088
The sense, however briefly done,
but in the feel of how it's done,

229
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:34,298
in the way they react to each other,

230
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:36,550
in the kind of intimacy
and the knowledge,

231
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,096
in the almost casual way
they talk to each other,

232
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:42,326
that they know each other,
that they go back a long way,

233
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:45,893
that in this case, as we had rehearsed it
and built our backstory,

234
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:48,896
they'd been to the
Asgardian Academy, if you like,

235
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:52,233
that they'd already been
through many battles.

236
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:56,320
So that when Fandral and the others
now suggest to Thor

237
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,155
that it's madness to go to Jotunheim,

238
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:02,493
we believe that they've been on other
similar kinds of adventures,

239
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:03,931
that they're bonded,
that they're a group,

240
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,011
in fact, they're a group
that we want to be with.

241
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:10,334
And so, this was very important
as a means of understanding

242
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:13,379
that they were this kind of group,
if you like, of young cadets.

243
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:16,215
And also here,
as throughout the rest of the movie,

244
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:19,510
there's a kind of lightness of tone,
a lightness of touch

245
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,012
that's embodied
by the warmth between them,

246
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:25,241
and then a kind of reaction like this
from Thor.

247
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,374
So, that kind of back and forth,
we wanted to enjoy.

248
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:57,506
<i>Thor</i> is an epic,
and here with this kind of shot,

249
00:14:57,606 --> 00:15:00,551
with the use of the horses
against this extraordinary cityscape,

250
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:04,472
the sense of breadth
and the geography itself,

251
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:07,183
these massive golden gates,

252
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:10,436
and then this iconic element
of the <i>Thor</i> universe,

253
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:12,938
the Rainbow Bridge, the Bifrost,

254
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:17,501
which in the comics is a sort of
psychedelic, turning, right-angled thing

255
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:20,070
that leads all the way
from Asgard to Earth.

256
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,573
Here is a literal bridge,

257
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:27,578
but with, clearly, energies
running through it that are very special.

258
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:31,248
It was something that took us
many, many, many months,

259
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:35,711
really the whole of the design process,
to perfect to our satisfaction.

260
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:40,299
It was tied into this building behind
the glorious Idris Elba as Heimdall,

261
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,776
his observatory, as we called it.

262
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,722
We tried
every kind of experiment with it,

263
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:48,118
as you'll see in some of the shots.

264
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:52,895
The bridge and the light impacts
on the bridge as people walk on it

265
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,606
change slightly.
The way in which they do that

266
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:59,235
has been something we've
experimented with in very many ways.

267
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:02,947
The actual nature
of the substance of the bridge

268
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:07,326
we researched
in terms of modern plastics,

269
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:11,789
in terms of the make-up of quartz,
et cetera, and crystals.

270
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:15,876
We tried every kind of version
of this fusion

271
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,587
between a light source, a light energy

272
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,590
that would play very importantly
into the story at the end,

273
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:25,261
but that also had the sort of magical feel
that we were after.

274
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:29,640
As I said, it was tied into this idea
of this turret, this observatory,

275
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,186
this globe, which in terms of directing
people away from Asgard,

276
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:36,647
was now something
directed by Heimdall

277
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:39,567
who, with this extraordinary
inner mechanism,

278
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:44,029
could direct this gun, this nozzle,
this turret, this observatory

279
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,531
into the universe.

280
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:50,160
And through the way
in which the lightning connects

281
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,163
and reflects on the interior,

282
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:56,166
creates a kind of an astral map,

283
00:16:56,266 --> 00:17:02,631
an astral map reflecting, if you like, the
patterns of Yggdrasil, the tree of life.

284
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,466
So, you see an idea of it here,

285
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:07,511
as if it's some sort of extraordinary
underground map,

286
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:13,684
or some sort of roadmap where
he chooses a place inside that nebula,

287
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:19,248
inside that vast galactic solar system
that is Yggdrasil

288
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,900
through which
the Nine Realms are spread.

289
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,295
He chooses the destination
and he sends you there.

290
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:28,799
And here they are
being drawn into the Bifrost.

291
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:36,540
And that was me enjoying
taking the sound out completely

292
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,751
to try and create the real impact

293
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:43,172
of passing through this,
sort of, time warp, space warp,

294
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:46,216
so that they have travelled
through the Bifrost,

295
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:49,136
through the trees
and the branches of the Bifrost,

296
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:52,489
until they land here on Jotunheim.

297
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:56,060
So, the logic of that,
sort of, space travel,

298
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,229
Heimdall's position up there
as the lonely attendant,

299
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:03,233
as the guardian of Asgard,
the last person you see as you leave,

300
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,527
the first person you see as you return.

301
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:08,197
I'm very pleased with
the way everybody worked on that.

302
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:12,076
We had a marvellous
visual effects supervisor in Wes Sewell,

303
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:14,036
who was full of brilliant ideas for that,

304
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:18,624
as was Bo Welch, whose team built
so much of the observatory itself.

305
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:20,476
Beautiful finishes.

306
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,589
Here we come to Jotunheim.

307
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:30,469
Jotunheim, we'd imagined as this
once absolutely splendid city of ice,

308
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:34,848
also like Asgard, from a civilisation
that were very sophisticated

309
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:40,229
and yet had this primal connection
to the source of their power,

310
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:46,276
water, ice, cold,
all concentrated in the blue Casket

311
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:49,113
that has been stolen from them,
in their view, by Odin,

312
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:53,242
the Casket of Ancient Winters,
and it's that almost nuclear device

313
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:55,035
that would allow them to leave here.

314
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,706
First of all, to restore this
to its former glory, then leave here,

315
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:00,082
travel through the Nine Realms,

316
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:04,878
and terraform and conquer other worlds
with this terrible, icy power.

317
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,588
So, in this opening sequence,

318
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:10,217
which is a combination of work
that we did on some set

319
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:14,071
and some CGI,
realised by Digital Domain

320
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:19,560
amongst our many VFX vendors
and partners that we worked with,

321
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:24,648
we wanted to create this
sense of dread at what Jotunheim,

322
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:28,402
the now broken-down Jotunheim,
the angry planet,

323
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:31,572
the planet full of emptiness
and echoes and pain,

324
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:34,258
what that would bring to the story.

325
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:54,820
There you hear for the first time
a slight treatment of the voice of Laufey.

326
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:58,390
And here we see a proper,
sort of, first appearance

327
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:03,579
for this deadly red-eyed
King of the Frost Giants.

328
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:06,774
Colm Feore, unbelievably patient

329
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:10,360
about the five, six hours
it would take him

330
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,239
to get into the full body make-up
that we used for him.

331
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:16,909
Legacy was the company
that we worked with,

332
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:19,244
and they had an incredibly dedicated
team of people

333
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:23,207
who were up in the small hours
working with him.

334
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:28,212
And he's an example of the kind of actor
who really can use the make-up.

335
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:30,047
Not do too much, be very still,

336
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:34,885
allow the make-up
to really inform who he is,

337
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:38,722
and so the acting comes in from under
and it's very, very powerful.

338
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:41,950
This is an interesting moment for Thor

339
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,687
because, in a way, it's his gamble,
it's his risk,

340
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:48,982
and we see the point
to which perhaps he can be pushed,

341
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:53,570
before he brutally risks war,

342
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:58,742
by potentially provoking
and whether he is capable of listening.

343
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,245
It's a slight sort of shading

344
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:03,622
on what we may have
to understand about him later on.

345
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:07,709
Just before all of this kicks off, might be
worth talking about, briefly here,

346
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,519
we will again, costumes.

347
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:11,797
Alexandra Byrne did the costumes.

348
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:13,924
She's an Oscar-winning
costume designer.

349
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,509
I've worked with her many times

350
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:18,846
and started with her back in the theatre
nearly 30 years ago.

351
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:21,265
Her attention to detail
in Thor's costume was amazing,

352
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:23,016
from those discs to the cape,

353
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,894
to the way it sculpted itself
around Chris Hemsworth's body,

354
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:30,123
to the way it was influenced
by the comics and by the Norse myths,

355
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:40,450
and the way in which a confident
and cocky Thor can move in it.

356
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:44,554
So, here you'll see these costumes
under great stress and strain.

357
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:48,667
And the fight you're about to see,
the first big, major action sequence,

358
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:51,879
was one where we wanted to make sure
that everybody amongst the Asgardians

359
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:55,299
had a chance to have
some kind of signature move,

360
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:59,152
particularly, of course, Thor,
who is the provocateur here.

361
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,223
And at the same time,
we wanted to showcase

362
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,809
the incredible threat
of the Frost Giants themselves,

363
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:09,938
this dormant, pain-filled race,
who are now pouring out

364
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:13,358
from every conceivable part
of this mixture.

365
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:17,821
Is it stone, is it jade, is it ice? Exactly
what is this world constructed of?

366
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:20,032
But it's dangerous, it's lethal,

367
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:24,161
and potentially has
many, many more of its population

368
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:27,097
than Thor is currently considering.

369
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:31,209
Meantime, the general philosophy
for the fight was, as you can see,

370
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:35,230
to try and put the audience
as close into it as possible.

371
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:36,798
For my first film, <i>Henry V,</i>

372
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:40,177
I had the great pleasure of working
with a wonderful second unit director

373
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:44,348
and a great stuntman as well,
Vic Armstrong,

374
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:46,266
whose work you'll know
from many Bond films,

375
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:47,768
from the <i>Raiders</i> films,

376
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:51,855
from him being an incredibly
impressive double for Harrison Ford,

377
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:56,276
and having been a very effective
and brilliant director of many things,

378
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,362
but action being one of them.

379
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,447
I worked with him and his team,
Andy Armstrong

380
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:03,884
and the Armstrong clan,
who are a great part of our industry,

381
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:10,415
and we worked to, first of all, find out
what everybody's individual gifts were.

382
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:14,378
We did a kind of boot camp and
we made sure everybody was flexible,

383
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:16,880
that Fandral could be flashy
with his sword,

384
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,633
that Tom Hiddleston here, as Loki,

385
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:24,404
could use the daggers in an interesting
way that are part of his character.

386
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:27,391
And that we could,
with long lens photography,

387
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:29,559
sometimes do what we did in <i>Henry V,</i>

388
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:32,562
which is to try and put people
inside the battle, closer,

389
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:35,148
in this sense of a hectic,
frenzied moment

390
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:37,150
where things like that can happen.

391
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:42,322
You turn around and suddenly,
the taking your eye off what's going on

392
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:44,574
for even a second
is lethal and dangerous.

393
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:49,037
So, we wanted there to be
this sense of hurry and of frenzy.

394
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:52,040
It was less about huge, wide shots

395
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,836
showing hundreds and thousands of
people fighting each other at this point,

396
00:23:55,936 --> 00:24:00,507
but more a dirty scrum
that leads to this kind of revelation

397
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:03,760
that once again, Thor, cocky Thor,

398
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:09,141
has underestimated
what this angry, hurt race have in store.

399
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:12,602
And here, what appeared to be
a statue or a plinth

400
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:14,938
that was commemorating
some great beast of the past,

401
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,275
that was announcing the entranceway
to this part of the city,

402
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,610
turns out to be, in fact, a sleeping giant,

403
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:25,615
this beast that now is headed
towards the rest of the Asgardians

404
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:28,552
who are leaving with the hurt Fandral.

405
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:36,043
The inclusion of the beast happened
about halfway through post-production,

406
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:39,212
where the original beat in the story
had thousands,

407
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:43,050
hundreds of thousands of Frost Giants
emerging from under the earth,

408
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,261
and by this stage of the battle,
we felt we'd done it,

409
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:50,640
so we needed an additional element,
and I was very, very pleased

410
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:55,520
that we came up with and then enjoyed
the idea of this ice monster

411
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,440
doing this kind of chasing,

412
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,692
while the damage that Thor has done,

413
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:04,279
which is essentially
breaking the very floor of the planet up,

414
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:07,282
is at work in the same way.

415
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:12,162
These kinds of shots, this massive shot
with Jotunheim falling,

416
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:16,725
with the creature upside down is
a great idea of Federico D'Alessandro.

417
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:19,731
Part of the process, where for me,

418
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:23,507
as a relative newcomer
to the world of big visual effects shots,

419
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:25,133
happens very late in the day,

420
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:28,178
so many of these shots,
which I was thrilled by,

421
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:30,305
were always planned
and I knew what was coming.

422
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:33,016
But it was really quite late in the day
when they arrived,

423
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:36,561
so the experience
in a visual effects picture,

424
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:38,730
where you've worked on it
for maybe two, three years

425
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:42,692
of the full understanding that
that's gonna happen,

426
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:45,695
doesn't quite get to you
until the last minute.

427
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:47,531
So, it's a little harum-scarum.

428
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:49,533
The visual effects shots
are cooking away,

429
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,535
and eventually they arrive,

430
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:55,222
and when they do,
you get a lot of magic right at the end.

431
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:59,835
Meantime, of course,
you're mixing sound,

432
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:02,838
and you're mixing and creating
other visual effects,

433
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:06,591
like the additional snow here,
or like these additional Frost Giants.

434
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:12,389
And you need to be very, very confident
in all of your fellows.

435
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:15,851
We had a great head of visual effects
in Victoria Alonso

436
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:18,812
and a great VFX producer
in Diana Giorgiutti.

437
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:21,398
And they worked all hours
that God sent

438
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:23,859
with their team to make sure

439
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:27,612
that if you needed
an eight-legged horse in time,

440
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,490
then Sleipnir would arrive.

441
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:33,785
Sleipnir, the eight-legged horse,
I absolutely love.

442
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:36,037
For those of you
familiar with the Norse myths,

443
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:42,294
you'll know that Sleipnir has many
adventures of his own across the myths,

444
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:45,922
and in fact, one of the challenges for us
when we came to this material,

445
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:49,009
was just what to select, what to include.

446
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:52,596
There are Nine Realms,
there are dwarves, there are elves,

447
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:56,141
there are Norns, there are characters,

448
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:59,828
hugely important characters
like Balder, like Princess Karnilla.

449
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:09,613
There were so many opportunities to
create so many different kinds of story,

450
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:15,035
but our real sense, both for
the devotees, for the aficionados

451
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:17,037
and I hope for people new to the story,

452
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:21,683
was that we would try
and tell a genuine origins story

453
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:26,046
full of this kind of excitement,
this kind of warring worlds,

454
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:29,174
but that actually, at the centre of it,
the backbone of it,

455
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:31,676
apart from the antagonism
of someone like Laufey

456
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:35,238
and his very disappointed,
revengeful race there,

457
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:40,936
at the centre of it was a story of, as I've
mentioned before, fathers and sons.

458
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:45,899
Now, here we come to a scene
which encapsulates this struggle

459
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:48,777
between an Odin
who is absolutely serious

460
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:53,156
about how difficult and how necessary
and how precarious a job it is

461
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:58,161
to protect the safety of the Nine Realms,
the whole of the known universe,

462
00:27:58,261 --> 00:28:01,623
and a son who seems to be
working on instinct,

463
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:04,501
an instinct that doesn't seem to be
serving him very well.

464
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:07,771
He may have set off
some kind of nuclear war.

465
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,174
And here you have a chance
for a kind of passion

466
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:14,177
between these characters
that I think is unusual,

467
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:17,055
because the stakes are so high,
the universe is at stake,

468
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:19,349
it can take this level of feeling.

469
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:23,144
So here, when Anthony Hopkins
receives this blow, this dismissal,

470
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:25,939
a line that Prince Hal might have
said to Falstaff

471
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,733
in the <i>Henry IV</i> plays in Shakespeare,

472
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,527
you see him take the hurt.

473
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:37,158
You still see the lion roaring
in relation to Tom Hiddleston as Loki,

474
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:41,663
but you have this great capacity
for feeling conveyed through simplicity,

475
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:44,124
but he's not afraid of the fire of it.

476
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:47,852
So, you feel the incredible passion
at the centre of the picture,

477
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:50,108
and so you know when they're playing
with this kind of intensify,

478
00:28:50,188 --> 00:28:52,799
that we hopefully will be
able to come back here

479
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:55,802
and want to know
how this story is resolved.

480
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:58,988
Who will be king?
What will happen to Asgard?

481
00:28:59,614 --> 00:29:02,575
Is Odin's heart broken?
Is it more than that?

482
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:08,398
But we're feeling the beginning of a
very marked moment in Thor's journey,

483
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:14,154
a journey which will literally see us see
him change from that arrogant youth,

484
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:18,491
who paraded and cheered his way down
that ceremonial room,

485
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:21,494
to someone who is going to have to
think seriously about

486
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:23,680
whether he belongs here.

487
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:35,525
I love this cashiering moment.

488
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,557
There he goes. There's a biblical line
and it's a biblical action.

489
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:43,641
The fall of man.

490
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:46,770
Thor falls from the Garden of Eden,
if you'd like, from Asgard,

491
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,813
and he's stripped, court martial-like,

492
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:51,733
an image that I pulled
from <i>The Dreyfus Affair</i>

493
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,443
Paul Muni and <i>The Dreyfus Affair,</i>

494
00:29:53,543 --> 00:29:57,113
ancient film about an extraordinary
scandal in the French government

495
00:29:57,213 --> 00:29:58,865
in the late 19th century.

496
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:01,201
And they pull the epaulets
off the uniform,

497
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:03,912
and I wanted to do it in that scene.

498
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:09,100
And then to bring that
extraordinary leap through space,

499
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:13,004
for our hero to return to the place

500
00:30:13,104 --> 00:30:16,608
from where he first began
at the beginning of the movie.

501
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:19,803
And as we come to this scene,

502
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:22,242
one of the things we noticed
when we started to screen the movie

503
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:25,308
or just spoilers, et cetera,
for a work in progress.

504
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:27,185
Because they don't become public ones,

505
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:30,021
because of the dread, fear and terror

506
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:32,732
that negative things
might be written on the Internet

507
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:37,587
or just spoilers, et cetera,
for a work in progress.

508
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:39,948
We realised that this return to Earth

509
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:41,678
was something
that people were really enjoying.

510
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:45,745
They felt pleased to be back
amongst these characters.

511
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:49,707
Of course, now you're looking at Thor
in a completely different way.

512
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:55,547
You're bringing to this the sense of
all of that drama and grandeur

513
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:56,840
that went on up in Asgard,

514
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,343
but it's backing up
against a modern sensibility,

515
00:31:00,443 --> 00:31:02,887
which inevitably results in it
being quite funny.

516
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:06,015
Absurd and surreal in some ways,
but funny.

517
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:10,228
And back to what we started talking
about at the beginning of this,

518
00:31:10,328 --> 00:31:13,857
contemporary Earth
and humour were two ways

519
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:18,111
in which I felt we had to go
in order to blend

520
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:20,947
and make successfully
stay in the same film,

521
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:23,741
all of these many combinations
of the fantastical elements,

522
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:27,078
the space elements,
the Jotunheim elements,

523
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:32,292
the drama up there and the investigation
and the science down here,

524
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:35,920
all of it had to include
a sense of humour, basically,

525
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:40,049
a sense of humour that you've seen
Chris Hemsworth embody

526
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:41,801
in his performance

527
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:47,640
and that we definitely see here in the
reactions of Selvig, and of Jane Foster

528
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,993
and of Kat Dennings as Darcy.

529
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:54,731
Once again, the beginnings now
of the classic tale,

530
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:59,110
the classic tension, if you like,
of a god amongst men

531
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,279
starts to play out comically.

532
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:05,408
Let's talk a little bit,
as we see Thor on Earth,

533
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:08,578
about the casting of Chris Hemsworth.

534
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:11,414
About 6'3 ", 6'4",
a young Australian actor,

535
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:15,585
I met him at the beginning of the
three- or four-month casting process,

536
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:18,296
and we didn't know much about
what our Thor was going to be like.

537
00:32:18,396 --> 00:32:20,965
He had a cold, I don't think anyone
had given him any pages,

538
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:23,843
maybe we didn't have
any pages of the script.

539
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:27,180
It was a little unsuccessful,
I suppose, our meeting.

540
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,641
And then, about three months later,

541
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:31,809
when we had met people
from all over the world

542
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:33,770
and tested some people,

543
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:37,482
we knew much more
about what our character should be like,

544
00:32:37,582 --> 00:32:42,879
as we see the crater here
made by the falling Mjolnir.

545
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:46,491
When we understood that we needed
this character to change,

546
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:48,576
there would be
an acting range required,

547
00:32:48,676 --> 00:32:53,222
that he couldn't just be muscle,
he couldn't just be brute strength,

548
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:57,293
we were then lucky enough
and smart enough, in some way,

549
00:32:57,393 --> 00:33:01,089
one of us was, not me, to understand
we should get Chris back in

550
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:02,777
if he was prepared to do so.
And come in.

551
00:33:02,857 --> 00:33:06,069
And we did meet, and we talked
and we workshopped and we tested,

552
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:10,723
and he told Thor war stories, and
he was involved in passionate scenes,

553
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:14,143
and he had romantic scenes,
and he did some physical work

554
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:15,853
and he absolutely owned it.

555
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:18,648
He walked in and took the part
by the scruff of the neck,

556
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:24,237
and one realised that we'd be luckier
than a lucky thing to have him.

557
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:27,907
So, Chris Hemsworth,
additionally to all of that,

558
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:30,451
showed himself
to be a natural screen actor.

559
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:31,831
He knows how to hold the screen,

560
00:33:31,928 --> 00:33:36,599
he knows how to be
in front of the camera, not just to do.

561
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:42,505
And so, I feel very, very lucky
that this movie has him at its heart

562
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:45,508
because he carries it off.

563
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:48,678
And he's able to carry the movie,
no mean feat.

564
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:50,700
Here are two people
who have carried movies before,

565
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:56,853
the beautiful, wondrous, intelligent,
funny, sharp, true Ms. Natalie Portman,

566
00:33:56,953 --> 00:34:00,189
and the brilliant Mr. Stellan Skarsgård
you've seen in a thousand films.

567
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:03,943
He's a ubiquitous actor,
always striking, always brilliant.

568
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:07,530
And there you've seen already lines
that have amused and thrilled us,

569
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:10,742
Kat Dennings, who is a brilliant
comedian, excellent actress.

570
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:12,869
The three of them got on very, very well,

571
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:16,706
and they lend this scientific credibility
to the story of this,

572
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:18,374
the man who fell to Earth.

573
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:21,978
Here, an image
from inside that funnel cloud.

574
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:26,507
I enjoy, in this shot, the red shoes,

575
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:31,220
the red Crocs on the right side of frame.

576
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,492
And the colour palette throughout,

577
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:35,642
we try and be as subtle
and intelligent with as we can.

578
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:39,162
The blues and the reds there
that echo Thor's costume.

579
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:43,524
And that's something that we discussed,
obviously, with Bo Welch,

580
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:45,693
who gave me a nice, clean room there,

581
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:48,488
with Alex Byrne,
who gave me the simple costumes.

582
00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:50,573
And of course, crucially
with Haris Zambarloukos,

583
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:52,241
our director of photography

584
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:55,745
who was involved with this project
from the very earliest days.

585
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:58,831
And he and I, with models of the sets

586
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:02,351
and an entire mini lighting rig-up,

587
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:05,922
would play,
as if with a kind of doll's house,

588
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:08,174
on the interior of something like this.

589
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:11,636
Then we'd go out to a real interior,
and way ahead of time,

590
00:35:11,736 --> 00:35:15,239
we would practise
what we wanted from the lighting.

591
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:20,369
His contribution was crucial,
as are moments like this.

592
00:35:30,213 --> 00:35:34,033
It made me laugh the first time we did it,
it's made me laugh every time since.

593
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:36,828
I think it's funny when people,
cruel as it is,

594
00:35:36,928 --> 00:35:38,246
get hit in moments like that.

595
00:35:38,346 --> 00:35:40,998
Obviously, it's a bit
of a running gag for Thor.

596
00:35:41,098 --> 00:35:45,128
This scene,
fans of the comics will know,

597
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:48,439
has appeared in varying versions
of the comics,

598
00:35:49,524 --> 00:35:53,469
and I love it for the fun
and for the colour that it introduces,

599
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:58,391
but I just also enjoy the fact
that this is Stan Lee,

600
00:35:58,491 --> 00:36:01,144
who you may see
coming up in a moment.

601
00:36:01,244 --> 00:36:04,564
And the Marvelistas
raiding the Norse myths,

602
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:09,252
but also popping in their own
Arthurian moment with Excalibur.

603
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:15,366
And there's Stan Lee asking,
"Did it work?"

604
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:19,370
No, Excalibur or Mjolnir, in this case,
is still in the stone

605
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,789
or in the rock, in this case.

606
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:23,853
I had lunch with Stan Lee
before we started shooting.

607
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:27,086
He's the most extraordinary
mixture of energy

608
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:29,505
and intelligence and kindness.

609
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:35,178
His insights into the character and
his generosity about his invitation to us

610
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:38,347
to do with him what we would
were incredible.

611
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:40,825
He was really a joy to work with.

612
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:45,563
This work,
evidenced in Chris Hemsworth's torso,

613
00:36:45,663 --> 00:36:51,444
was the product of his six, nine months
of very intensive work in the gym,

614
00:36:51,544 --> 00:36:53,154
and I thought that I might risk saying

615
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:57,784
that I'd had his head pasted
onto my body here for this sequence,

616
00:36:57,884 --> 00:36:59,472
but I fear that you wouldn't believe me,

617
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:01,996
so I guess I'm just going to have
to tell you that it was him.

618
00:37:02,096 --> 00:37:04,373
And I remember
a few days before we shot this

619
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:07,668
saying rather embarrassedly,
"Hey, Chris, I want to do this shot,

620
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:10,880
"it seems important to me
that we reveal Thor in this way.

621
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,717
"Do you mind taking your shirt off?"
To which he replied, "Do I mind?

622
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:16,636
"I've been doing this
for nine months, mate."

623
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:18,805
"Of course I'm gonna get my shirt off."

624
00:37:18,905 --> 00:37:24,060
I'm glad he did, because it's produced
gasps in early screenings,

625
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,022
and we needed Thor to look like a god,
Chris Hemsworth does.

626
00:37:28,122 --> 00:37:30,691
Here is the home of the gods, Asgard,

627
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:34,946
where from that
beautiful evocation of the city,

628
00:37:35,046 --> 00:37:38,741
we pan into
another one of Bo Welch's great sets.

629
00:37:38,841 --> 00:37:41,869
Above you see
what is a ram's head, inverted,

630
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:46,474
which becomes the canopy
to this real fire.

631
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:50,545
Beautiful shot, I think,
that one of Jaimie Alexander as Sif.

632
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:53,923
Let me talk a little bit about these
excellent actors, starting with this man.

633
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:58,219
Tom Hiddleston, I worked with in
the theatre and on television in England,

634
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:02,031
and he brings to Loki
an intellectual complexity.

635
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:06,577
He has a real swiftness of thought.

636
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:10,898
Tom has a fine sense of humour,
so you can get Loki, the mischief maker.

637
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:14,402
He, like all the others, did an enormous
amount of work by way of preparation,

638
00:38:14,502 --> 00:38:17,655
by way of research into the comics.

639
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:22,343
And he is someone, as an actor, who
from take to take is very free, very able,

640
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:28,165
very imaginative, and is really
quite a brilliant, young talent.

641
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:31,669
He got on very well
with both Chris Hemsworth directly

642
00:38:31,769 --> 00:38:35,715
and was part of a very, very happy,

643
00:38:35,815 --> 00:38:40,069
kind of, chemical combination of folk
in this group.

644
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,822
Jaimie Alexander as Sif,

645
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:46,017
an absolute comic geek,
she knows more about the comics

646
00:38:46,117 --> 00:38:48,811
than most of the people
involved with the project.

647
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:50,938
I think she's from a family
of many brothers,

648
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:54,025
and she has also that tomboyish qualify

649
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:58,070
that makes her unafraid
to be involved in the physical stuff.

650
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:02,717
So, she did a great job
of conveying the warrior princess,

651
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:07,555
but she also, as you can see,
is quite stunningly beautiful,

652
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:13,044
and brings to Sif's inner life,
as we go through the movie,

653
00:39:13,144 --> 00:39:15,379
really quite a complex qualify,

654
00:39:15,479 --> 00:39:18,341
particularly in relation to
what she feels about Thor.

655
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:21,444
It was a very fine,
very subtle piece of acting.

656
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:26,223
Here we see Tom Hiddleston as Loki

657
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:28,392
returning to the
Casket of Ancient Winters

658
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:31,854
to try and understand
what happened on Jotunheim

659
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:35,041
when his skin appeared to turn blue.

660
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:38,152
And, in a moment, there was
a very good suggestion of Craig Kyle,

661
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:41,697
one of our co-producers
who was intimately involved.

662
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:43,132
We reveal

663
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:50,139
that Loki is at least part Frost Giant.

664
00:39:53,684 --> 00:39:55,544
Once again in this scene,

665
00:39:55,644 --> 00:40:00,007
it felt as though the film was
trying to be ambitious,

666
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:03,344
to bring to this family dynamic

667
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:07,573
this, if you like, relatable,
universal issue,

668
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:10,726
not experienced by many
but understood by all,

669
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:15,690
of what happens when your life
appears to have been exposed

670
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,525
as having been a lie.

671
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:20,836
Loki is not, in fact, Odin's son.

672
00:40:24,173 --> 00:40:29,412
Although the act of saving him
may, in Odin's view,

673
00:40:29,512 --> 00:40:33,207
have been the beginnings
of loving and adoring

674
00:40:33,307 --> 00:40:35,768
and caring for him as his own son,

675
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,923
the reality to Loki of this lie,

676
00:40:41,023 --> 00:40:43,759
and the evidence that his father
is, in fact, Laufey,

677
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:48,906
is obviously
a cataclysmic discovery for him.

678
00:41:10,594 --> 00:41:15,166
In a scene like this, it seems to me
that, again, the stakes are so high,

679
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:17,752
the passions involved
are so extraordinary

680
00:41:17,852 --> 00:41:21,230
that the kind of acting moments
touched on by these two

681
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:24,967
are pleasing and unusual
in a film like this, I think.

682
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:27,194
They give it some ballast.

683
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:30,347
They are the kind of weight

684
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:36,145
against which the comedy,
the fun of so much of the rest of it sits,

685
00:41:36,245 --> 00:41:39,748
and is offset,
and it's a necessary balance.

686
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:42,735
When you put these two together
to do something like this,

687
00:41:42,835 --> 00:41:44,653
I think you are blessed.

688
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:49,633
Tony Hopkins, this was
his first day on set, his first scene.

689
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,328
And I decided that I would experiment

690
00:41:52,428 --> 00:41:55,081
with something I'd been
experimenting with as an actor myself,

691
00:41:55,181 --> 00:42:00,211
which was to start the day in a scene
like this by shooting the close-ups.

692
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:03,089
Normally, you'd start in a wide shot,
like the one we've just seen,

693
00:42:03,189 --> 00:42:06,092
and you'd move slowly in and you might
get to close-ups after lunch

694
00:42:06,192 --> 00:42:07,635
or in the middle of the afternoon.

695
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:11,347
At whatever time we got him on set,
maybe 9:30, 10:00 in the morning,

696
00:42:11,447 --> 00:42:13,285
Tony Hopkins was
doing the close-ups for this scene,

697
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:15,017
and I thought he did a magnificent job.

698
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:17,686
And he was incredibly generous
to young Tom,

699
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:20,272
who was incredibly patient
and did his close-ups

700
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:22,358
much later in the day
or even the next day.

701
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:26,962
It was an example of great camaraderie
and cooperation between two actors.

702
00:42:28,714 --> 00:42:34,370
The town of Puente Antiguo,
we built in New Mexico

703
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,871
just outside Santa Fe.

704
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:40,209
It's this wonderful western town
that was featured in movies

705
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:44,813
from as far back as <i>Silverado</i> and
as recently as Ed Harris' <i>Appaloosa</i>.

706
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:49,718
We took the basic shape
and we remodelled the frontages,

707
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:52,721
and instead of the dust track
down the middle, we tarmacked

708
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:57,017
and we created what I wanted to be,
with Bo Welch,

709
00:42:57,117 --> 00:43:00,479
a sort of heightened version
of a kind of Americana

710
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:03,357
that I had enjoyed seeing in the comics.

711
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:06,861
I wanted it
to sit in the vast sea of the desert,

712
00:43:06,961 --> 00:43:10,239
just like
Asgard sits in the vast sea of space.

713
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:14,118
And I wanted to be able to have the
colours of the seats, like the red here,

714
00:43:14,218 --> 00:43:19,790
have a sort of ambience that evoked
the world of Edward Hopper,

715
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:24,628
a kind of heightened,
very familiar, very intensely flavoured,

716
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:28,591
intensely coloured version
of small-town America

717
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:30,384
that comes out of the comics,

718
00:43:30,484 --> 00:43:33,012
and that is immensely fascinating
and attractive, I think,

719
00:43:33,112 --> 00:43:35,514
to anyone who is not from America
and I hope, obviously,

720
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:38,826
if you're from America,
it's equally interesting.

721
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:41,645
But it was to do with trying to have
Thor land

722
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:46,500
in a coherent environment, community,

723
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:49,612
where, when eventually it is threatened,

724
00:43:49,712 --> 00:43:51,926
we have some sense
that it deserves not to be threatened,

725
00:43:52,006 --> 00:43:53,115
it deserves to be saved.

726
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:56,118
And there are kind people there,
and people like you and me.

727
00:43:56,218 --> 00:43:57,703
And so, the building of this town,

728
00:43:57,803 --> 00:43:59,580
the creation of this town
inside the desert

729
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,498
with that kind of backdrop
right at the back

730
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:04,126
with the mountains
and the fun of a sign like,

731
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:08,464
"Welcome to the home of the Vikings"
on the water tower there,

732
00:44:08,564 --> 00:44:12,843
was a wonderful part
of creating an Earth part

733
00:44:12,943 --> 00:44:16,889
of a translation of the comics,
which I loved doing.

734
00:44:16,989 --> 00:44:18,474
From a movie point of view,

735
00:44:18,574 --> 00:44:20,537
building something
where we could have control over it,

736
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:22,519
we did lots of scouting
down in New Mexico,

737
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:25,147
there were lots of candidates
as real towns,

738
00:44:25,247 --> 00:44:29,777
and that issue of level of reality
was one we discussed much.

739
00:44:29,877 --> 00:44:33,864
But here, I knew that we would be
staging, later on, a big battle in it,

740
00:44:33,964 --> 00:44:35,783
and I just wanted to be
able to stop and start

741
00:44:35,883 --> 00:44:39,411
and have complete and utter control
over what we were doing

742
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:42,539
and the camera style,
and not be stopping traffic

743
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:44,875
and not be dealing with everything
that's to do

744
00:44:44,975 --> 00:44:47,227
with closing down a real town.

745
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:52,508
Also, I wanted to have the time to,
again, have some of the fun of,

746
00:44:52,608 --> 00:44:56,720
at the beginning of this scene,
Thor walking down the street ignoring,

747
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:59,640
either walking
on the left- or right-hand side,

748
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,016
walking like a god walks.

749
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:03,477
I mean,
people should get out of his way.

750
00:45:03,577 --> 00:45:06,939
The other part of his god-like qualify
was this sort of gallantry,

751
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:10,484
the idea of kissing hands
and generally being a sort of knight

752
00:45:10,584 --> 00:45:13,962
gallant to someone like Jane Foster.

753
00:45:14,254 --> 00:45:17,199
And here you see that
in the very brief time

754
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:18,867
in which you may be able to establish

755
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:21,370
some kind of romantic feeling
between them,

756
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:27,918
she is absolutely thrown for a loop
by his old-fashioned gentlemanliness

757
00:45:28,018 --> 00:45:33,482
wrapped up in this kind of gargantuan,
massive, sort of, caveman body.

758
00:45:34,274 --> 00:45:37,653
One can see that
he makes an impression, and swiftly.

759
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:43,767
However, we also know
that life won't be made easy

760
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:47,146
and into the movie,
as hinted at earlier on

761
00:45:47,246 --> 00:45:50,733
when Clark Gregg showed up
at the crater site,

762
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:53,152
there's now a much stronger presence

763
00:45:53,252 --> 00:45:56,905
of the mysterious government agency,
S.H.I.E.L.D.,

764
00:45:57,005 --> 00:46:02,244
in the form of Mr. Clark Gregg,
who you'll know from <i>Iron Man</i>

765
00:46:02,344 --> 00:46:06,515
and who I was really thrilled
to be working with in this.

766
00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:09,418
He has a great sensitivity
for the character,

767
00:46:09,518 --> 00:46:14,256
a great deadpan qualify, very dry
and funny man in his own right.

768
00:46:14,356 --> 00:46:16,884
But he does the difficult thing
in a part like this,

769
00:46:16,984 --> 00:46:19,470
especially one that's now
become a very successful part,

770
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:22,698
of continuing to keep it honest,
play it straight,

771
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:27,227
and he brings that side of the story,

772
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:30,956
this concern on the part of S.H.I.E.L.D.
and Nick Fury

773
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:33,776
and those who work with him,

774
00:46:33,876 --> 00:46:37,154
at the potential danger,
the potential knowledge to be learnt

775
00:46:37,254 --> 00:46:40,240
from what's happening out here
in the New Mexican desert,

776
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,368
and from what's happening

777
00:46:42,468 --> 00:46:46,555
in Jane Foster's brilliant, maverick,
scientific journey.

778
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:52,336
The shots that follow,
I love having been in New Mexico.

779
00:46:52,436 --> 00:46:56,799
It gets away from the synthetic and there
we are, the real set, the real desert.

780
00:46:56,899 --> 00:47:00,511
And for me, tilted angles,
Dutched angles as we call them,

781
00:47:00,611 --> 00:47:04,264
because that's the way
I remember comic book frames.

782
00:47:04,364 --> 00:47:05,828
It was something controversial
at the time,

783
00:47:05,908 --> 00:47:08,330
I remember there was some concern
about whether I was overdoing it.

784
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:10,145
I hope you don't feel I did.

785
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:14,400
They were there because
that's how I received the dynamism

786
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,069
of the composition in the frames.

787
00:47:17,169 --> 00:47:20,197
Wide-angle lenses with lots of depth

788
00:47:20,297 --> 00:47:23,258
and it's why I chose it as a style for this.

789
00:47:25,928 --> 00:47:30,624
And while we're talking about depth and
here, live in the New Mexican desert

790
00:47:30,724 --> 00:47:32,668
on the top of Smith's Motors,

791
00:47:32,768 --> 00:47:35,879
this spaceship,
'50s retro designed look

792
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:40,676
that tries to evoke a little outer space
even on Earth,

793
00:47:40,776 --> 00:47:43,429
let's talk a little bit about 3-D.

794
00:47:43,529 --> 00:47:45,806
3-D was a discussion
early on in the process.

795
00:47:45,906 --> 00:47:49,351
I didn't want to shoot in 3-D. I needed
more time to work with the actors.

796
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:54,915
I wasn't confident about how swiftly
I could work with the two 3-D cameras.

797
00:47:55,874 --> 00:48:01,071
And so, I investigated, instead,
what would happen if we converted,

798
00:48:01,171 --> 00:48:03,782
and as we, indeed, did render,

799
00:48:03,882 --> 00:48:09,304
the vast majority of our 1,309
visual effects shots in post-production.

800
00:48:20,649 --> 00:48:23,552
I was very, very happy with the results.

801
00:48:23,652 --> 00:48:25,262
I had the initial discussion saying,

802
00:48:25,362 --> 00:48:29,224
"Look, if this is just an attempt
to make some more money,"

803
00:48:29,324 --> 00:48:30,893
"people will see through it."

804
00:48:30,993 --> 00:48:33,312
"I need to go through a journey
where I can understand"

805
00:48:33,412 --> 00:48:35,397
"how much more value
it can add for me."

806
00:48:35,497 --> 00:48:38,108
So I did, and when we prepared
our five-minute piece

807
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:41,069
for the great convention
of Comic-Con in San Diego,

808
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:48,035
we worked out how 3-D could enhance
a more and differently immersive

809
00:48:48,135 --> 00:48:51,622
version of the film
for sequences like this,

810
00:48:51,722 --> 00:48:56,184
where you have an iconic image of
Tom Hiddleston as Loki on the throne.

811
00:48:56,518 --> 00:49:00,923
And where here, you can have
a sense of the grandeur, vastness,

812
00:49:01,023 --> 00:49:04,801
and layer out the depth
between the Warriors Four

813
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:07,429
and him between them
and the background

814
00:49:07,529 --> 00:49:09,932
in a way that, I think, often subtly

815
00:49:10,032 --> 00:49:13,310
and sometimes more directly
puts you in the picture,

816
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:16,438
gives you a stronger, more immersive
sense of being in Asgard.

817
00:49:16,538 --> 00:49:19,107
We worked particularly
on the depth script,

818
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:22,653
that is to say through being able
to have control shot to shot

819
00:49:22,753 --> 00:49:27,591
on how the compression or release
of the space inside the frame worked,

820
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:31,703
we could avoid, we hoped,
that headache-inducing,

821
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:34,957
eye-hurting kind of qualify
that is sometimes the product

822
00:49:35,057 --> 00:49:40,337
of either rushed 3-D,
or 3-D where shot for shot, when shot,

823
00:49:40,437 --> 00:49:42,172
has depth judged perfectly,

824
00:49:42,272 --> 00:49:44,174
but when put together
can be problematic.

825
00:49:44,274 --> 00:49:48,053
We wanted a smooth
and subtly enhancing,

826
00:49:48,153 --> 00:49:52,224
but not wildly disturbing version of 3-D.

827
00:49:52,324 --> 00:49:56,144
I was delighted with the results
in both the spectacular scenes,

828
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:58,647
but also in some of the subtler scenes

829
00:49:58,747 --> 00:50:01,650
where just a different sense
of being there

830
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:05,320
and a different relationship
to some of the characters, the textures

831
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,573
and the compositional elements
was something

832
00:50:07,673 --> 00:50:09,575
that I was very happy to experiment with.

833
00:50:09,675 --> 00:50:12,327
It took a long time,
but I was pleased and proud

834
00:50:12,427 --> 00:50:14,997
with the company
we worked with, Stereo D,

835
00:50:15,097 --> 00:50:17,140
they did a fantastic job.

836
00:50:17,724 --> 00:50:19,918
There's the Rainbow Bridge for you,
and Odin on it.

837
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:21,587
That shows you how far we came.

838
00:50:21,687 --> 00:50:25,007
And then something that I wanted
to have in the movie from day one,

839
00:50:25,107 --> 00:50:28,927
which is just the simple explanation
that "Thursday" comes from "Thor."

840
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:31,346
It is "Thor's day."

841
00:50:31,446 --> 00:50:34,182
As, indeed,
"Friday" comes from "Frigga"

842
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:36,727
and the two other days
from the western character

843
00:50:36,827 --> 00:50:39,746
that are also influenced
by the Norse myths.

844
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:46,111
I wish I could tell you
I'd given Chris Hemsworth

845
00:50:46,211 --> 00:50:49,364
a great reading of that line
"I want a horse,"

846
00:50:49,464 --> 00:50:51,700
which makes me laugh
almost every time.

847
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,327
I didn't, he did.

848
00:50:53,427 --> 00:50:57,080
He came at the part
with such a natural sense of humour

849
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:02,252
that it was great to see him get value
out of that fish-out-of-water moment,

850
00:51:02,352 --> 00:51:05,439
and a very good reaction
from the pet shop keeper.

851
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:10,594
This is an area
where 3-D, I like very much

852
00:51:10,694 --> 00:51:15,390
in terms of how it makes me
feel the vastness of the desert.

853
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:16,912
And if you're not watching in 3-D,
of course,

854
00:51:16,992 --> 00:51:19,353
it's a very nice series of shots.

855
00:51:19,453 --> 00:51:21,204
But it was one

856
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:26,902
where it was about
giving an in-depth experience

857
00:51:27,002 --> 00:51:31,256
that wasn't necessarily to do with
hammers throwing themselves at you.

858
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,700
This is an experience, by the by,

859
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,204
where Natalie Portman, who had
just been working on <i>Black Swan,</i>

860
00:51:37,304 --> 00:51:40,749
was talking about the moments
when people said to her,

861
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:44,252
"Are you frustrated
you get to work on an independent film"

862
00:51:44,352 --> 00:51:47,381
"and you have all that marvellous
creative satisfaction,"

863
00:51:47,481 --> 00:51:50,676
"and then you do something like <i>Thor</i>
and it's all a big sort of machine?"

864
00:51:50,776 --> 00:51:53,762
She said, on this one, for this scene,
we had all day to do this scene.

865
00:51:53,862 --> 00:51:55,450
We spent all day
driving around the desert,

866
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,474
many, many takes
to try and get this right.

867
00:51:57,574 --> 00:52:00,602
She said on an independent film,
you never have any time.

868
00:52:00,702 --> 00:52:04,690
You've got to do four scenes
in a morning and move on,

869
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:08,735
and you're often left frustrated because
you didn't get a chance to practise.

870
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:12,489
So, for Natalie, the kind of time
that we were able to take

871
00:52:12,589 --> 00:52:15,742
just for a scene like that, to try
and get it right with lightness of touch

872
00:52:15,842 --> 00:52:20,889
but depth at the same time,
was a real enjoyment in the process.

873
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,255
The talented and beautiful Rene Russo
plays Frigga,

874
00:52:28,355 --> 00:52:31,842
and she and Odin had
some more scenes in the film

875
00:52:31,942 --> 00:52:34,720
that in the end
didn't make it into the final cut

876
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:36,638
simply because
we just didn't have the room

877
00:52:36,738 --> 00:52:38,243
to do everything else
the story was doing,

878
00:52:38,323 --> 00:52:40,350
but I admire her so much.

879
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:44,980
She was such a beautiful actress
inside and out

880
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:49,735
and gave a wonderful, wonderful
sense of depth

881
00:52:49,835 --> 00:52:52,571
in this warrior queen.

882
00:52:52,671 --> 00:52:54,489
She was a pleasure to work with.

883
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:57,242
God, she's a great-looking gal,

884
00:52:57,342 --> 00:52:59,453
and she got on very well
with these two kids.

885
00:52:59,553 --> 00:53:02,873
This idea for the restorative
Odinsleep effect

886
00:53:02,973 --> 00:53:05,834
was a very good one
from Ms. Victoria Alonso,

887
00:53:05,934 --> 00:53:11,273
and I think it tells the story
of Odin's need to regenerate.

888
00:53:25,287 --> 00:53:29,107
Now, we do one of these switches
from Asgard to Earth.

889
00:53:29,207 --> 00:53:31,735
That was one
of the real challenges, story-wise,

890
00:53:31,835 --> 00:53:33,320
about how we could make it work,

891
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,866
and throughout draft after draft,
this rhythm, finding this rhythm,

892
00:53:37,966 --> 00:53:40,869
and in post-production
was really crucial.

893
00:53:40,969 --> 00:53:43,538
Kevin Feige, our producer,
always had very good instincts

894
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:50,228
about when we could or shouldn't
go to Earth or Asgard, back and forth.

895
00:53:50,854 --> 00:53:53,006
What were the ways
to exploit that rhythm

896
00:53:53,106 --> 00:53:54,236
and not confuse the audience?

897
00:53:54,316 --> 00:53:57,511
We knew, probably, there would be
people who preferred being on Earth,

898
00:53:57,611 --> 00:53:59,971
there would be some people
who preferred being in Asgard.

899
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:04,326
We wanted both because we felt
as though the story had to interweave.

900
00:54:10,665 --> 00:54:14,528
It was an exciting sequence like this
that allowed us a sense of

901
00:54:14,628 --> 00:54:16,446
how, with music, we could come back

902
00:54:16,546 --> 00:54:21,801
and really make a great advantage
of this, as she says, "city"

903
00:54:22,385 --> 00:54:23,745
thrown up by S.H.I.E.L.D.

904
00:54:23,845 --> 00:54:27,582
with all of this paraphernalia
to analyse this hammer.

905
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:31,211
It's worth talking, perhaps,
a little bit about this set,

906
00:54:31,311 --> 00:54:33,839
which was put together by Bo Welch,

907
00:54:33,939 --> 00:54:37,050
and I thought was a sort of
brilliant graphic response,

908
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:40,846
a sort of comic
visual language response

909
00:54:40,946 --> 00:54:47,394
in all of these tubes
and cubes to the marriage between,

910
00:54:47,494 --> 00:54:52,274
again, the fantastical up on Asgard
and in space,

911
00:54:52,374 --> 00:54:56,653
and down here, earthbound,
but still excitingly graphic and dynamic.

912
00:54:56,753 --> 00:55:00,382
Lots of shapes, lots of texture.

913
00:55:02,926 --> 00:55:07,455
I think that both the way he designed it
and the starkness

914
00:55:07,555 --> 00:55:12,102
with which Haris Zambarloukos
could light it was very exciting.

915
00:55:12,644 --> 00:55:16,548
It felt like a really different
kind of texture, it felt surprising,

916
00:55:16,648 --> 00:55:20,135
a different kind of dynamic
to this part of the movie.

917
00:55:20,235 --> 00:55:22,596
It's also worth talking about music.

918
00:55:22,696 --> 00:55:26,057
The composer of the score for the film
was Patrick Doyle.

919
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:31,021
Patrick, I've worked with
since his first film and mine, <i>Henry V</i>

920
00:55:31,121 --> 00:55:33,565
He was a student of composition
and piano

921
00:55:33,665 --> 00:55:35,483
at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music.

922
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:40,405
He then worked as an actor. He has
a very wide-ranging experience of story,

923
00:55:40,505 --> 00:55:44,926
and his gifts as a composer
are a wonderful ear for melody,

924
00:55:45,677 --> 00:55:48,121
but a great sense of the dramatic.

925
00:55:48,221 --> 00:55:50,707
He always gets involved very early on,

926
00:55:50,807 --> 00:55:55,754
and we knew that he needed to have

927
00:55:55,854 --> 00:55:58,006
the kind of drive in the music

928
00:55:58,106 --> 00:56:03,553
that would keep the sort of ticking clock
of Thor's time on Earth

929
00:56:03,653 --> 00:56:09,242
really vibrantly motoring through,
for instance, a sequence like this.

930
00:56:09,701 --> 00:56:13,104
Patrick is particularly good
at being able to craft,

931
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:17,275
once he sees a sequence like this,
the ups and the downs of the music,

932
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:23,965
leaves space for the sound effects,
leaves space for the visual effects,

933
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:27,994
be able to give and paint in
a musical introduction

934
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:32,307
to as important a character
as we're about to see, this man.

935
00:56:33,308 --> 00:56:37,379
And so, his sculpting of the score
is really exemplary,

936
00:56:37,479 --> 00:56:42,717
and his ability to write a great tune
is, I think, unmatched.

937
00:56:42,817 --> 00:56:44,427
He's had a fantastic

938
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:46,687
and continues to have a fantastic career
as a composer,

939
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:49,741
and he made an enormous
contribution to this.

940
00:56:51,659 --> 00:56:55,021
This is Barton, Hawkeye,

941
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:59,734
a character familiar
to readers of the comics beyond <i>Thor</i>.

942
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:02,362
They'll know
that he is one of the Avengers,

943
00:57:02,462 --> 00:57:05,240
and an extra pleasure
in being in the Marvel Universe

944
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:08,034
was to get a chance on this picture
to work with this young man,

945
00:57:08,134 --> 00:57:09,160
Jeremy Renner,

946
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:14,516
who came in much further down the line
to shoot his part of this sequence,

947
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:17,752
but was a joy to watch and to work with.

948
00:57:17,852 --> 00:57:22,424
And to see someone
latch onto a character immediately,

949
00:57:22,524 --> 00:57:26,344
and to do so in the style
and with the talent of the best

950
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:30,657
by a beautiful choice
of relative minimalism

951
00:57:31,825 --> 00:57:34,936
in the look and speech of the character.

952
00:57:35,036 --> 00:57:39,441
And it was very, very nice
to have that kind of a talent

953
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:43,586
come into a movie like this in,
in this case, a small part.

954
00:57:44,087 --> 00:57:48,658
All of this work in the mud
was done very late in the night,

955
00:57:48,758 --> 00:57:52,412
maybe 4:00 in the morning, during
a couple of weeks of night shoots,

956
00:57:52,512 --> 00:57:54,639
which are always a challenge
on a movie.

957
00:57:55,056 --> 00:57:57,292
Mr. Hemsworth, uncomplaining,

958
00:57:57,392 --> 00:58:00,228
as were the rest
of the brilliant stunt team.

959
00:58:00,728 --> 00:58:03,882
All the boys who are used to this,
who nevertheless have to

960
00:58:03,982 --> 00:58:07,635
sometimes put up with
fairly trying conditions, were great.

961
00:58:07,735 --> 00:58:11,139
The, sort of, mud fight
helped us understand

962
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:15,477
this primal qualify to both Thor
and to this point in the story,

963
00:58:15,577 --> 00:58:16,831
because now he's going home, isn't he?

964
00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:19,355
He's gonna get his hammer,
and he's gonna go home

965
00:58:19,455 --> 00:58:24,319
and that arrogant Thor
is gonna prove that might is right.

966
00:58:24,419 --> 00:58:28,506
If you could only smash your way out
of a hospital or out of a van

967
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:33,428
or recruit people like Jane Foster
to help you, you'll get it.

968
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:41,144
And here in the music, we try and set up
this sense of impending triumph,

969
00:58:41,436 --> 00:58:44,839
the great strongman of the universe
will claim his right,

970
00:58:44,939 --> 00:58:47,217
Excalibur will be lifted from the stone,

971
00:58:47,317 --> 00:58:52,430
Thor will be returned to his full powers
and will be able to go home.

972
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:55,033
Except, of course, that he can't.

973
00:58:55,325 --> 00:58:59,120
"Only he who is worthy,"
that's what Odin said.

974
00:58:59,704 --> 00:59:04,876
And we have not seen sufficient
evidence in this story of the flawed hero

975
00:59:05,627 --> 00:59:11,174
who must lose in order to find.

976
00:59:11,883 --> 00:59:13,221
We haven't seen the evidence there.

977
00:59:13,301 --> 00:59:15,537
This is not something
he's gonna take easily, however,

978
00:59:15,637 --> 00:59:19,307
and once again, that primal part
of the character kicks in.

979
00:59:20,225 --> 00:59:22,710
Like a great bear yelling

980
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:28,983
or like a crazed child
hysterically screaming,

981
00:59:29,692 --> 00:59:32,220
some part of him is broken

982
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:36,057
by the certain knowledge
that he ain't going back,

983
00:59:36,157 --> 00:59:37,951
that's it, it's over.

984
00:59:38,576 --> 00:59:43,331
No home, no friends, no family,
no powers.

985
00:59:44,165 --> 00:59:46,901
This becomes, for Thor,
a pivotal moment

986
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:49,195
in his journey through the picture.

987
00:59:49,295 --> 00:59:51,865
And one of the things I love
about Chris Hemsworth's performance

988
00:59:51,965 --> 00:59:54,008
is just the look coming up.

989
00:59:56,344 --> 00:59:58,580
The sense,
as he sees the symbol of home,

990
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,916
of that hurt
and of that youthfulness in his look,

991
01:00:02,016 --> 01:00:03,585
that great oak tree of a man

992
01:00:03,685 --> 01:00:09,399
is now almost a, sort of,
bottom-lip-quivering kid.

993
01:00:10,817 --> 01:00:15,096
He's had to really understand
that he's not going home.

994
01:00:15,196 --> 01:00:16,681
It's very touching, I think,

995
01:00:16,781 --> 01:00:20,768
and I asked Pat
to reflect that in the music.

996
01:00:20,868 --> 01:00:23,438
It's the moment in which,
perhaps they may have admired,

997
01:00:23,538 --> 01:00:26,316
they may have been amused by him,
they may have a sneaking admiration

998
01:00:26,416 --> 01:00:29,986
for his cheeky, grinning,
winking cockiness,

999
01:00:30,086 --> 01:00:33,448
but now, perhaps the audience have
genuine sympathy for this man,

1000
01:00:33,548 --> 01:00:35,408
because now he's down on our level.

1001
01:00:35,508 --> 01:00:38,536
He loses stuff,
he doesn't get his way all the time,

1002
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:43,933
and maybe it's the point at which
the audience fully sympathise with him.

1003
01:00:49,897 --> 01:00:51,653
I like this scene very much
for a number of reasons.

1004
01:00:51,733 --> 01:00:56,012
The 3-D or just the composition
generally in this lab, I love,

1005
01:00:56,112 --> 01:00:58,076
because they were at the back
of the lab in the wide shot,

1006
01:00:58,156 --> 01:01:00,308
and you have all those
layers of structure.

1007
01:01:00,408 --> 01:01:03,478
You have the real genuine outside
of a real town at night

1008
01:01:03,578 --> 01:01:06,356
through the glass, seeing all the neon.

1009
01:01:06,456 --> 01:01:08,149
You have this passionate debate,

1010
01:01:08,249 --> 01:01:11,069
which, in a way,
states the kind of parameters

1011
01:01:11,169 --> 01:01:14,322
of the issue of reality in our film.

1012
01:01:14,422 --> 01:01:18,117
She quotes Arthur C. Clarke, "Magic's
just science we don't understand yet."

1013
01:01:18,217 --> 01:01:22,664
"It was science fiction," says he.
"Which is a precursor to science fact."

1014
01:01:22,764 --> 01:01:26,334
And I think that if you just look at
what's happened in our own lives

1015
01:01:26,434 --> 01:01:29,003
on what may seem
a rather superficial level,

1016
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:34,008
but 15, 16 years ago,
we didn't have the Internet,

1017
01:01:34,108 --> 01:01:39,514
and everything working as it does today,
with all our handheld devices,

1018
01:01:39,614 --> 01:01:41,266
the whole revolution of the social media.

1019
01:01:41,366 --> 01:01:44,269
Imagine the massive shake-up
in our own lives that's gone on,

1020
01:01:44,369 --> 01:01:49,190
so that the degree
to which Jane Foster can argue

1021
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:54,862
that just because we don't understand
or have complete experience

1022
01:01:54,962 --> 01:02:00,118
of a blond god from another world
coming to live amongst us,

1023
01:02:00,218 --> 01:02:03,746
it doesn't mean
that miraculous things can't happen.

1024
01:02:03,846 --> 01:02:06,916
And if you'd told Christopher
Columbus that a small piece of plastic

1025
01:02:07,016 --> 01:02:11,229
would connect you
to back home, to Genoa,

1026
01:02:11,646 --> 01:02:14,607
when he landed in 1492

1027
01:02:15,149 --> 01:02:17,218
to tell them
that he'd just discovered America,

1028
01:02:17,318 --> 01:02:18,740
he would have
perhaps laughed in your face.

1029
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:20,366
A few hundred years later,
it's all normal.

1030
01:02:20,446 --> 01:02:25,810
Anyway, the basic notion of accepting
the suspension of disbelief

1031
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:29,897
for some of the miraculous qualities
in the picture

1032
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:32,900
that search for
a certain kind of credibility

1033
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,321
were caught
by Natalie Portman's passion there

1034
01:02:36,421 --> 01:02:40,842
and by, I think, some well-written work
from our team of writers.

1035
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:46,080
When we talk about the sort of
emotional core of the film,

1036
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:48,708
which exists in a picture

1037
01:02:48,808 --> 01:02:52,170
that essentially has always
drawn the reaction

1038
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:54,609
when we screened it early on,
and we always wanted to have it

1039
01:02:54,689 --> 01:02:58,217
draw the reaction of being fun,
it's a fun experience,

1040
01:02:58,317 --> 01:03:03,448
it's a summer movie, it's something
to enjoy in a beautiful way.

1041
01:03:05,324 --> 01:03:06,746
But nevertheless, at the centre of it,

1042
01:03:06,826 --> 01:03:09,771
you hope there are these other things,
including here,

1043
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:14,125
I think beautifully played between
Tom Hiddleston and Chris Hemsworth,

1044
01:03:14,959 --> 01:03:17,945
this moment where Thor believes

1045
01:03:18,045 --> 01:03:21,949
not only has he lost his home
and is forbidden from returning to it,

1046
01:03:22,049 --> 01:03:24,677
but that he has lost his father.

1047
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:27,622
The reaction to this news

1048
01:03:27,722 --> 01:03:33,127
and the way in which he articulates
quite tenderly, quite vulnerably

1049
01:03:33,227 --> 01:03:35,797
his response, I think, is beautifully done.

1050
01:03:35,897 --> 01:03:41,219
The act, if you like, of Loki is
wonderfully, seamlessly done by Tom,

1051
01:03:41,319 --> 01:03:44,430
who evoked by way of a sort of model
for the character,

1052
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:47,433
the character of lago
in Shakespeare's play <i>Othello,</i>

1053
01:03:47,533 --> 01:03:51,312
who is, if you like,
the great actor in Shakespeare,

1054
01:03:51,412 --> 01:03:54,816
a terrifying character
who is a sort of sociopath,

1055
01:03:54,916 --> 01:03:58,361
who will disguise every real feeling

1056
01:03:58,461 --> 01:04:02,490
under the mask of something authentic
and genuine-seeming.

1057
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:04,659
Well, here, this dynamic
between two brothers

1058
01:04:04,759 --> 01:04:08,788
who really, I think, do love each other,
but have this complicated relationship,

1059
01:04:08,888 --> 01:04:13,835
as Loki's burgeoning knowledge
of who or what he might be

1060
01:04:13,935 --> 01:04:16,354
and therefore who or what,

1061
01:04:17,021 --> 01:04:20,007
especially what might be
available to him,

1062
01:04:20,107 --> 01:04:23,928
is occurring inside him,
questions being asked,

1063
01:04:24,028 --> 01:04:27,515
and they play this very delicate scene
so well.

1064
01:04:27,615 --> 01:04:29,225
I was most impressed by them,

1065
01:04:29,325 --> 01:04:31,602
and I like the fact
that it's in this neutral arena,

1066
01:04:31,702 --> 01:04:33,646
this quieter, simpler place,

1067
01:04:33,746 --> 01:04:38,234
another series of contrasts
to the sometimes very busy

1068
01:04:38,334 --> 01:04:41,737
and spectacular world of colour
and complexity,

1069
01:04:41,837 --> 01:04:44,907
in terms of the layout of shots,

1070
01:04:45,007 --> 01:04:47,201
to something very simple and focused.

1071
01:04:47,301 --> 01:04:50,079
Loki, of course, can't resist
the idea of picking up that hammer.

1072
01:04:50,179 --> 01:04:53,708
This was, again, a great touch
from Kevin and Craig and co.

1073
01:04:53,808 --> 01:04:58,629
To suggest that he could be irritated

1074
01:04:58,729 --> 01:05:01,148
by that extra-nice Loki moment.

1075
01:05:02,316 --> 01:05:05,636
The writers involved in our film
have done a wonderful job,

1076
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:10,892
from the story's shaping
that Joe Michael Straczynski

1077
01:05:10,992 --> 01:05:15,229
and Mark Protosevich did
across various drafts of the screenplay

1078
01:05:15,329 --> 01:05:17,940
that were there just before I arrived,

1079
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:22,069
that gave this kind of hero's journey arc,
the exile and the return,

1080
01:05:22,169 --> 01:05:28,759
that I certainly was very excited to try
and further develop and enhance.

1081
01:05:29,093 --> 01:05:31,287
And then with Ashley Miller
and Zack Stentz,

1082
01:05:31,387 --> 01:05:34,373
who came in
and then worked with me initially

1083
01:05:34,473 --> 01:05:40,630
on how we bring that
contemporary Earth element to the story

1084
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:44,800
and allow
consistency of tone across that,

1085
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:47,929
and there were many excellent drafts
that came out of that process.

1086
01:05:48,029 --> 01:05:51,224
And then,
with my great friend Don Payne,

1087
01:05:51,324 --> 01:05:53,434
a brilliant writer from <i>The Simpsons,</i>
of course,

1088
01:05:53,534 --> 01:05:54,936
we took this yet further

1089
01:05:55,036 --> 01:05:59,148
and really looked into the fun to be had
from a character like Erik Selvig,

1090
01:05:59,248 --> 01:06:05,446
and Erik Selvig and Darcy
very much developed by Don

1091
01:06:05,546 --> 01:06:09,158
with his particular sense of fun,
and in collaboration with them.

1092
01:06:09,258 --> 01:06:11,827
So, Stellan, for instance,
came to rehearsals early on

1093
01:06:11,927 --> 01:06:15,456
and was key in trying to make sure

1094
01:06:15,556 --> 01:06:20,378
that there was nothing sort of merely
functionary about these characters,

1095
01:06:20,478 --> 01:06:22,817
but that they have, as you can see
in the look in his eye there,

1096
01:06:22,897 --> 01:06:24,549
he just carries that sense of worry.

1097
01:06:24,649 --> 01:06:27,426
This is a man who knows he's dealing
with a government organisation

1098
01:06:27,526 --> 01:06:28,886
who can put him in jail.

1099
01:06:28,986 --> 01:06:35,076
And when he reacts here to
Clark Gregg's last farewell instruction,

1100
01:06:35,618 --> 01:06:37,745
you feel the depth of his relief.

1101
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:43,234
That contribution with Stellan,
talking in that case to Don,

1102
01:06:43,334 --> 01:06:44,944
and coming up in this particular scene

1103
01:06:45,044 --> 01:06:49,949
with some ideas about
how Selvig helps us to understand

1104
01:06:50,049 --> 01:06:52,994
via Chris' very excellent performance,

1105
01:06:53,094 --> 01:06:55,288
once again showing
yet another colour in Thor.

1106
01:06:55,388 --> 01:06:58,541
Very surprising
what we see of Thor in this scene

1107
01:06:58,641 --> 01:07:01,085
from the man we saw
in the very first scene,

1108
01:07:01,185 --> 01:07:06,257
and it's partly brought out by Stellan's
character asking him some questions

1109
01:07:06,357 --> 01:07:09,844
about who he is
and what he finds meaningful.

1110
01:07:09,944 --> 01:07:14,599
And this very, sort of, bonding scene
between the pair of them,

1111
01:07:14,699 --> 01:07:15,933
I think, is very honest.

1112
01:07:16,033 --> 01:07:19,061
It's very open, it's a scene that
we understood early on in screenings

1113
01:07:19,161 --> 01:07:22,064
was one where the audience
actually did enjoy

1114
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:26,027
seeing Thor just like us
and trying to put his life back together.

1115
01:07:26,127 --> 01:07:28,529
We know that the movie
isn't going to end there,

1116
01:07:28,629 --> 01:07:30,698
but we also know
it's not gonna be easy for him,

1117
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:32,867
whether it's getting back to home

1118
01:07:32,967 --> 01:07:36,871
or whether it's getting to
find a home on Earth,

1119
01:07:36,971 --> 01:07:38,789
especially as we see in this scene

1120
01:07:38,889 --> 01:07:44,478
that Selvig is naturally suspicious
and protective of his,

1121
01:07:45,479 --> 01:07:48,716
as it were, surrogate daughter in Jane.

1122
01:07:48,816 --> 01:07:53,054
These two were so enjoyable
to work with in this scene,

1123
01:07:53,154 --> 01:07:57,099
and Stellan comes in so prepared,
so available, so ready, so different,

1124
01:07:57,199 --> 01:07:59,226
so "ready to play," as he might put it,

1125
01:07:59,326 --> 01:08:05,416
that they really were
such marvellous collaborators.

1126
01:08:06,834 --> 01:08:08,798
They did, however, provide us
with a problem in this scene,

1127
01:08:08,878 --> 01:08:14,742
where we also had a fight and
a series of drinking contest moments

1128
01:08:14,842 --> 01:08:16,138
at the end of how we finished it.

1129
01:08:16,218 --> 01:08:19,413
We wanted to finish
simply on a kind of upbeat moment,

1130
01:08:19,513 --> 01:08:21,123
and of all the scenes in the movie,

1131
01:08:21,223 --> 01:08:24,335
the end of this was re-edited
maybe 150 times,

1132
01:08:24,435 --> 01:08:26,023
and it took a long time
before we went for

1133
01:08:26,103 --> 01:08:29,048
what is usually the preferred option,
which is the simple one,

1134
01:08:29,148 --> 01:08:31,592
especially in the hands
of two very good actors,

1135
01:08:31,692 --> 01:08:38,032
of a real and, in this case, pretty funny
look from Stellan Skarsgård.

1136
01:08:40,284 --> 01:08:43,370
We know he's gonna get into trouble
with that.

1137
01:08:51,128 --> 01:08:57,384
The visual effects here give us,
once again, Loki's return to Jotunheim,

1138
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:02,456
and the chance for Loki to face,

1139
01:09:02,556 --> 01:09:05,267
but not reveal to his father,

1140
01:09:06,435 --> 01:09:08,796
exactly who he is.

1141
01:09:08,896 --> 01:09:12,717
We did some additional photography
in this scene

1142
01:09:12,817 --> 01:09:17,304
and it was to exploit
one of the qualities in Loki

1143
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:19,932
that we felt we could,

1144
01:09:20,032 --> 01:09:22,852
by virtue of how good
Tom Hiddleston's performance was,

1145
01:09:22,952 --> 01:09:25,980
also include, aside from him
being a genuine brother,

1146
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:29,650
and being a hurt brother

1147
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:32,920
and an ambitious
and perhaps rather jealous brother,

1148
01:09:33,754 --> 01:09:37,283
to be mischievous and dangerous
is a necessity for Loki.

1149
01:09:37,383 --> 01:09:42,621
Even if one does not necessarily
suggest that he is preternaturally evil,

1150
01:09:42,721 --> 01:09:47,251
but that his capacity for wrongdoing
is emerging, forming,

1151
01:09:47,351 --> 01:09:49,336
shaping itself before our very eyes.

1152
01:09:49,436 --> 01:09:53,174
This scene allows us
to see a more calculating Loki at work.

1153
01:09:53,274 --> 01:09:55,134
Someone who is playing the poker game

1154
01:09:55,234 --> 01:09:58,053
with another master player,
his real father,

1155
01:09:58,153 --> 01:10:02,224
but his real father does not,
at this point, know that this is his son.

1156
01:10:02,324 --> 01:10:05,311
He was abandoned, after all,
and he would have assumed,

1157
01:10:05,411 --> 01:10:08,063
and another version of this scene
suggested this,

1158
01:10:08,163 --> 01:10:12,459
that Odin would have killed
that bastard child of yesteryear.

1159
01:10:12,877 --> 01:10:15,362
So, this becomes a scene
of many levels

1160
01:10:15,462 --> 01:10:18,699
between two very calculating,
dangerous guys

1161
01:10:18,799 --> 01:10:20,951
who are used
to the world of brinkmanship,

1162
01:10:21,051 --> 01:10:23,137
and two good poker faces.

1163
01:10:25,055 --> 01:10:28,417
We return to Heimdall's observatory

1164
01:10:28,517 --> 01:10:32,213
where again, you, in this scene,
get to enjoy

1165
01:10:32,313 --> 01:10:34,715
the power of Idris Elba's performance.

1166
01:10:34,815 --> 01:10:36,111
First of all, the look is fantastic.

1167
01:10:36,191 --> 01:10:40,471
I can't imagine another actor who would
carry off this incredible costume,

1168
01:10:40,571 --> 01:10:44,058
which Alex Byrne, I think,
has triumphantly presented

1169
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:47,102
as the kind of look that a guardian,

1170
01:10:47,202 --> 01:10:49,939
a man who really is the person
who says,

1171
01:10:50,039 --> 01:10:53,000
and we believe him,
"Thou shalt not pass."

1172
01:10:53,792 --> 01:10:58,489
In wonderful, wonderful golds
and with a great shape, great design,

1173
01:10:58,589 --> 01:11:00,699
it's a marvellous frame for an actor.

1174
01:11:00,799 --> 01:11:05,079
And in it, you have Idris Elba,
whose voice we slightly amend

1175
01:11:05,179 --> 01:11:11,352
to just maximise the beautiful, rich,
dark, warm tones in it,

1176
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:16,006
because, as the single
representative of Asgard out there,

1177
01:11:16,106 --> 01:11:18,926
we wanted, every time we heard
and saw him,

1178
01:11:19,026 --> 01:11:23,013
to be aware of this
memory of the guardian,

1179
01:11:23,113 --> 01:11:26,700
the man whom you disobey at your peril.

1180
01:11:27,117 --> 01:11:28,435
It's nice to go from him

1181
01:11:28,535 --> 01:11:32,539
to something as relatively mundane
as Jane's caravan.

1182
01:11:33,207 --> 01:11:35,943
This is the moment in the movie,

1183
01:11:36,043 --> 01:11:39,380
in a way, where it could go
several different places.

1184
01:11:40,714 --> 01:11:43,909
Thor is without his powers,
he's starting, he's reborn, if you like,

1185
01:11:44,009 --> 01:11:48,455
and so, this is a moment
where we understand,

1186
01:11:48,555 --> 01:11:52,835
maybe with Loki's activities
in the worlds above,

1187
01:11:52,935 --> 01:11:55,379
that it's the calm before the storm.

1188
01:11:55,479 --> 01:11:59,633
But it's the calm in which the audience
have a chance to take in this new Thor,

1189
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:02,194
and, I think, fully invest in him

1190
01:12:03,278 --> 01:12:05,598
and perhaps invest in the idea

1191
01:12:05,698 --> 01:12:08,142
of some kind of relationship
between him and Jane.

1192
01:12:08,242 --> 01:12:11,186
It is difficult in a big action film

1193
01:12:11,286 --> 01:12:15,791
to allow the room for romance,
if you like, or a kind of

1194
01:12:17,418 --> 01:12:21,755
chemistry between
perhaps the central boy and gal,

1195
01:12:22,923 --> 01:12:26,744
having any extra dimensions,

1196
01:12:26,844 --> 01:12:28,996
or even just having
a feeling of authenticity

1197
01:12:29,096 --> 01:12:30,998
to whatever level that's pursued.

1198
01:12:31,098 --> 01:12:35,002
It isn't the case that these things
have to be grand passions.

1199
01:12:35,102 --> 01:12:37,107
I suppose what you want to feel
is that they like each other,

1200
01:12:37,187 --> 01:12:39,340
that they get on, that they're listening,

1201
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,176
that it's a relationship in which, slowly,

1202
01:12:42,276 --> 01:12:44,261
you're interested in what happens,

1203
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:46,347
and in which you might invest.

1204
01:12:46,447 --> 01:12:47,723
It can't be overburdened

1205
01:12:47,823 --> 01:12:52,603
by suddenly becoming
the grand passion of the ages,

1206
01:12:52,703 --> 01:12:56,649
and yet, there is much to value

1207
01:12:56,749 --> 01:13:00,335
out of these instant connections

1208
01:13:00,627 --> 01:13:02,696
between, in this case,
people from other worlds.

1209
01:13:02,796 --> 01:13:05,427
Many people have asked me about the
sort of Shakespearean influence on this.

1210
01:13:05,507 --> 01:13:09,203
And I can't say any of it was remotely,
if it is, there,

1211
01:13:09,303 --> 01:13:10,996
that it's only because
Shakespeare nicked

1212
01:13:11,096 --> 01:13:16,168
some terrific story ideas and plot points
from great writers of the past,

1213
01:13:16,268 --> 01:13:17,836
and we continue to steal from him.

1214
01:13:17,936 --> 01:13:22,883
And one situation
that clearly was a big hit for him

1215
01:13:22,983 --> 01:13:26,053
was the idea of putting people together
from different worlds,

1216
01:13:26,153 --> 01:13:28,597
the <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>
if you like, of it all.

1217
01:13:28,697 --> 01:13:31,642
And so, the beginnings of that
starts here,

1218
01:13:31,742 --> 01:13:35,604
which is simply that a new and humble
and modest Thor is listening,

1219
01:13:35,704 --> 01:13:39,316
and is asking questions
and is caring about someone else.

1220
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:42,069
He is interested in someone else.

1221
01:13:42,169 --> 01:13:47,533
And that generosity of spirit, of course,
is incredibly winning for us, for Jane,

1222
01:13:47,633 --> 01:13:51,829
and you see a quite honest
beginning to a relationship

1223
01:13:51,929 --> 01:13:55,582
that leaves the question mark
of exactly how far can it go

1224
01:13:55,682 --> 01:13:58,185
during the context of this story?

1225
01:13:59,144 --> 01:14:01,463
And what kind of weight can it hold,

1226
01:14:01,563 --> 01:14:06,819
and can it do that
whilst still allowing for it to be fun?

1227
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:09,847
And I think that many people have
commented about this scene,

1228
01:14:09,947 --> 01:14:11,974
that it's their favourite scene
in the movie.

1229
01:14:12,074 --> 01:14:18,288
You get some wonderful simple things,
which are, this look, for instance.

1230
01:14:18,705 --> 01:14:21,416
Natalie Portman looking at someone

1231
01:14:22,084 --> 01:14:25,279
and letting us understand
that she may feel something for him

1232
01:14:25,379 --> 01:14:28,090
that is even beginning to surprise her.

1233
01:14:28,715 --> 01:14:31,827
I think that that qualify
in her performance,

1234
01:14:31,927 --> 01:14:34,496
subtle, brief, rich,

1235
01:14:34,596 --> 01:14:39,685
is one of the things
that sort of helps distinguish the picture

1236
01:14:40,394 --> 01:14:43,464
in terms of how it
approaches certain things.

1237
01:14:43,564 --> 01:14:46,425
We're trying not to work too hard,
but just for it to be real,

1238
01:14:46,525 --> 01:14:49,762
and I think that she's very real,
very convincing there,

1239
01:14:49,862 --> 01:14:51,513
she's very, very charming

1240
01:14:51,613 --> 01:14:54,700
as she laughs
about the Hubble/Hooble mix-up.

1241
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:22,211
This is a handsome shot of our hero.

1242
01:15:22,311 --> 01:15:25,547
All the way through shooting,
between Mr. Hemsworth, Ms. Portman,

1243
01:15:25,647 --> 01:15:29,776
and all of them,
Kat, Jaimie, all the boys,

1244
01:15:30,569 --> 01:15:32,930
Tom and then some
of the other Warriors Three,

1245
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:34,451
who I'll talk about in a little while,

1246
01:15:34,531 --> 01:15:35,766
one was constantly reminded

1247
01:15:35,866 --> 01:15:38,869
of what an amazingly handsome
group of people,

1248
01:15:39,703 --> 01:15:41,021
marvellous to look at.

1249
01:15:41,121 --> 01:15:47,169
Here, the Warriors Three
are disputing what to do.

1250
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:49,571
Josh Dallas plays Fandral,

1251
01:15:49,671 --> 01:15:53,467
and he does so with an English accent
with great aplomb,

1252
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,078
marvellous debonair dash.

1253
01:15:56,178 --> 01:15:58,872
And he's matched equally
by the tremendous Ray Stevenson,

1254
01:15:58,972 --> 01:16:04,169
who you'll know from his brilliant turn
on the HBO TV series <i>Rome</i>

1255
01:16:04,269 --> 01:16:05,587
and many, many other films.

1256
01:16:05,687 --> 01:16:08,006
I worked with Ray many moons ago,

1257
01:16:08,106 --> 01:16:13,470
and it was a pleasure to bring
his incredible screen gifts.

1258
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:15,931
He's got such a great face for movies.

1259
01:16:16,031 --> 01:16:18,308
Handsome lad
who knows how to be still.

1260
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:22,229
He's matched here by Tadanobu Asano,
a great star from Japan,

1261
01:16:22,329 --> 01:16:26,733
who brings to the role of
Hogun the Grim inscrutability,

1262
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:30,487
but an enigmatic, playful intelligence

1263
01:16:30,587 --> 01:16:34,074
and a sort of deadly capacity
for physical violence.

1264
01:16:34,174 --> 01:16:36,827
You know that when he speaks,
it's gonna be important.

1265
01:16:36,927 --> 01:16:39,997
There was great camaraderie
between these four,

1266
01:16:40,097 --> 01:16:43,750
and it really fuelled
the quality of the scenes,

1267
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:47,854
the sense of that bond between them,
and loyalty and fun, of course.

1268
01:16:55,696 --> 01:17:00,184
It's true to say that there was more of
the Warriors Three and Lady Sif shot,

1269
01:17:00,284 --> 01:17:02,978
and once again, not through
lack of qualify from them,

1270
01:17:03,078 --> 01:17:09,943
but through a simple
traffic jam of elements

1271
01:17:10,043 --> 01:17:15,007
that we wanted to put gracefully
into this world of the film,

1272
01:17:16,466 --> 01:17:18,096
it wasn't possible to include everything.

1273
01:17:18,176 --> 01:17:20,120
But they had great fun.

1274
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:23,457
And some of it now
infuses this part of the movie

1275
01:17:23,557 --> 01:17:28,228
where once again, we enjoy
the fact of the gods coming to Earth.

1276
01:17:31,815 --> 01:17:35,302
Here, the rhythm of the film,
as it switches so instantaneously,

1277
01:17:35,402 --> 01:17:39,723
is a great tribute
to the gifts of our editor, Paul Rubell,

1278
01:17:39,823 --> 01:17:42,017
who was a wonderful collaborator
throughout.

1279
01:17:42,117 --> 01:17:47,898
A marvellous and award-winning editor,
and very musical.

1280
01:17:47,998 --> 01:17:51,735
I always think it's very helpful
if an editor is musical.

1281
01:17:51,835 --> 01:17:55,447
He plays the piano,
but he has an intuitive feel

1282
01:17:55,547 --> 01:17:59,201
for the length of a cut
and the feel of a cut,

1283
01:17:59,301 --> 01:18:01,370
and has so many tricks at his disposal

1284
01:18:01,470 --> 01:18:03,705
to do with being able
to use everything we can.

1285
01:18:03,805 --> 01:18:07,751
Whether it's split screens,
or accelerating shots,

1286
01:18:07,851 --> 01:18:09,753
or flipping and flopping shots,

1287
01:18:09,853 --> 01:18:12,172
really, we used
every kind of trick in the book here,

1288
01:18:12,272 --> 01:18:16,343
and he had that in addition to the
great treasure trove of visual effects

1289
01:18:16,443 --> 01:18:19,237
that produces things like the Destroyer.

1290
01:18:22,741 --> 01:18:25,452
So, we bring the Warriors Four to Earth.

1291
01:18:26,745 --> 01:18:31,733
This is a fun moment
and one that is tough to get just right.

1292
01:18:31,833 --> 01:18:35,879
It's very nicely underpinned
by Patrick's music.

1293
01:18:36,338 --> 01:18:38,907
There's a part of the magic of movies,

1294
01:18:39,007 --> 01:18:41,910
the character Volstagg
was not in the shot that you saw,

1295
01:18:42,010 --> 01:18:44,474
we filmed him separately afterwards,
and we put him into the shot.

1296
01:18:44,554 --> 01:18:47,082
The kind of thing
that seemed necessary in post,

1297
01:18:47,182 --> 01:18:50,585
and only possible because you're
working on a great, big Marvel movie

1298
01:18:50,685 --> 01:18:52,629
where that kind of thing can happen.

1299
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:54,881
It was one of the numerous moments
where I thought,

1300
01:18:54,981 --> 01:18:57,884
"Gosh, if I had this opportunity
on previous films,"

1301
01:18:57,984 --> 01:19:00,262
"they'd all have
cost squinty billion dollars."

1302
01:19:00,362 --> 01:19:02,931
But I hasten to add
that's not what this cost,

1303
01:19:03,031 --> 01:19:07,994
but it does provide
the chance to get things right.

1304
01:19:10,414 --> 01:19:14,735
Just before we head
into the last phase of the movie,

1305
01:19:14,835 --> 01:19:17,112
which is full of action and destruction,

1306
01:19:17,212 --> 01:19:20,407
it's lovely to have had,
including the cup drop,

1307
01:19:20,507 --> 01:19:24,261
a piece of delicious daft comedy.

1308
01:19:25,011 --> 01:19:29,291
Before now, coming back to
the big question of why they're here,

1309
01:19:29,391 --> 01:19:32,185
of taking Thor home.

1310
01:19:39,943 --> 01:19:42,012
But of course,
it being the kind of movie it is,

1311
01:19:42,112 --> 01:19:43,533
we're not going to make it
as easy as that,

1312
01:19:43,613 --> 01:19:47,225
and there's going to be
a significant sequence now

1313
01:19:47,325 --> 01:19:51,271
where the Destroyer, called by Loki,
comes to Earth

1314
01:19:51,371 --> 01:19:54,483
to deal with Thor and prevent his return.

1315
01:19:54,583 --> 01:19:57,402
First, of course,
Loki has to deal with Heimdall,

1316
01:19:57,502 --> 01:19:59,237
who's been registering suspicion.

1317
01:19:59,337 --> 01:20:01,239
And I love, by the way, this shot

1318
01:20:01,339 --> 01:20:04,368
and the way it evokes the kinds of work

1319
01:20:04,468 --> 01:20:08,430
that were done
by the French VFX vendors BUF,

1320
01:20:08,847 --> 01:20:11,333
Pierre Buffin and his team
with Nicolas Chevallier,

1321
01:20:11,433 --> 01:20:13,960
a great team there
who were able to give us

1322
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:16,963
both the incredible water effects

1323
01:20:17,063 --> 01:20:23,053
and the beaten copper,
space-aged qualities

1324
01:20:23,153 --> 01:20:25,389
to the outside of the observatory.

1325
01:20:25,489 --> 01:20:28,183
This marvellous effect with Heimdall

1326
01:20:28,283 --> 01:20:32,270
and the freezing that comes out
of the Casket of Ancient Winters.

1327
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:34,167
I love the water
in the background of this shot

1328
01:20:34,247 --> 01:20:37,167
and the idea
of encasing Heimdall like this.

1329
01:20:45,258 --> 01:20:47,285
Back on Earth,
we had other things to contend with.

1330
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:50,080
In New Mexico,
quite splendid though it is,

1331
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:51,790
and although some of this is enhanced,

1332
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:53,583
we had our own challenges
with the weather.

1333
01:20:53,683 --> 01:20:58,255
Not with the arrival of the Destroyer,
but with four seasons in a day,

1334
01:20:58,355 --> 01:21:01,675
sometimes 50-mile-an-hour winds,

1335
01:21:01,775 --> 01:21:06,112
sometimes hail, sometimes snow,
sometimes rain,

1336
01:21:06,863 --> 01:21:08,014
literally all in one day.

1337
01:21:08,114 --> 01:21:10,308
And so, sometimes working out quite
what we could shoot

1338
01:21:10,408 --> 01:21:13,995
or if we could still shoot
was pretty difficult.

1339
01:21:16,122 --> 01:21:18,400
Once again, Darcy, it seems to me,

1340
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,444
is a great representative
of the audience,

1341
01:21:20,544 --> 01:21:23,196
and Kat Dennings played her beautifully.

1342
01:21:23,296 --> 01:21:28,869
She has a great comic gift
and is also extremely smart.

1343
01:21:28,969 --> 01:21:32,372
She's one of those characters
who allows you to believe

1344
01:21:32,472 --> 01:21:36,643
that there is a very different
kind of individual in there,

1345
01:21:37,143 --> 01:21:39,880
beyond the surface
of a very quick-witted,

1346
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:43,525
sort of cynical, sarcastic individual.

1347
01:21:43,817 --> 01:21:48,889
And it seems to me she scores
in almost every moment she speaks,

1348
01:21:48,989 --> 01:21:50,991
and it's very valuable.

1349
01:21:55,287 --> 01:21:58,190
What it gives you, as you approach
these big sequences

1350
01:21:58,290 --> 01:22:00,253
at the end of the movie,
is a chance to orchestrate.

1351
01:22:00,333 --> 01:22:04,738
You know that somewhere
you want to go from fun to laughter,

1352
01:22:04,838 --> 01:22:08,408
to thrill, to exhilaration, to violence,

1353
01:22:08,508 --> 01:22:14,289
to big music, to little music,
to rhythm, to excitement,

1354
01:22:14,389 --> 01:22:20,253
and so, there's this thriller throb
to some of the action here.

1355
01:22:20,353 --> 01:22:22,756
Camera moving all of the time,

1356
01:22:22,856 --> 01:22:26,401
interrupted by this,
the great weight of the Destroyer.

1357
01:22:27,193 --> 01:22:28,261
In planning this sequence,

1358
01:22:28,361 --> 01:22:31,326
I remember it was one of the first things
I did when I arrived in New Mexico,

1359
01:22:31,406 --> 01:22:32,599
and down this very street,

1360
01:22:32,699 --> 01:22:36,077
where the beautiful Jaimie Alexander
is just about to hide herself,

1361
01:22:36,411 --> 01:22:38,355
I walked with 30, 40 colleagues,

1362
01:22:38,455 --> 01:22:41,066
and we tried to work out
where we needed to be,

1363
01:22:41,166 --> 01:22:45,337
and how we needed to shoot
all of the following and in what order.

1364
01:22:45,879 --> 01:22:49,908
This was as complicated logistically
as anything on the picture,

1365
01:22:50,008 --> 01:22:54,721
because it depended on certainty
about when certain bombs would go off,

1366
01:22:55,138 --> 01:22:58,333
when things that blew up out of
the bottom of the road would be buried,

1367
01:22:58,433 --> 01:23:00,669
when the special effects
would be buried,

1368
01:23:00,769 --> 01:23:02,796
when the second unit could come in

1369
01:23:02,896 --> 01:23:05,465
and shoot the scenes
that they needed to do.

1370
01:23:05,565 --> 01:23:07,279
So, for instance,
you won't be surprised to know

1371
01:23:07,359 --> 01:23:10,262
that was Kylie Furneaux,
her stunt double,

1372
01:23:10,362 --> 01:23:14,182
not Jaimie Alexander, who did
the biggest of those leaps as Sif.

1373
01:23:14,282 --> 01:23:17,644
That had to be scheduled at a time
when we were off doing something else

1374
01:23:17,744 --> 01:23:21,648
so that Vic Armstrong and his team
had the entire town to himself.

1375
01:23:21,748 --> 01:23:26,152
And so, the make-up of this particular
sequence, the orchestration

1376
01:23:26,252 --> 01:23:29,823
and, indeed, the working
with the Destroyer who, on the day,

1377
01:23:29,923 --> 01:23:34,160
was sometimes a complete
replicated model, but immobile.

1378
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:39,165
Sometimes it was just
a large pair of lighting clamps

1379
01:23:39,265 --> 01:23:41,668
with some gaffer tape at the top of it

1380
01:23:41,768 --> 01:23:44,879
to indicate
what the Destroyer looked like.

1381
01:23:44,979 --> 01:23:48,675
But it was one sequence
in which both myself

1382
01:23:48,775 --> 01:23:52,721
and my very excellent first
assistant director, Luc Etienne,

1383
01:23:52,821 --> 01:23:55,098
would call out through megaphones,

1384
01:23:55,198 --> 01:24:01,521
across the sounds of huge fans
creating wind or this kind of debris,

1385
01:24:01,621 --> 01:24:04,107
exactly what was happening,
so that here, Jaimie would know,

1386
01:24:04,207 --> 01:24:08,278
"The Destroyer's arriving on your left,
there's smoke on your right," et cetera.

1387
01:24:08,378 --> 01:24:10,697
There needed to be
a clear path through,

1388
01:24:10,797 --> 01:24:13,617
even when out in the open,
not against green screen here,

1389
01:24:13,717 --> 01:24:16,306
although sometimes we did, indeed,
use green or blue screen outside.

1390
01:24:16,386 --> 01:24:19,789
But here, you needed both the benefits
of the actual debris

1391
01:24:19,889 --> 01:24:22,834
and wreckage of cars
and fires that we did provide live.

1392
01:24:22,934 --> 01:24:27,088
But you constantly needed to tell people
what might be happening up in Asgard,

1393
01:24:27,188 --> 01:24:30,050
what was happening
with the Destroyer himself,

1394
01:24:30,150 --> 01:24:34,112
and keep people firmly in touch
with what we're after.

1395
01:24:34,654 --> 01:24:38,099
This brings us to the moment story-wise
that we'd really been aiming for

1396
01:24:38,199 --> 01:24:40,310
that is so inevitably connected
to the moment

1397
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:43,563
where Thor walks into the movie
for the first time as a grown-up,

1398
01:24:43,663 --> 01:24:47,067
a man who is unwilling
to sacrifice anything,

1399
01:24:47,167 --> 01:24:49,069
so selfish is he.

1400
01:24:49,169 --> 01:24:51,363
And in the moment that follows now,

1401
01:24:51,463 --> 01:24:56,743
we have a man who has learnt
that he must, can and should be able

1402
01:24:56,843 --> 01:24:58,870
as a great leader, as a great king,

1403
01:24:58,970 --> 01:25:00,413
but simply perhaps not as a god

1404
01:25:00,513 --> 01:25:04,017
but as a man,
be prepared to sacrifice everything.

1405
01:25:04,517 --> 01:25:06,853
In this case, it means his life.

1406
01:25:07,353 --> 01:25:08,838
Natalie Portman asks that question,

1407
01:25:08,938 --> 01:25:11,132
but perhaps as an audience
we already know.

1408
01:25:11,232 --> 01:25:17,347
He's doing what has to be done,
he's doing what a hero would do,

1409
01:25:17,447 --> 01:25:20,600
not the act of a man
who thinks he's a hero,

1410
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:24,437
but simply he does what has to be done.
It ends up being heroic.

1411
01:25:24,537 --> 01:25:28,775
This is not about Thor, this is about
resolving things with his brother.

1412
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:33,863
Crucially, it's about saving the people
and the town that is Puente Antiguo,

1413
01:25:33,963 --> 01:25:36,700
and saving the lives of those
who have come to help him

1414
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,427
and from whom he has learnt
and grown.

1415
01:25:40,428 --> 01:25:41,913
The way Chris Hemsworth does this,

1416
01:25:42,013 --> 01:25:44,124
the Patrick Doyle music
to accompany it,

1417
01:25:44,224 --> 01:25:48,169
the way in which it takes place in
the format of a sort of Wild West fight,

1418
01:25:48,269 --> 01:25:50,505
the showdown,
a kind of high noon moment,

1419
01:25:50,605 --> 01:25:54,134
all of this, I felt, had a sort of leanness
and simplicity to it

1420
01:25:54,234 --> 01:25:58,738
that I thought was
part of the story of the hero.

1421
01:25:59,239 --> 01:26:01,558
And we wanted to maintain surprise

1422
01:26:01,658 --> 01:26:05,395
about how brother Loki
would finally react to this,

1423
01:26:05,495 --> 01:26:09,482
and whether that could
and should change his mind.

1424
01:26:09,582 --> 01:26:11,668
Can it end in peace?

1425
01:26:15,797 --> 01:26:18,466
And the answer is, of course, it can't.

1426
01:26:20,593 --> 01:26:24,164
And we wanted the surprise,
not of the blast there,

1427
01:26:24,264 --> 01:26:26,833
but of a sort of trick,
a piece of Lokian mischief

1428
01:26:26,933 --> 01:26:28,835
which takes the Destroyer's beam away,

1429
01:26:28,935 --> 01:26:32,172
appears to perhaps indicate
that Thor has persuaded him,

1430
01:26:32,272 --> 01:26:34,107
that he will understand, but, no.

1431
01:26:34,607 --> 01:26:37,844
A sneaky trick,
the smack the back of the hand,

1432
01:26:37,944 --> 01:26:41,389
and the clearly fatal blow
takes us to the point

1433
01:26:41,489 --> 01:26:44,392
where perhaps we've always known
we must arrive,

1434
01:26:44,492 --> 01:26:47,203
which is at the death of Thor.

1435
01:26:47,662 --> 01:26:52,650
The death of a man who did not think,
the death of a man who did not care,

1436
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:55,195
the death of a man who was selfish,

1437
01:26:55,295 --> 01:26:57,697
the death of a man
who disregarded his family,

1438
01:26:57,797 --> 01:26:59,757
his home, his friends,

1439
01:27:00,967 --> 01:27:04,496
and in a sense, symbolically at least,

1440
01:27:04,596 --> 01:27:07,624
that man, that creature had to die.

1441
01:27:07,724 --> 01:27:10,376
He had to give it up.
He had to sacrifice it.

1442
01:27:10,476 --> 01:27:14,522
He had to become, to use Odin's word,

1443
01:27:15,273 --> 01:27:17,967
"worthy" in that act of sacrifice.

1444
01:27:18,067 --> 01:27:20,220
That act of sacrifice from a god,

1445
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:24,474
perhaps, could lie the seeds,
perhaps instant,

1446
01:27:24,574 --> 01:27:28,995
as they say, enlightenment comes
to those who find it, redemption.

1447
01:27:29,704 --> 01:27:34,000
And it's a redemption,
triggered partly by a father's pain

1448
01:27:34,792 --> 01:27:36,069
and a father's pride.

1449
01:27:36,169 --> 01:27:37,779
And so from Odin,

1450
01:27:37,879 --> 01:27:42,283
we go back to that other hero of the film,

1451
01:27:42,383 --> 01:27:45,637
trapped, but no longer, Mjolnir.

1452
01:27:48,306 --> 01:27:52,377
And this leads us to a moment
that we discussed over and over,

1453
01:27:52,477 --> 01:27:58,524
how visually, emotionally,
musically, effects-ly,

1454
01:27:58,900 --> 01:28:01,302
we could bring together this moment

1455
01:28:01,402 --> 01:28:04,597
that we hoped, maybe in a movie
theatre, could have the audience cheer

1456
01:28:04,697 --> 01:28:07,016
if they loved him as much as we did,

1457
01:28:07,116 --> 01:28:10,161
and if they valued
the idea of that happening.

1458
01:28:10,662 --> 01:28:14,040
The God of Thunder is back in charge,

1459
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:17,335
powers restored,

1460
01:28:19,128 --> 01:28:24,217
armour back on his
magnificent god's frame,

1461
01:28:25,259 --> 01:28:27,804
announcing his success to the world,

1462
01:28:30,515 --> 01:28:34,127
providing awe and wonder
in those who watch him.

1463
01:28:34,227 --> 01:28:38,856
And now, a chance to have revenge
and some fun, as well.

1464
01:28:41,109 --> 01:28:44,387
This musical cue was written
probably three, four, five times.

1465
01:28:44,487 --> 01:28:46,180
The action sequence here,

1466
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:51,619
exactly what could Thor do
to potentially trounce the Destroyer?

1467
01:28:51,911 --> 01:28:56,691
This was something that,
even though it's visual effects intensive,

1468
01:28:56,791 --> 01:29:00,336
we worked on for almost
the entire period of the shoot.

1469
01:29:01,629 --> 01:29:03,072
Two things needed to happen,

1470
01:29:03,172 --> 01:29:06,326
this needed to be an absolute example
of the awesome power

1471
01:29:06,426 --> 01:29:10,680
of a fully restored, fully motivated,
truly heroic Thor,

1472
01:29:11,097 --> 01:29:13,791
and it also needed
to happen quite swiftly,

1473
01:29:13,891 --> 01:29:15,793
because we know that
dealing with Destroyer

1474
01:29:15,893 --> 01:29:19,005
will not be the only thing
Thor has to deal with

1475
01:29:19,105 --> 01:29:20,715
before the end of this film.

1476
01:29:20,815 --> 01:29:22,300
He needs to get back home,

1477
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,552
and this needs to be
taking care of business

1478
01:29:24,652 --> 01:29:27,055
and taking care of business
spectacularly,

1479
01:29:27,155 --> 01:29:31,492
but efficiently and briskly,
so that we understand

1480
01:29:32,035 --> 01:29:34,812
what a superhero is
when he's at his best.

1481
01:29:34,912 --> 01:29:40,460
He's efficient, he just gets on with it,
and is a very good neighbour.

1482
01:29:48,259 --> 01:29:51,537
So now, the film takes on
a different kind of pace.

1483
01:29:51,637 --> 01:29:54,374
Earth is protected,
Puente Antiguo is saved,

1484
01:29:54,474 --> 01:29:56,417
there's some business to take care of,

1485
01:29:56,517 --> 01:29:59,671
which is the issue
of the return of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1486
01:29:59,771 --> 01:30:05,510
and Clark Gregg's very funny reading
of this last moment with Thor

1487
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:08,179
before he needs to return to Asgard.

1488
01:30:08,279 --> 01:30:11,099
And it also, I suppose,
lays out the possibility

1489
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:15,019
that Jane Foster and Selvig may work
with S.H.I.E.L.D. in some future world

1490
01:30:15,119 --> 01:30:17,563
where that research,
which has brought her so close

1491
01:30:17,663 --> 01:30:20,441
to understanding
how and where Thor is from,

1492
01:30:20,541 --> 01:30:23,611
may perhaps be
developed into something that could

1493
01:30:23,711 --> 01:30:25,713
tell us yet more stories.

1494
01:30:35,515 --> 01:30:38,001
Meantime, back on Asgard,

1495
01:30:38,101 --> 01:30:42,188
Loki allows access for the Frost Giants.

1496
01:30:44,982 --> 01:30:49,095
And lonely Heimdall
looks to have been outwitted.

1497
01:30:49,195 --> 01:30:54,434
I'm sure that can't happen for long.
One feels his frustration in there,

1498
01:30:54,534 --> 01:30:57,770
and I certainly wouldn't want to try
and tie up Idris Elba

1499
01:30:57,870 --> 01:31:00,289
in any way that restricted him.

1500
01:31:01,874 --> 01:31:05,570
We shot these sequences
in the New Mexican desert,

1501
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:08,339
and it was one of the areas

1502
01:31:09,006 --> 01:31:12,910
where it was so, so much
a signature of the picture

1503
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:15,288
to see whether it would
work successfully

1504
01:31:15,388 --> 01:31:19,542
to put these costumes
from these Asgardians on Earth.

1505
01:31:19,642 --> 01:31:22,128
And in that space of the desert,
on that kind of canvas,

1506
01:31:22,228 --> 01:31:25,064
I was very, very pleased with the results.

1507
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,844
So, to see them there,
there's something, I don't know,

1508
01:31:29,944 --> 01:31:33,806
very, very much in tune with
modern versions of the comic books.

1509
01:31:33,906 --> 01:31:35,975
Particularly, for instance,
runs of the comics

1510
01:31:36,075 --> 01:31:39,062
that had been authored
by Joe Michael Straczynski,

1511
01:31:39,162 --> 01:31:44,750
who, in a way, was part of perfecting
the modern version of Thor on Earth.

1512
01:31:49,422 --> 01:31:53,342
Heimdall is heroic and allows us

1513
01:31:54,135 --> 01:31:59,123
to just see what we can play,
of the extent to which

1514
01:31:59,223 --> 01:32:04,045
this romantic feeling between
Thor and Jane can play in the movie.

1515
01:32:04,145 --> 01:32:06,005
And I think it's a tribute to these two

1516
01:32:06,105 --> 01:32:09,175
that it carries much more weight
than it might otherwise do

1517
01:32:09,275 --> 01:32:12,678
because of its gentleness
and its simplicity.

1518
01:32:12,778 --> 01:32:13,971
It doesn't strain too hard,

1519
01:32:14,071 --> 01:32:19,185
they don't strain too hard to be
super sexy, super cool, super romantic.

1520
01:32:19,285 --> 01:32:22,438
As a result, I think
that they are all of those things,

1521
01:32:22,538 --> 01:32:24,690
and I think we want them to be together.

1522
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:28,986
We know that this hasn't progressed
into the grand love affair,

1523
01:32:29,086 --> 01:32:32,990
but we see that it has the potential
for perhaps something very special

1524
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:35,468
and that there is a connection.

1525
01:32:41,974 --> 01:32:45,545
Now, we head into
the final phase of the film.

1526
01:32:45,645 --> 01:32:50,316
We're back on Asgard, and the family
business has to be taken care of.

1527
01:32:53,319 --> 01:32:55,596
First of all, of course,
we give Frigga a moment

1528
01:32:55,696 --> 01:33:00,143
to do what any warrior queen would do,
which is to try and defend her husband.

1529
01:33:00,243 --> 01:33:03,479
We consciously kept
the world of Asgard, these corridors,

1530
01:33:03,579 --> 01:33:06,107
a little emptier
than you might expect them to be,

1531
01:33:06,207 --> 01:33:08,254
suggesting that gods know
how to look after themselves,

1532
01:33:08,334 --> 01:33:09,861
especially gods in Asgard.

1533
01:33:09,961 --> 01:33:12,672
They're not expecting to be invaded.

1534
01:33:14,006 --> 01:33:20,680
I enjoyed reflecting Colm Feore
in Anthony Hopkins' eyeball.

1535
01:33:22,431 --> 01:33:24,959
That's the last creature
I'd wish to have hovering above me,

1536
01:33:25,059 --> 01:33:27,962
and it's especially creepy
that as he says

1537
01:33:28,062 --> 01:33:31,090
Odin can hear and see what's going on,

1538
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:34,986
even as his attempted murder begins,

1539
01:33:35,528 --> 01:33:37,388
but we know it's only attempted

1540
01:33:37,488 --> 01:33:40,183
because what we hoped
and discovered in previews

1541
01:33:40,283 --> 01:33:44,228
would be the audience believing
that that blow had been struck by Thor,

1542
01:33:44,328 --> 01:33:48,165
actually have an intake of breath
when they understand it is Loki.

1543
01:33:48,624 --> 01:33:51,777
And let's, while he's there,
the great Tom Hiddleston,

1544
01:33:51,877 --> 01:33:54,280
have a talk about those helmets.

1545
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:57,366
That helmet was worn in two pieces,
it was extremely painful.

1546
01:33:57,466 --> 01:33:58,826
He was very patient about it.

1547
01:33:58,926 --> 01:34:01,120
All the helmets were heavy and tight

1548
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:03,456
in order to have the great look,
the great line.

1549
01:34:03,556 --> 01:34:06,542
Nothing could rattle, nothing could roll.

1550
01:34:06,642 --> 01:34:09,295
And the combination
of what the collar does,

1551
01:34:09,395 --> 01:34:14,066
the lines on the front of that costume,
ditto Thor's,

1552
01:34:14,734 --> 01:34:20,848
they make it work in
a very streamlined, aerodynamic way

1553
01:34:20,948 --> 01:34:26,954
that hints at the classic renditions
of the frames from the comics,

1554
01:34:27,330 --> 01:34:29,982
but in the way they're worn,

1555
01:34:30,082 --> 01:34:32,318
in the colours, in the palette,
in the textures,

1556
01:34:32,418 --> 01:34:34,612
it stops at being campy,
stops at being kitschy,

1557
01:34:34,712 --> 01:34:36,364
or, at least, not to a degree

1558
01:34:36,464 --> 01:34:41,635
that allows us to accept a different
kind of robustness to it.

1559
01:34:50,895 --> 01:34:54,982
Our rules about
how this observatory worked means that

1560
01:34:55,649 --> 01:34:59,862
we could now have,
instead of Heimdall's sword/key,

1561
01:35:00,279 --> 01:35:03,015
that was what made it work,
we accepted the idea

1562
01:35:03,115 --> 01:35:05,351
that the other instrument
that could make that work

1563
01:35:05,451 --> 01:35:07,937
was Gungnir, Odin's spear.

1564
01:35:08,037 --> 01:35:09,689
And now, usable by Loki,

1565
01:35:09,789 --> 01:35:14,752
because in Odin's absence,
Loki runs Asgard,

1566
01:35:15,127 --> 01:35:17,113
that very sort of map,

1567
01:35:17,213 --> 01:35:20,533
that kind of astral reflective map
of Yggdrasil

1568
01:35:20,633 --> 01:35:22,451
is now frozen, locked solid.

1569
01:35:22,551 --> 01:35:25,454
And we liked the idea of doing this
in order to create

1570
01:35:25,554 --> 01:35:30,376
not a travelling light source that could
take you briefly, instantaneously

1571
01:35:30,476 --> 01:35:33,212
through time warps to other times
and places and worlds,

1572
01:35:33,312 --> 01:35:37,008
but now a burgeoning,
building nuclear weapon.

1573
01:35:37,108 --> 01:35:42,054
So that Bifrost, the miracle agent
of time and space travel,

1574
01:35:42,154 --> 01:35:44,657
becomes the agent of destruction.

1575
01:35:48,577 --> 01:35:51,397
But of course,
although that technology is at work,

1576
01:35:51,497 --> 01:35:53,024
we see it frozen open,

1577
01:35:53,124 --> 01:35:57,236
ready to create chaos on the world
that Loki must destroy,

1578
01:35:57,336 --> 01:35:59,572
the world of his parentage.

1579
01:35:59,672 --> 01:36:01,907
The idea of wiping out the race

1580
01:36:02,007 --> 01:36:04,243
that would prove
that there are no more of that race,

1581
01:36:04,343 --> 01:36:06,287
so that Loki really is an Asgardian,

1582
01:36:06,387 --> 01:36:10,875
is part of where his passionate
determination to belong

1583
01:36:10,975 --> 01:36:15,229
and to win his father's approval
has now sort of led him to.

1584
01:36:17,982 --> 01:36:22,636
So, in the middle of this burgeoning,
sort of technological explosion,

1585
01:36:22,736 --> 01:36:25,014
there is concentrated in this arena,

1586
01:36:25,114 --> 01:36:27,767
this now different arena,
this frozen arena,

1587
01:36:27,867 --> 01:36:32,913
this resolution of the biblical battle
between two brothers.

1588
01:36:34,582 --> 01:36:39,528
Two brothers whose conflict now
is potentially liable

1589
01:36:39,628 --> 01:36:43,157
to see the destruction
of part or all of the universe,

1590
01:36:43,257 --> 01:36:44,992
but certainly Jotunheim.

1591
01:36:45,092 --> 01:36:48,954
And all of this has come from a dispute,
if you like, at one simple level

1592
01:36:49,054 --> 01:36:53,876
about their own competition
to enjoy, approve, receive,

1593
01:36:53,976 --> 01:36:56,645
be preeminent in their father's love.

1594
01:36:58,397 --> 01:37:01,967
And now, with these two
extraordinary weapons as equals,

1595
01:37:02,067 --> 01:37:04,470
and inside the dangerous,

1596
01:37:04,570 --> 01:37:10,101
evermore acceleratingly lethal
world of the frozen Bifrost,

1597
01:37:10,201 --> 01:37:14,897
with the observatory and Asgard's fate
spinning out of control,

1598
01:37:14,997 --> 01:37:21,028
you have these stakes and this action
heightening with every blow, as it were.

1599
01:37:21,128 --> 01:37:25,324
It's a battle, it would seem,
of two equals

1600
01:37:25,424 --> 01:37:29,036
that now spills out
onto the Rainbow Bridge.

1601
01:37:29,136 --> 01:37:32,581
And it was this kind of image, it was
rather like the horses riding across it.

1602
01:37:32,681 --> 01:37:36,710
And this kind of image,
the idea of these two brothers,

1603
01:37:36,810 --> 01:37:41,298
people who we recognise with
human traits, human characteristics,

1604
01:37:41,398 --> 01:37:44,385
fighting with real passions,
real motivations,

1605
01:37:44,485 --> 01:37:46,512
but nevertheless fighting,

1606
01:37:46,612 --> 01:37:50,266
at extreme danger in an epic landscape.

1607
01:37:50,366 --> 01:37:53,644
This bridge in the middle
of outer space,

1608
01:37:53,744 --> 01:37:58,415
attached to the asteroid
on which Asgard rules the universe,

1609
01:37:58,874 --> 01:38:04,697
led to the bridge now in danger
of using its power and its beam

1610
01:38:04,797 --> 01:38:09,702
to destroy one, perhaps more worlds
if this conflict isn't resolved.

1611
01:38:09,802 --> 01:38:12,204
The idea, the heightened nature
of all of that

1612
01:38:12,304 --> 01:38:17,001
seemed to me something that could be
so remarkable and unusual,

1613
01:38:17,101 --> 01:38:21,005
and I'm very proud
of these kinds of images.

1614
01:38:21,105 --> 01:38:22,631
I would call them epic images,

1615
01:38:22,731 --> 01:38:27,903
where the power of the sea,
the power of lightning,

1616
01:38:28,237 --> 01:38:30,681
the power of space,

1617
01:38:30,781 --> 01:38:35,202
the power of these elements,
these elemental forces

1618
01:38:35,578 --> 01:38:41,875
are about to overwhelm, or could they
be at the mercy of these two figures?

1619
01:38:42,251 --> 01:38:44,904
Or one of them, if one can overpower,

1620
01:38:45,004 --> 01:38:47,948
but clearly, with everything
that's been set up,

1621
01:38:48,048 --> 01:38:52,077
we always hoped that we might
put Thor, the man who has changed,

1622
01:38:52,177 --> 01:38:54,330
the man who,
at the beginning of this film,

1623
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:56,248
wouldn't have thought twice about this,

1624
01:38:56,348 --> 01:38:59,210
now decides
that it's actually a choice to make.

1625
01:38:59,310 --> 01:39:01,837
And Jotunheim, whatever it might be,

1626
01:39:01,937 --> 01:39:05,758
does not deserve the fate
that Loki has imposed upon it.

1627
01:39:05,858 --> 01:39:09,011
And so, this idea of potentially giving up

1628
01:39:09,111 --> 01:39:11,680
a route back to the place
where he found himself,

1629
01:39:11,780 --> 01:39:13,057
where he found happiness,

1630
01:39:13,157 --> 01:39:18,162
and where perhaps he may have found
or could find love,

1631
01:39:18,704 --> 01:39:23,108
is going to be sacrificed
in order to save Jotunheim

1632
01:39:23,208 --> 01:39:26,712
and the stability and peace
of the Nine Realms.

1633
01:39:28,797 --> 01:39:31,884
Let's see whether Jane forgives him.
One man who won't is Loki.

1634
01:39:33,636 --> 01:39:36,247
And the series of images that follow

1635
01:39:36,347 --> 01:39:39,416
really speak
for the sort of cataclysmic ending

1636
01:39:39,516 --> 01:39:43,228
to which we believed
a film like this could head.

1637
01:39:43,687 --> 01:39:45,422
Where this really is, I think,

1638
01:39:45,522 --> 01:39:49,343
a spectacular series
of visual effects moments

1639
01:39:49,443 --> 01:39:52,805
that were beautifully supervised

1640
01:39:52,905 --> 01:39:57,159
by the brilliant Wesley Sewell
and his team,

1641
01:39:58,118 --> 01:40:01,580
and where all of the
key members of the team,

1642
01:40:02,414 --> 01:40:05,109
Bo Welch in design,
Haris Zambarloukos in photography,

1643
01:40:05,209 --> 01:40:09,004
Wes in visual effects,
Paul Rubell in editing,

1644
01:40:09,588 --> 01:40:13,008
our stunt team,
Vic Armstrong and Andy,

1645
01:40:13,926 --> 01:40:15,995
the costumes of Alex Byrne,

1646
01:40:16,095 --> 01:40:19,498
the various make-ups
of all our characters

1647
01:40:19,598 --> 01:40:25,604
from Luisa Abel, Jan Alexander
in hair and make-up, quite magnificent.

1648
01:40:26,105 --> 01:40:31,010
And I love the look of Mr. Hiddleston
as he heads off into that void.

1649
01:40:31,110 --> 01:40:34,822
What is gonna happen?
There's a big question mark there.

1650
01:40:35,698 --> 01:40:39,743
And for us, the big question mark was,
how do we get back to Earth?

1651
01:40:58,971 --> 01:41:01,457
On this occasion,
we were filming this real shot,

1652
01:41:01,557 --> 01:41:03,959
took place on a real Friday afternoon
in New Mexico

1653
01:41:04,059 --> 01:41:05,179
when the sun was going down.

1654
01:41:05,269 --> 01:41:07,338
We got that real sunset. It was one of,

1655
01:41:07,438 --> 01:41:09,715
if you will please, please, please
forgive my language,

1656
01:41:09,815 --> 01:41:11,984
a sort of "kick, bollock
and scramble" moment,

1657
01:41:12,109 --> 01:41:15,387
where everybody is running
to shoot this moment

1658
01:41:15,487 --> 01:41:17,681
in what some refer to
as the "magic hour,"

1659
01:41:17,781 --> 01:41:20,434
and which we in film
know to be the "tragic hour,"

1660
01:41:20,534 --> 01:41:23,062
because you can never quite
get the shot as you want it.

1661
01:41:23,162 --> 01:41:25,814
Here the opposite was true.

1662
01:41:25,914 --> 01:41:28,734
These three actors rushed,
dragged them out of their trailers.

1663
01:41:28,834 --> 01:41:31,211
"You gotta go.
The light's going, the light's going."

1664
01:41:31,670 --> 01:41:34,573
And we were able to get
the reason we went to New Mexico,

1665
01:41:34,673 --> 01:41:39,787
a big sky, a sunset, mountains,
three amazing actors, a great image,

1666
01:41:39,887 --> 01:41:43,916
and one that would allow us,
as we see Jane's disappointment,

1667
01:41:44,016 --> 01:41:46,960
to perhaps begin the process
of taking us back up

1668
01:41:47,060 --> 01:41:51,173
to see how all of this
is resolved in Asgard.

1669
01:41:51,273 --> 01:41:53,425
Here, this time with the travel
we've done now,

1670
01:41:53,525 --> 01:41:55,969
allowing us to compress the journey,

1671
01:41:56,069 --> 01:42:02,785
but still enjoy feeling that miraculous
and strange underside of Asgard.

1672
01:42:03,327 --> 01:42:09,875
An Asgard, now in a kind of post-battle,
post-near-apocalypse twilight,

1673
01:42:10,834 --> 01:42:15,072
where a little hint of what happens
in the myths and in the comics,

1674
01:42:15,172 --> 01:42:18,909
which is, although not here,
in the halls of Valhalla,

1675
01:42:19,009 --> 01:42:21,787
they sing and they talk and they drink
and they dance,

1676
01:42:21,887 --> 01:42:25,833
and they celebrate their exploits,
particularly led by Volstagg,

1677
01:42:25,933 --> 01:42:28,435
who's prone to exaggeration, of course.

1678
01:42:29,478 --> 01:42:33,732
There's a kind of melancholy
that hangs over this at this point.

1679
01:42:34,817 --> 01:42:38,554
Thor has left Earth,
has sacrificed the Rainbow Bridge,

1680
01:42:38,654 --> 01:42:42,683
has saved the peace of Asgard,
has saved Jotunheim,

1681
01:42:42,783 --> 01:42:44,977
but of course, has lost a brother.

1682
01:42:45,077 --> 01:42:48,230
It wasn't as simple as saying
he was right and Loki was wrong.

1683
01:42:48,330 --> 01:42:50,482
It was as the film has tried to be,

1684
01:42:50,582 --> 01:42:52,735
because the comics are
and the myths are,

1685
01:42:52,835 --> 01:42:55,462
just a bit more complicated than that.

1686
01:42:57,214 --> 01:43:00,659
We find, of course,
as he walks the halls,

1687
01:43:00,759 --> 01:43:03,746
beyond which this magnificent

1688
01:43:03,846 --> 01:43:09,268
Scandinavian-influenced
landscape of Asgard sits,

1689
01:43:09,810 --> 01:43:12,838
a fine company called Whiskytree,
who produced the visual effects

1690
01:43:12,938 --> 01:43:15,774
for the creation of Asgard here,

1691
01:43:17,067 --> 01:43:20,679
we find that he goes back to,
what I mentioned earlier,

1692
01:43:20,779 --> 01:43:25,576
was really the base emotional heart
of the picture, fathers and sons.

1693
01:43:28,370 --> 01:43:30,542
And that was the question,
would he be at the beginning?

1694
01:43:30,622 --> 01:43:34,835
Odin says he will, but actually,
although he's in the affirmative,

1695
01:43:35,210 --> 01:43:37,946
Thor now has second thoughts.

1696
01:43:38,046 --> 01:43:42,201
This is a beautifully and simply done
scene between the two men.

1697
01:43:42,301 --> 01:43:44,094
It's about, in part,

1698
01:43:44,970 --> 01:43:49,875
the inability of certain kinds of males,
warrior males,

1699
01:43:49,975 --> 01:43:54,187
to easily reveal their feelings
to each other.

1700
01:43:54,813 --> 01:43:56,965
They do here with great delicacy

1701
01:43:57,065 --> 01:44:00,886
and with a sense of vulnerability
that I think is touching.

1702
01:44:00,986 --> 01:44:03,639
I think it's beautifully
and simply played by the pair of them,

1703
01:44:03,739 --> 01:44:06,600
and you feel the weight
of the experience of the film,

1704
01:44:06,700 --> 01:44:12,414
that they have bought this experience,
they've arrived here changed,

1705
01:44:13,498 --> 01:44:16,460
inspired in some ways,
saddened in some ways,

1706
01:44:17,002 --> 01:44:20,781
and now are ready to go on
with their lives.

1707
01:44:20,881 --> 01:44:23,216
But there's a big question mark.

1708
01:44:25,469 --> 01:44:28,247
Can the Rainbow Bridge be rebuilt?

1709
01:44:28,347 --> 01:44:30,307
Where is Jane Foster?

1710
01:44:32,225 --> 01:44:35,520
What will happen
to Asgard's relationship to Earth?

1711
01:44:37,189 --> 01:44:41,026
And the beginning of the up beat
at the end of our picture here

1712
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:45,806
is the understanding that
perhaps there could always be hope.

1713
01:44:45,906 --> 01:44:48,225
Heimdall says so, I listen to Heimdall.

1714
01:44:48,325 --> 01:44:51,103
Well, sure enough,
down in Smith's Motors in this shot,

1715
01:44:51,203 --> 01:44:54,398
which was a shot originally planned
to open the film with.

1716
01:44:54,498 --> 01:44:56,900
It was going to be
the very first shot of the movie,

1717
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:01,254
it turned into the very last, almost.

1718
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:18,855
And now, as we go through
these main-on-end titles,

1719
01:45:19,564 --> 01:45:22,818
I hope you'll enjoy
this race through space,

1720
01:45:24,444 --> 01:45:26,847
this voyage which originally was
in the body of the movie.

1721
01:45:26,947 --> 01:45:29,725
And it was the beginnings
of a travel from Earth

1722
01:45:29,825 --> 01:45:32,352
up through space
through various time warps here,

1723
01:45:32,452 --> 01:45:36,648
to this Milky Way-style galaxy
through which we pass,

1724
01:45:36,748 --> 01:45:39,818
and then pull out another part of.

1725
01:45:39,918 --> 01:45:44,698
And then understand that we are now,
in fact, travelling through, around

1726
01:45:44,798 --> 01:45:49,328
and between the branches of Yggdrasil,
the Worlds Tree,

1727
01:45:49,428 --> 01:45:52,122
the great galactic nebulae

1728
01:45:52,222 --> 01:45:54,917
that Odin describes
and the comics describe,

1729
01:45:55,017 --> 01:45:57,961
in both ancient art
and in scientific versions,

1730
01:45:58,061 --> 01:46:04,401
as the linking web, if you like, between
the Nine Realms of the universe.

1731
01:46:04,776 --> 01:46:08,847
And this opportunity to take the
audience on a journey through space

1732
01:46:08,947 --> 01:46:13,101
and through Yggdrasil
was something that we worked on

1733
01:46:13,201 --> 01:46:16,521
through the whole of the time
we were making the film.

1734
01:46:16,621 --> 01:46:21,902
Again, this part of the movie
was created by our visual effects team

1735
01:46:22,002 --> 01:46:27,966
and executed
and much enhanced by BUF in Paris.

1736
01:46:28,467 --> 01:46:31,662
And although it didn't make it
into the body of the film,

1737
01:46:31,762 --> 01:46:35,123
it was a fantastic way, I think,
to go out at the end of our Marvel movie

1738
01:46:35,223 --> 01:46:38,919
that has tried to give a sense of fun,
a sense of exhilaration,

1739
01:46:39,019 --> 01:46:41,546
has taken you, I hope,
on an emotional journey,

1740
01:46:41,646 --> 01:46:45,717
but is leaving you
with a sense of a forward movement,

1741
01:46:45,817 --> 01:46:48,387
with a sense of optimism

1742
01:46:48,487 --> 01:46:53,558
and with, perhaps, a sense that
if there are other movies of Thor,

1743
01:46:53,658 --> 01:46:56,369
or other movies in which Thor exists,

1744
01:46:56,995 --> 01:46:59,664
that you might want to come back
and see them.

1745
01:47:03,001 --> 01:47:04,403
My name is Ken Branagh,

1746
01:47:04,503 --> 01:47:07,239
and I thank you very much
for watching <i>Thor</i>.

1747
01:47:07,339 --> 01:47:08,573
I'm gonna leave you now

1748
01:47:08,673 --> 01:47:13,261
with the answer to the question
that some people asked me, which is,

1749
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:20,644
"How on Earth could you possibly
even start to direct a film like <i>Thor</i>?"

1750
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:26,299
Well, the answer is unfolding to you
and will do over the next seven minutes.

1751
01:47:26,399 --> 01:47:32,014
It is all of these people, that's how
anybody can do something like this,

1752
01:47:32,114 --> 01:47:35,575
but I was uniquely blessed
with the talent

1753
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:40,038
and the kindness of the people
with whom I worked.

1754
01:47:40,413 --> 01:47:45,085
You'll see thousands of names
across this next five or six minutes,

1755
01:47:45,919 --> 01:47:48,113
all of them truly did have
a contribution to make,

1756
01:47:48,213 --> 01:47:50,093
and over two or three years
of making one of these pictures,

1757
01:47:50,173 --> 01:47:51,908
it's something you understand
and appreciate

1758
01:47:52,008 --> 01:47:53,618
and are deeply grateful for.

1759
01:47:53,718 --> 01:47:58,749
So, on behalf of all of these, my fellows,
my fellow collaborators, my co-workers,

1760
01:47:58,849 --> 01:48:01,877
once again, thank you very much
for watching <i>Thor,</i>

1761
01:48:01,977 --> 01:48:05,564
thank you for listening
to this commentary and goodbye.

1762
01:48:08,108 --> 01:48:12,070
Please, however, do enjoy
listening to the amazing Foo Fighters,

1763
01:48:13,155 --> 01:48:16,808
who are singing
and performing this song <i>Walk</i>

1764
01:48:16,908 --> 01:48:19,853
from their latest chart-topping album.

1765
01:48:19,953 --> 01:48:23,148
And what an honour it was to have them
associated with the movie

1766
01:48:23,248 --> 01:48:24,961
with a lyric they might have
written for us.

1767
01:48:25,041 --> 01:48:28,570
So, to all of them,
thank you very much, indeed,

1768
01:48:28,670 --> 01:48:29,946
and if you'd like,

1769
01:48:30,046 --> 01:48:32,532
you might want to join me
just right at the end of the credits

1770
01:48:32,632 --> 01:48:35,410
in case there's
some kind of surprise there.

1771
01:48:35,510 --> 01:48:37,304
I'll see you there.

1772
01:53:06,573 --> 01:53:11,870
And so, that's the end of the film,
the end of another Marvel movie,

1773
01:53:12,495 --> 01:53:16,499
the end of <i>Thor,</i> the God of Thunder.

1774
01:53:19,377 --> 01:53:21,780
Thor will, indeed, return
in <i>The Avengers,</i>

1775
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:24,949
and he will be directed
by Joss Whedon,

1776
01:53:25,049 --> 01:53:27,911
a brilliant talent who I spoke to

1777
01:53:28,011 --> 01:53:32,248
before he came on board
to do this little piece,

1778
01:53:32,348 --> 01:53:35,960
which I'm very delighted
ends up at the end of our film,

1779
01:53:36,060 --> 01:53:38,688
in which I was especially pleased

1780
01:53:39,439 --> 01:53:42,592
to see the continuing appearance
of Dr. Erik Selvig,

1781
01:53:42,692 --> 01:53:49,073
this time talking to the great
Sam Jackson as Nick Fury.

1782
01:53:50,241 --> 01:53:53,728
And I find myself intrigued
by exactly where they are

1783
01:53:53,828 --> 01:53:56,915
and exactly what they are to discuss.

1784
01:53:57,582 --> 01:54:01,194
What I can tell you
is that what you're about to see

1785
01:54:01,294 --> 01:54:05,340
has some reference
back into the movie <i>Thor</i>.

1786
01:54:06,299 --> 01:54:12,972
Have a look at what comes up inside
the suitcase that Sam Jackson refers to,

1787
01:54:13,848 --> 01:54:17,936
and see whether it jogs your memory
about a moment in our picture

1788
01:54:18,853 --> 01:54:21,231
that may have referred to it.

1789
01:54:26,277 --> 01:54:27,779
Loki's back.

1790
01:54:28,363 --> 01:54:31,641
As director of <i>Thor</i>
and as a keen fan of Marvel movies,

1791
01:54:31,741 --> 01:54:35,119
I've learned maybe not to believe
everything I see.

1792
01:54:36,120 --> 01:54:37,914
Thanks for watching.
