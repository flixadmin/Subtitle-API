DAENERYS: When I was a child,

2
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,782
my brother would tell me
a bedtime story...

3
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:06,040
about the man
who murdered our father.

4
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:11,045
Who stabbed him in the back
and cut his throat.

5
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,044
Who sat down on the Iron Throne
and watched

6
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,672
as his blood poured onto the floor.

7
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,928
He told me other stories as well.

8
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:24,221
About all the things
we would do to that man...

9
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,722
once we took back the Seven Kingdoms
and had him in our grasp.

10
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:34,190
Your sister pledged
to send her army north.

11
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,315
She did.

12
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,692
I don't see an army.

13
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:41,322
I see one man, with one hand.

14
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,073
It appears your sister lied to me.

15
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,907
She lied to me as well.

16
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,583
She never had any intention
of sending her army north.

17
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:57,466
She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet
and 20,000 fresh troops.

18
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,963
The Golden Company from Essos,
bought and paid for.

19
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,969
Even if we defeat the dead,

20
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,037
she'll have more than enough
to destroy the survivors.

21

"We"?

22
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:12,023
I promised to fight for the living.
I intend to keep that promise.

23
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,800
- Your Grace, I know my brother...
- Like you knew your sister?

24
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,943
He came here alone, knowing full well
how he'd be received.

25
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,246
Why would he do that
if he weren't telling the truth?

26
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,370
Perhaps he trusts his little brother
to defend him,

27
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,747
right up to the moment
he slits my throat.

28
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,830
SANSA: You're right.
We can't trust him.

29
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,879
He attacked my father in the streets.

30
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:42,462
He tried to destroy my house and
my family, the same as he did yours.

31

JAIME: Do you want me to apologize?

32
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,677
I won't.

33
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,054
We were at war.

34
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,558
Everything I did,
I did for my house and my family.

35
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,725
I'd do it all again.

37
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,557
DAENERYS: So why have you abandoned
your house and family now?

38
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,117
JAIME: Because this goes
beyond loyalty.

39
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,202
This is about survival.

BRIENNE: You don't know me well,
Your Grace.

41
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,719
But I know Ser Jaime.

42
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,425
He is a man of honor.

43
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,554
I was his captor once.

44
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,139
But when we were both taken prisoner
and the men holding us

45
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,647
tried to force themselves on me,
Ser Jaime defended me.

46
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,355
And lost his hand because of it.

47
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:49,617
Without him, my lady,
you would not be alive.

48
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,411
He armed me, armored me,

49
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,369
and sent me to find you
and bring you home

50
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,375
because he'd sworn an oath
to your mother.

51
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,879
You vouch for him?

52
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:09,925
BRIENNE: I do.

53
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,806
You would fight beside him?

54
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,811
I would.

55
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,109
I trust you with my life.

56
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:33,410
If you trust him with yours,
we should let him stay.

I always pictured myself
dying in my own bed,

the age of 80,

167

with a belly full of wine and

- a girl's mouth around my cock.

At least Cersei
won't get to murder me.

I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction
denying her that pleasure

He was never anything but decent
towards me.

I didn't ask him to be my Hand
simply because he was good.

247

I asked him to be my Hand
because he was good, and intelligent

and ruthless when he had to be.

249

He never should have trusted Cersei.

We have other things in common.

We've both known what it means
to lead people

to accept a woman's rule.

00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:19,539
I charge you to defend the innocent.

646
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,796
Arise, Brienne of Tarth...

647
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,637

JORAH: We have all we need
to win this war.

LADY MORMONT: I have trained my men,
women and children.

653
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,471
I have fought before.
I can fight again.

654
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,766
JORAH: Please, listen to me.
You're the future of our house.

655
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:19,219
LADY MORMONT: I don't need you
to remind me of that.

656
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,792
JORAH: You'll be safer in the crypt.
These things we're fighting...

657
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,398
I will not hide underground.

658
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:26,818
I pledged to fight for the North,
and I will fight.

659
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,590
MAN 1: I'm meant to relieve you.
You got it?

660
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,446
MAN 2: Yeah, I got it.

661
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,905
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

662
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,076
It's all right.

663
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:38,705
We're done here.

664
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,584
I wish you good fortune, cousin.

665
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:49,883
Thank you, my lady.

666
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:52,969
- My lady.
- SOLDIER: My lady.

667
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,470
What have you got there?

668
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:01,512
It's called Heartsbane.

669
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:04,894
It's my family sword.

670
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:06,646
You still have a family.

671
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,566
Yes. And I'd love
to defend them with it.

672
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,445
But I can't really hold it upright.

673
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:20,452
Your father,
he taught me how to be a man.

674
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,200
How to do what's right.

675
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,912
This is right.

676
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,335
It's Valyrian steel.

677
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,637
I'd be honored if you'd take it.

678
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:51,812
I'll wield it in his memory...

679
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,030
to guard the realms of men.

680
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:02,914
I'll see you when it's through.

681
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:16,594
I hope we win.

682
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,689
- We'd better get some rest.
- No, let's stay a bit longer.

683
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:30,062
We're out of wine.

684
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,774
How about a song?

685
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:40,990
One of you must know one.

686
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,827
- Ser Davos?
- You'll pray for a quick death.

TYRION: Ser Brienne?

689
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:58,595
- Mmm-hmm.
- Hmm.

Lyanna Stark.

703
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:17,108
My brother Rhaegar...

704
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:24,241
everyone told me
he was decent and kind.

705
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,567
He liked to sing.

706
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:28,870
Gave money to poor children.

707
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:33,041
And he raped her.

708
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:36,161
JON: He didn't.

709
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,217
He loved her.

710
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:50,058
They were married in secret.

711
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:54,346
After Rhaegar fell on the Trident,
she had a son.

712
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:59,067
Robert would have murdered the baby
if he ever found out,

713
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:00,234
and Lyanna knew it.

as she bled to death
on her birthing bed

716

was give the boy to her brother...

Bran.

- He saw it.
- He saw it?

728
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,354
And Samwell confirmed it.

729
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,398
He read about their marriage
at the Citadel

730

It's true, Dany.

00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,129
I know it is.

736

If it were true,

737
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:17,062
it would make you the last male heir
of House Targaryen.

738
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,102
You'd have a claim to the Iron Throne.
