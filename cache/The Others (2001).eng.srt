1
00:00:33,839 --> 00:00:36,639
Now, children,
are you sitting comfortably?

2
00:00:38,233 --> 00:00:39,513
Then I'll begin.

3
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:44,409
This story stared
many thousands of years ago...

4
00:00:44,661 --> 00:00:47,194
But it was all over
in just seven days.

5
00:00:47,928 --> 00:00:49,994
All that long, long time ago...

6
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:52,239
None of the things
we can see now...

7
00:00:52,241 --> 00:00:54,974
The sun, the moon,
the stars, the earth...

8
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:58,344
The animals and plants...
Not a single one existed.

9
00:00:59,022 --> 00:01:00,542
Only god existed...

10
00:01:01,035 --> 00:01:03,568
And so only he
could have created them.

11
00:01:03,795 --> 00:01:04,888
And he did.

12
00:03:15,146 --> 00:03:17,433
Simpson.
What a character he was.

13
00:03:18,214 --> 00:03:20,146
I wonder whatever became of him?

14
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:22,607
I imagine he's dead
like all the rest.

15
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,713
Those were the days.

16
00:03:34,795 --> 00:03:36,515
Mr. Tuttle, your hair.

17
00:03:44,742 --> 00:03:45,742
Yes?

18
00:03:45,762 --> 00:03:47,055
Good morning, ma'am.

19
00:03:48,037 --> 00:03:50,603
- We've come about the...
- Oh, yes, of course.

20
00:03:52,824 --> 00:03:53,824
Come in.

21
00:03:55,817 --> 00:03:57,790
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

22
00:04:05,718 --> 00:04:06,718
You are...?

23
00:04:07,298 --> 00:04:08,936
I'm Bertha Mills, ma'am.

24
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:10,924
And this is Edmund Tuttle.

25
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:12,756
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

26
00:04:12,871 --> 00:04:14,256
You must be the gardener.

27
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:16,696
That's right. The gardener.

28
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:20,145
And this young lady is called Lydia.

29
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:23,565
Have you had much
experience in service?

30
00:04:23,727 --> 00:04:26,245
Don't let that angel face
fool you, ma'am.

31
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,620
She's older than she looks.

32
00:04:29,293 --> 00:04:30,413
Can you iron?

33
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,300
What's the matter?
Has the cat got your tongue?

34
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,559
She can't talk, ma'am.

35
00:04:39,621 --> 00:04:41,534
The poor little mite's a mute.

36
00:04:42,594 --> 00:04:45,400
But she's a good little worker.
I can promise you that.

37
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:47,467
All right.

38
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:50,900
All right. The other girl
I had spoke too much, anyway.

39
00:04:50,902 --> 00:04:53,407
Follow me.
Mrs. Mills, you and the girl,

40
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,955
you will sleep in the attic room
at the top of the stairs.

41
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,268
And you, Mr...

42
00:04:58,623 --> 00:05:00,322
- Tuttle, ma'am.
- Tuttle...

43
00:05:00,895 --> 00:05:03,815
You could sleep in the shed
around the back.

44
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,629
As you can see, the housework
has been rather neglected...

45
00:05:07,632 --> 00:05:10,069
since the servants disappeared
almost a week ago.

46
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:12,169
You mean they just vanished?

47
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:13,709
Into thin air.

48
00:05:14,717 --> 00:05:17,237
No notice, nothing. They didn't
even collect their wages.

49
00:05:17,257 --> 00:05:19,810
They... They just left us.

50
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,037
What a strange thing to do.

51
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,617
You'll soon find out
there are times...

52
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,884
when this house is not
exactly an ideal home.

53
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,931
Hence my advertisement
in the newspaper...

54
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:32,618
requesting honest,
hard-working people.

55
00:05:33,545 --> 00:05:36,151
Well, there's nobody more
honest or hard-working than us.

56
00:05:36,154 --> 00:05:37,618
Isn't that right, Mr. Tuttle?

57
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,438
Oh, aye, we're very honest.

58
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,458
And... very hard-working.

59
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:46,932
The kitchen.

60
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:49,959
I have breakfast at 8.00...

61
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,067
The children at 9.00.

62
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:55,445
Lunch will be served at 1.00
and dinner at 7.30.

63
00:05:55,613 --> 00:05:57,073
And the master, ma'am?

64
00:06:00,307 --> 00:06:02,220
The master went off to war...

65
00:06:03,148 --> 00:06:04,508
A year and a half ago.

66
00:06:05,461 --> 00:06:07,508
I've had no news
since the war ended.

67
00:06:08,988 --> 00:06:10,455
Which of you does the cooking?

68
00:06:10,588 --> 00:06:11,923
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

69
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:14,530
Which of you does the cooking?

70
00:06:15,002 --> 00:06:16,536
You'll notice what I'm doing.

71
00:06:17,296 --> 00:06:18,416
In this house,

72
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:22,738
no door must be opened without
the previous one being closed first.

73
00:06:22,741 --> 00:06:24,776
It is vital that you remember this.

74
00:06:25,288 --> 00:06:27,115
It's not as easy as it may seem.

75
00:06:27,362 --> 00:06:30,459
There are 15 different keys
for all of the 50 doors,

76
00:06:30,462 --> 00:06:32,921
depending on which area of
the house you're in at the time.

77
00:06:34,076 --> 00:06:36,528
Mrs. Mills, from tomorrow onwards

78
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:38,517
I will be leaving
a set of keys in your charge.

79
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:40,417
Yes, ma'am.

80
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:42,338
The music room.

81
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:44,710
That old piano was already here
when we moved in.

82
00:06:44,744 --> 00:06:47,684
Please do not let
the children thump away on it.

83
00:06:49,091 --> 00:06:50,431
It sets off my migraine.

84
00:06:50,798 --> 00:06:54,638
Silence is something that we
prize very highly in this house.

85
00:06:55,652 --> 00:06:58,191
That is why you will not find
a telephone, a radio...

86
00:06:58,194 --> 00:06:59,918
or anything else
that makes a racket.

87
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,778
Oh, we don't have
electricity, either.

88
00:07:02,986 --> 00:07:05,058
During the war,
the Germans kept cutting it off,

89
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:07,820
so we just learned to live
without it. Let's continue.

90
00:07:07,846 --> 00:07:10,547
Ma'am, there's no need
to show us the whole house.

91
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,550
Yes!

92
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,480
Yes, there is.

93
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:17,366
Because here, most of the time,
you can hardly see your way.

94
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:19,437
It's often difficult to
make out if there is a table,

95
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,776
a chair, a door, a sideboard...

96
00:07:23,513 --> 00:07:26,070
Or one of my children
playing hide and seek.

97
00:07:26,995 --> 00:07:28,561
What do you mean, ma'am?

98
00:07:30,481 --> 00:07:32,481
Perhaps I should introduce you
to the children.

99
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,905
Mr. Tuttle,
you can see to the garden now.

100
00:07:40,908 --> 00:07:43,091
- You'll find tools in the shed.
- Yes, ma'am.

101
00:07:44,003 --> 00:07:46,111
You two can start closing the curtains.

102
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:47,869
All of them.

103
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:19,299
Come.

104
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,653
I'll wake them. You wait here.

105
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,513
Whatever you do,
don't open the curtains.

106
00:08:39,827 --> 00:08:41,214
Wackey, wackey.

107
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:46,021
Now, come on.

108
00:08:47,047 --> 00:08:48,914
Eyes closed, hands together.

109
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,462
Let it be, at light of day...

110
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,622
Jesus, to whom now I pray.

111
00:08:54,922 --> 00:08:57,008
Blessed be the virgin pure...

112
00:08:57,011 --> 00:08:59,255
Whom I greet with faith too short.

113
00:08:59,258 --> 00:09:01,561
Jesus, Mary, spotless rose...

114
00:09:01,564 --> 00:09:03,790
Keep us till this day doth close.

115
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:11,896
They're still half asleep.

116
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,477
What sweet little children.

117
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:18,803
Well... What do you say?

118
00:09:19,884 --> 00:09:21,084
How do you do?

119
00:09:22,163 --> 00:09:23,363
How do you do?

120
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,924
How do you do, children?

121
00:09:26,918 --> 00:09:28,747
My name is Mrs. Mills, but...

122
00:09:29,014 --> 00:09:31,534
you can call me Bertha if you like.

123
00:09:31,998 --> 00:09:33,434
What are your names?

124
00:09:33,918 --> 00:09:35,891
- Anne.
- Nicholas.

125
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,711
Anne and Nicholas.

126
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,591
What pretty names.

127
00:09:40,939 --> 00:09:42,821
Are you going to be
our new nanny?

128
00:09:47,112 --> 00:09:50,156
Yes, my dears.
I'm your new nanny.

129
00:09:50,346 --> 00:09:51,866
It's time for their breakfast.

130
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:54,405
Lydia, go to the kitchen
and close every shutter.

131
00:10:01,714 --> 00:10:03,834
The doctors were never able
to find a cure.

132
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:05,188
For what?

133
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:07,494
Their condition.

134
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,801
The children have
a very serious allergy to light.

135
00:10:12,882 --> 00:10:15,186
They are photosensitive
and must never be exposed...

136
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:17,220
to any light
much stronger than this.

137
00:10:18,462 --> 00:10:19,942
Otherwise,
in a matter of minutes...

138
00:10:19,945 --> 00:10:22,102
they will break out
in sores and blisters and...

139
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,628
and begin to suffocate.

140
00:10:25,043 --> 00:10:26,688
It would eventually be fatal.

141
00:10:26,796 --> 00:10:27,954
Good heavens.

142
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,823
I don't like this toast.

143
00:10:32,393 --> 00:10:33,393
Why not?

144
00:10:33,643 --> 00:10:35,130
It tastes funny.

145
00:10:35,757 --> 00:10:37,364
I liked it better before.

146
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:41,297
That's because before,
somebody else made it.

147
00:10:42,331 --> 00:10:44,151
When are they coming back?

148
00:10:46,531 --> 00:10:48,210
They're not coming back, child.

149
00:10:48,758 --> 00:10:50,038
Just like daddy.

150
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:53,312
Daddy is coming back, though.

151
00:10:54,058 --> 00:10:57,718
Mrs. Mills, our father's fighting
in a war in France, you know.

152
00:10:57,735 --> 00:11:01,028
- It's the world war.
- I know, but he's in France.

153
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:04,339
That's enough, chatterboxes.
Finish up your breakfasts.

154
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:07,233
Are you going to leave us, too?

155
00:11:09,646 --> 00:11:10,846
Of course not!

156
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,526
Why should I leave you?

157
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:16,239
The others said they wouldn't,

158
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:18,480
but they did,
and then it happened.

159
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,453
Be quiet!

160
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,133
What do you mean, Anne?
What happened?

161
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:29,021
Mummy went...

162
00:11:30,143 --> 00:11:31,143
mad.

163
00:11:31,335 --> 00:11:33,958
- Nothing happened.
- Yes, it did.

164
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:36,025
- No, it didn't!
- Yes, it did!

165
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,028
Be quiet.

166
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:40,956
What's going on?

167
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,783
I want those plates empty
in less than a minute.

168
00:11:43,785 --> 00:11:44,931
Is that clear?

169
00:11:48,777 --> 00:11:50,683
Mrs. Mills, would you
come outside a moment?

170
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,583
I'd like a word with you.

171
00:11:54,817 --> 00:11:55,817
Yes, ma'am.

172
00:12:00,364 --> 00:12:02,678
The postman usually
comes every Wednesday.

173
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:06,844
But I just checked the letter-box
and this week he hasn't.

174
00:12:08,498 --> 00:12:10,151
I'm afraid
I don't follow, ma'am.

175
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:11,971
This letter should have been collected...

176
00:12:11,974 --> 00:12:14,151
And delivered to
the newspaper five days ago.

177
00:12:14,486 --> 00:12:17,249
It's an advertisement for servants.
Since it was never published,

178
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:19,469
would you mind explaining to me
what you're doing here?

179
00:12:20,325 --> 00:12:21,685
Oh, I understand.

180
00:12:23,099 --> 00:12:25,819
Ma'am, that's exactly what
I was going to say to you...

181
00:12:25,822 --> 00:12:27,485
when you opened the door to us.

182
00:12:27,807 --> 00:12:31,606
The truth is that we just come by
on the off chance.

183
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,166
You know a big house like this...

184
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:36,900
is always in need of someone
who knows the ropes.

185
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,226
You mean you've served in
a house like this one before?

186
00:12:39,707 --> 00:12:41,940
This may come as a surprise
to you, ma'am, but...

187
00:12:43,774 --> 00:12:45,787
We, in fact, used to work here.

188
00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:48,635
Here?

189
00:12:48,638 --> 00:12:51,555
Oh, now, 'twas a few years ago.

190
00:12:53,442 --> 00:12:55,535
If you don't mind my saying so, ma'am...

191
00:12:56,702 --> 00:12:58,642
They were the best years of my life.

192
00:13:00,263 --> 00:13:02,409
That's why we come by,
because this house...

193
00:13:03,396 --> 00:13:04,876
Means a lot to us.

194
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,483
Perhaps I'd best show you
our references, ma'am.

195
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:10,989
No, no, no. Don't bother.
There's no need.

196
00:13:11,317 --> 00:13:13,208
So you say you know the house well?

197
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,450
Like the back of my hand.

198
00:13:16,051 --> 00:13:18,930
Well, that is assuming the walls
haven't sprouted legs...

199
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:20,836
and moved in the meantime.

200
00:13:21,264 --> 00:13:23,417
The only thing that moves
here is the light.

201
00:13:27,091 --> 00:13:28,745
But it changes everything.

202
00:13:33,786 --> 00:13:35,972
It's rather difficult,
to say the least.

203
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:39,072
One might almost say...

204
00:13:40,073 --> 00:13:41,092
unbearable.

205
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:46,806
The only way of enduring it
is by keeping a cool head.

206
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,259
Oh, yes, ma'am.

207
00:13:49,893 --> 00:13:51,573
I don't like fantasies.

208
00:13:52,534 --> 00:13:54,259
Strange ideas.
Do you know what I mean?

209
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,593
I think so, ma'am.

210
00:13:57,596 --> 00:14:00,373
My children sometimes have strange ideas.

211
00:14:02,627 --> 00:14:04,627
But you mustn't pay
any attention to them.

212
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,034
Children will be children.

213
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,128
Yes, of course, ma'am.

214
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:11,921
All right...

215
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:15,315
You can stay.

216
00:14:16,975 --> 00:14:18,702
Thank you very much, ma'am.

217
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,170
It did happen.

218
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:45,268
"The roman governor
tried to make them..."

219
00:14:45,271 --> 00:14:47,077
"change their minds afterwards..."

220
00:14:47,297 --> 00:14:49,763
"To make them change their minds."
Full stop.

221
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:51,983
- "Afterwards..."
- Mm-hm.

222
00:14:52,404 --> 00:14:54,081
"He ordered them to be beaten."

223
00:14:54,091 --> 00:14:57,551
"But Justus and pastor,
far from being afraid,"

224
00:14:57,726 --> 00:15:00,772
"rejoiced and showed themselves
willing to die for Christ."

225
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:02,398
"When he saw this..."

226
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:04,205
"The roman governor
was filled with rage..."

227
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,225
"And ordered their heads
to be cut off."

228
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:12,813
What do you find so amusing?

229
00:15:15,361 --> 00:15:16,361
Well...

230
00:15:16,894 --> 00:15:18,047
"Well", what?

231
00:15:18,447 --> 00:15:20,694
Those children were really stupid.

232
00:15:21,781 --> 00:15:23,154
- Why?
- Because...

233
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,135
they said they only
believed in Jesus...

234
00:15:25,138 --> 00:15:26,868
and then they got killed for it.

235
00:15:27,902 --> 00:15:29,896
And what would you have done,
deny Christ?

236
00:15:30,102 --> 00:15:31,196
Well, yes.

237
00:15:31,695 --> 00:15:33,654
Inside I would have
believed in him...

238
00:15:33,863 --> 00:15:36,165
But I wouldn't have told
the Romans that.

239
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:40,762
Is that what you think, too,
Nicholas?

240
00:15:44,957 --> 00:15:45,957
I see.

241
00:15:47,577 --> 00:15:50,937
So you would have lied
to the point of denying Christ.

242
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,470
You'd have saved your heads being
chopped off by the Romans, that's true.

243
00:15:55,297 --> 00:15:56,956
But what would have
happened afterwards?

244
00:15:57,435 --> 00:15:58,435
When?

245
00:15:58,884 --> 00:16:00,124
In the next life.

246
00:16:00,884 --> 00:16:03,060
The one waiting for us after we die.

247
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,491
Where would you have gone?

248
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:07,518
Where, Nicholas?

249
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:09,357
To the children's limbo.

250
00:16:09,423 --> 00:16:11,203
What is the children's limbo, Anne?

251
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,130
One of the four hells.

252
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,272
Which are?

253
00:16:18,258 --> 00:16:19,804
Me, me, me! Me!

254
00:16:19,807 --> 00:16:22,132
No, no, no, no. Let him answer.
Which are?

255
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,213
There's the hell
where the damned go...

256
00:16:25,936 --> 00:16:28,210
- Then there's purgatory...
- Yes.

257
00:16:28,213 --> 00:16:30,213
...and the bosom of Abraham
where the just go...

258
00:16:30,216 --> 00:16:31,840
And limbo where children go.

259
00:16:31,843 --> 00:16:33,253
At the center of the earth.

260
00:16:33,721 --> 00:16:35,454
Where it's very, very hot.

261
00:16:36,566 --> 00:16:38,206
That's where children
go who tell lies...

262
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:40,206
but they don't just go
there for a few days.

263
00:16:40,347 --> 00:16:41,347
Oh, no.

264
00:16:41,988 --> 00:16:43,547
No, they're damned.

265
00:16:44,395 --> 00:16:45,395
Forever.

266
00:16:46,169 --> 00:16:47,369
Think about it.

267
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:50,482
Try to imagine...

268
00:16:51,863 --> 00:16:53,195
the end of eternity.

269
00:16:53,955 --> 00:16:55,161
Close your eyes.

270
00:16:56,123 --> 00:16:58,414
Close your eyes and try to imagine it.

271
00:16:59,882 --> 00:17:00,882
Forever.

272
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:04,129
Pain...

273
00:17:05,371 --> 00:17:06,376
forever.

274
00:17:07,897 --> 00:17:09,033
I'm getting dizzy.

275
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:15,215
Now do you understand why
Justus and pastor told the truth?

276
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:20,491
All right.

277
00:17:22,397 --> 00:17:24,702
Open your readers at lesson six.

278
00:17:24,705 --> 00:17:27,471
- Can't we play?
- You most certainly cannot.

279
00:17:27,474 --> 00:17:29,038
First you're going
to read the lesson...

280
00:17:29,138 --> 00:17:31,471
and then you're going to learn it...
by heart.

281
00:17:31,777 --> 00:17:32,803
All of it?

282
00:17:32,806 --> 00:17:35,764
Any more protests and there'll
be no playing for you at all today.

283
00:17:36,626 --> 00:17:40,085
In fact, I think you can
study in separate rooms.

284
00:17:40,152 --> 00:17:42,785
- No, no, no!
- Yes, yes, yes!

285
00:17:42,932 --> 00:17:44,665
But we get scared
if we're separated!

286
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:47,746
You get scared? As if you
weren't used to this house by now.

287
00:17:47,913 --> 00:17:49,747
What if we see a ghost?

288
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:52,893
Has your sister been telling you
one of her stories?

289
00:17:52,896 --> 00:17:54,520
I haven't told him anything!

290
00:17:54,523 --> 00:17:57,582
Well, if you see a ghost, you say
"hello" and you continue on studying.

291
00:17:57,585 --> 00:17:59,969
- Anne, come with me to the music room.
- Why me?

292
00:17:59,972 --> 00:18:02,126
Because I say so!
Now come on.

293
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:03,386
Take your book.

294
00:18:04,047 --> 00:18:06,740
Nicholas, I want to see that
lesson learned in less than an hour.

295
00:18:07,556 --> 00:18:09,427
- Mummy...
- What?

296
00:18:10,661 --> 00:18:11,703
Give me a kiss.

297
00:18:11,706 --> 00:18:14,049
"Give me a kiss.
Give me a kiss."

298
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,702
- "Give me a kiss."
- Anne, wait for me outside.

299
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:18,802
You know I can't.

300
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:21,890
Over there.

301
00:18:24,556 --> 00:18:27,636
Mrs. Mills, close all the curtains.

302
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:30,635
My daughter is going
to cross the living room.

303
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,250
Yes, ma'am.

304
00:18:40,156 --> 00:18:41,211
All right, Anne.

305
00:18:44,412 --> 00:18:45,412
Darling...

306
00:18:47,498 --> 00:18:50,761
Mummy can't be with you
all the time, hm?

307
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:54,665
You must learn to be on your own.

308
00:18:57,493 --> 00:18:58,832
Where's your rosary?

309
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:04,886
Whenever you feel afraid...

310
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:08,771
I want you to squeeze it
with all your might...

311
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:11,820
and say an "Our father",
and your fear will go away.

312
00:19:12,314 --> 00:19:15,400
- It won't.
- Yes, it will. Honestly.

313
00:19:17,047 --> 00:19:19,674
Don't you see that when you do that...
The Lord is with you?

314
00:19:21,768 --> 00:19:23,675
There's no reason to be afraid.

315
00:20:03,371 --> 00:20:05,164
"The house and the family."

316
00:20:06,051 --> 00:20:08,544
"We all live in a house
with our family."

317
00:20:09,152 --> 00:20:12,079
"The family is usually
made up of parents,"

318
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:14,658
"children, and their grandparents."

319
00:20:14,939 --> 00:20:16,645
"We must be obedient..."

320
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:20,043
"... and kind towards other
members of our family..."

321
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:22,806
"And we must never argue or fight..."

322
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:24,473
"with our brothers and sisters."

323
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,346
Do you have any children?

324
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,440
No.

325
00:20:29,072 --> 00:20:32,619
Mr. Tuttle and the girl, Lydia,
are all I've got and...

326
00:20:33,168 --> 00:20:34,646
I'm all they've got.

327
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:35,987
Was she born like that?

328
00:20:37,648 --> 00:20:38,974
Beg your pardon, ma'am?

329
00:20:39,334 --> 00:20:41,940
The girl.
Was she born a mute?

330
00:20:43,282 --> 00:20:44,282
No.

331
00:20:46,368 --> 00:20:48,553
You know,
I think I've finished here, ma'am.

332
00:20:48,575 --> 00:20:52,628
If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go
and see if Mr. Tuttle needs a hand.

333
00:21:23,624 --> 00:21:24,624
Nicholas!

334
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,292
Nicholas, I'm coming!

335
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:40,683
- Nicholas?
- What's the matter?

336
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:41,812
Why were you crying?

337
00:21:41,815 --> 00:21:43,815
I wasn't crying. I was reading.

338
00:21:44,714 --> 00:21:47,327
But I just heard you... Anne!

339
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:56,708
Anne!

340
00:21:58,975 --> 00:21:59,975
Anne?

341
00:22:00,621 --> 00:22:02,381
I haven't learned it yet, mummy.

342
00:22:03,174 --> 00:22:05,201
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

343
00:22:06,456 --> 00:22:08,795
- Why were you crying?
- I wasn't crying.

344
00:22:09,709 --> 00:22:11,709
I just heard you a moment ago.

345
00:22:13,356 --> 00:22:15,115
There's no need
to feel ashamed, darling.

346
00:22:15,349 --> 00:22:16,422
I don't.

347
00:22:16,783 --> 00:22:18,862
If I'd been crying, I'd tell you.

348
00:22:19,017 --> 00:22:20,943
Oh, really.
So I imagined it, did I?

349
00:22:21,337 --> 00:22:23,056
No. It was that boy.

350
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,110
What boy?

351
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,300
Victor.

352
00:22:28,443 --> 00:22:29,483
Who's Victor?

353
00:22:30,757 --> 00:22:32,663
The boy that was here
a moment ago.

354
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,888
I told him to let me study...

355
00:22:34,964 --> 00:22:36,777
but he wouldn't stop crying.

356
00:22:36,837 --> 00:22:39,097
I think he's a spoiled brat.

357
00:22:39,197 --> 00:22:41,256
He said we'd have
to leave the house.

358
00:22:41,898 --> 00:22:44,950
Did he now?
And why was he crying?

359
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:48,031
Because he doesn't like this house
but he has to live here.

360
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,489
- His father's a pianist...
- His father's a pianist, is he?

361
00:22:51,491 --> 00:22:52,491
Yes.

362
00:22:52,606 --> 00:22:55,652
And I already told him he's not
allowed to touch the piano.

363
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,152
He isn't, is he, mummy?

364
00:22:58,632 --> 00:23:00,633
So, you've spoken
to his father as well?

365
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,653
No, only with Victor.

366
00:23:02,686 --> 00:23:04,466
His father's with the others
in the hall.

367
00:23:04,469 --> 00:23:06,810
I've just come from the hall.
There's no one there.

368
00:23:08,699 --> 00:23:10,132
They must've gone upstairs.

369
00:23:10,134 --> 00:23:12,373
- They're viewing the house.
- That'll do, Anne!

370
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:13,825
That's enough!

371
00:23:15,474 --> 00:23:17,853
- Now why were you crying?
- It was Victor!

372
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:20,202
- So where is he now?
- He went out through there!

373
00:23:20,205 --> 00:23:21,536
Would you mind telling me...

374
00:23:21,544 --> 00:23:24,810
how a boy can get in and
out of this room if it's locked?

375
00:23:29,516 --> 00:23:31,662
I thought I made myself quite clear.

376
00:23:32,682 --> 00:23:36,026
No door is to be opened without
the previous one being closed first.

377
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:37,981
Is that so hard to understand?

378
00:23:38,689 --> 00:23:40,322
This house is like a ship.

379
00:23:40,325 --> 00:23:42,403
The light must be contained
as if it were water...

380
00:23:42,406 --> 00:23:44,712
by opening and closing the doors.

381
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:48,490
- My children's lives are at stake!
- But, ma'am, I...

382
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:50,223
Do not argue with me!
Be quiet!

383
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,408
Which was the last of you
to enter that room?

384
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:55,791
Lydia?

385
00:23:58,344 --> 00:24:01,071
She hasn't got a key.
I already told you that.

386
00:24:01,084 --> 00:24:02,524
Well, that leaves you, then.

387
00:24:02,527 --> 00:24:04,451
But I was in the hall
the whole time.

388
00:24:04,691 --> 00:24:06,121
And then I went out
into the garden.

389
00:24:06,124 --> 00:24:07,402
You saw me with your own eyes.

390
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:09,413
I hope you are not suggesting
that it was me!

391
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,040
Do you think that I would
overlook such a thing...

392
00:24:13,043 --> 00:24:15,419
and endanger the life
of my own daughter?

393
00:24:22,499 --> 00:24:24,740
You're not supposed
to read at the table.

394
00:24:26,172 --> 00:24:27,172
Oh, really?

395
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:29,527
Who's going to tell mummy?
You?

396
00:24:32,874 --> 00:24:34,207
Or perhaps you?

397
00:24:40,915 --> 00:24:42,442
Did you really see a boy?

398
00:24:43,781 --> 00:24:45,361
Yes. He's called Victor.

399
00:24:48,001 --> 00:24:49,517
Is he a ghost?

400
00:24:49,562 --> 00:24:51,971
Don't be stupid.
Ghosts aren't like that.

401
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:53,843
What are they like?

402
00:24:54,396 --> 00:24:56,520
I've told you a thousand times.

403
00:24:56,523 --> 00:24:59,633
They go about in white sheets
and carry chains.

404
00:24:59,728 --> 00:25:02,166
- How do you know?
- Because I've seen them.

405
00:25:02,403 --> 00:25:04,002
They come out at night.

406
00:25:04,983 --> 00:25:06,606
Fibber. Where?

407
00:25:13,811 --> 00:25:16,537
- You're stupid.
- Not half as much as you.

408
00:25:16,757 --> 00:25:18,830
But I don't believe you saw that boy.

409
00:25:18,944 --> 00:25:20,101
Believe what you like.

410
00:25:20,104 --> 00:25:22,108
You'll soon be begging us
to play with you.

411
00:25:35,486 --> 00:25:36,486
Nicholas.

412
00:25:36,806 --> 00:25:37,806
Nicholas!

413
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,440
What?

414
00:25:40,927 --> 00:25:41,927
Look.

415
00:25:43,426 --> 00:25:45,420
Why have you opened
the curtains?

416
00:25:45,433 --> 00:25:47,638
- It wasn't me.
- Who was it, then?

417
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,200
It was Victor.

418
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:51,726
He's been doing it all night.

419
00:25:52,525 --> 00:25:54,260
You're lying.
I'm going to tell mummy.

420
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:56,320
- So I'm a liar, am I?
- Yes.

421
00:25:57,653 --> 00:25:59,966
Victor, come out from
behind that curtain...

422
00:25:59,968 --> 00:26:01,861
so my stupid brother can see you.

423
00:26:11,662 --> 00:26:13,222
Leave me alone.

424
00:26:13,225 --> 00:26:15,102
So you don't want
to see him now, eh?

425
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:17,007
You're a cowardy custard.

426
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,770
Cowardy cowardy custard.

427
00:26:18,883 --> 00:26:20,349
Cowardy cowardy custard.

428
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:24,905
I'll just have to do it myself, then.

429
00:26:42,718 --> 00:26:44,185
That's enough, Victor.

430
00:26:47,332 --> 00:26:49,152
Nicholas. Nicholas.

431
00:26:49,272 --> 00:26:50,832
Tell him to leave
the curtains alone.

432
00:26:50,835 --> 00:26:51,985
He won't listen to me.

433
00:26:51,988 --> 00:26:54,261
Stop it.
Get off my bed, both of you.

434
00:26:54,264 --> 00:26:55,544
This is our bed.

435
00:26:56,093 --> 00:26:57,594
No. It's mine.

436
00:26:57,953 --> 00:27:00,759
Anne, please stop
putting on that voice.

437
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,159
You be quiet, cowardy custard.

438
00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:06,934
Listen, if you don't stop,
I'll call my mother...

439
00:27:06,937 --> 00:27:08,455
And she'll kick you out.

440
00:27:08,674 --> 00:27:10,214
You don't know my mother.

441
00:27:10,507 --> 00:27:12,388
And you don't know my parents.

442
00:27:12,534 --> 00:27:15,281
Anne, I'm going to tell
mummy about you.

443
00:27:15,415 --> 00:27:17,623
Don't be stupid.
Can't you see it's not me?

444
00:27:18,935 --> 00:27:21,263
Victor, touch his cheek
so he knows you're real.

445
00:27:33,336 --> 00:27:35,342
Help! Mummy! Help!

446
00:27:35,536 --> 00:27:37,562
Help! Help, mummy!

447
00:27:37,565 --> 00:27:38,758
- What is it?
- Help!

448
00:27:38,906 --> 00:27:40,497
- What is it?
- Help!

449
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,150
What is it?

450
00:27:43,153 --> 00:27:46,536
She was fighting with me,
and I told her to be quiet.

451
00:27:46,764 --> 00:27:49,023
I'm fed up.
Do you hear me?

452
00:27:49,371 --> 00:27:52,734
- I am fed up with you!
- I didn't do anything!

453
00:27:56,204 --> 00:27:59,058
"Therefore The Lord God
sent Him forth..."

454
00:27:59,061 --> 00:28:00,898
"from the garden of Eden..."

455
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:03,737
"to till the ground
from whence he was taken."

456
00:28:03,939 --> 00:28:05,457
"So he drove out the man..."

457
00:28:05,845 --> 00:28:08,257
"and placed to the east
of the Garden of Eden..."

458
00:28:08,338 --> 00:28:10,578
"Cherubims
and a flaming sword..."

459
00:28:10,581 --> 00:28:12,711
"which turned every way
to keep the way..."

460
00:28:12,714 --> 00:28:14,001
"Of the tree of life."

461
00:28:14,366 --> 00:28:16,314
There. I finished.

462
00:28:17,686 --> 00:28:19,206
Very good.

463
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,586
Now you can ask the virgin
for forgiveness.

464
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,733
What?
That's not what we agreed!

465
00:28:27,961 --> 00:28:29,933
We didn't agree anything,
young lady.

466
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:32,541
Today you're being punished,
and you'll do as I say.

467
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,975
You can't make me
ask the virgin for forgiveness.

468
00:28:35,094 --> 00:28:36,134
How dare you!

469
00:28:36,137 --> 00:28:39,450
Mummy, I won't ask forgiveness
for something I didn't do!

470
00:28:39,453 --> 00:28:41,850
You told your brother
someone else was in the room!

471
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,270
- There was!
- You're lying!

472
00:28:43,273 --> 00:28:44,363
I am not!

473
00:28:46,261 --> 00:28:47,261
Anne...

474
00:28:48,507 --> 00:28:51,530
Anne, do you remember the story
about Justus and pastor?

475
00:28:52,082 --> 00:28:54,876
Children who don't tell
the truth end up in limbo.

476
00:28:55,423 --> 00:28:58,183
That's what you say,
but I read the other day...

477
00:28:58,186 --> 00:29:01,185
that limbo's only for children
who haven't been baptized.

478
00:29:02,057 --> 00:29:03,150
And I have!

479
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,717
"And Abraham took the wood..."

480
00:29:07,224 --> 00:29:10,616
"of the burnt offering
and laid it upon Isaac his son."

481
00:29:11,424 --> 00:29:14,432
"And he took the fire
in his hand and a knife..."

482
00:29:15,385 --> 00:29:17,583
"and they went,
both of them together."

483
00:29:17,585 --> 00:29:20,385
"And Isaac spake
unto Abraham his father..."

484
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,305
"and said,' my father...'"

485
00:29:22,785 --> 00:29:25,118
"and he said,
'here I am, my son."'

486
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,127
Did you look in on Nicholas?

487
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,013
Yes, ma'am.
The little angel is fast asleep.

488
00:29:47,814 --> 00:29:49,174
What about Anne?

489
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,193
Is she still on the stairs?

490
00:29:51,493 --> 00:29:52,761
Oh, yes, ma'am.

491
00:29:54,188 --> 00:29:56,034
I'd prefer to have her
where I can see her...

492
00:29:56,037 --> 00:29:58,441
but I can't embroider
in such poor light.

493
00:30:02,349 --> 00:30:04,249
How long is this punishment
going to go on?

494
00:30:04,252 --> 00:30:05,702
It's been three days now.

495
00:30:06,409 --> 00:30:07,609
It's up to her.

496
00:30:09,922 --> 00:30:12,960
She's got to learn to swallow
her pride and ask for forgiveness.

497
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,630
Anyway, it's time
she stared to read the bible.

498
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:18,883
Well...

499
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,330
The priest will be very pleased
to hear that, ma'am.

500
00:30:21,383 --> 00:30:23,381
If he ever deigns
to pay us another visit.

501
00:30:23,384 --> 00:30:25,678
He knows perfectly well
that the children can't go out.

502
00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:28,818
He told me yesterday
he'd be by as soon as possible.

503
00:30:30,003 --> 00:30:32,964
I'm beginning to feel
totally cut off from the world.

504
00:30:35,075 --> 00:30:38,282
This fog doesn't exactly help.
It's never lasted this long before.

505
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,225
Oh, that's true, ma'am.

506
00:30:40,712 --> 00:30:42,640
Even the seagulls have gone quiet.

507
00:30:45,624 --> 00:30:46,624
Anne!

508
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:49,626
Anne, I can't hear you.

509
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:57,446
Incidentally, Mrs. Mills,
I've had to put up with the noise...

510
00:30:57,449 --> 00:30:59,422
of Lydia running around
above my head.

511
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:02,631
She's been hurling backwards and
forwards as if there were three of her.

512
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,092
Would you kindly tell her
it's not necessary...

513
00:31:05,094 --> 00:31:07,655
to kick up quite such a rumpus
just to do a little cleaning?

514
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:10,680
I couldn't bear to get
another migraine attack.

515
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,934
I'll tell her, ma'am.

516
00:31:13,328 --> 00:31:14,328
Thank you.

517
00:32:01,118 --> 00:32:03,012
Now she's really gone too far.

518
00:32:03,645 --> 00:32:04,645
Lydia!

519
00:32:05,112 --> 00:32:06,112
Lydia!

520
00:32:26,072 --> 00:32:29,352
"...in the mount of
The Lord it shall be seen."

521
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:32,516
- "And the angel of the lord..."
- What's going on up there?

522
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:34,810
Nothing, mummy.
I'm just reading, like you told me.

523
00:32:35,355 --> 00:32:36,708
Did you hear it as well?

524
00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:38,269
Hear what?

525
00:32:43,568 --> 00:32:45,039
"And the angel of The Lord..."

526
00:32:45,042 --> 00:32:47,161
"called unto Abraham
out of heaven..."

527
00:32:47,164 --> 00:32:49,156
"the second time and said..."

528
00:32:49,241 --> 00:32:52,275
"'By myself, I have sworn,'
saith The Lord..."

529
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:05,333
- What was that?
- I don't know.

530
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:08,744
Anne, tell me
who's making that noise.

531
00:33:09,223 --> 00:33:10,903
I can't tell you, mummy.

532
00:33:11,511 --> 00:33:12,658
You tell me.

533
00:33:12,778 --> 00:33:15,325
I told you there was
someone in the room...

534
00:33:15,448 --> 00:33:16,915
and you punished me.

535
00:33:16,918 --> 00:33:19,855
- Now I don't know what to say.
- Anne, I want the truth.

536
00:33:21,832 --> 00:33:24,232
Tell me if there is someone upstairs.

537
00:33:26,606 --> 00:33:28,286
There. In that junk room.

538
00:34:17,983 --> 00:34:20,250
Mummy, you're letting the light in.

539
00:35:20,896 --> 00:35:22,829
- She's a woman.
- She's what?

540
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:49,390
- Where did they go?
- They just came past here.

541
00:35:49,392 --> 00:35:51,879
- Didn't you see them?
- Which way did they go?

542
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:55,115
Over there, over there...
and down there as well.

543
00:36:01,412 --> 00:36:04,185
They're everywhere.
They say this house is theirs.

544
00:36:05,299 --> 00:36:08,166
And they say they're going
to take the curtains down.

545
00:36:10,526 --> 00:36:13,487
- Ma'am, stay calm, please.
- I will not stay calm!

546
00:36:13,553 --> 00:36:15,234
For five whole years
during the occupation...

547
00:36:15,236 --> 00:36:17,940
I managed to avoid a single Nazi
stepping foot in this house...

548
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:19,442
and now there is someone here,

549
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:21,469
under my nose,
opening and closing the doors.

550
00:36:21,694 --> 00:36:24,007
Ma'am, this is a very old house.

551
00:36:24,297 --> 00:36:26,989
Why, the floorboards squeak
and the plumbing clanks...

552
00:36:26,992 --> 00:36:28,508
There were voices.
I'm telling you.

553
00:36:28,511 --> 00:36:30,147
- Mummy, look.
- A boy and two women...

554
00:36:30,149 --> 00:36:31,397
- ...talking together.
- Mummy.

555
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,580
Mummy, look!

556
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:36,602
I did it yesterday.

557
00:36:37,135 --> 00:36:39,108
This is the father,
this is the mother...

558
00:36:39,262 --> 00:36:42,322
This is Victor,
and this is the old woman.

559
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:44,102
What do these numbers stand for?

560
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,543
That's the number of times
I've seen them.

561
00:36:46,863 --> 00:36:48,996
I've seen the old woman the most.

562
00:36:53,529 --> 00:36:54,969
Oh, god in heaven.

563
00:36:55,482 --> 00:36:56,920
Mrs. Mills, go and call Mr. Tuttle.

564
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,308
Tell him that we have to search
the whole house immediately...

565
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,662
- Before it gets dark.
- Yes, ma'am. There, now.

566
00:37:01,665 --> 00:37:04,062
- Mummy!
- Yes, darling. It's all right.

567
00:37:04,077 --> 00:37:06,315
Nothing will happen to you
while mummy's here.

568
00:37:07,063 --> 00:37:10,434
Look, mummy.
She really scares me.

569
00:37:10,471 --> 00:37:13,316
It's as if she's not looking at you,
but she can see you.

570
00:37:13,391 --> 00:37:16,298
And she's always around
saying "come with me"...

571
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:17,905
No, Anne, don't lie to me.

572
00:37:17,908 --> 00:37:20,508
Honestly, mummy.
And she asks me things.

573
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:22,794
Victor told me she's a witch.

574
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:24,384
What does she ask you?

575
00:37:24,746 --> 00:37:25,814
Things.

576
00:37:28,338 --> 00:37:30,086
Her breath smells.

577
00:37:33,926 --> 00:37:35,993
We have to open all the curtains.

578
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,717
I don't want any dark corners
where someone could hide.

579
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,873
- Yes, ma'am.
- You both search the right side,

580
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:42,173
and I'll take the left.

581
00:37:42,305 --> 00:37:43,753
Then we'll search upstairs.

582
00:38:55,114 --> 00:38:56,754
Perhaps they're ghosts...

583
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:58,960
Who lived in this house before.

584
00:38:59,154 --> 00:39:01,620
Don't be stupid.
I've already told you.

585
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:05,373
Ghosts go about in white sheets
and carry chains and go "Oooh!."

586
00:39:06,086 --> 00:39:07,413
Now, Anne.

587
00:39:07,608 --> 00:39:09,949
Why do you make up such stories?

588
00:39:09,952 --> 00:39:12,061
I don't. I read them in books.

589
00:39:12,168 --> 00:39:15,432
Well, you shouldn't believe
everything that you read in books.

590
00:39:15,435 --> 00:39:16,993
That's what our mother says.

591
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:20,174
She says all this stuff
about ghosts is rubbish.

592
00:39:20,362 --> 00:39:24,350
And then she expects us to believe
everything written in the bible.

593
00:39:24,496 --> 00:39:26,121
And don't you believe it?

594
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,506
I believe some things.

595
00:39:27,653 --> 00:39:29,786
But, for example, I don't believe...

596
00:39:29,796 --> 00:39:32,360
that god made the world
in seven days.

597
00:39:32,476 --> 00:39:36,555
And I don't believe that Noah got
all those animals into one boat...

598
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,817
or the holy spirit is a dove.

599
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:41,337
No, I don't believe that, either.

600
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,099
Doves are anything but holy.

601
00:39:43,184 --> 00:39:44,733
They poo on our windows.

602
00:39:50,557 --> 00:39:54,384
Have you mentioned...
any of this to your mother?

603
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,050
Ma'am.

604
00:41:02,124 --> 00:41:03,124
Yes?

605
00:41:03,977 --> 00:41:05,962
They've searched everywhere, ma'am.

606
00:41:06,111 --> 00:41:07,311
There's no one.

607
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:08,632
I see.

608
00:41:11,365 --> 00:41:12,498
Mrs. Mills.

609
00:41:14,285 --> 00:41:15,285
Yes, ma'am?

610
00:41:16,305 --> 00:41:18,444
Do you have any idea
what this might be?

611
00:41:20,606 --> 00:41:22,319
'Tis a photograph album, ma'am.

612
00:41:22,322 --> 00:41:23,906
No, but look. They're all asleep.

613
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:25,166
Look.

614
00:41:26,286 --> 00:41:28,519
They're not asleep, ma'am.
They're dead.

615
00:41:30,686 --> 00:41:32,100
'Tis a book of the dead.

616
00:41:32,487 --> 00:41:34,213
In the last century, I believe,

617
00:41:34,216 --> 00:41:36,313
they used to take
photographs of the dead...

618
00:41:36,316 --> 00:41:38,322
in the hopes that their souls would...

619
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:41,034
go on living through the portraits.

620
00:41:43,841 --> 00:41:45,794
There are even group portraits.

621
00:41:47,921 --> 00:41:49,154
And children!

622
00:41:49,794 --> 00:41:51,154
Oh, it's macabre!

623
00:41:53,649 --> 00:41:56,075
How could these people
be so superstitious?

624
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:58,848
Grief over the death
of a loved one...

625
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:02,165
can lead people to do
the strangest things.

626
00:42:06,243 --> 00:42:08,723
Get rid of it.
I don't want it in the house.

627
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:10,490
Yes, ma'am.

628
00:42:23,377 --> 00:42:26,057
Mrs. Mills, it's cold. Why don't
you come and sit by the fire?

629
00:42:38,879 --> 00:42:40,552
Thank you very much, ma'am.

630
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,593
So... tell me about
when you worked here before.

631
00:42:45,513 --> 00:42:47,633
Did you have to look
after children then as well?

632
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:51,879
No, I was in charge of
organizing the housework.

633
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,912
Were there many servants?

634
00:42:55,885 --> 00:42:57,213
About fifteen.

635
00:42:58,814 --> 00:43:01,941
Though in the end there were
just the three of us left.

636
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,246
Why?

637
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,633
My employers moved to London.

638
00:43:06,381 --> 00:43:09,580
They came here less and less, it...

639
00:43:09,974 --> 00:43:11,615
being so out of the way like.

640
00:43:11,921 --> 00:43:15,948
So gradually the house just...
became empty.

641
00:43:17,575 --> 00:43:19,915
Everybody ends up leaving
this damned island.

642
00:43:22,076 --> 00:43:24,743
My family left in the summer of 1940....

643
00:43:24,896 --> 00:43:26,576
Just before the invasion.

644
00:43:28,623 --> 00:43:30,410
That was the last I've heard of them.

645
00:43:35,044 --> 00:43:36,277
I don't blame them.

646
00:43:38,057 --> 00:43:39,877
Actually, we left, too.

647
00:43:41,877 --> 00:43:43,077
Although, you know...

648
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,224
Sometimes when you leave a place it's...

649
00:43:45,818 --> 00:43:49,551
like it's there with you...
all the time.

650
00:43:50,171 --> 00:43:52,945
I always felt like I never left this house.

651
00:43:53,545 --> 00:43:54,785
Why did you leave?

652
00:43:56,132 --> 00:43:58,212
It was on account of the tuberculosis.

653
00:43:58,215 --> 00:44:00,055
The whole area was evacuated.

654
00:44:04,013 --> 00:44:05,786
Was that when Lydia went dumb?

655
00:44:06,886 --> 00:44:08,520
Yes, I think so...

656
00:44:09,373 --> 00:44:13,226
Though, you know, my memory's
a bit rusty these days, ma'am.

657
00:44:13,229 --> 00:44:14,526
What happened to her?

658
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,380
It was suddenly one day.

659
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,867
She just... stopped talking.

660
00:44:27,388 --> 00:44:29,188
Well, there must've been a reason.

661
00:44:30,735 --> 00:44:32,701
People don't just stop talking.

662
00:44:32,995 --> 00:44:36,290
These things are always the result
of some sort of trauma.

663
00:44:37,588 --> 00:44:39,428
Something must've happened to her.

664
00:44:43,902 --> 00:44:45,503
Did your employers treat you well?

665
00:44:46,002 --> 00:44:47,821
They were always very kind to us.

666
00:44:48,382 --> 00:44:50,256
They treated us just like family.

667
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,810
You know, ma'am,
I think I will go to bed.

668
00:44:55,883 --> 00:44:58,610
I'll never be able
to get up in the morning.

669
00:44:59,097 --> 00:45:00,097
Off you go.

670
00:45:00,983 --> 00:45:02,577
I'm going to stay here
a while longer.

671
00:45:03,277 --> 00:45:04,277
Yes, ma'am.

672
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,633
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

673
00:45:48,641 --> 00:45:50,241
Can you forgive me?

674
00:45:56,449 --> 00:45:57,449
Anne.

675
00:46:17,271 --> 00:46:19,274
- Mummy.
- What?

676
00:46:20,003 --> 00:46:21,736
When's daddy coming home?

677
00:46:23,131 --> 00:46:24,537
When the war's over.

678
00:46:25,591 --> 00:46:27,271
Why did he go to war?

679
00:46:27,512 --> 00:46:30,725
I mean,
nobody's done anything bad to us.

680
00:46:32,471 --> 00:46:33,511
Daddy went...

681
00:46:37,238 --> 00:46:39,473
Daddy went because he's very brave...

682
00:46:41,286 --> 00:46:43,226
And because he wasn't prepared...

683
00:46:43,229 --> 00:46:45,546
to let the Germans tell him
what he had to do.

684
00:46:46,939 --> 00:46:47,939
Why?

685
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,420
Charles...

686
00:46:59,994 --> 00:47:01,114
Where are you?

687
00:49:49,329 --> 00:49:50,615
Mrs. Mills!

688
00:49:52,449 --> 00:49:53,855
Mrs. Mills!

689
00:49:55,395 --> 00:49:56,809
What's the matter, ma'am?

690
00:49:57,002 --> 00:50:00,162
The key to the music room,
give it to me! Quickly!

691
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:02,171
- What's happening, ma'am?
- Come on!

692
00:50:11,837 --> 00:50:13,017
Oh, my god.

693
00:50:17,084 --> 00:50:18,911
I checked that room myself.

694
00:50:21,478 --> 00:50:22,657
It was empty.

695
00:50:23,577 --> 00:50:25,310
Take these tablets, ma'am.

696
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:27,017
- And yet...
- They'll do you good.

697
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,790
And yet I felt as if there
was someone else there.

698
00:50:32,298 --> 00:50:33,818
And it wasn't human.

699
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,798
There is something in this house.

700
00:50:38,613 --> 00:50:40,133
Something diabolic.

701
00:50:40,606 --> 00:50:41,606
Ma'am...

702
00:50:42,033 --> 00:50:43,713
Something which is not...

703
00:50:46,833 --> 00:50:48,008
Not at rest.

704
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,427
I know you don't believe it.

705
00:50:55,494 --> 00:50:57,007
You don't believe it, do you?

706
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,334
I don't blame you.

707
00:50:59,867 --> 00:51:02,700
I... I used to not believe these things.

708
00:51:04,788 --> 00:51:06,308
I do believe it, ma'am.

709
00:51:09,934 --> 00:51:12,334
I've always believed in those things.

710
00:51:12,962 --> 00:51:14,841
They're not easy to explain...

711
00:51:15,575 --> 00:51:16,876
But they do happen.

712
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:21,420
We've all heard stories of...
the beyond...

713
00:51:22,216 --> 00:51:23,509
Now and then...

714
00:51:25,369 --> 00:51:29,102
I think that sometimes...
the world...

715
00:51:31,167 --> 00:51:33,287
of the dead gets mixed up...

716
00:51:34,327 --> 00:51:35,747
with the world of the living.

717
00:51:37,504 --> 00:51:38,844
But it's impossible.

718
00:51:39,197 --> 00:51:41,464
The lord would never allow
such an aberration.

719
00:51:41,467 --> 00:51:42,745
The living and the dead,

720
00:51:42,748 --> 00:51:44,928
they will only meet
at the end of eternity.

721
00:51:47,864 --> 00:51:50,091
- It says so in the bible.
- Ma'am...

722
00:51:52,386 --> 00:51:55,365
There isn't always
an answer for everything.

723
00:52:08,207 --> 00:52:09,773
Where are you off to, ma'am?

724
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:12,500
I'm going to the village
to pay father McGraw a visit.

725
00:52:13,002 --> 00:52:14,975
If he won't come here,
then I shall go to him.

726
00:52:15,066 --> 00:52:16,173
I shall bring him back.

727
00:52:16,176 --> 00:52:17,976
But, ma'am, you should wait
till the weather improves.

728
00:52:17,978 --> 00:52:19,361
I've waited long enough.

729
00:52:20,961 --> 00:52:24,341
- Ma'am, the priest told me that...
- I don't care what he told you!

730
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:26,961
I want him to tell me personally!

731
00:52:27,149 --> 00:52:28,535
He must come today!

732
00:52:28,641 --> 00:52:30,355
But what are you going to tell him?

733
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:33,075
That we have searched every
room in there inch by inch...

734
00:52:33,535 --> 00:52:35,438
And now I need them to be blessed.

735
00:52:37,709 --> 00:52:40,703
Ma'am, please, wait.
Still, it's very early.

736
00:52:40,706 --> 00:52:43,079
- Mr. Tuttle.
- Morning, ma'am.

737
00:52:43,423 --> 00:52:46,329
I need you to search
the garden for gravestones.

738
00:52:46,332 --> 00:52:47,452
- Gravestones?
- Yes.

739
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:50,416
When my husband bought this house
we were told there was a little cemetery.

740
00:52:50,757 --> 00:52:53,115
I think it was over there,
amongst the trees.

741
00:52:53,118 --> 00:52:54,416
I've not seen anything.

742
00:52:54,419 --> 00:52:57,270
Check carefully.
It could be overgrown.

743
00:52:57,848 --> 00:52:59,056
- Yes, ma'am.
- I need to know...

744
00:52:59,058 --> 00:53:00,749
...if there was a family buried here...

745
00:53:01,197 --> 00:53:03,296
And if they had a little boy.
Victor.

746
00:53:19,299 --> 00:53:21,586
Now she thinks the house is haunted.

747
00:53:22,607 --> 00:53:25,040
Do you think it's safe to let her go?

748
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,320
Don't worry.
The fog won't let her get very far.

749
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,007
Oh, yes, the fog.

750
00:53:30,413 --> 00:53:31,933
The fog, of course.

751
00:53:33,106 --> 00:53:37,355
And when do you think we should
bring all this out into the open?

752
00:53:37,908 --> 00:53:39,940
All in good time, Mr. Tuttle.

753
00:53:39,942 --> 00:53:41,548
All in good time.

754
00:53:42,575 --> 00:53:44,114
Speaking of which...

755
00:54:54,947 --> 00:54:55,947
Wha...

756
00:55:38,904 --> 00:55:39,904
Charles?

757
00:55:41,537 --> 00:55:42,537
Grace?

758
00:55:56,173 --> 00:55:58,593
You're here. You're here.

759
00:55:59,853 --> 00:56:01,886
They... They said there was no hope.

760
00:56:03,003 --> 00:56:05,159
They said I should
give you up for dead.

761
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:07,420
They say a lot of things.

762
00:56:12,727 --> 00:56:13,847
Oh, thank you.

763
00:56:15,027 --> 00:56:16,227
Thank you, God.

764
00:56:16,694 --> 00:56:17,894
Thank you, God.

765
00:56:18,621 --> 00:56:20,647
Every night I prayed for this...

766
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:23,627
Begging God to bring you back.

767
00:56:25,935 --> 00:56:28,055
Bring the children their father back.

768
00:56:28,288 --> 00:56:29,288
Bring him...

769
00:56:32,242 --> 00:56:34,523
But where have you been all this time?

770
00:56:35,696 --> 00:56:38,923
Out there.
Looking for my home.

771
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:48,744
You're so different.

772
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:51,584
So different.

773
00:56:52,384 --> 00:56:53,890
Sometimes I bleed.

774
00:57:32,201 --> 00:57:33,201
Ma'am...

775
00:57:35,814 --> 00:57:36,854
Mrs. Mills...

776
00:57:39,528 --> 00:57:40,988
This is my husband.

777
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:47,202
I'm very pleased to meet you, sir.

778
00:57:47,469 --> 00:57:48,815
He's very weak.

779
00:57:49,609 --> 00:57:50,609
Here.

780
00:57:53,409 --> 00:57:56,282
I want you to prepare a hot bath
and some clean clothes.

781
00:57:57,409 --> 00:57:58,655
And something to eat.

782
00:57:58,743 --> 00:58:00,116
Right away, ma'am.

783
00:58:19,912 --> 00:58:21,432
How are my little ones?

784
00:58:24,311 --> 00:58:25,311
Daddy!

785
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:30,238
Why did you take so long?

786
00:58:37,406 --> 00:58:38,606
Hello, Nicholas.

787
00:58:39,053 --> 00:58:41,573
I told you, you see.
I told you he'd come back.

788
00:58:49,134 --> 00:58:50,800
Have you both been well behaved?

789
00:58:51,174 --> 00:58:52,547
We've been very good.

790
00:58:52,874 --> 00:58:55,047
- Have you been good to your mother?
- Very good.

791
00:58:55,314 --> 00:58:57,540
We study every day
for our first communion.

792
00:58:58,941 --> 00:59:00,535
Daddy, did you kill anyone?

793
00:59:08,275 --> 00:59:09,509
Here he comes!

794
00:59:13,142 --> 00:59:16,256
Darling,
we've prepared lunch for you.

795
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:19,396
Are you coming down
or would you prefer that...

796
00:59:31,771 --> 00:59:33,271
When's daddy coming down?

797
00:59:33,274 --> 00:59:35,184
Be patient, Anne. Daddy is...

798
00:59:35,992 --> 00:59:36,992
not well.

799
00:59:37,617 --> 00:59:39,704
He said he'd seen a lot of dead men.

800
00:59:44,619 --> 00:59:46,952
Mummy, when people die
in the war...

801
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:48,285
Where do they go?

802
00:59:48,392 --> 00:59:49,592
Oh, what a question.

803
00:59:50,825 --> 00:59:51,825
It depends.

804
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:54,621
- On what?
- Well...

805
00:59:55,207 --> 00:59:57,860
On whether they fought on the side
of the goodies or the baddies.

806
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,420
Your father, for example,
fought for England,

807
01:00:00,423 --> 01:00:01,903
on the side of the goodies.

808
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:06,746
How do you know who the goodies
and the baddies are?

809
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,846
That's enough questions.
Eat your food.

810
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,220
You'll never go to war.

811
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,080
We'll never go anywhere.

812
01:00:16,314 --> 01:00:18,467
You're not missing out on anything.

813
01:00:19,034 --> 01:00:21,528
You're much better off at home
with your mummy and daddy,

814
01:00:21,538 --> 01:00:23,261
who love you very, very much.

815
01:00:25,568 --> 01:00:26,868
And the intruders.

816
01:00:28,755 --> 01:00:30,248
There are no intruders here.

817
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:33,042
But you said that there were.

818
01:00:33,045 --> 01:00:34,590
No, I said that
there are no intruders here.

819
01:00:34,592 --> 01:00:36,656
I don't want to hear
another word on the subject.

820
01:00:36,709 --> 01:00:38,706
- But you said...
- That is enough!

821
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:41,466
Can I say something?

822
01:00:41,469 --> 01:00:42,986
- No!
- Why not?

823
01:00:42,989 --> 01:00:45,035
Because... Because you can't!

824
01:00:52,017 --> 01:00:53,730
Anne, stop breathing like that.

825
01:00:56,325 --> 01:00:57,751
You heard me. Stop it.

826
01:01:00,945 --> 01:01:02,791
Stop breathing!

827
01:01:05,432 --> 01:01:06,959
Right, you go to your room.

828
01:01:07,133 --> 01:01:09,412
Go to your room.
No dessert for you today.

829
01:01:16,258 --> 01:01:19,138
No crying now, no crying.

830
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:21,300
Stop that here.

831
01:01:21,787 --> 01:01:24,567
Look what an awful face
you've got when you cry.

832
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:26,076
I don't care!

833
01:01:26,078 --> 01:01:28,081
There, there.

834
01:01:28,567 --> 01:01:29,927
You listen to me.

835
01:01:32,267 --> 01:01:33,901
I've seen them, too.

836
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:36,275
You have?

837
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,400
Yes.

838
01:01:38,621 --> 01:01:41,887
Why don't you tell my mother?
Then maybe she'll believe me.

839
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:44,838
There are things your mother
doesn't want to hear.

840
01:01:45,482 --> 01:01:48,065
She only believes
in what she was taught.

841
01:01:48,296 --> 01:01:49,469
But don't worry...

842
01:01:50,303 --> 01:01:51,549
sooner or later...

843
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:54,389
She'll see them.

844
01:01:55,267 --> 01:01:57,142
Then everything will be different.

845
01:01:57,710 --> 01:01:58,710
How?

846
01:02:00,163 --> 01:02:02,016
Oh, you'll see.

847
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:05,785
There are going to be
some big surprises.

848
01:02:06,643 --> 01:02:08,009
There are going to be...

849
01:02:09,271 --> 01:02:10,271
changes.

850
01:02:11,197 --> 01:02:12,437
Changes?

851
01:02:24,552 --> 01:02:27,918
Now she's behaving as if
nothing had happened.

852
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:30,919
What about her daughter?

853
01:02:31,632 --> 01:02:33,119
Oh, she's not so stubborn.

854
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,759
The children will be
easier to convince.

855
01:02:37,185 --> 01:02:40,153
No, it's the mother who's
going to cause us problems.

856
01:02:42,147 --> 01:02:44,880
Do you think her husband
suspects anything?

857
01:02:46,133 --> 01:02:47,133
No.

858
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:50,200
I don't think he even
knows where he is.

859
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,762
Look what a pretty daughter I've got.

860
01:03:11,342 --> 01:03:14,262
Mummy made this veil
especially for you.

861
01:03:16,309 --> 01:03:17,816
I look like a bride.

862
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:22,223
Yes. You do.

863
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:29,397
I need to shorten the sleeves a little.

864
01:03:30,278 --> 01:03:32,198
- You can take it off now.
- No.

865
01:03:32,201 --> 01:03:34,232
Anne, this dress has to be
spotless for your first communion.

866
01:03:34,234 --> 01:03:36,038
I promise I won't dirty it.

867
01:03:36,357 --> 01:03:38,231
Just let me wear it for a little longer.

868
01:03:38,234 --> 01:03:40,411
- Just a little?
- Oh, just a little?

869
01:03:42,105 --> 01:03:43,125
All right.

870
01:03:44,347 --> 01:03:45,712
I'll be back shortly.

871
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:48,833
No sitting on the floor
or leaning against the walls.

872
01:03:48,836 --> 01:03:49,836
No.

873
01:04:06,587 --> 01:04:08,974
Monsieur,
would you like to dance?

874
01:04:12,121 --> 01:04:13,381
I'd love to.

875
01:04:37,103 --> 01:04:38,903
Charles, you can't go on like this.

876
01:04:38,906 --> 01:04:40,369
You must eat something.

877
01:05:02,671 --> 01:05:03,845
<i>in the sky</i>

878
01:05:06,406 --> 01:05:10,992
<i>I don't know if it's
cloudy or bright...</i>

879
01:05:13,232 --> 01:05:15,932
<i>but I only have eyes...</i>

880
01:05:17,127 --> 01:05:20,926
<i>for you, dear</i>

881
01:05:21,967 --> 01:05:25,383
<i>The moon may be high...</i>

882
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:00,410
Anne, you need to take
the dress off now.

883
01:06:04,444 --> 01:06:06,297
Anne, are you listening to me?

884
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:09,710
Anne?

885
01:06:14,538 --> 01:06:17,298
What did I tell you
about sitting on the floor?

886
01:06:17,332 --> 01:06:18,532
But it's clean.

887
01:06:18,535 --> 01:06:19,798
It makes no difference.

888
01:06:19,801 --> 01:06:21,781
Why can't you ever do
as you're told...

889
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:47,607
What's the matter?

890
01:06:47,914 --> 01:06:49,460
Where is my daughter?

891
01:06:53,415 --> 01:06:55,208
What have you done
with my daughter?

892
01:06:55,515 --> 01:06:56,641
Are you mad?

893
01:06:57,583 --> 01:06:59,021
I am your daughter.

894
01:07:00,021 --> 01:07:02,381
No! You're not my daughter!

895
01:07:03,242 --> 01:07:04,242
No!

896
01:07:07,629 --> 01:07:10,549
You're not my daughter! No!

897
01:07:11,156 --> 01:07:13,022
No! No!

898
01:07:24,537 --> 01:07:26,023
Ma'am, I heard shouts.

899
01:07:26,026 --> 01:07:27,504
She wants to kill me!

900
01:07:27,663 --> 01:07:29,683
She won't stop until she kills us!

901
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:31,124
She won't stop!

902
01:07:31,127 --> 01:07:33,687
- She won't stop until she kills us!
- Hush, child. Come with me.

903
01:07:33,765 --> 01:07:36,407
You're wicked!
You're wicked! Wicked!

904
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:38,178
Wicked!

905
01:07:49,366 --> 01:07:50,405
How is she?

906
01:07:50,913 --> 01:07:52,545
There's no calming her...

907
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:55,220
So I've left her with her father.

908
01:07:55,765 --> 01:07:57,999
She insisted on speaking with him.

909
01:08:01,954 --> 01:08:03,027
What happened?

910
01:08:03,969 --> 01:08:05,161
Why did you fight?

911
01:08:05,321 --> 01:08:06,534
It wasn't her.

912
01:08:08,033 --> 01:08:11,001
It was the old woman...
with the strange eyes.

913
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:13,284
She was imitating
my daughter's voice.

914
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:16,289
I'd swear to God
that it wasn't my daughter.

915
01:08:19,075 --> 01:08:21,395
Oh, God. God help me.

916
01:08:23,195 --> 01:08:25,435
God help me.
What's the matter with me?

917
01:08:26,449 --> 01:08:28,169
I don't know
what's the matter with me.

918
01:08:29,409 --> 01:08:31,369
You must get more rest.

919
01:08:33,896 --> 01:08:37,896
You can't take on the whole
responsibility of this house.

920
01:08:38,624 --> 01:08:39,824
Leave it to us.

921
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:42,110
We know what has to be done.

922
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:47,364
What do you mean by that?

923
01:08:49,132 --> 01:08:51,145
What do you mean
you know what has to be done?

924
01:08:51,304 --> 01:08:53,105
Nothing, ma'am.
I was just suggesting...

925
01:08:53,108 --> 01:08:54,558
There's nothing to suggest.

926
01:08:56,506 --> 01:08:59,300
Who do you think you are?
You have no idea what has to be done.

927
01:09:04,419 --> 01:09:05,419
Or do you?

928
01:09:09,385 --> 01:09:10,599
What are these?

929
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:16,313
The tablets for your migraine, ma'am.

930
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,346
The ones you always take.

931
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:22,553
Please, I need to be on my own.

932
01:09:24,419 --> 01:09:25,419
Yes, ma'am.

933
01:09:49,342 --> 01:09:50,342
Come, child.

934
01:10:13,912 --> 01:10:15,472
Anne told me everything.

935
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:24,672
I wish I had an explanation,
but I haven't.

936
01:10:25,739 --> 01:10:27,952
At first, I thought there
was someone else in the house.

937
01:10:27,955 --> 01:10:29,652
Even thought there were ghosts.

938
01:10:29,655 --> 01:10:31,399
I'm not talking about the ghosts.

939
01:10:33,086 --> 01:10:35,259
I'm talking about
what happened that day.

940
01:10:42,787 --> 01:10:44,340
I don't know what
you're talking about.

941
01:10:44,343 --> 01:10:45,507
Tell me it's not true.

942
01:10:46,681 --> 01:10:48,007
Tell me what happened.

943
01:10:49,608 --> 01:10:50,608
Happened?

944
01:10:56,902 --> 01:10:59,481
I don't know
what came over me that day.

945
01:11:01,376 --> 01:11:03,729
The servants had left
during the night.

946
01:11:04,156 --> 01:11:06,576
Hadn't the courage
to tell me to my face.

947
01:11:09,629 --> 01:11:10,629
They knew...

948
01:11:12,104 --> 01:11:14,189
that I couldn't leave the house.

949
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:16,890
They knew.

950
01:11:20,477 --> 01:11:21,477
Anne.

951
01:11:23,317 --> 01:11:25,517
Anne, what happened?

952
01:11:28,198 --> 01:11:29,438
She hit me.

953
01:11:30,491 --> 01:11:33,398
She went mad like she did that day.

954
01:11:34,077 --> 01:11:35,510
Do you remember?

955
01:11:37,739 --> 01:11:38,739
No.

956
01:11:41,165 --> 01:11:43,012
You must forgive me, Charles.

957
01:11:44,912 --> 01:11:45,912
Not me.

958
01:11:47,479 --> 01:11:48,505
The children.

959
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:50,953
They know that I love them.

960
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,400
They know I'd never hurt them. I'd...

961
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,312
I'd die first.

962
01:12:00,241 --> 01:12:01,668
What are you going to do?

963
01:12:03,594 --> 01:12:05,061
Are you angry with me?

964
01:12:09,079 --> 01:12:12,163
I just came back to say goodbye
to my wife and children.

965
01:12:13,161 --> 01:12:14,281
Now I must go.

966
01:12:15,442 --> 01:12:16,442
Go where?

967
01:12:18,275 --> 01:12:19,315
To the front.

968
01:12:19,608 --> 01:12:20,951
No. The war's over.

969
01:12:22,825 --> 01:12:24,088
The war is not over.

970
01:12:24,091 --> 01:12:25,598
What are you talking about?

971
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:29,573
You're not going, do you hear me?

972
01:12:29,576 --> 01:12:32,180
You left us once already.
You can't go!

973
01:12:33,496 --> 01:12:34,496
Why?

974
01:12:34,943 --> 01:12:37,689
Why did you have
to go to that stupid war...

975
01:12:37,692 --> 01:12:39,688
that had nothing to do with us?

976
01:12:41,018 --> 01:12:43,478
Why couldn't you have
stayed here like the others did?

977
01:12:43,481 --> 01:12:46,084
- The others surrendered.
- We all surrendered!

978
01:12:46,751 --> 01:12:49,150
The whole island was occupied!
What...

979
01:12:49,905 --> 01:12:51,938
What did you expect?

980
01:12:57,285 --> 01:13:00,338
What were you trying
to prove by going to war?

981
01:13:00,341 --> 01:13:02,545
Your place was here with us.

982
01:13:04,633 --> 01:13:05,993
With your family.

983
01:13:12,453 --> 01:13:13,673
I loved you.

984
01:13:15,887 --> 01:13:17,567
That was enough for me.

985
01:13:18,767 --> 01:13:21,405
Living in this darkness,

986
01:13:23,328 --> 01:13:24,591
in this prison.

987
01:13:28,048 --> 01:13:29,328
But not for you.

988
01:13:31,514 --> 01:13:33,414
I wasn't enough for you.

989
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:36,266
That's why you left.

990
01:13:39,676 --> 01:13:41,302
It wasn't just the war.

991
01:13:44,495 --> 01:13:46,815
You want to leave me, don't you?

992
01:15:53,886 --> 01:15:54,886
Anne!

993
01:15:56,553 --> 01:15:57,553
Nicholas!

994
01:16:08,028 --> 01:16:09,687
What is it? What...

995
01:16:15,975 --> 01:16:16,975
Oh, my god!

996
01:16:17,735 --> 01:16:19,569
Here! Oh, my god!

997
01:16:28,076 --> 01:16:29,076
Here!

998
01:16:40,444 --> 01:16:41,910
Where are the curtains?

999
01:16:47,225 --> 01:16:48,718
Mrs. Mills!

1000
01:17:04,139 --> 01:17:06,219
Let me see. Let me see.

1001
01:17:07,265 --> 01:17:10,146
Oh, you're all right!
You're all right!

1002
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:12,011
I want my daddy!

1003
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:19,033
Daddy's gone.

1004
01:17:19,420 --> 01:17:20,873
It's not true!

1005
01:17:21,548 --> 01:17:22,780
Yes, it is.

1006
01:17:24,541 --> 01:17:25,654
It is true.

1007
01:17:28,347 --> 01:17:29,874
I love you, mummy.

1008
01:17:38,221 --> 01:17:39,955
Find the curtains.

1009
01:17:43,282 --> 01:17:44,282
Who was it?

1010
01:17:45,189 --> 01:17:46,309
Who did this?

1011
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:47,790
Tell me!

1012
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:49,622
Tell me!

1013
01:17:51,569 --> 01:17:53,282
You know what's happening here!

1014
01:17:53,403 --> 01:17:55,550
You know because
it happened to you, too!

1015
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:56,796
You'll tell me.

1016
01:17:57,784 --> 01:17:59,050
You write it down.

1017
01:17:59,671 --> 01:18:01,936
Write it down! Please!

1018
01:18:01,939 --> 01:18:04,939
That attitude won't solve
anything, ma'am.

1019
01:18:06,665 --> 01:18:08,345
Anyway, she can't write.

1020
01:18:08,412 --> 01:18:10,092
- Where are they?
- What?

1021
01:18:10,358 --> 01:18:11,705
The curtains!

1022
01:18:12,111 --> 01:18:14,525
The curtains my
children's lives depend on!

1023
01:18:14,528 --> 01:18:16,131
Someone has taken the curtains!

1024
01:18:16,134 --> 01:18:17,541
I have noticed, ma'am.

1025
01:18:17,544 --> 01:18:19,814
There's no need for you
to raise your voice.

1026
01:18:21,032 --> 01:18:24,299
Oh, Mr. Tuttle.
I was just on the point of calling you.

1027
01:18:24,819 --> 01:18:27,792
Did you know that someone
has taken all the curtains?

1028
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:30,399
The curtains?

1029
01:18:31,901 --> 01:18:33,031
Oh, dear.

1030
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:37,011
Why should anyone want
to take all the curtains?

1031
01:18:38,867 --> 01:18:41,694
To let some daylight
into this house, I imagine.

1032
01:18:42,166 --> 01:18:44,699
Daylight. Of course.

1033
01:18:45,079 --> 01:18:47,052
Someone wants to kill my children.

1034
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:49,835
Now, why do you think that
the daylight would kill them?

1035
01:18:51,434 --> 01:18:52,581
Are you mad?

1036
01:18:54,061 --> 01:18:55,148
I told you.

1037
01:18:56,393 --> 01:18:57,681
I already told you!

1038
01:18:57,684 --> 01:19:00,996
The children are photosensitive!
The light will kill them!

1039
01:19:00,999 --> 01:19:03,130
Yes, but that was before.

1040
01:19:03,933 --> 01:19:06,570
The condition could have
cleared up by itself.

1041
01:19:06,662 --> 01:19:09,238
I mean, if you never
expose them to daylight...

1042
01:19:09,241 --> 01:19:11,005
How do you know they're not cured?

1043
01:19:11,662 --> 01:19:15,591
My sister-in-law had terrible
attacks of rheumatism...

1044
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:17,670
in her legs and back.

1045
01:19:18,830 --> 01:19:20,377
Then one fine day...

1046
01:19:22,478 --> 01:19:23,838
they disappeared.

1047
01:19:25,958 --> 01:19:27,836
I am going to find those curtains.

1048
01:19:27,839 --> 01:19:29,831
And when you have finished
helping me hang them...

1049
01:19:29,834 --> 01:19:31,357
you will leave this house!

1050
01:19:45,193 --> 01:19:47,246
And what about the master, ma'am?

1051
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,566
What has he got to say
about all of this?

1052
01:19:50,673 --> 01:19:51,893
Give me your keys.

1053
01:19:52,867 --> 01:19:54,273
I want your keys now!

1054
01:19:59,054 --> 01:20:00,434
I know what you want.

1055
01:20:01,407 --> 01:20:02,881
You want to frighten us.

1056
01:20:02,884 --> 01:20:04,554
You want to get us out,
me and my children.

1057
01:20:04,556 --> 01:20:07,796
You've wanted to take over this house
ever since the first day you arrived.

1058
01:20:08,606 --> 01:20:10,141
Now, you give me those keys.

1059
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:12,412
I will not ask again.

1060
01:20:12,415 --> 01:20:14,173
You should try and calm down, ma'am.

1061
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:16,761
Give me the keys.

1062
01:20:18,423 --> 01:20:19,703
Give them to me.

1063
01:20:26,283 --> 01:20:27,729
And now get out of here.

1064
01:20:45,971 --> 01:20:47,838
You know something, Mr. Tuttle?

1065
01:20:48,924 --> 01:20:51,657
I think I've reached
the end of my tether.

1066
01:20:52,051 --> 01:20:53,123
What about you?

1067
01:20:54,205 --> 01:20:55,205
Oh, yes.

1068
01:20:56,531 --> 01:20:57,531
Definitely.

1069
01:20:59,339 --> 01:21:01,672
We'd better go and
uncover the gravestones.

1070
01:21:41,302 --> 01:21:42,822
What's mummy doing?

1071
01:21:43,090 --> 01:21:45,029
I've already told you.
She's gone mad.

1072
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:46,350
Liar.

1073
01:21:46,353 --> 01:21:48,359
- She's gone mad!
- Liar, liar!

1074
01:21:48,406 --> 01:21:50,979
- She's gone mad! She's gone mad!
- Liar, liar. liar, liar!

1075
01:21:57,151 --> 01:21:58,244
Night time.

1076
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:01,537
Where are you going?

1077
01:22:01,731 --> 01:22:02,891
I've had enough.

1078
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:07,249
I'm going into the woods
to look for daddy.

1079
01:22:07,365 --> 01:22:08,976
Are you going to run away?

1080
01:22:11,638 --> 01:22:14,498
If I hang onto the pipe,
I can climb down to the ground.

1081
01:22:15,092 --> 01:22:16,205
It's very easy.

1082
01:22:30,254 --> 01:22:33,000
If mummy finds out,
you're in for it.

1083
01:22:33,694 --> 01:22:35,314
Yes, yes, yes.

1084
01:22:44,795 --> 01:22:46,055
Anne, wait!

1085
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:49,201
I want to come and look
for daddy, too.

1086
01:22:49,461 --> 01:22:52,533
Liar. You just don't want
to be left on your own.

1087
01:22:52,809 --> 01:22:55,210
- Scaredy pants, scaredy pants!
- Be quiet!

1088
01:23:49,466 --> 01:23:51,260
Anne, I think we got lost.

1089
01:23:51,713 --> 01:23:53,866
We still haven't
left the garden yet, silly.

1090
01:23:54,968 --> 01:23:57,787
- I'm scared.
- Shouldn't have come, then.

1091
01:24:02,061 --> 01:24:04,687
- Say something.
- What shall I say?

1092
01:24:05,388 --> 01:24:07,287
I don't know. Anything.

1093
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:10,383
Let's see.
My name is Anne and I'm walking.

1094
01:24:10,435 --> 01:24:12,502
I'm walking and my name is Anne.

1095
01:24:39,864 --> 01:24:41,351
What's that over there?

1096
01:24:43,505 --> 01:24:45,325
I think they're graves.

1097
01:24:46,945 --> 01:24:48,184
Don't go near!

1098
01:24:48,671 --> 01:24:49,731
Why not?

1099
01:24:50,664 --> 01:24:52,397
What if a ghost jumps out?

1100
01:24:52,439 --> 01:24:55,216
Graves don't have ghosts.
Only skeletons.

1101
01:25:12,934 --> 01:25:15,335
- There's something written here.
- Let's go!

1102
01:25:15,555 --> 01:25:16,555
Wait!

1103
01:25:40,350 --> 01:25:42,836
Anne! What does it say?

1104
01:25:51,023 --> 01:25:53,016
You must be strong now, children.

1105
01:25:53,019 --> 01:25:54,483
Nicholas, come here!

1106
01:25:55,824 --> 01:25:59,024
Mrs. Mills, please don't
tell mummy we've run away.

1107
01:25:59,027 --> 01:26:00,345
Don't speak to them!

1108
01:26:01,477 --> 01:26:03,344
- Why?
- They're dead!

1109
01:26:04,065 --> 01:26:06,845
- What?
- They're ghosts! Please come here!

1110
01:26:07,385 --> 01:26:08,385
Children!

1111
01:26:09,251 --> 01:26:10,251
Nicholas!

1112
01:26:11,891 --> 01:26:12,965
They're ghosts?

1113
01:26:12,968 --> 01:26:15,451
Why aren't they wearing sheets
and clanking chains?

1114
01:26:15,663 --> 01:26:17,718
- You said that...
- I don't care what I said!

1115
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,128
Get away from them!

1116
01:26:19,131 --> 01:26:22,159
You're always teasing me
and telling lies...

1117
01:26:22,473 --> 01:26:24,639
- And I'm sick of it!
- I'm not teasing you!

1118
01:26:24,641 --> 01:26:26,111
I'm telling the truth!

1119
01:26:26,406 --> 01:26:27,493
Come here!

1120
01:26:30,133 --> 01:26:31,133
Quick!

1121
01:26:33,001 --> 01:26:35,240
Mum! Mum!

1122
01:26:36,207 --> 01:26:37,207
Children!

1123
01:26:43,541 --> 01:26:44,541
Run!

1124
01:26:45,095 --> 01:26:46,095
Run!

1125
01:26:47,228 --> 01:26:48,828
Go! Into the house!

1126
01:26:51,975 --> 01:26:53,313
Don't come any closer!

1127
01:26:54,255 --> 01:26:55,255
Don't move!

1128
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:02,802
Don't trouble yourself, ma'am.

1129
01:27:02,923 --> 01:27:05,229
Tuberculosis finished us off...

1130
01:27:06,037 --> 01:27:07,970
More than half a century ago.

1131
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:29,719
Go away!

1132
01:27:36,312 --> 01:27:39,030
- Open the door, ma'am. Please.
- What do you want?

1133
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:42,126
Mummy, don't open the door.
Don't.

1134
01:27:42,245 --> 01:27:44,004
We've seen their graves.

1135
01:27:44,113 --> 01:27:45,446
Go upstairs and hide.

1136
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:48,200
- Go on.
- I'm scared.

1137
01:27:54,627 --> 01:27:55,827
Don't separate!

1138
01:28:03,575 --> 01:28:05,595
Whatever you do, don't separate.

1139
01:28:07,355 --> 01:28:10,148
Go hide. Go. Go!

1140
01:28:11,389 --> 01:28:13,742
We've been trying
to make you understand.

1141
01:28:16,809 --> 01:28:18,089
Understand what?

1142
01:28:18,092 --> 01:28:19,309
About the house.

1143
01:28:20,336 --> 01:28:22,229
About the new situation.

1144
01:28:23,130 --> 01:28:24,410
What situation?

1145
01:28:25,508 --> 01:28:28,769
We must all learn to live together,

1146
01:28:29,384 --> 01:28:31,170
the living and the dead.

1147
01:28:32,284 --> 01:28:33,464
If you're dead,

1148
01:28:34,285 --> 01:28:35,450
leave us in peace!

1149
01:28:37,017 --> 01:28:38,551
Leave us in peace!

1150
01:28:39,418 --> 01:28:40,971
Leave us in peace!

1151
01:28:46,992 --> 01:28:48,758
In here. Get inside.

1152
01:28:54,932 --> 01:28:56,799
And suppose we do leave you.

1153
01:28:57,346 --> 01:28:58,606
Do you think they will?

1154
01:28:59,666 --> 01:29:00,666
Who?

1155
01:29:00,799 --> 01:29:01,919
The intruders.

1156
01:29:03,513 --> 01:29:06,312
- There are no intruders.
- They took the curtains down.

1157
01:29:06,315 --> 01:29:09,514
- There are no intruders.
- Oh, yes, I assure you it was them.

1158
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:12,919
And now they're
in there with you...

1159
01:29:13,427 --> 01:29:14,653
and the children.

1160
01:29:14,927 --> 01:29:15,940
Waiting for you.

1161
01:29:16,247 --> 01:29:17,514
- No!
- Yes.

1162
01:29:18,284 --> 01:29:21,093
And believe me,
sooner or later...

1163
01:29:21,768 --> 01:29:23,050
they'll find you.

1164
01:29:24,028 --> 01:29:25,875
Listen, wait here,
and I'll be back in a minute.

1165
01:29:25,877 --> 01:29:28,828
No, no, no.
Mummy said we shouldn't separate.

1166
01:29:28,831 --> 01:29:30,909
We can't leave her on her own.

1167
01:29:35,529 --> 01:29:37,295
Stop breathing like that.

1168
01:29:45,283 --> 01:29:47,550
Nicholas,
stop breathing like that.

1169
01:29:50,811 --> 01:29:51,911
Stop breathing!

1170
01:29:54,637 --> 01:29:55,771
Can't you hear it?

1171
01:29:56,731 --> 01:29:57,931
There's someone there.

1172
01:30:01,918 --> 01:30:03,838
Come with us, children.

1173
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:06,738
Come with us.

1174
01:30:14,213 --> 01:30:15,213
Nicholas?

1175
01:30:17,939 --> 01:30:18,939
Anne?

1176
01:30:21,986 --> 01:30:23,106
Where are you?

1177
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:27,820
Answer me!

1178
01:30:28,281 --> 01:30:29,947
The intruders have found them.

1179
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:31,820
There's nothing we can do now.

1180
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:36,700
You'll have to go upstairs...
and talk to them.

1181
01:30:54,849 --> 01:30:57,569
Our father, who art in heaven...

1182
01:30:58,269 --> 01:30:59,616
Hallowed be thy name.

1183
01:31:00,483 --> 01:31:01,776
Thy kingdom come...

1184
01:31:02,343 --> 01:31:03,849
Thy will be done on earth...

1185
01:31:04,537 --> 01:31:05,936
As it is in heaven.

1186
01:31:07,344 --> 01:31:09,125
Give us this day our daily bread...

1187
01:31:09,657 --> 01:31:11,398
And forgive us our trespasses...

1188
01:31:14,198 --> 01:31:16,344
Why are you afraid, children?

1189
01:31:17,538 --> 01:31:20,611
Why don't you want us
to be your friends?

1190
01:31:22,871 --> 01:31:25,300
Come on. Speak to us.

1191
01:31:26,519 --> 01:31:28,225
Speak to us.

1192
01:31:32,838 --> 01:31:35,799
Tell me what happened.

1193
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:40,406
Don't tell her! Don't tell her!

1194
01:31:40,987 --> 01:31:43,613
"Don't tell her."

1195
01:31:44,886 --> 01:31:47,603
If I tell her,
they'll leave us in peace.

1196
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:51,241
Mummy!

1197
01:31:53,221 --> 01:31:54,221
"Mummy."

1198
01:31:55,067 --> 01:31:57,340
Why are you crying, children?

1199
01:31:58,854 --> 01:32:00,886
What happened in this room?

1200
01:32:02,255 --> 01:32:04,635
What did your mother do to you?

1201
01:32:17,463 --> 01:32:19,103
Something about a pillow.

1202
01:32:19,963 --> 01:32:22,249
Is that how she killed you?

1203
01:32:24,211 --> 01:32:25,331
With a pillow?

1204
01:32:25,597 --> 01:32:27,117
She didn't kill us!

1205
01:32:27,257 --> 01:32:29,010
Children, if you're dead...

1206
01:32:29,164 --> 01:32:31,830
Why do you remain in this house?

1207
01:32:31,832 --> 01:32:33,221
We're not dead!

1208
01:32:34,530 --> 01:32:38,185
- Why do you remain in this house?
- We're not dead!

1209
01:32:38,338 --> 01:32:40,574
- We're not dead!
- We're not dead!

1210
01:32:40,577 --> 01:32:41,840
We're not dead!

1211
01:32:41,907 --> 01:32:45,214
- We're not dead!
- Why do you remain in this house?

1212
01:32:46,138 --> 01:32:48,851
"We're not dead.
We're not dead."

1213
01:32:49,325 --> 01:32:51,505
- We're not dead!
- We're not dead!

1214
01:32:51,833 --> 01:32:53,220
We're not dead!

1215
01:32:54,659 --> 01:32:55,940
We're not dead!

1216
01:33:12,994 --> 01:33:14,228
Are you all right?

1217
01:33:14,668 --> 01:33:18,328
Yes.
Just a bit dizzy, that's all.

1218
01:33:20,361 --> 01:33:21,481
What happened?

1219
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:25,074
They made contact.

1220
01:33:25,789 --> 01:33:26,789
All three?

1221
01:33:27,422 --> 01:33:29,128
Apparently, yes.

1222
01:33:30,288 --> 01:33:32,355
The mother and the two children.

1223
01:33:34,055 --> 01:33:35,774
Quite interesting,
don't you think?

1224
01:33:35,990 --> 01:33:36,990
Interesting?

1225
01:33:37,636 --> 01:33:39,394
I was scared out of my wits!

1226
01:33:39,543 --> 01:33:41,063
- Darling, calm down.
- No.

1227
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:44,036
So far, we have handled
this matter your way.

1228
01:33:44,163 --> 01:33:45,742
But now you listen to me.

1229
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:48,076
We can't possibly stay
in this house any longer.

1230
01:33:48,482 --> 01:33:51,558
It is quite clear these beings
do not want us to live here.

1231
01:33:51,624 --> 01:33:53,231
We don't know anything
about them yet.

1232
01:33:53,234 --> 01:33:54,291
Yes, we do!

1233
01:33:55,311 --> 01:33:56,998
We know the woman went mad...

1234
01:33:57,071 --> 01:33:59,673
Smothered her two children,
and then shot herself.

1235
01:34:00,104 --> 01:34:02,946
That's quite enough.
Think of our son.

1236
01:34:03,191 --> 01:34:04,728
There's nothing wrong with Victor.

1237
01:34:04,731 --> 01:34:05,917
Yes, there is!

1238
01:34:06,423 --> 01:34:07,781
He has nightmares.

1239
01:34:07,819 --> 01:34:09,421
He says he has seen that girl.

1240
01:34:09,424 --> 01:34:11,863
And even this lady
has been possessed by her.

1241
01:34:12,206 --> 01:34:14,764
Please, let us leave this house.

1242
01:34:14,939 --> 01:34:15,939
All right.

1243
01:34:17,226 --> 01:34:19,119
We will leave tomorrow morning.

1244
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:21,619
Oh, thank God for that.

1245
01:34:23,834 --> 01:34:25,647
I'll just go and check on Victor.

1246
01:34:29,021 --> 01:34:31,330
Once again,
thank you so much for coming.

1247
01:34:31,333 --> 01:34:32,333
A pleasure.

1248
01:34:32,413 --> 01:34:34,094
I hope we've been of some help.

1249
01:34:34,141 --> 01:34:36,758
Oh, yes, of course.
Though I must admit...

1250
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:43,028
At first,
I couldn't understand...

1251
01:34:45,594 --> 01:34:48,095
what the pillow was doing in my hands...

1252
01:34:51,149 --> 01:34:52,829
or why you didn't move.

1253
01:34:57,910 --> 01:34:59,190
But then I knew.

1254
01:35:02,803 --> 01:35:04,083
It had happened.

1255
01:35:08,550 --> 01:35:10,337
I had killed my children.

1256
01:35:17,398 --> 01:35:18,678
I got the rifle.

1257
01:35:21,552 --> 01:35:23,232
I put it to my forehead.

1258
01:35:27,825 --> 01:35:29,419
Then I pulled the trigger.

1259
01:35:34,325 --> 01:35:35,325
Nothing.

1260
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:46,026
Then I heard your laughter
in the bedroom.

1261
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:53,921
You were playing with the pillows
as if nothing had happened.

1262
01:35:57,054 --> 01:35:58,200
And I thought...

1263
01:36:00,081 --> 01:36:02,807
The Lord in his great mercy...

1264
01:36:03,561 --> 01:36:04,808
was giving me...

1265
01:36:06,502 --> 01:36:07,814
another chance.

1266
01:36:09,382 --> 01:36:10,475
Telling me,

1267
01:36:12,249 --> 01:36:13,375
"don't give up."

1268
01:36:17,136 --> 01:36:18,176
"Be strong."

1269
01:36:20,683 --> 01:36:21,909
"Be a good mother."

1270
01:36:24,804 --> 01:36:25,804
"For them."

1271
01:36:30,277 --> 01:36:31,277
But now...

1272
01:36:35,264 --> 01:36:36,264
Now...

1273
01:36:40,184 --> 01:36:41,698
What does all this mean?

1274
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:47,839
Where are we?

1275
01:36:50,013 --> 01:36:52,052
Young Lydia said the very same thing...

1276
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:55,879
when she realized
the three of us were dead.

1277
01:36:57,393 --> 01:37:00,187
And that was the last time
she ever spoke.

1278
01:37:02,966 --> 01:37:05,140
But I couldn't tell you
that before now.

1279
01:37:10,327 --> 01:37:13,060
Shall I make us
a nice cup of tea, ma'am?

1280
01:37:17,628 --> 01:37:19,348
The intruders are leaving...

1281
01:37:19,841 --> 01:37:21,327
but others will come.

1282
01:37:22,056 --> 01:37:24,134
Now, sometimes we'll sense them.

1283
01:37:24,316 --> 01:37:26,515
Other times, we won't.

1284
01:37:28,228 --> 01:37:30,195
But that's the way it's always been.

1285
01:37:33,289 --> 01:37:34,289
Ma'am.

1286
01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:39,810
Mummy...

1287
01:37:41,129 --> 01:37:43,263
Daddy died in the war, didn't he?

1288
01:37:44,110 --> 01:37:45,110
Yes.

1289
01:37:45,384 --> 01:37:46,903
Will we ever see him again?

1290
01:37:47,924 --> 01:37:48,964
I don't know.

1291
01:37:50,930 --> 01:37:54,291
If we're dead, where's limbo?

1292
01:37:58,885 --> 01:38:01,278
I don't know if there even is a limbo.

1293
01:38:04,471 --> 01:38:06,305
I'm no wiser than you are.

1294
01:38:09,486 --> 01:38:11,353
But I do know that I love you.

1295
01:38:13,553 --> 01:38:15,233
I've always loved you.

1296
01:38:19,446 --> 01:38:21,532
And this house is ours.

1297
01:38:23,627 --> 01:38:24,854
You say it with me.

1298
01:38:26,794 --> 01:38:28,112
This house is ours.

1299
01:38:28,287 --> 01:38:30,413
- This house is ours.
- This house is ours.

1300
01:38:30,415 --> 01:38:31,834
This house is ours...

1301
01:38:52,296 --> 01:38:55,649
Mummy, look.
It doesn't hurt any more.

1302
01:39:06,883 --> 01:39:09,143
No one can make us leave this house.

1303
01:39:36,112 --> 01:39:37,506
Come along, Victor.
