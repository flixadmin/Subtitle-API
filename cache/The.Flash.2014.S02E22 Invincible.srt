1
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:02,945
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,947 --> 00:00:05,181
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,442 --> 00:00:07,541
To the outside world,

4
00:00:07,609 --> 00:00:09,726
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:12,729
But secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

6
00:00:12,731 --> 00:00:16,032
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

7
00:00:16,034 --> 00:00:18,068
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,905
but in doing so I opened up
our world to new threats.

9
00:00:21,907 --> 00:00:25,291
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

10
00:00:25,293 --> 00:00:28,244
I am The Flash.

11
00:00:28,246 --> 00:00:29,664
Previously on "The Flash"...

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,095
Welcome to Earth-2.

13
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:33,230
I met your doppelganger.
She's a cold-hearted

14
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:34,898
ice queen named Killer Frost.

15
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,984
- The name is Vibe.
- Reverb.

16
00:00:36,986 --> 00:00:39,770
My brothers and sisters,

17
00:00:39,772 --> 00:00:42,689
I've brought us to this new world,

18
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:45,025
ours for the taking!

19
00:00:45,027 --> 00:00:47,027
[shouting] Whose world is this?

20
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:50,280
[all chanting] Our world! Our world!

21
00:00:50,282 --> 00:00:53,117
Our world, our world!

22
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:58,705
[gunfire and zapping]

00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:15,772
Ah! [groans]

26
00:01:15,774 --> 00:01:17,641
- David!
- [groaning]

27
00:01:17,643 --> 00:01:19,776
Back door! Captain's down.

28
00:01:19,778 --> 00:01:22,029
Go, go, go, go, go!

29
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:23,981
[thudding]

30
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:25,282

31
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:30,154
Down, down! Down, get down!

00:01:34,043 --> 00:01:37,461

[gunfire, screaming stops]

34
00:01:45,588 --> 00:01:48,639
Some people are calling
it the metapocalypse,

35
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:52,176
the days when Central City
was overrun by an army

36
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,678
with powers beyond imagination.

37
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:58,182
But in these dark times,

38
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:01,101
we must never forget our own strength,

39
00:02:01,103 --> 00:02:04,238
our own power to fight back.

40
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,522
[keys clatter]

41
00:02:08,123 --> 00:02:10,073
That it is only in the blackest of nights

42
00:02:10,075 --> 00:02:13,460
that we can truly see the light...

43
00:02:13,462 --> 00:02:16,830
and know for sure we are not alone.

44
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:21,001
We are never... ever... alone.

46
00:02:26,975 --> 00:02:28,591
We usually take these guys
down one at a time,

47
00:02:28,593 --> 00:02:30,510
not 100 at a time.

48
00:02:30,512 --> 00:02:32,595
And yet, you don't seem overwhelmed.

49
00:02:32,597 --> 00:02:34,431
I know we can do it.

50
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:37,267
Guys. You have to come see this.

51
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:40,020
Cisco, what are you...

52
00:02:40,022 --> 00:02:41,354
Caitlin?

53
00:02:41,356 --> 00:02:44,024
[sighs] She's in shock.

54
00:02:44,026 --> 00:02:46,993
A little... dehydrated and malnourished,

55
00:02:46,995 --> 00:02:49,112
but I think she'll be fine.

56
00:02:50,032 --> 00:02:51,247
I'm okay.

57
00:02:51,249 --> 00:02:53,333
What happened? How did you get away?

58
00:02:53,335 --> 00:02:56,836
He... let me go.

59
00:02:56,838 --> 00:02:59,289
I didn't think he would;
I thought it was a trap.

60
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:02,542
But... he told me you were dead.

61
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:04,260
I'm not. I'm right here.

62
00:03:04,262 --> 00:03:07,597
We're all here, together.

63
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,215
Snow.

64
00:03:09,217 --> 00:03:10,467
Jay's not here.

65
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:12,552
You're safe.

66
00:03:12,554 --> 00:03:15,638
He's gonna overrun the city.
You can't stop him.

67
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,223
Yes, we can.

68
00:03:17,225 --> 00:03:19,309
Listen to me, he's not going to succeed.

69
00:03:19,311 --> 00:03:21,194
We've got this. This is our Earth.

70
00:03:21,196 --> 00:03:22,395
You don't know that.

71
00:03:22,397 --> 00:03:23,613
You don't know what he is capable of.

72
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:26,066
I know from being in the Speed Force

73
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:28,985
that the universe is with us, not Zoom.

74
00:03:28,987 --> 00:03:31,821
And if the universe is with us,
how could we possibly lose?

75
00:03:31,823 --> 00:03:33,323
Right, guys?

76
00:03:33,325 --> 00:03:34,908
Yeah, yeah, right.

77
00:03:37,212 --> 00:03:38,461
You've been through a lot.

78
00:03:38,463 --> 00:03:39,913
You should get some rest, come on.

79
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:43,166
You were in the Speed Force?

80
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:45,085
I... when you were gone.

81
00:03:45,087 --> 00:03:48,054
It's hard to explain, but we
tried to get my powers back

82
00:03:48,056 --> 00:03:50,423
and when the dark matter lightning...

83
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:52,258
Okay, I'm gonna say it.

84
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,895
Um, we don't think he's being
just a little too...

85
00:03:55,897 --> 00:03:57,313
Overconfident?

86
00:03:57,315 --> 00:03:59,399
Yeah, maybe it was
his time in the Speed Force.

87
00:03:59,401 --> 00:04:02,152
I mean, he's acting like he's
invincible now or something.

88
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:04,104
Yeah, like nothing fazes
him anymore, which isn't...

89
00:04:04,106 --> 00:04:05,822
Realistic, no.

90
00:04:05,824 --> 00:04:08,608
Somebody needs to talk to him
before letting his guard down

91
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,410
gets him hurt or worse.

92
00:04:10,412 --> 00:04:12,445
He did bring me out of my coma.

93
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:14,914
That's bound to make someone
a little overly chipper.

94
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:18,701
Well, like I said, somebody
needs to talk to him.

95
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:20,810
Amazing job, Anupam.

96
00:04:20,812 --> 00:04:23,196
This is exactly the kind of
groundbreaking thinking

97
00:04:23,198 --> 00:04:25,315
I built this company for.

98
00:04:25,317 --> 00:04:26,733
Well done.

She's out like a light, huh?

109
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,783
Yeah.

110
00:05:16,785 --> 00:05:18,751
Jay really did a number on her.

111
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:20,286
It's not like he

112
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:24,590
exactly used kid gloves on the rest of us.

113
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:27,093
She'll be okay. She just needs time.

114
00:05:27,095 --> 00:05:29,462
And for us to finally bring Zoom down.

115
00:05:29,464 --> 00:05:31,297
Which we will.

116
00:05:31,299 --> 00:05:35,435
Yeah, because the universe
is with us, right?

117
00:05:36,855 --> 00:05:37,937

Hey. You okay?

- You just vibe?
- Yeah.

00:05:59,494 --> 00:06:01,711
What'd you see?

125
00:06:01,713 --> 00:06:04,580
I saw a bird.

00:06:04,582 --> 00:06:06,299

Boom.

137
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:30,334
So how did you know?

138
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:31,835
- Your real identity?
- Yeah.

139
00:07:31,837 --> 00:07:33,120
Come on, Barry, I'm a scientist.

140
00:07:33,122 --> 00:07:34,538
We're paid to be perceptive.

141
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,740
And you're always a little too well informed

142
00:07:36,742 --> 00:07:39,343
when things go pear-shaped in this city.

143
00:07:39,345 --> 00:07:40,794
But I don't believe we've ever met before.

144
00:07:40,796 --> 00:07:42,262
Dr. Christina McGee.

145
00:07:42,264 --> 00:07:43,464
Doctor Henry Allen.

146
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:44,882
I'm Barry's father.

147
00:07:44,884 --> 00:07:46,133
Okay, now that the cat's out of the bag,

148
00:07:46,135 --> 00:07:47,434
did you happen to see who it was

149
00:07:47,436 --> 00:07:49,019
that cause your building to collapse?

150
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:50,971
I didn't see anything. It happened so fast.

151
00:07:50,973 --> 00:07:53,307
Maybe the security cameras caught something?

152
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:55,192
Can we access them?

153
00:07:55,194 --> 00:07:58,445
Mercury Labs does have a
Crash-Survivable Memory Unit.

154
00:07:58,447 --> 00:07:59,813
A what?

155
00:07:59,815 --> 00:08:02,032
Virtually a black box for buildings.

156
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:03,617
It will have stored all the security footage

157
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:05,369
right up until the building collapsed.

158
00:08:05,371 --> 00:08:06,954
Okay, great, I'll go find it.

159
00:08:06,956 --> 00:08:08,989
This wasn't some random meta-human.

160
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:11,291
Whenever Mercury Labs has been targeted

161
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:13,410
in the past there's always
been a specific reason.

162
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:15,462
Yeah, someone's after something.

163
00:08:15,464 --> 00:08:16,580
Yes, and that someone

164
00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:18,799
is probably Zoom.

165
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:20,718
There may be one more possibility.

166
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,636
A few months ago, I saw Harrison Wells

167
00:08:22,638 --> 00:08:24,338
running out of my facility.

168
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,507
I know it sounds crazy,

we're gonna stop Zoom's army.

Okay. Fair enough.

605
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:13,035
So all matter vibrates at
its own unique frequency, right?

606
00:28:13,037 --> 00:28:14,870
You disrupt that frequency,
you disrupt the matter.

607
00:28:14,872 --> 00:28:17,339
Like how an opera singer
shatters glass with her voice.

608
00:28:17,341 --> 00:28:18,957
Exactly. So we found out that

609
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:20,542
all Earth-2 people vibrate at their own,

610
00:28:20,544 --> 00:28:23,795
- more erratic frequency.
- Higher frequency.

611

- Different frequency.
- Higher.

612
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:28,300
- Higher frequency than we do.
- Right.

613
00:28:28,302 --> 00:28:30,552
So I ran this all past Hartley, right?

614
00:28:30,554 --> 00:28:32,938
And he postulated that
we could create a sort of

615
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,557

616
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:37,142
Okay, you didn't do it yourself.

617
00:28:37,144 --> 00:28:39,144
Just let me have this one, okay?

618
00:28:39,146 --> 00:28:40,612
- Have it, have it.
- Thank you.

619
00:28:40,614 --> 00:28:42,197
So if you run around the city

620
00:28:42,199 --> 00:28:44,483
fast enough to create a refracting field,

621
00:28:44,485 --> 00:28:46,618
the device can send out

622
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,036
a pulse

623
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:50,455
that'll bounce off of it, split apart,

624
00:28:50,457 --> 00:28:52,708
and collide with itself over and over.

625
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:55,577
Amplifying it to an erratic
frequency on the Earth-2...

626
00:28:55,579 --> 00:28:57,162
- Higher. Higher frequency.
- Higher frequency

627
00:28:57,164 --> 00:28:58,664
on the Earth-2 spectrum.

628
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:00,666
And when that pulse
hits anyone from Earth-2...

629
00:29:00,668 --> 00:29:02,718
It'll disrupt their nervous system.

I just figured that since Henry
is officially back for good,

834
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,343
we should celebrate.

835
00:38:29,345 --> 00:38:32,229
And since Zoom is gone
and the city is quiet right now.

836
00:38:32,231 --> 00:38:34,849
Oh, I appreciate it, Iris.

837
00:38:34,851 --> 00:38:36,767
Thank you.

838
00:38:36,769 --> 00:38:39,186
- Hi, Tina.
- Hello, Henry.

839
00:38:39,188 --> 00:38:41,022
- Jesse.
- Hi.

840
00:38:42,992 --> 00:38:44,025
Good to see you.

841
00:38:44,027 --> 00:38:45,943
Good to see you too.

842
00:38:45,945 --> 00:38:48,112
- You look... great.
- Thank you.

843
00:38:48,114 --> 00:38:51,866
I hope you don't mind
that I invited Dr. McGee.

844
00:38:51,868 --> 00:38:54,168
Seems like somebody's glad you did.

845
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,669
Mm-hmm.

846
00:38:56,873 --> 00:38:59,373
So I guess you are invincible.

847
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:00,791
- Told you.
- [chuckles]

848
00:39:00,793 --> 00:39:02,460
The Speed Force is with us.

849
00:39:05,048 --> 00:39:06,964
Since I'm

850
00:39:06,966 --> 00:39:10,885
feeling extra invincible lately,

851
00:39:10,887 --> 00:39:12,553
what do you say

852
00:39:12,555 --> 00:39:15,856
you and I

853
00:39:15,858 --> 00:39:19,110
give this a shot?

854
00:39:19,112 --> 00:39:20,561
Yeah, I would like that.

855
00:39:25,535 --> 00:39:27,568
So is it true?

856
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:30,071
You saved The Flash's life?

857
00:39:30,073 --> 00:39:31,539
Oh, I mean, I was

858
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:33,657
just in the right place at the right time.

859
00:39:33,659 --> 00:39:35,493
Proud of you, Wally.

860
00:39:35,495 --> 00:39:37,795
You did good.

861
00:39:37,797 --> 00:39:39,330
Thanks, dad.

862
00:39:39,332 --> 00:39:41,632
- [laughs]
- What?

863
00:39:41,634 --> 00:39:43,551
I'm just... I'm proud of you too.

864
00:39:43,553 --> 00:39:45,669
- Soup's on.
- Hey!

865
00:39:45,671 --> 00:39:47,171
Taking out a city full of monsters

866
00:39:47,173 --> 00:39:49,223
makes a man hungry.

867
00:39:49,225 --> 00:39:51,759
First,

868
00:39:51,761 --> 00:39:53,761
a toast.

869
00:39:53,763 --> 00:39:55,012
To family.

870
00:39:55,014 --> 00:39:56,847
To family.

871
00:39:56,849 --> 00:39:58,399
That's my kind of toast, short and sweet.

872
00:39:58,401 --> 00:40:00,901
- Let's eat.
- [laughs]

873
00:40:00,903 --> 00:40:05,606
[dramatic music oscillates]

874
00:40:05,608 --> 00:40:07,525
Oh. You guys.

875
00:40:07,527 --> 00:40:08,776
Great.

876
00:40:08,778 --> 00:40:11,862
[overlapping screams]

877
00:40:11,864 --> 00:40:13,781
Earth-2.

878
00:40:13,783 --> 00:40:16,617
[epic music]

879
00:40:18,955 --> 00:40:21,122
[dramatic music oscillates]

880
00:40:23,292 --> 00:40:25,709
Cisco?

881
00:40:25,711 --> 00:40:28,462
What... What is it?

882
00:40:28,464 --> 00:40:29,763
What'd you see?

883
00:40:29,765 --> 00:40:31,799
What do you mean "see"?

884
00:40:31,801 --> 00:40:33,217
Cisco gets visions.

885
00:40:33,219 --> 00:40:34,301
I don't understand.

886
00:40:34,303 --> 00:40:36,303
What Cisco?

887
00:40:36,305 --> 00:40:39,140
Earth-2 splitting in half.

888
00:40:39,142 --> 00:40:41,142
Straight down to the poles.

889
00:40:41,144 --> 00:40:42,977
Tell me I didn't just vibe the future.

890
00:40:42,979 --> 00:40:44,445
Please tell me I did not

891
00:40:44,447 --> 00:40:46,981
just see the end of the world!

892
00:40:48,484 --> 00:40:49,867
[foreboding music pounds]

893
00:40:55,324 --> 00:40:57,575
Our story continues,

894
00:40:57,577 --> 00:40:59,994
Flash.

895
00:41:02,748 --> 00:41:05,799
- Henry!
- Oh, my God.

896
00:41:05,801 --> 00:41:08,669
[dramatic violin music]

897
00:41:13,676 --> 00:41:15,559
Dad?

898
00:41:15,561 --> 00:41:17,011
Dad?

899
00:41:20,266 --> 00:41:23,017
It's poetic, returning
to your childhood home.

900
00:41:24,237 --> 00:41:26,020
Jay.

901
00:41:26,022 --> 00:41:28,189
Don't do this.

902
00:41:28,191 --> 00:41:29,523
I'm begging you.

903
00:41:29,525 --> 00:41:31,158
I'm begging you! Take me.

904
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,027
- Kill me!
- No!

905
00:41:33,029 --> 00:41:35,029
You still won't believe me
that you and I are the same.

906
00:41:35,031 --> 00:41:37,748
- Come on.
- Barry, look at me, son.

907
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,668
So I'm gonna have to make you believe me.

908
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:43,003
Whatever happens you have made me

909
00:41:43,005 --> 00:41:45,589
- the happiest father...
- Dad...

910
00:41:45,591 --> 00:41:47,508
This time, you're gonna
watch your parent die

911
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,709
just like I did.

912
00:41:48,711 --> 00:41:50,177
- No, no!
- And this

913
00:41:50,179 --> 00:41:51,095
is what's gonna make you

914
00:41:51,097 --> 00:41:52,846
just like me!

915
00:41:52,848 --> 00:41:54,048
Your mother and I love...

916
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,099
- Jay!
- [groans]

917
00:41:55,101 --> 00:41:56,249
No!

918
00:42:01,457 --> 00:42:03,400
