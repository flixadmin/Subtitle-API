1
00:00:00,807 --> 00:00:02,194
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:02,844 --> 00:00:04,678
Tibetan pit viper
venom.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,891
A constant dose of that
can't be good for you, right?

4
00:00:06,972 --> 00:00:08,761
It'll keep him sedated
like it did Slade.

5
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:11,751
No mention on
Isabel Rochev's death?

6
00:00:12,205 --> 00:00:13,971
Not a thing.

7
00:00:14,636 --> 00:00:16,703
Choose. Choose!

8
00:00:16,705 --> 00:00:18,605
No! No!

9
00:00:18,607 --> 00:00:20,483
No, mom! Mom,
what are you doing?

10
00:00:20,484 --> 00:00:23,085
Both my children will live.

11
00:00:23,087 --> 00:00:24,252
What are
you doing?!

12
00:00:24,254 --> 00:00:27,689
You possess true courage.

13
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:30,826
No!

14
00:00:32,462 --> 00:00:35,497
There is still one person
who has to die...

15
00:00:35,499 --> 00:00:38,500
Before this can end.

16
00:00:38,502 --> 00:00:40,068
- No...
- Mom?!

17
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:51,313
I do solemnly swear

18
00:00:51,315 --> 00:00:53,014
that I will support,

19
00:00:53,016 --> 00:00:57,586
defend, and abide by
the Starling City charter.

20
00:01:16,339 --> 00:01:18,640
And that I will faithfully

21
00:01:18,642 --> 00:01:21,042
discharge the duties
of the office

22
00:01:21,044 --> 00:01:23,578
of mayor of Starling City.

23
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:39,361
That I will tirelessly
pursue justice on behalf

24
00:01:39,363 --> 00:01:41,463
of all of starling's
citizens...

25
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:44,833
Impartially,

26
00:01:44,835 --> 00:01:48,336
to the best of my abilities.

27
00:01:48,338 --> 00:01:50,405
So help me God.

28
00:01:52,543 --> 00:01:54,009
Thank you.

29
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:07,189
Thea.

30
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:09,858
Hi.

31
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,560
I'm here for you.

32
00:02:11,562 --> 00:02:13,862
I know.

33
00:02:15,465 --> 00:02:17,499
Ms. Queen.

34
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:21,970
I wanted to offer my sincere
condolences on your loss.

35
00:02:21,972 --> 00:02:24,339
Your mother was a good woman.

36
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:26,041
She would have made
a wonderful mayor.

37
00:02:26,043 --> 00:02:28,210
Thank you.

38
00:02:28,212 --> 00:02:30,045
I'd love to speak with Oliver.

39
00:02:30,047 --> 00:02:31,980
Well, if you see him,

40
00:02:31,982 --> 00:02:34,349
tell him he missed his
own mother's funeral.

41
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,921
No one's seen Oliver
for a few days.

42
00:02:39,923 --> 00:02:42,657
We all deal with grief
in different ways.

43
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:45,193
And the loss of a parent is...

44
00:02:46,864 --> 00:02:49,130
Well, it changes you.

45
00:02:49,132 --> 00:02:51,566
When you realize that your
ancestors now look to you;

46
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:55,370
that your family's legacy,
their continuing works,

47
00:02:55,372 --> 00:02:57,572
are solely in your hands.

48
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:01,243
If you see Oliver,
please tell him that I came by.

49
00:03:01,245 --> 00:03:03,278
Of course.

50
00:03:13,023 --> 00:03:15,156
Hey.

51
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:17,125
Thanks.

52
00:03:19,295 --> 00:03:22,197
I don't even know
why I'm crying.

53
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,066
I didn't even
like Moira.

54
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:28,870
Terrible thing to say about
someone after they've just died.

55
00:03:28,872 --> 00:03:32,140
In my defense,
she was not nice.

56
00:03:33,276 --> 00:03:36,811
She was diabolical.

57
00:03:36,813 --> 00:03:40,549
Not a word you often
hear at someone's funeral.

58
00:03:40,551 --> 00:03:42,884
You're not crying for her, Felicity,
you're crying for Oliver.

59
00:03:42,886 --> 00:03:45,987
Where is he?

60
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:48,723
How could he
not be here?

61
00:03:48,725 --> 00:03:49,891
I don't know.

62
00:03:49,893 --> 00:03:52,460
If Oliver's smart...

63
00:03:52,462 --> 00:03:55,397
He ran back to his
island to hide.

64
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,901
But maybe he'll attend
your funerals.

65
00:04:10,846 --> 00:04:14,349
I always loved
this photograph.

66
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:18,853
I thought your mother
looked particularly beautiful.

67
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:20,722
Well, she didn't.

68
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:22,524
She thought
she looked bug-eyed.

69
00:04:22,526 --> 00:04:26,695
She never said.

70
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,599
How are you holding up?
I'm not.

71
00:04:33,235 --> 00:04:36,871
Your mother gave her
life for you, Thea.

72
00:04:36,873 --> 00:04:39,474
She showed you how much
she loved you in ways

73
00:04:39,476 --> 00:04:41,610
very few parents
ever could.

74
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:42,644
I know.

75
00:04:42,646 --> 00:04:45,747
She died thinking
I hated her.

76
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:49,317
But all we ever needed
was the truth.

77
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,586
It was a lie
that killed her.

78
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:53,188
I don't understand.

79
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,256
Slade Wilson.

80
00:04:55,258 --> 00:04:58,660
He was on that
island with Oliver.

81
00:04:58,662 --> 00:05:03,031
And despises him
for some reason.

82
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:07,002
There was a psychopath
in our lives

83
00:05:07,004 --> 00:05:09,704
and my brother never
warned us about him.

84
00:05:09,706 --> 00:05:13,942
Thea, your brother loves you
more than life itself.

85
00:05:16,112 --> 00:05:19,414
You should
keep that photo.

86
00:05:43,072 --> 00:05:45,807
This sub is over
60 years old.

87
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:49,544
It was carrying the Mirakuru during
the war when it ran aground.

88
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,584
Blood.

89
00:05:56,586 --> 00:05:57,886
Slade's.

90
00:05:57,888 --> 00:06:01,423
He was bleeding out, dying.

91
00:06:01,425 --> 00:06:04,959
Until we decided
to give him the Mirakuru.

92
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:07,062
Not one of your
better ideas.

93
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:09,030
What about my idea
for you to fix this sub?

94
00:06:09,032 --> 00:06:11,032
You were in the Navy.
The Russian Navy.

95
00:06:11,034 --> 00:06:12,967
They taught us how
to sink Japanese sub, not pilot them.

96
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:14,903
Anatoly, please.

97
00:06:14,905 --> 00:06:17,105
I know it's a long shot,
but if we get this sub operational,

98
00:06:17,107 --> 00:06:19,474
we can blow Slade
and the Mirakuru out of the water

99
00:06:19,476 --> 00:06:21,443
and get the hell
off of this island.

100
00:06:21,445 --> 00:06:24,245
I mean, unless
you have a better idea,

101
00:06:24,247 --> 00:06:26,347
this is our only chance
of getting home.

102
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:29,484
Ok. I try.

103
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:34,456
No one has seen Slade Wilson since
the night of the attack.

104
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,491
I mean, he hasn't made any further
threats on the Queen family,

105
00:06:36,493 --> 00:06:38,593
but we got to find
this son of a--

106
00:06:39,929 --> 00:06:41,663
Excuse me. Hey.

107
00:06:41,665 --> 00:06:43,298
Missed you
at the reception.

108
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,933
Yeah. I had to get back here,

109
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:46,473
see what was happening
with the case.

110
00:06:46,498 --> 00:06:47,570
Any leads?

111
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:49,637
No. Wilson's a ghost.

112
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,659
He's not the only one
who's disappeared.

113
00:06:50,684 --> 00:06:52,041
You heard from your sister?

114
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:55,110
Nothing apart from a text that
she needed a change of scenery.

115
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:59,013
Something else on your mind?

116
00:06:59,015 --> 00:07:01,883
It's Sebastian Blood.

117
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:03,785
There's something that
doesn't seem right.

118
00:07:03,787 --> 00:07:07,122
Laurel...
Dad, I know what you're thinking.

119
00:07:07,124 --> 00:07:10,125
When I accused him
of killing his father, I was upset.

120
00:07:10,127 --> 00:07:11,693
But just because
I had a problem

121
00:07:11,695 --> 00:07:13,561
doesn't mean
I was wrong about Sebastian.

122
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:16,064
Please, don't go down
this road again, ok?

123
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:18,466
What's bringing this on?

124
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:20,268
I saw him
at the reception.

125
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,871
And it struck me that the only reason
that he's mayor now

126
00:07:22,873 --> 00:07:24,806
is because Moira
was killed.

127
00:07:24,808 --> 00:07:26,007
Yeah, by Slade Wilson.

128
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:27,308
What if there's
a connection?

129
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,710
You once told me,

130
00:07:28,712 --> 00:07:30,645
a cop is only as
good as his gut.

131
00:07:30,647 --> 00:07:32,580
Well, I'm the daughter
of a cop,

132
00:07:32,582 --> 00:07:36,151
and I know in my gut Sebastian is not
the man that you think he is.

133
00:07:36,153 --> 00:07:37,719
You sure?

134
00:07:37,721 --> 00:07:39,754
Baby, last time...

135
00:07:39,756 --> 00:07:41,021
I was a drunk.

136
00:07:41,046 --> 00:07:43,025
And you were right
not to trust me.

137
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,627
But, Dad...

138
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:48,797
I need you
to trust me now.

139
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:51,699
This legislation
is the first step

140
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:55,003
toward making Starling City
the jewel that it once was.

141
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:57,939
The jewel that
it can be again.

142
00:07:57,941 --> 00:08:02,377
Phone call for you,
mayor Blood.

143
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:05,346
I'm still getting used
to people calling me that, Alyssa.

144
00:08:05,348 --> 00:08:06,681
Please take a message.

145
00:08:06,683 --> 00:08:08,249
The caller insisted.

146
00:08:08,251 --> 00:08:10,218
He said he's your father.

147
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,387
That's impossible.

148
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:14,489
Never mind.

149
00:08:14,491 --> 00:08:17,458
I'll take it.

150
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:20,161
Hello?

151
00:08:20,163 --> 00:08:21,963
Hello, Sebastian.

152
00:08:21,965 --> 00:08:24,499
I'm sorry to bother you.
I just wanted to check in

153
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:26,601
and see how
your first day is going.

154
00:08:26,603 --> 00:08:28,336
Very well,
thank you.

155
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:30,305
But I'm a little
busy right now,

156
00:08:30,307 --> 00:08:31,739
so if you'll allow me
to call you back,

157
00:08:31,741 --> 00:08:33,508
I'll do that
as soon as I can.

158
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,044
I'm sure you have quite
a lot of business to attend to.

159
00:08:36,046 --> 00:08:39,747
You are the major
now, after all.

160
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:42,250
So get to work.

161
00:08:54,296 --> 00:08:56,664
We're almost
out of snake venom.

162
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,200
Seeing Roy like this
reminds me of Barry.

163
00:08:59,202 --> 00:09:01,402
And Barry reminds me
of S.T.A.R. Labs.

164
00:09:01,404 --> 00:09:04,405
S.T.A.R. Labs reminds me of the
Mirakuru cure that they're working on,

165
00:09:04,407 --> 00:09:07,942
which we could really
use...right now.

166
00:09:07,944 --> 00:09:12,113
Yeah, especially since Isabel Rochev
was clearly injected with the stuff.

167
00:09:12,115 --> 00:09:13,982
How do you know?
'Cause there's no other way

168
00:09:13,984 --> 00:09:15,850
she could be walking around
after being shot dead-on

169
00:09:15,852 --> 00:09:18,186
with a nine-millimeter
hollow point.

170
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,724
I've left about
a dozen messages for Oliver

171
00:09:22,726 --> 00:09:25,426
about Isabel being back.
No response.

172
00:09:25,428 --> 00:09:27,362
You have any luck finding him?

173
00:09:27,364 --> 00:09:30,098
Tons. All of it bad.

174
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,666
There's been
no activity

175
00:09:31,668 --> 00:09:33,701
on his passport,
cell phone,

176
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:36,804
or bank accounts--
what's left of them, anyhow.

177
00:09:36,806 --> 00:09:39,641
And facial recognition
hasn't spotted him in any airport,

178
00:09:39,643 --> 00:09:41,209
bus, or train station.

179
00:09:41,211 --> 00:09:42,777
Right.

180
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,345
What about Sara?

181
00:09:44,347 --> 00:09:46,214
Nothing either.

182
00:09:46,216 --> 00:09:48,783
Dig, people don't just go missing
like this, unless...

183
00:09:48,785 --> 00:09:50,885
Don't go there,
Felicity.

184
00:09:50,887 --> 00:09:53,388
What if she is?

185
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,491
What if Oliver is?

186
00:09:56,493 --> 00:09:58,026
Maybe the reason we can't
find him is because--

187
00:09:58,028 --> 00:10:00,528
He's alive, Felicity.

188
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,064
If he wasn't, Isabel Rochev
wouldn't be so shy

189
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:05,466
about rubbing it in our faces.
Believe me, he's alive.

190
00:10:05,468 --> 00:10:07,335
Well, I hope you have
some way on how to find him,

191
00:10:07,337 --> 00:10:10,271
because I am running out
of places to look and people to ask.

192
00:10:10,273 --> 00:10:13,741
I know who to ask.

193
00:10:19,315 --> 00:10:21,816
Thanks for agreeing to see us.

194
00:10:21,818 --> 00:10:24,052
Mr. Diggle.

195
00:10:24,054 --> 00:10:27,622
Thought I made it clear
after our last meeting.

196
00:10:27,624 --> 00:10:30,158
As far as A.R.G.U.S. is concerned,
you're out of favors.

197
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,994
I'm not asking
for myself, Amanda.

198
00:10:32,996 --> 00:10:35,897
I'm asking for everyone
in Starling City.

199
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:38,266
I need you
to find Oliver Queen.

200
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:42,291

Dig.

203
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:51,298
That computer's running
an XK-15 processor.

204
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,234
Felicity...

205
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:53,875
But that's not even
supposed to exist yet.

206
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:55,369
I want one.

207
00:10:55,371 --> 00:10:56,703
Let me know
what you find.

208
00:10:56,705 --> 00:10:58,171
I don't have time
to keep track

209
00:10:58,173 --> 00:10:59,473
of your friends,
Mr. Diggle.

210
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:01,174
We deal with
more pressing issues here.

211
00:11:01,176 --> 00:11:02,776
You don't understand.
Oliver's disappeared.

212
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:04,077
Maybe he needs
some time.

213
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,480
Or is it possible
that the two of you

214
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:08,115
simply haven't been looking in
the right place?

215
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:09,983
Did you try facial
recognition?

216
00:11:09,985 --> 00:11:11,551
Yes, I ran it three times.

217
00:11:11,553 --> 00:11:13,720
Amanda, please.

218
00:11:13,722 --> 00:11:18,025
Slade Wilson has an army
of men just like him.

219
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:20,594
How many men have been exposed
to the Mirakuru?

220
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,062
Enough to lay waste
to this city.

221
00:11:22,064 --> 00:11:23,697
We need to find Oliver
right now.

222
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:25,766
I'll see what I can do.

223
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,034
Have you
heard from Sara?

224
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:27,735
No.

225
00:11:27,736 --> 00:11:30,570
Can you just call Mandy and see if
she can cover the bar?

226
00:11:34,942 --> 00:11:36,743
Isabel Rochev.

227
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:39,413
I know who you are.

228
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:41,848
What can I do
for you, Ms. Rochev?

229
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,784
I'm sorry for
your loss, Thea.

230
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,453
Is that why you came here?

231
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,156
Offer me your condolences?

232
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:52,259
My condolences,

233
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:54,461
and to give you this.
It's a notice

234
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,463
to vacate the premises.

235
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,800
This club and the steel factory
in which its located

236
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,935
are all assets
of Queen Consolidated.

237
00:12:01,937 --> 00:12:04,971
No, you--you can't do this.
It's already done.

238
00:12:08,543 --> 00:12:11,144
How long do I have?

239
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:12,879
A couple days.

240
00:12:22,323 --> 00:12:24,725
Councilman Tyson
is asking about dinner.

241
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:26,193
I already have
plans tonight.

242
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:29,696
Hi. Excuse me,
I didn't mean to barge in.

243
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:31,998
It's just that nobody
was at your front desk, so...

244
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,301
Laurel, of course,
please come in.

245
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:36,369
Give us a moment.

246
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:37,971
Twice in two days.

247
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:39,439
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

248
00:12:39,441 --> 00:12:41,742
I wish I could say
that this was pleasure,

249
00:12:41,744 --> 00:12:43,677
but it's about a case.

250
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,979
I've barely moved in and people
are already asking me for favors.

251
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:47,514
I guess I really
have arrived.

252
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,417
You certainly have.

253
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:52,352
So tell me,
how can I help you?

254
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,888
Murphy vs. Dunleavy.

255
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,790
The state's charged
a real estate developer

256
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:58,658
for turning away
low-income tenants

257
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,761
based on his so-called
"morality."

258
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:03,997
Have a seat.
Let me guess.

259
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:06,166
Our dear fair
housing commissioner

260
00:13:06,168 --> 00:13:08,535
isn't willing to testify
as your expert witness.

261
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,470
Exactly.
And your predecessor

262
00:13:10,472 --> 00:13:12,072
wasn't willing to lean on him.

263
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:14,875
Well, lucky for you,
I'm not my predecessor.

264
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:18,111
You know, this actually
reminds me of one I had

265
00:13:18,113 --> 00:13:20,247
during my days
as a community organizer.

266
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:21,915
I was hoping that it would.

267
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:25,218
I've seen dozens
of cases like this at CNRI.

268
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,287
Well, it's a good thing we both
remember where we came from.

269
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:29,022
I'm happy to help.

270
00:13:29,024 --> 00:13:30,724
Thank you.

271
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:34,094
Laurel...

272
00:13:34,096 --> 00:13:37,130
I'm really glad you
got your job back at the DA's office.

273
00:13:37,132 --> 00:13:40,033
I look forward to us
working together for a long time.

274
00:13:40,035 --> 00:13:41,835
As do I.

275
00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:50,377
Is it working?

276
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:53,747
We're about to remote access
the computer right now.

277
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,682
I'll tell you this,
if you ever

278
00:13:55,684 --> 00:13:56,950
get tired of
practicing law,

279
00:13:56,952 --> 00:13:58,251
you'd make a pretty
decent spy.

280
00:13:58,253 --> 00:14:00,053
You guys have a warrant
for this, right?

281
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:01,855
Just...

282
00:14:01,857 --> 00:14:03,723
Terrific.

283
00:14:03,725 --> 00:14:05,625
Could you at least
tell me who's computer you bugged?

284
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:10,430
You're kidding.
I voted for him.

285
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,265
Yeah.
I need to know

286
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:14,568
if there's anything
incriminating in Blood's files.

287
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:18,271
What the hell, this is
a dead end job, anyway.

288
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:20,640
This all looks
pretty benign.

289
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:22,576
Lots of policy papers,

290
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:26,580
old documents transferred from
his campaign office.

291
00:14:26,582 --> 00:14:28,415
Draft press releases...

292
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:30,617
Wait, wait, wait,
click back.

293
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,886
"For immediate release--
my thoughts and prayers

294
00:14:32,888 --> 00:14:34,821
are with the Queen family
in the aftermath

295
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:37,390
of this unspeakable tragedy.

296
00:14:37,392 --> 00:14:39,559
So he worked up a press release
after Moira was killed.

297
00:14:39,561 --> 00:14:41,361
No, he didn't.
He wrote that

298
00:14:41,363 --> 00:14:43,496
the day before
Moira died.

299
00:14:43,498 --> 00:14:47,467
She's right.
Look at the timestamp.

300
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,035
Oh, my God.

301
00:14:49,037 --> 00:14:51,204
Sebastian knew Slade
was going to kill her.

302
00:14:52,907 --> 00:14:55,008
Is that the satellite
frequency communicator

303
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,577
TX50?

304
00:14:57,579 --> 00:14:59,112
Can I touch it?

305
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:01,248
I know that sounds
a little weird and creepy,

306
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,816
but I've never seen
one in real life.

307
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,652
It's classified equipment,
Ms. Smoak.

308
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,588
You must feel
very powerful...

309
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,624
Knowing everything
about everyone.

310
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:13,260
Not powerful in an evil
dictator Stalin way.

311
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:17,230
More of a...
Knowledge is power, way.

312
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:19,933
Ma'am.
We have something.

313
00:15:19,935 --> 00:15:22,469
I should have known.

314
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:23,670
What?

315
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,905
Oliver's at the lair

316
00:15:24,907 --> 00:15:26,673
from which he conducts
his operations.

317
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,208
But we were
just there.

318
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,377
Not that lair.

319
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:32,846
His other one.

320
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,322
Like riding bicycle.

321
00:15:42,324 --> 00:15:45,191
Underwater.

322
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:54,768
What's that sound?

323
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,803
We're stuck.

324
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:01,708
Like
Japanese were.

325
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,677
Submarines have
torpedoes, right?

326
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,679
Can we blast our way out?

327
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:07,314
I can see why you two
are made for each other.

328
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:09,549
You like
your explosions.

329
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:20,560
Chert voz'mi.

330
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,528
What?

331
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,396
These are Kaiten
torpedoes.

332
00:16:23,398 --> 00:16:25,799
Manually operated.

333
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:27,901
Someone needs to
steer from inside.

334
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,604
Okay, but then, how do they
get away from the explosion?

335
00:16:31,606 --> 00:16:34,040
They do not.

336
00:16:42,883 --> 00:16:46,052
Oliver.

337
00:16:51,993 --> 00:16:53,422
How did you find me?

338
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:54,495
Waller.

339
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:56,129
We were worried
about you.

340
00:16:56,131 --> 00:16:57,831
After you missed
your mother's funeral.

341
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,800
I'm sorry that I didn't go.

342
00:17:02,652 --> 00:17:04,358
I left for the cemetery.

343
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:08,208
But I ended up here.

344
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,609
Here is...

345
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:12,012
Here was a secondary facility

346
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:14,614
in case the foundry
was compromised.

347
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:19,652
But it became somewhere
that I could just go and...

348
00:17:19,654 --> 00:17:22,389
Be alone.

349
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,695
She's dead
because of me.

350
00:17:31,665 --> 00:17:35,969
Five years ago...

351
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:39,439
I could have cured Slade.

352
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:41,174
And that would have
prevented all of this.

353
00:17:41,176 --> 00:17:44,210
And now,

354
00:17:44,212 --> 00:17:48,715
all the people left
that I care about,

355
00:17:48,717 --> 00:17:51,351
we are all
in his crosshairs.

356
00:17:51,353 --> 00:17:54,120
It ends tonight.

357
00:17:54,122 --> 00:17:56,856
How?

358
00:17:56,858 --> 00:18:00,260
I turn myself over to Slade.

359
00:18:00,262 --> 00:18:03,329
I end this vendetta.

360
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:05,231
Oliver,
you think this ends

361
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:08,568
with you turning
yourself over to Slade?

362
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,237
Yes, I do.

363
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:14,541
After she was gone...

364
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:19,546
He told that
one more person had to die.

365
00:18:22,005 --> 00:18:24,397
And then it would end.

366
00:18:25,753 --> 00:18:29,823
This ends for Slade
when he kills me.

367
00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:31,724
I don't accept that.

368
00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:33,259
You shouldn't,
either.

369
00:18:33,261 --> 00:18:35,762
You can't just accept
things, Oliver.

370
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:37,997
If I had accepted
my life, I would be

371
00:18:37,999 --> 00:18:40,066
a cocktail waitress in
Vegas like my mother,

372
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:41,734
and I never would
have gone to college,

373
00:18:41,736 --> 00:18:43,403
and I never would have moved
a thousand miles away

374
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:45,538
to work at Queen Consolidated,
and I never would have

375
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,173
believed some
crazy guy in a hood

376
00:18:47,175 --> 00:18:49,336
when he told me I could be
more than just some IT girl.

377
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:55,241
Please don't do this.

378
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,680
Felicity...

379
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:03,578
Someone once told me

380
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:07,209
that the essence of heroism
is to die so others can live.

381
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:08,985
It's not that
simple, Oliver.

382
00:19:08,987 --> 00:19:11,755
Yes, it is.

383
00:19:11,757 --> 00:19:15,358
Slade's whole plan

384
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,962
was to take everything from me.

385
00:19:20,043 --> 00:19:22,677
He did.

386
00:19:23,122 --> 00:19:24,885
He wins.

387
00:19:27,426 --> 00:19:30,828
All that's left
is for me to die.

388
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,667
No, there has to be
another way.

389
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,675
There isn't.

390
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,038
Thea, please.
I understand you're upset.

391
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:00,139
This is an emotional time
for all of us.

392
00:20:00,141 --> 00:20:01,541
I'm not being
emotional.

393
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:04,010
I'm...I'm an orphan!

394
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:07,447
I'm a jobless
and homeless orphan.

395
00:20:07,449 --> 00:20:09,949
There's nothing
left for me here.

396
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:11,251
I'm here.

397
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:14,087
I thank you
for that, but...

398
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,990
Honestly, I need
to start over.

399
00:20:20,194 --> 00:20:23,696
Oliver.

400
00:20:23,698 --> 00:20:25,765
We missed you at the funeral.

401
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,534
And the reception.

402
00:20:27,536 --> 00:20:30,270
I'm sorry that I
couldn't be there.

403
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:33,106
What's
going on here?

404
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,208
Thea's thinking
of leaving Starling City.

405
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,344
No, I am leaving.

406
00:20:38,346 --> 00:20:42,282
Walter, could I speak to
my sister for a moment?

407
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:44,484
I'm sure you'll have
better luck.

408
00:20:47,555 --> 00:20:50,990
Ollie, please.
Just don't even try

409
00:20:50,992 --> 00:20:53,059
to convince me to stay.

410
00:20:53,061 --> 00:20:56,362
I won't. I think
it's a good idea.

411
00:20:56,364 --> 00:20:59,666
You should get
as far from Starling City

412
00:20:59,668 --> 00:21:02,035
as you possibly can.

413
00:21:02,037 --> 00:21:04,304
In our family,

414
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:07,240
out of you, me,
mom and dad,

415
00:21:07,242 --> 00:21:11,177
you are the best of us.

416
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:13,780
You have
the purest heart.

417
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,651
And I can't ever
have you lose that.

418
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,053
Ok?

419
00:21:20,055 --> 00:21:21,588
You promise me?

420
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,591
Ok.

421
00:21:31,065 --> 00:21:34,968
I know that I haven't always
been the best brother,

422
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:40,239
or friend, or whatever
you've needed me to be.

423
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:44,210
But there has not
been a day since you were born

424
00:21:44,212 --> 00:21:49,549
where I didn't cherish having
you as a sister.

425
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:55,455
I'll, um,

426
00:21:55,457 --> 00:21:59,359
get in touch when
I get settled somewhere.

427
00:22:18,345 --> 00:22:21,748
It's Oliver.

428
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,318
This ends now.

429
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,755
I'll be at the pier,
I'll be alone.

430
00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:38,064
I'll do it.

431
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:41,000
Peter, you'll die.

432
00:22:41,002 --> 00:22:43,536
I'm already dead.

433
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,742
Radiation poisoning.

434
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:52,045
Ivo's little gift.

435
00:22:52,047 --> 00:22:55,815
He said he needed to find out
if Mirakuru could cure cancer.

436
00:22:55,817 --> 00:22:58,251
Guess we'll
never find out.

437
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:00,353
Oh, I'm sorry, Peter,
I didn't know.

438
00:23:00,355 --> 00:23:04,791
Ivo said the essence of heroism
is to die so that others can live.

439
00:23:04,793 --> 00:23:07,126
I held on to that.

440
00:23:07,128 --> 00:23:10,129
It's the only thing
that gave me hope.

441
00:23:10,131 --> 00:23:11,864
So I'll go.

442
00:23:11,866 --> 00:23:14,033
I mean, I may not
be saving millions of lives,

443
00:23:14,035 --> 00:23:15,802
but I'll be
saving yours.

444
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:29,582
This is where
it all started.

445
00:23:29,584 --> 00:23:33,720
Got on the "Queen's Gambit"
right over there.

446
00:23:35,889 --> 00:23:39,859
I should have died
on that boat.

447
00:23:39,861 --> 00:23:43,629
If I had, none of this
would have happened.

448
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:47,467
I never would have met you.

449
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:51,437
Shado and my mother
would still be alive.

450
00:23:55,709 --> 00:23:58,945
No one else is going
to die because of me.

451
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,751
Aah!

452
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:24,070
Diggle, what the hell?

453
00:24:35,178 --> 00:24:38,780
Slade Wilson.

454
00:24:38,782 --> 00:24:40,349
He told me
who you were.

455
00:24:40,351 --> 00:24:42,617
Did he hurt you?

456
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:44,019
No.

457
00:24:44,021 --> 00:24:45,754
He was trying
to hurt you.

458
00:24:45,756 --> 00:24:48,357
And when
you went missing,

459
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:49,858
I reached out...

460
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,128
to your partners.

461
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,763
They told me what you
were planning on doing.

462
00:24:54,765 --> 00:24:56,598
It's what I have to do.

463
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,267
Will you give us
a moment?

464
00:25:10,646 --> 00:25:13,415
You thought about
telling me...

465
00:25:13,417 --> 00:25:16,952
The night
of the Undertaking.

466
00:25:16,954 --> 00:25:20,122
I thought about telling you
almost every night.

467
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:24,559
Why didn't you?

468
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:28,363
Tommy knew.

469
00:25:28,365 --> 00:25:30,799
Didn't he?

470
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:32,801
You were with him.

471
00:25:32,803 --> 00:25:35,170
You were with him
at the end.

472
00:25:35,172 --> 00:25:37,172
His last words
were about you.

473
00:25:37,174 --> 00:25:39,674
He wanted to know
if you were safe.

474
00:25:39,676 --> 00:25:43,311
Sorry I couldn't
save him.

475
00:25:43,313 --> 00:25:46,181
And my mother.

476
00:25:48,151 --> 00:25:51,219
But I can save you.

477
00:25:51,221 --> 00:25:53,822
And Thea.

478
00:25:53,824 --> 00:25:57,726
I can save the city
if this ends tonight.

479
00:25:57,728 --> 00:25:59,494
No.

480
00:25:59,496 --> 00:26:01,696
No!

481
00:26:01,698 --> 00:26:04,199
You can't commit
suicide, Ollie.

482
00:26:04,201 --> 00:26:06,034
You won't do that to me.

483
00:26:06,036 --> 00:26:08,336
Or to Sara,
or to your friends.

484
00:26:08,338 --> 00:26:11,006
Or to Thea.
Oliver...

485
00:26:11,008 --> 00:26:13,175
She just lost
her mother.

486
00:26:13,177 --> 00:26:16,211
Losing you
would destroy her.

487
00:26:16,213 --> 00:26:18,647
But she'll be alive.

488
00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:22,717
I don't know anything about hoods
and masks or human weapons

489
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:24,886
or any of this.

490
00:26:24,888 --> 00:26:27,989
But I know you.

491
00:26:27,991 --> 00:26:30,192
I know you like
I know my own name.

492
00:26:30,194 --> 00:26:32,494
And I realize it may
sound crazy in light of your secret,

493
00:26:32,496 --> 00:26:36,531
but I know who you are
in your bones, Oliver.

494
00:26:36,533 --> 00:26:38,066
And that person--

495
00:26:38,068 --> 00:26:40,102
that person
doesn't give up.

496
00:26:40,104 --> 00:26:44,106
That person,
he always finds a way.

497
00:26:44,108 --> 00:26:47,075
Not this time.

498
00:26:47,077 --> 00:26:49,578
You're wrong.

499
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,447
You want to protect
the people who you love?

500
00:26:52,449 --> 00:26:55,750
Then the only way
to do that is to stop Slade Wilson.

501
00:26:55,752 --> 00:26:57,385
Laurel, I can't!
Yes, you can!

502
00:26:57,387 --> 00:26:59,821
By stopping Sebastian Blood,
because Sebastian

503
00:26:59,823 --> 00:27:02,257
is working
with Slade Wilson.

504
00:27:07,463 --> 00:27:09,865
I have proof.

505
00:27:09,867 --> 00:27:11,867
Slade Wilson
killed your mother

506
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:14,936
so that Sebastian
could become mayor.

507
00:27:17,807 --> 00:27:20,575
You were right about him.

508
00:27:22,044 --> 00:27:27,215
The man in the skull mask
works for Slade Wilson.

509
00:27:27,217 --> 00:27:29,951
And this entire time,

510
00:27:29,953 --> 00:27:32,954
it was Sebastian.

511
00:27:39,128 --> 00:27:41,663
What's happening

512
00:27:41,665 --> 00:27:44,799
is bigger
than you and Slade.

513
00:27:44,801 --> 00:27:48,303
This city needs
the Arrow.

514
00:28:00,383 --> 00:28:02,417
What's this for?

515
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:03,919
I don't want you
to be in here.

516
00:28:03,921 --> 00:28:05,954
No, I'm going to stay with you--
Sara.

517
00:28:05,956 --> 00:28:07,656
If this doesn't work,

518
00:28:07,658 --> 00:28:09,925
I need you to be safe.

519
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:16,431
We will come for you
when it's over.

520
00:28:16,433 --> 00:28:18,800
Ok.

521
00:28:22,271 --> 00:28:26,308
Do you know how
the torpedo works?

522
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:30,278
I get in, he fires,
I steer, you pray.

523
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,314
Peter, what
you're doing is...

524
00:28:32,316 --> 00:28:33,815
Practical.

525
00:28:33,817 --> 00:28:35,650
My time's already up.

526
00:28:35,652 --> 00:28:37,953
Brave.

527
00:28:37,955 --> 00:28:40,188
You need to know that.

528
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,724
And I don't think that I could do
something like this.

529
00:28:42,726 --> 00:28:45,293
You have. What you did for us--

530
00:28:45,295 --> 00:28:48,263
coming back to that boat,
setting us free?

531
00:28:48,265 --> 00:28:50,999
I came back to the boat
because I want to go home.

532
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:54,102
I wasn't thinking
about saving anybody.

533
00:28:54,104 --> 00:28:55,837
It's...It's not
who I am.

534
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:59,274
Maybe not yet.

535
00:29:17,627 --> 00:29:19,894
Go?
Is Sara clear?

536
00:29:19,896 --> 00:29:22,364
Yes.
Yes.

537
00:29:48,057 --> 00:29:50,992
Hello. Good
to see you.

538
00:29:50,994 --> 00:29:53,528
Clinton. You can
wait in the car.

539
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,063
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

540
00:29:55,065 --> 00:29:57,499
Nothing's going
to happen to me here.

541
00:29:57,501 --> 00:29:59,034
How are you doing,
Mr. Mayor?

542
00:29:59,036 --> 00:30:00,802
Hi. Good to see you,
good to see you.

543
00:30:00,804 --> 00:30:02,203
Congratulations, mayor Blood.

544
00:30:02,205 --> 00:30:03,405
Thank you.

545
00:30:03,407 --> 00:30:04,572
Mayor Blood, hello!

546
00:30:04,574 --> 00:30:05,940
Hi.

547
00:30:05,942 --> 00:30:07,742
We're all behind you,
Sebastian.

548
00:30:07,744 --> 00:30:09,878
Nice to see you.

549
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,214
Sebastian,
may I join you for dinner?

550
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:24,793
Hey,
can you hold that?

551
00:30:24,795 --> 00:30:31,566
Oh, thanks a lot,
man, appreciate it.

552
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,438
Clinton Hogue.

553
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,041
I have some
questions for you.

554
00:30:42,678 --> 00:30:44,779
Go to hell.

555
00:30:44,781 --> 00:30:46,481
You sure that's how
you want to play it?

556
00:30:46,483 --> 00:30:49,451
You think I've never
took a beating before?

557
00:30:50,853 --> 00:30:53,455
Pal, you're going
to wish I beat you.

558
00:30:53,457 --> 00:30:56,524
Hi.

559
00:30:56,526 --> 00:30:58,526
I'll be
your interrogator.

560
00:30:58,528 --> 00:31:00,428
Is this a joke?
Clinton Hogue.

561
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:03,431
Social Security
number 306003894.

562
00:31:03,433 --> 00:31:04,799
What the hell's
this supposed to be?

563
00:31:04,801 --> 00:31:06,868
Oh, look at this.

564
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,771
You have a bank account
in the Cayman Islands.

565
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,774
Wow.

566
00:31:12,776 --> 00:31:15,910
$2 million, quite
the little nest egg.

567
00:31:15,912 --> 00:31:18,179
But...Looks like you just

568
00:31:18,181 --> 00:31:21,616
approved a wire transfer of $1 million
to a charity here in Starling City.

569
00:31:21,618 --> 00:31:24,285
Very generous.

570
00:31:24,287 --> 00:31:25,887
What should I do with the rest?

571
00:31:25,889 --> 00:31:28,323
Greenpeace.
Great cause!

572
00:31:28,325 --> 00:31:31,960
And they really
appreciate the support.

573
00:31:31,962 --> 00:31:33,128
You bitch!

574
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,662
Bitch with WiFi.

575
00:31:34,664 --> 00:31:37,065
Hey, Clinton, looks like
your mom and dad have

576
00:31:37,067 --> 00:31:39,200
a really nice
retirement portfolio, too,

577
00:31:39,202 --> 00:31:41,461
but they, oh, no, are just

578
00:31:41,486 --> 00:31:43,446
about to make some really
bad investments.

579
00:31:43,673 --> 00:31:46,875
Ok, wait, just
wait--just--stop!

580
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:51,012
What do you want to know?

581
00:31:52,348 --> 00:31:53,748
I missed you

582
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,116
at your mother's
memorial service.

583
00:31:55,118 --> 00:31:58,086
I wanted to offer
my condolences.

584
00:31:58,088 --> 00:32:00,388
You're the mayor.

585
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:02,891
Congratulations.

586
00:32:02,893 --> 00:32:04,993
You've always wanted that.

587
00:32:04,995 --> 00:32:08,897
Believe me, Oliver, I wish it
had happened a different way.

588
00:32:08,899 --> 00:32:11,900
Your mother and I,
we--we didn't agree on much.

589
00:32:11,902 --> 00:32:15,069
But we both wanted
what was best for Starling City.

590
00:32:15,071 --> 00:32:19,307
I will help this city find its
heart again, I promise you that.

591
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:23,812
Do you really think that he...

592
00:32:23,814 --> 00:32:26,614
Will let that happen?

593
00:32:28,017 --> 00:32:30,218
Slade Wilson.

594
00:32:35,891 --> 00:32:39,227
How do you know
I've been working with Slade Wilson?

595
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:44,666
Because I'm the Arrow.

596
00:32:47,237 --> 00:32:50,038
Of course.

597
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,674
It all makes sense now.

598
00:32:52,676 --> 00:32:55,343
It was right
in front of me.

599
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,683
You came to my office
and you shook my hand.

600
00:33:01,685 --> 00:33:03,551
You said that together,
we can save this city.

601
00:33:03,553 --> 00:33:05,954
You think that there will
be a city to be saved

602
00:33:05,956 --> 00:33:10,024
after you unleash Slade's
Mirakuru army?

603
00:33:10,026 --> 00:33:13,361
They'll only cause enough
damage to make the city ready.

604
00:33:13,363 --> 00:33:15,463
Ready for your leadership?

605
00:33:15,465 --> 00:33:18,132
For my vision
of what this city could be.

606
00:33:18,134 --> 00:33:21,503
A better city.

607
00:33:21,505 --> 00:33:24,305
And after the storm
they're about to suffer,

608
00:33:24,307 --> 00:33:26,007
the people of Starling

609
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:29,711
will support
and follow me to that city.

610
00:33:29,713 --> 00:33:34,249
Whatever Slade promised you,
he will not deliver.

611
00:33:34,251 --> 00:33:37,452
He wants to hurt me.

612
00:33:37,454 --> 00:33:42,023
You are a pawn
in a much larger game.

613
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,129
Slade promised me
city hall.

614
00:33:48,131 --> 00:33:49,464
And he delivered.

615
00:33:49,466 --> 00:33:52,200
He makes good
on his promises.

616
00:33:52,202 --> 00:33:56,204
I understand he made
you a promise, too.

617
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:04,812
What are you going to do?

618
00:34:04,814 --> 00:34:07,115
You going to stab
the mayor

619
00:34:07,117 --> 00:34:10,552
in a restaurant
full of people?

620
00:34:14,189 --> 00:34:17,859
It's a new day
in Starling City, Oliver.

621
00:34:17,861 --> 00:34:21,963
And there's nothing
you can do to stop it.

622
00:35:20,937 --> 00:35:22,447
Slade's men are
taking the city tonight.

623
00:35:22,448 --> 00:35:23,565
They can try.

624
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,241
There's more men
than we thought,

625
00:35:25,242 --> 00:35:27,109
all on Mirakuru.
It could be a massacre.

626
00:35:27,111 --> 00:35:28,944
Not if we get to them first.

627
00:35:28,946 --> 00:35:31,713
We stick to the plan,
no matter what.

628
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:33,715
Slade's using the sewer system.

629
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:36,014
You can drop in at Rock Avenue
and then head southeast.

630
00:35:36,015 --> 00:35:37,890
The lines converge
at Water Street.

631
00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:39,491
If Slade's army's underground,
that's probably where he'll be.

632
00:35:39,493 --> 00:35:41,893
Good. Let's go.
Diggle, you ready?

633
00:35:41,895 --> 00:35:43,395
Never not.

634
00:35:43,397 --> 00:35:44,763
I'm coming, too.

635
00:35:44,765 --> 00:35:47,298
No, you're not.

636
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,767
Felicity can
give me a radio.

637
00:35:48,769 --> 00:35:50,168
I'll just be your
eyes and your ears.

638
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,636
I'll stay out of
your way, I promise.

639
00:35:51,638 --> 00:35:54,606
Nothing will happen to me.
What if it did?

640
00:35:54,608 --> 00:35:57,709
Slade's men, one on one, they
are nearly impossible to stop.

641
00:35:57,711 --> 00:35:59,444
I need you to trust me.

642
00:35:59,446 --> 00:36:02,547
And I need you to be safe.

643
00:36:02,549 --> 00:36:05,483
But not them?

644
00:36:06,585 --> 00:36:10,288
This started
with the three of us.

645
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,691
It's time
we got back to that.

646
00:37:07,646 --> 00:37:10,748
Tonight we forge
a new history.

647
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:13,418
Tonight
we rise up as one

648
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,153
and take back
this city.

649
00:37:15,155 --> 00:37:18,156
I have eyes on
Blood's army.

650
00:37:18,158 --> 00:37:20,592
Got it. I'm forwarding
Dig your ping

651
00:37:20,594 --> 00:37:23,127
along with the foundation schematics
of the Topside Avenue.

652
00:37:23,129 --> 00:37:24,863
Follow the route
I laid out on the blueprints.

653
00:37:24,865 --> 00:37:27,332
You'll see structural
joints in the concrete.

654
00:37:29,668 --> 00:37:32,203
Blow them all
and Blood gets buried.

655
00:37:32,205 --> 00:37:34,138
Got it.

656
00:37:43,082 --> 00:37:45,450
The market
opened today at 400 points

657
00:37:45,452 --> 00:37:48,987
thanks in part to the surprise rally
of Queen's Consolidated.

658
00:37:48,989 --> 00:37:51,489
New leadership has--

659
00:37:51,491 --> 00:37:53,758
...the company's future in spite
of this recent tragedy.

660
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,028
Um, excuse me,
why can't I board my train?

661
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,197
I'm sorry, ma'am, it's just
business class right now.

662
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:00,665
Coach will be boarding soon.

663
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:03,501
Ok.

664
00:38:03,503 --> 00:38:05,169
Come on, pal.

665
00:38:05,171 --> 00:38:07,839
Isn't that one
of the Iron Heights escapees?

666
00:38:07,841 --> 00:38:09,774
Dumbass here tried to rob
a convenience store

667
00:38:09,776 --> 00:38:11,709
but gave up as soon
as I pulled in.

668
00:38:11,711 --> 00:38:13,077
Mind if I just stick him
here for a minute?

669
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:15,079
No, go ahead.

670
00:38:17,182 --> 00:38:18,816
I'm just asking here.

671
00:38:18,818 --> 00:38:22,053
Oliver, you've worked
really hard not to kill anymore.

672
00:38:22,055 --> 00:38:24,522
Dropping an entire block
on these guys is murder.

673
00:38:24,524 --> 00:38:26,758
Manslaughter, at least.

674
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,226
They're not men.

675
00:38:28,228 --> 00:38:30,895
Not anymore.

676
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,902
Have Diggle blow the charges
the moment he's ready.

677
00:38:37,904 --> 00:38:39,704
Oliver?

678
00:38:50,015 --> 00:38:52,884
We will lead this city
out of the darkness,

679
00:38:52,886 --> 00:38:56,120
and each one
of you will help me.

680
00:39:37,564 --> 00:39:39,799
Come on.

681
00:39:44,232 --> 00:39:46,767
Oliver, where
the hell are you?!

682
00:39:54,609 --> 00:39:56,577
You killed me...

683
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:59,680
Let me return
the favor.

684
00:39:59,682 --> 00:40:02,783
Hey.

685
00:40:02,785 --> 00:40:04,985
You got the time?

686
00:40:04,987 --> 00:40:08,155
It's, uh, 9:00.

687
00:40:08,157 --> 00:40:10,024
Thanks.

688
00:40:37,652 --> 00:40:40,487
Oliver, please.

689
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:48,796
Cisco, now is really
not a good time.

690
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:56,270
There.

691
00:40:59,741 --> 00:41:01,675
Ollie!

692
00:41:01,677 --> 00:41:03,444
There's too many
of them!

693
00:41:03,446 --> 00:41:05,613
We can't fight.

694
00:41:07,949 --> 00:41:09,717
We're not going to.

695
00:41:16,358 --> 00:41:19,026
Turn the wheel!

696
00:41:19,028 --> 00:41:20,995
What direction?

697
00:41:20,997 --> 00:41:22,896
It does not matter.
Just turn the wheel.

698
00:41:25,434 --> 00:41:28,302
I can't!
That is not an option.

699
00:41:30,372 --> 00:41:32,439
I got it!

700
00:41:32,441 --> 00:41:34,608
We're moving!

701
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:36,610
Good, good.

702
00:41:38,546 --> 00:41:41,582
Sara, we did it.

703
00:41:41,584 --> 00:41:44,051
Sara!

704
00:41:44,053 --> 00:41:46,153
Oliver!

705
00:41:51,178 --> 00:41:56,178
