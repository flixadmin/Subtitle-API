1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,071
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,231
For 7 years, I have
fought with only one goal--

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,760
to save my city,

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,399
but now a new
threat has emerged,

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,074
a danger so severe,
it has forced me

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,953
to leave my family
in order to face it,

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,676
and it won't be enough for
me to just be the Green Arrow.

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,394
To prevent the
crisis that's coming,

9
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,914
I'am going to have to
become someone else.

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,598
1am going to have to
become...something else.

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,835
Previously on "Arrow"...

12
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,270
Turns out Connor doesn't know
his brother as well as he thinks.

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,635
We're all still
alive, aren't we?

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,160
Which means what exactly,

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,674
that your brother's
not such a bad guy?

16
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,109
What did you do?

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,953
JJ] You are not gonna touch me.
-Oh, my God.

18
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,110
Because if you do,

19
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,078
the men who are storming
your bunker right now

20
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,275
will kill your brother.

21
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,556
I ignored the orders
of a cosmic being,

22
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,119
and as a result, I watched

23
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,634
an entire world disappear.

24
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,677
We're facing the
destruction of everything?

25
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,478
That's the very definition
of all hands on deck.

26
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,074
A lot of people
have died already

27
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,355
for the sake of this mission.

28
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,999
I owe it to all of
them to find out who

29
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,275
the Monitor really is.

30
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,590
-So what's the plan?
-'m going to Nanda Parbat.

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,870
Ollie?

32
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,869
Hi, Speedy.

33
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,834
Well, 'm guessing Mia's for Mom

34
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,316
and not my Corto Maltese alias.

35
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,834
Good guess.

36
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,312
She's beautiful, Ollie.

37
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,800
Where'd you get that?

38
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,394
Athena.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,673
I wasn't expecting
to find you here alone.

40
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,239
Where's Nyssa?

41
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,956
Thailand, I think. 1 don't know.

42
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,869
After we destroyed
the Lazarus Pits,

43
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,271
she said she had some
League business to take care of.

44
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,638
You destroyed the Pits.

45
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,995
Why didn't you come home?

46
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,669
Pits may be gone, but
the Thanatos Guild isn't.

47
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,230
I have to take them down
after what they did to Roy.

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,835
That's fair. Have you seen him?

49
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,675
He came back
here after Star City.

50
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,713
He told me what happened,

51
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,231
how he killed those men and...

52
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,040
He's dealing with
his own demons.

53
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,750
He'll be back.

54
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,594
I missed you.

55
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,954
I missed you, too.

56
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,159
But I'm pretty sure I'm not
the reason why you came here.

57
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,954
Last year, I made a deal

58
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,476
with a cosmic being
named Mar Novu.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,310
Recently, he came
to collect his debt.

60
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,834
He asked me to help him,

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,959
but he's not very good
at sharing information

62
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,117
with the people
he's working with.

63
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,636
Sounds like
somebody else I know.

64
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,197
I need to be 100 percent
sure that I can trust him.

65
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,558
I know it's a long
shot, but I was hoping

66
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,799
that Nyssa could tell
me what, if anything,

67
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,234
the League knows about him.

68
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,949
Ok. What are you not telling me?

69
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,550
He's seen the future.

70
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,349
He's seen me die.

71
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,875
It's soon, Speedy.

72
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,630
And?

73
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,630
Take as much time as
you need to be upset.

74
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,879
Ollie, come on.
You've cheated death

75
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,390
more than any of
us have by this point.

76
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,478
This is fundamentally
different than anything

77
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,278
that we've ever
dealt with before.

78
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,590
Ok.

79
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,718
Well, let's try to figure
out what we're dealing with,

80
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,554
but like I said,
Nyssa's not here.

81
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,077
Sara hasn't been
able to help either.

82
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,077
We've kind of killed off every
League member, haven't we?

83
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,354
I can think of one more.

84
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,590
William?

85
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,430
William?

86
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,550
Frak!

87
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,195
William!

88
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,229
Where is he?

89
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,870
-Aah? Oh. It's you.

90
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,269
I'm here. I'm ok.

91
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,632
I remembered how Mom hardwired

92
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,751
the bunker's power
grid through the floor.

93
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,354
Gave those guys the
shock of their lives.

94
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,154
Guys.

95
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,752
This is why JJ was
going after William.

96
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,275
He's targeting all the members

97
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,760
of the Star City
Unification Movement.

98
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,831
The ones that are
still alive anyway.

99
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,272
This was a city-wide assault.

100
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,757
There's 10 confirmed dead.

101
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,232
And now that JJ
knows who they all are,

102
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,390
it's only a matter of time

103
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,756
before he wipes out
the entire movement.

104
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,480
Unless we trap him first.

105
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,033
All we really need
is the right...lure.

106
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,754
You want to use
yourself as bait?

107
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,952
No way. It is too dangerous.

108
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,680
Look. I know you
don't want to hear this,

109
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,279
but the Deathstrokes
have been five steps

110
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,430
ahead of us this whole time.

111
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,795
We need to gain the upper hand.

112
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,349
Which is why we are going
to bring the fight to them,

113
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,352
take them out in one fell swoop.

114
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,511
How? It's not like
we're gonna waltz

115
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,949
back into their headquarters.

116
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,239
Unless that's your plan.

117
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,269
Mia, that didn't work out

118
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,515
too well for us last time.

119
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,909
Right, but we've
been there before.

120
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,195
We know the layout.

121
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,595
We can use that
to our advantage.

122
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,830
I think this is a mistake.

123
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,633
I'll remember that.

124
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,790
Get ready to move out.

125
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,314
Something wrong with the uplink?

126
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,879
No, no. It's our
timing that's off.

127
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,434
♪ already went to sleep.

128
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,830
Well, we can call him
back, wake him up.

129
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,759
No. Little man's gone
through enough already.

130
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,837
Besides, I need to know
what mission was so important

131
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,071
that you wanted me here
instead of Nanda Parbat.

132
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,390
Ben Turner is currently
on a deep cover op,

133
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,592
s0 I've been keeping
an eye on his family.

134
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,959
Sandra Hawke has
never missed a check-in

135
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,515
until yesterday.

136
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,199
So you think something
happened to Sandra and Connor?

137
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,390
I know it.

138
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,280
These pictures were taken
at an airfield in Kasnia.

139
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,636
Kasnia? That's far from home.

140
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,752
Any chance Sandra and Connor
are meeting up with Turner?

141
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,831
Kasnia's nowhere close
to any of Turner's missions

142
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,274
past, present, or future,

143
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,033
and then there's this man.

144
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,716
Abdul Nardoc. He
owns that plane.

145
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,632
Nardoc bills himself
as a philanthropist,

146
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,599
but intel suggests that he
has ties to local terrorists.

147
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,592
Hmm, He's throwing a fundraiser

148
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,393
tomorrow at his home.

149
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,790
Odds are good that Sandra
and Connor are being held on site.

150
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,076
We need to infiltrate
and get eyes on them.

151
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,993
Why not just take an
A.R.G.U.S. recon team?

152
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,915
I've spent the past few months
trying to untangle the web

153
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,400
of corruption at AR.G.U.S.

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,992
Until I eliminate it, I can't
trust this with anyone.

155
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,356
I need you with me, John.

156
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,797
Hmm. Must be really important,

157
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,030
you called me John.

158
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,755
Guess I need a suit.

159
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,752
I already picked one out.

160
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,990
Hmm.

161
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,195
I thought you guys
were friends now.

162
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,951
Well...not exactly.

163
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,350
Ok. Well, this place
isn't the least bit creepy.

164
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,155
Hold!

165
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,750
Leave us.

166
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,031
Your students used
to ask questions first.

167
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,034
I have learned

168
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,677
that hesitation
often proves fatal.

169
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,558
You should not have
come to this place.

170
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,360
You owe me a debt.

171
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,909
I'm here to collect.

172
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,793
You come here at great peril.

173
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,510
Especially you.

174
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,997
Word of your exploits
has traveled far.

175
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,673
How is my sister?

176
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,797
She's great. Vacationing,

177
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,314
working on a tan.

178
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,280
I see you survived prison.

179
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,279
Mm-hmm. Dr. Parker didn't.

180
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,239
Heard he was
killed with a sword.

181
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,279
He received the
justice he deserved.

182
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,512
So now you're back
to your old exploits?

183
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,479
With the League gone, the
region has become quite unstable.

184
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,677
And you think training
a bunch of assassins

185
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,797
in a place like this
is gonna stabilize it?

186
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,640
I think it a wiser
course of action

187
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,160
than declaring a one-woman war

188
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,310
on the Thanatos Guild.

189
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,790
Much as I would like
to have a debate, Talia,

190
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,511
I need to know whatever
the League might know

191
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,710
about Mar Novu.

192
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,077
That's an unusual
name. I'd remember it.

193
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,438
If it helps, he's apparently
some type of cosmic know-it-all.

194
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,318
Well, such beings
often go by many names.

195
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,874
If I help you,

196
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,912
I can consider my debt paid?

197
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,434
Yes.

198
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,917
If the League has any
information concerning this man,

199
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,270
it will be found
underneath the Karan Shah.

200
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,115
The League's stronghold.

201
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,233
It has since been destroyed,

202
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,960
but my father kept the League
records in the catacombs,

203
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,353
so with any luck, they're
still there waiting to be found.

204
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,833
We leave at nightfall.

205
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,275
She's still fun.

206
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,957
- You good?
- I'm fine.

207
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,873
Ithink I just--ack-- got
some dust in my mouth.

208
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,998
Ack! Was it this
dusty last time?

209
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,275
It was worse.

210
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,960
Are you sure this is gonna work?

211
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,952
If I can tap into the old
galaxy one cameras,

212
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,309
we should be able
to see everything,

213
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,354
including JJ and his
Deathstroke maniacs.

214
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,030
Pstt. Hey.

215
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,235
Someone's coming.

216
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,314
Guys, there's an office
just up here I can use.

217
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,196
Ok. System's gonna need a minute
to reboot before I can access it.

218
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,357
Look. I know you
think this is a bad idea.

219
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,513
The 4 of us taking
on all of JJ's forces

220
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,875
on their home turf?

221
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,759
Wasn't my first choice.

222
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,599
Thanks for coming anyway.

223
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,354
We're a team.

224
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,950
I just--

225
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,317
I hope you're doing
this for the right reasons.

226
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,995
What do you mean?

227
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,837
I'm pissed that JJ
tried to kill William, too,

228
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,671
but we can't let fear
dictate our strategy.

229
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,554
I'm not afraid of ♪
or his idiot goons.

230
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,594
I know, but you are afraid
of losing your brother.

231
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,831
Bad news, guys. System's
in worse shape than I thought.

232
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,593
I'm gonna need more time.

233
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,515
We should get into position.

234
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,114
I'll stay with William
until he's done.

235
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,350
Let us know when
you're up and running.

236
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,590
Yeah.

237
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,916
See a lot of
unfriendly faces here.

238
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,400
How you looking?

239
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,915
Just waiting for
the security feeds

240
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,269
to finish uploading.

241
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,552
Hmm. Dancing
undercover's like deja vu.

242
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,155
There's Nardoc.

243
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,639
What do you say
we take a closer look,

244
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,239
find out who his friends are?

245
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,436
You've come a long
way since Afghanistan.

246
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,277
Yeah. Well, sometimes, I
wish we were still on that tour.

247
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,113
Life was a lot less complicated.

248
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,034
But we wouldn't be married.

249
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,034
Hmm. That's true. Or divorced.

250
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,959
Or remarried,

251
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,111
and we wouldn't
have our beautiful boy.

252
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,075
All the feeds are complete.

253
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,515
Copy that.

254
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,559
Sandra and Connor are here.

255
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,750
They're being held in a room

256
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,280
in the northeast corner.

257
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,239
Good. We'll exfil them out
before Nardoc knows what hit him.

258
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,352
I don't think it's
gonna be that easy.

259
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,840
Why? We just got a hit on one

260
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,479
of Nardoc's friends.

261
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,115
The man in the
black suit and blue tie

262
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,474
Farzad Qadir.

263
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,434
Gholem Qadir's son.

264
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,951
“Who Ben Turner killed?
-To save me.

265
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,157
I doubt his family's
kidnapping is a coincidence.

266
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,113
Wow. Love what they
haven't done with the place.

267
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,953
Assuming the Karan Shah
hasn't been plundered,

268
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,235
we're likely to find
what we're looking for

269
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,913
in "The Chronicles of Al-Fatih."

270
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,640
He was the first Ra's Al Ghul.

271
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,155
According to legend, he was
bestowed primordial knowledge

272
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,435
by one of the sky gods.

273
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,678
Now my father kept a secret room

274
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,035
with his most
valued possessions,

275
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,476
including information
on Al-Fatih.

276
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,598
Looks like we're too late.

277
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,433
Not necessarily.

278
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,951
"the Chronicles of Al-Fatih.”

279
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,310
So the looters just
happened to leave behind

280
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,039
the one thing we're looking for?

281
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,635
Because the thieves did
not consider it to be of value.

282
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,229
Right. What's it say?

283
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,155
"The phoenix is
reborn in the fire.

284
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,039
The path to your
destiny follows me."

285
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,033
Speedy, you just read Arabic.

286
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,634
You speak Russian.

287
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,794
Yes, but what does it mean?

288
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,751
To join the League,
your old self must die

289
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,957
so that your new
one may be reborn.

290
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,070
Oh.

291
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,919
We need to burn the scroll.

292
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,639
The scroll is centuries old.

293
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,790
Yeah.

294
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,949
Al-Fatih took great
pains to hide his secrets

295
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,394
lest he be betrayed.

296
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,035
I believe this leads
to Al-Fatih's tomb.

297
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,509
It stands to reason
that he would attempt

298
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,199
to take his secrets with
him beyond the grave.

299
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,914
So it's a scavenger hunt.

300
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,354
It would appear so, yes.

301
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,120
Why can't everything
just be easy?

302
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,796
Actually, your situation is
more difficult than you think.

303
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,350
-Athena, -You have always been

304
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,716
treacherous, Talia,
but bringing outsiders

305
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,918
into our sacred
heart is a betrayal

306
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,559
of the highest order.

307
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,715
I'll take that.

308
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,833
Relinquish it or perish.

309
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,279
As you wish.

310
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,835
Attack them!

311
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,990
Athena showing up right when
we did can't be an accident.

312
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,318
No, and neither was her
giving Athena the sphere.

313
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,915
If you're accusing me, I'd
like to point out two things.

314
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,117
First, Athena and I
are blood enemies.

315
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,270
And second?

316
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,953
She was likely trailing you.

317
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,191
The woman who's
declared war on her.

318
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,396
Still, don't see why
Athena would give

319
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,756
a crap about a rusty, old
scroll buried with Al-Fatih.

320
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,036
She wouldn't. She
would give a crap

321
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,594
about what else
is buried with him,

322
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,319
namely his sword

323
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,232
as revered as the ring of Ra's.

324
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,118
Whoever wields it
commands absolute devotion.

325
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,759
Clearly Athena wants
to use it to restart

326
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,069
the League of Assassins.

327
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,959
Yeah. Well, now she's got the
marble of destiny or whatever.

328
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,519
Actually, it's a map.

329
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,393
The markings on it
were constellations

330
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,676
indicating the tomb's
location, but we don't need it.

331
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,714
I've memorized them.

332
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,910
What?

333
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,517
-You memorized
them? +You didn't?

334
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,197
Ok. Listen. I'm gonna
go ahead with Talia.

335
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,351
I'd like you to go back to her
camp and wait for us there.

336
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,834
You can't be serious.

337
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,231
1 will give you two a moment.

338
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,993
Ollie, I thought we were way

339
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,719
past this overprotective
brother thing.

340
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,870
It's not about that.

341
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,359
You came to me for help.

342
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,920
I came to you for answers.

343
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,918
I wasn't counting on
getting attacked by Athena.

344
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,398
Athena and I were fighting
long before you showed up here.

345
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,073
I can take care of myself.

346
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,639
I know you can
take care of yourself.

347
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,680
If Athena is trying to restart
the League of Assassins,

348
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,234
that makes you her chief rival.

349
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,994
-l don't care.
-l care, Thea.

350
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,074
If you want to help me,
just...just let me handle this.

351
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,473
Qadir must be using
Turner's family to lure him out.

352
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,517
Ok. Then we have to
get out of here right now.

353
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,398
What? What are
you talking about?

354
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,836
If Ben Turner's a
target, then so are we,

355
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,156
and every second we stay
here, we risk being made.

356
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,795
What about Sandra and Connor?

357
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,514
Callan AR.G.US. team, Lyla.

358
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,398
-Exfil them.
-It would take a team

359
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,073
at least an hour to get here.

360
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,435
A lot can happen
between now that then.

361
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,318
Ok, fine, but we can't
risk doing this alone.

362
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,835
“We have to do something.
-Then you leave.

363
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,753
I'l get Sandra and
Connor myself.

364
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,798
Johnny...

365
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,597
what's really going on here?

366
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,552
You've never been one
to shy away from risk.

367
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,473
I'd never seen a world just
disintegrate right in front of my face.

368
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,797
I know what we do requires risk.

369
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,595
I've always accepted that,

370
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,795
but this is different, Lyla.

371
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,554
Seeing a universe
just...disappear, it--

372
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,914
I don't know, it's like--

373
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,437
like looking into
the eye of God.

374
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,113
It changes you.

375
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,069
It changed me.

376
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,759
I can't risk losing you.

377
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,914
I can't risk that.

378
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,031
No one knows the future.

379
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,914
All we cando is enjoy
the time we have

380
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,874
with the people we love

381
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,955
and make our choices from
a place of strength, not fear,

382
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,678
and if the world ends today,

383
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,190
there is no one I'd
rather have by my side.

384
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,995
How much further?

385
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,674
Patience. You realize
your sister is involved

386
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,797
in this whether you
want her to be or not?

387
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,950
She's a daughter of the demon.

388
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,155
She has a claim to the sword.

389
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,311
She's carried enough
of Malcolm's burdens.

390
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,710
Fate does not care what
we believe we're owed.

391
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,230
You're very familiar with that.

392
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,430
Isn't that why you're here?

393
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,910
What do you mean?

394
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,549
You carry yourself
with a heaviness

395
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,994
I've not seen since Russia.

396
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,395
This is the place.

397
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,954
I've been here before.

398
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,676
Yes. When my
father vanquished you.

399
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,390
Hopefully you have better luck

400
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,834
with the mountain this time.

401
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,510
Down!

402
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,394
The phoenix up there,
it's triggering the spears.

403
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,989
Here's an idea.

404
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,679
The key to the crypt of Ra's.

405
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,193
Looks like the
entrance right there.

406
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,350
Yes.

407
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,190
Agh!

408
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,754
Wh--what are you doing?

409
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,110
I am sorry, Oliver.

410
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,154
I can't let Athena
get to the sword,

411
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,913
but I can't let
you get it either.

412
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,073
Looks like you're down
one evil companion.

413
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,190
Hmm.

414
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,477
I thought I told you
to stay at the camp.

415
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,633
You did. Looks like 1 didn't
ignore you soon enough.

416
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,116
Hey. I don't have time
for an I told you so.

417
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,110
All right.

418
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,997
So Talia will take
the trail to the summit.

419
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,031
It's safer, you conserve energy,

420
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,113
but going up the face
of the mountain is faster.

421
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,954
Thought you said it was harder.

422
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,152
Yeah. I've done it before.

423
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,074
Ok. If you can
do it, I can do it.

424
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,590
“Thea, Ollie, just stop it.

425
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,155
Start walking.

426
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,998
Tell me you're almost
done hacking those cameras.

427
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,590
You ever hear that thing
about patience being a virtue?

428
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,751
Since when have I
ever cared about virtue?

429
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,713
All right. Seriously,
how much longer?

430
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,714
Ok. I just activated the
northwest quadrant cameras.

431
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,036
I just need a few more minutes to
get the rest of them up and running.

432
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,430
How many is a few?

433
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,394
Look. I know what I'm doing, ok,

434
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,039
s0 just trust me.

435
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,710
Ido.

436
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,354
1 di just

437
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,480
William, this has to work.

438
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,150
If we're gonna bring Star City

439
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,509
and the Glades back together,

440
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,399
we have to take out the
Deathstrokes for good this time.

441
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,269
Well, we could have if you'd
let the team use me as bait.

442
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,831
No. That is too
risky, and you know it.

443
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,196
Well, how many times have
you risked yourself for this team?

444
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,830
How many times have you
beaten up a guy 10 times your size

445
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,474
to protect someone
you care about?

446
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,438
-That's different. “Why?
Because I'm not a fighter?

447
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,034
No. Because you're my brother.

448
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,351
You are the only
family I have left.

449
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,910
Mia...

450
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,349
look. I...

451
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,840
I appreciate you
looking out for me. I do,

452
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,560
but operating
from a place of fear

453
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,393
is not the way to
protect each other.

454
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,034
We need to trust each other.

455
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,111
It's the only way we'll survive.

456
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,510
Found them.

457
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,878
Oh, boy. That is a
lot of Deathstrokes.

458
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,069
You sure about this?

459
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,835
- Connor, Zoe, we have eyes.
- Roger that.

460
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,509
- Get ready to move.
- On it.

461
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,190
Mia.

462
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,430
Be careful.

463
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,750
1 will.

464
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,673
Oh, and if you tell anyone

465
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,194
about this conversation,

466
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,159
1 will kill you myself.

467
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,151
Thought you said
this was the hard part.

468
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,119
Don't get cocky.

469
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,509
Ok. What is going
on with you, Ollie?

470
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,674
You were never
this overprotective

471
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,989
when I left Star City.

472
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,393
Things have changed.

473
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,592
I left my family behind, Speedy,

474
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,629
and I miss them.

475
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,439
And every day, I wrestle
with whether or not

476
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,876
I made the right decision
because maybe I didn't,

477
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,155
and...

478
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,199
I saw an entire world
wiped out of existence,

479
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,318
a world that you
weren't in, by the way,

480
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,676
because I wasn't
around to protect you.

481
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,234
I'm sorry, Thea, but

482
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,720
the only way that
I can bear this

483
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,394
is if become 100 percent certain

484
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,117
that my sacrifice,
that my death...

485
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,673
will protect the people I love.

486
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,632
I need my family to be safe.

487
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,629
You know, I've
been thinking a lot

488
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,359
about Mom and Dad lately,

489
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,875
wondering what they would think

490
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,232
about the lives we've chosen.

491
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,959
All the mistakes they made,

492
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,112
all the.. lies they told

493
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:37,036
in their own very,
very messed up way.

494
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,638
They thought they
were protecting us.

495
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,154
They weren't, They didn't.

496
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,674
No, but...it did help us become

497
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,194
the people we are today.

498
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,517
They turned us into heroes.

499
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,437
We can't change
the future, Ollie.

500
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,919
The past teaches
us you might as well

501
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,394
not bother trying to.

502
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,070
When you'd stop
being my baby sister?

503
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,997
No. I never did.

504
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,076
I just grew up a little bit.

505
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,118
Now can we please
get off this mountain?

506
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,870
Yeah.

507
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,029
We're not alone.

508
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,754
Apparently, this day
is not going the way

509
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,354
either of us have planned.

510
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,874
Surrender your weapons.

511
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,110
What do you want?

512
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,398
The route to Al-Fatih's
crypt will be dangerous.

513
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,954
Always good to have
a few sacrificial lambs

514
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,153
to tell us where not to stray.

515
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,830
After you.

516
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,313
Underground in Nanda Parbat.

517
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,278
What could possibly go wrong?

518
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,278
Well, Indiana Jones made
this look way more fun.

519
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,000
"To survive death,
you must embrace it."

520
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,359
Well, how do you embrace death?

521
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,437
The coffin. Come on.

522
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,674
Go on.

523
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,910
Ok.

524
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,873
I miss watching you kick ass.

525
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,075
This way.

526
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,274
Must be passcode-protected.

527
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,714
This should be able to crack it,

528
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,915
but it'll take a few minutes.

529
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,479
We may not have a few minutes.

530
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,954
If this is Qadir and his men,

531
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,278
he'll recognize us
the minute he sees us.

532
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,029
Maybe we can use that.

533
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,759
I was standing next
to Gholem Qadir

534
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,910
the night that
Turner killed him.

535
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,229
I can distract Farzad.

536
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,875
Lyla that's too dangerous.

537
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,519
It's our only option.

538
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,036
Hey. Just be careful.

539
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,756
-Pardon me. Wait.

540
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,309
You know, usually, I
detest party crashers,

541
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,158
but I'l make an
exception for you...

542
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,269
Lyla Michaels.

543
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,591
Hey. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

544
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,956
It's okay. If's okay. My
name is John Diggle.

545
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,554
I'm a friend of Lyla
Michaels and Ben Turner.

546
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,439
I'm here to help you. I
can get you out of here,

547
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,035
but you have to move quietly.
Come on, come on. Shh, shh shh.

548
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,350
Did you know I was there
the night my father died?

549
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,559
I was supposed
to stay in my room,

550
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,553
but I wanted to hear the music.

551
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,673
Do you have any idea
what it's like to watch

552
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,274
your own father be murdered?

553
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,875
I was just a boy.

554
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,793
I'm sorry you had to see that,

555
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,159
but your father was a criminal.

556
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,549
So he deserved to die?

557
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,639
1 will have my vengeance.

558
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,110
You all right?

559
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,200
I've got Sandra and Connor.

560
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,395
Let's go home.

561
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,595
Prisoners first.

562
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,030
Watch your step.

563
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,477
Ollie, a phoenix.

564
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,593
All right. Crypt must
be through there.

565
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,395
Ok.

566
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,870
Thea!

567
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,315
Thank you.

568
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,514
Yeah.

569
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,314
"All beings burn,

570
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,871
but a phoenix rises
from the ashes."

571
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,677
Ok. I think we need
to use the phoenix tiles

572
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,955
to get across.

573
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,390
After them!

574
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,994
You hold them
off. I'l get Talia.

575
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,434
-Theal -Just trust me.

576
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,550
Talia?

577
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,114
You're too late.

578
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,596
As heir to the
demon, Ihave the right

579
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,875
to challenge you to combat.

580
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,958
You wish to fight me?

581
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,873
Very well. I accept.

582
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,512
I hope you prove to
be a worthy opponent.

583
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,519
Your brother trained you well.

584
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,394
Pity the tools you learned
from him he learned from me.

585
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,718
Less talking, more fighting.

586
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,479
You were a fool to think
you could defeat me.

587
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,990
Actually...

588
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,115
you're right where I want you.

589
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,794
Do you yield?

590
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,555
I yield.

591
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,800
Ahem. What's it say?

592
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,556
It says "Al-Fatih
was visited by a god

593
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,080
who possessed the power

594
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,039
to see all that is
and all that will be.

595
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,912
He believed that if he
failed to keep the balance

596
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,310
between good and
evil this god would

597
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,433
bring forth the end of times,

598
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,192
annihilation of all things."

599
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,516
Ollie, if that's true,
this means that--

600
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,150
it means Mar Novu
is not trying to prevent

601
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,550
what's going to happen

602
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,793
because he's gonna
be what causes it.

603
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,555
You're leaving?

604
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,155
I have betrayed my honor

605
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,798
and the sacred
traditions of the League.

606
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,360
The sword was destined to
be yours, daughter of Merlyn.

607
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,990
I'am sorry for the pain
I've caused you both.

608
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,560
What about your students?

609
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,870
I've released them.

610
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,998
They will follow you if
that is what you wish.

611
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,150
It's not.

612
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,235
You're their teacher.

613
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,954
They need someone to follow.

614
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,110
If I was meant to lead them,

615
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,549
I would wield Al-Fatih's sword,

616
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,190
but you do,

617
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,320
so the honor and
the burden are yours.

618
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,835
Yeah. Hard pass.

619
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,190
Itis your destiny.

620
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,153
Yeah, but, see, about that.

621
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,279
I don't really believe in the
whole fate, destiny thing.

622
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,359
We can all make our own choices.

623
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,510
Meaning?

624
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,470
Meaning I don't
think the world needs

625
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,358
another League of Assassins.

626
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,517
It could use League of Heroes.

627
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,638
It wouldn't be a one-woman job.

628
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,594
You'd extend me that honor

629
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,955
despite my betrayals?

630
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,914
You made a mistake.

631
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,351
We've all made mistakes.

632
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,310
For not one but two women
to wield my father's sword?

633
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,393
He would be aghast.

634
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,475
l accept.

635
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,752
New phone, better encryption,

636
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,230
and a one-way ticket
home via Hong Kong.

637
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,390
No one will be expecting that.

638
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,673
I can't thank you
enough for all your help.

639
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,195
I mean, without you two I'd--

640
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,510
No, no. It's the least
we could have done,

641
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,830
and you were very brave.

642
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,915
Your father would
be proud of you.

643
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,555
Thanks, Mr. Diggles.

644
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,550
Call me Dig.

645
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,280
Let's go get our things.

646
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,636
Hey. They're gonna be okay.

647
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,670
Yeah...and so are we.

648
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,632
The world's gonna
keep coming for us.

649
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,834
There's nothing
1 can do to stop it.

650
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,392
Neither can you,
but you were right.

651
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,393
We just hold on to
each other, we'll be fine

652
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,749
like Sandra and Connor.

653
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,794
What? What is it?

654
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:21,319
Johnny, promise me that
no matter what happens

655
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,076
you'll always remember
the good times.

656
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,638
won't have to because
I'm not going anywhere,

657
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,515
and neither are you.

658
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,159
I love you, Lyla Michaels.

659
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,475
I'love you.

660
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,829
I love you, too.

661
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,674
Always have, always will.

662
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,834
I'm sorry you didn't get the
answers you were looking for.

663
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,755
Got to see you,

664
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,592
Here's what I don't get. Okay.

665
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,151
If Mar Novu causes
whatever's gonna happen,

666
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,836
why does he bring
you in in the first place?

667
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,270
I don't know.

668
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,950
Look. I just--

669
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,598
I know that if he ends up
being on the wrong side of this...

670
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,115
I'm gonna stop him.

671
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,316
If you're gonna
take on a god, Ollie,

672
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,318
you're gonna need all
the help you can get.

673
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,359
Pretty good on help actually.

674
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,597
I have John, I have
Laurel-- believe it or not.

675
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,472
Seems to me you
have your hands full

676
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,713
rebuilding the
League of Assassins

677
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,951
into a League of Heroes.

678
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,550
Yeah.

679
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,878
I can't believe I'm saying
good-bye to you again.

680
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,915
Well, you're not.
Think of it as a...

681
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,949
"See you later,

682
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,311
and please don't die."

683
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,916
One of us is gonna
have to let go first.

684
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,199
-Same time?
-Mm-hmm,

685
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,714
No Hozen this time?

686
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,397
Uh, Felicity gave it to William.

687
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,794
I'm gonna miss you.

688
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,393
Every day, I miss you.

689
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,110
Good-bye, Speedy.

690
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,755
Bye, Ollie.

691
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,119
Tonight is the night that
we have all been waiting for,

692
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,872
the night that we destroy
the unification movement.

693
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,556
The city will be ours,

694
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,878
and there is nothing
anyone can do to stop it.

695
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,673
Actually, I think there is.

696
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,718
You just don't
know when to quit.

697
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,269
Damn. What an entrance.

698
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,758
You know, the human
body holds an average

699
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,036
of 5 liters of blood.

700
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,997
Let's see how
much you have, huh?

701
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,595
Hyah!

702
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,430
Are you ok?

703
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,230
Thanks.

704
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,755
JJ!

705
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,679
Stay with me. We're
gonna get you out of here.

706
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,873
Tell--tell my dad--

707
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,717
just tell--tell him that...

708
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,157
I'm sorry about everything.

709
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,839
That I love him.

710
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:31,911
Hey. Hey. You're gonna
tell him yourself, ok?

711
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,195
You are because we are--

712
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,995
we're gonna get you safe.

713
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,239
0k? 1 got you.

714
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,439
Zoe, I got you.

715
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,034
Zoe?

716
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,551
No. No, no, no, no.

717
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,557
No. Zoe.

718
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,999
Aah!

719
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,195
You don't have the
guts, do you, huh?

720
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,874
You're wrong.

721
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,714
Oliver?

722
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,550
What's going on?

723
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,958
That's a very good question.

724
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,070
Dad?

725
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,875
Greg, move your head!
