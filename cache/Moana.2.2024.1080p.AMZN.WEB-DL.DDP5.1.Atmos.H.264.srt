1
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,428
Almost there.
Just an easy little hop.

2
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,596
Kinda.

3
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,312
Hey! You wanted
to come this time.

4
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,022
Just a little...

5
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,650
higher.

6
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,738
Heihei?

7
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,781
How?

8
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,563
Hear anything?

9
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:31,234
There's gotta be
other people out here.

10
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,069
Other villages...

11
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,279
And one day

12
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,656
someone's gonna answer...

13
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,663
Never change.

14
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,457

00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,838

-No, no, no.

106
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,178
It's called a hair whip.

107
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,721

00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,313
It was in a clearing!

111
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,481
Which I found with
a little help from...

112
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,649
...Heihei,

113
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,068
but this isn't
from our village.

114
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,736
I don't even know
what it's made of,

115
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,905
but it's proof.

116
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:31,117
There are other people
out there.

117
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,578
I don't know why
we haven't found them yet,

118
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,664
but, Dad, that island,

119
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,667
I think that's where
they're gonna be.

120
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,795
I just have to figure out
how to find those stars.

121
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,130
Whoa!

122
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,007

123
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,175

128
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,392
It was three days.

129
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,810
But I missed you every...

130
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,937
-What did you bring me?
-Bring you?

131
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,898
You said
you'd bring me a present.

132
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,650
Huh. Well, let me see.

133
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,986
Whoa.

134
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,988
What's it do?

135
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,698
What's it...

136
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,202
Where are we going?

137
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,166
Whoa.

138
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,837
This is the place
of our ancestors.

139
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,841
Where I learned
our people are voyagers.

140
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,678
Where Gramma showed me
who we are.

141
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,888
Gramma!

142
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,724
She said to grab Maui
by the ear and tell him,

143
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,976
"I am Moana of Motunui.

144
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,561
"You will board my boat

145
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,438
"and restore
the heart of Te Fiti."

146
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,190
Pretty good.

147
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,358
Yeah.

148
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,109
How long did it take?

149
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,570
- Few weeks.
- Weeks?

150
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,948
That's longer than forever.

151
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,115
I know.

152
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,618
But it was important.

153
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,828
And, if I hadn't gone,

154
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,956
I never would've
become a wayfinder.

155
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,750
Like our ancient chiefs.

156
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,335
Like the last
great navigator...

157
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,129
Tautai Vasa.

158
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,632
Before Maui
stole Te Fiti's heart

159
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,884
and we stopped voyaging...

160
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,887
Tautai Vasa wanted
to connect our island

161
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,724
to all the people
of the entire ocean.

162
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,727
Because together,
what we can do.

163
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,146
how far we all can go,

164
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,899
it's endless.

165
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,986
And now
that I'm a wayfinder,

166
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:33,864
it's my job to continue
what he started.

167
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,075
And this...

168
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,578
This is my first clue how.

169
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,789
You should make Maui go,
so you can stay with me!

170
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,709
Well, Maui is out demigodding,

171
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,752
but if he ever shows up,

172
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:50,131
you grab him by the ear
and tell him that.

173
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,061
Chee Hoo!

174
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,248
Yoo-hoo!

175
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,713
I'm not here to cause trouble.

176
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:35,051
Just a super chiseled demigod
passing through.

177
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,303
Now, open the portal
to the island,

178
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,804
and I'll be on my way.

179
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,308
And why would I risk

180
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,769
breaking the rules for you

181
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,105
when you've already caused
my boss so much trouble?

182
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,607
Hey, Nalo started it.

183
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,442
And you'll finish it?

184
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,445
Team up with your
precious human again?

185
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,698
Team?

186
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,116
You mean the girl
with the canoe

187
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,701
and that goofy little chicken?

188
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,119
We weren't a team.

189
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,954
I just used her
to get my hook.

190
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,208
Ow. Ow!

191
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,335
Nalo is a god, Maui.

192
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,046
If you try to reconnect
the people of the ocean,

193
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,798
he will destroy you.

194
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,800
And then
he'll destroy her too.

195
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,135
This is between him and me.

196
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,721
Moana has nothing
to do with it.

197
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:27,228
Oh! You made her
a wayfinder, Maui.

198
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:31,065
So, now, she has everything
to do with it.

199
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,373
Mystery island? Cool.

200
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,541
I'd like a sample of that.

201
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,793
♪ Moana's gonna find people ♪

202
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,359
Well, eat up.

203
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,861
We don't want
the pork getting cold.

204
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,363
Ooh.

205
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,074
Gotta stop doing that.

206
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,534
Moana...

207
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,871
Tonight isn't just a feast.

208
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,623
Long ago,

209
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:33,127
there was a title given
to the last great wayfinder

210
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,172
with dreams as big as yours.

211
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:39,425
A sacred title,
more than a chief,

212
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,135
a Tautai.

213
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,513
Leader, connector
of the entire sea.

214
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,682
My dear,

215
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:51,103
would you honor us tonight
by accepting this title?

216
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:55,107
Our people's first Tautai
in a thousand years.

217
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:59,236
And show us all
just how far we'll go.

218
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:24,470
Tonight, we drink
from our ancestors' bowl,

219
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,096
as Tautai Vasa once did,

220
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:31,101
to bestow this title on you.

221
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,605
To connect to our past,
our present,

222
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,359
and the future
that lies beyond.

223
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,488
May the ancestors
continue to guide us.

224
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,079
-Big sis!
-Shh.

225
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,710
I am honored
to serve our people.

226
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,174
May the ancestors
continue to guide us.

227
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,573
Tautai Vasa.

228
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:30,452
Motufetu should be
under the stars.

229
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,290
What?

230
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,294
Bind the sail!

231
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,503
Lift the oar!

232
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,010
No!

233
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,504
Where are my people?

234
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,881
Tautai Moana.

235
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:29,637
This is your future
if you cannot find others.

236
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,056
In isolation,

237
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,142
this is how your story ends.

238
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,269
I don't understand.

239
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,272
Returning Te Fiti's heart
was the beginning.

240
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,566
You must brave the storm.

241
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,610
Reconnect our people.

242
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,029
Find Motufetu.

243
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,531
But I don't know
how to reach it.

244
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:52,159
A fire in the sky
will guide you.

245
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,245
Wait. I don't even know
how far it is.

246
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,749
Farther than I was able to go.

247
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,254
Find Motufetu.

248
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,465
Reconnect us all!

249
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,220
No!

250
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,429
Moana!

251
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,310
Motufetu.

252
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,981
The island
I have to find is Motufetu.

253
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,441
Okay...

254
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,610
Took some searching, but...

255
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,240
Motufetu.

256
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,825
What is it?

257
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,619
An ancient island

258
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,246
where the channels
of the ocean

259
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,039
once came together,

260
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:43,043
connecting the people
of the entire sea.

261
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:47,089
Until it was lost. Cursed.

262
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,425
Cursed?

263
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,468
In a terrible storm

264
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,847
of a power-hungry god, Nalo,

265
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,227
who believed he'd be stronger

266
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,355
by separating
the people of the ocean,

267
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,857
to weaken us,

268
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,151
to end our story.

269
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,112
Our ancestors believed

270
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:14,408
reaching Motufetu
would break Nalo's curse,

271
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,535
restore the channels.

272
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:21,290
It's the only way to bring
our people together again.

273
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,668
Or our story ends.

274
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,796
We need to convene
a council of...

275
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,757
Chief!

276
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,655
A fire in the sky.

277
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,115
He wants me to follow it.

278
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,618
To new stars.

279
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,828
It could take a lifetime.

280
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,498
Tautai Vasa
didn't make it back at all.

281
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,793
It's a call
from the ancestors, Tui.

282
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,795
But if we never
see her again...

283
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,174
What do you mean,
never see you again?

284
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,301
Simea,
no, I mean, that's...

285
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,887
I don't want you to leave!

286
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:23,685
Simea...

287
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,235
Mom, this...

288
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,237
It's so fast.

289
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,655
What if...

290
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,533
You're a Tautai now, Moana.

291
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,868
For some things,

292
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,080

Oh, what are you
so worried about?

334
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,563
It's not like last time.

335
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,566
Last time,
you weren't old enough

336
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,360
to understand
all you could lose.

337
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,404
Or learn.

338
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,449
But here we are.
Together still.

339
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,284
Just a little different.

340
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,330
I can't see
where your story leads,

341
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:15,751
but we never stop
choosing who we are.

342
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,342
This is bigger than Motunui.

343
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,302
Bigger than us.

344
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,597
So I will sail to this new sky

345
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:32,642
to reconnect the people
of the entire ocean.

346
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:36,521

Moana, you need a crew.

358
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,569
Heihei and Pua don't count.

359
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,738
It's the other side
of the ocean.

360
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,073
How could I ask them to...

361
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:32,953
Our people will rise,
if you let them.

362
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,454
Last time,
the chicken made it.

363
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,127
Well, then I'm gonna
need a bigger canoe.

364
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,463
Oh, yes! Brand-new...

365
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,756
sleek, double-hulled design.

366
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,050
My best canoe yet. Sweet!

367
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,301
Top-of-the-line upgrades
for the crew.

368
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,678
Loto!

369
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,972
I'd like you on the crew.

370
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,558
Oh! Well, we should
do better than this.

371
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,148
A farmer? On the sea?

372
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,358
We're gonna need
to eat more than fish.

373
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,278
You'd need irrigation.
Plant propagation.

374
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,656
Take even my best apprentice,
you'd starve!

375
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,533
Exactly. We need a master.

376
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,243
Yes, you do need... You...

377
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,661
Thanks, Kele! You're the best!

378
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:15,787
Walked into that one.

379
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,873
Hey, Maui.

380
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,292
It's been a while.

381
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:24,212
Um, I don't know
where you are, but...

382
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,381
Oh, I could
really use your help.

383
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,011
Maui!

384
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:34,806
-Oh. Moni.
-It's both of us, actually.

385
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,184
Maui and me.

386
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,227
It's part of a series.

387
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:41,730
Wow.

388
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,149
You know,
it's too bad Maui isn't here.

389
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,359
You really need someone
who knows all the old stories,

390
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,446
and someone who's,
like, super strong,

391
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,531
and has great hair and just...

392
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,784
I think I know someone else
kinda like that.

393
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,412
Yes!

394
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,539
I'm going with Moana

395
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,666
on a call from the ancestors!

396
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,043
Whoo!

397
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:06,004
Get ready for some
eyewitness accounts, people!

398
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,892
I'm coming with you.

399
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,646
I'll be back as soon as I can.

400
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,272
I promise.

401
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,193
What if you don't come back?

402
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,660
The ocean

403
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,912
is my friend.

404
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,549
Our friend.

405
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,487
It connects us.

406
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,371
So, there is nowhere

407
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,164
I could ever go

408
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,958
that I won't be with you.

409
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,885
So, you can take
a piece from home.

410
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,706
We love you, Moana!

411
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,216
You might wanna hold on.

412
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,478
Okay, okay, okay.

413
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,021
One more time.

414
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:14,359
This is not
the end of our story.

415
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:18,321
This is not where
our destiny is denied.

416
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,616
Together, we rise as one!

417
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:26,371
Together, we take our freedom!

418
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,626
That guy gets it.

419
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,336
Yep. I mean you, handsome.

420
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,841
Now, all you gotta do
is get my hook.

421
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,176
Get my hook.

422
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,973
Yes! Yes! Come on. You got it.

423
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,891
That's what
I'm talkin' about! Yes!

424
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,810
You're doing it!
Higher. That's it.

425
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,895
Higher! We're almost there.
Just a little...

426
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,814
No, no. No.

427
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,316
What are you...

428
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,540
Don't worry. Come on.

429
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,916
You know me.
I'll get us outta here.

430
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,253
No, I don't need her
to save me.

431
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,005
Again.

432
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:19,966
'Cause she'll die.

433
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,719
Nalo hates humans even more
than he hates me.

434
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,555
And let me tell you something.
He hates me a lot!

435
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,432
So, the farther Curly
is from any of this,

436
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,641
the better.

437
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:32,187
We're on our own!

438
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,106
Yeah, I got it.

439
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,653
I would let you out, but...

440
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,782
Well, I'm really hoping
to meet your little friend.

441
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,909
I have plans for you both.

442
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,536
What? Hey...

443
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,663
Enjoy your lunch!

444
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,978
Loto! What are you doing?

445
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,980
I'm making improvements.

446
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,982
Okay.

447
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,901
The canoe is perfect as it is.

448
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,569
Perfection's a myth.

449
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,781
There is only failing,
then learning, then death.

450
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,160
Moni! The oar?

451
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,787
Oh. Of course.

452
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,747
That's why
you're the wayfinder.

453
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:34,999
No. No, no!

454
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:42,507
Guys, the entire ocean
is kind of counting on us.

455
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,509
So we've got to rise
to the moment,

456
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,677
stay on course,

457
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:48,096
and keep everyone
on the canoe.

458
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,889
Wait. Where's the farmer?

459
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,183
Ow!

460
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:55,228
When will the canoe
stop moving?

461
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,355
Well, we're kind of
on the ocean.

462
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,985
-Moni!
-Loto. Moni's the other one.

463
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,030
Guys, we'll never make it...

464
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,991
...if you don't
embrace the ocean!

465
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,158
You can't
embrace a liquid.

466
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,119
Also, I cannot swim!

467
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,537
You know it feels like
you could...

468
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,330
Okay. That's...

469
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,207
Now everyone looks sad.

470
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,918
And whoever designed
the canoe forgot a bathroom!

471
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,420
Yeah. I did the design,
but we're all here.

472
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,671
Why did
I say yes to this?

473
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,298
I shouldn't even...

474
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,512
I am unclear
as to what you are doing.

475
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,680
Guys!

476
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,850
We wanna reach Motufetu,
break Nalo's curse,

477
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,935
we've gotta come together.

00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,354
Find. Our. Rhythm!

580
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,611

a lot of directions

other than "follow the comet."

582
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,782

583
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:20,159

would be super awesome.

586
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,668
It's Motufetu!

587
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,171
We found it.

588
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,923
Really quickly.

589
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,758
Do I hear people?

590
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,304
That's no island.

591
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,265
And those

592
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,016
aren't people.

593
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,270
-Kakam...
-Mora?

594
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,858

595
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,041

596
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,669
A farmer murdered by coconuts.

597
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,631
Oh. So, they're just
ignoring us?

598
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,758
That's good. Isn't it?
Is it... Is that good?

00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,083

Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
Listen to me!

608
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:46,597
We are on a sacred voyage!

609
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,974
You will release us.

610
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,476
Wait. Wait!

611
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,487
Ow!

612
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,364
Ow, ow, ow!

613
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,366
Whoa. What are you doing?

614
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,040
What is happening?

615
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,553
Uh... That is...

616
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:27,930
Fanfic.

617
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,225
You dolt. They're asking
if you drew it,

618
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:34,812
'cause they want you
to translate that picture.

619
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,147
Oh!

620
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:38,941
Oh.

621
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,778
Oh. Your home island

622
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,533
is in the same sea
as Motufetu.

623
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,370
And when Nalo
divided the ocean

624
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:54,040
to weaken the people
of the sea,

625
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:57,918
your ancestors were
disconnected from their home.

626
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:02,715
But you thought you'd finally
found the way back

627
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,926
when you ran
into this giant clam.

628
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:11,057
And now, you're worried
you'll stay separated forever.

629
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:15,102
This whole time,

630
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:18,147
they've just been trying
to get home.

631
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:25,112
But if we help you
defeat the clam,

632
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,031
you'll help us reach Motufetu.

633
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:30,701
Together.

634
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,913
Hello? We're still jelly!

635
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,998
How're we gonna beat that?

636
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,918
Floppy can't even
wiggle a finger.

637
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:41,837
Well, our muscles
are full of neurotoxin, so...

638
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,798
Wait. Wait. Hang on.

639
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,008
A clam is basically
one giant muscle.

640
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,718
So, we get close enough
with that stuff,

641
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,886
shoot it in the ganglion,

642
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,722
it's goodnight clam,
hello Motufetu.

643
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,641
Do you think that'll work?

644
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,441
Oh. You want us to do it.

645
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,112
It'd be easier
if we're not jelly.

646
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,281
Ooh. Don't worry.
They can fix that.

647
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:10,658
How?

648
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,624
What is that?

649
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,437
Tastes like coconut.

650
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,564
It just went right over
the top of us, didn't it?

651
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,525
Okay, where do we get
the toxin for the clam?

652
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,075
A dream from both ends.

653
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,586
Come on. We gotta go!

654
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,388
What?

655
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,476
We made a deal.

656
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,685
We take out the clam,

657
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:23,147
and then you're helping us
get to Motufetu.

658
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,524
You are small but mighty.

659
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:36,952
Whoa.

660
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,831
I think
it's a warriors' salute,

661
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,833
to show us respect.

662
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,382
Or it's goodbye
in case we croak.

663
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,263
Wow.

664
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,185
How do we shoot
the ganglion

665
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,103
if we don't know
what it looks like?

666
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,980
I think
we're gonna know

667
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,107
what a ganglion looks like
when we see it.

668
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,487
Yeah.

669
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,781
So, I just...

670
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:16,909
And Motufetu, here we come?

671
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,619
Mission accomplished.

672
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,667
No. No, no, no!

673
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,670
And this is why

674
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,505
you always have a backup.

675
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,841
And a third.

676
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,845
Well, a fourth
would be lunacy.

677
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,698
No!

678
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,421
Chee Hoo!

679
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,220
We gotta get out!

680
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,115
Wait! What are you...
Hey! No...

681
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,763
- Moni! Moni!
- Moana!

682
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,264
Moana!

683
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:20,658
Moana?

684
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:22,660
Moana?

685
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,829
Gotta say,
I enjoyed that.

686
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,998
Kakamora!

687
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,376
You did this!

688
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,675
Made an assumption there.

689
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:58,654
Fascinating.

690
00:44:58,696 --> 00:44:59,947
It's like an acid.

691
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:14,753
Can I get a Chee Hoo?

692
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:16,880
Oh, yeah!

693
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:22,845
Now,
I just gotta get my baby.

694
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,023
Maui!

695
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,526
- The tattoo moves.
- Hey.

696
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,902
- The tattoo moves!
- Ow. No. No, no, no.

697
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,446
Listen to me.
I am a demigod...

698
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,239
-Lucky!
-Stop it!

699
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,449
I want to be slapped
by the tattoo.

700
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,742
Hey!

701
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,744
Okay. Rule number one...

702
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:47,953
No.

703
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,621
Just... Okay. Someone...

704
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:51,623
Guys, could you please
just roll me back?

705
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:52,791
- I'll roll you back!
- No, no, no.

706
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,126
Not him.

707
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,130
This is what happens
when you meet your heroes.

708
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,215
Oh! I know, right?

709
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,760
Okay.

710
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:05,679
Rule number one.
You never saw me like this.

711
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,556
Even though
I still look very cool.

712
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,266
You look like a kidney stone.

713
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:11,059
And you look like someone
who would know what that is.

714
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,561
Now...

715
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,816
Well, hello, Bacon.

716
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,360
Okay. I feel like
there's some backstory

717
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:21,904
that I need
to get caught up on.

718
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,197
-Oh. Um...
-Actually, you know what?

719
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:24,364
Scratch that.

720
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:25,991
I don't wanna
get attached if y'all...

721
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,368
You know what I mean?

722
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,536
Which you guys won't.

723
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,704
You're not gonna do that.

724
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,955
I don't even know
why I said that.

725
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:33,916
The point is,
there's some serious god stuff

726
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:34,958
going down...

727
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,921
So, I'mma go
handle my business.

728
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,017
All right. Be back in a bit.

729
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,269
Until then,
stay alive, talk to no one.

730
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,772
And, if you see
a crazy bat lady, run.

731
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,023
She is the worst.

732
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,733
Stay away, or you will die.

733
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,693
Be good. Maui, out!

734
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,613
Boat snack!

735
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:06,573
Boat snack.

736
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:09,827
Where's Moana?

737
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,836
Simea?

738
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:20,963
Simea! Oh!

739
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,215
How are you here?

740
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,550
I'm not.

741
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:27,553
You got sucked inside
a giant clam

742
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,429
and our story will end

743
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:33,392
'cause now, you'll never help
the people of the ocean

744
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:35,477
and your ancestors
will be, like,

745
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:40,691
"Moana, we hate you forever.
Forever. Forever."

746
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:43,861
Huh?

747
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,256
I got this.

748
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,425
I got this.

749
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:07,926
You got this.

750
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,180
Relax.

751
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,682
I don't bite.

752
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:14,725
Peka might.

753
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:19,146
It's been a while
since I've seen a wayfinder.

754
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,648
Love the oar.

755
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,150
Would you like
to see me use it?

756
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:25,611
Ooh. Feisty.

757
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:28,947
Well, we have that
in common, Moana.

758
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:32,409
The human who's
"got all the gods talking"!

759
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,079
Who are you?

760
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,247
Matangi.

761
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:40,250
Guardian of this
little slice of paradise.

762
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,169
-Oh!
-Hmm.

763
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,630
You live here?

764
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:46,006
Not by choice.

765
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:49,051
Maui never mentioned me?

766
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,179
Oh! Probably too busy
playing with his tattoo.

767
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,347
Huh?

768
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,183
Well, come on, then.

769
00:48:57,225 --> 00:49:00,312
Um, I'm not
going anywhere with you.

770
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,521
-I need to...
-Get outta here,

771
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:04,858
break Nalo's curse,
find Motufetu.

772
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,151
Here to help.

773
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,320
You know the way to Motufetu?

774
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,030
You think you can
only get somewhere

775
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,573
if you know the way?

776
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,284
That's kinda
what wayfinding is.

777
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,911
Ugh!

778
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,704
So much to learn.

779
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:25,170
A true wayfinder doesn't
know the path at all.

780
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,672
That's the whole point.

781
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:30,592
To find your way
to what's never been found.

782
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,761
If you wanna
break Nalo's curse,

783
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,097
you gotta stop
playing it safe, sis.

784
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,598
Get a little lost.

785
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,851
Why would I listen
to anything you say?

786
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:43,146
Because Nalo trapped me, too.

787
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,150
I want you to beat Nalo,

788
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:49,778
'cause then, I'll be free.

789
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,238

00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,217
What are you gonna do?

853
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:04,181
Get lost.

854
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:10,020
♪ Woah! Get lost! ♪

855

Portal of the gods.

857
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,842
Won't get you all the way
to Motufetu.

858
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,803
But it'll shorten the commute
for you and your crew

859
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:45,889
and Mr. Coconut Oil.

860
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:46,973
Who's Mr...

861
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:49,100
Ugh.

862
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:51,645
Always has to make
an entrance.

863
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:53,355
-Maui!
-Do not fear!

864
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:56,191
You have been rescued! Whoo!

865
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,874
She opened it?

866
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,763
This was your plan,

867
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:28,306
to keep me in a snot cave

868
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:29,808
because you want us
to go together?

869
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:33,144
Well, I certainly did not
keep you for the conversation.

870
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,271
Huh? Wait!

871
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,440
Well, shall we?

872
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,446
You can't leave?

873
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,699
Break Nalo's curse...

874
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:49,286
and maybe, one day,
we'll see each other again.

875
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:52,998
Remember, there's always
another way

876
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:55,583
even if you have to get lost
to find it.

877
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,253
Good luck, Tautai Moana.

878
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,547
You got this.

879
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:11,433
If Nalo finds out I helped,
we'll die by lightning.

880
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,978
Maui looked good.

881
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:17,897
Whoa. Whoa.

882
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:19,274
Whoa!

883
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,442
I'm kissing the pig!

884
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,609
Happy, happy, happy! Hey, hey!

885
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,820
We're in a portal of the gods!

886
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,824
You guys! Together again!

887
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,284
Plus Maui. Wait, wait.

888
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,452
Where's Maui?

889
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:31,619
'Sup, Curly?

890
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:32,871
Maui!

891
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,042
Could've told me
we're doin' new outfits.

892
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,209
Been rockin' leaves
on my cheeks

893
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,794
for a thousand years.

894
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,338
I can't believe you're here!

895
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:43,048
Hey, buddy. I missed ya.

896
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,632
Yeah.

897
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,634
Oh. Sorry.

898
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:47,927
That was weird.
Was that weird?

899
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:50,472
This is
the greatest day of my life.

900
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:55,101
Love this guy.
Not creeping me out at all.

901
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,436
Can I talk to you
for a second?

902
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:59,189
Pua! This is Pua.

903
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,565
Ooh. And did you meet
the Kakamora?

904
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:01,733
I thought
he'd do us in on the clam,

905
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,109
but it turns out
he was super great

906
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,528
'cause otherwise, I never
would have met Matangi,

907
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:06,696
who's great, by the way,

908
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:08,031
- and found you, and now...
- Curly!

909
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,491
...we're gonna break
Nalo's curse together and...

910
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,369
Sorry. You go.

911
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:13,703
You're all gonna die.

912
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,499
What?

913
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,708
What?

914
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,503
Nalo didn't just hide
Motufetu in a storm.

915
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,463
He hid it
in a monster storm

916
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:25,548
in a cursed ocean
you can't escape from

917
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,593
and then sunk it
to the bottom of the sea.

918
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,720
Which means
a human can't reach it.

919
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,555
So, unless
I break the curse,

920
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:34,516
you just bought a one-way
ticket to deadsville,

921
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,683
which is why I didn't want you

922
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:36,851
coming out
in the first place

923
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,144
'cause now you're stuck

924
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,688
and you're gonna die,
your crew's gonna die,

925
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,357
and this time,
so is the chicken.

926
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:50,740
But...

927
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:51,866
it's great to see you.

928
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:53,910
And we're here.

929
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:08,299
Good one, Maui,

930
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:12,178
but this place
looks perfectly nice.

931
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:14,597
And look!

932
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:15,974
The constellation!

933
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,767
It's right there!

934
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,854
Guys...

935
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:24,232
The ancestors wouldn't have
called if we couldn't do this.

936
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,151
Unless it was a butt dial.

937
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:28,153
That'll make sense
in 2,000 years.

938
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:30,238
Tautai Vasa
said reaching Motufetu

939
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,158
is the only way
to give our people a future.

940
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,576
If he knows so much,

941
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,161
how come he didn't
tell you it was...

942
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:37,871
...sunk?

943
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:42,083
Because he told me to follow
the fire in the sky.

944
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,127
And that led me
straight to you.

945
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:46,421
Which makes sense,

946
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,882
'cause if Nalo thinks
he's stronger

947
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:50,383
by keeping people apart...

948
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:53,094
Then maybe the way
to break his curse

949
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,304
is by coming together.

950
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:57,765
You lift the island,
and I step on it.

951
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:00,393
"Maui and Moana,
together again!

952
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:01,978
"They're so amazing!"

953
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,271
This is gonna work.

954
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,522
Right, ocean?

955
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,150
Ocean?

956
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:14,699
Moana...

957
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:17,368
The ocean

958
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,995
cannot help you here.

959
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:27,045
Gramma!

960
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:33,092
Actually, I believe
that's a welcome gift

961
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:35,678
from Nalo.

962
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,481
Hmm.

963
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:55,740
Take that, sucka!

964
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:59,327
Humans, get to your positions,
work together,

965
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,162
and let's do this!

966
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:05,041
We really gotta talk about

967
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,251
your recruiting process.

968
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:09,254
Gramps! Down below.

969
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,257
Hate these guys.

970
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:13,633
Hey! I'm an elder.

971
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,218
And I'm 3,000 years old.

972
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,970
Which makes me elder-er.

973
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:20,557
Just gotta outrun 'em
till sunrise.

974
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,100
Oh. Are they nocturnal?

975
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:25,687
Uh, sure. Chee Hoo!

976
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:28,523
Oh, yeah!

977
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,280
Whoo!

978
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:40,118
Did he just wink at us?

979
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:43,538
Behind us!

980
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,498
Hang on!

981
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,333
Moana, we can't turn
that tight with this sail.

982
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,085
It'll work!

983
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:53,089
Moana!

984
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:57,093
Moni!

985
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:00,722
Moana! Moana!

986
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:02,390
Moni!

987
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:07,145
No! The oar!

988
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:23,453
Moni!

989
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,671
Moni...

990
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,997
We'll figure this out.

991
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,457
- The ancestors...
- Moana...

992
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,511
Tautai Vasa's canoe...

993
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:30,061
Uh, it's a bad time to say,
"I told you so,"

994
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:31,354
so I'm not gonna do that

995
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:32,730
'cause that would
make you feel worse.

996
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,941
-Just...
-But I believe in you.

997
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:37,151
No one else does.
There you go.

998
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:38,903
Walk it off, champ. What?

999
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,196
I was being nice.

1000
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:41,781
Ow. Ow!

1001
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,533
No purple nurples. Stop. Ow!

1002
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:44,951
Okay, I'll talk to her!

1003
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:53,209
I know, Maui.

1004
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:55,962
It's just...

1005
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:00,925
Every time I think I know

1006
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:02,969
what I'm supposed to do,

1007
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,680
everything changes.

1008
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:07,598
I can't...

1009
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:10,226
Moni almost died!

1010
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:17,316
If I'm the reason our people's
story just ends...

1011
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,196
This is serious!

1012
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,157
Is something distracting you?

1013
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:26,242
Maybe breaking the curse
is like you said,

1014
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:27,452
we gotta work together.

1015
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:28,786
I pull it from the sea,

1016
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:31,581
but a human has to land
on its shores.

1017
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:38,629
Look, I get it.

1018
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:40,757
No one likes
sucking at their job.

1019
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:43,176
Why are you even here?

1020
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:44,260
Because...

1021
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:46,554
Because...

1022
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:48,890
I've been low before.

1023
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:53,019
And I couldn't
see a way forward.

1024
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,022
And then someone came along.

1025
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:58,900
Someone who I underestimated.

1026
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,736
And she lifted me up.

1027
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:07,033
I haven't done anything right

1028
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:08,910
since I left my island.

1029
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:09,952
Hey...

1030
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,164
There is a way out.

1031
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,582
You wanna get through it?

1032
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:17,251
You just gotta Chee Hoo it.

1033
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:18,711
You are so bad at this.

1034
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:20,505
I'm the best at this.

1035
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:22,590
I was a human, but now,

1036
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,258
I'm a demigod.

1037
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,302
You never know what's next.

1038
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,637
Yeah, I do.

1039
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:29,472
Nalo's monster storm!

1040
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:30,723
Well, you wanna
get through it?

1041
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:31,891

01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,111
Well, a lot of people
think you are.

1139
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:34,657
Uh...

1140
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:38,035
I know what I've asked of you

1141
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:39,620
is a lot...

1142
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,289
that our canoe is in

1143
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,000
really rough shape,

1144
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:48,713
but I believe that,
together, we...

1145
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:11,027
We found a way to fix it.

1146
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:13,571
With a little help
from the ancestors, yeah.

1147
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:16,032
I did the decorations.

1148
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:17,616
We used the chicken.

1149
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:20,536
Respect.

1150
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:27,334
Nalo wants to end our story.

1151
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:29,670
But we're not
letting that happen.

1152
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,005
We just have to outsmart him,

1153
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,799
find some new tricks
he's never seen before.

1154
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:37,428
Well, I have been
working on some ideas.

1155
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:40,014
Also, we do have a demigod.

1156
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,807
Sure, he's a little scruffy,

1157
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:43,517
but, you know,
better than nothing.

1158
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:44,935
I think you look great.

1159
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:49,315
Okay. We sail to the heart
of Nalo's storm.

1160
01:07:49,356 --> 01:07:54,153
Once I raise the island,
you all have to get to it.

1161
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:57,281
It'll be harder than anything
we've faced before.

1162
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:58,449
So, if anyone wants to...

1163
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:07,541
I spent my whole life
learning our people's stories.

1164
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:12,088
Because of you,
I get to live one.

1165
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:15,925
All right, then.

1166
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,469
Let's break a curse.

1167
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:23,432
Yeah.

1168
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:25,017
Been a while

1169
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:26,811
since I pulled
an island from the sea.

1170
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:29,605
I know I have to bend
at the knees.

1171
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:31,774
I have great posture.

1172
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:33,526
You know what? You, armpit.

1173
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:39,657
He's growing on me.

1174
01:08:40,574 --> 01:08:41,784
Like a wart.

1175
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:43,160
That's beautiful.

1176
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:44,537
Okay, we do this,

1177
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,205
we make it home.

1178
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:48,916
Curly.

1179
01:08:55,589 --> 01:08:56,757
It's a storm.

1180
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:59,343
Just a really big one.

1181
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,863
Well, now I kind of miss
the lava monster.

1182
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:26,412
Um, that's a big wave.

1183
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:30,916
We can go around it.

1184
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:32,459
Everyone,
get to your positions!

1185
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,253
Be ready to switch it up.

1186
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:37,173
You, smart-stuff,

1187
01:09:37,214 --> 01:09:38,883
you might wanna
check the sundial.

1188
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:40,301
Why? What time is it?

1189
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:42,469
-It's Maui time!
-It's Maui time!

1190
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:43,929
Whoo!

1191
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:47,224
Let's lift an island and show
this windbag who's boss!

1192
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:48,392
Yeah!

1193
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,394
Bring the thunder!

1194
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:56,442
I mean,
it's kinda fun, right?

1195
01:09:56,483 --> 01:09:58,402
Chee Hoo!

1196
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:03,949
Yeah! Whoo!

1197
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:08,329
Booyah!

1198
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:12,499
Switch it up,
we're going over.

1199
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:14,126
-Loto?
-On it!

1200
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:25,763
Eat it, Nalo!

1201
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:32,561
Yeah, how 'bout this?

1202
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:33,646
Wait, what?

1203
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:40,903
Yeah!

1204
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:43,739
Count it!

1205
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:50,829
Oh, come on!

1206
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:54,833
They keep coming for us!

1207
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:56,335
We gotta turn! Guys?

1208
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:10,015
No, no, no.

1209
01:11:13,143 --> 01:11:15,354
Maui!

1210
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:18,065
It's okay. I got half of 'em.
Scoreboard.

1211
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:26,824
Well, Nalo's a cheater.

1212
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:30,119
And a coward for...

1213
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,871
avoiding... you know.

1214
01:11:32,913 --> 01:11:35,541
He doesn't care about you.

1215
01:11:35,582 --> 01:11:37,418
Oh, he cares about me.

1216
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:41,964
I'm saying it's humans
he wants to stop... us.

1217
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:44,508
Why are you smiling?

1218
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,010
'Cause we can use it.

1219
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:47,928
Distract Nalo,
let him come after us

1220
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,930
while Maui
reaches the center

1221
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:51,598
and lifts the island.

1222
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,559
-We switch it up.
-Okay.

1223
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,228
Curly, you couldn't
outmaneuver the storm before.

1224
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:57,688
How you gonna do it now?

1225
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,231
I think I have figured it out.

1226
01:12:00,357 --> 01:12:02,901
I will need to chop the mast.

1227
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:06,989
If you keep coming back
to help us,

1228
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:08,991
we'll never break
Nalo's curse.

1229
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:12,953
We can draw the storm, Maui.

1230
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,204
It's the only way.

1231
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:25,174
Go as fast as you can.

1232
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:29,303
Uh, look, I could
pull up a million islands,

1233
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:32,639
but, if you're not there
to land on them, then...

1234
01:12:35,976 --> 01:12:37,519
See you out there, Maui.

1235
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:41,315
I'll see ya out there, Moana.

1236
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:45,486
Bacon, Eggs...

1237
01:12:49,823 --> 01:12:51,116
Giant hawk!

1238
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:55,829
So serious.

1239
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:57,289
See ya on the island!

1240
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:06,507
Loto!

1241
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:08,217
Move!

1242
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:15,724
The spinny thing is coming!

1243
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:20,104
Probably should have
prototyped this.

1244
01:13:21,021 --> 01:13:22,314
Bingo bango!

1245
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:34,410
Loto! You're a genius.

1246
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:36,578
Well, I couldn't have done it
without Moni.

1247
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:13,323
Hold on!

1248
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:24,334
Not a lot of leverage!

1249
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:33,677
He found Motufetu!

1250
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:38,140
Nalo knows he found it.

1251
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:39,933
The curse won't be broken
till we reach the island.

1252
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:41,768
We still have to reach
the island!

1253
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:42,811
Go!

1254
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:50,986
Little busy.

1255
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:56,033
It's another wave.

1256
01:14:56,074 --> 01:14:57,367
We need more speed.

1257
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:01,455
We have to drop weight.

1258
01:15:09,129 --> 01:15:10,130
Come on, kid!

1259
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:12,508
Hang on!

1260
01:15:12,549 --> 01:15:13,675
Turn!

1261
01:15:13,717 --> 01:15:14,927
Turn!

1262
01:15:22,976 --> 01:15:24,645
Lift it!

1263
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:36,990
No!

1264
01:15:40,285 --> 01:15:42,037
Maui!

1265
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:54,132
Maui...

1266
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:10,649
Maui!

1267
01:16:11,692 --> 01:16:12,818
No!

1268
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:27,082
Moana!

1269
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:30,294
We're lost!

1270
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,587
I don't know
what to do!

1271
01:16:31,628 --> 01:16:32,879
There's no way out!

1272
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:36,883
I can't...

1273
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:37,968
There's a--

1274
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,219
There's no way!

1275
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:46,101
There's another way.

1276
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:49,104
There's always another way.

1277
01:16:50,814 --> 01:16:52,774
There's another way
to reach the island!

1278
01:16:52,816 --> 01:16:54,192
There's another way!

1279
01:16:54,234 --> 01:16:55,986
- No! Moana, you can't!
- It's too far!

1280
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:57,195
- Find Maui!
- Moana!

1281
01:16:57,237 --> 01:16:58,405
No! Moana!

1282
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:17,693
Moana?

1283
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:19,111
Moana!

1284
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:51,435
Moana...

1285
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:52,978
Moana.

1286
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:57,023
Moana, you can't.

1287
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:07,826
Please...

1288
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:13,790
Please.

1289
01:21:58,705 --> 01:22:00,290
Together still.

1290
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:03,418
Just a little different.

01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:25,375
You leveled up.

1304
01:23:26,459 --> 01:23:28,169
Yeah.

1305
01:23:28,211 --> 01:23:31,589
Uh... So, does this mean...

1306
01:23:31,631 --> 01:23:34,300
Yes. My tattoos are still
cooler than yours.

1307
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:38,930
Happy dance!

1308
01:23:41,057 --> 01:23:42,851
That was such
a crazy...

1309
01:23:42,892 --> 01:23:44,686
And then... Hang on. Oh, wow!

1310
01:23:44,728 --> 01:23:45,895
Yeah.

1311
01:23:45,937 --> 01:23:48,356
Moana! You're alive!

1312
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:54,529
Ocean!

1313
01:23:55,071 --> 01:23:56,489
I missed you.

1314
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:58,575
Come on. Come on, now.
Little bit more.

1315
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:03,204
Raisin' an island
really works up an appetite.

1316
01:24:03,246 --> 01:24:04,497
Oh, you smell so good.

1317
01:24:15,258 --> 01:24:17,469
It's Motunui.

1318
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:19,095
Home.

1319
01:24:22,098 --> 01:24:23,641
That one's his.

1320
01:24:24,809 --> 01:24:26,603
I now speak Kakamora.

1321
01:24:27,687 --> 01:24:30,190
There's so much
out there.

1322
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:31,357
Yeah.

1323
01:24:31,941 --> 01:24:33,902
And who knows?

1324
01:24:33,943 --> 01:24:37,447
Maybe one day, we'll find...

1325
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:44,537
I'm gonna need you
to stop doing that.

1326
01:25:03,723 --> 01:25:04,724
People?

1327
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,185
It's people!

1328
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:03,074
Boom! Nailed it.

1329
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,368
Ugh. This is a mess.

1330
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:06,411
You're welcome.

1331
01:26:07,787 --> 01:26:09,289
Hey, how's it going?

1332
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:11,624
Awesome hair whip.

1333
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:15,128
All right. Guys,
I'm looking for a Simea.

1334
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:16,796
Hi.

1335
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:18,464
Is there a Simea here?

1336
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:19,757
Huh?

1337
01:26:24,762 --> 01:26:26,556
I'm Simea.

1338
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:27,849
You're her, all right.

1339
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:30,268
Uh, let me just, um...

1340
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:32,270
Maui!

1341
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:34,772
Moanabes!
Hold that a sec!

1342
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:39,152
I thought you'd be bigger.

1343
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:41,362
Yeah. Like, a lot bigger.

1344
01:26:41,404 --> 01:26:44,407
Okay. Your sister sent me

1345
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:46,576
with a present for ya.

1346
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:48,119
Straight from Motufetu.

1347
01:26:48,661 --> 01:26:49,871
Wow.

1348
01:26:52,248 --> 01:26:53,708
What's it do?

1349
01:26:57,670 --> 01:27:00,089
Little sis!

1350
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:03,218
Big sis!

1351
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:10,975

1352
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:14,437
Big sis!

1353
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:33,414
I like what you brought me.

1354
01:27:34,707 --> 01:27:37,377

Do you wanna hear a song?

01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:37,134
I've got a new one.
It's called Funky Crab Legs.
