Anonymous tip off.

202
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,087
The address of Stanley Chapman.

203
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,366
- You promised me Freddie Thorne.
-This is instead of Freddie Thorne.

204
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,283
- No deal.
-Inspector,

205
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,844
Stanley Chapman is a bigger
fish than Freddie Thorne.

206
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,211
He's currently holding £200 in cash

207
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,562
given to The Communist Party
by the Russian government.

208
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,722
That's right, Chapman
has snow on his boots.

209
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,168
And all you need is a shovel.

210
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,321
If he talks, you'll have proof.

211
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,530
You might even get that medal.

212
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,440
Now,

213
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,683
before I give you the address,

214
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,171
I want your word

215
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,444
that you'll let Freddie Thorne

216
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,281
and my sister leave the city.

217
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,127
Very well. You have my word.

218
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,205
I'd say our little truce
has proven quite

219
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,851
productive for both of us, Inspector.

220
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,201
I'll get the information and protection.

221
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,369
And you? Well...

222
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,450
You get Bolsheviks.

223
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,084
But on a more pressing matter,

224
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,844
I'm afraid that Mr Churchill
is becoming impatient.

225
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,810
And I fear that,

226
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,564
if you don't get back
those stolen weapons soon,

227
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,845
I will be replaced.

228
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,482
That will be the finish
for me, that's for sure.

229
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,487
When my business with Kimber is done,

230
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,962
the guns will be returned.
That was the deal.

231
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,646
Then I'm in your hands, completely.

232
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,210
You hold all the cards.

233
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,451
But, I hope to God that
my dismissal doesn't come

234
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,763
before your decision to
hand back those guns.

235
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,482
And I say this for your sake because,

236
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,562
if I were to be fired,
and it were your fault,

237
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,321
I would do things that
would shame the devil.

240

On my last day in power, for example,

241
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,966
I would see to it

242
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,886
that you and your scum brothers have
your heads stowed in with mallets

243
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,321
and spades.

244
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,010
And your sister, too.

245
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,409
That baby inside her would
be of no consequence to me.

The only one to be spared

247
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,608
would be your little brother Finn.

248
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,842
He would, however, be lifted,
as a juvenile,

249
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,570
and dumped in that part
of the adult prison

00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,571
where men have the most
appetite for boys like him.

if my dismissal comes
before your decision.

254
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,530

he'll tell us everything he knows.

That's how desperate she is to get out
of that rat hole you're keeping her in.

You did a deal for me.

308
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,481
Don't flatter yourself. For Ada.

309

And you think this copper
will keep his word?

310
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,570
If he does, you're safe.
If he doesn't, Chapman will give you up.

311
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,729
You'll still have to leave
town, same result.

- So neat.
-So leave.

Except there's one thing that
you've got wrong,

314
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,449
Stanley won't be able to give up my
address because he doesn't know it.

315
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,842
That's how it works.
None of us know each other's addresses.

And they'll keep beating him and beating
him for information he doesn't have.

318
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,362
So all you've done is sign the
death warrant of a good man.

319
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,450
- So you won't leave?
-No, I won't fucking leave.

320
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,767
And if you want me out of Birmingham,
it'll have to be in a wooden box.

321
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,330
You lay a hand on our Ada and I'll
put you in a wooden box myself.

322
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,806
You raised a stubborn one there, Irene.

323
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,324
You told me to carry on.

324
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,004
I wanted to stop.

325
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,648
He had some kind of seizure.

326
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,002
(SIGHS) So you killed him.

327
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,641
Did he give you an address?

328
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,731
What's the matter with you?
He fell down some stairs.

329
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,928
This is not bloody Belfast.

330
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,602
Not yet, but if men like him
get their way, it soon will be.

331
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,408
So find some stairs, throw him
down, and call the coroner.

332
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,366
Use Grayson.

333
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,010
If he has any awkward questions,

334
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,970
ask about the welfare of his mistress
in Saltley.

335
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,610
That'll shut him up.

336
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,800
To think I used to live
in a shithole like this.

337
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,845
Bloody animals.

338
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,730
The Shelbys really are doing
an excellent job for us.

339
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,566
We haven't lost a single penny to

340
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,881
rafflers or chalkers
in eight race meetings.

341
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,686
The bookies are purring.

342
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,968
So we throw the dog a bone.

343
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,201
I think so.

344
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,082
Mr Kimber, Mr Roberts,
come and have a look around.

345
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,001
After you.

346

(INDISTINCT CHATTER}

347
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,163
Well, I thought the Lees
turned you over?

348
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,641
You shouldn't listen to gossip,
Mr Kimber. This way.

349
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,046
Business is good.

350
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,850
Especially since now you know

351
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,127
which horse is going to win
before you set the odds.

352
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,961
Information is very much appreciated.

353
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,243
All right, well, where are they?

354
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,771
John, Lovelock. Scudboat, in here.

355
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,331
This is my team.

356
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,526
They will take up their pitch at your
convenience, Mr Kimber.

357
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,049
John is the book, Scudboat is the
bag man, and of course,

358
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,930
we bring our own protection.

359
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,128
Warwick, next Saturday,
at least 50 yards from the beer tent.

360

Gentleman, and lady.

361
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,484
I have in my hand

362
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,044
a legal betting licence,
issued by the Board of Control.

363
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,969
The Shelby family has its first, legal

364

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,721
Congratulations.

367
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,161
There you go.

368
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,841
Congratulations.

30, 40, 50...

370
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,728
These cigarettes
have a strange smell, Arthur.

371
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,881
They smell like rotting water.

372
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,207
And look,

373
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,725
rats have got into some of them.

374
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,447
They're stolen, are they not?

375
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,641
Don't ask.

376
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,085
They smell because you
keep them in the boat.

377
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,607
What do you care? Now, can you
come check my adding up, please?

378
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,487
You know, you should make a
new start of this place.

379
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,041
Do it properly-

380
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,169
These cigarettes are not fit to sell.

381
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,921
Smells like Gallipoli.

382
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,327
You should find a new
place to store them.

383
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,681
It has to be far away from coppers.

384
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,171
Oh, but not rats.

385
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,487
All the wharves have rats, Grace.

386
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,924
What's wrong with a dry warehouse?

387
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,326
Tommy's orders.

388
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,566
What orders?

389
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,282
Always keep contraband near
petrol boat moorings.

390
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,211
Don't boats get searched?

391
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,884
We moor them at junctions.

392
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,850
So there's more than one way out.

393
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,050
No locks within a mile
so we can move that stuff,

394
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,601
fast.

395
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,929
Your brother doesn't obey the law,
but he has rules.

396
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,050
Precise man, your brother.

397
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,366
Is my adding up right?

398
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,606
It is now.

399
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,321
CAMPBELL: One.

400
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,801
Two.

401
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,087
Three.

402
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,085
<i>And four.</i>

403

<i>And we'll search them one-by-one.</i>

404
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,450
Please, Lord, let that which
I seek be found here.

405
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,248
Not so much as a bullet, sir.

406
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,203
Just more cigarettes and whisky.

407
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,562
Arthur tells me you've
been asking questions.

408
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,010
About how we run our business

409
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,411
and how we get our booze

410
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,721
and where we keep it.

411
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,286
I'm just trying to help.

412
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,805
Let's you and me go for a walk.

413
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,486
Where to?

414
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,721
Come on.

415
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,326
Why here?

416
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,002
You're a good Catholic girl, aren't you?

417
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,281
Yes.

418
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,240
Well, then you know it's here
people come to confess.

419
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,164
(SIGHS) After you.

420
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,165
Well, here it is, Grace.

421
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,406
I'll confess.

422
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,721
I need someone.

423
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,766
Kimber has an adviser by
the name of Roberts.

424
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,246
He talks well.

425
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,130
Keeps the accounts.

426
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,649
Runs the legal side of the business.

427
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,086
And you need a Roberts?

428
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,170
Arthur tells me you have ideas.

429
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,564
I'm not an accountant, nor a lawyer.

430
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,721
No.

431
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,489
No, but you have something 1 need.

432
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,961
Class.

433
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,447
I need someone who looks
right at the big meetings.

434
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,365
Epsom, Ascot.

435
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,771
Is this a job interview?

436
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,330
Arthur says you're good with numbers.

437
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,404
(LAUGHS) Oh, well, that's relative.
He's quite poor.

(SCOFFS)

439
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,245
You keep the books in order.

440
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,560
They were chaotic.

441
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,891
But you're a liar.

442
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,564
No Catholic girl would enter a church

443
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,404
and forget to make
the sign of the cross.

444
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,007
You're very perceptive.

445
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,924
First, you lied to me about that
pub you used to work in.

446
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,563
Now I find out you're a Protestant.

447
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,404
- Do you care?
-No.

448
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,731
I like to fit in.

449
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,326
You pull a pint

450
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,085
like someone who's thinking about it.

451
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,089
This is not an interview,
this is an interrogation.

455
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,609
You've washed up in a

00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,441
for whatever reason.

And perhaps mine.

00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,929
You know that most of
what I do is illegal?

460
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,846
I'm not blind.

461
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,449
And yet you'd still be
willing to work for me?

462
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,970
Are you offering me the job?

00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,561
Then I accept.

465
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,925
There's something else you should know.

466
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,084
A very important detail about
my reasons for employing you.

467
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,406
You disappoint me.

468
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,360
No you resign?

469
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,921
No.

470
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,208
My appetite for the work
has only increased.

to try to talk you out of it.

00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,766
I just want to talk.

482
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,681
Then you're against us?

483
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,170
John is his own man.

484
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,526
And you're your own woman.

485
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,961
Now, Lizzie,

486
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,242
since I came back from France,
I've come to you on many occasions.

487
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,605
Tommy, you didn't tell him?

488
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,366
No, I didn't tell him.

489
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,204
Just like you didn't tell him.

490
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,045
Now, why didn't you tell him, Lizzie?

491
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,531
Why didn't you tell him

492
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,930
that you've been sewing
his brother for the past two years?

493
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,005
Because the past is the past.

494
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,929
I don't want to lose him.
He's a good man.

495
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,683
That was the answer I was hoping
you'd give. The past is the past.

496
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,123
You see, our john says you've changed.

497
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,647
And I believe him, and that's good.

498
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,361
Change is good.

499
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,209
These are new times I'm told.

500
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,043
So I wish you both every happiness.

501
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,962
And I want you to see that as
my wedding gift to you

502
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,811
and our farewell

503
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,086
to pleasures gone by.

504
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,241
You mean...

505
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,641
One last time?

506
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,081
One last time.

507
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,481
You and me.

508
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,686
It's eight bloody pounds.

510
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,201
So where should we go?

511
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,365
Tommy, should we go to my lodging?

512
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,123
So the past is not the past.

513
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,203
You can keep the money, Lizzie,
just get out of the car.

514
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,044
- Tommy, please!
-just get out of the car.

515
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,124
I love him, Tommy, really.

516
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,281
Really.

517
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,685
John will make his own decision.

518
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,681
But he will have the facts.

519

Of that I have no doubt.

522
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,284
Well, he's obviously not stupid.

523
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,407
All we found was stolen
tobacco and whisky.

524
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,966
Which you left it in place?

525
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,401
Of course.

526
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,325
I would never endanger you.

527
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,041
You're doing well, Grace.

528
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,929
I've been working on Arthur.
He's easier.

529
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,721
Than Thomas?

530
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,841
Yes.

531
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,760
Less intelligent.

532
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,881
Yes.

533
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,642
That's not a word you'd
use about Thomas.

534

It's your word.

535
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,601
He has promoted me.

536
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,531
He wants me to be
his bookkeeper and secretary.

537
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,121
A cut-throat gangster with a secretary.

538
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,323
The pretensions of these
hoodlums are quite breathtaking.

539

Are they not?

540
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,324
Yes, quite breathtaking.

541
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,689
He's obviously fallen
quite heavily for you.

542
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,521
I thought you'd be pleased.

543
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,049
I just hope you remember who
you're dealing with, here.

544
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,164
A man who cuts off ears
and cuts out tongues.

545
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,531
I know what he is, sir.

546
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:54,005
The difficulty with undercover work,
Grace, is to remember what you are.

547
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,648
I come here with
good news and I get this?

I want to borrow the car.

552
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,847
I want to take Lizzie for a ride
in the country with the kids.

553
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,210
I'm going to celebrate
getting the licence.

Not a problem, john.

I need the keys.

Look, john, you're my brother.

There's something I have to tell you.

Yesterday, in the front
seat of that car,

559
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,204
I offered Lizzie some money.

560
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,921
And, john.

00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,045

you have to be limited.

Huh. If I knew someone
else who had a phone,

585

we could call them.

587
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,204
I had this delivered from
