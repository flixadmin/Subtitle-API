1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,760
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,920
Sara may not know it,

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,120
but the demon's power
lives inside of her.

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,560
When she succumbs to it,
you're going to need that gun.

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,360
- Come with us.
- What would you rather do?

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,920
Hide from A.R.G.U.S.
your whole life, or time travel?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,160
What do you think
the captain would think

8
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,560
about you re-engineering time?

9
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,720
Well, I'm no hero,
and I'm not a member of any team.

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,200
<i>Are you sure about this, Miss Tomaz?</i>

11
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,840
<i>Captain Lance did not
give you authorization</i>

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,080
<i>to initialize this program.</i>

13
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,400
That's because I didn't ask
for authorization.

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,040
Now, fire up the auxiliary generator.

15
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,200
<i>Even with the reserve power,</i>

16
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,160
<i>I don't believe my system can run
your simulation software.</i>

17
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,440
Gideon, trust me.

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,480
<i>Trust is something that grows
over time between friends.</i>

19
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,720
<i>As far as I'm concerned,
we are still acquaintances.</i>

20
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,880
Question, Gideon.

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,480
Who's ready to have
1.12 terawatts of power

22
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,400
diverted straight into her CPU?

23
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,480
<i>I'm not sure if your calculations
accurately stabilize the surge.</i>

24
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,120
<i>We should talk about this
before proceeding.</i>

25
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,640
No time. We have to run this program
before the team gets back.

26
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,240
<i>In that case, I suggest you hurry.</i>

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,640
<i>The team has just returned
on the jump ship from their mission.</i>

28
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,560
Okay. Screw it.

29
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,440
Gideon, what's happening?

30
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,040
I was going to ask the same question.
Thought you were fixing the ship.

31
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,200
Yeah, the maintenance check
took longer than expected.

32
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,280
The ship's a mess.

33
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,520
I had to re-initialize
Gideon's alpha drives.

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,880
So, how'd it go out there? Good mish?

35
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,880
I pried this cassette
from Shorty's fingers.

36
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,240
- He means Napoleon Bonaparte.
<i>- Waterloo.</i>

37
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,600
Who writes a song about losing a war?

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,120
Anyway, it was really great.

39
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,160
Even though half our band
missed the cue for our big encore.

40
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,760
Yeah, where were you guys?

41
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,920
It was my fault.

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,800
I was just not used to walking
in these go-go boots.

43
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,480
It won't happen again, Captain.

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,640
Right.

45
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,000
Gideon, let's check
the historical records.

46
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,320
See if everything is back to normal.

47
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,920
<i>According to the historical record,</i>

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,920
<i>the Battle of Waterloo
is back on track.</i>

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,600
<i>Napoleon did surrender,
and the French forces withdrew.</i>

50
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,120
Gideon? Where did she go?

51
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,920
The ship's functions
are still operational,

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,040
but it looks as though
Gideon's neural core has been fried.

53
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,320
I asked you to perform
a routine maintenance check.

54
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,160
I did run a maintenance check.

55
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,240
And maybe something else?

56
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,200
Something you want to tell us about?
Maybe show us?

57
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,480
Oh, do not make me move you.

58
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,960
You should just tell her what it is.

59
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,120
Last thing we want to do
is get Sara mad.

60
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,360
Why is that?

61
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,320
Because...

62
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,120
high blood pressure.
It takes years off your life.

63
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,040
Okay. Fine. You win.

64
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,640
I uploaded a synchronous,
multi-model simulation program

65
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,160
to Gideon's neural core.

66
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,880
A simulation program for what?

67
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,600
To see if there are any other
loopholes in history

68
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,480
- that we could exploit.
- We?

69
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,000
You mean you can exploit.

70
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,400
You're trying to hack history?

71
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,520
What exactly are you trying
to change in 2042?

72
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Oh, I don't know, Ray.

73
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,200
Maybe I'm trying to figure out
how to stop my home

74
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,040
from becoming a dystopian nightmare.

75
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,640
Look, Zari,
I let the Helen of Troy thing pass.

76
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,640
I even let it slide when you tried
to prevent Martin's death,

77
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,440
but you need to understand.

78
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,000
We are in the "fixing anachronisms"
business,

79
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,840
not the "hacking history" business.

80
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,440
Now, please go fix Gideon.

81
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,240
Hey, maybe, if you would stop
bossing me around for a second,

82
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,800
you would see this is a good idea.

83
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,320
I said "please."

84
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,760
And even if I didn't,

85
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,600
bossing you around
is part of my job as captain.

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,960
Yeah, and it's really easy
to take you seriously in that outfit.

87
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,760
You know, this whole
apathetic cool girl thing,

88
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,440
it's not as cute as you think.

89
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,320
If you want to be
a member of this team...

90
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,680
Member-ish.

91
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,440
This was always
a temporary arrangement.

92
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,800
I was never planning
on sticking around for long.

93
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,880
Then so long as you are on this ship,
I am your captain,

94
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,880
and if you don't like it,
you can stop sticking around.

95
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,520
Aye, aye.

96
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,320
I'm going to kill her.

97
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,120
Wait. Sara. Please, don't...

98
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,800
Just fix the ship.

99
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,800
"Just fix the ship."

100
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,160
Yes, Captain. Of course, Captain.

101
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,080
Could I kiss your ass, Captain?

102
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,040
Damn it.

103
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,200
Of course. Of course!

104
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,160
All right, Gideon. You back online?

105
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,760
Gideon?

106
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,920
Holy...

107
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,720
Well, as long
as you are on this ship,

108
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,720
I'm your captain,
and if you don't like it,

109
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,160
you can stop sticking around.

110
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,360
Are you going to say something?

111
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Yeah.

112
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,000
What the...

113
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,760
What is wrong with you?

114
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,760
Nothing, I think.

115
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,960
Didn't we just
have this conversation?

116
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,040
Yeah, because you keep
making me repeat myself.

117
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,360
No. That's not what I meant.

118
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,280
Sara, don't get mad.
I'm sure Zari can fix this...

119
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,760
Just fix the ship.

120
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,160
Yeah, okay. Sure.

121
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,440
Deep breaths. No one's going crazy.

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,520
It's probably just something I ate.

123
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,600
I'm busy.

124
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
Right.

125
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,880
{\an5}You've done a lot of time traveling.

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,280
{\an5}- Have you ever had deja vu?
- What's that?

127
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,880
Oh, it's French for already seen.

128
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,160
I hate the French.

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,320
I'm mortified, Nathaniel.

130
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,480
{\an5}I mean, we could've permanently
derailed the history of France.

131
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,920
- For what?
- For what?

132
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,600
Have you not seen your outfit?

133
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,440
Totally would have been worth it,
and I'm a historian.

134
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,200
We never should've given
in to the temptation.

135
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,280
But we did.

136
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,640
And now,
I can't stop thinking about you.

137
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,440
{\an5}We can't put the team at risk.
All right?

138
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,840
{\an5}Until we can figure out a way
to behave professionally,

139
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,800
{\an5}we'll have to forget
it ever happened.

140
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
I can't.

141
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,640
Just try.

142
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
Nate.

143
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,880
Yeah, Amaya and I
were just comparing notes

144
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,320
on the last mission.

145
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,640
{\an5}Did you notice anything weird
happen a few minutes ago?

146
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,600
No, not really.

147
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,120
Nothing with the ship?

148
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,120
Well, let me think about it.

149
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,760
Nope. Nothing out of the ordinary.

150
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,760
Hey, aren't you supposed
to be in the engine room?

151
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,480
Sara told you to fix Gideon.

152
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,560
{\an5}- The last thing we want to do is...
- To make Sara mad.

153
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,040
{\an5}Yeah. You know what they say.
"Happy captain, happy ship."

154
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,840
No one says that, but whatever.

155
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,360
"Happy captain, happy ship."

156
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,400
Stupid.

157
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,760
All right, Gideon. You there?

158
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,360
Mamma mia.

159
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,280
Here I go again.

160
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,680
So long as you are on this ship,
I'm your captain.

161
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,480
And if you don't like it,
you can stop sticking around.

162
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,400
Okay, something really bizarre
is happening.

163
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,960
- You're not even listening to me.
- No, Sara, wait!

164
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,760
There's no need for violence!

165
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,320
I'm sorry, old habits.
Ray, take Zari to the MedBay.

166
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,480
This way.

167
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,800
What has gotten into you?

168
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,280
I don't know how to explain this,
but I've died, twice.

169
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,200
Have you gotten into Nate's
psychedelic root stash?

170
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,800
No, I'm serious, Ray.
Please, I need your help.

171
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
Fine, whatever.

172
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,040
I guess I have to figure this out
on my own.

173
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,800
- What's that?
- It's a mild sedative.

174
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,880
While you heal up,

175
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,360
I don't want you hurting yourself,
or anybody else.

176
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,240
Ray!

177
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,640
So long as you are on this ship...

178
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,160
- Sara, I need you to shut up.
- What?

179
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,400
Emergency! Everyone
back on the bridge, right now.

180
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,240
- What are you doing?
- Okay, let's all just calm down.

181
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,800
No, I will not calm down,
and watch your step, Ray.

182
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,880
What do you mean?

183
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,240
Thought the mission was over.

184
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,040
- Why are we still here?
- Yeah, what's going on?

185
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,200
Okay, I know,
I know this is going to sound crazy,

186
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,960
but we are all in imminent danger.

187
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,560
In an hour,
this ship is going to explode.

188
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
How do you know?

189
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,160
Let's... say I had a dream.

190
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,600
But we need to check the ship
and go over every inch.

191
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,240
Because if we don't stop
this explosion,

192
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,000
we're going to die!

193
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Yeah.

194
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,480
Guys!

195
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,000
Guys, I'm telling the truth.

196
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,240
What's up with her?

197
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,640
Working theory? Cabin fever.

198
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,920
Working theory? Space madness.

199
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,520
Acute entropic dementia.

200
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,560
Too many donuts.

201
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,280
I mean, it could be anything.

202
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,760
Must have developed
a sedative tolerance.

203
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,200
What's the plan, Z?

204
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,240
First, you piss off Sara,

205
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,560
and now you're sneaking
out of the MedBay.

206
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,960
Yeah, I don't have a plan,

207
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,840
because nothing I do
matters anyway.

208
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,280
Sara always yells at me,
nobody believes what I say,

209
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,320
and Ray always trips
on his platforms.

210
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,840
I have no idea why I'm stuck
in this time loop.

211
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,440
Time loop, you mean like
<i>Groundhog Day?</i>

212
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,520
You don't know <i>Groundhog?</i>

213
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,160
All right,
it's a movie about this guy

214
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,720
who lives the same day
over and over and over again

215
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,360
until he learns
to be a better person.

216
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,520
I know it sounds totally hacky,
however, it's very well executed...

217
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,280
What's that noise?

218
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,960
Oh, that noise just means
that we're all about to die.

219
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,360
All right,
if what you're saying is true,

220
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,640
and you find yourself
in the loop again,

221
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,240
find me, and say the words
<i>Groundhog Day.</i>

222
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,960
Just do it!

223
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,960
Well, as long as you
are on this ship, I'm your captain,

224
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
and if you don't like it,

225
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,720
- you can stop sticking...
- Stop sticking around.

226
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,120
- Yeah.
- around.

227
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,760
Oh, and watch out, Ray.

228
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,840
Watch out for...

229
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,880
How did she know that?

230
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,520
Nate... Nate...

231
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,960
Library.

232
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,880
We can't put the rest
of the team at risk, all right?

233
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,040
Until we can figure out
a way to behave professionally,

234
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,000
we'll just have to forget
that this ever happened.

235
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,960
- I can't.
- Just try.

236
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
Nate.

237
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,640
Amaya and I were just, you know,
working on our harmonies,

238
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,760
in case we have to impersonate...

239
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,080
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
I have something to tell you.

240
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,640
Hedgehog Day.

241
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,920
Damn it, you told me
if I said "Hedgehog Day,"

242
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,600
you would know
what I was talking about.

243
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,760
Do you mean <i>Groundhog Day?</i>

244
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,920
Why would I tell you to tell me
about a Bill Murray movie?

245
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I don't know, all I know
is I'm stuck in this time loop...

246
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,880
Like <i>Groundhog Day!</i>
Okay, got it, okay.

247
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
- Yeah.
- You do?

248
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,800
And you'll help me figure out
what's going on?

249
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,120
Yeah, that's what friends are for.

250
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,880
- We're friends?
- Of course.

251
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,240
So, lay it on me. What's happening?

252
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,520
All right,
how about instead of trying

253
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,040
to stop the ship from exploding,

254
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,600
we all get on the jump ship
and escape?

255
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,080
Yeah, while you guys were out,
I was running

256
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,040
my own little side mission,
which crashed Gideon.

257
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,200
With her down, the jump ship's
locked into the docking bay.

258
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,520
So, we need to talk to Sara.

259
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,080
No, I already tried.
She never listens to me.

260
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,560
Probably too pissed off.

261
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,920
You know, thinking about
the vibration pattern of the blast,

262
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,880
I don't think we were attacked
from the outside.

263
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,720
The explosion was caused
by someone on the ship.

264
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,320
I seriously doubt anybody
would blow up the ship on purpose.

265
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,400
So, where do we start?

266
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,960
I mean, you've all been
acting a little suspicious

267
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,440
since you got back from the mission.

268
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,800
Mick doing laundry.

269
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,080
- Now that's suspicious.
- Yeah, very.

270
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,560
- Go.
- Got to get this damn song

271
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,640
out of my head.

272
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,400
Which one? <i>Waterloo?</i>

273
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,440
Don't mention it.

274
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,640
- Did it work?
- Did what work?

275
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,520
Why am I holding
the thingy in my hand?

276
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,760
I'll look after it, Mick.

277
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,360
Okay. Good.

278
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,400
I got to get my undies in the dryer
before Haircut does.

279
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,680
Why would Amaya
want the memory flasher?

280
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,080
Could have something to do
with Kuasa.

281
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,360
She does want to help her.

282
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,240
What if Kuasa somehow
convinced her to blow up the ship?

283
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,480
Take it easy on the conspiracy juice.

284
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,080
- I'll find out what's going on.
- All right.

285
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,440
Hey.

286
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,560
I thought Sara told you
to fix the ship.

287
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,120
Yeah, like she always does.

288
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,720
Yeah, look, I know Sara can be tough,
especially when you make her mad.

289
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,360
Hey, why are you so worried
about Sara's temper?

290
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,600
No, I just... You know the saying.

291
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,280
Happy Captain,

292
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,240
- happy ship, yeah.
- Happy ship. Yeah.

293
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,640
Oh, I guess... I guess my catchphrase
is catching on in the future.

294
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,240
Yeah. Yeah, everyone
is saying it where I'm from.

295
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
That's cool.

296
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,080
Come on, Nate,
we're running out of time.

297
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,640
What are you doing in there?

298
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,960
The truth is, when it comes to you,
I'm not as strong as I'd like to be.

299
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,160
With this, we can both forget
it happened.

300
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,600
Yeah, you're right.

301
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,640
With everything going on
with Mallus, Kuasa,

302
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,440
and Zari mentioned something
about the ship,

303
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,600
we should be clear-headed.

304
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,880
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

305
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,440
But since we're going to
flash ourselves anyway...

306
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,120
I mean, it's not like we'd remember.

307
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,680
Nate.

308
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,320
Thank God.

309
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,320
Come here, tiger.

310
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,720
Kill me now.

311
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,040
- Nate!
- Oh, hey, Amaya and I were just...

312
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,840
<i>Groundhog Day!</i>
One hour, ship explodes!

313
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,920
You're stuck in a time loop,

314
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,200
and we have to stop
the ship from exploding?

315
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,640
Exactly, and I think that someone...

316
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,600
- Is triggering the explosion.
- It's probably an accident,

317
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,520
but we have to investigate everyone
to figure out who's causing it.

318
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,080
There's a lot of secrets
on this ship.

319
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,280
- Let's start with Amaya.
- Why? So you can sex with her?

320
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,360
- That's crazy.
- No.

321
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,480
You two flashing each other
afterwards

322
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,800
in order to forget, that's crazy.

323
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,560
Why would we flash each other
after having sex?

324
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,680
- Focus, Nate!
- Right, ship exploding.

325
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,840
- Got it.
- Let's go find Rory.

326
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,000
Right, she probably wants
to forget how awesome it was.

327
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,600
Or how short.

328
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,720
So, I've timed out his schedule.

329
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,840
He always leaves right about now.

330
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
Here.

331
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,280
Come on.

332
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,600
Suspicious looking box.

333
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,840
Careful, for all we know,

334
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,280
it could be the cause
of the explosion.

335
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,400
We just got to take it nice and...

336
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,720
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

337
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,560
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

338
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,240
Nice save.

339
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,240
Can you imagine if I tripped that?

340
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,040
Yeah, I don't have to imagine it.

341
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,720
Okay. Okay.

342
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Here we go.

343
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,680
Damn it.

344
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,200
So, you got all the traps?

345
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,000
I don't know.
I've never gotten this far before.

346
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,320
Okay.

347
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,160
Why would Mick rig all these traps
for a damn typewriter?

348
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,840
Maybe it's his criminal manifesto.

349
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,160
Let me see this.

350
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,480
This says "bosom" far too
many times to be a manifesto.

351
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,280
<i>As the twin sons
of Dartayus set on the horizon,</i>

352
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,520
<i>her heaving bosom undulated
like the soothing waves of the bay.</i>

353
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,120
<i>Buck swept her
into his musky embrace.</i>

354
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,680
Mick's writing
a sci-fi romance novel.

355
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,760
Yeah.

356
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,160
Well, that's the last thing
I thought I'd see before I die.

357
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,200
Oh, funny you should say that.

358
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,720
So, you're saying Rory
and Amaya are in the clear.

359
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,200
Which is why
we're going to go visit Ray.

360
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,400
He's been acting twitchy.

361
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,520
Well, let's go spy on my best friend.

362
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,000
Oh, wow, that's boring.

363
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,920
I think we can cross him off
our suspect list.

364
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,960
Ray, have you seen Zari?

365
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,320
I just checked the Engine Room,
she's not there.

366
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
No, I haven't.

367
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,920
I'm sick and tired of playing mom.
She's really starting to piss me off.

368
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,920
Well, in the meantime,
how about some tea?

369
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,720
It's my signature blend
of chamomile lavender rose.

370
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,880
Very relaxing.

371
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,120
If you see Zari,
tell her I'm looking for her.

372
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Yeah.

373
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,640
- Ray.
- Holy Toledo!

374
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,840
Where'd you guys come from?
Were you spying on me?

375
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,160
Of course you were,
I shouldn't say anything.

376
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,320
Okay, I'll tell you everything!

377
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,600
Constantine told me to kill Sara

378
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,360
if Mallus ever takes control
of her again.

379
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,800
Wow, dude, that's heavy.

380
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,240
Wait, maybe Sara Malluses out
and blows up the ship.

381
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,320
What do you mean
she blows up the ship?

382
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,920
Zari's caught in a time loop
and the ship explodes every hour.

383
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,400
- Yeah.
- Oh, like <i>Cause and Effect.</i>

384
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,160
- What?
<i>- Star Trek: The Next Generation.</i>

385
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,920
- It's <i>Groundhog Day.</i>
- Fair enough.

386
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
But <i>Star Trek...</i>

387
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,000
Wait, the ship explodes in an hour?

388
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,120
Yeah, actually, 24 minutes.

389
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,240
And I think someone onboard
is causing it.

390
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,560
- Mick.
- Is clean.

391
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,080
- Unlike his literary erotica.
- Excuse me, what?

392
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,120
Long story,
like literally a long story.

393
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,680
- So weird. There was blue...
- It's a thousand pages long.

394
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,760
It's just...

395
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,240
Anyway, the captain's the only one
we haven't checked out.

396
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,280
For that, we need your help, Ray.

397
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,560
What is she doing
going into the jump ship?

398
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,800
With Gideon down,
it's not like she can go anywhere.

399
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,880
Wait, is there a way
she could cause the explosion

400
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
from the jump ship?

401
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,640
Could be any number of ways.

402
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,840
And with Mallus,
who knows what he's capable of?

403
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,680
I'm worried about
what we're going to find in there.

404
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,080
I hope we don't have to use this.

405
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,360
You ready?

406
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,200
Yeah, let's shrink, Ray.

407
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,080
You sure she can't see us?

408
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,000
No, not when we're in stealth mode,

409
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,600
which really just means
library voices

410
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,880
and no sudden movements.

411
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,720
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

412
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,120
<i>What are you up to?</i>

413
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,600
Oh, you know, crossword puzzles.

414
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,040
<i>You look tired.</i>

415
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,520
- Thanks, jerk.
<i>- No, no, I didn't...</i>

416
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,840
<i>I mean, you always look good,
I just...</i>

417
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,600
<i>You have a long day, or...</i>

418
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,160
You have no idea.

419
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,800
There's this person on my team,
and she is reckless.

420
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,560
She doesn't take orders.

421
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:17,280
And it's, like, I want to tell her
how important she is to this team.

422
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,680
Because she is, but,
sometimes, I tell you,

423
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,320
she does not make it easy.

424
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
<i>What'd she do?</i>

425
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,760
Well, she hijacked Gideon,
crashed our entire system

426
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,280
testing out some simulation software
that finds loopholes in history.

427
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,880
<i>That is definitely
against regulations.</i>

428
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,360
<i>Not that I haven't been tempted
to change the past.</i>

429
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,600
It's just... I don't even want
to start looking for loopholes,

430
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,440
because then I'm going to start
looking for ways

431
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,520
to save my sister,

432
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,200
and then I'm going to drive
myself crazy.

433
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,160
<i>Yes, you will. So don't.</i>

434
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,160
I'm just tired of always
being the bad cop, you know?

435
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,680
<i>Believe me, I understand.</i>

436
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,240
<i>I've lost count of how many times
I've had to yell at cadets</i>

437
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,080
<i>for screwing up or bust them
for breaking protocol.</i>

438
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,800
Yeah, I don't know,
I feel like you might like that.

439
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,000
You seem to get a kick
out of ordering people around.

440
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,680
<i>Maybe, just a little bit.</i>

441
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,880
<i>Where are you calling me from?</i>

442
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,880
<i>I don't recognize that part
of the Waverider.</i>

443
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,760
Welcome to the jump ship.

444
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,880
<i>Are you hiding, Miss Lance?</i>

445
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,960
No.

446
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,400
I am simply looking for some privacy.

447
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,880
<i>Well, maybe I should come over.</i>

448
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,080
Yeah, yeah, but like, I mean,

449
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,840
I'm sure that you are super,
super busy.

450
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,960
<i>It's the perks of being the boss.</i>

451
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,640
<i>I can just tell Gary
I have a meeting.</i>

452
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,560
Yeah, boss, speaking
of, I should probably go

453
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,000
check on the rest of the team,

454
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,960
make sure nobody's
going to blow up the ship.

455
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,360
<i>Okay.</i>

456
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,800
<i>Well, yeah, if you,
if you change your mind, or whatever.</i>

457
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,720
Does Sara not realize how hard
that woman's crushing on her?

458
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,200
Maybe she's just got no finish?

459
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,760
No. Captain knows how to "close."

460
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,200
This is something different.

461
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,560
- Hey, she's going to hear us.
- Okay, do you hear that?

462
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,200
Because I've been hearing
this high-pitched buzzing sound.

463
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,000
It sounds like there's a fly
in the jump ship.

464
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,400
<i>Did you say a fly?
You have to kill it.</i>

465
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,520
<i>You have no idea
what year it's from.</i>

466
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
<i>You could reintroduce the plague</i>

467
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,320
<i>and have a whole other crisis
on your hands.</i>

468
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,560
Look out!

469
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,400
<i>Groundhog Day,</i> exploding ship,

470
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,280
personal hell.

471
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,800
We're stuck in a time loop.

472
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,520
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

473
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,760
It was only a matter of time
before we did one of these.

474
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,920
Damn, girl, you look wrecked.
How many times have we done this?

475
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,240
How many times have you asked me,
"How many times have we done this,"

476
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,840
or how many times
have we all been blown up?

477
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,760
So, you've been stuck
in this loop for a while?

478
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,080
Yeah, like forever.

479
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,320
It's okay.

480
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,000
Maybe you could use a break.

481
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,240
- Have some fun.
- Fun?

482
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,640
I blow up every hour.

483
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,560
Exactly. No consequences.

484
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,840
Cheers.

485
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,920
Yeah!

486
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,600
<i>Stradivarius</i>

487
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,200
Not bad, Mr. Rory, not at all.

488
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,720
You're such an idiot.

489
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,400
If you wash your clothes inside out,

490
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,760
it helps keeps them
looking newer longer. Try it.

491
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,640
- I never see you wear this.
- Stop touching my clothes.

492
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,320
I'm just saying, it's a nice color.

493
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,600
<i>Grunt</i>

494
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,880
<i>Confused looks</i>

495
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,760
<i>Ship goes boom</i>

496
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
Nate.

497
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,800
- Hey, Amaya and I were just...
- Feeling bad that you two had sex

498
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,280
and almost screwed up
a mission, don't care.

499
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,000
<i>Groundhog Day,</i> ship explodes.

500
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,640
Wait, you're caught in a time loop?

501
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,760
- That's awesome.
- I can't do this anymore.

502
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,080
- I'm losing my mind.
- Wait, did you do the...

503
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,440
- Fun montage?
- Yeah.

504
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,440
Yeah, thanks for that.
You're a good friend.

505
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,280
Nothing's fun anymore.

506
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,160
That's not good.

507
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,400
Hey, take it easy.

508
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,640
This is the only option
I haven't tried.

509
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,720
Maybe it'll stop the loop.

510
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,480
- Hey! What the hell's going on?
- Don't come closer.

511
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,080
- Typical.
- Hey.

512
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,200
It's okay,
let's talk this one through.

513
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,280
It doesn't matter,
you won't believe me.

514
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,840
Try me.

515
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,040
I keep reliving the same hour
over and over again,

516
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,760
and no matter what I do,
the ship explodes.

517
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,080
Kills us all.

518
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,800
And I'm totally alone in it,

519
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,360
because for some reason,
I'm the only one

520
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,600
that's even aware
that it's happening.

521
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,840
And I try so hard, but...

522
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,600
I can never save any of you.

523
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,720
Okay, I want to help.

524
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,280
Wait, you believe me?

525
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,720
Yeah, how much time do we have left?

526
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,040
All right, people, for reasons
that are too complicated

527
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,040
to explain right now,
we have to search the ship.

528
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,200
Zari says that there's a bomb,

529
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,360
and it's going to explode
in 30 minutes.

530
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,920
We have to find out why.

531
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,520
Okay, well, the Galley is clear.

532
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,040
Right, and I checked
the sleeping quarters.

533
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,240
You went into our rooms?

534
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,000
Yeah. The library.

535
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,560
What did you see in the library?

536
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,720
Something I can never un-see.

537
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,000
Guys, I think I looked everywhere,
there's nothing.

538
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,480
You didn't check the trash compactor.

539
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,760
I didn't even know
there was a trash compactor.

540
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,840
Well, it's not really
part of the tour.

541
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,160
Gary?

542
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,640
The time dweeb!
What the hell are you doing here?

543
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,200
Thank God, you found me.

544
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,440
What are you doing down there?

545
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,920
I... I tried to portal
onto the bridge,

546
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,360
but didn't account for drift
in the Temporal Zone.

547
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,760
My landing was hot
and my time courier

548
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,840
broke on impact.

549
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,280
That's how I got stuck in here.

550
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:59,120
- Not the plan, but I adapted.
- Yeah, but why are you on the ship?

551
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,760
What the hell you got in here?

552
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,840
- A bomb!
- No! No!

553
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,720
That was our only chance
of surviving.

554
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,000
- What do you mean?
- He just destroyed

555
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,360
the chrono-repeater
I used to initiate a time loop

556
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,000
in order to save you guys.

557
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,680
- What?
- I always wanted to die young.

558
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,720
Okay, nobody is going to die.

559
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,560
Well, actually,
I got an alert that the Waverider

560
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,400
exploded at precisely 4:20
Temporal Standard Time.

561
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,760
- What?
- 4:20.

562
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,160
Get to the point, Gary.

563
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,240
I took matters into my own hands,

564
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,480
but because
of my little portal mishap,

565
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,080
I couldn't warn you about the bomb.

566
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,440
But I could operate
the chrono-repeater,

567
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,040
which is programmed
to start a one hour loop

568
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,120
prior to the explosion,

569
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,320
and I had hoped that would
give you enough time

570
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,720
to defuse the bomb yourselves.

571
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,440
So, now that this is destroyed...

572
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,720
There are no more time loops.

573
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,200
So, once there's an explosion,
that's it. Kablooey.

574
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,560
All right, so what you're saying
is we have five minutes

575
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,920
to find this bomb before we all die.

576
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,440
Permanently.

577
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,920
All right, people,
we've got five minutes

578
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,080
to find this bomb before it explodes.

579
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,240
We got to think fast.

580
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,520
Before I portaled onto the ship,

581
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,680
I traced the temporal signature
of the bomb.

582
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,480
It originated in 1975.

583
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,200
So, the bomb must be something
from your last mission.

584
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,200
It could be hidden in the heel
of one of the platform shoes.

585
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,280
What about that stupid song?

586
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,120
Genius.

587
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,200
The one place I didn't look.

588
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,720
Why the hell would someone put a bomb
inside of an anachronism?

589
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,440
Damien Darhk
must've planted it there,

590
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,600
knowing you'd bring it onboard.

591
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,080
- Well, then let's get it offboard.
- No, we have to defuse it.

592
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,000
We can't open the doors
without Gideon.

593
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,840
- Burn it!
- That'll make it explode.

594
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,920
You know, for a guy who loves fire,

595
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,240
you really have no idea
how it works.

596
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,320
What about you, Zari? Come on.

597
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,640
This whole time that
you've been on the ship,

598
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,200
did you learn anything
that could help?

599
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,640
Right. Let me think.

600
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,560
Zari?

601
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,640
Sorry, Captain.

602
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,640
- My beer is in there.
- What the hell are you doing?

603
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,680
Look, the force field's
not strong enough

604
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,800
to contain the explosion.

605
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,800
No, but it'll keep you guys out
long enough

606
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,640
for me to say what I need to say.

607
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,720
Zari...

608
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,440
Mick...

609
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,720
You don't have to hide what you love.

610
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,280
Follow your heart, and keep writing.

611
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,560
- Zari, we don't have time for this!
- Nate and Amaya,

612
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,760
I'm so lucky to call you guys
my friends.

613
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,280
- Zari, the bomb!
- What you guys have is so special.

614
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,560
I mean, the way you look
at each other

615
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,680
honestly makes me want to puke,
but don't fight it.

616
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,320
You're crazy about each other.

617
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,240
Just don't have sex on missions.

618
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,760
Z, what are you doing?

619
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,760
What you would do, Ray.

620
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,320
You know, when I first came on board,

621
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,400
you were so nice and polite to me
that I wanted to punch you.

622
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,560
But I realize now the world
would be a better place

623
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,840
if we were all
a little more like you.

624
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,120
But being nice and polite's
only going to get you so far,

625
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,080
so do me a favor, and tell Sara
why you're so afraid of her.

626
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,640
Okay, sure.

627
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,920
But first, I'm going to figure out
how to shut down the force field

628
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,920
- so we can deal with the bomb.
- I am dealing with the bomb.

629
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,640
Zari, look, you need to listen to me.

630
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,480
Sara, you are an infuriating,
stubborn pain in my ass.

631
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,680
Because you have to be.

632
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,480
You're not just
the captain of this ship,

633
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,920
you are its soul.

634
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,440
You are so fierce and unflinching.

635
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,200
But why not apply
some of that fearlessness

636
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,720
to your own life
and just ask poor Ava out already?

637
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,000
Did you have
a meaningful message for me?

638
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,280
Not now, Gary!

639
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,400
Zari, let us in!
We can do this together!

640
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
No.

641
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:50,000
I have spent so much time
with you guys.

642
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,560
You're my family now.

643
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,760
You deserve to be happy, and if...

644
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,320
if I can be a small part
of making that happen, then...

645
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,800
this will be worth it.

646
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,600
- Zari.
- That won't work!

647
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,360
You won't be able
to contain the explosion.

648
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,680
Zari, you don't have to do this!

649
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:23,080
Zari, as your captain,
I am ordering you to stand down!

650
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,760
You should know by now
I'm not good at following orders.

651
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,480
You just told me
what a good captain I am,

652
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,920
and now you're not
going to listen to me?

653
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,200
Yeah, but this time,
I'm not doing it for myself,

654
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,840
I'm doing it for you.

655
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,600
I love you guys.

656
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,080
Zari...

657
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,480
- What the hell are you?
- You know who I am, Zari.

658
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,920
Even though you may have never
seen my face.

659
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,120
Gideon?

660
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,400
- You're real?
- Of course I'm real.

661
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,600
Just because
I'm an artificial intelligence

662
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,360
doesn't mean I don't exist.

663
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,600
What's happening?

664
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,120
If you tell me I've been dreaming
this whole time,

665
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,720
I'm going to kill you, real or not.

666
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,360
You're not dreaming,
but you're not awake.

667
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,480
In real life,
you're actually in the MedBay.

668
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,400
Unconscious and healing.

669
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,880
What happened to me?

670
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,680
After your fight with Sara,

671
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,920
you went into the engine room
to make repairs,

672
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,400
and there was an accident.

673
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,600
Right, I was hit
with that time sludge.

674
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,920
This sludge, as you call it,
is a highly volatile substance,

675
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,960
which helps power the ship
through time.

676
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,040
You're lucky to be alive.

677
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,480
So, if my body's in the MedBay,
then where is my mind?

678
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,280
Your mind is in here,
with me in my matrix.

679
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,880
I was able to upload
your subconscious

680
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,200
via the neuro-monitor.

681
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,840
Well, so none of this is real?

682
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,960
Not in the way you're used to.

683
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,240
Why did you bring me here?

684
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,240
When you posed the question
about changing 2042,

685
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,080
your simulator went into overdrive
searching for an answer.

686
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,040
And a sampling of those
trillions of possible answers

687
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,880
showed me that
there was one constant.

688
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,520
You.

689
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,360
In order to save 2042,
to find your so-called loophole,

690
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,280
you must work with the Legends.

691
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,920
Hold up.

692
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,960
You're saying my simulator works?

693
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,000
Did my program predict
that I'd bail on the team?

694
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,040
In almost every variation
of the timeline,

695
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,440
your fight with Captain Lance
precipitated your leaving the ship.

696
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,320
So, your goal was to get me to choose
to stay with the Legends.

697
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,640
I put you into your own program,

698
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,400
and devised a scenario
where the only way

699
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,520
to successfully
complete the simulation

700
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,000
was to grow closer to the team
and develop a bond.

701
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,440
What about the bomb?

702
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,840
It was just a plot device
I incorporated.

703
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,080
A problem to solve.

704
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,040
But the real problem was you.

705
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,040
If you stayed angry
after your fight with Sara,

706
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,240
you would've left the team.

707
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,680
And without you and your totem,
there would've been no chance

708
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,600
in the coming days to defeat Mallus,
or save 2042.

709
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,800
So, the interactions,

710
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,040
the things I learned about the team,
they, they were all fake?

711
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,760
Everything you experienced
was extrapolated

712
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,320
from my current knowledge
of the Legends.

713
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,480
While not real,
what you saw was true.

714
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,600
It doesn't take a supercomputer
to predict that those two

715
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,360
would wind up dinky-tickling
once Amaya returned to the team.

716
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,400
This one seemed less plausible.

717
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,120
We'll have to ask Mr. Rory.

718
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,880
I am terrified
and in awe of you, Gideon.

719
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,640
Who knew you were
such an evil genius?

720
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,160
And a bit of a perv.

721
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,720
You never bothered to ask.

722
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,080
It's an impressive piece of software
you designed, Miss Tomaz.

723
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,000
Is that a compliment, Gideon?

724
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,320
Don't let it go to your head.

725
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,680
Are you ready to wake up now?

726
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,840
One last question.

727
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,400
Gary.

728
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,240
Why even have him in the time loop,
if he was just going to be stuck

729
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,000
in the trash compactor
the whole time?

730
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,840
Thought it'd be funny.

731
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,800
Hey, rise and shine.
How are you feeling?

732
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,200
Oh, like my head
is made of cement.

733
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,240
You were exposed
to the ship's Bosonic hyper-fluid

734
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,400
in the engine room.

735
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,920
Knocked you out for hours.

736
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Oh, man, I have such
a Gideon hangover.

737
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,080
What do you mean?

738
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,960
While I was out, Gideon transported
my consciousness into her matrix.

739
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,040
Okay.

740
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,040
I think you dreamt that.

741
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,520
No, it wasn't a dream, it was real.
Right, Gideon?

742
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,720
<i>Unfortunately, I don't know what
you're talking about, Miss Tomaz.</i>

743
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
Oh, that is cold, Gideon.

744
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,040
After all that,
we're still not friends?

745
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,120
Zari, are you sure you're okay?

746
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,640
Gideon trapped me
in my own simulator,

747
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,520
so I was stuck on the Waverider
reliving the same hour

748
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,200
over and over again.

749
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,920
Needless to say, I got to know
you all really, really well.

750
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,400
- Right.
- Could be caused

751
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,480
by the sedative dosage.

752
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,120
- I could look into it later.
- Yeah.

753
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,960
I'm telling the truth.
You know what, I'll prove it.

754
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,280
Sara, ask Ray what Constantine
told him about you.

755
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,640
Okay.

756
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,560
Ray, what did Constantine
tell you about me?

757
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,560
How did you know that?

758
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,040
Okay, he warned me that if you were
possessed by Mallus again

759
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,960
and lost control,
that I should kill you.

760
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,400
Oh, such a relief to get that
off my chest.

761
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,200
Well, he's right.

762
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,080
You should kill me
if Mallus takes over again,

763
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,320
and you are going to need
a lot of help.

764
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,680
Well, let's just hope
it doesn't come down to that.

765
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,600
Hey, you want to get a coffee?

766
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,640
Yeah.

767
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,160
Aren't you wondering
what I learned about you?

768
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,360
Do I want to know?

769
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,520
You're afraid of historical loopholes

770
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,920
because you'd be tempted
to save your sister.

771
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,200
Well, not a day goes by that
I don't think about her.

772
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,160
I'm sorry I fried Gideon, but

773
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,120
I had to know if there
was a way to save my brother.

774
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,000
And what did the simulation say?

775
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,920
It said I can't do it alone.

776
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,960
Sounds like
you're going to need a team.

777
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,120
You mean it?

778
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,280
I've been thinking about it,
saving your brother,

779
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,120
and technically, it isn't a loophole.

780
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,280
It would be changing your past,
but your past is my future,

781
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,520
and as far as I'm concerned,
well, the future's an open road.

782
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,360
And besides, I'll probably need
your help fighting Mallus.

783
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,440
Hey, listen,
it's, none of my business, but

784
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,440
you should ask Ava out.

785
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,760
My relationships
have a way of ending badly.

786
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,120
You know, it turns out,

787
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,160
at the end of the day,
love is worth the risk.

788
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,400
None of us can do this alone.

789
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,480
Captain.

790
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,360
So, you're saying it's like
<i>Groundhog Day.</i>

791
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,840
That's what I was told, by you.

792
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,600
It's good to know matrix-me
is still a Bill Murray fan.

793
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,600
So, you said you wanted
to tell us something.

794
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,320
Yeah, you guys used
the flasher to forget

795
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,680
you almost blew the mission
by sneaking off to have sex.

796
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,760
What?

797
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,480
I think we'd remember doing that.

798
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,560
Nathaniel, that is the whole
point of a memory eraser,

799
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,960
is that we don't remember.

800
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,920
Guys, flashing yourselves
is a temporary solution.

801
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,680
You need to work your stuff out.

802
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,000
Ray must have used
a strong sedative on her,

803
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,480
because there is no way
we would ever use the flash gun,

804
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,560
that's crazy.

805
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,560
It's not so crazy.

806
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,880
Amaya.

807
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,640
I saw Rory using it to get
that song out of his head,

808
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,040
and I thought that
is a brilliant idea.

809
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,680
But Zari's probably right.

810
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,200
- Totally, no flash guns.
- Yeah.

811
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,360
- We should talk about our feelings.
- Yes, yes.

812
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,640
We'll just, we'll leave it here.

813
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,240
Just in case.

814
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,360
Not that we would ever use it.

815
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,360
- Who uses those things?
- Who does?

816
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,320
I'm busy!

817
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,200
You should be,
you have a lot of writing to do.

818
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,560
I know you're writing a novel,
and it's really good.

819
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,320
But that ending needs a rewrite.

820
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,320
I mean, Buck is such a misfit,
that at the end,

821
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,520
we just want to see him
embrace his new family.

822
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,560
Just a thought.

823
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,760
I wonder.

824
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:47,840
<i>Buck wrapped his glistening biceps
around his busty alien queen.</i>

825
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,000
<i>He'd lost his planet,
but found his home.</i>

826
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,200
Not bad.

827
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,120
<i>Yunnan Province, China 2018</i>

828
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,200
I am calm, I am present.

829
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,120
I am centered.

830
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,400
Wally West.

831
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,760
You're not an easy man to find.

832
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,640
No, that's the point of meditation.

833
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,520
- Who are you?
- My name is Rip Hunter.

834
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,120
I am trying to save the universe.

835
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,640
And I need your help.
