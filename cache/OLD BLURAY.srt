1
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,324
Sing it, girl.

2
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,660
Mom. Now I can't.

3
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,496
Her spontaneity
has been stripped from her.

4
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,549
I'm sorry.
You have such a beautiful voice.

5
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,842
I can't wait to hear it
when you're older.

6
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,045
Will this place have scuba diving?

7
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,973
How old does a child have to be
to do scuba diving?

8
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,265
I don't know, Trent.

9
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,261
- I think you're a bit too young.
- You're a baby.

10
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:49,143
You said five minutes. Technically,
it's been way, way more than five minutes.

11
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,644
Are we close?

12
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,601
Stop wishing away this moment.

13
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,904
Look out the window,
look how pretty it is.

14
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,951
Prisca.

15
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:01,694
Work stuff?

16
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,788
Yeah.

17
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,871
Lead by actions, mom.

18
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:17,758
Wow.

19
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,132
This is much better than Cancun.

20
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:32,850
Mr. and Mrs. capa,
welcome to our version of paradise.

21
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,104
Wow.

22
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,231
Hello!

23
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,408
So, this is Madrid.
She'll take care of you.

24
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,238
From your food and beverage preferences
you selected,

25
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,789
we've made you cocktails to welcome you.

26
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:48,876
Wow.

27
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,875
- Thank you.
- Look how big you guys are.

28
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,001
We have a drink fountain for you two.

29
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,466
- Can we go?
- Mmm.

30
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,793
- Yeah.
- Let's go, let's go.

31
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,130
Can you believe I found this online?

32
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,433
It's gorgeous.

33
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:20,697
My favorite thing,
open 24 hours,

34
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,024
the candy station.

35
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,780
Oh, my god. Come on, Trent.

36
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,992
Mix the vanilla and strawberry in it.

37
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,170
Say hi, Trent.

38
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:36,959
Hi.

39
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,668
I'm idlib.
My uncle's the resort manager here.

40
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,345
He's Trent, I'm Maddox.

41
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:47,016
I can do a thousand-piece Jigsaw puzzle,
which is a considerable thing to do.

42
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:50,014
My dad and I put clear glue on them
and then hang them on my wall.

43
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,808
I collect conch shells.

44
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,639
I have 42 conch shells.

45
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,941
Amazing.

46
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,021
- I might need a little help with this.
- Okay.

47
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,716
Right, so you do strawberry and vanilla?

48
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,794
Hi.

49
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,667
Thank you. Yes.

50
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:21,216
Okay.
Okay, I got it. Okay, come on.

51
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,589
Thank you. Heh.

52
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,013
Great job helping. Yes.

53
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,888
- You!
- I touched your jacket, that...

54
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,189
Hey!

55
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:41,020
There's 250,000 furniture-related injuries
in the United States per year.

56
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,777
25% of those, coffee table injuries.

57
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,404
Hey. Hey!

58
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,784
- Fine.
- Okay.

59
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,748
Warren and Warren
must be affiliated with this resort.

60
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,583
They must have conventions here.

61
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,631
We love this pharmaceutical company
at work.

62
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,158
We're considering asking our clients
to use Warren and Warren drugs

63
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,220
as a way to lower their insurance rates.

64
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,394
Ah. Hmm. Yeah.

65
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,185
"No kids allowed on the beach"?

66
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,861
What? Hold on.

67
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,907
- "No kids week"?
- That's not true! Let me see that!

68
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,833
It says no ki...
Prisca, you should've checked.

69
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,556
- Let me see that!
- It's your mom's fault.

70
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,974
No, really, no. It says this, no...

71
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,018
- Let me see!
- She should've checked. It says this.

72
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,228
- Let me see!
- Yes, of course.

73
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:39,291
I know this is
very painful news for you all to bear.

74
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,622
But now, now I've got the power.

75
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,736
Yes! And you have to do it.

76
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,251
Yeah, you have to understand.
It's like this.

77
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,466
- Daddy!
- Life is like this.

78
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,005
It's tough and sometimes
it doesn't go the way you want it to.

79
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,233
Come on! Blue team is winning.

80
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,276
What's your name
and what do you do for a living?

81
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,737
Hey, guys. I'm Annette. What's your name?

82
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,197
I'm Trent. This is idlib.

83
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,828
Hey, nice to meet you.

84
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,700
I = ee - aes a

85
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,795
bye.

86
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,294
Hi, I'm Trent. This is idlib.

87
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,501
What are your names,
and what do you do for a living?

88
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,336
Well, I'm Sophia Watson.

89
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,591
I'm a chef.

90
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,218
I'm Greg Mitchell. I'm a cop.

91
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,389
Cool.

92
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,762
And I'm malin Mitchell. I'm a dancer.

93
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,469
Wow. That's cool.

94
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,974
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

95
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,771
- Hey, let's go over there.
- Bye.

96
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,440
Come on, let's go over there.

97
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,285
Truth-telling game. Go.

98
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,125
I can't do a push-up. Go.

99
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,585
I don't have friends.

100
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,083
I'm your friend.

101
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,588
You'll leave.

102
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,385
My mom might let me facetime you.

103
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,259
Then we can be friends.

104
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,342
You can come over to my house
and make up stories.

105
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,052
Then we can go to
the same college together

106
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,308
and become neighbors with mortgages.

107
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:23,651
Cool.

108
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,979
It's weird.

109
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,735
I know.

110
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,911
It's hanging over me. I can barely eat.

111
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,703
And I don't feel anything?

112
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,783
We agreed.

113
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,415
We'd give them one last vacation
before telling them.

114
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,752
I can't understand
why we don't take into consideration...

115
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,878
That shouldn't affect anything.

116
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,336
The doctor said it's a non-factor.

117
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,431
It's probably been there for years,
he said.

118
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,345
We were on a course to separate.

119
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,351
That's confusing enough for us.

120
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,602
Let's not bring an irrelevant
medical condition into this.

121
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,946
Let's get through this, guy.

122
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,403
Compartmentalize.

123
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,534
It's only for three days.

124
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,906
You found a place?

125
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:18,998
Yes.

126
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,414
Oh, prisca. Come on.

127
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,956
You're always thinking about the future!

128
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,211
It makes me feel not seen!

129
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,843
You're always thinking
about the past.

130
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,966
You work in a goddamn museum!

131
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,973
I think they stopped.

132
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,397
Why don't you play?

133
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,227
Good morning.
What would you like for breakfast?

134
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,602
I'll have the calcium bomb juice drink.
I have a calcium deficiency.

135
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,605
So, is it really calcium rich
or just a catchy name?

136
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,816
It has all calcium-rich vegetables, ma'am.

137
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,198
- Sit up, Kara, honey.
- Okay.

138
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,371
You don't wanna be hunched
when you grow up, baby.

139
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,789
It's very unattractive.

140
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,242
Boys will get turned off.

141
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,249
Give me the calcium bomb juice.

142
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,259
And maybe you could
recommend one of these.

143
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:41,974
This one.

144
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,137
I recommend the granola parfait.

145
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,220
It's a good choice.

146
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,474
Okay.

147
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,431
So, how is the capa family?

148
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:52,732
Any plans today?

149
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,569
Well, one of our kids
wants to do jet ski.

150
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,444
And the other one
wants to do anything but that.

151
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:01,650
Aha.

152
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,369
Well, there's, um...

153
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,572
There's a private beach
on the nature preserve side of the island.

154
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,203
It's impossible to find.

155
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:12,536
It's surrounded by stunning rocks,
very unusual minerals.

156
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,417
It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

157
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,339
A natural anomaly.

158
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,299
I only recommend it to certain guests.

159
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,222
But I liked you guys immediately.
All right?

160
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:28,143
You're a nice family.
So I could arrange a Van to take you, if...

161
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,730
Yeah.

162
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,647
Sounds like a great memory for us.

163
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:35,851
It's our little secret.
I'll make all the arrangements.

164
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,007
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

165
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,358
Thanks.

166
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,527
Okay, so I think we should get
the Calloway Kale-away for Trent.

167
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,989
Idlib, what did I tell you about
being in here when you shouldn't?

168
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,701
You can't...
You know, I told you so many times.

169
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,251
You know, we have certain rules...

170
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,134
I'm a doctor.

171
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,636
My wife has epilepsy.

172
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,809
I'm a nurse. My name is jarin.

173
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,519
Right, she's having a grand mal seizure.

174
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,518
Keep things away from her, please.

175
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,196
Patricia?

176
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,365
Doll.

177
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,636
Jack, I think if you just
leave her lying here for a while,

178
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,512
put something under her head.
I think she'll be fine.

179
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,027
Thank you, doctor.
It's jarin, by the way.

180
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,709
For my next act,
I'll spin my head around 360.

181
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,588
I'm sorry I ruined everyone's breakfast.

182
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,541
You always want to be
the center of attention.

183
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,675
My goodness.
Let's get you something to drink?

184
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,766
Yeah.

185
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:57,981
Idlib.

186
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,787
Can't be that secret a beach.
We were told to keep it quiet.

187
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,744
- So were we.
- Sit down, Gustav. Good boy.

188
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,505
Good boy. Stay.

189
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,047
Okay, guest checklist.

190
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,970
Books, sunscreen.

191
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,307
Did everybody
leave their passports in their safes?

192
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,601
- I don't want anybody to lose anything.
- Yeah.

193
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,350
What are your names and occupations?

194
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,004
It's very rocky here.

195
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,588
Okay, my friends.

196
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,015
You can just call us,

197
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,559
and we'll pick you up
whenever you're ready to come back.

198
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,477
Or I'll pick you up at 5:00 P.M.

199
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,556
Just follow the path down to the beach.

200
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,857
Is that also food? Yeah.

201
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,144
Wow, that's a lot of food.

202
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,153
Well, kids eat a lot of food.
And you got three of them with you.

203
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,653
Okay.

204
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:33,236
Seems like a waste,
but thank you.

205
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,246
Could you help us
carry some of these bags, please?

206
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,498
We've got an elderly person here
and a child.

207
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,422
I'm sorry. I gotta get back.
But it's not far.

208
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:47,000
Just walk down.
You'll see a beautiful slot canyon.

209
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:50,258
Walk through that, and in a few minutes,
you'll be there. Enjoy, everybody!

210
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,213
- Do you think there's...
- Come on.

211
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,175
- Do you think there's snakes?
- Of course.

212
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,100
Cool. I wanna see one.

213
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,312
Gorgeous. Wow.

214
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,234
Okay.

215
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,862
You okay? Yeah?

216
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,179
Could someone please
tell me what just happened?

217
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,927
Look out.

218
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,225
- This is so exciting!
- Careful now.

219
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,651
- Let's go!
- I'm gonna win!

220
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,106
Whoo!

221
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,260
Wow. I just got chills.

222
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,645
Come on, darling.
Let's show Gustav the sea.

223
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,936
Hey, Maddox, help your mom.

224
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,818
Listen, I... let's move somewhere else.

225
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,025
I think it's much nicer
closer to the water, right?

226
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,610
- Yeah, but I...
- No, it's... look. It's beautiful.

227
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,740
I got you!

228
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,134
Have you ever
seen anything like that?

229
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,558
They were right to send us.

230
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,185
Lie down.

231
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,102
Yeah. Good boy!

232
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,560
Kids, look at the beautiful coral.

233
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,403
- What are you going to do?
- Now I'm gonna splash you.

234
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,405
Just keep on reading, I guess.

235
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:19,861
You just splashed me.

236
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,163
Stop! I didn't mean you could splash me.

237
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,416
Guy?

238
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,503
Yeah.

239
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,999
What book am I reading?

240
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,301
I don't know.

241
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,098
Why?

242
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,802
No reason.

243
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:48,686
Prisca,
I wanted to tell you something.

244
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,354
No, never mind.

245
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,190
I'll tell you later.

246
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,163
Oh, my god.

247
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:06,957
That's mid-sized sedan.

248
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,500
What? Mid what?

249
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,919
He's a rapper!

250
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,712
"More dough for the cookin"?

251
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,070
- Mid-sized sedan?
- Let's begin an activity.

252
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,709
Dad, I have to, okay? I have to!

253
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,386
- No. Leave him. Because it's a private...
- Sounds like fun.

254
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:22,636
- But, dad, stop! I need to say hi.
- He's on vacation, he's on vacation.

255
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,342
What's his surname? Sedan?

256
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,302
Whoo!

257
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,475
Ohl

258
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,353
whoa, all right.
Here's a big one. Wow.

259
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,188
Help me with this.

260
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,400
We should have a housewarming party.

261
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,870
Isn't our house so beautiful?

262
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,427
- Boo!
- Aah! You!

263
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,924
- Come! Come back here!
- No!

264
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,809
Not gonna get me!

265
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,010
Kara, you know,
I'm gonna get you right now.

266
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:08,772
Come on.

267
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:09,891
Not gonna get me!

268
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:10,982
Oh, I am.

269
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,099
Come on, Kara.

270
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,105
Ohl

271
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,733
oh, my god. Got you.

272
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,071
You're never gonna catch me.

273
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,454
Honey, I'm home.

274
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,248
I told you, I don't wanna live like this.

275
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,292
I'm gonna live in a condominium.

276
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,496
I'm going for a drive to calm down.

277
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,040
I'm really, really hungry.

278
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,047
Me, too. My stomach's growling.

279
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,138
Me, too.

280
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,645
Wow.

281
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,564
Who would leave this?

282
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:03,785
Hey, mom!

283
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,406
From the hotel.

284
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:08,992
They're so rusted.

285
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,289
Put that down!

286
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,992
You can get infected
or you'll cut yourself!

287
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,206
Come away.

288
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,297
Next activity.

289
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,193
- What's happening?
- Let's play hide-and-seek.

290
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,674
I don't know. They found stuff
from the hotel in the sand.

291
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,926
Eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

292
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,348
- No fish.
- Ready or not, here we come!

293
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:46,536
Mom!

294
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:51,826
Mom! Mom!

295
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:53,623
Mom!

296
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,753
- What is it? What is it?
- Trent!

297
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,001
Someone over there.

298
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,092
Over there.

299
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,844
Come on. Give me a hand. Get the legs.

300
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,939
Yes.

301
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:26,441
- Make your list. Make your list.
- Okay.

302
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,820
Red and orange.

303
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,948
Red, orange. Come away from here, babies.

304
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,701
Let the doctor try and help this lady.
Yeah?

305
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,248
- Green.
- Green.

306
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:38,922
- Purple.
- Purple.

307
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,486
- What happened?
- It's okay.

308
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,294
Blue. Blue is good. And then?

309
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,905
- Green.
- Green, yes.

310
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,240
- Yellow. Purple.
- Yellow. I love yellow.

311
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,549
Call the police, right?

312
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,761
I'll get my mobile.

313
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,599
Oh, damn.

314
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,988
What happened to her, mom?

315
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,369
I don't know.

316
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,451
I'm still hungry.

317
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:19,752
Me, too.

318
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,088
Was she with you?

319
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,735
I was waiting for her.

320
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,798
She swam out by herself, yo.

321
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,637
I don't know what the hell happened.

322
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,757
I ain't saying nothing else.

323
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,226
Did you strike him?
I don't need to know the context of...

324
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,053
What? No. Of course not.

325
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,513
So why's your nose bleeding?

326
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,518
I told y'all,
I ain't got nothing to say to you.

327
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,323
My chest feels funny.

328
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:55,580
Well, you know, we should've
gotten a yacht like I suggested, Agnes.

329
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,531
You shouldn't have fought me on that.

330
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:01,460
You see? Now we're mixed up
in some island issue.

331
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:02,912
I mean, I...

332
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,088
Mom, my swimsuit is hurting.
I have to take it off.

333
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,423
Well, just loosen your...

334
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,810
We're from Philadelphia.

335
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,142
I'm on a break here
with my wife and kids. That's them.

336
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,939
Well, yeah, over there.

337
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:32,191
And for the record,
I know most people who die on vacation

338
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:36,199
die from sun exposure, overexertion,

339
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,951
or a mixture of all of the above
99.4% of the time.

340
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:44,082
- How you know all this?
- I'm an actuary.

341
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:47,381
I calculate people's insurance rates
based on their risk profile.

342
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,335
I ain't do nothing, man.

343
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,798
She was into me.

344
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,515
Somebody will figure this out.

345
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,726
We'll just have to wait
for them to get here.

346
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,308
No reception at all.

347
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,403
I guess our beach day's over.

348
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,697
We've gotta keep an eye on him
and the body.

349
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,241
Whoo!

350
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,281
Oh, my goodness.

351
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,582
Wow.

352
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:24,543
Did you just get dropped off
by the resort?

353
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:28,168
Yeah. We were supposed to come earlier,
but we rested in the room first.

354
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:31,000
Great. We have to get the resort people
before they leave.

355
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,855
I think we will all
have to leave this beach.

356
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,637
Wait. Why? They left already.

357
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:36,884
What happened?

358
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,936
We really don't know what happened.

359
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,113
Well, I think this man
had something to do with it.

360
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,317
Man, if I was involved, why would I
be standing around, bro? Damn.

361
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,700
His nose is bleeding. I think he got that
when she was trying to defend herself.

362
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,246
I don't like this dynamic at all.

363
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,293
My nose has been bleeding for hours, man.
I don't know why it's doing that.

364
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:08,337
Charles, something's wrong with
your mother. She's asking for you, honey.

365
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,920
Well, we're all in this now.

366
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,509
We are responsible for that woman.

367
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:18,723
And I've got nothing against this man.
I'm just doing what needs to be done.

368
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,800
No cell phone reception
on this beach.

369
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:22,895
You stay here.

370
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,980
I'll go to the clearing in the jungle
where they dropped us and try to call.

371
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:29,650
They obviously have a signal out here.
How else do people call to go back?

372
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,123
Oh, my god.

373
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,335
You stumbled back out,
you were holding your head.

374
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,257
You looked like you were in pain, babe.

375
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,669
You blacked out.

376
00:25:58,182 --> 00:25:59,843
I felt this pressure in my head.

377
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,144
I'm fine, Charles.

378
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,639
I think it's the shock.

379
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,900
Try to help Gustav or he'll be sick.

380
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,272
Yeah, of course it's the shock.

381
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,479
I'm gonna get a Van
to take us back to the resort,

382
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,656
but first I've got to deal
with all this, all right?

383
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:19,658
Are you okay?

384
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:20,745
Yeah.

385
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,074
I know you've been stressed.

386
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,322
Don't let this upset you.

387
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,542
Help these people through this, Charles.

388
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,620
So, what did you hear?

389
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,924
Help these people through this, Charles.

390
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,171
Excuse me.

391
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,639
Excuse me.
I saw you were talking to my husband.

392
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,638
I know you're dealing with a lot
with that woman right now,

393
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,345
but something is wrong with my son.
Some kind of reaction.

394
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,601
Is it severe? I don't have time for this.

395
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,228
What kind of doctor are you?

396
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:55,189
I'm a cardiothoracic surgeon
and chief medical officer.

397
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,609
You don't know me.

398
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,906
I curate exhibits for museums.

399
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,693
I'm telling you this
because I want you to trust me

400
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,904
and not think I'm being hysterical
when I say

401
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,330
there's something very wrong
with my child.

402
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,578
He seems fine to me.
He's playing with my daughter.

403
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,999
You look different, too.

404
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,090
How?

405
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:18,300
Huh? I don't know.
You just look different.

406
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:20,927
Hold my hand.

407
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,633
Okay.

408
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,469
Willow, Japanese maple.

409
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,056
- Evergreen.
- If you get scared, just tell me, okay?

410
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,233
What do you keep looking at?

411
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,774
There. “Where?

412
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,949
Way, way up there
on the side of the hillside.

413
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,366
What do you see?

414
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,318
I thought I saw something shiny.

415
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:47,582
Here comes mom.

416
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,754
Charles! She stopped breathing!

417
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,546
She stopped breathing!

418
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,130
I didn't do anything, Charles.

419
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,132
You guys, you just walked away,

420
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,589
and she just stopped breathing
all of a sudden.

421
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,174
I mean, she was peaceful.

422
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:09,430
Can you step back, please?

423
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,386
We'll take the kids
away from here.

424
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:13,438
Is this happening?

425
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,577
She couldn't take the shock.

426
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,949
She saw a murdered woman
and her heart couldn't take it.

427
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,127
What are your names
and occupations?

428
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,788
I'm jarin. I'm a nurse.

429
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,716
I'm Patricia. I'm a psychologist.

430
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,885
He remembers everyone's names
and things about them.

431
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,296
Everything's gonna be okay.

432
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,382
What's your name?

433
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,969
I'm Trent.
This is my sister, Maddox.

434
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,554
How old are you guys?

435
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:56,106
I'll guess. I'm good at this.

436
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,274
You're 11, right, Trent?

437
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:04,406
No. Really, are you 10, 117?

438
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,235
He's not lying. He's six.

439
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:10,162
I'm specifically six and a quarter.

440
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:11,871
She's 11.

441
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:16,251
They're feeling unsafe.
There is a lot going on here.

442
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:19,455
They're playing with us. Let's leave it.

443
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,040
Okay, what's your best friend's name?

444
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,134
Maddox.

445
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,170
How sweet.

446
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,346
Have you seen my children?

447
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,638
Is everyone trying to play a joke on us?

448
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,765
- What?
- Aren't these your children?

449
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,600
I'm right here, mom.

450
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,354
Mom?

451
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,239
Mom.

452
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,951
Why are you looking at me like that?

453
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,882
Prisca, I think we should leave.

454
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,589
Get the kids back to the resort.

455
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:11,890
Guy...

456
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,735
- Maddox?
- Yeah. Dad, it's me.

457
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,199
What's going on?

458
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,925
You see? You see?

459
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,318
Holy...

460
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,482
Damn.

461
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,315
- How did we get here?
- Take it easy.

462
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,525
Intense cranial pressure.
It's like being deep underwater.

463
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,614
- I can't...
- Can you get up?

464
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:56,785
Whoa. Whoa. Take it easy.

465
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,161
Charles?

466
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,414
- Yeah, no, I'm all right. I'm fine.
- You okay?

467
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,917
We're leaving right now,
and we're taking our kids.

468
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,919
For some reason,
people are blacking out going this way.

469
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,591
Three people have blacked out now.

470
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,865
- That's ridiculous. Come, move.
- No, I saw it, prisca.

471
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:13,924
I saw jarin black out.

472
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:18,475
What I know is that we have to get
these kids to a hospital. Now.

473
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,137
Look, let's stop talking about it.

474
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,563
The kids are scared.

475
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,060
I can stay here with them.

476
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:30,192
But everyone else should try and find
a different pathway off this beach.

477
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,986
Break off into groups of two
in case people black out.

478
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,869
Chrystal, go with me.

479
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:57,529
- Okay.
- Whatever you do, just stay close.

480
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:59,808
I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now.

481
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,889
Don't get up too quickly.

482
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,517
Kids, let mom and dad talk for a second.

483
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,519
No. Mom, we're scared.

484
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,601
Please. Stay right here.

485
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:11,607
Okay?

486
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:15,278
- If I cry, please don't let them see.
- I won't.

487
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,530
Your hands are shaking. Yeah.

488
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:18,736
- Yeah.
- Yeah, they are.

489
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,445
Yeah. You okay?

490
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,207
We're on a beach
with two unrelated dead bodies.

491
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:26,250
That is just statistically impossible.

492
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,249
All three kids are reacting to something.

493
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,750
Only the kids.

494
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,877
I mean, look at the doctor's daughter.

495
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:36,170
The kids are reacting
to something they ate.

496
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,888
Or they caught something.

497
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:43,093
We're on a remote, undeveloped island,
but we have a doctor here.

498
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:46,521
So, let's get the doctor
to look at the kids.

499
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,906
I still can't get any reception.

500
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:59,655
Doctor, before we do anything else,

501
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,611
can you take a look
at our children, please?

502
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:03,996
Ohl

503
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:06,200
he's got a knife!

504
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,668
There's a damn hole in my cheek!

505
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:13,340
- Oh, my god! Are you okay?
- Put that down right now, doctor.

506
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,791
Watch out, jarin.

507
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:19,068
Listen, I don't know why I did that.
I thought he was gonna hurt me.

508
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,300
Sorry.

509
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,221
- Sorry.
- What's he talking about, "sorry"?

510
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,644
- Let me see that laceration.
- That's assault, man!

511
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,062
Calm down.

512
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:30,933
What's your name?

513
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,480
Mid-sized sedan.

514
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,066
I must be in shock. I'm numb.
I'm not feeling the pain no more.

515
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,367
Please. Let me see.

516
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,228
No, this is not making any sense, prisca.

517
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:53,960
I need to get my ass to a hospital now.

518
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:56,875
What's with all y'all faces?

519
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,883
It's hard to explain.

520
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:07,386
This is messed up, man.
Where'd it go?

521
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,596
This is some kind of parlor trick.

522
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:14,060
Yo, I know
I tried to dip, but I am freaked, man.

523
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,274
I just wanna go back to my hotel room.

524
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,732
This was supposed to be a zen trip, man.

525
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:24,160
She and I only started talking
because she was sick, and so am I.

526
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:27,455
She had just been diagnosed with ms,
so we started rapping about that.

527
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,624
I didn't do nothing to that girl, man.

528
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,544
She was like Michael Phelps
swimming out there,

529
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:34,792
backstroking and whatnot.

530
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,293
She swam way the hell out.

531
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,624
What did you say?

532
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,801
No, I don't know, man.
Maybe it was butterfly stroke.

533
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,608
I don't watch the summer Olympics
like that.

534
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,592
You came vacationing here
because you were sick,

535
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,953
- and so did she?
- I thought that was a cool coincidence.

536
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:49,640
Maybe this is some kind of
group psychosis. I've studied this.

537
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:52,473
We're all emotionally shaky
from our lives.

538
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,809
We don't believe
we can leave this beach.

539
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:01,485
Mom.

540
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,238
Is there any more food?
I'm still hungry.

541
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:07,475
- Well, she's definitely aged.
- How can you still be hungry? We just...

542
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:10,241
I'd put her biological age
somewhere between 12 and 13,

543
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:13,293
and she turned six
two weeks ago on Tuesday.

544
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,460
What?

545
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,084
We're older?

546
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:19,795
Am I okay?

547
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:23,887
I don't know what's happening
to the three of you, sweetheart.

548
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,259
But for now,
I have another swimsuit in my bag,

549
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,808
and maybe you should change into that.

550
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,432
It might be a virus, maybe.

551
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,138
Could be mosquitoes where...

552
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:35,315
The way they behave
on this part of the island.

553
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:37,893
Something's happening to her
that's triggering her hormones.

554
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,397
The dog has died!

555
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,070
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, my god.

556
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:43,732
He was only just alive.

557
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:46,159
- Kara, hold on to me, baby.
- What's happening?

558
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:49,621
Who thinks they can swim

559
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:53,200
a hundred lengths of a pool
against currents,

560
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:56,957
and then turn and swim
an unknown amount along the coast

561
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,458
till we find another shore?

562
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:03,919
That's what I'm guessing the distance is
to swim out and get around this cove.

563
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:18,730
It looks too far. Babe, it's not safe.

564
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,527
My name is Brendon.

565
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,313
I went to private school.

566
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,070
My mom is an attorney,
and my dad is a dentist.

567
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:29,862
- Yo, I just wanted somebody to know that.
- Okay.

568
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:33,198
I have a problem with my blood.
A rare issue with its clotting.

569
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:36,160
I came to this island to see the ocean

570
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:39,712
and remember I'm connected
to something bigger.

571
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,332
That's beautiful, Brendon.

572
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:46,545
I don't feel the same way
I felt yesterday or this morning,

573
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,005
and I don't think
my parents would understand.

574
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:52,475
My thoughts have more colors in them now.

575
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,730
Yesterday, I had a few colors
and they were really strong,

576
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:59,899
and now I have more and they're quieter.

577
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,560
Okay!

578
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,821
Everyone, gather!

579
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,819
Come on, come on, come on!

580
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,401
Everyone needs to have a voice here.

581
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,740
Are you sure we have time for this?

582
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,743
We will make destructive decisions
if we don't feel safe with each other.

583
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:18,326
I know we don't have time,
but why don't we start with you two?

584
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,453
Why are you here?

585
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:26,088
- We've been having a tough time...
- Chrystal.

586
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:28,424
We've been going through something.

587
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:31,257
He's under a lot of stress as a doctor.
He needed some time away.

588
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:33,182
Everyone does.
I'm not unusual in that.

589
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,806
Charles, it's okay.
I'm not gonna say anything else.

590
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:38,604
Good! It's nice to hear from you both.

591
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:40,974
How about you guys?

592
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:47,822
It's nothing.

593
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,905
We just have to make a decision.

594
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,860
The kids are reacting to something.

595
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:55,789
It's a virus. It's probably a virus.

596
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,874
I just need to catch my breath.

597
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,953
I just started feeling weird a minute ago.

598
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,503
Are you okay, mom?

599
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,296
- Mom?
- What's wrong?

600
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:05,464
Are you okay, mom?

601
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:07,417
I don't think it's the...

602
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,298
- She has a tumor.
- What?

603
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,149
But it's benign.
They said it's benign.

604
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:12,339
Oh, my god.

605
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,593
Mom?

606
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,306
Is it... where?

607
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:19,388
- Mom?
- It's okay.

608
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,813
Can I...

609
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,061
I can feel it.
It's the size of a golf ball.

610
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,894
No, it's supposed to be
three centimeters.

611
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,820
All right. Let me see.

612
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,613
- Whoa! Prisca!
- Mom!

613
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,157
- She's gonna faint.
- Prisca.

614
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,244
Mom.

615
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,944
- Let her get some air!
- Wake up, pris. Don't do this.

616
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,535
It's there.

617
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,043
It's been there for a while.
It's the size of a softball.

618
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,245
Jesus.

619
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,090
It's grown. “What?

620
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,460
- What's happening to mom?
- What's going on?

621
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,838
- Dad! Dad, what's happening to mom?
- It's okay.

622
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:53,513
Trent, why don't you two guys go play
somewhere else on the beach, okay? Okay?

623
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,057
Mom's a little bit tired.
Would you do that for me, tiger?

624
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,904
The first adult
is being affected.

625
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:59,099
What if we cut it out?

626
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,749
- Dad!
- Not possible.

627
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:03,059
Actually, it is. But it's guy's call.

628
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:04,891
No! No, no, no! No!

629
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:07,398
I don't wanna make this decision.
No. No, [...

630
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,779
I don't know what to do.

631
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,700
Do we have alcohol? Yes.

632
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,280
Some bottles from the minibar.

633
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,366
I cannot be held responsible.
You understand?

634
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:22,461
Yes.

635
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,083
Okay. Well, does anyone
have a needle and thread?

636
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:28,961
- We have to sew this up.
- Yeah, yeah. Uh...

637
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:31,293
Here. Here. Is this the right decision?

638
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,782
- Maybe we should all talk about this.
- I can't think.

639
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,467
This tumor is going to kill her.

640
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:44,439
Did you know that Jack Nicholson
did a film with Marlon Brando?

641
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,525
Oh, no.

642
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:47,854
What is he saying?

643
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,278
- What was the name of that film?
- Charles, breathe.

644
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:51,855
Are you okay? Yes.

645
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,282
- Will you let me do my job, please?
- Is he okay?

646
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:18,517
Cut her again.

647
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,058
We'll keep our hands in there
to keep the incision open.

648
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,976
Guy, I can help, brother.

649
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:24,725
No, I'll take care of her.

650
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,376
Does anyone know the name of that film?

651
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:30,606
It was with Jack Nicholson
and Marlon Brando.

652
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,278
- Both.
- Try again, doctor.

653
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:37,989
Oblique incision on the side of the belly,
four to six inches. You can do this.

654
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,281
Put your fingers inside the incision.

655
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:44,456
Okay.

656
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:46,500
Can you open it
a little wider, please?

657
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,332
It's closing around my fingers.

658
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:52,086
Keep pulling it apart. That's it.

659
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,375
I'm lifting the tumor out.

660
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,346
Wow! It's the size of a cantaloupe!

661
00:41:58,433 --> 00:41:59,433
Wait!

662
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,091
It's attached to something.

663
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,226
- Muscle tissue.
- Okay.

664
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:08,272
Could you hold the incision open
a little wider, if you would?

665
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:10,854
I'm so sorry, pris.

666
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,561
Just cutting underneath the tumor.

667
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:16,864
Okay. Got it.

668
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,832
Mom.

669
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,582
Prisca?

670
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,009
Mom?

671
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:54,818
It's okay.

672
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,321
I just fainted.

673
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,067
We took the tumor out.

674
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,027
It was going to kill you.

675
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,699
Your husband made a fast decision.

676
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:21,463
Guy, I feel better.

677
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:42,828
Damn!

678
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:46,821
Come on, y'all, look at this!

679
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,203
Hurry!

680
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:54,291
Damn.

681
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,006
Come on, y'all!

682
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:07,675
Can we all agree I didn't do that?

683
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:09,848
What happened to her?

684
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:11,895
The body has decomposed.

685
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,769
- How quickly can that happen?
- A long time.

686
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:16,192
Mom knows this stuff.

687
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:18,520
I'm not a forensic pathologist,

688
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:21,071
but from excavations for the museum,

689
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:24,367
I know that it varies
based on soil and temperature.

690
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:27,365
My best guess, an exposed body,

691
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:30,789
the flesh will be gone
in approximately seven years.

692
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,708
And this happened in, what,
three hours?

693
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:34,956
I know.

694
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:38,631
And bones, we've found,
will disintegrate in 30 years more.

695
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,674
What the hell, man?

696
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:44,299
On this beach, less than 20 hours
after you die, you just return to dust.

697
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:46,926
What exactly are we saying?

698
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,054
Something is going on
with time on this beach.

699
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:50,893
Time?

700
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,101
You have wrinkles.

701
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,662
I'm scared.

702
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:23,176
It's best to focus on specifics
in the present in unsettling situations.

703
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,753
- Mm-hmm.
- Like breathing.

704
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,714
What's happening to us?

705
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,475
Are we sick, too?

706
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:32,768
No, I don't think so.

707
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:34,971
I think we're just growing.

708
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,769
Going by Trent and Maddox's ages

709
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,691
and the time we spent on this beach,

710
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:44,614
half an hour is equivalent
to something like one year of our lives.

711
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:48,405
This must be true for all of us,
we just don't see it on everyone.

712
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,001
It's the first time
they wished they were black.

713
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:52,082
Mm-hmm.

714
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,452
The kids are eating so much
because their mass is growing.

715
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:58,502
They need to grow
an enormous amount of mass quickly.

716
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,671
We're staying roughly the same mass.

717
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,589
Our cells are just aging.

718
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:04,550
I don't feel the same.

719
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,215
It's like my mind is changing, too.

720
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:11,049
I'm getting many thoughts
at the same time.

721
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:13,263
It's weird.

722
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,270
I'm not as scared
about what's happening to us.

723
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,382
What about our hair and nails?

724
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,363
Shouldn't they be growing
at an abnormal rate?

725
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,532
Maybe it has to do with
the fact that the cells

726
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,610
in hair and nails are dead,

727
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:32,946
and they aren't reacting
in the same way.

728
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,578
On this beach, 60 minutes is two years.

729
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:39,957
We'll age almost 50 years in one day here.

730
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,046
Almost a lifetime.

731
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,757
I think it could be the rock
that surrounds this beach.

732
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:52,799
If our cells are being affected,

733
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:55,635
speeding up in their processes,

734
00:46:56,814 --> 00:47:01,433
then us trying to leave
is like swimming to the surface too fast

735
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:02,983
after being deep in the ocean.

736
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,482
Our bodies can't reacclimate.

737
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:08,648
That's why we go unconscious
when we try to leave.

738
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:16,372
Maybe we could slowly
walk through the canyon,

739
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:18,700
take a step, stand still.

740
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:22,374
Do it over eight to ten hours.

741
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:24,997
Let our bodies acclimate.

742
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,794
But, according to prisca's timeline,

743
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:32,346
who would be willing to give up
20 years of their life trying?

744
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,553
I'm sorry, this is nonsense.

745
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:36,179
Let's not shut down everyone's experience.

746
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,056
Wait. Where are the kids?

747
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:44,069
Trent!

748
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:45,612
Kara!

749
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:49,280
Answer us now! We need you here!

750
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:50,573
There they are.

751
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,748
- Want some?
- No, I'm not hungry.

752
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,270
Hey.

753
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:27,772
Mom! Dad!

754
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,419
Kara.

755
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:50,125
- What did you do?
- We were just playing.

756
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:52,426
It's okay. I just got a little fat.

757
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:53,673
Mom, you're better.

758
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:56,930
Maddox?

759
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,221
- Maddox?
- It's okay, Trent.

760
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,892
Just let mom and dad figure this out.

761
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:07,975
My god, guy.

762
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:11,107
It's okay, right, mom?

763
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:17,243
Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando
were in a movie together.

764
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:22,991
If she walked into the emergency room,
I'd say she's about five months pregnant.

765
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,791
What?? “What?

766
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,961
Just stay calm, Trent.

767
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:30,539
She'll only be pregnant for about
20 minutes from the time of conception.

768
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,671
Why do you keep looking at me
like you wanna steal my wallet?

769
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:36,242
- Do you want me to punch you in the face?
- Calm down.

770
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:38,844
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- All right.

771
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:42,802
Let's just concentrate
on the issue at hand.

772
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:44,182
Do you know about movies?

773
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:46,514
Dad, mom tells you to sit down
when you get like this.

774
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:49,191
Hey. We need to get her help. Okay?

775
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:51,769
- This cannot happen here.
- It's gotten bigger.

776
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:54,446
Kara? It's Kara, right?
Yeah. Yeah.

777
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:55,568
Lay down on a blanket.

778
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,742
It's gonna be okay. There's
a lot of people here that can help you.

779
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,114
We're all like your family now.

780
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:01,491
Oh, god.

781
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:02,582
Ohh.

782
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,577
Our cells are aging very fast here.

783
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,034
Something to do with the rocks
around the beach, we think.

784
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,744
Just lay down on the sand, okay?

785
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:12,047
Whatever would have happened to us
is happening to us really fast, okay?

786
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,134
I know.

787
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:14,925
What you did is how babies are made.

788
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,852
I know, but I thought you had
to do that ten times or something.

789
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:20,535
- Take deep breaths. I'll breathe with you.
- Did I get that wrong?

790
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,891
- Baby, come on.
- It can happen after only once.

791
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:26,390
We didn't get a chance
to talk about all this.

792
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:29,519
- Are Trent and I having a baby?
- Did I get it wrong?

793
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,771
Only a couple of minutes left
if we're right.

794
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:34,903
- Is that the baby? Mom.
- You got it. Okay.

795
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,400
- Charles!
- Kara?

796
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:38,403
I need to think
about what to do.

797
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:40,860
No! I need to help her.

798
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:43,321
- Mom! I'm scared!
- It's okay.

799
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,406
- Kara, wait. Stay with me.
- I'm here, baby.

800
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:46,895
- Stay with me.
- Just take my hand.

801
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:48,409
Come on. Baby, can you hold her hand?

802
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:50,790
I've decided I'm gonna marry her.

803
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:54,089
And we are never gonna yell at each other
and we are never getting divorced!

804
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:58,010
Trent, listen to me.
She's going to feel pain. Intense pain.

805
00:50:58,097 --> 00:51:00,053
Okay? Like she never felt before.

806
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,758
But then it's going to pass. Okay?
It's going to pass.

807
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,638
- You did it, girl!
- Mom!

808
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,265
- All right.
- Chrystal.

809
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,104
Chrystal!

810
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:15,277
Hey, you blacked out.
You can't go that way.

811
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:18,940
Come on. You're okay now.
Come on.

812
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,241
Get up. Get up.

813
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,568
- Come here.
- No.

814
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,497
Look.

815
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,918
You're okay. Come on. Come on.

816
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:34,834
- Babies crying helps them breathe.
- It's here.

817
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,461
We looked that up. Remember, mom?

818
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:41,556
You see?

819
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,224
We put him on the towel
to clean him up.

820
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:54,229
He looked around and closed his eyes.

821
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,732
We had him on the towel for one minute.

822
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:59,188
He died from lack of attention.

823
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:02,241
Things are moving
too fast here for a baby to survive.

824
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:05,153
No. No, you're lying.

825
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,659
You're lying! You're all lying!
You're lying!

826
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:08,750
Shut up, Trent.

827
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,995
- Hey. Hey!
- You're lying!

828
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:16,251
Maybe we should all talk
about what just happened.

829
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:22,465
Charles, get us out of here!

830
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,803
Get us out of here now!
You were supposed to protect us!

831
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,976
You didn't protect us.

832
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:30,553
Kara's hurt!

833
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:34,978
I will make these decisions.
Just give me a second.

834
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:43,319
I used to see you in our neighborhood.
Who are you?

835
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,655
I'm jarin!

836
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,656
I don't know where you live.

837
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,372
Don't condescend to me.

838
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,545
Put some makeup on your face.

839
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:22,191
I'm sorry about the baby.

840
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:27,113
When I was your age,
I was in love with a man.

841
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,033
His name was giuseppe.

842
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,330
He wasn't very handsome,
and I left him.

843
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:39,087
We looked silly together, he and I.

844
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:51,008
He had nothing to offer.

845
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:56,935
For some reason,
I think about him a lot here.

846
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,242
Leave me alone.

847
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:24,800
- No, Charles!
- Stop!

848
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:26,593
Stop!

849
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:39,227
He's gone.

850
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:40,808
Oh, god.

851
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:07,339
I'm just going to take it.

852
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,341
- Now...
- It's okay.

853
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:16,848
Everything will be okay.

854
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,741
I'll find another beach
and I'll try to find help.

855
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:40,917
She needs her medicine.

856
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:45,914
It must be the beach.
Whatever it's doing to my body.

857
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,839
Guy, I was on the swim team. I'll make it.

858
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:53,099
I'll make it.

859
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,430
Watch him.

860
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:20,370
Maybe I could climb that rock.

861
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:25,796
Maybe the effect, the blacking out,
doesn't happen if you go up.

862
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:27,873
You can't do it.

863
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,134
- I'll do it.
- Yeah, he's strong. He can do it.

864
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,802
- Yeah.
- No.

865
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,721
I won't allow my son to do that.

866
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,639
Prisca's right.
It's too dangerous.

867
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:38,058
It's a last resort.

868
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:39,937
Mum...

869
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:44,602
I do feel... overwhelmed.

870
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:49,479
I'm managing, but no one must know.

871
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,073
They'll try to stop me from working.

872
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:56,614
What should I do?

873
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,072
Mum, tell me what to do.

874
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:05,544
Prisca,
something's bothering me.

875
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,752
Charles's family knew he had
some kind of mental disorder.

876
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:11,334
Someone in each group was sick.

877
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:14,170
How did you first hear about this place?

878
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,755
I don't know. I fell upon it.

879
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:20,434
A random sweepstakes.
It came with a receipt at the pharmacy.

880
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,353
I just followed it up online,
started getting emails.

881
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,180
They know our medical condition.

882
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,435
They chose us.

883
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:30,106
They have our passports.
We could just disappear.

884
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:33,238
They sent us a special car to the airport.

885
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:34,325
A plane.

886
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:38,110
They can make it look
like we never left the house.

887
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,589
You were thinking
about leaving dad.

888
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:58,888
Weren't you?

889
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:06,434
Yes.

890
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:10,518
I didn't want you two to suffer.

891
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,231
Was there someone else?

892
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:29,161
Did dad know?

893
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,049
Maddox.

894
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:44,471
Please.

895
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:50,103
I found out about this tumor
and I got scared.

896
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:54,528
I stare at the remains
of nameless people in glass cases

897
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:57,731
and I kept thinking
I'm going to be one of those people.

898
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:59,032
Does that make any sense?

899
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:04,534
I feel different than I felt yesterday.

900
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:10,335
What I did feels like an illusion,
I swear.

901
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:14,669
You hate me now.

902
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,507
I just need some time, mom.

903
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:27,136
We don't have that, baby.

904
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,436
Look at you.

905
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,186
You're an adult.

906
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:41,278
Be strong for everyone.

907
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:48,160
Connect to something bigger.

908
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:50,765
Here, here, hold on.
Lay him down, lay him down.

909
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,707
He must have gone unconscious swimming.

910
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:21,667
Brendon didn't do anything to that woman.

911
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,627
We can't swim out, prisca.

912
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:36,227
We're not getting off this beach.

913
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:43,280
We never had a prom,
or a graduation.

914
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,778
There are so many memories we didn't have.

915
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,489
It's not fair.

916
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:56,083
He needs to rest now.

917
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:32,957
Kara!

918
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:36,669
Kara!

919
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,124
Wait. What if you get dizzy up there?

920
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:42,752
- You might black out.
- Trent, we're in charge now.

921
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:44,298
My dad could hurt more people.

922
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,422
I have to get him off this beach.

923
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:48,299
Karal don't climb that.

924
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:51,052
Come down! We'll find another way.

925
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,391
No! Don't! Trent!

926
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:55,759
- Listen to mom.
- I have to go with her!

927
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:58,806
Kara, wait! Don't climb.
Let me get your mother.

928
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,016
- Kara!
- That's not the way.

929
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:03,648
She's panicked and desperate.
Talk to each other.

930
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:06,901
Kara, you and I
should just stay together.

931
01:03:06,992 --> 01:03:09,358
What if we spend this whole time
trying to get out of here

932
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,567
and we still don't make it?

933
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:14,571
It'll be too short if we don't try.

934
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:16,156
No, Kara, please!

935
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:18,287
Please just stay with me, please!

936
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:36,222
If she makes it to the ledge,
she might have a chance.

937
01:03:38,106 --> 01:03:39,687
Go to the ledge and rest!

938
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:44,691
Oh, shit.

939
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:46,315
There has to be a way out.

940
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:49,815
It's a mathematical certainty.
There must be a way out.

941
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:03,002
No. Why is she stopping?

942
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:06,877
No, Kara.

943
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:08,208
Kara, wake up!

944
01:04:08,303 --> 01:04:11,261
Kara, wake up! Wake up!

945
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:15,973
Ohl

946
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,600
Kara?

947
01:05:02,774 --> 01:05:03,774
Daddy...

948
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:24,917
Let's all stay together.

949
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,791
Nobody in this family goes alone anywhere.

950
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,844
I think I figured it out.
I'm using these to swim out.

951
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,516
I have a sister.

952
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:43,979
She's a therapist, too.
I need to get to my sister.

953
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,768
We never talk.
We had a fight a long time ago.

954
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:50,148
She's older, but now I am.

955
01:05:51,406 --> 01:05:53,863
The fighting seems ridiculous now.

956
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:00,706
Patricia.

957
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:02,291
Patricia.

958
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,078
No.

959
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:08,036
What's happening to her?

960
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,917
She was fine. What's happening?

961
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:12,294
She keeps stopping and starting.

962
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:18,213
Dad, do something.

963
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:32,154
No.

964
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:09,181
Oh, no.

965
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:12,608
Kara?

966
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:17,321
Kara, where are you?

967
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:24,120
Somebody's done this to us, Kara.

968
01:07:27,085 --> 01:07:29,542
I can't protect you anymore.

969
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,211
Kara!

970
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:45,262
No, you don't know.
Jarin went in a different way.

971
01:07:45,353 --> 01:07:47,594
He went...
And I'm a better swimmer than he is.

972
01:07:47,689 --> 01:07:50,021
He's older than me.
I could probably swim left...

973
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:52,770
Trent, stop it. No. No.

974
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:55,047
- No, you're not a better swimmer.
- Let me try.

975
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,391
- You're not even gonna let me try.
- Listen. Listen.

976
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:58,448
Listen.

977
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:15,276
- Then I can get on the rock.
- We're not gonna let you.

978
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,881
Stop. It won't work.

979
01:08:16,968 --> 01:08:19,380
I don't wanna give up.
I really don't wanna give up.

980
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:21,532
- We're not giving up.
- If you let me try...

981
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:40,487
My back.

982
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:42,906
I need my calcium.

983
01:08:42,994 --> 01:08:44,074
Chrystal?

984
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:46,743
Chrystal, stay with us.

985
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:48,780
Don't look at me.

986
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:10,010
Prisca, I have to tell you something.

987
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:17,650
I saw your text messages one day.

988
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,565
He says romantic things.

989
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:32,744
I'm sorry.

990
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:41,212
I don't know who I would have been
okay with. But with that guy?

991
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:48,347
He's a joke, he's a pretend person.

992
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,517
You deserve someone
so much better than that.

993
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:56,310
I should have said something
when I saw it.

994
01:09:56,401 --> 01:09:59,063
I hide from everything.
I'm a fucking coward.

995
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:02,145
This was no one's responsibility but me.

996
01:10:03,074 --> 01:10:05,861
Your anger should be
aimed at me, just me.

997
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:17,873
There's no place I want to be
but with you.

998
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:21,668
Do you believe me?

999
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:25,877
I want to be here...

1000
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:31,719
Right now.

1001
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:53,829
It's notebooks.

1002
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:01,917
Well, maybe we can use some
of the empty pages for the fire,

1003
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:03,498
keep mom and dad warm.

1004
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,509
Whoever it was wanted
to be a science-fiction writer.

1005
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,010
It's full of story ideas.

1006
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:16,761
"Birds that can make you black out
when they scream,

1007
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:20,269
fly too close to an Emirates
commercial plane one day."

1008
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:24,565
He realized he was never getting off
this beach.

1009
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:28,940
He was trying to figure out
what's going on.

1010
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:35,952
"Magnetism of this exact spot on the earth

1011
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:37,953
with the rocks on this beach,

1012
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:41,161
submerged beneath the ocean
for millions of years,

1013
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:43,291
deposited with special minerals,

1014
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:46,749
are causing our cells
to age at a rapid rate.

1015
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,510
Are there other places like this?

1016
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:52,046
Who found this place?"

1017
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:57,135
Maybe we can make a metal tube
that we can get in

1018
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:59,061
that stops the effects on our cells.

1019
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:03,267
Like at a dentist's office when they put
a metal vest on us before an X-ray.

1020
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:06,895
I mean, then we could just walk out
with it on us and...

1021
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:11,073
We'll get dizzy at first, but slowly we'll
get used to it and we can leave, right?

1022
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,153
Where are we gonna make a metal tube?

1023
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:19,563
He wrote down a list of
all the names and the addresses

1024
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:21,163
of the people with him on the beach.

1025
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:32,215
Maddox, that's a camera.

1026
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:36,473
They're recording us.

1027
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:41,178
Why would they do this?

1028
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:20,013
Oh, no.

1029
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:21,310
Who is that?

1030
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:23,437
Prisca, who is that?

1031
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:33,488
You're gonna tell them what I did.

1032
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:37,530
The man with the tattoos,

1033
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:41,952
he was gonna steal things from my home.

1034
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,204
Guy!

1035
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:50,460
- Aah!
- No!

1036
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:52,462
I can't let you tell them.

1037
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:53,838
I'm a good doctor.

1038
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:57,013
He was gonna follow us,
he was gonna steal things from our home.

1039
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,305
Why don't you believe me?

1040
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:00,602
I stopped him.

1041
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,270
Tell me where the knife is, prisca!

1042
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:11,102
I keep having these thoughts.

1043
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:13,528
Listen, they keep coming to me.

1044
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:15,698
Don't tell anyone.

1045
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:23,448
Prisca, hide the kids!
I'll protect you!

1046
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:29,916
Yes.

1047
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:31,167
Maddox!

1048
01:14:31,258 --> 01:14:32,464
Trent!

1049
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:36,169
I need you two to go
and find somewhere to hide now!

1050
01:14:36,263 --> 01:14:39,050
Somewhere where someone can't find you.
I need you to go right now!

1051
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:41,422
- Mom, what? Wait.
- And don't ask any questions!

1052
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,217
Now, go! Hide!

1053
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:46,095
Gol

1054
01:14:57,576 --> 01:14:58,576
Shh.

1055
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,444
There's someone in here with us.

1056
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,956
My body hurts to move.

1057
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:13,460
I miss giuseppe.

1058
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:15,879
Don't look at me!

1059
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:18,260
Turn off the light!

1060
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:24,217
I don't wanna be seen!

1061
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:25,311
Argh.

1062
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:29,855
Kara's dead, isn't she?

1063
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:33,859
Whoever did this killed her, didn't they?

1064
01:15:35,406 --> 01:15:36,566
Kara died.

1065
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,282
But it was an accident.

1066
01:15:53,007 --> 01:15:54,463
Aah!

1067
01:16:06,312 --> 01:16:09,054
Don't look!

1068
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:11,555
God, it's already healed
in the wrong position.

1069
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:13,515
Turn off the light!

1070
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:18,187
Turn the light off.

1071
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:22,446
I'm chief medical officer of my hospital!

1072
01:16:22,536 --> 01:16:24,447
I am not gonna let you

1073
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:26,703
take it away from me!

1074
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:32,163
Argh.

1075
01:17:26,016 --> 01:17:27,256
It's rust.

1076
01:17:28,936 --> 01:17:31,803
It acts like poison
when it gets into your bloodstream.

1077
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:57,832
I'm sorry you were on this beach.

1078
01:17:59,884 --> 01:18:01,465
But this is my family.

1079
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,907
Dad, mom,
you guys gotta stay hydrated.

1080
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:16,115
Mom.

1081
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:17,912
Mom.

1082
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:20,540
Are you warm enough?

1083
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:25,355
Were we fighting about something?

1084
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:30,238
We were.

1085
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:37,329
Well, whatever it was,
I'm not mad anymore.

1086
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:46,963
I can't remember.

1087
01:20:51,805 --> 01:20:54,672
Why did we want
to leave this beach?

1088
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:02,013
So beautiful.

1089
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:08,314
It doesn't matter.

1090
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:16,652
It's funny.

1091
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:21,748
I forget...

1092
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:25,161
The word.

1093
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:30,503
It's about my feelings for you.

1094
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:35,755
I know.

1095
01:21:57,621 --> 01:21:58,861
- Dad?
- Dad.

1096
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:54,962
Mom?

1097
01:22:59,349 --> 01:23:00,555
Oh, mom.

1098
01:24:33,527 --> 01:24:37,645
We have about 13 hours left,
do you think?

1099
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:47,363
Hmm.

1100
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:53,251
We just got three days older
while you held my face.

1101
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:01,422
Should we keep trying to get out?

1102
01:25:05,183 --> 01:25:06,343
I guess so.

1103
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,556
Wanna make a sandcastle first?

1104
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:43,176
I wonder if everybody
continues to feel like a kid

1105
01:25:43,263 --> 01:25:44,548
when they're our age or...

1106
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:48,298
Is it because we were kids yesterday?

1107
01:25:50,187 --> 01:25:52,803
Idlib sent me a message
I never decoded.

1108
01:25:53,607 --> 01:25:56,223
Yeah, we thought we were so smart.

1109
01:25:58,820 --> 01:25:59,935
Decode it.

1110
01:26:22,052 --> 01:26:23,838
Each symbol means a letter.

1111
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:27,546
We thought we were like spies.

1112
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,561
What was the big message?

1113
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:51,615
What's it say?

1114
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:13,016
The coral might protect us
from the effects of the rocks.

1115
01:27:13,687 --> 01:27:16,645
Maybe that's like our metal tube.

1116
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:18,939
Maybe we're just making up
what we want to hear.

1117
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:21,311
Maybe he heard
they took people to this beach.

1118
01:27:21,862 --> 01:27:23,773
Idlib heard something he shouldn't have.

1119
01:27:24,614 --> 01:27:27,447
He has no idea what it means,
but he knows it's bad.

1120
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:32,118
He's trying to help us.

1121
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:34,575
Wait.

1122
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:36,702
I need to get something.

1123
01:29:54,764 --> 01:29:55,799
Both of them drowned.

1124
01:29:57,726 --> 01:30:00,593
For a second, I thought
they were gonna get through the coral.

1125
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:02,928
I don't know how they suddenly thought
about going there.

1126
01:30:03,023 --> 01:30:04,854
Theo, are you sure
they didn't make it?

1127
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:06,181
We can't have another incident.

1128
01:30:06,276 --> 01:30:08,608
Sidney, relax.
I watched for a minute and a half.

1129
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:12,654
And the person who got through last year
ended up drowning anyway.

1130
01:30:12,741 --> 01:30:13,776
We're fine.

1131
01:30:14,743 --> 01:30:17,485
Final members of trial 73 are deceased.

1132
01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:19,194
Observations complete.

1133
01:30:19,998 --> 01:30:22,239
Bringing drives back, returning to base.

1134
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:43,699
All rooms for this trial
have been cleared.

1135
01:31:43,790 --> 01:31:46,327
Uh, home computer devices
have been wiped.

1136
01:31:46,418 --> 01:31:48,750
Three home computers
still waiting to be scrubbed.

1137
01:31:56,886 --> 01:31:58,877
Hello. Uh...

1138
01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:03,135
A moment of silence
for the members of trial 73.

1139
01:32:11,901 --> 01:32:12,936
Thank you.

1140
01:32:15,321 --> 01:32:18,358
Um... I'll try not to be dramatic.

1141
01:32:21,161 --> 01:32:23,072
Because of this beach,

1142
01:32:24,122 --> 01:32:27,455
we have been able to save
hundreds of thousands of lives

1143
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:28,827
with new medicines.

1144
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:32,623
Before we're done, it will be millions.

1145
01:32:34,799 --> 01:32:39,293
As you know,
we do trials and fail constantly.

1146
01:32:42,015 --> 01:32:43,755
But not today.

1147
01:32:44,934 --> 01:32:46,094
Tell them, Sidney.

1148
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:54,850
One of this cohort
was a woman with the epileptic seizures.

1149
01:32:55,612 --> 01:32:57,148
Her name was Patricia Carmichael.

1150
01:32:57,238 --> 01:32:59,980
She suffered debilitating seizures
her whole life.

1151
01:33:00,075 --> 01:33:01,565
Nothing could help her.

1152
01:33:02,285 --> 01:33:06,449
The medicine we gave her when she arrived
turned out to be the exact mixture.

1153
01:33:07,373 --> 01:33:10,536
She didn't have a seizure
for 8 hours and 17 minutes.

1154
01:33:12,295 --> 01:33:14,411
Sixteen and a half years.

1155
01:33:15,465 --> 01:33:17,751
We cured her of her epilepsy.

1156
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:20,379
We'll now fast-track trials,

1157
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:23,837
make that medicine
and share it with the whole world.

1158
01:33:24,474 --> 01:33:26,385
Every single person that needs it.

1159
01:33:31,356 --> 01:33:34,223
Nature made that beach exist for a reason.

1160
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:37,730
Warren and Warren was meant to find it
on their research expedition.

1161
01:33:37,821 --> 01:33:42,155
We were meant to test medicines
in one day, instead of a lifetime.

1162
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:46,110
Lots more work to be done, everyone.

1163
01:33:46,830 --> 01:33:50,493
Let's do what nature wanted us to do.

1164
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:00,832
Mr. and Mrs. Brody will arrive
at 11:00 A.M.

1165
01:34:00,927 --> 01:34:02,838
With six non-targeted guests.

1166
01:34:02,929 --> 01:34:05,511
Joseph Brody has early-onset Parkinson's.

1167
01:34:06,683 --> 01:34:08,548
Florence Brody will be accompanying him.

1168
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:10,975
I'm gonna be a broken record
about this, nils.

1169
01:34:11,062 --> 01:34:13,553
We should separate
the pure medical subjects

1170
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:15,309
from the mental illness subjects.

1171
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:18,517
Our violent schizophrenic patient cost us
the data on our blood clot patient.

1172
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:21,068
Sidney, I doubt we'll alter protocol
at this point,

1173
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:25,570
but put it in a form
and submit it to Warren and Warren again.

1174
01:34:49,851 --> 01:34:50,851
How are you?

1175
01:34:53,646 --> 01:34:56,479
Those kids went home.
They don't matter.

1176
01:34:56,566 --> 01:34:58,557
I tell you which kids you can play with.

1177
01:34:58,651 --> 01:35:00,232
You have to trust me

1178
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:03,278
and don't ask questions. Okay?

1179
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:06,401
- Okay.
- Good.

1180
01:35:07,243 --> 01:35:08,779
Now, those kids are fine.

1181
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:10,735
See, you can play with them.

1182
01:35:11,664 --> 01:35:13,245
- Okay.
- Good.

1183
01:35:30,934 --> 01:35:32,549
You're a police officer.

1184
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:36,396
Yeah.

1185
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,741
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Brody.

1186
01:35:57,835 --> 01:36:00,998
Welcome to our version of paradise.

1187
01:36:01,923 --> 01:36:03,333
Thank you.

1188
01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:06,628
- It's lovely.
- Thank you.

1189
01:36:07,262 --> 01:36:08,593
This is Madrid.

1190
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:11,592
From your food and beverage preferences
that you selected,

1191
01:36:12,558 --> 01:36:14,799
we've made you cocktails to welcome you.

1192
01:36:16,521 --> 01:36:19,012
- Sorry.
- No worries, Mr. and Mrs. Brody.

1193
01:36:19,107 --> 01:36:20,893
We'll just make a new set.

1194
01:36:20,984 --> 01:36:22,474
It'll only take a few moments.

1195
01:36:22,568 --> 01:36:24,433
I wouldn't take
anything they give you.

1196
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:26,190
They left us all to die.

1197
01:36:28,992 --> 01:36:31,233
My name is Trent capa.

1198
01:36:31,911 --> 01:36:33,492
I'm Maddox capa.

1199
01:36:39,544 --> 01:36:41,626
All three are missing persons?

1200
01:36:42,755 --> 01:36:44,871
Sending you the rest of the names now.

1201
01:36:50,638 --> 01:36:53,926
Our parents
are guy and prisca capa.

1202
01:36:54,017 --> 01:36:57,885
We live at 707 pine street,
Philadelphia, usa.

1203
01:36:58,896 --> 01:37:02,138
Also with us was jarin carmichaél,
who was a nurse.

1204
01:37:12,702 --> 01:37:15,114
Listen, we have to get security.
What's happening?

1205
01:37:15,204 --> 01:37:16,614
Are you listening to me?

1206
01:37:57,914 --> 01:38:00,246
Gentlemen. Hey, hey, hey!

1207
01:38:00,333 --> 01:38:03,040
Gentlemen, we have a problem.
We need your assistance immediately.

1208
01:38:03,127 --> 01:38:05,118
Two of our guests need your attention.

1209
01:38:05,213 --> 01:38:07,579
Please solve this problem, now.

1210
01:40:18,679 --> 01:40:20,239
They've arrested everybody here.

1211
01:40:21,307 --> 01:40:24,925
Subpoenas are being served at Warren
and Warren's headquarters this week.

1212
01:40:30,608 --> 01:40:32,098
Let's get them to the airport.

1213
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:35,351
Your aunt will be waiting for you
when you land.

1214
01:40:35,446 --> 01:40:36,902
How's she handling things?

1215
01:40:37,907 --> 01:40:40,614
How would you feel
if a 50-year-old man called and told you

1216
01:40:40,701 --> 01:40:42,612
he was your six-year-old nephew?

1217
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,206
We'll be okay.
