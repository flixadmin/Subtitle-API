1
00:00:02,604 --> 00:00:04,484
<i>You've both met bad men before.</i>

2
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:07,804
The man we're about to meet
is the devil.

3
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:10,284
<i>My name's Mosley.
Oswald Mosley.</i>

4
00:00:10,404 --> 00:00:12,004
You've come to my attention.

5
00:00:12,124 --> 00:00:13,524
Michael Gray.

6
00:00:13,644 --> 00:00:15,364
<i>You lost all your cousin's
money in America,</i>

7
00:00:15,484 --> 00:00:16,284
<i>playing the fool.</i>

8
00:00:16,404 --> 00:00:18,444
And poor old Arthur Shelby.

9
00:00:18,564 --> 00:00:21,404
His wife has been seen
with another man.

10
00:00:21,524 --> 00:00:22,524
Ah!

11
00:00:23,244 --> 00:00:25,124
May you Peaky Blinders all rot.

12
00:00:27,724 --> 00:00:29,844
If you're going to England,
I'm coming with you.

13
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:32,404
- I want to meet your family.
- No, you don't.

14
00:00:33,964 --> 00:00:36,804
Mr Thomas,
it is the purest opium

15
00:00:36,924 --> 00:00:38,644
that has ever arrived in Europe.

16
00:00:38,764 --> 00:00:40,324
£250,000.

17
00:00:40,444 --> 00:00:43,044
All we have to do
is keep it here for a week.

18
00:00:43,164 --> 00:00:44,204
I vote against it, Tom.

19
00:00:44,324 --> 00:00:46,164
Those in favour?

20
00:00:46,284 --> 00:00:47,084
Motion carried.

21
00:00:47,204 --> 00:00:48,604
Agh!

22
00:00:48,724 --> 00:00:51,844
We're talking about
an empty chair, Ada.

23
00:00:51,964 --> 00:00:54,084
My chair. My throne.

24
00:00:54,204 --> 00:00:56,564
<i>Someone wants my crown.
I think it might be Michael.</i>

25
00:00:56,684 --> 00:00:59,004
Mr Shelby, my name
is Captain Swing.

26
00:00:59,124 --> 00:01:01,244
<i>Michael, your kin,</i>

27
00:01:01,364 --> 00:01:02,404
was making deals

28
00:01:02,524 --> 00:01:04,044
<i>with the Very men
who want you dead.</i>

29
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,844
I'm doing this for you, Tommy.

30
00:01:07,004 --> 00:01:08,484
It's time.

31
00:01:08,604 --> 00:01:10,524
And you know it.

32
00:01:11,484 --> 00:01:12,644
Let me guess.

33
00:01:13,684 --> 00:01:15,364
Don't fuck
with the Peaky Blinders.

34
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:18,724
There will be a war,
and one of you will die.

35
00:01:18,844 --> 00:01:20,764
But which one, I cannot tell.

36
00:01:20,884 --> 00:01:22,204
I'll do what I have to do, Pol.

37
00:01:22,324 --> 00:01:25,724
Kill... and kill.

38
00:01:25,844 --> 00:01:26,964
I have a job for you.

39
00:01:27,084 --> 00:01:28,684
<i>I'm going to shoot
Oswald Mosley.</i>

40
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:31,924
<i>Kill the man, kill the message.</i>

41
00:01:41,604 --> 00:01:43,724
I think it's about time
we got off the stage, old man.

42
00:01:43,844 --> 00:01:45,284
The Chinese, the Italians...

43
00:01:45,404 --> 00:01:47,924
Mosley knew nothing!

44
00:01:48,044 --> 00:01:49,844
He knew nothing!

45
00:01:49,964 --> 00:01:51,564
Who?!

46
00:01:56,604 --> 00:01:58,284
Talk to me.

47
00:01:59,564 --> 00:02:01,124
Maybe I've found him...

48
00:02:02,204 --> 00:02:04,164
...Arthur,
the man I can't defeat.

49
00:02:07,804 --> 00:02:09,844
- Mosley.
- I don't know.

50
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,244
I don't fucking know.

51
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:14,204
Doesn't make sense.

52
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:20,964
Let's...

53
00:02:21,084 --> 00:02:22,404
Let's go inside.

54
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:27,644
We'll work it out, have a drink.

55
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:28,924
I need to walk.

56
00:03:12,644 --> 00:03:14,484
The work's all done, Tommy.

57
00:03:14,604 --> 00:03:16,164
It's all done.

58
00:03:16,284 --> 00:03:18,484
We can walk away
from all of this.

59
00:03:20,084 --> 00:03:23,204
It's so easy. It's so soft.

60
00:03:23,324 --> 00:03:25,004
Such a small change.

61
00:04:02,764 --> 00:04:04,844
Arthur took the bullets out.

62
00:04:05,884 --> 00:04:07,004
On the way back.

63
00:04:08,524 --> 00:04:10,924
He said you stopped
at a crossroads to throw up.

64
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:23,084
You're not even a soldier
any more, Tommy.

65
00:04:24,324 --> 00:04:25,804
You didn't check your weapon.

66
00:04:27,284 --> 00:04:29,884
You're not a soldier,
you're a coward.

67
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:32,164
I heard you pull the trigger.

68
00:04:33,644 --> 00:04:36,084
Leaving your family behind
without a goodbye...

69
00:04:39,324 --> 00:04:41,004
If you still need a way out...

70
00:04:42,924 --> 00:04:44,444
...here are six of them.

71
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:50,124
Mother.

72
00:05:53,084 --> 00:05:54,764
They let you pass through.

73
00:06:00,644 --> 00:06:02,244
They wouldn't let me pass.

74
00:06:08,044 --> 00:06:10,204
As if there were to be
another consequence.

75
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:05,364
Hello?

76
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:06,820
<i>Mr Shelby, I imagine
you're curious</i>

77
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:10,204
<i>as to who it was prevented
the assassination last night.</i>

78
00:07:11,284 --> 00:07:14,364
If you look out your window,
you'll see a flag of truce.

79
00:07:14,484 --> 00:07:16,804
<i>It's a unit of Volunteers</i>

80
00:07:16,924 --> 00:07:19,804
<i>bringing the bodies
of your dead to you,</i>

81
00:07:19,924 --> 00:07:21,924
<i>to send to heaven
in your own way.</i>

82
00:07:23,764 --> 00:07:24,964
<i>Last night's operation</i>

83
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:27,564
<i>was carried out by soldiers
from three Dublin brigades</i>

84
00:07:27,684 --> 00:07:29,084
<i>of the Irish Republican Army.</i>

85
00:07:33,404 --> 00:07:36,844
<i>We need to keep Mr Mosley alive.</i>

86
00:07:36,964 --> 00:07:39,924
That's all you need to know.

87
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,724
<i>Also, you should know
that saving Mosley's life</i>

88
00:07:46,844 --> 00:07:49,164
<i>wasn't our only intervention
last night.</i>

89
00:07:52,884 --> 00:07:53,964
We've made some changes

90
00:07:54,084 --> 00:07:56,004
to the structure
of your organisation.

91
00:08:20,244 --> 00:08:23,364
Ever since you began
to build your empire...

92
00:08:25,324 --> 00:08:27,284
...you've had a crutch
to lean on.

93
00:08:30,004 --> 00:08:32,124
Last night, we kicked
away that crutch.

94
00:08:33,204 --> 00:08:36,244
<i>From now on, it will be us
that you lean on.</i>

95
00:08:37,764 --> 00:08:39,244
<i>Please be aware, Mr Shelby,</i>

96
00:08:39,364 --> 00:08:41,084
that the deaths
of your people...

97
00:08:42,404 --> 00:08:44,564
<i>...are your own
responsibility...</i>

98
00:08:45,644 --> 00:08:48,684
...because you consistently fail
to understand

99
00:08:48,804 --> 00:08:50,324
your own limitations.

100
00:11:24,764 --> 00:11:25,844
Mum...

101
00:11:29,324 --> 00:11:30,924
...it was the ambitions
and strategies

102
00:11:31,044 --> 00:11:32,404
of one man that caused this.

103
00:11:36,524 --> 00:11:38,444
And I swear in the name
of Almighty God...

104
00:11:40,084 --> 00:11:41,804
...no matter what it takes,

105
00:11:41,924 --> 00:11:44,044
no matter how many lies
I have to tell...

106
00:11:47,764 --> 00:11:49,644
...I will take revenge on
Tommy Shelby.

107
00:14:08,644 --> 00:14:10,644
Monsieur.

108
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,404
Monsieur!

109
00:16:29,924 --> 00:16:31,164
J'arrive.

110
00:17:04,684 --> 00:17:05,884
You want a drink?

111
00:17:08,844 --> 00:17:10,844
I'll have a glass of water,
please.

112
00:17:28,684 --> 00:17:29,684
Windows got broke

113
00:17:29,804 --> 00:17:33,204
because a lot of people here
are drunk and angry.

114
00:17:35,484 --> 00:17:36,484
You know?

115
00:17:37,564 --> 00:17:39,804
Half the men on this island
made their living

116
00:17:39,924 --> 00:17:41,924
bootlegging till today.

117
00:17:42,044 --> 00:17:44,004
The other half
fixed their boats.

118
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,564
Maybe you should take
your water into the hall.

119
00:18:43,004 --> 00:18:45,324
Yeah, I learned
a lot of things in France.

120
00:18:51,524 --> 00:18:54,884
Island is crawling with
you fucking commissary men.

121
00:18:57,764 --> 00:19:00,444
Closing our warehouses down.

122
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,484
Throwing men out of work.

123
00:19:10,644 --> 00:19:12,564
Ten years our boat ran whiskey

124
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,164
down the President Roads
to Boston.

125
00:19:16,324 --> 00:19:18,684
Now we have fucking nothing.

126
00:19:21,964 --> 00:19:25,124
And you sit in front of us
and order fucking water.

127
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:27,764
Is that meant to be a joke?

128
00:19:27,884 --> 00:19:28,884
No.

129
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:32,164
I ordered water

130
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:34,684
because I no longer
drink alcohol...

131
00:19:34,804 --> 00:19:36,524
...of any kind.

132
00:19:40,924 --> 00:19:41,924
You, my friend...

133
00:19:44,004 --> 00:19:46,524
...are going to drink a toast.

134
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,924
You will raise your glass to
the poor people of Miquelon,

135
00:19:50,044 --> 00:19:52,884
whose lives you bastards
have destroyed.

136
00:19:53,004 --> 00:19:54,924
Drink it.

137
00:19:55,044 --> 00:19:56,044
Hey.

138
00:19:58,124 --> 00:19:59,284
Drink.

139
00:20:01,124 --> 00:20:03,284
You're not leaving this bar

140
00:20:03,404 --> 00:20:06,204
until you have raised a toast
to the people of Miquelon.

141
00:20:09,884 --> 00:20:10,924
OK.

142
00:20:14,324 --> 00:20:15,444
OK.

143
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:22,524
I understand that,
today of all days,

144
00:20:22,644 --> 00:20:24,004
you would be angry.

145
00:20:26,364 --> 00:20:29,164
But if you'd have read my card
instead of burning it,

146
00:20:29,284 --> 00:20:30,804
you would realise

147
00:20:30,924 --> 00:20:33,644
that this is a misunderstanding.

148
00:20:33,764 --> 00:20:37,324
Now, I've been very patient,
given the circumstances,

149
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:41,044
but you need to sit down
and let me read my newspaper.

150
00:20:46,684 --> 00:20:47,924
Il est bon, lui, hein?

151
00:20:56,524 --> 00:20:59,204
Before this goes any further,
please let me explain.

152
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,684
I will not drink your toast,

153
00:21:00,804 --> 00:21:02,884
cos four years ago,
I forswore alcohol.

154
00:21:03,004 --> 00:21:04,004
Putain.

155
00:21:05,204 --> 00:21:06,204
No.

156
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,324
Don't.

157
00:21:12,244 --> 00:21:14,284
Since I forswore alcohol,

158
00:21:14,404 --> 00:21:16,444
I've become a calmer
and more peaceful person.

159
00:21:21,524 --> 00:21:23,284
Get in.

160
00:21:27,804 --> 00:21:29,644
Sometimes,

161
00:21:29,764 --> 00:21:31,804
in moments
of personal conflict...

162
00:21:33,044 --> 00:21:35,364
...I can resort to my old ways.

163
00:21:35,484 --> 00:21:37,044
If this were to happen now,

164
00:21:37,164 --> 00:21:40,444
it would indeed be a black day
in Miquelon.

165
00:21:42,324 --> 00:21:44,964
Now, my guests
will be arriving shortly.

166
00:21:45,084 --> 00:21:46,484
I need to prepare the room.

167
00:21:46,604 --> 00:21:47,844
Can you show me where?

168
00:21:59,124 --> 00:22:02,524
Excusez-moi.
Où est I'Hôtel Robert?

169
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:10,084
They think we're distillery men
here to take our whiskey back.

170
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:13,084
We're late. He's always early.
Let's go.

171
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:16,124
<i>There will be a war,
and one of you will die.</i>

172
00:23:16,244 --> 00:23:18,724
<i>But which one, I cannot tell.</i>

173
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,284
Hello, Tommy.

174
00:23:40,004 --> 00:23:42,604
There's a man out there having
his face stitched back up.

175
00:23:42,724 --> 00:23:44,124
That was a misunderstanding.

176
00:23:44,244 --> 00:23:45,444
Hello, Michael.

177
00:23:51,324 --> 00:23:53,484
I wasn't sure what I'd think
when I saw you again, Tom.

178
00:23:53,604 --> 00:23:55,444
Oh, yeah?

179
00:23:55,564 --> 00:23:57,044
What do you think?

180
00:23:57,164 --> 00:24:00,644
Since my mother
passed away four years ago,

181
00:24:00,764 --> 00:24:02,204
Tommy and I haven't even spoken.

182
00:24:02,324 --> 00:24:05,604
Well, we've both been very busy.

183
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:08,964
You've been too busy to punish
the people who killed her.

184
00:24:09,084 --> 00:24:10,084
You know, Michael,

185
00:24:10,204 --> 00:24:12,924
when you're dealing
with a very powerful enemy,

186
00:24:13,044 --> 00:24:15,204
taking revenge
sometimes requires time.

187
00:24:16,364 --> 00:24:18,004
You have to...

188
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:19,444
...pick your moment.

189
00:24:20,804 --> 00:24:22,044
That moment will come.

190
00:24:29,244 --> 00:24:32,084
But now we have
a business interest in common,

191
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,764
and any bad blood will be
diluted by time

192
00:24:34,884 --> 00:24:36,684
and a practical self-interest.

193
00:24:39,084 --> 00:24:42,404
Well, Tommy, we're all keen
to hear what you have to say.

194
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:43,684
I'm very much looking forward

195
00:24:43,764 --> 00:24:46,004
to working with you again,
Michael. You look very well.

196
00:24:46,124 --> 00:24:47,404
You too.

197
00:24:48,884 --> 00:24:50,684
How is the family?

198
00:24:51,044 --> 00:24:52,044
Yeee-haaaw!

199
00:25:02,924 --> 00:25:07,924
This projector is a gift
from Charlie fucking Chaplin,

200
00:25:08,044 --> 00:25:09,804
and he sent it all
the way from Hollywood.

201
00:25:09,924 --> 00:25:11,604
Now sit down and watch the film.

202
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:13,444
Oh, God. No.
Elizabeth, Elizabeth,

203
00:25:13,564 --> 00:25:15,804
don't do that,
you're going to hurt yourself.

204
00:25:15,924 --> 00:25:17,924
Yes, hi.
Is that the Bell Tavern?

205
00:25:18,044 --> 00:25:20,524
If there's a Gypsy in there
called Johnny Dogs,

206
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,484
can you tell him to come
and round up his fucking kids?

207
00:25:23,604 --> 00:25:25,804
It's Christmas.
A time for family.

208
00:25:31,484 --> 00:25:33,404
Mum, I was watching that.

209
00:25:34,924 --> 00:25:37,364
OK, everyone, OK.

210
00:25:38,844 --> 00:25:39,844
When's he coming?

211
00:25:39,884 --> 00:25:42,484
We're having
this Christmas party early

212
00:25:42,604 --> 00:25:44,204
because tomorrow,

213
00:25:44,324 --> 00:25:47,124
me and Charles and Ruby
are going on a big ship

214
00:25:47,244 --> 00:25:50,244
to Canada,
to be with their daddy.

215
00:25:50,364 --> 00:25:52,884
But we told Father Christmas
about the party...

216
00:25:54,164 --> 00:25:55,420
...and he brought
you all presents!

217
00:25:55,444 --> 00:25:56,684
- Oh!
- Yes!

218
00:25:58,764 --> 00:25:59,764
Race you!

219
00:25:59,844 --> 00:26:02,124
Ada, where the fuck
is Father Christmas?

220
00:26:02,244 --> 00:26:03,244
I don't know.

221
00:26:03,324 --> 00:26:04,644
He was supposed to be here
by now.

222
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:05,764
Yeah.

223
00:26:05,804 --> 00:26:07,524
Where the fuck are you, Santa?

224
00:26:13,444 --> 00:26:15,164
Ohhh! Ohhh!

225
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:16,644
Ugh!

226
00:26:16,764 --> 00:26:18,564
No!

227
00:26:18,684 --> 00:26:20,244
Ugh!

228
00:26:20,364 --> 00:26:21,764
You've got me!

229
00:26:22,764 --> 00:26:25,524
I've got a gun.
You'd better run!

230
00:26:26,684 --> 00:26:28,484
You'd better run!

231
00:26:28,604 --> 00:26:32,604
Gentlemen, today is
the last day of Prohibition.

232
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,604
But rather than see it
as the end of something,

233
00:26:34,724 --> 00:26:36,324
I believe that, for men like us,

234
00:26:36,444 --> 00:26:37,884
it can present...

235
00:26:38,004 --> 00:26:39,364
...a new beginning.

236
00:26:39,484 --> 00:26:40,844
A new opportunity.

237
00:26:40,964 --> 00:26:43,284
An opportunity
I would like to share

238
00:26:43,404 --> 00:26:44,964
with people I know I can trust.

239
00:26:46,044 --> 00:26:47,564
For the last 12 years,

240
00:26:47,684 --> 00:26:49,084
the men of this island

241
00:26:49,204 --> 00:26:51,524
have been making their living
from bootlegging whiskey,

242
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:54,204
from navigating the waters

243
00:26:54,324 --> 00:26:56,524
and avoiding
American border patrols.

244
00:26:56,644 --> 00:26:59,724
But now that whiskey is
about to become legal,

245
00:26:59,844 --> 00:27:02,124
the trade will fall
back into the hands

246
00:27:02,244 --> 00:27:05,884
of capitalists from New York,
Boston and Toronto.

247
00:27:06,004 --> 00:27:07,084
But...

248
00:27:08,684 --> 00:27:10,844
...when one door closes...

249
00:27:12,604 --> 00:27:14,364
...another one opens.

250
00:27:14,484 --> 00:27:16,244
We can take advantage
of the systems

251
00:27:16,364 --> 00:27:18,124
that are in place
on Miquelon Island

252
00:27:18,244 --> 00:27:19,604
and offer selected boat crews

253
00:27:19,724 --> 00:27:21,124
the opportunity
to carry on working.

254
00:27:21,204 --> 00:27:23,764
But this time
with a different cargo.

255
00:27:39,364 --> 00:27:40,844
You want me to pour?

256
00:27:40,964 --> 00:27:42,284
No.

257
00:27:49,004 --> 00:27:51,644
Now it's all over
the fucking island.

258
00:27:51,764 --> 00:27:54,124
This is an island with
no morals and no opinions -

259
00:27:54,244 --> 00:27:55,564
just a load of fucking boats

260
00:27:55,684 --> 00:27:57,564
with nothing to carry
and nowhere to go.

261
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:00,524
The reason why Miquelon
was used to run whiskey

262
00:28:00,644 --> 00:28:01,644
in the first place

263
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:03,500
is cos it sits outside
the territorial waters

264
00:28:03,524 --> 00:28:06,764
of both America and Canada.

265
00:28:06,884 --> 00:28:09,004
Technically,
it's French territory.

266
00:28:09,124 --> 00:28:12,204
The FBI, the RCMP
have no jurisdiction.

267
00:28:15,164 --> 00:28:17,004
Where do you get this stuff?

268
00:28:17,124 --> 00:28:18,324
I have established

269
00:28:18,444 --> 00:28:20,084
a supply chain
over the last four years

270
00:28:20,204 --> 00:28:22,644
with associates in Belfast.

271
00:28:22,764 --> 00:28:26,324
We decided it was time to
break into the American market.

272
00:28:26,444 --> 00:28:27,844
That, my friend,

273
00:28:27,964 --> 00:28:30,324
is the finest opium
in the world.

274
00:28:31,564 --> 00:28:33,164
Delivered to my warehouse
in Liverpool

275
00:28:33,284 --> 00:28:35,724
directly from Shanghai.

276
00:28:36,804 --> 00:28:38,164
Michael...

277
00:28:38,284 --> 00:28:40,804
When it comes to this shit,
you're the expert.

278
00:28:40,924 --> 00:28:42,084
I trust him.

279
00:28:43,364 --> 00:28:45,164
What about the French police?

280
00:28:45,284 --> 00:28:46,684
I have been in communication

281
00:28:46,804 --> 00:28:48,844
with the Miquelon Prefect
des Gendarmes.

282
00:28:48,964 --> 00:28:50,964
We fought in two of the
same battles in France.

283
00:28:52,484 --> 00:28:54,204
We consider each other comrades.

284
00:28:54,324 --> 00:28:57,764
I have offered my comrade
12 million francs

285
00:28:57,884 --> 00:29:01,404
if the boats between Miquelon
and Boston keep running.

286
00:29:01,524 --> 00:29:04,364
We will have to take
your proposal

287
00:29:04,484 --> 00:29:06,844
to Uncle Jack in Boston.

288
00:29:06,964 --> 00:29:08,164
Perhaps we can meet

289
00:29:08,284 --> 00:29:09,980
after you've spoken
with Uncle Jack, Michael,

290
00:29:10,004 --> 00:29:11,884
who I believe
is your wife's uncle,

291
00:29:12,004 --> 00:29:13,044
Jack Nelson.

292
00:29:13,164 --> 00:29:15,804
Hey!

293
00:29:15,924 --> 00:29:18,804
The guy knows things
that can get him killed,

294
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,884
and he says them out loud.

295
00:29:21,004 --> 00:29:23,284
I have a high regard
for Mr Nelson.

296
00:29:24,604 --> 00:29:26,364
He has a history
not unlike my own.

297
00:29:26,484 --> 00:29:28,444
Jack Nelson's past is forgotten.

298
00:29:28,564 --> 00:29:31,204
Not forgotten. Fucking gone.

299
00:29:31,324 --> 00:29:32,324
No, not gone,

300
00:29:32,364 --> 00:29:34,444
just erased from the records,
like my own.

301
00:29:36,404 --> 00:29:38,044
Give him my regards, will ya?

302
00:29:46,804 --> 00:29:48,564
You haven't touched your drink,
Tom.

303
00:29:53,884 --> 00:29:56,044
You know, since we last met,
Michael...

304
00:29:58,084 --> 00:29:59,764
...well, I've become
a better man.

305
00:30:01,844 --> 00:30:03,644
I now realise that whiskey
is just fuel

306
00:30:03,764 --> 00:30:05,524
for the loud engines
inside your head.

307
00:30:07,044 --> 00:30:08,924
Catch yourself on!

308
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,404
What is this guy,
a fuckin' poet? Eh?

309
00:30:14,524 --> 00:30:17,524
Oh, I do read poetry,
but I don't yet write it.

310
00:30:19,604 --> 00:30:23,004
They say the fog
is going to get worse.

311
00:30:23,124 --> 00:30:25,404
We'd better get off this island
before it traps us here.

312
00:30:28,204 --> 00:30:29,964
Just understand -

313
00:30:30,084 --> 00:30:33,324
Uncle Jack decides everything,
OK?

314
00:30:33,444 --> 00:30:36,844
And I decide
when a meeting is over.

315
00:30:36,964 --> 00:30:38,804
So sit down till I say.

316
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:00,644
Maith fear.

317
00:31:05,524 --> 00:31:07,844
Put some fuckin' hair
on your chest, huh?

318
00:31:15,324 --> 00:31:16,324
Good boy.

319
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:23,924
Now, give us all a poem
before we go.

320
00:31:25,924 --> 00:31:27,884
Want to hear a poem?

321
00:31:31,004 --> 00:31:32,244
Want to hear a poem?

322
00:31:35,364 --> 00:31:38,644
What about you, Brainbox?

323
00:31:52,404 --> 00:31:54,124
I was angry with my friend

324
00:31:54,244 --> 00:31:55,924
I told my wrath

325
00:31:56,044 --> 00:31:58,044
My wrath did end

326
00:32:01,564 --> 00:32:03,244
I was angry with my foe

327
00:32:04,404 --> 00:32:05,684
I told it not

328
00:32:08,004 --> 00:32:10,084
My wrath did grow.

329
00:32:18,644 --> 00:32:22,484
It's from <i>The Poison Tree</i>
by William Blake.

330
00:32:22,604 --> 00:32:23,844
You won't have heard of him.

331
00:32:26,684 --> 00:32:28,284
Meeting over.

332
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,644
Oh, and by the way,

333
00:32:30,764 --> 00:32:33,364
my friend,
the Police Commissioner,

334
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:37,564
told me that he'd spoken to
his FBI liaison officer,

335
00:32:37,684 --> 00:32:40,004
and he told him

336
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,724
that there is an informant

337
00:32:41,844 --> 00:32:43,764
in your organisation
in South Boston.

338
00:32:43,884 --> 00:32:46,084
I tell you this

339
00:32:46,204 --> 00:32:48,124
in the spirit
of corporate hygiene.

340
00:32:49,164 --> 00:32:50,604
Here you are, Michael.

341
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:59,004
Beware the man
with a bleeding heart tattoo...

342
00:33:00,084 --> 00:33:01,924
...with "Maria" written in red.

343
00:33:05,604 --> 00:33:06,924
Have a good day, gentlemen.

344
00:33:30,804 --> 00:33:32,644
This time, don't burn it.

345
00:33:57,364 --> 00:33:58,684
Arthur...

346
00:34:08,764 --> 00:34:10,284
Come on, come on.

347
00:34:10,404 --> 00:34:11,404
God.

348
00:34:12,724 --> 00:34:14,204
Oh, God,
if Polly was still here,

349
00:34:14,324 --> 00:34:16,204
she'd never have let it
get this bad.

350
00:34:16,324 --> 00:34:18,924
Come on. Come on, Arthur.

351
00:34:19,044 --> 00:34:20,804
Arthur!

352
00:34:20,924 --> 00:34:22,004
I am not Polly,

353
00:34:22,124 --> 00:34:24,284
but I am still
your fucking sister.

354
00:34:24,404 --> 00:34:26,564
You swore to me
you would stop using.

355
00:34:28,284 --> 00:34:31,124
It's Christmas Day, Ada.
Christmas Day.

356
00:34:31,244 --> 00:34:32,844
Yes, it's Christmas.

357
00:34:32,964 --> 00:34:35,044
So where the fuck
are the fucking presents?

358
00:34:36,124 --> 00:34:37,524
I'll be all right in a bit...

359
00:34:40,164 --> 00:34:41,524
Great.

360
00:34:41,644 --> 00:34:43,964
My brother off his face on junk.

361
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:45,764
Every day,

362
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:47,684
there's a question
without an answer.

363
00:34:49,244 --> 00:34:50,644
A leak without a bucket.

364
00:34:52,204 --> 00:34:54,084
Me without a clue what to do.

365
00:34:56,964 --> 00:34:58,084
Fuck.

366
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:02,404
I love you, Ada.

367
00:35:07,484 --> 00:35:09,804
Children!
Father Christmas has been!

368
00:35:09,924 --> 00:35:11,404
Father Christmas!

369
00:35:14,044 --> 00:35:15,164
What did you ask for?

370
00:35:16,244 --> 00:35:17,684
What have we got?

371
00:35:17,804 --> 00:35:20,404
Father Christmas got stuck up
the chimney again, did he?

372
00:35:20,524 --> 00:35:22,044
Mm.

373
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:24,204
What ship are you on tomorrow?

374
00:35:24,324 --> 00:35:28,724
Oh, the best,
the most expensive one.

375
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:30,564
And then we'll get there,

376
00:35:30,684 --> 00:35:32,084
and Tommy will say,

377
00:35:32,204 --> 00:35:33,444
"Hello, Lizzie.

378
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:36,044
"Hello, children,"
in that dead voice.

379
00:35:36,164 --> 00:35:39,604
Come on, Lizzie,
he'll be on holiday.

380
00:35:39,724 --> 00:35:41,884
Being away might change him.

381
00:35:43,404 --> 00:35:45,644
Even on holiday, Ada,

382
00:35:45,764 --> 00:35:47,244
even on top of a rocky mountain,

383
00:35:47,364 --> 00:35:49,524
he'll be the same way
he's been since Polly died.

384
00:35:50,884 --> 00:35:51,964
No more Polly...

385
00:35:53,044 --> 00:35:54,684
...no more whiskey,

386
00:35:54,804 --> 00:35:56,004
no more Tommy.

387
00:36:24,844 --> 00:36:26,524
Yeah, I'm calling
from Miquelon Island,

388
00:36:26,644 --> 00:36:28,844
from the police station.

389
00:36:28,964 --> 00:36:30,724
There is a boat leaving
the island now,

390
00:36:30,844 --> 00:36:32,964
heading across the border.

391
00:36:33,084 --> 00:36:35,404
When it docks at St John's,

392
00:36:35,524 --> 00:36:39,204
a man named Michael Gray
will board a ferry to Boston.

393
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:41,284
Listen very carefully.

394
00:36:41,404 --> 00:36:44,444
He's wearing a dark coat,
a blue suit

395
00:36:44,564 --> 00:36:46,564
and carrying a black briefcase.

396
00:36:46,684 --> 00:36:48,044
Inside the briefcase

397
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:51,324
is five pound
of pure, refined opium.

398
00:36:52,804 --> 00:36:53,964
Concerned citizen.

399
00:36:55,324 --> 00:36:57,084
Yeah, my name is Mr Jones.

400
00:37:06,804 --> 00:37:08,084
Yes, I do.

401
00:37:09,884 --> 00:37:11,444
But I don't drink any more.

402
00:37:21,564 --> 00:37:23,204
I have business.

403
00:37:24,444 --> 00:37:25,804
I need to get off this island.

404
00:37:29,724 --> 00:37:32,324
You shouldn't be in here, Karl.

405
00:37:42,004 --> 00:37:43,644
Are you going to answer it?

406
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:45,964
No, I don't work for him
any more.

407
00:37:49,964 --> 00:37:51,924
It might be important.

408
00:37:52,044 --> 00:37:54,244
That's why I don't
want to answer it.

409
00:37:57,044 --> 00:37:58,124
Can I answer it?

410
00:37:58,244 --> 00:37:59,404
No.

411
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:08,484
Hello?

412
00:38:09,684 --> 00:38:10,684
Mm-hm.

413
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:13,684
Fuck.

414
00:38:46,804 --> 00:38:48,644
Do you know who this man is?

415
00:39:02,404 --> 00:39:04,404
All right, come on, Arthur.

416
00:39:09,604 --> 00:39:10,724
Hiya...

417
00:39:17,364 --> 00:39:19,044
Hey, that tickles.

418
00:39:25,004 --> 00:39:26,964
His brother, Thomas Shelby,

419
00:39:27,084 --> 00:39:30,084
says don't serve him opium
ever again,

420
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:31,204
or someone will write

421
00:39:31,324 --> 00:39:32,964
Arthur Shelby's name
on your chest

422
00:39:33,084 --> 00:39:34,404
with a bayonet.

423
00:40:25,684 --> 00:40:27,964
So... what the fuck?

424
00:40:28,084 --> 00:40:30,684
I can't talk about anything
in here.

425
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:33,564
I just wanted to see your face
and smell your perfume.

426
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:36,084
Tommy Shelby steps back
into your life and, right away,

427
00:40:36,204 --> 00:40:37,324
this is what happens?

428
00:40:37,444 --> 00:40:38,924
No names in here.

429
00:40:39,044 --> 00:40:42,204
Sorry. Let's just call him
the devil.

430
00:40:42,324 --> 00:40:43,324
Take a seat.

431
00:40:46,204 --> 00:40:47,764
How is Laurence?

432
00:40:47,884 --> 00:40:51,644
Oh, you know.
Missing his father.

433
00:40:51,764 --> 00:40:54,604
What the fuck happened, Michael?

434
00:40:54,724 --> 00:40:56,644
- It's in hand.
- Whose hand?

435
00:40:58,084 --> 00:40:59,484
No, really.

436
00:40:59,604 --> 00:41:02,404
Whose fucking hand, Michael?
Hmm?

437
00:41:10,404 --> 00:41:11,844
Like everything else
in this city,

438
00:41:11,964 --> 00:41:14,244
it's in the hand
of your Uncle Jack.

439
00:41:14,364 --> 00:41:17,124
I need him to get the charges
lifted and get me out of here.

440
00:41:17,244 --> 00:41:18,844
I already talked to him.

441
00:41:18,964 --> 00:41:21,284
He told me
what the devil proposed.

442
00:41:22,404 --> 00:41:25,524
Tommy Shelby wants to do
business with Jack Nelson?

443
00:41:25,644 --> 00:41:28,004
He wants to take on Boston?

444
00:41:28,124 --> 00:41:30,164
No-one is taking on anyone.

445
00:41:30,284 --> 00:41:32,124
It's in hand.

446
00:41:32,244 --> 00:41:34,284
There are deals being made
at a high level,

447
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:35,980
but there are some people
at the middle level

448
00:41:36,004 --> 00:41:37,460
and lower levels
who cannot be trusted.

449
00:41:37,484 --> 00:41:38,484
Michael,

450
00:41:38,524 --> 00:41:40,324
- this sounds fucking...
- Shut up and listen.

451
00:41:42,084 --> 00:41:44,844
It was Tommy himself
who warned us of the informant.

452
00:41:44,964 --> 00:41:46,484
We're guessing
that the informant

453
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,764
was the one that tipped off
the police about me.

454
00:41:50,364 --> 00:41:52,844
Then the devil's plan
has already begun.

455
00:41:52,964 --> 00:41:54,724
What's the point
of ships and planes

456
00:41:54,844 --> 00:41:56,684
if you can't get away?

457
00:41:56,804 --> 00:41:59,844
Gina, in today's paper,
you will read about a man

458
00:41:59,964 --> 00:42:01,444
being fished out
of the Boston Harbour

459
00:42:01,524 --> 00:42:02,804
with a bleeding heart tattoo

460
00:42:02,924 --> 00:42:04,604
and the name "Maria"
written on his arm.

461
00:42:04,724 --> 00:42:06,324
Single shot to the head.

462
00:42:06,444 --> 00:42:08,644
Yeah, I know, I read it already.

463
00:42:10,484 --> 00:42:13,124
His death will lead to others.

464
00:42:13,244 --> 00:42:16,964
For this business to work,
we must only use men we trust.

465
00:42:17,084 --> 00:42:20,084
And while the clean-up
is being carried out,

466
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,124
you must keep things
to yourself.

467
00:42:22,244 --> 00:42:25,444
You talk loose to anyone,
it'll be me in the harbour

468
00:42:25,564 --> 00:42:27,300
and you'll be the Maria
with the bleeding heart.

469
00:42:27,324 --> 00:42:28,764
Do you understand?

470
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:36,004
Michael, I just want the truth.

471
00:42:38,924 --> 00:42:40,604
No, fuck that -
I <i>need</i> the truth!

472
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,220
Why are you doing business
with him again?

473
00:42:42,244 --> 00:42:44,884
Gina,
tell me what you're thinking

474
00:42:45,004 --> 00:42:46,404
of getting Laurence
for Christmas.

475
00:42:46,524 --> 00:42:48,844
There are plenty of men
who can supply powder

476
00:42:48,964 --> 00:42:50,260
all over the world -
I don't understand

477
00:42:50,284 --> 00:42:51,444
why it needs to be <i>him.</i>

478
00:43:00,484 --> 00:43:01,604
Some of my business

479
00:43:01,724 --> 00:43:03,404
with Tommy Shelby is unfinished.

480
00:43:04,684 --> 00:43:07,084
This is my opportunity
to finish it.

481
00:43:10,844 --> 00:43:13,084
So speak to your uncle and
get me the fuck out of here.

482
00:43:28,764 --> 00:43:30,884
Oh!

483
00:43:34,084 --> 00:43:35,084
Hello?

484
00:43:36,164 --> 00:43:37,164
Who?

485
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:40,764
Sure.

486
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:42,444
Why the hell not?

487
00:44:00,324 --> 00:44:04,204
I heard you were in town
and I thought, "Well, hey."

488
00:44:06,404 --> 00:44:08,684
Little man hitting the big time.

489
00:44:08,804 --> 00:44:09,884
You like jazz?

490
00:44:10,004 --> 00:44:11,364
No.

491
00:44:17,164 --> 00:44:18,564
What do you want? Whiskey?

492
00:44:18,684 --> 00:44:19,884
Water.

493
00:44:20,004 --> 00:44:22,924
I don't have any water.
What else do you want?

494
00:44:23,044 --> 00:44:26,924
I have a message
for your Uncle Jack.

495
00:44:27,044 --> 00:44:28,884
Tommy, relax.

496
00:44:31,484 --> 00:44:32,644
Have a fucking drink.

497
00:44:34,404 --> 00:44:35,604
You know my uncle's planning

498
00:44:35,724 --> 00:44:37,684
on buying the
United States import licence

499
00:44:37,804 --> 00:44:41,004
to all the best Scotch
and Irish whiskey distilleries.

500
00:44:43,364 --> 00:44:45,924
He's on his way to London
right now to make those deals.

501
00:44:46,044 --> 00:44:47,764
Every drop in every state

502
00:44:47,884 --> 00:44:49,924
will be another dime
for Uncle Jack.

503
00:44:50,044 --> 00:44:51,404
Yeah.

504
00:44:51,524 --> 00:44:54,284
He's a very powerful,
very impressive man.

505
00:44:55,364 --> 00:44:57,044
I've only seen photographs -

506
00:44:57,164 --> 00:44:59,324
when he was young,
police mug shots,

507
00:44:59,444 --> 00:45:02,604
and, more recently,
in high-society magazines.

508
00:45:02,724 --> 00:45:05,164
I think
this represents progress.

509
00:45:05,284 --> 00:45:06,284
Yeah.

510
00:45:07,964 --> 00:45:11,204
And before you tell me
what you want me to tell him,

511
00:45:11,324 --> 00:45:13,244
I have a message
from him to you.

512
00:45:14,844 --> 00:45:15,844
No deal.

513
00:45:19,124 --> 00:45:20,404
Hmm.

514
00:45:22,964 --> 00:45:25,684
In England, when someone gets
this close to Tommy Shelby,

515
00:45:25,804 --> 00:45:27,284
it's, oh, the horror.

516
00:45:29,364 --> 00:45:30,764
Oh, the desire...

517
00:45:32,324 --> 00:45:35,244
...to fall on your knees,
open your mouth and say,

518
00:45:35,364 --> 00:45:36,684
"Yes, sir.

519
00:45:38,044 --> 00:45:39,484
"Please, sir."

520
00:45:43,804 --> 00:45:47,204
So it's Uncle Jack
you fall on your knees for, eh?

521
00:45:47,324 --> 00:45:48,644
Not Michael.

522
00:45:50,644 --> 00:45:53,004
He says no deal, Mr Shelby.

523
00:45:56,484 --> 00:45:58,884
You smell of jail, Gina.

524
00:45:59,004 --> 00:46:01,404
And you drink too much.

525
00:46:02,524 --> 00:46:05,004
Yes, but booze is legal.

526
00:46:05,124 --> 00:46:06,724
Your white powder's not.

527
00:46:08,244 --> 00:46:09,764
Jack has friends
in the government now.

528
00:46:09,804 --> 00:46:11,964
Do you have any idea
how far he's risen?

529
00:46:13,884 --> 00:46:16,724
All the way to the fucking top.

530
00:46:18,524 --> 00:46:20,524
Can't have white powder
on his shiny black boots

531
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:21,644
when he's on his way

532
00:46:21,724 --> 00:46:23,444
to meet the President
of the United States

533
00:46:23,564 --> 00:46:25,524
cos, yeah,

534
00:46:25,644 --> 00:46:27,044
that's where he goes now.

535
00:46:28,844 --> 00:46:31,364
So he can't really be
taking such a big risk

536
00:46:31,484 --> 00:46:32,684
on such a little deal.

537
00:46:34,484 --> 00:46:36,364
Go home, boy.

538
00:46:39,164 --> 00:46:40,804
Bye-bye, Mr Shelby.

539
00:46:43,084 --> 00:46:44,604
Yeah, you have another whiskey,
Gina.

540
00:46:44,724 --> 00:46:46,924
Another dime for Uncle Jack.

541
00:46:47,044 --> 00:46:49,004
You mind if I smoke?

542
00:46:49,124 --> 00:46:50,764
If it's legal, it's OK.

543
00:46:52,964 --> 00:46:54,164
Before I go...

544
00:46:55,644 --> 00:46:57,484
...you should know...

545
00:46:59,324 --> 00:47:00,444
...that it was me

546
00:47:00,564 --> 00:47:03,644
who tipped off the border police

547
00:47:03,764 --> 00:47:05,924
about the contents
of Michael's suitcase.

548
00:47:09,004 --> 00:47:10,924
I'm the reason he's in jail.

549
00:47:14,404 --> 00:47:16,524
I wanted to give your uncle
a dilemma.

550
00:47:18,804 --> 00:47:20,924
His favourite niece's husband...

551
00:47:22,044 --> 00:47:23,404
...banged up in Boston...

552
00:47:24,484 --> 00:47:26,244
...for smuggling opium.

553
00:47:28,244 --> 00:47:29,484
What does he do?

554
00:47:30,524 --> 00:47:32,164
If he intervenes
and has him released,

555
00:47:32,284 --> 00:47:33,740
how will that play
in the Oval Office?

556
00:47:33,764 --> 00:47:35,804
If he does nothing,

557
00:47:35,924 --> 00:47:37,844
how does that play
in South Boston?

558
00:47:37,964 --> 00:47:39,404
Oh, fuck you.

559
00:47:43,724 --> 00:47:45,284
Fine.

560
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:46,604
Stay here.

561
00:47:47,884 --> 00:47:48,884
Deal here.

562
00:47:48,924 --> 00:47:50,924
Die here,
for all I fucking care.

563
00:47:56,324 --> 00:47:58,724
Die at whose hand, Gina? Eh?

564
00:48:01,644 --> 00:48:04,724
My message to your uncle
is this.

565
00:48:06,124 --> 00:48:08,044
If he doesn't want
to buy my opium,

566
00:48:08,164 --> 00:48:10,684
I will sell
to the East Boston Jews.

567
00:48:17,004 --> 00:48:18,404
Oh, baby.

568
00:48:19,604 --> 00:48:22,404
Do you want to start
a fucking war?

569
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:25,084
With that amount of opium,

570
00:48:25,204 --> 00:48:28,524
the balance of power
between the Irish,

571
00:48:28,644 --> 00:48:32,084
the Jewish and the Italians

572
00:48:32,204 --> 00:48:34,884
would shift heavily
in favour of the East.

573
00:48:36,244 --> 00:48:38,004
I have excellent contacts

574
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:40,764
with the family
that runs East Boston.

575
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:42,684
The Solomons family.

576
00:48:42,804 --> 00:48:44,404
Maybe you've heard of 'em?

577
00:48:46,244 --> 00:48:48,764
Once you people have accepted

578
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:51,164
that you must treat us
as equals...

579
00:48:54,764 --> 00:48:57,644
...then I think our families
will work together very well.

580
00:49:00,284 --> 00:49:01,924
Have a good day, Gina.

581
00:49:23,404 --> 00:49:24,524
Yep?

582
00:49:26,604 --> 00:49:28,124
Yes, I'll accept the call.

583
00:49:38,324 --> 00:49:39,964
<i>Hello, Lizzie.</i>

584
00:49:40,084 --> 00:49:41,124
Tommy...

585
00:49:42,684 --> 00:49:44,444
It's Ruby. She's not well.

586
00:49:46,324 --> 00:49:49,484
She's got a temperature of 101.
Doctor's just left.

587
00:49:49,604 --> 00:49:51,204
What did he say?

588
00:49:51,324 --> 00:49:53,364
<i>He says he thinks it's flu,</i>

589
00:49:53,484 --> 00:49:55,444
but he's going to come later
to check on her.

590
00:49:57,364 --> 00:49:59,004
She's been coughing and...

591
00:50:02,684 --> 00:50:06,804
Tommy, he said it's not
a good idea for us to travel.

592
00:50:08,244 --> 00:50:10,284
<i>We can't board that ship
to Boston today.</i>

593
00:50:11,444 --> 00:50:12,924
That's all right, Lizzie,
don't worry.

594
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:15,924
Don't worry, you just stay
there for now

595
00:50:16,044 --> 00:50:17,204
and get her better and, er...

596
00:50:18,124 --> 00:50:20,204
Can I speak to her?

597
00:50:20,324 --> 00:50:22,204
<i>She's sleeping.</i>

598
00:50:22,324 --> 00:50:24,764
Yeah, well, let her sleep.

599
00:50:24,884 --> 00:50:26,084
Let her sleep.

600
00:50:27,764 --> 00:50:30,564
Lizzie, I've a bit more
business to do here.

601
00:50:30,684 --> 00:50:33,964
<i>Look, you just book
a new passage</i>

602
00:50:34,084 --> 00:50:35,324
when Ruby's feeling better.

603
00:50:35,444 --> 00:50:36,820
It doesn't matter if you don't
get here for Christmas,

604
00:50:36,844 --> 00:50:38,100
just as long as you get here,
right?

605
00:50:38,124 --> 00:50:41,804
<i>And then I'll get
this business done,</i>

606
00:50:41,924 --> 00:50:44,644
you get here
with the children...

607
00:50:44,764 --> 00:50:46,124
...and then no more.

608
00:50:47,564 --> 00:50:50,244
And it'll just be us
and the clean air

609
00:50:50,364 --> 00:50:51,724
out in the West.

610
00:50:51,844 --> 00:50:54,204
<i>I've found a place
in the mountains.</i>

611
00:50:54,324 --> 00:50:55,724
<i>There'll be snow.</i>

612
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:58,604
Tell Ruby... Tell Ruby
I'll build her a snowman.

613
00:50:58,724 --> 00:51:00,044
Hmm.

614
00:51:01,964 --> 00:51:03,444
<i>How long has she been coughing?</i>

615
00:51:03,564 --> 00:51:05,084
<i>A few days.</i>

616
00:51:05,204 --> 00:51:07,884
She's been out running wild
with Johnny Dog's kids,

617
00:51:08,004 --> 00:51:09,564
out in the cold by the river.

618
00:51:14,244 --> 00:51:15,644
Are you OK, Tommy?

619
00:51:16,884 --> 00:51:19,124
Your voice, it sounds different.

620
00:51:19,244 --> 00:51:20,724
<i>It's just cold.</i>

621
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:23,204
I'll get this business done
in Boston...

622
00:51:24,324 --> 00:51:26,004
...and that'll be
the end of it.

623
00:51:27,844 --> 00:51:29,204
And then I just want to...

624
00:51:31,364 --> 00:51:32,684
...I just want to pick Ruby up

625
00:51:32,804 --> 00:51:34,364
and hold her in my arms, y'know?

626
00:51:35,684 --> 00:51:37,764
I miss the weight
of carrying her.

627
00:51:37,884 --> 00:51:39,324
<i>I gave her her presents early.</i>

628
00:51:39,444 --> 00:51:41,164
She loves them.

629
00:51:44,044 --> 00:51:46,044
But last night,
she was burning up.

630
00:51:46,164 --> 00:51:47,804
She was delirious.

631
00:51:47,924 --> 00:51:49,364
She kept talking.

632
00:51:49,484 --> 00:51:52,244
Johnny's kids have been
teaching her to speak Gypsy.

633
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:55,884
Teaching her to rob and steal,
more like.

634
00:51:56,004 --> 00:51:57,404
Yeah.

635
00:51:59,404 --> 00:52:00,564
When she was delirious,

636
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:03,364
she kept saying
these Gypsy words, er...

637
00:52:05,524 --> 00:52:09,524
<i>"Tickner maura,
tickner maura, o beng, o beng,"</i>

638
00:52:09,644 --> 00:52:10,844
<i>over and over again.</i>

639
00:52:12,564 --> 00:52:14,244
What? Lizzie, what...?

640
00:52:15,444 --> 00:52:17,764
What did you say?
What did Ruby say?

641
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,684
Tickner, tickner maura.

642
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:21,724
<i>- Something like that.</i>
- Did she say any...

643
00:52:21,844 --> 00:52:24,004
Did she say any other words
that you didn't understand?

644
00:52:26,484 --> 00:52:28,004
"O beng, o beng." I don't know.

645
00:52:28,124 --> 00:52:30,364
No, Lizzie, did she say
any other words in Romany?

646
00:52:30,484 --> 00:52:31,684
Fucking listen to me!

647
00:52:31,804 --> 00:52:33,244
I don't know Romany words,

648
00:52:33,364 --> 00:52:34,764
<i>Tommy. I don't think so.</i>

649
00:52:34,884 --> 00:52:37,244
Just "tickner maura"
and "o beng"?

650
00:52:37,364 --> 00:52:38,204
Yes.

651
00:52:38,324 --> 00:52:40,324
Could she see anything
when she was burning up?

652
00:52:40,444 --> 00:52:42,284
<i>- What could she see?</i>
- Oh, fuck.

653
00:52:42,404 --> 00:52:44,060
Lizzie, please, just answer
the fucking question!

654
00:52:44,084 --> 00:52:46,764
She said she could see a man.

655
00:52:46,884 --> 00:52:48,884
A man with green eyes.

656
00:52:49,004 --> 00:52:50,644
<i>She was delirious.</i>

657
00:52:50,764 --> 00:52:52,444
<i>She was burning up.</i>

658
00:52:52,564 --> 00:52:54,044
What the fuck is the matter?

659
00:52:54,164 --> 00:52:55,204
All right, listen, Lizzie,

660
00:52:55,324 --> 00:52:56,364
- I'm coming home.
<i>- Tommy,</i>

661
00:52:56,404 --> 00:52:57,980
<i>- it's just a fever, love.
- Listen to me.</i>

662
00:52:58,004 --> 00:52:59,900
I'm coming home. I'll be
on the next steamer back.

663
00:52:59,924 --> 00:53:01,420
<i>You keep her out of school.
You hear me?</i>

664
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:02,820
You keep her out of school,
you keep her away from...

665
00:53:02,844 --> 00:53:04,804
- Tommy...
<i>- Keep her away from the river.</i>

666
00:53:04,924 --> 00:53:06,844
<i>Don't let her ride a horse
or go near a horse.</i>

667
00:53:06,964 --> 00:53:08,924
Tell Johnny Dogs and his wives

668
00:53:09,044 --> 00:53:10,724
the words
that Ruby has been saying.

669
00:53:10,844 --> 00:53:12,884
<i>Do you hear me?
Tell Johnny's eldest wife</i>

670
00:53:13,004 --> 00:53:14,964
to put a Black Madonna
around her neck.

671
00:53:15,084 --> 00:53:16,084
You listen to Esmeralda

672
00:53:16,164 --> 00:53:18,044
the same way you listen
to a fucking doctor.

673
00:53:18,164 --> 00:53:19,164
<i>You hear me?</i>

674
00:53:19,204 --> 00:53:20,404
Fucking Gypsy stuff.

675
00:53:20,524 --> 00:53:24,124
Yes, it is Gypsy fucking stuff,
Lizzie! Yes, it fucking is!

676
00:53:24,244 --> 00:53:25,724
<i>And you get Curly there.</i>

677
00:53:25,844 --> 00:53:28,524
<i>Tell him to stay in the stable
with Ruby's horses.</i>

678
00:53:28,644 --> 00:53:29,644
And you do everything

679
00:53:29,724 --> 00:53:31,644
that Johnny Dogs
and his wives fucking tell you.

680
00:53:31,764 --> 00:53:32,844
Do you understand me?

681
00:53:34,084 --> 00:53:36,204
I'm sorry, Lizzie.
Do you understand?

682
00:53:36,324 --> 00:53:38,044
<i>OK!</i>

683
00:53:38,164 --> 00:53:39,764
I'll do it.

684
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:41,164
All right, I'm coming home.

685
00:53:51,764 --> 00:53:53,644
Polly?

686
00:53:55,044 --> 00:53:56,124
Polly?

687
00:53:59,884 --> 00:54:01,444
They know I'm trying to get out.

688
00:54:02,844 --> 00:54:03,924
Pol...

689
00:54:05,324 --> 00:54:06,764
...they're coming for me.

690
00:54:46,764 --> 00:54:48,004
You son of a fucking bitch.

691
00:54:48,124 --> 00:54:49,564
You sound American, Michael.

692
00:54:51,764 --> 00:54:53,060
I have to go back
to England early.

693
00:54:53,084 --> 00:54:54,804
Let's make this quick, eh?

694
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:57,204
You just fuck people up
and you run away.

695
00:54:57,324 --> 00:54:58,500
No, this business will continue.

696
00:54:58,524 --> 00:55:00,644
Jack Nelson is also travelling
to England.

697
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:03,644
To London and to Edinburgh,
to buy import licences.

698
00:55:03,764 --> 00:55:06,204
How the fuck do you know
where Jack Nelson's going?

699
00:55:06,324 --> 00:55:08,484
Well, I have copies
of his itinerary.

700
00:55:08,604 --> 00:55:10,004
Of his personal correspondence.

701
00:55:10,124 --> 00:55:11,860
Letters from the President
of the United States,

702
00:55:11,884 --> 00:55:13,404
and his many mistresses.

703
00:55:13,524 --> 00:55:16,164
I have contacts
in his organisation.

704
00:55:16,284 --> 00:55:20,244
An Irishman with a mortgage is
a powerful resource, Michael.

705
00:55:21,524 --> 00:55:22,724
You're dead, Tommy.

706
00:55:23,844 --> 00:55:25,724
You're out
of your fucking depth.

707
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:28,644
You're dead already.

708
00:55:31,404 --> 00:55:33,804
You threatened
to sell to the Jews.

709
00:55:33,924 --> 00:55:35,684
And I have contacts
in this prison.

710
00:55:35,804 --> 00:55:37,620
These boys here will look
after you during your stay.

711
00:55:37,644 --> 00:55:39,580
I don't need your fucking
people to look after me.

712
00:55:39,604 --> 00:55:41,020
Jack Nelson's getting me
out of here.

713
00:55:41,044 --> 00:55:42,044
Oh, yeah?

714
00:55:42,084 --> 00:55:43,524
Is he?

715
00:55:45,164 --> 00:55:46,164
This is a letter.

716
00:55:46,244 --> 00:55:48,084
Here, give him this letter,
will ya?

717
00:55:48,204 --> 00:55:49,564
This is a letter

718
00:55:49,684 --> 00:55:50,980
from the President's
personal secretary,

719
00:55:51,004 --> 00:55:53,324
suggesting Jack Nelson keep you
in here for a while longer.

720
00:55:53,404 --> 00:55:56,204
Just until the press
lose interest, Michael.

721
00:55:59,804 --> 00:56:00,964
Fuck you.

722
00:56:01,084 --> 00:56:02,764
You'll be released eventually.

723
00:56:02,884 --> 00:56:05,964
And then you can execute
your business with me...

724
00:56:06,084 --> 00:56:07,364
...as before.

725
00:56:08,484 --> 00:56:12,364
Our business being $5 million
for a shipment of powder.

726
00:56:12,484 --> 00:56:15,084
And when the exchange is done,
we can shake hands

727
00:56:15,204 --> 00:56:17,524
and go our separate ways
once more, eh?

728
00:56:21,364 --> 00:56:22,844
So, you didn't learn.

729
00:56:24,924 --> 00:56:27,164
When my mother died
at the hands of your ambition,

730
00:56:27,284 --> 00:56:29,644
you didn't learn
your limitations.

731
00:56:31,364 --> 00:56:33,364
I have no limitations.

732
00:56:38,444 --> 00:56:40,324
Oh, and by the way, Michael...

733
00:56:41,404 --> 00:56:44,004
...according to Jack Nelson's
personal accounts,

734
00:56:44,124 --> 00:56:46,644
he bought passage
for five people

735
00:56:46,764 --> 00:56:48,164
from Boston to Liverpool.

736
00:56:48,284 --> 00:56:51,244
Five people - his wife,
his mistress,

737
00:56:51,364 --> 00:56:54,564
President Roosevelt's son,
himself...

738
00:56:56,284 --> 00:56:57,484
...and Gina Gray.

739
00:56:59,964 --> 00:57:01,564
Gina's coming to London,
Michael...

740
00:57:02,804 --> 00:57:04,580
...where I will be happy
to show her the sights.

741
00:57:04,604 --> 00:57:07,924
Fuck! You fucking bastard,
Tommy!

742
00:57:08,044 --> 00:57:10,004
- Spirits, Boston Irish...
- You're the devil!

743
00:57:10,124 --> 00:57:11,780
- ...and Uncle Jack.
- You're the fucking devil!

744
00:57:11,804 --> 00:57:13,284
I'm ready for the conversation.
