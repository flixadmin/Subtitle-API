1
00:00:01,004 --> 00:00:03,764
My brother sends his
apologies for not being here

2
00:00:03,884 --> 00:00:05,700
and would like to invite
all of you to his home

3
00:00:05,724 --> 00:00:06,924
for a meeting.

4
00:00:07,044 --> 00:00:08,924
All you have to do
is sit with Jack Nelson

5
00:00:09,044 --> 00:00:11,004
and talk to him about
a new golden age.

6
00:00:11,124 --> 00:00:12,660
If anyone's
going to kill Tommy Shelby...

7
00:00:12,684 --> 00:00:15,724
It will be you.
The future belongs to us.

8
00:00:15,844 --> 00:00:17,244
Your daughter has consumption.

9
00:00:17,364 --> 00:00:19,684
Consumption is
a very infectious disease.

10
00:00:19,804 --> 00:00:21,804
<i>While they're X-raying
Ruby, they have to X-ray us.</i>

11
00:00:21,924 --> 00:00:23,724
It'll be the girl's mother
who laid the curse.

12
00:00:23,844 --> 00:00:25,924
<i>Perhaps she waited
till your little girl was seven</i>

13
00:00:26,044 --> 00:00:27,364
<i>so you'd know how it feels.</i>

14
00:00:27,484 --> 00:00:29,884
Now that I'm without whisky,
I can hear the spirits clearly,

15
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:32,364
and they are saying that Ruby
will be well if I make amends.

16
00:00:32,444 --> 00:00:33,524
She's gone, Tommy.

17
00:03:24,724 --> 00:03:26,204
Arthur?

18
00:03:28,884 --> 00:03:30,364
I've written some words.

19
00:03:32,444 --> 00:03:33,804
I can't speak 'em.

20
00:03:35,044 --> 00:03:38,004
You're the oldest.

21
00:03:38,124 --> 00:03:40,644
You speak 'em for me.

22
00:03:48,684 --> 00:03:50,484
I'm sorry, Brother.

23
00:03:50,604 --> 00:03:52,324
I can't do it.

24
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:25,124
We could have afforded
a golden carriage.

25
00:04:29,724 --> 00:04:31,564
She deserved a golden carriage.

26
00:04:36,244 --> 00:04:38,524
But we didn't afford ourselves
that luxury...

27
00:04:42,204 --> 00:04:43,964
...because gold doesn't work.

28
00:04:49,804 --> 00:04:52,324
That was the last lesson
that Ruby taught us.

29
00:05:07,964 --> 00:05:12,884
This place was her favourite
place in the whole world.

30
00:05:13,004 --> 00:05:14,124
And she used to say...

31
00:05:15,724 --> 00:05:16,924
..."Dad...

32
00:05:19,804 --> 00:05:22,924
..."you never know what's
going to come down the river."

33
00:05:24,364 --> 00:05:26,084
And it's true...

34
00:05:27,924 --> 00:05:29,244
...cos little Ruby's fate...

35
00:05:30,284 --> 00:05:32,244
...came a thousand miles
too soon.

36
00:05:36,644 --> 00:05:41,204
But in her name and in her
memory, things will change.

37
00:05:44,124 --> 00:05:47,404
And whatever comes
down that river from now on...

38
00:05:47,524 --> 00:05:49,124
...we will make good...

39
00:05:52,564 --> 00:05:54,844
...we will make peaceful
and honest and good

40
00:05:54,964 --> 00:05:57,164
and send it on down the river
better than it was.

41
00:05:57,284 --> 00:05:59,404
In her memory we will do this.

42
00:06:07,604 --> 00:06:10,724
But for now, we send her on...

43
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:13,804
...to wherever it is you go...

44
00:06:15,964 --> 00:06:18,604
...in the hope that
if there is a destination...

45
00:06:20,844 --> 00:06:22,964
...that it's a yard like this,

46
00:06:23,084 --> 00:06:26,724
with horses
and boats for her to play on.

47
00:06:39,604 --> 00:06:40,684
Tom?

48
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:44,364
I've got the petrol.

49
00:06:44,484 --> 00:06:46,084
Who will light the flame?

50
00:06:51,484 --> 00:06:52,804
Jeremiah?

51
00:06:59,284 --> 00:07:01,924
Jeremiah, you made her laugh.

52
00:07:02,044 --> 00:07:04,204
You light the flame.

53
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:06,524
No, no!

54
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:07,924
- No!
- Lizzie, Lizzie...

55
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:10,724
No, you won't burn her! No!

56
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:12,084
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

57
00:07:15,364 --> 00:07:18,204
I just want to see her.
I just want to see her face.

58
00:07:18,324 --> 00:07:20,004
We'll go and see her together.
Come on.

59
00:07:20,124 --> 00:07:21,524
We'll go and see her together.

60
00:07:21,644 --> 00:07:22,644
Yeah.

61
00:07:34,564 --> 00:07:37,364
Oh, my baby.

62
00:07:56,004 --> 00:07:58,804
The devils who did this
will pay, Ruby.

63
00:08:02,364 --> 00:08:04,084
What do you mean?

64
00:08:07,284 --> 00:08:08,884
What do you mean?

65
00:08:10,124 --> 00:08:12,244
Where are you going, Tommy?

66
00:10:03,844 --> 00:10:07,604
Riley! I think
the police are here.

67
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:11,324
Evadne Barwell?

68
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,524
Yeah. Who's asking?

69
00:10:16,204 --> 00:10:18,004
I am here on behalf
of the blue sapphire.

70
00:10:28,644 --> 00:10:30,684
Don't shoot! There are babies!

71
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:33,204
(BABY CRIES)

72
00:12:59,964 --> 00:13:01,324
Gold dust.

73
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,324
Our business is done, Esme.

74
00:13:04,444 --> 00:13:05,844
Get out of the car.

75
00:13:05,964 --> 00:13:07,164
Not quite done, Tommy.

76
00:13:08,364 --> 00:13:10,204
I thought this would be
a good time.

77
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:12,084
In fact, it's the perfect time.

78
00:13:13,324 --> 00:13:15,444
Some business
is still unfinished.

79
00:13:17,244 --> 00:13:20,564
Christians say, "The Lord
gives, the Lord takes away."

80
00:13:20,684 --> 00:13:22,084
Our spirits are the same.

81
00:13:23,084 --> 00:13:25,084
Spirits just took away
your child.

82
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,284
Get out of the car, Esme.

83
00:13:27,404 --> 00:13:30,004
The same spirits want to give
you a different child, Tommy.

84
00:13:30,124 --> 00:13:33,124
What child?

85
00:13:34,724 --> 00:13:36,284
A daughter lost...

86
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:38,724
...a son found.

87
00:13:41,244 --> 00:13:44,524
Before you went to France, a
long time ago, at Appleby Fair,

88
00:13:44,644 --> 00:13:46,324
you slept with a girl.

89
00:13:46,444 --> 00:13:48,924
Her name was Zelda. I met her.

90
00:13:50,484 --> 00:13:54,164
She said you slept together
under a hazel tree in May 1914.

91
00:13:55,804 --> 00:14:00,324
When she fell pregnant, her
father threatened to kill you,

92
00:14:00,444 --> 00:14:04,324
but you'd already joined the
Army and gone away to France.

93
00:14:07,004 --> 00:14:10,084
You remember the girl and the
hazel tree, don't you, Tommy?

94
00:14:13,924 --> 00:14:16,564
Whoever that boy is, Esme...

95
00:14:17,884 --> 00:14:19,644
...whoever he is,
our business is done here.

96
00:14:19,764 --> 00:14:21,484
I brought you to this camp
for a reason,

97
00:14:21,604 --> 00:14:24,164
and I brought him, as well.

98
00:14:24,284 --> 00:14:25,964
He is yours.

99
00:14:26,084 --> 00:14:28,404
A boy born with hazel eyes.

100
00:14:29,404 --> 00:14:30,964
He calls himself Duke.

101
00:14:32,884 --> 00:14:33,924
His mother is dead.

102
00:14:34,044 --> 00:14:35,924
He's a thief.

103
00:14:36,044 --> 00:14:37,804
He works the fairground,
but he says he wants

104
00:14:37,884 --> 00:14:40,604
more to his life than
big wheels and carousels.

105
00:14:44,244 --> 00:14:47,164
If the losing of Ruby has left
a hole in your heart...

106
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:50,244
...I'll send him to you.

107
00:14:51,764 --> 00:14:53,524
If you give me
a bit more gold...

108
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:58,084
...I'll tell him Tommy Shelby
can offer a man

109
00:14:58,204 --> 00:15:01,444
far, far more than big wheels
and carousels.

110
00:15:03,644 --> 00:15:05,604
Is our business done
or not, Tommy?

111
00:15:33,204 --> 00:15:35,364
I know where you went.

112
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:50,244
I'm going to spend more hours

113
00:15:50,364 --> 00:15:52,164
working in the Commons
with Mr Churchill.

114
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,044
- His fight is my fight.
- I sat like a stone

115
00:15:54,164 --> 00:15:56,124
and thought about you
killing someone in her name.

116
00:15:56,204 --> 00:15:58,164
The Shelby institutions
will be expanded.

117
00:16:00,284 --> 00:16:02,004
I will set up a fund
to research the causes

118
00:16:02,124 --> 00:16:03,164
and cures for consumption.

119
00:16:03,284 --> 00:16:05,204
Did the woman you killed
have children?

120
00:16:05,324 --> 00:16:07,284
10,000 children die
every year, Lizzie.

121
00:16:07,404 --> 00:16:09,124
- Go to bed, Tommy.
- I've been reading

122
00:16:09,244 --> 00:16:11,084
- about new research.
- Stop and close

123
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,644
- your fucking eyes.
- I will not...

124
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,004
I will not stop!

125
00:16:14,124 --> 00:16:16,644
What is this good
that you will become?!

126
00:16:27,164 --> 00:16:28,564
I killed a woman.

127
00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:31,604
I killed a woman and three men.

128
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:34,444
And their bodies will be
thrown aboard the boat,

129
00:16:34,564 --> 00:16:35,884
like all the other bodies,

130
00:16:36,004 --> 00:16:38,684
but I am stepping off that boat
and onto another boat.

131
00:16:40,204 --> 00:16:41,764
Do you understand?!

132
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:45,804
Yeah.

133
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,564
The doctor
from the sanatorium called

134
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:02,124
and said that he needs
to speak with you urgently.

135
00:17:03,884 --> 00:17:06,244
But I think now you are
beyond the help of doctors.

136
00:17:06,364 --> 00:17:07,684
Lizzie...

137
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:12,244
Frances said Arthur's here.

138
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:46,364
Tommy?

139
00:17:47,924 --> 00:17:49,764
- Tom?
- Yeah, it's me.

140
00:17:50,924 --> 00:17:52,124
Ah, fuck.

141
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:13,524
Arthur, give me a light,
will you?

142
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:15,884
I can't find my lighter.

143
00:18:28,404 --> 00:18:31,244
I'm sorry I couldn't speak
at the wagon, Tom.

144
00:18:41,124 --> 00:18:42,524
Don't be sorry.

145
00:18:45,084 --> 00:18:47,004
What are you doing here?

146
00:18:50,244 --> 00:18:52,804
Waiting for this fucking cup
to fill up.

147
00:18:57,164 --> 00:18:58,724
Nearly empty, this barrel.

148
00:19:00,284 --> 00:19:02,364
There are plenty
of barrels, Arthur.

149
00:19:03,484 --> 00:19:05,364
Start another barrel.

150
00:19:05,484 --> 00:19:08,324
I thought maybe they're all
full of fucking blood.

151
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,564
The junk, Tom...

152
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:17,164
...fucks up your mind.

153
00:19:21,684 --> 00:19:23,364
You know, Arthur...

154
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,804
...you was already fucked up.

155
00:19:29,604 --> 00:19:32,244
You was fucked up
since you was a kid.

156
00:19:34,444 --> 00:19:35,564
This is my theory.

157
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:42,044
It's from that time
I gave you a beating

158
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:44,044
when you was twelve
and I was nine.

159
00:19:45,524 --> 00:19:47,484
We were fighting
over cigarettes.

160
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:54,444
Maybe... when I had you
down on the ground...

161
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,844
...I gave you one too many
to the head.

162
00:19:57,964 --> 00:20:00,364
It was a draw, though, Tom.

163
00:20:00,484 --> 00:20:01,844
Nah.

164
00:20:02,884 --> 00:20:04,204
I beat you.

165
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,884
I had you pinned.

166
00:20:07,004 --> 00:20:08,604
You actually didn't.

167
00:20:10,564 --> 00:20:12,564
- We both agreed.
- You're so fucked

168
00:20:12,684 --> 00:20:14,724
you can't remember, Brother.

169
00:20:16,484 --> 00:20:17,884
I do.

170
00:20:18,004 --> 00:20:20,164
I do remember little things.

171
00:20:20,284 --> 00:20:21,604
I know you do.

172
00:20:22,604 --> 00:20:24,484
So do I.

173
00:20:24,604 --> 00:20:26,644
The fog and the gas
is clearing, eh?

174
00:21:18,964 --> 00:21:21,244
Here, that cup's nearly full.
Pass it here.

175
00:21:25,644 --> 00:21:26,964
I thought you...

176
00:21:29,604 --> 00:21:31,484
Tom, you don't want
stuff any more.

177
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:33,084
Eh?

178
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,764
You don't drink no more, Tom.

179
00:21:59,604 --> 00:22:01,844
Even when Polly was gone,
Arthur...

180
00:22:03,204 --> 00:22:04,844
...I thought I could just march
and march.

181
00:22:06,604 --> 00:22:09,084
If I just kept up that fucking
left, right, left, right,

182
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:12,044
left, right, left, right
fucking rhythm,

183
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,204
I'd never have to stop.

184
00:22:16,324 --> 00:22:17,924
Then Ruby went.

185
00:22:21,804 --> 00:22:23,644
I stumbled and crashed.

186
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:30,684
Now here I am...

187
00:22:32,364 --> 00:22:34,804
...sat on me arse...

188
00:22:34,924 --> 00:22:37,324
...on the ground...

189
00:22:37,444 --> 00:22:39,404
...like a fucking toddler...

190
00:22:41,804 --> 00:22:43,724
...with me old comrade Arthur.

191
00:22:44,844 --> 00:22:46,204
Yeah.

192
00:22:48,644 --> 00:22:50,524
Remember the January, Arthur?

193
00:22:53,084 --> 00:22:54,444
The family boat?

194
00:22:56,044 --> 00:22:57,724
The whole family
living on something

195
00:22:57,844 --> 00:23:00,124
the size of ten of
these fucking barrels?

196
00:23:03,804 --> 00:23:07,844
Remember that night
at Tile Cross...

197
00:23:07,964 --> 00:23:10,364
...16 of us
sleeping on the boat?

198
00:23:10,484 --> 00:23:11,724
The coppers come.

199
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,044
We all swim like rats.

200
00:23:15,164 --> 00:23:16,604
Except for Arthur.

201
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:22,004
Arthur holds them off with
a boat hook all on his own.

202
00:23:23,804 --> 00:23:25,124
And I remember...

203
00:23:26,124 --> 00:23:28,644
...I climbed back up
at the lock and I looked back

204
00:23:28,764 --> 00:23:31,404
and saw you waving
that fucking boat hook

205
00:23:31,524 --> 00:23:32,724
in the coppers' faces...

206
00:23:34,644 --> 00:23:35,884
...on your own.

207
00:23:37,324 --> 00:23:38,724
That's when I realised.

208
00:23:40,844 --> 00:23:42,364
When I had you on the ground...

209
00:23:43,404 --> 00:23:45,244
...all them years ago...

210
00:23:45,364 --> 00:23:47,404
...it's cos you let me win.

211
00:23:51,164 --> 00:23:52,684
You wanted me to win.

212
00:23:56,604 --> 00:23:59,364
You've wanted me to win
ever since.

213
00:24:01,084 --> 00:24:03,204
What chance do I have if you...

214
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:08,004
...start doing that again? Eh?

215
00:24:09,764 --> 00:24:13,524
You'll stop. You'll stop
cos the family needs you to.

216
00:24:16,084 --> 00:24:19,804
It's like that long tunnel
on the Dudley stretch.

217
00:24:19,924 --> 00:24:21,684
You remember Dudley Canal,
Line Number 1?

218
00:24:21,804 --> 00:24:23,924
3,172 yards

219
00:24:24,044 --> 00:24:26,644
of fucking pitch-blackness
and rats swimming.

220
00:24:26,764 --> 00:24:27,884
- Yeah.
- And then we'd come

221
00:24:28,004 --> 00:24:31,004
round that corner and
there'd be a shaft of light.

222
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:33,804
And then we'd know.

223
00:24:33,924 --> 00:24:35,244
- Yeah.
- And you and me

224
00:24:35,364 --> 00:24:37,324
would both know
it was nearly done.

225
00:24:40,204 --> 00:24:42,444
That's where we are now, Arthur.

226
00:24:44,404 --> 00:24:46,724
Just a few more yards to go.

227
00:24:48,564 --> 00:24:50,484
Then you will change your ways.

228
00:24:53,764 --> 00:24:55,844
And I'll change
the fucking world.

229
00:26:13,324 --> 00:26:16,004
We assumed, at this late hour,
you would have had dinner.

230
00:26:16,124 --> 00:26:18,164
There are drinks
and sandwiches, if you want.

231
00:26:18,284 --> 00:26:19,484
We're not here to eat.

232
00:26:19,604 --> 00:26:22,884
Mr Shelby will be down shortly.

233
00:26:23,004 --> 00:26:24,844
Please, tell Mr Shelby
on behalf of us all

234
00:26:24,964 --> 00:26:26,244
that changing the world
can wait.

235
00:26:26,364 --> 00:26:28,004
He doesn't want to wait.

236
00:26:28,124 --> 00:26:29,364
There is champagne.

237
00:26:29,484 --> 00:26:31,204
Oh, goodie.

238
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:43,084
Charles?

239
00:26:45,244 --> 00:26:46,804
I heard cars.

240
00:26:51,124 --> 00:26:52,644
Mr Shelby, the guests are...

241
00:26:52,764 --> 00:26:54,164
I know.

242
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:56,524
Dad?

243
00:26:56,644 --> 00:26:58,524
There's a Bentley
and a Rolls-Royce.

244
00:27:01,764 --> 00:27:02,764
Yeah.

245
00:27:04,964 --> 00:27:06,684
Go to bed, Charles.

246
00:27:14,004 --> 00:27:15,764
I can't sleep.

247
00:27:19,244 --> 00:27:21,644
I see her when I shut my eyes.

248
00:27:22,924 --> 00:27:24,724
Go to your mum.

249
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:26,844
She'll be awake.

250
00:27:26,964 --> 00:27:29,644
- She holds on to me.
- Let her hold on to you.

251
00:27:31,444 --> 00:27:33,404
You hear me?

252
00:27:33,524 --> 00:27:35,124
Always let her hold on to you.

253
00:27:36,524 --> 00:27:37,884
Go on.

254
00:27:42,404 --> 00:27:45,044
Mr Shelby, the guests said
they would understand if...

255
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,364
Have you served them drinks?

256
00:27:46,484 --> 00:27:48,484
- Yes.
- Yeah.

257
00:28:01,324 --> 00:28:02,724
I'm OK, Frances.

258
00:28:08,004 --> 00:28:09,604
The agenda is in my head.

259
00:28:11,004 --> 00:28:12,924
The agenda is in my head.

260
00:28:14,124 --> 00:28:15,644
I'm OK.

261
00:28:16,644 --> 00:28:18,164
Do I look OK?

262
00:28:21,444 --> 00:28:23,884
If someone touches you,
you won't shatter.

263
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,364
Sing it.

264
00:28:28,484 --> 00:28:30,324
Sing it. I love that song.

265
00:28:30,444 --> 00:28:33,244
I... can't be singing
rebel songs

266
00:28:33,364 --> 00:28:34,764
in a house
in grief and mourning.

267
00:28:34,884 --> 00:28:37,924
Sing it to me softly.
It breaks my heart.

268
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:41,324
Don't look at him.
He's English.

269
00:28:41,444 --> 00:28:43,404
He can block his ears.

270
00:28:46,444 --> 00:28:47,444
Darling?

271
00:28:47,484 --> 00:28:50,884
Should she sing her rebel
IRA song while we wait,

272
00:28:51,004 --> 00:28:52,964
or would that be inappropriate?

273
00:28:56,644 --> 00:28:57,804
You know, I went to a meeting

274
00:28:57,884 --> 00:28:59,364
of similar intent to this
in Berlin

275
00:28:59,484 --> 00:29:02,604
attended by
the Chancellor himself...

276
00:29:02,724 --> 00:29:05,804
...and Göring and Himmler.

277
00:29:07,124 --> 00:29:08,604
It lasted until the sun came up.

278
00:29:08,724 --> 00:29:13,124
We spoke about the future
of the world in a serious way.

279
00:29:15,164 --> 00:29:17,884
When the first rays of light
entered the room, we all stood

280
00:29:18,004 --> 00:29:20,644
and stared at it as if it were
the world to come.

281
00:29:21,964 --> 00:29:24,524
There was no singing,
no giggling.

282
00:29:27,444 --> 00:29:29,484
And when breakfast was served
on the terrace,

283
00:29:29,604 --> 00:29:31,124
overlooking the mountains,

284
00:29:31,244 --> 00:29:32,884
they brought up some Jews.

285
00:29:34,804 --> 00:29:37,924
And while we ate our eggs,
they were forced to eat grass.

286
00:29:39,484 --> 00:29:42,444
And we watched
as we sipped our coffee.

287
00:29:48,444 --> 00:29:51,204
We should all remember
this is serious business.

288
00:30:00,404 --> 00:30:01,764
Oh, Diana.

289
00:30:03,924 --> 00:30:06,764
Now look what you've done.
You've killed the mood.

290
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:13,924
Let her sing her fucking song
to raise our spirits.

291
00:30:14,044 --> 00:30:15,804
Go on. Please.

No, please, no condolences.
Thank you all for coming.

304
00:33:54,084 --> 00:33:55,124
Now, let's try to find out

305
00:33:55,244 --> 00:33:57,804
how this new world of ours
will look, shall we?

306
00:34:04,724 --> 00:34:06,524
Perhaps, Mr Mosley, we can turn

307
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:08,524
to what practical things
Mr Nelson can do

308
00:34:08,644 --> 00:34:11,484
to... further our cause
while he's in the country.

309
00:34:11,604 --> 00:34:14,964
It's me who has the ear of the
President of the United States.

310
00:34:15,084 --> 00:34:18,124
Which is kind of
why I'm here, right?

311
00:34:18,244 --> 00:34:19,564
We do indeed have things

312
00:34:19,684 --> 00:34:22,244
for you to whisper
into the President's ear.

313
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:28,004
Tell him we are England.
We are the mood England is in.

314
00:34:28,124 --> 00:34:32,404
And in Ireland, appeasers
to the English abound,

315
00:34:32,524 --> 00:34:35,284
but we represent
the true, liberated spirit

316
00:34:35,404 --> 00:34:38,084
of the country that populated
your own.

317
00:34:40,404 --> 00:34:43,284
I hear about communists
in both places.

318
00:34:43,404 --> 00:34:45,364
We are the bulwark against them.

319
00:34:46,604 --> 00:34:49,324
When it comes
to the working class,

320
00:34:49,444 --> 00:34:52,484
we could move our people
from republicanism

321
00:34:52,604 --> 00:34:54,844
to fascism with just a nudge.

322
00:34:56,204 --> 00:34:57,284
They trust us.

323
00:34:58,604 --> 00:35:01,284
You ride with hounds, Mr Mosley.

324
00:35:01,404 --> 00:35:02,804
Will you hunt communists?

325
00:35:02,924 --> 00:35:06,244
Oh, my hounds are baying.

326
00:35:06,364 --> 00:35:07,884
Shelby...

327
00:35:08,004 --> 00:35:09,644
...you run as a socialist.

328
00:35:17,164 --> 00:35:18,644
Mr Shelby has one of

329
00:35:18,764 --> 00:35:21,764
the largest Commons majorities
in England.

330
00:35:21,884 --> 00:35:24,284
In the heart of England.

331
00:35:25,284 --> 00:35:27,564
When the time comes,
he'll resign his party whip

332
00:35:27,684 --> 00:35:29,404
and run as an independent.

333
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:35,124
But underneath, do you truly

334
00:35:35,244 --> 00:35:36,724
believe in the cause, Mr Shelby?

335
00:35:48,244 --> 00:35:49,884
I'm here.

336
00:35:50,004 --> 00:35:52,124
Mr Nelson,
I'm here four nights...

337
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:01,124
...four nights after,
and I am here...

338
00:36:02,604 --> 00:36:04,604
...in this room,
in this meeting.

339
00:36:04,724 --> 00:36:06,324
I am here and I am serious.

340
00:36:09,204 --> 00:36:10,764
Prove it to him.

341
00:36:14,804 --> 00:36:16,484
Prove it physically.

342
00:36:28,404 --> 00:36:30,244
Perish Judah.

343
00:36:37,644 --> 00:36:39,524
Perish Judah.

344
00:36:46,484 --> 00:36:48,124
That thing is going to
get us killed.

345
00:36:51,644 --> 00:36:52,884
Go to bed.

346
00:36:54,244 --> 00:36:57,244
At school, they've stopped
talking to me.

347
00:37:01,404 --> 00:37:03,524
They say the black rubs off.

348
00:37:06,164 --> 00:37:08,084
When they come to power...

349
00:37:08,204 --> 00:37:09,804
...they'll take her off you.

350
00:37:11,044 --> 00:37:12,844
They're going to
separate us all out.

351
00:37:14,964 --> 00:37:16,924
They'll send her to Africa.

352
00:37:18,724 --> 00:37:19,884
Yeah?

353
00:37:20,884 --> 00:37:22,484
And where will they send you?

354
00:37:23,844 --> 00:37:25,564
Where will they send you, Karl?

355
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:29,004
You're half Gypsy, so...

356
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:30,684
...to Egypt, maybe?

357
00:37:35,844 --> 00:37:38,404
Something I never
told you before...

358
00:37:38,524 --> 00:37:40,244
...because it wasn't important.

359
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,364
Maybe now it is.

360
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,404
Your dad was Jewish.

361
00:37:48,444 --> 00:37:51,564
He was the son
of a tailor in Stechford.

362
00:37:51,684 --> 00:37:53,164
They changed their name
to Thorne

363
00:37:53,284 --> 00:37:55,844
to stop the bricks
coming through the window.

364
00:37:57,764 --> 00:37:59,684
So where will they send you,
Karl?

365
00:38:03,044 --> 00:38:06,484
Mr Nelson, you can report back
to your president

366
00:38:06,604 --> 00:38:09,404
that the aristocracy
and the meritocracy are united

367
00:38:09,524 --> 00:38:12,524
in their conviction
that a new order is coming.

368
00:38:14,604 --> 00:38:16,644
Also, Mr Nelson, at present

369
00:38:16,764 --> 00:38:19,244
our weapons are coming
from Germany.

370
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:21,484
The British are closing
our supply lines down.

371
00:38:21,604 --> 00:38:23,964
We would value
a supply from Boston.

372
00:38:25,364 --> 00:38:26,524
Weapons I can give you,

373
00:38:26,644 --> 00:38:28,724
if they're to be used
in a good cause.

374
00:38:28,844 --> 00:38:31,724
And while on the subject
of import and export,

375
00:38:31,844 --> 00:38:33,084
Mr Shelby,

376
00:38:33,204 --> 00:38:35,364
in light of our new relationship

377
00:38:35,484 --> 00:38:37,524
and since you have
proven your commitment

378
00:38:37,644 --> 00:38:39,324
in a most extraordinary way...

379
00:38:40,324 --> 00:38:42,244
...Boston is now
officially open

380
00:38:42,364 --> 00:38:44,724
for the importation
of your merchandise.

381
00:38:50,564 --> 00:38:51,724
Good.

382
00:39:32,444 --> 00:39:35,444
If we have established
what we came here to establish,

383
00:39:35,564 --> 00:39:37,404
perhaps we should all
say goodnight.

384
00:39:37,524 --> 00:39:38,644
Absolutely.

385
00:40:26,564 --> 00:40:28,100
That's the same typewriter
you bought me

386
00:40:28,124 --> 00:40:29,484
all those years ago...

387
00:40:30,964 --> 00:40:33,684
...to help me become
more respectable.

388
00:40:33,804 --> 00:40:35,244
Do you remember?

389
00:40:36,804 --> 00:40:38,164
Yeah.

390
00:40:45,044 --> 00:40:46,444
This arrived.

391
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:48,964
It's from the sanatorium.

392
00:40:50,564 --> 00:40:52,924
I've already paid
Ruby's medical bills.

393
00:40:53,044 --> 00:40:55,644
I don't think it's a bill.

394
00:40:55,764 --> 00:40:57,124
It says it's urgent.

395
00:40:57,244 --> 00:40:59,884
It's from the senior consultant.

396
00:41:18,124 --> 00:41:19,884
Why didn't you come to bed?

397
00:41:25,044 --> 00:41:26,844
Why didn't you come to bed?

398
00:41:32,444 --> 00:41:34,724
I'm typing up
my recollection of the meeting.

399
00:41:36,324 --> 00:41:38,524
If I... If I do it
straight away...

400
00:41:39,524 --> 00:41:41,844
...I can quote people
word for word.

401
00:41:42,964 --> 00:41:44,964
The information is more...

402
00:41:45,084 --> 00:41:46,244
...useful to Mr Churchill

403
00:41:46,364 --> 00:41:47,924
if it is word for word.

404
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:16,324
I burned her chair.

405
00:42:19,004 --> 00:42:21,164
The paint on the wood
left a smell in the air.

406
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:24,044
I didn't open the window.

407
00:42:26,684 --> 00:42:28,244
I quite like the smell.

408
00:42:54,324 --> 00:42:55,564
Not yet.

409
00:42:58,244 --> 00:42:59,924
Not yet.

410
00:43:02,244 --> 00:43:04,244
I have this work to do,
cos now I know...

411
00:43:05,244 --> 00:43:06,964
...that I will change...

412
00:43:09,004 --> 00:43:10,684
...that I have to change.

413
00:43:12,244 --> 00:43:14,884
And change for good, Lizzie.

414
00:43:20,484 --> 00:43:22,244
Not just yet.

415
00:43:53,484 --> 00:43:54,844
Hello?

416
00:43:58,684 --> 00:43:59,844
Oh.

417
00:45:14,804 --> 00:45:16,364
I saw him leave.

418
00:45:17,844 --> 00:45:19,004
He keeps this apartment

419
00:45:19,124 --> 00:45:21,724
expressly for this purpose,
doesn't he?

420
00:45:22,924 --> 00:45:25,284
Are you following me, Mr Shelby?

421
00:45:26,404 --> 00:45:28,164
I'm flattered...

422
00:45:28,284 --> 00:45:30,124
...but why?

423
00:45:30,244 --> 00:45:31,964
When I do business with someone,

424
00:45:32,084 --> 00:45:34,684
I make it my business
to know their secrets.

425
00:45:37,364 --> 00:45:39,364
Mosley's reputation
is no secret.

426
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,084
Not him, you.

427
00:45:44,884 --> 00:45:46,364
How did you know I'd come here?

428
00:45:47,364 --> 00:45:49,524
I know things.

429
00:45:49,644 --> 00:45:51,964
I read people's minds, you know?

430
00:45:54,244 --> 00:45:57,964
Little glances across tables.
It's a gift.

431
00:45:58,084 --> 00:45:59,244
The whole family...

432
00:46:00,244 --> 00:46:01,964
...witches and sorcerers.

433
00:46:11,324 --> 00:46:13,564
Your uncle will disown you...

434
00:46:13,684 --> 00:46:15,684
...fucking his business partner

435
00:46:15,804 --> 00:46:17,564
behind his back.

436
00:46:17,684 --> 00:46:20,884
- You think he has morals?
- He's a Catholic.

437
00:46:21,004 --> 00:46:23,524
Men do what they want,
women do what they are told.

438
00:46:25,844 --> 00:46:27,284
Will you tell Michael?

439
00:46:28,604 --> 00:46:29,884
Michael is family.

440
00:46:31,244 --> 00:46:33,644
We are a family healed.

441
00:46:34,844 --> 00:46:37,044
You have no interest in me...

442
00:46:37,164 --> 00:46:38,764
...or in Michael...

443
00:46:40,204 --> 00:46:43,004
...so why don't you just tell
me what you actually want?

444
00:46:54,804 --> 00:46:56,604
You will be with Mosley...

445
00:46:57,604 --> 00:47:00,004
...when he's in Berlin.

446
00:47:00,124 --> 00:47:01,524
You'll be in the room
when he meets

447
00:47:01,644 --> 00:47:04,004
senior members
of the German government.

448
00:47:04,124 --> 00:47:06,324
I want to know
what is discussed...

449
00:47:07,444 --> 00:47:09,484
...and I want to know
what is decided.

450
00:47:11,964 --> 00:47:13,644
And if I lie?

451
00:47:15,484 --> 00:47:17,004
I will know.

452
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:28,404
You know, Michael thinks
you're the devil...

453
00:47:29,564 --> 00:47:31,924
...and I think he might
actually be right.

454
00:47:33,364 --> 00:47:35,324
That was the other reason
I came here.

455
00:47:35,444 --> 00:47:39,044
What are Michael's real
intentions toward me, Gina?

456
00:47:40,044 --> 00:47:42,444
And if you lie, I will know.

457
00:47:46,924 --> 00:47:47,924
Tommy...

458
00:47:49,604 --> 00:47:52,124
...he intends
to complete the deal.

459
00:47:53,124 --> 00:47:54,684
And then you both walk away.

460
00:48:09,444 --> 00:48:11,244
Fuck!

461
00:49:32,644 --> 00:49:33,844
Come.

462
00:49:36,284 --> 00:49:38,204
Mr Shelby? Dr Holford.

463
00:49:41,324 --> 00:49:42,444
Send him in.

464
00:49:49,764 --> 00:49:53,444
You said it had to be
in person. Here I am.

465
00:49:55,164 --> 00:49:57,484
You might want to sit down.

466
00:50:04,164 --> 00:50:05,404
Mr Shelby, I know

467
00:50:05,524 --> 00:50:07,924
that you are still
grieving for your daughter...

468
00:50:08,924 --> 00:50:10,964
...but I have news
that cannot wait.

469
00:50:16,004 --> 00:50:18,884
When you were X-rayed
and examined

470
00:50:19,004 --> 00:50:21,484
at the sanatorium
ten days ago...

471
00:50:23,204 --> 00:50:26,524
...there was no TB
found in your lung.

472
00:50:28,524 --> 00:50:30,764
But I am afraid
they found something else...

473
00:50:31,764 --> 00:50:34,604
...something related to
your daughter's illness.

474
00:50:37,924 --> 00:50:40,764
They tried to speak to you
at the hospital

475
00:50:40,884 --> 00:50:42,644
but you were not co-operating.

476
00:50:44,724 --> 00:50:46,924
After your daughter's death...

477
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,764
...you could not be found
to be informed in person.

478
00:50:50,764 --> 00:50:54,284
Eventually, as your personal
doctor, they called me.

479
00:50:57,404 --> 00:50:58,644
I didn't offer you tea.

480
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,924
You look like death.
Do you want tea?

481
00:51:02,124 --> 00:51:03,324
No.

482
00:51:04,924 --> 00:51:07,844
At the sanatorium,
they conducted blood tests.

483
00:51:09,844 --> 00:51:13,204
The tests suggest
that the shadow you can see

484
00:51:13,324 --> 00:51:15,524
at the base of your skull...

485
00:51:15,644 --> 00:51:17,124
...is not cancer...

486
00:51:18,484 --> 00:51:20,044
...it is tuberculoma...

487
00:51:22,404 --> 00:51:26,004
...a tubercular growth caused
by the same bacteria as TB.

488
00:51:29,644 --> 00:51:32,164
You may have picked it up
from your daughter.

489
00:51:33,764 --> 00:51:37,884
Once this disease enters
a household, it can run wild.

490
00:51:38,004 --> 00:51:40,524
It can be transmitted
with a simple kiss.

491
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:47,324
It seems the Shelby household
is no exception.

492
00:51:51,404 --> 00:51:55,924
Mr Shelby, as I say, I am aware
that you are still grieving...

493
00:51:56,044 --> 00:51:59,244
...but you must understand
this is very serious.

494
00:52:01,484 --> 00:52:04,804
From the size of the tumour,
expansion must have been rapid.

495
00:52:06,124 --> 00:52:10,524
I have no doubt that you are
already experiencing symptoms.

496
00:52:11,564 --> 00:52:13,724
Have you recently
suffered seizures?

497
00:52:15,004 --> 00:52:16,604
Bouts of weakness?

498
00:52:16,724 --> 00:52:19,124
Dissociation?

499
00:52:19,244 --> 00:52:20,564
Hallucinations?

500
00:52:28,604 --> 00:52:30,284
Why didn't you come and see me?

501
00:52:32,884 --> 00:52:34,124
I have work to do.

502
00:52:38,204 --> 00:52:40,004
Am I a danger to others?

503
00:52:41,484 --> 00:52:42,964
No.

504
00:52:43,084 --> 00:52:46,684
Unlike TB, tuberculoma
is not infectious.

505
00:52:46,804 --> 00:52:50,724
Mr Shelby,
it is not infectious...

506
00:52:50,844 --> 00:52:52,964
...but in your case...

507
00:52:53,084 --> 00:52:55,524
...I am afraid
it is inoperable.

508
00:52:57,164 --> 00:52:59,044
The growth is
in your brain stem.

509
00:52:59,164 --> 00:53:00,564
Any attempt to remove it

510
00:53:00,684 --> 00:53:03,324
would result in trauma
and brain haemorrhage.

511
00:53:07,644 --> 00:53:09,404
Whilst you were
refusing my calls,

512
00:53:09,524 --> 00:53:10,644
I showed your X-rays

513
00:53:10,764 --> 00:53:13,284
to three of the best surgeons
in the country.

514
00:53:16,804 --> 00:53:18,884
They all said
they would not operate...

515
00:53:19,884 --> 00:53:22,164
...as it would be futile.

516
00:53:22,284 --> 00:53:25,684
Of course, you will want

517
00:53:25,804 --> 00:53:28,364
a second opinion for yourself.

518
00:53:28,484 --> 00:53:29,564
Dr Helen Rutherford

519
00:53:29,684 --> 00:53:33,044
at St Thomas'.
She is a friend.

520
00:53:44,364 --> 00:53:45,764
This...

521
00:53:47,644 --> 00:53:48,964
How bad will it get?

522
00:53:55,404 --> 00:53:57,564
As the tumour grows,

523
00:53:57,684 --> 00:54:01,444
the rate of physical and mental
deterioration will increase.

524
00:54:06,004 --> 00:54:10,724
Eventually, you will need
people around you constantly...

525
00:54:10,844 --> 00:54:13,044
...who love you very much.

526
00:54:16,084 --> 00:54:17,564
How long?

527
00:54:20,764 --> 00:54:22,524
I understand
that you have defeated

528
00:54:22,644 --> 00:54:24,044
many enemies, Mr Shelby.

529
00:54:25,244 --> 00:54:27,324
Now you have a new one...

530
00:54:27,444 --> 00:54:28,764
...inside you.

531
00:54:30,284 --> 00:54:31,684
You cannot defeat it...

532
00:54:33,164 --> 00:54:36,444
...but you <i>can</i> keep it at bay
for a while.

533
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:37,844
If you live correctly,

534
00:54:37,964 --> 00:54:39,924
if you are determined
and if you fight...

535
00:54:40,044 --> 00:54:41,724
I asked you a question.

536
00:54:41,844 --> 00:54:43,724
This time I want an answer.

537
00:54:43,844 --> 00:54:45,644
I don't want
your fucking platitudes.

538
00:54:45,764 --> 00:54:49,924
How long before I need
people around me

539
00:54:50,044 --> 00:54:51,724
who love me very much?

540
00:54:55,964 --> 00:54:57,844
- Sorry.
- It's fine, Lizzie.

541
00:54:57,964 --> 00:54:59,004
My accountant here

542
00:54:59,124 --> 00:55:00,564
was just leaving.

543
00:55:05,404 --> 00:55:07,804
I will telephone you
when I get back to London.

544
00:55:07,924 --> 00:55:09,124
No, I don't have enough time.

545
00:55:09,244 --> 00:55:12,044
You're an accountant,
give me a fucking number now.

546
00:55:13,364 --> 00:55:15,244
One year.

547
00:55:15,364 --> 00:55:17,164
Perhaps 18 months.

548
00:55:17,284 --> 00:55:20,644
That's fine.
That's all I need to know.

549
00:55:20,764 --> 00:55:24,324
I will adjust my finances
accordingly. Thank you.

550
00:55:26,044 --> 00:55:28,164
I will write to you, explaining
the full implications.

551
00:55:28,204 --> 00:55:29,644
Yeah, thank you.

552
00:55:33,604 --> 00:55:34,804
Good day.

553
00:55:43,444 --> 00:55:44,844
Something serious?

554
00:55:46,004 --> 00:55:48,244
No. No, just a...

555
00:55:48,364 --> 00:55:51,444
...just a bill I wasn't
expecting, and I...

556
00:55:52,444 --> 00:55:54,004
...I'll have to pay it.

557
00:56:03,924 --> 00:56:06,004
Will you give me
a minute on me own, Lizzie?

558
00:56:10,124 --> 00:56:11,404
Yeah.

559
00:56:26,964 --> 00:56:28,244
Not a devil...

560
00:56:31,324 --> 00:56:34,044
...just an ordinary mortal man.

561
00:56:39,924 --> 00:56:42,364
<i>There will be a war
in this family...</i>

562
00:56:44,324 --> 00:56:46,124
<i>...and one of you will die.</i>

563
00:56:48,564 --> 00:56:50,604
Polly...

564
00:56:51,884 --> 00:56:54,444
...just give me enough time
to do what I have to do.

565
00:56:56,644 --> 00:56:57,964
<i>Kill.</i>

566
00:56:58,084 --> 00:56:59,804
<i>Kill...</i>
