1
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,673
A cripple?

2
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,509
You let a cripple escape?

3
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:19,556
The boy can't walk,
but somehow he slipped past you?

4
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,184
The giant must have took him.

5
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,063
The giant?

6
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,148
Hodor?

7
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,943
Oh, that's all right, then.

8
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,738
You let a halfwit escape with a cripple.

9
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,282
And rickon, too? The little one?

10
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,868
Gone, along with the wildling woman.

11
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,996
The one you were fucking.

12
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,600
Right.

13
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,977
Get the horses and the hounds.

14
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,858
Come on, find the scent.

15
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,489
Where they going?

16
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,875
Halt!

17
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,173
Enjoying your first hunt?

18
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:38,385
So far, hunting seems
very similar to riding, my lord.

19
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,345
With hunting, there's blood at the end.

20
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:41,596
They're little boys.

21
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,350
I was a little boy when I was torn away
from my home and brought here.

22
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:48,645
So I kept my word. I never ran away.

23
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,815
If I find them soon
enough, I won't hurt them.

24
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,986
Well, I'll hurtthem, but I won't kill them.

25
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,531
Those boys are of far more value
to you alive than dead.

26
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,032
They have no value to me missing.

27
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,452
Robb will have sent a force
to retake winterfell by now.

28
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,872
Robb's in the riverlands.
My sister's in deepwood motte.

29
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,499
She'll get here long before they do.

30
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:14,379
And ned stark always said 500 men
could hold winterfell against 10,000.

31
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,882
Man: We have a scent!

32
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,091
The hounds have the scent.

33
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,928
Come, maester, don't look so grim.

34
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,514
It's all just a game.

35
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,304
Osha: We should have took more food.

36
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,159
We couldn't risk going to the kitchens.

37
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,929
Those people all love you. They would have
given you whatever you needed.

38
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,247
And if theon found out, he'd hang them.

39
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,708
- The boy can't survive on walnuts.
- I'm fine.

40
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,213
We've been walking since before sunrise.

41
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,507
- Even hodor will tire.
- Hodor.

42
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,051
- Even you, sweet giant.
- Hodor.

43
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,349
Wait, I know that farm.

44
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,060
I sent those two winterfell orphans there.

45
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,145
Jack and Billy.

46
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,981
- They'll give us some food.
- We can't risk it.

47
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:18,860
If theon tracks us here, he'll torture them
until he finds out where we are.

48
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,321
Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.

49
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,244
You've never seen me
climb a tree, little man.

50
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,826
They'll be after us with hounds.

51
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:29,329
We got a good start on them,
but we can't outrun hounds forever.

52
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,440
Did you pull a knife on me in the night?

53
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,786
What's the matter?

54
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,747
Can't be the first time you pressed
your bone against a woman's arse.

55
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,668
Let's move.

56
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,885
It is the first time.

57
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,221
How old are you, boy?

58
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,807
I'm a man of the night's watch.

59
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,520
You're a boy who's never been with a girl.

60
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:43,153
Don't your stones start to hurt
if your bone never gets...

61
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,530
Don't call them that.

62
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,532
What, stones?

63
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,660
Or bone?

64
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,370
Neither.

65
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,664
Both.

66
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,793
Move!

67
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:08,428
I heard they get all swollen and bruised
if you don't use them.

68
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:13,016
Of course, maybe that's just what the lads
say when they want me feeling sorry for them.

69
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,060
As if I'd feel sorry for them.

70
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,521
Are there no girl crows?

71
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,943
There are no women
of the night's watch, no.

72
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,736
So the lads just do it with each other?

73
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,365
- Never?
- Never.

74
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,034
We swore an oath.

75
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,870
You have sheep at the wall?

76
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,333
With your hands, then?

77
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,002
No wonder you're all so miserable.

78
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,881
- Would you please shut up?
- Would you please shut up?

79
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,927
You think you're better than me, crow.

80
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,304
- I'm a free woman.
- You're a free woman?

81
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,556
I might be your prisoner,
but I'm a free woman.

82
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,143
If you're my prisoner, you're not
a free woman. That's what "prisoner" means.

83
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,145
And you think you're free?

84
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,858
You swore some stupid oath
and now you can never touch a girl.

85
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,152
It was my choice to say the words.

86
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,276
- So you don't like girls?
- Of course I like girls.

87
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,906
But you chose never to touch them.

88
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,867
That's the price you pay if you
want to be a man of the night's watch.

89
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:16,329
So instead of getting naked with a girl,
you'd prefer to invade our lands...

90
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,039
Invade your lands?

91
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,291
Wildlings raid our lands all the time.

92
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,003
Some of them tried to kill my
little brother, a crippled boy!

93
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,963
They're not your lands!

94
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,173
We've been here the whole time.

95
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,593
You lot came along and just put
up a big wall and said it was yours.

96
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,971
My father was ned stark.

97
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,348
I have the blood of the first men.

98
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,101
My ancestors lived here, same as yours.

99
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,772
So why are you fighting us?

100
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,457
Go on.

101
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,798
Man: Now I want you to tell me
what happened.

102
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,642
Guard: Come on, this way.

103
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,638
Man: Come on, speak up. Speak up.

104
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,187
Wolfsbane.

105
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,315
A rare substance.

106
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,526
This is no common assassin.

107
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,862
We hanged 20 men last night.

108
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,239
I don't care if you hanged 100.

109
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,285
A man tried to kill me.
I want his name and I want his head.

110
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:41,206
We think it was an infiltrator from
the brotherhood without banners.

111
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,417
Pretentious name for a band of outlaws.

112
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:49,172
We can't allow rebels behind our lines
to harass us with impunity.

113
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:53,051
We look like fools and they look
like heroes. That's how kings fall.

114
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,220
I want them dead, every one.

115
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,013
Killing them isn't the problem.

116
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:58,973
It's finding them.

117
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,350
Have you gone soft, clegane?

118
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,439
I always thought you
had a talent for violence.

119
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,231
Burn the villages, burn the farms.

120
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,442
Let them know what it means
to choose the wrong side.

121
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,527
Mmm.

122
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,573
Is that mutton?

123
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,325
Yes, my lord.

124
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,576
Don't like mutton.

125
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,747
- I'll bring something else.
- Leave it.

126
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,627
- Are you hungry?
- No.

127
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,379
Of course you are.

128
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,131
Eat.

129
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,883
I'll eat in the kitchen later.

130
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,387
It's bad manners to refuse a lord's offer.

131
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,514
Sit.

132
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,684
Eat.

133
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,230
You're small for your age.

134
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,609
I suppose you've been underfed
your whole life.

135
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:52,861
I eat a lot.

136
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,904
I just don't grow.

137
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,072
Mmm.

138
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,661
This will be my last war.

139
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,873
Win or lose.

140
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,626
Have you ever lost before?

141
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:12,505
Do you think I'd be in my position
if! Had lost a war?

142
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,638
But this is the one I'll be remembered for.

143
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,601
The war of five kings, they're calling it.

144
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,314
My legacy will be determined
in the coming months.

145
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,651
Do you know what legacy means?

146
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:40,408
It's what you pass down to your children
and your children's children.

147
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,787
It's what remains of you when you're gone.

148
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,628
Harren the black thought
this castle would be his legacy.

149
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,299
The greatest fortress ever built.

150
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,135
The tallest towers, the strongest walls.

151
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,347
The great hall had 35 hearths.

152
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,475
Thirty-five. Can you imagine?

153
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:07,977
Look at it now.

154
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,939
A blasted ruin.

155
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,317
Do you know what happened?

156
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,027
Dragons?

157
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:17,654
Yes.

158
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,156
Dragons happened.

159
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:27,497
Harrenhal was built to withstand
an attack from the land.

160
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,211
A million men could have
marched on these walls,

161
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,505
and a million men would have been repelled.

162
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:40,176
But an attack from the air
with dragon fire... mmm-mmm.

163
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,389
Harren and all his sons
roasted alive within these walls.

164
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,976
Aegon Targaryen changed the rules.

165
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,563
That's why every child alive
still knows his name

166
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,482
300 years after his death.

167
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,734
Aegon and his sisters.

168
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,573
It wasn'tjust aegon riding his dragon.

169
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,701
It was rhaenys and visenya, too.

170
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,536
Correct.

171
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,205
A student of history, are you?

172
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,332
Rhaenys rode meraxes.

173
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,418
Visenya rode vhagar.

174
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,839
I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.

175
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,883
Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior.

176
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,179
She had a valyrian steel sword
she called dark sister.

177
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,432
Hmm.

178
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,559
She's a heroine of yours, I take it?

179
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,522
Aren't most girls more interested
in the pretty maidens from the songs?

180
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,816
Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?

181
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,776
Most girls are idiots.

182
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,947
You remind me of my daughter.

183
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:49,245
Where did you learn all this stuff about
visenya and her valyrian steel sword?

184
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,415
From my father.

185
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,086
He was a well-read stonemason.

186
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,758
Can't say I've ever met
a literate stonemason.

187
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,094
Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?

188
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,182
Careful now, girl.

189
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,934
I enjoy you, but be careful.

190
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,520
Take that back to the kitchen.

191
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,481
Eat what you want.

192
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,444
And, girl.

193
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,989
"M'iord."

194
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,619
Lowborn girls say "m'lord,"

195
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,788
not "my lord."

196
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,583
If you're going to pose as a commoner,
you should do it properly.

197
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:41,714
My mother served lady Dustin
for many years, my lord.

198
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,385
She taught me how to speak proper...
Properly.

199
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,349
You're too smart for your own good.
Has anyone told you that?

200
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:52,809
Yes.

201
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,186
Go on.

202
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,658
I beg pardon, ser.

203
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:14,497
I should have come to you after
to thank you for saving me.

204
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,125
- You were so brave.
- Brave?

205
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,711
A dog doesn't need
courage to chase off rats.

206
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,548
Does it give you joy to scare people?

207
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,551
No, it gives me joy to kill people.

208
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,011
Spare me. You can't tell me

209
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,014
lord Eddard stark of winterfell
never killed a man.

210
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,892
It was his duty. He never liked it.

211
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,603
Is that what he told you?

212
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:38,855
He lied.

213
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,732
Killing is the sweetest thing there is.

214
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,278
Why are you always so hateful?

215
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,990
You'll be glad of the hateful things I do
someday when you're queen

216
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,326
and I'm all that stands between you
and your beloved king.

217
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:05,381
I've demanded a meeting of the thirteen.
One of them did this or knows who did.

218
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,091
You are one of the thirteen.

219
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,260
If I wanted your dragons,
I would have taken them.

220
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,430
- They mean nothing to me on their own.
- Nothing?

221
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,099
They're more valuable
than anything in the world.

222
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,642
Shall we look inside my vault

223
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,854
and see what selling your dragons
would buy me I cannot buy already?

224
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,939
We will get them back.

225
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:26,694
There is no we,
so why would you help me get them back?

226
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:30,239
I took you under my protection
in front of the rulers of my city.

227
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,658
A man is what others say he is and no more.

228
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:37,788
If they say that xaro xhoan daxos
is a liar, my word is worth nothing.

229
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,292
I cannot let this thing happen to you
under my roof.

230
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,586
But it did happen under your roof.

231
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,048
Khaleesi, many times
in my life, I have been...

232
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,758
I don't care where you've been.

233
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:15,785
You think we're savages
because we don't live in stone castles.

234
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:19,622
We can't make steel as good as yours,
it's true, but...

235
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,374
We're free.

236
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,503
If someone tried to tell us
we couldn't lie down as man and woman,

237
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,797
we'd shove a spear up his arse.

238
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,717
We don't go serving some shit king
who's only king because his father was.

239
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,514
No, you serve mance rayder,
the king beyond the wall.

240
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,975
We chose mance rayder to lead us.

241
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:44,021
He was a crow, same as you,
but he wanted to be free.

242
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,858
You could be free, too.

243
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:52,488
You don't need to live your whole life
taking commands from old men.

244
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,199
Wake up when you want to wake up.

245
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,869
I could show you the streams to fish,
the woods to hunt.

246
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:02,290
Build yourself a cabin and
find a woman to lie with in the night.

247
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,210
You're a pretty lad.

248
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,589
The girls would claw each other's eyes out
to get naked with you.

249
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,634
Walk.

250
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,180
I could teach you how to do it.

251
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,349
I know how to do it.

252
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,646
You know nothing, Jon snow.

253
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,761
And what did she say?

254
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,472
She admired your spirit, your grace.

255
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,390
And what then?

256
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,644
She...

257
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:11,400
If every man were held accountable for the
actions of every distant relative, ser alton,

258
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,652
we'd all hang.

259
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,157
She tore the paper in half, your grace.

260
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,743
You've acted with honor.

261
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,495
I thank you for it.

262
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:27,500
Lord karstark, see that ser alton's
pen is clean, and give him a hot supper.

263
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,252
Ser alton's pen is occupied, your grace.

264
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,421
The prisoners from the yellow fork.

265
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,590
Too many prisoners.

266
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,301
Is there room for ser alton?

267
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,887
Does he need to lie down?

268
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,767
Have the men build him a new pen.

269
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,561
Put him in with the kingslayer for now.

270
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,647
Have your boy watch over them.

271
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,440
Torrhen.

272
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,776
That will be all.

273
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,118
Your grace.

274
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,286
A minute of yourtime?

275
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,220
I've been treating your wounded men.

276
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,974
And my enemies, as some of my bannermen
are fond of mentioning.

277
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,851
They're not my enemies.

278
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,145
That's what I tell my bannermen.

279
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:32,064
I've already run through the supplies
I brought with me.

280
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:36,277
Some are easily replaced.
Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses.

281
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,612
But some are not.

282
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,157
I need silk for stitching.

283
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,496
I need fennel root for those with fever,
Willow bark. Mostly I need milk of the poppy.

284
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,614
You saw what it was like
to amputate a foot without any.

285
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:55,212
I assume there will be more loss of limb
before this war is over.

286
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,008
- If you need help finding these...
- I know where to find them.

287
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,636
I'm sorry, I shouldn't interrupt you.

288
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,681
Continue, my lady.

289
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,396
You're riding to the crag
to negotiate a surrender?

290
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,522
Yes.

291
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,776
The crag will have a maester
and he will have what I need.

292
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,111
I expect he will.

293
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,280
If I could write a list.

294
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,199
Come with me to the crag.

295
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,636
I don't think that will be...

296
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,704
Let the maester show you his stores.

297
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,291
I want the wounded men to be treated well,

298
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,002
all the wounded men.

299
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,304
Woman: Children, come inside, quick.
Child: Come on.

300
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:46,889
Hurry up!

301
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,768
Man: Can't find anything, ser.

302
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,312
- They've lost the scent.
- Try again.

303
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,816
We've circled this farmhouse twice.
There's no sign of them.

304
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,735
We could start the search fresh
in the morning, my lord.

305
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,665
I'm looking at spending the rest of my life

306
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,574
being treated like a fool and a eunuch
by my own people.

307
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:09,537
Ask yourself, is there anything I
wouldn't do to stop that from happening?

308
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,791
The hounds will find the scent again.
I'll beat them until they do.

309
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:17,378
I'll whip every man here
until I have both those boys in hand.

310
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,130
And once I've got them,
the pampered little shits...

311
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,635
It's better to be cruel than weak.

312
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,178
Prince theon.

313
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,639
- Where are they?
- Who, m'lord?

314
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,975
The stark boys. Where are they?

315
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,393
I don't know. I seen no one.

316
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,604
Think harder.

317
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,400
I swear, m'lord. I don't know.

318
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,278
My lord, over here.

319
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:48,325
I think I've found what we're looking for.

320
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,170
Send the old man home.

321
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,261
Go back to winterfell.

322
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,013
Take him back.

323
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,642
Theon, don't do this.

324
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,080
- You came back.
- As soon as I heard.

325
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,875
Do you know anything?

326
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,712
- Irri is dead.
- I know.

327
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,049
- She was a good...
- She's dead.

328
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,261
She died alone.
She died for me and I couldn't protect her.

329
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,056
Doreah?

330
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,183
We can't find her.

331
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,227
She must be dead, too.

332
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:02,024
I led my people out of the red waste
and into the slaughterhouse.

333
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,026
I should have been here.

334
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:06,987
You went to find me a ship.

335
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,865
My place is by your side.

336
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,201
I shouldn't have left you alone
with these people.

337
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,286
"These people"?

338
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,288
They are not to be trusted.

339
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,040
And who is to be trusted?

340
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,709
Who are my people?

341
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,962
The targaryens?

342
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,838
I only knew one, my brother,

343
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:28,384
and he would have let a thousand men
rape me if it had got him the crown.

344
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,719
The Dothraki?

345
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:34,598
Most of them turned on me the day
that khal drogo fell from his horse.

346
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,517
Your people are in Westeros.

347
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,103
The people in Westeros
don't know I'm alive.

348
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,146
- They will soon enough.
- And then what?

349
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,315
They'll pray for my return?

350
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,734
They'll wave dragon banners
and shout my name?

351
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,154
That's what my brother believed
and he was a fool.

352
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,573
You are not your brother.

353
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,409
Trust me, khaleesi.

354
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,661
There it is.

355
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,746
"Trust me."

356
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,083
And it's you I should trust, ser jorah?

357
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:02,668
Only you?

358
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,298
I don't need trust any longer.

359
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,885
I don't want it and I
don't have room for it.

360
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:16,056
- You are too young to be so...
- And you are too familiar.

361
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,938
Forgive me, khaleesi.

362
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:28,902
No one can survive in this world
without help. No one.

363
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,822
Let me help you, please.

364
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,450
Tell me how.

365
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,203
Find my dragons.

366
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,505
Ygritte: How long till we
get back to your crows?

367
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,134
We're close.

368
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,970
What, a day? A half-day?

369
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,727
You don't know, do you?

370
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:05,230
- Do you even know where they are?
- We're close.

371
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,252
What do you think they'll say
when they hear about you and me?

372
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,278
Nothing happened between you and me.

373
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,823
"I swear it, old master king crow, ser,

374
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,242
"we were only close together for warmth.

375
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:21,830
"And then I felt it,
right up against me backside like a club.

376
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,458
"I can show you the bruise on me tailbone.

377
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,753
"And before I knew what was where,
his... his...

378
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,631
"Well, it was all out in the open,
all angry as you like.

379
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:34,384
"And I didn't want to
want it, but oh, I did!

380
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,679
"And he spread me legs and ruined.

381
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,473
"The shame of it.

382
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,642
"Now I can never marry a perfumed lord.

383
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,353
"What will me poor savage father say?"

384
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:45,687
Turn back around.

385
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,606
"And I thought that we were done,
but he said,

386
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,691
"'Turn back around."'

387
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,861
I'll tell you what, Jon snow.

388
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,906
Since it's gonna be your word against mine,

389
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,742
and since you can't
talk about it without blushing,

390
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,203
we may as well just...

391
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,456
What, right here in the muck?

392
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,209
I'll keep you warm enough.

393
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,088
Are you that afraid of it?

394
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:13,214
That's enough.

395
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:14,883
It's nice

396
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,802
and wet

397
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:18,554
and warm.

398
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:19,888
Enough!

399
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,933
It don't have teeth.

400
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,401
All right!

401
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:34,903
All right.

402
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,031
Gods, you're dull.

403
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,612
Should have took me
while you had the chance.

404
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,125
No, no!

405
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,188
No. Oh, no.

406
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,165
It's all right. Give me that.

407
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:14,253
If the queen sees,
I can have Joffrey's children now.

408
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,004
Help me flip it over.

409
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,565
- Where are you going?
- To tell her grace.

410
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,945
You'll say nothing to anyone.

411
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,113
Do you understand?

412
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,637
Your mother might have prepared you.

413
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,723
You flowered, my dear. No more.

414
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:11,393
My mother told me,
but I thought it would be different.

415
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,477
In what way?

416
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:15,439
I thought it would be less...

417
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,066
Less messy.

418
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:21,278
Wait until you birth a child.

419
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,950
You're a woman now.
Do you have any idea what that means?

420
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:30,037
I'm fit to bear children for the king?

421
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,831
A prospect that once delighted you,

422
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,334
bringing little princes and princesses
into the world,

423
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,587
the greatest honor for a queen.

424
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,385
Joffrey has always been difficult.

425
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,849
Even his birth, I labored a day and a half
to bring him into this world.

426
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,100
You cannot imagine the pain.

427
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,730
I screamed so loudly, I was sure
Robert would hear me in the kingswood.

428
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,399
His grace was not with you?

429
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:00,650
Robert was hunting.

430
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:02,986
That was his custom.

431
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,116
Whenever my time was near,

432
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:15,082
my royal husband would flee to the trees
with his huntsmen and his hounds.

433
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:20,420
And when he returned, he would present me
with some pelts or a stag's head,

434
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,653
and I would present him with a baby.

435
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,386
Not that I wanted him there, mind you.

436
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:31,473
I had grand maester pycelle,
an army of midwives, and I had my brother.

437
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,477
When they told Jaime
he wasn't allowed in the birthing room,

438
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,312
he smiled

439
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,649
and asked which one of them
proposed to keep him out.

440
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,613
Joffrey will show you no such devotion.

441
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,535
You may never love the king,

442
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,495
but you will love his children.

443
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,456
I love his grace with all my heart.

444
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,668
That's so very touching to hear.

445
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:09,010
Permit me to share some womanly wisdom
with you on this very special day.

446
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:12,305
The more people you love,
the weaker you are.

447
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,935
You'll do things for them
that you know you shouldn't do.

448
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,772
You'll act the fool to make them happy,
to keep them safe.

449
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,986
Love no one but your children.

450
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,363
On that front, a mother has no choice.

451
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,952
But shouldn't I love Joffrey, your grace?

452
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,373
You can try,

453
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,543
little dove.

454
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:00,061
Who did you say your mother was again?

455
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,147
Cinda Lannister.

456
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,648
Is she the fat one?

457
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,752
Well, perhaps she's
gotten a little larger than she...

458
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,988
No, no. There's only one fat Lannister.

459
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,491
If she was your mother, you'd know it.

460
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,454
I squired for you once, you know.

461
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:20,582
When?

462
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,835
The tournament,
the day of willem frey's wedding.

463
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,005
I went to willem frey's wedding?

464
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,465
You did.

465
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,302
Your squire had gotten so drunk
the night before that he threw up.

466
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:35,972
He threw up on his horse on the way to
the tourney grounds. What was his name?

467
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,558
Bryan.

468
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:40,769
Poor lad.

469
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,688
That was my brother's
doing, I seem to recall.

470
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,526
I remember you.

471
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,446
You'd never squired for anyone before.

472
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,658
That's right. I ran up and volunteered.
"Let me, my lord. Let me."

473
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,495
My father was furious.

474
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:03,333
Afraid I'd embarrass our family
in front of the family.

475
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,795
You didn't, though.

476
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:08,922
You really remember?

477
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:13,301
You knew when you were needed
and when to go away. It's a rare talent.

478
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,137
Most of my squires,

479
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:20,892
they mean well, but young men
with big jobs, they tend to overdo them.

480
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,812
- When I think back to that day...
- Shh!

481
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,322
You were saying?

482
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,953
Never mind. It's embarrassing.

483
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:44,416
More embarrassing than being chained
to a post covered in your own shit?

484
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:48,169
I remember everything about that day,

485
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,380
your helmet, your horse,

486
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,508
the rake lines in the dirt along the list,

487
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:57,596
where the sun was in the sky when
you knocked balon Swann from his horse,

488
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,515
and the dent in your shield
when you handed it back to me.

489
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,728
I'll remember it all until I die.

490
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,024
That was the best day of my life.

491
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,739
And I remember being on the field
after it was over.

492
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:19,242
All the competitors were done.
I was the last one out there.

493
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:22,829
And I couldn't leave.

494
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:28,501
I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my
family at a table so far on the edge of the feast

495
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,462
you could barely even see the bride.

496
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:34,591
And I couldn't bear to tell them
what it had been like squiring for you,

497
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:38,094
when I knew that they could never have
the faintest idea what I was talking about.

498
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,598
I understand completely.

499
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,849
How could you?

500
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,396
Sorry, I... ldidn't mean to doubt you.
It's just that I...

501
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,731
I was 16 once.

502
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,611
I also had to replace someone's squire
on short notice.

503
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,237
Which knight was it?

504
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,281
Barristan selmy.

505
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,536
The fight against the kingswood outlaws.
Before your time.

506
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,539
What was he like?

507
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,002
He was...

508
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,172
A painter.

509
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,468
A painter who only used red.

510
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:26,893
I couldn't imagine being able
to fight like that, not back then.

511
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:32,107
And to help him do that,
to be a part of something that perfect.

512
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,653
I don't need to explain how that felt,
not to you.

513
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,698
It's hard to put into words.

514
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,032
It's like

515
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:45,954
stepping into a dream you've been dreaming
for as long as you can remember,

516
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,956
and finding out that the dream

517
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,250
is more real than your life.

518
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,463
Leaving that battlefield was

519
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,633
like being dragged off to prison.

520
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:01,970
- Did you squire for him again?
- No.

521
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,597
I didn't have your gift.

522
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,394
He couldn't take a step
without stepping on me.

523
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,354
I was awful, a complete liability.

524
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:19,529
Until one of the outlaws decided
to take on a 16-year-old squire.

525
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,746
It's a good thing I am who I am.

526
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:31,458
I'd have been useless at anything else.

527
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:39,466
I'm not well-suited for imprisonment.

528
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,009
Shocking, I know.

529
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:42,844
Some men are.

530
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,804
Ned stark,

531
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:49,476
I imagine he made an excellent prisoner
right up until the end.

532
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,603
Not me, though.

533
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:55,815
My life has left me
uniquely unfit for constraint.

534
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,570
And have you thought about...

535
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,405
Of course. Every day.

536
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,282
And?

537
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:10,079
Good prisoners breed good jailers,
apparently.

538
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,248
The starks are very careful.

539
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,211
But there is a way, I think.

540
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,298
It wasn't possible until now.

541
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,717
What is it?

542
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:31,059
- It's actually quite simple.
- Well, let me help you.

543
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,561
You'll only have to do one thing.

544
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:34,979
Tell me.

545
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,068
You'll have to die.

546
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,206
Jorah the andal.

547
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:39,085
This man must sail past old valyria.

548
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:43,631
All who travel too close to the doom
must have protection.

549
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,550
I didn't come here for lessons.

550
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,886
No, you came for the dragons.

551
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:49,596
You have them?

552
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,932
Where are they?

553
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,809
Draw your sword.

554
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,479
See what your steel is worth.

555
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:04,193
You want to please the mother of dragons.

556
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,201
You love her.

557
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,707
Where are the dragons?

558
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,586
Will you betray her again, jorah the andal?

559
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:29,010
Will you betray her again?

560
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:32,889
Never.

561
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,897
The thief you seek

562
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,733
is with her now.

563
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:52,784
I did not leave the comfort of my home
to come to yours and be called a thief.

564
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,702
No one is calling you a thief.

565
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,579
Who is she to accuse us?

566
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:59,791
Please, they're my
children. I'm begging you.

567
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:03,670
Begging us? It wasn't very long ago
you were threatening us.

568
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:06,047
Without me, the dragons will die.

569
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:07,882
It will be for the best.

570
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:12,971
Your dragons will bring the world
nothing but death and misery, my dear.

571
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,848
If I knew where they were,
I would not tell you.

572
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,600
Pyat pree: You are cruel, my friend.

573
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,603
The mother of dragons is in the right.

574
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,648
She must be reunited with her babies.

575
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,735
- I will help you, khaleesi.
- How?

576
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:32,907
I will take you to the house of the undying
where I have put them.

577
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,494
You have my dragons?

578
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:41,541
When I learned you were coming to our city,
I made an arrangement with the king of qarth.

579
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,003
He procured them for me.

580
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,588
But there is no king of qarth.

581
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:50,091
There is now.
That was the other half of the arrangement.

582
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:58,433
You would keep your gates and your minds
closed to everything outside your walls,

583
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:03,604
but qarth cannot remain the greatest city
that ever was if it refuses to change.

584
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:08,609
I will open qarth to the world
as I have forced it to open itself to me.

585
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,447
Your ambition is an inspiration.

586
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,284
But like all upstarts, you overreach.

587
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:21,581
Three dragons the size of cats
and an alliance with a charlatan

588
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,583
do not make you a king.

589
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,044
An upstart and a charlatan?

590
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:28,504
Empires have been built by less.

591
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:33,051
Those on the margins
often come to control the center,

592
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:36,888
and those in the center make room for them,
willingly or othennise.

593
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,479
The mother of dragons
will be with her babies.

594
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,776
She will give them her love
and they will thrive by her side,

595
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:54,864
forever.

596
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:55,948
({Gasps)

597
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,136
A mother should be with her children.

598
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,850
Where will you run to, Daenerys stormborn?

599
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,771
Your dragons wait for you
in the house of the undying.

600
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:28,689
Come see them.

601
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,909
- Lady stark!
- No farther.

602
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:41,953
Keep your hands off me, woman.

603
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:45,164
Don't enter without an invitation, man.

604
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,751
Forgive me. Lady stark.

605
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,420
- Catelyn: What is it?
- They caught the kingslayer.

606
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,593
Kingslayer!

607
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,762
- Kill the fucking kingslayer! Hang him!
- Hang him!

608
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,060
You'll die today.

609
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:07,937
Justice for the karstark.

610
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:22,660
Gut him!

611
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,758
Get back! I want his head!

612
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:43,973
Any man who stands between a father
and his vengeance asks for death.

613
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,558
Lord karstark,

614
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,769
this man is our prisoner.

615
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,147
This monster killed my son.

616
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:52,773
And crippled mine.

617
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:57,028
He will answer for his crimes,
I promise you, but not here.

618
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,447
I will have his head.
And if you try and stop me...

619
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,948
You will strike me down?

620
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,910
Have you forgotten me, ser?

621
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:06,829
I am the widow of your liege,
lord Eddard stark.

622
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,206
I am the mother of your king!

623
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:10,625
- And where is our king now?
- You know very well.

624
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,919
He has gone to the crag
to accept the surrender.

625
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:16,464
Aye, gone to the crag,
but not to negotiate.

626
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,467
- He brought that foreign bitch with him.
- How dare you!

627
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,553
- Threatening my lady is an act of treason.
- Treason?

628
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,764
How can it be treason to kill lannisters?

629
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:28,392
I understand your grief, my lord,
better than most, I understand it.

630
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:32,521
But in the name of my son,
the king in the north,

631
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,023
stand down.

632
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:39,779
When your son returns,
I will demand this murderer's head.

633
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:42,323
Wise men do not make demands of kings.

634
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,825
Fathers who love their sons do.

635
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,328
I will have his head.

636
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:52,959
Thank you for fighting on my behalf,
lady stark.

637
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:55,253
I would have come to your defense, but...

638
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,588
Take him to the stockades.

639
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:59,590
Bind him with every chain you can find!

640
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:01,717
You've become a real she-wolf
in your later years.

641
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,803
There's not much fish left in you.

642
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,304
And gag him!

643
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,312
Since when do you light your own candles?

644
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:18,359
Since I decided that I can't stand to look
at any of my handmaidens for another instant.

645
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:23,197
How many times
can you read one raven scroll?

646
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:29,787
Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted
sailing north past tarth, 200 ships.

647
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:33,291
- More than we have.
- Yes, that's more than we have.

648
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:37,962
He'll be at our gates within five days,
four if he has the wind.

649
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,172
We have strong, high walls.

650
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,592
We'll rain fire down on them from above.

651
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:48,055
"Rain fire on them from above."
You're quoting father, aren't you?

652
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,515
Why not?

653
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,358
He has a good mind
for strategy, doesn't he?

654
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,145
Call it tactics, not strategy.

655
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,480
But, yes, he does have a good mind for it.

656
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:59,775
The best mind, some would say.
Sadly, he's not here.

657
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,112
It's just you, me and Joffrey,

658
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:07,241
the lord of the seven kingdoms
and protector of the realm.

659
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,971
I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.

660
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:13,581
He needs to start acting like a king.

661
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:17,168
This war you started
is coming to our doorstep.

662
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,795
And if the entire city
wants Joffrey dead...

663
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:22,214
I'm not the one
giving the boy whores to abuse.

664
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:24,568
I thought the girls might help him.

665
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,469
- Did you?
- I was wrong.

666
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:31,766
If we can't control him...

667
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,642
Do you think I haven't tried?

668
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,189
He doesn't listen to me.

669
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:45,946
It's hard to put a leash on a dog
once you've put a crown on its head.

670
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,161
I always hoped he'd be like Jaime.

671
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:55,706
He looks like him.

672
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,462
In a certain light.

673
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:06,926
The boy is more Robert than Jaime.

674
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:10,471
Robert was a drunken fool,
but he didn't enjoy cruelty.

675
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,309
Sometimes I wonder.

676
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,228
What?

677
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,648
If this is the price

678
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,567
for what we've done,

679
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,778
for our sins.

680
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:27,655
Sins?

681
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,032
The targaryens...

682
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:32,785
Wed brother and sister
for hundreds of years, I know.

683
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:38,999
That's what Jaime and I would say
to each other in our moments of doubt.

684
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:42,586
It's what I told ned stark
when he was stupid enough to confront me.

685
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:47,800
Half the targaryens went mad, didn't they?

686
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,468
What's the saying?

687
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:52,680
"Every time a Targaryen is born,
the gods flip a coin."

688
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,266
You've beaten the odds.

689
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,854
Tommen and myrcella are good,
decent children, both of them.

690
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,635
Man 1: Then why wait?
Man 2: We're sworn to the king.

691
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:34,054
- There's not a king.
- That's treason.

692
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:36,140
Man 1: So is saving lannisters, yeah?

693
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,058
- Back off, you.
- No, I won't.

694
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:41,729
Your son returns at dawn, my lady?

695
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,272
So they say.

696
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,155
Brienne: The kingslayer
won't last the night.

697
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,819
The more they drink,
the angrier they'll get.

698
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,947
And when the karstarks draw their swords...

699
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,242
Who wants to die defending a Lannister?

700
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:57,745
Come.

701
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:05,961
Man: He'll not be
making it through the night.

702
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,305
I need to be alone with him.

703
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:20,142
- My lady, our orders...
- Your orders, which I just gave you,

704
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:22,520
are to leave me alone with him.

705
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,777
Come to say goodbye, lady stark?

706
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:33,447
I believe it's my last night in this world.

707
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:36,075
Is that a woman?

708
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,494
Do you hear them out there?

709
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:40,788
They want your head.

710
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:45,376
Old lord karstark doesn't seem to like me.

711
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,295
You strangled his son with your chains.

712
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,130
Oh. Oh.

713
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:52,341
Was he the one on guard duty?

714
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,679
He was in my way.

715
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:59,807
- Any knight would have done the same.
- You are no knight.

716
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:03,227
You have forsaken every vow you ever took.

717
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,812
So many vows.

718
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,814
They make you swear and swear.

719
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:11,151
Defend the king, obey the king,
obey your father,

720
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:14,154
protect the innocent, defend the weak.

721
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:17,533
But what if your father despises the king?

722
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:21,662
What if the king massacres the innocent?

723
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,789
It's too much.

724
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:27,960
No matter what you do,
you're forsaking one vow or another.

725
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,588
Where did you find this beast?

726
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:34,758
She is a truer knight
than you will ever be,

727
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,470
- kingslayer.
- Kingslayer.

728
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,057
What a king he was.

729
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,769
Here's to aerys Targaryen,
the second of his name,

730
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,897
lord of the seven kingdoms,
protector of the realm,

731
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,151
and to the sword I shoved in his back.

732
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,655
You are a man without honor.

733
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:00,242
Do you know,

734
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:03,704
I've never been with any woman but Cersei.

735
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:05,956
So in my own way,

736
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,667
I have more honor than

737
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,171
poor old dead ned.

738
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,216
What was the name of
that bastard he fathered?

739
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,344
- Bnenne.
- No, that wasn't it.

740
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:23,140
Snow, a bastard from the north.

741
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:29,271
Now, when... when good old ned
came home with some whore's baby,

742
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:32,024
did you pretend to love it?

743
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,571
You're not very good at pretending.

744
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:39,615
You're an honest woman.

745
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,826
You hated that boy, didn't you?

746
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,788
How could you not hate him?

747
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,248
The walking, talking reminder

748
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:52,044
that the honorable lord Eddard stark

749
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,046
fucked another woman.

750
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:58,509
Your sword.

751
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,350
I told you what would happen.

752
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,269
All of you.

753
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,899
I told you what would happen
if you served me loyally.

754
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,528
And what would happen if you did not.

755
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,656
What are you doing? What have you done?

756
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:24,576
If there are any who still question
whether your new lord means what he says,

757
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,456
here is the answer to your question.
