ORIGINAL STORY WEBTOON SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

00:00:56,139 --> 00:01:03,146
SWEET HOME

3
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,038
I'm not going to shoot.

4
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,082
I'll just take the kid.

5
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,636
-Yi-kyung. It's me, Eun-yu.
-Get away from her!

6
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,307
Get over here.

7
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:40,975
Now!

8
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,145
See you around.

9
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:09,671
Yi-kyung.

10
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,506
I'm not going in there.

11
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:12,841
And I don't need your help.

12
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,094
Pretend you never saw me.

13
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,053
Wait.

14
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,972
I need to ask you something.

15
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,265
Wait!

16
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,475
Wait. No.

17
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,771
It's dangerous. Don't go.

18
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,773
I told you I'd kill you if you stopped me.

19
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,419
My baby…

20
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:54,090
My precious baby…

21
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,430
Are you still sick?

22
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,434
No, I'm not.

23
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,061
Yeah.

24
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:08,980
You are.

25
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,732
You always are.

26
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,109
And that makes me sad.

27
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,361
I know.

28
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,363
But…

29
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,617
I'm all better now.

30
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,328
I'm not coughing up blood anymore

31
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,787
and my stomach doesn't hurt.

32
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,333
Look, my teeth grew back too.

33
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,169
I'm all better now.

34
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,549
I need to…

35
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,010
help you.

36
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,306
No, I can do it.

37
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,851
Jun-il…

38
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,521
I'll do anything to fix you!

39
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,357
I…

40
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,318
got you your medicine.

41
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,820
HERBICIDE

42
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,197
Jun-il, this is…

43
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,450
If you die, you won't feel sick anymore.

44
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,703
What's wrong?

45
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,538
I'm all better now.

46
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:11,834
You go back and forth all the time.

47
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,046
You get better and then get sick again.

48
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,175
You're always like that.

49
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,681
Jun-il…

50
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,142
I'm telling you, I'm all better now.

51
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:29,978
Mom.

52
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,064
It'll all be over when you die.

53
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,567
I can do it.

54
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,027
I'm a good boy.

55
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,196
Jun-il, get a hold of yourself.

56
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:46,953
Drink it.

57
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,706
Jun-il…

58
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,042
Be quiet and drink it.

59
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,644
Mom.

60
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:15,982
Mom?

61
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,237
Are you dead?

62
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,450
You're not sick anymore, right?

63
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,135
Look, I did it.

64
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,764
Good job.

65
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,534
Why aren't you dead?

66
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,704
Why aren't you dead?

67
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,664
Why are you still alive?

68
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,918
If you don't die, you'll be sick!

69
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,503
Die!

70
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,213
Die!

71
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,924
Just die already!

72
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,802
Die!

73
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,720
Die!

74
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,140
Die!

75
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,729
Jun-il.

76
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,025
I'm sorry…

77
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,447
I was such a burden.

78
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,202
Damn it!

79
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,871
God damn it!

80
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,237
You won't find her in the dark.

81
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,280
She's already--

82
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,408
Let go!

83
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,701
Let go of me!

84
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,953
I said let go!

85
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,915
Let go!

86
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,254
I finally met her.

87
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,256
I can't let her go like this.

88
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,592
So stop getting in the way.

89
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,553
I swear I'll kill you
if you follow me again.

90
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:45,900
Wait.

91
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,436
Let go.

92
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,479
No.

93
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,648
Let go or we'll both die.

94
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,857
Hold on tight!

95
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,277
I'll pull you up on three.

96
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,945
Get your feet on the sides and hold on.

97
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:41,956
Wait.

98
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,779
There's something at the bottom.

99
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,947
Watch out.

100
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,533
I'll let go…

101
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,327
on three.

102
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,870
Stay close to the sides.

103
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,665
One, two, three.

104
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,016
It was Oh Jun-il.

105
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,937
I just wanted to stimulate him.
I didn't know he'd explode like this.

106
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,357
The blood sample
showed signs of monsterization,

107
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,484
but he had absolutely no symptoms.

108
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,153
There were signs of monsterization,

109
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,823
but no symptoms
such as nosebleeds or hallucinations.

110
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,618
I should've been more careful with him.

111
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:45,621
I finally found a specimen
and I got too excited like an idiot.

112
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:47,998
That's enough.

113
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,713
You must be mistaken.

114
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,631
What?

115
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,975
Oh Jun-il came to see his mom.

116
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,603
But the symptomatic individual
succumbed to monsterization

117
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,981
and killed her own son during her rampage.

118
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,568
You, doctor, saw and reported it,

119
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,570
and the Platoon subdued her.

120
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:18,904
Is that right?

121
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,574
Who have I been talking to?

122
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,034
Do you have trouble hearing?

123
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,620
You want me to explain it again?

124
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,748
Oh Jun-il became a monster
without any symptoms.

125
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:30,666
So what?

126
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,710
He's unlike any case we've ever seen.

127
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,715
Monsterization in itself
is beyond our understanding.

128
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,512
When you dragged me out here

129
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,765
and built me a fancy research facility,

130
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,351
I assumed you had some great purpose.

131
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,145
Was it all for show?

132
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,482
You're only half right.

133
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,485
I can see it in your face.

134
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,614
What's the big picture you have in mind?

135
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,909
Why do you think I kept you alive?

136
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,787
You're the symbol of hope…

137
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,665
that humans haven't given up yet.

138
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,002
That we may overcome this eventually.

139
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:18,047
-That's not the truth.
-The truth doesn't matter.

140
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,007
What matters is what you believe.

141
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,762
Don't shake their faith.

142
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,263
Or everything will fall apart.

143
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,102
Fuck.

144
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,302
Get on.

145
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,346
I was just trying to find him.

146
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,558
Aren't you coming?

147
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,268
Not until I find him.

148
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,313
Then why did you go there?

149
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,817
Why did you go where people were?

150
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,142
Don't.

151
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,257
Has it already been a month?

152
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,510
Just hang in there.

153
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,096
We're almost there.

154
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,806
Mom.

155
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,352
Mom?

156
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,396
Did you sleep here?

157
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,565
You didn't get much sleep.
I can see it on your face.

158
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,070
What are your hands for?

159
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,405
Are they just for putting on makeup?

160
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,323
Don't you know how to knock?

161
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:32,741
I…

162
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,411
I was just worried about you.

163
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,664
You can enter my room, but not here.

164
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,750
I'm warning you.

165
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,460
I'm serious.

166
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,630
Okay.

167
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,550
Go.

168
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,801
It's time for roll call.

169
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,349
Today's infectee banishment
has been canceled.

170
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,185
An infectee went through
monsterization last night,

171
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,520
and the Platoon subdued her.

172
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,606
Please do not be alarmed

173
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,442
and prepare for the roll call.

174
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:07,943
Over.

175
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,498
Did you catch her?

176
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,584
Sorry?

177
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,628
Yes.

178
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:31,967
It's all thanks to the Platoon
that we can sleep in peace.

179
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,929
It's nothing to be so excited about.

180
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,307
Excuse me?

181
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,268
A person died.

182
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,565
But it's a monster, not a person.

183
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,110
It's a fine line.

184
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,529
You're one unhealed wound away
from being treated the same.

185
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:56,658
Let's go.

186
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:57,993
Okay.

187
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,422
What was that all about?
Did you hear anything?

188
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,340
Not sure.

189
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,092
Must have been the night shift.

190
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,011
They would've told us.
They always brag about killing monsters.

191
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,055
If Tak said it happened, it happened.

192
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,431
He wouldn't make stuff up.

193
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:21,767
Maybe he is.

194
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,684
Hey.

195
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,937
Watch what you say, will you?

196
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,940
Can't you see
that we're being kept out of the loop?

197
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,652
I don't trust anyone
other than Sergeant Kim.

198
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,654
How can you say that?

199
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:34,863
Come confess your sins.

200
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:41,036
Confessions are a great excuse
to talk behind someone's back.

201
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,139
What happened?

202
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,268
She was supposed to be
released this morning.

203
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,314
She was supposed to be released
after meeting Jun-il!

204
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,653
Promises hardly mean anything these days.

205
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,823
What the hell?

206
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,284
What happened here?

207
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,829
Tell me what happened.

208
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,374
Do you know what this is?

209
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,459
It's Jun-il.

210
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,379
If I told you, would you believe me?

211
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,009
You said I'm the least
trustworthy person here.

212
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,139
You do have great insight.

213
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,727
Why are you getting
so worked up about her?

214
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,729
You weren't even that close.

215
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:49,730
Am I wrong?

216
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,319
Who am I talking to?

217
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,824
A girl?

218
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:01,742
Yes.

219
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,327
Ring any bells?

220
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:04,953
Not at all.

221
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,955
Are you sure?

222
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,711
Yong-seok would have told me about her.

223
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:17,007
So he didn't leave to escape then, right?

224
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:19,635
We should get him then.

225
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,802
I'll get the boys--

226
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,556
-It hasn't been approved.
-What?

227
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,684
What are you…

228
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,396
I have to see the Master Sergeant.

229
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,731
Hey, Seo-jin.

230
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:33,649
What?

231
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,193
Don't tell me you agree with him.

232
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,819
No, we need to find Yong-seok.

233
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,029
So what's the issue?

234
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,286
The Platoon only acts for the public good.

235
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,414
Yong-seok didn't go missing.

236
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,582
He went AWOL.

237
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,419
It's nothing more
than a personal mishap as of now.

238
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,629
So we abandon him?

239
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,881
You said he'd be here.

240
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,759
You said we could go back to find him!

241
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:01,802
Look, man.

242
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,096
I only came back because I trusted you.

243
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,472
If I knew this would happen…

244
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,225
I would've stayed back to find him.

245
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,561
We could lose all of our men
if we go out in this situation.

246
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,439
Yong-seok has the radio
and the transmitter with him.

247
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,986
Let's talk about finding him
when we get a signal.

248
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,780
You're a coward.

249
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,033
You're no different from Tak.

250
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,250
Out of my way.

251
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,006
Sergeant Kim.

252
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,008
Chan-yeong has gone missing.

253
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,677
There was also a problem
during the roll call.

254
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,098
There must be an exit we don't know about.

255
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,440
Search the whole stadium
with a team of survivors.

256
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,983
If you find it, block it off.

257
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:58,984
Yes, sir.

258
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,160
Do Sang-jin, An Dong-gi, Lee Eun-yu,

259
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,870
and Park Chan-yeong are missing.

260
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,331
Did they miss the roll call?

261
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,333
Yes, they all went missing.

262
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,503
Do Sang-jin and An Dong-gi
were unhappy with the expedition ban.

263
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,672
And Lee Eun-yu seems to have left
due to her circumstances.

264
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,425
But the main gate was never opened.

265
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,052
There must be another way out.

266
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,345
We'll find it and block it off.

267
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,263
All right, go ahead.

268
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,601
Cooperate with Chief Ji
to block off the exit.

269
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,894
And keep your eyes on the workers.

270
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:34,811
Sarge.

271
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,940
Will you keep letting Chan-yeong
do whatever he wants?

272
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,318
We can take disciplinary action
when he comes back.

273
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,446
Where's Min?

274
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,782
He won't leave the barracks, sir.

275
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,537
Go and find the exit first.

276
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,206
Yes, sir.

277
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,711
Are you Sergeant First Class Kim?

278
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,800
Please…

279
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,260
find Yong-seok.

280
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:42,671
Did you find it?

281
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,923
We're still searching.

282
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,134
So why are you here?

283
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,472
Three people left the stadium yesterday.

284
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,143
Do you know where and why they escaped?

285
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,311
Are you accusing me of something?

286
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,479
I wouldn't know.

287
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,772
I have no reason to hide anything.

288
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:06,278
You said there was no other exit
besides the main gate.

289
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:11,324
And now we're looking for
that nonexistent exit.

290
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,703
Master Sergeant Tak.

291
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,749
How much time do you spend
watching the CCTV every day?

292
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,920
You seem like you want to know
everything about this place.

293
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,464
The desire to be omniscient

294
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,592
is the beginning of dictatorship.

295
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:32,179
Although it seems you've begun already.

296
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,937
And what do you call it
when you withhold information

297
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,607
and put everyone in danger?

298
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,945
I know you're an important figure here.

299
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:49,988
But that doesn't mean

300
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,657
you can do as you like.

301
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,327
Is this a threat?

302
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,996
I'm asking for your cooperation.

303
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,211
Let me know if you change your mind.

304
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,710
She's probably dead, right?

305
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,128
Who?

306
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,965
The troublemaker from that family.

307
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,974
I'm talking about
the previous troublemaker, Lee Eun-yu.

308
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,476
Well, who knows?

309
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,936
She's tough as nails.

310
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,189
They're causing us so much trouble.

311
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,441
Just pretend you're looking.

312
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,902
If the Platoon can't find it, how can we?

313
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:11,945
Oh, right.

314
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,990
The Platoon's youngest soldier
disappeared with her.

315
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,867
Come to think of it,

316
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,287
it looked like those two
already knew each other.

317
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,413
Is that so?

318
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,622
Now that you mention it,

319
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,710
there was something
about the way he looked at her.

320
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,212
They must have eloped.

321
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,673
My goodness.

322
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,883
Even at a time like this, love prevails.

323
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,011
Why would they even elope?

324
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,264
It's not like the Platoon
forbids relationships.

325
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,600
That's true.

326
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,228
So they didn't elope then.

327
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,688
Of course not!

328
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,818
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've heard in my entire life.

329
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,362
Why would you ship
Chan-yeong with that crazy bitch?

330
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:59,075
Well, they disappeared around the same--

331
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,201
Shut up!

332
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,038
If I ever hear that nonsense again,

333
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,457
I'll make you pay for it.

334
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:11,671
They definitely eloped.

335
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:13,840
They ran away from her.

336
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,133
Be quiet.

337
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,181
Mom.

338
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,558
Mom.

339
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:26,770
Mom!

340
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,814
Mom, where the hell is Lee Eun-yu?

341
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,024
Damn it.

342
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,718
This is how they do it in movies.

343
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,520
-What are you doing?
-Mom.

344
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:09,646
Were you inside?

345
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,149
I heard some noise inside,
so I was worried about you.

346
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,068
I told you not to come here.

347
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,779
Right, I forgot.

348
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:23,701
I'm just so upset
about Chan-yeong and Eun-yu.

349
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:24,619
I'm sorry.

350
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,959
I've coddled you long enough.

351
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:34,045
I let you use my name
to lord it over others.

352
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:37,507
But there isn't a line you won't cross.

353
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,968
-Mom…
-Get out.

354
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:42,762
Go.

355
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,684
Get out!

356
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,196
Mom.

357
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,991
Mom, I'm sorry.

358
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,785
Mom, I'm sorry.
I promise I won't do it again.

359
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,705
Mom, please don't abandon me.

360
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,039
Mom!

361
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,055
You shouldn't have followed me.

362
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,767
I had to know your secret.

363
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:30,769
It could have…

364
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,105
endangered the stadium.

365
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,815
Why would you risk your life
to protect it?

366
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,860
We just happen to be stuck in there.
Is it that important to you?

367
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,904
We have nowhere else.

368
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,531
To the survivors,

369
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,242
the stadium is their last home.

370
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,286
And it's the Platoon's job to protect it.

371
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,287
Whatever.

372
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:50,955
It's your funeral.

373
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,208
-I don't give a crap.
-You risked your life too.

374
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,628
You and I are no different.

375
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,427
Stay still.

376
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,319
Lift it up.

377
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:30,662
I'm never telling you.

378
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,080
I know.

379
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,041
You believe it's right to hide it.

380
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,211
So hide it.

381
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:42,590
And I'll do what I can to find out.

382
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,503
The day Mr. Kim died…

383
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,631
What you saw that day…

384
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,843
Was it really a monster?

385
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,096
It wasn't human.

386
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,392
That's fine.

387
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,228
I'm okay with that.

388
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,859
I initially thought

389
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,904
the monster killed both you and Mr. Kim.

390
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:47,697
But…

391
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,325
only Mr. Kim died.

392
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,620
And you survived.

393
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,045
You're right.

394
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,508
Something out there is protecting me.

395
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,260
Who is it?

396
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,054
I don't know.

397
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,389
They won't show themselves.

398
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,646
I'm just choosing to believe
that it's a certain person.

399
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,814
Who would that be?

400
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:27,820
I wish…

401
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,532
I wish I could see him just once.

402
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,455
Seeing how hard he's trying to avoid me…

403
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,542
I wonder if I shouldn't try to see him.

404
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,131
He probably has a good reason.

405
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:56,683
But I'm ready to accept him for who he is.

406
00:32:58,685 --> 00:32:59,936
So just once…

407
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,646
No.

408
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:03,690
If it's fate…

409
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,025
you'll meet him.

410
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,087
Who's that?

411
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,506
Who's out there?

412
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:29,924
What if it's a monster?

413
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,343
As if a monster would throw us a rope.

414
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:53,990
Let me help.

415
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,284
All right.

416
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,452
One, two, three.

417
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,538
On my shoulder.

418
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:50,797
Help me.

419
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,346
You're not leaving me here, are you?

420
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:00,973
Promise me.

421
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,850
What?

422
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,271
Promise you won't follow me
or ask any questions.

423
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,024
I can't promise that.

424
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,610
You're not in a position to say that.

425
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,445
I can't make a promise I can't keep.

426
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:27,291
Fine, do whatever you want.

427
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:28,668
Grab it.

428
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,794
Hey.

429
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,673
Wait, something's out here.

430
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,553
Hurry up.

431
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:54,879
What the hell?

432
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,049
It's gasoline.

433
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,427
Watch out!

434
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,285
You're still alive.

435
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,500
You're the moles from the stadium.

436
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,460
You remember me, right?

437
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,255
From that bus to the shelter.

438
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,049
Of course.

439
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,467
I almost died, thanks to you.

440
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,596
Go back to where you came from
and don't go poking your noses around.

441
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,514
Dad.

442
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:51,143
Can we ditch that minx and keep him?

443
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,438
You want to take him?

444
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,607
-Yeah.
-What are you doing?

445
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,277
Can you even walk properly?

446
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,238
I don't need more mouths to feed.
Be on your way.

447
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,448
I think she has different ideas.

448
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:18,963
What are you doing?

449
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,673
I don't trust you.

450
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,595
Put it down while I'm being nice.

451
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,847
This?

452
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,098
You want it back?

453
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,684
I'll trade you for it.

454
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:33,311
Let me keep him.

455
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,187
Are you dense?

456
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,522
Don't you understand Korean?

457
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,190
You can take him!

458
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,108
Hey.

459
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,361
You need to pay for ruining my trap.

460
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,947
This is a straight-up robbery.

461
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,033
I'll open the door tomorrow,
so see yourselves out.

462
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,035
And don't ever come back.

463
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,746
-Ha-ni.
-What?

464
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,706
Let's go now.

465
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,292
On my way, boss.

466
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,753
-On my way.
-Untie me.

467
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,171
Now.

468
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:02,089
Hey!

469
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,385
Open up! I'm leaving now!

470
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,805
What difference does it make
if I leave today or tomorrow?

471
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:10,723
Open up!

472
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:18,647
Hey.

473
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,525
What?

474
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:25,321
Did you mean it?

475
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,031
When you told her

476
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,325
to take me away?

477
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,915
Just sleep.

478
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,544
This is crazy.

479
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,296
Absolutely crazy.

480
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,804
RUBBING ALCOHOL

481
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,555
There's nothing I can do now.

482
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,850
I'll feel worse if I think about it.

483
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,602
But still…

484
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,688
Oh Jun-il's monsterization…

485
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,402
It progressed way too quickly.

486
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,405
There weren't any symptoms either.

487
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,240
Damn it!

488
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,743
Stop thinking about it.

489
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,497
Just forget it.

490
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,084
Just empty your mind.

491
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,503
Don't think about anything.

492
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,303
Was it because of the wound?

493
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,641
GIRL, MOM, FLOWERS, TREE, STIMULATION

494
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:42,565
Don't you remember?

495
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,525
A kid.

496
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:45,860
Jun-il…

497
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,028
There was a kid…

498
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,530
What on earth did you see?

499
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,490
…where there were flowers

500
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:54,535
-and trees.
-Was it human?

501
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,455
-It was a girl.
-Was it a monster?

502
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:01,250
She pushed.

503
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:02,960
Or was it…

504
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:21,854
Mom.

505
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,192
Are you okay?

506
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,277
I'm fine.

507
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,410
Are you still afraid of me?

508
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,209
Because I hurt you back then?

509
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:32,925
Get inside.

510
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,096
No, I've done nothing wrong.

511
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,597
I'm trying to protect you.

512
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,723
Protect me?

513
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,183
You?

514
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,685
You're lying.

515
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:43,852
About everything.

516
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,522
You're just like them.

517
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:50,818
Did you…

518
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,071
meet people again?

519
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,659
Did you use your hands…

520
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,620
to turn them into monsters?

521
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,501
What's wrong with that?

522
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,212
They became nicer.

523
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,216
It happened again.

524
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:16,969
You did it again.

525
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,765
Why did you do it?

526
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,226
That's why I locked you up.
It was for your own sake.

527
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,312
To stop you from doing this again!

528
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,563
Let go!

529
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,893
Stay in here.

530
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,904
Is the monster dead?

531
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,531
It probably isn't.

532
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:24,865
You okay, man?

533
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,450
Hey.

534
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:27,409
Hey!

535
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:33,332
Hey.

536
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:49,890
Mom…

537
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,151
No!

538
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:50,993
Stop it!

539
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,128
Stop it!

540
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,471
Why did you do that?

541
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,433
-It was a monster.
-Would you do the same to me?

542
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:15,350
No.

543
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:16,977
-Why would I--
-Because I'm a monster.

544
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,688
That's what you think too.

545
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,360
You said I wasn't,
but I'm different from you.

546
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:27,321
I know everything.

547
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,451
That's not true.

548
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:34,578
I didn't give birth to a monster.

549
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:35,996
Is that so?

550
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,790
"You were a mistake."

551
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,501
"You're a monster."

552
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,088
"I'm afraid of you."

553
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,302
What are you talking about?

554
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:52,054
"I wish you would disappear."

555
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,016
-No.
-"I can't abandon you,

556
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,392
so you should abandon me."

557
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,145
"Please go where I can't find you."

558
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:02,814
No.

559
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,566
You've been thinking that all along.

560
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:39,513
What are you doing?

561
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,348
You want to follow my brother?

562
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,309
Is he your brother,
your dad, or your boss?

563
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:45,936
Pick a lane.

564
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,480
Let's just say he's my savior.

565
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:50,857
So?

566
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,527
Are you going or not?

567
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,390
You're awake.

568
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:30,146
Where's the girl I came with?

569
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,189
I don't know.

570
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,193
She left earlier.

571
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,284
Where's my gun?

572
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,578
-Why?
-I have to go back now.

573
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,664
Listen.

574
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,334
If you try to walk around too soon,

575
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,920
you'll have to amputate your leg.

576
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:57,966
I'm familiar with these injuries.

577
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,051
It's not that bad.

578
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,014
Do I look like a doormat?

579
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,056
Excuse me?

580
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:10,020
I feed you, I give you a place to sleep,

581
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:13,315
I even care for your wound,
and now you're just going to leave?

582
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:15,025
Where are your manners?

583
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,576
Is that how it works in your country?

584
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,954
Aren't we from the same country?

585
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:28,955
No.

586
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,751
I'm from outer space.

587
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,130
Right.

588
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:43,762
Thank you for your help.

589
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:45,013
I'll repay you someday.

590
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,515
But I have to go now.

591
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:50,435
Fine.

592
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:52,145
But…

593
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,522
you should eat before you go.

594
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:03,990
Eat up.

595
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:08,203
What is this made of?

596
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:10,914
You think you're at a restaurant?

597
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,917
Just eat what you're given.

598
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,835
It doesn't look edible.

599
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,921
Are you worried it'll kill you?

600
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,057
See?

601
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,728
Don't ask for seconds.

602
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:37,190
Okay, thank you.

603
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:29,325
Oh, my.

604
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,910
Oh, my.

605
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,459
What took you so long?

606
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:40,086
Stop slacking off!

607
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,380
Don't you see all of this?

608
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,216
I'm doing all the hard work for you.

609
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:50,680
You're quite carefree, aren't you?

610
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,183
Aren't you worried about the girl?

611
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:54,809
You came here together.

612
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:59,856
You're a cold son of a bitch, aren't you?

613
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:00,982
God damn it!

614
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:04,903
Why would I worry about her
when she's the one who chose to leave?

615
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:07,113
I've got nothing to do with her!

616
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,574
I don't know all the details,

617
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:13,078
but I heard she was the reason
Chief Ji let you work here.

618
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,496
You should be grateful.

619
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,708
Keep living with such a nasty heart,

620
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,668
and you'll turn into a monster.

621
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:25,548
Grateful, my ass.

622
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,302
Damn it.

623
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:31,429
This isn't good.

624
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,057
This isn't going to last long.

625
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:37,685
Those bastards in the Platoon
aren't what they used to be.

626
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,729
You better watch your mouths.

627
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,941
You motherfuckers.

628
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,118
Hey, you.

629
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,329
The people who used to work here

630
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,457
got fired because they ran their mouths.

631
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,012
Excuse me.

632
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:17,100
You can't just take things like that.

633
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,894
We risked our damn lives for this stuff!

634
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:24,816
You can't tell us what to do.

635
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:26,401
Okay.

636
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,745
-Not again, sir.
-You saw nothing.

637
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,205
Of course.

638
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,748
But if they report it to Tak--

639
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:41,833
For fuck's sake!

640
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:44,085
Let them!
Then I could get the hell out of here!

641
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:45,003
Come on, Sarge.

642
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,254
Someone might hear you.

643
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,882
People are already joking
about deserters being a trend.

644
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,259
Who the hell said that?

645
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:54,679
Yong-seok is different
from that buck Private Park Chan-yeong.

646
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,640
Motherfuckers.

647
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,393
They're only alive because of us!

648
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,481
Ungrateful assholes, babbling away.

649
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,234
Sergeant Kim's been
looking for you all day.

650
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:09,944
Tell him to fuck off.

651
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,031
Dying here won't get me
a medal or a hero's funeral.

652
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:16,576
We just do meaningless shit
until we all drop dead.

653
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,369
Fuck this shit.

654
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:23,458
This one's going to last a while.

655
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,274
Aren't you going to look for Yong-seok?

656
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:52,529
How did you get in here?

657
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:58,409
Why aren't you going to rescue him?

658
00:58:58,493 --> 00:58:59,869
He's part of the Platoon.

659
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,287
He said you were family.

660
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,748
That's what he thought of you.

661
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:09,003
You let him go.

662
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:12,131
You should've stopped him.

663
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,385
You knew he could die.

664
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,304
So why did you let him go?

665
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,307
You're sick, right?

666
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,893
What did you need?

667
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:25,186
Why the hell did he…

668
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,774
disappear without saying a word?

669
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,027
I needed medicine.

670
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,530
I know my condition is terminal,

671
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:37,240
but I wanted some more time.

672
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,034
That's why I let him go.

673
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:41,578
I tried to stop him.

674
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,496
But Yong-seok

675
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,707
insisted he would go.

676
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:47,917
He said he'd get it for me!

677
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:48,918
Is that so wrong?

678
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,045
So bring him back.

679
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,756
Bring Yong-seok back!

680
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:56,801
What do you really want?

681
00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:00,013
Him, or the medicine
that he might bring back?

682
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,347
Does that really matter?

683
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,224
Is that your answer?

684
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,712
BAMSEOM

685
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:34,357
Hypocrite.

686
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,247
You're not real.

687
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:50,915
Of course not.

688
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:53,292
The real me died that day.

689
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:56,546
The moment you strangled your own family.

690
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,382
How did it feel?

691
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,426
You enjoyed it, didn't you?

692
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:11,352
I know you enjoy…

693
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:13,396
killing people.

694
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,857
It's what you do best.

695
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:20,528
Just do it.

696
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:23,698
You have nothing to live for.

697
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:31,289
I do.

698
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:32,582
What?

699
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:33,666
I still have…

700
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:47,054
things to do!

701
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,947
No.

702
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:12,121
It's PTSD.

703
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,624
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

704
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,211
It's the only explanation.

705
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:20,630
Am I right?

706
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,512
I think I could help you out.

707
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:35,144
I don't like making petty threats.

708
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:38,689
But there are other names for it
such as deal,

709
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:40,066
transaction,

710
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,361
and even negotiation.

711
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:46,239
What do you want?

712
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:50,326
Let me out of here.

713
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:05,610
Do you understand
the significance of Jun-il's case?

714
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:12,450
It puts a huge dent in our theory
about monsterization.

715
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:16,037
It may have evolved.

716
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:18,247
You can't just sit around.

717
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:19,624
It's time to take a risk.

718
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:22,543
All the experiments failed.

719
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:25,254
And there's absolutely nothing you can do.

720
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:32,011
There's something you don't know.

721
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:36,057
I'm not saying I'm going to
treat your monsterization.

722
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:39,268
I'm going to help you fight it

723
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,520
so you don't turn into a monster.

724
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,068
You know those special infectees?

725
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:48,444
I can turn you into one.

726
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:56,160
If you go down,
this whole place will fall apart.

727
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:58,454
Didn't you say
you wanted to protect this place?

728
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:26,232
He won't attack you.

729
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:43,833
I'm looking for Yi-kyung.

730
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:46,711
You know where she is, don't you?

731
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:51,257
I need to see her.

732
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:53,509
Mom…

733
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:56,762
People…

734
01:06:58,639 --> 01:06:59,765
They're all bad.

735
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:02,143
"Mom"?

736
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:04,061
You're just like them.
