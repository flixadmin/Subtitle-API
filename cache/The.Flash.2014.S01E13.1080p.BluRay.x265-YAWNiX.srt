1
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:06,632
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,761
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,388
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,558
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,812
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:25,526
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:30,155
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,908
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,285
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:38,622
Ronnie was vaporized
in the accelerator when it went critical.

11
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,291
Ronnie's alive. I saw him, Cisco.

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,709
Firestorm.

13
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,838
I wanted to talk to you about Firestorm.

14
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,258
We had some success
with our stage-one testing.

15
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,426
- Professor Stein...
- Professor Martin Stein?

16
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:52,970
He was our team leader.

17
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,805
I know what really happened to him.

18
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,099
- In the mass of energy. Looks like...
- Ronnie.

19
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:00,394
- And Professor Stein.
- The dark matter merged them together.

20
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,570
So how does a superhero
get ready for a date?

21
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,906
Same as everybody else.

22
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,957
All right.

23
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:26,044
Everyone tells you to just be yourself.

24
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,300
But who is that really?

25
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,594
You change one more time,
I'm gonna shoot you.

26
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:47,691
Punctual.

27
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:52,904
Ye... Yeah, that is what my
friends call me. Mr. Punctual.

28
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,325
Is that lonely-looking flower for me?

29
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,534
Is this dumb?

30
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,871
I thought about getting a full bouquet,
but I thought that was weird.

31
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,664
No.

32
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,333
It's awesome.

33
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,667
All right.

34
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:14,718
Mm.

35
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:18,764
Yes!

36
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,474
Victory.

37
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,310
I told you these were the spiciest tacos
in Central City.

38
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,063
- I thought you were bluffing.
- I never bluff.

39
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,691
Just say it.
I am the champion of all things spicy.

40
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,071
You are the spice champion of Central City.

41
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,073
Well, this requires soap and water.

42
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,075
- I'll be right back.
- Mm-hm.

43
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,414
Hey.

44
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:47,584
Robbery at the convenient store
on Brand and Paulson.

45
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,671
Oh, man, come on.
I'm kind of on a date.

46
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,756
Can't the cops get this one?

47
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,092
Fine. But when you read
in the paper tomorrow...

48
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,678
about that poor little old lady
getting robbed...

49
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:02,265
- How do you know it's a little old lady?
- Please. It's always a little old lady.

50
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,976
Okay. All right.

51
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,104
No little old lady.

52
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,566
Your move, Allen.

53
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,443
What's next?

54
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,697
So, what's wrong with you?

55
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,199
Why hasn't someone snatched you up yet?

56
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,038
Uh, it's work. Just a sec.

57
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,998
Hey.

58
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,378
- Hello.
- Hey, I know you're on a date...

59
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,839
but we got a jumper on 52nd and Waid.

60
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,387
Sir, please, you have
everything to live for.

61
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,597
No, I don't.

62
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:50,939
- Are you gonna let me go back up there?
- No.

63
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,027
Well...

64
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,988
thanks.

65
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,781
Yeah.

66
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:09,082
- What was that for?
- To see if I wanted a second date.

67
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,792
And?

68
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,795
Let me see one more time.

69
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,721
Definitely.

70
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,272
Quentin Quale.

71
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,233
Can I help you, young man?

72
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,111
Haven't been called that
in quite some time.

73
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,405
I'm sorry, do I know you?

74
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,783
We went to school together.

75
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,827
- You're one of my students.
- No.

76
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,454
Classmates.

77
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,540
University of Chicago, class of '74.

78
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,209
We protested the war.

79
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,921
"Make love, not napalm." Remember?

80
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,758
Look, I don't know
if this is some kind of practical joke.

81
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,010
I know about your brother.

82
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,639
- The truth is, he committed suicide.
- What?

83
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,849
You found the body.

84
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:13,480
- I never told anyone about that.
- You've told one person.

85
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,150
Martin?

86
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,738
I need you to help me.

87
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:34,125
Dude, you're a crime-fighting,
lady-slaying machine.

88
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,920
Oh, God, it was so cool.
She was so cool.

89
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,048
- We're going on another date tonight.
- Tonight, really?

90
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,801
Aren't you worried about moving too fast?

91
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,636
No. What do you mean?

92
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:45,971
It's a second date.

93
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,640
No, no, no, I meant going too fast.

94
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:49,891
Hurrying?

95
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,936
Look, you're fast,
but there's fast, and then there's fast.

96
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,021
- Am I being subtle?
- Really not.

97
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,108
Cisco's right. With your increased
blood flow and heart rate...

98
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,443
theoretically,
your speed can cause you to...

99
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:03,196
You're gonna need to think
about a lot of dead puppies.

100
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,156
Like we're talking a whole kennel.

101
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,785
And baseball. Cold showers.
You know what? Nuns.

102
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,913
- It is just a second date.
- A second date?

103
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,874
With who?

104
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,722
Uh, with Linda Park, the sports reporter.

105
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,587
- Hello.
- That's great.

106
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,839
Linda seems great, and you're great.

107
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,300
So great. Heh.

108
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:27,512
- Great.
- Hey, I gotta go. I gotta help out a friend.

109
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,640
- Everything okay? We just got here.
- Yeah. I'll see you later.

110
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,561
Quale was attacked near
his lab at Concordance Research last night.

111
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,897
There were several
unsubstantiated reports...

112
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,233
of the so-called Burning Man in the area
following the attack.

113
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:41,526
Burning Man?

114
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,697
Caitlin, weren't you asking about him
a few weeks ago?

115
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,163
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

116
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,956
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Sure.

117
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,167
What exactly are we doing here?

118
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,210
That's Barry's old house.

119
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,795
Where his mother was murdered?

120
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,257
I have a theory about who might've
been involved in his mother's death.

121
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,468
Thought you and I
could re-examine the scene.

122
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:09,554
You could apply your expertise,
and help me prove who did it.

123
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,098
We should get Dr. Wells and Caitlin in
on this.

124
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:16,311
No, we should keep this between us. If
too many people know, Barry will find out.

125
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,731
I don't wanna involve him
until we know something definitive.

126
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,950
Hello, ma'am. I'm Detective West.

127
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,369
This is Cisco Ramon.

128
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,704
Please, it's Sherry. Like the drink.

129
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:40,210
- What can I do for you, detective?
- I don't know if you're aware...

130
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,421
but there was a homicide
in this residence 15 years ago.

131
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,549
- Oh, I know.
- We've re-opened the investigation.

132
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,594
Do you mind if we come in
and take another look around?

133
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,429
Not at all.

134
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,641
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

135
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,815
- You live alone?
- Yes, I'm divorced.

136
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:11,074
Well, it appears letting Ronnie roam free
is no longer an option.

137
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,201
He's not even Ronnie anymore.

138
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,621
He's Martin Stein
walking around in Ronnie's body.

139
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,123
Like a vampire.

140
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:22,711
Is there a reason Stein's brain is in control
of Ronnie's body, not the other way around?

141
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,379
Simple Darwinism, I suspect.

142
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:28,842
A brand new organism will select the
strongest parts of itself in order to survive.

143
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,260
Survival of the fittest.

144
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,637
In this case, Ronnie's body, Stein's mind.

145
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:37,350
But any event, he badly hurt an innocent
man and we have hunted meta-humans for less.

146
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,977
Caitlin...

147
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:43,148
we need to know that you're on board
with what needs to be done here.

148
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,901
How do we find him?

149
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,779
Quentin Quale...

150
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:53,575
the scientist that Ronnie attacked
is a former colleague of Martin Stein.

151
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,578
If Martin is indeed in control
of Ronnie's body...

152
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,497
he may be trying to figure out
what's happening to him.

153
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:03,668
What do we know about him?
I don't even know what Stein looks like.

154
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,754
Martin Stein.

155
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,465
- That's Stein?
- Ltis.

156
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,676
- I've seen him before.
- When?

157
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,847
On the train,
the day the accelerator exploded.

158
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,858
Super cool, isn't it?

159
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,069
Uh, S.T.A.R. Labs, I mean.

160
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:33,907
Yes, it's super cool.

161
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:38,453
Trust Harrison Wells to build
a particle accelerator with a bit of style.

162
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:43,958
Most scientists don't have an appreciation
for the value of aesthetics.

163
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,836
Albert Einstein said,
"Once you can accept the universe...

164
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,757
as being something expanding into
an infinite nothing which is something..."

165
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,593
"Wearing stripes with plaid
comes easy."

166
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,723
I thought people your age didn't read
actual books anymore.

167
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,434
- I'm the only one.
- Oh.

168
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,562
Physics. Hobby or endeavor?

169
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,773
Both, actually.

170
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,984
I'ma CSI. I work for the
Central City Police Department.

171
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:13,113
Really? You look too young for that.

172
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,449
That is what they tell me.

173
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,494
Are you gonna watch the accelerator
turn on tonight?

174
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,955
I wouldn't miss it.

175
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,165
They say it's gonna change the world.

176
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,501
I hope so.

177
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,795
Carson Station. Carson Station.

178
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,672
This is my stop.

179
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,632
- It was nice talking to you.
- You too.

180
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,302
Maybe I will see you there tonight.
Excuse me.

181
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:39,973
I'm taking a girlfriend... Not
my girlfriend. She's just, uh...

182
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,224
Sorry.

183
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,517
She's a female friend.

184
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,102
Who I'm not dating. Yet.

185
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,229
- The doors are about to close.
- Yeah.

186
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,064
Bye.

187
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,531
Don't turn it on!

188
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,533
Don't turn it on!

189
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,535
Don't turn it on!

190
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,496
Don't turn it on! Don't turn...

191
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,008
Caitlin, whatever happens...

192
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,435
Of course I've heard of S.T.A.R Labs.

193
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,813
Martin was always vocal
about the competition.

194
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,858
S.T.A.R. Labs is helping
the C.C.P.D. looking...

195
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,485
into your husband's disappearance,
Mrs. Stein.

196
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,779
Oh, please, call me Clarissa.

197
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:40,366
The Conway Prize
for Scientific Advancement.

198
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,036
Martin was very proud of that one.

199
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,455
Well, I always hoped to win
one of these myself.

200
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,541
Oh, and look at that,
he won it three times.

201
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,503
Takes a special kind of person
to make Dr. Wells jealous.

202
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,341
Martin had a talent
for making people jealous.

203
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,009
Even me.

204
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,554
I sometimes think Martin loved his theorems
and experiments...

205
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,223
more than he did me.

206
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,142
I'm sure that's not true.

207
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,147
And you haven't heard from your husband
since he disappeared?

208
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,149
No.

209
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:17,528
Mrs. Stein, could I show you a photograph?

210
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,822
Have you seen this person before?

211
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,617
Yes, I have.

212
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,203
Who is he?

213
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:27,664
Um...

214
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,124
He's a person of interest
in your husband's case.

215
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,086
When did you see him?

216
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:37,215
I started getting the feeling
that someone was watching me.

217
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,550
Sometimes I still do.

218
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,263
And about a month
after Martin disappeared...

219
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:47,267
that young man showed up here.

220
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,281
What happened to me?

221
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,868
It's a month...

222
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,167
Clarissa.

223
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,088
Clarissa.

224
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,425
Who are you?

225
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,593
How did you get in here?

226
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:26,806
The loose stone,
you leave a key for me there.

227
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:32,729
I'm always losing my keys.
Losing my mind.

228
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,356
- I'm going to call the police.
- This isn't my body.

229
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,901
Where's my body?

230
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,946
I see my life but I can't reach it.

231
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:46,326
Please send someone.
There's an intruder in my house.

232
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,749
It appears Martin Stein and Ronnie Raymond
have something in common...

233
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,250
besides sharing a body.

234
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,128
They both feel the need to protect
the women they love.

235
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,840
Clarissa said she feels like
she's being watched.

236
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,467
Well, then...

237
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,635
this has all the makings of a stakeout.

238
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,846
But Barry's got a date tonight.

239
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,932
- I'll cancel.
- No. No, go.

240
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:13,269
If we need you here, something tells me
you can get back in a hurry.

241
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,485
I'm not picking up anything.
Not even with the super light.

242
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,778
Super light?

243
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,655
It's a multispectrum ultraviolet laser
enhanced scanner...

244
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,742
that detects molecular schisms
in the 600-megavolt range...

245
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,161
but I figured "super light"
was easier to say.

246
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,621
But what does it tell you?

247
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,998
Nothing we didn't already know
about that night.

248
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,333
Okay, keep looking.

249
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,629
Ahem. Uh, can I get you boys
something to drink?

250
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,381
Water? Soda?

251
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,717
Wine?

252
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,637
We're fine. Thank you.

253
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:53,017
Well, if you change your mind, I've been
told my strawberry daiquiris are sinful.

254
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,398
- I will not judge you.
- Okay...

255
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:03,444
Barry's mother's body was found here.
Knife beside her.

256
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:06,030
Blood spatter on the wall
belonged to Nora.

257
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,324
Joe, I think...

258
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,827
I just think maybe it's been too long.

259
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,829
And everything's different.

260
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,164
Except that mirror.

261
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,254
Sherry must've bought
it at the estate sale.

262
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,550
Oh, my God.

263
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,427
Silver nitrate.

264
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,262
The compound used in photography.

265
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,182
It was often used to back vintage mirrors.

266
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,979
If there were two speedsters there
that night...

267
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,441
the sparks from their movement
would've generated enough flashes...

268
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,110
to actually expose images
onto the silver nitrate.

269
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:48,197
- Are you saying what I think your saying?
- This mirror might contain photographs...

270
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,908
of what actually happened that night.

271
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,581
Hey, you look great.

272
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,209
Well, I have a big date tonight
and I kind of wanted to impress the guy.

273
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:05,131
I think I can speak for that guy
and say that he is super impressed.

274
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,343
So this is your place?
It's awesome.

275
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,388
Yeah. Well, not entirely. I grew up here.

276
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,308
- Is it really lame, that I live at home?
- Mm, not at all.

277
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,352
- I still live with my parents.
- Really?

278
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,980
No. That would be so lame.

279
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,983
Ha, ha. All right, so here's the plan:

280
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,402
First, a dinner reservation at Paper Clip.

281
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:27,820
Then a round of mini golf.

282
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,073
Followed by Mal Duncan,
who's playing at an underground jazz club.

283
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,910
But my foster dad has connections there
so he hooked us up.

284
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,746
And if you're not sick of me by then,
we can get Froyo.

285
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,581
Or...

286
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,087
Want some of my fries?

287
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:49,550
No, thanks. Why would he come back here?

288
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,970
Because this is his home.

289
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,265
I don't mean the actual house.

290
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,268
I mean Clarissa. She's his home.

291
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,687
And we all wanna go home again.

292
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,857
Where we feel safe.

293
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,486
Where we feel loved.

294
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,614
Ronnie's your home.

295
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,159
Not anymore.

296
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,124
Remember what I told you on your first day
at S.T.A.R. Labs?

297
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,877
"A scientist's work is never finished."

298
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:29,298
His work is never finished. My work did
this to Ronnie, did this to Martin Stein.

299
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,801
But it's not finished, and it won't be...

300
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,803
until we bring them both home.

301
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,565
So I'm assuming you have Barry
on speed dial?

302
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,407
Mm. Wow.

303
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,576
What's wrong? That felt amazing.

304
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,869
I just got a little excited.

305
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,498
- I would hope so.
- Sorry, Linda, I'm just, um...

306
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,959
a little worried about, um...

307
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,461
moving too fast.

308
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,591
It's okay. I hate slow.

309
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:19,682
Denying every tear.

310
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:25,396
I'm sorry, I should check
just in case it's an emergency. Aah!

311
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,148
Okay.

312
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:33,613
I'm so sorry. It's important.

313
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,782
Not that this isn't important.

314
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,534
It's just that, um...

315
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,621
this other thing is time-sensitive.

316
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:45,374
But otherwise there's no way
that I would be leaving you.

317
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,461
No one in their right mind would leave you.

318
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,921
Um, your shirt's on backwards.

319
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,215
Yeah, I got it. Okay.

320
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,301
I will text you, all right?

321
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,386
No, I'll call you. I'll call you.

322
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,556
Why don't I just... I'll just
do both, okay? Il do both.

323
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,059
I'm so sorry.

324
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,816
Professor Stein.

325
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,444
Hey, I'm not here to hurt you.

326
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,863
And I know you don't wanna hurt
anyone else.

327
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,449
So if you could just not...

328
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,700
flame on.

329
00:19:19,724 --> 00:19:21,724
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

330
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:12,753
No!

331
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,641
Well, that was terrifying.

332
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,314
I sent Sherry to the movies.

333
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:35,943
Trust me, the best show in town
is gonna be in here tonight.

334
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,487
So you can get actual photographs
from this thing?

335
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:41,907
The science is solid.
It works exactly like an old film camera.

336
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:45,411
I developed the mirror backing,
and fortunately for us...

337
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,997
the lightning went off
about 10 times that night.

338
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,916
- Multiple exposures.
- Now you're getting it.

339
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,837
I went ahead and enhanced them digitally,
and just for kicks...

340
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:58,090
decided to extrapolate a 3D hologram
from the original 2D.

341
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,217
- Cisco.
- Lights...

342
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:05,848
camera, action.

343
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:08,267
Wow.

344
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:29,330
Can you play it again, slower?

345
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:34,126
There, there. You see that?

346
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,010
Next frame.

347
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:59,068
This wallpaper is new.

348
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,405
Oh, man.

349
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,866
Is that blood?

350
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,995
We had a husband holding
the same weapon that killed his wife.

351
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,289
We weren't looking for any other suspects.

352
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:16,418
That blood belongs to one of the two
speedsters that was here that night.

353
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,921
Maybe the one that killed Nora.

354
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,923
I'll get a sample kit.

355
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,593
I got you.

356
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,976
- That's great.
- Linda.

357
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,769
- Hey.
- Hey.

358
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,480
- So I hope it's cool that I came by.
- Yeah, of course.

359
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,691
I was just writing a column
on the Combines.

360
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,359
Oh, sweet, how are they doing?

361
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:45,948
Well, they were up two goals to none
last night, but then they blew it.

362
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:50,870
Wait, we're not talking about
hockey anymore, are we?

363
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,454
No, we're not.

364
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:56,625
Look, I'm so, so sorry
that I left you like that.

365
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,669
I'm not that kind of guy.

366
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:02,548
Well, let me tell you
what kind of girl I am.

367
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,050
I work in a hard business
and I work hard in it...

368
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:08,971
and so I'm very picky about who I choose
to spend my free time with.

369
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,473
I chose to spend some of it with you...

370
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,935
So tell me, Barry Allen,
did I make the right choice?

371
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:18,898
Yeah, you did, it's just that
something important came up.

372
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:24,069
Not more important than you, just sort of
an equal-level-of-importance type situation.

373
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:30,117
And usually I can do both...

374
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:33,704
but it's just that I have to, um...

375
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:37,791
I have to go to work. I'm so sorry.

376
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,919
It's a police emergency.

377
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,462
Can we talk later tonight?

378
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:44,298
I'm not going anywhere, yet.

379
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,342
Okay, thanks.

380
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,593
- Hey.
- Hi.

381
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,846
Sorry, gotta go. Uh, hey, what's up?

382
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,640
Bye. Ha, ha.

383
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,516
Hey, can I ask you a question?

384
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,852
- Yeah, sure.
- So...

385
00:23:57,061 --> 00:24:01,148
- you and Barry are like BFFs, right?
- The best of BFFs.

386
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,692
Has he ever actually dated anyone before?

387
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:08,530
Because he's simultaneously surprisingly
good at it, and really, really bad at it.

388
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:12,284
I don't know. He's Barry.

389
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,994
What was his last girlfriend like?

390
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,789
You know, he hasn't really had a girlfriend
in a while.

391
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,334
I don't know, maybe
he's just not ready yet.

392
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,752
What do you mean?

393
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:26,715
You know, I mean, he was into someone,
an unrequited-love thing.

394
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,010
You know, he had feelings for someone...

395
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,888
and they weren't
really reciprocated, so...

396
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,391
Yeah, maybe just give him time.

397
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:38,102
Sure.

398
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:46,318
There he is. Looks like the tracker
Barry placed on him worked.

399
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,905
Professor Stein?

400
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:53,158
- I told you to stay away from me.
- And I will...

401
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:56,829
but there's someone else
who wants to talk to you.

402
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,664
Martin?

403
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,420
Do you know who I am?

404
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,256
Clarissa?

405
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,801
- Is it really you?
- I don't know.

406
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:17,141
I hear the other inside of me,
and he wants to go home to her.

407
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,018
But we can't.

408
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,270
I just want to be me again.

409
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,105
Martin.

410
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:26,108
What's my favorite color?

411
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,572
You could... You could never decide.

412
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,491
So you chose stripes.

413
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,997
You shouldn't see me like this.

414
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,502
I see you.

415
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:48,505
I see you, Martin.

416
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,300
These people can help you.

417
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,801
They say they can.

418
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,304
Please, let them.

419
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,935
Please, help us.

420
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,113
Well, we got him... Them. Now what?

421
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:17,659
Stein clearly thinks he can separate himself
from Ronnie's body using nuclear fission.

422
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,829
- What do you think?
- What do I think?

423
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:24,333
Is it possible? Theoretically.

424
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:28,378
Splitting an atom and splitting a man
are two very different things.

425
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:35,594
I don't suppose it's necessary
to point out you're all staring.

426
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,931
Our apologies.

427
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,391
It is remarkable.

428
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,436
I feel clearer than I
have since the accident.

429
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:47,481
- What did you give me?
- A cocktail of antipsychotics.

430
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,775
Depressants, mood stabilizers.

431
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:53,779
The same formula used to treat
dissociative identity disorder.

432
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,405
I assume this was your idea?

433
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,201
Very clever, Cait.

434
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:02,079
Don't call me that, please.

435
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,664
I apologize.

436
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,543
We'd like to run some tests on you,
if you don't mind.

437
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,586
Of course, Dr. Snow.

438
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:16,009
Hey, I'm so sorry
I had to run out like that again.

439
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:18,303
I had police business.

440
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:22,558
That's funny. I just called the station. They
said that you'd taken some personal time.

441
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,977
I'm not mad, Barry, I swear.

442
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:29,356
- But I do think that we should call it.
- Wait, can we talk about this?

443
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:32,025
- What do you mean?
- II know how hard and weird it is...

444
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:35,028
to date someone new
when you're still not over someone.

445
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:38,073
- What are you talking about?
- You and Iris.

446
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:41,285
Me and Iris? We're not...

447
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:44,163
Who told you that I was hung up on Iris?

448
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,751
- Hey. Um...
- Hey, what's up?

449
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,173
Why would you tell Linda
that I had feelings for you?

450
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:57,050
I did not say that. Wait, did 1?

451
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:00,179
Okay, Iris, this isn't
funny. I like this girl.

452
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:03,098
- I know and I am happy for you.
- Really?

453
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:05,934
Because, I mean, right now,
it sort of feels like...

454
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:10,105
you don't want to be with me, and you don't
want anyone else to be with me either.

455
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,150
I've wanted nothing more than
for you to meet someone amazing.

456
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:17,070
And I did, and you went out of your way
to convince her that I was unavailable.

457
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,949
Look, I'm really sorry.

458
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,994
- Great.
- Do you want me to talk to her?

459
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:28,081
No, no, no. Absolutely not. Don't talk
to her. I'll figure this out on my own.

460
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:35,255
I just need you to know that I don't
have those feelings for you anymore.

461
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,176
Yeah, I know.

462
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,012
Okay.

463
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:45,015
I'll see you later.

464
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,900
Yes, yes, yes.

465
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,736
See, we got two different blood samples.

466
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,988
- One for each speedster.
- That's right.

467
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,075
One is A-positive, and the other one's
AB-negative. Super rare.

468
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:06,954
I'll run them both through the C.C.P.D.
criminal database, see if I get a match.

469
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,248
Can you run them against a specific person?

470
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:13,210
Yeah, sure, if we have something
to match it to. Who are we looking at?

471
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,629
Dr. Harrison Wells.

472
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,554
I thought we were trying to solve
Barry's mom's murder.

473
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,265
We are.

474
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:28,684
And I'm asking you to keep this between us.

475
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,021
You think Dr. Wells killed Barry's mom?

476
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,902
No way. He didn't even know Barry then.
Why would he kill his mom?

477
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,571
I don't know yet.

478
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,867
But I do know that Wells keeps secrets.

479
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:47,411
And this may be one of them.

480
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,706
Dr. Wells is a great man.

481
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:55,419
I was nothing when he gave me a job,
a chance to change my life.

482
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,297
He has helped so many people.
He's not a murderer.

483
00:29:58,547 --> 00:29:59,589
Cisco.

484
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:03,635
I'm a cop. I'm good at reading people.

485
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:07,556
So I know I can trust
you with my suspicion.

486
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:11,351
When I go talk to the family and friends
of a murder suspect...

487
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,229
somebody I know is guilty...

488
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,940
and I tell them the person they love
is a Killer...

489
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,151
guess what they all say.

490
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:23,155
"That's not the person I know."

491
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:28,285
I think I'm done being a cop for today.

492
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,462
Are you comfortable?

493
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,255
A little warm.

494
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,924
Ronnie used to always run warm.

495
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,178
Not that warm.

496
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,182
Can I talk to him?

497
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,853
Sorry, my dear,
I'm not sure it works like that.

498
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,856
I can feel him, though.

499
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,275
I have these memories.

500
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:03,612
Memories that I know aren't my own.

501
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:06,323
One is particularly strong.

502
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,242
Piedmont State Park,
it's famous for the Hudson Falls.

503
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:16,124
I know that I've never been, but I can
remember those waterfalls perfectly.

504
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:20,670
That's where Ronnie proposed to me.

505
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,715
He loves you very much.

506
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,717
That, I can feel.

507
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:31,306
Dr. Snow, can we see you for a minute?

508
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,141
Excuse me.

509
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,732
- You okay?
- Yeah, it's just confusing.

510
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:43,652
What isn't confusing
is what's happening to him now.

511
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:48,657
Ronnie's body is rejecting Stein's atoms
like a host rejecting a parasite.

512
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:52,536
The resulting instability
is causing an exothermic reaction.

513
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,872
I worry, if his temperature
continues to rise...

514
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,874
it'll set off a chain reaction.

515
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,210
And then what happens?

516
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,589
He could go nuclear.

517
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,932
Ronnie.

518
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,143
Not Ronnie.

519
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:19,187
- Martin Stein.
- Cisco Ramon.

520
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:22,858
Your colleagues are in the next room,
not so subtly discussing my condition.

521
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,739
That's not freaky at all.

522
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:34,369
It seems Ronnie's fight with the Flash
has exacerbated the Firestorm matrix.

523
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,204
It's unstable.

524
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:40,125
It's exponentially increasing the rate
of fission inside his body.

525
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,544
How long does he have?

526
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,964
If his temperature keeps rising
at the current pace...

527
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,300
no more than a couple of hours.

528
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:52,179
But you can fix it, right? I mean,
you can separate them before it's too late?

529
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:56,391
Any attempt we make to separate
the two of them could be catastrophic.

530
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,643
A nuclear explosion.

531
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:03,315
And a nuclear explosion of this magnitude
would level this entire city.

532
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,275
Unless...

533
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,319
Unless what?

534
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:10,530
Unless the host body
were no longer functional.

535
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,700
You wanna kill Ronnie?

536
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:16,203
No, I don't wanna kill Ronnie.

537
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,289
But in this scenario,
Ronnie is the host body.

538
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:22,584
If you kill Ronnie, you kill Stein.
That's two people.

539
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,212
I don't know how else to stop it.

540
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,798
And my guess is
that if Ronnie and Professor Stein...

541
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,343
knew the consequences that
we were all facing...

542
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,261
they would make the same decision.

543
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,723
It's two lives for millions.

544
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,603
Can you give us a minute?

545
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,321
- Caitlin...
- I've already lost Ronnie once.

546
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,241
I'm not gonna do it again.

547
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,702
You said we have a couple of hours.

548
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:59,829
Use them.

549
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:09,756
Dr. Wells, you don't really
think we should kill Ronnie, do you?

550
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,925
Stay here, Cisco.

551
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,394
Hey.

552
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,771
Sorry.

553
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,649
Can I get you anything, or...?

554
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:32,821
A glass of Chateau Haut-Brion
Pessac-Leognan 1982 might be nice.

555
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,532
Or maybe it wouldn't.

556
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,911
This body's taste buds
would obviously be different from my own.

557
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,455
Perhaps I'm now a light beer man.

558
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:45,041
There are worse things to be.

559
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,627
You mean like a living nuclear bomb?

560
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,547
You know.

561
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:55,635
Unstable nuclear fission was always
a danger in the transmutation process.

562
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,305
Plus, you all argue very loudly.

563
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,142
I'm sorry.

564
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,645
But my friends are gonna figure out
how to fix this, I promise.

565
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,773
I remember meeting you, Mr. Allen,
on the train.

566
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:14,446
You were headed to S.T.A.R. Labs
with a girl, but not your girlfriend.

567
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,823
Yeah.

568
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:20,452
I'm not sure that I have any girlfriend.

569
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:25,332
You know, Einstein
was not only brilliant...

570
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,001
he had a great sense of humor.

571
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,003
How did it go?

572
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,506
"Any man who drives safely
while kissing a pretty girl...

573
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:38,595
Is not giving the pretty girl
the attention she deserves."

574
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,807
If I learned anything this past year...

575
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,101
life's too short not to live.

576
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,612
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

577
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,906
- I gave you an out.
- I don't want an out.

578
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,158
I won't date someone who's
into someone else.

579
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,535
I'm not into anyone else.
I'll prove it to you.

580
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,622
This is a naga jolokia,
or the ghost pepper.

581
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:10,877
It is the world's hottest pepper, measuring
401.5 times hotter than Tabasco sauce.

582
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,463
If you do not agree
to go on another date with me...

583
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:17,008
I will eat it, right here, right now.

584
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,387
You're bluffing.

585
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,889
I never bluff.

586
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:30,146
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, yeah.

587
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:31,940
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hm.

588
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:35,068
Yes, yes, I'll go out with you.

589
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:38,905
- That pepper could've killed you, nerd.
- Thanks. Mm.

590
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,033
Ugh. Thank you.

591
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:46,204
Okay, I won't let my job...

592
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:51,751
or how bad my mouth is burning right now
come between us.

593
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:55,964
My Spice Champion of Central City. Ha, ha.

594
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:14,107
A crude weapon, if I may say so, Dr. Wells.

595
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:16,609
I couldn't agree more, Gideon.

596
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:19,946
But it will do the job.

597
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,788
Gideon...

598
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:34,294
can the tachyon prototype be converted
into a quantum splicer?

599
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:37,630
Theoretically,
but I must warn you, Dr. Wells...

600
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:40,925
converting the tachyon prototype
will delay your timetable.

601
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:45,555
There's not gonna be a timetable if Central
City goes up in a mushroom cloud.

602
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:48,308
Hey, anything?

603
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:53,438
I have an idea. It's a bit of a Hail Mary,
but Cisco and I are gonna give it a try.

604
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:56,566
- Thank you.
- I'll get Professor Stein.

605
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,234
Looking for the professor?

606
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,904
Yeah, he's gone.

607
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,577
- You guys almost done?
- Hang on, hang on.

608
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,579
I found Stein. He's in the Badlands.

609
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:12,624
The middle of nowhere,
30 miles outside of Central City.

610
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,584
Minimum safe distance.

611
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,419
He's sacrificing himself.

612
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,797
How much time does he have left?

613
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,673
Twelve minutes.

614
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:24,969
And we're done.

615
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:29,891
- What is it?
- This is a quantum splicer.

616
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:33,144
- Will it work to separate them?
- We'll know in 12 minutes.

617
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:35,730
Now, Barry, even you
can't outrun a nuclear blast...

618
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:40,610
So you get this device to Professor Stein
and you get out of there as fast as you can.

619
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,529
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.

620
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,405
- No, you're not.
- It's too dangerous.

621
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:46,741
Barry doesn't know how
to operate the splicer.

622
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:50,954
- Cisco's gonna talk me through it.
- There's not enough time. Let's go.

623
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,747
Go.

624
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,713
What was that?

625
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:07,345
Uh, comm system's on the fritz.
I'll be right back.

626
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,142
- Cisco.
- I'm not proud of it but I ran the samples.

627
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,813
- One wasn't identified. The other had a match.
- Cisco, you're hesitating.

628
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,815
- Was it Wells?
- No, it's not Dr. Wells.

629
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,234
I told you, he has nothing to do with this.

630
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,361
But I know whose blood it is.

631
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,612
It's Barry's.

632
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,865
We already know
Barry was there that night.

633
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,117
No, no, no, you don't understand.

634
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:33,830
The sample had high levels of P-16, a protein
that builds up in the blood as we get older.

635
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:36,583
And these levels were way too high
for an 11-year-old.

636
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:41,880
This sample was from Barry as an adult.

637
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:58,563
Professor Stein!

638
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,941
What are you doing here? You can't be here!

639
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,776
Get her out of here now!

640
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,988
Please, look,
Ronnie's still in there somewhere.

641
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:10,658
All those people.
Clarissa, I won't let them die.

642
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,577
It's better I end this now.

643
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,370
We can separate youl!

644
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,623
We can stop the explosion.

645
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,126
- How?
- A quantum splicer.

646
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:23,254
It's a fission device
designed to bombard your atoms...

647
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:27,216
with as much energy as they experienced
in the particle accelerator explosion.

648
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,218
It should be enough to separate you.

649
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,556
Please, professor,
you have nothing left to lose.

650
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:41,898
Ronnie, if you're in there...

651
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,858
I love you.

652
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,912
That was from him.

653
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:00,625
I look forward to meeting you
in person, professor.

654
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,221
It's not working.

655
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:17,767
- He's not gonna make it. He's gonna blow.
- Get out of there. Barry, get out of there now.

656
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,436
- Oh, no. No, no!
- Caitlin, we have to go.

657
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:21,646
Run!

658
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,318
No!

659
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:46,754
Sir, we have a thermonuclear detonation...

660
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:49,382
approximately 30 miles northeast
of Central City.

661
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,385
Deploy the Rapid Response Team, sergeant.

662
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,762
Bring me Firestorm.

663
00:41:54,786 --> 00:42:02,786
