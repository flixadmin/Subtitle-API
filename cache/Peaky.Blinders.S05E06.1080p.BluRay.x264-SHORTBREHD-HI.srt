1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,196
There are some things
we need to discuss.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,155
Our friend Jimmy McCavern has asked
for control of the racecourses

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,475
north of Wincanton.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,034
I said yes.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,073
- In return for what?
- No return.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,636
None.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,596
I'm glad I didn't shoot you.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,791
It would have been a kindness.

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,840
Now get out.

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,394
THOMAS: This is a cheque guarantee.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,352
Signed by Mosley.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,672
On behalf of a man called Jimmy McCavern.

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,472
THOMAS:
<i>The consequence of good intentions.</i>

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,074
<i>My good intentions.</i>

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,600
Push the button.

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,916
Unlock the door and come home to me.

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,159
(ENGINE STARTS)

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,479
I have a job for you.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,592
(LAUGHS)

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,473
I'll come for you...

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,398
...after midnight on Wednesday.

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,954
Barney Thomason...

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,677
...is gonna kill Oswald Mosley.

24
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,519
While he's on stage.

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,154
While I'm stood next to him.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,834
And then I will take over
as leader of the party.

27
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,317
THOMAS: <i>It's going to be
a busy few weeks, brother.</i>

(SNIFFS)

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,117
You prefer Irish to Scotch?

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,194
Yes, Mr Churchill.

34
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,715
Irish over Scotch.

35
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,271
Cigarettes over Havana cigars.

36
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,511
And your mother
was probably born in a tent.

37
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,760
Grandmother in a tent.

38
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,712
My mother on a narrow boat.

39
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,516
And always happy to give smart answers
to men born better than you.

40
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,877
A man needs to prove he is better than me

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,310
rather than show me his birth certificate.

42
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,992
You see, I don't have one,
so they mean very little to me.

43
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,079
You speak beautifully in the House.

44
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,873
- Thank you.
- And believe

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,832
not a word of what you are saying.

46
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,918
Conviction introduces emotion,
which is the enemy of oratory.

47
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,350
You read Greek literature.

48
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,834
I have trouble sleeping.

49
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,834
Is there a reason for your visit,
Mr Churchill?

50
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,516
You are forming an alliance
with a fascist.

51
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,840
So I made some enquiries
amongst the worst people in Whitehall,

52
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,352
and I found out that you are not
forming an alliance with him at all.

53
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,239
You are spying on him.

54
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,158
Yes.

55
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
Why?

56
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,154
The honest answer is...

57
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,355
...I'm no longer sure.

58
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,757
Do you dig your own garden, Mr Shelby?

59
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,000
I have a gardener.

60
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,800
In fact, I have three gardeners.

61
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,677
Three generations of men
with no ambition...

62
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,117
...who are happier than I will ever be.

63
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,075
Well, if you ask them, they will tell you

64
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,715
that there are certain species of weed

65
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,116
that no matter how much you tug at them,

66
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,674
poison them,

67
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,076
they continue to grow back.

68
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,070
In the end, the only solution
is to plough up the topsoil,

69
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,873
create a field of mud

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,834
and blow up and burn
the exposed taproots.

71
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,915
That's what you and I did in France.

72
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,670
But when I hear that man Mosley speak,

73
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,556
I see the green shoots of another war
growing up around his feet.

74
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,991
And you see exactly the same thing I do.

75
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,237
That's why you oppose him.

76
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,829
Yeah.

77
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,395
Your mystery solved.

78
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,874
What is your strategy?

79
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,157
I won't burden you with it.

80
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,078
You're going to break the law.

81

(SIGHS)

82
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,716
I need to sleep.

83
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,272
You said you don't sleep.

84
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,278
I said I have trouble sleeping.

85
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
As do I.

86
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,236
As do I.

87
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,240
Mr Shelby...

88
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,280
...I have no doubt
that there was once a time in Flanders

89
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,394
when you were under the ground
and I was above it,

90
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,557
both working to the same end.

91
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,034
We are in the same exact situation
here in Westminster.

92
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,039
Do what you have to do, Mr Shelby.

93
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,795
And if you need anything, call me.

94
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,719
There are some times, some nights...

95
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,995
...when I don't see the point
of carrying on with any of it.

96
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Oh.

97
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,120
That old dance routine.

98
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,799
I put out a cigar,

99
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,072
and an hour later I want another.

100
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,673
Sometimes, the bridge between hours
is as fragile as that.

101
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,150
But use it anyway.

102
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,318
A tent.

103
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,715
Then a boat.

104
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,354
Then a house.

105
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,392
Now a mansion.

106
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,512
That's something.

107
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,676
Isn't it?

108
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah, that is something.

109
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,552
By the way...

110
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,636
...was it you who killed
that Ulsterman intelligence officer?

111
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,080
I forget his name.

112
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,793
Major Campbell.

113
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,515
Yes, Campbell.

114
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,279
No.

115
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,720
It was my aunt.

116
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,355
I really must come up to Birmingham
some day

117
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,278
and spend an evening with your family.

118
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,473
They sound interesting.

119
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,080
Yes.

120
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,078
They'd like that.

121
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,756
(SNORTING)

122
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,594
I got to Harold French, refereeing Liverpool.
He just wants cash.

123
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,880
Tom the tatter,
reffing Sheffield Wednesday, wants cash

124
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,560
and a beating
for a bloke who's screwing his wife.

125
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,956
The clap doctor said go easy
on the whiskey, yeah?

126
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,235
Finn.

127
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,310
You don't knock?

128
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,074
No, Finn.

129
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,317
I don't knock.

130
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,190
Right.

131
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,030
Hello, Billy.

132
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,873
How are you, mate?

133
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,400
Good, Mr Shelby.

134
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,751
Yeah, you look good. (POURS DRINK)

135
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,156
That's a nice suit.

than we did on the races last Saturday.

Yeah, I know that. Mm.

You're coming up in the world, I like it.

142
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,837
How's the missus, hmm?

143
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,879
The old trouble and strife,
as the cockneys like to call it.

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,150
She moved out.

145
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,272
Oh, that's a shame.

146
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,631
Mind if I join you, eh?

147
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,039
Mind if I join the party?
Look at this, having some fun. Hmm?

148
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,473
You're a good man, Billy.

149
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,113
You're a good man, eh?

150
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,079
You could sing like a bird in a cage.

151
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,157
And what did we do, eh?

152
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,435
We opened that cage,
and the real man flies out,

153
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,995
reveals himself.

154
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,430
The truth is young, Billy boy.

155
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,994
Yeah.

156
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,554
Here, look.

157
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,036
What have we got here? Oh, look.

158
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,550
Look at that, Billy boy, eh?

159
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,239
Then there's some snow there, look.

160
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,036
Oh, there's more.
Look, snowflakes, Billy.

161
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,958
Now, I know you like that, hmm?

162
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,309
Well, I do too.

163
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,592
So, I'll tell you what, why don't we have
a little line together?

164
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,951
Eh? Why don't we do
a little bit of snow together?

(SNORTS)

166
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,760
Oh, spilt it all down you an' all.

167
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,111
It's the eyes. Sorry, mate.

168

Hey, what can I do?
I'm messy, aren't I, Billy?

169
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,194
I do apologise.

170
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,357
And you. Hmm?

171
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,550

- Hmm?
- And working.

an apology from Lizzie -
she can't be here.

He and Polly are to be married
in three weeks, with my blessing.

who planted the bomb.

222

In the meantime,
our thoughts are with Ada

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,354
and the baby inside of her,

224
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,871
who may one day sit at these meetings,

but hopefully
under happier circumstances.

An announcement,

232
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,150
regarding Michael.

233
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,239
(CLEARS THROAT) Before you go on, Tommy,

234
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,195
there's something I'd like to say
to the whole family directly,

235
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,313
regarding finances
and the future of this company.

236
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,909
According to your own estimations,

237
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,716
this new venture of the delivery
and shipment of opium

238
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,753
will bring into the company
around £2 million per year.

239
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,031
Therefore,

240
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,550
due to the amounts involved,

241
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,717
I think this company
should be restructured.

242
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,629
Michael, I think this can wait
till outside the family meeting.

243
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,955
Restructured in what way?

244
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,037
GINA: Because of the amounts
of money involved,

245
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,992
shipment and dispatch will become

246
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,589
the primary source of income
to the company.

247
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,235
It's simple mathematics.

248
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,589
And with the help of my wife,

249
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,554
I will organise an expansion into America,

250
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,752
where the narcotics business
is just beginning to grow.

251
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,634
So I have very good contacts in Detroit,

252
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,390
New York, Boston,
who I've already spoken to about this.

253
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,281
And Gina has family who are
very experienced in this kind of business.

254
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,434
According to the conversations
I've had with them,

255
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,914
with a regular supply

256
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,713
of pure opium from China,

257
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,116
within a short space of time,

258
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,998
the American narcotics business
will bring in $20 million per annum.

259
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,151
Enough money for you to all enjoy
an easing of the burden you all now feel.

260
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,191
See, I know that the scars
and the wounds,

261
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,879
they're on the inside,

262
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,514
not on the outside.

263
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,836
And as a member of the new generation,

264
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,749
I'm able to take that great burden
off your weary shoulders.

265
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,397
A new decade is coming.

266
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,592
There'll be new opportunities
in new territories.

267
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,313
More money than we've ever had before.

268
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,673
Tommy,

269
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,032
you can still do the good work
that deep down you want to do.

270
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,279
Mum, you can get married
and live in that big house.

271
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,756
Arthur, you can be the man
that Linda wants you to be.

272
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,439
Fuck Linda.

273

Finn.

274
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
You've proved yourself.

275
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,039
You're part of the new generation.

276
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,917
You could come to New York with me.

277
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,278
Here is my proposal.

278
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,957
A full restructuring of the company.

279
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,152
I will be managing director.

280
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,431
And you can be nonexecutive chairman.

281
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,553
But under an assumed name,
to protect your reputation.

282
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,199
I've found the name of a dead man.

283
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,392
You will be registered as Mr Jones.

284
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,749
You will each receive a percentage
of the profits as an annuity,

285
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:23,433
and you will no longer have to engage
in any of the associated activities.

286
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,191
Take a look at the future, Tommy.

287
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,439
At least read it with an open mind.

288
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,995
It's cold in here, Michael.

289

290
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,831

292
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,716
GINA: Tell him the truth.

293
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,876
Go on.

294
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,798
He can take it.

295
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,711
Tell me the truth, Michael.

296
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,354
The Americans don't want to deal with
an old-fashioned backstreet razor gang.

the fucking rope.

They've got him cornered,
but they need help.

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,558
Go and get him!

301
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,558
Fuck the Americans.

302
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,430
I'm doing this for you, Tommy.

303
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,520
It's time.

304
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,436
And you know it.

305

...John's dead, Arthur needs help,

307
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,550
Ada's man was killed in your own back yard
because you fucked up.

308
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,751
Go on, Tom. Go on, cut me.

309
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,360
Like the good old days.

310
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,440
Or...

311
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,836
...see this for what it is.

312
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,234
A natural succession...

313
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,953
...that someday must happen.

314
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,109
I gave you an opportunity, Michael.
You betrayed me.

315
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,794
Don't be here when I get back.

316

Let me guess.

Don't fuck with the Peaky Blinders.

Right?

321

- Well...
- (DOOR CLOSES)

322
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,160
...guess we're gonna be forced
to take the second option.

323

They're not fucking voices!

324
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,158
Whoa! Whoa! Calm down.

- Put the gun down.
- They're not fucking voices!

Barney!

328
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,356
Put down the gun. At ease.

Finn.

330
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,953
At ease, soldier. At ease.

331
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,992
Look at me. You're on our side.

332
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,032
You're at home.

333
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,355
You're at home.

334
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,711
Yeah? Yeah.

335
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,674
Here. Take this, Barney. Jeremiah?

336
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,632
Yeah.

337
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,320
Take him to Charlie's yard
before he falls over.

338
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,680
The devil will now be an angel.

339
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,712
Isiah, Curly, you go with him.

340
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,910
Come, brother.

341
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,633
Let me give you the good news.

342
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,035
Jesus loves you.

343
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,474
So, where the fuck is he?

344
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,670
THOMAS: All right, boys.

345
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,750
A subsidiary meeting of the generation
that actually do the work.

346
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,071
ARTHUR: Right.

347
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,714
Let's have the good stuff.

348
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,991
None of that shit ponces' drink.

349
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,077
Here we go, look.

350
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,954
All right, so item number three.

351
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,912
An introduction.

352
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,159
Except now you've already met the man
I was going to introduce.

353
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,112
In France, he was a comrade.

354
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,560
What the fuck is he now, Tom?

355
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,115
He's a man we can use, Johnny.

356
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,960
For what? Put him in a ring with a bear
and take bets on the outcome?

357
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,039
I tell you, I wouldn't put much money
on the fucking bear.

358
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,712
Aberama,

359
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,754
that man is a trained Royal Marine sniper.

360
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,917
Furthermore, he has a criminal profile

361
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,272
which will make his actions explicable
to the police.

362
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,198
What actions?

363
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,754
A killing.

364
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,120
ABERAMA: And since when
did you worry about the police?

365
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,676
Barney Thomason...

366
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,833
...is gonna kill an MP.

367
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,794
Possibly the future prime minister
of Great Britain.

368
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,230
What the fuck, Tom?

369
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,513
(COUGHS)

370
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,552
After the killing,

371
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,195
there will be an investigation
by Special Branch

372
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,470
and Intelligence forces.

373
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,393
There will be a lot of powerful people
as angry as fucking hornets.

374
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,160
We need there to be no connection to us.

375
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,556
Barney Thomason is registered
as criminally insane.

376
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,070
He broke out. He's an old soldier.

377
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,032
He has known grievances.

378
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,120
No-one will question
that the assassination was carried out

379
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,596
by a single gunman acting alone.

380
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,918
And you'd sacrifice an old comrade?

381
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,271
If they catch him,

382
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,677
they won't hang him
on grounds of insanity,

383
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,440
just send him back to where I found him.

384
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,233
He'll have had a very eventful holiday

385
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,716
that he'll probably believe
never really happened.

386
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,797
And where will this killing take place?

387
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,680
ARTHUR: There you go.

388
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,350
He'll be on stage.

389
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,631
With lots...

390
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,000
...of witnesses.

391
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,191
During the rally,

392
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,994
there will be
an anti-fascist demonstration.

393
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,033
Amidst the confusion,
a shot will be fired.

394
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,833
And we're organising this demonstration?

395
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,076
Yeah.

396
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,919
Where will you be, Tom?

397
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,431
I'll be down on one knee,
cradling his head...

398
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,000
...while the life drains from him.

399
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,120
Then I'll make a speech...

400
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,789
...saying how the cause he died for
must continue...

401
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,080
...continue safe in my hands.

402
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,436
ABERAMA: Holy fuck.

403
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,114
Tommy...

404
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,273
...does your ambition have no limits?

405
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,394
Jimmy McCavern will be running security
at this event.

406
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,160
He'll probably be in the wings.

407
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,960
You can take his life
whichever manner you choose.

408
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,952
What do you want us to do, Tom?

409
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,072
You and Arthur
and a couple of the Lee boys,

410
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,760
you'll be in charge
of getting Barney into position.

411
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,111
He'll be up in the lighting gantry.

412
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,720
We'll need chains and a twitch, Tom.

413
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,832
No. I will medicate him.

414
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,431
So he's gonna be cross-eyed
when he takes the shot?

415
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,792
In France, he never missed...

416
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,433
...no matter what they gave him.

417
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,189
He'll have had plenty of target practice.

418
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,039
Before he takes the shot,

419
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,200
Arthur here will give him some cocaine
to sharpen him up.

420
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,913
So just...

421
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,713
You're gonna be up on the stage

422
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,958
while this criminally insane gunman
filled with cocaine

423
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,357
takes aim at a man
just a yard away from you?

424
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,352
Welcome to the family, Aberama.

425
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,791
What about me, Thomas?
The man with the broken fucking leg.

426
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,914
After the killing,

427
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,431
every copper in Birmingham
will be sent to Bingley Hall.

428
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,711
Use that opportunity

429
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,151
to get that boat full of opium
up to Stourbridge locks.

430
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,480
There, you'll be met
by some Chinese gentlemen.

431
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,478
They will have two suitcases full of cash.

432
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,718
£250,000.

433
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,353
Every man in this room
will receive $30,000 in cash,

434
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,358
in recognition of extra services.

435
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,791

leave now.

Anyone who is tired
of this old-fashioned,

00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,756
Good.

442
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,636
Charlie, go to the yard and light a fire.

443
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,831
Johnny, bring the van round.

444
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,953
What's the fire for, Tom?

445
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,712
There is an item number four.

446
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,400

If I'd have known, I'd have come in early

Here you go, have a drink.

457

A few days ago, I went to London, Micky.

458
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,435
To collect some cargo.

459
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,752
I was met by the Titanic boys.

460
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,952
They knew I was coming.

461
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,909
Yeah. When, where, what time.

462
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,156
They even knew...

00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,270
...by a bomb.

469
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,030
Yeah, erm, the papers said that was IRA.

470
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,320
No, it wasn't the IRA, Micky.

471

No. It weren't the IRA.

472
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,270
I spoke to the girls who work
at the Digbeth telephone exchange.

They're friends of mine.

around the time of the explosion.

They told me that...

...30 minutes before the explosion
a call was made to a man in Sparkhill
