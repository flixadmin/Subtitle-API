1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,200
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,880
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,640
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,280
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,680
<i>Unfortunately,
my plan is opposed by the body</i>

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,880
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance to,
the Time Masters.</i>

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,160
<i>In the future,
my friends may not be heroes,</i>

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,920
<i>but if we succeed,
they will be remembered as Legends.</i>

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,480
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,600
Boys, ship's all yours.

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,040
Mick!

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,240
What are you gonna do, Snart?

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,160
My husband and I get along
just fine on our own.

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,440
We're still waiting on Sara
and the two lovebirds to get back.

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,040
Seems they've taken
quite a shine to 1958.

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,200
Sara swore her allegiance
to the League of Assassins.

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,880
It's time for her to return home.

18
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,240
My friend Thea calls it a bloodlust.

19
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,480
Sara, stop!

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,680
I'm a monster.

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,440
Not this guy again.

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,560
<i>Captain, Chronos has breached
the starboard hatch.</i>

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
How is that possible?

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,800
Clearly received some new toys
from his Time Master friend

25
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,080
since our last encounter.

26
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,280
{\an5}1958's swell and all,
but I miss the Internet...

27
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,160
and cell phones.

28
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,880
Gideon!
Seal the bulkheads from here...

29
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
- Grey, come on!
- Let's do this!

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,800
If we merge on the <i>Waverider</i>,
it could destroy the entire ship!

31
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,200
Are you not paying attention
to what Chronos is doing?

32
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,360
Fall back!

33
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,080
Get to the Jumpship!

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hey, come on!

35
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,560
You sure it was a good idea leaving
the Terminator on the bridge?

36
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,080
Gideon has lockdown
protocols which...

37
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,560
<i>Have been overridden, Captain.</i>

38
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,360
<i>Chronos is utilizing superior
Time Master technology.</i>

39
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,160
<i>I cannot countermand his orders.</i>

40
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,320
Uh... what are they doing?

41
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,600
- Hey!
- Hey!

42
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,440
Where did they go?

43
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,240
Better question:
Why did they leave us?

44
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,560
He's time jumping the ship.

45
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,480
The ladies will be left in 1958.

46
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,680
- What about Ray?
- Like I said.

47
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,800
Let's go! We have to stop him!

48
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Oh!

49
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,400
Oh!

50
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,160
Gideon,
open the doors on my mark.

51
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,520
Get to the Jumpship and escape.

52
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,920
We are not abandoning you.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,840
No, you are obeying a direct order
from your captain.

54
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,400
Now, Gideon.

55
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,520
No.

56
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,960
I don't know if the Jumpship will
even fly from the Temporal Zone.

57
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,240
<i>- I don't know...
- No.</i>

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
<i>Aah.</i>

59
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,640
<i>Oh.</i>

60
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,480
It doesn't matter.

61
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,440
We're not leaving our team.

62
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,600
What happened to:
We could destroy the whole ship?

63
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,000
A preferable alternative
to losing our friends.

64
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,280
Don't you agree?

65
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,400
<i>Oh.</i>

66
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,080
Yeah.

67
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,440
<i>We could've just opened the door,
Jefferson.</i>

68
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,120
Sorry, I got a little carried...

69
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
away.

70
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,160
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

71
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,360
Oh, God.

72
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,240
Where's Chronos?

73
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,400
<i>He absconded with Mr. Snart
on the Jumpship.</i>

74
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,480
<i>I'm sorry, Captain.</i>

75
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,400
Why would Chronos take Snart?

76
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,520
Gideon, can you track them?

77
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,240
<i>We have a more pressing matter.</i>

78
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,600
Strap yourselves in.

79
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,640
What's going on?

80
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,720
Chronos has sabotaged
the navigation system.

81
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,960
Unless we can find a way
to alter the course,

82
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,960
we'll be trapped in the Temporal Zone
for all time.

83
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,040
Gideon.

84
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,000
I cannot override Chronos' commands.

85
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,560
What did you do?

86
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,040
I rebooted Gideon.

87
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,080
Until she's fully operational,
we're free-falling through time.

88
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,080
We just have to stay calm.

89
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,160
Wherever they time jumped...

90
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,360
Whenever they'll come back
to this exact same moment.

91
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,400
{\an5}They're not coming back.

92
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,200
{\an5}Let's go.

93
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,560
{\an5}Look, as a former Eagle Scout
with over 100 merit badges...

94
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,760
{\an5}no big deal.

95
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,360
{\an5}The first rule of getting lost
is stay the same place.

96
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,840
{\an5}That way, you can be found.

97
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,040
{\an5}And as a former member
of the League of Assassins,

98
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,040
{\an5}the first rule when you've been
attacked is to keep moving.

99
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,720
{\an5}I sort of think League wisdom
trumps the Eagle Scouts here.

100
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,760
{\an5}Plus, Savage is still out there.

101
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,240
{\an5}Guys, the rest of the team
would not leave us marooned in 1958.

102
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,440
{\an5}Except for,
that's exactly what they did.

103
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,880
{\an5}You said it yourself,

104
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,920
you have a time machine,
and you're never late.

105
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,880
They're not coming back.

106
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,960
{\an5}One good thing about 1958.

107
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,480
{\an5}No car alarms.

108
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,320
I didn't think they had cars
in Nanda Parbat.

109
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,040
Dated a lot of delinquents
as a teenager.

110
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,000
{\an5}And now we're the delinquents.

111
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,120
{\an5}If we leave Harmony Falls,

112
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,760
{\an5}how's the rest of the team
gonna find us?

113
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,240
We don't know
if they're looking for us.

114
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,280
{\an5}But we know Savage is.
We can't take him.

115
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,840
{\an5}That means we can't stay here.

116
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,440
Let's go.

117
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,040
{\an5}Oh, what did you do
to our apartment?

118
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,720
{\an5}I'm creating a time beacon...

119
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,240
a transponder which matches
the Waverider's quantum signature,

120
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,400
basically creating
a radio wave firewall

121
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,920
that only our team can see.

122
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,600
{\an5}It's cute that you think either of us
understood a word of that.

123
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,720
But I hope it works.

124
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,600
{\an5}In the meantime, maybe we should
invest in some real beds.

125
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,120
{\an5}<i>How you make me scream because</i>

126
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,520
<i>You are no longer my queen</i>

127
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,280
{\an5}Congratulations. You are a doctor.

128
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,200
You know, I thought about
going to medical school once.

129
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,480
Here you go. $10,000 salary.

130
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,680
That's it? I made more as a barista.

131
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,920
{\an5}Well, it's 1958.

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,400
{\an5}You're lucky to make
that as a woman.

133
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,880
<i>Touché.</i>Your turn.

134
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,960
I miss Netflix.

135
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,800
Aha!

136
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,240
{\an5}The time beacon radio
is officially complete.

137
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,960
- Well, great.
- Okay, here we go.

138
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
Come on.

139
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,960
Here we go.

140
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,240
Hope there's a spot on that game
that says <i>Return to the Waverider</i>,

141
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,560
because that's what's about
to happen.

142
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,160
Here we go.

143
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,760
Ooh.

144
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
Oh.

145
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,080
I just have to fix a few
of the kinks.

146
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,440
The next version will be
much less explosive.

147
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,840
Next version?

148
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,120
I thought you said you were
gonna say something to him.

149
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,640
- Say what?
- That your beacon.

150
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,120
It's a waste of time.

151
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,880
They're not coming back, Ray.

152
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,960
And it's not because the Waverider
is broken or they're lost,

153
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,000
or they can't find us, or whatever.

154
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,360
It's because they're dead.

155
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,200
And the sooner that you accept that,
the sooner you can move on...

156
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,960
{\an5}the sooner we can all move on.

157
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,280
{\an5}So, what?
We're just supposed to give up?

158
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,040
On being rescued, yeah.

159
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,560
Sara, what are you doing?

160
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,000
{\an5}I can't stay here.

161
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,000
{\an5}I need to find somewhere I belong.

162
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,000
Sara, wait. You can't go.

163
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,160
Savage is still out there.

164
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,880
Don't draw undue attention
on yourselves.

165
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,640
Sara.

166
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,520
Look, you two have each other.

167
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,520
Most people, in any time period,
aren't that lucky.

168
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,720
Take care.

169
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,680
{\an5}Which gives us mesoscopic polymer
and biomolecular simulations.

170
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,440
Yes, Mr. Gates?

171
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,160
If that's true,
and you can soften matter,

172
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,880
then doesn't that mean you could
theoretically miniaturize an atom?

173
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,240
In theory, yes.

174
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,240
But trust me, you don't want
to try it at home.

175
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,880
And definitely not for at least
another 40 years.

176
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,160
Aren't you supposed to be at home?

177
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,400
I thought you said your son was sick.

178
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,600
Yes, William.

179
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,920
My in-laws are at my house,

180
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,640
so if you don't mind,
I'd rather be in here.

181
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,800
Your son is Bill Gates?

182
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,600
Bill?

183
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,800
That has a nice ring to it.

184
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,240
Midterms are next week.

185
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,480
Go ahead and pick up an exam book
on your way out.

186
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,000
Class dismissed.

187
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,560
- Happy second anniversary.
- Happy anniversary.

188
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,120
I thought we said no gifts.

189
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,320
I know. Just open it.

190
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,360
Your time beacon?

191
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,840
I thought we could
destroy it together.

192
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,200
You don't have to do that.

193
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,360
I want to.

194
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,000
You know, I never thought
that I could build a life...

195
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,560
with anybody but, Anna.

196
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,520
But...

197
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,400
That's exactly what we've done,

198
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,000
in the most unlikely time
and place imaginable.

199
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,680
And I know it may sound strange,

200
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,080
but I'm glad that we were
stranded here.

201
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,080
Me too.

202
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,400
I have one more surprise for you.

203
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,520
Ray.

204
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,160
The beacon.

205
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,760
It's picking up a signal!

206
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
Oh.

207
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,400
Shiby-washo... Sara, so... so...

208
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,800
You are suffering
from linguistic disorientation.

209
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,040
It's a side effect of such
a severe time jump.

210
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,120
I can't hear anything.

211
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,440
- It'll pass.
- What?

212
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,520
Gideon, status update?

213
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,160
<i>I am detecting a time beacon
signaling the Waverider.</i>

214
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,560
<i>- But then again, this is 1960.</i>
- 1960?

215
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,760
<i>The temporal navigation system
was compromised</i>

216
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,000
<i>and did its best to return us
as close as possible to 1958.</i>

217
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,440
Sorry we're late.

218
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,000
Two years.
You left us stranded in 1958.

219
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,200
That was never my intention.

220
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,160
Can't we rev the ship back up,

221
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,360
go back to 1958, and pick that us up?

222
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,840
You know very well that we can't.

223
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,080
Travel back to events we participated
in without time folding in on itself.

224
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
Raymond.

225
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,720
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you. Glad you're back.

226
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
Martin.

227
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,280
It's just...

228
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,080
I have 50 midterms
to grade next week by hand,

229
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,120
and I've just come to terms with
living in technological dark ages.

230
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,520
I have students who count on me.

231
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,800
Kendra and I have friends
and a life...

232
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,880
Ray.

233
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,720
This is what we've been waiting for.

234
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,480
Remember the mission.

235
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,440
We can finally be ourselves again.

236
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,200
Look, I'm sorry. This is all...

237
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,760
very intense.

238
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,160
It's been two years for us.

239
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,280
We thought you guys were dead.

240
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,840
That very well might have been
the case.

241
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,800
Chronos attacked us.

242
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
He sabotaged the ship and took Snart.

243
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,000
We need to recover Miss Lance,
as well.

244
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,280
Where is she?

245
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,760
Uh, no idea.

246
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,320
People go their separate ways,
lose track of each other.

247
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,920
Gideon, search the timeline
for any reference of a Sara Lance,

248
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,160
or a blonde vigilante, circa 1960.

249
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,240
<i>Right away, Captain.</i>

250
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,840
Why did Chronos take Snart?

251
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,000
Couldn't he have taken you all in?

252
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,520
You sound dubious.

253
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,360
If Chronos was gonna settle
for taking one person,

254
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,720
you'd think it would be you.

255
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,320
He took Snart for a reason.

256
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,920
Uh, hello?

257
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,120
A UFO sighting in Hub City in 1960
has created a time anomaly.

258
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,680
It looks like your friends survived.

259
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,080
And what would they be doing in 1960?

260
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,360
That is out of the question,
Mr. Palmer.

261
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,680
What are we talking about?

262
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,040
You changed.

263
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,920
Yeah, I couldn't wait
to get back in jeans.

264
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
So, what's going on?

265
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,760
I have to go back to our apartment.

266
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,840
Why?

267
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,600
Because when we were unexpectedly
picked up by a time ship,

268
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,560
I was not carrying the ATOM suit.

269
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,280
And not for nothing, but we spent

270
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,680
the last two years together
in that apartment.

271
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,200
Is there anything you want me
to pick up for you?

272
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,360
Your favorite coffee mug?
Our lucky water vase?

273
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,080
Lucky water vase?

274
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,760
Yeah, it... it's a long
but endearing story.

275
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,840
Nothing? Don't you care about
anything that we left behind?

276
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,880
Yes, but I don't think that I need
to go back to the apartment

277
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,520
to get any of our old junk.

278
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,080
Old junk?

279
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
We lived there this morning.

280
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,520
We certainly can't leave
Raymond's exo-suit back in 1960.

281
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,320
I'll accompany you back
to your apartment.

282
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,120
We'll recover the future tech
and any lucky ceramics.

283
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,320
- Ray.
- I'll get those blouses you like.

284
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,800
Well, I hope that Sara takes
to being back on the team

285
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,400
better than Ray seems
to be taking it.

286
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,040
Depends, I suppose, on where
exactly she ended up.

287
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,680
Ta-er al-Sahfer.

288
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,680
I can see that the herbs
and meditation are working.

289
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,640
Your thirst to kill no longer clouds
your judgment.

290
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,760
Proceed.

291
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,800
Stand up.

292
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,600
I've enjoyed watching you train.

293
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,800
I have never seen a pupil advance
so quickly.

294
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,760
I've had time to learn who I am,

295
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,720
and what it is I'm meant to do.

296
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,760
We will watch this one closely,
Talia.

297
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,840
There is much you can learn from her.

298
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,160
So, uh...

299
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,400
what's so special about me?

300
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,280
I mean, aside from
my sparkling personality.

301
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,240
Back on the Waverider,
you could've taken your boy, Rip.

302
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,720
But you took me instead.

303
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Why?

304
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,920
Hey, if you're gonna kill me,

305
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,240
you could at least tell me
what's going on?

306
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,080
You should have figured it out
by now.

307
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,640
After all...

308
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,160
I am supposed to be the dumb one.

309
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,640
How?

310
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,080
I think I deserve to know
what the hell is going on here!

311
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,400
You deserve nothing.

312
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,160
Says the man who sold us out
to the pirates.

313
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,600
When I dropped you off
in that forest,

314
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,920
I meant to kill you.
That was the plan.

315
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,680
You should've stuck with the plan
and done me a favor.

316
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,160
I wish there were
some other way, Mick.

317
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,680
You haven't got the guts.

318
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,440
You want to kill me, kill me.

319
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,240
Only one of us is walking
out of here alive.

320
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,360
You're right.

321
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,440
I knew you lacked the guts.

322
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,240
I am sorry, Mick.

323
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,200
I may not have trusted you
on the ship with the team,

324
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,360
but I always, always
was coming back for you.

325
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,840
Seems like one of us
lost track of time.

326
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,000
- Well, how long did you...
- By the time they found me,

327
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,000
I'd nearly lost my mind.

328
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,600
I was so weak,
I was strangling rats to survive.

329
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,200
When who found you?

330
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,440
The Time Masters.

331
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,520
They took me to a place
called the Vanishing Point.

332
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,600
Time doesn't exist there
the way it does on Earth.

333
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,680
I've spent lifetimes
being restored by them,

334
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,920
training by them, fighting by them...

335
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,520
being reborn.

336
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,800
And, when exactly did your
new friends give you the lobotomy?

337
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,440
You think I was hunting
you and your friends

338
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,640
because the Time Masters
made me?

339
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,560
They barely had to ask.

340
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,480
Hey, can we talk for a sec?

341
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,240
Just with everything that's going on,

342
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,880
I don't know that
this is the best time.

343
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,640
You say that like there's gonna be
a better time.

344
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,720
Okay.

345
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,040
Look, we spent every night
the last two years together,

346
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,160
playing board games, eating,

347
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,600
deciding who was gonna cook
and who was going to wash dishes,

348
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,920
falling asleep to
<i>The Ed Sullivan Show.</i>

349
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,760
But the second,
you saw the Waverider,

350
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,600
it was like those two years
never happened.

351
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:49,120
Look, we were both trying to adapt
to an impossible situation.

352
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,080
But you are not a college professor,
and I'm definitely not a librarian.

353
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,360
So, honestly, I'm just excited
to be able to be myself again.

354
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,520
I mean, aren't you even a little bit
happy to be back on the ship?

355
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,120
I was happy with the life
we built together,

356
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,640
what I thought would be our future.

357
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,040
And this just all feels like
moving backwards.

358
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,440
Moving backwards.

359
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,000
What if Sara didn't move
forwards with her life,

360
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,560
she moved backwards?

361
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,200
She said she wanted to go to a place
where she belonged.

362
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,680
What's the one place in 1958
she already called home?

363
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,200
The League of Assassins.

364
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,920
There is one source that we could
check to test your theory.

365
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Gideon, bring up the Shadow Record.

366
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,080
Shadow Record?

367
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,200
<i>The list of every member
of the League of Assassins</i>

368
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,760
<i>since the invention of writing
in 3200 B.C.</i>

369
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,000
Fascinating, except these sheets
of papyrus are entirely blank.

370
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,120
No, no, no.
The League uses invisible ink.

371
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,000
I did my graduate thesis
at the Academy on their history.

372
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,360
Gideon.

373
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,200
Sara said that Ra's al Ghul had lived
nearly a century before she met him.

374
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,680
Thanks to the Lazarus Pit.

375
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,040
It's basically a life-extending
Jacuzzi,

376
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,880
located in a place that's
the opposite of life-extending.

377
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,920
You should count yourself lucky,
Dr. Palmer.

378
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,040
Only a handful of outsiders have been
inside the League's fortress

379
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,920
and lived to tell the tale.

380
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,160
<i>You are correct, Captain.</i>

381
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,120
<i>There is a mention
of a Ta-er al-Sahfer.</i>

382
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,040
That's Sara's League
of Assassins name.

383
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,040
According to the Shadow Record,
she joined the League in 1958.

384
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,200
Incredible, Sara became a member
of the secret organization

385
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,040
that trained her to be an assassin

386
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,400
50 years prior to when
she initially joined.

387
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,720
Sara needs our help.

388
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,640
By all accounts,
Ra's al Ghul is a very controlling,

389
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,320
very homicidal fanatic.

390
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,560
Gideon, chart a course
for Nanda Parbat.

391
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,520
Look, if you're gonna kill me,
just do it already.

392
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,160
I'm not gonna kill you.

393
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,800
I'm gonna to take a trip
back to Central City

394
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,120
and visit your baby sister.

395
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,920
The beautiful thing about time travel
is I get to kill her more than once.

396
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,840
I can kill Lisa in front of you,
go back in time,

397
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,480
kill her in front of you again
and again, and again.

398
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,280
<i>Sir, several anomalies
in the timeline suggest</i>

399
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,560
<i>the Waverider has touched down
in Nanda Parbat.</i>

400
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,800
Chart a course.

401
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,320
I used to think the most beautiful
thing on Earth was fire.

402
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,920
Now I know it's vengeance.

403
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,320
Perhaps, Jefferson and I should...

404
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,840
Extricating Sara from the likes
of the League requires stealth.

405
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,600
So, no firestorm for the two of you.

406
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,880
And you're out of practice,

407
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,840
so no ATOM suit
unless absolutely necessary.

408
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
Look out!

409
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,960
Thanks.

410
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,000
Well done, Jefferson.

411
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,600
You guard the exit while I find Sara.

412
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,160
We will be in and out of here faster
than you can say Ra's al Ghul.

413
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,640
Sara.

414
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,400
It's me.

415
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,280
Rip?

416
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,840
I'm here to bring you back.

417
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,160
I'm so sorry
that it's taken me so long.

418
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,800
- Who else is here?
- The entire team.

419
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,040
Well, except for Mr. Snart.

420
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,760
I'll explain everything
back on the...

421
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,200
Something's wrong.
They should have been back by now.

422
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,840
Well, I think this counts
as absolutely necessary.

423
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,040
I've got my exo-suit shrunk down,

424
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,880
and I can miniaturize
and do some tiny sneaking.

425
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,040
It's been two years
since you've used that suit.

426
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,480
And that's after you scavenged it
for parts for your time beacon.

427
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,920
You don't even know if it works.

428
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,840
Is now really the time
for your little marital spat?

429
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,920
We're not married.

430
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,320
Can we just keep it down, please?

431
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
Sara?

432
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,440
Found her.

433
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Oh, hey.

434
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,560
Hey.

435
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,480
Sara, what the hell?

436
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,800
You shouldn't have come here.

437
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,200
Yeah, I'm starting to get that.

438
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,080
We came here to rescue you.

439
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,040
I don't need to be rescued.

440
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,440
I've found peace here.

441
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,800
Peace with the League of Assassins?

442
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,360
That must be the first time that
sentence has ever been uttered.

443
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,120
Oh, I can't believe I'm back here.

444
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,640
If this is retribution of some kind
for stranding you in 1958...

445
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,720
It is the will of Ra's al Ghul.

446
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,600
Trespassers are to be executed.

447
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,920
We just need a little more time
to get through to her.

448
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,080
Do Time Masters have a different
understanding of the word "executed"?

449
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,640
No, no, no. It's called Time Drift.

450
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,120
When one spends too long
in an alien timeline,

451
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,240
one loses ties with one's
former self... former identity.

452
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,480
Oh, my God.

453
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,600
What?

454
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,840
I didn't understand it before, but...

455
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,120
my powers... they went dormant.

456
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,800
- What are you talking about?
- My wings.

457
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,920
You must have noticed
that I haven't been able to...

458
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,400
hawk out in almost two years.

459
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,800
I just thought
that you didn't want to.

460
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,440
Why didn't you tell me?

461
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,160
Because it was so hard
for you to give up hope

462
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,520
that the team would return.

463
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,720
When you finally did, you started
to be happy again,

464
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,400
and I couldn't bear telling you
that I wasn't.

465
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,360
- That ain't good.
- I had no idea.

466
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,960
Look, Ray,

467
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,840
I loved being with you.

468
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,240
I wasn't just losing my powers.

469
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,720
I was losing my memories
of my past lives.

470
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,360
I was starting to lose myself.

471
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,480
I'm sorry. I...

472
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,680
But, look,
you didn't have to protect me.

473
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,680
I could have handled the truth.

474
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,400
It couldn't have been so easy
for Raymond,

475
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,080
either having to give up being
the ATOM.

476
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,600
I'm sorry.
Can we have a private moment?

477
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,360
I think we all wish you would've had
this moment in private.

478
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,120
Don't you think that we were meant
for something greater

479
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,320
than being stuck in 1960,

480
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,760
eating fondue with the neighbors?

481
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,360
Yeah, we were meant to be tortured
and executed in Nanda

482
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,880
I can't believe I'm back here,
Parbat.

483
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,640
If we die...

484
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,320
at least it would be in pursuit
of a greater purpose.

485
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,160
- That's it.
- What's it?

486
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,120
Ra's al Ghul's purpose
in life is to see

487
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,840
that the League continues with all
of its ancient traditions intact...

488
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,880
Including murdering intruders?

489
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,080
I will appeal to Ra's al Ghul's
respect for the League's traditions,

490
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,520
invoking one of them right now.

491
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,040
Well, what kind of traditions, man?

492
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,160
Guards!

493
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,800
Guards!

494
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,280
Would you mind loosening these up
a little bit before you leave?

495
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,400
Just out of curiosity,

496
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,720
what do you think your new
masters are gonna do with you

497
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,880
once you've delivered
the team up to them?

498
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,120
I don't expect there's a pension plan
for old bounty hunters.

499
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,400
Once they get what
they want from you,

500
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,080
they're gonna toss you aside.

501
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,400
Like you tossed me aside?

502
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,040
You and I both made choices
that led us to this moment.

503
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,920
What matters, Mick,
is your next move.

504
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,240
And I'm willing to bet

505
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:02,160
that some little piece of the old you
is in that armor somewhere.

506
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,040
No. You're wrong.

507
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,480
Mr. Hunter.

508
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,840
Captain, as point of fact.

509
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
Right.

510
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,840
Well, I do hope your request
for an audience

511
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,440
is not an attempt
to justify your trespass here.

512
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,520
Most certainly not.

513
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,040
But it would be remiss of me

514
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,960
if I didn't use this opportunity
to reiterate that Sara...

515
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,560
is very important to me...

516
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,560
to all of us.

517
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,160
And as she is to me.

518
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,760
And as you can all see,
she has chosen to remain here.

519
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,560
Yes, well, if that is her wish,
we will indeed honor it.

520
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,080
Well, thank you.

521
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,680
But your deaths will make
that concession irrelevant.

522
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,560
Well, according to my understanding
of League Law,

523
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,560
the whole death thing can be avoided,
should we prevail at trial.

524
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,040
Yeah, I don't think these guys
are the People's Court type.

525
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,000
I demand a trial by combat.

526
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,520
And how is a man such as you
so well-versed on our traditions?

527
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,040
Do we have an accord?

528
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,800
May victory be yours.

529
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,400
I... I was under the impression
that I would be fighting you.

530
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,720
Then it would seem your understanding
of our laws requires some refinement.

531
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,640
You see,
I may choose any champion I wish...

532
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,120
as may you.

533
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,080
I'll do it.

534
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,160
You haven't had very much experience
in swordsmanship, Mr. Palmer.

535
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,720
I nominate Miss Saunders.

536
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,320
What? No.

537
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,520
Didn't you hear?
She can't even hawk...

538
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,680
I accept.

539
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,160
- Kendra, you can't...
- I've got this.

540
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,800
You have to put a stop to this.

541
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,920
Sara taught Kendra to control
her warrior side.

542
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,320
I believe that Kendra can remind Sara
of her humanity.

543
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,320
Before or after Sara kills her?

544
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,440
Sara.

545
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,160
Ta-er al-Sahfer.
Whatever your name is now.

546
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,960
I know you don't want to kill me.

547
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,760
Want is irrelevant.

548
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,160
I serve Ra's al Ghul.

549
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,640
Remember that move?

550
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,400
You taught it to me.

551
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,520
Your teacher was excellent.

552
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,480
Sara, no!

553
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,360
Sara.

554
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,920
You're not a murderer
or an assassin.

555
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,560
No!

556
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,000
You're the White Canary.

557
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,160
I know that sound.

558
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,720
Chronos.

559
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,960
You can't face him.
You can't defeat him.

560
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,680
You brought him here.
It's only right you kill him.

561
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,760
It's a long story, pal.

562
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,200
Ray!

563
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,960
You son of a bitch.

564
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,280
Don't do it.

565
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,360
Don't kill him.

566
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,600
Snart?

567
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,720
Sorry, don't kill Chronos?

568
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,320
He's not Chronos.

569
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,080
Show them.

570
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,360
My God.

571
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,800
There is no God.

572
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,120
I imagine you have some questions
about what you witnessed.

573
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,120
When the lady you call Sara Lance
first arrived here,

574
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,160
her skills were unmatched.

575
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,160
It was as if she had completed
the training before.

576
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,520
I suppose that's because
you're both from the future.

577
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:48,600
When I came to your doorstep,
for the second time in my life,

578
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,960
I thought that I could find
a home here,

579
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,960
that this is where I really belong.

580
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,600
But your soul is divided...

581
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,720
by your ability to kill
and your desire to show mercy.

582
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,040
And there is no place for one
so conflicted within the League.

583
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,040
Ta-er al-Sahfer,

584
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,040
I release you.

585
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,800
You can reclaim your previous name...

586
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,680
and your past life.

587
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,320
Thank you.

588
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,720
In October 2008,

589
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,040
please see that your daughter
is off the coast of an island

590
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,360
in the North China Sea.

591
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,680
Lian Yu.

592
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,040
Why would I send Talia
on such a journey?

593
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,200
Not Talia.

594
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,680
Your daughter yet to be born.

595
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,520
I'm pretty sure
you'll call her Nyssa.

596
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,400
You think this is all over?

597
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,760
I will kill every single one of you.

598
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,080
I will watch you all burn!

599
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,680
You.

600
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,560
You should have killed me
when you had the...

601
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,400
You owe us an explanation.

602
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,200
Yes, it's quite remarkable,

603
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,920
Mr. Rory is working
for the Time Masters,

604
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,680
considering you killed him.

605
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,160
If you think back,
I never actually said I killed him.

606
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,000
No, you just let us think
that you did.

607
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,960
I didn't have to try too hard, did I?

608
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,040
Well, maybe I should have.

609
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,480
And at least he wouldn't have would
up a chew toy for the Time Masters.

610
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,960
But if you did,
we wouldn't have this opportunity.

611
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,320
An opportunity? To do what?

612
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,200
To reform Mr. Rory.

613
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,280
He killed Aldus.

614
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,440
Under the influence
of the Time Masters.

615
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,360
Chronos killed Aldus.

616
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,720
Mr. Rory was fighting
on our side that day.

617
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,440
I know what it's like to be trained
by an organization

618
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,320
for one purpose to kill,

619
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,920
and the kind of loyalty
that it can inspire.

620
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,000
I need to know that
we can reach Rory.

621
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,960
For my own sake.

622
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,920
The Time Masters took one of our own
and turned him against us.

623
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,880
I say we undo their handiwork.

624
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,200
Rory saved my life back in the gulag.

625
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,320
He's more than just a criminal
and an arsonist.

626
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,480
He's a member of our team.

627
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,920
He's a lost cause.

628
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,800
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure about that.

629
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,880
You will see that miracles abound
on this old time ship.

630
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,640
Gideon,
start the regeneration process.

631
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,040
What you mean regeneration?

632
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,720
I took genetic samples
from each of you

633
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,760
at the start of our voyage
for this exact eventuality.

634
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,360
Why am I only hearing about this now?

635
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,480
Because none of you had lost
a limb yet.

636
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,720
Ow.

637
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,200
So were you gonna tell me?

638
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,520
Sorry, tell you what?

639
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,400
That you were moving
into your room without me?

640
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,720
Oh, I just assumed that
you wanted some space.

641
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,400
You made it pretty clear
that you were over our old life.

642
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,520
Look...

643
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,680
just because I wasn't satisfied
with the circumstances

644
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,680
doesn't mean I didn't fall
in love with you.

645
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,680
It's just, I... I...

646
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,240
I don't want to lose you.

647
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,640
And I don't want to lose you.

648
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,880
For the first time,
in probably centuries,

649
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,560
I actually got to decide
who I want to fall in love with,

650
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,080
instead of having it decided for me.

651
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,920
So it doesn't matter where
or when we are.

652
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,400
You're the person I want to be with.

653
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,000
Wow.

654
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,520
That was... was that like, rehearsed?

655
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,640
Because that was really good.

656
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,760
So...

657
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,920
what do you want?

658
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,880
I believe we're ready to leave 1960.

659
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,360
And go where? I mean, when?

660
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,600
2147.

661
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,440
Mere decades before Vandal Savage
conquered the world.

662
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,160
I thought you had no idea
where he was.

663
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,840
You said Savage had been lost
to history.

664
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,000
Not world-changing history.

665
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,760
Records of the period are scarce,

666
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:21,280
but I've always known that
Vandal Savage can be located in 2147.

667
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,280
So, why haven't you told us
this sooner?

668
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,720
Because that period of history
is fraught with more peril

669
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,200
than I was willing to risk.

670
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,640
We have no choice

671
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,880
but to stop Vandal Savage in 2147...

672
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,960
or to die trying.

673
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,920
Well, I've died before.

674
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,080
So have I.

675
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,920
Gideon.

676
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,120
Plot a course
for Kasnia Conglomerate...

677
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,880
The year 2147.
