1
00:00:35,117 --> 00:00:36,786
<i>Dominic Toretto.</i>

2
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,624
You are hereby sentenced
to serve 25 years to life

3
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:45,627
at the Lompoc Maximum Security
Prison system

4
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:48,714
<i>without the possibility of early parole.</i>

5
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,373
<i>Here's what we know so far.</i>

6
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,960
<i>This is all the aftermath of a daring,
daylight breakout.</i>

7
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,128
<i>There were 26 high-risk
inmates being transferred...</i>

8
00:02:10,212 --> 00:02:12,798
<i>A daring midday breakout where
everyone on board has been accounted for,</i>

9
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,633
<i>except for one, Dominic Toretto.</i>

10
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,801
<i>Police have just released the identity</i>

11
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,303
<i>of the man they believe to have
orchestrated the shocking escape</i>

12
00:02:18,387 --> 00:02:21,014
<i>that amazingly resulted in
no fatalities this afternoon.</i>

13
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:23,976
<i>He is former federal agent,
Brian O'Conner.</i>

14
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,020
<i>A fierce manhunt is underway
for three fugitives tonight.</i>

15
00:02:27,104 --> 00:02:29,898
<i>Multiple federal and local
agencies have joined forces</i>

16
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:31,567
<i>in the search for Dominic Toretto</i>

17
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,945
<i>and his accomplices Brian
O'Conner and Mia Toretto.</i>

18
00:02:35,112 --> 00:02:37,740
<i>But despite every eye in
the country looking for them</i>

19
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:41,410
<i>where Toretto and O'Conner
are now is anyone's guess.</i>

20
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,530
It's got to be it, right?

21
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,890
- Let's get out of here.
- Whoa, whoa!

22
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:32,062
Mia.

23
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,607
Vince.

24
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:40,404
Buster.

25
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:43,783
Come on.

26
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,702
Dom here yet?

27
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,036
No.

28
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,830
When was the last time
you heard from him?

29
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,958
A couple of weeks ago.
Up in Ecuador somewhere.

30
00:04:55,377 --> 00:04:57,588
- How does it feel?
- What's that?

31
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,550
To be on the other side
of a wanted poster?

32
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:04,762
He'll show up.

33
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,055
Yeah.

34
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:13,395
Dom's?

35
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,065
Yeah.

36
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:25,574
Aw.

37
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:28,744
Good night.

38
00:05:54,436 --> 00:05:56,146
Why Rio, Vince?

39
00:05:58,732 --> 00:06:02,653
You mean after you
screwed everything up in LA?

40
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,825
Ended up free-falling through
South America, you know,

41
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,036
hitting every hellhole on the way down.

42
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,623
Would have kept on going if not for Rosa.

43
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:46,947
So, listen.

44
00:06:47,948 --> 00:06:50,159
There is a job coming up.

45
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,202
I was hoping Dom
was going to be here by now

46
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:55,789
but this one is clean enough
we can do it without him.

47
00:06:56,624 --> 00:07:01,128
It's a good gig.
Couple of high-end cars, easy targets.

48
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:05,131
Guy I know is putting
together a team to swipe them.

49
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,509
Just need a few more willing bodies.

50
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,345
I don't know.

51
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,138
Look, the way the car scene is down here

52
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:15,184
we can unload them quick
and get top dollar.

53
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,310
It's easy money.

54
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:19,647
And from where I'm sitting,

55
00:07:20,397 --> 00:07:23,901
it looks like you both
could use the payday.

56
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:04,733
What are you reading?

57
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:06,568
Travel guide.

58
00:08:07,194 --> 00:08:08,237
Yeah?

59
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,575
Tokyo.

60
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,412
Moscow.

61
00:08:19,915 --> 00:08:20,916
Goa.

62
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,001
You want to know what all of
these places have in common?

63
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,211
Huh?

64
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:26,380
No extradition.

65
00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:42,896
Here we go.

66
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:01,123
Excuse me, buddy.

67
00:09:15,512 --> 00:09:17,014
Okay.

68
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,997
Hey, we've found them.

69
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,914
Yeah, second-to-the-last freighter.

70
00:09:54,384 --> 00:09:55,802
What is it?

71
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:59,515
DEA tags. These cars
have been seized.

72
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,432
Look who showed up.

73
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,061
God, I'm so happy you're okay.

74
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,523
I thought I told you to lay low.

75
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:53,235
Been running on fumes.
Had to make a call.

76
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,572
Hey! Quit talking.
We only got the two-minute window.

77
00:10:57,197 --> 00:10:59,074
Let's go, Vince.

78
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,782
Ladies first.

79
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:47,956
Hey!

80
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,459
Hey!

81
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,012
See you, baby.

82
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:20,364
Change of plans.
Wait for my call.

83
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:24,868
Let's go!

84
00:12:42,302 --> 00:12:43,345
Where is she going?

85
00:12:45,013 --> 00:12:46,807
- Where is she going?
- Hey!

86
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:49,393
Hey!

87
00:12:54,022 --> 00:12:57,484
We're being robbed!
Whatever happens, don't stop the train!

88
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,062
Access card!
Get the access card!

89
00:14:46,843 --> 00:14:47,969
Shit.

90
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,871
Bridge! There is a bridge!

91
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,555
Luggage car is clear.

92
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,604
Freeze!

93
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:40,999
Oh, shit!

94
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,573
You had to make a call, huh?

95
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:16,368
Shitty call, O'Conner.

96
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:18,453
Shitty call.

97
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,142
You two stirred up
quite a bit of trouble today.

98
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,312
Three of my men dead.

99
00:17:44,437 --> 00:17:46,815
Three DEA agents along with them.

100
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,400
Of course, this is business

101
00:17:49,484 --> 00:17:51,987
and sometimes things go astray.

102
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:55,490
All I care about is the car.

103
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,826
Tell me where it is, and I'll let you go.

104
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,665
This roofing plastic
says you're full of shit.

105
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:08,252
I don't know how you guys do
business in your part of the world,

106
00:18:08,336 --> 00:18:09,337
but here in Rio,

107
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:13,090
I like it when all parties
know what they're up against.

108
00:18:13,174 --> 00:18:14,592
That's funny.

109
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,262
Because it goes both ways.

110
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:20,181
You know...

111
00:18:23,184 --> 00:18:25,770
I hear your sister is very beautiful.

112
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,649
Wherever she hides

113
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,277
I will find her.

114
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,930
Mia?

115
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:43,890
Hey.

116
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,935
You okay?

117
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:49,938
Yeah, you all right?

118
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,566
Hey.

119
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,199
Hey, yeah.

120
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,702
Just like a Toretto.

121
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:06,913
Where's Vince?

122
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:08,707
That's a good question.

123
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,709
He'll be here.

124
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:12,960
Guys, we're all over the news.

125
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:16,380
They're blaming us for the killing
of those DEA agents on the train.

126
00:20:16,464 --> 00:20:19,550
Which means we just jumped
to the top of the wanted list.

127
00:20:19,634 --> 00:20:22,637
The feds have got to show
everyone their agents are off limits

128
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,306
and they're going to send their best guys.
We got to get out of here.

129
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,393
One thing we know for sure

130
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,479
is that they wanted this car.

131
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:34,398
Because something is in it.

132
00:20:34,482 --> 00:20:38,278
If we find out what it is,
we'll know what we're up against.

133
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:58,255
All right, listen up! The men
we're after are professional runners.

134
00:20:58,339 --> 00:21:01,217
They like speed and are guaranteed
to go down the hardest possible way

135
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,677
so make sure you got your funderwear on.

136
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,596
We find them, we take them as a team,
and we bring them back.

137
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,185
And above all else, we don't ever,
ever let them get into cars.

138
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,460
Crime scene is 10 hours old and counting,
men. Let's go hunting.

139
00:21:16,357 --> 00:21:19,110
<i>Agente</i> Hobbs!
Chief of Police, João Alemeida.

140
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,361
Luke.

141
00:21:20,987 --> 00:21:23,698
Sorry to hear about the loss of your men.

142
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,783
Is all this really necessary
to apprehend two men?

143
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,451
Let me tell you something
about these two men.

144
00:21:27,535 --> 00:21:30,037
One is a former federal officer,
been in deep cover for five years.

145
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:31,956
He knows every way
you're going to come for him.

146
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,126
The other one is a professional criminal,
escaped prison twice,

147
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,753
spent half his life on the
run avoiding folks like you.

148
00:21:37,837 --> 00:21:40,631
Well, if there's anything
we can do to help the DSS...

149
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:42,800
Two things.
One, I need a translator.

150
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,301
We have plenty in the
public relations department.

151
00:21:44,385 --> 00:21:46,221
Elena Neves.

152
00:21:47,847 --> 00:21:49,547
- A patrol officer?
- You heard me.

153
00:21:50,016 --> 00:21:52,143
But why?
We have many more experienced people.

154
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,229
I like her smile.

155
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,231
What's the second thing?

156
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:00,235
Stay the fuck out of my way.

157
00:22:10,578 --> 00:22:12,080
- Brian.
- Hm?

158
00:22:13,581 --> 00:22:14,999
I have something I have to tell you.

159
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,751
God damn.

160
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,586
What a mess!

161
00:22:20,421 --> 00:22:22,090
Where you been, man?

162
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:26,677
You better check that tone.

163
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:28,596
And you just better answer
the goddamn question.

164
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,223
Stop it!
Both of you.

165
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:34,727
Where were you, Vince?

166
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,856
Guys all over the
favelas asking about you.

167
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,525
Couldn't get out of there without
leading them straight to you.

168
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:42,693
Had to wait them out.

169
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:44,528
That is such horseshit.

170
00:22:44,612 --> 00:22:46,697
- That was your job, and those were your guys!
- Hey!

171
00:22:46,781 --> 00:22:48,365
Hey! Enough, O'Conner!

172
00:22:48,449 --> 00:22:50,201
If he said he didn't do it,
he didn't do it.

173
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,452
Go walk it off.

174
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:10,138
Look, I would love to expand
my operations into your countries

175
00:23:10,471 --> 00:23:14,142
but, quite frankly,
your business methods are too violent.

176
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,478
Let me tell you a true story.

177
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:22,066
Five hundred years ago,
the Portuguese and the Spanish came here,

178
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,612
each trying to get the country
from their natives.

179
00:23:27,822 --> 00:23:32,327
The Spaniards arrived, guns blazing,
determined to prove who was boss.

180
00:23:34,662 --> 00:23:37,957
The natives killed every single Spaniard.

181
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:43,755
Personally, I prefer
the methods of the Portuguese.

182
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,007
They came bearing gifts.

183
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:49,344
Mirrors, scissors, trinkets.

184
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:53,931
Things that the natives
couldn't get on their own,

185
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:57,365
but to continue receiving them,
they had to work for the Portuguese.

186
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:01,856
And that's why all Brazilians
speak Portuguese today.

187
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:06,361
Now, if you dominate
the people with violence,

188
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:10,698
they will eventually fight back
because they have nothing to lose.

189
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,450
And that's the key.

190
00:24:13,534 --> 00:24:17,330
I go into the favelas and
give them something to lose.

191
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:20,124
Electricity, running water,

192
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,377
school rooms for their kids.

193
00:24:23,878 --> 00:24:26,798
And for that taste of a better life,

194
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,343
I own them.

195
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,553
Gentlemen.

196
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,735
Pardon me, gentlemen.

197
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,877
Almost wish I didn't see that.

198
00:25:08,214 --> 00:25:10,091
Almost.

199
00:25:10,216 --> 00:25:12,260
Wait, Dom.

200
00:25:12,885 --> 00:25:14,511
Mia was on that train.

201
00:25:14,595 --> 00:25:16,222
My sister!

202
00:25:16,931 --> 00:25:19,433
I didn't know.
I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

203
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,894
You set up the deal!

204
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,605
I thought the job was for the cars.

205
00:25:25,064 --> 00:25:26,774
I didn't know.

206
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:28,276
All they want is the chip.

207
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,030
Damn!

208
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,365
You should've come clean.

209
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:35,992
What's going on out here?

210
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,118
Nothing.

211
00:25:38,202 --> 00:25:41,664
Please, Dom, just let me have the chip.
I can take this to them.

212
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,123
They'll give it to Reyes
and set things right.

213
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:46,002
Get out.

214
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:50,881
What?

215
00:25:50,965 --> 00:25:52,008
Get out!

216
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:02,142
You never listen to me.

217
00:26:02,226 --> 00:26:05,938
Not when I told you
he was a cop, and not now.

218
00:26:06,939 --> 00:26:10,693
You never trust me
and look where it's gotten us.

219
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,071
Look at our family now.

220
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:18,201
I can't go home!
Your sister is stuck in this life!

221
00:26:19,118 --> 00:26:20,286
Where's Letty, Dom?

222
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,873
Where's Letty?

223
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,732
Plasma cutter.

224
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:53,068
Wilkes, I want a list
of every place within 50 miles

225
00:26:53,152 --> 00:26:54,903
that distributes compressed gas tanks.

226
00:26:54,987 --> 00:26:57,073
Pass me that manifest.

227
00:27:03,746 --> 00:27:05,748
Officer Neves.
Been waiting for you.

228
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,251
- You asked for me?
- I did.

229
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:09,961
May I ask why?

230
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,463
My smile is not that great.

231
00:27:16,008 --> 00:27:18,677
Your husband was an officer
who was gunned down in the favela.

232
00:27:18,761 --> 00:27:20,637
Six months later,
you upped and joined the force.

233
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:21,931
You're motivated.

234
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,768
Plus, I figure you're the only
one in Rio who can't be bought.

235
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,270
Am I right?

236
00:27:28,604 --> 00:27:30,689
- Yes.
- Of course I am.

237
00:27:30,773 --> 00:27:31,940
Good news, bad news.

238
00:27:32,024 --> 00:27:33,692
You know I like my dessert first.

239
00:27:33,776 --> 00:27:35,736
Back-checked
the rail line like you asked.

240
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,072
Found a couple of spots
where they unloaded the cars.

241
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,615
One set of tracks headed west

242
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,367
until it hit the main highway,
then disappeared.

243
00:27:42,451 --> 00:27:43,744
But another set of tracks headed east.

244
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,278
A 107-inch wheelbase,
eight-and-a-half-inch tread.

245
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,874
The GT40 that was missing
from the manifest.

246
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,542
Followed the trail a couple of miles.

247
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:51,926
Pretty easy in this scrub.

248
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,712
Can't move without leaving a sign.

249
00:27:53,796 --> 00:27:55,214
Give me the damn veggies.

250
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:58,634
The ground rolls into a hardpack
and we lost that track, too.

251
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,470
Not necessarily.

252
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,932
That road heads up through
the hills into the favelas.

253
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,466
Couple of years ago,
it was washed out by a storm.

254
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,812
It's all dirt a mile from where you were.

255
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:13,065
If they headed that way,
we'll pick up their tracks there.

256
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,400
You come prepared.

257
00:28:15,484 --> 00:28:16,986
I'm motivated.

258
00:28:17,653 --> 00:28:18,696
All right, then.

259
00:28:19,405 --> 00:28:21,490
Let's find ourselves a car.

260
00:28:52,104 --> 00:28:53,147
What do you think?

261
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,691
Well, it's definitely a custom chip.

262
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:59,361
Look at all these side menus
here for data entry.

263
00:28:59,445 --> 00:29:01,280
Let's check this one.

264
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,452
Look at that.

265
00:29:07,536 --> 00:29:09,955
Same building, same order every week.

266
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,041
It's a delivery schedule.

267
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,063
What's this?

268
00:29:35,314 --> 00:29:36,398
Drugs?

269
00:29:36,482 --> 00:29:39,401
No. That's a dealer pack.

270
00:29:39,485 --> 00:29:41,403
See, most major players,
they weigh their money

271
00:29:41,487 --> 00:29:43,363
so they don't have
to constantly count it.

272
00:29:43,447 --> 00:29:44,823
Right there, that's 49 kilos.

273
00:29:44,907 --> 00:29:46,826
49 kilos is a million in twenties.

274
00:29:47,493 --> 00:29:50,162
You're saying each one of these
shipments is worth 10 million dollars?

275
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,372
Yeah.

276
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,022
I thought so.

277
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,067
So what is that?

278
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,819
A 100-million plus in cash houses?

279
00:30:22,903 --> 00:30:24,780
That's how he keeps it off the grid.

280
00:30:27,366 --> 00:30:29,868
I think it's safe to say that
Reyes is smart to want this back.

281
00:30:29,952 --> 00:30:32,902
It's his whole network right there,
just laid out on a chip.

282
00:30:56,517 --> 00:30:57,851
Wilkes, Fusco, up the middle.

283
00:30:57,935 --> 00:30:59,603
Mac, Chato, flank north.

284
00:30:59,687 --> 00:31:01,314
What about me?

285
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:02,523
Stay here.

286
00:31:58,579 --> 00:31:59,664
Come on, go! Go!

287
00:32:57,805 --> 00:32:59,473
Get on the ground.

288
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:03,008
I got Toretto.
Four blocks north of your position.

289
00:33:11,152 --> 00:33:12,945
They already know who you are.

290
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:47,313
Let's go.

291
00:34:22,306 --> 00:34:23,306
All clear?

292
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:24,475
- Clear.
- Clear.

293
00:34:38,322 --> 00:34:39,698
You okay here?

294
00:34:39,824 --> 00:34:43,494
Yeah. I'm good.
Thank you.

295
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:21,193
They're going to be looking
for the three of us together now.

296
00:35:21,277 --> 00:35:23,904
We need to split up.

297
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:26,824
You and Mia head south,
I'll lead them away.

298
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:27,992
No.

299
00:35:28,743 --> 00:35:30,285
Dom is right.

300
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:32,079
Look how lucky we just got.
What happens next time?

301
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:33,205
We have no choice but to split up.

302
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:34,540
I'm pregnant.

303
00:35:39,378 --> 00:35:40,880
I already lost my family once.

304
00:35:42,965 --> 00:35:45,509
I'm not going through that again.

305
00:35:45,968 --> 00:35:48,179
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

306
00:35:53,434 --> 00:35:56,062
I'm not going
anywhere. Okay?

307
00:35:58,439 --> 00:35:59,523
Dom?

308
00:36:00,524 --> 00:36:02,568
Promise me we stick together.

309
00:36:10,326 --> 00:36:12,203
I promise.

310
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:19,252
Our family just got bigger.

311
00:36:37,353 --> 00:36:39,105
Something doesn't add up.

312
00:36:39,563 --> 00:36:41,065
Toretto and O'Conner.

313
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:46,153
They stay when they're supposed to run,
they steal gas then give it away?

314
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,070
Now they're killing federal agents?

315
00:36:49,198 --> 00:36:50,657
It doesn't make any sense.

316
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:52,535
Here's what makes sense.

317
00:36:57,206 --> 00:36:58,790
All these guys are is names on a list.

318
00:36:58,874 --> 00:37:00,292
They come up, we take them down.

319
00:37:00,376 --> 00:37:02,878
Not a phone call more, not a bullet less.

320
00:37:02,962 --> 00:37:04,672
Wilkes, we get anything?

321
00:37:05,047 --> 00:37:06,423
Standard forensics.

322
00:37:06,507 --> 00:37:08,300
Shoe prints.
Hair and fiber.

323
00:37:08,384 --> 00:37:09,509
Prints are all over the car.

324
00:37:09,593 --> 00:37:10,677
Anything else?

325
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:13,055
Yeah, we tracked the owner
off the vehicle ID.

326
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:14,598
There are a couple of
shell companies in between,

327
00:37:14,682 --> 00:37:17,142
but we finally traced
it back to a corporation

328
00:37:17,226 --> 00:37:19,895
owned by an investor down
here named Hernan Reyes.

329
00:37:19,979 --> 00:37:21,063
Investor?

330
00:37:22,189 --> 00:37:25,442
If there's anything illegal
happening in Rio, Reyes is involved.

331
00:37:25,526 --> 00:37:27,152
Okay, then so are we.

332
00:37:27,236 --> 00:37:29,446
If he could get us any closer to our guys,
I want everything on him.

333
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,864
Chato, you're on the roof.

334
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:33,242
I want you on overwatch in case
somebody comes back for something.

335
00:37:33,326 --> 00:37:35,702
Mac, give me a cross-check
on Reyes, full specs.

336
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:37,996
If he goes to the john, I want to
know how many times he shakes it.

337
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,458
- You got it, boss.
- Wilkes, Fusco!

338
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:43,067
Let's put all this mess back together.

339
00:37:45,421 --> 00:37:47,089
That's going to take a while.

340
00:37:47,173 --> 00:37:48,573
Then you better get started.

341
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:50,425
They were taking
this car apart for a reason.

342
00:37:50,509 --> 00:37:53,209
Let's put it back together
and find out what's missing.

343
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:23,334
Hey, Dom,
what do you remember about your father?

344
00:38:25,795 --> 00:38:27,505
My father.

345
00:38:31,675 --> 00:38:33,928
He used to...

346
00:38:34,595 --> 00:38:37,973
He used to have a barbecue
every Sunday after church.

347
00:38:38,641 --> 00:38:41,018
For anybody in the neighborhood.

348
00:38:41,936 --> 00:38:44,686
If you didn't go to church,
you didn't get any barbecue.

349
00:38:46,148 --> 00:38:49,943
Every single day he was in the shop,
and every single night,

350
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:55,032
he was at the kitchen table with Mia,
helping her with her homework.

351
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:59,077
Even after she went to sleep,

352
00:38:59,161 --> 00:39:02,205
he'd stay up for a few more hours

353
00:39:02,289 --> 00:39:06,252
so he could learn the next
chapter and help her the next day.

354
00:39:07,503 --> 00:39:09,403
I remember everything about my father.

355
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:12,091
Everything.

356
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,552
That's just it.

357
00:39:14,927 --> 00:39:16,677
I don't remember shit about my dad.

358
00:39:20,141 --> 00:39:21,600
I don't remember him yelling.

359
00:39:21,684 --> 00:39:23,144
I don't remember him smiling.

360
00:39:25,187 --> 00:39:28,837
To be honest with you, I don't even
remember what the hell he looked like.

361
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,027
I don't remember.
He just...

362
00:39:33,863 --> 00:39:35,239
He was just never there.

363
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,577
You ain't going to be like that, Brian.

364
00:39:56,218 --> 00:39:58,345
We can't keep running, Dom.

365
00:40:00,014 --> 00:40:01,640
We got to get out.

366
00:40:01,724 --> 00:40:03,642
We got to get out now.

367
00:40:04,852 --> 00:40:06,187
You're right.

368
00:40:17,781 --> 00:40:19,450
Here's how we're going to do it.

369
00:40:23,662 --> 00:40:24,872
We're going to use this.

370
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,875
We're going do one last job.

371
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:30,669
We're going to take all of Reyes' money.

372
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:32,546
Every dime of it,

373
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:35,132
and disappear.

374
00:40:38,761 --> 00:40:39,887
Forever.

375
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:42,472
New passports.

376
00:40:42,556 --> 00:40:44,975
New lives with no more
looking over our shoulder.

377
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:46,726
And we're just going to buy our freedom.

378
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:47,853
That's right.

379
00:40:47,937 --> 00:40:49,521
You realize we're talking
about going up against

380
00:40:49,605 --> 00:40:51,148
the most powerful guy in all of Rio?

381
00:40:51,232 --> 00:40:52,691
Yes, we are.

382
00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:56,028
Then we're going to need a team.

383
00:41:02,618 --> 00:41:04,995
Let's run through the bases real quick.
Who do we got?

384
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:06,979
First we're going to need a chameleon.

385
00:41:07,957 --> 00:41:11,835
<i>Someone who can blend in anywhere.</i>

386
00:41:12,753 --> 00:41:13,879
What else?

387
00:41:13,963 --> 00:41:15,005
A fast talker.

388
00:41:15,923 --> 00:41:18,425
<i>Someone who can bullshit
their way out of anything.</i>

389
00:41:18,842 --> 00:41:19,969
I got that.

390
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,263
This guy is going to have
a lot of surveillance.

391
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:25,947
We're going to need someone
who's good with circuits.

392
00:41:27,226 --> 00:41:29,853
<i>And with those circuits,
Reyes is going to have walls.</i>

393
00:41:29,937 --> 00:41:32,587
We're going to need guys
to punch through those walls.

394
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:35,234
<i>What else?</i>

395
00:41:35,776 --> 00:41:37,486
Utilities and weapons.

396
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:40,322
<i>Someone who ain't afraid to throw down.</i>

397
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,241
<i>Someone to back up every position.</i>

398
00:41:43,325 --> 00:41:44,868
<i>Yeah, what else do we need?</i>

399
00:41:44,952 --> 00:41:46,579
<i>Most importantly,</i>

400
00:41:47,663 --> 00:41:49,873
we're going to need
two precision drivers.

401
00:41:49,957 --> 00:41:52,584
Guys that don't crack under pressure.

402
00:41:52,668 --> 00:41:54,128
Guys that never lose.

403
00:41:55,421 --> 00:41:56,714
You know we got that.

404
00:42:24,617 --> 00:42:26,619
Aw, hell, no!

405
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:30,288
I see they really scraped
the bottom of the barrel, huh?

406
00:42:30,372 --> 00:42:32,666
I guess they did, since your ass is here.

407
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:37,462
When are you going to give
Martin Luther King his car back?

408
00:42:37,546 --> 00:42:40,299
As soon as you give
Rick James his jacket back.

409
00:42:43,552 --> 00:42:45,679
- What's up, man?
- What's up?

410
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,067
Hmm.

411
00:42:58,692 --> 00:43:00,860
Sexy legs, baby girl.

412
00:43:00,944 --> 00:43:02,154
What time do they open?

413
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:06,825
They open the same time
as I pull this trigger.

414
00:43:07,368 --> 00:43:08,827
Want me to open them?

415
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:20,964
Hey, anybody can talk shit
in Spanish, homie.

416
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:32,007
- Who are these clowns, man?
- Circus clowns.

417
00:43:33,977 --> 00:43:36,980
I thought cockfights
were illegal in Brazil.

418
00:43:37,064 --> 00:43:39,149
I see you all have met.

419
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:42,944
You know when you called me
to come to Rio

420
00:43:43,028 --> 00:43:45,864
I assumed it would be for
something more exciting than this.

421
00:43:45,948 --> 00:43:46,990
Look at this guy.

422
00:43:47,074 --> 00:43:49,159
- Long time.
- I missed you, man.

423
00:43:49,243 --> 00:43:50,327
Good to see you.

424
00:43:50,411 --> 00:43:52,329
- Brother.
- What's up?

425
00:43:52,413 --> 00:43:54,497
Yo, check this out.
This is Tej.

426
00:43:54,581 --> 00:43:56,499
Best circuit man on the East Coast.

427
00:43:56,583 --> 00:43:58,233
And this is my boy, Roman Pearce.

428
00:43:58,419 --> 00:44:00,670
We go way back, I met this guy in juvie.

429
00:44:00,754 --> 00:44:02,380
I pulled that job with him in Miami.

430
00:44:02,464 --> 00:44:03,882
I've heard about you.

431
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:06,551
Nice digs.

432
00:44:06,635 --> 00:44:08,429
Yeah, well, the Ritz was sold out.

433
00:44:08,971 --> 00:44:10,722
So what's this all about, Dom?

434
00:44:10,806 --> 00:44:14,142
Yeah, man, why did you drag
us halfway around the world?

435
00:44:14,226 --> 00:44:16,019
Because we got a job.

436
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,648
All right,
so our target's name is Hernan Reyes.

437
00:44:19,732 --> 00:44:21,441
And he runs the drug scene down here.

438
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:24,069
He's never been busted because
he doesn't leave a paper trail.

439
00:44:24,153 --> 00:44:26,196
No paper trail means no banks.

440
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,365
And no banks means cash houses.

441
00:44:28,449 --> 00:44:30,867
That's right. Ten of them, to be exact.

442
00:44:30,951 --> 00:44:33,119
Spread throughout the city.

443
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:35,038
And we're going to hit them all.

444
00:44:36,498 --> 00:44:37,624
All of them?

445
00:44:37,916 --> 00:44:39,000
All of them.

446
00:44:39,084 --> 00:44:41,002
That sounds crazy.

447
00:44:41,086 --> 00:44:43,046
You bring us to a whole other country

448
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:45,215
so we can rob the dude who runs it?

449
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,843
I thought this was business.

450
00:44:48,174 --> 00:44:49,467
Sounds personal to me.

451
00:44:50,384 --> 00:44:52,010
Is that what this is?

452
00:44:52,094 --> 00:44:55,890
I got love for y'all,
but personal ain't good business.

453
00:44:57,516 --> 00:44:59,769
I can't do this, homie.

454
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:05,149
So what we're talking
about is $100 million.

455
00:45:05,316 --> 00:45:07,275
You say what?

456
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:10,987
Hundred...
See, sometimes I be over thinking, man,

457
00:45:11,071 --> 00:45:14,116
and I know we just met,
but you just, kind of, got to...

458
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,953
That's right, $100 million,
and everything we take,

459
00:45:18,037 --> 00:45:19,454
we split even.

460
00:45:19,538 --> 00:45:21,538
That's a little over $11 million apiece.

461
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:23,709
I am down.

462
00:45:24,168 --> 00:45:25,211
I'm in.

463
00:45:26,837 --> 00:45:28,255
Eleven million.

464
00:45:28,672 --> 00:45:31,383
Sounds like a whole lot of
vaginal activity to me.

465
00:45:31,842 --> 00:45:34,136
You can't pull off 10 heists
on the same mark.

466
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:35,303
You just can't.

467
00:45:35,387 --> 00:45:36,930
As soon as we hit the first one,

468
00:45:37,014 --> 00:45:39,964
they're going to do everything
they can to protect the rest.

469
00:45:40,726 --> 00:45:42,520
Exactly.

470
00:46:37,568 --> 00:46:38,777
That's all of it.

471
00:46:38,903 --> 00:46:40,070
You a dead man.

472
00:46:40,154 --> 00:46:41,238
You're all dead men!

473
00:46:42,072 --> 00:46:43,622
You don't have a place to hide.

474
00:46:46,577 --> 00:46:47,577
Who's hiding?

475
00:46:47,661 --> 00:46:48,954
Are you crazy?

476
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:50,247
Are you crazy?

477
00:46:50,331 --> 00:46:53,381
Do you know whose house this is?
Whose money are you stealing?

478
00:47:03,677 --> 00:47:05,095
We ain't stealing it.

479
00:47:14,021 --> 00:47:17,107
You tell your boss exactly who did this.

480
00:47:18,776 --> 00:47:20,277
Tell him there's more coming.

481
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:26,992
<i>Voilà.</i>

482
00:47:27,868 --> 00:47:28,994
Turn it over.

483
00:47:35,042 --> 00:47:38,295
She's running on all eight.
Checks out fine.

484
00:47:40,798 --> 00:47:42,716
Keep looking.

485
00:47:44,802 --> 00:47:48,305
Boss, if something
was missing, we'd know.

486
00:48:13,914 --> 00:48:17,584
It's a goddamn shame putting
bullshit like that on a classic.

487
00:48:18,002 --> 00:48:20,004
You may as well slap neon lights on it.

488
00:48:31,265 --> 00:48:33,225
They took the chip.

489
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:37,062
We got a hit on the police scanner.
Armed robbery at a house in Leblon.

490
00:48:37,187 --> 00:48:38,605
Address cross-checks against property

491
00:48:38,689 --> 00:48:40,357
owned by one
of Hernan Reyes' corporations.

492
00:48:40,441 --> 00:48:41,608
All right, if that's our guys

493
00:48:41,692 --> 00:48:44,277
then whatever was on that chip
led them directly to that house.

494
00:48:44,361 --> 00:48:45,528
It's them, for sure.

495
00:48:45,612 --> 00:48:46,947
How do you know that?

496
00:48:47,031 --> 00:48:51,368
Because no one else in Rio
is stupid enough to rob Reyes.

497
00:50:36,807 --> 00:50:39,184
Number One is on the move, man.

498
00:50:53,574 --> 00:50:55,159
Two is on the move.

499
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:20,934
I got mine.

500
00:51:41,872 --> 00:51:43,874
I got eyes on Five.

501
00:52:10,567 --> 00:52:13,904
I know y'all said they were
consolidating the money somewhere, but,

502
00:52:14,238 --> 00:52:17,241
y'all ain't going to believe this.

503
00:52:26,792 --> 00:52:29,294
Well, this job just got a lot harder.

504
00:52:29,962 --> 00:52:31,838
If he's moving it into a police station

505
00:52:31,922 --> 00:52:34,424
he's got some serious
brass in his pocket.

506
00:52:36,927 --> 00:52:38,344
Hell, yeah, we can't do this.

507
00:52:38,428 --> 00:52:41,932
"Can't"? You mean,
"shouldn't."

508
00:52:42,849 --> 00:52:44,935
I think this doesn't change a thing.

509
00:52:48,021 --> 00:52:50,315
I say we stick to the plan.

510
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,108
You say what?

511
00:52:52,192 --> 00:52:53,860
This just went
from <i>Mission: Impossible</i>

512
00:52:53,944 --> 00:52:55,821
to Mission:
In-freaking-sanity.

513
00:52:58,031 --> 00:52:59,282
Whatever, man.

514
00:52:59,366 --> 00:53:02,744
I ain't scared, I'm just letting you all
know, going in that building is crazy.

515
00:53:02,828 --> 00:53:04,288
I got this.

516
00:53:07,874 --> 00:53:09,174
What time was the robbery?

517
00:53:09,293 --> 00:53:11,128
Around 11:00.

518
00:53:12,671 --> 00:53:13,880
Here we go.

519
00:53:16,049 --> 00:53:17,551
Enhance it.

520
00:53:19,678 --> 00:53:21,095
Their faces are covered.

521
00:53:21,179 --> 00:53:22,306
Run it through FRS.

522
00:53:28,395 --> 00:53:30,022
Well, hello, you son of a bitch.

523
00:53:32,899 --> 00:53:35,944
Wilkes! Run the photos of known
associates of Toretto and O'Conner

524
00:53:36,028 --> 00:53:38,878
against customs entries into
Brazil in the last two weeks.

525
00:53:38,989 --> 00:53:42,689
Check planes, trains, boats, everything
short of the goddamn space shuttle.

526
00:53:48,498 --> 00:53:51,548
They can change their names
but they can't change their faces.

527
00:53:51,668 --> 00:53:53,420
Something big is going down.

528
00:53:55,172 --> 00:53:56,548
That's a 1970 Charger.

529
00:53:56,673 --> 00:53:58,758
Fusco! Upload these specs
into the database.

530
00:53:58,842 --> 00:54:01,135
Have the computer cross-check
it with overhead satellites

531
00:54:01,219 --> 00:54:03,263
every 15 minutes, the van behind it, too.

532
00:54:03,347 --> 00:54:06,797
If these vehicles move in the
streets of Rio, I want to know about it.

533
00:55:30,225 --> 00:55:32,727
The beauty of public offices?

534
00:55:35,605 --> 00:55:36,606
Public records.

535
00:55:37,065 --> 00:55:40,465
This is where he's keeping the money.
The vault in the evidence room.

536
00:55:40,569 --> 00:55:44,823
Um. Uh, yeah. Can I get everyone's
attention, right here, for a second?

537
00:55:44,948 --> 00:55:48,618
We're talking about
breaking into a police station.

538
00:55:48,743 --> 00:55:50,411
Is anyone listening to those words?

539
00:55:50,495 --> 00:55:51,997
Anybody? Popo?

540
00:55:52,122 --> 00:55:54,707
Five-O. One-time. Pigs.

541
00:55:54,791 --> 00:55:56,084
People we don't like.

542
00:55:56,168 --> 00:55:59,087
You know, police stations are
designed to keep people in, not out.

543
00:55:59,171 --> 00:56:00,838
That's why it's a stealth mission.

544
00:56:00,922 --> 00:56:03,591
We'll be in and out before
they even know we were there.

545
00:56:03,675 --> 00:56:05,218
Well, we'll need to get eyes in there.

546
00:56:05,302 --> 00:56:07,929
At least to find out the
make and model of that vault.

547
00:56:08,013 --> 00:56:11,308
So the vault and then, so...

548
00:56:11,433 --> 00:56:12,851
It's crazy.

549
00:56:12,976 --> 00:56:15,812
Who's supposed to do all this?

550
00:56:24,279 --> 00:56:26,156
What do you mean?

551
00:56:27,365 --> 00:56:28,408
Why me?

552
00:56:28,492 --> 00:56:30,410
Because you got the biggest mouth.

553
00:56:30,494 --> 00:56:32,496
That's for damn sure.

554
00:56:39,211 --> 00:56:40,337
Ooh.

555
00:56:42,005 --> 00:56:43,548
Hello, beautiful.

556
00:56:43,673 --> 00:56:46,300
Look at those dimples.
Sexy, sexy.

557
00:56:46,384 --> 00:56:48,428
Love those glasses.
Where did you get them from?

558
00:56:48,512 --> 00:56:50,889
Are those like Gucci frames or something?

559
00:56:51,014 --> 00:56:52,182
No English?

560
00:56:52,307 --> 00:56:55,060
No, no, no. Damn.

561
00:56:55,644 --> 00:56:56,686
How are you, sir?

562
00:56:57,145 --> 00:57:00,899
Special Agent O'Conner.
US Federal Bureau of Investigation.

563
00:57:01,024 --> 00:57:02,234
It says Caucasian.

564
00:57:02,526 --> 00:57:05,320
That's a tan.
You know, a tan?

565
00:57:08,198 --> 00:57:12,202
Look, I'm working this case and I
got some evidence here to be held.

566
00:57:12,327 --> 00:57:14,745
But I need to get in and
check your storage facility first.

567
00:57:14,829 --> 00:57:15,830
Nope.

568
00:57:15,914 --> 00:57:19,167
Look, I know you're a true professional,
and I respect you, I promise.

569
00:57:19,251 --> 00:57:21,419
You know, it looks like
you work out a little bit, too.

570
00:57:21,503 --> 00:57:24,005
What do you bench, about 350?

571
00:57:24,381 --> 00:57:25,549
Ah, shit.

572
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:27,925
Look, I'm just trying to do my job, man.

573
00:57:28,009 --> 00:57:30,845
My boss sent me here to just
make sure that everything was safe.

574
00:57:30,929 --> 00:57:31,971
It will be safe.

575
00:57:32,055 --> 00:57:34,098
Let me just come in
and take a quick peek.

576
00:57:34,182 --> 00:57:35,183
Nope.

577
00:57:35,267 --> 00:57:37,769
Come on, man. Hook a brother up, please?

578
00:57:37,894 --> 00:57:39,520
Nope. And you're
not my brother.

579
00:57:39,604 --> 00:57:40,855
Brother from another mother?

580
00:57:40,939 --> 00:57:44,150
Look! No one enters the facility
but authorized evidence personnel.

581
00:57:44,234 --> 00:57:45,443
Now stop wasting my time.

582
00:57:45,527 --> 00:57:46,611
I'm going to call the embassy.

583
00:57:46,695 --> 00:57:48,071
No, no, no!
No, we're good.

584
00:57:48,363 --> 00:57:50,490
We don't need to call them.
For what? We're good.

585
00:57:50,574 --> 00:57:53,159
Here, I got the box.
We're all good.

586
00:57:53,243 --> 00:57:56,162
I promise you.
Thank you so much for your time.

587
00:57:56,246 --> 00:57:58,456
Swear to God, if you were
on the other side of that glass

588
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,917
I'd bust your damn face in.
Now translate that.

589
00:58:18,768 --> 00:58:22,439
It's done. See, I think I make a
better special agent than you ever did.

590
00:58:24,232 --> 00:58:26,568
Well, that depends
on how you define "special."

591
00:58:29,571 --> 00:58:30,863
Come on, now.
Let's see what we got.

592
00:58:30,947 --> 00:58:32,407
Not funny.

593
00:58:39,786 --> 00:58:41,329
All right, come on.

594
00:58:46,626 --> 00:58:48,127
Dawg, you still can't drive.

595
00:58:49,712 --> 00:58:52,674
Now, I see why you're
always getting into accidents.

596
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,050
You can't even drive
a damn remote control car.

597
00:58:55,134 --> 00:58:57,052
I'm going to need you
to shut up right now.

598
00:58:57,136 --> 00:58:59,180
- I'm not going to shut up.
- Shut up.

599
00:58:59,305 --> 00:59:01,005
Strap him in his safety belt, man.

600
00:59:03,893 --> 00:59:05,102
Give me the remote,
dawg. Go left.

601
00:59:05,186 --> 00:59:07,646
It looks like something right
over there to the left. What is that?

602
00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:08,815
What is that?

603
00:59:10,149 --> 00:59:11,234
Bingo.

604
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,362
What is that, six-by-six?

605
00:59:14,487 --> 00:59:15,530
Eight-by-twelve.

606
00:59:15,655 --> 00:59:17,114
Seven-by-twelve.

607
00:59:17,198 --> 00:59:20,326
Fitted with 18-inch-thick
steel reinforced walls

608
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:23,954
with a insulated copper core
to protect against thermal lance.

609
00:59:24,038 --> 00:59:27,499
A Class-3 electronic lock
with a surefire Griffin retumbler

610
00:59:27,583 --> 00:59:29,293
and a biometric palm scanner.

611
00:59:29,377 --> 00:59:31,879
Ten tons of top-of-the-line security.

612
00:59:32,005 --> 00:59:33,631
Do I want to know how you know all that?

613
00:59:33,715 --> 00:59:35,758
I had a life before
you knew me, O'Conner.

614
00:59:35,842 --> 00:59:37,635
Let's just leave it at that, all right?

615
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:39,387
She is a beauty, though, man.

616
00:59:39,512 --> 00:59:41,639
A "beauty" as in "good"?

617
00:59:41,723 --> 00:59:44,433
"Beauty" as in, she's going
to start off playing hard to get.

618
00:59:44,517 --> 00:59:48,812
Then, no matter how much I caress her,
no matter how much I love her,

619
00:59:48,896 --> 00:59:52,191
in the end,
she still ain't going to give up that ass.

620
00:59:53,901 --> 00:59:56,863
It's one of the toughest
vaults to crack in the business.

621
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:58,197
And we ain't gonna get anywhere with it,

622
00:59:58,281 --> 01:00:00,381
unless we got a duplicate
to practice with.

623
01:00:00,742 --> 01:00:01,784
Bet that.

624
01:00:06,247 --> 01:00:07,873
So assuming you'll breach the safe,

625
01:00:07,957 --> 01:00:09,257
how the hell do we get in?

626
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:11,210
Yeah, I've been
thinking about the way in.

627
01:00:11,294 --> 01:00:13,796
The wall to the evidence room,
that's alarmed.

628
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,339
So, that's not happening.

629
01:00:15,423 --> 01:00:18,300
Then we got this one here,
but there's a guard shack outside,

630
01:00:18,384 --> 01:00:20,094
so that's no good.

631
01:00:20,219 --> 01:00:23,890
But this one, this one shares a
wall with the basement bathroom.

632
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:28,185
So, what about the money?
That's gonna be some heavy shit to move.

633
01:00:28,269 --> 01:00:30,396
And you're talking about
five ton cash weight.

634
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,189
Yeah, but that's the thing
about the bathroom.

635
01:00:32,273 --> 01:00:34,984
It's got a vent that
leads to the parking garage.

636
01:00:35,068 --> 01:00:36,735
All we gotta do is pop that vent

637
01:00:36,819 --> 01:00:40,156
and then pass the money
through to some waiting cars.

638
01:00:41,282 --> 01:00:42,825
Leo. Santos.

639
01:00:44,327 --> 01:00:45,411
You're up.

640
01:00:48,498 --> 01:00:51,048
Yo, why you got to be so
negative all the time, man?

641
01:00:56,339 --> 01:00:59,342
I'm telling you, man, you got issues.

642
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:08,776
I got this. Relax, man.

643
01:02:08,943 --> 01:02:10,778
Relax.

644
01:02:25,001 --> 01:02:26,419
Relax.

645
01:02:55,865 --> 01:02:57,065
You're so negative, bro.

646
01:03:23,851 --> 01:03:26,187
Can I have some light?

647
01:03:29,649 --> 01:03:32,026
Got it. We got it!

648
01:03:32,151 --> 01:03:33,944
Yeah, we're looking at four cameras.

649
01:03:34,028 --> 01:03:36,239
Yo, that's some high-end shit, too.

650
01:03:36,364 --> 01:03:37,407
Marker optics.

651
01:03:37,991 --> 01:03:39,826
Hundred-degree field-of-view.

652
01:03:40,076 --> 01:03:41,536
Ten seconds oscillation.

653
01:03:41,661 --> 01:03:43,662
Yeah, that's a narrow window, man.

654
01:03:43,746 --> 01:03:45,414
Can't we just tap in
and replace the image?

655
01:03:45,498 --> 01:03:47,458
No, it's hooked into a digital sync.

656
01:03:47,542 --> 01:03:49,544
They would know we were in the system.

657
01:03:49,669 --> 01:03:51,713
The best we can do is peek.

658
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:54,423
We're going to need some
real fast cars to get through this.

659
01:03:54,507 --> 01:03:55,925
Not just fast.

660
01:03:56,217 --> 01:03:58,386
You got a hard right and a hairpin.

661
01:03:58,511 --> 01:04:00,179
We're going to need something agile.

662
01:04:00,263 --> 01:04:01,972
You guys mock up a track.

663
01:04:02,056 --> 01:04:03,099
O'Conner.

664
01:04:04,392 --> 01:04:05,852
Let's go get some cars.

665
01:04:06,352 --> 01:04:07,729
Nice.

666
01:04:46,684 --> 01:04:49,020
Home sweet home.

667
01:05:06,913 --> 01:05:08,081
Or that.

668
01:05:08,915 --> 01:05:11,375
How about that?
All motor, no tuning issues.

669
01:05:11,459 --> 01:05:13,795
I always wanted one of those.

670
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,548
Held the record on the
Avenida three years running.

671
01:05:20,093 --> 01:05:23,012
You got a lot of balls to bring
your problems here, Toretto.

672
01:05:23,096 --> 01:05:25,973
Not to mention a cop.

673
01:05:26,099 --> 01:05:28,309
Yeah, we can keep that on the low.

674
01:05:28,393 --> 01:05:31,443
Word on the street is a lot of
people are looking for you two.

675
01:05:32,271 --> 01:05:33,314
What?

676
01:05:33,606 --> 01:05:35,406
You didn't think we'd recognize you?

677
01:05:36,734 --> 01:05:38,736
No, we're kind of counting on it.

678
01:05:39,112 --> 01:05:41,562
That little coupe may run
the streets around here,

679
01:05:42,949 --> 01:05:46,994
but that monster has
never seen a set of tail lights.

680
01:05:47,662 --> 01:05:49,162
- Ever.
- Well, she's about to.

681
01:05:59,298 --> 01:06:01,843
Let's go, legend.

682
01:06:02,802 --> 01:06:05,304
Car for car.

683
01:06:05,471 --> 01:06:07,181
Car for car?

684
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,142
You want it, come and get it.

685
01:06:13,813 --> 01:06:15,648
Let's see what they got.

686
01:06:22,113 --> 01:06:23,322
Really?

687
01:06:24,991 --> 01:06:28,202
Where did you get
that from? Papa Smurf?

688
01:06:28,286 --> 01:06:31,164
<i>Okay, O'Conner, give it your best shot.</i>

689
01:06:54,187 --> 01:06:55,229
How was that one?

690
01:06:55,313 --> 01:06:56,397
Camera caught you.

691
01:06:56,981 --> 01:06:58,816
- What?
- Yeah, it still caught you.

692
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:01,400
Man, I was milking the
hell out of that thing, too.

693
01:07:01,652 --> 01:07:03,404
We're going to need a faster car.

694
01:07:07,992 --> 01:07:09,744
I want my money.
Come on, man.

695
01:07:13,414 --> 01:07:14,540
Yeah!

696
01:07:17,084 --> 01:07:18,920
Let's get it! Watch this.

697
01:07:25,593 --> 01:07:29,180
That's exactly why your ass
ain't been driving.

698
01:07:40,733 --> 01:07:42,401
I think I'm in love.

699
01:07:46,197 --> 01:07:47,698
That was real solid work.

700
01:07:47,782 --> 01:07:51,285
I think Camera 3
still caught you, though.

701
01:07:51,369 --> 01:07:52,537
Let's do it again.

702
01:08:00,044 --> 01:08:01,963
That's the piggy bank you ordered.

703
01:08:02,088 --> 01:08:04,048
- You're kidding me.
- Yep.

704
01:08:05,883 --> 01:08:08,636
Where in the hell
did y'all get one of these?

705
01:08:09,387 --> 01:08:11,287
Well, we had a life before you met us.

706
01:08:12,557 --> 01:08:15,810
All right, I'll get to work
on the electronic tumbler

707
01:08:15,935 --> 01:08:18,104
but there's still another problem.

708
01:08:18,771 --> 01:08:20,147
Palm scanner.

709
01:08:20,231 --> 01:08:21,983
And without Reyes' handprint,

710
01:08:22,316 --> 01:08:24,401
Houdini himself couldn't open this bitch.

711
01:08:24,485 --> 01:08:26,487
How do you know it's Reyes' handprint?

712
01:08:26,612 --> 01:08:28,322
You got $100 million in a safe.

713
01:08:28,447 --> 01:08:30,407
You going to put somebody
else's handprint on it?

714
01:08:30,491 --> 01:08:33,243
Now there you go
with that negativity, man.

715
01:08:33,327 --> 01:08:34,661
That shit is eating you alive.

716
01:08:34,745 --> 01:08:35,996
You check that.

717
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,165
Yo, check that.
Shut up!

718
01:08:38,249 --> 01:08:40,399
How are we supposed to get
Reyes' handprint?

719
01:08:41,586 --> 01:08:43,086
Han.

720
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:44,255
You're up.

721
01:08:46,257 --> 01:08:49,010
Sure. Nothing like
the easy stuff.

722
01:08:49,927 --> 01:08:51,637
Let's go. I'll drive.

723
01:09:10,114 --> 01:09:12,033
- I make six bodyguards.
- Seven.

724
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:16,037
You think that guy with
a fanny pack is a tourist?

725
01:09:21,125 --> 01:09:23,544
So, how long were you in the army?

726
01:09:23,628 --> 01:09:26,464
That gun you pulled the
other day was a Jericho 941.

727
01:09:27,798 --> 01:09:29,550
Thumb-racking the slide?

728
01:09:29,634 --> 01:09:31,469
That was straight-up Mossad.

729
01:09:32,511 --> 01:09:34,555
I got out of the military

730
01:09:35,723 --> 01:09:38,725
probably the same time you quit smoking.

731
01:09:38,809 --> 01:09:40,728
The amount of chips you eat,

732
01:09:41,228 --> 01:09:44,314
the way you always have to
keep your hands and mouth busy,

733
01:09:44,398 --> 01:09:46,984
you were a two-pack-a-day man for sure.

734
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:50,696
Unfiltered.

735
01:09:54,367 --> 01:09:55,826
Well, this is a bust.

736
01:09:56,911 --> 01:10:00,330
We're not going to be able
to get his fingerprints out here.

737
01:10:00,414 --> 01:10:03,458
We need to do some more recon,
call in a couple of extra guys.

738
01:10:03,542 --> 01:10:04,835
Or

739
01:10:05,211 --> 01:10:07,421
You don't send a man to do a woman's job.

740
01:11:05,646 --> 01:11:08,441
We're going to figure
this out, I promise you.

741
01:11:11,736 --> 01:11:13,070
What's up?

742
01:11:13,654 --> 01:11:16,157
I thought you were more of a thong man.

743
01:11:16,282 --> 01:11:17,616
We got the print.

744
01:11:19,243 --> 01:11:20,494
Where?

745
01:11:22,496 --> 01:11:24,457
Okay, that's crazy.

746
01:11:26,167 --> 01:11:30,671
So, did he just slap that ass
or did he grab and hold on to it?

747
01:11:33,257 --> 01:11:35,301
Hey, this will work.

748
01:11:35,926 --> 01:11:37,177
I'm impressed.

749
01:11:37,261 --> 01:11:39,262
- Got it?
- Got it.

750
01:11:39,346 --> 01:11:41,396
But you still didn't answer the question.

751
01:11:47,104 --> 01:11:49,439
Oh, no. Guys, guys!
Guys, we have a problem.

752
01:11:49,523 --> 01:11:51,817
The whole team just got burnt.

753
01:11:53,194 --> 01:11:55,112
Now we're all wanted.

754
01:11:57,198 --> 01:11:58,324
How did this happen?

755
01:11:58,449 --> 01:12:01,952
US Diplomatic Security Service
issued the warrants.

756
01:12:02,036 --> 01:12:03,871
Agent I. Hobbs.

757
01:12:04,288 --> 01:12:05,331
Hold on one second.

758
01:12:06,457 --> 01:12:07,500
Hey, Dom.

759
01:12:09,126 --> 01:12:11,026
Is that the guy you saw in the favela?

760
01:12:13,714 --> 01:12:14,882
Yeah.

761
01:12:15,216 --> 01:12:18,719
Hobbs is the leader of the
elite task force for the DSS.

762
01:12:18,803 --> 01:12:19,887
So he's good.

763
01:12:20,012 --> 01:12:23,057
When the FBI wants to find somebody,
that's who they call.

764
01:12:23,182 --> 01:12:24,892
Because he never misses his mark.

765
01:12:25,017 --> 01:12:27,895
This guy is Old Testament.

766
01:12:28,395 --> 01:12:31,398
Blood, bullets, wrath of God.
That's his style.

767
01:12:31,649 --> 01:12:34,067
And right now he's hunting us?

768
01:12:34,151 --> 01:12:35,902
Dom, we got to move up our timeline.

769
01:12:35,986 --> 01:12:37,070
Yeah, but how?

770
01:12:37,154 --> 01:12:40,574
This thing's already been difficult
without Wyatt Earp on our asses.

771
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:43,250
If anything,
we need more room to breathe.

772
01:12:45,246 --> 01:12:46,664
Roman's right.

773
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,919
Think we need to get some fresh air.

774
01:12:55,881 --> 01:12:57,925
We've got a hit.
'70s Charger.

775
01:12:58,050 --> 01:13:00,052
Let's get a move on!

776
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:06,099
Eastbound on Avenida Atlantica.

777
01:13:06,183 --> 01:13:07,560
Move, move, move, move!

778
01:13:13,858 --> 01:13:15,442
It stopped about a block ahead.

779
01:13:16,110 --> 01:13:17,570
Park it.
We're going on foot.

780
01:13:40,885 --> 01:13:41,969
Hey, Toretto.

781
01:13:50,102 --> 01:13:51,729
You're under arrest.

782
01:13:51,979 --> 01:13:53,147
Arrest?

783
01:13:54,398 --> 01:13:56,275
I don't feel like I'm under arrest.

784
01:13:57,067 --> 01:13:58,318
How about you, Brian?

785
01:13:58,402 --> 01:13:59,486
No, not a bit.

786
01:14:01,488 --> 01:14:02,739
Not even a little bit.

787
01:14:02,823 --> 01:14:05,075
Just give it a minute.
It'll sink in.

788
01:14:08,495 --> 01:14:10,997
We didn't kill
those feds. That was Reyes.

789
01:14:11,081 --> 01:14:12,332
I don't give a shit.

790
01:14:12,416 --> 01:14:15,418
I'm just here to bring in two
assholes whose names hit my desk.

791
01:14:15,502 --> 01:14:18,756
Yeah, that sounds like a real hero.

792
01:14:21,759 --> 01:14:23,343
That's funny.

793
01:14:23,427 --> 01:14:26,513
From a guy who took the oath of a cop,
then went against everything it stood for.

794
01:14:26,597 --> 01:14:28,348
Or some wannabe tough guy prick

795
01:14:28,432 --> 01:14:30,882
who beat a man half to
death with a socket wrench.

796
01:14:31,518 --> 01:14:32,686
Yeah, real tough.

797
01:14:33,771 --> 01:14:36,941
You turn around and put
your hands behind your back.

798
01:14:38,108 --> 01:14:39,526
I don't think so.

799
01:14:39,610 --> 01:14:42,310
Your mistake is thinking you
got a goddamn choice, boy.

800
01:14:46,367 --> 01:14:47,952
And your mistake?

801
01:14:48,702 --> 01:14:50,162
Thinking you're in America.

802
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:56,794
You're a long way from home.

803
01:14:59,213 --> 01:15:01,799
This is Brazil.

804
01:15:16,981 --> 01:15:19,233
Come on, boss.
Another day.

805
01:15:20,901 --> 01:15:23,404
Come on, H, it's a lot of heat.

806
01:15:28,659 --> 01:15:30,911
I'll see you soon, Toretto.

807
01:15:32,246 --> 01:15:34,873
I look forward to it, cop.

808
01:16:12,119 --> 01:16:13,120
Yep.

809
01:16:13,245 --> 01:16:14,621
Tracker's on.

810
01:16:15,956 --> 01:16:17,082
Got them.

811
01:17:23,065 --> 01:17:25,484
I don't understand.
Why come here?

812
01:17:26,193 --> 01:17:29,029
Why risk it all for $20 worth of silver?

813
01:17:32,366 --> 01:17:33,659
Because it's worth it.

814
01:17:37,412 --> 01:17:38,997
You should run, you know.

815
01:17:39,706 --> 01:17:41,166
Hobbs will find you.

816
01:17:44,086 --> 01:17:47,047
You have every reason
to leave. Why stay?

817
01:17:54,346 --> 01:17:56,390
Why do you?

818
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:00,102
My husband was a good police officer.

819
01:18:00,936 --> 01:18:02,563
An honest man.

820
01:18:03,939 --> 01:18:05,691
We both grew up here.

821
01:18:06,733 --> 01:18:08,985
Two years ago he was
murdered in the street

822
01:18:09,069 --> 01:18:10,779
right outside our door.

823
01:18:13,282 --> 01:18:17,077
Reyes owns this favela now.
He gives things to people.

824
01:18:19,413 --> 01:18:21,707
But everything has a price.

825
01:18:24,418 --> 01:18:26,128
The people here need a new start.

826
01:18:26,753 --> 01:18:28,255
They need to be free.

827
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:40,090
You didn't kill those men in the train,

828
01:18:40,434 --> 01:18:41,727
did you?

829
01:18:46,273 --> 01:18:49,067
Now, why would you believe
anything I would tell you?

830
01:18:55,949 --> 01:18:57,242
Hey!

831
01:19:00,621 --> 01:19:02,331
Was she so special to you?

832
01:19:07,127 --> 01:19:09,527
I never thought anyone
could understand how much.

833
01:19:12,925 --> 01:19:14,301
But you do.

834
01:19:37,491 --> 01:19:38,492
Yeah!

835
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,171
Close, but not enough.

836
01:19:51,588 --> 01:19:53,173
Dom, the window is too small, man.

837
01:19:53,257 --> 01:19:56,969
Only way we're going to beat
the cameras is with invisible cars.

838
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:02,099
And I know just where to get them.

839
01:20:05,185 --> 01:20:06,478
Let's take a ride, boys.

840
01:20:14,361 --> 01:20:16,446
Don't hurt yourself.

841
01:20:35,048 --> 01:20:37,634
It's been a while since I've been
behind the wheel of one of these.

842
01:20:37,718 --> 01:20:39,868
First time I've ever
been in the front seat.

843
01:20:47,394 --> 01:20:48,979
Rome, what took you so long?

844
01:20:49,313 --> 01:20:53,163
I thought for sure you'd be showing up
with some chrome spinners or something.

845
01:20:54,234 --> 01:20:55,319
Real funny.

846
01:20:56,737 --> 01:21:00,406
<i>I got $100, 000 that says I can
take you all in the next quarter-mile.</i>

847
01:21:00,490 --> 01:21:01,991
Yeah, your broke ass
has got a hundred grand.

848
01:21:02,075 --> 01:21:04,411
<i>If we pull off this job, I will.</i>

849
01:21:04,828 --> 01:21:06,246
<i>The next two lights.</i>

850
01:21:06,538 --> 01:21:07,706
<i>Hundred thousand.</i>

851
01:21:08,665 --> 01:21:11,501
We don't pull this job off,
we're probably dead anyway.

852
01:21:12,002 --> 01:21:14,046
Let's make it a million.

853
01:21:14,921 --> 01:21:17,571
I like that.
All right, a million-dollar quarter-mile.

854
01:21:18,508 --> 01:21:20,052
All right, then.

855
01:21:20,344 --> 01:21:22,888
<i>You only live once.
Let's do it.</i>

856
01:21:23,388 --> 01:21:24,438
What do you say, Dom?

857
01:21:25,098 --> 01:21:26,558
We talking or we racing?

858
01:21:28,018 --> 01:21:29,368
Just don't cheat this time.

859
01:21:29,728 --> 01:21:32,356
Got to let that go.

860
01:21:50,957 --> 01:21:52,459
Yeah!

861
01:21:55,545 --> 01:21:56,629
Typical, Roman.

862
01:21:56,713 --> 01:21:59,132
I'm going to get
this money. I'm hungry.

863
01:22:07,474 --> 01:22:09,274
Don't make it too easy for me, boys.

864
01:22:11,978 --> 01:22:13,063
No!

865
01:22:14,147 --> 01:22:15,941
Not this time, Dom.

866
01:22:20,779 --> 01:22:22,489
You got to want it, Brian.

867
01:22:50,684 --> 01:22:54,521
Yeah! Owned you! Owned you!

868
01:23:09,327 --> 01:23:11,621
- Good race, O'Conner.
- Thanks, Dom.

869
01:23:13,582 --> 01:23:16,376
Do you know how long I've
been waiting for that shit?

870
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:18,420
I told you he didn't see it.

871
01:23:18,628 --> 01:23:20,338
Your man right there?

872
01:23:20,422 --> 01:23:22,840
He let off the throttle at the line.

873
01:23:22,924 --> 01:23:25,635
You didn't do nothing.
He let you win.

874
01:23:26,595 --> 01:23:28,305
Bullshit.

875
01:23:49,451 --> 01:23:52,601
- Vince, what are you doing?
- Quiet! They've been tracking you.

876
01:24:21,691 --> 01:24:23,401
It's okay. Wait!

877
01:24:23,485 --> 01:24:26,488
Reyes' guys were waiting
for me at the market.

878
01:24:27,489 --> 01:24:29,074
Vince saved my life.

879
01:24:34,496 --> 01:24:35,997
You hungry?

880
01:24:39,125 --> 01:24:41,545
- Yeah, sure.
- Good.

881
01:24:43,338 --> 01:24:44,738
Because you're saying grace.

882
01:24:47,717 --> 01:24:49,135
Thanks, Vince.

883
01:24:56,935 --> 01:25:00,355
Yo, this is how my momma
does it. Relax.

884
01:25:02,941 --> 01:25:05,777
Yo, don't you be talking about my momma.

885
01:25:07,946 --> 01:25:10,448
Yeah, come on, baby.
Who's good living?

886
01:25:10,532 --> 01:25:12,658
To you, bro.
Cheers, cheers, cheers.

887
01:25:12,742 --> 01:25:14,994
So, we in Brazil.
It's the good life.

888
01:25:15,078 --> 01:25:16,162
Yeah.

889
01:25:16,246 --> 01:25:19,957
So, you got a little more
than $10 or $11 million coming.

890
01:25:20,041 --> 01:25:21,167
What you going to do with your money?

891
01:25:21,251 --> 01:25:22,960
- Me?
- Yeah.

892
01:25:23,044 --> 01:25:26,344
Actually, man, I been thinking
about opening up a garage back home.

893
01:25:26,715 --> 01:25:29,509
Place where people can bring their
cars and not get completely ripped off.

894
01:25:29,593 --> 01:25:30,718
You know what I mean?

895
01:25:30,802 --> 01:25:32,136
- Really?
- Yeah.

896
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:35,139
So, your dream is to start a day job?

897
01:25:35,223 --> 01:25:37,350
That's stupid.
Like, why would...

898
01:25:37,434 --> 01:25:40,019
No, it's not stupid at all.
I love what I do.

899
01:25:40,103 --> 01:25:41,145
That don't make no sense to me.

900
01:25:41,229 --> 01:25:44,065
I know what I'm going
to do with my money.

901
01:25:46,067 --> 01:25:48,017
Buying some cooking lessons for my man.

902
01:25:48,445 --> 01:25:49,904
See? See?

903
01:25:49,988 --> 01:25:52,281
There you go with that negativity, man.

904
01:25:52,365 --> 01:25:54,408
You know me.
Money ain't a goddamn thing.

905
01:25:54,492 --> 01:25:57,036
It's going to take a little more
than money to learn how to cook.

906
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,371
That's horrible.

907
01:25:58,913 --> 01:26:02,583
But I heard they was looking for
a chef down at this animal shelter.

908
01:26:02,667 --> 01:26:03,751
You might want to...

909
01:26:03,835 --> 01:26:05,545
I know the manager.

910
01:26:10,967 --> 01:26:12,636
Hey, Dom.

911
01:26:15,347 --> 01:26:16,848
Listen.

912
01:26:17,599 --> 01:26:21,310
I know that you're all set
for this job tomorrow,

913
01:26:21,394 --> 01:26:23,145
but if you need an extra man, I could...

914
01:26:23,229 --> 01:26:24,564
You're in.

915
01:26:32,989 --> 01:26:34,539
There's always room for family.

916
01:26:40,997 --> 01:26:42,040
Thank you.

917
01:26:46,628 --> 01:26:47,754
Get something to eat.

918
01:26:49,547 --> 01:26:51,174
Yeah.

919
01:26:53,051 --> 01:26:55,001
Can you believe Mia calls this a curse?

920
01:26:58,556 --> 01:27:00,725
She might be right.

921
01:27:05,063 --> 01:27:07,524
You really like doing that stuff, huh?

922
01:27:07,774 --> 01:27:12,028
When your life is on the line
that's when you learn about yourself.

923
01:27:16,991 --> 01:27:18,743
That's a fair deal.

924
01:27:22,038 --> 01:27:26,167
We're less than 24 hours from
the biggest celebration of our life.

925
01:27:26,251 --> 01:27:28,544
Y'all need a refill.
This is serious stuff.

926
01:27:28,628 --> 01:27:29,920
- No, I'm good.
- Cheers, baby.

927
01:27:30,004 --> 01:27:31,631
I'm good.
No, thank you.

928
01:27:31,715 --> 01:27:32,757
No, she can't.

929
01:27:34,968 --> 01:27:36,970
- What do you mean?
- She can't.

930
01:27:37,303 --> 01:27:39,973
What do you mean
she can't? What is...

931
01:27:44,144 --> 01:27:46,395
Are you serious right now?

932
01:27:46,479 --> 01:27:50,191
Is that the reason you let him
beat you in the quarter-mile?

933
01:27:51,526 --> 01:27:54,779
- That was a baby gift.
- No, that's messed up.

934
01:27:54,863 --> 01:27:56,447
No, you're not taking that from me.

935
01:27:56,531 --> 01:27:58,157
Wait, wait, hold on a second.

936
01:27:58,241 --> 01:28:02,537
So, did he just smack the ass
or did he grab and hold on to it?

937
01:28:02,912 --> 01:28:03,954
Which one was it?

938
01:28:04,038 --> 01:28:06,540
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

939
01:28:06,624 --> 01:28:08,417
How can you keep this a secret?

940
01:28:08,501 --> 01:28:10,503
- Crazy, huh?
- It's your boy.

941
01:28:10,628 --> 01:28:14,174
Why would you keep something
like that away from me?

942
01:28:14,507 --> 01:28:16,301
Baby gift, huh?

943
01:28:16,551 --> 01:28:19,387
- I have no idea what they're talking about.
- Oh?

944
01:28:19,471 --> 01:28:22,474
What happened
to the pull-out method, man?

945
01:28:23,558 --> 01:28:25,602
- Toast.
- Toast.

946
01:28:33,943 --> 01:28:37,197
Money will come and go.
We know that.

947
01:28:38,323 --> 01:28:42,073
But the most important thing in life
will always be the people in this room.

948
01:28:43,119 --> 01:28:44,370
Right here.

949
01:28:46,998 --> 01:28:48,041
Right now.

950
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:04,224
I'm all set.

951
01:29:05,225 --> 01:29:08,228
Yo, Santos. Van good?

952
01:29:09,312 --> 01:29:11,523
You know we're always good, bro.

953
01:29:15,401 --> 01:29:18,154
Hobbs is on the other side of the city.

954
01:29:18,238 --> 01:29:20,823
We're not going to get a better window.

955
01:29:20,907 --> 01:29:23,159
Okay, guys, it's show time!

956
01:29:23,243 --> 01:29:24,827
First team in position, let's go.

957
01:29:24,911 --> 01:29:26,162
Come on, let's do this.

958
01:29:38,466 --> 01:29:39,509
Hey, Dom.

959
01:29:41,302 --> 01:29:42,428
I got eyes on Mia.

960
01:29:47,433 --> 01:29:50,520
Moscow, Bali, Goa, Hong Kong.

961
01:29:51,145 --> 01:29:53,022
And what do they all have in common?

962
01:29:53,106 --> 01:29:54,190
No extradition.

963
01:29:56,276 --> 01:29:59,028
We're one hour away
from the rest of our lives.

964
01:29:59,112 --> 01:30:00,405
Yeah.

965
01:30:02,068 --> 01:30:03,111
Cops!

966
01:30:05,572 --> 01:30:06,907
Come on. Go.

967
01:30:18,543 --> 01:30:20,170
You just made a big mistake.

968
01:30:21,588 --> 01:30:23,688
Took me a while to find
that tracking chip.

969
01:30:24,090 --> 01:30:25,466
But not as long to flip the receiver.

970
01:30:25,550 --> 01:30:27,052
You're going down, Toretto.

971
01:30:27,385 --> 01:30:29,095
I'm right here.

972
01:32:01,229 --> 01:32:03,231
- Dom!
- Stand back. I got this.

973
01:32:11,698 --> 01:32:15,660
- Pull off!
- Dom! Please, stop!

974
01:32:21,249 --> 01:32:22,334
Dom!

975
01:32:31,384 --> 01:32:32,719
Dom!

976
01:33:35,527 --> 01:33:36,570
Yeah.

977
01:33:37,905 --> 01:33:39,865
We're coming in now.

978
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:44,119
Have the marshals meet us
at the airport when we land.

979
01:33:52,044 --> 01:33:53,378
Ambush!

980
01:34:11,063 --> 01:34:14,232
Wilkes, suppression fire.
Shut them down.

981
01:34:18,445 --> 01:34:20,113
Stagger-step. Cover me.

982
01:34:25,118 --> 01:34:26,161
Watch them!

983
01:34:37,756 --> 01:34:38,840
Cut us loose!

984
01:34:38,924 --> 01:34:40,926
Come on! Cut us loose!

985
01:36:49,002 --> 01:36:51,002
- We're good?
- Yeah, let's go, let's go!

986
01:37:23,826 --> 01:37:25,494
Hey, Dom.

987
01:37:31,709 --> 01:37:33,878
You've got to meet my son.

988
01:37:34,170 --> 01:37:35,921
Nico.

989
01:37:40,676 --> 01:37:42,178
I will.

990
01:37:45,055 --> 01:37:46,348
He's a good kid.

991
01:37:50,186 --> 01:37:52,771
You know, we named him after you.

992
01:37:54,565 --> 01:37:55,900
"Dominic."

993
01:38:03,199 --> 01:38:05,201
You've got my word, Vince.

994
01:38:11,707 --> 01:38:13,792
You were always my brother.

995
01:38:23,427 --> 01:38:25,930
I got eyes on Nico now.

996
01:38:36,607 --> 01:38:39,025
We need to move.
We don't have that much time.

997
01:38:39,109 --> 01:38:40,235
I got us a flight out.

998
01:38:40,319 --> 01:38:42,904
We can leave Rio in the
rearview in the next five hours.

999
01:38:42,988 --> 01:38:44,782
Not to run away.

1000
01:38:46,242 --> 01:38:47,785
To finish the job.

1001
01:38:48,619 --> 01:38:51,080
Are you crazy, Dom?
We can't.

1002
01:38:51,622 --> 01:38:53,249
It's a suicide mission.

1003
01:38:54,291 --> 01:38:56,291
That's your man over there on the table.

1004
01:38:57,336 --> 01:38:59,421
The plan is busted!

1005
01:38:59,672 --> 01:39:02,132
This is bullshit, man.
Reyes knows we're coming!

1006
01:39:02,258 --> 01:39:03,634
He's right.

1007
01:39:03,926 --> 01:39:06,762
They tripled the detail
at the police station.

1008
01:39:07,137 --> 01:39:09,431
It's going to be a wall of gunfire.

1009
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,686
Reyes doesn't get away with this.

1010
01:39:13,978 --> 01:39:15,020
It's a trap, man.

1011
01:39:15,145 --> 01:39:16,563
You know that.

1012
01:39:17,147 --> 01:39:19,483
Dom, listen to them.

1013
01:39:20,150 --> 01:39:22,736
Run, before it's
too late. Leave Rio.

1014
01:39:24,113 --> 01:39:25,447
You can be free.

1015
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:29,618
Running ain't freedom.

1016
01:39:31,078 --> 01:39:32,496
You should know that.

1017
01:39:37,584 --> 01:39:40,034
You know you're all free
to make your own choices.

1018
01:39:44,258 --> 01:39:45,342
I'm in.

1019
01:39:54,768 --> 01:39:56,353
I'll ride with you, Toretto.

1020
01:39:59,648 --> 01:40:02,192
At least until we kill
that son of a bitch.

1021
01:40:10,617 --> 01:40:12,202
So what's the plan, Dom?

1022
01:40:13,037 --> 01:40:15,122
We can't just go sneaking around anymore.

1023
01:40:16,623 --> 01:40:18,542
We don't sneak.

1024
01:40:19,335 --> 01:40:22,463
The only thing he
cares about is his money.

1025
01:40:22,713 --> 01:40:24,048
We pull that,

1026
01:40:25,049 --> 01:40:26,467
we pull him.

1027
01:41:12,679 --> 01:41:13,722
You ready?

1028
01:41:15,933 --> 01:41:16,934
I'm ready.

1029
01:43:21,975 --> 01:43:23,351
Call it out, Mia!

1030
01:43:23,435 --> 01:43:25,485
You've got a straight shot
for two blocks.

1031
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:27,981
- Go right.
- Got it.

1032
01:43:50,337 --> 01:43:51,921
Well, the plan is working.

1033
01:43:52,005 --> 01:43:56,885
You guys have every corrupt cop in
Rio on your tail. You have to move fast.

1034
01:43:56,969 --> 01:43:58,052
What's the best route?

1035
01:43:58,136 --> 01:44:01,389
Okay, keep going straight
another half-mile onto Rua Fonseca,

1036
01:44:01,473 --> 01:44:03,392
<i>and then go left.</i>

1037
01:44:07,145 --> 01:44:08,395
That ain't going to work.

1038
01:44:10,274 --> 01:44:11,874
Spikes ahead, Dom.
We got spikes!

1039
01:44:12,276 --> 01:44:13,860
We're going right!

1040
01:44:15,237 --> 01:44:16,529
No, it's too tight,
we're not going to fit.

1041
01:44:16,613 --> 01:44:18,073
We've got no choice. Now!

1042
01:44:37,759 --> 01:44:38,927
Shit!

1043
01:44:45,559 --> 01:44:46,851
Holy shit!

1044
01:44:46,935 --> 01:44:50,185
Guys, I am hearing all this chatter.
Did you just take out a bank?

1045
01:44:58,864 --> 01:45:00,032
Two inbound!

1046
01:45:02,284 --> 01:45:03,743
All right, there's an alley
coming up on your left.

1047
01:45:03,827 --> 01:45:05,495
Yeah, I got it.

1048
01:45:58,882 --> 01:46:00,509
You little bastard!

1049
01:46:23,657 --> 01:46:26,857
All right, good job, Dom.
Right-hander, right here, right-hander.

1050
01:46:32,749 --> 01:46:34,792
Guys, there's a big group
coming at you from the south.

1051
01:46:34,876 --> 01:46:36,670
You have to do something now!

1052
01:46:39,589 --> 01:46:40,674
Hey, go wide.

1053
01:47:13,415 --> 01:47:14,499
Yeah!

1054
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:29,574
You're all clear on the left.

1055
01:48:29,658 --> 01:48:31,493
Good afternoon, officer!

1056
01:48:33,495 --> 01:48:35,914
License and registration, please!

1057
01:48:42,087 --> 01:48:45,006
Yes! This is big-boy stuff!

1058
01:48:45,090 --> 01:48:46,508
We're clear on the right.

1059
01:48:46,758 --> 01:48:47,843
Oh, man.

1060
01:48:54,599 --> 01:48:55,684
Thanks, guys.

1061
01:48:56,059 --> 01:48:57,185
Any time.

1062
01:48:57,269 --> 01:48:58,770
I'll see you on the other side.

1063
01:48:58,854 --> 01:49:01,439
You guys just carved out
a 10-second window.

1064
01:49:01,523 --> 01:49:02,941
<i>Make it count!</i>

1065
01:49:41,688 --> 01:49:42,772
Shit.

1066
01:49:53,158 --> 01:49:54,200
No!

1067
01:49:54,993 --> 01:49:56,077
There's too many of them.

1068
01:49:56,161 --> 01:49:59,011
Hey, there's too many of them.
We're not going to make it.

1069
01:50:01,875 --> 01:50:03,075
You're right, we aren't.

1070
01:50:04,085 --> 01:50:05,127
You are.

1071
01:50:05,211 --> 01:50:06,561
What are you talking about?

1072
01:50:06,713 --> 01:50:09,131
Just let the vault go.
Get out of there.

1073
01:50:09,215 --> 01:50:10,925
You're a father now, Brian.

1074
01:50:11,009 --> 01:50:13,609
No, I'm not leaving you.
Now you stick with the plan!

1075
01:50:13,845 --> 01:50:15,263
It was always the plan.

1076
01:50:16,014 --> 01:50:17,265
<i>Take care of Mia.</i>

1077
01:50:17,349 --> 01:50:19,809
Dom, you listen
to me now. Okay?

1078
01:50:19,893 --> 01:50:21,686
<i>You cut loose right now.</i>

1079
01:53:16,653 --> 01:53:19,364
I thought I told you to go on.

1080
01:53:21,324 --> 01:53:23,535
Yeah, I had to make a call.

1081
01:53:41,136 --> 01:53:42,554
Help me.

1082
01:53:44,931 --> 01:53:46,933
That's for my team, you son of a bitch.

1083
01:53:51,104 --> 01:53:52,814
It's a hell of a mess.

1084
01:53:53,523 --> 01:53:55,150
Yeah, it is.

1085
01:53:56,651 --> 01:53:58,403
You know I can't let you two go.

1086
01:53:58,903 --> 01:54:00,488
I ain't made that way.

1087
01:54:03,241 --> 01:54:05,910
The way I see it,
you've earned yourselves 24 hours.

1088
01:54:07,078 --> 01:54:08,278
The money stays, though.

1089
01:54:09,414 --> 01:54:11,583
If I were you, I'd use the time.

1090
01:54:11,916 --> 01:54:14,919
Make peace with whatever
demons you got left.

1091
01:54:19,382 --> 01:54:21,259
Because come tomorrow,

1092
01:54:22,635 --> 01:54:23,761
I will find you.

1093
01:54:35,607 --> 01:54:36,900
Toretto!

1094
01:54:37,817 --> 01:54:39,110
I'll see you soon.

1095
01:54:41,946 --> 01:54:43,823
No, you won't.

1096
01:55:25,281 --> 01:55:26,365
Thanks, guys.

1097
01:55:26,449 --> 01:55:27,999
I'll see you on the other side.

1098
01:55:32,830 --> 01:55:35,291
<i>You guys just carved out
a 10 second window.</i>

1099
01:55:35,375 --> 01:55:36,626
<i>Make it count!</i>

1100
01:56:19,085 --> 01:56:20,794
Come on, baby.

1101
01:56:20,878 --> 01:56:22,755
Don't be mean.

1102
01:56:25,008 --> 01:56:26,092
Come on.

1103
01:58:49,652 --> 01:58:51,821
Right this way, my dear.

1104
01:58:53,906 --> 01:58:55,906
You stay right here, I'll be right back.

1105
01:58:57,577 --> 01:58:59,745
So, this is your dream, huh?

1106
01:58:59,829 --> 01:59:01,121
It's enough for me, man.

1107
01:59:01,205 --> 01:59:02,581
I take it that's your dream.

1108
01:59:02,665 --> 01:59:05,292
- Absolutely. What up, boy?
- What's going on?

1109
01:59:05,376 --> 01:59:07,169
- You good?
- Yes, yes.

1110
01:59:07,253 --> 01:59:08,420
You know what's crazy?

1111
01:59:08,504 --> 01:59:11,132
There's only four of those
cars in the whole world.

1112
01:59:11,674 --> 01:59:14,174
Yeah, I got the only one
in the Western Hemisphere.

1113
01:59:14,594 --> 01:59:18,890
I made a sheikh in Abu Dhabi
an offer he could not refuse.

1114
01:59:19,223 --> 01:59:21,475
Huh. That's a nice
lady you got there, too.

1115
01:59:21,559 --> 01:59:24,979
Absolutely.
What's happening?

1116
01:59:25,771 --> 01:59:28,023
We got to go, man.
Let's do this.

1117
01:59:28,107 --> 01:59:29,775
Okay, I'll drive.

1118
01:59:29,859 --> 01:59:32,403
In that? Come on, man, no way.

1119
01:59:32,487 --> 01:59:34,780
No, no. Not in this.

1120
01:59:34,864 --> 01:59:36,032
In that.

1121
01:59:42,371 --> 01:59:43,873
Are you serious right now?

1122
01:59:44,707 --> 01:59:46,041
Man, this is crazy!

1123
01:59:46,125 --> 01:59:50,713
Yes, I guess that means there are
two in the Western Hemisphere, huh?

1124
01:59:51,547 --> 01:59:53,883
What's your smart ass got to say now?

1125
01:59:54,467 --> 01:59:57,845
You know what?
We can always shine together, baby.

1126
01:59:57,929 --> 02:00:00,348
Get dressed, man, we got things to do!

1127
02:00:12,735 --> 02:00:14,236
So, where to now?

1128
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:15,821
I don't know.

1129
02:00:15,905 --> 02:00:18,323
Never been to Madrid.

1130
02:00:18,407 --> 02:00:21,160
I thought you wanted to go to Tokyo.

1131
02:00:21,244 --> 02:00:23,370
We'll get there.

1132
02:00:23,454 --> 02:00:25,081
Eventually.

1133
02:01:24,473 --> 02:01:26,309
Nice surprise.

1134
02:01:29,895 --> 02:01:31,564
Crazy, right?

1135
02:01:39,822 --> 02:01:42,825
This is the happiest
I've ever seen my sister.

1136
02:01:43,826 --> 02:01:45,828
It's because we're free.

1137
02:01:59,175 --> 02:02:01,510
You know, I want another shot.

1138
02:02:05,014 --> 02:02:06,098
Yeah?

1139
02:02:08,059 --> 02:02:09,768
Yeah.

1140
02:02:09,852 --> 02:02:11,645
No wagers, nobody else.

1141
02:02:11,729 --> 02:02:13,939
Just you and me, once and for all.

1142
02:02:21,030 --> 02:02:23,130
You sure you can handle
the disappointment?

1143
02:02:23,866 --> 02:02:25,284
Are you?

1144
02:02:27,536 --> 02:02:29,621
All right, O'Conner.

1145
02:02:29,705 --> 02:02:31,540
Let's see what you got.

1146
02:04:59,396 --> 02:05:01,190
You need to look at that.

1147
02:05:05,194 --> 02:05:07,112
Berlin, 3:00 a.m.
this morning.

1148
02:05:07,363 --> 02:05:10,157
A team of drivers
hijacked a military convoy.

1149
02:05:10,241 --> 02:05:12,076
- Toretto?
- Nope.

1150
02:05:13,035 --> 02:05:14,035
I ain't interested.

1151
02:05:14,119 --> 02:05:16,956
Yes, you are.
Keep looking.

1152
02:05:28,467 --> 02:05:30,302
Do you believe in ghosts?
