1
00:01:11,743 --> 00:01:12,869
{\an8}WE LOVE YOU VERY MUCH!

2
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:31,805
Present arms!

3
00:01:44,943 --> 00:01:48,155
I'm responsible
for the death of those men, Eduardo.

4
00:01:50,282 --> 00:01:53,201
And if Escobar is using them
to send me a message,

5
00:01:53,827 --> 00:01:55,287
I will respond.

6
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:57,998
I agree completely.

7
00:01:58,915 --> 00:02:01,043
We have to go in full force.

8
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:05,631
Of course, bringing him back
won't be a popular decision.

9
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:10,302
But since when do we care
about being popular?

10
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:32,532
Colonel Carrillo.

11
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,953
Yes, Mr President.

12
00:05:12,818 --> 00:05:15,987
These cowards are all saying
they don't know anything.

13
00:05:16,112 --> 00:05:18,114
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

14
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,536
These gentlemen think
that they work for the Moncadas.

15
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:23,870
Allow me to clarify.

16
00:05:23,995 --> 00:05:27,457
You have never worked
for the Moncadas.

17
00:05:27,582 --> 00:05:30,627
You work for me,
and you have always worked for me.

18
00:05:30,752 --> 00:05:31,920
- Blackie.
- Yes, boss.

19
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:35,131
Who gave Judy Moncada
the cash to buy this house?

20
00:05:35,257 --> 00:05:36,258
You, Don Pablo.

21
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,634
- Jairo.
- Yes, Don Pablo.

22
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,929
The money that puts food on their table,
where does it come from?

23
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:43,849
- From your pocket.
- Everything you see here is mine.

24
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:50,856
Everything you have
is because I wanted you to have it.

25
00:05:53,525 --> 00:05:58,238
Everything you think you are protecting,
you are protecting for me.

26
00:06:00,198 --> 00:06:01,783
Are we clear on this?

27
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,248
You're going to tell me the location
of every safe house, every lab,

28
00:06:08,373 --> 00:06:10,834
every office and every account
of the Moncadas.

29
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,168
And look...

30
00:06:13,712 --> 00:06:17,048
that doesn't make you traitors.

31
00:06:18,592 --> 00:06:20,385
Certainly not.

32
00:06:21,177 --> 00:06:27,350
You simply didn't know
who was really your boss.

33
00:06:29,853 --> 00:06:31,563
So let's begin...

34
00:06:32,647 --> 00:06:34,482
with what's most important.

35
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:41,823
You're... going to tell me right now...

36
00:06:43,575 --> 00:06:50,498
where that bitch
Judy Moncada is hiding.

37
00:07:09,017 --> 00:07:11,937
- Ms Judy, welcome.
- Thank you.

38
00:07:13,688 --> 00:07:14,773
Pardon me.

39
00:07:16,107 --> 00:07:17,150
Navegante!

40
00:07:17,275 --> 00:07:20,528
- Watch yourself.
- Mrs Moncada is our guest.

41
00:07:20,654 --> 00:07:22,864
We treat our guests with respect.

42
00:07:23,657 --> 00:07:26,534
Even the ones who invite themselves.

43
00:07:29,955 --> 00:07:35,043
Listen, Pacho,
are you sure you have enough men?

44
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:37,796
One might think
you're scared of someone.

45
00:07:41,132 --> 00:07:45,261
Perhaps if you took security
more seriously...

46
00:07:46,096 --> 00:07:49,766
just maybe your husband
would still be alive...

47
00:07:50,642 --> 00:07:53,395
and you wouldn't be here
asking us for help.

48
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:59,275
Listen to this guy.
Who told you I'm here for help?

49
00:08:01,444 --> 00:08:02,445
Where's your boss?

50
00:08:05,323 --> 00:08:07,283
You mean my partner.

51
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:08,994
Handling the business.

52
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,537
Is that right?

53
00:08:10,745 --> 00:08:14,416
So he's still pretending
he isn't a drug trafficker?

54
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:18,712
Mrs Moncada...
why don't you go take a walk?

55
00:08:18,837 --> 00:08:21,715
I don't know, pet the horses.

56
00:08:22,716 --> 00:08:24,926
Or rehearse whatever it is
you came to say.

57
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:28,013
Gilberto will be here shortly.

58
00:08:29,222 --> 00:08:31,558
Thank you, Pacho.

59
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:45,613
Ma'am? Here's what you asked for.

60
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:50,410
Who's that?

61
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:54,205
He's one of the new guys.

62
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:58,793
Excuse me.

63
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,218
POLICE STATION ATTACKED
IN Medellin. 11 MEN DEAD.

64
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:17,687
What a hideous painting.

65
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,135
What a lovely surprise!

66
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,514
- To what do we owe the pleasure?
- Business!

67
00:09:56,935 --> 00:10:01,523
"And one by one, the nights
between our separated cities

68
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:04,609
"are added to the night
that unites us."

69
00:10:04,734 --> 00:10:08,655
It's the middle of the fucking day,
Gilberto.

70
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,116
Not a fan of Neruda?

71
00:10:11,241 --> 00:10:15,954
The only thing that unites us in this life
is a desire to see Pablo dead.

72
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:56,095
Gentlemen.

73
00:12:40,556 --> 00:12:43,851
So tell me, Mrs Moncada,
why did you come all this way?

74
00:12:43,977 --> 00:12:48,273
To help you kill the man
who murdered my husband and brother

75
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:51,985
by offering very valuable information
that only I possess.

76
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,280
- And what is this information?
- Targets.

77
00:12:55,405 --> 00:12:57,615
The location of every one of his labs.

78
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:03,788
Going after Pablo's infrastructure
will cripple him, force him to surface.

79
00:13:03,913 --> 00:13:08,835
And then we put a bullet in his head
and we take turns shitting on him.

80
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,672
What's valuable isn't knowing
what Pablo has,

81
00:13:12,797 --> 00:13:14,841
but what he wants to have.

82
00:13:14,966 --> 00:13:16,968
Because that's where he'll be next.

83
00:13:17,093 --> 00:13:20,596
Pablo is picking apart your operation
piece by piece.

84
00:13:20,722 --> 00:13:23,766
Knowing what remains
tells us where he's going.

85
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:29,689
You want me to tell you
where my labs are?

86
00:13:31,524 --> 00:13:34,944
Well... let's say...

87
00:13:35,778 --> 00:13:39,282
that I share that information.

88
00:13:40,825 --> 00:13:42,076
What happens to my labs?

89
00:13:42,827 --> 00:13:44,537
Oh, Judy.

90
00:13:44,662 --> 00:13:47,373
Your sense of vengeance is
heart-warming.

91
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:50,376
Kiko would be so proud of your priorities.

92
00:13:52,337 --> 00:13:53,796
You're right.

93
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:56,799
He would be very proud of me.

94
00:13:56,924 --> 00:14:00,845
Because Kiko and I
built this business together, Pacho.

95
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,265
I'm from the Medellin cartel.
I know what I am.

96
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:09,354
I don't need to hang bullshit art up
on my wall to prove any different.

97
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:11,439
Wait.

98
00:14:12,482 --> 00:14:14,108
Hold on.

99
00:14:15,026 --> 00:14:20,656
I think confronting Pablo directly
won't help us maintain a low profile.

100
00:14:21,657 --> 00:14:22,742
But...

101
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:30,124
what if the Search Bloc were to learn
where your labs are?

102
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,170
What do we care if he's arrested?

103
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,633
He's already shown
he can fuck us from prison.

104
00:14:38,758 --> 00:14:41,052
This won't end with Pablo in prison.

105
00:14:41,928 --> 00:14:43,554
You think they want to kill him?

106
00:14:45,056 --> 00:14:48,267
There is one officer
that seems particularly determined.

107
00:14:48,393 --> 00:14:51,312
And President Gaviria
has arranged for his return.

108
00:15:31,894 --> 00:15:35,898
Assemble the Search Bloc outside.
I need 100 men and six trucks.

109
00:15:36,023 --> 00:15:38,818
- Tell them we're moving out. Got it?
- On it, Colonel.

110
00:16:06,137 --> 00:16:09,348
- What's up?
- They just left. Four motorcycles,

111
00:16:09,474 --> 00:16:13,436
<i>five pickups, and a truck.
It's a large convoy.</i>

112
00:16:30,828 --> 00:16:32,622
They're heading to Barrio Escobar.

113
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:35,041
<i>It's going to get crowded.</i>

114
00:16:45,092 --> 00:16:46,511
The convoy has arrived.

115
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:02,902
We're in position.

116
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,405
A MAN, A NEIGHBOURHOOD,
A COUNTRY!

117
00:17:23,506 --> 00:17:26,676
Look. Look up there.

118
00:17:26,801 --> 00:17:30,471
There's something weird happening.
What do you see?

119
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:32,807
- They're clouds.
- No, not clouds.

120
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:35,726
Because clouds form shapes.

121
00:17:36,644 --> 00:17:41,190
- What I see is a turtle.
- Boss!

122
00:17:41,315 --> 00:17:44,777
- Excuse me. I need to talk to you.
- Keep looking.

123
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,824
Keep looking at the clouds.

124
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,538
Sir, sorry to interrupt,
but it's very important.

125
00:17:56,414 --> 00:17:58,874
- What's going on?
- Carrillo is back.

126
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:01,752
And he's here in Medellin.

127
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:12,972
What else?

128
00:18:16,892 --> 00:18:20,187
That son of a bitch filled
Barrio Escobar with police and...

129
00:18:21,856 --> 00:18:24,191
he pissed on your mural, sir.

130
00:18:52,637 --> 00:18:56,766
<i>Those fucking cops
are going up 26th Street.</i>

131
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,101
<i>Copy that, brother. All good.</i>

132
00:19:15,326 --> 00:19:19,997
Trujillo, load up six unmarked cars,
four men per car.

133
00:19:20,122 --> 00:19:23,459
Instruct them to leave in 20-minute
intervals to avoid attention. Clear?

134
00:19:23,584 --> 00:19:24,794
- Yes, Colonel.
- OK.

135
00:19:47,858 --> 00:19:49,652
Freeze! Don't move!

136
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:56,367
Relax. Everything's good.

137
00:19:56,492 --> 00:19:57,952
What is this?

138
00:19:58,577 --> 00:19:59,620
<i>Piraña down.</i>

139
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:07,586
Son of a bitch.

140
00:20:11,298 --> 00:20:13,259
Where are you going?

141
00:20:14,135 --> 00:20:18,931
Get him!

142
00:20:19,056 --> 00:20:20,307
Don't move!

143
00:20:21,726 --> 00:20:22,768
Don't move!

144
00:20:22,893 --> 00:20:24,186
- Good evening.
- Yes?

145
00:20:24,311 --> 00:20:27,732
Would you allow me to search
your house? We're looking for...

146
00:20:27,857 --> 00:20:29,442
Stop! Stop, boy!

147
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,609
Stop!

148
00:20:30,735 --> 00:20:32,778
- What's going on?
- On the floor!

149
00:20:43,622 --> 00:20:45,124
Show me your hands.

150
00:20:47,293 --> 00:20:50,087
You think you're slick?
Why were you running?

151
00:20:50,212 --> 00:20:53,007
No! What did I do wrong?

152
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:54,759
You tell me what you did.

153
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,746
Do you know who I am?

154
00:21:26,123 --> 00:21:28,250
My name is Colonel Horacio Carrillo.

155
00:21:29,335 --> 00:21:34,799
Last week... 30 police officers
were murdered in cold blood.

156
00:21:34,924 --> 00:21:37,259
Those pigs deserved it.

157
00:21:41,514 --> 00:21:43,265
Many of them were my friends.

158
00:21:44,308 --> 00:21:49,814
A person on a rooftop,
guiding murderers with a radio,

159
00:21:50,523 --> 00:21:52,650
is a murderer himself.

160
00:21:52,775 --> 00:21:57,196
I hope after this encounter,
you'll reconsider

161
00:21:57,321 --> 00:22:03,661
helping someone
who acts against the law.

162
00:22:07,331 --> 00:22:10,960
What? Am I supposed
to shit my pants in fear?

163
00:22:12,711 --> 00:22:14,088
No.

164
00:22:20,302 --> 00:22:21,887
Do I make myself clear?

165
00:22:22,012 --> 00:22:23,639
I want you to tell your friends,

166
00:22:23,764 --> 00:22:27,142
that this is what happens
when you work for Pablo Escobar!

167
00:22:50,165 --> 00:22:51,292
Take it.

168
00:22:52,543 --> 00:22:53,752
Take it.

169
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,262
Tell them this is for Pablo.

170
00:23:08,851 --> 00:23:10,185
Remember what you saw.

171
00:23:12,563 --> 00:23:16,567
And know what will happen to you
if I see you on a rooftop.

172
00:23:16,692 --> 00:23:18,444
You can leave.

173
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:21,363
Leave!

174
00:23:41,216 --> 00:23:45,220
So, what book shall we read
before bed tonight?

175
00:23:45,346 --> 00:23:46,889
"The Witch".

176
00:23:47,014 --> 00:23:48,682
No, my love. No scary stories.

177
00:23:48,807 --> 00:23:51,352
"The Witch"? What's that?
I don't know it.

178
00:23:51,477 --> 00:23:54,021
Dad reads it to us.
Right, Dad?

179
00:23:54,146 --> 00:23:56,231
The bad witch
and the good witch, right?

180
00:23:56,357 --> 00:23:57,399
Yes.

181
00:23:57,524 --> 00:23:59,401
Not "The Witch", Pablo.

182
00:23:59,526 --> 00:24:02,321
I don't want any more scary stories
in this house.

183
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,496
Love, take your sister
and brush your teeth.

184
00:24:10,621 --> 00:24:12,331
And go straight to bed.

185
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:17,169
Listen, where's my kiss?

186
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,338
Good night.

187
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,425
- Good night, my love.
- Straight to bed, Manuela, please.

188
00:24:40,985 --> 00:24:43,237
I heard a scary story, Pablo.

189
00:24:44,989 --> 00:24:47,658
The man who killed Gustavo
is back in Medellin.

190
00:24:48,534 --> 00:24:50,202
Is that story true?

191
00:24:52,371 --> 00:24:53,956
Yes.

192
00:24:57,209 --> 00:25:01,046
Is that how the government
is trying to negotiate?

193
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,844
Good night.

194
00:25:20,733 --> 00:25:23,652
Someone has to tell you
how things are, Pablo.

195
00:25:26,739 --> 00:25:28,907
That man is here to kill you.

196
00:26:01,565 --> 00:26:03,442
I'm scared, Pablo.

197
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,740
I promise you one thing:

198
00:26:10,824 --> 00:26:14,661
if things get to the point
where I can't control them...

199
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:17,289
we'll leave the country.

200
00:26:21,043 --> 00:26:22,169
OK?

201
00:27:23,814 --> 00:27:26,900
- Have you seen this woman?
- No.

202
00:27:28,193 --> 00:27:30,320
She works at the market.

203
00:27:31,947 --> 00:27:33,240
Sweetheart?

204
00:27:37,411 --> 00:27:38,954
- Are you sure?
- No.

205
00:27:49,673 --> 00:27:51,675
Nobody's seen the bitch.

206
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:53,886
I'm pissed off, brother.

207
00:28:02,436 --> 00:28:04,897
Let's go for some ice cream.

208
00:28:05,022 --> 00:28:06,231
Something cold.

209
00:29:12,673 --> 00:29:14,883
You were different this time, Javi.

210
00:29:20,472 --> 00:29:24,434
I always know when my clients
are trying to forget something.

211
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,399
You know what I do to relax?

212
00:29:32,651 --> 00:29:35,070
- I write.
- You write?

213
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,701
- What do you write?
- Letters.

214
00:29:40,826 --> 00:29:42,869
For my family, but I never send them.

215
00:29:44,371 --> 00:29:45,998
It's good to forget.

216
00:29:59,761 --> 00:30:01,847
What do you want to forget?

217
00:30:08,145 --> 00:30:09,855
Why don't you stop?

218
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,152
Why don't you?

219
00:30:38,675 --> 00:30:40,969
Welcome, brother.

220
00:30:42,387 --> 00:30:43,972
This way.

221
00:30:55,692 --> 00:30:57,652
- What is your name?
- David.

222
00:30:57,778 --> 00:31:02,199
- I'm Pablo. Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you, too.

223
00:31:02,324 --> 00:31:03,575
Follow me.

224
00:31:06,411 --> 00:31:09,081
They told me you like soccer.

225
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:13,043
- I play defence.
- Of course.

226
00:31:14,503 --> 00:31:16,254
Those are the real men.

227
00:31:20,258 --> 00:31:22,219
You're very brave, David.

228
00:31:24,471 --> 00:31:26,139
I'm sorry for what you saw.

229
00:31:27,015 --> 00:31:30,060
The people we're fighting
are very bad people.

230
00:31:30,685 --> 00:31:32,854
Tell me about the man who did that.

231
00:31:36,733 --> 00:31:38,527
He told me to give you this.

232
00:31:51,957 --> 00:31:54,709
I need you to do me one last favour.

233
00:31:56,628 --> 00:31:58,672
It's very important.

234
00:31:59,923 --> 00:32:01,341
You think you can do it?

235
00:32:07,889 --> 00:32:09,599
Thank you, David.

236
00:32:16,189 --> 00:32:19,860
<i>Agent Peña. This is Don Berna.</i>

237
00:32:19,985 --> 00:32:23,113
<i>I have a proposition
you might be interested in.</i>

238
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,658
What a surprise.

239
00:32:32,122 --> 00:32:35,125
What's up, Pena?
Are you expecting anyone else?

240
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,878
No. Are you?

241
00:32:38,003 --> 00:32:40,380
No, it's not necessary.

242
00:32:40,505 --> 00:32:43,675
Everywhere I go,
I'm surrounded by friends.

243
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,762
Sit down. Sit so you can taste
the best coffee in Medellin.

244
00:32:47,888 --> 00:32:51,433
Doña Luz! Bring my friend a coffee.

245
00:32:52,684 --> 00:32:54,978
You have something
other than coffee for me?

246
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:00,901
Look, Agent... I'm not one of those
street-corner informants

247
00:33:01,026 --> 00:33:04,070
that you slip a few gringo dollars
for a tip. No, sir.

248
00:33:04,196 --> 00:33:05,614
Then why are we here?

249
00:33:12,287 --> 00:33:15,790
Agent, you and I
are like the snake and the cat.

250
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,003
If the snake has the chance,
it will kill the cat.

251
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:23,381
And if the cat has the chance,
it will kill the snake.

252
00:33:24,591 --> 00:33:28,970
But there are times
when they both see a big rat,

253
00:33:29,596 --> 00:33:31,932
and they both want to eat it.

254
00:35:24,085 --> 00:35:25,378
Gato!

255
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,259
No! Calm down.
OK, relax. Don't kill me...

256
00:35:32,469 --> 00:35:34,721
Relax!

257
00:35:38,391 --> 00:35:39,851
Detaining the prisoners.

258
00:35:45,273 --> 00:35:47,025
We captured about 45 of them.

259
00:36:43,873 --> 00:36:45,166
Approaching.

260
00:36:55,552 --> 00:36:57,220
We're locking you up.

261
00:36:57,345 --> 00:36:58,555
Move it!

262
00:37:47,103 --> 00:37:48,646
Hello, Valeria.

263
00:37:51,566 --> 00:37:56,446
- I didn't realise you'd be here.
- I wanted to be sure it went well.

264
00:37:56,571 --> 00:38:01,367
- People need to hear the truth, right?
- Yes, it's important.

265
00:38:02,202 --> 00:38:05,830
They forced this boy
to watch his friend get shot.

266
00:38:05,955 --> 00:38:09,626
When the people hear this story,
they'll turn on that son of a bitch

267
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:12,253
who's murdering children
for the gringos.

268
00:38:13,755 --> 00:38:17,425
Well... that's what I hope.

269
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,930
I'm glad you came.

270
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,809
It's good to see you again.

271
00:38:34,901 --> 00:38:37,570
Are all eyes still on you?

272
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:41,616
Except yours.

273
00:38:54,379 --> 00:38:55,797
Let's begin.

274
00:38:57,632 --> 00:38:59,175
Yes.

275
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,052
<i>- How old are you?
- Ten.</i>

276
00:39:02,095 --> 00:39:04,514
I understand
you're quite a soccer player.

277
00:39:05,557 --> 00:39:08,434
Thank you for being brave enough
to tell us your story, David.

278
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:13,064
Tell me, who were the men
who brought you to the building?

279
00:39:13,189 --> 00:39:15,066
They were Search Bloc policemen.

280
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,736
<i>Do you know why
they took you there?</i>

281
00:39:18,862 --> 00:39:21,698
<i>He said they wanted
to send a message to other kids.</i>

282
00:39:21,823 --> 00:39:24,284
<i>Who is "he"?
Do you remember his name?</i>

283
00:39:24,826 --> 00:39:26,327
<i>Colonel Carrillo.</i>

284
00:39:26,452 --> 00:39:28,371
Relax, gentlemen, everything's fine.

285
00:39:29,163 --> 00:39:31,833
- Where are you taking us?
- Bogotà.

286
00:39:33,585 --> 00:39:36,504
You're going to jail
until this gets resolved.

287
00:39:36,629 --> 00:39:40,967
But look...
if you help me, I can help you.

288
00:39:42,051 --> 00:39:46,681
Give me Pablo, or Blackie,
or someone else, then I'll help you.

289
00:39:46,806 --> 00:39:49,434
I don't know where they are.
I don't know them.

290
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:52,437
- So you don't know anything?
- No, sir.

291
00:39:55,773 --> 00:39:56,816
What about you, Gato?

292
00:40:01,112 --> 00:40:02,405
All right.

293
00:40:03,781 --> 00:40:05,825
If it's going to be like this...

294
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:15,543
<i>Who else was there
besides Colonel Carrillo?</i>

295
00:40:15,668 --> 00:40:16,753
<i>A bunch of men.</i>

296
00:40:16,878 --> 00:40:21,841
Some I heard speaking English.
Gringos. Like in the movies.

297
00:40:21,966 --> 00:40:24,010
Are you sure they were police?

298
00:40:25,094 --> 00:40:26,721
Yes.

299
00:40:26,846 --> 00:40:28,222
What now?

300
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:33,061
You think Pablo is going to reward you
for being brave?

301
00:40:33,728 --> 00:40:36,606
Asshole, he doesn't know you exist.
Do you know that?

302
00:40:37,565 --> 00:40:39,734
It's your last chance, Gato.

303
00:40:39,859 --> 00:40:42,362
Ask your mother, you son of bitch!

304
00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:47,218
- Hello.
- <i>Everything's good.</i>

305
00:41:47,802 --> 00:41:50,388
- It worked.
<i>- Very well.</i>

306
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:53,933
It worked.

307
00:41:56,561 --> 00:42:00,481
- They took my lab.
- And a bunch of Escobar's men.

308
00:42:00,606 --> 00:42:03,526
It's for a noble cause, Mrs Moncada.

309
00:42:08,573 --> 00:42:10,575
Boss, forgive me. There's bad news.

310
00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:15,371
Search Bloc took Moncadas'
biggest lab before we took it apart.

311
00:42:15,496 --> 00:42:20,043
Carrillo got Gato. We don't know where
they are or what they're doing to him.
