1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,000
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,080
I want to break up Firestorm.

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,160
If you guys are getting cold feet,
we can call the whole thing off.

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,200
It's time for Jefferson to claim
the power of Firestorm for himself.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,760
This totem is my family's.

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,240
Only my blood may bare it.

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,960
- And they do.
- That's impossible.

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,760
That I am your granddaughter?

9
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,000
Why does Darhk care
if we fix Anachronisms or not?

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,800
That's the thing about daughters.

11
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,960
When they see you die at the hands
of one self-righteous hero,

12
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,880
they really don't want to see it
happen again.

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,360
We're stronger together.
We know that.

14
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,440
Darhk knows that.

15
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,920
Still nothing.

16
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,920
What are you doing, Grey?

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,760
Oh, since...

18
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,960
Gideon took Sara off sedatives,

19
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,480
{\an5}I've been looking for a salient
stimulus to pull her out of the coma.

20
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,920
What the hell is that?

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,440
Salient stimulus, a noise or sound

22
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,680
{\an5}she might have an emotional
connection to that would wake her up.

23
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,440
Here, would you like to give it
a try?

24
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,840
No, actually,

25
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,040
{\an5}I was wondering if you needed
help with our other project.

26
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,760
Uncoupling Firestorm?

27
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,920
Oh, oh, yes, yes, that project.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,480
I've been looking
into those equations

29
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,080
and it's very promising, indeed.

30
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,200
{\an5}All of Firestorm's power
will safely reside in you.

31
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,000
Well, you're the smartest man I know.

32
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,560
{\an5}So, if anybody can figure it out,
it's you.

33
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,040
That's why the smartest man
you know is heading right back

34
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,360
to the lab to double check
his calculations.

35
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,320
Everything okay?

36
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,720
You're hitting the bag like
it's insulting your mother

37
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,720
and you haven't said anything
for like 30 minutes.

38
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,120
What is there to say?

39
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,240
I don't know.

40
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,880
Talk about your granddaughter?

41
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,960
And not the superhero either.

42
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,800
The psycho water witch.

43
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,040
The who?

44
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,120
Your granddaughter.

45
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,880
I mean, I'm sure
she's really not that bad.

46
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,720
You just called her
a "psycho water witch."

47
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,360
Yeah, and I instantly regret it.

48
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,840
{\an5}I'm sure she's just,
you know... confused.

49
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,480
Well, I'm not.

50
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,920
{\an5}Kuasa and I will confront
each other again.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,240
It's inevitable.

52
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
When we do...

53
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,320
I won't hesitate to stop her,

54
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,600
even if she is my granddaughter.

55
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,760
Okay.

56
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,880
Good talk.
Way to get the emotions out.

57
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,640
I really wish I had better news
about Sara,

58
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,960
but she's still in a coma,

59
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,960
thanks to Damien Darhk's
daughter laying her out.

60
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,640
Well, in the meantime,
we could do what we do best

61
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,880
and fix a few Anachronisms.

62
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,600
{\an5}How about you drop me off
on an island

63
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,040
{\an5}full of beautiful women like
Zari did with that Helen chick.

64
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,400
Rory, you weren't supposed
to say anything.

65
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,040
{\an5}Wait, you didn't take Helen
back to Troy where she belongs?

66
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,240
That's what the Time Bureau does,

67
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,400
but we... we do something different.

68
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,880
No, we do it differently.

69
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,800
Yeah, more messy.

70
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,480
Okay, if you look
at the historical record,

71
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,200
the Trojan War happens
with or without Helen.

72
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,160
See? No Anachronism.

73
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,360
How do you think the Captain would
feel about you re-engineering time?

74
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,880
Well, we can argue about that later,

75
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,560
because I know exactly what she'd say

76
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,520
if she wakes up
and finds us doing nothing.

77
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,880
We owe it to Sara
to keep doing our job.

78
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,040
So where do we start?

79
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,000
{\an5}Well, I was thinking we'd just
leave it up to chance

80
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,840
and my index finger.

81
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
Oof.

82
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,840
Vietnam.

83
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,040
1967.

84
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,360
Also known as the height
of the Vietnam War.

85
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,520
Gideon, what kind of Anachronism
are we dealing with?

86
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
<i>A level eight.</i>

87
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,480
<i>Scans of the historical record reveal
redacted Pentagon reports</i>

88
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,800
<i>about a creature of unknown origin
attacking American</i>

89
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,520
<i>and Vietcong soldiers in the jungle.</i>

90
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
<i>Dozens have disappeared
without a trace.</i>

91
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,160
No way I'm going to 'Nam.

92
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,320
{\an5}All I know is that if American
soldiers are being targeted,

93
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,880
I am ready to do my duty.

94
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,360
This war's a little different.

95
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,520
Unlike World War II,

96
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,160
{\an5}the military objectives in Vietnam
weren't so cut and dry.

97
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,680
Yeah, it was controversial

98
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,480
and the reasons for getting
involved were murky.

99
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,360
You know, come to think about it,
this team should be right at home.

100
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,800
{\an5}Sole survivor of the last patrol
attacked was named Ryan Sanders.

101
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,880
He's supposed to be on R and R here.

102
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,760
This doesn't look like a good place
for American GIs

103
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,040
to rest and recuperate.

104
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,640
Looks more like
they're just trying to escape.

105
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,040
Hey, I found our guy.

106
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,440
Mr. Sanders.

107
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,640
We're with the Associated Press.

108
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,720
We wanted to ask you a few questions
about what happened with your squad.

109
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
I don't want to talk about it.

110
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,760
We won't take up much of your time.

111
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,720
Yeah, people need to hear your story.

112
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,720
You could save lives
telling us what you saw.

113
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,480
{\an5}It must have stalked us
for several clicks.

114
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,240
Took us by surprise.

115
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,920
Whatever was out there
was pure evil,

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,400
and it had a message for us.

117
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,760
Stay out of the jungle.

118
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,160
I hate the jungle.

119
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,760
You sure this is the right way?

120
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,480
Well, according to the field reports,

121
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,360
the last known location
of Alpha Team was right... here.

122
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,720
I should have stayed in Aruba.

123
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,440
What could have taken out
a whole patrol of U.S. soldiers?

124
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,760
Nothing good.

125
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,760
But this missing squad's
gonna stay missing.

126
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,680
Let's get out of here.

127
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,840
Hope Mick and Nate
are watching their backs.

128
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,240
{\an5}If what Sanders said is true,
they're in real danger.

129
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,000
Who knows if what he said was true?

130
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,520
He was clearly intoxicated.

131
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,640
Forget about him.

132
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,960
{\an5}I think I found someone
who can tell us what's going on.

133
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,680
Hey, you've been staring at us
since we got here.

134
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,840
I heard you asking about the jungle.

135
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,480
It can be a dangerous place even
if you are carrying a machine gun.

136
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,680
Well, we're journalists here...

137
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,960
Who the hell are you?

138
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,400
My name is Anh Ly.

139
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,920
And I know what's out in that jungle.

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,720
You've seen what's been
attacking these soldiers?

141
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,040
Attacking them?

142
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,240
Come with me.

143
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,400
I won't just tell you
what's happening.

144
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,920
I'll show you.

145
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,760
Too many trees.

146
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,000
Too many plants.

147
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,080
We'll be back on concrete in no time.

148
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,960
Bugs!

149
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,240
Flies.

150
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,440
What's going on with you?

151
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,000
You're grumpier than usual.

152
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,160
What?

153
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,400
I'm in a good mood.

154
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,080
Is it because I made your boots
too big?

155
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,920
Look, I forget you've got small feet

156
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,680
and why would you not want
to come to Vietnam?

157
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,320
This place was like made for you.

158
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
My dad.

159
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,440
What about him?

160
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,440
He's here. 'Nam, the war.

161
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,040
Oh, buddy, you don't really think
you're gonna see him, do you?

162
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,440
There's almost no chance

163
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,440
we're gonna run into your father
in a jungle this big.

164
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,840
You said, "almost,"
meaning there is a chance.

165
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,040
I'll buy you a six-pack
if we bump into him.

166
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,600
Hands up, pretty boy.

167
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,720
You owe me a six-pack.

168
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,080
No.

169
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,440
Hands up.

170
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,640
Now.

171
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,280
Dude, what are you doing?

172
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,080
I'm Operations Officer
Nathaniel Heywood of the CIA.

173
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,720
This is my partner...

174
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,960
Officer Schwarzenegger.

175
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,920
We're here to investigate the
disappearance of Alpha Team.

176
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,560
Can't be too careful.

177
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,000
Sergeant Dick Rory, Echo Team.

178
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,000
I think it's in our mutual
best interest

179
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,720
if we conduct
this investigation together,

180
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
find out what happened to our men.

181
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,120
Actually, we were just leaving.

182
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,480
Sounds like a plan,

183
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,440
but I got to say, your partner here
doesn't look so gung ho.

184
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,960
Give us a minute.

185
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,480
Look, I'm sorry
you have to see your father,

186
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,080
but you need to suck it up.

187
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,000
If it wasn't for this time-travelling
stuff...

188
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,720
I would've never run into
that bastard.

189
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
Okay, you know what?

190
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
We're changing this operation.

191
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,880
This has become
Operation Tough Love.

192
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,760
Yeah, I'm gonna go all Dr. Phil
on your ass.

193
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,280
It's time for you to man up
and sort out...

194
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,600
Daddy issues.

195
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,200
I was going to say unresolved grief,

196
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,000
but let's go with what you're saying.

197
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,920
You want to know
why I've never seen a shrink?

198
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,080
Why?

199
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,720
I don't regret killing my old man.

200
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,960
What?

201
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,600
That's right, Pretty. You heard me.

202
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,360
I let my old man burn to death.

203
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,320
How's that for tough love?

204
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,800
Pecan.

205
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,520
Oh, hell nah.

206
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,320
What kind of monster eats
my mom's pecan pie

207
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,760
and puts the container
back in the fridge?

208
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,520
Gideon, who is the thief?

209
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,560
There must be a theorem
that supports the deceleration

210
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,400
of the subject's rate of fission

211
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,360
to individually power the thermacore.

212
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,640
Any insights, Sir Isaac Newton?

213
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,360
Or do I have to throw an apple
at your head?

214
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,840
Perhaps if you afforded us
a brief reprieve.

215
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,920
We've been working for hours.

216
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,280
And when, dare I ask,
do I get to return home?

217
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,440
You'll go home
when I say you can, Galileo.

218
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,560
What about you, Madame Curie?

219
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,280
You've been awfully quiet.

220
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,040
How many time do I have to
explain it to you, Martin?

221
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,600
There's only one way to safely
split the thermacore.

222
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,520
Yes, but doing so would result
in both

223
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,920
Jefferson and I losing our powers.

224
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,160
I personally have no compunctions
about that, but Jefferson...

225
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
There you are.

226
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
My colleagues and I were just...

227
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,200
You didn't have to lie to me
if you couldn't find a solution, man.

228
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,480
Look, I'm sure it's not easy learning

229
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,480
that your granddaughter's
in league with Damien Darhk.

230
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,720
If you ever want to talk about it...

231
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,960
What happened to men?

232
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,560
When did you all start talking
about your feelings?

233
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,920
Early '90s?

234
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,960
You are unusual journalists.

235
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,680
Yeah, tell me about it.

236
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,760
Most people run away

237
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,600
when they hear about a monster
grabbing soldiers in the jungle.

238
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,760
Us, we run towards it.

239
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,400
Monster?

240
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,520
What kind of monster
stops the fighting

241
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,600
between the Americans
and the Vietcong?

242
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,440
He's no monster.

243
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,520
He's Ong Troi Moi.

244
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,920
The New God.

245
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,080
Hey, what's going on?

246
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,840
Must be some sort of dead zone.

247
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,720
We are here.

248
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,040
Ray, can you hear me?

249
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,200
Can't go a whole day without
talking to your boyfriend, huh?

250
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,600
I think the comms are down.

251
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,720
Don't drink the ground water.

252
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,160
It's probably contaminated.

253
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,240
Those are some pretty rough burns
you got there, son.

254
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,360
You get hit by Napalm?

255
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,840
I ain't your son.

256
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,080
Yeah.

257
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,800
Do you know
what's on your father's head?

258
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,320
A little French-ie hat.

259
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,840
That is a Green Beret.

260
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,120
President Kennedy called them

261
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,440
"a symbol of excellence,
a badge of courage."

262
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,000
- Courage?
- Yeah.

263
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,400
The only thing my old man was
good at was sitting in a chair.

264
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,520
Cigarette in one hand,
beer in the other.

265
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,840
And the only time
he ever got up was to...

266
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
No, Mick, come on.

267
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,880
Come on, come on. This is good,
this is good. Look.

268
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,600
Thanks to time travel,
I got to talk to my grandfather

269
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,960
and I got to work out
a lot of my father issues.

270
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,080
Stand down. Stand down.

271
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,720
Is that you, Petey Adams?

272
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,360
What are you doing out here
on your own?

273
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,800
You get lost or something?

274
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,880
Lost?

275
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,440
No, I've become enlightened.

276
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,360
You can be enlightened too
if you join us.

277
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720
Who's us?

278
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,640
This country does not belong to you.

279
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,560
It belongs to Ong Troi Moi.

280
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,040
I don't like where this is heading.

281
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,560
Handle me that rifle, Petey.

282
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,280
We'll work on getting you a hot meal.

283
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,600
You will surrender to him.

284
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,840
Or die.

285
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,960
Get off me.

286
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,120
Bunch of damn traitors.

287
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,640
American and North Vietnamese
soldiers working arm-in-arm?

288
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,040
This Anachronism is even crazier
than we thought.

289
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,360
And I think I know how they're
blocking our communications.

290
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,760
Hey, what is this place?

291
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,320
I thought we were looking
for a monster.

292
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,640
You wish to speak to Ong Troi Moi?

293
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,120
I've got a really bad feeling
about this.

294
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,640
We'd be honored.

295
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,360
We have guests.

296
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,280
They're reporters, as you wanted.

297
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,800
I am Grodd.

298
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,160
Welcome to my kingdom.

299
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,880
You saw what I saw, right?

300
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,520
There's a gorilla
sitting on a throne?

301
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,240
He spoke better English
than Mick.

302
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,760
Well, he's clearly intelligent enough

303
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,480
to trick these GIs
to abandon their posts.

304
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,000
He's a monster.

305
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,600
He needs to be stopped.

306
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,400
Look, he's turned these men
into his slaves.

307
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,960
Ong Troi Moi freed these soldiers.

308
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,440
He is the reason they are
no longer killing one another.

309
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,840
Yeah, it's a real utopia
he's created for himself.

310
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,200
I brought you here to help spread
Ong Troi Moi's message to the world.

311
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,960
You are only here to document
what you see.

312
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,280
Of course.

313
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,160
I need your shrink-ray.

314
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,280
I dislike that the name
is catching on.

315
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,760
Look, even if you can miniaturize
Grodd,

316
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,160
there's still 10 miles of jungle
warfare between us and the Waverider.

317
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,640
Yeah, which is why you guys

318
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,240
are going to take down
the communications jammer

319
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
and call for backup.

320
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,560
While you take down a
hyper-intelligent telepathic primate

321
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,280
by yourself?

322
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,480
All I need is one clean shot.

323
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,200
You saved my life today.

324
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,400
Didn't want to have to put you
on my list.

325
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,880
These are the names of all the men
that died under my watch.

326
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,000
Keep them with me
to remind myself it's my job

327
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,400
to protect my men,
get them back home.

328
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,080
That's my girl.

329
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,400
Gonna marry her when I get back.

330
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,080
Quit looking at her.

331
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,760
Maybe even start a family someday.

332
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,640
You want kids?

333
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,600
Why not?

334
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,440
As long as they never end up
in some godforsaken jungle.

335
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,600
I've seen things out here...

336
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,200
No, I hope I never bring home
with me.

337
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,400
I've never told anybody this before,
but...

338
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm scared.

339
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,560
I don't know who I am
if I'm not a part of Firestorm.

340
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,080
But you've never had any superpowers

341
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,280
and that's never stopped you

342
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,760
from being the most
kick-ass person I've ever met.

343
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,480
Well, good talk, Captain.

344
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,200
Wow, I knew Grodd
was a power-hungry tyrant, but...

345
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,040
He's one hell
of an electrical engineer.

346
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,080
The key is to jam the jammer without
anyone realizing it's jammed.

347
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,240
Did that make sense?

348
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,560
Perfect.

349
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,640
Where are we taking Grodd

350
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,280
when we return him
to where he belongs?

351
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,360
Well, last I heard
he was in an ARGUS prison.

352
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,880
Wait, he's just another
persecuted meta?

353
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,560
Look, I know
you're not a fan of ARGUS,

354
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,720
but Grodd is a psychopath

355
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,600
and, well, a giant gorilla.

356
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,600
Ray? Jax? Can you hear me?

357
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,360
I think there is something up
with Mick.

358
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,400
He's got that look, you know,
when he's eyes get all crazed.

359
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,240
I think the jungle's finally
getting to...

360
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,520
Hey, man, you good?

361
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
Mick?

362
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,640
What were you doing?

363
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,040
What does it look like?

364
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,920
Looks like you were...

365
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,800
burning your own skin.

366
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,280
But that would be completely insane,
right?

367
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,160
My whole life I saw him as a monster.

368
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,120
Blamed him for all the sick things
that I've done.

369
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,080
But now I see...

370
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,080
I'm worse than him.

371
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,440
Should have been me
that burned in that house.

372
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,920
- You're a genius.
- Thanks.

373
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,320
Sorry, I was talking to myself.

374
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,480
<i>Hello?</i>

375
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,560
Can anybody hear me?

376
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,720
Nate, is that you?

377
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,920
Yes, our comms are down.

378
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,840
No, no, no, no, they were jammed
and I just fixed...

379
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,200
I mean, Zari un-jammed it.

380
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,000
Where are you guys? We need
to get out of this jungle ASAP.

381
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,880
Oh, no. What's wrong, buddy?

382
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,000
Well, when Mick and I started,
we were doing "Predator."

383
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,600
Then, we ran into Mick's dad,

384
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,080
and now we're doing "Apocalypse Now."

385
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,960
That's why Mick didn't want
to come to Vietnam,

386
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,760
on the off chance he'd run
into his father.

387
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,480
Which is about as unlikely as Marty

388
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,920
meeting his great-great-grandfather,
Sir Stein.

389
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,480
Right, or young-you befriending
a time-displaced alien.

390
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,480
Do you people not hear me?

391
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,000
Listen, the monster-slash-Anachronism
is Gorilla Grodd.

392
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,840
We're stuck in his compound.

393
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,200
Did you just say "Gorilla Grodd?"

394
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,640
Grodd's displacement in 1967
probably explains that.

395
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,120
Guys?

396
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,520
Our Anachronism just jumped
from an eight to a level ten.

397
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,720
Gideon, what you got?

398
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,400
<i>The timeline is currently in flux.</i>

399
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,240
<i>However, the following headline
recently appeared in my archives.</i>

400
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,000
It appears that Grodd
is using the powder keg

401
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,840
that is the Vietnam War to
somehow ignite World War III.

402
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,320
- What?
- Where's Amaya?

403
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,000
We have to figure out Grodd's plan
and get out of here.

404
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,080
Yeah.

405
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,920
This is how you repay Grodd
for his hospitality?

406
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,920
By trying to kill me?

407
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,800
Let me help you
with that weapon of yours.

408
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,480
You think I am the enemy.

409
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,800
Look at what you humans
have done to one another.

410
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,000
Look at what humans did to me.

411
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,040
So you're raising an army of humans
to get your revenge?

412
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,920
Revenge?

413
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,320
No.

414
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:39,000
My only wish is to help your kind
find peace.

415
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,320
And how do you plan to do that?

416
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,560
Welcome to Vietnam, Mr. President.

417
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,280
Good lord, it's hotter than
a preacher's knee out here.

418
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,440
You hit the nail on the head,
Mr. President.

419
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,840
Follow me. We'll get you
into some air conditioning.

420
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,760
You're planning
to kill the President?

421
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,000
We're defending our home
against those who have attacked us.

422
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,720
Which I'm all for, believe me,

423
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,480
but you need to draw a line
somewhere.

424
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,200
Grodd is only doing
what is necessary.

425
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,120
Necessary for who?

426
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,840
He only cares about himself.

427
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,120
That's how dictators work.

428
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,560
I have lost both my parents.

429
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,960
My brother, my village.

430
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,760
Ong Troi Moi is the only one left
to protect us.

431
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,640
Hey.

432
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,680
I know what it's like to lose the
people you love in a senseless war.

433
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,360
It makes you desperate, but...

434
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,280
if you really want peace,
it starts with you.

435
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,840
Did you guys hear that?

436
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,680
They're targeting
the President's convoy.

437
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,320
Anh is weak.

438
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,560
Grodd.

439
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,720
- Where are you going?
- You heard Zari.

440
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
To save L.B.J.

441
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,240
It's sounds like the team's
got their hands full.

442
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,040
It's too dangerous.
We'll go together as Firestorm.

443
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,240
No, we won't.
I got to do this on my own.

444
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,320
Please, don't.

445
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,200
I'm still working on a way
to split the thermacore.

446
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,200
Okay, I don't know
if this is your way

447
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,080
of making yourself feel better
about us splitting up

448
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,360
by making sure I've got powers,

449
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,360
but I can do this without any.

450
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,040
And soon enough, I'm gonna have
to stand on my own without you.

451
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,200
We just intercepted
radio communications

452
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,120
and triangulated the enemy's position
to a base just east of here.

453
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,240
That's where they're holed up.

454
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,520
Don't know about you boys,
but I'm ready to go to work.

455
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,600
We can't let them get near that camp,
okay?

456
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,480
These yahoos are gonna shoot
anything that moves.

457
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,080
Our friends are in there.

458
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,280
Amaya's in there.

459
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,720
Do you hear me?

460
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
You fellas ready?

461
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,120
Actually, Sarge, you're gonna have
to tell your men to stand down.

462
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,520
I just received intel that the
encampment is a no-fire zone.

463
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,360
Nobody told me about any intel.

464
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,320
Well, the intel
was on a need-to-know basis

465
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,520
and you didn't need to know 'til now.

466
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,840
Can you explain the situation
to my men?

467
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,800
Yeah, no problem.

468
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,800
Listen up.

469
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,080
I don't take orders from the CIA.

470
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,920
You in or you out, son?

471
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,280
I'm in, pops.

472
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,360
Figure of speech.

473
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,080
What's going on?

474
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,440
Well, Grodd wants to start
World War III.

475
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,000
The sooner your great nations
destroy one another,

476
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,200
the sooner there will be peace.

477
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,960
One nation under Grodd.

478
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,600
Grodd!

479
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,120
The U.S. President will pay
for his atrocities.

480
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,160
Hey, you don't have to do this
to get what you want.

481
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,880
She's right.

482
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,480
We're here to bring you home.

483
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,600
You have every right to be angry.

484
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,680
This world is cruel.

485
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,840
What was done to you by humans...

486
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,480
it's unforgivable.

487
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,160
But you must understand
that we are not here to hurt you.

488
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,520
And how will you bring me back home?

489
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,200
Unless...

490
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,760
you're time-travelers.

491
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,480
I will not go with you.

492
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,080
There is nothing for me
where I am from.

493
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,360
Only pain.

494
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,640
You're right.

495
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,120
- Maybe we don't take you home.
- We don't?

496
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,160
We can take you to a time
before humans.

497
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,800
A time where you can live out
your days in peace.

498
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,840
And why would Grodd trust you?

499
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,440
Because I'm different.

500
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,320
There's been a breach!

501
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,240
All squads defend the perimeter!

502
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,640
You betrayed me.

503
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,800
No, I promise we had nothing
to do with this.

504
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,120
I didn't mean for any of this
to happen.

505
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,280
You have to believe me.

506
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,280
Humans will always fear Grodd,
hunt Grodd,

507
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,640
but with your time machine
at Grodd's command,

508
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,680
there will be no humans.

509
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,360
Grodd will alter the course
of evolution.

510
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,880
He will no longer need
a gorilla country

511
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,680
because Grodd
will have a gorilla planet.

512
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,160
You better tell the Professor
he's gonna have company.

513
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,160
Who's in charge around here?

514
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,280
What in the world?

515
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Get off me.

516
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,720
Call in an air strike.

517
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,280
We'll let Napalm take care
of whatever the heck that was.

518
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,680
We got deserters to deal with.

519
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,160
Raymond, I must have misheard you.

520
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,800
Did you say Grodd
was on his way here?

521
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,160
Sure did, man. He's planning
on stealing the Waverider.

522
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,280
I swear to you, if I die today

523
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,840
because of a telepathic gorilla,

524
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,560
I'm going to be very upset.

525
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,880
Yeah, well,
then get the Waverider moving.

526
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,440
Hands on your head, traitor.

527
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,880
Let's go, move it.

528
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,240
- Amaya.
- Nathaniel.

529
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,320
Shut up.

530
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,400
Are you okay?

531
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,640
Mick?

532
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,960
Mick.

533
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,880
What's wrong with him?

534
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,480
I'm afraid he's gone full Kurtz.

535
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,680
What does that mean?

536
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,000
It's a movie reference.

537
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,480
Great movie, terrible situation.

538
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,800
They say life is the sum total
of all the choices you make.

539
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,160
As your misfortune sinks in,

540
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,000
maybe you want to ask yourself,

541
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,920
what choices did I make
to find myself here?

542
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,720
Today I want payback

543
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,160
for what that monster did to my men,
my brothers.

544
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,480
Excuse... excuse me.

545
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,480
- Shut up.
- We're journalist.

546
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,560
Shut up.

547
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,080
And we've uncovered a plot
to kill President Johnson.

548
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,480
We need to alert
the proper authorities.

549
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,600
Shut up.

550
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,200
- See?
- Hey, he's telling the truth.

551
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,360
The President landed in Vietnam.

552
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,760
But we can still save him.

553
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,160
You're reporters.
What are you gonna do?

554
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,720
Question him to safety?

555
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,320
It's a little more complicated
than that, but...

556
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,440
just trust me, okay?

557
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,320
We're the good guys.

558
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,000
Haven't you hear?

559
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,760
There are no good guys here.

560
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,840
Stop!

561
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,440
Stop, stop, stop!

562
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,640
Hey, wait.

563
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,640
Wait. Wait, wait.

564
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,720
Don't shoot.

565
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
Don't shoot.

566
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,040
I'm an American.

567
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,640
You've got to back the heck up.

568
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,800
Son, we're gonna be on you
like a duck on a June bug

569
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,200
if we don't start moving again.

570
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,880
Mr. President,
your life is in danger.

571
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,160
Okay? That road block is a trap.

572
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,760
You've got to get back to base.

573
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,920
- Step back, sir.
- Wait... no, no, no.

574
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,120
Mr. President, stop!

575
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,920
Mr. President. Don't move!

576
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,640
Don't. Move.

577
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,520
Enough talk.

578
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,240
Time to pay the entrance fee
to this circus.

579
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,240
Don't.

580
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,360
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.

581
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,800
What are you talking about?

582
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,440
I know what's going on
in that head of yours.

583
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,040
But killing these people is not
gonna bring back your men.

584
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,600
What do you know about anything?

585
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,920
Mick, you do realize what
will happen if you kill him?

586
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,240
Don't care.

587
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,320
This is insubordination, son.

588
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,160
I wouldn't have expected
that from you.

589
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,240
Well, you don't know me.

590
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,840
Lower your weapon.

591
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,200
Lower yours.

592
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,440
I got nothing to lose.

593
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,880
But you do.

594
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,360
You get to go home.

595
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,800
But if you kill these people,

596
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,960
you'll hear their screams forever.

597
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,800
And one day...

598
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,160
when you have a family,

599
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,920
you won't be able to look them
in the eye.

600
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,640
Because this day,
this act you're about to commit,

601
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,840
will be burned in your memory
forever.

602
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,520
Why'd you do that?

603
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,120
I always wanted to.

604
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,680
<i>Route is clear. Weapons hot.</i>

605
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,360
Okay.

606
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,760
You guys walked through a mine field

607
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,200
and I'm pretty sure you're caught
in a Soviet trip line.

608
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,000
But by freezing it,
you should be able to step away.

609
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,080
Should?

610
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,400
Okay, on the count of three,
I want you to step away slowly.

611
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,960
One, two, three.

612
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,560
I'll be a damn humdinger.

613
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,480
Sounds like our Viet Cong friends
are circling in.

614
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,400
Okay, well, we better hustle
through this minefield.

615
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,760
Follow my lead
and if I don't blow up, path's clear.

616
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,200
And if you blow up?

617
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,200
Then you're on your own, sir.

618
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,040
Well, that wasn't so hard.

619
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,480
<i>That's because I'm helping.</i>

620
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,160
That your idea of helping?

621
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,200
<i>I'm afraid we have
an unexpected passenger.</i>

622
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,360
You're afraid?

623
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,240
Follow my steps exactly.

624
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,440
I wasn't planning on improvising.

625
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,480
Okay, come on, Mr. President.

626
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,880
One more step. You got this.

627
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,040
Come on.

628
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,920
Where is Captain Lance
when I need her?

629
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,400
Sara...

630
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,640
were you just waiting for the right
moment to make a dramatic entrance?

631
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,640
Are you all right?

632
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,480
There is no Sara.

633
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,040
What?

634
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,600
Only Grodd.

635
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,120
<i>It appears that the Captain is under
some sort of telepathic control.</i>

636
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,480
Really, Gideon? You think so?

637
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,080
I claim this ship for the New God.

638
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,640
Kneel before Gro...

639
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,200
Oh, how I do love proving
my laws of motion.

640
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,720
Please, save that lecture
for another day.

641
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,920
<i>Professor Stein, a U.S. military
air strike is approaching.</i>

642
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,200
<i>And Grodd is still clinging
to the Waverider.</i>

643
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,840
I have an idea.

644
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,320
Hey, are you sure
you won't reconsider?

645
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,440
I can get you out of here.

646
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,760
You can start over somewhere
where there's no war.

647
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,320
No, my struggle is here.

648
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:04,000
I realize now, my people,
they do not need a god.

649
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,880
They need a leader.

650
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,160
Like you said,

651
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,560
peace starts with me.

652
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,520
Got some R and R scheduled
in a few days down in Eagle Beach.

653
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,280
You CIA boys ever get time off,
maybe I'll see you down there.

654
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,440
Anything's possible.

655
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,840
You saved innocent lives.

656
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,520
You saved me.

657
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,440
Pulled me back
from crossing that line.

658
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,600
Well, I've been pulled back from
that line a couple of times myself.

659
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,360
Listen...

660
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,360
if that kid of yours happens
to be a boy...

661
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Yeah?

662
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,480
Nevermind.

663
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,320
Looks like Operation Tough Love
was a success.

664
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,880
Yeah, figured you'd want this back.

665
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,360
I don't need it anymore.

666
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,360
Raymond, are you in there?

667
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,560
Yeah, I'm in here.

668
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,840
Just trying to rebuild
the Molecular Hyper Compressor.

669
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,720
You mean the shrink-ray
that I didn't get to use Grodd?

670
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,480
Yes, it took quite a beating.

671
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,840
What are... what are you doing here?

672
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,000
I came by to say that you were right.

673
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,640
Well, you and Nathaniel,

674
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,520
but I'd rather
you didn't say anything.

675
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,280
No, of course not.

676
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,160
I won't say a word.

677
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,960
About what exactly?

678
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,080
Kuasa.

679
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,280
This experience with Grodd...

680
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,080
he wasn't born a monster.

681
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,240
He was made into one.

682
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,160
And for all I know, the same
is true of my granddaughter.

683
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,440
So, thank you.

684
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,960
Yeah, you're welcome.

685
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,720
Well, I'm relieved you're all right.

686
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,960
Got a little close back there.

687
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,680
By the way, you were right.

688
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,760
I... I was putting myself
under a lot of pressure

689
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,560
to resolve our separation problem.

690
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,400
I just wanted to make sure
I had done everything I could

691
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,960
to keep you safe before I left.

692
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,800
But you're gonna be just fine.

693
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,040
You already carry the most important
part of Firestorm within you.

694
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,640
His spirit.

695
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,680
You getting all soft on me, Grey?

696
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,200
But for real, I'm gonna miss you
when you're gone, man.

697
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,200
Anyway, you said you had something
to show me.

698
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,680
Oh, yeah, so...

699
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,280
after I saved L.B.J.'s life,

700
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,800
I thought I'd get, like,
a medal or something,

701
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,920
but he just tells me
he's got some top secret information.

702
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,960
And hands me this.

703
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,520
Oh, dear God.

704
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,520
This is incredible.

705
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,640
So, instead of a medal for bravery,

706
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,080
President Johnson
gave you a pie recipe.

707
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,960
Well, not just any recipe.

708
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,040
Ladybird Johnson's pecan pie
was legendary.

709
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,680
The ingredients were very closely
kept secret for a long time.

710
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,480
It's almost as good as my mom's pie.

711
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,560
I don't know.

712
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,840
First Lady pie is pretty good.

713
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,040
This is a great gift.

714
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,040
Way better than a medal
'cause you can eat it.

715
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,280
What?

716
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,200
You guys weren't going
to save me any pie?

717
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,400
Aye-oh-what!

718
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,760
Welcome back to the land
of the living, Captain.

719
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,000
Gideon gave me a clean bill
of health.

720
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,240
- Hello, love.
- Hi.

721
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,680
But I don't know
about this bump on my head.

722
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,840
Who's the new guy?

723
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,520
Oh, don't ask.

724
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,560
Well, this was quite an adventure.

725
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,000
Where to next?

726
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,440
Shut up, you bop.

727
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,360
Vietnam.

728
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,160
Crappy war.

729
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,240
Bitching music.

730
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,600
Where is Grodd?

731
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,200
Who are you?

732
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,000
Is that any way
to treat your number one fan?

733
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,320
A nuclear crisis in Central City?

734
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,800
Masterful.

735
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,680
Why else do you think
I'd pull you out of Vietnam

736
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,840
before you fell
into that Napalm inferno?

737
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,600
Send me back.

738
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,160
I know you wanted a time ship,

739
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,920
but who needs a lumbering tin can

740
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,800
when you can time travel
with a single thought?
