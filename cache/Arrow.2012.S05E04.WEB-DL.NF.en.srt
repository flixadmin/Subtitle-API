THE INTENDED TARGET.

HOW THE BRATVA TREAT

I'D HATE TO SEE
HOW THEY TREAT

A SUPERFICIAL SOLUTION.

00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,933
WE'RE JUST GLAD
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

782
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,976
I'VE GOT TO BE
THINKING THIS IS
A PR NIGHTMARE,

783
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,561
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
GOING DOWN

784
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,230
AND THE MAYOR'S MIA.

785
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,649
LOOK. HE CALLED IN
THIS MORNING.

786
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,735
HIS HEALTH PROBLEMS
ARE ALMOST OVER.

787
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,486
THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

788
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,406
UM, WE'RE...WE'RE HEARING
THAT ONE OF THE, UH,
VIGILANTES

789
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:04,824
WHO WAS PART
OF THE RESCUE,

790
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,826
THAT HE DIDN'T
MAKE IT OUT.

791
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,870
UM, ANY WORD
ON HIM?

792
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:11,497
CSU HASN'T FOUND
A BODY, SO...

793
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,126
SO CHURCH HAS HIM.

794
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,002
I SPENT MOST
OF MY LIFE THINKING

795
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,587
THAT MEN IN MASKS
WERE ONLY CAPABLE

796
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:20,506
OF DOING
HORRIBLE THINGS.

797
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,342
I MAY HAVE TO
REEVALUATE THAT.

798
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,970
LET ME KNOW
WHEN QUEEN GETS IN.

799
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,179
WILL DO.

800
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,935
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

801
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,270
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

802
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,771
I MEAN, I BARELY
KNEW THE KID, THEA.

803
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:38,691
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MAKE IT STING
ANY LESS.

804
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,985
WELL, YEAH,
SURE IT DOES.

805
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,279
THE YEAR I'VE HAD,
THIS IS...THIS IS EASY.

806
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,740
YEAH. I MEAN, COLD
AS THAT SOUNDS.

807
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,117
LOOK. I KNOW WHY
YOU'RE ASKING, OK,

808
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:50,536
AND I'M...I'M FINE.

809
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,330
OK.

810
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:55,834
I MEAN, I'M...I'M...
I'M JUST SAYING

811
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:59,879
IF THINGS EVER GET
LESS EASY,

812
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,507
YOU KNOW I'M HERE
FOR YOU, RIGHT?

813
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,801
NOTED...

814
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,428
AND APPRECIATED.

815
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,638
OK.

816
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,144
WHAT IS THE POINT OF HAVING
KEYHOLE SATELLITE IMAGERY

817
00:39:14,186 --> 00:39:16,188
IF YOU CAN'T USE IT
TO FIND ANYBODY?

818
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:17,897
I FEEL LIKE
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

819
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,607
HALF THE SENTENCES
YOU SAY.

820
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,442
WHAT I'M SAYING IS
IS THAT NO MATTER
HOW HARD I TRY

821
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,569
I CANNOT FIND RENE
ANYWHERE.

822
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:29,826
AND I WAS THE ONE
WHO TOLD YOU GUYS
TO LEAVE HIM BEHIND.

823
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,537
SOUNDS LIKE ANOTHER
IMPOSSIBLE DECISION.

824
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:37,876
DOES THAT MEAN I'M
SUPPOSED TO GET BETTER
AT MAKING THEM?

825
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,712
I'M SAYING
YOU WERE RIGHT.

826
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,380
IF WE'RE GONNA
DO THIS,

827
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:45,383
WE CAN'T LET GUILT
SWALLOW US UP.

828
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:46,926
I'LL KEEP YOU
FROM DOING IT

829
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,720
IF YOU PROMISE
THE SAME FOR ME.

830
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,019
DEAL.

831
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:57,520
CURTIS: OW!

832
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:00,732
OW! OW!

833
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,984
EVELYN:
SO "OW" THEN?

834
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,903
THINGS HAVE REALLY
FALLEN APART

835
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,487
WITHOUT OLIVER,
HAVEN'T THEY?

836
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:09,282
IT'S A GOOD THING
I'M BACK THEN.

837
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:12,035
WAS HE WAITING
FOR AN ENTRANCE LINE?

838
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:15,538
NOPE. HE'S JUST
THAT COOL.

839
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,499
I GOT YOUR TEXT.
HAVE WE FOUND RENE?

840
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,543
YOU GET JOHN?

841
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:25,965
YEAH. HE'S FINE.
HE'S HOLED UP
AT HIVE.

842
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,885
I COULDN'T WRITE
HIM OFF,

843
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:32,430
AND WE ARE NOT GONNA
WRITE OFF RENE.

844
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,723
WE'RE GONNA
FIND HIM,

845
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,683
WE'RE GONNA
BRING HIM BACK...

846
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,437
WHEREVER HE IS.

847
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:48,988
CHURCH:
AH. WAKEY, WAKEY.

848
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:52,325
YOW! YOW!
HEH HEH HEH.

849
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,202
HEY.

850
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:56,495
MAN, IT'S BEEN
A LONG TIME

851
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,040
SINCE I'VE BEEN TAGGED
LIKE THIS.

852
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,208
RESPECT.

853
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,542
OH, MY PLEASURE,

854
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,628
BUT I PROMISE YOU
IF YOU UNTIE ME

855
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,838
I'LL SHOW YOU
A HELL OF A LOT MORE
THAN RESPECT.

856
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,049
OOH, MAN,
YOU GOT SPIRIT,

857
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:11,594
AND I AM DULY IMPRESSED,

858
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,222
BUT I'M GONNA BREAK
THAT SPIRIT.

859
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:16,557
I'M GONNA BREAK
YOUR SOUL,

860
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,268
AND WHEN WE'RE FINISHED,

861
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,937
ASSUMING THAT YOU'RE
STILL ALIVE...

862
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:24,274
NOW I WOULDN'T BET
NO MONEY ON THAT, THOUGH...

863
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,609
THERE'S GONNA BE
VERY LITTLE OF YOU LEFT

864
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,653
FOR THE GREEN ARROW
TO WORK WITH.

865
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,990
LIGHT HIM UP.

866
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,243
[SCREAMING]
