228
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,208
I know where the loophole
you've searched for all these years is.

229
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,500
Time.

230
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:44,875
During the apocalypse it stood still
for a fraction of a second at that point

231
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:48,208
and that threw everything out of balance.

232
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,583
But when time stands still,

233
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:55,250
it also momentarily breaks
the chain of cause and effect.

00:20:58,791 --> 00:20:59,833

Eve knows that.

237
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,250
She uses the loophole in your world

238
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:12,666
to send her younger self off
in one direction or another,

239
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,958

242
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:28,791
You must use it
to send Jonas on a different path.

243

You must send them to the origin world,

What are you saying?

There is a way

Time and time again.

362
00:34:06,791 --> 00:34:09,208
Because you can't let go of what you want.

363
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:13,500
And I can't let go of what I want.

364
00:34:15,791 --> 00:34:17,541
But we are the glitch.

365
00:34:21,458 --> 00:34:23,166
The glitch in the matrix.

366
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:33,416
You want them to never exist.

367
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,375
Your world and mine.

368
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,583
That we never exist.

377
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:31,375
every death is just a new beginning.

You cannot win.

My demise

Just as I once found myself.

384
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:08,041
It turns her against you once and for all.

Every time.

394
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:03,208
You will die.

395
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:08,208
I will die.

396
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:12,000
And everything that has grown out of us.

[Adam] Life is a labyrinth.

Death is incomprehensible.

406
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:06,041
But one can reconcile oneself with it.

407
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:12,208
All that we've done...

408
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:16,416

He wanted to travel back to a world
in which his family was still alive.

But instead, his own world was split.

And the knot was created.
