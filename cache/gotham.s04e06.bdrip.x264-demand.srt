But, in the larger scope,
you're right.

Which is why it doesn't stop there.

on Penguin's payroll.

I understand the pressure you face.

642
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,909
Your very survival depends on seeing
everyone as a potential threat.

643
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,114
I watched my father
bear that weight for years.

644
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,839
I don't want you to end up like him.

645
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,034
Sofia, please forgive me.

646
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,995
How can I

647
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,598
when I've already forgiven you?

648
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,595
- Well, you do owe me one thing.
- Anything.

649
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
Lunch.

650
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,238
How do you feel about mac and cheese?

651
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,275
I love it.

652
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,394
(MONITOR BEEPING)

653
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,035
GORDON: Hi.

654
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Hey.

655
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,753
You gave me
quite the scare back there.

656
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,840
How you feeling?

657
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,640
I've had better days.

658
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,916
- Doc says you're gonna be okay.
- Shows what he knows.

659
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,320
The Pyg?

660
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,149
Son of a bitch.

661
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,994
He could have killed me,
but he cut me just deep enough

662
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,597
to make you choose, go after him,
or save my worthless hide.

663
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,829
That wasn't a choice.

664
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,073
Either way, I owe you.

665
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,914
S0 pay it back now.

666
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,194
Tell me the truth.

667
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,271
How long have you been
taking money from Penguin?

668
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,313
You knew Metzger was the bagman.

669
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,719
You knew Nakajima was dirty.

670
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,273
The Pyg says all this stuff
about you deserving to be killed.

671
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,514
I don't know why I didn't see it
before, maybe I didn't want to.

672
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,000
Ijust need to know how long?

673
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,914
Are we talking years?

674
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,356
No, just since
this license crap started.

675
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,959
The commissioner
ordered us to comply.

676
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:40,229
Then Metzger started showing up with
these envelopes stuffed full of cash.

677
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,150
I didn't do nothing
I wouldn't have done anyway.

678
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,352
You gotta understand, Jim.
The bills I got, the debts I got.

679
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,640
It stops.

680
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,035
Stops now.

681
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,636

THE PYG:
"Two mother pigs lived in a pen.

689
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,036
"They each had four piglets

690
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,874
"and that made ten.

"AII the piglets loved to play.
