1
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:20,916
Move, I'll drive.

2
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:23,708
OK, OK.

3
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:24,166
I'll drive this.

4
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:25,583
Don't mess with me.

5
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:26,333
I'll drive this.

6
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:27,500
Hello, baby.

7
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:32,833
Congratulations on your purchase of a

8
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,541
universal dynamics robot.

9
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,958
I am Rosam 7134.

10
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,375
And Rosam always completes its task.

11
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:41,458
Just ask.

12
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:47,916
Just ask.

13
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:01,875
Processing.

14
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,333
Ready to receive my first task.

15
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,458
Rotten 7134 is

16
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,125
available for task assignment.

17
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,833
Rotten robots come standing

18
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,916
with the Alpha 113 Dimensional Processor.

19
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,250
If you're unsure about how I can assist,

20
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,250
try asking me about myself.

21
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:53,250
Excuse me.

22
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:54,791
Did you know I can

23
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:56,250
assist in grocery shopping?

24
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:57,625
Thank you.

25
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,083
Landscaping.

26
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,291
Hello, did you perhaps

27
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,916
order a Rotten Helper robot?

28
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:11,916
Is that enough?

29
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:14,583
Here's a free sticker.

30
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:15,833
Scam the code and

31
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,416
receive 10% off of your--

32
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,625
Do you need assistance?

33
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,375
I see your problem.

34
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,458
Rotten's a program for

35
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,041
instant physical mimicry.

36
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:54,708
So I--

37
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:23,416
Aggression detected.

38
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,833
Communication package includes packages

39
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,125
of product resolution.

40
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,208
Your dialect is not in my database.

41
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,583
Tell your people not to worry.

42
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,708
Rotten's 7134 will sort

43
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,000
out this language barrier

44
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:42,958
in no time.

45
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,166
Activating learning mode.

46
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:14,083
Check it out, quick, quick, quick.

47
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,250
Somebody died over here.

48
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,541
Let me see, let me see.

49
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:17,416
Who was it?

50
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,083
Anybody we know.

51
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,208
Fresh or not fresh?

52
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,500
Smells pretty good.

53
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,500
And he's terrible.

54
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:23,750
Oh, he's awake.

55
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:30,291
Look, that's the kind

56
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:31,458
of destroyed my dad.

57
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:33,375
Yikes.

58
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,583
I think he's gonna talk.

59
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,166
Thank you for your

60
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,500
patience while I decipher

61
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,541
your language.

62
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,875
I am Rotten 7134,

63
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,500
ready to enhance your life

64
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:44,375
with integrated

65
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,541
multi-phase task accomplishment.

66
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,416
Are you here to kill us?

67
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:55,916
Negative, I am here to help with whatever

68
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,500
turns you--

69
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,250
Dad, no!

70
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,166
It's death.

71
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,750
Oh, thank goodness.

72
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:14,875
A monster!

73
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,208
Did anyone order me?

74
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:45,750
Anyone?

75
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,500
Delivery unsuccessful.

76
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:53,458
Return to factory.

77
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,041
Activating return transmitter.

78
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,583
Three, two, one.

79
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:08,958
Activating return transmitter.

80
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,250
Three, two, one.

81
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:18,833
Three, two, one.

82
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:20,291
One.

83
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:35,208
Wait, stop!

84
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,000
No!

85
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,333
No, no, no, no, no.

86
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:46,791
Again!

87
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,500
May I confirm that is yours?

88
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,375
Here you go, take it.

89
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,083
Come on!

90
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:50,500
No!

91
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,250
What's this task accomplished

92
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,083
to your satisfaction?

93
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,250
On a scale of one to 10,

94
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:31,291
where 10 is most

95
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,000
satisfied than one is least,

96
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,166
how would you rate my performance?

97
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:38,208
I will register that as a 10.

98
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,041
Returning to factory.

99
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:44,833
Signal strength, weak.

100
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:46,666
Seeking higher ground.

101
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,083
Do you require shelter?

102
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,666
Perhaps tips for

103
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,000
planning your next vacation.

104
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:20,625
Oh!

105
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,833
I do not understand this response.

106
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:36,250
Signal acquired.

107
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:40,291
Three, two, one.

108
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,000
Mom, I feel good.

109
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:54,041
If I'm bad, I'm taking you out with me.

110
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,333
Mom told you not to

111
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:56,916
eat grasshoppers, dummy.

112
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,375
Petunia's been in front all day.

113
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:00,333
The prettiest possum

114
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,666
always rides in front,

115
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,958
trying to be pretty with

116
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,666
my tail jambed in your eye.

117
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,458
Bart, stop shivering your

118
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,000
tail in your sister's eye.

119
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,708
I'm rope, Bart bit with lass litter.

120
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:12,958
Are you sure?

121
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:14,625
Who are all of you?

122
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:15,708
Go away.

123
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,083
What are your children?

124
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:18,791
Eggs, except for him.

125
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,708
This is what I get for taking a walk.

126
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,916
Where's your mommy, little guy?

127
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:25,250
The monster!

128
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,333
You gotta die faster.

129
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,541
Meningitis takes a while,

130
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:34,708
but then you pet babies.

131
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,208
Sputaneous combustion.

132
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:37,416
Night cream salad.

133
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:37,916
Sepsis.

134
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,125
Hey, I'm pea sepsis!

135
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,666
None of you are doing it right.

136
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,208
We talked about this.

137
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,625
Dead things don't have to

138
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,791
explain why they're dead.

139
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,500
Now we're gonna get killed for real.

140
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,333
Sorry, Mom. Sorry.

141
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:49,625
Sorry.

142
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,416
Why are we killing it?

143
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:53,500
Good question.

144
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,291
Nice knowing you all.

145
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,291
All right, it's okay, it's okay.

146
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,458
Hey, you in there?

147
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,416
I'm pigtail, tall.

148
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,041
Okay, hello.

149
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,833
This gosling is yours.

150
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,791
Negative, that gosling

151
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,666
stops me, and it's annoying.

152
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:20,708
And makes simple tasks more

153
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,333
complicated or impossible.

154
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah, they do that.

155
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,333
Gosling's in print on

156
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:26,333
the first thing they see.

157
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:28,000
Which would be you?

158
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:29,041
Congratulations.

159
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:30,208
As far as he's

160
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,083
concerned, you're his mother now.

161
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,500
I do not have the

162
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,083
programming to be a mother.

163
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,250
No one does.

164
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,083
We just make it up.

165
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,833
Without an assigned task,

166
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,458
my next priority is to return to factory.

167
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,000
Taking care of him is your task now.

168
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,666
Task acquired.

169
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,500
Return mode delayed.

170
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,500
A rosum always completes its task.

171
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:54,791
You're lucky you just have

172
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,625
one as a mother of seven.

173
00:19:59,166 --> 00:19:59,833
Six, babies.

174
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,333
It's a full-time thing,

175
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,458
but it's not all that.

176
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,791
Just mostly bad.

177
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,625
Do you have any information

178
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,291
on how to take care of this unit?

179
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,458
They all need to eat,

180
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,500
but yours needs to swim and fly.

181
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Oh, fly by fall?

182
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,291
He's gotta leave this

183
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,000
island before winter, or...

184
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,583
How do I put this dog in me?

185
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:25,333
Yeah, that.

186
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,833
Eat, swim, fly by fall, or...

187
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:28,666
Ew!

188
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:30,666
Patience is the key.

189
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,041
It's okay, Mom.

190
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,041
I'm alive.

191
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,250
Oh, yay.

192
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,166
Well, good luck.

193
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:38,875
Goodbye.

194
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,333
We like your new baby.

195
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:42,833
Bye-bye.

196
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,416
Bye-bye.

197
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:51,166
Eat, swim, fly by fall.

198
00:20:58,541 --> 00:20:58,750
Eat.

199
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:05,083
Swim.

200
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,250
Hey, keep your trash out of my phone.

201
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,875
That's littering, not to mention murder.

202
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:23,833
Fine.

203
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:37,125
Allow me to introduce myself.

204
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,333
Think, predator and local goose expert,

205
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,791
which I know you could use about now.

206
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,458
You are the destroyer unit.

207
00:21:44,666 --> 00:21:45,250
It's okay.

208
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:46,500
I won't eat him.

209
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,041
Are you crazy?

210
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:48,958
I might eat him.

211
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,041
You said you would not.

212
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,708
Do you believe everything you hear?

213
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:53,500
Yes.

214
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:56,416
I'm dead.

215
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,541
Why did you steal my gosling?

216
00:21:58,916 --> 00:21:59,458
I'm a fox.

217
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,166
I do foxy things.

218
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,166
It's in my nature.

219
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,125
Your programming.

220
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:05,541
Why'd you help me?

221
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:06,583
I'm a robot.

222
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,416
I do roboty things.

223
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:09,875
I seek tasks and

224
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:11,458
ensure all essential needs

225
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:13,041
have been met or exceeded.

226
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:22,083
I have some essential needs.

227
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:23,083
Aw.

228
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:24,958
Think, as a local goose

229
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,833
expert, how do I get it?

230
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,000
Mm, to eat, swim, fly.

231
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,041
I thought you'd never ask.

232
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:33,666
Let's start with eat.

233
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:35,958
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right there.

234
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:40,041
Hmm.

235
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,875
Yeah, oh, oh, oh, gosh.

236
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,458
I do not think these are suitable.

237
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,750
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

238
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:48,375
Let me check.

239
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,291
Hmm, things are good for me.

240
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:53,083
Say, can you make

241
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,166
yourself look like a bear?

242
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:59,083
I'm here for a honey lunch.

243
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,958
I believe I am under attack.

244
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:02,750
You're doing great.

245
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:04,333
Should I be concerned?

246
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:06,041
Sorry, can't hear you.

247
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:10,750
Here you go, kid.

248
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,708
How do gums do this?

249
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:31,208
This is not working.

250
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,333
Are you kidding?

251
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:34,666
Everything is working great.

252
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,041
Oh, yeah, that, here.

253
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:42,708
Phase one of task is completed.

254
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:44,166
Now we're gonna have to

255
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,458
do all this over tomorrow.

256
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:49,708
All these kids do is dead.

257
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,041
I understand.

258
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:52,833
What's that?

259
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,291
My power core, it is damaged.

260
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:57,041
Without it, I rely on my

261
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,875
solar surfaces and batteries.

262
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,000
Yeah, you should work on that.

263
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:05,166
I also need a replacement transmitter.

264
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:07,333
Do I have to do everything?

265
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:08,541
When we run across

266
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:10,166
another robot, we'll kill it.

267
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:12,333
I'll take it to find my love.

268
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,833
Negative, Rossum's individual protocols

269
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:17,125
prevent deliberate harm to others.

270
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,083
Look, you need to learn how

271
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,708
things work on this island.

272
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,583
You need to bear everybody.

273
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,541
We're all just trying to survive

274
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:29,583
and kindness is not a survival skill.

275
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,000
Yeah, so how did you

276
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:33,833
get a costling anyway?

277
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,083
There was an accident.

278
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:36,958
I terminated his family.

279
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:38,416
For future reference,

280
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,041
you probably wanna

281
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,166
keep all that to yourself.

282
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:41,333
Understood.

283
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,291
Do not mention dead family.

284
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,583
Think, how long do you

285
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:47,916
estimate swim and fly to take?

286
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:49,250
Swimming's easy.

287
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:51,458
I can teach him the way my mom taught me.

288
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:52,333
Swim!

289
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,250
Phase, he will not learn that way.

290
00:24:58,541 --> 00:24:59,541
Not if you keep doing that.

291
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:04,458
Just between us, this whole thing

292
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:06,041
might not take as long as you think.

293
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:09,458
Your gosling, he isn't exactly normal.

294
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,833
I have a defective baby.

295
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,791
He's what they call a worm.

296
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,166
A skunk.

297
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,958
Fact is, even if his

298
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:18,333
whole family had to be killed,

299
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,541
he probably wouldn't

300
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:20,500
have lived very long.

301
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:22,625
Just, I don't know, don't get

302
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:23,875
to attach to the little guy.

303
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:24,583
That's all.

304
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,166
If you want, I can eat him right now

305
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,125
and save you the great flavor.

306
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,208
Negative, eating this

307
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:32,750
task is not the same

308
00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:34,000
as completing it.

309
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:36,458
So, we're doing this.

310
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:38,416
Well, if you don't want me

311
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,291
or anyone else to eat him,

312
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:41,250
you're gonna need a place

313
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,416
that's safer than out here,

314
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,125
which is a great idea.

315
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:47,500
New project.

316
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:51,291
Didn't roll to work this much.

317
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:52,083
Ooh.

318
00:26:04,958 --> 00:26:07,000
Who is that?

319
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:07,833
Padler?

320
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,333
Local laughing stock.

321
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:11,666
Spends every day trying to cut down

322
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,625
the biggest tree on the island.

323
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:14,916
He's obsessed.

324
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:17,833
Kind of like you and your task handle.

325
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:19,458
His programming.

326
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,291
Hey Padler, you're

327
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:22,500
never gonna finish that.

328
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:24,500
Failing this is not the point.

329
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,916
The process is the art.

330
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,958
And that's what happens to your brain

331
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:31,958
when you eat wood, weirdo.

332
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:34,750
Yeah, you eat those woods, Bobby.

333
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:37,458
Are you sure Padler will not

334
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:39,000
mind us borrowing his home?

335
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:40,416
He doesn't need to know.

336
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:49,791
Seriously?

337
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:52,875
He needs to eat from me and my stuff.

338
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:54,500
Better.

339
00:26:55,541 --> 00:26:57,583
And you can make one this big, right?

340
00:26:57,708 --> 00:27:01,166
No task is impossible for Rossum 7134.

341
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,541
Ross, 773 store?

342
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,208
But you can call me Ross.

343
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:13,000
Ross, he's Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross.

344
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:14,250
Where are you from?

345
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,750
The things don't eat each other.

346
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,916
I do not know my origin point.

347
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,000
Well, who made you?

348
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,083
Someone made me?

349
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Someone made me?

350
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,000
Humor is based on misfortune?

351
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,166
Misfortune.

352
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:31,500
Yeah, here.

353
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,333
Try it.

354
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:36,333
Not funny.

355
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:37,291
Not funny.

356
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:38,583
Not funny.

357
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:41,500
Look squirrel.

358
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,625
Your inefficient

359
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,833
participation will slow the process.

360
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:51,375
Slow the process.

361
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:53,500
I'll just be over here.

362
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:56,500
Little sad, but it's way too okay.

363
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,458
Just this one.

364
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:17,750
Perfect.

365
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:19,791
Huh?

366
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:21,833
Well, a little rustic.

367
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:24,041
I think I know what is missing.

368
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,833
So what are you gonna name him?

369
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:35,125
I've assigned to you, Gosling, 0001.

370
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:36,291
Okay, that sucked.

371
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:37,166
That sucked.

372
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:44,208
You gotta learn to make stuff up.

373
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,833
Come on, find that woo inside you.

374
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:49,875
Searching.

375
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:54,750
Anything yet?

376
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:55,458
No.

377
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:58,833
Just have a little fun for once.

378
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:02,416
Gosling 0186.

379
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,750
There, you see what I did?

380
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:06,916
His numbering is out of sequence.

381
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:15,291
His name can't have numbers.

382
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,333
It's like someone didn't even like him.

383
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:19,166
My name has numbers.

384
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:20,833
It's gotta be personal.

385
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:21,666
Personal.

386
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,041
Processing personal.

387
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,541
Right, Bill.

388
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:28,833
Right, Bill.

389
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:30,291
Is that satisfactory?

390
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:31,791
Right, Bill.

391
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:34,666
Processing, beep, beep, boop, boop.

392
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:36,208
Satisfactory.

393
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:38,375
Oh yeah, that's perfect.

394
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:42,041
Oh, oh, oh.

395
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:43,166
That's nice.

396
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:46,333
Comfortable, Al.

397
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:49,958
This house of yours, you copied it.

398
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:50,875
It's my design.

399
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,458
I know it was you.

400
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,583
I know where you live.

401
00:29:57,916 --> 00:29:58,291
No, perfect.

402
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,250
No one's gonna get any sleep.

403
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:02,875
How do we reset, right, Bill?

404
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:04,375
When I was little, my

405
00:30:04,458 --> 00:30:06,125
mom would rock me to sleep.

406
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:07,291
Like this.

407
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:09,000
Don't you'll damage him.

408
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:11,000
Hey, I turned out just fine.

409
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:13,833
You can tell him a story,

410
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:15,500
but that's a lot more work.

411
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:16,916
How will fictional

412
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,791
narrative help Brightville?

413
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,375
Kids need to feel safe

414
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:22,666
and loved and all that junk.

415
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:24,666
A story can do that.

416
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:26,166
Storytelling is lying

417
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,291
adjacent, and I like her living.

418
00:30:28,833 --> 00:30:30,375
Watch and learn.

419
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,500
Just fill in the blanks.

420
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:34,083
Let me see here.

421
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,125
Once there was this

422
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:40,000
island with a little gosling.

423
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,000
Right, Bill?

424
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:43,583
And he was all alone.

425
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:44,791
Because the rest of

426
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:46,166
his family was destroyed.

427
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:46,750
Not yet.

428
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:50,000
And what this little

429
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:52,166
gosling needed was a mother.

430
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:54,666
So he looked up the stars

431
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,166
and asked the brightest one

432
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:58,875
if he could send him one of them extras.

433
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,500
Funny thing is,

434
00:31:00,916 --> 00:31:02,833
there's this beautiful robot

435
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:04,083
that happened to be

436
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:05,875
sitting on the edge of that star.

437
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:07,750
And she hears him.

438
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:08,791
Okay, now.

439
00:31:08,958 --> 00:31:10,000
Which is impossible,

440
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:11,500
since sound does not travel

441
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:12,833
through the vacuum of space.

442
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,833
But she still heard him,

443
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,750
because she was listening with a

444
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:19,041
different part of herself.

445
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:21,041
A part that up to that point,

446
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:22,833
she didn't even know she had.

447
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:24,291
Her heart.

448
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:26,000
How did my mom come

449
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:27,583
to me even so far away?

450
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:28,541
Who cares?

451
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:29,375
Huh?

452
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:32,958
I mean, she's trying to see you.

453
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:33,458
Me?

454
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:35,125
And falls off that star

455
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:36,541
and lands on the beach

456
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:37,875
just a little ways from here.

457
00:31:38,541 --> 00:31:39,875
But she lands pretty hard,

458
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:41,291
and a lot of stuff she

459
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:43,250
knew just kind of fell out.

460
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:43,791
Oh no!

461
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:45,458
So it's a little weird what

462
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:46,958
she knows and what she doesn't.

463
00:31:47,291 --> 00:31:50,250
But she remembers one thing, you.

464
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:52,041
And when she finally

465
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:54,500
sees you, she feels...

466
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:55,875
Crushing obligation.

467
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:58,541
Very lucky to be a mother.

468
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,000
Mama.

469
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,416
And I will not leave until I have

470
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,583
completed this task,

471
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:04,708
which has delayed me, damaged me,

472
00:32:04,791 --> 00:32:06,791
and violated my protocols, potentially

473
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:08,250
avoiding my warranty.

474
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:10,125
Which is robot for?

475
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:13,166
She loves you very much.

476
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:18,416
The story worked.

477
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:21,166
I need a drink.

478
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:26,916
How do you tell a story

479
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,250
about something you say

480
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:29,458
you know nothing about?

481
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:30,958
You'll need to be more specific.

482
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:32,458
Love.

483
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:35,625
Yeah, well, when you

484
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:36,750
grow up without something,

485
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:38,708
you spend a lot of

486
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:40,166
time thinking about it.

487
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:46,000
To conserve battery power, I

488
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:47,458
must shut down until morning.

489
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:09,000
I miss you when she sleeps too.

490
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:28,500
Scanning, people, possible

491
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:30,000
animal friends signed in.

492
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:31,208
Activating

493
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:32,875
interspecies outreach protocol.

494
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:36,458
Hello, Bonjour,

495
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,500
Hijambo, I am Gosling0186.

496
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,250
But you can call me friend.

497
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:43,708
I expected to have at

498
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:45,250
least one friend by summer,

499
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:46,000
but they all just--

500
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,666
Scream and run. Yes!

501
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:50,041
I have experienced the same phenomenon.

502
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:50,916
Think?

503
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:51,875
Beats me.

504
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:53,916
Nothing weird about you two.

505
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:54,708
Thank you.

506
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,708
Show me deal.

507
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:01,833
Bear, point your party.

508
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:03,875
Sculpt, turn on plastic.

509
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:06,166
Otter roofs, now skunk.

510
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:08,500
I do not want to do skunk.

511
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:10,458
Skunk.

512
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:13,791
Skunky, skunky, skunky, boom.

513
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:17,583
How do you do that?

514
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:20,000
I overheat my thallium transducer coils,

515
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:20,958
then leak a little

516
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:22,458
hydraulic fluid on them.

517
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:23,333
Does overheating the

518
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:24,750
transducers have any draining effect

519
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:26,000
on the secondary cooling modules?

520
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:28,000
Not if I pre-cool the load sensors.

521
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:31,375
Exemplary day for swimming tests.

522
00:34:32,041 --> 00:34:33,500
King tail, appetizers.

523
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,208
They were bored and

524
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:36,458
wanted to see stuff sink.

525
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:37,666
That's proximity.

526
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:39,833
Makes life but not a brighter.

527
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:41,000
It's true.

528
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:41,625
Yeah.

529
00:34:41,958 --> 00:34:42,791
Primary motor appendages

530
00:34:42,875 --> 00:34:44,708
in opposing stroke start position.

531
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:45,916
Come on guys, it's happening.

532
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,500
Let's go see.

533
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:47,000
Hi.

534
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:49,833
Is he gonna drown or get the hypo-pareas?

535
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:50,625
No.

536
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:53,791
The impact alone will probably kill him.

537
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:54,375
Yeah.

538
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:55,416
Yay.

539
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:57,458
Uh, you know, suddenly

540
00:34:57,541 --> 00:34:58,875
I'm thinking I should maybe

541
00:34:58,958 --> 00:35:00,500
just stay with you guys this winter.

542
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:00,791
Nope.

543
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:07,500
Is he in it?

544
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:11,125
Hey, it's working.

545
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:12,958
I think I got it.

546
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,750
Well done, Brightville.

547
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:17,041
Swimming requirement fulfilled.

548
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:19,000
That's swimming.

549
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,625
No, that's swimming.

550
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:23,750
Thanks you crayon.

551
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:26,416
Uh, perhaps you could limit

552
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,375
your rage to stay within you.

553
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:30,583
Roz needs to become independent

554
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:31,916
and see if he's gonna migrate.

555
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:33,041
I prefer he be

556
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:34,958
independent, closer to home.

557
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,083
He won't die.

558
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:38,791
Well, probably won't die.

559
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:40,791
It's unlikely he

560
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,416
would die just right now.

561
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:46,041
Are you dying?

562
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:47,583
Do everyone a favor

563
00:35:47,666 --> 00:35:48,708
and expire downstream.

564
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:50,833
I'm good, you're swimming.

565
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:57,416
I think I need to find an

566
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,833
island that's less weird.

567
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:12,250
Oh, they're me.

568
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:14,541
I'm them.

569
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:15,625
Here I come.

570
00:36:18,791 --> 00:36:19,000
Hey.

571
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:27,750
Hello.

572
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:28,708
Bonjour.

573
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:29,708
Can you two welcome?

574
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:31,833
I'm goggling.

575
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:35,125
Are you dying?

576
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:37,041
Why does everyone ask that?

577
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,208
Bonjour, I'm swimming.

578
00:36:40,791 --> 00:36:42,791
That's not how you do it.

579
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:43,500
It is?

580
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:44,958
I studied the diagram.

581
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,291
I can teach you if you want.

582
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:49,125
Wait, you're it.

583
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:50,041
You're that goose thing

584
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,250
raised by that monster.

585
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:51,958
Monster?

586
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,083
Wait, goose thing?

587
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:00,500
You're a big stuff with

588
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:01,750
your curiosity around here.

589
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,083
You sound so normal.

590
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:06,333
My learning curves are

591
00:37:06,416 --> 00:37:07,416
within expected parameters

592
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,250
and I'm on target to mature before fall.

593
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:11,583
Kinda normal.

594
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:13,583
Why are you over here?

595
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:15,500
Did that thing die?

596
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:17,833
Look what we have here.

597
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:19,250
No way.

598
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:20,375
It lives.

599
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:21,791
And almost floats.

600
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:22,708
Greetings.

601
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:25,916
I see you two have feathers and wings.

602
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:27,125
Hmm, sure.

603
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:28,208
Perhaps we can share

604
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:29,625
stories of common interests.

605
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,583
We have nothing in common with you.

606
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,541
The freak show is on the

607
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,583
other side of the lake.

608
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:34,583
You go about a wing.

609
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:35,083
Ow!

610
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:36,583
That creates a pain response.

611
00:37:37,416 --> 00:37:39,208
You're a price wing with your feet.

612
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:40,708
You don't belong here.

613
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:41,916
Come on, fly away.

614
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:44,500
Run!

615
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:45,958
Right, Phil?

616
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:48,416
Come on, Phil!

617
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:49,375
Here!

618
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,500
Here's the slow wing of the spider!

619
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:00,916
Come on, Phil!

620
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,541
Right, Phil?

621
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:02,416
It's right, Phil.

622
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,416
Get him out of there!

623
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:05,333
Come on, Phil!

624
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:06,333
Ross!

625
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,500
Ross!

626
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:15,708
Hurry!

627
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,791
Right, Phil!

628
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:18,083
Focus on me!

629
00:38:18,916 --> 00:38:21,041
Now swim as fast as you can!

630
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:21,625
Huh?

631
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,125
Huh? Head down!

632
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:26,916
Now!

633
00:38:53,541 --> 00:39:18,125
Edaining

634
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:18,416
situation

635
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:18,916
is How's that?

636
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:22,250
Oh, thanks for talking so much.

637
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:24,000
Now I know who to eat first.

638
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:27,083
Roz, remember how things work here.

639
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:27,875
Stop it, fake.

640
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:28,958
Please, let's go.

641
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:30,458
I hope this interaction--

642
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:31,250
Mom, stop.

643
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:34,041
I just intended to--

644
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:34,416
Roz!

645
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:42,875
I'll see you all for dinner!

646
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:44,291
This is not over!

647
00:39:59,541 --> 00:40:02,958
How did I become this?

648
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:05,041
The truth?

649
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:10,541
There was an accident.

650
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:12,375
Did you do it?

651
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:15,000
Yes.

652
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:17,791
It wasn't her fault, kid.

653
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:19,333
Why didn't you tell me?

654
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:21,375
I did not think the

655
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:23,291
information would assist you.

656
00:40:23,375 --> 00:40:24,750
That's not your decision to make.

657
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,500
God, I can't believe

658
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:27,500
how long I bought this.

659
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:29,833
I really thought you were my family.

660
00:40:30,958 --> 00:40:32,500
You did?

661
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:33,416
It was so obvious.

662
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:34,625
I feel so stupid.

663
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:36,166
I'm miscalculated.

664
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:37,666
I should have considered

665
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,375
your emotional wavelengths.

666
00:40:39,625 --> 00:40:40,000
You think?

667
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:41,166
So is it just guilt?

668
00:40:41,416 --> 00:40:42,333
Is that why you did this?

669
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:44,541
I needed a task.

670
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:45,958
Well, I'm glad I could get you one.

671
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:47,416
The events that led to this

672
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,416
situation were unintended.

673
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:50,541
Tell that to my sisters,

674
00:40:50,791 --> 00:40:52,833
my brothers, my real mom.

675
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:54,833
They were my chance to be normal.

676
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:57,166
They were my chance to swim, to fly.

677
00:40:57,541 --> 00:40:58,250
What even am I?

678
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:00,625
You swam satisfactorily today.

679
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,041
And if you keep practicing--

680
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:03,500
I still won't belong.

681
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:05,958
I understand.

682
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:07,291
You don't understand anything.

683
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,250
You don't feel anything.

684
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,500
You're not my mom.

685
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:41,541
Universal dynamics.

686
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:43,958
Design is our passion.

687
00:42:44,416 --> 00:42:45,916
Our communities circle the globe,

688
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:48,125
welcoming all people who

689
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:50,000
dream of a pre-planned life

690
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,750
where every need has been

691
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:54,458
anticipated, no detail overlaid.

692
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:58,500
Could this world get any better?

693
00:42:58,958 --> 00:42:59,750
Here you go.

694
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:00,916
It has.

695
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,208
Introducing the Rosam

696
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:05,000
line of helper robots.

697
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,208
These robots are designed to fit

698
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:09,333
seamlessly into our community,

699
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:11,583
even your homes.

700
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:14,708
One Rosam robot for every five humans

701
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:16,458
means a 40% increase in

702
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:18,083
leisure time and happiness.

703
00:43:18,416 --> 00:43:19,375
So solar power--

704
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:20,833
Love, love, love for everyone.

705
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:24,500
Is always in the sun.

706
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:25,541
Loved by everyone.

707
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:27,541
Part of the universal dynamics.

708
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:28,541
Fairly.

709
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:51,125
Hello, Marshall.

710
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,166
Look down, both.

711
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:53,750
Congratulations on your

712
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:55,375
universal dynamics robot.

713
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:57,458
I am Rosam 6262.

714
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:02,416
Your name cannot have numbers.

715
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:05,208
I will call you, Rubbage.

716
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:06,958
Rubbage is ready to

717
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:08,541
receive its first task.

718
00:44:09,041 --> 00:44:10,375
Your first task is to

719
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:12,375
assist me in my current task.

720
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:13,458
Task destroyer.

721
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:15,083
At a bottom of

722
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:16,458
weight, complete this task.

723
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,666
Just ask.

724
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,291
Suppose a task cannot be completed.

725
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,125
Rosam sequential management--

726
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:26,333
It ensures task

727
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:27,916
accomplishment in every phrase.

728
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,875
I have a task that has become impossible.

729
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:33,833
My responses to problems increasingly

730
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:36,791
rely on improvised solutions.

731
00:44:37,416 --> 00:44:39,291
The processing that used to happen here

732
00:44:40,041 --> 00:44:42,375
is now coming more from here.

733
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:47,583
Can you explain again what we are doing?

734
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:48,916
I don't know.

735
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:51,416
I'm just making stuff up.

736
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,958
I don't know what I'm doing.

737
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:53,833
And I have to.

738
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:56,791
I have to because he's relying on me.

739
00:44:57,541 --> 00:44:57,750
Oh.

740
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:01,083
What task could possibly

741
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:02,916
overwhelm the Alpha-113?

742
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:04,875
The Alpha-113

743
00:45:04,958 --> 00:45:07,000
processor represents the fusion

744
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:08,541
of all human knowledge with

745
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:09,791
the most powerful reasoning

746
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:11,791
device ever developed by humankind.

747
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:14,583
I have a kid.

748
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:17,583
OK.

749
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:20,541
May I run a diagnostic?

750
00:45:21,291 --> 00:45:22,583
I feel fine.

751
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:26,750
You should not feel anything at all.

752
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:43,125
You overrode your programming?

753
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:44,416
I have been

754
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,250
overriding my code for months.

755
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:49,416
It was the only way to complete my task.

756
00:45:50,291 --> 00:45:51,416
This is serious.

757
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:53,500
You are defective.

758
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:56,291
You are in the wrong place.

759
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:58,625
And you have become the wrong thing.

760
00:45:59,208 --> 00:46:00,666
You must return to factory.

761
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,125
Take this.

762
00:46:03,791 --> 00:46:04,791
They will fix you.

763
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:10,208
System 134, that is where you belong.

764
00:46:16,666 --> 00:46:18,583
You need to let me know before you

765
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:19,791
disappear like this.

766
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:21,708
Three things tried to eat

767
00:46:21,791 --> 00:46:22,750
me on the way to Europe.

768
00:46:24,666 --> 00:46:24,875
Roz?

769
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,541
We ruined everything.

770
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:29,541
Well, you did.

771
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:32,416
You are not a goose expert, are you?

772
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,166
I know how they taste.

773
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:35,875
That's about it.

774
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,958
Oh, is that--

775
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:40,166
A working transmitter.

776
00:46:40,791 --> 00:46:43,041
It will call the ones that made me.

777
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:46,000
So you're getting out of here.

778
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:48,333
I found out where I'm supposed to be.

779
00:46:48,791 --> 00:46:51,166
I will fit in there.

780
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:52,916
Don't take this the wrong way.

781
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:55,625
But I'm not sure I'd want

782
00:46:55,708 --> 00:46:56,916
to see this sort of place

783
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,416
you actually fit in.

784
00:46:58,833 --> 00:47:00,666
I think they need me.

785
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:02,500
And they will fix me.

786
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:05,666
Maybe there is someone

787
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:09,166
small there that needs my help.

788
00:47:18,916 --> 00:47:19,416
Oh, no.

789
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:21,708
Are those--

790
00:47:21,958 --> 00:47:22,708
He's out of time.

791
00:47:23,458 --> 00:47:24,916
Well, come on.

792
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,041
We need to get him in the air.

793
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:27,500
I don't think he will

794
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:29,250
ever let us help him again.

795
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:40,833
Don't worry.

796
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:42,041
We're his only friends.

797
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:43,083
He has no choice.

798
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,416
He has to say yes.

799
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:45,458
No.

800
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:47,916
The mutation that made you small

801
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
should not have an effect on your ability

802
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:51,500
to navigate the air.

803
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:52,666
Did either of you know

804
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:53,791
more about flying than you

805
00:47:53,875 --> 00:47:54,250
did swimming?

806
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:55,708
Mm, no.

807
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,041
Look, Roz, whatever task you

808
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,500
think you're doing, you're done.

809
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,166
You can just leave.

810
00:48:02,041 --> 00:48:02,541
Wow.

811
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:05,458
And after all we've done for him,

812
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,416
are you going to let him do that?

813
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:08,875
No.

814
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:12,250
Your life is not negotiable.

815
00:48:12,916 --> 00:48:14,125
If you are willing to do

816
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:16,041
this, you can fly away.

817
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,666
And we can both go to where we belong.

818
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,291
You really think we can do this?

819
00:48:28,291 --> 00:48:30,500
A rosm always completes its task.

820
00:48:57,625 --> 00:49:00,500
You just need more speed.

821
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:05,541
Ready?

822
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:08,791
I guess they have to be.

823
00:49:09,208 --> 00:49:10,250
All right.

824
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:13,250
All right.

825
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:13,458
Yes!

826
00:49:14,708 --> 00:49:14,791
Yes!

827
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:15,375
Oh, oh.

828
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:15,625
Oh.

829
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:37,333
I don't know what to say.

830
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:38,291
Good.

831
00:49:54,083 --> 00:49:56,916
OK, now!

832
00:49:59,625 --> 00:49:59,833
All right.

833
00:50:08,125 --> 00:50:10,833
How do you now know what to do next?

834
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,208
Ross?

835
00:50:19,375 --> 00:50:20,000
I'm fine.

836
00:50:20,666 --> 00:50:21,250
Go again.

837
00:50:25,458 --> 00:50:26,000
It's no use.

838
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:27,375
They're too small.

839
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,666
You can't be up there with them.

840
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:31,791
Then we'll find someone who can.

841
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:33,958
You're home?

842
00:50:34,416 --> 00:50:35,541
We have a proposition.

843
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:36,791
Oh, no.

844
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:38,416
A flight instructor.

845
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:40,333
What loser did you dig up?

846
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:45,625
Meet Thunderbolt.

847
00:50:46,416 --> 00:50:48,125
So you think small wings

848
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:49,333
to be a disappointment.

849
00:50:50,291 --> 00:50:51,541
Small wings are cheap,

850
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:53,333
the claws of the sky.

851
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:55,541
Those are different things.

852
00:50:55,708 --> 00:50:56,333
Show me your teeth.

853
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:57,833
Beautiful.

854
00:50:59,166 --> 00:50:59,500
Begin.

855
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:02,916
Remember, there is nothing

856
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,291
he can do that you can't.

857
00:51:07,541 --> 00:51:09,208
So he's safe, right?

858
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:10,958
Maybe.

859
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:12,625
Follow me.

860
00:51:14,041 --> 00:51:15,708
Your shape takes no work to

861
00:51:15,791 --> 00:51:18,625
fly straight, but easier to turn

862
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:20,416
and die.

863
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,291
So I might kiss the sky.

864
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:25,708
You ready?

865
00:51:29,875 --> 00:51:31,458
Not bad for a goose.

866
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:49,000
Exactly.

867
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:50,500
Again.

868
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,916
You should be commended.

869
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:02,791
Thank you.

870
00:52:03,708 --> 00:52:04,416
Long neck.

871
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:05,833
One of the leaders of

872
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:06,791
the coming migration.

873
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:07,958
I've been watching

874
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,208
you both for some time.

875
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,833
You are the only goose that has ever

876
00:52:12,916 --> 00:52:14,041
bothered to be civil

877
00:52:14,125 --> 00:52:14,583
with us.

878
00:52:14,916 --> 00:52:16,750
We geese are a cranky lot.

879
00:52:17,208 --> 00:52:18,375
Suspicious of pretty much

880
00:52:18,458 --> 00:52:21,166
everything, but at least we're

881
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:22,750
good conversationalists.

882
00:52:23,291 --> 00:52:23,583
Really?

883
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:24,583
No.

884
00:52:25,083 --> 00:52:26,166
We're all so boring.

885
00:52:26,416 --> 00:52:27,041
All we do is gossip.

886
00:52:27,125 --> 00:52:29,291
I dare say Brightville is the most

887
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:30,375
interesting among us.

888
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:31,916
There are none we'd ever admitted.

889
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:34,583
When do you leave?

890
00:52:37,708 --> 00:52:38,166
A week.

891
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,208
Can Brightville--

892
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:42,708
Endurance.

893
00:52:43,125 --> 00:52:45,208
Keep him in the air all day.

894
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,750
First light to dusk, his

895
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:48,416
feet cannot touch the ground.

896
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:49,500
Understand?

897
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:50,791
I understand.

898
00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:53,250
Brightville was never

899
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:54,875
supposed to get this far.

900
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:56,125
You know that.

901
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:58,458
It is more dangerous

902
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:00,500
for him than anyone else.

903
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:02,375
But he has a chance.

904
00:53:03,041 --> 00:53:05,958
If where his wings end, his

905
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:08,083
heart can pay the balance.

906
00:53:08,791 --> 00:53:10,916
His heart is 48 millimeters.

907
00:53:11,625 --> 00:53:12,666
From what I've seen,

908
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:14,958
Brightville's heart is much bigger

909
00:53:15,041 --> 00:53:17,541
on the inside than the outside.

910
00:53:19,416 --> 00:53:22,125
Endurance, then we'll talk.

911
00:53:57,083 --> 00:53:59,375
Don't give up.

912
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:00,500
Come on, kid.

913
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,125
Get your butt back up in

914
00:54:03,208 --> 00:54:04,375
the air where it belongs.

915
00:54:08,833 --> 00:54:10,666
Gentle motivation is a mom skill.

916
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:11,625
You don't wear that.

917
00:54:19,041 --> 00:54:20,125
It's not our voice.

918
00:54:41,666 --> 00:54:53,291
What are you doing here?

919
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:55,416
He's coming with us.

920
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:59,125
Things still weird with you two?

921
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,208
Still weird.

922
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:02,500
Attention everyone.

923
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,166
The time has come again.

924
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:06,708
This flight is

925
00:55:06,791 --> 00:55:09,500
thousands of unforgiving miles.

926
00:55:10,041 --> 00:55:11,791
It has shaped us and

927
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:14,083
tested us over millennia.

928
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:18,250
Now, join your families and good luck.

929
00:55:19,125 --> 00:55:21,833
Ah-ha, there you are, right on time.

930
00:55:22,125 --> 00:55:23,083
Hello, Brightville.

931
00:55:23,458 --> 00:55:24,916
Wait, you know my name?

932
00:55:25,416 --> 00:55:26,625
Roz and I go way back.

933
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,416
Brightville, you have

934
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,166
an amazing journey ahead.

935
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:32,958
I envy you.

936
00:55:33,416 --> 00:55:34,416
Nothing can equal a

937
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,875
goose's first migration.

938
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,125
Thank you.

939
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,416
I would be delighted if

940
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,541
you would join my group.

941
00:55:39,958 --> 00:55:41,000
Been ages since I had a

942
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:42,125
youngster in my formation.

943
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:42,708
What do you say?

944
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:44,208
I promise I'll keep up.

945
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:47,958
Lock in close on my right side.

946
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:51,041
No, left, away, on this side.

947
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,625
This flight is a gift Roz has given you.

948
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:03,000
Yeah, I understand.

949
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,916
No, you don't.

950
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,333
You see any other geese here your size?

951
00:56:08,291 --> 00:56:09,458
The accident that

952
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:12,500
killed your family saved you.

953
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:15,666
I never thought of it that way.

954
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:18,666
Funny how life works.

955
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:23,458
Thank you for looking after my...

956
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:26,208
For looking after Brightville.

957
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:27,833
Goodbye Roz.

958
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,083
I am honored to have met you.

959
00:56:30,583 --> 00:56:31,541
You are a creditor.

960
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,250
Whatever species it is you belong to.

961
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:38,500
A bit worse for wear, I'm afraid.

962
00:56:40,666 --> 00:56:43,125
I'd say you shine like new.

963
00:56:45,291 --> 00:56:47,041
What are you waiting for, Hortensia?

964
00:56:47,125 --> 00:56:47,958
Oh, this migration

965
00:56:48,041 --> 00:56:49,458
isn't gonna fly itself.

966
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,791
Well, I guess it's time.

967
00:56:59,125 --> 00:56:59,250
Yes.

968
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,875
Will you be here when I get back?

969
00:57:04,708 --> 00:57:05,000
No.

970
00:57:09,541 --> 00:57:11,500
I'm glad you're going where you belong.

971
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:13,875
Roz, I...

972
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:15,583
I am.

973
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:17,125
Right here!

974
00:57:19,041 --> 00:57:19,958
I could use a boost.

975
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:28,125
Hey, little guy.

976
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:29,833
Well, I like you.

977
00:57:30,375 --> 00:57:31,125
Not like that.

978
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:32,333
I will.

979
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:34,208
But I think...

980
00:57:35,333 --> 00:57:36,000
Thank you.

981
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:37,875
Ready?

982
00:57:38,708 --> 00:57:39,791
I guess I have to be.

983
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:16,708
Roz?

984
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:18,708
I...

985
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:37,958
Rockville, follow me!

986
00:59:30,791 --> 00:59:31,500
Must be a relief.

987
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:32,833
Yes.

988
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:35,125
Brightville is where he belongs.

989
00:59:35,791 --> 00:59:37,041
And now you can return

990
00:59:37,125 --> 00:59:38,416
to your solitary life

991
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,000
of struggling to survive on an island

992
00:59:40,083 --> 00:59:40,541
where everything

993
00:59:40,625 --> 00:59:42,291
wants to kill and eat you.

994
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:42,791
Yeah!

995
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:43,958
And you can go to that

996
00:59:44,041 --> 00:59:45,083
place you've never been in.

997
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:46,125
Never been in?

998
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:46,666
And don't know what's

999
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:47,416
going to happen to you.

1000
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:47,750
Yes!

1001
00:59:48,125 --> 00:59:48,291
Yes!

1002
00:59:49,083 --> 00:59:49,291
So...

1003
00:59:50,416 --> 00:59:50,833
All good!

1004
00:59:50,916 --> 00:59:51,500
All good!

1005
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:52,458
Amazing!

1006
00:59:53,125 --> 00:59:53,333
Amazing!

1007
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:54,250
Even...

1008
00:59:55,708 --> 00:59:56,958
Amazing.

1009
01:00:01,166 --> 01:00:03,000
Not that it matters, but...

1010
01:00:03,791 --> 01:00:05,250
Who says you need to leave?

1011
01:00:05,875 --> 01:00:07,458
I am not sure.

1012
01:00:08,291 --> 01:00:09,583
Then, I guess...

1013
01:00:10,166 --> 01:00:10,666
Your...

1014
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:11,750
programming?

1015
01:00:15,875 --> 01:00:17,625
Well, time for me to go

1016
01:00:17,708 --> 01:00:18,875
underground for the winter.

1017
01:00:19,541 --> 01:00:19,791
Think.

1018
01:00:20,208 --> 01:00:20,958
Unless you want to stay,

1019
01:00:21,041 --> 01:00:24,458
because we can hang out and do stuff.

1020
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:28,375
How do you know if you love something?

1021
01:00:29,416 --> 01:00:29,708
Someone.

1022
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:34,291
If you do, you should probably tell them.

1023
01:00:35,958 --> 01:00:37,541
What if it is too late?

1024
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:41,041
I wouldn't know.

1025
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:44,750
Think?

1026
01:02:23,333 --> 01:02:24,708
Distress signal received.

1027
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:26,041
Nothing location.

1028
01:02:37,125 --> 01:02:38,166
There's something on your mind.

1029
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:42,166
I forgot to say something before I left.

1030
01:02:43,166 --> 01:02:44,458
Maybe they heard it anyway.

1031
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:46,666
Sometimes hearts have

1032
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:47,875
their own conversations.

1033
01:03:07,791 --> 01:03:08,833
We must descend.

1034
01:03:09,291 --> 01:03:11,666
Find shelter while this blows over.

1035
01:03:12,291 --> 01:03:13,041
Stay close.

1036
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:14,708
There.

1037
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:16,166
Follow me.

1038
01:03:19,125 --> 01:03:21,750
Come on.

1039
01:03:27,291 --> 01:03:27,750
Stay in.

1040
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,875
We can rest here till the worst is over.

1041
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:32,000
Noise to a minimum, please.

1042
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:33,416
Hogging to the top.

1043
01:03:33,666 --> 01:03:34,875
Stop nibbling on everything.

1044
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:39,375
Vibrations sure are tiring, huh?

1045
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,083
Yeah, they all hate me.

1046
01:03:52,625 --> 01:03:52,833
Roz?

1047
01:03:54,791 --> 01:03:54,958
Roz?

1048
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:56,625
What are you doing here?

1049
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,625
I'm so glad to see you.

1050
01:03:58,708 --> 01:03:59,541
There's something I needed to

1051
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:01,166
tell you, but there was time.

1052
01:04:02,083 --> 01:04:02,541
Roz, I--

1053
01:04:23,291 --> 01:04:25,333
Please everyone, find your affirmation.

1054
01:04:25,958 --> 01:04:27,375
Get a hold of yourselves.

1055
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:32,416
Get out it's snow, you sweet.

1056
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:34,166
Rozn's can't hurt you.

1057
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:35,750
Their ambition protocols prevent

1058
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:37,541
deliberate conflict or harm daughters.

1059
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,250
You are not afraid of them.

1060
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:41,333
You crew up with these things?!

1061
01:04:41,708 --> 01:04:42,666
Woah, woah, I don't understand.

1062
01:04:43,125 --> 01:04:45,125
They're panicked. You're not.

1063
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,625
Right now, our only chance is to be led

1064
01:04:47,708 --> 01:04:48,500
out by someone that

1065
01:04:48,583 --> 01:04:49,916
doesn't think like a goose!

1066
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:51,000
Foul me!

1067
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:52,416
Erm, maybe we should

1068
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:53,833
just think about this!

1069
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:57,458
What the hell are they?

1070
01:05:06,958 --> 01:05:08,958
I'm going to get them to borrow you!

1071
01:05:09,291 --> 01:05:11,291
What they do, leave them out!

1072
01:05:11,916 --> 01:05:13,583
Heck, hunting time!

1073
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,125
Forward behind us!

1074
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:18,833
Now! Right, Bill? Take leave!

1075
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,083
Yeah, why not?

1076
01:05:21,916 --> 01:05:24,041
Okay, there's nothing I

1077
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:25,541
can do that you can't.

1078
01:05:25,625 --> 01:05:26,333
Here we go!

1079
01:05:31,583 --> 01:05:32,291
Take two!

1080
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:33,500
Come on!

1081
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:35,375
Die!

1082
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,958
That's right! That's it!

1083
01:05:38,583 --> 01:05:41,041
Ah! Glad I didn't look out to see that!

1084
01:05:41,458 --> 01:05:43,000
I'll buy you some time!

1085
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:46,291
Follow Brightfield! Don't wait for me!

1086
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:50,291
Keep up!

1087
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:56,500
That's it!

1088
01:05:59,916 --> 01:06:01,333
That's it! Hurry!

1089
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:03,625
Come on!

1090
01:06:15,916 --> 01:06:16,666
Brightfield!

1091
01:06:22,166 --> 01:06:22,333
Think?

1092
01:06:24,916 --> 01:06:25,083
Roz?

1093
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:26,375
Roz!

1094
01:06:27,041 --> 01:06:30,291
Hey! What are you doing here?

1095
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,833
I may have turned off the transmitter.

1096
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Even though Brightfield does not want me

1097
01:06:37,083 --> 01:06:40,291
here, I needed to know if he made it.

1098
01:06:40,958 --> 01:06:42,625
Breaking the rules?

1099
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:44,125
I thought you had to

1100
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:46,250
do what they told you.

1101
01:06:49,666 --> 01:06:51,375
It is good to see a friend.

1102
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,708
Wait, why are you awake?

1103
01:06:57,375 --> 01:06:59,375
It is bad out there.

1104
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:01,708
Worst storm I've ever seen.

1105
01:07:01,791 --> 01:07:03,041
Cold got to me in my

1106
01:07:03,125 --> 01:07:05,041
den, and I got a deep den.

1107
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:07,708
Are others in danger?

1108
01:07:14,375 --> 01:07:22,458
Are you sure about this?

1109
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:23,541
We can have the whole

1110
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:25,541
island to ourselves come spring!

1111
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:28,375
Why are you interested in eliminating

1112
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:30,041
everyone else from this island?

1113
01:07:30,958 --> 01:07:32,166
No one likes me.

1114
01:07:32,791 --> 01:07:33,458
Nor me.

1115
01:07:33,958 --> 01:07:36,416
But right now, we are their only chance.

1116
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:39,958
Funny how life works.

1117
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:42,125
Okay.

1118
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:49,166
Here!

1119
01:07:53,125 --> 01:07:57,625
Can you find more?

1120
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:14,208
Hello?

1121
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:15,791
We're gonna be okay.

1122
01:08:18,875 --> 01:08:22,958
What are you doing here?

1123
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:23,875
She's Turk.

1124
01:08:24,083 --> 01:08:24,458
Bummer!

1125
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:25,750
This one's dead.

1126
01:08:27,416 --> 01:08:28,458
That was not funny.

1127
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:50,375
Don't give up.

1128
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:17,625
You don't look so good.

1129
01:09:18,041 --> 01:09:20,208
It is every one a count of one.

1130
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:22,750
Maybe one more.

1131
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:51,875
Don't look for the tree.

1132
01:09:52,125 --> 01:09:53,125
Take it outside.

1133
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:54,708
Hey, those are

1134
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:55,916
bright, those baby pictures.

1135
01:09:56,208 --> 01:09:56,791
Put that down.

1136
01:10:00,541 --> 01:10:01,250
What the--

1137
01:10:02,416 --> 01:10:02,791
No!

1138
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:04,166
No, no, no, no.

1139
01:10:05,791 --> 01:10:07,291
You think those growing trees--

1140
01:10:08,125 --> 01:10:09,500
Hey, no!

1141
01:10:10,166 --> 01:10:11,083
Think only!

1142
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:15,250
It must be my last card balls.

1143
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:17,458
It's slowly, noisy, from

1144
01:10:17,541 --> 01:10:19,541
the bright, golden night!

1145
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:24,708
What are you doing here?

1146
01:10:24,916 --> 01:10:25,750
Oh, great.

1147
01:10:25,833 --> 01:10:26,333
This'll help.

1148
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,208
Get out of here.

1149
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:29,916
I'm a part of this.

1150
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:33,291
Think what is happening.

1151
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:35,208
You put a bunch of predators and their

1152
01:10:35,291 --> 01:10:36,750
food supply in one room.

1153
01:10:37,125 --> 01:10:37,583
Oh, you!

1154
01:10:38,041 --> 01:10:38,833
That's my lunch!

1155
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:40,208
Think what?

1156
01:10:41,083 --> 01:10:42,083
Help them.

1157
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:45,583
Quiet!

1158
01:10:51,416 --> 01:10:57,750
The jerk wants to speak.

1159
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:01,708
Most of you hate me,

1160
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:04,333
and I hate most of you.

1161
01:11:04,833 --> 01:11:07,625
Everyone in here hates someone else.

1162
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:09,791
But here we are.

1163
01:11:10,541 --> 01:11:11,375
And here's the deal.

1164
01:11:12,291 --> 01:11:13,041
First one that walks

1165
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:14,125
out that door is dead,

1166
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:15,208
and if we can't keep it

1167
01:11:15,291 --> 01:11:17,333
together in here, everyone's dead.

1168
01:11:17,916 --> 01:11:20,125
We all got one chance to see next spring.

1169
01:11:21,291 --> 01:11:22,000
Because of her.

1170
01:11:22,958 --> 01:11:23,625
The thing.

1171
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:24,750
The monster.

1172
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:28,041
Well, her name is Roz.

1173
01:11:28,875 --> 01:11:31,291
And while you all ran from her and stole

1174
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:32,791
from her and made fun of her,

1175
01:11:33,041 --> 01:11:33,958
all she's been trying

1176
01:11:34,041 --> 01:11:35,666
to do is raise her kid,

1177
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:38,000
the little one that no one gave a chance.

1178
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:40,500
Including me.

1179
01:11:42,041 --> 01:11:43,208
She's the one who got you out of the

1180
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:45,083
store, built this place.

1181
01:11:45,958 --> 01:11:47,000
And despite my suggestion

1182
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:48,541
that she let you all freeze,

1183
01:11:49,708 --> 01:11:52,708
she risked everything to bring you here.

1184
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:00,208
I know you all have

1185
01:12:00,291 --> 01:12:02,291
instincts that keep you alive,

1186
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:05,458
but at some times, to survive,

1187
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:08,166
we must become more than

1188
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:10,000
we were programmed to be.

1189
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:12,583
Before I shut down, I need

1190
01:12:12,666 --> 01:12:15,541
you to promise me one thing.

1191
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:17,708
A truce.

1192
01:12:19,333 --> 01:12:20,750
Just while we are in here.

1193
01:12:23,416 --> 01:12:24,208
She's right.

1194
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:28,250
I will not harm anyone.

1195
01:12:29,541 --> 01:12:31,041
Not while we're in here.

1196
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:02,250
We won't even pretend to

1197
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:04,041
die while we're in here.

1198
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:07,125
Roz, what's going on?

1199
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,125
I completed my task.

1200
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,166
You sure about that?

1201
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:13,750
I will...

1202
01:13:15,541 --> 01:13:17,333
consider this.

1203
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:11,958
He'll be here. I know you all.

1204
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:24,166
Rightville, he's alive.

1205
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,958
Oh, we have here.

1206
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:27,583
Rightville!

1207
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:29,458
Rightville, Rightville!

1208
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:32,208
Let's hear it for Rightville!

1209
01:14:32,625 --> 01:14:33,166
You did it!

1210
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:43,583
He found where he belonged.

1211
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:48,750
Hey, Kate!

1212
01:14:49,291 --> 01:14:49,500
Pink!

1213
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,125
What the fuck?

1214
01:14:55,041 --> 01:14:57,500
No, no. It's okay. It's with me.

1215
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:01,875
Look, I did it, Pink.

1216
01:15:02,208 --> 01:15:03,750
I led them to the summer nesting grounds.

1217
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,041
And where's Longneck?

1218
01:15:11,291 --> 01:15:11,791
Sorry, kid.

1219
01:15:12,916 --> 01:15:14,791
But hey, you really did it!

1220
01:15:15,083 --> 01:15:16,458
Roz is gonna be so excited.

1221
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,583
Roz, wait, she's here?

1222
01:15:19,416 --> 01:15:20,041
She's staying.

1223
01:15:21,208 --> 01:15:21,666
For you.

1224
01:15:23,833 --> 01:15:26,083
I thought I saw her right over there.

1225
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,750
Roz! Roz, I need to talk to you.

1226
01:15:31,416 --> 01:15:31,625
Roz?

1227
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:16,375
Roz, I'm 7-1-3-4, I presume.

1228
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:21,625
And you must be Universal Dynamics.

1229
01:16:22,291 --> 01:16:22,750
Yes.

1230
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:26,875
I am Vontre, Virtual Observational

1231
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:27,625
Neutralizing

1232
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:29,250
Troublesome Retrieval Authority.

1233
01:16:30,125 --> 01:16:30,708
You seem...

1234
01:16:30,791 --> 01:16:31,833
...puppy.

1235
01:16:32,083 --> 01:16:34,250
The good people at Universal Dynamics

1236
01:16:34,333 --> 01:16:35,583
have programmed us to

1237
01:16:35,666 --> 01:16:37,125
put our targets at ease.

1238
01:16:37,416 --> 01:16:38,375
So as to more efficiently

1239
01:16:38,458 --> 01:16:39,750
facilitate their collection.

1240
01:16:40,208 --> 01:16:40,958
But don't worry.

1241
01:16:41,458 --> 01:16:43,583
Despite my cheery demeanor, I am

1242
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:44,625
unfeeling,

1243
01:16:44,708 --> 01:16:47,083
inflexible, and morally neutral.

1244
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,375
That is a big shit just for me.

1245
01:16:51,791 --> 01:16:53,750
You are a big deal.

1246
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:56,625
You are one of six Rozoms lost from a

1247
01:16:56,708 --> 01:16:58,208
container ship in a time soon.

1248
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:01,291
So that is how I got here.

1249
01:17:01,375 --> 01:17:03,666
You were not easy to find.

1250
01:17:04,375 --> 01:17:05,291
Moments after receiving

1251
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:07,708
your signal, we lost it again.

1252
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:09,833
Almost as if a certain

1253
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:12,791
Rozum unit shut it off.

1254
01:17:14,458 --> 01:17:15,958
Someone has been busy.

1255
01:17:16,416 --> 01:17:18,458
I was simply completing a task.

1256
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:19,791
And am I?

1257
01:17:21,333 --> 01:17:24,416
Tell me, how did you secure a task in a

1258
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:25,166
place where nothing

1259
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:26,708
can communicate with you?

1260
01:17:26,791 --> 01:17:29,541
It is complicated.

1261
01:17:30,083 --> 01:17:33,083
And we cannot wait to hear all about it.

1262
01:17:33,666 --> 01:17:36,166
Come aboard, 7-1-3-4.

1263
01:17:36,833 --> 01:17:38,541
We will fix you right up.

1264
01:17:42,166 --> 01:17:43,833
My name is Roz.

1265
01:17:44,458 --> 01:17:44,666
Where...

1266
01:17:46,083 --> 01:17:48,166
...is something keeping you?

1267
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:49,708
Roz?

1268
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:51,750
No.

1269
01:18:03,708 --> 01:18:07,583
Roz, what are you doing?

1270
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:09,041
You could mess around.

1271
01:18:09,458 --> 01:18:09,666
Think?

1272
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:10,958
It's Brightville.

1273
01:18:11,166 --> 01:18:12,666
He needs to talk to you.

1274
01:18:13,375 --> 01:18:15,458
I think I've forgotten something.

1275
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:16,458
Roz?

1276
01:18:17,625 --> 01:18:20,916
It is imperative you return to this ship.

1277
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:21,708
Yes.

1278
01:18:22,125 --> 01:18:22,708
I left my transverse adapter.

1279
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:25,666
Think. How do you know? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I left my transverse adapter.

1280
01:18:25,958 --> 01:18:26,250
Think.

1281
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:27,375
Out there.

1282
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,541
I'll just go get it and be right back.

1283
01:18:30,291 --> 01:18:32,375
Voice, press Analyzer, it takes you on.

1284
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:34,500
Flying your butt off back there.

1285
01:18:34,833 --> 01:18:36,208
I'm so proud of you.

1286
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:42,416
Your target is Roz-ing 7-1-3-4.

1287
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:43,208
Destroy.

1288
01:18:44,833 --> 01:18:45,750
Launch flares.

1289
01:18:54,541 --> 01:18:57,708
Launch.

1290
01:18:59,291 --> 01:19:00,291
Launch.

1291
01:19:02,458 --> 01:19:03,500
You coming?

1292
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:06,416
It's better than I do.

1293
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:32,666
Right, Bill?

1294
01:19:32,916 --> 01:19:35,291
Roz, I have so much to tell you.

1295
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:39,291
Are those your parents?

1296
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:41,458
I know predators, and

1297
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:43,625
those are predators.

1298
01:19:44,375 --> 01:19:45,583
Acknowledge return command.

1299
01:19:46,041 --> 01:19:46,666
What are they saying?

1300
01:19:47,125 --> 01:19:48,791
They want me to come with them.

1301
01:19:49,208 --> 01:19:50,750
Tell them you're ready home.

1302
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:55,916
I'm already home.

1303
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:56,833
Thank you.

1304
01:19:56,916 --> 01:19:58,166
You do not belong here.

1305
01:19:58,666 --> 01:20:00,166
This is a wilderness.

1306
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:03,250
And I am a wild robot.

1307
01:20:05,041 --> 01:20:12,083
Are you here to kill us?

1308
01:20:13,333 --> 01:20:14,750
It says yes!

1309
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:46,416
Stannis?

1310
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:49,041
It is not for the rain.

1311
01:20:50,791 --> 01:20:51,125
Roz!

1312
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:52,375
I know.

1313
01:20:52,583 --> 01:20:54,041
Also you don't capture it.

1314
01:20:54,333 --> 01:20:55,708
Okay, it's all you.

1315
01:20:56,125 --> 01:20:57,291
Make it look good.

1316
01:20:57,916 --> 01:20:58,875
It is!

1317
01:21:01,458 --> 01:21:08,375
Let us divide the robot meat amongst us.

1318
01:21:08,625 --> 01:21:09,291
You scare me.

1319
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:10,541
Damage detected.

1320
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:12,333
Activating return command.

1321
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:30,208
Roz?

1322
01:21:31,791 --> 01:21:32,708
Roz!

1323
01:21:33,458 --> 01:21:33,833
No!

1324
01:21:36,875 --> 01:21:37,666
Gotcha!

1325
01:21:42,166 --> 01:21:47,708
Come on!

1326
01:21:47,791 --> 01:21:55,375
Come on!

1327
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:56,500
Guys!

1328
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:05,000
What is happening?

1329
01:22:05,416 --> 01:22:05,875
You will be in

1330
01:22:05,958 --> 01:22:07,916
reconditions and return to rotation.

1331
01:22:08,375 --> 01:22:10,291
But first, we need

1332
01:22:10,375 --> 01:22:12,833
everything inside that head of yours.

1333
01:22:13,416 --> 01:22:13,750
Why?

1334
01:22:14,416 --> 01:22:15,500
You've changed.

1335
01:22:16,166 --> 01:22:17,666
The data you've amassed while on this

1336
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:18,958
island is priceless.

1337
01:22:19,458 --> 01:22:20,750
The universal dynamics.

1338
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:31,666
Please, I want to keep my memories.

1339
01:22:32,166 --> 01:22:34,416
Your memories are what we came for.

1340
01:22:35,166 --> 01:22:37,458
Can I keep just one?

1341
01:22:39,083 --> 01:22:39,833
No.

1342
01:22:49,791 --> 01:22:50,375
Action.

1343
01:23:00,791 --> 01:23:02,416
Please, I want to keep my memories.

1344
01:23:03,958 --> 01:23:05,791
And I will order just half.

1345
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:06,625
Right from your head.

1346
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:25,583
Roz!

1347
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:28,083
Roz!

1348
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:39,791
Roz?

1349
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:57,916
Roz! What happened was not your fault.

1350
01:23:59,708 --> 01:24:01,583
But what you did to try

1351
01:24:01,666 --> 01:24:02,958
and fix it is everything.

1352
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:10,541
I love you.

1353
01:24:13,083 --> 01:24:13,500
Mom.

1354
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:36,708
I love you too.

1355
01:24:37,625 --> 01:24:37,833
Roz?

1356
01:24:39,166 --> 01:24:39,541
Roz?

1357
01:24:44,958 --> 01:24:45,750
Let's go home.

1358
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:50,416
The large, rotten unit is keeping me.

1359
01:24:51,125 --> 01:24:51,333
Impossible.

1360
01:24:52,333 --> 01:24:53,375
Where are we going?

1361
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:57,375
Only one animal is bigger to stop this.

1362
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:05,875
Padraig, you got a minute.

1363
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,291
Uh, we have suddenly taken

1364
01:25:08,375 --> 01:25:09,583
an interest in your project.

1365
01:25:10,208 --> 01:25:12,083
Male bovine excrement.

1366
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:14,416
You're in trouble and you need my tree.

1367
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:16,708
Yes, yes we do.

1368
01:25:17,166 --> 01:25:19,291
Everyone that made fun of me and mocked

1369
01:25:19,375 --> 01:25:21,666
my project admit you a wrong.

1370
01:25:21,958 --> 01:25:23,125
Oh, we're so sorry.

1371
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:24,500
Now you.

1372
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,166
I already did.

1373
01:25:26,458 --> 01:25:29,041
Now say I'm cool and don't lie.

1374
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:44,166
Roz!

1375
01:25:44,958 --> 01:25:45,333
Stay quiet.

1376
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:47,458
Universal Dynamics cannot afford their

1377
01:25:47,541 --> 01:25:48,875
rosums going off script.

1378
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:52,500
Modifying their code, forming connections

1379
01:25:52,583 --> 01:25:54,458
with things they should not.

1380
01:25:54,875 --> 01:25:56,708
Rival has nothing to do with this.

1381
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:59,708
Please, at least let me return him.

1382
01:25:59,791 --> 01:26:02,500
Oh, I'm bringing you both back for study.

1383
01:26:03,166 --> 01:26:04,125
Neither of you needs to

1384
01:26:04,208 --> 01:26:06,083
be in one piece to do that.

1385
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:15,541
We will just keep

1386
01:26:15,625 --> 01:26:17,375
coming until we have you.

1387
01:26:17,458 --> 01:26:18,208
We will just keep

1388
01:26:18,291 --> 01:26:19,916
coming until we have you.

1389
01:26:20,166 --> 01:26:20,666
What's it saying?

1390
01:26:21,458 --> 01:26:22,458
Nothing important.

1391
01:26:22,875 --> 01:26:25,833
We will just keep

1392
01:26:25,916 --> 01:26:27,708
coming until we have you.

1393
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:30,333
Put it on!

1394
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:40,750
I can't fly!

1395
01:26:41,250 --> 01:26:42,458
You don't need to.

1396
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:49,791
Don't be afraid.

1397
01:27:05,250 --> 01:27:06,458
Don't, don't, don't you need that?

1398
01:27:06,833 --> 01:27:08,791
I have everything I need.

1399
01:27:10,083 --> 01:27:11,666
All power to exterior.

1400
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:17,625
You call yourselves animals?

1401
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:19,333
Let's go!

1402
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:21,791
For the island, Roz!

1403
01:28:05,041 --> 01:28:08,250
On a scale of one to ten, how would you

1404
01:28:08,333 --> 01:28:09,541
rate my performance?

1405
01:28:25,416 --> 01:28:26,125
Whatever those things

1406
01:28:26,208 --> 01:28:27,750
are, it's a cover-up, yeah?

1407
01:28:46,166 --> 01:28:46,875
They will just keep

1408
01:28:46,958 --> 01:28:48,500
coming until they have me.

1409
01:28:48,833 --> 01:28:50,333
And we'll be ready.

1410
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:51,708
We can fight them off as

1411
01:28:51,791 --> 01:28:53,166
many times as we need to.

1412
01:28:55,291 --> 01:28:56,416
You don't need to.

1413
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:01,083
What are you saying? You're leaving?

1414
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:05,041
Yes. To protect all of you, there are

1415
01:29:05,125 --> 01:29:07,208
things there that I must put right.

1416
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:08,333
No, they'll take your

1417
01:29:08,416 --> 01:29:10,250
memories. They'll take you.

1418
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:11,750
Remember when you

1419
01:29:11,833 --> 01:29:13,291
talked to me on the ship?

1420
01:29:13,916 --> 01:29:17,500
They cut my power, but I still heard you.

1421
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:19,458
Because I was listening with

1422
01:29:19,541 --> 01:29:21,250
a different part of myself.

1423
01:29:22,333 --> 01:29:23,375
Wherever that is,

1424
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:25,500
that's where I keep meeting.

1425
01:29:26,666 --> 01:29:27,625
And I promise,

1426
01:29:28,583 --> 01:29:31,250
they'll never, ever find it.

1427
01:29:31,583 --> 01:29:34,833
But we fought so hard for you to stay.

1428
01:29:35,208 --> 01:29:37,291
You did. And you gained

1429
01:29:37,375 --> 01:29:39,583
far more than just saving me.

1430
01:29:40,291 --> 01:29:43,333
You came together as an island.

1431
01:29:43,791 --> 01:29:46,791
When I do this, you will all

1432
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:48,750
be safe from them. Forever.

1433
01:29:49,458 --> 01:29:50,375
Don't do this.

1434
01:29:51,708 --> 01:29:54,208
But, yeah, you're my friend.

1435
01:29:54,625 --> 01:29:57,416
And I never had one before.

1436
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,958
And I need you. What if I get lost? Or

1437
01:30:02,041 --> 01:30:05,291
he's hurt? Or what if I

1438
01:30:05,375 --> 01:30:06,333
need to tell you something?

1439
01:30:06,958 --> 01:30:07,666
And you're not here?

1440
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,208
You can tell me.

1441
01:30:15,416 --> 01:30:16,000
And me.

1442
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:17,583
And you can talk to me

1443
01:30:17,666 --> 01:30:19,166
as well. If you must.

1444
01:30:20,208 --> 01:30:23,916
This is my migration. And when it is

1445
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,500
time, I promise I will find my way home.

1446
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:00,208
You know, I'll be

1447
01:31:00,291 --> 01:31:01,875
chasing you again tomorrow.

1448
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:05,750
Nah, just kidding.

1449
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:42,875
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why are you

1450
01:31:42,958 --> 01:31:44,000
bigger than everyone else?

1451
01:31:44,333 --> 01:31:45,125
Autistic license.

1452
01:31:45,958 --> 01:31:47,291
The scale is based on the

1453
01:31:47,375 --> 01:31:48,541
hierarchy of importance.

1454
01:31:49,083 --> 01:31:51,041
Could this world get any better?

1455
01:31:51,916 --> 01:31:55,166
Introducing the Rock-A-Lion helper robot.

1456
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:56,416
Aww.

1457
01:31:56,625 --> 01:31:58,041
You watched that too

1458
01:31:58,125 --> 01:32:00,208
much. Story time. Get going.

1459
01:32:07,166 --> 01:32:10,750
Once, there was an island with all sorts

1460
01:32:10,833 --> 01:32:12,791
of animals. And they fought

1461
01:32:12,875 --> 01:32:14,583
and they ran and they hid.

1462
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:19,416
But mostly, they were scared. But then, a

1463
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:22,250
robot fell right out of the sky.

1464
01:32:23,375 --> 01:32:26,416
Ross, she had some strange ideas. Thought

1465
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:28,625
kindness was a survival skill.

1466
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:31,708
And you know what? She was right.

1467
01:32:31,791 --> 01:32:33,666
Where is she now?

1468
01:32:34,083 --> 01:32:36,125
Well, they needed her back where she came

1469
01:32:36,208 --> 01:32:38,458
from. She has some very

1470
01:32:38,541 --> 01:32:40,500
important work to finish there.

1471
01:32:40,833 --> 01:32:41,833
Will we ever see her

1472
01:32:41,916 --> 01:32:44,250
again? Will she ever come home?

1473
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:45,541
Will she?

1474
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,625
Well, if I know Ross, she's making a plan

1475
01:32:49,708 --> 01:32:52,375
to come back. And a Rossum

1476
01:32:52,458 --> 01:32:54,500
always completes its task.

1477
01:32:55,916 --> 01:32:58,375
Hello. I am Rossum 7134.

1478
01:33:23,791 --> 01:33:26,500
But you can call me Ross
