1
00:00:01,086 --> 00:00:02,220
Previously, on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:02,466 --> 00:00:04,482
Tonight
we rise up as one

3
00:00:04,584 --> 00:00:06,084
and take back
this city.

4
00:00:06,086 --> 00:00:08,319
Slade's got 20 guys
just like him,

5
00:00:08,321 --> 00:00:09,821
and we have
no way to stop him.

6
00:00:09,823 --> 00:00:12,690
Mirakuru. We're going
to use it to make a cure.

7
00:00:12,692 --> 00:00:15,994
Slade promised me city
hall, and he delivered.

8
00:00:15,996 --> 00:00:18,263
I understand he made you
a promise, too.

9
00:00:18,265 --> 00:00:22,300
There is still
one person who has to die.

10
00:00:22,302 --> 00:00:25,770
What's happening
is bigger than you and the city.

11
00:00:25,772 --> 00:00:28,339
There's so many of them!
We can't fight!

12
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:30,775
We're not going to.

13
00:01:00,006 --> 00:01:03,408
Laurel.

14
00:01:08,013 --> 00:01:11,182
Laurel?

15
00:01:11,184 --> 00:01:13,017
Laurel!

16
00:01:16,889 --> 00:01:19,057
You killed me...

17
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:21,593
Let me return
the favor.

18
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,467
You can't kill me.

19
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:31,669
You're not invincible.

20
00:01:31,671 --> 00:01:33,471
Close enough.

21
00:01:33,473 --> 00:01:35,139
Laurel!

22
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:38,142
Oliver!

23
00:01:38,144 --> 00:01:40,878
Are you ok?

24
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,047
The tunnel collapsed.

25
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,116
I'm trapped.

26
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:46,884
I just...

27
00:01:46,886 --> 00:01:50,154
It's getting really...

28
00:01:50,156 --> 00:01:51,355
Hard to breathe!

29
00:01:51,357 --> 00:01:53,023
You are going
to be ok.

30
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:55,760
I need you to tell me
everything that you see.

31
00:01:55,762 --> 00:02:00,097
Rocks, and water, and--

32
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,800
and your bow.

33
00:02:02,802 --> 00:02:05,102
You see my quiver?!

34
00:02:07,806 --> 00:02:11,642
Wait! Yeah, yes,
I have it! I have it.

35
00:02:11,644 --> 00:02:12,910
How many arrows
are in it?

36
00:02:12,912 --> 00:02:14,745
There's a bunch of them.

37
00:02:14,747 --> 00:02:17,248
There should be one
with a metallic head

38
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,983
that's bigger than
the rest of them.

39
00:02:18,985 --> 00:02:20,451
Do you see it?

40
00:02:20,453 --> 00:02:22,286
Why do I need this?

41
00:02:22,288 --> 00:02:26,490
Because it's
an explosive arrow.

42
00:02:26,492 --> 00:02:30,094
And you're going
to fire it.

43
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:41,438
Do you want to save me
some time and energy?

44
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,775
Then tell me where I can
find Felicity Smoak.

45
00:02:44,777 --> 00:02:47,812
I have been aching
to put a bullet in her

46
00:02:47,814 --> 00:02:51,115
smug little face
ever since the day--

47
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:57,621
Oh, I really thought
the airbags were going to go off.

48
00:03:00,258 --> 00:03:03,027
Thanks for the help.

49
00:03:03,029 --> 00:03:05,129
Any word from Oliver?

50
00:03:06,498 --> 00:03:09,300
Dig...

51
00:03:09,302 --> 00:03:11,669
What do you think,
hit her again?

52
00:03:11,671 --> 00:03:13,971
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

53
00:04:00,785 --> 00:04:04,121
Get out! Get out!

54
00:04:04,123 --> 00:04:07,291
Get out!

55
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:16,333
Reports are coming in
from all over the city.

56
00:04:16,335 --> 00:04:18,369
Starling General
is preparing for possible casualties.

57
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:20,237
Power is out south
of Harbor Boulevard.

58
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,706
Governor. Governor.

59
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,842
Sending in the National
Guard at this point

60
00:04:24,844 --> 00:04:26,844
will only cause
mass hysteria.

61
00:04:26,846 --> 00:04:28,112
Trust me
and my police force.

62
00:04:28,114 --> 00:04:30,581
We have this situation
under control.

63
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,579
Mr. Mayor.
D.A. Spencer.

64
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:34,999
What is going on?

65
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,541
There are men in masks
tearing through the city.

66
00:04:37,657 --> 00:04:39,256
Yes, I know. And we're doing 
everything we can.

67
00:04:39,258 --> 00:04:41,091
The SCPD have
already mobilized.

68
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:42,393
No, the police
force, they're not

69
00:04:42,395 --> 00:04:43,928
equipped
to handle this.

70
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,529
You don't
understand.

71
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:47,731
I have never seen anything
like this before.

72
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:49,033
These--the men
in masks,

73
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:51,268
it--it's like
they're not human.

74
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,569
Not human?

75
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:54,138
Kate, do you even hear yourself?

76
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,539
Look, I know you're scared,

77
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,775
but you need to pull
yourself together.

78
00:04:57,777 --> 00:05:01,078
Starling City needs both of us
thinking clearly right now.

79
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,981
How are you so calm?

80
00:05:07,052 --> 00:05:10,020
Because I know we're going
to get through this.

81
00:05:10,022 --> 00:05:13,490
And when we do, Starling City will be
stronger and better for it.

82
00:05:13,492 --> 00:05:15,759
Can I count on you?

83
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:17,828
I need you with me on this.

84
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,863
Mm-hmm.

85
00:05:19,865 --> 00:05:21,632
Good.

86
00:05:21,634 --> 00:05:23,500
Then let's save
the city together.

87
00:05:27,973 --> 00:05:31,475
Are you far enough away from the debris
to avoid the blast?

88
00:05:31,477 --> 00:05:33,177
I don't know!

89
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:36,246
What if I can't shoot that far?

90
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:37,815
The bow's a hybrid
compound, Laurel.

91
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:39,383
It's going to do
all the work for you.

92
00:05:39,385 --> 00:05:41,151
All I need you to do...

93
00:05:41,153 --> 00:05:44,154
Just aim at the middle
of the debris.

94
00:05:44,156 --> 00:05:46,390
Take a deep breath.

95
00:05:46,392 --> 00:05:48,392
Center your feet.

96
00:05:48,394 --> 00:05:50,761
Left hand on the bow.

97
00:05:50,763 --> 00:05:53,397
Place the arrow
on the drawstring.

98
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:56,000
Ok, ok, ok, ok, ok.

99
00:05:57,135 --> 00:05:59,970
All right,
I want you to pull back

100
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:02,106
on the drawstring.

101
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:06,010
And keep
your left arm straight.

102
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:08,045
Ok?

103
00:06:08,047 --> 00:06:09,613
You count to three

104
00:06:09,615 --> 00:06:12,049
and then you just
let go.

105
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:14,318
You can do this.

106
00:06:16,654 --> 00:06:20,324
1, 2...

107
00:06:22,594 --> 00:06:24,728
3!

108
00:06:46,418 --> 00:06:48,352
Nice shot.

109
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:55,959
Diggle, you there?

110
00:06:55,961 --> 00:06:57,394
Yeah, Oliver, we hear you.

111
00:06:57,396 --> 00:06:59,763
We're coming up.

112
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,038
Sara's gone.

113
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,740
Slade must have taken her.

114
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:11,375
Chert.

115
00:07:11,377 --> 00:07:13,210
What's that?

116
00:07:13,212 --> 00:07:17,581
It's sonar.
I was monitoring the "Amazo."

117
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,783
She's moving.

118
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:24,455
We have one torpedo
left, right?

119
00:07:24,457 --> 00:07:26,256
Da.

120
00:07:26,258 --> 00:07:28,625
Could you rig it to fire
in a straight line?

121
00:07:28,627 --> 00:07:31,028
I'm discovering capacity
to do many things

122
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,197
I never thought
I would do.

123
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:36,366
I need you

124
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:38,302
to get the sub close enough
to the freighter

125
00:07:38,304 --> 00:07:40,237
so that I can swim over.

126
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,376
Well, then, what do you need
torpedo for?

127
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:49,279
If Sara and I
aren't back in an hour...

128
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:52,783
You're going to sink
the "Amazo."

129
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:03,427
Freeze!

130
00:08:28,352 --> 00:08:31,254
Who are you?

131
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:38,127
I'm her father.

132

Dad!

135
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:49,305
Laurel, thank God.

136
00:08:49,307 --> 00:08:51,107
Are you safe?

137
00:08:51,109 --> 00:08:52,642
I am now.

138
00:08:52,644 --> 00:08:54,310
I'm with the Arrow.

139
00:08:54,312 --> 00:08:56,445
Well, that's--
that's good.

140
00:08:56,447 --> 00:08:59,782
Now listen, something tells me
he's got work to do.

141
00:08:59,784 --> 00:09:02,084
I want you off the streets.
Yeah.

142
00:09:02,086 --> 00:09:04,620
Laurel, please, keep low, keep out
of sight, all right?

143
00:09:04,622 --> 00:09:07,657
Dad, I know, you don't have
to worry...about me.

144
00:09:18,302 --> 00:09:20,970
- You ok?
- Yeah.

145
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:22,568
You?

146
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:24,520
Isabel attacked Dig so I hit her
with the van.

147
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,399
Slade's army.

148
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:28,301
He has at least
50 men out there,

149
00:09:28,303 --> 00:09:30,203
all like him.
They're everywhere.

150
00:09:30,205 --> 00:09:31,638
We need
to stop them.

151
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,740
We might have a way.
S.T.A.R. Labs called.

152
00:09:33,742 --> 00:09:36,443
They have a cure.
There's a courier en route.

153
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:37,911
Where is it?

154
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:52,325
Hello?

155
00:09:52,327 --> 00:09:54,127
Hey, it's Felicity Smoak.
Where are you?

156
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:57,731
Fourth street, I think. I don't
know what happened.

157
00:09:57,733 --> 00:10:00,734
A guy in a hockey mask came out
of nowhere and attacked my truck.

158
00:10:00,736 --> 00:10:02,736
Please help me.
Stay where you are.

159
00:10:02,738 --> 00:10:04,170
I can't move
even if I wanted to.

160
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:07,374
I think my leg's broken.
You should go.

161
00:10:07,376 --> 00:10:09,075
Laurel, I'm not leaving you out here
in the middle of this.

162
00:10:09,077 --> 00:10:10,810
The precinct,
it's in the other direction.

163
00:10:10,812 --> 00:10:13,046
I'll be fine.

164
00:10:13,048 --> 00:10:14,114
No.

165
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:15,415
I don't need you right now.

166
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:17,550
Everyone else does.

167
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:22,255
So go.

168
00:10:22,257 --> 00:10:24,658
Go save the city.

169
00:10:27,228 --> 00:10:29,629
Hey!
You still there?

170
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:31,931
Yeah, I'm here.
I pinged your phone.

171
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:33,300
On our way.

172
00:10:33,302 --> 00:10:36,503
Please hurry.

173
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:38,905
Find him.

174
00:10:55,165 --> 00:10:58,388
In the last five minutes,
SCPD has had over 200 reports

175
00:10:58,389 --> 00:11:00,523
of masked men
attacking the city.

176
00:11:03,194 --> 00:11:06,062
Should have gone with Laurel
and made sure she got to the precinct.

177
00:11:06,064 --> 00:11:08,431
She'll be with her father,
she'll be fine.

178
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:10,199
She will, Oliver.

179
00:11:17,274 --> 00:11:19,742
All right.

180
00:11:19,744 --> 00:11:23,279
We are 10 meters away
from the freighter.

181
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:25,281
But still,
this is sumassed shitty crazy.

182
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:28,618
Crazy. You cannot
even be certain that Wilson has her.

183
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,319
You're a good man, Anatoly.

184
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:32,989
If this is good-bye, be safe.

185
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,024
I will see you soon.
You and Sara.

186
00:11:35,026 --> 00:11:36,259
I meant what I said.

187
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:38,327
If we're not back
in an hour,

188
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:40,196
you sink the freighter
and get yourself home.

189
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:43,266
I think maybe
I prefer Bahamas.

190
00:11:45,202 --> 00:11:48,404
Oliver.

191
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:50,940
I don't know if we will see
each other again.

192
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:53,176
But know that you have made
friend for life.

193
00:11:53,178 --> 00:11:57,480
If there is anything you need,
it does not matter what...

194
00:11:57,482 --> 00:11:59,682
You have only to ask.

195
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:06,489
Prochnost,
my friend.

196
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:08,157
Proch--prochnost.

197
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,160
Prochnost--proch--
I also teach you to speak Russian.

198
00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:20,269
Listen up. We're going
to establish a perimeter

199
00:12:20,271 --> 00:12:22,071
with check-points
at 5th and Adams,

200
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:23,840
2nd and Kingsley. We got to create
a safe zone, you hear me?

201
00:12:23,842 --> 00:12:25,074
Who the hell
are these guys?

202
00:12:25,076 --> 00:12:26,809
These guys are the enemy.

203
00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:28,845
They're attacking
innocents at random,

204
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:30,613
creating mayhem
and chaos.

205
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:31,781
We need
to put them down.

206
00:12:31,783 --> 00:12:33,316
Lieutenant--
now!

207
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:34,684
Listen to me, these guys,
have you seen them?

208
00:12:34,686 --> 00:12:37,086
Huh? You seen these guys?
They do not go down!

209
00:12:37,088 --> 00:12:38,621
We got to call in
the National Guard.

210
00:12:38,623 --> 00:12:40,289
That's a call
for the mayor.

211
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,490
And he hasn't
made that yet.

212
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:42,859
And he won't.

213
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:45,294
Mayor Blood
let this happen.

214
00:12:45,296 --> 00:12:47,864
What?
Trust me.

215
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:49,999
Blood's behind this.

216
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:52,435
Look, even
if I believe you...

217
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:54,503
I don't have
that kind of authority.

218
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:56,172
Well, in an emergency,
the chief of police does,

219
00:12:56,174 --> 00:12:57,373
so get him on the line.

220
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:59,475
Chief's dead.

221
00:13:01,378 --> 00:13:03,980
Well, then...

222
00:13:03,982 --> 00:13:07,216
There's only
one more guy we can call.

223
00:13:07,218 --> 00:13:08,885
You're not going
to like it.

224
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,255
The Vigilante.

225
00:13:12,257 --> 00:13:13,789
The Arrow.

226
00:13:16,693 --> 00:13:17,994
Lieutenant,

227
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:19,240
I know he's
breaking the law.

228
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:20,893
But what we're up against,
it's not about the law.

229
00:13:20,918 --> 00:13:22,399
It's about survival.

230
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,533
We got masks tearing
our city to pieces,

231
00:13:24,535 --> 00:13:27,403
and we're going to need
a mask to stop 'em.

232
00:13:33,877 --> 00:13:35,378
Make the call.

233
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,513
Ok, let's do it.

234
00:13:37,515 --> 00:13:39,849
One more thing--

235
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:43,452
you know more about what's going
on over everyone else I got.

236
00:13:43,454 --> 00:13:46,589
I need you making decisions
and leading these men...

237
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:48,291
Detective.

238
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:10,179
Follow me. I can
get you to safety.

239
00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:22,325
Sara...

240
00:14:31,002 --> 00:14:34,036
We lost contact
with our reporter on the streets,

241
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:37,873
but we have over two dozen confirmed
sightings of masked men

242
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,709
attacking numerous
municipal locations.

243
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:42,845
Officials are asking
that you stay indoors...

244
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:58,094
Stop!
No, no, no!

245
00:14:58,096 --> 00:14:59,395
Enough!

246
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:00,796
This isn't part of the plan!

247
00:15:00,798 --> 00:15:01,998
Sebastian?!

248
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,933
I am mayor of Starling City,

249
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,435
and I order you to let her go.

250
00:15:10,741 --> 00:15:13,075
I don't take
orders from you.

251
00:15:21,251 --> 00:15:23,219
No...

252
00:15:30,927 --> 00:15:34,730
Any word
from Thea? Is she safe?

253
00:15:35,732 --> 00:15:36,999
She decided
to leave Starling

254
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:38,567
before the attacks started.

255
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:41,203
Just under two miles
to the bridge. And the courier.

256
00:15:41,205 --> 00:15:43,472
It's for you.

257
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:47,309
What is it, Detective?

258
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:49,145
How can we help you?
We?

259
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:50,579
The Starling City
police force

260
00:15:50,581 --> 00:15:51,814
is standing with you
on this one.

261
00:15:51,816 --> 00:15:53,949
We need help
containing the soldiers.

262
00:15:53,951 --> 00:15:55,786
We're working something
and it may stop them

263
00:15:55,811 --> 00:15:57,587
but we need more time.

264
00:15:57,588 --> 00:16:00,956
We can do that. Whatever you're
doing, good luck.

265
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:03,492
For all our sakes.

266
00:16:07,464 --> 00:16:10,099
This is the only street
that feeds into the bridge.

267
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,671
Floor it!

268
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:28,484
Hold on!

269
00:16:52,963 --> 00:16:55,931
Dig?

270
00:16:57,467 --> 00:16:58,701
Diggle!

271
00:16:58,703 --> 00:17:00,569
Yeah, yeah.

272
00:17:00,571 --> 00:17:02,238
Is she breathing?

273
00:17:03,874 --> 00:17:05,875
Felicity!
Yeah, yeah.

274
00:17:05,877 --> 00:17:07,209
Then we have
to get out of here.

275
00:17:07,211 --> 00:17:09,779
Yeah, I'm on it.

276
00:18:03,393 --> 00:18:05,661
Thea!

277
00:18:05,663 --> 00:18:08,264
I'm not here to hurt you.

278
00:18:09,366 --> 00:18:12,134
Why should I
believe you?

279
00:18:12,136 --> 00:18:14,524
You're
a murderer!

280
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:17,893
Terrorist,
and psychopath!

281
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:20,396
I don't expect you
to understand what I've done.

282
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:22,198
Not now.

283
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,000
Not without more time
to explain.

284
00:18:25,002 --> 00:18:29,205
How are you
even alive?

285
00:18:29,207 --> 00:18:31,841
Why are here?

286
00:18:31,843 --> 00:18:33,342
I heard what happened
to your mother.

287
00:18:33,344 --> 00:18:35,845
I needed to make sure
you were all right.

288
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:37,546
I needed to see my daughter.

289
00:18:37,548 --> 00:18:41,917
I am not
your daughter!

290
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,019
You're nothing to me!

291
00:18:44,021 --> 00:18:46,088
And I want nothing
from you.

292
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,656
Do you understand?

293
00:18:47,658 --> 00:18:50,359
Yes. But right now,

294
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:52,428
you need my help.

295
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,530
My protection.

296
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:56,932
You have no idea, Thea,
how dangerous it is out there.

297
00:18:56,934 --> 00:19:01,470
The city is falling. At least let me
take you to safety.

298
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:19,955
They say Nero sang

299
00:19:19,957 --> 00:19:22,424
as he watched
Rome burn.

300
00:19:22,426 --> 00:19:25,194
Now I understand why.

301
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:29,732
If only Shado were here
to witness this.

302
00:19:32,202 --> 00:19:34,403
Who's Shado?

303
00:19:34,405 --> 00:19:36,472
What the hell is going on?

304
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:39,508
Once of your juiced-up jack boots
just killed my entire office staff,

305
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,477
and snapped
the district attorney's neck!

306
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:44,547
And?
And.

307
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:46,549
And I never agreed to this!

308
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:48,717
You were supposed
to call off your dogs.

309
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:52,621
That was your plan,
Mr. Blood, not mine.

310
00:19:52,623 --> 00:19:55,357
We had a deal.

311
00:19:58,161 --> 00:20:02,631
And do you feel that
I've not lived up to my end of it?

312
00:20:04,701 --> 00:20:07,203
Those are innocent people.

313
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:10,072
Dying out there.

314
00:20:10,074 --> 00:20:11,907
You do not need to kill them.

315
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:13,776
Yes, I do!

316
00:20:13,778 --> 00:20:16,712
I made a promise
to someone once,

317
00:20:16,714 --> 00:20:20,216
and I will uphold it.

318
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:23,686
So this really is
all about you

319
00:20:23,688 --> 00:20:26,889
just trying to hurt
Oliver Queen.

320
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:28,591
I vowed to him

321
00:20:28,593 --> 00:20:31,427
that I would
take away everything

322
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:35,497
and everyone he loves.

323
00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:38,300
And he loves this city.

324
00:20:38,302 --> 00:20:40,269
But this city...

325
00:20:40,271 --> 00:20:42,938
It's mine, too.

326
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,441
Not anymore.

327
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:47,209
As of tomorrow night,

328
00:20:47,211 --> 00:20:51,447
it'll be nothing but
rubble, ash, and death.

329
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:54,483
A land only good
for one thing.

330
00:20:56,486 --> 00:20:58,988
Graves.

331
00:21:05,428 --> 00:21:07,997
Oh, my God.

332
00:21:20,043 --> 00:21:22,111
Sara...

333
00:21:22,113 --> 00:21:23,979
Where have you been?

334
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:27,049
Doesn't matter.

335
00:21:27,051 --> 00:21:29,818
Why did you come back?

336
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,854
I don't know.

337
00:21:31,856 --> 00:21:34,356
There isn't anything
here for me.

338
00:21:36,027 --> 00:21:38,961
Your family's here.

339
00:21:47,304 --> 00:21:51,140
You don't know,
Laurel, about me.

340
00:21:51,142 --> 00:21:54,376
About who I am
and who I've become.

341
00:21:54,378 --> 00:21:57,880
I know you're a hero.

342
00:21:57,882 --> 00:21:59,682
I'm not a hero...

343
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:02,117
Laurel.

344
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:05,521
I am the furthest
thing from it.

345
00:22:05,523 --> 00:22:07,756
I am "Ta-er Sah-fer."

346
00:22:07,758 --> 00:22:10,025
That was my new name.

347
00:22:10,027 --> 00:22:11,894
Because the woman
that I was...

348
00:22:11,896 --> 00:22:16,098
The girl that I was,

349
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,668
was gone.

350
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,837
I'm not going to pretend
that I've been through

351
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:24,073
anything that you have.

352
00:22:24,075 --> 00:22:27,509
One thing that I've learned
in the past year

353
00:22:27,511 --> 00:22:29,878
is that these things...

354
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,881
They don't break us.

355
00:22:34,584 --> 00:22:37,086
They make us who we are.

356
00:22:37,088 --> 00:22:41,256
And what I am...

357
00:22:41,258 --> 00:22:44,226
is irredeemable.

358
00:22:44,228 --> 00:22:46,462
What was that word
you said before?

359
00:22:46,464 --> 00:22:49,298
Ta-er Sah-fer.

360
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,201
What does that mean?

361
00:22:55,572 --> 00:22:58,240
It means
"The Canary."

362
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,644
If you're so far gone

363
00:23:02,646 --> 00:23:05,714
and so irredeemable...

364
00:23:10,186 --> 00:23:12,621
Then why would they know you
by such a beautiful name?

365
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:47,122
Ollie! Ollie!

366
00:23:47,124 --> 00:23:49,124
Ollie, Ollie, Ollie!
Thank God!

367
00:23:49,126 --> 00:23:50,526
Ollie, Ollie...

368
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,394
Come with me.

369
00:23:52,396 --> 00:23:54,563
All right,
come with me.

370
00:23:54,565 --> 00:23:56,231
The sub is right
alongside the freighter.

371
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:57,599
You just need
to swim, ok?

372
00:23:57,601 --> 00:23:58,567
Ok.

373
00:23:58,569 --> 00:23:59,701
Ok, what
are you doing?

374
00:23:59,703 --> 00:24:02,271
I can't leave yet.

375
00:24:02,273 --> 00:24:03,806
Ollie, come on.

376
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:05,574
The cure.
No!

377
00:24:05,576 --> 00:24:08,143
I can't--I can't
leave Slade behind.

378
00:24:08,145 --> 00:24:10,779
I'm not just going to--
I'm not just going to write him off.

379
00:24:10,781 --> 00:24:12,648
We injected him
with the Mirakuru.

380
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,483
But it was me--
Ollie.

381
00:24:14,485 --> 00:24:16,652
I chose you over Shado.

382
00:24:16,654 --> 00:24:19,254
I--I just--I just
want to go home.

383
00:24:19,256 --> 00:24:21,824
I just want to see
my family, Ollie.

384
00:24:23,494 --> 00:24:26,528
Come on, please!

385
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:29,164
I need to do this.

386
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:31,066
I need to save my friend.

387
00:24:31,068 --> 00:24:33,435
I need to at least try.

388
00:24:36,005 --> 00:24:38,974
Get to the sub.

389
00:24:38,976 --> 00:24:42,311
Get safe.

390
00:24:42,313 --> 00:24:44,580
Not without you.

391
00:24:44,582 --> 00:24:46,849
Sara...

392
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:49,017
Come on.

393
00:24:52,022 --> 00:24:54,389
It's Dad.

394
00:24:54,391 --> 00:24:55,691
Hello?

395
00:24:55,693 --> 00:24:57,125
Laurel, baby,
where are you?

396
00:24:57,127 --> 00:24:59,528
55th and Alfred--
there were a few roadblocks.

397
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,698
But you're ok?
Yeah. Sara's with me.

398
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,868
Right. Ok. Listen,
stay there, both of you.

399
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,736
I'm on my way.

400
00:25:07,738 --> 00:25:10,506
I can walk.
Where is he?

401
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:13,876
The cell phone GPS says he should
be within a 500-foot radius.

402
00:25:13,878 --> 00:25:15,511
I'll call him.

403
00:25:17,414 --> 00:25:19,515
Hey, where are you?

404
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,750
We're here, where are you?
Honk your horn.

405
00:25:21,752 --> 00:25:23,185
Cool. Hold on.

406
00:25:25,256 --> 00:25:27,656
Wait! I can see your feet.

407
00:25:27,658 --> 00:25:29,458
You're standing
right outside my car.

408
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,361
That's not us.

409
00:25:44,841 --> 00:25:47,743
Oh, no!

410
00:25:49,012 --> 00:25:51,947
It's gone.

411
00:25:59,322 --> 00:26:01,290
The situation has intensified

412
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:04,426
as officials struggle
to contain this historic assault

413
00:26:04,428 --> 00:26:05,994
gripping our city.

414
00:26:05,996 --> 00:26:09,364
Mr. Wilson. Is this
what you're looking for?

415
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:17,973
Yes, it is.

416
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,151
I just got off the phone
with Cisco at S.T.A.R. Labs...

417
00:26:34,153 --> 00:26:36,520
The cure they sent us
was all they had.

418
00:26:36,522 --> 00:26:39,023
And they used all the Mirakuru
that we gave them,

419
00:26:39,025 --> 00:26:40,691
so they can't make more.

420
00:26:40,693 --> 00:26:44,562
We can't stop Slade's
men without the cure.

421
00:26:44,564 --> 00:26:45,763
We'll find
another way.

422
00:26:45,765 --> 00:26:47,198
There is no other way!

423
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,734
Diggle, the foundry's
been compromised

424
00:26:49,736 --> 00:26:51,402
and we need to get
Roy out of there.

425
00:26:51,404 --> 00:26:54,505
I'm on it.

426
00:26:59,845 --> 00:27:01,979
I didn't
know, Felicity.

427
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:04,815
Five years ago, I was
a completely different person.

428
00:27:04,817 --> 00:27:06,517
And I had...

429
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:11,522
No idea that something like
this was even...

430
00:27:11,524 --> 00:27:15,259
Possible. I couldn't
have imagined.

431
00:27:15,261 --> 00:27:19,196
When you and Diggle
brought me back to Starling City,

432
00:27:19,198 --> 00:27:22,099
I made a vow to myself
that I would never let anything

433
00:27:22,101 --> 00:27:24,902
like the Undertaking
happen again.

434
00:27:24,904 --> 00:27:26,637
What's happening now
is not your fault.

435
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:29,640
Yes, it is.

436
00:27:29,642 --> 00:27:33,944
I have failed
this city.

437
00:27:33,946 --> 00:27:36,113
Yao Fei.

438
00:27:36,115 --> 00:27:38,716
Shado.
Tommy.

439
00:27:38,718 --> 00:27:41,318
My father,
my mother.

440
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:45,189
All that I have
ever wanted to do

441
00:27:45,191 --> 00:27:47,358
is honor those people.

442
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,927
You honor the dead by fighting.

443
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,832
And you are not done fighting!

444
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:58,335
Malcolm Merlyn,

445
00:27:58,337 --> 00:28:00,471
the Count,
the Clock King,

446
00:28:00,473 --> 00:28:03,541
the Triad--everyone who is
trying to hurt this city,

447
00:28:03,543 --> 00:28:05,342
you stopped them.

448
00:28:07,379 --> 00:28:09,680
And you will stop Slade.

449
00:28:09,682 --> 00:28:12,082
I don't know how.
Neither do I.

450
00:28:12,084 --> 00:28:15,653
But I do know
two things.

451
00:28:15,655 --> 00:28:18,823
You are not alone.

452
00:28:22,093 --> 00:28:23,928
And I believe in you.

453
00:28:36,141 --> 00:28:38,976
Where's Dad?
He should be here by now.

454
00:28:38,978 --> 00:28:41,245
You should get
to a better vantage point.

455
00:28:41,247 --> 00:28:44,315
Somebody help!
Please, help!

456
00:28:44,317 --> 00:28:47,184
Please!
Stay here.

457
00:28:49,487 --> 00:28:52,857
Someone help!
Please help!

458
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:54,959
Someone help!

459
00:28:54,961 --> 00:28:57,461
Please!

460
00:28:57,463 --> 00:29:01,165
My daughter is still inside,
I couldn't get to her!

461
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:03,667
Don't, it's too dangerous!

462
00:29:06,104 --> 00:29:07,738
Laurel!
Dad!

463
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,772
Are you hurt?

464
00:29:08,774 --> 00:29:10,774
No, I'm fine.
I'm ok.

465
00:29:10,776 --> 00:29:13,043
My daughter's still inside,
I couldn't get to her!

466
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:15,479
Dad!

467
00:29:16,781 --> 00:29:20,384
Delta Charlie 52
to Central, copy!

468
00:29:20,386 --> 00:29:23,187
Delta Charlie 52
to Central, copy!

469
00:29:23,189 --> 00:29:27,191
Delta Charlie 52 to Central,
please copy me, now!

470
00:29:28,426 --> 00:29:31,896
Delta Charlie 52 to Central--
Dad.

471
00:29:37,168 --> 00:29:40,204
My baby, my baby!

472
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:54,118
Oh, my baby.

473
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,154
Who was that?

474
00:29:58,189 --> 00:30:01,525
That's the Canary.

475
00:30:01,527 --> 00:30:03,327
Thea, please,
come with me.

476
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:05,863
I don't want
anything to do with you.

477
00:30:05,865 --> 00:30:08,532
I don't want
to even see you!

478
00:30:11,236 --> 00:30:13,370
Stay behind me.

479
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:34,591
You're out of arrows.

480
00:30:34,593 --> 00:30:37,061
You're not!

481
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,941
Oliver...

482
00:30:50,943 --> 00:30:52,876
This is your phone.

483
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:04,455
What do you want?

484
00:31:04,457 --> 00:31:05,789
Same thing you do, Oliver.

485
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:07,791
To save this city
before it's too late.

486
00:31:07,793 --> 00:31:08,959
It's already too late.

487
00:31:08,961 --> 00:31:11,562
You were right
about Slade Wilson.

488
00:31:11,564 --> 00:31:13,430
I should have
listened to you.

489
00:31:13,432 --> 00:31:15,599
But I'm here now
and I can help you.

490
00:31:15,601 --> 00:31:17,334
Why should I trust you?

491
00:31:17,336 --> 00:31:19,269
Because, Oliver...

492
00:31:19,271 --> 00:31:22,106
I have
the Mirakuru cure.

493
00:31:33,567 --> 00:31:35,668
How much venom
do we have to keep him under?

494
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,169
Two hours, maybe.

495
00:31:37,171 --> 00:31:39,672
Let's go.

496
00:31:39,674 --> 00:31:41,106
Hey.

497
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:43,175
I need you
to stay with Roy.

498
00:31:43,177 --> 00:31:45,511
Ok.

499
00:31:47,214 --> 00:31:50,249
Oliver, John--

500
00:31:50,251 --> 00:31:51,584
um, maybe
this is obvious,

501
00:31:51,586 --> 00:31:53,018
but are we sure
this isn't a trap?

502
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,624
No.

503
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:00,359
I'm just saying, if you guys don't
come back alive,

504
00:32:00,361 --> 00:32:02,261
I'm going to be
really pissed.

505
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:33,859
As a young boy, I was
plagued by nightmares.

506
00:32:33,861 --> 00:32:36,322
Every night, I would
wake up in a cold sweat,

507
00:32:36,347 --> 00:32:38,332
frightened and alone.

508
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:42,001
It was my father's face
that haunted me.

509
00:32:43,903 --> 00:32:46,171
And this is how
I saw him.

510
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:50,476
The embodiment
of desperation and despair.

511
00:32:50,478 --> 00:32:53,679
I made this mask
to conquer my fears.

512
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:56,715
And remind myself
why I fight,

513
00:32:56,717 --> 00:32:58,784
every day,

514
00:32:58,786 --> 00:33:03,622
to give this city's
most desperate a chance.

515
00:33:03,624 --> 00:33:07,993
All I ever wanted
to do was help people, Oliver.

516
00:33:07,995 --> 00:33:10,262
Then help me
believe.

517
00:33:10,264 --> 00:33:12,364
Where is the cure?

518
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:14,833
Slade Wilson will not rest

519
00:33:14,835 --> 00:33:18,737
until he honors the promise
that he made you.

520
00:33:18,739 --> 00:33:22,675
I won't be so easy to kill once
we level the playing field.

521
00:33:22,677 --> 00:33:24,310
He's not interested
in killing you.

522
00:33:24,312 --> 00:33:25,678
Not until he's taken away

523
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,479
everything
and everyone you love.

524
00:33:27,481 --> 00:33:30,149
After he murdered
my mother,

525
00:33:30,151 --> 00:33:33,719
he said one more
person had to die.

526
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:36,855
Whoever you love the most.

527
00:33:45,965 --> 00:33:48,367
I hope you can
beat him with this.

528
00:33:49,836 --> 00:33:51,670
For all our sakes.

529
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,774
And when this is over,
I promise you...

530
00:33:55,776 --> 00:33:57,209
I will do everything

531
00:33:57,211 --> 00:33:59,144
in my power to rebuild
Starling City.

532
00:33:59,146 --> 00:34:00,913
And I won't just
make it what it was.

533
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:02,348
I will make it better.

534
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,350
Like I always planned.

535
00:34:04,352 --> 00:34:05,918
You really think...

536
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,554
After everything
that's happened,

537
00:34:08,556 --> 00:34:11,990
after what you've done,

538
00:34:11,992 --> 00:34:15,594
that they'll still
let you be mayor?

539
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:18,330
Why not?

540
00:34:18,332 --> 00:34:19,565
No one knows that
I've done anything

541
00:34:19,567 --> 00:34:21,200
except try
to save this city.

542
00:34:21,202 --> 00:34:23,802
And if you tell anyone
about my mask,

543
00:34:23,804 --> 00:34:26,372
I will tell them about yours.

544
00:34:26,374 --> 00:34:29,341
Do what you have to,
Sebastian.

545
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,618
I got to get back to it.

546
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,688
Hey.
Are you guys ok?

547
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,723
Yeah.
Are you ok?

548
00:34:44,725 --> 00:34:46,725
You wouldn't believe it--
a blonde in a mask

549
00:34:46,727 --> 00:34:49,661
ran out of a burning
building with a kid in her arms.

550
00:34:49,663 --> 00:34:51,132
It was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

551
00:34:51,157 --> 00:34:52,790
That woman's a hero.

552
00:35:08,214 --> 00:35:10,449
You gave it to him,
didn't you?

553
00:35:11,584 --> 00:35:15,254
I did what I thought
was necessary.

554
00:35:16,756 --> 00:35:19,425
Don't worry,
I'll tell Slade.

555
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,963
Does he still have the cure?

556
00:35:24,965 --> 00:35:27,266
No.

557
00:35:27,268 --> 00:35:29,301
Slade, you betrayed--

558
00:35:29,303 --> 00:35:31,003
Good-bye,
Mr. Blood.

559
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:37,876
I loved this city.

560
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:05,716
Why does every secret formula
have to be a color?

561
00:36:05,717 --> 00:36:07,750
Whatever happened to good,
old-fashioned clear?

562
00:36:07,752 --> 00:36:10,320
All right, so if we inject one
of Slade's soldiers with this...

563
00:36:10,322 --> 00:36:11,587
According
to S.T.A.R. Labs,

564
00:36:11,589 --> 00:36:12,956
it will counteract
the effects.

565
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:14,891
Assuming they got
the recipe right.

566
00:36:23,267 --> 00:36:24,767
We need to test it.

567
00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:25,935
We can't.

568
00:36:25,937 --> 00:36:27,503
Treat Roy like
some kind of lab rat?

569
00:36:27,505 --> 00:36:28,538
Felicity...

570
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,639
What if it doesn't work?

571
00:36:29,641 --> 00:36:30,773
What if it kills him?

572
00:36:30,775 --> 00:36:32,008
What if he wakes up
and kills us?

573
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:35,511
We need to know.
One way or the other.

574
00:36:46,924 --> 00:36:49,192
Go lock
the other door.

575
00:36:49,194 --> 00:36:50,960
Ok.

576
00:36:58,469 --> 00:37:00,470
Sara, where does Ivo
keep his safe?

577
00:37:00,472 --> 00:37:02,372
It's, uh,
by his books.

578
00:37:10,347 --> 00:37:13,049
Oliver...

579
00:37:24,461 --> 00:37:26,408
What are you
looking for, kid?

580
00:37:27,782 --> 00:37:29,220
This?

581
00:37:34,733 --> 00:37:36,294
A whole area
of the country...

582
00:37:36,465 --> 00:37:39,033
Detective Lance.

583
00:37:39,035 --> 00:37:41,669
Yeah?

584
00:37:41,671 --> 00:37:44,071
What's going on?

585
00:37:46,007 --> 00:37:47,474
What is it?

586
00:37:47,476 --> 00:37:49,743
You're watching live footage
of an army convoy

587
00:37:49,745 --> 00:37:52,872
arriving on the outskirts
of the city to restore order.

588
00:37:52,873 --> 00:37:55,007
Looks like the cavalry's
here, finally.

589
00:37:55,009 --> 00:37:58,043
Maybe.
What do you mean?

590
00:37:58,045 --> 00:38:01,346
Well, they're taking up positions in
the bridges and tunnels.

591
00:38:01,348 --> 00:38:03,282
Well, those are
the only ways into the city.

592
00:38:03,284 --> 00:38:04,783
Yeah,
and the only ways out.

593
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:07,853
A buddy of mine
in military intelligence

594
00:38:07,855 --> 00:38:09,688
once told me the army
isn't always the army.

595
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,356
But it's clearly
the military.

596
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:13,392
The trucks,
the uniforms.

597
00:38:13,394 --> 00:38:14,660
Except the nearest army base
is at Monument Point,

598
00:38:14,662 --> 00:38:16,194
which is 300 miles from here.

599
00:38:16,196 --> 00:38:18,931
So how could they mobilize
to Starling City so fast?

600
00:38:18,933 --> 00:38:21,600
Ok. So if that
isn't the army,

601
00:38:21,602 --> 00:38:23,969
who the hell are they?

602
00:38:44,153 --> 00:38:47,522
I'm sorry.

603
00:38:59,287 --> 00:39:03,356
I can't.

604
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,214
It's Lance. Detective.

605
00:39:09,216 --> 00:39:11,183
Are you near him?
Yes.

606
00:39:11,185 --> 00:39:13,152
Are you near a TV?
Yes.

607
00:39:13,154 --> 00:39:15,220
Turn it on.

608
00:39:19,225 --> 00:39:22,928
You're watching
live footage of an army convoy

609
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:26,899
arriving on the outskirts
of the city to restore order.

610
00:39:33,073 --> 00:39:34,440
How did you
get this number?

611
00:39:34,442 --> 00:39:36,208
Amanda.
What are you doing?

612
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,977
I'm not sure what you mean.

613
00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:41,113
Amanda, the troops taking up position
at the city's exits--

614
00:39:41,115 --> 00:39:42,881
they're not army,
they're A.R.G.U.S.

615
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:45,517
Those are your men.
So you tell me what you're up to.

616
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,687
Amanda!

617
00:39:48,689 --> 00:39:50,389
Slade's followers
are a clear

618
00:39:50,391 --> 00:39:53,025
and present danger.
I cannot allow them

619
00:39:53,027 --> 00:39:55,260
to escape the city.
They need to be contained...

620
00:39:55,262 --> 00:39:57,763
By any means necessary.

621
00:39:58,832 --> 00:39:59,798
You can't.

622
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,066
They're a drone
en route

623
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:04,036
carrying six
GBU/43-B bombs,

624
00:40:04,038 --> 00:40:06,038
enough fire power
to level the city.

625
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,608
There are over half
a million people in this city.

626
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,744
576,000.

627
00:40:11,746 --> 00:40:13,879
None of whom
deserve to die.

628
00:40:13,881 --> 00:40:16,215
But I have to think
about the people in every city.

629
00:40:16,217 --> 00:40:20,612
You once told me that Mirakuru
made a man virtually unstoppable.

630
00:40:20,655 --> 00:40:22,788
What could happen
to this country,

631
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,790
this world,

632
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:27,493
if I don't end this
here and now?

633
00:40:27,495 --> 00:40:29,261
Listen to me.

634
00:40:29,263 --> 00:40:31,497
I have the cure.

635
00:40:31,499 --> 00:40:34,566
I can stop Slade
and his men.

636
00:40:34,568 --> 00:40:38,904
I can't take the chance
you'll fail, Oliver.

637
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,441
Amanda, I just
need more time.

638
00:40:42,443 --> 00:40:44,710
I'm sorry.

639
00:40:44,712 --> 00:40:46,945
You have until dawn.

640
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:48,881
And then Starling City
is a crater.

641
00:41:12,706 --> 00:41:14,807
If you're going
to use that,

642
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:17,309
you'll want to click
the safety off.

643
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:22,648
I'll shoot you.

644
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,016
I will!

645
00:41:24,018 --> 00:41:26,518
I can see it
in your eyes.

646
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,787
My eyes.

647
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:32,157
They're just
like mine.

648
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:35,527
Both of them filled
with pain and anger,

649
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:38,797
because those we loved were
ripped from us.

650
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:42,167
I lost my name,
my wife...

651
00:41:42,169 --> 00:41:44,603
Tommy.
