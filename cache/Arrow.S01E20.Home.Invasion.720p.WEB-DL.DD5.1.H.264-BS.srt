1
00:00:01,234 --> 00:00:03,182
My name is
Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,313 --> 00:00:05,864
For five years, I was
stranded on an island,

3
00:00:05,866 --> 00:00:08,200
with only one goal:

4
00:00:08,202 --> 00:00:09,451
Survive.

5
00:00:09,453 --> 00:00:11,269
Oliver Queen is alive.

6
00:00:11,271 --> 00:00:13,488
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

7
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,957
to use the list
of names he left me,

8
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:18,960
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

9
00:00:18,962 --> 00:00:21,630
To do this, I must
become someone else.

10
00:00:21,632 --> 00:00:25,717
I must become something else.

11
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:26,985
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

12
00:00:26,987 --> 00:00:28,336
So you met up
with the Hood guy?

13
00:00:28,338 --> 00:00:31,022
He's contacted me before.

14
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,176
You're a murderer.

15
00:00:34,178 --> 00:00:35,944
You were my best
friend in life,

16
00:00:35,946 --> 00:00:38,313
but now it's like I don't
even know you.

17
00:00:38,315 --> 00:00:39,514
I quit.

18
00:00:39,516 --> 00:00:41,683
Listen, Lyla, Lawton
is a very dangerous man.

19
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:42,768
What do you
know about him?

20
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,186
That's everything
you need to locate

21
00:00:44,188 --> 00:00:46,154
who's giving
Deadshot his targets.

22
00:00:46,156 --> 00:00:47,972
This Lawton kick
his dog or something?

23
00:00:47,974 --> 00:00:49,474
He killed his brother.

24
00:00:49,476 --> 00:00:51,159
I can't move on with my life

25
00:00:51,161 --> 00:00:52,544
knowing that he's
still out there.

26
00:00:52,546 --> 00:00:54,329
I thought if anybody
got that it'd be you.

27
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:56,581
You two have
unfinished business.

28
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,667
Where do we start?

29
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:03,922
You feel better?

30
00:01:03,924 --> 00:01:06,041
I'll feel better
once we end Deadshot.

31
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:17,302
Welcome to Germany,
Mr. Ambassador.

32
00:01:17,304 --> 00:01:18,854
Henrik, you're looking great.

33
00:01:30,199 --> 00:01:32,114
We have to end this guy
before he makes any

34
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:34,139
more widows out of wives.

35
00:01:46,198 --> 00:01:48,383
We will.

36
00:01:48,385 --> 00:01:50,335
Diggle, we'll stop him.

37
00:01:50,337 --> 00:01:52,003
I promised you I'd
help take him down,

38
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:53,171
and I keep my promises,

39
00:01:53,173 --> 00:01:55,173
but he's on
another continent.

40
00:01:55,175 --> 00:01:57,041
Not anymore.

41
00:01:58,561 --> 00:01:59,878
I thought it would
be helpful to track

42
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,547
A.R.G.U.S' manhunt for
Floyd Lawton aka Deadshot,

43
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:05,383
so I decrypted their
communication logs.

44
00:02:05,385 --> 00:02:08,603
Which means, I just
hacked a federal agency.

45
00:02:08,605 --> 00:02:10,438
Which kind of makes
me a cyber-terrorist,

46
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,190
which is bad because
I really don't see myself

47
00:02:12,192 --> 00:02:13,658
fitting in well
at Guantanamo Bay.

48
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,060
Don't worry, Felicity,
they don't send blondes there.

49
00:02:16,062 --> 00:02:17,529
I dye it, actually.

50
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:19,281
- I keep your secret...
- Hey, what'd you find?

51
00:02:19,283 --> 00:02:21,600
Deadshot is
scheduled to meet

52
00:02:21,602 --> 00:02:23,952
with a potential new client
here in Starling City.

53
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:26,838
Except the potential
contract is bogus.

54
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,596
Your friend Lyla is
setting a trap for him.

55
00:02:28,621 --> 00:02:30,209
Lawton took the bait.

56
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,828
Great, I'll talk to Lyla, see
if I can suss out any details.

57
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,029
Good.

58
00:02:34,031 --> 00:02:36,848
I've got to have
lunch with Laurel.

59
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,467
So when did you become,
uh, lunch dates with Laurel?

60
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:42,487
Look, we're just...

61
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:44,306
We're friends.

62
00:02:44,308 --> 00:02:47,225
- Friends are good.
- But?

63
00:02:47,227 --> 00:02:50,529
Couldn't you be friends with
someone less complicated

64
00:02:50,531 --> 00:02:53,031
than your ex-girlfriend,
who's your ex-best friend's

65
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:54,883
current girlfriend?

66
00:02:54,885 --> 00:02:56,735
I wear a hood and I put
arrows into criminals,

67
00:02:56,737 --> 00:02:59,270
so when it comes
to complexity...

68
00:02:59,272 --> 00:03:02,106
I grade on a curve.

69
00:03:06,779 --> 00:03:09,497
Rescuing your father
and stopping Fyers

70
00:03:09,499 --> 00:03:11,666
is not going to be
some walk in the park.

71
00:03:11,668 --> 00:03:14,386
They're not going to allow us
to just stroll on into their camp.

72
00:03:14,388 --> 00:03:16,788
Which is why
we'll need cover.

73
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,091
If both of us are infiltrating,
who'll provide that?

74
00:03:20,093 --> 00:03:21,593
He will.

75
00:03:22,845 --> 00:03:24,095
Me?

76
00:03:24,097 --> 00:03:27,732
The assault
rifle is flushed.

77
00:03:27,734 --> 00:03:28,850
It's useless.

78
00:03:28,852 --> 00:03:31,686
We have a bow,
arrows.

79
00:03:31,688 --> 00:03:33,438
And no one capable
of shooting them.

80
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,639
No offense, kid.

81
00:03:34,641 --> 00:03:36,491
I was going to say
the same thing.

82
00:03:38,811 --> 00:03:42,247
I think we should be spending
our time trying to devise a plan,

83
00:03:42,249 --> 00:03:45,149
not lower our already
slim chances of survival.

84
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:49,671
He'll hit his mark by sundown.
If not, we'll do it your way.

85
00:03:53,342 --> 00:03:55,594
Lyla!

86
00:03:55,596 --> 00:03:57,012
What is it, Johnnie?

87
00:03:57,014 --> 00:03:58,463
Just came by to see
how things were going

88
00:03:58,465 --> 00:04:00,265
on your Deadshot investigation.
Anything new come up?

89
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:01,433
Funnily enough,
it did.

90
00:04:01,435 --> 00:04:03,685
I was curious why
you, a bodyguard,

91
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:06,671
were so keen on taking down
such a high profile assassin,

92
00:04:06,673 --> 00:04:08,506
so I did some
reading up on Lawton.

93
00:04:08,508 --> 00:04:09,641
Lyla, listen...

94
00:04:09,643 --> 00:04:12,394
Did you really think I wouldn't find out
that he killed your brother?

95
00:04:12,396 --> 00:04:14,029
That you were
using me--me!

96
00:04:14,031 --> 00:04:16,531
To what? Draw him
into the open

97
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:18,650
so you could take
him down yourself?

98
00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:21,987
I will not let you use my agency
to settle your blood feud.

99
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:23,822
Lyla...

100
00:04:23,824 --> 00:04:25,740
I need to see
this guy in a bag.

101
00:04:25,742 --> 00:04:27,492
You of all people
should get that.

102
00:04:27,494 --> 00:04:29,694
Get this--stay away
from Lawton, Johnnie,

103
00:04:29,696 --> 00:04:31,863
or so help me, I will
have you arrested.

104
00:04:31,865 --> 00:04:34,466
You doubt me?

105
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:38,136
Never have.

106
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:55,887
- Hi.
- Did you get my voicemail?

107
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:57,022
No.

108
00:04:57,024 --> 00:05:00,258
Things got a little crazy around here--
back to back meetings...

109
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,161
- I am so sorry, rain check?
- Sure.

110
00:05:03,163 --> 00:05:05,580
I could definitely catch up
on some club paperwork.

111
00:05:05,582 --> 00:05:07,532
We're way behind
since Tommy left.

112
00:05:07,534 --> 00:05:10,118
I'm still shocked that he
went to go work for Malcolm.

113
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,170
You know, you were
really understanding

114
00:05:12,172 --> 00:05:13,538
to let him take
this opportunity.

115
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,290
Tommy said
you were cool with it.

116
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:17,676
Why wouldn't I be?
He's my friend. Like you.

117
00:05:17,678 --> 00:05:19,410
I'm sorry,
are we early?

118
00:05:19,412 --> 00:05:21,796
No, not at all.

119
00:05:21,798 --> 00:05:24,883
Uh, Oliver, this is Eric Moore
and his wife, Nancy.

120
00:05:24,885 --> 00:05:26,918
I'm prepping them
for a deposition for tomorrow.

121
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,889
And this must be
your bodyguard?

122
00:05:30,891 --> 00:05:33,091
This is our son, Taylor.

123
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:34,476
Well, you are in
very capable hands.

124
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:36,528
It was nice to meet you.

125
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,197
Eric, Nancy,

126
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,901
I want to make sure that
you guys are up for this.

127
00:05:42,903 --> 00:05:45,770
Edward Rasmus isn't known
for playing with kid gloves,

128
00:05:45,772 --> 00:05:47,539
so this could get rough.

129
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,625
We invested our entire life savings
with Rasmus and he stole it.

130
00:05:50,627 --> 00:05:51,943
Our retirement.

131
00:05:51,945 --> 00:05:53,578
Taylor's college fund.

132
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,081
He stole our future, Ms. Lance.

133
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,049
We want it back.

134
00:05:58,051 --> 00:05:59,884
Well, then
let's go get it.

135
00:06:07,293 --> 00:06:08,960
Hello?

136
00:06:08,962 --> 00:06:11,946
Mr. Moore? I have some
documents for you from Ms. Lance

137
00:06:11,948 --> 00:06:13,932
related to tomorrow's
deposition.

138
00:06:18,904 --> 00:06:22,107
What a nice home
you have here.

139
00:06:22,109 --> 00:06:25,026
You can really...

140
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:26,444
Feel the love.

141
00:06:34,503 --> 00:06:37,088
Sorry about the mess.

142
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:41,092
This works better
if it looks like a break-in.

143
00:06:50,386 --> 00:06:52,554
Ah!

144
00:07:15,911 --> 00:07:18,513
- Is it done?
- <i>The parents, yes.</i>

145
00:07:18,515 --> 00:07:21,466
I'm afraid there's been a variable.
The child got away.

146
00:07:21,468 --> 00:07:22,867
Got away?

147
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:24,586
Did he see you?

148
00:07:24,588 --> 00:07:26,137
No, Mr. Rasmus.

149
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:27,772
What he saw was
the face of the man

150
00:07:27,774 --> 00:07:30,892
who will reunite him
with his parents.

151
00:07:36,682 --> 00:07:38,149
Starling City
is expected to be host

152
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:39,684
of this year's Festival
of Lights exhibition.

153
00:07:39,686 --> 00:07:42,770
In other news, the bodies
of Mr. and Mrs. Moore

154
00:07:42,772 --> 00:07:44,722
were found early this morning.

155
00:07:44,724 --> 00:07:46,157
The couple were
being represented

156
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:48,576
by attorney Laurel Lance of CNRI

157
00:07:48,578 --> 00:07:52,447
in a lawsuit against
financier Edward Rasmus.

158
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:55,416
Miraculously, their
seven-year-old son Taylor

159
00:07:55,418 --> 00:07:58,119
survived the horrific attack.

160
00:07:58,727 --> 00:08:02,727
<font color=#00FF00>1x20
Home Invasion</font>

162
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:10,064
This isn't your fault, Laurel,
you shouldn't feel guilty.

163
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:12,550
I don't feel guilty.
I'm angry.

164
00:08:12,552 --> 00:08:14,719
This wasn't some
random break-in.

165
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:16,721
Edward Rasmus is
involved, I know it.

166
00:08:16,723 --> 00:08:18,573
Ok, listen, our guys
are looking into this.

167
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:19,907
But you need
to stay out of it, ok?

168
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:23,277
Because if Rasmus is behind this,
he's clearly not messing around.

169
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:25,029
Uh...

170
00:08:25,031 --> 00:08:27,031
If you'd like to say
good-bye to Taylor,

171
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:29,667
I will be taking him
over to child services.

172
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:31,285
Doesn't he have
any other family?

173
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:33,371
Grandparents
are in Melbourne.

174
00:08:33,373 --> 00:08:35,289
We're tracking them
down, but until then,

175
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,059
he's going to be a temporary ward
of the state.

176
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:40,878
He can stay with me.

177
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,965
As his attorney,
I am assigning myself

178
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:46,100
temporary guardianship.

179
00:08:46,102 --> 00:08:49,353
- You'd still need a judge's order.
- I'll have it to you in an hour.

180
00:08:49,355 --> 00:08:52,640
Well, have it your way.

181
00:08:52,642 --> 00:08:55,010
Ok, look, I'm going
to park a patrol car

182
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,195
outside your place.

183
00:08:56,196 --> 00:08:58,246
- Fine.
- And you...

184
00:08:58,248 --> 00:08:59,947
You look after
them, all right?

185
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:02,717
I spend most nights at
your daughter's anyways.

186
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,403
There was probably
a better time to tell you that.

187
00:09:05,405 --> 00:09:07,655
Probably not.

188
00:09:09,825 --> 00:09:13,661
Hey, come stay
in my house, ok?

189
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,714
- What are you doing here?
- I heard what happened,

190
00:09:16,716 --> 00:09:18,883
I just wanted to make sure
Laurel was ok.

191
00:09:18,885 --> 00:09:20,635
You could have
just called.

192
00:09:20,637 --> 00:09:24,322
I met Laurel's clients and their
son yesterday and I felt badly.

193
00:09:24,324 --> 00:09:26,123
You met them?

194
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:29,126
Yeah, when I was picking
up Laurel for lunch...

195
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,798
Which she didn't tell you about.

196
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,966
Tell you what?

197
00:09:35,968 --> 00:09:37,401
Nothing.

198
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:39,303
It's settled.

199
00:09:39,305 --> 00:09:41,906
Taylor's coming
home with us tonight.

200
00:09:41,908 --> 00:09:43,308
Well,
if you need anything--

201
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:44,975
- we're fine.
- Ok.

202
00:09:44,977 --> 00:09:46,811
We should really
get going.

203
00:09:46,813 --> 00:09:48,613
Here.

204
00:09:56,655 --> 00:09:58,989
Set your sight.

205
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,811
Hit the tree.

206
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:10,651
Probably hit a tree.

207
00:10:12,354 --> 00:10:15,673
Set your sight.

208
00:10:15,675 --> 00:10:18,609
Hit the tree.

209
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:23,981
Steady your anchor point.

210
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:36,026
I hope
you're getting closer...

211
00:10:36,028 --> 00:10:38,212
At teaching him how
to be a better marksman.

212
00:10:38,214 --> 00:10:41,415
It's not as though our lives
depend on it or anything.

213
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:46,053
- Try again.
- Ok.

214
00:10:50,425 --> 00:10:52,009
What's this?

215
00:10:52,011 --> 00:10:54,095
Lyla's mission
profile on the trap

216
00:10:54,097 --> 00:10:55,396
they've set
for Deadshot.

217
00:10:55,398 --> 00:10:57,181
Lawton is set
to meet his new employer

218
00:10:57,183 --> 00:10:59,400
and get his assignment
tomorrow at 8 pm.

219
00:10:59,402 --> 00:11:02,019
Only, his
new employer...

220
00:11:02,021 --> 00:11:04,071
Will be an
A.R.G.U.S. agent.

221
00:11:04,073 --> 00:11:06,357
Lyla will then
swoop in with her team

222
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:09,777
and arrest him.

223
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:12,663
Do you want
Lawton arrested?

224
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:19,954
No.

225
00:11:19,956 --> 00:11:23,741
Then tomorrow night, we cross
Floyd Lawton's name off your list.

226
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:29,797
There is something else
we need to look into.

227
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,182
Two of Laurel's clients
were murdered last night.

228
00:11:31,184 --> 00:11:32,934
Their seven-year-old
son barely escaped.

229
00:11:32,936 --> 00:11:34,468
That's terrible.

230
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,370
Edward Rasmus,

231
00:11:36,372 --> 00:11:38,589
the financial advisor
Laurel was taking to court,

232
00:11:38,591 --> 00:11:41,192
may not have pulled the trigger,
but he probably called in the hit.

233
00:11:41,194 --> 00:11:44,295
I want you to get into
his corporate accounts,

234
00:11:44,297 --> 00:11:47,198
phone records, anything that
may link him to the killer, ok?

235
00:11:49,151 --> 00:11:51,702
Where
are you going?

236
00:11:51,704 --> 00:11:53,571
Laurel's.

237
00:11:53,573 --> 00:11:55,289
Another friendly meal?

238
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:57,608
My daughter is
secure at her place?

239
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,960
So far, all quiet...

240
00:11:58,962 --> 00:12:02,246
All right, let me know
if there is any movement.

241
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:04,916
I'm heading over there
right now.

242
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:06,884
What did you steal this time?

243
00:12:06,886 --> 00:12:08,719
- You got a minute?
- No.

244
00:12:08,721 --> 00:12:12,006
It's about the Hood.

245
00:12:12,008 --> 00:12:14,463
When my men found you
on that subway car

246
00:12:14,488 --> 00:12:15,460
after you were kidnapped,

247
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:17,678
you told them you didn't know
anything about the vigilante.

248
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,313
So there's something
you forgot to tell them?

249
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:20,865
No.

250
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:22,299
I just want to see
him brought

251
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:24,318
to justice like
everyone else.

252
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,070
Don't worry, kid.
We'll get him.

253
00:12:26,072 --> 00:12:29,357
Just keep making sure
I don't have a reason to get you.

254
00:12:33,912 --> 00:12:36,981
Taylor?
Sweetheart?

255
00:12:36,983 --> 00:12:38,749
Are you hungry?

256
00:12:38,751 --> 00:12:40,885
You know, I make
the world's best

257
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:43,004
macaroni and cheese.

258
00:12:43,006 --> 00:12:46,407
It's the only thing
she knows how to make.

259
00:12:46,409 --> 00:12:49,110
I miss my mom and dad.

260
00:12:59,805 --> 00:13:02,306
When I was your age,

261
00:13:02,308 --> 00:13:04,458
my mom tucked me into bed

262
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,961
that night before going out.

263
00:13:06,963 --> 00:13:08,746
Then the next thing I knew,

264
00:13:08,748 --> 00:13:11,816
there was a police officer
at my door.

265
00:13:11,818 --> 00:13:15,036
He said that she was gone

266
00:13:15,038 --> 00:13:19,373
and that I would never see her again.
But you know what?

267
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,125
He was wrong.

268
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:23,077
- You saw her?
- Mh-mmm.

269
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:27,081
Every time I close
my eyes, I can see her.

270
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:29,033
Every time I go to bed,

271
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:31,385
I see her in my dreams.

272
00:13:31,387 --> 00:13:33,387
Really?

273
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:35,539
Yeah.

274
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,708
Now try it,
close your eyes.

275
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,365
I see them.

276
00:13:49,021 --> 00:13:51,422
Whenever you are sad,

277
00:13:51,424 --> 00:13:53,691
or scared,

278
00:13:53,693 --> 00:13:58,029
just remember that
they will always be there.

279
00:14:00,832 --> 00:14:03,317
You constantly
surprise me, Merlyn.

280
00:14:06,873 --> 00:14:08,155
I'll get it.

281
00:14:08,157 --> 00:14:10,925
Ms. Lance?

282
00:14:10,927 --> 00:14:13,461
Lieutenant Kessel, SCPD.

283
00:14:13,463 --> 00:14:16,246
Your dad asked me
to check in.

284
00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:19,884
Lieutenant, can you hold your
badge up to the door, please?

285
00:14:25,924 --> 00:14:27,892
Ok, great.

286
00:14:27,894 --> 00:14:30,594
Just one sec.

287
00:14:30,596 --> 00:14:31,979
What?

288
00:14:31,981 --> 00:14:33,364
His badge number
begins with a zero,

289
00:14:33,366 --> 00:14:34,482
Lieutenant's badge
numbers begin with a one--

290
00:15:13,438 --> 00:15:17,641
It was the badge that
gave me away, right?

291
00:15:17,643 --> 00:15:20,144
You know,
my father's a cop.

292
00:15:22,447 --> 00:15:24,648
And that's not
all he taught me.

293
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:00,917
I'm feeling like it might
be time for you to move.

294
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,427
Dad, whoever Rasmus hired

295
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:05,811
is going to keep coming until
he finishes the job,

296
00:16:05,813 --> 00:16:08,431
otherwise Rasmus will just
hire someone else who will.

297
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:11,067
Ok, listen,
I want the three of you

298
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:13,402
in protective custody immediately,
and don't even think about it.

299
00:16:13,404 --> 00:16:15,237
He killed two of my men.

300
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:17,156
The Hood just
saved our lives.

301
00:16:17,158 --> 00:16:19,525
We can trust him.

302
00:16:19,527 --> 00:16:21,193
He won't let
anything happen to me.

303
00:16:21,195 --> 00:16:22,611
Even if I was comfortable

304
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:26,365
with the idea of him watching
over you 24/7, which I'm not,

305
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,185
something tells me he's
got better things to do.

306
00:16:29,187 --> 00:16:31,687
What about Oliver?

307
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:33,222
Sorry, you got another
friend named Oliver?

308
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:35,324
The Queens have more
security than the President.

309
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:38,544
They've got cameras everywhere,
bodyguards in every wing,

310
00:16:38,546 --> 00:16:42,348
and no one goes in or out
without being accounted for.

311
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,917
We both only want
what is best for Laurel.

312
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:48,154
And right now that is
to stay close to Oliver.

313
00:16:48,156 --> 00:16:49,522
Trust me.

314
00:17:03,103 --> 00:17:05,104
This is Mr. Robbins.

315
00:17:05,106 --> 00:17:07,957
Where you go, he goes.

316
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:09,792
You'll be very well
protected, Ms. Lance.

317
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:10,776
Thank you.

318
00:17:10,778 --> 00:17:12,078
I hand-selected
these men myself.

319
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,213
The house and the grounds
are completely secure.

320
00:17:14,215 --> 00:17:16,615
Please make
yourself at home.

321
00:17:16,617 --> 00:17:18,718
You must be Taylor.

322
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,587
How about I show you where
I hide the good cookies?

323
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:23,789
Ok?

324
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:27,259
Mr. Queen, whenever
you're ready,

325
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:30,062
I can take you to your next
appointment, sir.

326
00:17:30,064 --> 00:17:32,648
- The Lawton meeting?
- Yes.

327
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,301
I just need to swing by the
club and pick up my good suit.

328
00:17:36,303 --> 00:17:39,272
- So, I'll meet you there.
- Of course, sir.

329
00:17:39,674 --> 00:17:41,741
You're leaving?

330
00:17:41,743 --> 00:17:44,226
There's something else I need
to take care of. It's important.

331
00:17:44,228 --> 00:17:46,078
More important than
what's going on here?

332
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,980
No offense to Oliver,
but I think we need

333
00:17:47,982 --> 00:17:50,783
Mr. Robbins and his men
more than him.

334
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:58,207
You are the reason
why we're here,

335
00:17:58,209 --> 00:18:00,543
and trust me,
that wasn't easy to admit.

336
00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:02,094
You'll be fine.

337
00:18:02,096 --> 00:18:04,046
I promise.

338
00:18:17,477 --> 00:18:19,445
You know, chewing might help.

339
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:22,347
Hmm. Not dainty
enough for you?

340
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:25,534
I could eat you under
the table, Roy Harper.

341
00:18:25,536 --> 00:18:27,186
Don't forget that.

342
00:18:27,188 --> 00:18:29,989
All units,
code 10-80.

343
00:18:29,991 --> 00:18:31,657
Starling City port,
10-80...

344
00:18:31,659 --> 00:18:32,992
What is that?

345
00:18:32,994 --> 00:18:34,743
Suspected
vigilante activity,

346
00:18:34,745 --> 00:18:36,195
requesting
all available units.

347
00:18:36,197 --> 00:18:38,547
Do you have a police
radio in your pocket?

348
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:40,633
No, I'm just
happy to see you.

349
00:18:40,635 --> 00:18:42,001
Got to run.

350
00:19:06,893 --> 00:19:10,329
I think you've got something
that belongs to me.

351
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:12,731
You set this up,
just to get your radio back?

352
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:14,399
Well...

353
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:15,701
I do love that radio.

354
00:19:15,703 --> 00:19:18,120
Come on.

355
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,707
I'm uploading
a satellite overview

356
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:22,925
of the Plaza
to your phone...

357
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:24,210
Thanks,
but I know the place--

358
00:19:24,212 --> 00:19:26,295
Dig was pretty specific
about where you should perch--

359
00:19:26,297 --> 00:19:28,097
you know,

360
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:30,216
what position gives you
the best shot at Lawton.

361
00:19:30,218 --> 00:19:31,800
I think.

362
00:19:31,802 --> 00:19:33,919
He used a lot
of military jargon.

363
00:19:33,921 --> 00:19:35,971
So you're sniping a sniper.

364
00:19:35,973 --> 00:19:38,274
Kind of ironic, don't you think?

365
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:41,760
Me neither.

366
00:19:41,762 --> 00:19:43,028
What's that?

367
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,763
I had a remote access trojan

368
00:19:44,765 --> 00:19:46,732
scouring the Internet
for Edward Rasmus.

369
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:48,600
His name just popped up
on a flight manifest,

370
00:19:48,602 --> 00:19:50,269
8:15 to Shanghai...
He's running.

371
00:19:50,271 --> 00:19:52,104
That's good, right?

372
00:19:52,106 --> 00:19:55,357
If he's leaving town, he won't be
after Laurel and the child anymore.

373
00:19:57,327 --> 00:20:00,296
But if you did
want to stop him,

374
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:02,715
looks like
it's now or never.

375
00:20:02,717 --> 00:20:05,634
Deadshot or Rasmus...
Your choice.

376
00:20:25,822 --> 00:20:27,973
Trap one,
this is Harbinger.

377
00:20:27,975 --> 00:20:29,808
Wait for Lawton
to enter and make contact.

378
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,744
Then we'll
take him down.

379
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,664
Damn it, Oliver...

380
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:59,555
...Just until
this CNRI mess dies down.

381
00:20:59,557 --> 00:21:01,774
And if it doesn't,
two best things about China--

382
00:21:01,776 --> 00:21:03,675
wontons and no
extradition treaty.

383
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,312
Hey, hey, I thought
I was paying you extra

384
00:21:06,314 --> 00:21:07,980
not to stop at the reds.

385
00:21:26,983 --> 00:21:30,035
Trap one, possible
target acquisition.

386
00:21:34,641 --> 00:21:36,592
Get ready.

387
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:47,987
Stand down.

388
00:21:50,056 --> 00:21:53,058
Maybe Lawton didn't
take the bait after all.

389
00:22:11,911 --> 00:22:14,246
We're blown! Take cover!

390
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,884
On your knees.
On your knees.

391
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,456
Hands behind your head.

392
00:22:57,458 --> 00:23:00,259
I saw you coming a mile away.

393
00:23:00,261 --> 00:23:02,261
Thanks for tipping me off.

394
00:23:02,263 --> 00:23:04,463
I'll kill you for what
you did to Andy.

395
00:23:04,465 --> 00:23:05,914
I'd be pulling
these triggers right now,

396
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,632
except there's
nobody paying me.

397
00:23:10,403 --> 00:23:13,405
There's space
for you right here,

398
00:23:13,407 --> 00:23:15,157
right next to your brother.

399
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:18,610
You'd do best to remember that.

400
00:23:37,746 --> 00:23:39,479
What happened?

401
00:23:39,481 --> 00:23:43,584
You didn't show,
things didn't go well.

402
00:23:43,586 --> 00:23:45,953
Rasmus was
skipping town...

403
00:23:45,955 --> 00:23:47,671
And I had to
reprioritize.

404
00:23:47,673 --> 00:23:50,858
Thanks to your new priorities
four agents are dead, Oliver.

405
00:23:52,493 --> 00:23:56,830
You could have stopped this guy,
ended this maniac once and for all.

406
00:23:56,832 --> 00:23:58,715
Lawton got away?

407
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:03,353
You seriously think a man who
goes by the name "Deadshot"

408
00:24:03,355 --> 00:24:05,389
was going down without a fight?

409
00:24:05,391 --> 00:24:06,857
I needed you there, man.

410
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:08,392
Taylor Moore was
relying on me, Diggle.

411
00:24:08,394 --> 00:24:09,693
But this was
never about that kid,

412
00:24:09,695 --> 00:24:13,230
he is safe under armed
security at your house.

413
00:24:13,232 --> 00:24:15,879
- This is about Laurel.
- Diggle,

414
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,485
- I made a choice.
- I know.

415
00:24:18,487 --> 00:24:20,320
You chose Laurel.

416
00:24:20,322 --> 00:24:23,023
Always her.

417
00:24:23,025 --> 00:24:25,509
Everybody else
be damned.

418
00:24:35,136 --> 00:24:37,721
Something to say, Felicity?

419
00:24:37,723 --> 00:24:40,207
Nothing you
want to hear.

420
00:24:49,684 --> 00:24:52,319
Try again.

421
00:24:58,109 --> 00:25:00,027
You're thinking too much.

422
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:02,913
Nobody ever accused
me of that before.

423
00:25:11,623 --> 00:25:12,840
Show-off.

424
00:25:12,842 --> 00:25:16,043
I see my target
in the distance,

425
00:25:16,045 --> 00:25:19,079
I feel the variation
in the wind,

426
00:25:19,081 --> 00:25:21,932
I hear the bowstring tighten...

427
00:25:21,934 --> 00:25:23,300
And I let go.

428
00:25:24,886 --> 00:25:26,753
Give in to your senses...

429
00:25:26,755 --> 00:25:28,972
Don't think.

430
00:25:48,376 --> 00:25:50,210
You're right,

431
00:25:50,212 --> 00:25:51,778
this is definitively
not the time or place...

432
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,748
No, it's--no,
it's just there's, uh...

433
00:25:56,217 --> 00:25:58,085
Someone.

434
00:25:58,087 --> 00:26:00,888
And it's a mile
past complicated,

435
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,506
but I can't.

436
00:26:02,508 --> 00:26:05,142
Does she know
how much you love her?

437
00:26:06,761 --> 00:26:10,931
I suspect right
now she doesn't.

438
00:26:12,133 --> 00:26:15,586
But as soon as
I'm home, she will.

439
00:26:17,772 --> 00:26:22,142
You looked
so beautiful that night.

440
00:26:23,444 --> 00:26:26,196
I remember Oliver
telling me once

441
00:26:26,198 --> 00:26:28,782
that he wished
your father

442
00:26:28,784 --> 00:26:31,168
would let him come over
to your house more often.

443
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,920
That being there

444
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:34,922
made him feel less
like Robert Queen's son

445
00:26:34,924 --> 00:26:37,958
and more like himself.

446
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,761
I liked who my son was
when he was around you.

447
00:26:40,763 --> 00:26:43,513
Thank you.

448
00:26:43,515 --> 00:26:45,832
Hey.

449
00:26:45,834 --> 00:26:47,500
The police just called.

450
00:26:47,502 --> 00:26:49,502
Edward Rasmus
was arrested.

451
00:26:50,605 --> 00:26:53,390
Really? What happened?

452
00:26:53,392 --> 00:26:56,059
Apparently he confessed
to everything.

453
00:26:56,061 --> 00:26:57,778
He's going to go to prison
for a long time

454
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,363
and won't be able
to hurt anyone ever again.

455
00:26:59,365 --> 00:27:00,897
Why would he confess?

456
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:05,319
The vigilante
was involved.

457
00:27:05,321 --> 00:27:06,737
Good for him.

458
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,208
So, I guess it's over.

459
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,210
Yes... Yeah.

460
00:27:13,212 --> 00:27:14,294
Great, I'll go
wake up Taylor--

461
00:27:14,296 --> 00:27:15,963
No, Tommy, please.

462
00:27:15,965 --> 00:27:18,548
He's sleeping,
he's been through a lot.

463
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,500
Now you all are
welcome to stay.

464
00:27:20,502 --> 00:27:22,753
We certainly
have enough room.

465
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,090
It's your call.

466
00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:31,144
Thank you, Mrs. Queen.

467
00:27:31,146 --> 00:27:33,397
I guess we'll stay, then.

468
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:35,098
Good.

469
00:27:42,992 --> 00:27:44,557
Your lawyer's here.

470
00:27:45,693 --> 00:27:47,944
It's you.

471
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:51,948
I'd like to discuss
loose ends.

472
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,534
You didn't get my message?

473
00:27:54,536 --> 00:27:57,921
Forget about the Moore boy.

474
00:27:57,923 --> 00:28:00,674
I've already confessed,
that freakshow in a hood

475
00:28:00,676 --> 00:28:02,292
told me he'd kill me
if I didn't.

476
00:28:02,294 --> 00:28:05,512
We need to make
this meeting appear legitimate.

477
00:28:05,514 --> 00:28:06,963
Lawyer stuff.

478
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:10,217
Sign here, please.

479
00:28:10,219 --> 00:28:13,220
Am I clear?
You leave the boy alone.

480
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:15,939
I wish I could,

481
00:28:15,941 --> 00:28:17,391
but he's seen my face.

482
00:28:17,393 --> 00:28:19,226
Just like you.

483
00:28:21,896 --> 00:28:25,315
If you put pressure in just the
right areas above the forearm,

484
00:28:25,317 --> 00:28:28,485
like I did to you,
an embolism will form

485
00:28:28,487 --> 00:28:31,038
in the medial
antebrachial vein.

486
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,606
When the air pocket
reaches your heart in,

487
00:28:33,608 --> 00:28:35,709
give or take,
fifteen seconds,

488
00:28:35,711 --> 00:28:40,080
you'll die.
It's relatively painless.

489
00:28:40,082 --> 00:28:41,581
Oh...

490
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:44,434
Nothing personal.

491
00:28:44,436 --> 00:28:46,553
We're done here!

492
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,241
Excuse me, hi,
I'm looking for my boyfriend,

493
00:29:08,243 --> 00:29:10,777
he's kind of a regular
around here.

494
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:12,329
Piercing blue eyes,

495
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:14,865
and may or may not have
stolen a police radio.

496
00:29:14,867 --> 00:29:16,950
Yeah, that's him.
Behind you.

497
00:29:22,323 --> 00:29:24,758
Well, that's
a nice look.

498
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,826
What were you thinking?

499
00:29:26,828 --> 00:29:29,262
Well, if it
isn't the wonder twins...

500
00:29:29,264 --> 00:29:31,047
He's very sorry
for stealing the radio,

501
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:34,125
and he won't ever
bug you or steal anything

502
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,436
from you guys ever again.

503
00:29:35,437 --> 00:29:37,604
Both of you.
Come with me.

504
00:29:40,608 --> 00:29:43,527
What are we
doing here?

505
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:45,678
Well, your boyfriend
is so interested in the Hood,

506
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,564
I thought he might
like to meet someone else

507
00:29:47,566 --> 00:29:49,699
who already made
his acquaintance.

508
00:29:49,701 --> 00:29:51,735
Oh, God...

509
00:29:54,489 --> 00:29:56,840
Who was he?

510
00:29:56,842 --> 00:29:59,376
Well, that's the thing.
When you're alive, you get a name.

511
00:29:59,378 --> 00:30:02,329
When you wind up down
here, you get a number.

512
00:30:02,331 --> 00:30:04,464
Meet 26.

513
00:30:04,466 --> 00:30:06,249
See, your pal the Hood,

514
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:10,420
he's already sent
26 stiffs down here

515
00:30:10,422 --> 00:30:14,874
since he started
his little one-man...

516
00:30:14,876 --> 00:30:16,343
War.

517
00:30:16,345 --> 00:30:18,178
Maybe this guy deserved it.
Maybe he did.

518
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,931
But that's not
how justice works.

519
00:30:20,933 --> 00:30:23,333
You see, the vigilante,

520
00:30:23,335 --> 00:30:25,735
he doesn't have to answer
to anyone but himself,

521
00:30:25,737 --> 00:30:29,005
and that's a very dangerous power
to give to any one man.

522
00:30:29,007 --> 00:30:30,657
He saved my life.

523
00:30:33,861 --> 00:30:36,413
And how do you know tomorrow
he won't just as easily take it?

524
00:30:38,733 --> 00:30:40,167
Get out of here.

525
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:41,901
Let's go.

526
00:31:10,598 --> 00:31:12,866
He's safe now, Laurel.

527
00:31:12,868 --> 00:31:16,236
With a hard road ahead of him.

528
00:31:16,238 --> 00:31:20,073
Well, he's lucky
to have you in his life.

529
00:31:21,576 --> 00:31:24,327
I know the feeling.

530
00:31:26,497 --> 00:31:29,382
When you first got home,

531
00:31:29,384 --> 00:31:32,569
I didn't think
that you changed much.

532
00:31:32,571 --> 00:31:35,305
But you have, and...

533
00:31:36,741 --> 00:31:38,725
It's nice to see.

534
00:31:39,844 --> 00:31:42,512
Thank you.

535
00:31:52,324 --> 00:31:54,140
<i>I have a delivery
van coming in for Ms. Lance,</i>

536
00:31:54,142 --> 00:31:57,444
- <i>his I.D. checks out.</i>
- Thanks for the heads up.

537
00:32:04,302 --> 00:32:05,702
For... Ms. Lance.

538
00:32:15,996 --> 00:32:18,832
What a beautiful home.

539
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,435
Hmm...

540
00:32:24,436 --> 00:32:26,219
Such pain here.

541
00:32:26,221 --> 00:32:29,389
A sense of loss and
regret, you can feel it,

542
00:32:29,391 --> 00:32:31,558
down to the wood paneling...

543
00:32:40,267 --> 00:32:41,434
Tommy...

544
00:32:41,436 --> 00:32:42,903
Can you two stay
here with Taylor?

545
00:32:42,905 --> 00:32:44,654
- Where are you going?
- It's an old house,

546
00:32:44,656 --> 00:32:46,873
fuses blow all the time,
it's probably nothing,

547
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:48,775
just please...

548
00:32:48,777 --> 00:32:50,844
Come on.
Ok.

549
00:33:12,466 --> 00:33:14,317
He's here.

550
00:33:16,438 --> 00:33:18,021
Where's the child?

551
00:33:18,023 --> 00:33:19,689
This house is quite large

552
00:33:19,691 --> 00:33:22,308
and I don't particularly
care to check every room.

553
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,910
Very well.

554
00:33:23,912 --> 00:33:26,613
Have it your way.

555
00:33:48,335 --> 00:33:50,887
Laurel...
Laurel, don't--

556
00:33:50,889 --> 00:33:52,522
No, Ollie is
still out there.

557
00:34:28,643 --> 00:34:30,877
What happened to you
on that island?

558
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,346
You're about to find out.

559
00:35:05,213 --> 00:35:07,797
Death by poker.

560
00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:10,050
That's a new one.

561
00:35:10,052 --> 00:35:11,601
He was going
to shoot me.

562
00:35:11,603 --> 00:35:13,053
And then, uh, mister...

563
00:35:13,055 --> 00:35:15,889
Robbins, he grabbed
the poker and...

564
00:35:15,891 --> 00:35:17,390
saved my life.

565
00:35:18,543 --> 00:35:22,562
<i>Mr. Robbins
was a real hero.</i>

566
00:35:22,564 --> 00:35:24,931
<i>If it weren't for him,
we'd all be dead.</i>

567
00:35:24,933 --> 00:35:27,367
I've got enough
details for my report.

568
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:30,320
I'll clear my boys
out of here.

569
00:35:32,707 --> 00:35:34,624
Let's go.

570
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:53,059
You still love her.
Don't you?

571
00:35:53,061 --> 00:35:54,761
It doesn't matter
how I feel.

572
00:35:54,763 --> 00:35:57,514
Because of what I do...

573
00:35:57,516 --> 00:36:00,517
I could never be with her.

574
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:02,152
You see, you don't have
anything to be afraid of.

575
00:36:02,154 --> 00:36:04,637
She is never...

576
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:08,491
ever going to know my secret.

577
00:36:08,493 --> 00:36:10,694
It doesn't matter
if she knows.

578
00:36:10,696 --> 00:36:11,962
I know.

579
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:14,114
And I don't know
how to be with Laurel

580
00:36:14,116 --> 00:36:16,950
knowing
the entire time...

581
00:36:16,952 --> 00:36:21,037
that if she ever found
out who you really are...

582
00:36:22,373 --> 00:36:25,158
she would choose you.

583
00:36:35,816 --> 00:36:38,366
Thank you for everything you
tried to do for Eric and Nancy.

584
00:36:38,606 --> 00:36:41,240
And for keeping Taylor safe.

585

-  Yeah, because of him.

You don't owe him anything.

and labor till the work...♪

643
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:28,649
So let's find him.

644
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:33,170
I can tell this means
the world to you.

645
00:39:33,172 --> 00:39:36,373
And you mean
the world to me.

646
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:40,260
So let's find him.

647
00:39:40,262 --> 00:39:42,713
You and me.

648
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:45,349
Vigilante, here we come.

649
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:00,864
Was hoping you'd be here.

650
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,702
I want us to get back
on the same page.

651
00:40:04,704 --> 00:40:07,854
Oliver, we're not
even in the same book,

652
00:40:07,856 --> 00:40:10,491
you and me, not anymore.

653
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:15,562
I just did what
I thought I had to.

654
00:40:15,564 --> 00:40:18,966
Just like I'm doing
what I have to.

655
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,203
We're done.

656
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:26,507
Don't do this.

657
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:27,925
The only thing
you have to stop me

658
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:30,094
from going out that door
is an arrow.

659
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:37,017
Hey.

660
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,741
Where's he going?

661
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:56,737
So how did our
Robin Hood do?

662
00:40:56,739 --> 00:40:59,206
As expected?

663
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:02,075
So back to the
drawing board we go.

664
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:10,801
Yao Fei!

665
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:13,103
Ba!

666
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,696
How did you escape?

667
00:41:22,698 --> 00:41:25,365
I didn't.

668
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,158
You son of a bitch...

669
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,493
Hey!

670
00:41:40,381 --> 00:41:44,301
Your time on this
island is at an end.
