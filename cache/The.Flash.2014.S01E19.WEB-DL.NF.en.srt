No.

637
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,128
Too many memories of Tess.

That's right.

I'm sorry.

You, detective...

641

You never talk about her, do you?

00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,106
No.

645
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:56,983
I don't.

No.

You and I, detective...

650
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:11,998
One whose membership is too expensive.

Maybe we should have
another drink sometime.

652
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,546
Talk about it.

00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,173
Yeah.

654
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,633
Yeah. We should do that.

00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,917
After the accelerator exploded,
I built a 3D model of S.T.A.R. Labs...

658
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,503

And you never ran this test?

660
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,800
Of course I did. I just never had
a reason to look at any areas...

661
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,844
...outside of the pipeline or the cortex.

662
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,806
It's a big building.
Lots of places for Wells to hide something.

What is that?

664
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,061
That shouldn't be there.
