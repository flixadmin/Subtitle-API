2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,882
Here you go.

3
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,963
What happened there?

4
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,920
- It's my birthday.
- Yeah? Well, happy birthday.

5
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,843
Birthday meals are free at Denny's.
All you gotta show is a valid ID.

6
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,605
I'm good. Thanks.

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,048
Really? Free meal. Free is good.

8
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,006
Even if I was, like, rich,
free is always good.

9
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,291
Thank you.

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,646
Okay.

11
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,042
New Hampshire.
You're a long way from home.

12
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,446
How long a drive is that?

13
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,491
About 30 hours,
if all you stop for is gas.

14
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,569
You headed to California?

15
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,240
No. Here.

16
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,089
Okay.

17
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,004
So, what's here?

18
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,367
Business.

19
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,127
You know, I was in Boston once. Boston
and a little town called Swampscott...

20
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,766
...which is right outside of Boston.

21
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,321
That's kind of near
New Hampshire, right?

22
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,967
Yeah. More or less.

23
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,964
Yeah, I was maybe 6,
so I don't really remember it.

24
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,249
I want to say I liked it.
They got this really big aquarium.

25
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,563
Yeah. Great science museum there.

26
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,561
Excuse me.

27
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,721
- Hi.
- Hi.

28
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,723
My name's Lucy. I'll be your server.

29
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,560
I got your word this won't wind up
crossing the border?

30
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,207
It's never leaving town.

31
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,161
Is there a manual?
Instruction manual?

32
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,163
I pulled something off the Internet.

33
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,084
It's in there.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,809
Well...

35
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,008
...good luck, I guess.

36
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,967
Happy birthday, Mr. Lambert.

37
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,083
Jesus, Walt, the news here...
Gus Fring is dead.

38
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,801
He was blown up along with some
person from some Mexican cartel...

39
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,931
...and the DEA has no idea
what to make of it.

40
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,448
Do you know about this?

41
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,485
Walt?

42
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,807
Walt, I need you to...

43
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,203
<i>It's over. We're safe.</i>

44
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,048
Was this you?

45
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,969
<i>What happened?</i>

46
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,449
I won.

47
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,569
Oh, God.

48
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,364
Dad.

49
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,204
- Dad.
- Hey.

50
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,647
Hey.

51
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,128
Serious... You don't have the TV on?
Seriously?

52
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,567
No, sorry, I...

53
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,162
You didn't tell him about Mr. Fring?

54
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,130
- He knows.
- Welcome home.

55
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,729
Jesus, Dad, it's all they're talking about.

56
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,406
They haven't said it on TV yet...

57
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,723
...but Uncle Hank says he was
this major, major drug dealer.

58
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,248
I mean, like, holy shit.

59
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,768
Your uncle is safe, right?
How do they know that?

60
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,366
Uncle Hank was
after this guy all along.

61
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,807
He didn't tell us, but he was.

62
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,571
He even took me
to his restaurant one time...

63
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,530
...just, like, totally toying
with the guy...

64
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,524
...just like, "I got my eye on you."
Like that.

65
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,481
They figure Mr. Fring was the one
who put the hit out on Uncle Hank.

66
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,127
Just somebody got to him first.

67
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,725
Yeah, wow.

68
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,201
Aunt Marie's still pretty freaked.

69
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,571
She didn't want us to leave,
but Mom figured it was time.

70
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,523
There's still some agents over
there, but they figure it's over.

71
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,160
Like, when this hits the news...

72
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,800
...Uncle Hank is gonna be a hero.

73
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,884
- Yeah.
- I mean, even more so than before.

74
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,123
Seriously.

75
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,089
See... See if it's on TV.

76
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,447
Yeah, yeah, I want to.

77
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,409
Just give me a couple minutes, huh?

78
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,166
<i>Around the 24-yard-line...
they break huddle...</i>

79
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,085
Hi.

80
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,564
Hi.

81
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,050
Hi, sweet pea.

82
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,846
Oh, Daddy missed you so much.

83
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,569
Yes, he did.

84
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,643
I know.

85
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,804
I missed you too.

86
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,131
Well, don't you think
I rate a "hello," at least?

87
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,210
Hello.

88
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,082
Hello to you too.

89
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,684
So are you gonna talk to me here?

90
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,324
Are you gonna...

91
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,767
You gonna show some kind of...

92
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,090
I don't know, some kind of
mild relief that I'm alive?

93
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,088
I am relieved, Walt.

94
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,603
And scared.

95
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,570
Scared?

96
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,010
Scared of what?

97
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,125
You.

98
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,085
Hey.

99
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,364
Hi.

100
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,764
Oh, shit.

101
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,450
Jesus, just say it already.

102
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,041
Tell me "I told you so."
Get it out of your system...

103
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,568
...before you need, like,
dialysis or something.

104
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,929
It's exactly like
Boetticher's drawings.

105
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,682
Where were the two bodies?

106
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,242
Over by the freight elevator.
Over there.

107
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,206
- No idea who they were?
- No, not much left.

108
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,842
Apparently the teeth do this popcorn
thing when they get too hot...

109
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,644
...so they tell me.

110
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,883
Whoever torched it did it up right.

111
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,806
Fring, you magnificent bastard.

112
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,170
What do you figure that was?

113
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,120
I don't know,
some kind of lab equipment?

114
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,922
Maybe a camera?

115
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,121
Come on. Come on, you, be nice.
Be nice.

116
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,806
Come on. Hey. Hey!

117
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,803
You be nice. Just be nice.

118
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,803
Let Wendell in there.

119
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,131
If Wendell doesn't eat, nobody eats.

120
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,770
Yeah.

121
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,324
It's Gustavo.

122
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,522
He's dead.

123
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,164
Son of a bitch.

124
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,681
Son of a bitch.

125
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,721
- Hold up! Hold up!
- Get out of my way, kid.

126
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,642
- Wait a minute, all right? Let him talk.
- I am done listening to this asshole talk.

127
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,365
Now get out of my way.

128
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,761
He's got something you need to hear,
all right?

129
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,207
What'd you do, Jesse?
Do you even know?

130
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,249
Do you even know what you've done?

131
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,926
- Yeah, he saved his own life...
- One more word.

132
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,003
Mike. Mike.

133
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,051
If you kill him, you're gonna
have to kill me. Come on.

134
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,086
Oh, Jesse.

135
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,562
Jesus.

136
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,881
What is it with you guys?

137
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,600
Honest to God.

138
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,120
May I?

139
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,170
Look, whatever differences
you and I have, they'll keep.

140
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,721
Right now we've got
bigger fish to fry.

141
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,849
- Bigger fish.
- The video cameras.

142
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,571
Gus kept cameras on us at the lab...

143
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,491
...at the laundry,
God only knows where else.

144
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,485
And of course, when I say "us,"
I'm including you.

145
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,290
Mike.

146
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,960
Mike, if he taped all that shit...

147
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,691
...us cooking, you picking up...

148
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,162
If Gus had a record of that and
the police get to it before we do...

149
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,486
You son of a bitch.

150
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,690
Mike, it's all on tape somewhere,
or a hard drive.

151
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,645
Where?

152
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,131
Where did he keep it?

153
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,363
He had a laptop in his office.

154
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,364
Kept it in the
back of the restaurant.

155
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,804
It all fed straight to there.

156
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,525
What?

157
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,728
Keys, scumbag.

158
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,407
It's the universal symbol for keys.

159
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,643
Meter fraud.
And yes, yes, it's a big deal.

160
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,882
Guy rigs his meter so he's paying
<i>2</i> cents less for first-class postage.

161
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,364
I'm here to tell you that the USPS
takes that very seriously.

162
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,605
It's money out of your pocket,
it's money out of my pocket.

163
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,969
I was hoping... Now, look, sarge.

164
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,926
Do you think we could work together on
this thing? You folks have it over there?

165
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,487
Could you tell me that, at least?

166
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,688
Yeah.

167
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,368
Well, thanks for your help.

168
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:59,367
Inspector Clark... Inspector Dave Clark,
like the Dave Clark Five?

169
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,844
Before your time.

170
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,561
Well, you feel free to call me
day or night at this number.

171
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,929
Yes, sir. No, you as well.

172
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,525
Thank you.

173
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,490
Oh, yeah.

174
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,127
We're boned.

175
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,530
Well...

176
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,443
You know how they say
"it's been a pleasure"?

177
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,205
It hasn't.

178
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,726
Are you gonna tell us
about the laptop?

179
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,561
- Where you going?
- I'm getting the hell out of Dodge, kid.

180
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,730
And so should you.
It's just a matter of time.

181
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,202
Mike, where is the laptop?

182
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,246
What the hell difference does it make?
They got it. End of story.

183
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,721
A.P.D., Northwest Area Command
on Second.

184
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,962
They tagged it, they filed it...

185
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,011
...it's in the system, and they
locked it in their evidence room.

186
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,369
All right.

187
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,802
All right. So describe the building.

188
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,411
Describe the...

189
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,528
How about I describe Fort Knox?

190
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,364
And what are you gonna do?

191
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,127
Are you gonna put on your black leotard
and go dangling on a clothesline?

192
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,124
It's a building full of cops.
What else do you need to know?

193
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,204
And why in the hell
am I talking to you?

194
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,284
Mike, we gotta do something.

195
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,929
I am doing something.

196
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,765
He's good with this stuff, okay?
Just give him a chance.

197
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,604
Now, you look.

198
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,082
That laptop might as well
be on the moon.

199
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,330
They build these evidence rooms
like bank vaults because guess what...

200
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,370
...lunatics like you
wanna break into them.

201
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,163
But unlike a bank vault, this is a place
that is guarded 24 hours a day...

202
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,129
...by the police.

203
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,851
There's no way you're getting it
out of there.

204
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,243
Who said that we have to
get it out of there?

205
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,411
We just need to
destroy what's on it.

206
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,206
Oh, so now you wanna
blow up a police station?

207
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,169
I don't believe I said that, no.

208
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,846
Nursing home full of old folks
just whet your appetite.

209
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,684
Now you wanna kill a bunch of cops.

210
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,888
I never said anything
about killing anybody.

211
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,805
I am, however, considering
the possibility of a device.

212
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,440
- A device.
- Yes, a small device.

213
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,331
Say this device gets
filed into evidence.

214
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,165
- Now it is inside that room.
- What about a magnet?

215
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,688
You wanna commit a whole other crime
just to get this bomb into evidence.

216
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,605
- Who said "bomb"? I said "a device."
- What about a magnet?

217
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,525
An incendiary device.
One quick fire is all it would take.

218
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,002
You don't think they have fire
suppression? I'm not talking sprinklers.

219
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,209
I'm talking about halon.
Because halon doesn't destroy evidence.

220
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,887
- A magnet, though, maybe like...
- A bomb then. We plant a bomb outside.

221
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,281
Oh, actually I knew a crew
out of Fort Worth...

222
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,960
...that tried to blow up an
evidence room from outside.

223
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,487
About all they did was take out
a couple of hedges.

224
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,281
You are probably talking about
<i>2</i> feet of reinforced concrete.

225
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,851
Or what about a magnet?

226
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,401
What magnet? What about it?

227
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,324
You know, just:

228
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,324
So, what do you think?

229
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,651
Expensive.

230
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,889
Leaving aside engineering...

231
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,611
...rigging some kind of
alternate power source...

232
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,924
...my primary sticking point is
I actually need the thing.

233
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,845
As you gentlemen can see,
it's paying the bills.

234
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,288
But I mean it's feasible, doable?

235
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,644
Hey, we're living in a time of
string theories and God particles.

236
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,644
Feasible, doable?
Yeah, sure, why not?

237
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,882
Expensive.

238
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,127
What would you put it in?

239
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,643
What about that? Does it run?

240
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,969
We can get it running.

241
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,168
What's the box made of?

242
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,402
Plywood and aluminium,
just what you need.

243
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,882
All right, so you wanna talk money?

244
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,286
Step into my office.

245
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,002
Hey, listen.

246
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,404
I don't actually have
any money right now.

247
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,203
My wife... There's an IRS issue.

248
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,241
Anyway, I'd appreciate it if you could
spot me my share. I'll pay you back.

249
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,249
Yeah. Whatever.

250
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,129
Right.

251
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,889
You coming?

252
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,563
If you have any brains,
you'll take that money you saved...

253
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,243
...and you'll skip town.
Today. Right now.

254
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,604
You don't think this can work?

255
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,168
Is that a serious question?

256
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,129
Mike, this is a three-man job.

257
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,205
The only way I know it won't work
for sure is if we don't have you.

258
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,610
Come in.

259
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,808
Get in. Close the door.

260
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,411
What did we say
about you coming here?

261
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,291
Yeah, speaking of things
that tend to rile you up...

262
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,205
...the police, they may call.

263
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,365
Let me back up a little. Can I sit down?
I'm gonna sit down.

264
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,000
Okay, why are the police
gonna call?

265
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,085
May call you.
Distant, outside possibility.

266
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,369
But on the off chance,
I want you thinking one thought:

267
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,760
<i>Hogan's Heroes.</i>

268
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,561
Sergeant Schultz.
You remember Sergeant Schultz?

269
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,444
"I know nothing. I see nothing."

270
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,961
You remember how he...
I want you like that.

271
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,647
- Okay, Saul, why are the police...
- There was an incident with Beneke...

272
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,325
Oh, God.

273
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,931
- And it's...
- Oh, Jesus.

274
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,731
- What incident?
- An act of God.

275
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,644
There's no right. There's no wrong.

276
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,246
I mean, it just...
That's the best phrase.

277
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:36,486
It fits, but we got a problem.

278
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,368
Ted's dead.

279
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,326
Sorry?

280
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,608
Ted is dead?

281
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,161
No. No, no.

282
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,641
He just woke up.

283
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,002
Right-o, that should do her.

284
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,965
All right, watches off.

285
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,122
Necklaces, earrings,
rings, bracelets...

286
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,370
Gold. These are nonferrous.

287
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,521
Better hope.

288
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,162
What about that stuff you young guys
wear on the end of your pricks?

289
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,206
Speak now or forever sing soprano.
What's up with that, by the way?

290
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,331
Why would anybody wanna put a metal
ring through the end of their prick?

291
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,767
What are you looking at me for?

292
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,804
All right, guns, knives...

293
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,685
...tools, keys,
plates in your head...

294
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,406
...artificial hips.

295
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,564
Check your pockets for me
one more time, please.

296
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,127
Oh, credit cards.

297
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,966
You want that plastic working
come Miller time.

298
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,886
You know, I can foresee a lot of
possible outcomes to this thing...

299
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,442
...and not a single one of them
involves Miller time.

300
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,170
P.M.A.

301
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,806
Positive mental attitude.

302
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,962
Okay, I think we're good to go.

303
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,366
All right, where do you
want me with this?

304
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,285
Start 40 feet out. That's more
than the length of the room.

305
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,283
- Who's doing the honors?
- Me.

306
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,090
Flip that switch, turns it on.

307
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,208
Twist this here.
That's your power control.

308
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,169
- All right.
- Everybody ready?

309
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,845
- Yeah.
- Okay.

310
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,923
Fire in the hole!

311
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,409
All right, you ready?

312
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:38,049
Fingers crossed it don't yank
the drive shaft through the floor.

313
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,490
Anything?

314
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,931
Nope. It's still working.

315
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,602
All right, start
walking forward slowly.

316
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,644
Wait, wait, wait.

317
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,171
Yeah. That did it.

318
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,328
Yes.

319
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,490
Yeah, bitch!

320
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,002
Magnets!

321
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,408
How many batteries is this?

322
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:43,771
That there's 21, wired in series,
so 21 times 12.

323
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,331
Two hundred fifty-two volts.

324
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,642
Can you add 21 more,
wired in parallel?

325
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,007
UP the amperage?

326
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,720
Everything goes flying
in that evidence room...

327
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,761
...it's gonna make one hell of a noise,
and there goes your element of surprise.

328
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,684
Won't matter.

329
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,844
Sixty seconds, we'll be gone.

330
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,242
Excuse me.

331
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,605
Hi. Who are you looking for?

332
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,047
Ted Beneke. I'm a friend of his.

333
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,202
But if it's not a
good time, I could...

334
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,609
No, no, no, this is fine.
I'm just finishing up. Come on in.

335
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,649
Hey, Ted.

336
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,604
I tell you, he's been a real champ.

337
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,121
His color’s better
and his blood pressure's up.

338
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,124
We are gonna have you
eating solid food in a day or two...

339
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,805
...I bet you money.

340
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,962
That's wonderful.

341
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,048
All right, I'm just down the hall.

342
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,485
Ted.

343
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,928
Can you hear me?

344
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,683
Yes.

345
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,968
Ted, I just...

346
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,011
I don't even know...

347
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,049
Skyler.

348
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,368
I haven't said anything...

349
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,848
...to anyone.

350
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,922
I told them it was an accident.

351
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,489
I tripped...

352
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,328
...and fell. That is all they know.

353
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,083
Just...

354
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,962
I've... I've got children.

355
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,088
Family.

356
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,641
I swear to you.

357
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,009
Please.

358
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,924
I just...

359
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,009
I...

360
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,810
...will never breathe...

361
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,963
...one word of this.

362
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,444
Good.

363
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,764
It should be about a quarter
of the way down on the left.

364
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,089
We'll do a loop and come around
the other side. Turn here.

365
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,245
Right up there.

366
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,528
That's the wall.

367
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,809
What the hell is this?
There's some big-ass hump in the way.

368
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,440
So? Just drive over it.

369
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,169
- All right.
- Come on, you can do it.

370
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,045
Take it easy. Take it easy.

371
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,844
You got it.

372
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,210
Cut it.

373
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,523
It's, like, 8 feet away. Is this cool?
Is this close enough?

374
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,761
It'll work.

375
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,441
- Mr. White, let's go.
- Hold on.

376
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,484
- Let's just go!
- Hang on.

377
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,002
Mr. White, let's get out of here.

378
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,289
Just one minute.

379
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,330
- Turn it off! Turn it off.
- I will.

380
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,520
Jacocks! Jacocks, you okay?

381
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,842
Outside! Outside!

382
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,770
Yeah, bitch!

383
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,888
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

384
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,408
And what exactly are you celebrating?
You left the truck behind.

385
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,767
- So what?
- "So what"?

386
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,604
So what if they find prints?

387
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,809
And what if they trace it back
to the wrecking yard?

388
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,610
They won't.

389
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,728
There's no prints,
I made sure of that.

390
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,562
There's no paperwork on the truck,
the magnet or the batteries.

391
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,405
Untraceable salvage, all of it.

392
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,050
I made sure of that too.

393
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,043
Well, you got all the answers.

394
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,921
So you tell me, Answer Man,
did all that even work just now?

395
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,890
Yes. It worked.

396
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,361
And I'm supposed
to take that on faith?

397
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,444
Yeah? And why?

398
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,051
How do we know?

399
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,161
Because I say so.

400
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,884
07-66-26432.

401
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,451
Gutierrez, Alvin B.

402
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,449
Roofing hammer.

403
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,361
Undamaged. Bag still sealed.

404
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,444
11-58-73321.

405
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,125
Fring, Gustavo.

406
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,288
Samsung laptop computer.

407
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,364
Damaged. Glass screen
is broken and in pieces.

408
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,204
Bag still sealed.

409
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,081
11-58-73317.

410
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,449
Fring, Gustavo.
Framed photograph of two men.

411
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,681
Damaged.

412
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,683
The glass is broken...

413
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,002
...and photo has slipped
out of its frame.

414
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,642
Bag appears to be slightly punctured
by broken glass.

415
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,327
Check it out.

416
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,930
That's not on the manifest.

417
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,604
All right, so first off,
I'm not a marriage counselor.

418
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,489
Nor do I take sides in this thing.

419
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,563
And, not taking sides, mind you...

420
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,961
...but you did put her in charge
of your money...

421
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,766
...which I advised against,
if you'll recall...

422
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,804
...all of which is not to be
construed as an "I told you so."

423
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,642
I'm just walking you through
my mental process, so to speak.

424
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,083
So she comes to me with a problem.

425
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,608
That she's been cooking Beneke's
books, he's in Dutch with the IRS...

426
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,082
...and once they audit,
it's Rio de Caca for the both of them.

427
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,245
To which I say, "Hey, let's
involve Walt in this discussion."

428
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,125
To which she says,
"No, let's cut Beneke a check...

429
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,561
...so's he can pay
off the IRS."

430
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,282
Again, not taking sides, but she
really was trying to protect you.

431
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,287
A little feedback
here might be nice.

432
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,483
"Let's involve Walt
in this discussion."

433
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,644
Yeah, that's what I told her.
She said no.

434
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,047
And you didn't argue the point.

435
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,089
You didn't think to contact me.

436
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,291
You were a tad preoccupied at
the time, if you'll recall.

437
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,889
Okay. So you took
it upon yourself...

438
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,762
...to give away $622,000
of my money...

439
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,641
...to a man who had been
sleeping with my wife.

440
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,530
She's my client, same as you.

441
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,570
Does this arrangement
get a little tricky at times?

442
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,801
Absolutely.

443
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,009
But I try my best, you know,
ethically, in my duty...

444
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,969
Ethically?

445
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,244
I'm sorry. I must be hearing things.

446
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,247
Did you actually just use
the word "ethically" in a sentence?

447
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,562
You're not Clarence Darrow, Saul.

448
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,491
You're a two-bit bus-bench lawyer.

449
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,011
And you work for me.

450
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,488
Yeah, well, Clarence Darrow
never had a client like you ask him...

451
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,369
...for something...

452
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,127
...like this.

453
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,602
Okay? Yeah, I put my ass
on the line for you.

454
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,165
Huell too.

455
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,762
He's got fingers like hot dogs.
He could've easily busted this in two...

456
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,844
...and killed everyone in the office.
But do I complain?

457
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,571
No. Beg, borrow or steal,
I'm your huckleberry.

458
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,121
I go the extra mile.

459
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:04,124
Only you never told me that kid
would wind up in the hospital.

460
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,204
You know...

461
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,681
Take that thing
and get the hell out of here.

462
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,201
You and me, we're done.

463
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,851
What are you...?

464
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,445
Come on. Hey.

465
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,284
Hey.

466
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,001
We're done when I say we're done.

467
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,521
Yes, you are. Yes.

468
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,770
Hey.

469
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,405
I heard what happened to Ted.

470
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,008
He's not gonna talk.

471
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,009
Yeah.

472
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,287
I forgive you.

473
