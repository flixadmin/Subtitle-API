1
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:45,708
Let’s get down!

2
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,989
This is going to sell better
than the original.

3
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,994
The time has come
to take Pablo’s money.

4
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,838
—Search.
—What’s happening?

5
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:17,382
Look at that.

6
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,511
Your prize dog didn’t even stop.

7
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,805
There’s no coke in that boat.

8
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:23,931
Come here.

9
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:29,937
It’s blended
right into the fibreglass hull.

10
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:34,566
Give me the money … the cash!

11
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,236
Looks like you got taken
with this dog, brother.

12
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:42,074
—Hold this a moment.
—Oh, Marquessa, my dear …

13
00:04:43,034 --> 00:04:44,243
It’s OK, it’s OK.

14
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:52,001
—Are you fucking crazy?
—What?

15
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,502
It’s my dog.

16
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,552
Son of a bitch.

17
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,095
What happened?

18
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:05,139
You want to know what happened?
Go look.

19
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:08,267
Pablo?

20
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,022
—Pablo, we have a motherfucking problem.
—Bastard murderer.

21
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,649
—He killed the dog.
—I don’t give a shit.

22
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:18,652
If we don’t resolve this problem,
we’re gonna all get murdered.

23
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:24,033
—Come on, man.
—Son of a bitch.

24
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:28,704
Let’s see …

25
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:32,208
This is the problem?

26
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:35,377
People are watching us, Pablo.

27
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,421
They’re asking themselves
how two small businessmen

28
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,007
suddenly came up with so much cash.

29
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:41,466
Gustavo, brother …

30
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:44,553
just launder the money.

31
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:49,600
Make it look legitimate, that’s all.

32
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:54,479
Isn’t that what Al Capone did?

33
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,026
—Al Capone?
—Al Capone.

34
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,154
You’re a dumbass, Pablo.

35
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:04,656
—Al Capone is a terrible example.
—Why?

36
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,367
Because Al Capone
never had this much cash.

37
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,037
This is too much to launder.

38
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,372
Well then …

39
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,294
let’s buy a bigger washing machine.

40
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,836
You’re spending too much cash, Pablo.

41
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:03,299
You have Picassos, Dalís, farms,

42
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:07,178
houses, apartments, boats, planes, cars.

43
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:11,015
I told you we have to fly low.

44
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:15,227
If you keep spending like that,
you’re going to end up in Forbes Magazine.

45
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:17,646
And if that happens,
the government is going to have our asses.

46
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,857
Enough, Gustavo, enough.

47
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,067
What do you want me to say?

48
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,569
Bury it.

49
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,531
—How’s that?
—Bury the cash.

50
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,700
And cut the bullshit.

51
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,871
Go on, pussy.

52
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,143
Hey, Mom.

53
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:59,271
—I’m praying, Pablo.
—Just for a second.

54
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,235
Sit.

55
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,369
It isn’t very comfortable, Pablito.

56
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,287
I’ll buy you another sofa later.

57
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:18,540
Wouldn’t it be better
if you put all this money in a bank, son?

58
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,334
No.

59
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:22,878
All bankers are bandits.

60
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,463
Really, honey?

61
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:55,160
Forbes Magazine says …

62
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:58,830
… that the narcos have more money

63
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:02,000
than the richest capitalist pig
in this country.

64
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:03,085
Let me see?

65
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:08,715
If we kidnap someone in their family,
what are they going to do?

66
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,175
Call the police?

67
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:11,760
Commander.

68
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:17,391
It says here that Gacha, “The Mexican,”
is the ninth richest man in the world.

69
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:19,351
I say we kidnap his son.

70
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,147
He’s a psycho maniac, comrade.

71
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:27,318
Plus, he’s bought off half the military.

72
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:31,071
Well, the Ochoa brothers
are number 14 on the list.

73
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:33,491
Their sister Marta goes to the university.

74
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,783
How about her?

75
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:41,332
I like that more. The Ochoas are soft.

76
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,875
Wait a second!

77
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:47,004
What about Pablo Escobar?

78
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,127
What about Pablo Escobar?

79
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,046
He’s the richest of them all.

80
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,174
Escobar gives money to the poor.

81
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:15,426
You’re right.

82
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:17,553
Escobar is a man of the people.

83
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:18,970
He’s all right with me.

84
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,680
OK, then.

85
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,350
Let’s do the Ochoas.

86
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,641
Good afternoon.

87
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:09,146
Mr and Mrs Murphy.

88
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:47,392
Sir, this couple has no sanitary B-47 form
and no I-435 identifying papers, either.

89
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,896
Yes, sir.
They brought an American cat with them.

90
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:59,237
Sure, but without the I-435, I can’t
officially state that it is indeed a cat.

91
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:05,243
I also can’t guarantee
that it’s American.

92
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:10,790
Sir, I’m not trying
to make your life more difficult.

93
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:13,711
OK, sir.

94
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,613
—Hello, Pablo.
—Hello, Valeria.

95
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,949
—This is my wife, Tata.
—Hello.

96
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,243
Don’t worry. Everything will be perfect.

97
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:31,162
I’m just not used
to these type of things.

98
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,664
Just be yourself.

99
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,875
Ma’am, it would be best
if you weren’t here.

100
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,131
Look, Tata,
there are a lot of people here.

101
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,049
It might not be good for the baby.

102
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:46,177
Go to the house.

103
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,876
Welcome to Nuevos Tiempos.

104
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:22,380
I’m Valeria Velez and I’m here with the
man known as “the Robin Hood of the poor”

105
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:25,008
for his generosity
with the poor of Medellín.

106
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:44,152
Tell us about your program,
“Medellín Without Slums,” Mr Escobar.

107
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:47,238
I was born in Rionegro,
not too far from here.

108
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:52,035
And I asked myself how a government
that exists for the people

109
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,913
can be so out of touch
with what they need.

110
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:57,666
Hospitals, social and athletic programs,

111
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,878
plus the construction
of 400 houses in this community.

112
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,923
I hear you told your mother that one day
you would be president of Colombia.

113
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,925
Do you have any political aspirations,
Mr Escobar?

114
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:11,388
None at all.
My business takes up most of my time.

115
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,390
I will tell you one thing, Valeria.

116
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:19,688
For decades, our country has been led by
Lopez and other families that are wealthy

117
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,524
who made their fortune
off exploiting the poor.

118
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:26,904
They don’t know the dreams
of common people, but I do …

119
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,542
Thank you very much.

120
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,288
Thank you.

121
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,379
Does your wife do it standing up?

122
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:57,721
Don’t ever disrespect Tata.

123
00:18:58,596 --> 00:18:59,806
Do you hear me?

124
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:07,271
I’m sorry, Pablo. I’m sorry.

125
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:11,150
Forgive me.

126
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:17,782
It won’t happen again.

127
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,034
I promise.

128
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,089
How can I apologize?

129
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,814
Want to put it in my ass?

130
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,578
We get better every time we practice.

131
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,664
You’re amazing, Javi.

132
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,756
Don’t go overboard.

133
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,514
It’s the truth.

134
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:07,892
What can you offer me to drink?

135
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:10,228
Whiskey or tap water.

136
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:12,939
Water.

137
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,327
What you’re missing
in this apartment is a woman.

138
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,287
It’s fine the way it is.

139
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:32,542
I wasn’t offering.

140
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,219
Here.

141
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,475
If you were a client,
you would have paid me already.

142
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:55,940
—And you wouldn’t know my real name.
—Don’t take it the wrong way.

143
00:21:56,024 --> 00:22:00,070
It’s cash from Uncle Sam
for the information you never gave me.

144
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,323
Take it.

145
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,745
And my visa?

146
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:12,916
Give me something I can use
and we’ll talk about it.

147
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,965
What are you doing this weekend?

148
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:24,135
—I’m going to Medellín.
—Work or play?

149
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,930
I have to take care of my child.

150
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:29,515
I can pay, too.

151
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:35,563
Those guys are richer
than Uncle Sam, Javi.

152
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:40,359
Come here.

153
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:45,156
—What?
—Give me a kiss.

154
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,700
Give me a kiss.

155
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,214
I guess I’ll have to find another girl.

156
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:05,051
Good luck with that.
We’re all going to Medellín.

157
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,220
Some of us are even going by plane.

158
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,100
Helena?

159
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:13,601
Helena?

160
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,982
Whose party is it?

161
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:22,461
Just one thing.
Who told you about this?

162
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,549
Mother Teresa of Calcutta.

163
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:42,232
Pablo says they’re not going to pay a dime
to M-19 for Marta Ochoa. Gustavo, too.

164
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:47,111
—And Jorge?
—No. Jorge doesn’t agree.

165
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:50,614
—Then what?
—They’re all going to a meeting.

166
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:52,700
At Las Margaritas.

167
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:55,494
—Everyone?
—Yeah, they’ll all be there.

168
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:10,547
—Good day, Major.
—Good day.

169
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:15,552
Your intel was good. The traquetos
are gathering at Las Margaritas.

170
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:21,182
Fresh meat.

171
00:28:54,442 --> 00:29:01,449
What I propose at this moment, gentlemen,
is that we form an organization.

172
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:08,539
Pool our resources to train soldiers,
trade knowledge and buy information.

173
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:14,671
And so the message is clear,
we’re going to name our group …

174
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,089
“Death to Kidnappers.”

175
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:20,843
What I propose …

176
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:24,681
I will manage all operational aspects.

177
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,350
All you need to do is cover my expenses.

178
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:31,688
What you gentlemen
will receive in return:

179
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,397
two things.

180
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:36,526
One … I promise to end the kidnapping.

181
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:41,071
Two … and at this moment,
the most important …

182
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:46,369
I promise to return
Marta Ochoa to her family.

183
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:52,625
Death to Kidnappers!

184
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:09,975
Come in! Enjoy!

185
00:30:11,686 --> 00:30:14,980
Don’t forget La Quica!
Take care of him, too.

186
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:20,944
Sit down, my love.

187
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:26,450
—How are you?
—Good. And you?

188
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:28,494
I like your hat.

189
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:30,413
It looks good on you.

190
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:32,915
—Do you think so?
—Yes, it looks good.

191
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,250
Let’s see.

192
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,336
Very cute.

193
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:27,845
You’re tired.

194
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,182
Let me relax you a bit.

195
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,983
So what happened at that meeting
that made you so tired?

196
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:48,365
What did you hear?

197
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:50,743
Nothing. Just making conversation.

198
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:15,267
I want you to find the girl.

199
00:32:16,811 --> 00:32:19,021
I can pick up a sicario.
You OK with that?

200
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,315
—I’m going with you.
—What about Fresh Meat?

201
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,030
That’s it, guys.

202
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,505
Guys.

203
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,298
Hey, what happened?

204
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:48,634
That little girl doesn’t move.
Like a dead cow.

205
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:50,093
What, did you kill her?

206
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,063
It’s my turn now.

207
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,583
Where’s the girl?

208
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:24,461
—Where’s the girl, asshole?
—I don’t know.

209
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,214
I don’t know.

210
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:29,466
Choke him.

211
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:43,105
Enough with the party.

212
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,984
I gotta rough this girl up.

213
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:49,194
Gacha wants to know
if she knows something.

214
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:51,781
Gacha’s paranoid.

215
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:57,494
Wait a second …
I don’t like them bruised.

216
00:33:57,578 --> 00:33:59,956
Let me have a little more fun,
then I’ll let her go.

217
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,832
It’s all right, boys.

218
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,001
This one’s for all of you!

219
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,295
Slap her around!

220
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:24,981
—Should I tell him?
—No.

221
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,190
Remember what Carrillo said.

222
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,234
Sorry, I don’t speak English.

223
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:43,624
—How far is it?
—Come on, you piece of shit.

224
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,180
Helena?

225
00:35:44,018 --> 00:35:46,103
I’m going to get you out of here, OK?

226
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:49,231
I promise.

227
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:08,834
All right. She’s coming out.

228
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,132
Copy, Major.

229
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:16,299
Let’s go, boys.

230
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:36,820
—Where’s Peña?
—Over there.

231
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:20,090
“Deliver Marta Ochoa safe and sound …
or your family is next.”

232
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:23,135
Signed, “Death to Kidnappers.”

233
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:31,518
Please! Please, let me go.

234
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:34,104
—Hurry up!
—Please, don’t!

235
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:56,960
—Tell him to get a little closer.
—A little closer.

236
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:58,921
A little closer!

237
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:01,757
You know what, boss?
Go a little higher.

238
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:05,928
A little bit higher and a little bit
closer so you can see the tree!

239
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,513
That’s it.

240
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:14,686
Now a little bit higher …
so you can see the little tree!

241
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,025
DEATH TO KIDNAPPERS

242
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:21,777
A little more.

243
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,863
That’s it! There you go.

244
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:29,201
—Much better.
—Yes, boss.

245
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:39,878
Didn’t I tell you
not to let anyone into the park?

246
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:42,131
—I’ll take care of it.
—Are you crazy or what?

247
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:44,174
Stupid asshole.

248
00:39:44,258 --> 00:39:46,009
It’s a woman with a baby.

249
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:50,806
Take a picture
so we can send it to the newspapers.

250
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,057
Do it.

251
00:39:52,141 --> 00:39:54,101
Good day, ma’am.

252
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:58,396
—Good day.
—I’m sorry, but the park is closed today.

253
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,440
What do you mean the park is closed?

254
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,609
May I escort you out?

255
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:05,154
Why is it closed?
I come by here every day.

256
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:10,408
It’s because there is a foul odour
and I don’t want the child to get sick.

257
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:12,702
I thought I smelled something.

258
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:14,204
—Right?
—Yes.

259
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:15,998
Oh, look,
what a beautiful little baby.

260
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:18,541
Right, just like his dad.
Thank you very much.

261
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:21,670
—You must be proud.
—Yes, of course.

262
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:24,840
My wife and I are having a baby very soon.

263
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,217
Oh, very good. Congratulations!

264
00:40:27,301 --> 00:40:30,179
I don’t know if it’s a boy or a girl,
but as long as it’s healthy.

265
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:34,808
Yes, of course.
The most important thing is health.

266
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:57,914
Hey, Don Pablo.

267
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,584
What do you want us to do
with this guy?

268
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:05,755
Should I kill him or what?

269
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,850
From what I can see,
you’re not going to stop.

270
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:20,812
Here I am,
so you can finish what you started …

271
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:24,900
but with the sword of Bolívar.

272
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:54,930
It’s a very beautiful gift.
Thank you very much.

273
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:00,810
Stand up.

274
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:10,653
I guarantee no harm
will come to you or your family.

275
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:18,787
From now on,
we are going to work together.

276
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,963
Go in peace, brother.

277
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,314
Is that what I think it is?

278
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:47,983
You’ve gotta be kidding.

279
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,200
I want you to run
my day-to-day operations.

280
00:42:59,453 --> 00:43:01,788
And you’ll do what?

281
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:06,168
Liberate Colombia.
