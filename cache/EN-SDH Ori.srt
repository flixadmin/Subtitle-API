GRAMMA: In the beginning...

2
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,683
there was only ocean...

3
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:03,812
until the mother island emerged.

4
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,814
Te Fiti.

5
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:10,194
Her heart held the greatest power
ever known.

6
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:13,322
It could create life itself.

7
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,701
And Te Fiti shared it with the world.

8
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,371
But in time...

9
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,541
some began to seek Te Fiti's heart.

10
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,835
They believed
if they could possess it...

11
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:30,631
the great power of creation
would be theirs.

12
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,175
And one day...

13
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:36,303
the most daring of them all...

14
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:40,849
voyaged across the vast ocean
to take it.

15
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:47,022
He was a demigod of the wind and sea.

16
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,067
He was a warrior.

17
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,569
A trickster.

18
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:57,241
A shapeshifter who
could change form...

19
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,036
with the power of his magical fish hook.

20
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,373
And his name...

21
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,417
was Maui.

(RUMBLING)

24
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:21,390
But without her heart,
Te Fiti began to crumble...

25
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,309
giving birth to a terrible darkness.

26
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,371
Maui tried to escape...

27
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,916
but was confronted by another
who sought the heart.

28
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,421
Te Ka!

29
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,591
A demon of earth and fire.

30
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,101
Maui was struck from the sky...

31
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,688
never to be seen again.

32
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:14,943
And his magical fish hook
and the heart of Te Fiti...

33
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,905
were lost to the sea.

34
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,240
Where, even now...

35
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,367
1,000 years later...

36
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,120
Te Ka and the demons of the deep...

37
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,289
still hunt for the heart.

38
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:31,793
Hiding in a darkness
that will continue to spread...

39
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,254
chasing away our fish...

40
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:37,633
draining the life
from island after island...

41
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,053
until every one of us is devoured...

42
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,889

43
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,808

(WAILING)

45
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,649
But one day...

46
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,817
the heart will be found...

47
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:59,071
by someone who will journey
beyond our reef...

48
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,572
find Maui...

49
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,824
deliver him across the great ocean...

50
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,160
to restore Te Fiti's heart...

51
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,995
and save us all.

52
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,706

No one goes outside the reef.

We are safe here. There is no darkness.

56
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,839
There are no monsters.

57
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:21,802
Monsters!

58
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,012
- There's no monsters, no monsters...
- It's the darkness!

59
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:28,183
No, there is nothing beyond our reef,
but storms and rough seas.

The village of Motunui is all you need

They dance to an ancient song

When you're gonna look around
And realize happiness is

Where you are

105

- The what
- Consider its tree

We make our nets from the fibers

The water is sweet inside

110

We use the leaves to build fires
We cook up the meat inside

111

Consider the coconuts

The trunks and the leaves

113
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,716
The island gives us what we need

00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,635
And no one leaves

115
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,262
That's right, we stay

00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,055
We're safe and we're well-provided

117
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,140
And when we look to the future

118
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,809
There you are

119
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,645
You'll be okay

120
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,605
In time you'll learn just as I did

121
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:29,484
You must find happiness
right where you are

122
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:39,995
I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves

123
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:44,165
The water is mischievous
Ha! I like how it misbehaves

124
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:48,253
The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far

Well, there you are

Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside

128
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,772
And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star

129
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,443
Moana, that voice inside
is who you are

130
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,531
- Uh-huh.
- Dad!

131
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:20,160

I wasn't gonna get on 'em.

Come on.
There's something I need to show you.

134
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:33,048
I've wanted to bring you here from
the moment you opened your eyes.

135
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,717
This is a sacred place.

136
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,886
A place of chiefs.

137
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,554
There will come a time...

138
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:44,684
when you will stand on this peak
and place a stone on this mountain.

139
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,395
Like I did. Like my father did.

140
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:51,566
And his father, and every chief
that has ever been.

141
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,735
And on that day...

142
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,154
when you add your stone...

143
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,866
you will raise this whole island higher.

144
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,827
You are the future of our people, Moana.

145
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,538
And they are not out there.

146

They are right here.

147
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,920
It's time to be who they need you to be.

- The water is sweet inside
- A real tasty treat inside

150

- We use the leaves to build fires
- We sing these songs in our choirs

00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,930
- To cook up the meat inside
- We have mouths to feed inside

152
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,932
- The village believes in us
- That's right

The village believes

154

The island gives us what we need

And no one leaves

156

We'll build our future together

00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:02,033
Fish pee in you all day!

499
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,326
So...

00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,245
(HEIHEl CLUCKING)

501
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,341
Maui?

502
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,850
Maui!

503
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,606
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea...

504
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,482
I am Moana of Motunui.

505
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,193
You will board my boat.

506
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,278
No. You will board my boat.

507
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,198
Yeah. I am Moana of Motunui.

508
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,117
You will board my...

509
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,369
Boat! A boat!

510
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,206
The gods have given me a...

511
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,290

(MOANA CLEARS THROAT)

513
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,138
Maui, shapeshifter...

514
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,432
demigod of the wind and sea...

515
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,601
- I am Moana of...
- Hero of men.

516
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,186
What?

517
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,813
It's actually, Maui, shapeshifter,
demigod of the wind and sea...

518
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,148
hero of men.

519
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,235
I interrupted.
From the top. Hero of men. Go.

520
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,196
I am...

521
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,530
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

522
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,991
And women. Men and women.

523
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,159
Both. All.

524
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,911
Not a guy, girl thing.

525
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,829
You know, Maui is a hero to all.

526
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,164
You're doing great.
(CLICKS TONGUE)

527
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,041
What? No! I'm here to...

528
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,584
Of course.

529
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,919
Yes, yes, yes.

530
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,880
Maui always has time for his fans.

531
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,424
When you use a bird to write with...

532
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,344
it's called tweeting.

533
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,850
(CHUCKLES) I know, not every day
you get a chance to meet your hero.

534
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,853
You are not my hero.

535
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,564
And I'm not here
so you can sign my oar!

536
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:59,359
I'm here 'cause
you stole the heart of Te Fiti!

537
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,569
And you will board my boat...

538
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,906
and sail across the sea and put it back!

539
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,116
Um...

540
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,952
Yeah, it almost sounded
like you don't like me...

541
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,037
which is impossible because...

542
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:12,998
I got stuck here for 1,000 years...

543
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:15,417
trying to get the heart
as a gift for you mortals.

544
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:18,878
So you could have the power
to create life itself.

545
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:22,424
Yeah. So, what I believe
you were trying to say...

546
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:23,591
is "thank you. "

547
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,218
- "Thank you?"
- You're welcome.

548
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,386
What? No, no, no!

549
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,887
I didn't... I wasn't...

550
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,097
Why would I ever say that?

551
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,473
Okay, okay.

552
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:34,436
I see what's happening
Yeah

553
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:37,564
You're face to face with greatness
and it's strange

554
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,316
You don't even know how you feel

555
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,109
It's adorable

556
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:44,154
Well it's nice to see that humans
never change

557
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,574
Open your eyes
Let's begin

558
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:48,783
Yes, it's really me

559
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,910
It's Maui
Breathe it in

560
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,746
I know it's a lot

561
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,831
The hair
The bod

562
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,751
When you're staring at a demigod

563
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,587
What can I say except

564
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:01,755
You're welcome

565
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,258
For the tides, the sun, the sky

566
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,761
Hey, it's okay, it's okay

567
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,596
You're welcome

568
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,640
I'm just an ordinary demiguy
Hey!

569
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,935
What has two thumbs
and pulled up the sky

570
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,937
When you were waddling yay high?

571
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,230
This guy

572
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:23,735
When the nights got cold
Who stole you fire from down below?

573
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:26,112
You're looking at him yo

574
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,949
Oh also I lassoed the sun

575
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,409
You're welcome

576
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,953
To stretch your days and bring you fun

577
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,915
Also I harnessed the breeze

578
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,333
You're welcome

579
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,794
To fill your sails and shake your trees

580
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:44,923
So what can I say except
You're welcome

581
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,550
For the islands I pulled from the sea

582
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,345
There's no need to pray
It's okay

583
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,846
You're welcome

584
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:55,809
Ha
I guess it's just my way of being me

585
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:56,976
You're welcome

586
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,270
You're welcome

587
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:00,980
Well come to think of it

588
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,233
Kid, honestly I could go on and on

589
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,068
I could explain every
natural phenomenon

590
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,488
The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh that was Maui just messing around

591
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,490
I killed an eel
I buried its guts

592
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,991
Sprouted a tree
Now you got coconuts

593
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,952
What's the lesson?
What is the take away?

594
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:15,703
Don't mess with Maui
when he's on a breakaway

595
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:19,040
And the tapestry here on my skin
Is a map of the victories I win

596
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,000
Look where I've been
I make everything happen

597
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,461
Look at that
Mean Mini-Maui just tickety tappin'

598
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,171
Ha ha
Ha ha

599
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,215
Ha ha
Hey

600
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:30,343
Well anyway let me say
You're welcome

601
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,678
You're welcome

602
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,472
For the wonderful world you know

603
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,517
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
You're welcome

604
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:38,726
You're welcome

605
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,521
Well come to think of it
I gotta go

606
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,566
Hey it's your day to say
You're welcome

607
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:45,859
You're welcome

608
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,528
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat

609
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,781
I'm sailing away away
You're welcome

610
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,907
You're welcome

611
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,326
'Cause Maui can do
everything but float

612
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,370
- You're welcome
- You're welcome

613
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,706
- You're welcome
- You're welcome

614
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:00,874
Huh?

615
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,208
And thank you!

616
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,127
Hey!

617
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,714
Let me out! You lying, slimy son of a...

(HUMMING)

619
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,384
You're welcome

620
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,512
You're so welcome.

621
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,353
No. I'm not going to Te Fiti
with some kid.

622
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,438
I'm going to get my hook.

623
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,732
You have yours and
I'm not Maui without mine.

624
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,110
Okay, talk to the back.

625
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,075
Boat snack.

626
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,286
(SCREAMING)

627
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:05,730
Good riddance,
you filthy pile of pebbles.

628
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,566
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't look at me like that.

629
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:11,277
It's a beautiful cave.
She's gonna love it.

630
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:15,031
And I'm going to love you in ma belly.

631
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:17,617
Now, let's fatten you up, drumstick.

632
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,142
I could watch that all day.

633
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,978
Okay. Enjoy the island.

634
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,479
Maui, out.

635
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,064
No! Stop!

636
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,149
Hey! You have to put back the heart!

637
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:06,749
(CLUCKS)

638
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,418
Did not see that coming.

639
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:13,590
I am Moana of Motunui.

640
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,091
This is my canoe...

641
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,843
and you will journey to...

642
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,723
All right, get over it. We gotta move.

643
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:24,934
And she's back.

644
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,645
I am Moana of Motunui...

645
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:33,985
It was Moana, right?

646
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,194
Yes.

647
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,864
And you will restore the heart!

648
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,376
All right. I'm out.

649
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:56,883
Oh, come on!

650
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,552
What is your problem?

651
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,056
Are you afraid of it?

652
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,724
No! No.

653
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,267
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
I'm not afraid.

654
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,231
Stay out of it
or you're sleeping in my armpit.

655
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,399
You, stop it.

656
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:16,235
That is not a heart. It is a curse.

657
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,529
The second I took it,
I got blasted outta the sky...

658
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:19,864
and I lost my hook.

659
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,199
Get it away from me.

660
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,034
Get this away?

661
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,161
Hey, hey, hey! I'm a demigod, okay?

662
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,996
Stop that. I will smite you!

663
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,831
You wanna get smote?

664
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:29,999
Smotten?

665
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,670
Listen, that thing doesn't give you
power to create life...

666
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,546
it's a homing beacon of death.

667
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:38,007
If you don't put it away,
bad things are gonna come for it.

668
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,176
Come for this? The heart?

669
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:41,386
You mean this heart right here?

670
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,470
Don't, you can't
raise your voice like that!

673
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:49,102
No, I'm gonna get us to Te Fiti,
so you can put it back.

00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:50,269
Thank you.

You're welcome.

Kaka-what?

678
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,613
Murdering little pirates.

679
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:04,200
Wonder what they're here for.

680
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,915
They're kinda cute.

681

Do something! Help us!

The ocean doesn't help you,
you help yourself!

Tighten the halyard. Bind the stays!

I am self-taught.

688

Can't you shapeshift or something?

689
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,044
Do you see my hook?

690
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,796
No magic hook, no magic powers!

The heart!

Forget it! You'll never get it back!

Besides, you got a better one.

What am I gonna steer with?

Hey!

00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,489
We did it!

Congratulations
on not being dead, girlie.

719
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,535
You surprise me.

720
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,913
But I'm still not taking that thing back.

721

You wanna get to Te Fiti you gotta
go through a whole ocean of bad.

722
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:24,961
Not to mention Te Ka.

723

Lava monster?

724
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,049
Ever defeat a lava monster?

725
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,927
No. Have you?

726
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:43,646
I'm not going on a suicide mission
with some mortal.

727
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:47,024
You can't restore the heart without me...

728
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,943
and me says no.

729
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,404
I'm getting my hook.

End of discussion.

That's what you're all about, right?

733
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,797
Little girl, I am a hero.

734
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,424
Maybe you were.

735
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:12,717
But now...

736
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:15,803
now you're just the guy
who stole the heart of Te Fiti.

737
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,264
The guy who cursed the world.

738
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,017
You're no one's hero.

739

(SCOFFS) No one?

740
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,029
But...

741
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:35,197
put this back...

742
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,116
save the world...

743
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,285
you'd be everyone's hero.

Maui! Maui! Maui!

745
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,462
You're so amazing!

746
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,757
We'd never make it without my hook.
Not past Te Ka.

747
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:54,008
Then we get your hook.

748
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:57,887
We get your hook, take out Te Ka,
restore the heart.

749
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,681
Unless you don't wanna be...

750
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:03,976
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea.

751
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,644

First, we get my hook.

754
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:14,236
Then save the world.

Deal?

756
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,447
Deal.

757
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:21,869
Worth a shot.

758
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,705
Okay, we go east.

759
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,041
To the lair of Tamatoa.

760
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:32,671
If anyone has my hook,
it's that beady-eyed bottom-feeder.

761
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,560
Teach me to sail.

762
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:52,233
My job is to deliver Maui
across the great ocean.

763
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,400
I should...

764
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,695
I should be sailing.

765
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,864
It's called wayfinding, princess.

766
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,408
And it's not just sails and knots...

767
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:04,203
it's seeing where you're going
in your mind.

768
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,413
Knowing where you are...

769
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:08,165
by knowing where you've been.

770
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,668
Okay, first, I'm not a princess.

771
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,294
I am the daughter of the chief.

772
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,629
- Same difference.
- No.

773
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:16,423
If you wear a dress,
and you have an animal sidekick...

774
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:17,716
you're a princess.

775
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,093
You are not a wayfinder.

776

You will never be a wayfinder,
you will never be a...

You're measuring the stars,
not giving the sky a high-five.

If the ocean's so smart...

why didn't it just take the heart
back to Te Fiti itself?

993
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:09,636
But your armor's just not hard enough

994
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:13,598
Maui
Now it's time to kick your heinie

995
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:17,394
Ever seen someone so shiny

996
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:20,689
Soak it in
'Cause it's the last you'll ever see

997
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:22,440
C'est la vie
Mon ami

998
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,109
I'm so shiny

999
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:27,070
Now I eat you so
prepare your final plea

1000
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,363
Just for me

1001
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:32,117
You'll never be quite as shiny

1002
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:36,454
You wish you were nice and shiny

1003
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:40,333
- MOANA: Hey!
- Huh?

1004
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:42,794
I got something shiny for ya!

1005
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:47,299
The heart of Te Fiti.

1006
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:49,801
You can't run from me!

1007
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:51,970
Oh, you can. You keep surprising me.

1008
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,683
There's only so far you can get
on those two little legs.

1009
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:58,518
(YELLS)

1010
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:01,605
(LAUGHING)

1011
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:03,440
The power of creation...

1012
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:05,275
for a crustacean.

1013
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:06,902
Where is it? Where is it?

1014
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,154
We gotta go!

1015
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:10,822
What about the heart?

1016
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:13,491
He can have it. I've got a better one.

1017
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:16,161
Yes, I have the...

1018
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:17,329
Wait a minute.

1019
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,332
I see, she's taken a barnacle
and she's covered it in...

1020
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:23,668
bioluminescent algae as a diversion.

1021
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,047
Come back here!

1022
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:33,845
Cheeeehoooo!

1023
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:35,972
Hey!

1024
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:37,682
Did you like the song?

1025
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:44,773
(THUDDING)

1026
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:46,566
We're alive!

1027
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:47,734
We're alive!

1028
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:50,695
Listen...

1029
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:52,781
I appreciate what you did down there.

1030
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,115
Mm-hmm.

1031
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,241
- Took guts.
- Mm-hmm.

1032
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:56,576
- But...
- Mm-hmm.

1033
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:57,744
I'm sorry.

1034
01:05:57,912 --> 01:06:00,956
I'm trying to be sincere for once,
and it feels like you're distracted.

1035
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,041
No, no. No way!

1036
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:05,460
Really? Because you're looking at me
like I have a...

1037
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:06,544
(GASPS)

1038
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:09,547
shark head.

1039
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:12,884
What? Do you have a shark head?

1040
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:14,761
Look, the point is...

1041
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:17,806
for a little girl, child, thing,
whatever...

1042
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,517
who had no business
being down there...

1043
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:22,435
you did me a solid.

1044
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:24,688
But you also almost died.

1045
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:26,898
And I couldn't even beat that dumb crab.

1046
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,234
So, chances of beating Te Ka?

1047
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,568
Bupkis.

1048
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:33,989
We're never making it to Te Fiti.
This mission is cursed.

1049
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:35,407
It's not cursed.

1050
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,117
Shark head.

1051
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:39,995
It is not cursed.

1052
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:46,835
(GROANS)

1053
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:55,176
Cursed.

1054
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:01,433
What can I say except

1055
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,435
We're dead soon

1056
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:05,103
We're dead soon

1057
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:08,064
Can you at least try?

1058
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:12,444
Giant hawk.

1059
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,407
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
We're dead soon

1060
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,201
All right, break time's over.

1061
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:21,369
Get up.

1062
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,872
Why? Are you gonna
give me a speech?

1063
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,792
Tell me I can beat Te Ka
'cause I'm "Maui?"

1064
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:30,628
Take a hike, Tiny.

1065
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:39,137
How do you get your tattoos?

1066
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:41,765
They show up. When I earn them.

1067
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:45,560
How'd you earn that one?
What's that for?

1068
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:49,022
That's man's discovery of Nunya.

1069
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,315
What's Nunya?

1070
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:51,816
Nunya business.

1071
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,778
I'll just keep asking.

1072
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:58,031
What's it for?

1073
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,825
You need to stop doing that.

1074
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,207
- Back off.
- Just tell me what it is.

1075
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:08,833
I said back off.

1076
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:10,668
Is it why your hook's not working?

1077
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:29,437
You don't wanna talk, don't talk.

1078
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:31,856
You wanna throw me off the boat...

1079
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:33,942
throw me off.

1080
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:37,445
You wanna tell me
I don't know what I'm doing...

1081
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,572
I know I don't.

1082
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:43,701
I have no idea why the ocean chose me.

1083
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:45,578
You're right.

1084
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:50,208
But my island is dying...

1085
01:08:51,043 --> 01:08:54,045
so I am here.

1086
01:08:54,713 --> 01:08:57,090
It's just me and you.

1087
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:59,926
And I want to help...

1088
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:04,389
but I can't if you don't let me.

1089
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:09,686
(SIGHS)

1090
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:12,313
MAUl: I wasn't born a demigod.

1091
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:15,108
I had human parents.

1092
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:21,447
They took one look and decided...

1093
01:09:21,615 --> 01:09:24,075
they did not want me.

1094
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,536
They threw me into the sea...

1095
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:30,123
like I was nothing.

1096
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:35,128
Somehow, I was found by the gods.

1097
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:36,921
They gave me the hook.

1098
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,756
They made me...

1099
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:40,592
Maui.

1100
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:44,637
And back to the humans I went.

1101
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:48,975
I gave them islands, fire, coconuts.

1102
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:52,270
Anything they could ever want.

1103
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:55,273
You took the heart for them.

1104
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:58,860
You did everything for them.

1105
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:01,529
So they'd love you.

1106
01:10:02,114 --> 01:10:05,283
It was never enough.

1107
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:16,711
Maybe the gods found you for a reason.

1108
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:20,048
Maybe the ocean brought you to them...

1109
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:24,302
because it saw someone
who was worthy of being saved.

1110
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:29,140
But the gods aren't the ones
who make you Maui.

1111
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:31,059
You are.

1112
01:10:40,527 --> 01:10:42,362
Okay, okay.

1113
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:45,823
I love you, too, buddy.

1114
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:36,874
Cheeeehoooo!

1115
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:52,807
Yeah!

1116
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,625
Next stop, Te Fiti.

1117
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:07,465
What?

1118
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,133
I figured it out.

1119
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:14,180
You know, the ocean used to love
when I pulled up islands...

1120
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:18,142
'cause your ancestors
would sail her seas and find 'em.

1121
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:21,771
All those new lands, new villages.

1122
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:24,607
It was the water that connected 'em all.

1123
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:26,651
And if I were the ocean...

1124
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:30,905
I think I'd be looking for
a curly-haired non-princess...

1125
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:33,491
to start that again.

1126
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:38,037
That is literally the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

1127
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:41,207
Probably should have saved it
for Te Fiti.

1128
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:43,918
I did.

1129
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:48,923
Moana of Motunui...

1130
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:54,720
I believe you have officially
delivered Maui across the great sea.

1131
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:58,349
Moana! Moana! Moana!

1132
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:00,601
You're so amazing!

1133
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:03,396
It's time.

1134
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:23,249
Go save the world.

1135
01:14:24,751 --> 01:14:26,377
Cheeeehoooo!

1136
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:43,561

What are you doing?

1141
01:15:24,144 --> 01:15:25,811
Finding you a better way in!

1142
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:29,190
- We won't make it!
- Yes, we will!

1143
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:30,483
- Turn around!
- No!

1144
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:31,776

1145
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:32,944
No!

1148
01:16:04,184 --> 01:16:05,184
Maui?

1149
01:16:13,026 --> 01:16:14,944
I told you to turn back.

1150
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:18,990
I thought we could make it.

1151

We?

1152
01:16:21,868 --> 01:16:23,953
I thought I could make it.

1153
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:27,039
We can fix it.

1154
01:16:27,207 --> 01:16:29,333
It was made by the gods.

1155
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:31,252
You can't fix it!

1157

Te Ka was stuck on the barrier islands.

1158

One more hit, and it's over.

1164
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:51,314
Maui, you have to restore the heart.

1165

Without my hook, I am nothing.

you're something you're not!

1178

...and restore the heart of Te Fiti!

1179

I'm not the right person.

1184

You have to choose someone else.

1185
01:18:17,776 --> 01:18:20,319

It's not your fault.

I never should have put so much
on your shoulders.

I will be with you.

1201
01:19:59,544 --> 01:20:01,879
I know a girl from an island

1202
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:05,591
She stands apart from the crowd

1203
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:09,053
She loves the sea and her people

1204
01:20:09,554 --> 01:20:11,722
She makes her whole family proud

1205

Sometimes the world
seems against you

1206

Where you are

1209
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:28,739
The people you love will change you

1210
01:20:29,115 --> 01:20:31,992
The things you have
learned will guide you

1211
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:35,579
And nothing on earth can silence

1212
01:20:35,747 --> 01:20:38,749
The quiet voice still inside you

1213
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:42,419
And when that voice starts to whisper

1214
01:20:42,587 --> 01:20:45,256
Moana, you've come so far

1215
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:47,758

Do you know who you are?

Who am I?

1218
01:20:58,311 --> 01:21:01,772
I am a girl who loves my island

1219
01:21:02,148 --> 01:21:05,734
And the girl who loves the sea

1220
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:09,196
It calls me

1221
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:14,159
I am the daughter of the village chief

1222
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:17,580
We are descended from voyagers

1223

Who found their way across the world

1224

They call me

1225
01:21:24,462 --> 01:21:26,964
I've delivered us to where we are

1226
01:21:27,632 --> 01:21:30,301
I have journeyed farther

1227
01:21:30,802 --> 01:21:33,178
I am everything I've learned and more

1228
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,347
Still it calls me

1229
01:21:37,517 --> 01:21:39,810
And the call isn't out there at all

1230

It's inside me

1231
01:21:43,189 --> 01:21:45,149
It's like the tide

1232
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:49,570
Always falling and rising

1233
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:52,489
I will carry you here in my heart

1234

01:34:34,877 --> 01:34:35,919
MALE VILLAGER: She's back!

1324
01:34:36,087 --> 01:34:37,087

1325
01:34:37,254 --> 01:34:38,254
MOANA: Pua!

1326
01:34:40,257 --> 01:34:41,257
Moana!

1327
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:44,844
Welcome home!

(VILLAGERS CHEERING)

1329
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:36,938
We set a course to find

1330
01:35:37,106 --> 01:35:41,359
A brand new island
everywhere we roam

1331
01:35:43,654 --> 01:35:46,030
We keep our island in our mind

1332
01:35:46,574 --> 01:35:50,785
And when it's time to find home
We know the way

1333
01:35:52,496 --> 01:35:55,498
We are explorers reading every sign

1334
01:35:56,125 --> 01:36:00,336
We tell the stories of our elders
In a never-ending chain

1335
01:36:07,928 --> 01:36:12,599
We know the way

1336
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:22,817
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1337
01:46:07,527 --> 01:46:08,903
Shiny

1338
01:46:09,446 --> 01:46:11,947
I'm so shiny

1339
01:46:12,574 --> 01:46:14,367
Didn't help me though, did it?

1340
01:46:14,534 --> 01:46:16,494
Still upside down here.

1341
01:46:16,661 --> 01:46:18,913
Just need a little push.

1342
01:46:19,456 --> 01:46:20,456
(GROANS)

1343
01:46:21,083 --> 01:46:22,083
Can we be real?

1344
01:46:22,250 --> 01:46:25,628
If my name was Sebastian
and I had a cool Jamaican accent...

1345
01:46:25,796 --> 01:46:27,004
you'd totally help me.

1346
01:46:27,172 --> 01:46:28,798
You would. You know you would.
