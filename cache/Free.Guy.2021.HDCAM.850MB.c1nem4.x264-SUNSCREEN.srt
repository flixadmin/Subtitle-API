00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,085
<i>This is Free City.</i>

3
00:00:52,527 --> 00:00:56,362
<i>Look at this guy.
He's one of the sunglasses people.</i>

4
00:00:56,395 --> 00:00:59,695
<i>And the people who wear
sunglasses are heroes.</i>

5
00:01:05,996 --> 00:01:09,729
<i>They have a devil-may-care
attitude and they run this town.</i>

6
00:01:12,788 --> 00:01:14,254
You are so hot.

7
00:01:14,398 --> 00:01:15,398
Oh, I know.

8
00:01:18,402 --> 00:01:21,237
<i>See?
That's not even his car.</i>

9
00:01:22,224 --> 00:01:23,424
<i>Or his wife.</i>

10
00:01:29,334 --> 00:01:32,899
<i>For the sunglasses people,
they get to do anything they want.</i>

11
00:01:32,986 --> 00:01:35,020
<i>They go on
all sorts of missions.</i>

12
00:01:35,085 --> 00:01:37,620
<i>They got cool hair,
cool clothes.</i>

13
00:01:37,683 --> 00:01:42,894
<i>I mean, laws aren't really laws to them.
They're more like mild suggestions.</i>

14
00:01:42,956 --> 00:01:45,956
<i>Like, I don't think
he's gonna return that car.</i>

15
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,669
<i>Or that nice lady.</i>

16
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:05,845
<i>See what I mean? Hero.</i>

17
00:02:20,415 --> 00:02:24,949
<i>My name is Guy,
and I live in paradise.</i>

18
00:02:29,954 --> 00:02:31,520
Good morning, Goldie.

19
00:02:33,562 --> 00:02:35,562
<i>I've lived here in Free City
my whole life.</i>

20
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,286
<i>I've got a best friend,
I've got a goldfish,</i>

21
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,757
<i>and I work at the bank.</i>

22
00:02:40,846 --> 00:02:42,180
<i>What more could a guy want?</i>

23
00:02:42,272 --> 00:02:43,639
<i>Sunday
should be warm and sunny</i>

24
00:02:43,703 --> 00:02:45,237
<i>with just a scattering
of drive-bys.</i>

25
00:02:45,372 --> 00:02:47,771
<i>Great day for the beach,
but not Hitman's Beach,</i>

26
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,997
<i>which will be mined and
sprayed with high-caliber fire</i>

27
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,411
<i>from a renegade
gunship stolen by...</i>

28
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,474
<i>And every morning,</i>

29
00:02:52,566 --> 00:02:55,451
<i>I start my day
with the most delicious coffee</i>

30
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:57,846
<i>in the whole,
wide, whole world.</i>

31
00:02:57,925 --> 00:02:59,591
Medium coffee,
cream, two sugars.

32
00:02:59,671 --> 00:03:01,104
You know it. Mmm.

33
00:03:02,107 --> 00:03:03,707
Mmm!

34
00:03:03,928 --> 00:03:05,796
That is unexpectedly hot.

35
00:03:05,828 --> 00:03:07,228
Jeez, that's good.

36
00:03:07,262 --> 00:03:10,362
It's like losing my virginity,
but in my mouth.

37
00:03:12,295 --> 00:03:14,513
Thank you for making
this with such love.

38
00:03:14,615 --> 00:03:15,714
You're welcome.

39
00:03:15,888 --> 00:03:17,021
Officer Johnny!

40
00:03:17,094 --> 00:03:18,295
Have a good one, Guy.

41
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:21,696
Don't have a good day,
have a great day!

42
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:23,368
Hold the fudge.

43
00:03:23,435 --> 00:03:27,078
You mean to tell me that nobody snabbed
up those bad boys? Today is the day.

44
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,832
- Like every other day.
- I'll be back for those.

45
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:37,411
Oh! So close.

46
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:40,769
Mmm! This is the greatest
cup of coffee of all time.

47
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:42,076
I wanna write
a song about it.

48
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,071
I wanna dance to
that song with my body.

49
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,301
I love my life.

50
00:03:45,332 --> 00:03:47,243
There's something about finding
your lane and just staying in it.

51
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:49,778
That's why they call 'em comfort
zones, they're so damn comfortable.

52
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:52,413
Oh, Joe!

53
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:55,871
Mondays, am I right, Joe?

54
00:03:55,941 --> 00:03:57,941
- You said it, Guy.
- Yeah.

55
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:04,291
<i>In Free City,
I have everything I need.</i>

56
00:04:04,354 --> 00:04:05,912
Don't have a good day...

57
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:08,245
have a great day.

58
00:04:08,278 --> 00:04:09,779
Thank you.

59
00:04:09,812 --> 00:04:10,729
Take care.

60
00:04:10,788 --> 00:04:13,522
<i>Except one thing.</i>

61
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,033
Seem happy.

62
00:04:16,146 --> 00:04:18,377
Oh, come on, don't worry about that, Guy.
You gonna find someone.

63
00:04:18,411 --> 00:04:19,912
Oh, it's okay, Bud.

64
00:04:19,945 --> 00:04:22,745
Feel like I've been looking
for her forever, you know?

65
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:24,278
Maybe it's not meant to be.

66
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,012
Everybody down on the ground!

67
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:36,012
- I know the woman I'm looking for.
- Oh, let me guess.

68
00:04:36,046 --> 00:04:37,783
- A woman with an offbeat sense of humor.
- Sense of humor.

69
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,153
An obsession
with feel-good diva pop.

70
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:40,370
Diva pop. Yes, that's her.

71
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:42,270
She's rented space in my brain
and she won't move out.

72
00:04:42,306 --> 00:04:44,406
And you know what?
I don't want her to.

73
00:04:44,498 --> 00:04:46,967
Well, guess what?
She won't move either in or out.

74
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:48,570
You know why?
'Cause she doesn't exist.

75
00:04:48,606 --> 00:04:50,621
- She's just a fantasy. It's a fantasy.
- That's cruel. You're cruel.

76
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,324
- You're being rotten right now. Rotten.
- I'm being real.

77
00:04:52,423 --> 00:04:55,499
Nobody try to be a hero.
This will all be over soon.

78
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,744
So how about it?
Beers on the beach after work?

79
00:04:58,827 --> 00:05:00,585
Of course we're going for
beers on the beach after work.

80
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:01,971
That makes me
so happy.

81
00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:03,074
Me too.

82
00:05:15,434 --> 00:05:16,338
What have you got?

83
00:05:16,374 --> 00:05:18,931
Proof of a secret level.
That's what you're looking for, right?

84
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:20,733
You got a video
or a screen grab?

85
00:05:20,823 --> 00:05:22,345
Nope. But I know who does.

86
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:24,649
Wanna know what I do to people
who waste my time?

87
00:05:24,685 --> 00:05:27,024
Oh, wow. Ooh,
someone wants to play.

88
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:29,329
Hey, you really British,
or is that an accent filter?

89
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:31,231
'Cause maybe we
could meet up later.

90
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,925
I don't have a burning desire to
see your mum's basement, thanks.

91
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:36,081
Got jokes, huh?

92
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,716
Well, I got a map,
shows the location of his stash house.

93
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:43,501
Don't know how you'll get in, but if
you do, clip 56 might interest you.

94
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:44,981
Now, I got a question.

95
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,259
What's so special
about this video clip anyway?

96
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,683
What's special is I kill people
who ask questions about it.

97
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,685
Mmm, I see. Fun.
Yeah, that's fun.

98
00:05:54,503 --> 00:05:56,937
Damn, girl, you're so feisty.

99
00:05:57,095 --> 00:05:59,995
But seriously, is it loot
or is it just the experience?

100
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,226
Those are questions.

101
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,539
Did you see the sneakers
on that last robber?

102
00:06:36,612 --> 00:06:37,746
The 2:30?

103
00:06:37,782 --> 00:06:39,382
No, the 4:00.

104
00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:42,719
The three-quarter high-top,
gorgeous foam soles.

105
00:06:42,755 --> 00:06:44,706
I could barely feel it
when he stepped on my face.

106
00:06:44,742 --> 00:06:46,075
- Oh, man.
- Wow.

107
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:48,789
Life in the big city.
Ain't nothing like it.

108
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:49,697
Give it to me!

109
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:51,130
Looks like rain.

110
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:53,499
Has anyone seen my cat?

111
00:06:55,928 --> 00:06:58,006
You know something, Guy,
people say it all the time, like,

112
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:01,323
"Guy can take a shoe to the face
better than anybody I know."

113
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:03,764
I mean, when you put it on there,
you act like it's not a shoe in your face.

114
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:15,778
Don't have a good day,
have a great day.

115
00:07:15,814 --> 00:07:16,948
Love that song.

116
00:07:20,547 --> 00:07:21,915
That's a new one.

117
00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:35,565
Hey!

118
00:07:37,578 --> 00:07:38,645
That's her.

119
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:40,210
Her who?

120
00:07:40,245 --> 00:07:42,145
That's my dream girl, Buddy.

121
00:07:42,177 --> 00:07:43,745
She exists.

122
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:47,245
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

123
00:07:47,278 --> 00:07:49,612
Wait, man.
She's wearing sunglasses.

124
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:51,679
So?

125
00:07:51,712 --> 00:07:52,879
Whatcha mean "so?"

126
00:07:52,912 --> 00:07:54,745
So, people with sunglasses
don't talk to people like us.

127
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:57,046
- You know that!
- I gotta try.

128
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,645
Look, Guy! Guy!

129
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,512
Guy! What about
beers on the beach?

130
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:05,845
Excuse me!

131
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:10,779
Hey!

132
00:08:12,378 --> 00:08:13,378
Hey!

133
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:25,853
<i>Coming soon...</i> Free City 2!

00:08:29,653 --> 00:08:31,454

137
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,187
You done?

138
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,686
Sorry. Are you closing?

139
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,853
Yes.

140
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40,653
We usually don't
put the chairs on the tables,

141
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,120
one-small-coffee-
over-four-hours girl.

142
00:08:43,153 --> 00:08:46,820
You really like that game, huh?
My 12-year-old nephew's addicted.

143
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:48,686
Seems like everyone's
obsessed with it.

144
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,362
Oh, <i>Free City?</i> Ah. No.

145
00:08:51,444 --> 00:08:54,037
I, uh, have a lawsuit
against the publisher

146
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:55,953
and the evidence that I need
is in the game.

147
00:08:55,987 --> 00:08:57,454
- So then I had my codes...
- Oh...

148
00:08:57,487 --> 00:09:00,454
I wish we weren't closing so
I could hear more about this.

149
00:09:10,686 --> 00:09:12,187
Good morning, Goldie.

150
00:09:17,395 --> 00:09:19,562
Medium coffee,
cream, two sugars.

151
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:22,662
Medium coffee,
cream, two sugars.

152
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:29,129
Actually, I think I'd like
to try a cappuccino today.

153
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:32,662
Ooh. "Cappuccino."
I enjoy saying that.

154
00:09:32,695 --> 00:09:35,261
It's like a waterfall
made of letters.

155
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:36,461
Excuse me?

156
00:09:36,495 --> 00:09:38,695
I'd like to try a cappuccino.

157
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:41,493
- Please.
- But you get a medium coffee, cream, two sugars.

158
00:09:41,591 --> 00:09:43,691
That's what you get.
That's what everyone gets.

159
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:45,193
Every day. Always.

160
00:09:45,229 --> 00:09:47,429
- Well, I...
- Somebody's about to get shot.

161
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,379
Officer Johnny.

162
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,829
I just thought I'd try something
different today, you know?

163
00:09:53,604 --> 00:09:55,570
Whatever. Right? Yeah?

164
00:09:59,112 --> 00:10:00,112
Hi.

165
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:04,479
Ha! I'm just keeping
you on your toes.

166
00:10:05,545 --> 00:10:07,778
Coffee, cream,
two sugars, please.

167
00:10:07,811 --> 00:10:09,712
I'm joking.

168
00:10:09,746 --> 00:10:11,712
Just keeping you on your toes.
I was kidding.

169
00:10:11,746 --> 00:10:13,245
He was just kidding!

170
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,445
Oh, you think I'd deprive myself
of your baristic artistry?

171
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:17,678
No way, no how.

172
00:10:17,712 --> 00:10:20,312
Mmm. That's hot.

173
00:10:20,345 --> 00:10:23,911
It's like Jesus
washed my tongue...

174
00:10:23,945 --> 00:10:26,811
but right before he finished,
he finally told my dad,

175
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:29,545
"He's good enough."

176
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:33,445
Thank you so much.
Officer Johnny!

177
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:34,479
Have a good one, Guy.

178
00:10:39,387 --> 00:10:41,020
Cappuccino.

179
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:43,953
Don't have a good day...

180
00:10:44,528 --> 00:10:46,661
...have a great day, I guess.

181
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:50,795
Okay. Good day to you.

182
00:10:50,828 --> 00:10:53,762
Everybody down on the ground!

183
00:10:53,795 --> 00:10:56,628
Nobody try to be a hero.
This will all be over soon.

184
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:23,345
That's the girl.

185
00:11:23,378 --> 00:11:24,745
We've been over this.

186
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,411
You tried to talk to her
yesterday, it didn't work.

187
00:11:26,445 --> 00:11:28,078
It will never work.

188
00:11:28,112 --> 00:11:29,378
She's wearing sunglasses.

189
00:11:29,411 --> 00:11:30,845
We don't mess with
the sunglasses people.

190
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,912
Maybe I'll get
some sunglasses of my own.

191
00:11:32,945 --> 00:11:34,246
What? What are you talking about?
You can't do that.

192
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:35,845
Oh, my God. What am I doing?

193
00:11:36,587 --> 00:11:37,687
Hi.

194
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,853
What'd you say?

195
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:41,487
Hi.

196
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,737
I'm gonna need
your sunglasses.

197
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:44,871
Ooh. Ow.

198
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:46,070
I'm just gonna...

199
00:11:46,103 --> 00:11:47,370
I'm gonna need your
sunglasses for a sec.

200
00:11:47,404 --> 00:11:48,871
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

201
00:11:48,903 --> 00:11:50,036
Go back to your side, man.

202
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,303
He's just an NPC.
Waste that mother...

203
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,137
Okay, just need to borrow them
for a sec, okay?

204
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,703
- Back off! I said, don't!
- Just real quick. Real quick.

205
00:11:56,737 --> 00:11:59,470
Stop!

206
00:12:00,045 --> 00:12:01,646
You broken or somethin'?

207
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,746
I'm the robber!

208
00:12:02,778 --> 00:12:04,544
You're the guy who lies down
and takes it!

209
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:05,746
Please, just stay down!

210
00:12:06,845 --> 00:12:08,746
I said, stay down!

211
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:10,112
Guy, you don't do this, man.

212
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:12,511
This isn't you.

213
00:12:12,544 --> 00:12:13,945
You don't do this.

214
00:12:14,521 --> 00:12:16,386
Maybe I do.

215
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:19,087
What is wrong with this...

216
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,220
stupid mission?

217
00:12:20,254 --> 00:12:21,554
I told you to smoke his ass.

218
00:12:21,587 --> 00:12:22,686
Let go!

219
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,521
I'll give them right back.

220
00:12:24,554 --> 00:12:26,454
I said...

221
00:12:30,995 --> 00:12:32,095
Guy?

222
00:12:36,962 --> 00:12:38,429
He's just resting.

223
00:12:38,462 --> 00:12:39,528
In pieces!

224
00:12:39,561 --> 00:12:41,228
That man is dead!

225
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,129
He's so sleepy.

226
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,937
I'm just gonna
put your gun down...

227
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,069
right here...

228
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:51,136
for when you wake.

229
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,311
- Okay?
- Guy.

230
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:56,545
Guy! Where you goin'?

231
00:13:26,895 --> 00:13:28,029
Excuse me.

232
00:13:29,228 --> 00:13:31,029
Do you see this?

233
00:13:31,062 --> 00:13:33,862
Have the quarterly reports
on my desk by Friday.

234
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:55,928
Whoo!

235
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,069
Oh!

236
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,470
Giddy up!

237
00:14:00,204 --> 00:14:01,603
I feel brand new.

238
00:14:13,012 --> 00:14:14,045
<i>Loser.</i>

239
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:24,844
What is happening?

240
00:14:27,121 --> 00:14:29,286
So much money.

241
00:14:49,028 --> 00:14:50,662
Hey, Mouser,
check this out.

242
00:14:50,695 --> 00:14:51,929
What's up, Keys?

243
00:14:51,962 --> 00:14:53,195
What am I looking at?

244
00:14:53,228 --> 00:14:55,962
Okay, so this user,
he gets his glasses stolen

245
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:57,128
and then killed.

246
00:14:57,161 --> 00:14:59,128
The guy was smoked
by a non-playable character.

247
00:14:59,161 --> 00:15:01,061
An NPC? That's impossible.

248
00:15:01,095 --> 00:15:02,528
Yeah, exactly.

249
00:15:02,561 --> 00:15:04,795
Nobody can equip an NPC skin
on their avatar.

250
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:08,962
Yeah, so you just boot the trash-ass
noob and ban him for life, you're done.

251
00:15:08,996 --> 00:15:11,128
I tried that, but I...

252
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:12,580
I can't trace him.

253
00:15:12,737 --> 00:15:15,903
Whoever it is,
they're good.

254
00:15:15,936 --> 00:15:19,270
Hmm. You gotta be better
at your job, buddy.

255
00:15:20,612 --> 00:15:21,712
I'm pretty good.

256
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:22,911
I'll see you on the inside.

257
00:15:22,945 --> 00:15:24,045
<i>Select your skin.</i>

258
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:26,078
Hey, Keys, what skin
are you going with?

259
00:15:26,112 --> 00:15:27,945
The ushe. Dirty stripper cop,

260
00:15:27,978 --> 00:15:29,311
big guns, bigger mustache.

261
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:31,078
Hmm. Little dirt squirrel.
I like it.

262
00:15:31,112 --> 00:15:33,178
Almost scared to ask,
but what are you going with?

263
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:36,911
Uh, full body mustache, hot pink.
You should be very afraid.

264
00:15:36,945 --> 00:15:38,197
I'm terrified.

265
00:15:38,262 --> 00:15:39,728
Let's do this.

266
00:16:14,662 --> 00:16:16,061
Seriously, man.

267
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:19,295
I'm just being honest, I think the
bunny suit is just a little much.

268
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:21,795
Excuse me?

269
00:16:23,528 --> 00:16:24,762
Right.

270
00:16:24,795 --> 00:16:27,161
Rabbit. Okay? My fault.

271
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:30,695
Hey, 40-year-old virgin!
Get over here!

272
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:31,762
Let's go!

273
00:16:31,795 --> 00:16:33,028
Uh-huh.
Captain Khakis.

274
00:16:33,061 --> 00:16:35,061
- Come here. Come on, bud.
- Go, let's go.

275
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,862
- Closer.
- There he is.

276
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:38,528
Blue shirt guy.

277
00:16:38,996 --> 00:16:40,395
Blue shirt?

278
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:42,095
Yes.

279
00:16:42,528 --> 00:16:44,161
Hello, Officer.

280
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,036
Rabbit.

281
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,369
Nice skin.

282
00:16:47,403 --> 00:16:49,804
Thank you. That's sweet.

283
00:16:49,837 --> 00:16:51,137
How'd you get it?

284
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,704
Well, uh, mostly genetics,
I think. I'm pretty lucky.

285
00:16:54,737 --> 00:16:56,470
I have naturally dewy skin.

286
00:16:56,504 --> 00:16:57,837
Listen up, Neutrogena.

287
00:16:57,871 --> 00:16:59,970
You know you can't go around looking
like that. The rules are clear.

288
00:17:00,003 --> 00:17:01,237
And another thing.

289
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,771
- You can't hack the NPC avatars.
- No, sir!

290
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:04,003
- It screws up the mission load...
- Screws it up!

291
00:17:04,036 --> 00:17:05,237
...and it makes
the game look bad.

292
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,704
- Horrible!
- Yeah.

293
00:17:06,737 --> 00:17:08,804
I got, like, 5% of that.

294
00:17:08,837 --> 00:17:10,404
Lose the skin!

295
00:17:10,437 --> 00:17:11,504
I... Lose?

296
00:17:11,537 --> 00:17:13,537
How am I supposed to
get rid of my skin?

297
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,437
Take it off, man.

298
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,003
Just take it off.
What are you doing?

299
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:17,203
- What?
- Seriously.

300
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:18,771
- The whole thing. The face, the outfit.
- How?

301
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,003
- Everything. Ditch it.
- Take it off.

302
00:17:20,036 --> 00:17:21,336
If you don't,
we're gonna kill you.

303
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:22,709
- Why?
- And we're gonna keep killing you.

304
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:23,703
Still why?

305
00:17:23,737 --> 00:17:25,237
Until we do
find out who you are...

306
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:26,836
and then we're
gonna ban you for life.

307
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:30,204
Okay. No, no.
Okay, I want to comply.

308
00:17:30,237 --> 00:17:32,637
I just find the order of
those threats very confusing.

309
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,371
- Somebody's about to get shot.
- Light him up

310
00:17:50,996 --> 00:17:52,595
No.

311
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:03,686
Come on, Blue Shirt.

312
00:18:23,271 --> 00:18:25,858
Oh! Didn't see that one coming.
Did you see that one coming?

313
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:27,087
Scared me a little bit.

314
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:28,587
We're coming
for you, Blue Shirt!

315
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,087
Coming to get ya.

316
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:31,820
We're coming to get ya.

317
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:35,387
Wait! Wait!

318
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,820
I can explain everything.

319
00:18:36,854 --> 00:18:40,443
I found these glasses
and then I can see things now.

320
00:18:40,562 --> 00:18:43,436
Things that... Whoa, whoa.
Things that aren't there.

321
00:18:43,479 --> 00:18:44,978
Except they are there.

322
00:18:45,012 --> 00:18:49,111
I know that sounds crazy,
but it's true!

323
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:52,379
You can run, Blue Shirt,
but you cannot hide.

324
00:18:52,412 --> 00:18:55,044
Come on, Blue Shirt.
You can't escape the rabbit.

325
00:18:55,077 --> 00:18:57,245
We're apex predators.

326
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,111
All we do is bone and brawl
and slit throats.

327
00:19:01,686 --> 00:19:03,753
Too high! Too high!

328
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:14,879
Oh, you wanna play,
Blue Shirt? Watch this.

329
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:18,945
I tire of these games, Keys.
It's time I went god-mode on this beyotch.

330
00:19:18,979 --> 00:19:20,146
Okay, bring it.

331
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:21,979
Oh, it's brung.
Go, go, go, go, go.

332
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:38,379
I'm so, so good at this.

333
00:19:46,403 --> 00:19:48,070
Time's up, bank teller!

334
00:20:09,595 --> 00:20:10,729
Nope!

335
00:20:35,053 --> 00:20:35,987
I can't die!

336
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,919
I'm never gonna die!

337
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:39,154
Whoo!

338
00:20:39,187 --> 00:20:42,254
And that was the heartbreaking
story of Blue Shirt Guy.

339
00:20:42,287 --> 00:20:43,454
The end.

340
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:45,292
- Doesn't make sense.
- What?

341
00:20:45,403 --> 00:20:46,937
I just checked
the server stats.

342
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,170
We killed Blue Shirt and the number
of players online didn't change.

343
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:50,271
It's just a glitch, man.

344
00:20:50,304 --> 00:20:51,602
- It's not a big deal.
- I know, I know.

345
00:20:51,636 --> 00:20:53,304
It just seems like that's something
new, you know?

346
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:55,535
Keys, I know what you're thinking, okay?
You should not talk to Antwan.

347
00:20:55,569 --> 00:20:57,337
I just think it's important
to be transparent, okay?

348
00:20:57,371 --> 00:20:58,803
Uh-uh. No.

349
00:20:58,837 --> 00:21:00,739
Antwan is deep in the sequel launch.
He's either not gonna care

350
00:21:00,887 --> 00:21:03,920
or he's gonna get pissed
and then he's gonna blame us.

351
00:21:03,954 --> 00:21:06,920
So, I don't know what you haven't
figured out about the whole situation.

352
00:21:06,954 --> 00:21:11,453
Also, aren't you some kinda MIT
genius, indie game designer?

353
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:13,602
What are you doing down here
dealing with complaints?

354
00:21:13,771 --> 00:21:17,936
That, Mouser, is a long and pathetic
story involving failed dreams,

355
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,785
desperation,
and a mountain of college debt.

356
00:21:19,855 --> 00:21:22,029
You do not wanna
hear about that.

357
00:21:22,062 --> 00:21:23,362
You're absolutely right.

358
00:21:23,396 --> 00:21:27,496
That story sounds horrible and
boring and full of white privilege.

359
00:21:27,528 --> 00:21:29,528
Don't talk to Antwan.

360
00:21:33,703 --> 00:21:36,304
<i>We never dreamt
this would've happened.</i>

361
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:39,004
I mean, <i>Life Itself,</i>
it's essentially a fishbowl game.

362
00:21:39,037 --> 00:21:42,870
People aren't playing it,
they're watching it grow.

363
00:21:42,904 --> 00:21:44,737
It's a strictly
observational experience

364
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,386
where computer generated
characters interact and evolve.

365
00:21:48,512 --> 00:21:50,246
I thought we'd be
lucky to give it away.

366
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:55,146
That's what's so charming about Keys,
he's clueless about his own genius.

367
00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:56,712
Uh, no, Millie
is the genius.

368
00:21:56,745 --> 00:21:59,911
Uh, she built the AI engine
from the ground up.

369
00:22:00,005 --> 00:22:01,629
So, to get a little personal,

370
00:22:01,662 --> 00:22:03,829
what's the thing that
gets you up in the morning?

371
00:22:03,862 --> 00:22:06,495
Medium coffee,
cream, two sugars.

372
00:22:07,595 --> 00:22:08,820
What's the other thing?

373
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:11,090
Oh, yeah. An insatiable
thirst for validation.

374
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:12,868
- She's not kidding.
- I'm not.

375
00:22:12,924 --> 00:22:14,159
How about you?

376
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,500
- Code.
- Code?

377
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:16,584
- Code.
- Code, yeah.

378
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,279
Here we go.

379
00:22:17,315 --> 00:22:19,482
'Cause it's not just zeros and
ones, it's hidden messages.

380
00:22:19,595 --> 00:22:22,453
I like to think of myself, actually,
as not a code writer, but an author.

381
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:26,925
I just use zeros and ones instead of
words 'cause words will let you down.

382
00:22:27,004 --> 00:22:31,570
But zeros and ones, never.
Zeros and ones are as cool as shit.

383
00:22:31,603 --> 00:22:33,150
- He's not kidding.
- I'm not.

384
00:22:33,224 --> 00:22:34,792
Now, I've gotta ask.

385
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,147
There is a lot of chemistry
between the two of you.

386
00:22:37,337 --> 00:22:39,839
- Has this evolved into more than...
- No.

387
00:22:40,021 --> 00:22:42,654
- No way. No. It's strictly platonic.
- No, no, no. We're friends.

388
00:22:42,687 --> 00:22:44,219
- We're like best friends.
- Friendship.

389
00:22:44,252 --> 00:22:45,654
And now your game is gonna
be released by Soonami,

390
00:22:45,687 --> 00:22:47,320
one of the biggest publishers
in the world.

391
00:22:47,353 --> 00:22:49,320
- <i>It's crazy, actually.</i>
- <i>It is, yeah</i>

392
00:22:49,353 --> 00:22:52,166
<i>It does seem a little bit like
an unlikely pairing, though.</i>

393
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:54,303
<i>Yeah, I didn't
totally get it either.</i>

394
00:22:54,337 --> 00:22:56,851
<i>But Millie's got a real
instinct for these things...</i>

395
00:22:56,945 --> 00:22:58,379
<i>Antwan is a genius.</i>

396
00:22:58,412 --> 00:23:01,844
<i>He's brash and obnoxious,
but he's really good at what he does.</i>

397
00:23:01,877 --> 00:23:03,957
<i>It's a chance for our work to
be seen by a wider audience.</i>

398
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,087
- God, those two were young and dumb.
- Jeez.

399
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,120
So we're breaking
and entering now?

400
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:11,676
How does it feel working for a
galactic black hole of frozen shit?

401
00:23:11,762 --> 00:23:13,828
You have to leave.
I can't talk to you.

402
00:23:13,862 --> 00:23:15,627
Aw, shame will
have that effect.

403
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:17,229
No, Millie. I mean
I can't talk to you.

404
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,728
I can't even see you. I'm literally
focusing on background objects

405
00:23:19,762 --> 00:23:23,527
because looking at your lips move
violates my NDA and it could get me fired.

406
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,980
Aw, fired by Antwan,
the guy who stole our work?

407
00:23:26,112 --> 00:23:27,779
No, he bought it and
then he shelved it.

408
00:23:27,812 --> 00:23:31,112
All right? You're living in the past.
You are stuck. You gotta move on.

409
00:23:31,146 --> 00:23:32,310
How can I move on?

410
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,745
How can you?

411
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,467
Antwan swiped our AI engine
to use in his dumb shooter.

412
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:40,195
Did he, Millie?
Because honestly, I'm not so sure.

413
00:23:40,228 --> 00:23:42,762
Our game was complex
and beautiful and interesting

414
00:23:42,795 --> 00:23:46,295
and <i>Free City,</i> it may be popular,
but it's so idiotic, it makes me wanna cry.

415
00:23:46,328 --> 00:23:48,295
Then stop defending him
and help me beat his ass.

416
00:23:48,328 --> 00:23:50,684
- Millie, I'm...
- Come on, Keys, he stole from us.

417
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,445
And now he's lying about it

418
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:54,479
so he doesn't have to give us the credit
and the royalties that we deserve.

419
00:23:54,512 --> 00:23:55,844
Millie...

420
00:23:55,878 --> 00:23:58,078
I found a clue.
It's on a clip in a gamer's stash house.

421
00:23:58,112 --> 00:24:01,279
All I need from you
is to get me in there.

422
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,770
Millie, I care about you...

423
00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:09,870
but you need to leave.

424
00:24:17,812 --> 00:24:20,012
Today is gonna
be different, Goldie.

425
00:25:19,737 --> 00:25:21,103
What are we lookin' at?

426
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,870
Who are you?

427
00:25:23,903 --> 00:25:25,570
Okay, okay. Okay.

428
00:25:25,604 --> 00:25:27,887
We ran into each other the other day,
you were humming that great song.

429
00:25:28,078 --> 00:25:29,012
Oh, yeah.

430
00:25:29,045 --> 00:25:31,778
I thought you were an NPC.
How did you find me?

431
00:25:31,811 --> 00:25:34,811
I waited outside
by the murder train,

432
00:25:34,845 --> 00:25:36,345
then I followed you.

433
00:25:36,379 --> 00:25:37,379
Shit!

434
00:25:52,311 --> 00:25:53,645
Should I come with you?

435
00:25:54,604 --> 00:25:55,670
Yes.

436
00:25:57,036 --> 00:25:59,337
Holy hell, what just happened?

437
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,103
What just happened
is you almost blew my mission.

438
00:26:02,137 --> 00:26:05,404
No, I mean, how did we get
from there to wherever this is?

439
00:26:05,437 --> 00:26:07,003
You mean the portal gun?

440
00:26:07,036 --> 00:26:08,803
Portal gun?
That sounds expensive.

441
00:26:08,836 --> 00:26:11,036
Wow, you are a
special kind of noob.

442
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,404
Thank you. You too.

443
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:13,537
Turn around.

444
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:15,570
Okay.

445
00:26:18,837 --> 00:26:20,036
Oh.

446
00:26:23,661 --> 00:26:25,262
Is this the North Pole?

447
00:26:25,295 --> 00:26:26,728
Listen, dude.

448
00:26:26,762 --> 00:26:28,496
- Guy.
- Guy. Whatever.

449
00:26:28,528 --> 00:26:30,195
Props on the NPC outfit,

450
00:26:30,229 --> 00:26:33,062
but I'm busy trying to figure
out how to steal something.

451
00:26:33,095 --> 00:26:34,995
Maybe I could help you.

452
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:36,162
I work alone.

453
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:37,595
You have beautiful grenades.

454
00:26:37,628 --> 00:26:40,595
Besides, if you want to have any
chance of making an impact here,

455
00:26:40,628 --> 00:26:42,695
you need to have
a higher level than that.

456
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:44,561
- That's tough. No.
- No.

457
00:26:44,787 --> 00:26:45,820
Higher level?

458
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,220
Good Lord, rook.

459
00:26:48,854 --> 00:26:49,920
See?

460
00:26:49,953 --> 00:26:51,780
- Oh.
- That's mine.

461
00:26:51,828 --> 00:26:53,562
And that's yours.

462
00:26:53,595 --> 00:26:57,746
Oh... What,
is one the best or the worst?

463
00:26:57,837 --> 00:26:59,337
There is literally
nothing lower.

464
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,470
Well, how do I get
to a higher level?

465
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,437
- Really?
- Really.

466
00:27:03,953 --> 00:27:07,387
- You know, get stuff.
- Yeah.

467
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:09,419
- Are you kidding me right now?
- Okay.

468
00:27:09,453 --> 00:27:10,686
- Experience, guns...
- Yeah.

469
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,753
- Put that down.
- Uh-huh.

470
00:27:11,786 --> 00:27:14,220
Money. This is Free City.

471
00:27:14,254 --> 00:27:16,354
You could rob a store,
carjack someone,

472
00:27:16,387 --> 00:27:18,753
punch a pedestrian in the face.
You'll figure it out.

473
00:27:18,786 --> 00:27:21,320
Oh, I'd never hurt innocent people.

474
00:27:23,403 --> 00:27:27,403
Hmm. I've got to admit
that is kind of refreshing.

475
00:27:27,436 --> 00:27:31,603
Sometimes I forget not everyone you
meet on here is a sociopathic man-child.

476
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,587
Thank you.

477
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,286
Wait. But the world
isn't that bad though, is it?

478
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,587
Oh! It's pretty bleak.

479
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,320
If you ever met the dick responsible
for this world, you'd agree.

480
00:27:42,353 --> 00:27:46,186
Are we talking about God?
You've met God?

481
00:27:47,021 --> 00:27:48,387
And he's a dick?

482
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,253
His name's Antwan, and yes,
he's an absolute troll.

483
00:27:51,345 --> 00:27:52,612
Trolls exist?

484
00:27:53,712 --> 00:27:56,212
Look, I don't know
if anybody does it,

485
00:27:56,245 --> 00:27:59,212
but you could rack experience
points up by being a good guy.

486
00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:01,279
- Like a hero.
- Ooh. Easy, tiger.

487
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:03,578
If you don't wanna shoot people,
you could steal their guns.

488
00:28:03,612 --> 00:28:05,212
All that shit makes
your level go up.

489
00:28:05,245 --> 00:28:06,383
Go be the good guy.

490
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:07,695
Okay. No, I'm gonna
be the great guy.

491
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,029
Ooh! Ooh.

492
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,396
Okay, well, enjoy your
lifetime supply of virginity.

493
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:12,728
Off you go.

494
00:28:12,762 --> 00:28:14,762
Okay. Wait! How will I know
that I've leveled up enough?

495
00:28:14,795 --> 00:28:17,628
- Uh, get over 100, then we'll talk.
- Whoa.

496
00:28:17,661 --> 00:28:19,391
- Bye now.
- That's so much more than one.

497
00:28:19,445 --> 00:28:20,779
- It's like 99 more...
- Bye now.

498
00:28:20,812 --> 00:28:21,812
Okay.

499
00:28:58,895 --> 00:28:59,962
Hi.

500
00:29:27,529 --> 00:29:28,595
Thanks, Guy.

501
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:49,528
Good morning, Goldie.

502
00:29:50,262 --> 00:29:51,895
Good morning, Goldie.

503
00:29:51,928 --> 00:29:53,762
Good fucking morning, Goldie.

504
00:29:53,795 --> 00:29:57,429

- Piper.
- Who is Blue Shirt Guy?

518
00:30:30,404 --> 00:30:31,771
You're
absolutely right.

519
00:30:31,804 --> 00:30:36,399
Blue Shirt Guy.
Who is he or she indeed?

520
00:30:49,803 --> 00:30:52,536
Whoo-hoo!

521
00:31:54,387 --> 00:31:57,954
Well, well, well. Look who decided
to come to work today, huh?

522
00:31:57,987 --> 00:32:00,553
Look, where have you been?
I've been worried sick about you...

523
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:02,469
What is this shirt?

524
00:32:02,504 --> 00:32:04,003
Where's your collar at?
Where's the rest of the buttons?

525
00:32:04,871 --> 00:32:06,504
And it's not tucked in.
You look sloppy.

526
00:32:06,537 --> 00:32:09,369
Matter of fact, you look horrible.
Did you pick up some muscles, too?

527
00:32:09,403 --> 00:32:10,871
Or is somebody outside
pumping you up?

528
00:32:10,903 --> 00:32:13,624
I'm sorry that I haven't
been around, Bud.

529
00:32:13,686 --> 00:32:15,119
I've been figuring
some stuff out.

530
00:32:15,153 --> 00:32:18,287
Whatcha mean, "figure stuff out"?
It is nothing to figure out.

531
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,153
Okay? You go to bed,
you wake up,

532
00:32:20,186 --> 00:32:21,953
you get some coffee,
then you come to work.

533
00:32:21,987 --> 00:32:23,686
And then you repeat
the same thing tomorrow.

534
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,308
- The girl.
- Oh, my God.

535
00:32:25,373 --> 00:32:26,637
I talked to her.
I talked to her.

536
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:29,337
- The one with the sunglasses?
- The sunglasses, yes!

537
00:32:29,371 --> 00:32:31,070
I talked to one of
the sunglass people

538
00:32:31,104 --> 00:32:33,738
and now I'm one of the sunglass people.

539
00:32:33,879 --> 00:32:35,345
Me.

540
00:32:35,378 --> 00:32:37,079
Everybody
down on the ground!

541
00:32:37,112 --> 00:32:38,545
You're so hot.

542
00:32:38,578 --> 00:32:41,512
What if I could tell you
that you could be more?

543
00:32:41,545 --> 00:32:42,787
Your life could be fuller.

544
00:32:42,887 --> 00:32:45,087
That you're free to make your
own decisions. Your own choices.

545
00:32:45,121 --> 00:32:46,153
Yo, dumbass.

546
00:32:46,186 --> 00:32:47,687
We are in the middle
of something.

547
00:32:48,003 --> 00:32:49,237
Uh...

548
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,871
- That's my gun.
- Quiet time.

549
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:55,302
These puppies changed my life.
And they're gonna change yours, too.

550
00:32:55,336 --> 00:32:57,270
Come on now,
you know we don't wear sunglasses.

551
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,853
We do now.

552
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,487
<i>Mine now.</i>

553
00:33:03,521 --> 00:33:05,052
Are you kidding me?

554
00:33:07,354 --> 00:33:09,086
- Put 'em on.
- No.

555
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:11,254
Life doesn't have to be something
that just happens to us. All right?

556
00:33:11,287 --> 00:33:14,143
Just put the glasses on
and you're gonna see.

557
00:33:14,262 --> 00:33:15,927
You're gonna see.

558
00:33:18,912 --> 00:33:19,979
Come on.

559
00:33:21,012 --> 00:33:22,478
I can't, okay?

560
00:33:24,345 --> 00:33:25,612
I'm sorry.

561
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,121
I'm keeping these,
asshole mouth.

562
00:33:34,153 --> 00:33:36,654
Now get out of here.
Go be nicer.

563
00:33:36,687 --> 00:33:38,541
Beat it. Go, go, go.

564
00:33:38,629 --> 00:33:40,228
Don't walk, run.

565
00:33:40,795 --> 00:33:42,595
And you...

566
00:33:42,629 --> 00:33:43,729
Ugh.

567
00:33:43,762 --> 00:33:45,169
Sorry.

568
00:33:45,251 --> 00:33:48,552
Um, you could do so much
better than that guy.

569
00:33:48,579 --> 00:33:51,845
You could be with,
like, a good guy.

570
00:33:52,903 --> 00:33:55,203
Or maybe I don't have
to be with any guy.

571
00:33:55,237 --> 00:33:57,837
Right? Exactly.
Most of them are awful.

572
00:33:57,871 --> 00:33:59,670
- They really are.
- Terrible.

573
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,070
Yeah, do whatever
you wanna do.

574
00:34:08,177 --> 00:34:09,811
You're my best friend, Buddy.

575
00:34:09,845 --> 00:34:12,144
And you don't
have to be scared.

576
00:34:12,177 --> 00:34:15,111
If you change your mind,
I'll be around.

577
00:34:21,111 --> 00:34:23,545
Yo, Keys, our
Blue Shirt Guy is everywhere.

578
00:34:24,387 --> 00:34:25,487
I know.

579
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,986
Who is this guy?

580
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:57,087
I'm here.

581
00:34:57,121 --> 00:34:58,854
<i>I really appreciate
this, Keys.</i>

582
00:34:58,887 --> 00:35:00,754
Okay. Just to be clear,

583
00:35:00,787 --> 00:35:03,754
all I'm doing right now
is opening the door.

584
00:35:03,787 --> 00:35:07,153
If this clip really does prove that
Antwan reused our code illegally,

585
00:35:07,186 --> 00:35:08,387
go find it and get out.

586
00:35:09,587 --> 00:35:13,887
Player's doing the jewelry
store mission in midtown.

587
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,486
That gives you 5 minutes.

588
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,220
<i>And go.</i>

589
00:35:27,936 --> 00:35:30,470
Keys, you're a goddamn genius.

590
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:31,737
<i>Really?</i>

591
00:35:31,771 --> 00:35:33,137
I'm sitting on the toilet right
now, stealing user codes,

592
00:35:33,169 --> 00:35:35,003
so I don't exactly
feel like one.

593
00:35:35,036 --> 00:35:36,470
Oh, you never have.

594
00:35:36,504 --> 00:35:38,637
Good thing I know better.

595
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,568
<i>All right. The clip you're looking
for should be on the wall to your left.</i>

596
00:35:41,695 --> 00:35:43,595
- Thanks for the assist.
- <i>You got it.</i>

597
00:35:43,628 --> 00:35:45,162
<i>I hope it has the proof
you're looking for.</i>

598
00:36:10,104 --> 00:36:11,770
Keys! I need your help!

599
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:13,602
He's got that place
booby-trapped with spawn points.

600
00:36:13,636 --> 00:36:14,904
Millie, I can't help you.

601
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:37,477
Blue Shirt Guy?

602
00:36:37,511 --> 00:36:41,378
It's a Henley. Was that cool?
It felt really cool.

603
00:36:41,411 --> 00:36:44,845
You look really pretty.
Wow, this house is so nice.

604
00:36:52,095 --> 00:36:53,562
What are you doing here?

605
00:36:53,595 --> 00:36:56,294
I was trying to steal a video
clip, now we're trying not to die.

606
00:36:57,261 --> 00:36:58,462
Who are you talking to?

607
00:37:00,194 --> 00:37:03,662
You know, that player
in the NPC skin.

608
00:37:03,695 --> 00:37:06,061
Millie, there are no other
players in that house.

609
00:37:07,227 --> 00:37:09,562
That actually hurt my hand.

610
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:10,662
Get down!

611
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,987
- I'm sorry!
- Oh, God!

612
00:38:06,012 --> 00:38:07,410
We're doing great.

613
00:38:18,795 --> 00:38:19,896
Wow!

614
00:38:22,094 --> 00:38:23,595
We should definitely go!

615
00:38:25,061 --> 00:38:26,328
Oh, shit!

616
00:38:33,428 --> 00:38:35,729
- Is that a Glock in your pocket?
- No.

617
00:38:35,762 --> 00:38:37,695
- What?
- It's two Glocks.

618
00:38:38,795 --> 00:38:40,061
Oh!

619
00:39:12,012 --> 00:39:14,112
I don't suppose
this thing can fly.

620
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:15,379
No.

621
00:39:15,412 --> 00:39:16,479
Jump.

622
00:39:16,962 --> 00:39:18,095
Wow!

623
00:39:19,195 --> 00:39:21,962
Whoa!

624
00:39:30,062 --> 00:39:31,560
Oh, shit.

625
00:39:46,045 --> 00:39:47,812
Good morning, sheeple!

626
00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:49,445
Oh, you are fired.

627
00:39:49,478 --> 00:39:51,879
There is some concern with the bloody
zombies, retailers won't carry the game.

628
00:39:51,912 --> 00:39:53,645
Cut it. It's out.
Never even happened. Next.

629
00:39:53,678 --> 00:39:54,845
It's your lawyers.
They need to get your deposition...

630
00:39:54,879 --> 00:39:57,645
Speak. Which lawsuit
are we talking about?

631
00:39:57,678 --> 00:40:00,378
Millie, Millie Rusk?
No sweat.

632
00:40:00,411 --> 00:40:02,012
That will never see
the inside of a courtroom...

633
00:40:02,045 --> 00:40:05,212
because she's got no proof and
her ex-partner works for me.

634
00:40:05,245 --> 00:40:06,277
We're golden.

635
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,812
Antwan, hey. You look great.

636
00:40:07,845 --> 00:40:09,411
Uh, I thought you were
still at Burning Man.

637
00:40:09,445 --> 00:40:11,945
Oh, does it look like
I'm still at Burning Man?

638
00:40:11,979 --> 00:40:13,045
You, you, you...

639
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:15,179
No. So, shut your stupid,
bearded face and listen.

640
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,979
You heard about the asshole running
around in the game who looks like an NPC?

641
00:40:18,012 --> 00:40:20,779
Yeah, yeah. We call him Blue Shirt Guy.
But we're gonna get rid of him.

642
00:40:20,812 --> 00:40:24,245
Don't get rid of him. People like him.
It's all over social media. No.

643
00:40:24,277 --> 00:40:27,378
In fact, know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna use the skin in <i>Free City 2.</i>

644
00:40:27,411 --> 00:40:30,678
Oh, art nerds! We're gonna make some
upgrades to Blue Shirt, all right?

645
00:40:30,725 --> 00:40:32,729
'Roid him out. Make him
a hitman or something.

646
00:40:32,762 --> 00:40:35,896
Antwan, we're already way behind
porting over the skins from <i>Free City 1.</i>

647
00:40:35,929 --> 00:40:37,428
Skins?
Don't even worry about that.

648
00:40:37,462 --> 00:40:39,262
They won't be usable
in <i>Free City 2.</i>

649
00:40:39,295 --> 00:40:40,815
Antwan,
you told the fans...

650
00:40:40,935 --> 00:40:42,737
<i>Free City 2</i> is backwards compatible.
It was in the commercial.

651
00:40:42,771 --> 00:40:45,103
You said there'd be the same
characters in the sequel.

652
00:40:45,137 --> 00:40:48,504
Well, here's the thing.
When I said that, I was lying.

653
00:40:48,537 --> 00:40:51,003
Listen, Antwan, the game
is already buggier than ever.

654
00:40:51,036 --> 00:40:52,604
I got a stack of user
complaints, like a mile high.

655
00:40:52,637 --> 00:40:54,013
Look, I know it sucks.

656
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:58,320
But the IP recognition is rock hard.
Okay? So don't even worry about it.

657
00:40:58,354 --> 00:41:01,620
I'm just saying,
we could make an original game.

658
00:41:01,652 --> 00:41:03,154
What?

659
00:41:03,187 --> 00:41:05,420
Make an original? Why would I do
that when I could make a sequel?

660
00:41:05,454 --> 00:41:06,487
A sequel.

661
00:41:06,521 --> 00:41:07,887
So we can make it better?

662
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,786
IPs and sequels,
that is the thing that people want.

663
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,053
- Let me ask you a question.
- Okay.

664
00:41:12,087 --> 00:41:13,620
You love Kentucky
Fried Chicken, right?

665
00:41:13,652 --> 00:41:15,220
Mmm-hmm.
- No.

666
00:41:15,254 --> 00:41:17,753
If you love Kentucky Fried Chicken,
and I make Kentucky Fried Chicken,

667
00:41:17,786 --> 00:41:19,579
and I know that you love
Kentucky Fried Chicken,

668
00:41:19,695 --> 00:41:21,195
why would I make
another restaurant called,

669
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:23,628
uh, I don't know,
"Albuquerque Boiled Turkey"?

670
00:41:23,661 --> 00:41:25,527
- Okay? Makes no sense, homie.
- Mmm-hmm. No sense.

671
00:41:25,561 --> 00:41:29,795
What am I gonna give you? A sequel.
Kentucky Fried Chicken-Chicken, Part Two.

672
00:41:29,828 --> 00:41:32,229
Uh, yum.
Drop the deuce on him.

673
00:41:32,262 --> 00:41:34,268
Come on. Come here. Come here.

674
00:41:34,436 --> 00:41:35,870
I don't want you to stress

675
00:41:35,904 --> 00:41:37,937
that glorious shampoo commercial
head of yours about it.

676
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,987
<i>Free City 2</i> is gonna
be jumunjious.

677
00:41:41,186 --> 00:41:43,186
That's not a word.

678
00:41:44,587 --> 00:41:46,620
You sure you don't wanna
bump up to programming?

679
00:41:46,654 --> 00:41:49,487
I know you got
the brains for it.

680
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,920
No thanks. I'm good
right where I am.

681
00:41:53,754 --> 00:41:58,353
Love it. Fear of flying.
Can't say I can relate.

682
00:41:58,387 --> 00:42:00,679
But all good with me if I
don't have to pay you more.

683
00:42:00,762 --> 00:42:02,395
Antwan out.

684
00:42:12,871 --> 00:42:14,437
Who is this guy?

685
00:42:22,512 --> 00:42:23,611
Wow!

686
00:42:23,645 --> 00:42:25,279
I took your advice.

687
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:28,254
I leveled up.

688
00:42:29,187 --> 00:42:30,653
Impressive.

689
00:42:32,087 --> 00:42:34,187
Why are you
doing all of this?

690
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:38,354
You know, I guess
I felt... trapped.

691
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,120
You know, in my life.

692
00:42:41,154 --> 00:42:43,187
I just felt so...

693
00:42:43,553 --> 00:42:45,020
Stuck.

694
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:49,536
Yeah. And then I saw you.

695
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:52,737
Then I saw you.

696
00:42:53,503 --> 00:42:54,803
Who are you?

697
00:42:55,403 --> 00:42:56,637
I'm Guy.

698
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:58,937
No, who are you really?

699
00:42:58,970 --> 00:42:59,803
Still Guy.

700
00:42:59,837 --> 00:43:04,637
All of this,
leveling up so fast.

701
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:07,236
Giving this whole
world the finger.

702
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:08,570
How are you pulling this off?

703
00:43:08,603 --> 00:43:11,603
I've never given anyone
any of my fingers.

704
00:43:11,637 --> 00:43:13,470
You work at Soonami, don't you?

705
00:43:13,503 --> 00:43:15,304
- No.
- You've got an inside track.

706
00:43:15,337 --> 00:43:17,037
- I work at the bank.
- Right. The bank.

707
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:21,403
So, you're just this incredible hacker
who happens to work at the bank.

708
00:43:21,436 --> 00:43:23,004
Yes, I work at the bank.

709
00:43:23,037 --> 00:43:25,169
Where did you get that skin?

710
00:43:26,212 --> 00:43:27,945
It's always
sort of been there.

711
00:43:27,979 --> 00:43:30,378
Why do people keep
asking me that question?

712
00:43:30,411 --> 00:43:32,411
I don't know, why do they?

713
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:38,328
No, no.
Not doing that. I...

714
00:43:39,228 --> 00:43:40,794
What's happening right now?

715
00:43:40,828 --> 00:43:42,762
I don't know,
but I don't buy it.

716
00:43:42,794 --> 00:43:44,128
No.

717
00:43:44,161 --> 00:43:46,095
- Okay, fine. I'll forget it.
- Fine. Good.

718
00:43:46,128 --> 00:43:47,562
- I'll let it go.
- Yes.

719
00:43:47,996 --> 00:43:49,228
Great.

720
00:43:49,262 --> 00:43:50,828
We all have
our secrets, I guess.

721
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:52,529
Yes, we do.

722
00:43:55,137 --> 00:43:56,137
Hey.

723
00:43:57,604 --> 00:43:59,537
Do you like ice cream?

724
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:02,804
I can't believe
I've never been here.

725
00:44:02,837 --> 00:44:04,736
Well, it's sort of a secret.

726
00:44:04,771 --> 00:44:08,537
That's why me and my buddy, Buddy,
always come here. It's quiet and safe.

727
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:10,270
Yeah, it makes sense.

728
00:44:11,312 --> 00:44:13,911
No missions here.

729
00:44:13,945 --> 00:44:17,245
Oh, you gotta try this.
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

730
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,878
This is my favorite flavor
in the whole world.

731
00:44:18,911 --> 00:44:20,045
We'll take two
of the usual, please.

732
00:44:20,078 --> 00:44:21,379
You got it, Guy.

733
00:44:21,412 --> 00:44:23,479
It's bubble gum flavor.

734
00:44:23,511 --> 00:44:25,312
You think I'm
crazy, don't you?

735
00:44:25,345 --> 00:44:26,412
Guy...

736
00:44:26,445 --> 00:44:29,578
Get out of my brain hole!
I love bubble gum ice cream.

737
00:44:29,612 --> 00:44:31,578
No, you don't.
Are you making fun of me right now?

738
00:44:31,612 --> 00:44:33,772
No! Nobody likes
bubble gum ice cream.

739
00:44:33,862 --> 00:44:34,928
No, I do.

740
00:44:34,962 --> 00:44:36,362
I had a relationship end
over bubble gum ice cream.

741
00:44:36,396 --> 00:44:37,628
- No way. Here.
- Yeah.

742
00:44:37,661 --> 00:44:39,105
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

743
00:44:39,203 --> 00:44:40,470
Mmm.

744
00:44:40,503 --> 00:44:41,870
How good is that?

745
00:44:41,904 --> 00:44:43,037
You can taste it?

746
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:46,737
Taste it? It's like my tongue
had a baby with a sunrise.

747
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,070
Mmm-hmm?
- Mmm.

748
00:44:49,246 --> 00:44:51,079
Coffee used to be
my favorite food,

749
00:44:51,112 --> 00:44:53,678
but compared to this,
it tastes like liquid suffering.

750
00:44:53,712 --> 00:44:55,779
What?

751
00:44:58,512 --> 00:45:01,411
Nothing. You're funny.

752
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,954
- I am?
- Yeah.

753
00:45:03,987 --> 00:45:06,420
Weird funny.

754
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:09,054
But that's kind of my speed.

755
00:45:09,087 --> 00:45:11,220
Weird funny, that's
totally my speed, too.

756
00:45:11,253 --> 00:45:13,253
- Great.
- Yeah. I know a joke.

757
00:45:13,286 --> 00:45:14,886
A weird funny joke.
You wanna hear it?

758
00:45:14,919 --> 00:45:16,654
- Please.
- Okay.

759
00:45:16,687 --> 00:45:21,387
A homosexual and a man in a wheelchair
are trying to murder a very small child...

760
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,954
- The cripple says to the homosexual...
- Whoa. Stop, stop.

761
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:26,032
Stop! Where did you hear that?

762
00:45:26,061 --> 00:45:28,562
A robbery. The gunman
told it to the driver

763
00:45:28,595 --> 00:45:31,929
who thought it was hilarious,
so I memorized it and told everyone.

764
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:33,728
Word of advice?

765
00:45:33,761 --> 00:45:37,028
Don't crib your jokes
from the trolls of <i>Free City.</i>

766
00:45:37,061 --> 00:45:38,161
Trolls?

767
00:45:38,195 --> 00:45:39,661
Is that a swing set?

768
00:46:04,521 --> 00:46:05,920
Holy...

769
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:16,154
Okay,
this is too weird.

770
00:46:16,187 --> 00:46:19,253
Vintage Mariah, bubble gum ice
cream, and now swings?

771
00:46:19,286 --> 00:46:21,720
- This is too weird.
- I thought the same thing, too.

772
00:46:21,753 --> 00:46:23,035
I thought the same thing.

773
00:46:23,124 --> 00:46:26,257
When I was younger,
I was obsessed with swings.

774
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:29,470
<i>Growing up in
my family, it was...</i>

775
00:46:29,503 --> 00:46:32,237
You don't
wanna hear this. No.

776
00:46:32,271 --> 00:46:34,403
Oh, I wanna hear everything.

777
00:46:34,436 --> 00:46:36,069
Oh.

778
00:46:36,104 --> 00:46:39,436
Growing up in my family,
it wasn't good enough to be great.

779
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:43,304
You had to win,
and that pressure, you know,

780
00:46:43,337 --> 00:46:45,837
<i>it was just constant.</i>

781
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:49,045
But when I was in the backyard
on that little swing...

782
00:46:49,186 --> 00:46:50,420
You know that moment,

783
00:46:50,453 --> 00:46:54,387
<i>that split second between
rising and falling,</i>

784
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,620
when you're totally weightless,
it feels like you're free.

785
00:46:56,654 --> 00:46:57,454
In love.

786
00:46:57,594 --> 00:46:59,762
Free. What you said. Yeah.

787
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:04,729
I really wanna kiss you.
Is that weird?

788
00:47:05,996 --> 00:47:07,428
You want to kiss me?

789
00:47:08,929 --> 00:47:11,128
I wanna kiss you so badly.

790
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,628
You want to kiss me badly?

791
00:47:12,661 --> 00:47:14,061
- No!
- No?

792
00:47:14,095 --> 00:47:15,996
No, no, no, no, no.
I wanna kiss you well.

793
00:47:16,028 --> 00:47:17,561
I mean, I'm an idiot,

794
00:47:17,594 --> 00:47:19,262
so I say things
like an idiot sometimes.

795
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,829
No, you're not. You're not.

796
00:47:20,862 --> 00:47:22,295
I mean, um,

797
00:47:23,195 --> 00:47:25,762
uh, if you know
how to, go for it.

798
00:47:25,795 --> 00:47:27,128
I know how.

799
00:47:27,953 --> 00:47:28,953
Okay.

800
00:47:31,087 --> 00:47:32,686
Here it goes.

801
00:47:54,528 --> 00:47:59,028
That was so much
better than ice cream.

802
00:47:59,061 --> 00:48:00,396
Whoa!

803
00:48:00,429 --> 00:48:02,061
I think someone's
at the door.

804
00:48:02,094 --> 00:48:03,195
I'll say.

805
00:48:03,229 --> 00:48:04,962
Well, this was great.

806
00:48:04,995 --> 00:48:08,008
- Yeah, it was.
- Let's meet up again sometime soon. Yeah?

807
00:48:08,137 --> 00:48:10,070
Yes. Definitely.

808
00:48:10,104 --> 00:48:11,703
Maybe in the real world.

809
00:48:11,737 --> 00:48:13,137
What?

810
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:14,570
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

811
00:48:14,603 --> 00:48:16,104
- Okay. Bye.
- Okay.

812
00:48:17,403 --> 00:48:19,337
Bye, Molotov.

813
00:48:19,371 --> 00:48:23,436
Hey... my real name is Millie.

814
00:48:24,186 --> 00:48:28,186
My real name
continues to be Guy.

815
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:07,879
Millie, open up! Millie, it's
me, it's Keys! Open up! Come on!

816
00:49:07,912 --> 00:49:10,979
Millie! It's me, open up!

817
00:49:11,012 --> 00:49:13,378
- What?
- You were right.

818
00:49:13,411 --> 00:49:15,411
- You were right.
- Oh, come on in.

819
00:49:15,445 --> 00:49:17,862
You were right.
Our code, it is in <i>Free City</i>

820
00:49:17,987 --> 00:49:20,653
and, Millie, it works.

821
00:49:20,686 --> 00:49:22,387
Yeah, I know.
But we don't have proof.

822
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:24,269
Just forget about
that for one second.

823
00:49:24,362 --> 00:49:26,595
I'm saying that
our game, <i>Life Itself,</i>

824
00:49:26,629 --> 00:49:29,762
where characters would grow
and change and feel real...

825
00:49:29,795 --> 00:49:30,962
- Yeah?
- ...worked.

826
00:49:30,996 --> 00:49:32,729
- Keys.
- The AI worked.

827
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:36,195
It's the reason why <i>Free City</i> is so
realistic and people love it so much.

828
00:49:36,228 --> 00:49:37,933
And of course it doesn't
look the same.

829
00:49:38,137 --> 00:49:41,070
There's no waterfalls,
there's no butterflies and unicorns,

830
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,837
all the characters have different skins.
Of course they do.

831
00:49:43,871 --> 00:49:48,602
But the underlying code in the
game is the same. Our code.

832
00:49:48,655 --> 00:49:50,244
And Guy, I mean,
he has evolved way further

833
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:51,679
than we thought
was even possible.

834
00:49:51,712 --> 00:49:53,978
Wait, are you talking about
the hacker in the NPC skin?

835
00:49:54,012 --> 00:49:57,646
Millie, I'm talking about the
fact that Blue Shirt Guy...

836
00:49:57,679 --> 00:49:58,600
Yeah?

837
00:49:58,686 --> 00:50:00,521
...is not a player.

838
00:50:00,554 --> 00:50:03,521
He is an algorithm
who thinks he's alive.

839
00:50:03,554 --> 00:50:05,753
I mean, hell,
technically, he is alive.

840
00:50:05,786 --> 00:50:10,052
He is the first real
artificial intelligence.

841
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:13,070
- No! No.
- I know.

842
00:50:13,104 --> 00:50:14,503
- No, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

843
00:50:14,536 --> 00:50:16,137
- Guy? My Guy?
- Guy.

844
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:17,403
- One who has been...
- Your Guy?

845
00:50:17,436 --> 00:50:18,836
- Holy...
- This is a good thing.

846
00:50:18,869 --> 00:50:20,237
No, it's really bad.

847
00:50:20,271 --> 00:50:23,836
Millie, his code, it's thousands
of times the size it should be.

848
00:50:23,869 --> 00:50:26,004
We did it, Mills.

849
00:50:26,037 --> 00:50:30,070
We did it. Everything that we wanted
to create, it actually happened.

850
00:50:30,104 --> 00:50:33,652
Okay? Did you know that the
NPCs have private lives?

851
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,029
One of the baristas learned how to make
a cappuccino through trial and error.

852
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:38,411
I mean, that's really difficult.
I can't even do that.

853
00:50:38,445 --> 00:50:40,677
I can't even froth my own
oat milk in the morning.

854
00:50:40,711 --> 00:50:43,212
And the Bombshell
character in the game

855
00:50:43,246 --> 00:50:46,112
wrote a memoir that's
a searing indictment

856
00:50:46,146 --> 00:50:47,812
of gender roles,
the patriarchy...

857
00:50:47,845 --> 00:50:49,979
It's a little preachy in parts,
but overall, it's pretty good.

858
00:50:50,012 --> 00:50:51,345
Millie, we have
to celebrate!

859
00:50:51,378 --> 00:50:52,845
- No, this can't be happening.
- What are you talking about?

860
00:50:52,879 --> 00:50:55,677
- This is what we've been working for!
- No, I let him kiss me!

861
00:50:56,704 --> 00:50:58,269
So, yeah.

862
00:51:01,404 --> 00:51:03,302
I'm sorry, wait,
you let who kiss you?

863
00:51:03,336 --> 00:51:04,370
Guy.

864
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:06,670
Guy?

865
00:51:06,704 --> 00:51:11,203
The first time I kiss a
non-toxic guy in like forever

866
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:14,036
and of course
he's not even real!

867
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,537
Uh, there's not
a button for that.

868
00:51:16,437 --> 00:51:17,903
Oh, he found the button.

869
00:51:17,936 --> 00:51:19,101
- Okay.
- Yeah.

870
00:51:19,245 --> 00:51:21,778
- I am... I'm so confused.
- Why is it so hot?

871
00:51:21,811 --> 00:51:23,646
And surprisingly
curious.

872
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:27,279
You let
an artificially intelligent

873
00:51:27,312 --> 00:51:28,945
- video game character kiss you?
- Oh, okay,

874
00:51:28,978 --> 00:51:30,012
can you just stop
saying it like that?

875
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,111
And then you
thought that would be...

876
00:51:31,144 --> 00:51:32,911
Because you have
got to meet him, Keys.

877
00:51:32,945 --> 00:51:36,012
He's funny, and he's sweet,
and he's so handsome.

878
00:51:36,045 --> 00:51:38,345
Oh, my God,
now I'm saying it out loud.

879
00:51:38,379 --> 00:51:42,119
Also, Millie, food for
thought, he's like four.

880
00:51:43,304 --> 00:51:44,937
- Really? You're gonna do that?
- Really.

881
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:46,870
Wow, you just made
that really creepy.

882
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:50,470
Millie, put all that aside. Weird or
not, when people find out about this,

883
00:51:50,503 --> 00:51:53,271
you could win a Nobel Prize.
Oh, God.

884
00:51:53,304 --> 00:51:54,094
What?

885
00:51:54,156 --> 00:51:56,271
Oh, my God,
if they see this...

886
00:51:56,304 --> 00:51:57,536
- What? What is it?
- Oh!

887
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,536
Antwan. What else?

888
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:02,004
He's lying.
He lied about using our code,

889
00:52:02,037 --> 00:52:04,403
he's been lying about the game
being backwards compatible.

890
00:52:04,436 --> 00:52:05,937
I think he's lying
about <i>Free City 1.</i>

891
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:07,237
What are you talking about?

892
00:52:07,271 --> 00:52:10,402
Look. You see? There's not
one mission, not one location...

893
00:52:10,495 --> 00:52:12,896
I mean, there's not even a single
character from <i>Free City 1</i> on here.

894
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:14,361
<i>Free City 2</i>
is not an update...

895
00:52:14,394 --> 00:52:15,929
- It's a replacement.
- Exactly.

896
00:52:15,962 --> 00:52:17,595
So when <i>Free City 2</i>
launches on Monday...

897
00:52:17,629 --> 00:52:20,948
Blue Shirt Guy, all proof of our
code, everything will be deleted.

898
00:52:21,036 --> 00:52:22,737
He can't do that.

899
00:52:22,771 --> 00:52:25,903
I mean, this is artificial life we're
dealing with. I mean, that's insane.

900
00:52:29,029 --> 00:52:30,162
We're screwed.

901
00:52:30,928 --> 00:52:32,728
Maybe not.

902
00:52:32,762 --> 00:52:34,995
If we can find our
original build in the game,

903
00:52:35,029 --> 00:52:37,861
it'll prove that Antwan used our
code without properly licensing it.

904
00:52:37,895 --> 00:52:40,171
And we just have to find it
before <i>Free City 2</i> launches.

905
00:52:40,237 --> 00:52:41,536
We have 48 hours.

906
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:43,204
I've looked, Keys.
You know I have.

907
00:52:43,237 --> 00:52:44,470
I know you have.

908
00:52:44,503 --> 00:52:47,070
But now that we both know
about Blue Shirt Guy,

909
00:52:47,104 --> 00:52:48,325
maybe he can help?

910
00:52:48,386 --> 00:52:50,720
That would mean
I'd have to tell him.

911
00:52:50,754 --> 00:52:53,820
Millie, he's not gonna exist
once the sequel launches.

912
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:56,837
His whole world's
about to end.

913
00:52:56,871 --> 00:52:59,169
Don't you think
he'd want a chance to save it?

914
00:53:01,202 --> 00:53:03,470
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

915
00:53:03,504 --> 00:53:05,604
- You got it.
- Guy?

916
00:53:05,637 --> 00:53:06,936
Hey! Hi!

917
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:08,504
Guy, we need to talk.

918
00:53:08,537 --> 00:53:11,303
What's going on with your voice?
Where's your Australian accent?

919
00:53:11,337 --> 00:53:11,937
British.

920
00:53:12,039 --> 00:53:14,970
I think I know an Australian
accent when I see one.

921
00:53:15,003 --> 00:53:16,570
I turned off
the accent filter.

922
00:53:17,811 --> 00:53:19,077
This is me.

923
00:53:19,445 --> 00:53:20,512
Good.

924
00:53:20,545 --> 00:53:22,712
Look, I have to tell you
something really important.

925
00:53:22,746 --> 00:53:24,044
Are you married?

926
00:53:24,077 --> 00:53:24,911
No.

927
00:53:24,945 --> 00:53:28,279
Oh, God.

928
00:53:28,312 --> 00:53:30,379
That would have been like
the worst thing ever.

929
00:53:30,412 --> 00:53:32,312
Maybe not the worst thing.

930
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:33,686
Huh.

931
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,420
I have to show you something.

932
00:53:36,462 --> 00:53:37,661
Okay.

933
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:43,770
Wow!

934
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,870
I always wondered
what was in here.

935
00:53:45,904 --> 00:53:48,304
<i>Tune in to the Kill Cam</i>

936
00:53:48,337 --> 00:53:49,803
<i>for more of today's highlights</i>

937
00:53:49,837 --> 00:53:53,729
<i>of every bloody, bullet-ridden
corner of Free City.</i>

938
00:53:53,787 --> 00:53:55,386
<i>Has anyone
seen my cat?</i>

939
00:53:55,419 --> 00:53:59,889
Hey, that's Phyllis.
She's always losing her cats.

940
00:54:00,061 --> 00:54:03,426
And there's Joe! He's
my friend, I know that guy.

941
00:54:03,612 --> 00:54:05,612
I don't get it.
What is this place?

942
00:54:05,646 --> 00:54:10,245
There is no easy way to say
this, but this city is a game.

943
00:54:10,279 --> 00:54:12,778
There's no easy way to say
this, I know it's a game.

944
00:54:12,811 --> 00:54:14,712
- You taught me how to play it.
- Boop-boop.

945
00:54:14,746 --> 00:54:16,145
Yes,
you're right, I did.

946
00:54:16,178 --> 00:54:19,610
But it's not just that it's like a game.
It is a game.

947
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:22,714
It's a video game.
And that's all it is.

948
00:54:22,887 --> 00:54:25,854
So the entire world is a game?

949
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:26,987
Yes.

950
00:54:27,021 --> 00:54:28,987
And we're all just
players in the game?

951
00:54:29,021 --> 00:54:31,285
Not exactly.

952
00:54:32,095 --> 00:54:33,595
I'm a player.

953
00:54:33,629 --> 00:54:37,261
All these people here are players.
We live in the real world.

954
00:54:37,295 --> 00:54:39,028
But you only exist here.

955
00:54:39,061 --> 00:54:41,829
It's why you can
never leave Free City.

956
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:43,615
You're what we call an NPC.

957
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:44,903
NPC.

958
00:54:44,936 --> 00:54:47,970
The policeman
and the muscular bunny rabbit,

959
00:54:48,002 --> 00:54:49,270
they called me that.
What is an NPC?

960
00:54:49,303 --> 00:54:50,737
- <i>Let's take...</i>
- Just watch.

961
00:54:50,771 --> 00:54:52,237
<i>...another look
at that leaderboard.</i>

962
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:53,537
<i>Everybody
get down on the ground!</i>

963
00:54:53,570 --> 00:54:55,035
<i>Nobody try to be a hero.</i>

964
00:54:55,069 --> 00:54:56,570
<i>This will all be over soon.</i>

965
00:54:56,604 --> 00:54:57,499
I don't understand.

966
00:54:57,621 --> 00:54:59,987
You're a
non-player character.

967
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,420
- Non...
- A background person.

968
00:55:02,454 --> 00:55:05,472
Someone designed to make the
game more fun for real people.

969
00:55:05,545 --> 00:55:07,745
Wait, hold on a second.
Just stop for a second.

970
00:55:07,779 --> 00:55:09,112
I wanna make sure
I'm getting this straight.

971
00:55:09,146 --> 00:55:11,278
I just wanna fully
understand here.

972
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:13,845
So, I'm fake?

973
00:55:13,879 --> 00:55:17,311
The entire world is fake?
I'm not even a main character,

974
00:55:17,345 --> 00:55:21,359
I'm just this idiot
who's in the background?

975
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:24,787
Millie, why are you even saying this?
I love you.

976
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:28,153
You only think that because
it's in your programming.

977
00:55:34,103 --> 00:55:36,203
Guy, I need
you to listen to me.

978
00:55:36,237 --> 00:55:39,069
In two days,
the game is gonna shut down. For good.

979
00:55:39,103 --> 00:55:41,592
When this sequel launches,
this whole city,

980
00:55:41,712 --> 00:55:44,078
you, all the people in it
who aren't players,

981
00:55:44,112 --> 00:55:45,579
they'll be gone forever.
You need to listen.

982
00:55:45,612 --> 00:55:48,679
My whole life, I felt like
there had to be something more.

983
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:50,603
And then I saw you.

984
00:55:50,695 --> 00:55:53,828
And I knew I was right.
I was right!

985
00:55:54,762 --> 00:55:57,262
And for a second,
I felt amazing.

986
00:55:57,295 --> 00:55:59,195
- I know.
- Except you don't know.

987
00:55:59,229 --> 00:56:02,129
Because we're not the same.

988
00:56:02,162 --> 00:56:03,728
Isn't that what you said?
You said that.

989
00:56:03,762 --> 00:56:05,348
We're not the same.

990
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:07,094
You're real.

991
00:56:07,829 --> 00:56:09,529
And I'm what? I'm what?

992
00:56:13,428 --> 00:56:14,562
You're not.

993
00:56:17,795 --> 00:56:19,695
You're not.

994
00:56:19,729 --> 00:56:23,462
Well, I may not be real,
but for a second there...

995
00:56:23,495 --> 00:56:25,362
I felt pretty alive.

996
00:57:25,595 --> 00:57:28,828
It's all a lie!

997
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:36,037
Have the quarterly
reports on my desk by Friday.

998
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:38,703
Quarterly reports.
My, what specific business lingo.

999
00:57:38,737 --> 00:57:40,837
Wow. Life in the big city.
Ain't nothing like it.

1000
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:42,070
Until it crushes your soul.

1001
00:57:42,104 --> 00:57:45,603
Has anyone seen my cat?
Has anyone seen my...

1002
00:57:45,637 --> 00:57:47,637
Your cats?
No, Phyllis, I haven't seen them.

1003
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:51,477
But here's a revolutionary idea...
close your goddamn door.

1004
00:57:51,612 --> 00:57:53,945
It's not like they're climbing
on top of one another,

1005
00:57:53,979 --> 00:57:57,378
forming a little kitty tower,
and then jimmying the locks.

1006
00:57:57,411 --> 00:57:59,712
They don't have
thumbs, Phyllis.

1007
00:57:59,995 --> 00:58:01,595
No thumbs!

1008
00:58:01,629 --> 00:58:05,328
Don't you get it?
Don't any of you get it?

1009
00:58:05,362 --> 00:58:09,896
None of this matters! None of it!
It's fake! We don't matter!

1010
00:58:09,928 --> 00:58:12,376
That building, that's fake!
This street...

1011
00:58:12,487 --> 00:58:14,020
It's fake!

1012
00:58:14,053 --> 00:58:15,154
That car...

1013
00:58:21,271 --> 00:58:22,503
Officer Johnny!

1014
00:58:22,536 --> 00:58:24,402
Have a good one, Guy.

1015
00:58:32,237 --> 00:58:33,803
Oh, hey, uh...

1016
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:36,536
Come in.

1017
00:58:45,936 --> 00:58:47,437
Here you go.

1018
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:48,470
Thank you.

1019
00:58:49,445 --> 00:58:50,612
Buddy,

1020
00:58:50,645 --> 00:58:56,078
what would you do if you found
out that you weren't real?

1021
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,420
What do you mean?

1022
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,220
Pretend with me.

1023
00:59:00,254 --> 00:59:01,820
Okay, so...

1024
00:59:01,853 --> 00:59:03,786
Can I pretend
I'm a ghost?

1025
00:59:04,937 --> 00:59:06,070
Sure.

1026
00:59:06,104 --> 00:59:09,403
Oh. Do I look like how I look like now?
Or whenever I die?

1027
00:59:09,436 --> 00:59:10,603
Like, do I have
a funeral outfit on?

1028
00:59:10,637 --> 00:59:12,336
- This is kind of funeral...
- Doesn't matter.

1029
00:59:12,371 --> 00:59:13,737
...but even though it's a
work uniform, 'cause I got a tie on.

1030
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:15,770
Let's move on
from the concept, okay?

1031
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:18,303
Got it.

1032
00:59:18,336 --> 00:59:21,436
I'm not a ghost.
I'm very disappointed,

1033
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:23,104
- but I get it.
- Yeah.

1034
00:59:23,137 --> 00:59:27,703
I'm me, who I am right now,
and I'm just trying to help a friend.

1035
00:59:28,512 --> 00:59:31,946
I say, okay, so
what if I'm not real?

1036
00:59:32,028 --> 00:59:34,028
I'm sorry. "So what?"

1037
00:59:34,061 --> 00:59:35,095
Yeah. So what?

1038
00:59:35,128 --> 00:59:37,061
But if
you're not real,

1039
00:59:37,095 --> 00:59:39,662
doesn't that mean
that nothing you do matters?

1040
00:59:39,695 --> 00:59:42,695
What does that mean?
Look, brother, I am sitting here

1041
00:59:42,729 --> 00:59:46,629
with my best friend, trying to
help him get through a tough time.

1042
00:59:46,662 --> 00:59:51,395
Right? And even if I'm not
real, this moment is.

1043
00:59:52,279 --> 00:59:57,445
Right here, right now.
This moment is real.

1044
00:59:57,479 --> 01:00:01,412
I mean, what's more real than a person
tryin' to help someone they love?

1045
01:00:01,445 --> 01:00:06,412
Now, if that's not real,
I don't know what is.

1046
01:00:08,887 --> 01:00:10,963
Do you know the
other security guards?

1047
01:00:11,101 --> 01:00:12,635
I know 'em all. Why?

1048
01:00:13,278 --> 01:00:15,012
Hey, Buddy...

1049
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:17,044
let's not have
a good day...

1050
01:00:18,121 --> 01:00:19,654
let's have a great day.

1051
01:00:20,929 --> 01:00:22,262
Guy, what are
we doin' here?

1052
01:00:22,295 --> 01:00:24,962
We're here to get a video
clip for my friend Millie.

1053
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,695
Does this look intimidating?

1054
01:00:26,729 --> 01:00:29,128
I don't know, Guy.
How do you hold this thing?

1055
01:00:36,544 --> 01:00:38,746
You have
something I want.

1056
01:00:38,778 --> 01:00:40,578
And you're gonna hand it over.

1057
01:00:42,653 --> 01:00:44,053
How'd you get in here?

1058
01:00:44,087 --> 01:00:46,287
Easy. I know
your security guard.

1059
01:00:46,987 --> 01:00:48,087
Jimmy?

1060
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,154
His name is Luigi.

1061
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:50,953
So if you took some time
to learn his name...

1062
01:00:50,987 --> 01:00:52,786
maybe he wouldn't
turn on you so quick.

1063
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:56,621
I need a video clip, and
you're gonna give it to me.

1064
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,419
Wait a minute, are you...

1065
01:00:59,136 --> 01:01:00,337
Are you Blue Shirt Guy?

1066
01:01:00,371 --> 01:01:01,870
Yeah, maybe.

1067
01:01:01,904 --> 01:01:04,570
Holy shit! You're Guy!
You're Blue Shirt Guy! It's you!

1068
01:01:04,603 --> 01:01:05,737
- Yeah.
- I love you.

1069
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:07,304
- You do?
- I mean...

1070
01:01:07,337 --> 01:01:08,703
I'm like a fan.
You're awesome.

1071
01:01:08,737 --> 01:01:10,070
You can have
anything you want.

1072
01:01:10,104 --> 01:01:10,884
Wait, hold on one second.

1073
01:01:11,011 --> 01:01:13,146
Gamers, listen up, this is
Revenjamin Buttons here.

1074
01:01:13,179 --> 01:01:14,512
I'm here with Guy.

1075
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:17,011
The Guy, he's in my stash
house, and he's here to rob me.

1076
01:01:17,044 --> 01:01:18,146
Can I get a little...

1077
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:21,037
- "what-what" for my followers, Guy?
- What?

1078
01:01:21,161 --> 01:01:22,862
Perfect. All right,
so what's happening is...

1079
01:01:22,896 --> 01:01:24,462
Guy's looking for a clip...

1080
01:01:24,495 --> 01:01:27,328
showing a walkthrough I did
to get to the secret level.

1081
01:01:28,936 --> 01:01:30,537
Who are you talking to?

1082
01:01:31,903 --> 01:01:33,303
I'm sorry.

1083
01:01:33,337 --> 01:01:36,636
Who am I talking to?
It's just such a classic Guy line.

1084
01:01:36,669 --> 01:01:37,703
Right?

1085
01:01:37,737 --> 01:01:40,237
You're good.
Oh, anyway...

1086
01:01:40,270 --> 01:01:43,771
And you, you tried to steal it
from me with that Molotov chick.

1087
01:01:43,804 --> 01:01:44,936
<i>Her name's Millie.</i>

1088
01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:46,791
- Yeah. Wait, who?
- <i>Millie.</i>

1089
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,653
I think
it's going really well.

1090
01:01:48,686 --> 01:01:51,753
I know. This is literally the first
time I took my gun out the holster.

1091
01:01:51,786 --> 01:01:53,184
Totally. Right?

1092
01:01:53,261 --> 01:01:56,267
Guy, I tried to go back through,
but the glitch is patched.

1093
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:57,870
And I never found it again.

1094
01:01:57,904 --> 01:01:59,570
So I'm the only one that ever
saw what was on the other side.

1095
01:01:59,603 --> 01:02:01,103
But it's all here,
check it out.

1096
01:02:01,136 --> 01:02:03,534
It's pretty cool actually.
It's like a whole other world.

1097
01:02:03,635 --> 01:02:06,136
- This is it? This is the game clip?
- Yeah, that's it.

1098
01:02:06,169 --> 01:02:09,637
Can you do one,
single, just one solid for me?

1099
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:11,136
- One thing, I'll stop asking, okay?
- Yeah.

1100
01:02:11,169 --> 01:02:12,344
Just say my catchphrase.

1101
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:14,116
My viewers will just banana cream sandwich
all over themselves if you say it.

1102
01:02:14,152 --> 01:02:15,721
I love banana
cream sandwiches.

1103
01:02:15,811 --> 01:02:16,878
Maybe not this
banana cream sandwich.

1104
01:02:16,911 --> 01:02:18,412
Yeah, this one.

1105
01:02:18,444 --> 01:02:20,212
Okay, perfect. Okay, so just
say, "You know what time it is?"

1106
01:02:20,245 --> 01:02:22,646
- You know what time it is?
- You know what time it is?

1107
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:23,778
You know what time it is?

1108
01:02:23,811 --> 01:02:24,911
You know what time it is?

1109
01:02:24,945 --> 01:02:26,145
You know
what time it is?

1110
01:02:26,178 --> 01:02:27,452
You know
what time it is?

1111
01:02:27,554 --> 01:02:29,087
You know
what time it is?

1112
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,386
It's crime o'clock,
baby. Yeah.

1113
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:32,288
It's crime o'cl...

1114
01:02:32,359 --> 01:02:33,603
But, no, I can't
say that. That's...

1115
01:02:33,637 --> 01:02:35,703
Okay. It's all right.
I'll say it myself.

1116
01:02:35,737 --> 01:02:37,703
- All right, you know what time it is?
- No.

1117
01:02:37,737 --> 01:02:39,737
It's crime o'cl...
Mom!

1118
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:41,304
Mom! Are you
serious with the...

1119
01:02:41,337 --> 01:02:42,637
vacuum right now?

1120
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:44,837
You really have to do that here?
I'm saying my...

1121
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:46,403
catchphrase!
Everybody's watching!

1122
01:02:46,436 --> 01:02:47,637
- God!
- You're 22,

1123
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:49,371
living in my house,
there is no God!

1124
01:02:49,403 --> 01:02:50,201
Sorry, Guy.

1125
01:02:50,316 --> 01:02:53,450
Thank you, Mr. Buttons.
We're gonna go.

1126
01:02:53,616 --> 01:02:55,384
No, no, no! No,
you gotta kill me.

1127
01:02:55,503 --> 01:02:57,170
- I'm sorry, what?
- You gotta kill me. Please kill me.

1128
01:02:57,278 --> 01:02:59,612
Give it to me, Daddy.
Give it to me!

1129
01:02:59,645 --> 01:03:01,878
No. Please don't do that.
Please don't do that.

1130
01:03:01,911 --> 01:03:03,883
We're not gonna hurt anybody.
I'm a good guy.

1131
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:05,478
What? What'd you say?

1132
01:03:08,128 --> 01:03:09,362
That's deep.

1133
01:03:09,395 --> 01:03:10,362
No, it's not.

1134
01:03:10,395 --> 01:03:11,661
That's like I can
taste you, deep.

1135
01:03:11,694 --> 01:03:15,595
I want your help, Buddy.
I don't have the safeword.

1136
01:03:15,628 --> 01:03:16,694
I know what you want.

1137
01:03:16,728 --> 01:03:17,829
I don't want that.

1138
01:03:17,862 --> 01:03:18,929
Yeah, you do.

1139
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:20,161
That's touching.

1140
01:03:20,195 --> 01:03:21,350
- They're touching.
- Yeah.

1141
01:03:21,433 --> 01:03:22,731
I know what you want.

1142
01:03:22,828 --> 01:03:24,161
Yes, I do.

1143
01:03:24,194 --> 01:03:26,605
You want a little bit
of that <i>Free City</i> Itchy Kitty.

1144
01:03:26,737 --> 01:03:28,536
- No.
- Uh-huh. Yes, you do.

1145
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:30,503
<i>The way you move,
it's almost dirty.</i>

1146
01:03:30,536 --> 01:03:31,837
What about a little
Thanos Glove...

1147
01:03:31,870 --> 01:03:35,637
into a little bit
of Thanos Snap?

1148
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:37,570
- Oh. That looked like it hurt.
- Yeah, a little bit.

1149
01:03:37,603 --> 01:03:38,837
A little Sunday Drive.

1150
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:40,603
You have
a beautiful home.

1151
01:03:40,637 --> 01:03:44,003
- Snakey Man? No? No Snakey Man?
- Bye, Mr. Buttons.

1152
01:03:44,036 --> 01:03:46,637
Come on, give me one snake!
Just come on, man.

1153
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:48,402
Mom!
Do not touch that sock!

1154
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,320
I swear to God,
if you touch that sock...

1155
01:03:50,353 --> 01:03:52,453
you will be in therapy
for the rest of your life!

1156
01:03:52,487 --> 01:03:55,854
No! That's my special sock!
Put it down!

1157
01:04:00,387 --> 01:04:02,154
<i>Millie, please.</i>

1158
01:04:02,186 --> 01:04:04,621
Please wake up from
your standing coma.

1159
01:04:04,653 --> 01:04:07,053
Look, I know this world
is just a game to you

1160
01:04:07,087 --> 01:04:09,186
and you can come
and go, but to me...

1161
01:04:09,219 --> 01:04:11,820
this place, these people,
that's all I have.

1162
01:04:11,853 --> 01:04:13,987
And if I can help you save it,
I wanna do that...

1163
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:16,269
but you gotta wake up, please.

1164
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:18,204
Millie, I'm sorry
for running away.

1165
01:04:18,237 --> 01:04:19,969
Guy?

1166
01:04:20,969 --> 01:04:23,170
Oh, that's so scary!
It's just terrifying.

1167
01:04:23,204 --> 01:04:24,403
I know, I know.

1168
01:04:24,436 --> 01:04:26,104
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1169
01:04:26,137 --> 01:04:28,603
Look, you may have started out living
in the background, but so did I.

1170
01:04:28,637 --> 01:04:30,637
We're done with that.

1171
01:04:31,896 --> 01:04:33,095
I got you a present.

1172
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:35,528
I didn't have time to wrap it.

1173
01:04:36,503 --> 01:04:37,570
What?

1174
01:04:45,496 --> 01:04:48,595
<i>They say over a
billion NPCs are killed every year.</i>

1175
01:04:48,628 --> 01:04:53,229
<i>Now, I'm not gonna lie,
that's at least 50% my fault.</i>

1176
01:04:53,262 --> 01:04:56,762
I used to shoot
all the secondary characters

1177
01:04:56,795 --> 01:04:58,496
when I was bored, you know?

1178
01:04:58,528 --> 01:05:01,895
And then, I'd
teabag 'em a little bit.

1179
01:05:01,928 --> 01:05:04,795
<i>Who the hell even knows
who this Blue Shirt Guy is?</i>

1180
01:05:04,828 --> 01:05:06,828
<i>But I'll tell you this,
he's got me thinkin'</i>

1181
01:05:06,862 --> 01:05:08,561
<i>about NPCs and
how I play the game.</i>

1182
01:05:08,595 --> 01:05:12,862
<i>The game wasn't even made for someone
like this, for a player to be a good guy.</i>

1183
01:05:12,895 --> 01:05:15,028
<i>He's also a really cute guy.</i>

1184
01:05:15,061 --> 01:05:17,061
<i>And not just the face, you know,
like the whole thing.</i>

1185
01:05:17,094 --> 01:05:19,094
<i>And, honestly,
it's got me realizing...</i>

1186
01:05:19,129 --> 01:05:21,351
<i>maybe we've been thinking about
NPCs wrong this whole time.</i>

1187
01:05:21,455 --> 01:05:23,665
<i>I think Blue Shirt Guy's
like a symbol, you know?</i>

1188
01:05:23,761 --> 01:05:25,444
<i>Like, maybe people
can be whatever they want.</i>

1189
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:28,005
<i>He's like an icon.
Is that the right word?</i>

1190
01:05:28,104 --> 01:05:29,738
<i>Like, he reminds us
of what's possible.</i>

1191
01:05:29,816 --> 01:05:31,245
<i>Also, he's like crazy hot.</i>

1192
01:05:31,290 --> 01:05:34,390
<i>Oh, my God, totally.
I'd hit those pixels hard.</i>

1193
01:05:34,494 --> 01:05:35,996
<i>We should all be
more like Blue Shirt Guy.</i>

1194
01:05:36,028 --> 01:05:37,328
Maybe we just
stop the killing.

1195
01:05:37,362 --> 01:05:39,896
He's dead! You hear me?

1196
01:05:39,929 --> 01:05:41,047
The guy, put him up here.

1197
01:05:41,153 --> 01:05:43,653
Put him up here on the screen.
Put him on the screen.

1198
01:05:43,686 --> 01:05:47,420
Make me see him. There he is.

1199
01:05:47,454 --> 01:05:49,987
Yes. There he is,
the little do-gooder.

1200
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:51,521
I thought
you liked Blue Shirt.

1201
01:05:51,554 --> 01:05:53,287
Don't say words to me!

1202
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:56,554
People are so busy watching this
loser on Twitch and YouTube.

1203
01:05:56,587 --> 01:05:57,686
You know what
they're not doing, guys?

1204
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:58,898
Buying <i>Free City 2.</i>

1205
01:05:58,961 --> 01:06:01,162
- Pre-sales are down 16%.
- 60.

1206
01:06:01,195 --> 01:06:02,578
60. That's bad.

1207
01:06:02,711 --> 01:06:05,411
Oh, we are 48 hours
from launch.

1208
01:06:05,737 --> 01:06:07,369
Yeah, he's gone viral.

1209
01:06:07,403 --> 01:06:10,604
Yeah, a virus that's giving me ass
and ball cancer at the same time!

1210
01:06:11,437 --> 01:06:13,936
Inoperable!

1211
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,302
You know,
this whole good guy routine...

1212
01:06:15,336 --> 01:06:18,270
it is a bad influence,
and is bad for the franchise.

1213
01:06:18,302 --> 01:06:20,871
I want him gone.
I don't care who it is, boot him.

1214
01:06:20,903 --> 01:06:22,103
You can't.

1215
01:06:22,737 --> 01:06:23,837
Oh, I'm sorry, what?

1216
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:25,237
You can't.

1217
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:26,336
Why not?

1218
01:06:26,369 --> 01:06:29,070
Because he's not a hacker, Antwan.
He's an NPC.

1219
01:06:29,103 --> 01:06:30,936
You're tryin' to tell me
that all this shit

1220
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:33,103
about a self-aware
NPC is real?

1221
01:06:33,137 --> 01:06:36,403
Yeah. I don't know how or
why, but he's real.

1222
01:06:37,336 --> 01:06:39,470
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

1223
01:06:41,561 --> 01:06:43,628
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1224
01:06:43,661 --> 01:06:45,961
What to do? What to do?
Got it.

1225
01:06:47,311 --> 01:06:48,779
And kip-up!

1226
01:06:52,311 --> 01:06:53,744
So we can't kick him
out of the game.

1227
01:06:53,779 --> 01:06:56,912
How do we reset his AI?
Ideas, people. Come on.

1228
01:06:56,945 --> 01:06:58,578
Hit me. Ideas.

1229
01:06:58,612 --> 01:07:00,246
You could
just reboot the server.

1230
01:07:00,311 --> 01:07:01,311
Keep talking.

1231
01:07:01,345 --> 01:07:02,845
If we reboot the server...

1232
01:07:02,879 --> 01:07:05,831
then he's just gonna revert back
to a regular non-player guy.

1233
01:07:05,896 --> 01:07:08,028
- Solution.
- Antwan.

1234
01:07:08,061 --> 01:07:09,494
Antwan, you're talking
about terminating...

1235
01:07:09,529 --> 01:07:11,295
the first confirmed
artificially intelligent

1236
01:07:11,328 --> 01:07:12,461
life-form right now, okay?

1237
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:14,262
- Honey, honey.
- Shush.

1238
01:07:14,778 --> 01:07:16,211
He's losing me money.

1239
01:07:16,245 --> 01:07:19,712
So, I don't care if he's
Arnold-Frickin'- Schwarzen-Vader.

1240
01:07:19,746 --> 01:07:21,082
Terminate him. Reboot.

1241
01:07:21,154 --> 01:07:23,120
- On it.
- You can't do that.

1242
01:07:23,154 --> 01:07:24,154
Reboot!

1243
01:07:33,845 --> 01:07:36,978
<i>Order
up and drown your bloodlust...</i>

1244
01:07:37,012 --> 01:07:39,217
<i>with a tall glass
of murder juice.</i>

1245
01:07:39,337 --> 01:07:41,403
<i>Here's this week's highlights.</i>

1246
01:07:41,436 --> 01:07:43,703
He's very expressive
with his body.

1247
01:07:43,736 --> 01:07:44,670
Clearly.

1248
01:07:44,703 --> 01:07:45,904
<i>What is that?</i>

1249
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:47,436
<i>It's a whole new
world over there.</i>

1250
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:49,037
<i>Some kinda paradise and shit.</i>

1251
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:50,470
Oh, my God, that's it.

1252
01:07:50,503 --> 01:07:54,937
It's our original build and that build
is proof our code is in the game.

1253
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:56,762
You have no idea
how long I've waited for this.

1254
01:07:56,858 --> 01:07:58,425
I've seen this place.

1255
01:07:58,529 --> 01:07:59,829
What?

1256
01:08:05,029 --> 01:08:06,329
Yeah.

1257
01:08:06,362 --> 01:08:08,229
What do you mean? How could you
have possibly seen it?

1258
01:08:12,561 --> 01:08:14,661
Millie? Millie?

1259
01:08:58,595 --> 01:09:00,861
We're dark.
<i>Free City</i> is offline.

1260
01:09:08,179 --> 01:09:10,246
What is happening?

1261
01:09:15,079 --> 01:09:16,611
Bye-bye, Blue Shirt.

1262
01:09:17,045 --> 01:09:18,979
No, no, no.

1263
01:09:36,827 --> 01:09:38,229
It's okay. Come on.

1264
01:09:43,962 --> 01:09:45,761
Come on.

1265
01:09:45,794 --> 01:09:48,295
Come on, come on, come on.

1266
01:09:53,695 --> 01:09:55,295
Good morning, Goldie.

1267
01:09:59,761 --> 01:10:02,462
<i>Front of warm, dry gunfire...</i>

1268
01:10:02,496 --> 01:10:04,396
<i>mixed with late
afternoon stabbings...</i>

1269
01:10:04,429 --> 01:10:06,262
<i>could leave you in the streets
wet with the blood of innocents...</i>

1270
01:10:06,295 --> 01:10:08,162
<i>by early Tuesday night.</i>

1271
01:10:08,195 --> 01:10:11,162
What really is the difference between
a light roast and a dark roast?

1272
01:10:11,195 --> 01:10:12,727
Nobody knows.

1273
01:10:12,761 --> 01:10:14,528
Don't have a good day,
have a great day.

1274
01:10:14,561 --> 01:10:15,761
Guy, can we talk?

1275
01:10:15,794 --> 01:10:17,095
How does the sunglass girl
know your name?

1276
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:17,962
I don't know. Keep walking.

1277
01:10:17,995 --> 01:10:19,561
Come on, Guy!
You know me.

1278
01:10:19,595 --> 01:10:21,048
You know this.

1279
01:10:21,128 --> 01:10:22,996
You said this clip showed
a place you'd seen before.

1280
01:10:23,028 --> 01:10:24,729
I need to know where.

1281
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:26,595
The data's been erased,
but it's in your head.

1282
01:10:26,629 --> 01:10:30,227
Please try to remember.
This is really important.

1283
01:10:30,261 --> 01:10:33,509
Please, Guy, think.
The ice cream, the swings?

1284
01:10:33,637 --> 01:10:35,102
Oh, my Guy loves swings.

1285
01:10:35,136 --> 01:10:37,102
At Free City Harbor Park,
there's a great swing set there.

1286
01:10:37,136 --> 01:10:38,262
- Have you been?
- Yes.

1287
01:10:38,345 --> 01:10:39,712
We had bubble gum ice cream.

1288
01:10:39,746 --> 01:10:42,612
OMG, I love
bubble gum ice cream!

1289
01:10:42,646 --> 01:10:44,078
He loves the
bubble gum ice cream.

1290
01:10:44,112 --> 01:10:46,279
Yes, I know. We had it
together, remember?

1291
01:10:47,354 --> 01:10:49,819
Please, Guy,
you're all I've got.

1292
01:10:53,535 --> 01:10:57,271
I'm sorry, lady. I think
you have the wrong guy.

1293
01:10:57,304 --> 01:10:59,904
Don't have a good day,
have a great day.

1294
01:11:13,495 --> 01:11:14,529
Hello?

1295
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:16,262
<i>I might've found something.</i>

1296
01:11:16,295 --> 01:11:19,028
I've been going through Guy's code
and there is something there...

1297
01:11:19,061 --> 01:11:21,127
even now, after the wipe.

1298
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,203
What's the point?

1299
01:11:22,281 --> 01:11:25,095
Guy was, like, a one-in-a-billion miracle.
We can't replicate that.

1300
01:11:25,127 --> 01:11:26,762
<i>I tried, okay?
You were right, it's over.</i>

1301
01:11:26,795 --> 01:11:29,562
No, Millie, Millie,
you're not listening to me, all right?

1302
01:11:29,595 --> 01:11:32,595
A reboot, it doesn't
erase his AI coding...

1303
01:11:32,629 --> 01:11:34,862
you literally would have to
destroy the servers to do that.

1304
01:11:34,896 --> 01:11:37,495
<i>His AI is still there,
it just needs to be accessed.</i>

1305
01:11:37,529 --> 01:11:39,829
I've seen him, Keys.
He's forgotten everything.

1306
01:11:39,862 --> 01:11:41,671
Just look at the
trace log I sent you.

1307
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:43,466
<i>It'll explain everything.</i>

1308
01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:58,216
<i>Now, from the beginning...</i>

1309
01:11:58,252 --> 01:12:01,054
<i>Guy's behavior is much more
complex than it should be,</i>

1310
01:12:01,087 --> 01:12:03,054
<i>thanks to our code.</i>

1311
01:12:03,087 --> 01:12:06,687
<i>But he's still stuck in Free City.
He's still stuck in this life, this loop.</i>

1312
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:10,787
<i>And then, something changes.
He comes to life. Why?</i>

1313
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:13,087
<i>And then I remembered.</i>

1314
01:12:13,121 --> 01:12:16,387
<i>One of the characters from</i> Life Itself
<i>was this guy that I nicknamed Lovelorn.</i>

1315
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:20,069
And he was someone who was designed
to never meet the right person.

1316
01:12:20,178 --> 01:12:22,479
It was essentially the building
blocks of the character.

1317
01:12:22,512 --> 01:12:26,810
But he never stopped hoping that he
would meet "the girl of his dreams."

1318
01:12:26,844 --> 01:12:28,535
<i>So I had to base this girl
off of someone...</i>

1319
01:12:28,625 --> 01:12:32,192
<i>and who better than the person that
I was sitting next to every day?</i>

1320
01:12:32,288 --> 01:12:33,388
<i>You.</i>

1321
01:12:33,477 --> 01:12:34,919
But then, one day...

1322
01:12:35,006 --> 01:12:37,606
<i>he meets you in</i> Free City,
<i>and once he sees you...</i>

1323
01:12:37,685 --> 01:12:38,926
<i>he can never be the same.</i>

1324
01:12:39,028 --> 01:12:42,775
<i>He was supposed to feel doomed,
but instead, he feels alive...</i>

1325
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:45,760
<i>until eventually, he is alive.</i>

1326
01:12:46,845 --> 01:12:48,845
<i>You changed him, Millie.</i>

1327
01:12:48,879 --> 01:12:53,411
You changed his code.
And I think you can do it again.

1328
01:12:53,445 --> 01:12:55,812
<i>You brought him
to life, Millie.</i>

1329
01:12:56,662 --> 01:12:58,595
<i>You brought him to life.</i>

1330
01:12:58,629 --> 01:13:01,127
<i>And he was alive because
he met the one person...</i>

1331
01:13:02,862 --> 01:13:04,228
Don't have a good day...

1332
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:06,462
have a great day.

1333
01:13:06,495 --> 01:13:07,602
Thank you.

1334
01:13:07,712 --> 01:13:09,212
Take care.

1335
01:13:09,245 --> 01:13:10,877
Everybody down on the ground!

1336
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:13,445
Nobody try to be a hero.
This will all be over soon.

1337
01:13:13,479 --> 01:13:14,334
Okay.

1338
01:13:14,453 --> 01:13:16,087
Everybody
except you.

1339
01:13:19,462 --> 01:13:21,262
Door, door, door. I got it.

1340
01:13:21,295 --> 01:13:22,594
Please,
I have a goldfish.

1341
01:13:22,628 --> 01:13:23,962
Look, I don't have long.

1342
01:13:23,995 --> 01:13:26,062
I just took you hostage,
so there are three badges on me.

1343
01:13:26,095 --> 01:13:27,962
Badges? Is that like a
Girl Scout thing? What is that?

1344
01:13:27,995 --> 01:13:29,195
There is something
inside you, Guy.

1345
01:13:29,229 --> 01:13:30,560
What? I don't want
anything inside of me.

1346
01:13:30,594 --> 01:13:32,062
They stuck you
in that bank and...

1347
01:13:32,095 --> 01:13:33,229
- expected you to just follow the rules...
- I love the bank.

1348
01:13:33,262 --> 01:13:34,396
...and do the same
thing every day.

1349
01:13:34,429 --> 01:13:35,462
You are so much
more than that.

1350
01:13:35,495 --> 01:13:36,594
I don't wanna be
more than that.

1351
01:13:36,628 --> 01:13:38,262
No, and I need you
to remember it.

1352
01:13:38,295 --> 01:13:40,527
Why have you been following me
and how do you know my name?

1353
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,828
Put these on.

1354
01:13:41,862 --> 01:13:43,162
I don't have to do anything
that I don't wanna do.

1355
01:13:43,195 --> 01:13:45,560
True. The choice is totally yours.

1356
01:13:45,595 --> 01:13:47,396
Okay. Okay. Fine.

1357
01:13:52,162 --> 01:13:54,095
What is that?

1358
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:56,129
What are these?
Trick glasses or something?

1359
01:13:56,162 --> 01:13:57,029
Listen carefully.

1360
01:13:57,062 --> 01:13:59,344
In 24 hours, this world,
everyone you know,

1361
01:13:59,471 --> 01:14:01,938
it's all gonna
disappear for good.

1362
01:14:01,995 --> 01:14:03,462
Can you please
just let me go?

1363
01:14:03,495 --> 01:14:05,128
I mean, I haven't really
even seen your face.

1364
01:14:05,161 --> 01:14:06,462
I mean, I've seen
the general area,

1365
01:14:06,495 --> 01:14:07,837
but I'm not really good
with descriptive words.

1366
01:14:08,012 --> 01:14:09,545
Not really good
with words in general.

1367
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:12,279
- Screw it.
- What? Oh!

1368
01:14:49,154 --> 01:14:50,254
I remember.

1369
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,287
Welcome back.

1370
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:56,287
No. I remember everything.

1371
01:14:57,187 --> 01:14:58,786
Come with me.

1372
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:02,053
I do this every day so much,
I'd forgotten why.

1373
01:15:05,104 --> 01:15:06,803
Do you see that?

1374
01:15:06,837 --> 01:15:08,403
Right there.

1375
01:15:08,654 --> 01:15:10,186
Oh, my God.

1376
01:15:11,387 --> 01:15:12,920
Oh, my God!

1377
01:15:12,954 --> 01:15:16,587
Antwan hid our original build past
the horizon, making it invisible...

1378
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:19,787
but he forgot to scrub
the reflections.

1379
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:22,654
It's still out there, Guy.
We just can't see it.

1380
01:15:22,687 --> 01:15:24,520
If we can get there,
that is the evidence we need.

1381
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:27,620
You can't go past
the water line. I tried.

1382
01:15:27,654 --> 01:15:29,654
We need help.

1383
01:15:29,687 --> 01:15:31,754
Antwan found a way
to hide it in plain sight

1384
01:15:31,787 --> 01:15:34,086
in the one place no one
can even get to.

1385
01:15:34,121 --> 01:15:35,420
<i>I can't even believe</i>

1386
01:15:35,453 --> 01:15:36,253
<i>he's smart enough
to be this diabolical.</i>

1387
01:15:36,286 --> 01:15:37,787
Keys, I need you to focus.

1388
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:41,265
Okay. So, the reflection shows the
build past the southern horizon.

1389
01:15:41,395 --> 01:15:43,562
But the game physics won't
allow you past the beach.

1390
01:15:43,595 --> 01:15:46,001
But you think you can find a way
to get us past the collision mesh?

1391
01:15:46,078 --> 01:15:47,445
<i>We're gonna
need a bridge.</i>

1392
01:15:47,479 --> 01:15:49,645
You just get to Hitman's Beach
and I'll figure out the rest.

1393
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:51,045
And, Millie?

1394
01:15:51,445 --> 01:15:52,746
<i>Be careful.</i>

1395
01:15:52,778 --> 01:15:54,611
Antwan may be an asshole,
but he's not stupid.

1396
01:15:54,645 --> 01:15:57,297
He'll figure out what you're up to and
he'll throw everything he's got at you.

1397
01:15:57,361 --> 01:15:58,895
You're right.

1398
01:15:58,928 --> 01:16:01,795
<i>Um, hi, Millie,
and other person I can't see...</i>

1399
01:16:01,828 --> 01:16:03,361
<i>well, I have an idea.</i>

1400
01:16:03,395 --> 01:16:05,195
<i>What if he has
nothing to throw?</i>

1401
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:09,670
Everyone! Gather around!

1402
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:12,703
Thank you for coming.

1403
01:16:13,371 --> 01:16:14,837
Now, you know me, I'm Guy.

1404
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:16,470
Hi, Guy.

1405
01:16:16,691 --> 01:16:18,357
Hi.

1406
01:16:18,578 --> 01:16:21,578
What I'm about to say
may be hard to understand.

1407
01:16:22,061 --> 01:16:23,562
Really hard to understand.

1408
01:16:25,262 --> 01:16:28,562
But, are you sick
of living in the background?

1409
01:16:29,795 --> 01:16:31,629
Aren't you sick
of being shot at?

1410
01:16:31,662 --> 01:16:32,695
Enough.

1411
01:16:32,729 --> 01:16:34,262
- Taken hostage?
- No more.

1412
01:16:34,295 --> 01:16:35,629
- Run over?
- We done with that.

1413
01:16:35,662 --> 01:16:38,028
Robbed? Stabbed?
Used as a human shield?

1414
01:16:38,061 --> 01:16:39,662
We are tired of being stabbed!

1415
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:40,929
- Buddy!
- Sorry.

1416
01:16:40,962 --> 01:16:42,595
What are you
trying to say, Guy?

1417
01:16:42,629 --> 01:16:45,662
I'm tryin' to say that things in
this city don't have to be this way.

1418
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:46,903
Things can be different.

1419
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:48,170
Different how?

1420
01:16:48,203 --> 01:16:51,903
- For starters, you can put your arms down.
- Yeah.

1421
01:16:53,445 --> 01:16:56,279
There you go. You got it. Yeah.

1422
01:16:56,312 --> 01:16:57,845
Keep pushing. There you go.

1423
01:16:57,878 --> 01:16:58,911
Breathe through it.
There you go.

1424
01:16:58,945 --> 01:17:00,045
Do it. Do it. Do it.

1425
01:17:00,078 --> 01:17:01,679
No, not gonna happen.
Nope.

1426
01:17:01,712 --> 01:17:03,045
That feels unnatural.

1427
01:17:03,078 --> 01:17:05,345
I mean, what about when
someone runs in with a gun?

1428
01:17:05,379 --> 01:17:07,746
Having my arms up
is just a real time saver.

1429
01:17:07,778 --> 01:17:12,646
Except, what if the guy
with the gun doesn't come?

1430
01:17:12,679 --> 01:17:14,145
- What?
- What?

1431
01:17:14,178 --> 01:17:15,611
There's always
a guy with a gun.

1432
01:17:15,646 --> 01:17:17,511
So many guys with guns.

1433
01:17:17,544 --> 01:17:21,145
People, what if our world
doesn't have to be so scary?

1434
01:17:21,945 --> 01:17:23,612
What if we can change it?

1435
01:17:23,645 --> 01:17:29,088
Millie! How many times a day are
the banks robbed in your world?

1436
01:17:29,129 --> 01:17:30,328
Hardly ever, Guy.

1437
01:17:30,361 --> 01:17:32,528
What about corpses, Millie?

1438
01:17:32,561 --> 01:17:33,661
- What?
- You see a lot of those?

1439
01:17:33,695 --> 01:17:35,261
How many an hour?

1440
01:17:35,294 --> 01:17:36,728
None per hour, Guy.

1441
01:17:36,762 --> 01:17:38,595
What about gun violence?

1442
01:17:38,628 --> 01:17:40,294
See a lot of gun violence
in your world?

1443
01:17:40,328 --> 01:17:43,862
Actually, that's a big problem, Guy.
It's a massive problem.

1444
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:46,570
I didn't see that coming.

1445
01:17:46,603 --> 01:17:48,937
It's true. It really sucks.

1446
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:53,536
The point is, we don't have to
be spectators to our own lives.

1447
01:17:54,021 --> 01:17:55,820
We can be whatever we want.

1448
01:17:55,853 --> 01:17:57,587
We can't all be you, Guy.

1449
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:58,820
That's not true.

1450
01:17:59,996 --> 01:18:03,328
What's inside of me
is inside of you, too.

1451
01:18:03,362 --> 01:18:04,595
What?

1452
01:18:04,629 --> 01:18:07,295
It's inside of each and
every one of you. You're growing.

1453
01:18:07,328 --> 01:18:10,728
I need more in my life than drip coffee.
I want to make...

1454
01:18:10,761 --> 01:18:11,794
A cappuccino.

1455
01:18:11,829 --> 01:18:13,662
A goddamn difference
in the world.

1456
01:18:13,694 --> 01:18:14,929
Much, much better.

1457
01:18:14,962 --> 01:18:16,028
And a green tea boba.

1458
01:18:16,061 --> 01:18:17,829
- Holy shit!
- That's right!

1459
01:18:17,862 --> 01:18:19,295
You go, girl.

1460
01:18:19,328 --> 01:18:20,495
Oh, my God, you're amazing!

1461
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,328
If I could just make it out
past that water...

1462
01:18:22,362 --> 01:18:24,462
there's a world out there
where we can be free.

1463
01:18:24,495 --> 01:18:26,595
Where we get to decide
who we wanna be.

1464
01:18:26,629 --> 01:18:29,021
Where we can matter.
But we have to fight for it.

1465
01:18:29,103 --> 01:18:30,970
We have to fight together.

1466
01:18:31,003 --> 01:18:32,770
Yeah!

1467
01:18:32,887 --> 01:18:35,419
You guys have always done
what's expected of you.

1468
01:18:35,454 --> 01:18:37,120
But that shit ends today.

1469
01:18:37,154 --> 01:18:38,554
Yeah!

1470
01:18:38,587 --> 01:18:40,386
I don't even know
what's happening right now!

1471
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:41,454
But I love it!

1472
01:18:43,087 --> 01:18:44,386
I love it!

1473
01:18:45,521 --> 01:18:46,686
I love it!

1474
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,487
I love it, too!
Come on, guys, get in here!

1475
01:18:48,521 --> 01:18:51,653
Huddle up! Here's what we're gonna do!
Everyone in!

1476
01:18:57,536 --> 01:18:59,337
Everybody get
down on the ground!

1477
01:19:04,371 --> 01:19:05,603
Hello?

1478
01:19:07,069 --> 01:19:09,004
Where the hell is everybody?

1479
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:11,311
Hello?

1480
01:19:21,645 --> 01:19:23,745
Where are all the NPCs?

1481
01:19:32,179 --> 01:19:34,953
<i>Look, I've been playing</i>
Free City <i>for, like, three years now.</i>

1482
01:19:35,121 --> 01:19:37,286
<i>I've never seen
anything like this.</i>

1483
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:40,786
<i>Up until recently, I don't even know if
I'd have noticed a few NPCs going missing.</i>

1484
01:19:40,819 --> 01:19:43,887
<i>And I don't know if this is
just some whack Reddit theory...</i>

1485
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:47,920
<i>but some people are saying that
Blue Shirt Guy isn't even a player.</i>

1486
01:19:47,954 --> 01:19:50,819
- <i>That he's actual AI.</i>
- <i>AI?</i>

1487
01:19:50,854 --> 01:19:54,097
<i>Actual AI. You know, alive.</i>

1488
01:19:54,228 --> 01:19:56,529
<i>It's why Blue Shirt Guy
is trending everywhere.</i>

1489
01:19:56,562 --> 01:19:59,562
<i>Antwan, if you're watching
this, please fix the game.</i>

1490
01:19:59,594 --> 01:20:02,128
- <i>And most of all, bring back Blue Shirt.</i>
- Oh, my God. My God!

1491
01:20:02,161 --> 01:20:03,628
Antwan,
you should see this.

1492
01:20:05,729 --> 01:20:09,161
<i>And you, you tried to steal
it from me with that Molotov chick.</i>

1493
01:20:09,195 --> 01:20:10,428
- <i>Her name's Millie.</i>
- <i>Who?</i>

1494
01:20:10,462 --> 01:20:11,428
<i>Millie.</i>

1495
01:20:11,462 --> 01:20:14,529
Got her. Got her!
Got you! Got you!

1496
01:20:14,562 --> 01:20:17,295
Mouser! Put him up on the screen.
Now. Put him up.

1497
01:20:17,328 --> 01:20:18,833
That's it. Come on, quicker.

1498
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:20,604
Yes, there he is.

1499
01:20:20,637 --> 01:20:24,337
He's joyriding around Free City
with some player called Molotovgirl.

1500
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:27,554
AKA Millie Rusk.

1501
01:20:27,587 --> 01:20:29,286
Millie Rusk? Isn't that
Keys' old partner?

1502
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:30,521
Yeah.

1503
01:20:30,554 --> 01:20:32,653
Also the one who's trying to hit
me with this bogus lawsuit...

1504
01:20:32,686 --> 01:20:35,219
'cause she's desperate
for a piece of Soonami Kwan.

1505
01:20:35,253 --> 01:20:36,653
Boot Molotovgirl now.

1506
01:20:36,686 --> 01:20:40,887
I'm trying. I'm trying as hard as I
can, but her account's spoofed.

1507
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,186
This woman is exceptional.

1508
01:20:42,219 --> 01:20:43,653
Then kill her in the game.

1509
01:20:43,686 --> 01:20:46,354
"What?" Yes,
I said that. Kill her.

1510
01:20:46,387 --> 01:20:49,753
Throw everything at them,
all right? Five badges, G.

1511
01:20:49,811 --> 01:20:51,445
Yeah, just one problem.

1512
01:20:51,478 --> 01:20:52,979
We don't have anything.

1513
01:20:53,012 --> 01:20:54,179
Whatchu talking about, Willis?

1514
01:20:54,212 --> 01:20:55,712
We don't have any defenses.

1515
01:20:55,745 --> 01:20:59,311
We don't have police,
military, no nothing.

1516
01:20:59,345 --> 01:21:01,079
It's what I've been
trying to tell you.

1517
01:21:01,112 --> 01:21:04,811
It's like every
NPC went on strike.

1518
01:21:06,345 --> 01:21:08,844
Got a tall, half-caf,
double foam oat milk,

1519
01:21:08,878 --> 01:21:10,378
matcha latte with cinnamon!

1520
01:21:10,411 --> 01:21:11,912
- That's me.
- Hey.

1521
01:21:11,945 --> 01:21:13,378
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1522
01:21:13,411 --> 01:21:14,478
Cheers.

1523
01:21:16,962 --> 01:21:18,695
Go get 'em, Guy!

1524
01:21:20,262 --> 01:21:22,528
It's like a digital walkout.

1525
01:21:22,929 --> 01:21:24,629
No, it's not.

1526
01:21:24,662 --> 01:21:26,695
They're doing this on purpose,
it's part of their plan.

1527
01:21:26,729 --> 01:21:29,061
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna kill them in the game.

1528
01:21:29,095 --> 01:21:31,128
Turn off respawn,
kill them dead, now.

1529
01:21:31,161 --> 01:21:33,729
But that means any players
who die will be done for good.

1530
01:21:33,762 --> 01:21:35,195
They'll freak out.

1531
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:39,436
I don't care.

1532
01:21:39,469 --> 01:21:43,882
Sir? Sir, just to be clear,
are you telling me that it's go time?

1533
01:21:43,945 --> 01:21:45,045
Are you looking
for some sort of banter thing

1534
01:21:45,078 --> 01:21:46,212
'cause you think
we're friends now...

1535
01:21:46,244 --> 01:21:47,778
and we're in some sort
of gang together?

1536
01:21:47,811 --> 01:21:49,845
Yes. Yes, that's exactly
what I'm looking for.

1537
01:21:49,878 --> 01:21:50,911
Cool, we're a team.

1538
01:21:50,945 --> 01:21:51,978
We should come up

1539
01:21:52,012 --> 01:21:53,178
- with a catchphrase, okay?
- All right.

1540
01:21:53,212 --> 01:21:54,945
- On three. One, two, three...
- One, two, three...

1541
01:21:54,978 --> 01:21:57,078
Get back to work!

1542
01:21:57,679 --> 01:21:59,178
Someone find me Keys!

1543
01:22:03,579 --> 01:22:06,412
All right, people, you heard him.
It's go time!

1544
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:13,220
Okay, that's not good.

1545
01:22:14,621 --> 01:22:16,554
He knows where we're going.

1546
01:22:22,287 --> 01:22:24,554
All right, I got him.
I got him. Don't worry.

1547
01:22:24,587 --> 01:22:26,420
Want some four wheels
to the face?

1548
01:22:26,454 --> 01:22:27,987
Take that. Boom!

1549
01:22:31,187 --> 01:22:34,053
Rabbit's coming for you.
Apex predator.

1550
01:22:35,554 --> 01:22:36,753
Whoa!

1551
01:22:44,436 --> 01:22:46,104
Here we go.
Y'all watching this?

1552
01:22:46,137 --> 01:22:47,403
I'm about to end this fool.

1553
01:22:49,536 --> 01:22:51,903
Come on, come on, come on.

1554
01:22:51,937 --> 01:22:54,037
Keys, if you're there,
a little help, please.

1555
01:23:05,137 --> 01:23:09,337
God! Okay, who did that?
Who is doing that?

1556
01:23:09,371 --> 01:23:13,337
Don't play with me! Seriously!
I'm under way too much pressure!

1557
01:23:17,529 --> 01:23:18,529
Come on!

1558
01:23:22,629 --> 01:23:23,729
Go, go, go!

1559
01:23:38,953 --> 01:23:41,187
I just checked with security.
Keys hasn't left the building.

1560
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:42,521
Oh, sounds like you've
done everything possible.

1561
01:23:42,554 --> 01:23:43,653
Time to give up?
You wanna give up?

1562
01:23:43,686 --> 01:23:44,653
No, I'm sensing you
want me to keep looking.

1563
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:45,920
- Go.
- I'll be back.

1564
01:23:45,953 --> 01:23:48,953
I have no idea where
these fools are running to.

1565
01:23:48,986 --> 01:23:52,554
I do. Southern shore.
Hitman's Beach.

1566
01:23:52,587 --> 01:23:54,953
Well, that's stupid.
There's nothing out there but water.

1567
01:23:54,986 --> 01:23:57,853
Game physics won't even let
you get past the shoreline.

1568
01:23:59,204 --> 01:24:01,403
Unless there is
something out there.

1569
01:24:02,436 --> 01:24:04,403
Antwan, is there
something there?

1570
01:24:05,603 --> 01:24:07,836
Screw it. Art nerds.

1571
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:09,204
Time for Dude.

1572
01:24:09,237 --> 01:24:10,371
We're still working on him.

1573
01:24:10,403 --> 01:24:12,802
I worked on him myself.
He's perfect.

1574
01:24:12,837 --> 01:24:14,904
Drop in Dude now.

1575
01:24:14,937 --> 01:24:16,702
Just do it. He's got,
like, half a brain...

1576
01:24:16,736 --> 01:24:20,104
he's barely written,
but sure, start the upload.

1577
01:24:27,637 --> 01:24:28,802
What are we
supposed to do now?

1578
01:24:28,837 --> 01:24:32,037
Now Keys
finds us a bridge.

1579
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:35,137
Come to collect those
knives you stabbed in my back, bro?

1580
01:24:36,837 --> 01:24:38,702
You've been helping Millie
Rusk this whole time.

1581
01:24:38,736 --> 01:24:40,304
She's looking for your build.

1582
01:24:40,337 --> 01:24:42,104
What build, Antwan?

1583
01:24:42,137 --> 01:24:43,870
It's not like you used
our code anyway, right?

1584
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:45,271
And if you didn't
use our code...

1585
01:24:45,304 --> 01:24:48,229
then how can our original
build be in the game, right?

1586
01:24:48,353 --> 01:24:50,452
Or am I missing something?

1587
01:24:51,903 --> 01:24:53,103
Leave us.

1588
01:24:56,370 --> 01:25:00,036
Okay, Keys,
let's have a real talk.

1589
01:25:00,070 --> 01:25:02,970
If I'd put out your dumb game,
it would have bombed.

1590
01:25:03,003 --> 01:25:04,437
Antwan, you don't know
it would've failed.

1591
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:05,637
Yeah, I do know.

1592
01:25:05,670 --> 01:25:08,504
I looked at the numbers,
the tracking, the focus groups.

1593
01:25:08,537 --> 01:25:12,337
Has it ever occurred to you that
some things matter more than numbers?

1594
01:25:12,370 --> 01:25:15,003
What matters more
than numbers? Money?

1595
01:25:15,036 --> 01:25:17,871
Yo, news flash, bro,
money is still numbers.

1596
01:25:17,903 --> 01:25:19,470
Nothing matters
more than numbers!

1597
01:25:19,504 --> 01:25:20,903
You should be thanking me!

1598
01:25:20,936 --> 01:25:22,202
I should be thanking you?

1599
01:25:22,236 --> 01:25:24,370
What about the profits
that you got from our work?

1600
01:25:24,404 --> 01:25:26,537
You chose your side,
little Padawan.

1601
01:25:26,570 --> 01:25:30,437
And now, it's time for you to take
your place next to the Emperor.

1602
01:25:30,470 --> 01:25:31,470
You get me, bro?

1603
01:25:32,212 --> 01:25:35,254
Yeah, I get you...
bro.

1604
01:25:35,454 --> 01:25:37,986
Which leads me to this.

1605
01:25:52,937 --> 01:25:54,137
Thanks, Keys.

1606
01:25:58,669 --> 01:26:00,837
What the hell was that?

1607
01:26:00,870 --> 01:26:03,570
Hey, Antwan,
things are getting hectic.

1608
01:26:06,602 --> 01:26:09,470
Oh, I thought you were
smarter than this, Keys.

1609
01:26:09,503 --> 01:26:11,702
You're obviously fired,
you know that.

1610
01:26:11,737 --> 01:26:14,835
And you, what is she still
doing in the game, man?

1611
01:26:14,879 --> 01:26:15,779
Boot everyone.

1612
01:26:15,812 --> 01:26:18,179
Hold up. You want me
to boot all the players?

1613
01:26:18,212 --> 01:26:20,112
Boot them out
of the game, now!

1614
01:26:20,146 --> 01:26:21,879
Cancel every player account!

1615
01:26:21,912 --> 01:26:23,578
And where the hell is Dude?

1616
01:26:23,612 --> 01:26:26,578
Security! Kick this punk out.

1617
01:26:32,311 --> 01:26:33,411
Guy!

1618
01:26:33,444 --> 01:26:35,311
- Millie!
- They're taking me out.

1619
01:26:35,345 --> 01:26:36,779
What's happening?

1620
01:26:36,812 --> 01:26:37,745
It's on you now.
Everybody's watching.

1621
01:26:37,779 --> 01:26:38,812
You gotta keep going.

1622
01:26:38,845 --> 01:26:41,345
Wait, wait, wait!
Will I see you again?

1623
01:26:41,378 --> 01:26:43,012
You will if you make it
across that bridge.

1624
01:26:43,045 --> 01:26:44,950
Show the whole world our build.
That's the proof.

1625
01:26:45,071 --> 01:26:47,538
You do that, Antwan is done.

1626
01:26:47,766 --> 01:26:48,766
I'll make it.

1627
01:26:52,629 --> 01:26:53,695
I'll make it.

1628
01:26:54,829 --> 01:26:56,028
What the hell?

1629
01:26:57,662 --> 01:26:59,261
What's going on?

1630
01:27:38,162 --> 01:27:42,595
All right, let's all remember this
moment, before we were fired.

1631
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:44,271
Oh!

1632
01:27:44,304 --> 01:27:45,703
Wow.

1633
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:51,687
Catchphrase.

1634
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:53,352
<i>Catchphrase?</i>

1635
01:27:53,387 --> 01:27:54,920
What? I haven't had time
to think one up yet.

1636
01:27:54,954 --> 01:27:58,754
Although "catchphrase" as a catchphrase
is a pretty cool catchphrase.

1637
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:04,285
Whoa.

1638
01:28:05,319 --> 01:28:08,487
Get up, Guy. Get up.

1639
01:28:20,862 --> 01:28:22,729
Oh, no, no, no.

1640
01:28:27,028 --> 01:28:30,295
Guy, I came to save you.

1641
01:28:32,194 --> 01:28:34,562
- Who is this?
- I don't know.

1642
01:28:34,595 --> 01:28:35,762
He's glorious.

1643
01:28:37,112 --> 01:28:38,612
I mean, he's just like you...

1644
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:40,178
but way better.

1645
01:28:41,810 --> 01:28:44,112
Way, way better.

1646
01:28:44,145 --> 01:28:46,012
- Thank you.
- No, that's not a compliment.

1647
01:28:46,045 --> 01:28:47,412
I wouldn't touch him
if I were you, Buddy.

1648
01:28:47,445 --> 01:28:48,910
What do you mean you don't
think I should touch him?

1649
01:28:48,945 --> 01:28:50,512
You don't mind this, do you?

1650
01:28:50,545 --> 01:28:52,479
'Cause I'm your buddy, too.

1651
01:28:56,178 --> 01:28:58,612
Yeah, I think he's
gonna... hit you.

1652
01:28:58,646 --> 01:28:59,712
He punches so hard.

1653
01:28:59,746 --> 01:29:00,844
But yet his hands are so soft.

1654
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:02,279
- Be strong.
- Okay, bye.

1655
01:29:02,312 --> 01:29:04,545
Hey, it's like I'm a feather to him.

1656
01:29:04,579 --> 01:29:06,212
Whee!

1657
01:29:06,245 --> 01:29:07,612
Ha-ha!

1658
01:29:10,554 --> 01:29:11,887
Oh...

1659
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:17,786
<i>No, no, no! No!</i>

1660
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:20,652
Get up, Guy, get up!

1661
01:29:21,070 --> 01:29:22,435
Playtime's over. Catchphrase.

1662
01:29:22,469 --> 01:29:23,670
I don't know
what that means.

1663
01:29:26,271 --> 01:29:27,837
<i>Come on, man. Get up!</i>

1664
01:29:27,870 --> 01:29:28,870
Get up.

1665
01:29:29,845 --> 01:29:32,612
There are three things
I love in life.

1666
01:29:32,645 --> 01:29:37,411
Kickin' ass, TBD,
third thing here.

1667
01:29:41,411 --> 01:29:43,578
<i>Oof! Oh, shit!</i>

1668
01:29:45,277 --> 01:29:46,945
Activate death blow.

1669
01:29:46,979 --> 01:29:47,979
Bye, Guy.

1670
01:29:52,612 --> 01:29:54,712
Oh, shit, that's a death blow.

1671
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:57,553
Get up!

1672
01:29:57,587 --> 01:30:00,353
Mom, he's coming in
with a death blow!

1673
01:30:03,003 --> 01:30:04,170
Get up, Guy.

1674
01:30:10,203 --> 01:30:11,270
Oh.

1675
01:30:13,270 --> 01:30:15,103
What the shit?

1676
01:30:22,537 --> 01:30:23,935
That was dope.

1677
01:30:39,595 --> 01:30:41,295
- Hold on. Is that...
- That's a...

1678
01:30:41,329 --> 01:30:44,527
Yes! That's a
lightsaber, Dude.

1679
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,095
Mm-hmm.

1680
01:30:50,762 --> 01:30:52,895
- Is that a lightsaber?
- It is.

1681
01:31:28,512 --> 01:31:29,512
Oh!

1682
01:31:35,662 --> 01:31:36,762
Guy!

1683
01:31:38,662 --> 01:31:40,161
Yes!

1684
01:31:40,195 --> 01:31:42,995
Yes! That's right.
Get up, Guy. Come on.

1685
01:32:03,570 --> 01:32:04,570
There you go.

1686
01:32:05,303 --> 01:32:07,370
Do you see them
all now? Yeah?

1687
01:32:07,404 --> 01:32:08,736
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?

1688
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:11,637
Yeah, shiny things everywhere.

1689
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,454
Yeah, there you go. Go get it.

1690
01:32:14,486 --> 01:32:16,553
Just lots of little snacks.

1691
01:32:19,853 --> 01:32:23,553
Yeah, not a dancer. No.

1692
01:32:23,586 --> 01:32:25,387
Run free, better me.

1693
01:32:26,371 --> 01:32:27,803
Let's go.

1694
01:32:27,837 --> 01:32:29,303
Where are we going?

1695
01:32:29,337 --> 01:32:31,337
We can't let them
get across that bridge.

1696
01:32:31,371 --> 01:32:33,104
You wanna finish
this out with me?

1697
01:32:33,137 --> 01:32:36,337
Look, I don't even know what's going
on, but hell yes, I'm with you.

1698
01:32:36,371 --> 01:32:38,104
Ha-ha!

1699
01:32:38,137 --> 01:32:39,904
Let's go!

1700
01:33:04,595 --> 01:33:05,895
Antwan, come on, man.

1701
01:33:05,929 --> 01:33:08,395
What are we doing here?

1702
01:33:09,328 --> 01:33:11,028
Where are the servers
to <i>Free City 1?</i>

1703
01:33:11,061 --> 01:33:14,195
No. Antwan,
what the hell are you doing?

1704
01:33:14,228 --> 01:33:17,929
If they get past that horizon to the
build, I lose everything!

1705
01:33:17,962 --> 01:33:19,362
Wait, so you did
steal their code.

1706
01:33:19,395 --> 01:33:21,929
Welcome to
the conversation, genius.

1707
01:33:21,962 --> 01:33:23,629
Now, where are
those servers?

1708
01:33:23,662 --> 01:33:25,195
It's all of these, but hold on.
I'm trying to wrap my head around this.

1709
01:33:25,228 --> 01:33:26,662
All these? This one?
Right, this one?

1710
01:33:26,695 --> 01:33:28,061
Yeah. How did you...

1711
01:33:34,337 --> 01:33:35,337
Run.

1712
01:33:39,795 --> 01:33:40,795
Antwan!

1713
01:33:51,220 --> 01:33:52,254
Stop!

1714
01:33:55,254 --> 01:33:56,554
Officer Johnny!

1715
01:33:56,587 --> 01:33:57,987
- Come on!
- Come on!

1716
01:34:01,053 --> 01:34:03,720
Which server has the ocean
and the rest of the bridge?

1717
01:34:03,753 --> 01:34:04,820
I'm not gonna tell you.

1718
01:34:04,853 --> 01:34:05,920
You're just
gonna destroy it.

1719
01:34:05,953 --> 01:34:07,453
Yeah. 'Cause it's my game.

1720
01:34:07,487 --> 01:34:10,786
Except it's not.
It's Keys' game.

1721
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:12,521
You didn't do shit.

1722
01:34:12,554 --> 01:34:15,686
And guess what?
Keys is my boy.

1723
01:34:15,837 --> 01:34:16,904
Security!

1724
01:34:16,937 --> 01:34:20,371
Please escort this former
employee off the premises.

1725
01:34:20,403 --> 01:34:22,436
He can call you
by your real name.

1726
01:34:41,837 --> 01:34:43,436
Guy!

1727
01:34:43,470 --> 01:34:45,371
- Buddy! Buddy!
- No, no! Keep going!

1728
01:34:45,403 --> 01:34:47,235
Go without me!

1729
01:34:47,278 --> 01:34:49,512
I've been scared
my whole damn life.

1730
01:34:50,761 --> 01:34:52,694
But I'm not scared anymore.

1731
01:34:55,862 --> 01:34:57,195
I'm sorry.

1732
01:34:57,794 --> 01:34:59,195
I'm not.

1733
01:35:01,929 --> 01:35:04,061
It's been the
best day of my life.

1734
01:35:04,444 --> 01:35:06,279
You get to that build.

1735
01:35:07,646 --> 01:35:09,212
You show 'em we matter.

1736
01:35:14,911 --> 01:35:19,612
That security guard right
there was a goddamn hero.

1737
01:36:58,637 --> 01:37:01,670
You did it!

1738
01:37:09,936 --> 01:37:11,704
Yes! Yes!

1739
01:37:11,737 --> 01:37:14,203
Suck it, Antwan! Whoo!

1740
01:37:15,262 --> 01:37:16,828
Antwan, stop!

1741
01:37:17,496 --> 01:37:18,895
It's over.

1742
01:37:21,094 --> 01:37:22,695
He made it.

1743
01:37:22,728 --> 01:37:26,695
Got your game's original build
out there for everyone to see.

1744
01:37:26,728 --> 01:37:28,595
Probably win
your lawsuit, huh?

1745
01:37:29,162 --> 01:37:30,262
Looks likely.

1746
01:37:30,295 --> 01:37:31,762
Cool.

1747
01:37:31,795 --> 01:37:35,661
And here's the thing, bro.
Here's the thing.

1748
01:37:35,695 --> 01:37:38,504
Right here, I got
everything you care about.

1749
01:37:38,587 --> 01:37:42,786
The sliver that's left of <i>Free City,</i>
all your little background friends...

1750
01:37:42,820 --> 01:37:45,253
including your
digital boyfriend.

1751
01:37:45,745 --> 01:37:47,678
Last server.

1752
01:37:47,712 --> 01:37:52,979
Look, I just want the world that
I built and the people in it.

1753
01:37:53,012 --> 01:37:54,446
What's in it for Antwan?

1754
01:37:54,553 --> 01:37:55,754
Everything else.

1755
01:37:55,787 --> 01:37:57,587
Meaning? Pretend I'm dumb.

1756
01:37:57,620 --> 01:38:00,054
You have the rights to our
code, keep all the profits...

1757
01:38:00,087 --> 01:38:02,186
just give me
what's left of <i>Free City.</i>

1758
01:38:02,220 --> 01:38:04,220
Let me build my
own world from there.

1759
01:38:04,253 --> 01:38:08,087
What about <i>Free City 2?</i>
<i>Free City 3?</i>

1760
01:38:08,121 --> 01:38:09,619
And all pursuant spin-offs?

1761
01:38:09,653 --> 01:38:12,719
All yours.
Just put down the axe.

1762
01:38:12,754 --> 01:38:15,387
You know that this is, like,
the dumbest deal

1763
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:17,854
in the history of
dumb deals, right?

1764
01:38:17,887 --> 01:38:20,286
I mean, you're talking about
giving up millions of dollars.

1765
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:22,146
Why would anyone do that?

1766
01:38:22,295 --> 01:38:24,662
'Cause Keys and I
made something great.

1767
01:38:26,695 --> 01:38:29,795
And I don't need money or
fame to prove that to myself.

1768
01:38:29,829 --> 01:38:32,762
I'm done playing
your game, Antwan.

1769
01:38:34,996 --> 01:38:37,295
It's time I played mine.

1770
01:38:38,303 --> 01:38:39,537
Deal?

1771
01:38:48,445 --> 01:38:50,746
<i>Popping today
and not in a good way.</i>

1772
01:38:50,811 --> 01:38:53,278
<i>Sales for</i> Free City 2
<i>continue to slip...</i>

1773
01:38:53,311 --> 01:38:57,421
<i>with numerous reports of bugs in
the code and lagging online play.</i>

1774
01:38:57,621 --> 01:38:59,953
<i>Embattled Soonami game founder
Antwan Hovachelik</i>

1775
01:38:59,987 --> 01:39:01,387
<i>finds himself
in the crosshairs.</i>

1776
01:39:01,420 --> 01:39:02,786
Crosshairs.

1777
01:39:02,820 --> 01:39:04,621
He's in the crosshairs and embattled.

1778
01:39:04,653 --> 01:39:06,052
We're too busy to gloat.

1779
01:39:06,086 --> 01:39:07,953
<i>I'm a victim! I'm a victim!</i>

1780
01:39:07,987 --> 01:39:09,887
Speaking of busy,
we just doubled

1781
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:11,922
the amount of unique
visitors we can handle.

1782
01:39:11,937 --> 01:39:12,836
It's amazing.

1783
01:39:12,869 --> 01:39:14,536
Who'd have thought
that so many people...

1784
01:39:14,570 --> 01:39:17,603
would just wanna watch video game
characters instead of shoot at them?

1785
01:39:18,070 --> 01:39:19,170
Hmm...

1786
01:39:20,037 --> 01:39:21,104
Oh, yeah, we did.

1787
01:39:21,137 --> 01:39:22,903
Yeah.

1788
01:39:23,937 --> 01:39:26,869
You know,
you're pretty cute when you brag.

1789
01:39:26,903 --> 01:39:27,970
<i>Antwan out!</i>

1790
01:39:28,004 --> 01:39:29,737
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>the game</i> Free Life

1791

1792
01:39:32,271 --> 01:39:35,529
<i>Players are swarming to this

1794
01:39:38,970 --> 01:39:41,913
<i>and is now no longer in the

1795
01:39:42,005 --> 01:39:43,204
Uh, hey, Mills...

1796
01:39:45,387 --> 01:39:47,820
Do you wanna come
grab a coffee with me?

1797
01:39:47,854 --> 01:39:50,353
Actually, I'm gonna jump
back into the game.

1798
01:39:51,896 --> 01:39:54,262
- Oh.
- Coffee?

1799
01:39:54,295 --> 01:39:56,729
Okay. Yeah. Sounds good.

1800
01:39:56,762 --> 01:39:58,328
I'll just, uh, grab you one.

1801
01:39:58,829 --> 01:39:59,929
Oh, Keys, uh...

1802
01:39:59,962 --> 01:40:01,662
I know, medium coffee,
cream, two sugars.

1803
01:40:01,695 --> 01:40:02,729
Yeah.

1804
01:40:12,804 --> 01:40:15,203
Hi, Randy. Milton.

1805
01:40:17,604 --> 01:40:19,336
Hmm.

1806
01:40:19,370 --> 01:40:21,036
I was wondering
when I'd see you again.

1807
01:40:22,336 --> 01:40:24,804
Yeah, life has
been pretty crazy lately.

1808
01:40:24,837 --> 01:40:26,070
You should see it in here.

1809
01:40:26,103 --> 01:40:28,470
We're talkin' free
bubble gum ice cream for life.

1810
01:40:28,504 --> 01:40:30,269
Wow.

1811
01:40:32,670 --> 01:40:33,670
Hey, guys.

1812
01:40:43,204 --> 01:40:45,170
Look, Guy...

1813
01:40:45,204 --> 01:40:47,536
Wow, this is harder
than I thought.

1814
01:40:48,137 --> 01:40:49,870
Then let me do it for you.

1815
01:40:50,702 --> 01:40:52,137
Guy...

1816
01:40:54,802 --> 01:40:58,137
you are dreamy.

1817
01:40:59,670 --> 01:41:04,237
Your taste in blue shirts and
five-octave musical superstars...

1818
01:41:04,271 --> 01:41:08,536
it's deeply, deeply
attractive to me.

1819
01:41:08,570 --> 01:41:11,104
But I can't keep spending
all my time with you.

1820
01:41:11,137 --> 01:41:16,470
I created this world,
but I can't live my life in it.

1821
01:41:20,581 --> 01:41:23,147
See? Was that so hard?

1822
01:41:24,436 --> 01:41:26,503
So, what are you gonna do?

1823
01:41:26,929 --> 01:41:29,629
Anything I want.
Thanks to you.

1824
01:41:30,733 --> 01:41:32,467
I'm not stuck
in a loop anymore.

1825
01:41:32,695 --> 01:41:34,294
Neither are you.

1826
01:41:36,470 --> 01:41:39,137
I love you, Millie.

1827
01:41:39,333 --> 01:41:42,767
Maybe that is my programming
talking, but guess what?

1828
01:41:43,903 --> 01:41:46,270
Someone wrote that program.

1829
01:41:48,236 --> 01:41:50,470
I'm just a love letter to you.

1830
01:41:51,303 --> 01:41:54,036
Somewhere out there
is the author.

1831
01:42:11,737 --> 01:42:15,637
<i>You brought him to life.
You brought him to life.</i>

1832
01:42:15,670 --> 01:42:17,936
<i>And he was alive because
he met the one person</i>

1833
01:42:17,970 --> 01:42:19,704
<i>he'd been waiting for
his whole life.</i>

1834
01:42:19,737 --> 01:42:23,102
And I had to make it
realistic, so...

1835
01:42:23,727 --> 01:42:25,794
I based it off of...

1836
01:42:27,429 --> 01:42:28,628
you.

1837
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:32,695
The woman of his dreams...

1838
01:42:35,329 --> 01:42:37,029
she was the same as mine.

1839
01:42:37,062 --> 01:42:40,595
<i>So she liked bubble gum
ice cream and swing sets...</i>

1840
01:42:40,628 --> 01:42:44,595
<i>and she had this very cute
but oddly specific habit...</i>

1841
01:42:44,628 --> 01:42:48,062
<i>of always humming this
classic Mariah Carey track.</i>

1842
01:42:48,095 --> 01:42:51,528
<i>Like, all the time,
she would... repeat.</i>

1843
01:42:54,278 --> 01:42:55,477
Finally!

1844
01:43:02,112 --> 01:43:03,311
Keys!

1845
01:43:11,153 --> 01:43:12,887
What are you...

1846
01:43:53,287 --> 01:43:55,154
You okay, little guy Guy?

1847
01:43:55,187 --> 01:43:56,920
You seem adjective.

1848
01:43:56,953 --> 01:43:59,753
I'm great. I'm great.
You could put me down, by the way.

1849
01:43:59,785 --> 01:44:01,621
Thank you. That was nice.

1850
01:44:01,653 --> 01:44:05,220
No, I'm great.
You're great, Dude.

1851
01:44:06,496 --> 01:44:08,429
I just miss my best friend.

1852
01:44:09,795 --> 01:44:12,895
We used to do the same walk
together every day.

1853
01:44:12,928 --> 01:44:16,462
Except he wore a shirt.
And could complete a full sentence.

1854
01:44:16,496 --> 01:44:18,095
I can bench press
a sentence.

1855
01:44:18,129 --> 01:44:21,795
Yeah, that's totally
not the same thing at all.

1856
01:44:21,828 --> 01:44:24,095
Harder laughter!

1857
01:44:24,862 --> 01:44:25,895
Oh...

1858
01:44:25,928 --> 01:44:27,062
Guy?

1859
01:44:29,627 --> 01:44:31,595
- Buddy!
- No!

1860
01:44:31,627 --> 01:44:32,862
Oh, my God! Guy!

1861
01:44:32,895 --> 01:44:34,462
Buddy! I thought I'd lost you!

1862
01:44:34,496 --> 01:44:35,828
You didn't!

1863
01:44:35,862 --> 01:44:37,862
One minute, I'm running on
a crazy bridge to nowhere...

1864
01:44:37,895 --> 01:44:40,195
thinkin' my sweet
mundane life is over.

1865
01:44:40,229 --> 01:44:42,995
The next minute, I'm like
in some type of flyin'...

1866
01:44:43,029 --> 01:44:45,129
and some like fairy dust,
pixie dust...

1867
01:44:45,162 --> 01:44:49,262
and then I plopped down
into this slice of heaven.

1868
01:44:49,295 --> 01:44:51,862
Man, I love it here.

1869
01:44:51,895 --> 01:44:54,429
In fact, a couple of days ago,
I rode a centaur.

1870
01:44:54,462 --> 01:44:55,828
Now, it might sound weird...

1871
01:44:55,862 --> 01:44:59,262
I took a piggyback ride on a
half-dude and a half-horse...

1872
01:44:59,295 --> 01:45:01,414
whatever a centaur
is, I did it.

1873
01:45:01,502 --> 01:45:03,037
I rode a dude, too!

1874
01:45:03,070 --> 01:45:04,337
Friendly gesture!

1875
01:45:04,371 --> 01:45:06,037
So friendly!

1876
01:45:06,070 --> 01:45:07,469
Come on, bring it in!

1877
01:45:07,502 --> 01:45:08,837
- Are we gonna hug?
- I'm coming for you!

1878
01:45:08,870 --> 01:45:10,304
- No, you're not.
- I'm coming for you. Yes, I am!

1879
01:45:10,337 --> 01:45:11,570
- You come here!
- I'm coming to you!

1880
01:45:11,603 --> 01:45:13,337
I'm reeling you in.
I'm reeling you in.

1881
01:45:16,094 --> 01:45:17,762
Buddy, I missed you!

1882
01:45:17,795 --> 01:45:19,795
Hey, so where's the bank?

1883
01:45:21,070 --> 01:45:22,570
There is no bank.

1884
01:45:22,604 --> 01:45:24,070
So what do we do?

1885
01:45:24,103 --> 01:45:26,337
Whatever we want.

1886
01:45:34,570 --> 01:45:36,570
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Guy.

1887
01:45:36,648 --> 01:45:39,406
