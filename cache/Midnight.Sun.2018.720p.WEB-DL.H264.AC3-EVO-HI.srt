[woman's voice]
<i>I have this reoccurring dream.</i>

3
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,117
<i>I'm a little
girl sitting with my mom,</i>

4
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:05,153
<i>and she's singing to me.</i>

5
00:01:05,155 --> 00:01:08,123
<i>I feel the warmth
of the sun on my skin</i>

6
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:09,694
<i>and the comfort of her arms
around me.</i>

7
00:01:11,227 --> 00:01:13,230
[sighs] <i>And I wanna stay there.</i>

8
00:01:14,298 --> 00:01:16,231
<i>Forever.</i>

9
00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:19,836
<i>When I wake up,
I miss the dream.</i>

10
00:01:19,838 --> 00:01:22,638
<i>I want so badly
for this dream to be real,</i>

11
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,307
<i>but that would be impossible</i>

12
00:01:25,309 --> 00:01:28,409
<i>because my mom died
when I was really little.</i>

13
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:30,379
<i>And I can't go out in the sun.</i>

14
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,081
<i>Like, at all.</i>

15
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:36,517
<i>I have a rare genetic condition
called Xeroderma Pigmentosum,</i>

16
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:40,121
<i>or XP, which basically means</i>

17
00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:42,290
<i>a severe sensitivity
to sunlight.</i>

18
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:44,793
<i>If the sun hits my skin,
I get skin cancer,</i>

19
00:01:44,795 --> 00:01:47,364
<i>my brain starts to fail
and I could die.</i>

20
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:49,865
<i>Pretty fun, right?</i>

21
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:53,734
<i>So, I spend all my time indoors
behind special windows,</i>

22
00:01:53,736 --> 00:01:57,739
<i>hanging out with my dad
who is the best dad ever.</i>

23
00:01:57,741 --> 00:01:59,875
<i>Thank goodness,
because growing up,</i>

24
00:01:59,877 --> 00:02:02,743
<i>kids were, uh,
what you'd expect.</i>

25
00:02:02,745 --> 00:02:04,848
- [girl] No way.
- Yep, a vampire.

26
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,748
That's why they have
special windows.

27
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,851
Don't worry. She can't
get us during the day.

28
00:02:08,853 --> 00:02:12,653
But at night,
stay far, far away.

29
00:02:12,655 --> 00:02:14,615
[woman's voice] <i>But not everyone
was afraid of me.</i>

30
00:02:17,227 --> 00:02:19,296
- Hey, Morgan.
- What's wrong with her?

31
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:25,467
She has something called XP.

32
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:29,841
Basically, the light from
the sun, it-it hurts her.

33
00:02:31,308 --> 00:02:33,609
So she can't ever go
in the sun.

34
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,879
I can't be in the sun
for too long either.

35
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:38,379
Can she play at night?

36
00:02:38,381 --> 00:02:40,184
- Yeah, but...
- See you tonight.

37
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:43,352
Oh, and I like pizza!

40
00:02:47,826 --> 00:02:51,827
<i>Until one day, I saw Charlie.</i>

41

<i>And that was it.</i>

42

<i>And yet,
he had no idea I even existed.</i>

46

<i>Over time,
watching Charlie go by</i>

But I really wanna
state for the record

that my gym teacher had absolutely

00:16:59,342 --> 00:17:00,774
How could you do this to me?

314
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:02,110
Oh, my God,
I'm in sweatpants.

315

My hair, it's-it's a mess.
It's tied.

[growls] Oh, my God,
I look like an idiot.

Oh, please. Katie,
you're super freakin' hot, okay?

318
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,286
I can't even see you right now and
I can tell you look gorgeous.

319
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:13,653
Hi, excuse me.
Can I just get a large...

320

Can you not see
I'm on the phone?

He really likes you, okay?
I can tell.

Don't ramble too much.</i>

Wow, you exist.

330
00:17:47,624 --> 00:17:50,290
I thought I was dreaming
last night or something.

331
00:17:50,292 --> 00:17:53,126
Were you in the REM
stage of sleep?

332
00:17:53,128 --> 00:17:54,261
What?

333
00:17:54,263 --> 00:17:56,763
That's when most
dreams happen, actually.

334
00:17:56,765 --> 00:18:00,134
Yeah, your brain activity
is super high and functioning,

335
00:18:00,136 --> 00:18:03,270
and your eyes are just going
nuts behind your eyelids.

336
00:18:03,272 --> 00:18:06,774
It looks super weird. It's like
a typewriter or something.

337
00:18:06,776 --> 00:18:09,443
Um, anyway, thank you for...

338
00:18:09,445 --> 00:18:11,711
Wait, I, uh... I still
don't know your name.

339
00:18:11,713 --> 00:18:12,713
Oh.

340
00:18:13,782 --> 00:18:16,183
- It's Katie.
- Katie, I'm Charlie.

00:18:17,686 --> 00:18:19,686
Wow, that's a weird name.

343

Thank God you told me it 'cause I
wouldn't have known it otherwise.

344
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:24,459
Thank you.

345

- You didn't...

346
00:18:28,866 --> 00:18:31,499
You didn't read through it,
did you?

347
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:33,201
Uh, just a little. I...

348
00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:34,402
- What?
- What?

349
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,369
Are you serious?
You read through my journal?

350
00:18:36,371 --> 00:18:38,205
- Look, I...
- This could have been a diary.

351
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,808
I mean, it is, kind of.

352
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,741
Um, I'm... I'm really sorry.

353
00:18:41,743 --> 00:18:43,743
You left really quick
the other night,

354
00:18:43,745 --> 00:18:45,346
and I really had no idea
who it belonged to,

355
00:18:45,348 --> 00:18:46,747
so I just
looked through it quickly.

356
00:18:46,749 --> 00:18:48,850
But I like that you
still handwrite things.

357
00:18:48,852 --> 00:18:50,753
It's... It's cool.
It's old school.

00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,857
Thanks... for finding it.

359
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:56,859
Yeah.

360
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:00,661
Wait!

361
00:19:00,663 --> 00:19:02,262

You have to...

362

Um...

364

I... I had to... I... I'm...
I'm walking home.

365
00:19:09,705 --> 00:19:10,706
Can I walk with you?

366
00:19:12,842 --> 00:19:14,809
Um, yeah.

367
00:19:14,811 --> 00:19:18,145
So, you were home-schooled, huh?
Man, that must have been wild.

368
00:19:18,147 --> 00:19:20,915
Actually, it was the exact
opposite of wild.

369
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:23,151
My dad's pretty protective.

370
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:26,287
He's not, like, watching us
right now, is he?

371
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:29,390
Oh, yeah. He has his phone
tapped into every camera.

[both laugh]

So, um, what did you think
of the songs you read?

374
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:39,232
Without my permission,
I may add.

375
00:19:39,234 --> 00:19:41,538
Um, honestly, I don't know.

376
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,605
I mean, you can't really
read a song, right?

377
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:45,907
True.

378
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:48,643
I guess I'd have
to hear you sing them.

379
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,645
Um, so anyway,
I'm right up here.

380
00:19:51,647 --> 00:19:53,516
So, you don't have to walk me.

381
00:19:55,217 --> 00:19:57,384
Wait, you live up there?

382
00:19:57,386 --> 00:19:58,952
I-I don't understand
how we've never met.

383
00:19:58,954 --> 00:20:00,453
I've probably
skated by your house,

384
00:20:00,455 --> 00:20:01,788

on the way to practice.

385
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,827
It's a... funny coincidence.

00:20:08,463 --> 00:20:09,500
Um...

388
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:11,801
thanks.

389
00:20:15,204 --> 00:20:17,540
Hey, you wouldn't wanna do
something sometime, would you?

390
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:21,275
Um... together?

391
00:20:21,277 --> 00:20:23,915
Yes, us together.
Hanging out.

392
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:28,784
Um... I'm really busy
during the day.

393
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,925
But... I could be free at night.

394
00:20:35,357 --> 00:20:36,857
I could be free at night.

Well, you should
put your number in here then.

397
00:20:43,265 --> 00:20:45,333
I'm old school too.

Smooth.

it disgusts me.

403
00:20:59,448 --> 00:21:01,481
It didn't come up.

What do you mean,
it didn't come up?

tell someone you're sick,

a disease and less like a person.

I promise,

but I don't know
when I'm gonna see him again.

with me at the ice cream shop?

- Yes, Garver.

His parents are out of town tonight
and he's throwing a party.

417
00:21:34,651 --> 00:21:36,483
And he told me to bring friends.

418

- So, I'm gonna bring you...
- No, no, no, no, no...

- And you're gonna bring Charlie.
- No.

He's gotta, like, you know...

Doesn't... I have to wait
till he texts me first, right?

Yeah, totally.

00:50:23,077 --> 00:50:25,113
they just saw me
as that guy in the pool.

940
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,720
I don't have to live
that life anymore.

941
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,055
You know...

942
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:37,192
you're not the guy
in the pool.

943
00:50:38,658 --> 00:50:43,298
But you're not the guy
that doesn't try either.

944
00:50:50,303 --> 00:50:54,343
Do everything you can
right now and then decide.

945
00:50:56,144 --> 00:50:58,146
'Cause now
is all that matters.

946
00:51:03,718 --> 00:51:05,450
You're right.

947
00:51:05,452 --> 00:51:07,088
Okay.

948
00:51:11,626 --> 00:51:13,526
Speaking of tomorrow morning,

949
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,629
ready for the greatest sunrise
on the planet?

950
00:51:20,068 --> 00:51:21,502
What?

951
00:51:23,806 --> 00:51:25,374
Charlie, what time is it?

952
00:51:29,609 --> 00:51:30,711
It's 4:50.

953
00:51:33,513 --> 00:51:35,383
It's not waterproof.

954
00:51:40,488 --> 00:51:42,187
- Oh, my God.
- What?

955
00:51:42,189 --> 00:51:43,756
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Katie, wait!

956
00:51:43,758 --> 00:51:44,858
- Shit.
- What are you doing?

957
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,528
- I need to go!
- Katie, wait! Katie!

Shit.

961
00:52:07,147 --> 00:52:08,347
Hey, get in. Let me drive you.

962
00:52:10,618 --> 00:52:13,785
- Go, Charlie, go!
- [tires squealing]

Katie!

964

- What the hell is going on?
- You don't understand.

965
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:19,792
- You have to go as fast as you can!
- Okay, I'm going. I'm going.

966
00:52:19,794 --> 00:52:22,595
- Katie, what...
- Please just go, Charlie.

967
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,263
- You're scaring me.
- You have to speed! Faster!

968
00:52:24,265 --> 00:52:25,265
Okay, okay!

969
00:52:28,301 --> 00:52:29,303
Oh, my God.

- Katie!
- [panting]

Katie. Katie!

- [knocking]
- Katie.

Oh. [panting]

976
00:52:49,256 --> 00:52:51,156
Katie, will you please
just talk to me?

977
00:52:51,158 --> 00:52:52,158
[tires screeching]

978
00:52:53,828 --> 00:52:55,896
- Katie, please, just talk to me!
- [Jack] Hey!

979
00:52:55,898 --> 00:52:58,263
- Is she inside?
- Yes.

980
00:52:58,265 --> 00:52:59,733
Is she in there? Move!
Just move!

981
00:53:01,502 --> 00:53:03,669
- How could you let this happen to her?
- Let what happen?

982
00:53:03,671 --> 00:53:05,470
What happened?

983
00:53:05,472 --> 00:53:07,806
She not... tell you?

984
00:53:07,808 --> 00:53:11,410
- Tell me what? I have no idea what's going on!
- She's sick. She's sick.

985
00:53:11,412 --> 00:53:14,180
- What do you mean she's sick?
- She has XP.

986
00:53:14,182 --> 00:53:17,283
She can't go in the sun at all.
It can kill her. I'm sorry.

987
00:53:17,285 --> 00:53:19,754
- Katie?
- [door closes]

[sighs]
This is a nice hospital.

00:53:44,544 --> 00:53:46,548
I bet they have
really good food.

990
00:53:49,216 --> 00:53:50,651
Katie Price?

991
00:53:51,785 --> 00:53:52,922
We're ready.

992
00:54:10,571 --> 00:54:12,674
It was like a second, if that.

993
00:54:13,842 --> 00:54:15,707
Okay?
Everything's gonna be fine.

994
00:54:15,709 --> 00:54:16,944
We're good, Mr. P.

995
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:21,580
[footsteps approaching]

996
00:54:21,582 --> 00:54:23,348
Hey.

997
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:24,685
Is she okay?

998
00:54:43,403 --> 00:54:45,770
Okay, Katie, you can sit up. Nurse
Jane will take you back outside.

999
00:54:45,772 --> 00:54:48,877
Um, actually, I wanna stay.

1000
00:54:51,379 --> 00:54:55,346
Okay. The sunlight exposure
was minimal.

1001
00:54:55,348 --> 00:54:58,651
The physical effects you're
seeing right now will heal.

1002
00:54:58,653 --> 00:55:03,388
<i>But, as you know, XP generally lies
dormant until there's a triggering event.</i>

1003
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:05,290
We won't know if
that's what this was

1004
00:55:05,292 --> 00:55:07,812
until we get the results back from
your blood work and CT scans.

1005
00:55:09,363 --> 00:55:11,397
And if this was
a triggering event?

unexpected shaking, muscular
pain, loss of motor function,

1009
00:55:20,408 --> 00:55:22,374
you need to let us know
immediately.

1010
00:55:22,376 --> 00:55:24,913
Okay. I'm gonna go
get dressed now.

1011
00:55:27,381 --> 00:55:30,716
I'm pretty busy during the day,
but I could be free at night.

[Katie's voice overlapping]

<i>My dad's super protective.</i>

1015

What about UW?

1016
00:55:41,428 --> 00:55:43,495
<i>What about the study? Have
they started the second phase?</i>

1017
00:55:43,497 --> 00:55:46,033
I followed up with them
last week. No news yet.

1018
00:55:48,468 --> 00:55:50,504
Okay. Thanks.

1019
00:56:00,113 --> 00:56:02,050
All right, Charlie.
Let's get back to work.

1020

[beeps]

1022
00:56:20,533 --> 00:56:24,173
Look, I know I told you to play hard to get, but
you should at least see what he has to say.

1023
00:56:31,077 --> 00:56:33,848
- He's asking if he can come over and talk to you.
- Don't.

1024
00:56:35,515 --> 00:56:37,015
Please just delete them.

1025
00:56:37,017 --> 00:56:38,750
Katie.

1026
00:56:38,752 --> 00:56:42,154
Look, if I read them,
then I'm gonna reply,

1027
00:56:42,156 --> 00:56:46,424
then he's gonna reply
and then we're gonna meet up.

1028
00:56:46,426 --> 00:56:48,026
Which we can't.

1029
00:56:48,028 --> 00:56:49,829
Why can't you? I...

1030
00:56:49,831 --> 00:56:52,131
You don't have to be a martyr just
to protect Charlie's feelings.

1031
00:56:52,133 --> 00:56:54,098
He's a big boy.
I'm sure he can handle it.

1032
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,937
I can't handle it.
Okay?

1033
00:56:59,673 --> 00:57:02,741
He's gonna get hurt, and I'm not
gonna be the one who hurts him.

1034
00:57:02,743 --> 00:57:04,612
So, please, can you
just delete them?

1035
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:11,452
Yeah. Okay.

1036
00:57:36,443 --> 00:57:39,546
[gate opening, closing]

1037
00:57:56,696 --> 00:57:58,997
We should do
another set of tests.

1038
00:57:58,999 --> 00:58:01,200
The results could
come back different.

1039
00:58:01,202 --> 00:58:03,769
Her brain has begun to contract.

1040
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:06,037
- Once the neural pathways...
- What about the study?

1041
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:08,973
They shut it down, Jack.

1042
00:58:08,975 --> 00:58:12,079
I found out this morning.
There's no funding.

1043
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,026
No, I...

1044
00:58:28,028 --> 00:58:30,531
I did everything
I was supposed to do.

1045
00:58:34,702 --> 00:58:37,439
I mean, from the time
she was very young...

1046
00:58:38,907 --> 00:58:40,575
no matter how much she...

1047
00:58:42,176 --> 00:58:43,711
cried...

1048
00:58:44,745 --> 00:58:46,882
or screamed or moaned...

1049
00:58:47,915 --> 00:58:49,149
I wouldn't let her
go outside.

1050
00:58:55,155 --> 00:58:57,524
I wouldn't let her
go to the park.

1051
00:58:58,893 --> 00:59:02,160
I wouldn't even let her
go to the beach. [scoffs]

And she begged me.

She begged me...

1054
00:59:09,636 --> 00:59:11,937
for things that
she had every right to.

1055
00:59:11,939 --> 00:59:14,175
And I denied her
all of it.

1056
00:59:15,276 --> 00:59:17,942
I mean, for what? Huh?

1057
00:59:17,944 --> 00:59:20,582
For this? No.

1058

XP is a disease that tends to
take the joy from a child's life.

she's never complained,
she's never sulked.

She always sees
the good in things.

And the way
she talks about you?

I've never seen a teenager
so openly adore her father.

You're a good father, Jack.

looks better in.

- Um, "a partner in crime to travel the world with."
- I don't travel, honey.

Uh, you will though.

01:02:57,030 --> 01:03:00,298
We've always known it's
a matter of when and not if.

1094
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:05,205
So I really need you
to be selfish and...

1095
01:03:06,939 --> 01:03:10,375
go out there and, you know,
take those beautiful photos

1096
01:03:10,377 --> 01:03:12,310
and start traveling
the world again.

1097
01:03:12,312 --> 01:03:15,279
- I want everyone to see your photos, Dad.
- Just stop.

1098
01:03:15,281 --> 01:03:18,783
Okay, I can't...
I can't...

1099
01:03:18,785 --> 01:03:20,787
I just want you...

1100
01:03:22,488 --> 01:03:25,390
to promise me that you're
gonna take care of yourself.

1101
01:03:25,392 --> 01:03:29,129
I really want you to have as happy
a life as the one you've given me.

1102
01:03:30,263 --> 01:03:32,497
And try and find someone

1103
01:03:32,499 --> 01:03:36,234
that you can share these
incredible adventures with.

1104
01:03:36,236 --> 01:03:38,907
Because having someone...

1105
01:03:42,376 --> 01:03:44,178
that's the best part.

1106
01:03:45,578 --> 01:03:50,350
So please, just pick
a rando lady and take her out.

1107
01:03:55,088 --> 01:03:56,922
Okay.

1108
01:03:56,924 --> 01:03:58,291
Okay.

1109
01:03:59,526 --> 01:04:01,529
- Promise me.
- I promise.

1110
01:04:04,198 --> 01:04:05,767
[sniffles]

1111
01:04:07,234 --> 01:04:08,871
Good.

1112
01:04:12,305 --> 01:04:14,842
Now we can order Chinese food.

1113
01:04:16,911 --> 01:04:20,111
- [Jack] Come on!
- That was so a ball.

1114
01:04:20,113 --> 01:04:22,980
That's... That's not even baseball.
I don't know what that is.

1115
01:04:22,982 --> 01:04:24,118
[laughs]

1116
01:04:27,386 --> 01:04:32,026
- [doorbell rings]
- Oh, food. Finally. What took them so long?

1117
01:04:38,298 --> 01:04:41,900
Oh, my God.
Charlie's outside.

1118
01:04:41,902 --> 01:04:44,102
I know. I called him.

1119
01:04:44,104 --> 01:04:46,537
What? Why?

1120
01:04:46,539 --> 01:04:48,041
Because...

1121
01:04:50,176 --> 01:04:53,144
you said the best part was having
someone to share your adventures with.

1122
01:04:53,146 --> 01:04:57,884
So, go talk to him.
Tell him the truth.

1123
01:04:57,886 --> 01:05:00,417
He deserves that.

1124
01:05:00,419 --> 01:05:02,155
And so do you.

1125
01:05:09,997 --> 01:05:11,464
You exist.

1126
01:05:13,066 --> 01:05:15,002
This time I was positive
I dreamt you.

1127
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:20,171
Charlie, I'm so sorry.

1128
01:05:20,173 --> 01:05:23,140
Katie, this isn't something you
can just not tell me.

1129
01:05:23,142 --> 01:05:27,412
I'm so, so sorry
I didn't tell you.

1130
01:05:27,414 --> 01:05:28,616
That's...

1131
01:05:31,984 --> 01:05:36,390
unforgivable and
very selfish on my part.

1132
01:05:39,526 --> 01:05:41,963
We were never gonna work.

1133
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:44,999
But I wanted us to.

1134
01:05:46,533 --> 01:05:49,036
You, me, we...

1135
01:05:50,569 --> 01:05:53,039
we don't win in the end.

1136
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:56,241
So...

1137
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:57,645
So I'm saying good-bye,
Charlie.

1138
01:06:01,113 --> 01:06:02,382
Good-bye.

1139
01:06:10,057 --> 01:06:12,624
You know, that was the worst
break-up speech I've ever heard.

1140
01:06:12,626 --> 01:06:16,194
- What?
- Yeah. Like a D-minus would be generous.

1141
01:06:16,196 --> 01:06:18,595
Zeros from all the judges Katie.
It was a total flop.

1142
01:06:18,597 --> 01:06:21,499
I've never done this before!
What do you expect?

1143
01:06:21,501 --> 01:06:23,100
[chuckles]

1144
01:06:23,102 --> 01:06:26,506
Seriously, Charlie.
We can't.

1145
01:06:28,575 --> 01:06:30,176
We can.

1146
01:06:39,118 --> 01:06:40,687
What I can't do...

1147
01:06:42,055 --> 01:06:44,089
I can't stop being with you.

1148
01:06:44,091 --> 01:06:47,491
Katie, I've done
my research on XP.

1149
01:06:47,493 --> 01:06:50,261
I know what it is. I know
what you are going through.

1150
01:06:50,263 --> 01:06:53,131
But we're not the couple
who doesn't try.

1151
01:06:53,133 --> 01:06:55,368
You knew that before I did.

1152
01:07:01,274 --> 01:07:04,011
[inhales, exhales]

1153
01:07:07,214 --> 01:07:09,513
You've changed my life, Katie.

1154
01:07:09,515 --> 01:07:11,835
Okay, you can either just leave
me here on this porch or...

1155
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:16,189
or we can have the best summer
of our lives.

1156
01:07:18,591 --> 01:07:20,290
- [sniffles]
- What's it gonna be?

1157
01:07:20,292 --> 01:07:21,662

[shouting, cheering]

01:08:08,107 --> 01:08:09,510
[Mark] Go, Charlie! Push it!

1161
01:08:12,778 --> 01:08:14,247
Go, Charlie!

1162
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,789
That's it, Charlie! Come on!

1163
01:08:26,293 --> 01:08:29,227
- Charlie, let's go!
- Whoo! Whoo!

1164
01:08:29,229 --> 01:08:33,199
Go, Charlie!
Come on, Charlie! Go! Go!

1165
01:08:38,471 --> 01:08:40,337
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

1166
01:08:40,339 --> 01:08:42,808
- Yeah!
- [cheering continues]

1167
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:44,544
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

1168
01:08:46,579 --> 01:08:50,148
The Berkeley coach was impressed and
they promised to keep in touch.

1169
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:53,617
In touch is good. They'll be in touch.
I'm so proud of you, honey.

1170
01:08:53,619 --> 01:08:55,588
- Ahh.
- So good.

1171
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:00,859
Hey, I'll be right back.

1172
01:09:00,861 --> 01:09:02,229
Sure.

1173
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:06,663
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hi.

1174
01:09:06,665 --> 01:09:09,501
- The rumors are true. Congrats.
- Thank you.

1175
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:12,173
- You were great in there.
- Thank you for letting Katie come.

1176
01:09:13,205 --> 01:09:14,574
I couldn't
have stopped her.

1177
01:09:15,675 --> 01:09:17,774
Mr. Price,

1178
01:09:17,776 --> 01:09:19,496
would you mind if I took
Katie out tomorrow?

1179
01:09:22,748 --> 01:09:24,682
Yeah.

1180
01:09:24,684 --> 01:09:26,416
Yeah, I think
that'd be fine.

1181
01:09:26,418 --> 01:09:27,587
Thank you.

1182
01:10:06,893 --> 01:10:09,762
- Come on. Come on.
- I'm so confused. What are we...

1183
01:10:18,605 --> 01:10:20,938
- What is this?
- It's for you.

1184
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:23,241
- Is this Katie?
- Yeah.

1185
01:10:23,243 --> 01:10:25,742
Let's do this.

1186
01:10:25,744 --> 01:10:28,979
- No. Oh, my God, no.
- Katie. Katie, yes.

1187
01:10:28,981 --> 01:10:30,715
- No, I can't. I can't.
- Yes, yes, yes. Yes.

1188
01:10:30,717 --> 01:10:32,319
Yes.

1189
01:10:34,287 --> 01:10:37,788
This is so crazy. How... How
did you even pay for this?

1190
01:10:37,790 --> 01:10:40,724
- Don't worry about it.
- Charlie, your truck money?

1191
01:10:40,726 --> 01:10:42,860
- I can't let you...
- Katie, it's already done.

1192
01:10:42,862 --> 01:10:47,935
Okay, you helped me figure out my
dreams and now it's payback time.

1193
01:10:49,936 --> 01:10:52,002
I can't play anymore.

1194
01:10:52,004 --> 01:10:54,175
Then just sing.

1195
01:11:01,816 --> 01:11:03,881
- [switch clicks]

- [switch clicks]

1197

Thank you.

1198

How did you get this?

1199
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:15,727
- Uh, this is the song I've been working on.

[chattering, laughing]

1223

- [Katie] That one.
- [Jack] That one?

1224
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,027
That's Charlinium,

1225
01:12:56,029 --> 01:13:00,598
- because it is huge and powerful.
- [chuckles]

1226
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:04,102
And that one
is my favorite.

1227
01:13:04,104 --> 01:13:07,438
That one is Burritorium,

1228
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,543
because it's shaped
like a burrito.

1229

That one is Procyon.

1230

It's 11 light years away.

1231
01:13:16,449 --> 01:13:19,986
So we were seven
when that light was made.

1232
01:13:23,021 --> 01:13:27,660
That was, um, right around the time
you got your first skateboard.

1233
01:13:30,529 --> 01:13:31,529
What?

1234
01:13:34,967 --> 01:13:38,104
Charlie, that night we met
at the train station...

1235
01:13:39,772 --> 01:13:41,806
I already knew you.

1236

Wh-What do you mean?

1237
01:13:45,578 --> 01:13:48,612
In elementary school,

1238
01:13:48,614 --> 01:13:52,983
you walked by window every day
on your way to swim practice.

1239
01:13:52,985 --> 01:13:56,453
And in fourth grade,

1240
01:13:56,455 --> 01:13:58,723
you started skateboarding.

1241
01:13:58,725 --> 01:14:04,728
And in sixth grade, you wore a
Ken Griffey Jr. jersey every day

1242
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:07,133
for, like, a month straight.

1243
01:14:08,635 --> 01:14:11,935
And in ninth grade,

1244
01:14:11,937 --> 01:14:14,639
you buzzed off all your hair.

1245
01:14:14,641 --> 01:14:16,174
Uhh!

1246
01:14:16,176 --> 01:14:17,711
[chuckles] And...

1247
01:14:22,614 --> 01:14:24,484
every day...

1248
01:14:26,753 --> 01:14:29,623
I waited for you
