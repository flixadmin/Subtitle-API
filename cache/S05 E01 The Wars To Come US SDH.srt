- If your father--
- He'll never know
we're gone.

But if he finds out...

6
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,060
You don't need

Yes.

Listen to your friend.

16

They said that you
were terrifying

17

with cat's teeth
and three eyes.

18

Tell me mine.

their future.

This is my father's land.
My land.

26

Tell me my future
or I'll have your

Three questions you get.

33
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,057
You won't like
the answers.

34
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,231
I've been promised
to the prince.

35
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,066
When will we marry?

36
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,068
You will never
wed the prince.

37
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,903
You will wed the king.

38
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,613
But I will be queen?

39
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,907
Oh, yes.

40
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,493
You'll be queen.

41
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,954
For a time.

42
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,498
Then comes another,

43
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,791

46
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,633
W-will the king and I
have children?

47
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:45,846
No. The king
will have 20 children

48
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,222
and you will have three.

49
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,473
That doesn't make sense.

50
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:51,810
Gold will be their crowns.

51
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,855
Gold their shrouds.

They will keep waiting.

66
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,624
I want a moment
alone with him.

67
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:58,043
But, Your Grace,
many of these lords
and ladies have travelled

68
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,670
day and night
to be here from
all seven kingdoms.

69
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,422
They will wait.

<i>( door closes )</i>

00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,472
<i>( footsteps echoing )</i>

72
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,243
He never wanted you
to be a Kingsguard,

73
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:35,330
but here you are,
protecting his dead body.

74
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:42,379
What he built, it's ours.

75
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,298
He built it for us.
He meant it for us.

76
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,885
They're going to try
to take it away.

77
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,095
- All of it.
- They?

78
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,722
All of them out there,
our enemies.

79
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,559
They're waiting
in line to make sure
he's really dead.

80
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,394
And as soon as they see
the stones on his eyes,

81
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,271
they'll set to work
on tearing us apart.

82
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,982
They have nothing
to do with it.

83
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,401
The man who
murdered our father,
he tore us apart.

84
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,653
He's the enemy.
I've been telling
you for years.

85
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,238
You've been defending
him for years.

86
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,948
This is exactly
what they want.

87
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,700
And now our father
is dead

88
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:15,245
and that little monster
is out there somewhere
drawing breath.

89
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,541
Did you set him free?

90
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,670
Tyrion may be a monster,

91
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:27,757
but at least he killed
our father on purpose.

92
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,718
You killed him
by mistake.

93
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,971
With stupidity.

94
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,598
You're a man
of action, aren't you?

95
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,933
When it occurs to you
to do something, you do it.

96

Never mind
the consequences.

97
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,774
Take a look.

98
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,818
Look at the consequences.

99
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,864
Here they are.

100
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,954

I still don't see
why I had to stay

I feel overly guilty

about leaving you
in that fucking crate.

Pentos?

The home
of my colleague
Illyrio Mopatis,

124
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,343
a merchant.

125
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,303
He and I met
many years ago

126
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,430
through mutual friends.

127
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,974
A group of people
who saw Robert Baratheon

128
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:25,268
for the disaster he was.

129
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,604
We tried to do what
was best for the realm

130
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:31,191
by supporting
a Targaryen restoration.

131
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,693
And thus began
the chain of mistakes

132
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:36,321
that has led us
both here.

133
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,741
Things have
gotten worse,
not better.

134
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:43,161
Westeros needs to be
saved from itself.

135
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,833
Mmm.

I am anymore.

Are you a lord

I don't imagine
they revoke your nobility

142
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,319

143
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,154
It must happen
all the time.

You already drank yourself

In a box.
Why stop now?

146
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:26,162
Because we are talking
about the future
of our country.

147
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,919
The future is shit.

00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,370
Conquerors always meet
with resistance.

165
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,789
I didn't conquer them.
Their own people did.

166
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,875
( speaking Valyrian )

167
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,550
He did not risk his life
fighting for his freedom

168
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,177
so cowards in masks
could take it away.

169
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,721
And I did not take up
residence in this pyramid

170
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,683
so I could
watch the city below
decline into chaos.

171
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,186
What was the name
of the man you lost?

172
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,730
White Rat,
Your Grace.

173
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,942
I want him buried
with honor, publically

174
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,028
in the Temple
of the Graces.

175
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,489
The Sons of the Harpy
will hear that message.

176
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,074
Make them very angry.

177
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,034
Angry snakes lash out.

178
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,745
Makes chopping
off their heads
that much easier.

179
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,415
Find the men who did this
and bring them to me.

180
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,796
Your Grace.

181
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,019
Torgo Nudho.

182
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,979
Missandei hin Naath.

183
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:05,650
I wanted
to speak with you.

184
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,577
Why do you come?

185
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:19,706
White Rat,
the Unsullied who...

186
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:26,170
I have heard they found
his body in a brothel.

187
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:29,132
I have heard that
more than one Unsullied

188
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,009
has been known to visit
Meereen's brothels.

189
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,723
May I ask you why?

190
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,727
Why would an Unsullied
go to a brothel?

191
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,108
I do not know.

192
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,737
<i>I must go.</i>

193
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:01,873
( shouts, grunting )

194
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,546
- Get your shield up.
- It's too heavy.

195
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,214
If it wasn't heavy,
it wouldn't stop a sword.

196
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,758
Now get it up.

197
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,689
Come.
Try it again.

198
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,734
Drive at me.
Keep your shield up.

199
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,195
Or I'll ring
your head like a bell.

200
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,031
Shouldn't you
be training, too?

201
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:40,411
Well, I'm hardly
a new recruit.

202
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:44,373
How many brothers
can say that they've killed
a white walker and a Thenn?

203
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,501
I might be the first
in history.

204
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,711
- Man:<i> Shield up.</i>
- Alliser:<i> These men</i>
<i>need a firm hand.</i>

205
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,379
Always have.

206
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,591
They're poachers
and thieves.

207
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,178
Not soldiers.

208
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,145
That one hates me.

209
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,898
Sam: If Ser Alliser
is chosen as the new
Lord Commander...

210
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,401
- He hates the wildlings.
-<i> ( baby fussing )</i>

211
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,237
All the wildlings.

212
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,447
- Don't let them send us away.
-<i> It's not a sure thing.</i>

213
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:19,492
Ser Denys Mallister
has commanded the Shadow
Tower for 20 years

214
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,244
and people say
he's a good man.

215
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,620
He's running against
Ser Alliser--

216
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,289
Sam, don't let them
send us away.

217
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,208
I told you.

218
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,502
Wherever you go,
I go, too.

219
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,879
You can't leave.
They'll execute you.

220
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,640
- Good, good, pivot.
Don't forget to pivot.
- Yah!

221
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,601
Shield up.

222
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,063
The king wants a word.

223
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,070
( chains rattling )

224
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,788
( wind howling )

225
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:18,718
You're not cold,
my lady?

226
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,512
Never.

227
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:24,891
The Lord's fire lives
within me, Jon Snow.

228
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,437
Feel.

229
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,529
Are you a virgin?

230
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,076
No.

231
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,538
Good.

232
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,631
Your Grace.

233
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:58,925
The bastard
of Winterfell.

234
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,436
You know who rules
at Winterfell now?

235
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,230
Roose Bolton.

236
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:16,025
Mmm, the traitor
who plunged a dagger
in Robb Stark's heart.

237
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,237
Don't you want
to avenge him?

238
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:23,658
I want a great
many things, Your Grace.

239
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,077
But I'm a sworn brother
of the Night's Watch now.

240
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,372
I've been talking
to your sworn brothers.

241
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,332
- Many of them love you.
- They're good men.

242
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,042
<i>Many don't.</i>

243
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:37,296
You were seen taking
the body of a wildling
girl north of the Wall.

244
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,798
<i>Why?</i>

245
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,591
It's where she belonged.

246
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:42,259
Some of the Night's
Watch feel you have

247
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,220
too much affection
for the wildlings.

248
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,722
They were born
on the wrong side
of the Wall.

249
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,891
That doesn't
make them monsters.

250
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,017
No matter.

251
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:51,394
I shall take back
the North

252
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:52,895
from the thieves
who stole it.

253
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,439
Tywin Lannister is dead.
He can't protect them now.

254
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:59,110
I shall mount
Roose Bolton's head
on a spike.

255
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,404
But if
I'm to take Winterfell,
I need more men.

256
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,573
The men of the Night's Watch
are sworn to play no part--

257
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,701
I'm not talking about
the damn Night's Watch.

258
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,911
I'm talking about
the wildlings.

259
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:20,464
Your Grace,
you want the wildlings

260
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,425
to march in your army?

261
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,468
If they swear
to follow me,
I'll pardon them.

262
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,429
We'll take Winterfell.
Once the North is won,

263
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,180
I'll declare them
citizens of the realm.

264
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,433
I'll give them
land to live on.

265
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,769
It's a fair offer.
More than fair.

266
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,646
I'll offer them their lives
and their freedom

267
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,816
if Mance kneels before me
and swears his loyalty.

268
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,609
I don't think
that's likely.

269
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:44,030
You admire him,
don't you?

270
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,699
- I respect him.
- He likes you.

271
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,784
- Convince him
to bend the knee...
- Your Grace.

272
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,286
...or he burns.

273
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,666
How much time
do I have?

274
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,084
Nightfall.

275
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,628
The sun drops fast
this time of year.

276
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,173
<i>Hurry, Jon Snow.</i>

277
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,675
( boys grunting )

278
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,802
Master-of-arms:
<i>Shield up.</i>

279
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:09,388
- ( Robin whimpers )
- Master-of-arms:<i> Attack,</i>
<i>my lord!</i>

280
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:11,390
Attack!

281
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:13,976
- Don't cross your feet.
- ( grunts )

282
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,644
My sons had swords
in their hands

283
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,355
from the time
they could walk.
This one...

284
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,732
Littlefinger:
<i>Lord Arryn will never</i>
<i>be a great warrior.</i>

285
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,650
Royce:
<i>Great warrior?</i>

286
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,487
He swings a sword
like a girl with palsy.

287
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,114
My lord.

288
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,075
Master-of-arms:
<i>Sword up, my lord!</i>

289
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:32,328
<i>( Robin whimpering,</i>
<i>gasping )</i>

290
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,667
Some boys develop
more slowly.

291
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,836
He's still young.

292
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,839
He's 13.
Boys go to war at 13.

293
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,966
- He has other gifts.
- Does he?

294
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,761
The gift
of a great name.

295
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:52,640
Sometimes that's all
one needs.

296
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,392
( Robin whimpering )

297
00:23:57,728 --> 00:24:00,189
Good-bye, Lord Royce,
and thank you for all
you've done for me.

298
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,691
I have done nothing more
than my duty, my lady.

299
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,527
I have no doubt
that on my return,

300
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,904
Robin's skills will have
improved immeasurably.

301
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,115
He'll be safe here.

302
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:12,034
<i>As for his skills,</i>

303
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,537
I make no promises.

304
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,874
<i>( birds screeching )</i>

305
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:30,177
Will we head north
at some point?

306
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:33,722
He said
Sansa had a brother
at Castle Black.

307
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,392
We're a few days' ride
from the Kingsroad.

308
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,894
- But that will take us--
- Us?

309
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,982
The only reason you're here
is because Jaime Lannister

310
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,859
told me you weren't
safe in the capital.

311
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:49,780
You're hundreds of miles
from King's Landing.

312
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:51,824
No one knows
what you look like.

313
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,743
No one cares.
You're safe.

314
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,913
- But I'm your squire.
- Do you even know
what a squire is?

315
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,208
An attendant
to a knight.

316
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,918
I'm not a knight.

317
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,004
That means
you're not a squire.

318
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:06,380
Well, where would I go?

319
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:09,341
I don't care.
I'm not your mother.

320
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,685
You swore to find
the Stark girls.

321
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,605
I found Arya.
She didn't want
my protection.

322
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,608
-<i> Sansa still might.</i>
- Will you shut your mouth?

323
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:28,152
I didn't ask
for your advice.

324
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,615
I don't want anyone
following me.

325
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,408
I'm not a leader.

326
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,119
All I ever wanted
was to fight for a lord
I believed in.

327
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:40,664
The good lords are dead
and the rest are monsters.

328
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,836
-<i> ( horse whinnies )</i>
-<i> ( hoofbeats approaching )</i>

329
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,841
( horses neighing )

330
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:53,636
You told Lord Royce
we were going to the Fingers.

331
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,638
I did.

332
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,766
- But we're heading west.
- We are.

333
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,018
If he wanted to betray us,
he already would have.

334
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,981
Lord Royce
might be as honorable
as he thinks he is,

335
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,317
but he's not alone
in that castle.

336
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,402
Do you trust all those
knights and ladies,

337
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,488
<i>stable boys</i>
<i>and serving girls?</i>

338
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,908
No, do you trust
the carriage driver
or the knights escorting us?

339
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,160
No.
( chuckles )

340
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:19,828
But I pay them well

341
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,331
and they've seen what happens
to men who disappoint me.

342
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,583
So where are we going?

343
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,835
To a land where
you trust everyone?

344
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,546
To a land
so far from here,

345
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,716
even Cersei Lannister
can't get her hands on you.

346
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:43,811
It was such a deep,
deep shock to us all.

347
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,191
Your father was a--

348
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,527
a force to be
reckoned with.

349
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,529
He truly was.

350
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,698
I wouldn't
presume to claim

351
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,825
to have known him
as such, but--

352
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:01,412
<i>but just being</i>
<i>in his presence was enough</i>
<i>to make it so clear</i>

353
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:04,373
just how formidable
a person you were
dealing with.

354
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:08,085
What a-- what a force
to be reckoned with.

355
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,378
( sighs )

356
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,172
Thank you so much
for your kind words.

357
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,013
Deepest condolences,
Your Grace.

358
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:22,099
This tragedy...
I never trusted Varys.

359
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,476
I often warned...

360
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,231
Your Grace.

361
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,403
Cousin Lancel.
I hardly recognized you.

362
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,655
My deepest
sympathies.

363
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:39,867
I apologize
for my son's
appearance.

364
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,744
Uncle, it's quite
all right.

365
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,582
They call themselves
sparrows.

366
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,959
( chuckles )
Bloody fanatics.

367
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:51,086
Religion has its place,
of course,

368
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,630
but at a certain point...

369
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:56,800
They never would
have come to the capital
when Tywin was alive.

370
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:58,844
I'm sure he'll
grow out of it,

371
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,763
whatever it is.

372
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,307
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

373
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,994
Your wounds
from the Blackwater
seem to have healed.

374
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:27,831
It wasn't my wounds
that needed healing.

375
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,461
What can I do
for you?

376
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,381
You can forgive me.

377
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:38,133
What could you possibly
have done to warrant
my forgiveness?

378
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,844
I led you
into the darkness.

379
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:43,389
I doubt you've ever
led anyone anywhere.

380
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:46,308
I tempted you
into our...

381
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:49,978
unnatural relations.

382
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:53,732
And, of course,
there was the king...

383
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,152
his boar hunt.

384
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,989
His wine.

385
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,286
I don't know what
you're talking about.

386
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,039
I'm a different
person now.

387
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,419
I've found peace
in the light of the Seven.

388
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:14,920
<i>You can, too.</i>

389
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,630
<i>They watch over</i>
<i>all of us,</i>

390
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,258
ready to dole out mercy

391
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:20,717
or justice.

392
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,432
Their world
is at hand.

393
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,853
I will pray for
your father's soul.

394
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,147
( laughs )

395
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:37,025
The day Tywin Lannister's
soul needs your help...

396
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:48,203
- Olyvar: It looks like Dorne.
- Loras: It doesn't.

397
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:51,081
( laughs )
It does.

398
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:56,128
That's the--
that's the Sunspear
bit right there.

399
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:59,089
And that's where
the mountains are.

400
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:01,717
And over here is--

401
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,511
is Sunsnake?

402
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:05,846
Stonespear?

403
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,723
Sandstone.

404
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,224
Yes.

405
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:11,643
Yes, Sandstone.

406
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:12,978
( kisses )

407
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,396
Just there.

408
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,315
Fine.

409
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,694
It's Dorne.

410
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:23,906
We should go there.

411
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:27,326
I think we would
have a lovely time,

412
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,578
judging by
my experience.

413
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:33,749
That would be wonderful.
Dorne, Highgarden.

414
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,250
Anywhere but here.

415
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,303
We're late for dinner
as it is.

416
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:48,722
You're very respectful.

417
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,599
I'm very hungry.

418
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,868
What's your name?

419
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:11,662
Olyvar, my lady.

420
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:13,330
I'm afraid my brother

421
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:17,042
is keeping the king
waiting, Olyvar.

422
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,844
My lady.

423
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,903
Perhaps you might
consider being a bit
more discreet?

424
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:46,613
Why?

425
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:48,740
They all know
about me anyway.

426
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:51,702
Everybody
knows everything
about everyone.

427
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,037
What's the point
in trying to keep a secret
in a place like this?

428
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:57,874
In any event, you shouldn't
keep your intended waiting.

429
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,003
My intended?
Please.

430
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,671
<i>Tywin's dead.</i>

431
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,756
<i>That means no one</i>
<i>can force Cersei</i>
<i>to marry me.</i>

432
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,925
- Lucky you.
- Unlucky you.

433
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:08,802
You think I want
that woman married
to my brother?

434
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:12,639
If she doesn't marry me,
she doesn't go to Highgarden.

435
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:14,850
Which means she stays
in King's Landing.

436
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:19,021
<i>Which means you're trapped</i>
<i>here with Cersei Lannister</i>
<i>as your mother by law.</i>

437
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,772
Perhaps.

438
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,859
Perhaps?

439
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,528
Perhaps.

440
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:29,823
<i>( birds screeching )</i>

441
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:41,335
Eunuch,
the Spider,

442
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:43,086
the Master
of Whisperers.

443
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,589
Imp, Half-man.

444
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,010
There are faster ways
to kill yourself.

445
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,803
Not for a coward.

446
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:53,597
You are many things,
my friend,

447
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,932
but not a coward.

448
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:01,980
You never told me
why you set me free.

449
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:04,900
Your brother
asked me to.

450
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,652
Could have said no.

451
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:09,112
Refuse the Kingslayer?
A dangerous proposition.

452
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,406
Not as dangerous
as releasing me.

453
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,034
You risked your life,
your position, everything.

454
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,870
Why? You're not family.
You owe me nothing.

455
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,456
I didn't do it for you.

456
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,249
I did it for
the Seven Kingdoms.

457
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,878
A drunken dwarf
will never be the savior
of the Seven Kingdoms.

458
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,755
I don't believe
in saviors.

459
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:31,760
I believe men of talent
have a part to play
in the war to come.

460
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,554
You're going to have
to find another soldier.

461
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:37,933
I'm done with Westeros
and Westeros is done
with me.

462
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,103
You have many
admirable qualities,

463
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,646
self-pity is not
one of them.

464
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,773
Any fool
with a bit of luck

465
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:48,151
can find himself
born into power.

466
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:52,114
But earning it for yourself,
that takes work.

467
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,616
I'm not well-suited
for work.

468
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,034
I think you are.

469
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:58,453
You have your father's
instincts for politics.

470
00:33:58,537 --> 00:33:59,788
And you have compassion.

471
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,958
Compassion? Yes.

472
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,586
I killed my lover
with my bare hands.

473
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,548
I shot my own father
with a crossbow.

474
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,591
I never said
you were perfect.

475
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:15,679
What is it
you want exactly?

476
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,723
Peace.

477
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,433
Prosperity.

478
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:22,811
A land where the powerful
do not prey on the powerless.

479
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,147
Where the castles
are made of gingerbread

480
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,816
and the moats are filled
with blackberry wine.

481
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,235
The powerful have always
preyed on the powerless.

482
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,821
That's how
they became powerful
in the first place.

483
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,573
Perhaps.

484
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:38,076
And perhaps we've grown
so used to horror,

485
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,163
we assume
there's no other way.

486
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,373
<i>If you sat</i>
<i>on the Iron Throne,</i>

487
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:45,625
<i>would you spread misery</i>
<i>throughout the land?</i>

488
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:48,503
I will never sit
on the Iron Throne.

489
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,338
<i>No, you won't.</i>

490
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:53,008
<i>But you could help another</i>
<i>climb those steps</i>

491
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,343
and take that seat.

492
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:58,638
The Seven Kingdoms
need someone stronger
than Tommen,

493
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,682
but gentler
than Stannis.

494
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:04,436
A monarch who can
intimidate the high lords
and inspire the people.

495
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,773
A ruler loved by millions
with a powerful army

496
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,691
and the right family name.

497
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:11,902
Good luck finding him.

498
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:15,238
Who said anything
about "him"?

499
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:21,119
You have a choice,
my friend.

500
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:23,622
You can stay here
at Illyrio's palace

501
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,874
and drink yourself
to death,

502
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,043
or you can ride with me
to Meereen,

503
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,628
meet Daenerys Targaryen,

504
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:32,255
and decide if the world
is worth fighting for.

505
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:38,470
Can I drink myself to death
on the road to Meereen?

506
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:46,895
-<i> ( chatter )</i>
-<i> ( goat bleating )</i>

507
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:51,566
When did the Unsullied
start patrolling the streets
of Meereen?

508
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,861
Looks like
your friends haven't
been behaving themselves.

509
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,617
Our mission to Yunkai
was a resounding success.

510
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,203
The Wise Masters of Yunkai
have agreed to cede power

511
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,163
to a council of elders
made up of both

512
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:07,374
the freed men
and the former
slaveholders.

513
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:10,710
All matters
of consequence will be
brought to you for review.

514
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,420
Good.

515
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,256
They did ask
for some concessions.

516
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,508
Concessions?

517
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,844
Politics is the art
of compromise, Your Grace.

518
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,763
I'm not a politician.
I'm a queen.

519
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:24,766
Hizdahr:<i> Forgive me.</i>
<i>You're right, of course.</i>

520
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:28,770
Still, it's easier
to rule happy subjects
than angry ones.

521
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:31,523
I don't expect
the Wise Masters
to be happy.

522
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,734
Slavery made them rich.
I ended slavery.

523
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:37,571
They do not ask
for the return
of slavery.

524
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:41,575
They ask for the reopening
of the fighting pits.

525
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:43,076
The fighting pits?

526
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,495
Where slaves fought
slaves to the death?

527
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:47,581
In the new world
that you've brought to us,

528
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:50,083
free men would fight
free men.

529
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:52,836
<i>The pit fighters</i>
<i>you liberated</i>

530
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,880
<i>plead for</i>
<i>this opportunity.</i>

531
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:57,299
Bring some here
and ask them yourself.

532
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:58,633
No fighting pits.

533
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,510
Opening them would show
the people of Yunkai

534
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:02,596
and Meereen that you
respect their traditions.

535
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,640
I do not respect
the tradition of
human cockfighting.

536
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:09,436
- If you--
- How many times must I say no
before you understand?

537
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:14,107
Whatever he wants from me,
he's not going to get it.

538
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:16,568
If he really believes
I'm going to reopen
the fighting pits...

539
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,988
You should reopen
the fighting pits.

540
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,740
What?

541
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:24,534
My mother was a whore.
I told you that.

542
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,872
She liked to drink
pear brandy.

543
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:32,042
The older she got,
the less she made
selling her body,

544
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,461
the more she wanted
to drink.

545
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:37,756
So one day when I was 12,
she sold me to a slaver

546
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,675
she fucked
the night before.

547
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,719
I'm sorry.

548
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,513
Why?
I was a bad child.

549
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:49,267
I wasn't big,
but I was quick.

550
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:50,602
And I loved to fight.

551
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,604
So they sold me
to a man in Tolos

552
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,731
who trained fighters
for the pits.

553
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,525
I had my first match
when I was 16.

554
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,319
You were sold
into slavery,

555
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,863
forced to fight to the death
for the amusement
of the masters,

556
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,698
and you're defending
the fighting pits?

557
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,033
( laughs )

558
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,911
I'm only here
because of those pits.

559
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,455
I learned to fight
like a Dothraki screamer,

560
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,041
a Norvoshi priest,
a Westerosi knight.

561
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,626
Soon I was famous.

562
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,836
10,000 men and women
screamed my name

563
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,546
when I stepped
into the pit.

564
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,548
I made so much money
for my master,

565
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,176
he set me free
when he died.

566
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,095
I joined the Second Sons.

567
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,180
And then I met you.

568
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:34,604
You're the queen.

569
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:37,524
Everyone's too afraid
of you to speak truth.

570
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,859
Everyone but me.

571
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:44,197
You've made thousands
of enemies all across
the world.

572
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,992
As soon
as they see weakness,

573
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:49,077
they'll attack.

574
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,414
Show your strength
here, now.

575
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:55,083
That's why
I have the Unsullied
patrolling the streets.

576
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,918
( scoffs )

577
00:38:57,002 --> 00:39:00,630
Anyone with a chest
full of gold can buy
an army of Unsullied.

578
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:04,592
You're not
the Mother of Unsullied.

579
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,428
You're the Mother
of Dragons.

580
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:17,605
I don't want
another child's bones
dropped at my feet.

581
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:20,608
No one's seen
Drogon in weeks.

582
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:24,195
For all I know,
he's flown halfway
across the world.

583
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,786
I can't control
them anymore.

584
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:35,790
A dragon queen
with no dragons

585
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,876
is not a queen.

586
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,652
Viserion?

587
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,531
Rhaegal?

588
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,958
( snarling )

589
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:02,877
Easy. Easy.

590
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,338
Easy.

591
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,965
( roaring )

592
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:18,560
<i>( roaring continues )</i>

593
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:35,034
<i>( door opens )</i>

594
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,963
So here we are.

595
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,007
Here we are.

596
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:54,345
When we first met,
you were my prisoner.

597
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:57,807
And now,
for our last meeting...

598
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:02,395
This doesn't have to be
our last meeting.

599
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:05,023
No, but it will be.

600
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:09,569
You know
what Stannis wants?

601
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,905
He wants me
to bend the knee.

602
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:15,700
And he wants
the free folk
to fight for him.

603
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,535
I'll give him
this much,

604
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:18,953
he's bold.

605
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,914
Shouldn't a king
be bold?

606
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:22,749
<i>Oh, aye.</i>

607
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:25,668
I respect him.

608
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:27,295
If he gets what he wants,

609
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,589
I expect he'll be
a better ruler
than the fools

610
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,926
sitting on the Iron Throne
the last hundred years.

611
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:35,428
But I'll never serve him.

612
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:38,348
You told me you weren't
here to conquer.

613
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,849
You told me your people
have bled enough.

614
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:41,768
That's right.

615
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,312
I don't want
them bleeding for
Stannis Baratheon either.

616
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:48,107
You spent your life
convincing 90 clans
to come together

617
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,235
for the first time
in history.

618
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,278
Thenns and Hornfoots,

619
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:55,281
the ice-river clans,
even the giants.

620
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:59,452
A life's work uniting them.
You didn't do it for power.

621
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,871
You didn't do it
for glory.

622
00:43:01,955 --> 00:43:03,873
You brought them
together to save them

623
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:05,500
<i>because none of them</i>
<i>will survive the winter,</i>

624
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,335
<i>not if they're north</i>
<i>of the Wall.</i>

625
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,587
Isn't their survival
more important than
your pride?

626
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,464
Pride?

627
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,177
Fuck my pride.

628
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:21,683
This isn't about that.

629
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:25,645
Then bend the knee
and save your people.

630
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,525
They followed me
because they respected me.

631
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,360
Because they
believed in me.

632
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,029
The moment I kneel
for a southern king,
that's all gone.

633
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:38,157
And how many
tens of thousands
are out there right now?

634
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:41,411
How many women?
How many children?

635
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:44,747
And you won't
go out and rescue
them because why?

636
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:47,000
You're afraid
of looking afraid.

637
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:50,253
Oh, I am afraid.

638
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,797
No shame in that.

639
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:05,977
How will they do it?
Beheading?

640
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,729
Hanging?

641
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,067
They'll burn you alive.

642
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:19,699
Bad way to go.

643
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,455
I'll be honest with you.

644
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:27,582
I don't want to die.

645
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,208
And burnt to death,

646
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:31,586
I don't want people
to remember me like that,

647
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,297
scorched and screaming.

648
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,257
But it's better
than betraying

649
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:37,842
everything I believe.

650
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,219
And what happens
to your people?

651
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:43,973
You preserve your dignity
and die standing

652
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:46,559
and they'll sing
songs about you.

653
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,853
You'd rather burn
than kneel.

654
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:51,731
The great hero.

655
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:55,318
Until winter comes
and the white walkers
come for us all

656
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:58,112
and there's no one
left to sing.

657
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,950
You're a good lad.

658
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:05,620
Truly you are.

659
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:10,416
But if you can't
understand why I won't
enlist my people

660
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,960
in a foreigner's war,

661
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,797
there's no point
explaining.

662
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,931
<i>( pounds on door )</i>

663
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,689
I think you're making
a terrible mistake.

664
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:35,233
( chuckles )

665
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,735
The freedom to make
my own mistakes

666
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:39,779
was all I ever wanted.

667
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,333
<i>( door closes )</i>

668
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:53,793
<i>( latch clanks )</i>

669
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:52,852
Mance Rayder,
you've been called
the King-beyond-the-Wall.

670
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,730
Westeros
only has one king.

671
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,232
Bend the knee,
I promise you mercy.

672
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,915
Kneel and live.

673
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:25,092
This was my home
for many years.

674
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:29,180
I wish you good fortune

675
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,098
in the wars to come.

676
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:15,142
We all must choose.

677
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:19,689
Man or woman,
young or old,

678
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:22,984
lord or peasant,
our choices are the same.

679
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:26,654
We choose light
or we choose darkness.

680
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,740
<i>We choose good</i>
<i>or we choose evil.</i>

681
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:34,745
We choose the true god
or the false.

682
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,341
Free folk,

683
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:49,844
<i>there is only</i>
<i>one true king</i>

684
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,847
<i>and his name</i>
<i>is Stannis.</i>

685
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,182
Here stands
your king of lies.

686
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:58,603
Behold the fate of those
who choose the darkness.

687
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,824
( gasping )

688
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:16,138
<i>( Mance crying out )</i>

689
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:18,474
<i>( coughing )</i>

690
00:50:26,399 --> 00:50:29,610
<i>( Mance crying out )</i>

691
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:32,863
( groaning stops )

692
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:40,204
