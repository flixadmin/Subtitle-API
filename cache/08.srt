1
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:05,801
Oh, wow!

2
00:00:06,988 --> 00:00:08,988
You really did it this time, Barry.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,540
- Seriously?
- Yeah, yeah.

4
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:11,824
Yeah, seriously!

5
00:00:11,826 --> 00:00:13,960
You come to Star City, you ask for my help,

6
00:00:13,962 --> 00:00:15,211
and then, inevitably,

7
00:00:15,213 --> 00:00:16,613
immediately, we end up up the creek!

8
00:00:16,615 --> 00:00:18,498
Yeah, okay. That's fair.

9
00:00:20,335 --> 00:00:21,501
They're moving in.

10
00:00:21,503 --> 00:00:23,336
On three, Team Leader.

11
00:00:24,256 --> 00:00:25,255
What's that?

12
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:26,506
That would be heat vision.

13
00:00:26,508 --> 00:00:29,926
- Three.
- Okay.

15
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:47,410
Kid gets faster every time we test him.

16
00:00:47,412 --> 00:00:50,029
- Mach 2.
- Already?

17
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:51,698
He just got his speed a few days ago.

18
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,032
How are his vitals?

19
00:00:53,034 --> 00:00:55,201
His running economy, lactate threshold

20
00:00:55,203 --> 00:00:57,670
are all way above expected levels.

21
00:00:57,672 --> 00:00:59,922
I think we might have
a little prodigy on our hands.

22
00:00:59,924 --> 00:01:01,708
Like a Wizard of Whiz.

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,043
Guys, I don't want Wally
thinking that he's Barry,

24
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:05,928
rushing off half-cocked,

25
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,431
trying to take down Alchemy or Savitar

26
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:10,099
the next time one of them shows up.

27
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:12,101
Okay, but guys, Wally's not like me.

28
00:01:12,103 --> 00:01:13,886
He doesn't want his powers gone.

29
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:16,189
We're gonna have a hard time
convincing him not to use them.

30
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:18,891
Yeah, well, we have to. Until he's ready.

31
00:01:18,893 --> 00:01:20,443
How?

32
00:01:20,445 --> 00:01:22,695
By convincing him that he isn't.

33
00:01:22,697 --> 00:01:25,948
That means no encouraging him,
no training him,

34
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,067
and you...

35
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:30,236
no talking to him about a suit, please.

36
00:01:30,238 --> 00:01:32,572
It's for his own good.

37
00:01:34,242 --> 00:01:35,742
Why the hell not?

38
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,660
It's just another lie
between friends, right?

39
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:39,746
Cisco.

40
00:01:43,918 --> 00:01:45,084
What?

41
00:01:45,086 --> 00:01:47,220
Still not good?

42
00:01:47,222 --> 00:01:50,423
Um, I think maybe we should
try again tomorrow.

43
00:01:50,425 --> 00:01:52,809
I can run a few more tests.

44
00:01:53,978 --> 00:01:55,261
That was amazing.

45
00:01:55,263 --> 00:01:57,180
Dinner's on me. Whatever you want.

46
00:02:01,603 --> 00:02:04,020
Test. Test. Fellow S.T.A.R. Labs employees.

47
00:02:04,022 --> 00:02:07,990
Your presence in the cortex
would be greatly appreciated.

48
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:10,943
That's tonight? His presentation?

49
00:02:10,945 --> 00:02:13,279
Great.

50
00:02:13,281 --> 00:02:16,999
What do you think if,
after, maybe we get a drink?

51
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:18,451
You, me, Barry?

52
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:22,455
Barry? We're just gonna get drinks?

53
00:02:22,457 --> 00:02:23,840
Pretend like we're friends?

54
00:02:24,626 --> 00:02:25,842
Nice try.

55
00:02:25,844 --> 00:02:27,460
It ain't gonna happen.

56
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:32,348
You want to open S.T.A.R. Labs
to the public?

57
00:02:33,268 --> 00:02:34,267
In two weeks?

58
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:35,968
Soft open. Not a hard open.

59
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,387
But, you know, I'll use your input.

60
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:39,138
All right? Right now, it's very important

61
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,523
'cause the clock is ticking.

62
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:43,559
My vision is set to include,
but not limited to...

63
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:46,312
bam... a personal transportation tour

64
00:02:46,314 --> 00:02:47,563
of the facility.

65
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:49,565
Or, for the faint of heart, we have...

66
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:52,952
pow... a virtual reality alternative.

67
00:02:52,954 --> 00:02:56,372
Both set to include particle vision.

68
00:02:56,374 --> 00:02:58,624
Particle... vision?

69
00:02:58,626 --> 00:03:01,661
Particle vision, which is
a moment-to-moment reenactment

70
00:03:01,663 --> 00:03:04,247
of the particle accelerator explosion,

71
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:05,998
but seen from the point of view of...

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,167
- Part...
- The particle!

73
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:10,720
Listen, H.R., I know
that you're trying to figure out

74
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:13,556
how you add value to the team,
I get it, but this...

75
00:03:13,558 --> 00:03:15,341
Let me stop you right there, B.A.

76
00:03:15,343 --> 00:03:17,260
- Okay, don't call me B.A....
- I can make S.T.A.R. Labs

77
00:03:17,262 --> 00:03:18,728
the powerhouse in the scientific community

78
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,063
that it once was, and, moreover,

79
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:23,232
earn back the people's trust.

80
00:03:23,234 --> 00:03:24,600
Look at you guys.

81
00:03:24,602 --> 00:03:27,069
You just... your faces are so darn gloomy.

82
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:29,021
Here's what we'll do.
I'm gonna make you guys a...

83
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,692
Was that... was that the satellite?

84
00:03:32,694 --> 00:03:34,610
I hope that wasn't the satellite.

85
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:39,115
Is that a meteor?

86
00:03:39,117 --> 00:03:40,700
Why, yes, that is a meteor,

87
00:03:40,702 --> 00:03:43,336
and yes, it is heading for downtown.

88
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,707
I got to go.

89
00:04:05,443 --> 00:04:06,642
Guys.

90
00:04:06,644 --> 00:04:07,727
What is it?

91
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:08,895
Barry, what do you see?

92
00:04:08,897 --> 00:04:10,112
This isn't a meteor.

93
00:04:10,114 --> 00:04:11,981
Barry? Hey, Barry, come in.

94
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:13,950
- Can you hear me?
- Guys?

95
00:04:42,263 --> 00:04:45,765
Oh, come on.

96
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:47,433
Aliens!

97
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:53,709
Government officials are reporting

98
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,210
the mysterious object that crashed

99
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,879
in downtown Central City

100
00:04:56,881 --> 00:05:00,966
was simply a DOD aircraft
on a routine training operation.

101
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,286
Thank you, but we'll brief the White House.

102
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:06,071
You're not listening to me about this.

103
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:07,539
The intelligence we've gathered
at A.R.G.U.S....

104
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,907
Is not accurate.

105
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,742
We've got this covered, Director Michaels.

106
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:11,910
Go back to Star City.

107
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,079
Let the big guns take over.

108
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:19,918
Lyla, what is this?

109
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,253
I saw the weird ship that crashed...

110
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:23,138
You saw a ship? What else did you see?

111
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,807
Enough to give Ridley Scott nightmares.

112
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:34,933
Meet me at S.T.A.R. Labs.
I'll tell you everything I know.

113
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,355
Aliens?

114
00:05:40,357 --> 00:05:43,608
Are they "Alien" aliens or little green men?

115
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,993
Both, sort of.

116
00:05:44,995 --> 00:05:46,444
Since we learned of them,

117
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,163
we've been calling them the Dominators.

118
00:05:48,165 --> 00:05:49,247
That is not the name

119
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:50,782
of a species that comes in peace.

120
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:53,084
No, no, it's very aggressive.

121
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:56,421
So how long have you known
about these Dominators?

122
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,672
Since the '50s.

123
00:05:57,674 --> 00:05:59,291
That was them. Redmond, Oregon.

124
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:01,509
The government tried to cover it up.

125
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:04,129
What? I watch Syfy channel.

126
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:07,682
In 1951, they appeared under
the same sort of circumstances.

127
00:06:07,684 --> 00:06:10,935
A ship crash-landed.
Little to no communication.

128
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,187
We learned they were abducting humans

129
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:14,139
to gather intel about us.

130
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:16,775
They attacked, and hundreds
of soldiers lost their lives.

131
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:19,978
Then, for some
inexplicable reason, they left.

132
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,530
All contact had been lost
until three months ago

133
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:24,733
when the DOD received this.

134
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:30,822
We pose no threat, human inhabitants.

135
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:34,576
Understanding is our purpose.

136
00:06:34,578 --> 00:06:39,164
Any action against us,
as shown to us in the past,

137
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:43,301
will prompt swift retaliation.

138
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,970
So when we discovered four
ships heading towards Earth,

139
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:49,140
we were concerned that it was
happening all over again.

140
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,843
One of them, obviously, landed here.

141
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:54,846
Right, 'cause we ain't got
enough crazy going on here

142
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:55,847
in Central City.

143
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,349
Do you know what they want?

144
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:58,817
They've ignored all attempts to communicate,

145
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,402
but we do know, just like before,

146
00:07:00,404 --> 00:07:02,404
that the dropships contain
reconnaissance teams

147
00:07:02,406 --> 00:07:04,105
sent here to gather more intel about us.

148
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:05,774
Looking for our weaknesses.

149
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:08,493
- We need to do something.
- We are.

150
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,362
Nearly every member state
in the UN is in talks

151
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:11,696
to coordinate a response.

152
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,248
Action is being taken.

153
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,367
So, wait, you want us
to just sit this one out?

154
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:17,452
These things are like "World War Z" zombies.

155
00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:20,422
If they decide to attack,
no military can stop them.

156
00:07:20,424 --> 00:07:22,040
Neither could you.

157
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,708
Not by yourself, anyway.

158
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,878
Just let us handle this. For now.

159
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,889
So the plan isn't to just stay still

160
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:38,890
and do nothing, right?

161
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,058
No.

162
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,726
Barry, you heard Lyla.

163
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,228
You can't do this alone.

164
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,530
I don't plan to.

165
00:07:47,784 --> 00:07:49,234
Anything?

166
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:51,619
Zilch.

167
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:53,154
He's got to be here somewhere.

168
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:54,823
What are the chances the guy just decided

169
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:56,074
that he had enough of this life, you know?

170
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,375
No health insurance.

171
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,077
He was sick of the crazy hours.

172
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,746
I mean, bullets aren't actually
that cheap, and he...

173
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:27,021
- I'm sorry, man. I...
- It's okay.

174
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,111
Man...

175
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,079
Hey.

176
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,781
Hi, Barry.

177
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,199
So, who was that guy?

178
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:40,368
That was Vigilante, and we nearly had him.

179
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,253
You nearly had him, Ollie?

180
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,622
It looked like he was about
to "Scarface" you guys.

181
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,508
Barry, is there something
that I can do for you?

182
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,877
Another evil speedster
to help you with or...

183
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,962
Maybe, actually.
That's not why I'm here, though.

184
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,465
What's so urgent that
you had to rush to Star City?

185
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:54,799
Aliens.

186
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:55,850
Aliens?

187
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:57,635
Aliens.

188
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:58,970
I swear to God, Barry.

189
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,688
My life was somewhat normal
before I met you.

190
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,524
I... I mean, I'm sorry.

191
00:09:02,526 --> 00:09:04,809
Look, okay, they're real,
and they're already here,

192
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:05,944
and, from what Lyla told us,

193
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:07,395
it does not appear to be for peace.

194
00:09:07,397 --> 00:09:09,314
- Oh, no.
- Lyla knows about this?

195
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:10,982
Lyla... yeah, she came to...

196
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,150
where are you...

197
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,569
I called Thea.

198
00:09:14,571 --> 00:09:16,788
Yeah, I came to have you sign this

199
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,373
before City Council went in to mutiny,

200
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,492
but that can totally wait.

201
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:21,910
Count me in.

202
00:09:21,912 --> 00:09:23,878
For what? I thought you retired.

203
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,799
Yeah, but it's... it's aliens.

204
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,050
Aw, that is so cute.

205
00:09:29,052 --> 00:09:30,635
You guys are just gonna get together

206
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,670
and go fight some aliens...
have you lost your mind?

207
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:36,057
They're aliens,
and there's only four of you.

208
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:39,394
Not if we get Stein
and, you know, all the others.

209
00:09:39,396 --> 00:09:40,929
They're calling themselves the Legends.

210
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:42,397
Egotistical but catchy.

211
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,649
Do you know where they are?

212
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,401
I know where they were.

213
00:09:48,238 --> 00:09:50,154
What is this place?

214
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,525
It's this old hall hangar
thing that S.T.A.R. Labs owns.

215
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:55,443
Or I guess I own it.

216
00:09:55,445 --> 00:09:57,028
Well, you should do something with it.

217
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,580
All right, so let me get this right.

218
00:09:58,582 --> 00:10:01,282
Our time-traveling buddies
in a flying timeship

219
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:04,035
are supposed to just pop up
right here, right?

220
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,004
Yeah. This is the time
and place I gave them,

221
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,789
so if they got my message,
they should be here...

222
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:11,759
Right now.

223
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,799
You know why I've never done drugs?

224
00:10:17,801 --> 00:10:20,351
It's 'cause I was always afraid
I'd see weird stuff.

225
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,720
Okay, take everybody inside, all right?

226
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,723
- Tell Oliver I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

227
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,225
Well, since we're fighting aliens,

228
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,776
I figured we should get
one of our own, right?

229
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:31,563
You found the right Earth?

230
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:34,148
Tachyon device tracked you
on Earth-38 when you met her,

231
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,567
so you should find her there. All right.

232
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:36,734
Just so you know, I'm only doing this

233
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,403
because we're on a mission.

234
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,822
I'm not gonna let my issues
with you get in the way of that.

235
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:45,827
This might take a few tries.

236
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:58,890
This better be the right place.

237
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:01,259
'Cause if this isn't the right place,

238
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:04,095
someone's about to be real confused.

239
00:11:07,017 --> 00:11:07,982
Barry?

240
00:11:07,984 --> 00:11:09,067
Hey.

241
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:10,151
I knew it!

242
00:11:10,153 --> 00:11:11,736
I knew that was you.

243
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:13,938
I knew it was you in that weird space...

244
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,274
Sorry, it took a couple tries to get here.

245
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:17,859
This is my friend, Cisco.

246
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:19,827
Well, friend is a loose term.
We work together.

247
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:20,778
Hi. Cisco.

248
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,113
I have to say it...

249
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,499
this is a nice universe you got here.

250
00:11:24,501 --> 00:11:25,750
Thank you.

251
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:27,335
Okay, do you remember last year

252
00:11:27,337 --> 00:11:28,620
when I helped you out

253
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:30,421
and you promised to do the same for me?

254
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,289
What are we up against?

255
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:35,627
Team Arrow is here.

256
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:37,512
Team Legends is here.

257
00:11:37,514 --> 00:11:40,131
- Is that everyone?
- I think so?

258
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:43,184
Nate and Amaya are back
watching the Waverider.

259
00:11:43,186 --> 00:11:44,969
The newbies.

260
00:11:47,023 --> 00:11:48,473
That was cool.

261
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,141
Guys.

262
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,476
Thanks for coming.

263
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:53,811
Barry, I thought you were bringing an alien.

264
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,730
And, yeah, we did.

265
00:11:55,732 --> 00:11:58,983
Everybody, this is my friend, Kara Danvers,

266
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:02,036
or, as she's known on her Earth, Supergirl.

267
00:12:02,038 --> 00:12:03,071
What makes her so super?

268
00:12:03,073 --> 00:12:04,238
Well?

269
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:10,461
I'm convinced.

270
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:13,414
Best. Team-up. Ever!

271
00:12:24,924 --> 00:12:27,028
_

272
00:12:27,936 --> 00:12:31,468
_

273
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,092
Okay. I think I have this.

274
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:41,343
Oliver. Green Arrow.

275
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:43,012
- Dig.
- Spartan.

276
00:12:43,014 --> 00:12:44,597
- Thea.
- Speedy.

277
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:45,765
Okay.

278
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:48,100
- And Sara.
- White Canary.

279
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:51,604
- Jax and Professor Stein.
- Firestorm.

280
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,273
- Ray.
- Palmer. The Atom.

281
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:57,109
- And Mick.
- Hmm?

282
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:59,495
Oh. Heat Wave.

283
00:12:59,497 --> 00:13:02,948
And Iris, Caitlin, and Felicity.

284
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,583
- Whoo!
- Yes!

285
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:08,087
And you have cold powers,
but you can't use them?

286
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:10,539
- You have powers?
- It's a long story.

287
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,459
Barry, so, Oliver Queen is the Green Arrow?

288
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:14,927
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

289
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:16,462
- He just got so much hotter.
- Oh, my God.

290
00:13:16,464 --> 00:13:19,031
Okay, Cisco, we should probably get started.

291
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:21,700
Okay.

292
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:24,553
These are the Dominators.
We don't know much about them.

293
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:26,972
Except they're really strong.

294
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:30,276
I heard a lot of stories
about them when I was a kid.

295
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:32,311
They came to my planet before I was born.

296
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:34,947
They did experiments on a lot of people.

297
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:36,148
Killed a lot more.

298
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,399
Well, they're not the only ones

299
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:39,201
with superhuman strength, I hear.

300
00:13:39,203 --> 00:13:42,488
Barry says that you're more
powerful than a locomotive.

301
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,907
We should use Kara
as a stand-in for training.

302
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,909
Since when is Robin Hood calling the shots?

303
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:49,411
What I think Mick is trying to say

304
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:52,832
is it would be nice if we knew
who was in charge around here.

305
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:54,300
Maybe we should take a vote.

306
00:13:54,302 --> 00:13:56,085
Choose a leader. Someone we can all trust.

307
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:59,388
Well, I trust Oliver. He's got my vote.

308
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,841
Appreciate that, Cisco,
but Barry put us all together.

309
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:03,843
It should be him.

310
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,562
Fair enough.

311
00:14:06,564 --> 00:14:08,180
Okay.

312
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:11,350
Cool, all right, well,
I guess as Team Leader,

313
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:15,988
first thing to do is start out by...

314
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,023
- Doing a test run.
- Let's do a test run.

315
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,442
Yeah, let's do a test run.

316
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,578
- Against Supergirl.
- Against Supergirl, all right?

317
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,663
Test run against Supergirl.

318
00:14:23,702 --> 00:14:24,734
Are we just supposed to pretend

319
00:14:24,736 --> 00:14:25,985
like we don't hear him?

320
00:14:25,987 --> 00:14:27,954
So just suit up. Mm-kay? Look alive.

321
00:14:27,956 --> 00:14:31,658
We're training to fight aliens
by fighting an alien, so...

322
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,709
- Do it.
- Suit up.

323
00:14:32,711 --> 00:14:34,210
- Stop.
- What?

324
00:14:34,212 --> 00:14:36,996
Oliver. Hey. Kara. Really quick.

325
00:14:36,998 --> 00:14:39,215
I was excited about the two
of you guys meeting each other.

326
00:14:39,217 --> 00:14:41,551
Oliver was the first person to train me.

327
00:14:41,553 --> 00:14:42,886
- Really?
- Yeah.

328
00:14:42,888 --> 00:14:44,387
Well, you did a really good job.

329
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:45,922
It's 'cause I didn't hold back.

330
00:14:45,924 --> 00:14:48,842
I shot him. You can't hold back either.

331
00:14:48,844 --> 00:14:51,394
- He did shoot me.
- Ouch.

332
00:14:51,396 --> 00:14:55,482
Okay. Are you sure about that?

333
00:14:55,484 --> 00:14:56,599
I just met these people...

334
00:14:56,601 --> 00:14:57,817
These people need to understand

335
00:14:57,819 --> 00:14:59,352
this isn't gonna be easy.

336
00:14:59,354 --> 00:15:02,772
Don't hold back. Especially against me.

337
00:15:02,774 --> 00:15:03,990
Yes, sir.

338
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:05,775
Wow.

339
00:15:05,777 --> 00:15:07,777
Does he not like me?

340
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:12,532
He's like that with everyone.
He'll warm up to you.

341
00:15:14,286 --> 00:15:15,785
Old West Dwarf Star plus Replicator,

342
00:15:15,787 --> 00:15:17,787
equals new suit. You know what, Ray?

343
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:21,341
Maybe it's just me, but I think
this thing's due for an update.

344
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,176
Ha. Yes.

345
00:15:23,178 --> 00:15:25,962
But after we dominate the Dominators.

346
00:15:25,964 --> 00:15:28,465
Oh! I see what you did there.

347
00:15:30,469 --> 00:15:32,018
Hey.

348
00:15:33,438 --> 00:15:34,721
Listen. I got to get to work.

349
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:35,855
Felicity's waiting for me.

350
00:15:35,857 --> 00:15:38,525
But we'll talk about this later.

351
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:39,976
Hey, Barry.

352
00:15:40,812 --> 00:15:42,145
Where's Snart?

353
00:15:43,648 --> 00:15:48,151
Man, I'm sorry, Barry.
I forgot that we never told you.

354
00:15:48,153 --> 00:15:49,986
What happened?

355
00:15:49,988 --> 00:15:53,039
He sacrificed himself. Saved us all.

356
00:15:53,992 --> 00:15:57,410
- He died a hero.
- A Legend.

357
00:16:00,048 --> 00:16:01,915
Wally, what are you doing here?

358
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:03,299
You can't just show up and think

359
00:16:03,301 --> 00:16:04,667
you're gonna train with everyone else.

360
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:05,835
Why not?

361
00:16:05,837 --> 00:16:07,170
Because we need to test you more.

362
00:16:07,172 --> 00:16:08,471
H.R. said that my results were great.

363
00:16:08,473 --> 00:16:10,056
He said I'm good to go.

364
00:16:10,058 --> 00:16:12,509
I don't care what H.R. said.
You are not ready.

365
00:16:12,511 --> 00:16:13,893
- I am ready.
- Wally.

366
00:16:13,895 --> 00:16:15,512
Everyone here has been doing this

367
00:16:15,514 --> 00:16:17,096
for a long time, and this is gonna be

368
00:16:17,098 --> 00:16:19,232
the hardest challenge they have faced.

369
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:21,851
Fighting Alchemy or Savitar or aliens

370
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:24,521
isn't something you just show up and try.

371
00:16:24,523 --> 00:16:27,023
If you screw up, you could die.

372
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:29,909
Do you... do you get that?

373
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:32,946
Great.

374
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:34,948
Satellite's not picking up
anything abnormal.

375
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,866
No.

376
00:16:36,868 --> 00:16:39,169
I don't know if we're gonna
find any Dominators this way.

377
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:41,621
Hey, I... just, I couldn't help but notice

378
00:16:41,623 --> 00:16:44,207
things are a little bit tense.

379
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:47,293
You don't need to be able
to Vibe to figure that out.

380
00:16:47,295 --> 00:16:49,846
Okay, so apparently, it's, like, illegal

381
00:16:49,848 --> 00:16:51,631
to be mad at Barry, but guess what.

382
00:16:51,633 --> 00:16:54,467
He screws up, just like the rest of us.

383
00:16:54,469 --> 00:16:55,969
Yeah, and when he does, he feels bad

384
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:57,220
like the rest of us too.

385
00:16:57,222 --> 00:16:58,388
Felicity, he took it upon himself

386
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,139
to change the timeline.

387
00:17:00,141 --> 00:17:05,228
And because of it, my brother was killed.

388
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,114
So there's no amount of feeling bad

389
00:17:08,116 --> 00:17:10,316
that could ever make up for that.

390
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:15,705
Barry.

391
00:17:15,707 --> 00:17:17,040
Before we start training,

392
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:18,157
there's something you need to hear.

393
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:19,459
A message that would be better

394
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:21,377
if we could share with you in private.

395
00:17:21,379 --> 00:17:23,246
- All right, I'll step away.
- No, no, it's fine.

396
00:17:23,248 --> 00:17:24,414
You can stay.

397
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,966
All right, but no one else.

398
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:28,334
All right.

399
00:17:31,756 --> 00:17:33,840
Let's make it quick.

400
00:17:35,727 --> 00:17:37,760
A war is coming, Captain Hunter,

401
00:17:37,762 --> 00:17:39,762
and at some point
you're gonna be called back

402
00:17:39,764 --> 00:17:41,514
to Central City to fight it.

403
00:17:41,516 --> 00:17:43,483
So you need to know that,
while you and your team

404
00:17:43,485 --> 00:17:44,934
have been in the temporal zone,

405
00:17:44,936 --> 00:17:46,686
I made a choice that affected the timeline.

406
00:17:46,688 --> 00:17:48,988
As you know, whenever you alter the past,

407
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,823
those changes affect the present

408
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:52,742
and get compounded in the future.

409
00:17:52,744 --> 00:17:55,612
When you return, you will be
in the new timeline I created,

410
00:17:55,614 --> 00:17:57,614
where everyone's past and everyone's future

411
00:17:57,616 --> 00:18:00,283
has been affected, including yours.

412
00:18:00,285 --> 00:18:02,952
When you come back,
don't trust anything or anyone.

413
00:18:02,954 --> 00:18:04,837
Not even me.

414
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:07,090
Where did you get that from?

415
00:18:07,092 --> 00:18:10,710
We found it in a secret room
inside the Waverider.

416
00:18:10,712 --> 00:18:13,429
It was sent by you, 40 years from now.

417
00:18:13,431 --> 00:18:15,381
40 years from now?

418
00:18:15,383 --> 00:18:19,135
Barry, what the hell does this mean?

419
00:18:19,137 --> 00:18:22,305
It means I screwed things up
when I changed the past.

420
00:18:22,307 --> 00:18:23,356
What did you do?

421
00:18:23,358 --> 00:18:25,525
I went back in time,

422
00:18:25,527 --> 00:18:27,977
and I saved my mom.

423
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:30,363
I created a timeline where she's alive.

424
00:18:30,365 --> 00:18:31,648
It's called Flashpoint.

425
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,983
I lived in it for a few months,

426
00:18:33,985 --> 00:18:36,119
until I realized that I made a big mistake,

427
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:37,654
and I tried to reset the timeline,

428
00:18:37,656 --> 00:18:39,489
put things back
to how they were supposed to be,

429
00:18:39,491 --> 00:18:40,490
but...

430
00:18:40,492 --> 00:18:42,292
But it didn't work.

431
00:18:42,294 --> 00:18:44,043
- No.
- Wow.

432
00:18:44,045 --> 00:18:46,329
Barry, that's...

433
00:18:46,331 --> 00:18:48,331
So what's changed since you did this?

434
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,467
Cisco's brother is dead. Caitlin has powers.

435
00:18:51,469 --> 00:18:54,170
Diggle has a son now instead of a daughter.

436
00:18:54,172 --> 00:18:57,507
What? John had a daughter?

437
00:18:57,509 --> 00:18:58,975
I didn't just screw up my life, man.

438
00:18:58,977 --> 00:19:00,476
I screwed up everybody's lives

439
00:19:00,478 --> 00:19:02,679
and, apparently,
everybody's lives in the future.

440
00:19:02,681 --> 00:19:04,564
It felt like, when these aliens got here,

441
00:19:04,566 --> 00:19:06,399
that finally something
had happened I didn't cause,

442
00:19:06,401 --> 00:19:07,934
and maybe I could make up

443
00:19:07,936 --> 00:19:10,153
for everything I'd done
to everybody, but I...

444
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:12,322
I think we should be
on the up and up with everybody.

445
00:19:12,324 --> 00:19:13,823
We got to tell 'em.

446
00:19:13,825 --> 00:19:16,025
We're going up against a bunch of aliens,

447
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:17,577
and you want to tell people

448
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:19,362
that their lives might have been
affected by time travel?

449
00:19:19,364 --> 00:19:22,532
One sci-fi problem at a time.

450
00:19:22,534 --> 00:19:24,033
You made a mistake, Barry.

451
00:19:24,035 --> 00:19:25,868
It's part of the job.

452
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:29,205
But we can't deal with it today.

453
00:19:52,647 --> 00:19:54,897
Professor Stein, are you okay?

454
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:57,900
I'm not sure.

455
00:19:59,237 --> 00:20:03,406
Ms. Snow, would you mind
accompanying me to my home?

456
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:05,491
There's something I need to do.

457
00:20:05,493 --> 00:20:07,994
Sure.

458
00:20:16,805 --> 00:20:19,255
She really is a badass.

459
00:20:20,425 --> 00:20:22,258
Yeah, it's kind of hot.

460
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,593
Let's go again.

461
00:20:34,522 --> 00:20:37,940
So this is, what, your way
of advising me to do nothing?

462
00:20:37,942 --> 00:20:39,575
The Dominators have yet to engage

463
00:20:39,577 --> 00:20:42,328
in an act of aggression, sir.

464
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,830
What does A.R.G.U.S. think?

465
00:20:43,832 --> 00:20:46,115
I think us being passive
is exactly what they want,

466
00:20:46,117 --> 00:20:47,333
Mr. President.

467
00:20:47,335 --> 00:20:49,285
Well, finally, someone here with balls.

468
00:20:49,287 --> 00:20:52,205
Ike ignored all the signs and
waited until it was too late.

469
00:20:52,207 --> 00:20:54,207
I'm not gonna make that same mistake.

470
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:55,291
You saw what happened

471
00:20:55,293 --> 00:20:57,126
the last time we engaged them.

472
00:20:57,128 --> 00:21:00,096
That's a lot of casualties
to be remembered for.

473
00:21:00,098 --> 00:21:02,432
Four dropships landed on this planet,

474
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:04,350
all of them sent to gather intel.

475
00:21:04,352 --> 00:21:07,136
If we do nothing and they attack,

476
00:21:07,138 --> 00:21:09,439
that's what I'll remembered for.

477
00:21:09,441 --> 00:21:10,807
Proceed as instructed.

478
00:21:22,036 --> 00:21:24,537
You know, Director Michaels,

479
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:27,740
the reason that Amanda Waller
lasted as long as she did

480
00:21:27,742 --> 00:21:30,159
is because she learned
how to follow my lead.

481
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:32,795
I suggest that you acquire that trait.

482
00:21:32,797 --> 00:21:33,963
Soon.

483
00:21:50,315 --> 00:21:52,348
He's gone.

484
00:21:58,857 --> 00:22:00,156
Traveller has been taken.

485
00:22:00,158 --> 00:22:02,742
I repeat, Traveller has been taken.

486
00:22:02,744 --> 00:22:05,194
The Dominators have the President.

487
00:22:17,906 --> 00:22:21,607
- Hey, son.
- I don't understand, Dad.

488
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:23,493
No one in this family
wants me to have powers.

489
00:22:23,495 --> 00:22:24,827
You don't. Barry doesn't.

490
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:26,279
Even Iris.

491
00:22:26,281 --> 00:22:28,081
According to this,
everything's fine with me.

492
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,283
In fact, everything is better than fine.

493
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,954
What, did you run back
to make sure I didn't see these?

494
00:22:34,956 --> 00:22:37,590
I'm faster than you now, remember?

495
00:22:37,592 --> 00:22:39,625
Whether you or Barry or anyone
likes it or not.

496
00:22:39,627 --> 00:22:40,793
Wally, look.

497
00:22:40,795 --> 00:22:41,961
I know you're upset with me.

498
00:22:41,963 --> 00:22:43,963
I was just trying to protect you.

499
00:22:43,965 --> 00:22:46,099
Come on. I know you don't want me training.

500
00:22:46,101 --> 00:22:47,850
I just don't get why.

501
00:22:47,852 --> 00:22:50,636
Because I'm better than Barry
was when he first got his speed.

502
00:22:50,638 --> 00:22:52,188
You know, in Flashpoint,

503
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:55,475
you and I were a brother-sister
crime-fighting unit.

504
00:22:55,477 --> 00:22:58,061
So it sucks you don't have
the same faith in me here

505
00:22:58,063 --> 00:23:00,696
as you did there.

506
00:23:02,317 --> 00:23:05,818
Brother and sister crime-fighting unit?

507
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,155
Hi, there, Wallace.

508
00:23:09,157 --> 00:23:12,625
I came back to get some lip balm.

509
00:23:12,627 --> 00:23:14,077
It's okay. You seem to be the only one

510
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,628
that'll tell me the truth around here.

511
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,080
Me?

512
00:23:17,082 --> 00:23:18,331
We're kind of treated the same way, right?

513
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,249
No one shows us any respect.

514
00:23:20,251 --> 00:23:24,053
Respect, I'm just trying
to earn that, Wallace.

515
00:23:24,055 --> 00:23:25,805
Maybe we should stop listening to them.

516
00:23:25,807 --> 00:23:27,974
Yeah, what? What does that mean?

517
00:23:27,976 --> 00:23:30,393
It means I want you to train me.

518
00:23:30,395 --> 00:23:32,228
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

519
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,348
I would be gone faster than
humor in a Liam Neeson movie.

520
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,315
Do you know what I mean?

521
00:23:36,317 --> 00:23:37,767
- No.
- Yeah.

522
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:40,319
- Not if they don't find out.
- Wallace.

523
00:23:40,321 --> 00:23:42,905
Come on. No one's gonna do this for me.

524
00:23:42,907 --> 00:23:44,857
I want to make a difference, H.R.

525
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:46,242
I'm never gonna be able to

526
00:23:46,244 --> 00:23:48,661
if I don't know how to use my powers.

527
00:23:48,663 --> 00:23:52,532
Please. I want to help people,
same as you do.

528
00:23:52,534 --> 00:23:54,117
So show me how.

529
00:23:57,422 --> 00:23:59,205
Nah.

530
00:24:01,843 --> 00:24:03,509
Thank you for joining me, my dear.

531
00:24:03,511 --> 00:24:06,796
Of course. I wasn't being
much help back there anyway.

532
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:09,849
You know, having powers
isn't exactly a death sentence,

533
00:24:09,851 --> 00:24:11,884
no matter who your doppelganger is.

534
00:24:11,886 --> 00:24:15,104
I attacked my friends... my best friends...

535
00:24:15,106 --> 00:24:17,223
and said horrible, horrible things to them.

536
00:24:17,225 --> 00:24:18,941
But that wasn't you.

537
00:24:18,943 --> 00:24:23,446
And believe me, as a person
who sometimes shares a body

538
00:24:23,448 --> 00:24:25,448
with another human being,
I know the difference,

539
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,150
and so do your friends.

540
00:24:27,152 --> 00:24:28,701
I'm just so scared.

541
00:24:28,703 --> 00:24:31,821
What if she comes back
and I can't keep her out?

542
00:24:31,823 --> 00:24:33,322
Then what?

543
00:24:35,076 --> 00:24:37,793
We'll all be there for you.

544
00:24:49,007 --> 00:24:50,339
Are you okay?

545
00:24:51,643 --> 00:24:52,925
You're back!

546
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:59,899
I'm sorry. I was looking for my wife.

547
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:01,601
Very funny. She's not here.

548
00:25:01,603 --> 00:25:04,604
Oh, it's so good to see you.
I missed you so much.

549
00:25:04,606 --> 00:25:05,738
Did you?

550
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,524
Of course. I love you, Dad.

551
00:25:11,863 --> 00:25:13,946
I love you too.

552
00:25:13,948 --> 00:25:17,200
But I'm sorry. We have to go.

553
00:25:17,202 --> 00:25:18,451
Please... Oh.

554
00:25:18,453 --> 00:25:20,086
Tell your mother I'll see her soon.

555
00:25:20,088 --> 00:25:22,455
- Professor Stein?
- We have to leave now.

556
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,383
Where are you?

557
00:25:48,816 --> 00:25:51,400
A war is coming, Captain Hunter...

558
00:25:51,402 --> 00:25:53,319
Are you sure you want me to keep going?

559
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:54,820
Yeah. Yes.

560
00:25:54,822 --> 00:25:56,706
Just give us five minutes.

561
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:58,040
Please.

562
00:25:58,042 --> 00:25:59,825
- Hey.
- Hey.

563
00:25:59,827 --> 00:26:01,827
You know what this is?

564
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:04,547
This is really you.

565
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:06,382
Like, future you.

566
00:26:06,384 --> 00:26:08,000
Come on, look...

567
00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:09,552
You told 'em, right?

568
00:26:11,055 --> 00:26:14,674
I'm gonna tell them, yeah,
when this is finished.

569
00:26:14,676 --> 00:26:17,260
When this is finished?

570
00:26:17,262 --> 00:26:20,229
Even though you're about to
lead them through an alien war?

571
00:26:20,231 --> 00:26:22,098
Even after Flashpoint?

572
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,516
After everything you've messed up?

573
00:26:23,518 --> 00:26:25,735
All the lives you've changed?

574
00:26:25,737 --> 00:26:27,436
You still don't think you should tell them?

575
00:26:27,438 --> 00:26:29,071
Tell us what?

576
00:26:32,577 --> 00:26:38,030
Jax and Professor Stein found
a message from me in the future

577
00:26:38,032 --> 00:26:41,834
saying that, right now, I can't be trusted.

578
00:26:41,836 --> 00:26:45,671
And why would future you say that?

579
00:26:45,673 --> 00:26:49,675
I think because I went back in
time and changed the timeline,

580
00:26:49,677 --> 00:26:54,680
and now things here are
different than before I left,

581
00:26:54,682 --> 00:26:56,849
including some of your lives.

582
00:26:56,851 --> 00:26:59,969
Some of our lives? Like who?

583
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:01,137
Cisco.

584
00:27:01,139 --> 00:27:02,888
Caitlin. Wally.

585
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,640
Dig.

586
00:27:06,394 --> 00:27:07,476
Me?

587
00:27:07,478 --> 00:27:09,278
Why? What happened?

588
00:27:10,898 --> 00:27:13,733
Hey.

589
00:27:13,735 --> 00:27:16,569
Apparently, you had a daughter.

590
00:27:19,123 --> 00:27:21,741
I had a daughter, Barry?

591
00:27:21,743 --> 00:27:25,244
Baby John was Baby Sara.

592
00:27:30,251 --> 00:27:32,418
So, wait, you... let me get this straight.

593
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,086
You just, uh...

594
00:27:34,088 --> 00:27:38,174
You just erased a daughter from my life?

595
00:27:38,176 --> 00:27:39,642
Yeah.

596
00:27:39,644 --> 00:27:42,228
You can't go back and just change things

597
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,813
- like that, Barry.
- I know.

598
00:27:43,815 --> 00:27:47,016
You know how hard it is
for me to not alter events?

599
00:27:47,018 --> 00:27:49,185
To bring my sister back?

600
00:27:49,187 --> 00:27:53,989
But I don't, because I
know the implications.

601
00:27:53,991 --> 00:27:55,107
And all those aberrations

602
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:56,525
we spent the last eight months

603
00:27:56,527 --> 00:27:59,362
traveling through time trying to correct...

604
00:27:59,364 --> 00:28:02,114
you just decided that it was
okay for you to create your own?

605
00:28:02,116 --> 00:28:03,949
We should've told 'em before.

606
00:28:03,951 --> 00:28:06,285
Guys? Guys, it's Lyla.

607
00:28:06,287 --> 00:28:07,953
The President's been abducted
by the Dominators.

608
00:28:07,955 --> 00:28:09,789
She needs us now.

609
00:28:12,794 --> 00:28:14,210
Okay, you guys go.

610
00:28:14,212 --> 00:28:16,128
All right? I'm gonna sit this one out.

611
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:19,048
Obviously, you have Supergirl.
She's just as fast as I am.

612
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,384
Get the President.
We can talk about this later.

613
00:28:22,854 --> 00:28:24,804
You still trust me, right?

614
00:28:24,806 --> 00:28:26,138
I'll always trust you,

615
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:30,476
but it might take more to convince them.

616
00:28:30,478 --> 00:28:31,644
If you need me, I'll be there.

617
00:28:31,646 --> 00:28:33,696
Guys, this is cr... hey!

618
00:28:33,698 --> 00:28:35,114
This is crazy!

619
00:28:35,116 --> 00:28:37,950
Everyone is going, including Barry.

620
00:28:37,952 --> 00:28:41,203
I... I'm not going without him.

621
00:28:41,205 --> 00:28:43,372
Then you'll be here, Oliver.

622
00:28:44,709 --> 00:28:46,292
Okay.

623
00:28:46,294 --> 00:28:48,494
You know what? Oliver, it's okay.

624
00:28:49,547 --> 00:28:50,830
I will go with them.

625
00:28:50,832 --> 00:28:51,831
We'll get the President.

626
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:54,166
You stay here with Barry.

627
00:29:05,265 --> 00:29:06,347
Sure we're in the right place?

628
00:29:11,089 --> 00:29:12,422
Oh this is the last place

629
00:29:12,424 --> 00:29:14,507
the President's tracer gave a signal.

630
00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:15,959
Must be nearby.

631
00:29:19,364 --> 00:29:21,514
Yep. He's in there.

632
00:29:21,516 --> 00:29:23,216
How do you know that?

633
00:29:23,218 --> 00:29:25,235
I can see him.

634
00:29:25,237 --> 00:29:26,970
Oh, I have X-ray vision.

635
00:29:26,972 --> 00:29:30,140
Oh. You can see everyone's bits

636
00:29:30,142 --> 00:29:31,975
with those little peepers, huh?

637
00:29:31,977 --> 00:29:34,694
- No, I...
- Ignore him.

638
00:29:34,696 --> 00:29:36,613
How did you get the name Heat Wave?

639
00:29:36,615 --> 00:29:37,814
I burned my family alive,

640
00:29:37,816 --> 00:29:39,816
and I like to light things on fire.

641
00:29:39,818 --> 00:29:44,404
Aah. Well, that's a colorful backstory.

642
00:29:44,406 --> 00:29:46,322
Well, my shrink thinks so.

643
00:29:46,324 --> 00:29:49,325
By the way, I'm not gonna
call you Supergirl.

644
00:29:49,327 --> 00:29:50,326
It's stupid.

645
00:29:50,328 --> 00:29:52,295
You could call me Kara.

646
00:29:52,297 --> 00:29:54,831
That won't work either.

647
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:56,666
Well, what're you gonna shout
if you need my help?

648
00:29:56,668 --> 00:29:58,001
Skirt.

649
00:29:58,003 --> 00:29:59,052
Seriously?

650
00:29:59,054 --> 00:30:00,970
Seriously.

651
00:30:00,972 --> 00:30:03,673
But I'm not gonna need your help.

652
00:30:25,363 --> 00:30:27,247
Look! The President!

653
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:30,450
Get me out of here!

654
00:30:31,536 --> 00:30:32,502
This doesn't feel right.

655
00:30:32,504 --> 00:30:34,454
I agree, Jefferson.

656
00:30:35,257 --> 00:30:37,257
Something's coming.

657
00:30:48,937 --> 00:30:50,887
Release the President!

658
00:30:50,889 --> 00:30:53,223
We knew you would come.

659
00:30:53,225 --> 00:30:57,277
Did you guys hear that?
'Cause I heard it in my head.

660
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,063
Yeah, we heard it.

661
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:02,065
Well, if nobody else is freaked out by it,

662
00:31:02,067 --> 00:31:04,701
far be it for me to panic.

663
00:31:04,703 --> 00:31:06,035
You don't need to harm him

664
00:31:06,037 --> 00:31:07,820
to get whatever it is you want from us.

665
00:31:07,822 --> 00:31:11,124
Release him and nothing will happen to you.

666
00:31:11,126 --> 00:31:14,577
He's not who we want.

667
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:22,135
It's a trap!

668
00:31:29,094 --> 00:31:31,844
Supergirl, do something!

669
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:39,152
I didn't think about it, Oliver.

670
00:31:39,248 --> 00:31:40,497
I didn't think about the future.

671
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:41,699
I was so focused on the past,

672
00:31:41,701 --> 00:31:45,035
I didn't think about it until now.

673
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:46,871
I changed so much.

674
00:31:46,873 --> 00:31:48,873
What is this?

675
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:52,209
This is an article from the future.

676
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:54,378
It's a story about me vanishing.

677
00:31:56,549 --> 00:31:58,933
Used to be written by Iris West-Allen.

678
00:31:58,935 --> 00:32:00,551
But now, I don't know.

679
00:32:00,553 --> 00:32:02,519
Something's...
something's changed with Iris.

680
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:05,522
Something's changed with our future.

681
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:06,941
God, what did I do?

682
00:32:06,943 --> 00:32:10,060
Barry, this is a weird-looking
newspaper article.

683
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:11,395
It doesn't mean anything.

684
00:32:11,397 --> 00:32:15,449
You need to stop
beating yourself up over this.

685
00:32:15,451 --> 00:32:16,951
I'm sorry, but how can you say that?

686
00:32:16,953 --> 00:32:18,736
I'm responsible for all of this.

687
00:32:18,738 --> 00:32:20,571
Maybe. Maybe not.

688
00:32:20,573 --> 00:32:21,906
Barry, you made a choice.

689
00:32:21,908 --> 00:32:24,575
You wanted to see your parents alive again.

690
00:32:24,577 --> 00:32:25,993
Do you honestly know anyone that,

691
00:32:25,995 --> 00:32:27,244
if they were in your shoes,

692
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:29,079
wouldn't do the same exact thing?

693
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:31,215
I would do the exact same thing.

694
00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:33,050
Barry, after the Gambit went down,

695
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:35,586
it was me, my father,
and a crewmember on a life raft.

696
00:32:35,588 --> 00:32:37,755
Lost at sea.

697
00:32:37,757 --> 00:32:40,925
Enough food and water for one person, maybe.

698
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:43,510
My father took a gun, shot the crewmember,

699
00:32:43,512 --> 00:32:44,645
told me to survive,

700
00:32:44,647 --> 00:32:46,096
and then turned the gun on himself.

701
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:47,398
He shot himself in the head.

702
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,317
He sacrificed himself so that I could live.

703
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:52,319
Nothing I could do. No choice.

704
00:32:52,321 --> 00:32:55,773
Slade Wilson drove a sword
right through my mother's heart,

705
00:32:55,775 --> 00:32:57,324
in front of my sister and I.

706
00:32:57,326 --> 00:33:00,577
I was there. I was helpless on the ground.

707
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:03,497
I was powerless to stop it. No choice.

708
00:33:03,499 --> 00:33:06,283
Do you not think
that I wouldn't give anything

709
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:08,419
to go back and to make things different?

710
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:10,371
You never told me that.

711
00:33:10,373 --> 00:33:11,789
Barry, the world isn't different

712
00:33:11,791 --> 00:33:13,457
because you changed the timeline.

713
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:16,510
Change happens. Tragedy happens.

714
00:33:16,512 --> 00:33:17,928
People make choices,

715
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:20,714
and those choices affect everyone else.

716
00:33:20,716 --> 00:33:22,549
You're not a god, Barry.

717
00:33:25,855 --> 00:33:30,274
Hey, guys, wherever
you are right now, we need you.

718
00:33:30,276 --> 00:33:33,811
Oh, things just got so much worse.

719
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,407
Guys.

720
00:33:48,411 --> 00:33:52,046
Can we talk about this?

721
00:33:52,048 --> 00:33:53,580
Guess not.

722
00:33:58,337 --> 00:34:00,671
What's wrong with them?

723
00:34:00,673 --> 00:34:02,556
I don't know, but we need to find out.

724
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,397
Okay!

725
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,016
You really did it this time!

726
00:34:12,018 --> 00:34:13,017
Seriously?

727
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:14,351
Yeah, seriously.

728
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:18,906
- What's that?
- That would be heat vision.

729
00:34:18,908 --> 00:34:20,691
Okay.

730
00:35:16,271 --> 00:35:18,104
What is going on?

731
00:35:18,106 --> 00:35:19,289
Barry and Oliver stayed behind

732
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,656
while everyone went
to go save the President,

733
00:35:20,658 --> 00:35:21,957
but now everyone's crazy

734
00:35:21,959 --> 00:35:23,626
and going all "Kill Bill"
on the both of them.

735
00:35:23,628 --> 00:35:25,578
The Dominators have them under
some sort of mind control.

736
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,213
They can't hold them off forever.

737
00:35:27,215 --> 00:35:29,081
- I got to get out there.
- The hell you do.

738
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:30,583
They can't beat them by themselves,

739
00:35:30,585 --> 00:35:32,668
especially not with Supergirl against them.

740
00:35:48,486 --> 00:35:50,403
Wally?

741
00:35:50,405 --> 00:35:52,354
Kid Flash.

742
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:04,250
Wally? Wally? Talk to me, Wally.

743
00:36:04,252 --> 00:36:06,085
Hey! Come on.

744
00:36:06,087 --> 00:36:08,254
Guys. Wally's hurt bad, but he's alive.

745
00:36:08,256 --> 00:36:11,040
Let's get an ETA
on overriding the mind control!

746
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:12,675
- Bingo!
- Yahtzee!

747
00:36:12,677 --> 00:36:13,960
You go first.
You go first. It's your office.

748
00:36:14,036 --> 00:36:15,585
There's a weird signal coming
from the salt mines.

749
00:36:15,587 --> 00:36:17,037
For the record,
that is what I was gonna say.

750
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:18,839
Can you jam it?

751
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:21,258
Uh, no.

752
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,709
How many of those do you have left?

753
00:36:22,711 --> 00:36:25,512
Probably not enough.

754
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:27,097
Okay, this hallway leads
to a bunker under the building.

755
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:28,265
Just hold 'em off as long as you can.

756
00:36:28,267 --> 00:36:30,801
Where are you going?

757
00:36:30,803 --> 00:36:33,437
If they can't shut it down, maybe she can.

758
00:36:38,277 --> 00:36:40,894
Hey, Supergirl!

759
00:36:40,896 --> 00:36:43,113
Let's finally see who's faster.

760
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,836
Too slow.

761
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:45,959
- What is he doing?
- He's making her angry.

762
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:48,462
But he knows Supergirl is invincible.

763
00:37:48,464 --> 00:37:50,464
Think maybe that's the point.

764
00:39:08,594 --> 00:39:09,793
Barry?

765
00:39:26,395 --> 00:39:30,313
Guys, they're back.

766
00:39:34,236 --> 00:39:35,869
What happened?

767
00:39:35,871 --> 00:39:39,072
You didn't kill me, so my day's looking up.

768
00:39:39,074 --> 00:39:40,824
I'm so sorry.

769
00:39:40,826 --> 00:39:43,910
Hey, you're not the first
superhero to be mind-controlled.

770
00:39:53,755 --> 00:39:55,422
Okay, I know what you're gonna say,

771
00:39:55,424 --> 00:39:57,641
but I had to do something.

772
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,261
I'm glad you're okay.

773
00:40:01,263 --> 00:40:03,597
- Don't ever do that again.
- Aah!

774
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,181
Sorry. Not sorry.

775
00:40:06,602 --> 00:40:09,402
Come on. Let's get you checked out.

776
00:40:09,404 --> 00:40:13,156
And then we can talk about
how dumb that was.

777
00:40:13,158 --> 00:40:15,325
Okay.

778
00:40:15,327 --> 00:40:16,776
Okay.

779
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,996
Okay what?

780
00:40:19,998 --> 00:40:23,166
They don't see your potential.

781
00:40:23,168 --> 00:40:24,784
I do.

782
00:40:24,786 --> 00:40:26,286
One of my many gifts.

783
00:40:27,089 --> 00:40:29,706
You want to train?

784
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:31,341
I'll train you.

785
00:40:36,465 --> 00:40:38,715
So, what was it like being
all mind-controlled and stuff?

786
00:40:38,717 --> 00:40:41,968
I didn't realize he had
a mind to be controlled.

787
00:40:44,022 --> 00:40:45,972
Barry, about before.

788
00:40:45,974 --> 00:40:49,192
Message or no message, we're with you.

789
00:40:49,194 --> 00:40:51,861
- Thank you.
- Where's Supergirl?

790
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:53,563
Scanning the city to make sure there aren't

791
00:40:53,565 --> 00:40:56,449
any more of the orbs
that whammied all of you.

792
00:40:56,451 --> 00:40:58,818
- Okay, so now what?
- We call Lyla.

793
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:01,705
Tell her these Dominators
aren't here peacefully.

794
00:41:07,296 --> 00:41:08,411
Sara!

795
00:41:13,168 --> 00:41:15,835
Everybody inside! Go!

796
00:41:40,076 --> 00:41:42,120
