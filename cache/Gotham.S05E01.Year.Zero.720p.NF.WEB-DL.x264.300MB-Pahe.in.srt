[man on radio] <i>Mr. Gordon, your people</i>

No, no, no.
It is clear you don't understand.

Given over
to criminals and murderers.

GCPD controls a 10-block area

[Alfred] Yeah, well, we tried to get her
out the night everything went to hell.

Hey, come on, that's enough.
Move it out of here.

97
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,235
[Gordon] So, how are we doing?

98
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,945
[Lucius]
Well, we got a month of food left.

99
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,031
Less if refugees keep coming.

100
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,075
What did
the department of douchbag-ery say?

101
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,328
Same as always. Not sending any help.

102
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,580
Not letting anyone leave.
I had to try.

103
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,166
Swear to God,
I am never paying taxes again.

104
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,667
And if people ask?

105
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,546
Well, sooner or later, the government
will do the right thing.

106
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,216
Rebuild the bridges,
take back the city.

107
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,342
Just have to be patient.

108
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:30,968
And the truth?

109
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,261
We're on our own.

110
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,805
Truth is, we have no idea
what might happen.

111
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,808
And our job is to keep ourselves,

112

and everyone else, alive.

113
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,647
[Harvey] We're down

decides to make a move?

This time, woke up on a rooftop.

Same thing. No idea how I got there

or what happened
during the preceding hours.

127

Show yourself.

Idiot Ed still won't appear.

131
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:12,862
Coward.

132
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,781
But I know it's him controlling me
when I'm sleeping.

133
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,495
Why?

134
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,123
What is he doing?

135
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,053
You know, you could get someone else
to turn on the spotlight.

136
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,265
I like doing it.

137
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,353
I guess it reminds people
that even in darkness there is light.

138
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:47,938
And it reminds me.

139
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,109
We're low on supplies.

140
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,946
Government won't evac,
won't send in help.

141
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:58,908
It doesn't make sense.

142
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,079
I imagine from where they sit,

143
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,997
it's pretty easy
to ignore people's suffering.

144
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,588
I gave Lucius permission to raid
the Wayne Enterprise's R&amp;D lab

145
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:13,756
for whatever he could scavenge.

He's working on night-vision goggles
for your men. It's not much.

Everything helps.

148
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:24,100
Bruce, we stayed because people here
still need protection.

149
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,267
That hasn't changed.

150
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,566

The doctor is worried
Selina's condition is getting worse.

No. You?

Hell, no.

157
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,909
Mr. Cobblepot offers 1,000 rounds

158
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,745
of freshly-minted 9mm stock

159

160
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:30,958
Hmm.

161
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,585
So, what we're hearing is true.

Cupboard's a bit bare in Penguinland.

163
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:37,673
Absolutely not.

164
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,260
Mr. Cobblepot just had
a hankering for red meat.

165
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,221
[scoffs] Please! Ozzie wants to get fat
on rib-eye

166
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,723
while his minions starve.

167
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,641
-Shocker.
-[Tabitha] I have a question.

168
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:51,228
Why hasn't your boss left his citadel
since the bridges blew?

169
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,148
He's scared I'm going to
stick him in the throat?

170
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,152
Tabby's still raw from when Penguin
murdered Butch right in front of her,

171
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,946
so it will have to be 2,000 rounds.

172
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,740
Barbara, we're not giving
that bastard anything.

173
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,783
Exactly.

174
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,660
We're trading for something we need.

175
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,120
No.

176
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,248
Honey,

177
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,418
no one is asking you
to forget what happened.

178
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,796
But how do we protect the women
who come in here every day

179
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,881
looking for safety?

180
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,799
We need this.

181
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,427
Penguin's time will come.

182
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,387
I promise.

183
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,474
[scoffs]

184
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,486
He's going to regret giving me this.

185
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,700
Better make it 3,000 rounds.

186

[indistinct radio chatter]

187

There.

00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,714
See? The shadow moved.

[laughing]

191
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,884
It's just a shadow, man.

No. Something's out there.

00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,614
Don't you want me to make it stop?

Yes!

200

Open this door.

Reinforce all barriers
that front Penguin's territory.

Find Lucius.

[Alfred] Don't you worry, Master Bruce.

220
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,026
The clinic has got
its own backup generator.

They're stealing all the medicine.

Alfred, stay with Selina.

228
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,712
Of course,
but you can't go down there.

229
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,673
It's going to be pitch black.
Gonna need a torch or something.

Lucius gave me something better.

00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,262
Careful.

232
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,215
I know
what you're thinking, Captain.

233

"I have so few bullets,

I already know it's not.

Now the question is,
why are you here?

238
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,605
It's not to steal the generator.

239
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,441
Why would I want light?

240

00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,697
So what then? Came for our supplies?

00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,781
Exactly so.

243
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,784
But since I'm here,
I'll also take your life.

At least they'll be alive.

All right, that buys us two weeks.
Then what?

[Harvey] Jim, at this point,
the bastards across the river

are going to have to
step up and help.

Why start now? They haven't before.

[Harvey] For the love of God!

283
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,472
Because we stayed
to do the job they wouldn't. Huh?

284
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,892
And now they're just going to
sit back and watch while we starve,

or tear ourselves apart,

going to happen.

[Gordon] I know, Harv,

288
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,689
but right now, we have to
tell these people something.

We tried that.

We couldn't even get permission
to take off.

293

Zero tolerance. Nothing in or out.

Well, I'm not asking for permission.

295

It's ready.

to have it delivered

from our East Bay hangar.

We can have a supply truck here
within hours.

Man, it is nice to have
a billionaire around.

the government's going to find out.

It's a one-time solution.

didn't just take food.

They stole medicine from the clinic.

There are people in pain.

305
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,903

help is on the way.

How's Selina?

308
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,331
She's strong. She'll pull through.

[Selina]
Doc says the surgery was a success.

310
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,103
My spine
is not going to turn to jelly.

311
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,856
I'll still
never be able to walk again,

312
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,942
so, that's a bummer.

313
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,488
There's limited resources here.

314

But there's hope
once we join the mainland.

Gee...

316
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,330
For a second there, I was worried.

317
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,959
Selina, I know you're in pain.

318

Some medicine is on its way.

Jeremiah shot me to get to you.

[scoffs] After all the things I've done,

322

what did me in was being your friend.

323
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,824
I just wish Jeremiah had killed me.

324
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,178
Doctors can't help her.

325

00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,603
What's the plan, boss? Cover me.

491
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,775
Oswald!

492
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,652
I want to make a deal.

493
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,279
A deal, Jim?

494
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,742
We split
whatever's in the chopper 50-50,

495
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,787
and you let Barbara go.

496
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,289
No.

497
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,292
He does not get to
limp out of here alive!

498
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,377
[groans]

499
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,756
I got a deal for you, Jim.

500
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,260
She dies, I take everything,

501
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:35,805
and you go home
and reflect long and hard

502
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,557
on my generosity!

503
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,891
[Gordon] And if I say no?

504
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,894
What happens
when the government finds out

505
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,022
you murdered the only cops
left in Gotham?

506
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,442
Nothing.

507
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,946
Jim, as far as I can tell,
you have nothing to offer,

508
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,698
and you're out of ammo.

509
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,241
[groans]

510
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,786
[screaming]

511
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,456
Not anymore.

512
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,710
Truth is, I was never going to
make that deal.

513
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,837
I need all those supplies. Load up!

514
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,298
[groans loudly]

515
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,352
[officer] We got it. Here we go, people.

516
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,479
Heads up!

517
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,941
[Harvey] You think Penguin
is going to pull through? [Gordon]
Cockroaches are hard to kill.

518
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,612
At least he'll be
out of commission for a while.

519
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,863
You had him dead to rights.

520
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,281
You could have put him down for good.

521
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,450
Yeah, shot a man without warning.

522
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,202
Three months ago, I would have
lost my badge for that.

523
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,579
Three months ago, we weren't
fighting for our survival.

524
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:42,955
You think it didn't cross my mind? I know what we're up against, Harvey.

525
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,709
No one is coming to help.

526
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,127
Why didn't you do us all a favor

527
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,338
and put that murdering son of a bitch
in a hole?

528
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,340
You want rules for this game?

529
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,217
I'll tell you.
I'll make it simple, okay?

530
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,384
You win, or you die.

531
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,803
The next time, shoot to kill.

532
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,225
-Are you all right?
-No.

533
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,143
But we're alive, so that's something.
What's up?

534
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,062
The medicine
has just been taken to the clinic.

535
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,188
I need to check on Selina.

536
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,648
Yeah, sure. I'll get you a ride.

537
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,817
Hey! Let me know how she is.

538
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,819
And, Bruce...

539
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,198
Next time you want to help, just ask.

540
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:18,950
You've earned a place here.

541
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,599
[radio static]

542
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,018
[woman on radio] <i>Captain Gordon? Hello?</i>

543
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,354
<i>Captain Gordon, come in.</i>

544
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,111
<i>Captain Gordon, do you read me?</i>

545
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,698
<i>Hello?</i>

546
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,199
<i>Come in.</i>

547
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,076
This is James Gordon.
Who am I speaking to?

548
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,370
<i>A friend.</i>

549
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:07,123

<i>We will find a way to help you.</i>

551
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:09,917
And who are you?

552
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:47,914
[gasps]

553
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,127
Get out of here!

554
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,091
Really?

555
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,885
A dumpster?

[yells]

00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,278
What are you doing to me?

559
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,530
Show yourself!

560
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,617
What is happening to me?

561
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,408
I promise.

562
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,288
If it's the last thing I do,

563
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:15,501
I will kill him!

564
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:17,962
[Penguin screaming]

565
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,298
My leg!

566
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,717
He shot my leg!

567
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,260
I just fixed this.

568
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,804
Mr. Cobblepot,
if you could hold still.

569
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:27,972
Put out the word.

570
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,974
One hundred thousand rounds
of ammunition

571
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,851
to whoever kills Jim Gordon.

572
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,894
I want his head!

[Selina] Let me go!

Let me go!

580
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,778
[sobbing] I can't use my legs.

581
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,532
I have no reason to... I can't...

582
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,753
You should have just let me do it.

583
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,966
Let her do what? What happened?

584
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,427
She was trying to kill herself.

585
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,390
I've got restraints
for when she wakes.

586
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:03,734
I told you.

587
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,487
You want to cure her?
You have to go to the witch.

588
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,742
And where do I find this witch?

589
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,208
-[woman] Thank you so much.
-No problem.

590
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,503
-Thank you very much.
-[Harvey] Saint Jim of Gotham. All right.

591
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,674
Hey. Every new refugee who comes in,

592
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:27,758
I want questioned.

593
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,510
We need information
on Jeremiah Valeska.

594
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,303
I haven't heard that clown's name
in three months.

595
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,513
Why now?

596
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,140
Just call it a hunch.

597
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,183
Well, rather than a week of food,

598
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,685
we've got six weeks.

599
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,438
-It's not a lot.
-Yeah, but it's better than we were.

600
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,772
Don't give up hope.

601
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,858
Captain Gordon! Captain Gordon!

602
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,028
What's going on?

603
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,240
I was on duty
at the Thompson Street barricade.

604
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,577
He just appeared.
He said he needed to see you.

605
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:56,662
What happened, son?

606
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,289
Where did you come from?

607
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,333
Past the train station. [Harvey]
That's on the other side of town.

608
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,629
This kid must have made it through
half a dozen sectors to get here.

609
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:07,798
[Will] My brothers and sisters...

610
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:10,801
They're killing us.

611
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:11,886
[Gordon] Who is?

612
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,054
[Will] You have to help us.

613
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:15,723
[Gordon] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

614
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,641
Get him to the clinic.

615
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,435
[Will coughs]

616
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,328
I know you're all asking,
"Why are we still here

617
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,038
"when our own government
won't help us?"

618
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,749
It's simple.

619
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,462
We're supposed to be
giving these people hope.

620
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,509
Hope that if they're in danger,
someone will come.

621
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,554
We will come.
