1
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,235
In here.

2
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,470
Hey!

3
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,348
Hey! Hey! What about him?

4
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,351
What about him?

5
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,162
Hey. Someone.

6
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,708
Help. Assistance.

7
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,794
This man needs help.

8
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,047
This man pays my salary.

9
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,494
Forty-point-two-three pounds.

10
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,211
{\an8}Are they back yet?

11
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,713
{\an8}Have you heard from anyone?

12
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,592
{\an8}If Pinkman is gone

13
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:59,471
{\an8}I'm done. Do you understand?
I quit.

14
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,942
{\an8}I just told you, 40.23 pounds.

15
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:19,074
{\an8}Forty-point-two-one.

16
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:46,059
{\an8}My brother-in-law, he keeps talking
about driving out to the factory farm.

17
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,688
{\an8}And I have... I have stalled him
as long as I possibly can.

18
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,815
{\an8}It's really at the point now

19
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:55,068
{\an8}where he's gonna find someone else
to take him there.

20
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,488
{\an8}So I don't know
if it's been made presentable yet.

21
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:02,617
{\an8}But I should be the one
to take him out there, right?

22
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,375
{\an8}Can you just run it up
the chain of command then?

23
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,516
{\an8}Anything suspicious?

24
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,729
{\an8}Still no, Walt.

25
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,402
{\an8}Well, then should we go?

26
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:42,616
{\an8}Got some place to be? Because it's,
like, the third time you asked me that.

27
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:46,828
{\an8}No, I'm just curious
what the next move is.

28
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,207
{\an8}Our next three moves
is sitting here and waiting.

29
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,292
This here's the job, buddy.

30
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:56,588
{\an8}Ain't all supermodels and speedboats,
you know.

31
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,346
{\an8}Any cartel news these days?

32
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:09,184
{\an8}Seems like I'm always reading
something or other in the paper.

33
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,146
{\an8}Yeah, well,
not a lot happening stateside.

34
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,483
{\an8}Hearing rumblings
about some big play down south.

35
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,194
Lots of bodies, apparently.

36
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:22,030
You know, even by cartel standards.

37
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:26,952
We'll know more
when the buzzards leave the bones.

38
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,626
So when we gonna talk about your face?

39
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,424
- I don't wanna get into it, okay?
- No, it's not okay.

40
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,636
My brother-in-law shows up
looking like Macho Camacho,

41
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,180
and he thinks we're not gonna discuss it?

42
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,683
If you're in over your head on something

43
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,894
don't you think I might be the guy
to come to?

44
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:59,317
{\an8}You know, one of my old buddies
from Glynco had a gambling problem

45
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:05,198
except his thing was scratch cards
instead of blackjack.

46
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:10,954
{\an8}Dumb Okie bastard had his car repo'd
playing scratch-and-wins.

47
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:16,459
He's fine now, you know.
He got help and all.

48
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:22,340
But I know he got on a ride
that was rough to get off of.

49
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,468
I'm just saying I'm here, you know.

50
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,888
If you want to talk about it.

51
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:36,521
I don't want to talk about it,
to you or to anyone else.

52
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:39,398
I'm done explaining myself.

53
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:10,555
Hey, you think he needs more blood?

54
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,724
It's in the refrigerator.

55
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,519
What, you...? You want me to...?

56
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,202
A-negative, yes?

57
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,871
Your blood type?

58
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,875
I don't know, maybe.

59
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,088
A-negative, 25 years old

60
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,925
seventy kilo, 180 centimeters.

61
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:52,472
You smoke, you drink,
you puff, puff, puff.

62
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,517
But no disease, no condition.

63
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,646
No complication
other than an allergy to...

64
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,106
Oh, wait, don't say.

65
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,692
Erythromycin.

66
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:07,946
But I have cefazolin here, so no problem.

67
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,322
How do you know all that?

68
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,998
Jesus.

69
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,500
He thought of everything.

70
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,425
O-negative.

71
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,176
That's what he needs.

72
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,309
It's time to go.

73
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,103
What about Mike?

74
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:45,442
With this injury? No travel.
At least a week.

75
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,612
I'll send for him.

76
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,097
Water and rest.

77
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,354
What happened to the plane?

78
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,885
There are many good ways south.

79
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:57,097
But, unfortunately, only one way north.

80
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,976
Six miles to Texas.

81
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,605
I've got a man there
who'll drive us the rest of the way.

82
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,319
I kind of liked the plane.

83
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,659
So you gonna make it?
Six miles is pretty far.

84
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,702
I'll make it.

85
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,375
You did well down here.

86
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,877
And you also proved a point.

87
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,341
I think you can run the lab
by yourself now.

88
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,176
Don't you?

89
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,185
Let Mr. White go.

90
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,940
Pay him off or fire him.

91
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,900
Don't kill him.

92
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,782
- You know that won't work.
- Then you got a problem.

93
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:20,055
Hi. We're home.

94
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,684
Are you doing your homework?

95
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,561
Yeah.

96
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,191
Well, dinner is in about 30.

97
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,613
<i>Hey, sorry to call you at home,</i>

98
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,908
<i>but I think maybe
you're not getting my messages.</i>

99
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:43,495
<i>That or you just
don't feel like talking to me.</i>

100
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:47,332
<i>Anyway, why I've been calling
is because that thing we discussed?</i>

101
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,501
<i>Well, I've been thinking,</i>

102
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:54,673
<i>and I decided I can't do it. That's
probably not what you wanted to hear.</i>

103
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,050
<i>But hopefully you'll understand,</i>

104
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,345
<i>and if you want to talk more about it,
that's fine.</i>

105
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,763
<i>So call me. I'm around.</i>

106
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,490
- Hey. Come on in.
- Hi.

107
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:30,709
First, I wanna tell you that I get it.

108
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:36,381
From what you've told me, this situation
with Walt's gambling sounds

109
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,799
intense.

110
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:42,762
Yeah, it definitely was.

111
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:46,016
And continues to be.

112
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:53,690
So I would greatly appreciate it
if you would just

113
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,650
help me out here.

114
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:59,029
Well, I've thought long and hard
about this...

115
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,658
and here's what I want to do.

116
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:11,291
So is Walt gonna be okay?

117
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,168
Are you in contact with him?

118
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,253
He's fine.

119
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,922
Good. That's good.

120
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,386
- He doesn't know about you offering...?
- No. Absolutely not.

121
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:27,349
And I mean to keep it that way, so...

122
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:34,481
Six hundred and seventeen
thousand dollars written out to me.

123
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:40,861
- What is this?
- I can't take your money.

124
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,532
- And why is that?
- Because, at the end of the day

125
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:49,662
paying my debt
with illicit gambling winnings...

126
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,707
I don't know, it feels wrong.

127
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,709
"It feels wrong"?

128
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,669
To me it does.

129
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:01,174
I'm not judging you or Walt. I'm
just saying I feel uncomfortable with it.

130
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:05,136
Well, Ted, the whole reason
we're in this mess

131
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:08,264
is because you had me cooking your books.

132
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:13,228
So when did wrong
suddenly become a problem for you?

133
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:15,896
Now, hold on, that was a one-time measure

134
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,608
in an honest attempt
to protect my employees,

135
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,360
and save my dad's company.

136
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:24,697
It might've been a mistake, but that's
no reason to go out and make another.

137
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,535
No, Ted, this is the big mistake,
right here.

138
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:34,499
You owe the federal government
$617,000. If you do not pay them

139
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:38,169
they will come after you
and then they will come after me.

140
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:43,383
And if they audit my business,
find out that Walt and I paid for it

141
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,512
with close to a million dollars
in untaxed gambling winnings

142
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:52,225
we will go to prison, where you will
already be. Do you understand?

143
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:56,521
I understand you're upset, but I think
you're overstating things too.

144
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,064
No one's going to prison.

145
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,733
Oh, my God.
How are you not following me here?

146
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:06,072
Okay, fine, let's say I take your advice.

147
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,825
I pay the IRS. Then what?

148
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,327
Then you don't owe them.

149
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:14,622
Okay, but I still owe the bank, Skyler.

150
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:18,626
I'm still going to go bankrupt
and lose my business and my home.

151
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,504
I still have to pull my girls
out of school.

152
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:26,509
Just because I pay some stupid fine
doesn't make my life any less ruined.

153
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:33,433
So if I'm understanding you correctly

154
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,145
you're saying you can't take
the money I gave you,

155
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,940
but you can take a larger amount.

156
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,818
No. I'm just saying

157
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:47,155
as much as I appreciate the gesture

158
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:50,366
the money you gave me
doesn't really change anything.

159
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:55,497
- Because it's not enough?
- No, no, don't twist my words.

160
00:15:55,663 --> 00:16:00,293
This isn't about amounts,
this is about me doing the right thing.

161
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,758
- Ted, are you blackmailing me?
- What? No. Blackmailing?

162
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,718
God.

163
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,933
- I feel I'm not explaining things right.
- I think you're explaining it fine.

164
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:26,611
I notice that this is for less
than what I gave you, by the way.

165
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,364
That's the Mercedes. I leased it before
I knew where the money came from.

166
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,825
Now that you know,
you will be returning it.

167
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,246
The leases are ironclad,
so I have to see what's possible,

168
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,915
but, yeah, I'm gonna do my best.

169
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:41,668
And I will pay you back as soon as I can.

170
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:48,007
I don't want you to pay me, Ted.
I want you to pay them.

171
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,098
Try it again.

172
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:56,808
Write a new check.

173
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,143
- Skyler.
- Same amount.

174
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,230
- This time, made payable...
- What happened to us?

175
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:06,401
Make it payable
to the Internal Revenue Service.

176
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,906
- I can't.
- You have to.

177
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:16,578
- Actually, no I don't.
- Write it.

178
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,182
Saul Goodman, please.

179
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,936
Tell him it's important.

180
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,147
Yeah.

181
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,694
<i>What have I done?</i>

182
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:04,208
Hello, Hector.

183
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,831
All of them, Hector.

184
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,542
Don Eladio.

185
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,170
Don Paco. Cesar.

186
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:52,090
Renaldo. Artuno.

187
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,342
Cisco and Luis.

188
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,719
Escalada.

189
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,682
All dead.

190
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:04,727
As is your grandson, Joaquin.

191
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,902
Do you know who killed Joaquin?

192
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,241
Would you like to see?

193
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,125
This young man.

194
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:29,919
Do you remember him?

195
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:35,299
That young man shot Joaquin to death

196
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:38,594
while I made my escape.

197
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:45,226
I believe you have met him before.

198
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,777
It was just you and Joaquin.

199
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:58,072
He was the only family you had left.

200
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:05,288
Now the Salamanca name dies with you.

201
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,044
Will you look at me now?

202
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,758
Look at me, Hector.

203
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,513
Look at me.

204
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,621
I really appreciate you doing this.

205
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:32,416
You guys must have your hands filled
with the car wash and all.

206
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,377
No, no. No worries.

207
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,796
Happy to do it.

208
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:42,426
Besides, it gives me a chance
to see how you work a case.

209
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,887
- It's interesting.
- Yeah.

210
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,265
Like watching weeds grow.

211
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,977
This job can be boring as hell.

212
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,145
Until it's not.

213
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,901
So...

214
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:03,656
- Any more news on that thing in Mexico?
- No, same old, same old.

215
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:07,869
Bunch of animals
clawing each other's eyes out over turf.

216
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:12,290
So you think all the victims
were cartel members?

217
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:16,294
Not in the loop enough to know.
Take a right on this street, will you?

218
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,587
Right?

219
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,340
But we're going to the chicken farm,
that's straight ahead.

220
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,801
No, we're taking a little detour.

221
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,305
All right.

222
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:32,310
Yeah, there's this industrial laundry
I wanna check out.

223
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,521
It's not far.
Just, yeah, turn right here.

224
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,862
What...?
What laundry? What about it?

225
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:46,073
It's owned by this company,
this Madrigal Electromotive.

226
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,119
It's this big German conglomerate
right into everything.

227
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:55,875
It turns out it's the same company
that owns Fring's chicken joints.

228
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:04,383
Sounds like a real shot
in the dark there.

229
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,552
I mean, you said it yourself.

230
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,596
If this Madrigal, is it?

231
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:11,140
If this is such a big conglomerate

232
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:15,561
then, you know, they must own
all kinds of businesses.

233
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:21,067
No, it just...
It just sounds kind of thin.

234
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,654
Well, look at you. You lose your hair,
go on a couple stakeouts

235
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,365
all of a sudden you're, what, Kojak?

236
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,325
I'm just saying.

237
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:35,247
Now, the chicken farm, however,
boy, that place seems ripe,

238
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:39,085
for some kind of clandestine activities.

239
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,088
I just don't want us to miss anything,
you know?

240
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,674
You wanna talk
about clandestine activities?

241
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,510
Madrigal Electromotive
also owns a subsidiary

242
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:51,806
that manufactures this
state-of-the-art air-filtration system.

243
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,811
And none other than Gale Boetticher
took delivery of one of these systems.

244
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:59,939
A chemist who was in possession
of hand-drawn plans,

245
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:05,069
for a meth super-lab and was visited
by none other than Gus Fring

246
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:08,072
just days before he was capped
in the face, okay?

247
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:10,449
This shit is starting to feel like...

248
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,952
Like <i>Three Days Of The Condor,</i> you know?

249
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:18,708
Anyway, an industrial laundry would be
one hell of a place to hide a meth lab.

250
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,711
There it is right up there.
Just turn in there.

251
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:27,723
Walt, slow down.
You gotta turn in there, Walt.

252
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,595
- What are you doing? You missed it.
- Sorry.

253
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:35,683
It looked like a dirt road.
I thought you meant further up.

254
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,145
Just... Just bang a U-ie over here.

255
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,203
Hits the spot. Thanks, guys.

256
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:59,457
I said to Mom "ice cream,"
but she was like:

257
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:03,377
"It tastes the same and it's healthier."
So sorry.

258
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,920
I tried.

259
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:08,883
Frozen yogurt does taste the same.
Tastes exactly the same.

260
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,343
I feel, like, sorry for your taste buds.

261
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:15,014
- Weigh in here, Uncle Hank.
- Hey, it's free food.

262
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:18,434
Free food always tastes good.
Free drinks even better.

263
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:20,102
Hey, hon.

264
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,773
Can you handle another visitor?

265
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,317
Mr. Magoo. Yeah, sure.
Hey, watch out.

266
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:29,445
- Don't run into any walls or anything.
- Okay.

267
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:32,865
Hey, Dad.

268
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,784
Hey, son.

269
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,952
So how you feeling, Hank?

270
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,955
It feels like one of those cones
they put on dogs,

271
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:44,877
- so they don't lick their own balls.
- Nice. Thank you. Stay classy.

272
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:48,714
Anyway, hanging in there.
Glad you stopped by.

273
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:52,009
Listen, I'm sorry about all this.

274
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,762
I mean,
that guy just came out of nowhere.

275
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:56,847
Yeah, actually, he didn't.

276
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,849
I saw him coming a mile away.

277
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,186
Hey, just mark it down as a brain fart,

278
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:05,605
and be thankful no one got killed.

279
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:09,485
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
Your Hardy Boys routine is over.

280
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:12,071
No more asking him
to drive you on stakeouts.

281
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,698
It's too dangerous. You hear me?

282
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,700
- I'll do it.
- No, you won't.

283
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:20,246
No, Marie's right.
It was a bit short-sighted of me.

284
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,457
- That's why I caved.
- Caved?

285
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:27,336
Yeah, I broke down.
I ordered me a gimp-mobile.

286
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:31,382
I wish you would stop calling it that.

287
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,510
What do you mean?
Like a handi-van with a lift?

288
00:26:34,677 --> 00:26:38,931
No, no, it's a regular Tahoe.
It's got hand controls. I ordered it.

289
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:43,435
Should be here in about a week.
I don't expect to be in it long,

290
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:47,857
but gotta get around on my own. Stop
being such a damn burden to everyone.

291
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,909
Sorry. Car wash business.

292
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:01,537
<i>Hey, it's me. Can you talk?</i>

293
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:03,706
- I can listen.
<i>- Fair enough.</i>

294
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:07,293
He doesn't own a gun,
at least not one that he bought legally.

295
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:12,089
Nor does his home security system
have any panic-button arrangement.

296
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:16,510
So way I see it, we're good to go. If
this is still how you want to handle it.

297
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,806
Like I said, I don't want anyone hurt.

298
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:24,143
All I want is for him to write a check.

299
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:28,397
Yeah. It's gonna be fine.
I've got my A-team on it.

300
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:48,459
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, thanks.

301
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:50,794
What...? You just can't...

302
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,675
- What's this about?
- I'll tell you what this is about.

303
00:27:56,842 --> 00:28:00,262
This is about you and me
doing our best to keep Huell happy.

304
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,641
- Huell? Who's Huell?
- This is Huell.

305
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:07,186
- Huell, you happy?
- Reasonably.

306
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:09,104
What would make you unhappy?

307
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,774
This motherfucker
not doing what he's told.

308
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:15,277
If you were unhappy,
Mr. Beneke wouldn't care for that?

309
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,947
I'm gonna say no.

310
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:21,617
Well, there you have it.
Let's go find your checkbook. Ready?

311
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:25,246
Here we go. All right?
We're walking, we're swinging our feet.

312
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,540
There you go. Very nice.
Beautiful place you have here.

313
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:35,422
This way. So the amount's
gonna be for $617,226...

314
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:38,467
- I don't have that kind of money.
- Hold that thought.

315
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:42,805
Forgot to mention we know exactly how
much money is in your account, okay?

316
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:46,684
Understand? You still want to say
that stuff from before? Maybe not.

317
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:53,691
So $617,226 and 31 cents

318
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:57,695
made payable
to the Internal Revenue Service.

319
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,114
What?

320
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,783
Wait, this is...?

321
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,828
- Skyler? Skyler White sent you?
- It doesn't matter.

322
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:08,372
For now, all you have to do
is worry about that.

323
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:10,457
My God, this is a misunderstanding.

324
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:13,252
Skyler is a dear friend of mine,
all right?

325
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:16,046
Let me call her. We'll...

326
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:20,843
No, you're misunderstanding,
Mr. Beneke. Phone-call time is over.

327
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:24,054
- Check-writing time.
- Skyler would never do this to me.

328
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,764
Sit down and write!

329
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,685
There you go.

330
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:37,109
Six hundred seventeen thousand,
two hundred twenty-six dollars,

331
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:38,944
and thirty-one...

332
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,113
Yeah, right.

333
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,576
You got it.

334
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,043
Huell, you happy?

335
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,837
Huell's happy.

336
00:29:57,004 --> 00:30:01,008
All right. Everything else
has been filled out for you.

337
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:03,344
All's we need

338
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:07,598
is a signature

339
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:09,141
right there.

340
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,231
Great.

341
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:17,858
Hard part is over.

342
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:21,612
Here's what happens next.
Huell is gonna hang here with you.

343
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:25,324
I'm gonna make sure I get this down
to UPS before 5:00.

344
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,701
Way back, I'm gonna grab some sandwiches.

345
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:31,038
The three of us can hang out
and play cards or watch TV,

346
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,855
for the next couple
of days until the check clears.

347
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,126
Painless, right?

348
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,004
Unless you don't have cable

349
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,174
in which case it's gonna suck, so...

350
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:30,597
Does the laundry have to be dirty?

351
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:34,643
Nope.

352
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,147
Someone cooked here.

353
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:24,234
You've been out of commission four days.

354
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:28,780
You think we're gonna shut down
the whole operation just for you?

355
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,700
Who cooked? Who was here?

356
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:43,212
I don't know how you're doing the flips.
Tell me.

357
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,630
Keep cool.

358
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:48,467
Oh, I'm gonna get you.
Oh, I'm gonna get you.

359
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,180
Jump.

360
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,500
You're pressing buttons,
and it makes you do magical stuff.

361
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,563
- No.
- Yes. Cheater.

362
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,565
- Hey.
- Who's winning?

363
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:06,610
- I am.
- Well... Yeah. Look at you.

364
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:09,279
- Look at...
- Yeah.

365
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:15,327
- A hundred and one back flips, I did.
- Oh, you. Hey, keep it going.

366
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,329
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Relax.

367
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,164
- You're in trouble.
- Good luck.

368
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,542
Mama is in the house.

369
00:33:23,544 --> 00:33:25,337
Jesse.

370
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:31,176
- What do you want? I'm busy.
- We need to talk.

371
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,471
I got nothing to say to you, man.

372
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:39,643
Jesse, please. I'm sorry.

373
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,896
Just one minute. That's all I ask.

374
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,065
Get the hell out of my house.

375
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,775
Come on. Come on.

376
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,111
Hey. Just give me one minute.

377
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:51,989
Let me just explain. Okay.

378
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,532
Let me...

379
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:57,995
All right. All right.
Okay, okay. All right, I'm sorry.

380
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:02,082
I know that you have been cooking
without me.

381
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:05,168
That's right. So what?

382
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,797
So what?

383
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:12,843
Isn't it obvious to you
what Gus is planning?

384
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:15,887
He's going to use you to replace me.

385
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,807
He doesn't think you need me anymore.

386
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:24,563
Jesse. Jesse, if you agree

387
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,815
to replace me

388
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:28,775
he will kill me.

389
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:34,323
You brought your brother-in-law to our
lab. What the hell is wrong with you?

390
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,618
- That's not my fault, Jesse.
- Get off.

391
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:41,121
You've got to help me. Please.

392
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:44,958
The last time I asked for your help,
you said:

393
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:50,380
"I hope you end up buried in a barrel
in the Mexican desert."

394
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,524
You are done.

395
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,402
Fired.

396
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:38,864
Do not show your face
at the laundry again.

397
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,992
Stay away from Pinkman.

398
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:45,287
Do not go near him.

399
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,414
Ever.

400
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,417
Are you listening to me?

401
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,465
Or else you'll do what?

402
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,427
What did you say?

403
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:03,263
Stay away from Pinkman...

404
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,143
or else you'll do

405
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,021
what?

406
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:13,356
Kill me?

407
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:18,486
If you could kill me...

408
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:23,533
I'd already be dead.

409
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,663
But you can't.

410
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,791
You can't kill me

411
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:37,631
because Jesse wouldn't cook for you
if you did.

412
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,552
That's it, isn't it?

413
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:51,478
No matter how hard you try

414
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:53,813
to turn him against me

415
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,316
to screw with his head,

416
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:59,486
so that he would hate my guts,

417
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:05,450
and he still won't let you do it.

418
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,120
For now.

419
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:11,289
But he'll come around.

420
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:16,252
In the meantime, there's the matter
of your brother-in-law.

421
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:21,508
He is a problem you promised to resolve.

422
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:23,510
You have failed.

423
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:28,056
Now it's left to me to deal with him.

424
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,891
You can't...

425
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,811
If you try to interfere...

426
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,524
this becomes a much simpler matter.

427
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:41,111
I will kill your wife.

428
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,530
I will kill your son.

429
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:48,159
I will kill your infant daughter.

430
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:41,671
Great. Perfect. You know, this is just...

431
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:46,134
I told her you were my A-team.

432
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:48,219
It was an act of God.

433
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,806
Ain't no accounting for no act of God.

434
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,892
Check is in the mail, at least.

435
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:55,727
"Hello, Mrs. White.

436
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:59,731
The good news is the IRS
has been paid off. The bad news is..."

437
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,900
Jesus!

438
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:04,110
Well, here goes nothing.

439
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:06,696
- Hey! Hey!
- Slow down.

440
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,281
- What the...?
- Saul.

441
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:11,701
- How did you hear?
- What? Hear what?

442
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,580
Guys, go, go, go. Scram.

443
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:18,291
- What the hell happened to you?
- Saul. Saul.

444
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,293
This man that we spoke of before.

445
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,379
This person that you said
could disappear me.

446
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,006
- Give me a new life.
- Yeah.

447
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:27,175
- Make sure I'm never found.
- Yeah.

448
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:30,386
Yeah, I need him, Saul.

449
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,680
Gus is gonna murder my whole family.

450
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:34,641
Christ.

451
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:37,477
I need this man now.

452
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,979
- Saul. Now, Saul!
- Yeah, yeah.

453
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:43,983
There's no coming back. You're gonna
get new Socials, new identities.

454
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:47,153
You can't contact your friends
or relatives ever again.

455
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,406
- All right. I understand.
- How are you gonna sell this

456
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:54,160
- to that wife of yours and your son?
- I have got no choice.

457
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:57,413
You're wanted by scary individuals,
not to mention the law.

458
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:01,126
You're high-risk. You'll need
the deluxe service. It'll cost you.

459
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,544
How much?

460
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,297
Last quote I got on the deluxe
was 125 grand.

461
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:09,091
But you got four people.
It'll be at least half a million.

462
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,594
- He accepts cash only.
- I've got the money.

463
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:13,096
- Please!
- Here.

464
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:14,681
Okay.

465
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:18,226
This is a vacuum cleaner repair company.

466
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:21,896
Did you expect Haji's Quick-Vanish?
I don't even know his name.

467
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,023
You just call and leave a message.

468
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:27,360
You tell them
that you need a new dust filter,

469
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:30,530
for a Hoover MaxExtract
Pressure Pro, Model 60.

470
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:33,241
I wrote it right on there.
He'll call you back.

471
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:36,369
Okay, fine. How long does it take
for him to arrange?

472
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:38,538
The guy works fast. That's the game.

473
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:42,500
You gotta have your family packed
and ready before you make the call.

474
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:46,087
He'll tell you where to meet,
he'll put you up in a safe house.

475
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:49,799
You gotta bring money. He doesn't
lift a finger unless he's paid.

476
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,342
Okay.

477
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,095
- Saul.
- Can't say it's been a pleasure...

478
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:56,598
I need you to do one more thing for me.

479
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,349
You need to call the DEA.

480
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,102
You need to tell them Gus
has a hit out on Hank.

481
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:04,189
- You have to do it for me.
- I gotta go on living here.

482
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,692
- I'm way too comfortable in my...
- Just call anonymously.

483
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,819
- You call anonymously!
- I can't!

484
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,863
I'm practically in the DEA family.

485
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,617
I go to their Christmas parties.
They know me. They know my voice.

486
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,369
They'll know me.
Please, you gotta do it for me.

487
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,872
- Please. Please.
- No.

488
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,500
My brother-in-law doesn't deserve
to die because of this.

489
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,045
There's no way I'm mentioning Gus.

490
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:30,006
- Okay.
- The most I'll go...

491
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:32,800
I'll say it's the cartel.
They're back to finish the job.

492
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:37,096
You say whatever you have to say.
You just give me an hour to...

493
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,558
I need to collect my wife and kids.
Okay?

494
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:45,355
Give me an hour and then you make
the phone call. Don't forget. Please.

495
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,273
Yeah.

496
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,318
Thank you, Saul.

497
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,312
No, no, no.

498
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,023
Where's the rest?

499
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:33,486
That's not enough.
That's not enough.

500
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,491
- Walt?
- Down here!

501
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:45,164
Walt, what did that phone call mean?

502
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,542
Where is it?

503
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:50,420
Where's the rest?

504
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:53,798
The money, Skyler.
Where is the rest?

505
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,677
Skyler, where is the money?

506
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,936
I gave it to Ted.

507
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:08,563
What?

508
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:13,151
- You did what?
- Walt, I had to.

509
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:14,944
For us, for the family.

510
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,779
I swear, Walt...

511
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:19,324
You gave our money to Beneke?

512
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:24,787
Walt, please.
Please just hear me out. Please.

513
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:34,922
Walt.

514
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,594
Walt.

515
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:47,310
Walt.

516
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:02,241
<i>Hi, you've reached the White family.
Please leave a message.</i>

517
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,369
<i>Skyler.</i>

518
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:07,038
It's happening again.

519
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:11,709
The DEA called, they got some tip
from an informant.

520
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:14,379
The cartel, they want to kill Hank.

521
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:17,423
<i>Oh, God.</i>

522
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:24,180
<i>They're sending agents
to our house right now to guard us.</i>

523
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,265
<i>Oh, God.</i>

524
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:29,394
<i>When is this going to end?</i>

525
00:45:32,105 --> 00:45:34,190
Marie, I'm here.

526
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:35,983
I'm here.

527
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,986
Tell me exactly what happened.
