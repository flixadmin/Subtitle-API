1
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,287
Lieutenant Carapax,

2
00:01:23,423 --> 00:01:24,952
tell me that
you've found the Scarab.

3
00:01:25,087 --> 00:01:28,228
-They're cutting into it now.
-Ah. That's exciting.

4
00:01:28,364 --> 00:01:29,790
I've had them working
around the clock

5
00:01:29,925 --> 00:01:31,825
since we unearthed it
about two weeks ago.

6
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:34,166
Good.
Let's keep this thing airtight

7
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,703
until we're ready
to show the board.

8
00:01:35,838 --> 00:01:38,202
Miss Kord. Miss Kord?

9
00:01:38,337 --> 00:01:40,568
-Oh, Dr. Sanchez, hello.
-Sorry.

10
00:01:40,704 --> 00:01:42,109
Hi. Actually,
that's not my name.

11
00:01:42,244 --> 00:01:44,308
How much longer you think
it's gonna be?

12
00:01:44,444 --> 00:01:46,641
We'll hit the center
before sunrise.

13
00:01:46,777 --> 00:01:48,849
Well,
push your men harder.

14
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,182
I've searched for 15 years.

15
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,114
I don't want
to wait another second.

16
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,480
Should've called
before making the trip out,
Miss Kord.

17
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:54,885
This could be another decoy.

18
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:56,454
It's in there.

19
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:00,121
I can feel it.

20
00:04:18,895 --> 00:04:20,895
All right.
Let's do this.

21
00:04:28,507 --> 00:04:30,836
Excuse me, sir? How do I look?

22
00:04:30,972 --> 00:04:33,039
Like you're six figures
in debt.

23
00:04:34,915 --> 00:04:35,910
Okay.

24
00:04:42,985 --> 00:04:44,752
We say nothing for now.

25
00:04:44,888 --> 00:04:47,222
Let's enjoy this moment.
Before he knows.

26
00:04:47,358 --> 00:04:48,289
I'll tell him.

27
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:51,458
What the hell? Why not?

28
00:04:51,593 --> 00:04:52,425
Even good news...

29
00:04:56,164 --> 00:04:57,837
And this is pretty bad news.

30
00:04:57,972 --> 00:04:59,535
I can be joyful.

31
00:04:59,671 --> 00:05:01,636
Your job
is the balloon.

32
00:05:01,771 --> 00:05:03,106
Hope I can handle it.

33
00:05:03,241 --> 00:05:04,475
Handle what?

34
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:06,477
Hey, hey, hey!

35
00:05:06,613 --> 00:05:09,282
The graduate is here!

36
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:10,744
- How was your flight?
- Good.

37
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,985
-Are you hungry?
-Of course.

38
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:14,850
Here. It's all they had.

39
00:05:14,985 --> 00:05:17,018
- Welcome back, bro.
- Thank you.

40
00:05:17,154 --> 00:05:19,921
Nana!

41
00:05:24,297 --> 00:05:25,463
Now we hug!

42
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,100
Hey,
where's Uncle Rudy?

43
00:05:46,783 --> 00:05:49,050
Welcome back,
<i> pinche</i> college boy.

44
00:05:49,185 --> 00:05:51,155
Hey! Come on. Get out the car
and give me a hug.

45
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,724
No. No hugs, man.

46
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,986
They got<i> Big Brother</i> watching.
There's cameras.

47
00:05:54,122 --> 00:05:55,727
I knew you were gonna
say something.

48
00:05:55,862 --> 00:05:56,989
Facial recognition.
Body imaging scanners.

49
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,163
Yeah,
and they're all so happy

50
00:05:58,298 --> 00:05:59,598
to finally catch you.

51
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:00,827
You see? It's that kind
of talk right there

52
00:06:00,962 --> 00:06:02,134
that's gonna get us all busted.

53
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:03,402
Where'd you get this?

54
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:05,034
I bought it
for Jaime.

55
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,667
A boy? We know it's a boy.
There's probably a bug in here.

56
00:06:06,802 --> 00:06:08,205
Come on. What are you doing?

57
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:24,286
Oh, my God!
I missed this so much.

58
00:06:25,858 --> 00:06:27,890
Good to know
some things don't change.

59
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:31,659
Mom and Dad
have something to tell you.

60
00:06:31,795 --> 00:06:33,293
- Milagro.
- What?

61
00:06:33,429 --> 00:06:36,465
Okay, he's had his tacos,
now let him have the truth.

62
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,337
The truth? What is it?

63
00:06:39,472 --> 00:06:40,567
- We...
- We...

64
00:06:40,703 --> 00:06:41,569
We're losing the house.

65
00:06:41,704 --> 00:06:43,369
What?

66
00:06:43,505 --> 00:06:45,075
See?

67
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,644
-He didn't take it that bad.
-No, no, no, losing the house?

68
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,275
What does she mean,
losing the house?

69
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:49,845
-The landlord tripled the rent.
-They gave us three months

70
00:06:49,981 --> 00:06:51,381
to come up with the money
or get out.

71
00:06:51,517 --> 00:06:53,147
I am so sorry,<i> flaquito.</i>

72
00:06:53,282 --> 00:06:56,456
No.<i> Ama,</i> don't be sorry.
It's not your fault.

73
00:06:56,592 --> 00:06:58,556
It just means that
we're gonna have to

74
00:06:58,692 --> 00:06:59,751
bust our ass
at the shop, right?

75
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:02,693
Mmm... auto shop's gone.

76
00:07:02,828 --> 00:07:04,730
-How?
-You can thank Kord for that.

77
00:07:04,865 --> 00:07:06,695
- Brother.
- We couldn't keep up.

78
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:09,167
Especially since
your dad, he...

79
00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:11,065
He, uh... had a...

80
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,466
- He...
- Dad had a heart attack.

81
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:14,468
What?

82
00:07:14,603 --> 00:07:15,876
I'm fine!

83
00:07:19,312 --> 00:07:21,544
At least the food's the same.

84
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,208
Wait, why didn't you tell me?

85
00:07:23,344 --> 00:07:25,750
You were working so hard,
<i> mi amor.</i>

86
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:28,288
We didn't want
to distract you from school.

87
00:07:28,424 --> 00:07:30,287
Ma, I could have
done something.

88
00:07:30,423 --> 00:07:31,622
I could have come back.

89
00:07:31,757 --> 00:07:33,819
I could have been here.
I could have--

90
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:35,087
<i> Animo,</i> Jaime.

91
00:07:35,223 --> 00:07:37,994
We figured it out.
We always do.

92
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:41,528
We have a lot
to be grateful for.<i> Mira...</i>

93
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,207
Yeah. And the last!

94
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:49,134
Yes, because you didn't apply.

95
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,575
What,
so I can get into debt

96
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,078
for the rest of my life?
No thanks.

97
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:58,177
What? 25%?

98
00:07:58,313 --> 00:08:01,614
<i> Mi amor,</i>
these people make nothing.

99
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,084
We are broke.

100
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,218
Let's worry
about money tomorrow.

101
00:08:19,005 --> 00:08:21,505
<i> Remember</i>
<i> how Mom taught us salsa</i>

102
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,972
<i>right there on the front porch?</i>

103
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:24,911
<i> You were always</i>
<i> better than me.</i>

104
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:26,338
<i> Yeah.
</i> <i> No, I still think</i> <i> you don't know</i>

105
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:28,210
<i>how to dance salsa.</i>

106
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:29,643
<i> Yeah, I got</i>
<i> two left feet. I can't help it.</i>

107
00:08:29,778 --> 00:08:31,046
<i> Yeah.</i>

108
00:08:31,181 --> 00:08:33,247
<i> Do you remember</i>
<i> your 21st birthday?</i>

109
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:35,955
<i> I remember the first half.</i>

110
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,554
<i> I can't believe</i>
<i> we're losing this place.</i>

111
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,386
<i> It was rough.</i>

112
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:41,987
<i> Yeah, well,</i>
<i> I'm not leaving again.</i>

113
00:08:43,859 --> 00:08:45,861
What about grad school?

114
00:08:45,997 --> 00:08:48,028
Well, that's not gonna
help the family.

115
00:08:48,164 --> 00:08:50,164
I can't get us
into even more debt.

116
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:52,836
<i> Animo,</i> bro.

117
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:55,371
Okay, you always land
on your feet.

118
00:08:55,506 --> 00:08:57,039
You're "Jaime."

119
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,672
Thank you, but...

120
00:08:59,808 --> 00:09:04,284
This wasn't how
it was supposed to happen,
Mili.

121
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,879
What was supposed to happen?

122
00:09:06,015 --> 00:09:08,083
I was supposed to make it out.

123
00:09:08,218 --> 00:09:10,017
I was supposed to get all of us
out of here.

124
00:09:10,153 --> 00:09:12,725
Thanks, bro,
but I like the Keys.

125
00:09:14,727 --> 00:09:17,323
-You know what I meant.
-Yeah.

126
00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:21,097
Doesn't it bother you

127
00:09:21,232 --> 00:09:22,702
that they talk about progress
and get everything

128
00:09:22,837 --> 00:09:24,330
while we have to sit here
and go broke?

129
00:09:24,465 --> 00:09:27,769
You're a Mexican
in Edge Keys,<i> carnal.</i>

130
00:09:27,904 --> 00:09:30,338
That progress is not for us.

131
00:09:30,474 --> 00:09:33,042
Okay? The poor go over here
and the rich go over there,

132
00:09:33,177 --> 00:09:35,880
until the rich want to be here
and push us out.

133
00:09:36,016 --> 00:09:37,416
We used to have the other side
of the tracks

134
00:09:37,551 --> 00:09:38,813
and now they want that, too.

135
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:40,819
I still have a degree, right?

136
00:09:40,954 --> 00:09:43,721
That's gotta mean something.
I'll get a job.

137
00:09:43,857 --> 00:09:47,156
Not just any job,
but a prime job.

138
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:49,289
Yeah, I'm gonna get the money
to save this place.

139
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,294
Don't look at me at like that.
Look, Mili, I'm telling you,

140
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:56,703
in five years,
we're gonna be rolling in it.

141
00:09:56,838 --> 00:09:58,232
This is just gonna be
one of our houses.

142
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:00,365
We're gonna have the mansion
on the water

143
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:03,710
with the marble everywhere,
infinity pool.

144
00:10:04,511 --> 00:10:07,373
Yeah, just watch, Mili.

145
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:10,717
Just watch.

146
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:35,038
Excuse me, Mister Reyes?

147
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,144
You finish scraping the gum
off that lounger or what?

148
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:44,911
This is bullshit.

149
00:10:45,046 --> 00:10:47,081
Wow. "Thanks, Milagro,

150
00:10:47,216 --> 00:10:49,222
for hooking me up
with this gig."

151
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,922
It's not my fault your future
didn't turn out
the way you wanted.

152
00:10:53,058 --> 00:10:54,187
How am I supposed to
get experience

153
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:55,758
when nobody's gonna
give me a job?

154
00:10:55,893 --> 00:10:57,390
Sounds like a "you" problem.

155
00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:01,768
Seriously?

156
00:11:01,903 --> 00:11:03,803
What? I'm keeping us employed,
you noob!

157
00:11:03,938 --> 00:11:05,364
Yes, yes,
we've finally found it.

158
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,368
Doctor Sanchez
is running tests on it now.

159
00:11:07,503 --> 00:11:09,372
-With the actual code
in hand...
-Hey.

160
00:11:09,507 --> 00:11:11,639
-...we can move
beyond the prototype phase.
-Check it out.

161
00:11:11,774 --> 00:11:12,939
Yes, yes.

162
00:11:13,075 --> 00:11:14,848
There goes Victoria Kord.

163
00:11:14,983 --> 00:11:16,709
Look at that walk.

164
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:20,849
She's kinda sexy in like a...
Cruella Kardashian sorta way.

165
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:22,083
I don't think so.

166
00:11:22,218 --> 00:11:23,422
-I'm gonna say hi.
-What? No--

167
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:24,852
Good afternoon, ma'am.

168
00:11:24,987 --> 00:11:26,752
If you want, we could.

169
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,895
It's the breakthrough we've
been working towards, General.

170
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:32,062
Mm-hm.

171
00:11:32,197 --> 00:11:34,367
We're invisible
to people like that, Jaime.

172
00:11:34,503 --> 00:11:36,500
It's like our superpower.

173
00:11:36,636 --> 00:11:38,336
Okay. Back to work.

174
00:11:38,472 --> 00:11:41,774
I agree. That's a waste
of time, but General,
I am telling you

175
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,837
what I'm gonna show
you tomorrow night

176
00:11:43,973 --> 00:11:45,906
is gonna blow you away.

177
00:11:46,042 --> 00:11:48,441
Yes. I look forward, also.

178
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,448
Bye.

179
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,152
Aunt Vicki?

180
00:11:56,188 --> 00:11:58,854
Jennifer,
what are you doing here?

181
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,385
I didn't know you were coming.

182
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:02,495
Oh, Carapax,
this is Ted's daughter.

183
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,195
My favorite niece, Jennifer.

184
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,803
So, to what do I owe
this unexpected pleasure?

185
00:12:12,369 --> 00:12:14,436
<i> The world has changed.</i>

186
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:17,978

188
00:12:22,644 --> 00:12:25,218

<i> the "One Man Army Corps."</i>

192
00:12:38,995 --> 00:12:40,362
Where are we going?

193
00:12:40,497 --> 00:12:42,901
Gotta take a shit, bro.
Need you to be a lookout.

194
00:12:43,037 --> 00:12:44,664
Wait, but the service restrooms
are out there.

195
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,670
Yeah, and I deserve a luxury
dump right now, all right?

196
00:12:50,874 --> 00:12:52,573
I...

<i> The O.M.A.C.</i>

204
00:13:19,106 --> 00:13:20,601
Think it works pretty well,
don't you?

205
00:13:20,737 --> 00:13:25,611
So, this... project
was shut down years ago.

206
00:13:25,746 --> 00:13:27,545
Why have you relaunched it?

207
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,582
Jennifer,
the O.M.A.C.
is the future of this company.

208
00:13:30,718 --> 00:13:32,250
You should be so excited.

209
00:13:32,386 --> 00:13:36,854
No, no, no. I really want
to know what's at Pago Island?

210
00:13:36,989 --> 00:13:38,918
-That's classified.
-Mm.

211
00:13:39,054 --> 00:13:40,322
It's a secret.

212
00:13:40,457 --> 00:13:41,926
But I'll tell you,
what isn't classified

213
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:43,730
is what's gonna go on
at this party.

214
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,193
It's gonna be
an amazing evening

215
00:13:45,328 --> 00:13:46,791
with some
very interesting people,

216
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:49,766
so if you wanna come,
bring someone and it'll be fun.

217
00:13:49,902 --> 00:13:50,895
All right, see you later.

218
00:13:52,534 --> 00:13:54,871
I know what
you're doing, Vicki.

219
00:13:55,007 --> 00:13:56,772
We don't make weapons anymore.

220
00:13:56,907 --> 00:13:58,945
Whoa, whoa, "we"?

221
00:13:59,645 --> 00:14:01,608
Who's "we"?

222
00:14:01,744 --> 00:14:04,278
You are nothing
to this company.
You're an expense.

223
00:14:04,414 --> 00:14:06,745
A brat in her daddy's
board seat,

224
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:10,156
jet-setting around the world
on the company's dime,

225
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,557
-doing your "charity work."
-My father would never--

226
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:16,224
Look, your father was handed
a company I built...
my company.

227
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:18,329
Which he then proceeded
to almost sink

228
00:14:18,465 --> 00:14:21,894
with his moronic inventions
and his reckless management,

229
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,503
and then after he'd
done all that,
you know what he did?

230
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,805
He just disappeared,

231
00:14:25,941 --> 00:14:28,269
and left me
to pick up the pieces.

232
00:14:28,405 --> 00:14:31,109
Your father
abandoned this company.

233
00:14:32,713 --> 00:14:34,040
And he abandoned you.

234
00:14:34,176 --> 00:14:36,312
I won't let you do this.

235
00:14:39,084 --> 00:14:42,619
Don't get in my way, Jennifer.

236
00:14:42,754 --> 00:14:44,353
Back away.

237
00:14:44,488 --> 00:14:46,551
I'm not afraid of you.

238
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:48,827
Maybe you should be.

239
00:14:48,963 --> 00:14:51,096
Hey, hey!

240
00:14:52,265 --> 00:14:55,465
Uh, sh... she said
to back away, ma'am.

241
00:14:58,033 --> 00:14:59,735
Oooh-whee!

242
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,107
That was lavish!

243
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:03,873
Oh, shit.

244
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:08,608
And who are you, handsome?

245
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:11,051
Jaime Reyes.

246
00:15:11,186 --> 00:15:15,051
I think it's time to find
a new job, Jaime Reyes.

247
00:15:15,186 --> 00:15:18,390
-I'm...
-You, too, toilet. Go.

248
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:19,652
<i> Andale.</i>

249
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:23,359
Thanks.

250
00:15:25,227 --> 00:15:26,599
Where's the car?

251
00:15:26,735 --> 00:15:28,331
Uh, 47 minutes.

252
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:33,133
Hey, are you okay? That was--

253
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:34,908
I appreciate the chivalry,

254
00:15:35,043 --> 00:15:36,537
but I can take care
of myself, okay?

255
00:15:36,672 --> 00:15:41,012
Totally. But I mean...
what a dick, right?

256
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,075
She's a Kord.
They're all dicks.

257
00:15:44,882 --> 00:15:46,217
Jenny Kord.

258
00:15:47,953 --> 00:15:49,383
We're not all dicks.

259
00:15:49,518 --> 00:15:52,157
- Obviously. Yeah. Uh...
- Uh...

260
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:55,593
Look I'm...
I'm really sorry about this.

261
00:15:55,728 --> 00:15:57,097
It's fine.

262
00:15:57,232 --> 00:15:58,695
Give me your phone.
Let me give you my number.

263
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,361
Okay. Yeah.

264
00:16:00,497 --> 00:16:02,665
Yeah. Come by
Kord Tower tomorrow.

265
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,536
Okay.

266
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,532
I might be able to get you
a job somewhere else
in our company.

267
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:08,337
Yes. Oh, my gosh.
That'd be great.

268
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:10,806
I'll do anything. Really.

269
00:16:10,942 --> 00:16:12,670
Anything, huh?

270
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,945
Hey, you know
he has a degree, right?

271
00:16:15,081 --> 00:16:16,642
-Pre-law.
-I... Yeah.

272
00:16:16,778 --> 00:16:18,780
You guys need any pre-lawyers?

273
00:16:18,915 --> 00:16:19,948
Okay.

274
00:16:20,084 --> 00:16:22,084
-Text me.
-Okay.

275
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,619
Nice meeting you, Jaime Reyes.

276
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,426
Nice to meet you, too...

277
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,930
Jenny Kord.

278
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:34,999
I think she might be into you.

279
00:16:35,134 --> 00:16:37,037
What? No.

280
00:16:37,606 --> 00:16:39,267
Bye.

281
00:16:39,402 --> 00:16:41,866
-You think?
-Yeah. Yeah.

282
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:45,440
She took one look
at your young Mexican-ass,

283
00:16:45,575 --> 00:16:48,812
hero-of-the-moment vibe
and was into it.

284
00:16:48,948 --> 00:16:50,114
Hey, you know what?

285
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,446
Maybe she'll pull you
out of poverty

286
00:16:51,581 --> 00:16:53,051
-like<i> Maria la del Barrio.</i>
-Okay.

287
00:16:53,187 --> 00:16:54,852
Except, she's
the rich white dude

288
00:16:54,987 --> 00:16:56,514
and you're the Maria!

289
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,690
Yeah. Okay.

290
00:18:01,317 --> 00:18:02,518
You drinking?

291
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,158
-Just one.
-Okay.

292
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:08,557
Don't tell your mother.

293
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:12,594
Can't sleep?

294
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:14,666
No.

295
00:18:16,198 --> 00:18:17,731
Yeah.

296
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:22,071
I planted those<i> nopales</i> with
<i> la</i> Nana,

297
00:18:22,206 --> 00:18:23,440
when you were a baby.

298
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,411
Look at them now.

299
00:18:26,546 --> 00:18:30,381
Like you and<i> la</i> Mili,
grown and beautiful.

300
00:18:33,215 --> 00:18:34,583
You okay?

301
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:36,453
Yeah.

302
00:18:37,953 --> 00:18:39,584
Sorry,<i> Apa,</i> it's just
everything right now

303
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,524
feels so out of reach, and...

304
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:46,458
I feel like I failed you guys.

305
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:53,965
We're on a journey, Jaime...

306
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:58,138
This house, the<i> nopales,</i>
<i> el</i> auto shop.

307
00:18:58,273 --> 00:19:00,343
Everything.

308
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,543
They're just a stop
in the journey.

309
00:19:03,678 --> 00:19:06,080
But this isn't the destination.

310
00:19:06,215 --> 00:19:07,620
And what is it?

311
00:19:07,756 --> 00:19:09,147
I don't know.

312
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:13,292
What's important is that
we go on this journey together.

313
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,589
Things don't last.

314
00:19:16,725 --> 00:19:19,896
<i> La familia,</i> that's forever.

315
00:19:20,031 --> 00:19:21,531
That lasts.

316
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:31,009
Everyone has a purpose.

317
00:19:31,145 --> 00:19:33,506
You just haven't found yours.

318
00:19:33,641 --> 00:19:35,479
So what's your purpose then?

319
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:39,879

But do not open it.

00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,491

was a hamburger?

Okay, I don't think
it's a burger.

I don't know.

404
00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:49,617

to not open it, so please--

to not open it, bro.

-I'm gonna get my drill.
-Wait, wait!

414

00:35:25,825 --> 00:35:27,965
-Cut what?
-...and flew into orbit.

No, no. Don't call the police.
No police.
They work for Kord.

00:35:37,707 --> 00:35:39,475
when they figure out
that some Mexican kid

has that type of military tech
inside of him?

578
00:35:43,413 --> 00:35:44,643
They're gonna lock his ass up.

579
00:35:44,779 --> 00:35:46,544
And then they're gonna
wipe our minds,

580
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,911
so that we don't tell anybody.

581
00:35:48,047 --> 00:35:49,351
And it's not like
the government isn't

582
00:35:49,486 --> 00:35:50,750
used to locking up
Mexicans anyway.

583
00:35:50,885 --> 00:35:53,292
I mean, this is sci-fi shit.
This is CIA.

-This is Area 51!
-Rudy, focus. What do you mean?

585
00:35:57,925 --> 00:36:00,624
What I'm saying
is the government and Kord

586
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:02,367
are gonna be all over this,

587
00:36:02,502 --> 00:36:04,062
and then they're gonna
start asking for documents.

588
00:36:04,198 --> 00:36:07,769
And that includes you, Nana.
And that includes you, Alberto.

589
00:36:07,905 --> 00:36:10,206
Okay, then fine. I'm just gonna
have to go by myself then.

-Stalked her Insta.
-Where'd I put my...

597

She's Brazilian,
she lives at the Regent Tower.

And she's single, by the way.

599

00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:49,334
I went swimming out there

643
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,832
by where your family
has that company.

644
00:38:50,967 --> 00:38:53,402
My testicles are seven times
their normal size.

645
00:38:53,537 --> 00:38:55,606
Shouldn't you be
pillaging cobalt

646
00:38:55,741 --> 00:38:58,476
from some developing country
or something, Jenny?

647
00:38:59,443 --> 00:39:01,444
-Where is it?
-Yeah.

648
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:04,046
Allow me.

649
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:05,349
Rudy! What?

650
00:39:05,485 --> 00:39:07,314
- What are you doing?
- Rudy!

651
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,353
I thought the<i> chingaderas</i>
would come out.

652
00:39:12,489 --> 00:39:13,888
-Come out?
-Jeez.

653
00:39:14,023 --> 00:39:15,786
-What is he talking about?
-He's talking about this.

654
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,831
Oh, I forgot
how bad it looks.

655
00:39:21,194 --> 00:39:22,064
No, it doesn't look that bad.

656
00:39:23,303 --> 00:39:24,532
I've seen worse.

657
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:26,304
-Where?
-You don't wanna know.

658
00:39:26,439 --> 00:39:28,206
Okay, what the hell
is this thing?

659
00:39:28,341 --> 00:39:30,001
It's... it's called the Scarab.

660
00:39:30,137 --> 00:39:32,906
It was given to my dad
when I was a kid, um...

661
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:35,407
It's some kind
of a world destroying weapon.

662
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:36,774
Oh, that's nice.

663
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,247
-Weapon?
-What did she say?

664
00:39:38,382 --> 00:39:40,585
What?

665
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,653
And did you know what was
gonna happen to my brother

666
00:39:42,788 --> 00:39:45,218
when you stuck him with
this world destroying thing?

667
00:39:45,354 --> 00:39:47,485
No, I swear to you,
I had no idea
this would happen.

668
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,155
I mean, come on.

669
00:39:49,291 --> 00:39:51,227
My father said it can't be
activated by just any person.

670
00:39:51,362 --> 00:39:52,794
It has to choose you.

671
00:39:53,895 --> 00:39:56,563
So I'm guessing
it's chosen you.

672
00:39:56,698 --> 00:39:57,963
No more blind dates.

673
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:01,372
Okay. So, how do we get it
to un-choose me?

674
00:40:01,508 --> 00:40:03,774
I don't know.
But we better move fast,

675
00:40:03,909 --> 00:40:06,003
because my aunt
will kill us all
just to get it back.

676
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:07,477
Kill us?

677
00:40:07,612 --> 00:40:08,809
No, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

678
00:40:08,944 --> 00:40:10,340
She's the one who sent
the assassins.

679
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:12,411
Yeah.

680
00:40:16,088 --> 00:40:18,015
I'm so sorry I put you all
in this situation.

681
00:40:18,151 --> 00:40:20,388
I had no idea
it would activate.

682
00:40:20,523 --> 00:40:21,756
Really. I didn't know.

683
00:40:21,892 --> 00:40:23,625
That's convenient.

684
00:40:23,761 --> 00:40:25,024
But she already said
she didn't know.

685
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:27,264
She's a Kord, dude.
You seriously trust her?

686
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,335
We are going to figure it out.
We always do.

687
00:40:33,471 --> 00:40:36,472
Come on, we are the Reyes.

688
00:40:36,607 --> 00:40:38,773
We've dealt with harder things.

689
00:40:38,909 --> 00:40:41,139
We have?

690
00:40:42,513 --> 00:40:45,313
<i> Animo.</i> We can do this.

691
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:48,986
Yeah. Yeah,<i> Apa.</i>

692
00:40:49,121 --> 00:40:50,281
He's right.

693
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:54,958
Okay, so, how are we gonna
get this thing outta me?

694
00:40:55,094 --> 00:40:57,593
You know, before it
busts another hole
in our house.

695
00:40:57,729 --> 00:40:59,663
Exactly.

696
00:40:59,798 --> 00:41:02,732
There's a place where
we can get some answers.

697
00:41:03,863 --> 00:41:04,828
But we need the key.

698
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:07,600
Okay, so where's the key?

699
00:41:07,735 --> 00:41:09,469
At the Kord building.

700
00:41:09,604 --> 00:41:11,876
And they're probably
on high alert over there
since I took the Scarab.

701
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:15,542
So, what are we talking about?
Laser-based security system?

702
00:41:15,678 --> 00:41:17,348
Wide area motion imagery?

703
00:41:17,483 --> 00:41:19,782
Maybe, uh... photonic emitters?

704
00:41:20,746 --> 00:41:22,582
I really don't--

705
00:41:22,717 --> 00:41:25,255
Because I've been
working on something
that I believe can help us.

706
00:41:25,391 --> 00:41:27,889
And it's almost finished.

707
00:41:28,024 --> 00:41:29,720
If I can get
the mechanical structure right.

708
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,820
Mm. I love you, Ma.

709
00:41:30,956 --> 00:41:32,791
Give me a couple hours.

710
00:42:03,295 --> 00:42:05,262
You're aware that
if you deliver the O.M.A.C.,

711
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:06,563
you'd be the most powerful

712
00:42:06,699 --> 00:42:08,228
weapons manufacturer
in the world.

713
00:42:08,364 --> 00:42:10,402
If you buy into this, you can
call me whatever you want.

714
00:42:10,537 --> 00:42:12,597
Oh, if it isn't
the devil himself.

715
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:15,939
General,
this is Lieutenant Carapax.

716
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,907
He's been crucial to the
development of the prototype,

717
00:42:19,042 --> 00:42:21,905
and I personally handpicked him
for his courage

718
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:23,714
during the anti-communist

719
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:27,278
counter-terrorism operations
in Guatemala.

720
00:42:27,414 --> 00:42:29,753
He's the perfect recipient
for the O.M.A.C.,

721
00:42:29,889 --> 00:42:31,751
and a product of the school
of the Americas.

722
00:42:31,887 --> 00:42:33,355
Great to meet you, Lieutenant.

723
00:42:34,826 --> 00:42:38,125
Well, can't wait to see it
in action.

724
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,291
-When will it be ready?
-Oh, it's ready, isn't it?

725
00:42:40,427 --> 00:42:43,829
We're just putting some
finishing touches on it.

726
00:42:43,964 --> 00:42:45,533
We have a problem.

727
00:42:45,669 --> 00:42:47,397
Well, if you'll excuse us.

728
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:51,302
Have a cigar,
they're made by real Cubans.

729
00:42:52,809 --> 00:42:55,743
You lost her? How?

730
00:42:55,878 --> 00:42:57,409
My men saw someone helping her.

731
00:42:57,545 --> 00:43:00,281
All right. I wanna find out
who she is working with now.

732
00:43:00,416 --> 00:43:03,787
Because without the Scarab,
we can't complete the O.M.A.C.

733
00:43:03,922 --> 00:43:07,217
I'm on it.
I will bring the Scarab back.

734
00:43:07,353 --> 00:43:09,056
This time
I'll do it personally.

735
00:43:09,191 --> 00:43:11,861
Well, I would hope so,
Carapax, because if not,

736
00:43:11,996 --> 00:43:14,462
all your sacrifices
will have been in vain.

737
00:43:14,597 --> 00:43:18,196
Just think of how much
suffering your body
has been through.

738
00:43:18,331 --> 00:43:20,735
I'm aware
of what you've done to it.

739
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:24,473
My God... What<i> we've</i> done.

740
00:43:24,609 --> 00:43:29,573
Ignacio, I'm on your side.

741
00:43:29,709 --> 00:43:33,179
Do you not remember what
it was like when I found you?

742
00:43:34,113 --> 00:43:36,655
How badly crippled you were?

743
00:43:37,421 --> 00:43:38,954
How broken?

744
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,259
I am just trying to fix you.

745
00:43:44,394 --> 00:43:45,697
Okay?

746
00:43:48,695 --> 00:43:49,698
Good.

747
00:43:49,833 --> 00:43:51,769
I have to go back to the party.

748
00:43:53,704 --> 00:43:55,740
Now, go get me that Scarab.

749
00:44:05,416 --> 00:44:06,911
That's it?

750
00:44:07,046 --> 00:44:10,084
I call it,<i> El Chapulin.</i>

751
00:44:11,322 --> 00:44:13,054
Why?

752
00:44:13,189 --> 00:44:14,923
You know,
when you make something cool,

753
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:17,362
you can call yours
whatever you want, okay?

754
00:44:17,497 --> 00:44:20,193
Here, be useful. Hold that.

755
00:44:20,328 --> 00:44:21,799
You're sure
that this one works?

756
00:44:22,499 --> 00:44:24,001
Thank you. Yes.

757
00:44:24,137 --> 00:44:27,902
Unlike the junk
that Kord makes,
my tech delivers.

758
00:44:28,038 --> 00:44:29,534
Okay. You could have
just said yes.

759
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,369
Okay, cupcake, you wanna
hit that yellow switch there?

760
00:44:31,504 --> 00:44:32,907
Hit the yellow switch.

761
00:44:33,042 --> 00:44:34,906
I just did.

762
00:44:37,581 --> 00:44:39,149
Okay.

763
00:44:39,284 --> 00:44:40,845
Well, at least I don't have to
open that annoying tailgate.

764
00:44:40,981 --> 00:44:42,553
It's going on your tab.

765
00:44:42,689 --> 00:44:44,653
So just give me,
like, one step.

766
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:45,717
Just gotta give it a little...

767
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:51,388
- Oh, that's sexy.
- Great.

768
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:53,930
That's... that's great.
Uh, so it works.

769
00:44:54,065 --> 00:44:57,160
Uh, yeah, it works.

770
00:44:57,295 --> 00:44:58,865
I'll keep the truck running.

771
00:44:59,001 --> 00:45:00,068
- Let's go.
- Wow.

772
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:04,039
"So it works?"

773
00:45:06,905 --> 00:45:08,208
Guys!

774
00:45:09,845 --> 00:45:10,943
Something's happening.

775
00:45:16,456 --> 00:45:17,954
What the hell is this?

776
00:45:20,686 --> 00:45:22,752
<i> El Chapulin Colorado!</i>

777
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,326
<i> So join me and my little pals</i>

778
00:45:27,461 --> 00:45:28,926
<i> and all of our Kord</i>
<i> subsidiaries...</i>

779
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:30,562
The key's here.

780
00:45:30,698 --> 00:45:34,898
<i> ...around the globe,</i>
<i> to build a better future.</i>

781
00:45:35,034 --> 00:45:37,138
<i> A Kord future.</i>

782
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,574
She seemed so different
back then.

783
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:45,575
Vicki and my grandfather
started Kord Industries
together...

784
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:48,685
and turned it
into a military powerhouse.

785
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:51,515
Then, when my grandfather died,

786
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:55,090
Victoria thought the company
would go to her.

787
00:45:55,225 --> 00:45:58,060
But he left everything
to my dad instead.

788
00:45:58,796 --> 00:46:00,463
-Seems kind of--
-Sexist?

789
00:46:00,598 --> 00:46:01,759
Yeah.

790
00:46:01,894 --> 00:46:03,461
Yeah.

791
00:46:03,596 --> 00:46:06,030
Still, my father wanted
to steer the company

792
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:07,932
in a different direction.

793
00:46:08,067 --> 00:46:11,810
So, Victoria became
obsessed with erasing
my father's legacy.

794
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,110
Could I get a hand over here?

795
00:46:16,012 --> 00:46:17,778
Yeah, sorry. What do you need?

796
00:46:17,914 --> 00:46:19,850
-Just hold this.
-Okay.

797
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,715
There's a signal blocking
our feed.

798
00:46:21,851 --> 00:46:22,983
We're being jammed out.

799
00:46:26,553 --> 00:46:29,553
Lieutenant Carapax?

My dad was never able
to unlock the Scarab.

So instead, he built his own

00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:46,708
And they're comfy, too, so...

961
00:56:49,211 --> 00:56:50,981
Good.

962
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:53,984
It must have been
so cool growing up
in a place like this, no?

963
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,584
Honestly, it was...

964
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,082
it was pretty lonely
most of the time.

965
00:56:59,284 --> 00:57:00,924
It was just
you three in here?

966
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,018
Yeah.

967
00:57:02,154 --> 00:57:03,956
That was my mother's
last painting.

968
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:06,163
Why'd she stop?

969
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:08,158
My mom died when I was six.

970
00:57:10,201 --> 00:57:12,328
Oh... We don't...

971
00:57:12,463 --> 00:57:14,300
-I'm so sorry to...
-It's okay. No, it's okay.

972
00:57:14,435 --> 00:57:15,638
It's fine.

973
00:57:17,505 --> 00:57:18,707
What was she like?

974
00:57:20,046 --> 00:57:21,611
She was great.

975
00:57:23,643 --> 00:57:24,607
She was great.

976
00:57:27,979 --> 00:57:30,180
She changed my dad's life.

977
00:57:30,316 --> 00:57:32,419
She was the one who taught him
that the world

978
00:57:32,554 --> 00:57:33,923
is a place to protect.

979
00:57:34,058 --> 00:57:35,053
Nice.

980
00:57:37,059 --> 00:57:41,125
But when my mom died, he...
he really went adrift.

981
00:57:44,765 --> 00:57:47,063
He obsessed over the Scarab

982
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:49,507
and he would disappear
for days.

983
00:57:51,208 --> 00:57:52,873
Sometimes weeks.

984
00:57:53,706 --> 00:57:55,172
And one day, he...

985
00:57:56,808 --> 00:57:58,274
he left and...

986
00:58:00,218 --> 00:58:01,618
didn't come back.

987
00:58:02,716 --> 00:58:04,280
I'm so sorry, Jenny.

988
00:58:08,623 --> 00:58:11,055
You're really lucky.

989
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:15,533
This house is...
it's full of stuff.

990
00:58:16,401 --> 00:58:18,833
Your house is full of love.

991
00:58:21,736 --> 00:58:23,068
A family.

992
00:58:24,977 --> 00:58:26,108
Yeah.

993
00:58:26,244 --> 00:58:27,611
That's a home.

994
00:58:31,646 --> 00:58:34,415
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

995
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:36,150
Sorry for... for what?

996
00:58:36,286 --> 00:58:40,184
I... I haven't
talked about this
in a very long time.

997
00:58:42,056 --> 00:58:44,188
Kinda feels nice to,
maybe, right?

998
00:58:46,329 --> 00:58:47,697
Thank you.

999
00:58:48,132 --> 00:58:49,396
Yeah.

1000
00:58:49,532 --> 00:58:51,063
You're a good listener.

1001
00:58:52,803 --> 00:58:54,830
My mom says it's 'cause
I got big ears.

1002
00:59:03,012 --> 00:59:04,140
Hey, guys,
I found something that-- Ho!

1003
00:59:04,276 --> 00:59:06,584
-Nothing happened.
-Her mom died.

1004
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:08,914
I found something you guys
need to look at.

1005
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:12,656
Uh, great.
That's great. Let's go.

1006
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,692
Nice jammies,<i> guey.</i>

1007
00:59:20,064 --> 00:59:23,493
Okay.
I've gone through the files.

1008
00:59:23,629 --> 00:59:27,503
So... Ted had a professor,
this guy named Dan Garrett.

1009
00:59:27,638 --> 00:59:29,801
The Scarab chose
this Garrett guy

1010
00:59:29,936 --> 00:59:31,434
before it chose you, Jaime.

1011
00:59:31,569 --> 00:59:34,403
And<i> pinche</i> Ted,
ran tests on him to map out

1012
00:59:34,539 --> 00:59:37,208
how the Scarab would react
to the human body.

1013
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:39,743
So, once this Scarab
goes up someone's ass...

1014
00:59:39,879 --> 00:59:41,518
It didn't go up my ass.

1015
00:59:41,654 --> 00:59:43,517
Okay. Well, it connects
to the brain

1016
00:59:43,652 --> 00:59:46,590
and that's what it's trying
to do to you, Jaime,
connect to your brain.

1017
00:59:46,725 --> 00:59:48,419
It's trying to become one
with you.

1018
00:59:48,555 --> 00:59:49,658
Why?

1019
00:59:49,793 --> 00:59:50,923
I think you should
ask it yourself.

1020
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:52,658
I mean, this thing
has its own will.

1021
00:59:52,793 --> 00:59:53,759
It's sentient.

1022
00:59:53,895 --> 00:59:55,793
That's why it chooses a host.

1023
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:58,767
That's why sometimes,
it does what you want,
and sometimes, it doesn't.

1024
00:59:58,903 --> 01:00:00,562
Okay, well, who made it?
Can they help us?

1025
01:00:00,698 --> 01:00:02,867
This wasn't made
on Earth,<i> cabezon.</i>

1026
01:00:03,002 --> 01:00:04,635
-No way.
<i> -Si</i> way.

1027
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:06,743
It's alien.

1028
01:00:06,879 --> 01:00:08,406
Yeah. I don't really like
the term "alien."

1029
01:00:08,542 --> 01:00:10,343
-You can use it, but I just--
-Whatever, Rudy. Come on.

1030
01:00:10,479 --> 01:00:14,318
What happened
to Ted's professor guy?
How did he get it out?

1031
01:00:14,453 --> 01:00:15,719
You might want to sit down.

1032
01:00:18,021 --> 01:00:20,216
-Or not. All right--
-Rudy, please. Focus.

1033
01:00:20,352 --> 01:00:22,057
I got good news
and I got bad news.

1034
01:00:22,193 --> 01:00:24,393
The good news is,
I figured out how
to get it out.

1035
01:00:24,528 --> 01:00:25,895
Fine.

1036
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:28,292
And the bad news is
that you have to be dead.

1037
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,765
-What?
-Dead.

1038
01:00:30,901 --> 01:00:32,063
What do you
mean "dead"?

1039
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:33,771
Okay, right now,
Jaime, look.

1040
01:00:33,906 --> 01:00:36,003
It's fusing itself
to every cell in your body.

1041
01:00:36,138 --> 01:00:39,370
It's completely coiled
around your brain.

1042
01:00:39,506 --> 01:00:41,776
And there's nothing on earth
that could remove it.

1043
01:00:41,912 --> 01:00:44,544
It's designed
to protect its host.

1044
01:00:44,679 --> 01:00:46,113
To keep it alive.

1045
01:00:46,249 --> 01:00:48,180
So you're saying that
this thing's in me forever?

1046
01:00:48,315 --> 01:00:50,420
No, it's not forever.

1047
01:00:50,556 --> 01:00:52,316
I mean, it's just until you...

1048
01:00:53,292 --> 01:00:54,657
until you die.

1049
01:00:54,793 --> 01:00:56,388
I think it's kinda cool.

1050
01:00:56,524 --> 01:00:59,862
No, I mean, basically,
you are a superhero,<i> cabron.</i>

1051
01:00:59,997 --> 01:01:02,229
I'm so sorry.
I had no way of knowing--

1052
01:01:02,364 --> 01:01:05,130
Oh, you had no idea.
So then what are
my options now?

1053
01:01:05,266 --> 01:01:08,535
So, option one is
to become an android

1054
01:01:08,671 --> 01:01:10,104
for the rest of my life.

1055
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:12,367
Or option two is to hand myself
over to a murderous

1056
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:14,541
-billionaire psychopath?
-I'm so sorry.

1057
01:01:14,677 --> 01:01:16,010
All I wanted was a job.

1058
01:01:16,146 --> 01:01:18,446
- Maybe there's a--
- Maybe what, Rudy?

1059
01:01:18,581 --> 01:01:20,015
It's all bad news.

1060
01:01:20,151 --> 01:01:21,552
Okay, this shit just doesn't
get any better for us.

1061
01:01:21,687 --> 01:01:23,446
I don't understand
why you can't...

1062
01:01:24,256 --> 01:01:26,317
God.

1063
01:01:26,452 --> 01:01:28,985
Whatever. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go for a walk.

1064
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,754
Jaime, just...

1065
01:01:30,889 --> 01:01:33,088
Let me go talk to him.
I think I know
where he's going.

1066
01:01:33,224 --> 01:01:35,865
<i> Cabezon,</i> wait up.

1067
01:01:45,837 --> 01:01:47,107
God.

1068
01:01:52,181 --> 01:01:55,650
There he is.
I knew I'd find you out here.

1069
01:01:55,786 --> 01:01:57,887
Like a cat, Jaime.

1070
01:02:06,297 --> 01:02:08,265
I'm sorry for yelling
at you, Rudy.

1071
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,331
I shouldn't have
yelled at you, but...

1072
01:02:10,467 --> 01:02:13,670
It's not lost on me
that your situation

1073
01:02:13,806 --> 01:02:16,136
is a little bit
out of the ordinary.

1074
01:02:18,138 --> 01:02:20,310
Yeah, we're...

1075
01:02:20,446 --> 01:02:22,209
we're resilient people.

1076
01:02:22,344 --> 01:02:26,047
Life will continue to hit us
with curve balls, and...

1077
01:02:26,183 --> 01:02:29,414
difference is, when we
get hit, we get stronger.

1078
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:33,820
Look at your old man.
He brought me here from Sonora.

1079
01:02:33,956 --> 01:02:38,521
I was ten. I think he was 19.

1080
01:02:38,656 --> 01:02:41,260
And people think
crossing the border is hard.

1081
01:02:41,396 --> 01:02:43,295
Yeah, it's hard,
but you know what's harder?

1082
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:47,732
The next 20 years after,
I mean,<i> la chinga.</i>

1083
01:02:47,867 --> 01:02:52,370
But your<i> viejo</i> would work
16 hours a day, bust his ass.

1084
01:02:52,505 --> 01:02:54,776
Any<i> jale</i> he could
get his hands on.

1085
01:02:54,911 --> 01:02:57,244
<i> Jornalero,</i> bus boy, waiter.

1086
01:02:57,380 --> 01:03:00,613
He was a mechanic,
<i> era de todo,</i> dishwasher.

1087
01:03:02,652 --> 01:03:05,921
And to get us all here
and to keep us all together.

1088
01:03:06,056 --> 01:03:09,024
And not that he wanted to,
he had to.

1089
01:03:09,991 --> 01:03:11,861
That's what we come from.

1090
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:15,462
The universe has
sent you a gift, Jaime.

1091
01:03:15,597 --> 01:03:18,495
And you have to figure out
what you're going to do
with it.

1092
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:20,970
Maybe this did all happen
for a reason.

1093
01:03:22,073 --> 01:03:25,205
Maybe it's time
that we get our own hero.

1094
01:03:26,507 --> 01:03:29,077
And not just some
foot up our ass.

1095
01:03:30,177 --> 01:03:31,108
Hey, but what do I know, huh?

1096
01:03:31,243 --> 01:03:32,542
I'm just some failed promise

1097
01:03:32,677 --> 01:03:34,577
that sleeps
in his brother's living room.

1098
01:03:36,555 --> 01:03:37,855
Don't say that, man.

1099
01:03:38,723 --> 01:03:40,153
You're not a failed promise.

1100
01:03:40,289 --> 01:03:42,858
Come on, you're the shit!
You know it.

1101
01:03:42,993 --> 01:03:45,093
- I am the shit.
- Yeah.

1102
01:03:45,927 --> 01:03:49,395
And... and I love you.

1103
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:52,263
And I love you, too,<i> cabezon.</i>
Yeah, all right.

1104
01:03:52,398 --> 01:03:54,404
Guys?

1105
01:03:56,167 --> 01:03:57,875
Do you hear that?

1106
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:00,372
That's Victoria.

1107
01:04:05,849 --> 01:04:07,247
Where are they going?

1108
01:04:09,519 --> 01:04:10,650
Home.

1109
01:04:12,155 --> 01:04:14,152
You're wasting
too much water.

1110
01:04:25,269 --> 01:04:26,936
It's always my fault.

1111
01:04:28,773 --> 01:04:29,802
Yeah.

1112
01:04:55,094 --> 01:04:56,395
Guys?

1113
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:00,036
I think there's somebody
at the window.

1114
01:05:08,843 --> 01:05:11,207
<i> Jaime Reyes,</i>

01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,874
We'll burn that bridge
when we get to it.

1278
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:50,878
That's not
how you say--

1279
01:17:00,755 --> 01:17:03,091
<i> Ama,</i> I'm flying!

1280
01:17:03,226 --> 01:17:04,694
Whoo!

1281
01:17:08,394 --> 01:17:11,664
After 15 years,
everything we've done,

1282
01:17:11,799 --> 01:17:13,829
every sacrifice we've made,

1283
01:17:13,965 --> 01:17:16,531
has led to this moment.

1284
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:20,836
Finally, the power
of the Scarab will be ours.

1285
01:17:20,972 --> 01:17:22,438
Almost there.

1286
01:17:22,574 --> 01:17:25,477
We are going
to change the world, Carapax.

1287
01:17:25,613 --> 01:17:27,116
Are you ready?

1288
01:17:27,251 --> 01:17:28,377
I'm ready.

1289
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,860
Is this thing bulletproof?

1290
01:17:47,764 --> 01:17:51,939
Well, do you guys
wanna see Dad's toys?

1291
01:17:55,978 --> 01:17:58,508
Wait, is that
Kabloom bubble gum?

1292
01:17:58,644 --> 01:18:01,714
Oh, no, no.
 That's not what you think it is.

1293
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:04,381
It's just a special prototype

1294
01:18:04,516 --> 01:18:07,686
my dad was designing for me
when I was little.

1295
01:18:07,821 --> 01:18:09,423
Do these things work?

1296
01:18:09,559 --> 01:18:11,893
Mm... some of them.

1297
01:18:12,857 --> 01:18:14,126
Sometimes.

1298
01:18:15,159 --> 01:18:17,233
Whoa.

1299
01:18:19,130 --> 01:18:20,799
Oh, that's the Bug Shield.

1300
01:18:20,934 --> 01:18:22,970
Try pressing another button.

1301
01:18:29,443 --> 01:18:32,782
Yeah, you know what?
I think I'm keeping this one.

1302
01:18:36,184 --> 01:18:39,013
Okay, so, how are we
supposed to learn

1303
01:18:39,149 --> 01:18:40,348
how to use these things?

1304
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:44,619
Nana?

1305
01:18:44,755 --> 01:18:48,094
Hey. How do you know
how to hold that so perfectly?

1306
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:01,174
This is where
they took Jaime.

1307
01:19:01,309 --> 01:19:04,440
Pago is a Caribbean island
off the coast of Cuba

1308
01:19:04,575 --> 01:19:07,679
that Kord bought from Batista
in the 50s.

1309
01:19:07,815 --> 01:19:09,511
The place is a fortress.

1310
01:19:09,647 --> 01:19:11,447
Okay, how the hell
are we gonna get in there?

1311
01:19:14,185 --> 01:19:15,350
What the hell?

1312
01:19:15,486 --> 01:19:16,824
Mili, one day, we gonna
have to talk

1313
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,458
about Nana's
revolutionary past.

1314
01:19:18,593 --> 01:19:19,426
Her what?

1315
01:19:36,114 --> 01:19:37,372
Yeah,
the generators are here.

1316
01:19:37,508 --> 01:19:38,879
- Mm.
- We could blow them up

1317
01:19:39,015 --> 01:19:40,911
and knock power out.

1318
01:19:49,689 --> 01:19:51,326
Hm?

1319
01:19:51,461 --> 01:19:54,160
Damn, Nana.

1320
01:20:16,212 --> 01:20:17,251
Hey, who are you?

1321
01:20:18,850 --> 01:20:21,086
What're you doing?
Get me out of this thing,
please?

1322
01:20:21,222 --> 01:20:23,459
Is there a problem,
Sanchez?

1323
01:20:23,594 --> 01:20:25,094
I'm sorry.

1324
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:27,124
You're sorry? You're sorry?
What does that even mean?

1325
01:20:27,259 --> 01:20:28,898
Tell her to get me out of this!

1326
01:20:31,701 --> 01:20:33,633
It's okay. It's okay.

1327
01:20:33,768 --> 01:20:36,299
Yeah. Listen, kid.

1328
01:20:36,435 --> 01:20:39,701
The Scarab chose you,
that's true.

1329
01:20:39,836 --> 01:20:45,077
But it doesn't belong to you.
It belongs to me.

1330
01:20:45,213 --> 01:20:47,148
But now that you've
activated it,

1331
01:20:47,283 --> 01:20:50,951
we can transfer its code
directly into the O.M.A.C.

1332
01:20:51,087 --> 01:20:52,283
What are you
even talking about?

1333
01:20:52,418 --> 01:20:54,752
No, no, Miss Kord.
It could kill him.

1334
01:20:54,887 --> 01:20:56,456
Oh, bummer.

1335
01:20:56,591 --> 01:21:00,058
Well, but sacrifices have to
be made for the greater good.

1336
01:21:00,193 --> 01:21:03,695
And this is yours, Jaime Reyes.

1337
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:05,298
Do it, Sanchez.

1338
01:21:05,434 --> 01:21:07,265
With all due respect,
my name, again, is not Sanchez.

1339
01:21:07,401 --> 01:21:10,005
Hey, hey!
Get me outta this thing!

1340
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:15,373
Damn it.

1341
01:21:28,722 --> 01:21:29,925
Bug.

1342
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:32,060
- Rudy.
- Yeah, I see it.

1343
01:21:35,228 --> 01:21:36,493
You're going too fast!

1344
01:21:37,966 --> 01:21:39,397
Here goes nothing.

1345
01:21:41,368 --> 01:21:44,039
Hold on, hold on!

1346
01:21:45,209 --> 01:21:48,076
All right. All right.

1347
01:21:49,041 --> 01:21:51,645
Incoming!

1348
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:52,811
Brace for impact!

1349
01:22:07,293 --> 01:22:09,093
Let's go, let's go!

1350
01:22:09,228 --> 01:22:11,726
On the wall! Engage. Engage.

1351
01:22:16,532 --> 01:22:18,170
Rudy, do something.

1352
01:22:18,306 --> 01:22:20,471
Rudy, we need to move.
We need to move.

1353
01:22:33,316 --> 01:22:34,650
Here we go!

1354
01:22:39,458 --> 01:22:40,693
Whoa.

1355
01:22:40,828 --> 01:22:42,097
Okay, okay.

1356
01:22:57,646 --> 01:22:59,609
Get out of the way. Sorry!

1357
01:23:04,787 --> 01:23:07,089
- It's like I can't miss.
- Right there, right there.

1358
01:23:13,297 --> 01:23:14,261
- Twenty points!
- Whoo-hoo!

1359
01:23:26,569 --> 01:23:28,605
Activating cloaking system.

1360
01:23:30,412 --> 01:23:32,345
<i> Activating bug fart.</i>

1361
01:23:40,185 --> 01:23:41,552
Take that!

1362
01:23:42,185 --> 01:23:44,092
Whoo!

1363
01:24:14,518 --> 01:24:16,217
-Yeah, this way.
-Okay.

1364
01:24:16,353 --> 01:24:18,160
Hey! Come on.

1365
01:24:19,225 --> 01:24:20,794
I know you can hear me.

1366
01:24:24,129 --> 01:24:25,629
Just let me out!

1367
01:24:36,277 --> 01:24:38,114
I'll keep it safe.

1368
01:24:38,849 --> 01:24:40,015
Start the transfer.

1369
01:24:40,151 --> 01:24:42,514
And when it's complete,
kill the kid.

1370
01:24:43,249 --> 01:24:44,448
Get me out of here!

1371
01:24:44,584 --> 01:24:45,746
But, Miss Kord,
we could learn so much

1372
01:24:45,882 --> 01:24:47,553
from his connection
to the Scarab--

1373
01:24:47,689 --> 01:24:48,857
We can learn a lot more
if we take it off his corpse.

1374
01:24:48,992 --> 01:24:52,128
Let me out! No! No!

1375
01:25:10,012 --> 01:25:11,906
Milagro, here, hide!

1376
01:25:22,187 --> 01:25:23,456
Holy shit.

1377
01:25:24,357 --> 01:25:25,821
Okay, I think we're good.

1378
01:25:27,863 --> 01:25:28,857
What the...

1379
01:25:34,169 --> 01:25:38,336
Victoria, you crazy bitch.

1380
01:25:38,472 --> 01:25:40,407
What the hell
is this?

1381
01:25:40,543 --> 01:25:42,912
Fully operational
O.M.A.C. systems.

1382
01:25:43,047 --> 01:25:45,181
Enough to build an entire army.

1383
01:25:59,188 --> 01:26:01,061
Miss Kord, this...
this isn't looking good.

1384
01:26:01,196 --> 01:26:02,428
What's going on?

1385
01:26:02,564 --> 01:26:04,059
Oh, no.
The Scarab download

1386
01:26:04,195 --> 01:26:05,659
is generating too much power.
Our systems are spiking.

1387
01:26:05,795 --> 01:26:07,334
What does it mean?

1388
01:26:07,470 --> 01:26:09,229
The transfer is killing him.

1389
01:26:09,365 --> 01:26:12,137
He can't die before
the transfer is completed.

1390
01:26:12,272 --> 01:26:13,368
His pulse is dropping.

1391
01:26:13,503 --> 01:26:15,171
Well, just fix it!

1392
01:26:36,793 --> 01:26:38,960
Hey,<i> flaco.</i>

1393
01:26:50,043 --> 01:26:51,313
Dad.

1394
01:26:54,279 --> 01:26:55,647
What's going on?

1395
01:26:59,484 --> 01:27:01,356
What are you doing here?

1396
01:27:05,158 --> 01:27:06,361
You know.

1397
01:27:08,029 --> 01:27:10,161
No.<i> Apa.</i>

1398
01:27:23,513 --> 01:27:27,316
Milagro, here.
Help me with these.

1399
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:52,869
Jaime.

1400
01:27:55,639 --> 01:27:58,011
This is not your time.

1401
01:27:58,147 --> 01:27:59,579
You have to go back.

1402
01:28:02,217 --> 01:28:03,579
Please.

1403
01:28:03,714 --> 01:28:06,322
I understand everything now.

1404
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:10,484
My destiny was
to be here with you.

1405
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:12,460
In this moment.

1406
01:28:13,328 --> 01:28:15,628
To help you cross into it.

1407
01:28:25,508 --> 01:28:27,409
This is your purpose.

1408
01:28:58,843 --> 01:29:02,378
<i> It's time for you</i>
<i> to accept your destiny, Jaime.</i>

1409
01:29:16,493 --> 01:29:18,691
How am I gonna
do this without you?

1410
01:29:22,930 --> 01:29:25,328
How am I
gonna know what to do?

1411
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:44,519
I love you, too,<i> Papi.</i>

1412
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:05,639
Something's happening.

1413
01:30:06,173 --> 01:30:07,742
What?

1414
01:30:07,878 --> 01:30:09,773
His brainwaves, they're syncing
with the Scarab's frequency.

1415
01:30:09,909 --> 01:30:11,876
Right there.
They're connecting.

1416
01:30:17,153 --> 01:30:19,015
I need you, Khaji!

1417
01:30:21,818 --> 01:30:23,756
They're becoming one.

1418
01:30:34,899 --> 01:30:35,997
We've got the code?

1419
01:30:36,132 --> 01:30:37,404
The transfer's complete.

1420
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:38,434
The code is ours.

1421
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:40,069
It's working!

1422
01:30:56,192 --> 01:30:57,625
Oh, no.

1423
01:30:59,394 --> 01:31:00,826
Go, go, go!

1424
01:31:18,379 --> 01:31:20,575
Okay. Here we go.

1425
01:31:39,768 --> 01:31:41,537
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah.

1426
01:31:58,286 --> 01:31:59,813
No. No, no, no.

1427
01:32:02,456 --> 01:32:04,257
Sanchez, stop him!

1428
01:32:04,393 --> 01:32:05,858
Oh, shit.

1429
01:32:17,304 --> 01:32:18,673
What?

1430
01:32:18,808 --> 01:32:20,840
Get your family
and get off this island, okay?

1431
01:32:20,975 --> 01:32:22,270
-Wait, wait, wait. My family?
-Quickly!

1432
01:32:22,405 --> 01:32:24,580
What do you mean my family?

1433
01:32:25,279 --> 01:32:26,340
Go!

1434
01:32:26,475 --> 01:32:29,046
Sanchez, you moron.
What are you doing?

1435
01:32:30,247 --> 01:32:33,249
My name is not Sanchez,
<i> pendeja!</i>

1436
01:32:33,384 --> 01:32:37,593
It's Jose Francisco Morales
Rivera de la Cruz!

1437
01:32:40,126 --> 01:32:42,496
What are you doing?

1438

1600
01:46:01,563 --> 01:46:03,827
I know. No, I know
about family.

1601
01:46:03,962 --> 01:46:08,102
I know about my family
that overlooked me,

1602
01:46:08,238 --> 01:46:09,602
just the way that you are now,

1603
01:46:09,737 --> 01:46:12,099
because you are
just like your pathetic father,

1604
01:46:12,234 --> 01:46:15,306
who didn't have the guts
to do what was necessary

1605
01:46:15,441 --> 01:46:17,071
for the greater good.

1606

1612
01:47:10,129 --> 01:47:12,898

What about Rudy?

What if he doesn't
survive the procedure?

1622
01:47:51,872 --> 01:47:53,471
Then we'll just
get another one.

1623
01:47:53,607 --> 01:47:54,938
It could kill him.

1624

I'll f... I'll fix it.
I'll fix you.

<i> to the community.</i>

01:56:37,893 --> 01:56:39,830
Where,<i> Ama?</i>
We don't have a house.

1700
01:56:39,965 --> 01:56:41,694
Rudy, we have, like,
half the Edge Keys
in our yard right now.

1701
01:56:41,830 --> 01:56:43,801
I'm sure they'll be happy
to help us out.

1702
01:56:43,936 --> 01:56:45,501
Of course
they're going to help.

1703
01:56:45,637 --> 01:56:48,139
Yeah, until when?
Until Kord pushes us out?

1704
01:56:48,275 --> 01:56:49,873
I wouldn't worry about that.

1705

Jenny, Jenny.

01:56:52,844 --> 01:56:53,645
Hi.

1707
01:56:55,384 --> 01:56:57,280
I think it's time
to return the Edge Keys

1708
01:56:57,416 --> 01:56:58,845
to the people
that made it great.

1709
01:56:58,981 --> 01:57:01,181
Sounds like the Reyes family's
rubbing off a little bit

1710
01:57:01,316 --> 01:57:02,750
on Jenny Kord, no?

1711
01:57:02,885 --> 01:57:04,718
Kord has a lot to learn
from the Edge Keys.

1712
01:57:05,827 --> 01:57:07,127
Starting with you, Rudy.

1713
01:57:07,262 --> 01:57:08,595
Wait a minute,
did you tell her to say that?

1714
01:57:08,731 --> 01:57:10,322
Rudy, I didn't say shit.

1715
01:57:10,458 --> 01:57:12,096
That sounds like something
that you would say to her
to tell me.

1716
01:57:12,232 --> 01:57:14,166
And don't worry,
Kord Industries

1717
01:57:14,302 --> 01:57:16,132
will fix and give you back
your house.

1718
01:57:19,003 --> 01:57:20,533
Excuse me.

1719
01:57:20,668 --> 01:57:22,238
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

1720
01:57:22,373 --> 01:57:24,277
-Here, Rudy.
-What's this?

1721
01:57:24,412 --> 01:57:27,912
I felt really bad,
so I got you a new tailgate.

1722
01:57:31,921 --> 01:57:33,286
How do you like that, cupcake?

1723
01:57:33,421 --> 01:57:36,484
Oh! Wow, it's blue.
A little on the nose, no?

1724
01:57:36,619 --> 01:57:38,588
- Rudy.
- Rudy. "Thank you."

1725
01:57:38,724 --> 01:57:40,726
- I'll think about it.
- Yeah, take a look.

1726
01:57:40,862 --> 01:57:43,229
- Oh, wow.
Come on, help me like it.
-I'm inheriting that.

1727
01:57:45,097 --> 01:57:46,727
All right, I gotta go.

1728
01:57:48,196 --> 01:57:49,835
Yeah.

1729
01:57:49,971 --> 01:57:51,666
How about I walk you out?

1730
01:57:52,501 --> 01:57:54,372
-Yeah, sure.
-Okay.

1731

Where are you headed?

1735
01:58:13,992 --> 01:58:15,459
To my dad's.

1736
01:58:15,595 --> 01:58:17,857
I want to look at
my mom's paintings again.

1737
01:58:19,234 --> 01:58:21,601
I forgot how beautiful
they are.
