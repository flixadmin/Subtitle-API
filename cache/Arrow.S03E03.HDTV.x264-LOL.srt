1
00:00:01,545 --> 00:00:04,253
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,037
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:06,356 --> 00:00:08,523
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:08,525 --> 00:00:10,742
to save my city.

5
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:13,444
Now others have
joined my crusade.

6
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:16,030
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

7
00:00:16,032 --> 00:00:18,283
But to the rest
of Starling City,

8
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:19,834
I am someone else.

9
00:00:19,836 --> 00:00:22,453
I am something else.

10
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,038
Previously, on "Arrow"...

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,456
Hello, Sara.

12
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,292
What are you doing here?

13
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:33,014
Whoever did this,
I'm going to find them.

14
00:00:33,016 --> 00:00:34,215
Apparently there's
another bidder for the company.

15
00:00:34,217 --> 00:00:35,466
Who?

16
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:36,751
Ray Palmer.

17
00:00:36,753 --> 00:00:39,387
Yes, I am your boss now.

18
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:41,639
No!

19
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:44,809
Roy, I don't
trust you, or anyone.

20
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:48,279
Don't try to find me.
I am never coming back.

21
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,781
Now I've got
to go get Thea.

22
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,983
It's long past time
she came home.

23
00:00:53,703 --> 00:00:56,037
Well done.

24
00:00:59,075 --> 00:01:01,643
Thanks, Dad.

25
00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:21,529
So, where are we going?

26
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:22,830
Wherever you want.

27
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,504
It's up to me?
Why not?

28
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,565
I'm a well-traveled man.

29
00:01:26,589 --> 00:01:28,710
I've been every place
in the world there is.

30
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,905
But you want
to get out of here.

31
00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:34,275
Because if the police know
you're alive, they come after you.

32
00:01:34,277 --> 00:01:36,611
The Arrow, too.

33
00:01:36,613 --> 00:01:40,181
You're very
perceptive, Thea.

34
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:43,167
Knowing when people are hiding
something behind their smiles.

35
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,086
Your mother
had that talent.

36
00:01:45,088 --> 00:01:47,338
Yes.

37
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,590
If someone knew
where I was,

38
00:01:49,592 --> 00:01:51,909
it would be
unfortunate--

39
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,678
for both of us.

40
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:58,883
So why did you
reach out to me?

41
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,284
You reached first.

42
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,053
Still.

43
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:06,140
I don't want to feel
this pain again.

44
00:02:06,142 --> 00:02:08,309
I don't want to hurt

45
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:10,278
or get hurt

46
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,281
ever again.

47
00:02:13,283 --> 00:02:17,368
And you seem like someone
who can teach me how not to.

48
00:02:48,518 --> 00:02:50,902
I didn't do it!

49
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,653
A woman was killed
on a rooftop last week.

50
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:54,572
Black leather,
blonde hair, wore a mask!

51
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,324
I didn't kill her.
You were there!

52
00:02:56,326 --> 00:02:58,075
I don't know
anything about it!

53
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,077
Your fingerprints
are on this.

54
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,529
From a fifth I drank
up there, but I--

55
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:03,030
What did you see?

56
00:03:03,032 --> 00:03:04,582
Nothing!

57
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,367
I was up on the roof
with some buddies.

58
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:07,869
This lady,
she showed up

59
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:09,620
and she--
she told us to go!

60
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,622
Looked like she could handle
herself, you know?

61
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,426
Whoever it is
you're looking for,

62
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:16,878
I wouldn't want
to be him.

63
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:21,382
Another dead end.

64
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:24,435
It took me a week to get
a hit off that print.

65
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:25,937
I had to reconstruct
the partial

66
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,722
using a predictive
indexing algorithm.

67
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:30,641
Appropriate, since it was
his index finger...

68
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,895
Not particularly
relevant now.

69
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:38,566
Don't worry, Oliver, we'll find him.
He's out there somewhere.

70
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:40,067
No, he's not.

71
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:42,236
Trail's gone cold.

72
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:44,822
I hate to do this, but I have to
head off to work.

73
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,314
Tech Village
is open this early?

74
00:03:46,338 --> 00:03:47,666
Not exactly.

75
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:49,338
Have you figured out
where in Italy Thea's staying?

76
00:03:49,338 --> 00:03:51,079
Yeah, about that--
she's not in Italy.

77
00:03:51,103 --> 00:03:51,663
Hmm?

78
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:54,749
Or Europe.
Or, well, she's--

79
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:56,217
Where is she?

80
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:57,635
I had to ping her cell phone
to find out

81
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,054
where in Italy she
was texting from.

82
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:04,175
Turns out, came back
Corto Maltese.

83
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:05,893
Corto's an island
off of South America.

84
00:04:05,895 --> 00:04:08,095
What's up with your family
and islands?

85
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:11,098
Wait, Oliver.

86
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,068
Thea's letter said
not to come find her.

87
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,271
That letter was addressed
to you, not to me.

88
00:04:17,273 --> 00:04:21,909
I'm watching Laurel
go through losing Sara.

89
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:26,280
It's time for my sister
to come home.

90
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,120
What are you doing?

91
00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:34,956
Thea's gone because of me.

92
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,591
Because the lies
that I told her.

93
00:04:36,593 --> 00:04:38,426
So I owe this to both
of you to make things right.

94
00:04:38,428 --> 00:04:41,429
No. What are
you...doing?

95
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:44,332
You can't travel
with that.

96
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,720
I've actually never
been on a plane before.

97
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,477
I know. You're not
doing anything

98
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,446
and I could literally
watch you forever.

99
00:04:58,448 --> 00:05:00,231
Oh, yeah?

100
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,034
What about once
she discovers boys?

101
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,287
Well, that's what my Glock
is for, right, baby?

102
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:08,456
Right. It's my Glock.

103
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:19,967
I'm going to enjoy some quality time
with her for the next few days.

104
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:22,670
I'm even looking forward
to changing a few diapers.

105
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:25,890
And I'm looking forward to believing
that when I see it.

106
00:05:27,343 --> 00:05:29,894
Why the time off?

107
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,846
You quit
the team again?

108
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:34,348
No, Oliver's going
to Corto Maltese

109
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,018
for a couple of days.

110
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,854
Could you
go with him?

111
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:43,074
Like I don't already spend
enough time with Oliver as it is?

112
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:46,110
Team Arrow may have Starling City
purring like a kitten,

113
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:49,864
but the rest of the world is still
a very dangerous place.

114
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:52,366
Including Corto Maltese.

115
00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:54,168
Lyla, I already don't like
where this is headed.

116
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,170
We have a field operative
down there who's gone dark.

117
00:05:56,172 --> 00:05:58,706
All right, so send an agent.
Send a task force.

118
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,508
He's not in any
kind of trouble.

119
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,543
He hasn't touched
his panic button.

120
00:06:02,545 --> 00:06:05,179
He's probably just drunk
in some belleza's villa.

121
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:08,132
Mark Shaw's been known
to miss a few days from time to time.

122
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,054
Will you just
do me a favor...

123
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:14,722
And see if he's ok?

124
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:16,490
Tell him to check in.

125
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:18,309
Two more days and I'm going to have
to call in the cavalry.

126
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,361
And I don't want to get him into
trouble with Waller.

127
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:23,364
Mark's an old friend.

128
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:29,403
She better not do anything interesting
while I'm gone.

129
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:42,216
Next time,
keep your hands up.

130
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:49,090
Ted Grant?

131
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:50,641
Well, I guess that badge means
you're not here

132
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,143
for a self defense
class.

133
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,811
No, I've already had
my fair share.

134
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:56,013
I'm here about one
of your students, Tom Bronson.

135
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,264
A witness places him
at the scene

136
00:06:57,266 --> 00:06:58,803
of a break-in last night.

137
00:06:58,803 --> 00:06:59,854
Well, that's not possible.

138
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,022
See, because Tom and I
were sparring last night.

139
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,355
Mr. Grant, do you
know that lying

140
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,690
to the district
attorney

141
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,158
is against the law?

142
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,110
If by that, you mean
am I willing to lie

143
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:11,495
in order to keep a good kid who
just happened to make a stupid mistake

144
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,365
out of this system?
I think you know my answer.

145
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:18,369
Are you admitting
to perjury, Mr. Grant?

146
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,088
Now that's a big word.

147
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,124
I'm just a dumb fighter.

148
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:24,875
Right?

149
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,861
Look, Tom was here
with me last night.

150
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,679
We worked on his
uppercut combinations.

151
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,948
Like I said, in this city,
there's a lot of good people

152
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,767
who get dealt bad hands.

153
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:34,769
They lose someone, they lose themselves,
which is why they

154
00:07:34,771 --> 00:07:36,804
come in here
to work off that rage.

155
00:07:36,806 --> 00:07:39,056
I've gotten good
at picking out the types.

156
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,891
Types just like you.

157
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:43,194
If I'm angry,
it's because I'm dealing

158
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,445
with someone who's
willing to lie to a D.A.

159
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:46,063
to protect a punk kid.

160
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,732
I don't think
that's the case.

161
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:51,318
Either way,

162
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,121
if you do have something
you want to work off...

163
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,726
So what's the play
with Thea?

164
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,095
Do you mind if I talk
to her alone first?

165
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,347
It's been a while.

166
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:21,816
Felicity able
to pin her down?

167
00:08:21,818 --> 00:08:24,568
She gave me an address.

168
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:42,286
Thea!

169
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,590
Señor.

170
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,925
Cómo puedo ayudarlo?

171
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,710
Estoy buscando
a mi hermana.

172
00:08:49,712 --> 00:08:52,296
You must be Mia's brother.

173
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,048
I see the resemblance.

174
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,633
Is "Mia" around?

175
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:58,018
She works. At the cafe.

176
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,103
Where's the cafe?

177
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,222
I'll show you.
Thank you.

178
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,984
I didn't come all the way
to South America

179
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,903
to have you poison me, did I?

180
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,074
It's a meditative tea.

181
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:23,794
It will activate
your mind and body.

182
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,881
I think I'm going to need
a little bit more than tea

183
00:09:26,883 --> 00:09:29,300
to learn how
to use one of those.

184
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,586
The Sohei Buddhist
warriors believed that

185
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:35,172
first you fight
with the mind...

186
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,508
then your sword.

187
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:41,929
I remember when
I was training

188
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:43,480
to be a warrior.

189
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,982
I began
just like you--

190
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,234
devastated
by my wife's death.

191
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:49,603
I was...angry,

192
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:51,772
and hurt.

193
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:56,527
The pain
was unbearable.

194
00:10:05,454 --> 00:10:07,538
Like this.

195
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,293
You're out of your mind!
Put your hand in here!

196
00:10:12,295 --> 00:10:15,763
Every warrior must learn
the simple truth--

197
00:10:15,765 --> 00:10:17,514
that pain
is inevitable,

198
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,384
and suffering
is optional.

199
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:23,721
Please, don't--

200
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:24,972
Don't do what I think
you're going to do!

201
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:27,808
You asked me
to teach you.

202
00:10:29,236 --> 00:10:30,801
No.

203
00:10:30,802 --> 00:10:34,802

206
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:49,043
Thea.

207
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,716
Good to see you.

208
00:10:55,718 --> 00:10:57,134
You, too.

209
00:10:57,136 --> 00:10:58,602
How--how did you--

210
00:10:58,604 --> 00:11:01,806
Well, it's not exactly
the Amalfi Coast.

211
00:11:03,976 --> 00:11:05,693
Voy a cerrar, earnesto.

212
00:11:05,695 --> 00:11:07,778
Didn't you flunk
Spanish?

213
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,564
More like
skipped it altogether.

214
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:12,883
Well, you look good.

215
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:15,252
I like
your hair cut.

216
00:11:15,254 --> 00:11:18,489
Thank you. Yeah,
wanted it short, you know.

217
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:20,157
It gets hot down here.

218
00:11:21,494 --> 00:11:23,961
I'm sorry I lied to you

219
00:11:23,963 --> 00:11:25,663
about it, Ollie.

220
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:28,666
I just needed some space.

221
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:31,802
It's ok. You've had
five months of it.

222
00:11:31,804 --> 00:11:35,506
This isn't just a visit.

223
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:42,346
Got one
for you, too.

224
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:44,248
After mom,

225
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,101
I understood why
you left Starling.

226
00:11:47,103 --> 00:11:50,488
But Thea,

227
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,106
I miss you.

228
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,529
And I would really like it
if you came home.

229
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:01,165
I miss you, too.

230
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:05,085
And I love you...so much.

231
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:08,839
But I'm never coming back
to Starling City.

232
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:19,300
Ahh!

233
00:12:19,302 --> 00:12:23,220
I can't. Sorry.

234
00:12:23,222 --> 00:12:24,889
There is strength
in you, Thea.

235
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:27,808
I see it, even if you can't
see it yourself.

236
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,977
I'm sorry, this--

237
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:34,482
this just isn't me.
I'm not like you. I can't do this!

238
00:12:34,484 --> 00:12:37,701
It's all right.

239
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:41,071
It's not your fault.

240
00:12:41,073 --> 00:12:43,457
It's mine.

241
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:47,411
Q.C. stock up 10 bucks
at the open.

242
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:49,129
That is love, ha!

243
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:51,832
Ah, miss Smoak,
good morning--

244
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:53,751
I think. I've been
here all night.

245
00:12:53,753 --> 00:12:55,719
My predecessor left
things a little, um,

246
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:58,172
what's the polite way
to say this? Little wonky.

247
00:12:58,174 --> 00:13:00,224
Sorry if I'm rambling.
I'm a little over-caffeinated.

248
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:01,976
I just had
three espressos.

249
00:13:01,978 --> 00:13:03,477
Speaking of coffee--
Let me stop you right there!

250
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:05,563
I told myself
that I would stand firm

251
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:06,525
on a few points.

252
00:13:06,548 --> 00:13:08,648
No late night emails,
no personal errands,

253
00:13:08,684 --> 00:13:11,485
and definitely no coffee.

254
00:13:11,487 --> 00:13:14,071
There'll be no espressos
brought to you by me.

255
00:13:14,073 --> 00:13:17,441
I stand very firm
on that last point.

256
00:13:17,443 --> 00:13:21,111
And I admire
your conviction.

257
00:13:21,113 --> 00:13:23,581
This is Jerry Conway,
your executive assistant.

258
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,117
And I wanted to know
if you'd like him to get you a coffee.

259
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:29,203
Or are you just
anti-latte in general?

260
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:32,339
Um...Executive assistant?

261
00:13:32,341 --> 00:13:36,093
I think that's
a yes on the latte.

262
00:13:36,095 --> 00:13:38,095
Thank you, Jerry.

263
00:13:38,097 --> 00:13:39,346
Thank you, Jerry.

264
00:13:39,348 --> 00:13:40,764
Should we get to
work? Excellent.

265
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:42,383
Applied Sciences.

266
00:13:42,385 --> 00:13:44,051
Q.C.'s bleeding edge
research division,

267
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:45,352
till some wacko
blew it up last year.

268
00:13:45,354 --> 00:13:47,638
I'm sure they had
their reasons.

269
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,907
The point is, it's the cornerstone
for my plan

270
00:13:49,908 --> 00:13:51,541
to rebuild
Queen Consolidated

271
00:13:51,544 --> 00:13:53,944
and thus the city.
I've had my people

272
00:13:53,946 --> 00:13:55,646
working day and night
salvaging what they can,

273
00:13:55,648 --> 00:13:57,481
including this--
a file server

274
00:13:57,483 --> 00:13:59,867
containing Applied
Science's design work.

275
00:13:59,869 --> 00:14:01,452
It's not working,
unfortunately,

276
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:03,237
on account of being caught
in a massive explosion.

277
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:05,205
You want me to access the data.

278
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:06,991
A brilliant mind
at work already.

279
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:09,426
Speaking of, I got
to get back to work.

280
00:14:09,428 --> 00:14:12,379
Then why are you
leaving your office?

281
00:14:12,381 --> 00:14:14,965
Oh, I'm not.
I'm leaving yours.

282
00:14:27,146 --> 00:14:29,313
This is Lyla's busy work, man
you didn't have to tag along.

283
00:14:29,315 --> 00:14:32,683
Well, I don't know how to vacation
like a normal person, Diggle.

284
00:14:32,685 --> 00:14:33,901
What's the plan?

285
00:14:33,903 --> 00:14:35,402
This spot's his
usual dead drop.

286
00:14:35,404 --> 00:14:37,738
Lyla sent me over
this file photo.

287
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,356
Just make sure
he's all right.

288
00:14:42,862 --> 00:14:44,862
Got him.
I got you.

289
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:47,798
He's a friendly,
Oliver.

290
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:52,503
Shaw.

291
00:14:52,505 --> 00:14:56,006
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey!

292
00:14:56,008 --> 00:14:57,758
Listen! I'm with
Lyla Michaels.

293
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,960
Have you seen any
capuchins today?

294
00:14:59,962 --> 00:15:01,845
If that's a challenge code, I got
to tell you, I'm not with A.R.G.U.S.

295
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:03,380
I'm just Lyla's
baby daddy.

296
00:15:03,382 --> 00:15:05,132
Now, you didn't check in, Shaw.
She was worried,

297
00:15:05,134 --> 00:15:06,967
so she sent me
to find you.

298
00:15:06,969 --> 00:15:08,886
If you're lyin', you'll be picking
your intestines up

299
00:15:08,888 --> 00:15:10,354
off this sidewalk.

300
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:12,723
That's fair enough.

301
00:15:14,894 --> 00:15:18,946
Lyla gave me a security
transcoder in my right jacket pocket.

302
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,373
Pretty jumpy, Shaw.

303
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:32,459
Better jumpy than dead.

304
00:15:32,461 --> 00:15:34,161
Copy that.
What's going on?

305
00:15:34,163 --> 00:15:36,547
Not here.

306
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:41,251
Sorry, I had--

307
00:15:41,253 --> 00:15:42,836
I had eyes on me
all week,

308
00:15:42,838 --> 00:15:44,338
a whole
follow team.

309
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,057
Wait, Shaw. What makes
you so important?

310
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:48,592
I have hard Intel.

311
00:15:48,593 --> 00:15:51,060
Someone from Corto Maltese
hacked into the server

312
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:52,596
and acquired
the A.R.G.U.S. actual.

313
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:54,014
They want to sell it.

314
00:15:54,016 --> 00:15:55,482
Did I mention I don't
work for A.R.G.U.S.?

315
00:15:55,484 --> 00:15:57,568
The actual is an encrypted
data omnibus.

316
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,153
It's a complete record
of agent covers,

317
00:15:59,155 --> 00:16:01,605
personal details,
affiliated soft targets--

318
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:05,492
Whoa, whoa, whoa, soft targets...
As in family members?

319
00:16:05,494 --> 00:16:08,028
Yeah, as in women
and children.

320
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,915
You get why
this is so important?

321
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:14,426
Hi, my name is Laurel,
I'm an alcoholic.

322
00:16:14,428 --> 00:16:16,094
Hi, Laurel.

323
00:16:16,096 --> 00:16:19,347
A week ago, I...

324
00:16:19,349 --> 00:16:22,400
Something happened.

325
00:16:22,402 --> 00:16:25,937
Something that
I can't share with anyone

326
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:30,108
for several
complicated reasons.

327
00:16:32,662 --> 00:16:36,614
I thought that I was going
to want to drink...

328
00:16:36,616 --> 00:16:38,833
But I didn't.

329
00:16:38,835 --> 00:16:40,418
Not even tempted,
really.

330
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:45,807
But what I am is...

331
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:48,877
Is I'm angry.

332
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,012
And I don't know
what to do with it

333
00:16:51,014 --> 00:16:54,532
or--or where to put
it. I just...

334
00:16:58,939 --> 00:17:02,974
Thank you for
letting me share.

335
00:17:02,976 --> 00:17:07,145
Are there any other
burning desires?

336
00:17:09,566 --> 00:17:13,084
Erica. Alcoholic.

337
00:17:13,086 --> 00:17:14,235
Hi, Erica.

338
00:17:14,237 --> 00:17:16,037
My boyfriend and me

339
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,639
got into another
fight last night.

340
00:17:17,641 --> 00:17:20,992
Some of you know,
he still drinks, a lot.

341
00:17:20,994 --> 00:17:23,161
And I said something.

342
00:17:24,464 --> 00:17:28,216
I know I should have
just kept my mouth shut.

343
00:17:28,218 --> 00:17:33,688
I know I should
just leave him, but...I can't.

344
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,140
Maybe there's a meeting

345
00:17:35,142 --> 00:17:36,808
I should be
going to for that.

346
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:40,011
Once a month, Erica
gives a share like that

347
00:17:40,013 --> 00:17:41,596
- and it's getting worse.
- Yeah.

348
00:17:41,598 --> 00:17:43,064
Do you know
the boyfriend has

349
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:44,432
eight assault charges
against him?

350
00:17:44,434 --> 00:17:45,767
And not just
in Starling.

351
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:46,985
He's got warrants
out on him

352
00:17:46,987 --> 00:17:48,570
as far off
as Coast City.

353
00:17:48,572 --> 00:17:50,071
And it takes everything in me
not to go after

354
00:17:50,073 --> 00:17:51,656
a dirtbag like that,
but the day the cops

355
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:53,575
start bringing their badges
into AA meetings,

356
00:17:53,577 --> 00:17:56,494
that's the day that
the drunks stop coming.

357
00:18:01,535 --> 00:18:04,035
I'm in position.

358
00:18:04,037 --> 00:18:06,538
The sale of the actual
is going down here.

359
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,341
Only two of us. You didn't want
to call for back up?

360
00:18:10,343 --> 00:18:12,544
Hey.

361
00:18:12,546 --> 00:18:14,796
That's the only insurance
policy you're going to need.

362
00:18:18,185 --> 00:18:20,218
They're here.

363
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:26,524
You're not worried about them
seeing our ride?

364
00:18:27,811 --> 00:18:30,161
How did you know
the buy was happening?

365
00:18:30,162 --> 00:18:34,364
I've been a station agent
in Corto Maltese for three years now.

366
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,035
I got this third-world
garbage dump wired.

367
00:18:38,705 --> 00:18:40,572
What's wrong?

368
00:18:42,826 --> 00:18:45,743
There's no buy,
is there, Shaw?

369
00:19:04,431 --> 00:19:06,898
Sorry for lyin' to you,
John. Well, partially lyin'.

370
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,684
There is a buy going down,
just not till tomorrow.

371
00:19:09,686 --> 00:19:11,603
I needed to get this first.

372
00:19:11,605 --> 00:19:14,906
Thanks for helping me
decode the actual.

373
00:19:14,908 --> 00:19:17,275
Diggle!

374
00:19:39,497 --> 00:19:42,181
Should have got
the heavy duty ones.

375
00:19:42,483 --> 00:19:44,332
I like your hair.

376
00:19:44,334 --> 00:19:47,936
What are you and my brother
like travel buddies now?

377
00:19:48,627 --> 00:19:50,694
No, we're just
worried about you.

378
00:19:55,117 --> 00:19:57,117
Oliver said you weren't
going to come back, so...

379
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,303
I figured I'd come here
and try to convince you to.

380
00:20:00,305 --> 00:20:01,638
Well, you can't.

381
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,006
Look, I get it, you're hurt.

382
00:20:03,008 --> 00:20:05,175
I lied to you,
I lied right to your face.

383
00:20:05,177 --> 00:20:06,938
But I--I need you to know
that when I said

384
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:08,679
I wanted to leave
Starling with you,

385
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,263
that wasn't a lie.

386
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:13,550
I didn't just leave
because of you, Roy.

387
00:20:13,552 --> 00:20:16,720
My mother lied to me,

388
00:20:16,722 --> 00:20:19,222
my brother.

389
00:20:19,224 --> 00:20:22,809
I had to get away from Starling City
and all the secrets.

390
00:20:22,811 --> 00:20:25,812
And I found
myself here.

391
00:20:25,814 --> 00:20:28,565
Isn't it lonely here?

392
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:31,234
That's kind of what
I like about it.

393
00:20:31,236 --> 00:20:34,154
There's no one here
who knows me

394
00:20:34,155 --> 00:20:37,656
or thinks of me
as Thea Queen

395
00:20:37,659 --> 00:20:39,976
or Thea Merlyn.

396
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,381
No one who lies
to me, or...

397
00:20:44,383 --> 00:20:47,751
tries to protect me
with secrets.

398
00:20:47,753 --> 00:20:50,470
All I ever wanted
was for you to be happy, Thea.

399
00:20:50,472 --> 00:20:53,056
I'm sorry I got
in the way of that.

400
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:55,425
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

401
00:20:55,427 --> 00:20:58,395
If being here instead of home
makes you happy, then--

402
00:20:58,397 --> 00:21:00,730
then you should stay.

403
00:21:03,685 --> 00:21:06,736
Roy?

404
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,540
Are you ok?

405
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:13,443
You look
a little tired.

406
00:21:13,445 --> 00:21:16,196
I just haven't been
sleeping much lately.

407
00:21:16,198 --> 00:21:18,949
You take care.

408
00:21:33,632 --> 00:21:36,132
What do you mean?

409
00:21:36,134 --> 00:21:39,135
It's not your fault,
it's mine.

410
00:21:40,939 --> 00:21:42,939
I thought I could
do this differently,

411
00:21:42,941 --> 00:21:44,274
but I can't.

412
00:21:44,276 --> 00:21:47,110
I need to train you
as I was trained.

413
00:21:47,112 --> 00:21:49,813
Treat you
as my student,

414
00:21:49,815 --> 00:21:52,282
not my daughter.

415
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,621
What are you doing?!

416
00:21:57,623 --> 00:22:01,625
The only way to forge steel is to
temper it with fire.

417
00:22:03,712 --> 00:22:07,297
Stay away from me,
you sick son of a bitch!

418
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:10,667
Now we can begin.

419
00:22:12,387 --> 00:22:15,255
Why didn't you call me sooner?
I could have helped.

420
00:22:15,257 --> 00:22:16,556
I didn't want you
to worry, Lyla.

421
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:17,891
Besides, I thought
we could handle it.

422
00:22:17,893 --> 00:22:19,309
Well, we've hacked
his email traffic.

423
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,665
He's got a buyer en route
to Corto Maltese.

424
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:21,268
Who?

425
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:23,056
The tech boys
are still working on that.

426
00:22:23,466 --> 00:22:25,682
But Waller's dispatched
a wet team to your position.

427
00:22:25,684 --> 00:22:27,184
They're not going
to get here in time.

428
00:22:27,186 --> 00:22:29,853
They might.
Keep your powder dry.

429
00:22:29,855 --> 00:22:31,622
Copy that.

430
00:22:33,442 --> 00:22:35,492
We're not going to
keep our powder dry.

431
00:22:35,494 --> 00:22:37,828
Hell no.

432
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:43,066
Hey.

433
00:22:43,068 --> 00:22:45,602
Any luck raising our digital Lazarus
from the dead?

434
00:22:45,604 --> 00:22:47,438
The hard drive
is toast.

435
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,039
And the power
supply.

436
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:51,375
And...the actuator.

437
00:22:51,377 --> 00:22:52,976
Ah, I'm sensing
a pattern.

438
00:22:52,978 --> 00:22:57,181
Sorry, one second.

439
00:22:57,183 --> 00:22:59,283
Hello?

440
00:22:59,285 --> 00:23:01,351
Hey, Felicity, this is John.
Where are you?

441
00:23:01,353 --> 00:23:03,687
You wouldn't
believe me if I told you.

442
00:23:03,689 --> 00:23:05,439
Are you near a computer?
Kind of.

443
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,390
I'm looking for somebody
in Corto Maltese.

444
00:23:07,393 --> 00:23:09,393
I'm actually a little bit
in the middle of a...

445
00:23:09,395 --> 00:23:10,477
I need to know where he is.

446
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,995
I've emailed you
everything I have on him.

447
00:23:11,997 --> 00:23:13,814
...meeting right now.

448
00:23:13,816 --> 00:23:16,233
I am so sorry.
It's a friend.

449
00:23:16,235 --> 00:23:18,619
Um, well,
a few friends...

450
00:23:18,621 --> 00:23:21,788
Actually. You know what,
it's a long story.

451
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,741
Heh. Why am I under the impression
that you have a lot of stories,

452
00:23:24,743 --> 00:23:27,411
all of which are long?

453
00:23:27,413 --> 00:23:28,412
You want me
to come back later?

454
00:23:28,414 --> 00:23:30,247
What? Sorry.

455
00:23:30,249 --> 00:23:31,999
Hello?

456
00:23:32,001 --> 00:23:33,250
Felicity, I need a favor.

457
00:23:33,252 --> 00:23:35,502
Are we favor
friends now?

458
00:23:35,504 --> 00:23:37,671
Are we friends?
What?

459
00:23:37,673 --> 00:23:39,456
Never mind, sorry.

460
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:42,092
Oh, dear god. One second.
One more second. Hello?

461
00:23:42,094 --> 00:23:43,343
We got cut off.

462
00:23:43,345 --> 00:23:44,661
According to the file
you sent me,

463
00:23:44,663 --> 00:23:46,713
this guy is somewhat
of a hacker.

464
00:23:46,715 --> 00:23:48,899
Let me guess--long story?

465
00:23:48,901 --> 00:23:51,051
Yeah, the guy I'm looking for broke
into A.R.G.U.S's system.

466
00:23:51,053 --> 00:23:52,936
And he left a trail.
It's faint--hacking-wise--

467
00:23:52,938 --> 00:23:55,689
but with a little bit
of luck, I will find him,

468
00:23:55,691 --> 00:23:58,942
or his laptop. I will email
you when I have something.

469
00:23:58,944 --> 00:24:01,578
I'm having
a bit of a day.

470
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,114
I need you to help me find someone
by googling his phone or something.

471
00:24:04,116 --> 00:24:06,083
Pinging his GPS.

472
00:24:06,085 --> 00:24:08,952
Can I call you back?

473
00:24:08,954 --> 00:24:11,088
Is this what a typical day
looks like for you?

474
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,725
Believe it or not, this is
better than most.

475
00:24:14,727 --> 00:24:17,211
When Felicity has Shaw's location,
I want you to text me and I'll be there.

476
00:24:17,213 --> 00:24:19,763
Thea?
Yeah.

477
00:24:19,765 --> 00:24:21,265
Oliver, I don't
think she's going

478
00:24:21,267 --> 00:24:22,966
to change her mind on this.
She doesn't want

479
00:24:22,968 --> 00:24:24,218
to hear from anyone,
and I don't blame her.

480
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,770
I mean, we both
lied to her. A lot.

481
00:24:26,772 --> 00:24:28,772
I know, it's why it's time
to tell her the truth.

482
00:24:28,774 --> 00:24:30,390
Oliver, when you say
"the truth"...

483
00:24:30,392 --> 00:24:32,226
What happened
the five years I was away,

484
00:24:32,228 --> 00:24:33,777
everything we've done since
I've been back,

485
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:35,862
all of it.

486
00:24:35,864 --> 00:24:37,397
Well, you might want
to think about that for a second.

487
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:38,782
Lies are what drove Thea
away from Starling City

488
00:24:38,784 --> 00:24:40,617
in the first place.

489
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:42,986
The truth is the only thing
that's going to bring her back.

490
00:24:42,988 --> 00:24:45,122
Except you won't be
telling her the truth, will you?

491
00:24:45,124 --> 00:24:47,958
You'll be telling her that her brother
has been lying to her to her face,

492
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,327
with almost
pathological sincerity

493
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:51,712
for the past two years.

494
00:24:51,714 --> 00:24:53,997
She won't believe
another word you say.

495
00:24:53,999 --> 00:24:56,166
And you will lose her,
Oliver, forever.

496
00:24:56,168 --> 00:24:59,720
Well, look around.

497
00:24:59,722 --> 00:25:02,055
I've already
lost her.

498
00:25:02,057 --> 00:25:04,641
I don't have
any other choice.

499
00:25:22,027 --> 00:25:24,611
I hear you like
to hit women.

500
00:25:24,613 --> 00:25:26,780
How about one
who likes to hit back?

501
00:25:33,756 --> 00:25:37,708
You're right.
It's better when they hit back.

502
00:25:58,678 --> 00:26:00,845
Baby, baby,
are you ok?

503
00:26:00,847 --> 00:26:03,364
I'm so sorry.

504
00:26:03,366 --> 00:26:06,383
I'm too relieved to be mad at you,
I really am.

505
00:26:06,385 --> 00:26:10,805
But, sweetheart...

506
00:26:10,807 --> 00:26:13,040
This is crazy.

507
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:14,375
What the hell
were you thinking

508
00:26:14,377 --> 00:26:16,544
going after that
girl's boyfriend?

509
00:26:16,546 --> 00:26:19,363
There's just something
I needed to work out.

510
00:26:19,365 --> 00:26:22,450
I know that the world
isn't fair.

511
00:26:22,452 --> 00:26:26,237
I know that it's
a terrible place where...

512
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:29,406
where people deserve
to get punished.

513
00:26:29,408 --> 00:26:32,660
And they don't. I just...

514
00:26:36,282 --> 00:26:38,916
For one night,

515
00:26:38,918 --> 00:26:40,968
I needed the world
to be different.

516
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:44,572
Ok, Laurel,
Laurel...

517
00:26:44,574 --> 00:26:46,390
What's going on
with you, huh?

518
00:26:46,392 --> 00:26:47,925
You're not being
yourself lately.

519
00:26:47,927 --> 00:26:49,510
And now you're
running around,

520
00:26:49,512 --> 00:26:53,097
you're tuning this guy up.
What are you doin'?!

521
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:55,149
Baby, you can talk to me
about anything.

522
00:26:55,151 --> 00:26:57,184
You know that,
right? You know that.

523
00:26:57,186 --> 00:26:59,770
I know.

524
00:27:03,075 --> 00:27:05,826
Talk to me, then.

525
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,758
Laurel, you're not
the arrow.

526
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,127
Or your sister.

527
00:27:25,882 --> 00:27:28,799
You promise me you'll never
do anything like this again, ever!

528
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:31,969
I promise.

529
00:27:31,971 --> 00:27:35,940
It was a mistake;
I wasn't thinking.

530
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:49,736
If you want to stay
in Corto Maltese, it's fine,

531
00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:51,789
but there's not much
here in the way of sightseeing.

532
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:53,407
I need to talk to you.

533
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:55,859
Look, between you
and your new best friend Roy,

534
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:57,561
I'm pretty sure you guys have
said everything.

535
00:27:57,563 --> 00:27:59,947
I haven't.

536
00:27:59,949 --> 00:28:02,232
Not yet, anyway.

537
00:28:06,038 --> 00:28:08,705
Roy showed me
the note you left him.

538
00:28:08,707 --> 00:28:10,791
And you were right
about everything.

539
00:28:10,793 --> 00:28:13,827
I have lied,
I have kept secrets.

540
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:16,380
The truth is that

541
00:28:16,382 --> 00:28:18,498
if I tell you...

542
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,168
All the things that you don't
know about me,

543
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:24,504
that I might
lose you forever.

544
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:27,891
I spent five years
in the worst kind of hell,

545
00:28:27,893 --> 00:28:30,844
and there were
things that happened,

546
00:28:30,846 --> 00:28:35,766
there were things
that I did...

547
00:28:35,768 --> 00:28:37,484
That if--

548
00:28:37,486 --> 00:28:39,686
if you knew,

549
00:28:39,688 --> 00:28:41,772
you would see me
differently.

550
00:28:41,774 --> 00:28:45,492
No, I'll always
see you as my big brother.

551
00:28:45,494 --> 00:28:47,911
I mean, no matter
what happened

552
00:28:47,913 --> 00:28:51,999
to you on that island,
or who you became,

553
00:28:52,001 --> 00:28:56,670
it's the secrets you kept
about my own life.

554
00:28:58,624 --> 00:29:01,792
I mean, you lied to me

555
00:29:01,794 --> 00:29:04,795
about who my father was.

556
00:29:08,434 --> 00:29:12,352
Malcolm may have
been your blood.

557
00:29:12,354 --> 00:29:15,055
Robert was
your father.

558
00:29:19,028 --> 00:29:21,812
I lied to you
about him, too.

559
00:29:21,814 --> 00:29:25,065
Dad wasn't the man
we thought he was.

560
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:27,951
He was better.

561
00:29:27,953 --> 00:29:31,788
And I've kept something from you
because I just...

562
00:29:34,043 --> 00:29:37,044
Never wanted you
to know.

563
00:29:39,131 --> 00:29:42,382
Dad made it off
"The Gambit" with me.

564
00:29:42,384 --> 00:29:45,585
You told me he drowned.

565
00:29:45,587 --> 00:29:49,172
We made it to
a life boat together.

566
00:29:49,174 --> 00:29:52,426
There wasn't enough
food and water for both of us...

567
00:29:54,263 --> 00:29:56,730
So he killed
himself.

568
00:29:59,652 --> 00:30:03,437
And that is one secret
that I'm telling you now

569
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:06,740
because I need you
to realize...

570
00:30:06,742 --> 00:30:10,077
mom and dad,

571
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:12,913
they sacrificed
themselves

572
00:30:12,915 --> 00:30:15,449
so that
we could live.

573
00:30:15,451 --> 00:30:19,202
But if we're not
together, then...

574
00:30:19,204 --> 00:30:21,688
we're not even
really alive.

575
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,374
You're my family.

576
00:30:24,376 --> 00:30:27,044
And even if you
don't need me...

577
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:30,964
I need you.

578
00:30:32,518 --> 00:30:36,770
Please just consider
what I'm saying.

579
00:30:49,385 --> 00:30:51,618
He's here.

580
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,286
So's his buyer.

581
00:31:03,031 --> 00:31:04,831
I was expecting
Armitage.

582
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:08,051
This country's soil
is not worthy of Mr. Armitage.

583
00:31:08,053 --> 00:31:09,886
Do you have the item?

584
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:13,206
Where's the money?

585
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,679
And the transcoder?

586
00:31:30,526 --> 00:31:33,460
We better go.

587
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,837
Where'd you get this?

588
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:48,341
Our hotel room.

589
00:31:54,183 --> 00:31:56,216
Who are they?

590
00:31:56,218 --> 00:31:58,251
Could be A.R.G.U.S.

591
00:32:00,389 --> 00:32:02,189
That's not A.R.G.U.S.

592
00:32:09,195 --> 00:32:11,533
Suelten sus armas!
Let's go.

593
00:32:16,327 --> 00:32:17,644
Go!

594
00:32:26,788 --> 00:32:28,921
A.R.G.U.S., they
know we're here.

595
00:32:28,923 --> 00:32:31,040
Which is why I got a bunch
of renta-soldiers to secure the perimeter.

596
00:32:31,042 --> 00:32:32,758
It's amazing how cheap
you can buy an army

597
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,410
for in this country.

598
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,937
Diggle!
Behind you!

599
00:32:52,196 --> 00:32:54,814
I never said I didn't know
how to use a gun.

600
00:33:56,711 --> 00:33:58,177
Lyla was your friend!

601
00:33:58,179 --> 00:34:00,462
And you endangered
her and her daughter

602
00:34:00,464 --> 00:34:02,631
for what, for a lousy payday!

603
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:04,850
Not a payday.
It's my ticket out.

604
00:34:04,852 --> 00:34:07,469
Of what?
A.R.G.U.S.!

605
00:34:07,471 --> 00:34:10,272
You don't know the things Waller's
made me do.

606
00:34:10,274 --> 00:34:13,108
The person
she turns you into.

607
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,810
That still gives you no right

608
00:34:14,812 --> 00:34:17,363
to put a bulls-eye
on my family's back!

609
00:34:17,365 --> 00:34:19,198
I had no choice.

610
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,483
But you do, John.

611
00:34:21,485 --> 00:34:23,886
Tell Waller I died.

612
00:34:23,888 --> 00:34:25,955
Tell her you put
a bullet in me.

613
00:34:29,377 --> 00:34:32,261
If only.

614
00:34:32,263 --> 00:34:34,029
I've been thinking.

615
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:37,883
I want to go home.
To my brother.

616
00:34:37,885 --> 00:34:39,752
And all his lies
and secrets?

617
00:34:39,754 --> 00:34:42,004
Maybe you haven't come
as far as I thought.

618
00:34:42,006 --> 00:34:44,039
Let me prove it to you.

619
00:35:07,365 --> 00:35:08,914
Impressive.

620
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:14,286
I had a good teacher.

621
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:24,096
Looks like
you're going home.

622
00:35:33,774 --> 00:35:36,392
You let me win,
didn't you?

623
00:35:36,394 --> 00:35:38,944
I'll be seeing you soon.

624
00:35:38,946 --> 00:35:40,980
Safe flight.

625
00:35:51,574 --> 00:35:53,992
Thank you.
Yeah.

626
00:35:57,464 --> 00:35:59,797
You ok?

627
00:36:01,751 --> 00:36:04,719
She's not coming.

628
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,725
I'm sorry, Oliver.
You did everything you could, man.

629
00:36:13,229 --> 00:36:15,163
Oliver...

630
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,107
I'm glad you changed
your mind.

631
00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:29,577
Still not sure about flying
commercial, though.

632
00:36:31,181 --> 00:36:32,580
Oh!

633
00:36:36,036 --> 00:36:38,703
Thea,
are you ok?

634
00:36:38,705 --> 00:36:41,589
Yeah. I'm fine.

635
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,620
Laurel?

636
00:36:55,592 --> 00:36:57,742
I didn't know the Arrow
took vacations.

637
00:36:57,744 --> 00:36:59,760
Hey! What happened?

638
00:36:59,762 --> 00:37:01,229
I'm fine. Please.

639
00:37:01,231 --> 00:37:03,848
What happened?

640
00:37:04,984 --> 00:37:06,734
I tried to do good.

641
00:37:06,736 --> 00:37:08,686
It didn't work out.

642
00:37:08,688 --> 00:37:10,071
Oh, Laurel.

643
00:37:10,073 --> 00:37:13,908
I know that
it probably sounds insane.

644
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:17,078
It probably is, but...

645
00:37:18,665 --> 00:37:20,448
Sara.

646
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:23,000
She gave me this.

647
00:37:23,002 --> 00:37:24,285
And when I wear it,
it makes me want

648
00:37:24,287 --> 00:37:27,171
to help people
like she did.

649
00:37:27,173 --> 00:37:29,207
Like she's alive again.

650
00:37:29,209 --> 00:37:31,209
I get it.

651
00:37:33,012 --> 00:37:35,630
Sara had training.

652
00:37:35,632 --> 00:37:37,265
She had years--

653
00:37:37,267 --> 00:37:40,434
Oliver, I know.

654
00:37:40,436 --> 00:37:43,221
Which is why
I need to start,

655
00:37:43,223 --> 00:37:45,473
and I need
your help.

656
00:37:49,896 --> 00:37:52,063
No.

657
00:37:52,065 --> 00:37:54,649
Oliver!

658
00:37:54,651 --> 00:37:55,950
No!

659
00:37:55,952 --> 00:37:58,286
No.

660
00:37:58,288 --> 00:38:00,621
I...

661
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:05,876
I want you
to consider

662
00:38:05,878 --> 00:38:09,213
what would happen
to your father

663
00:38:09,215 --> 00:38:11,832
if something
happened to you.

664
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:14,719
Oliver, ever sense
it happened,

665
00:38:14,721 --> 00:38:16,721
I have had this fire
inside of me

666
00:38:16,723 --> 00:38:20,091
that I can't get rid of
with booze or pills.

667
00:38:20,093 --> 00:38:21,726
I need another way!

668
00:38:21,728 --> 00:38:24,979
And the other night,
even though it went wrong

669
00:38:24,981 --> 00:38:26,681
it was the first time
since Sara died

670
00:38:26,683 --> 00:38:28,532
where I haven't felt that fire.

671
00:38:28,534 --> 00:38:31,168
I'm sorry,
but I can't.

672
00:38:32,989 --> 00:38:35,523
And even if I could,

673
00:38:35,525 --> 00:38:38,659
Sara would never
forgive me.

674
00:38:55,962 --> 00:38:58,929
Yeah.

675
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:05,303
Hey.

676
00:39:05,305 --> 00:39:07,555
Love you.
I love you both.

677
00:39:07,557 --> 00:39:09,807
The two of you
were all I could think about.

678
00:39:12,612 --> 00:39:15,980
I'm just trying
to put her down.

679
00:39:15,982 --> 00:39:19,317
That's ok, I just
want to look at her for a while.

680
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:21,485
Ok.

681
00:39:21,487 --> 00:39:23,954
I have to head
into the office.

682
00:39:23,956 --> 00:39:25,573
So late?

683
00:39:25,575 --> 00:39:28,459
I do whatever Amanda Waller
asks, remember?

684
00:39:32,799 --> 00:39:35,716
You ok?

685
00:39:37,387 --> 00:39:40,137
Yeah.
Just hurry back.

686
00:39:41,724 --> 00:39:44,058
What's with this guy?

687
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:47,228
Outstanding warrants
for assault and battery in Coast City.

688
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:50,181
Got an anonymous tip
he was in Starling.

689
00:39:50,183 --> 00:39:52,817
Anonymous tip, huh?

690
00:39:52,819 --> 00:39:56,153
That's a bad break,
buddy.

691
00:40:13,005 --> 00:40:15,539
All right.
When can I start?

692
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,713
Do you know how many
of QC's techs

693
00:40:22,715 --> 00:40:25,633
said this data
was unrecoverable?

694
00:40:25,635 --> 00:40:27,551
Only all of them.

695
00:40:27,553 --> 00:40:32,623
Seems like this would be a good time
to ask for a few days off, then.

696
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:34,024
You
just started.

697
00:40:34,026 --> 00:40:37,061
I know. But...my friend
was struck by lightning

698
00:40:37,063 --> 00:40:38,979
and is in a coma.

699
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:41,282
Well, was.

700
00:40:41,284 --> 00:40:43,951
I don't know. Um, it's--

701
00:40:43,953 --> 00:40:45,403
A long story.

702
00:40:46,522 --> 00:40:48,622
See ya.

703
00:40:48,624 --> 00:40:50,791
Thanks.

704
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:19,487
You did good
over there.

705
00:41:19,489 --> 00:41:22,189
I had a good teacher.

706
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:25,493
A judgmental, occasionally
temperamental one, but...

707
00:41:25,495 --> 00:41:28,579
Those are
the best kind.

708
00:41:30,983 --> 00:41:34,752
Did Thea seem...
different to you?

709
00:41:34,754 --> 00:41:36,420
Her hair's a lot shorter.

710
00:41:36,422 --> 00:41:39,273
But that's not what you mean.

711
00:41:39,275 --> 00:41:40,708
What do you mean?

712
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,426
I don't know.

713
00:41:42,428 --> 00:41:44,628
She say anything?

714
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,880
She may be...

715
00:41:45,882 --> 00:41:48,682
seeing somebody in
Corto Maltese, or...

716
00:41:48,684 --> 00:41:51,435
If Thea was with anybody else,
I've got a feeling

717
00:41:51,437 --> 00:41:52,803
I'd be the last one to know.

718
00:41:54,941 --> 00:41:57,775
Where is she?

719
00:41:57,777 --> 00:41:59,360
Where is Sara?

720
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:08,152
