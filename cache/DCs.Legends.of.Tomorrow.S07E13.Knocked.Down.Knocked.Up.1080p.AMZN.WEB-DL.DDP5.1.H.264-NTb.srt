Maybe he saved Alun,

160
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:29,927
didn't screw up the time line,
had a happy ending.

161
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:31,668
That's one possibility.

162
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:33,583
Okay, well,
out with it, Gary.

163
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:36,978
Well, before computer Gideon
pooped me out

164
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:38,849
into caveman times,
girlfriend Gideon

165
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:40,329
brought up an interesting fact.

166
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:44,289
Alun's death is a fixed point,

167
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,510
and Gwyn has no idea
he'll be facing its fixer.

168
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:49,730
Oh, sorry.
Excuse me, excuse me.

The Fixer got him.

00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:48,092
No.

Gwyn is one of us.

We can't just let this

I have this.

I know, I know,
I know, I know, I know.

Just, you never know when you
have to get away from the paps

00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:08,417
or travel through time
to save a friend.

186
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,462
Sorry.
I know.

187
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:12,508
Yeah, sorry's right.

188
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,162
We have to save Gwyn.

189
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:19,167
You're not actually planning

190
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,908
on going on this mission,
right?

191
00:09:20,951 --> 00:09:23,954
Gary, I might be retired,
but I'm still a Legend.

192
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:26,957
Well, yeah,
but now you're a...

193
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:29,307
pregnant Legend.

194
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:32,267
What are you talking about?

195
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,182
Oh, did you look
in that envelope?

196
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:35,792
Those are for Ava,

197
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:37,620
and we haven't even
started trying, all right?

198
00:09:37,664 --> 00:09:39,404
You sure about that?

199
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:41,755
Yes, I'm sure.
I'm not pregnant.

200
00:09:41,798 --> 00:09:43,626
It's biologically impossible.

201
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,933
Well, according
to human biology,

202
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:48,109
but your pheromones
are through the roof,

203
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:49,893
according
to my Necrian olfactory glands.

204
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:51,329
So it's a fact.

205
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:54,724
You are knocked up.

206
00:09:57,988 --> 00:10:00,208
Are you being serious
right now?

207
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:01,339
Yes.

208
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:03,515
- I'm pregnant?
- Mm-hmm.

209
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,517
You're 100% certain
I'm pregnant.

210
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:07,824
I'm pregnant, pregnant?
- Oh, yeah.

211
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,740
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

212
00:10:10,784 --> 00:10:12,742
This is--this is
not the plan, Gary.

213
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:14,178
I can't be--I
can't be pregnant.

214
00:10:14,222 --> 00:10:15,223
I'm not supposed to be
the pregnant one.

215
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:16,572
This--
- Shh.

216
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,443
It's okay.
Here, sit down, sit down.

217
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:21,533
Shh.
Deep breaths.

218
00:10:22,883 --> 00:10:24,928
Something must've
triggered you to ovulate.

219
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:26,626
You're half-Kriblix,
and trust me,

220
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:28,366
Kriblixes are,
by nature, nesters,

221
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,977
which is what you and Ava
were doing.

222
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,935
All it takes for
the egg to drop

223
00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:35,112
is just mere thought of a baby.

224
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:37,767
And then all you need is your
partner's DNA to fertilize it.

225
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:39,290
Like kissing?

226
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:41,249
You guys don't use
protection for that?

227
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:44,295
No, Gary.
No, no, no, no, no.

228
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,602
We are about to face
a fixed point.

229
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,125
I cannot be pregnant.

230
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:49,779
Okay.

231
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:52,390
Okay, you know what,
two minutes ago...

232
00:10:52,434 --> 00:10:53,870
I didn't even know

233
00:10:53,914 --> 00:10:55,480
that I was pregnant, right?
So you know what

234
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:56,699
we're gonna do?
We're just gonna--

235
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:58,396
we're gonna rewind this. Whoo.

236
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,876
I don't know
that I'm pregnant, right?

237
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,010
No one knows that
I am pregnant, understood?

238
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:04,446
Uh-huh.

239
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:06,317
All right, so

240
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:10,234
back to the mission
to save Gwyn.

241
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:12,672
Yeah, and protect the baby.

242
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:16,066
My God, I'm pregnant.

243
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:25,206
No Fixer, no Gideons.

244
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:27,991
Ah, this mission
is gonna be a cinch.

245
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:30,211
- Damn it.
- Are you out of your mind?

246
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:33,083
- We're officially jinxed.
- I appreciated the positivity.

247
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:34,476
Okay, thank you so much.
You can both shut up.

248
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:35,912
All right.

249
00:11:35,956 --> 00:11:38,001
We're here a couple hours
before sunrise,

250
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:39,960
but we don't want to attract
the attention of the Fixer.

251
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:41,526
Let's find some shelter.

252
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,702
That way.

253
00:11:44,573 --> 00:11:47,402
All right, well, this will work
for a base of operations.

254
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:49,143
Sweep the area.
Keep your eyes peeled

255
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:50,797
for the Fixer
or Evil Waverider.

256
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,189
Like I'm going to land it

257
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:53,625
in the middle
of a bloody battlefield.

258
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:55,758
- Gideon?
- The deal we made was that

259
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:57,717
you would give up
time travel forever.

260
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,588
You aren't supposed to be here.

261
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:01,285
Yeah, well,
Gwyn's not supposed to be dead.

262
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:04,854
He should've been content
with what I gave him.

263
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:07,422
This was cleaner,
the way it was meant to happen.

264
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:09,816
Who cares about what
was meant to happen?

265
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:11,208
I'm supposed to be in hell.

266
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:12,775
You are supposed to be
a machine.

267
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:14,255
We're all from
different time lines, Gideon.

268
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:15,778
And what?
Now suddenly you decide

269
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:17,475
to start following
the letter of the law?

270
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,955
It's my job,

271
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:21,044
a job that I took
to save your lives.

272
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:24,352
I sacrificed my own future so
that you could all enjoy yours,

273
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:26,093
and this is how you repay me.

274
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:28,617
You've sold us
a bag of false goods, Giddy.

275
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,793
In partnership with my AI,

276
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:32,882
I'm incapable
of making mistakes.

277
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:35,972
So Gary got shot out
the airlock intentionally.

278
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:37,060
What?

279
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,933
I thought you left.

280
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:43,110
Oh, you mean you didn't know.

281
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:45,112
I'm sure my AI
had her reasons.

282
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:47,636
For trying to kill me?

283
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,420
That's the problem
with you Legends.

284
00:12:49,464 --> 00:12:51,509
You've always taken everything
so damn personally.

285
00:12:51,553 --> 00:12:54,164
You know what you sound like?
A computer.

286
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,210
And I had finally
convinced myself

287
00:12:56,253 --> 00:12:58,560
that you were a real human.

288
00:12:58,603 --> 00:13:00,344
I guess I was wrong.

289
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:07,221
<i>♪</i>

290
00:13:10,137 --> 00:13:12,356
- You okay?
- Why wouldn't I be?

291
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,010
I was a queen of hell.

292
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:15,925
Clearly, the apple
didn't fall far from the tree.

293
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:17,753
Gideon was acting tough,

294
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,843
but I could tell, deep down,
that she was conflicted.

295
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:22,932
You should talk to her.

296
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:24,891
Whoever that person was,
I didn't recognize her.

297
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:26,849
She's still our Gideon.
Okay?

298
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:29,069
We just need to get through to
her before she's too far gone.

299
00:13:29,112 --> 00:13:31,071
She's right.

300
00:13:31,114 --> 00:13:32,986
If we want any chance
of succeeding with Alun,

301
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:35,075
we have to get Gideon
back on our side.

302
00:13:35,118 --> 00:13:38,034
Here, it has enough charge
for one trip.

303
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:40,732
Go get our girl back.

304
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:44,214
Why didn't you tell me
that you tried to kill Gary?

305
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:45,825
<i>He survived?</i>

emotionally entangled,
and not just with Gary?

313

Seeing the Legends again,
as infuriating as they can be,

314
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:03,625
it just--it--it

Who am I, Gideon?

323
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:35,004
<i>I have an answer for you,</i> <i>
Captain.</i>

324
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:36,484
<i>It's in the lab.</i>

325
00:14:47,712 --> 00:14:49,410

to hold onto those

335
00:15:09,821 --> 00:15:11,867

feels to have everyone hate me?

336

344
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:44,117

345

346

- What the hell?
- I'm sorry I pushed you.

347

I panicked.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

My plan, it was--
it was foolproof.

354
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:12,232
I placed a robot in the woods

Alun is dead, while the real
Alun sleeps through the battle

356
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:17,019
and is swept away by me-me.
- Uh-huh.

357
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:19,239
Gwyn, did your plan
factor in the fact

358
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:22,024

00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,882
Yeah.
Call me Mike.

475
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:02,059
Who's hungry?

476
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,411
Oh, my God.

477
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,284
Is he--oh, God.
I thought he was dead.

478
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,591
He's just frozen.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

479
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:13,636
He's dead.
Yeah, uh,

480
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,377
he had a heart attack
this morning,

481
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:17,118
and he's not gonna be found
until tonight.

482
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:20,208
I figured, why let
his accommodations go to waste?

483
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:21,775
'Cause according to
the general,

484
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:23,342
the Schwarzwalder Schinken

485
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,126
is to die for.

486
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:27,302
Actually, Mike,
we are in a rush.

487
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,869
You see we are--

488
00:22:28,912 --> 00:22:31,132
The Legends of Tomorrow, yes.
I know this.

489
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:32,307
Huh?
How?

490
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,787
I'm from the future.

491
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,484
Sorry, I know.
I know we're in a rush,

492
00:22:35,528 --> 00:22:37,312
but I have to ask.

493
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,314
Are we super famous
in the future?

494

Zari Tarazi?

495
00:22:40,968 --> 00:22:42,404
Oh, yeah.

496
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:44,145
I know you know my name
but do you know--

497
00:22:44,188 --> 00:22:46,582
Are you kidding me?
Sara Lance, Ava,

498
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:51,413
Behrad, Nate DO-double G.
What's up, Gary?

499
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:53,372
Oh, you know Gary?

500
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,243
I know all of you guys,
are you kidding me?

501
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:56,418
Except him.
I don't know him.

502
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:59,247
Oh, I am Dr. Gwyn Davies.

503
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,553
Very pleased to
make your acquaintance, sir.

504
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:02,598
Gwyn invented time travel.

505
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,514
- You're that guy?
- Yeah.

506
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:07,211
Oh, wow.
My bad.

507
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:08,474
I thought you were
just some random time bandit.

508
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:10,606
Okay.
Okay.

509
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,782
All right, Legends.

510
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:14,305
What brings you
to my neck of the woods?

511
00:23:14,349 --> 00:23:16,133
Uh, long story.

512
00:23:16,177 --> 00:23:19,136
Younger Gwyn is part of
the doomed 38th Welsh Division.

513
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,791
And today his boyfriend,
Alun, is gonna die.

514
00:23:21,835 --> 00:23:24,054
Which is why Gwyn goes on
to invent time travel.

515
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:25,099
So he can come back here
and save Alun.

516
00:23:25,142 --> 00:23:26,492
But he failed.

517
00:23:26,535 --> 00:23:28,407
But our Gwyn
is gonna succeed.

518
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,321
Yes, by replacing the real
Alun with a fake one, you see?

519
00:23:30,365 --> 00:23:31,540
So the rest of the time loop

520
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,933
can go on
like it's supposed to.

521
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:34,456
Does that all make sense,
Mike?

522
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,459
Not in the least.
Look, you guys are great,

523
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:39,505
and I mean this
from the bottom of my heart--

524
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:41,550
I'm a huge fan--
but the people who put me here

525
00:23:41,594 --> 00:23:44,858
were pretty specific
about my duties as a Fixer.

526
00:23:44,901 --> 00:23:47,687
I'm supposed to make sure
poet dude dies every cycle.

527
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,298
Anyone interferes,
they get fixed.

528
00:23:50,341 --> 00:23:51,821
That's just how it goes,
I'm sorry.

529
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:54,476
Now hold on just a second.

530
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,479
Now, you are here
to protect the events

531
00:23:57,523 --> 00:23:59,612
that led to the creation
of time travel itself, correct?

532
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:01,396
Yeah, man.
I'm the best.

533
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,180
That's why they put me here.
- Answer me this, then.

534
00:24:03,224 --> 00:24:05,356
If a time traveler were
to come here with the express

535
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,750
intention of erasing
the very invention

536
00:24:07,794 --> 00:24:09,622
of time travel itself
from history--

537
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:11,058
They would disappear
before they had the chance.

538
00:24:11,101 --> 00:24:12,538
- Precisely.
- It's a paradox.

539
00:24:12,581 --> 00:24:14,191
- A paradox.
- So what you're telling me

540
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:17,456
is that this fixed point
could actually fix itself?

541
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:20,067
Theoretically, yes,
because how else

542
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,199
would the other time travelers
get here?

543
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:26,290
Excuse me one second.

544
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:28,684
That's why nobody
ever comes here.

545
00:24:28,728 --> 00:24:31,339
I thought it was because,
you know, people were scared

546
00:24:31,382 --> 00:24:33,384
that they would have to run
into me, and nobody wants

547
00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:34,995
to come at me.
I'm the best, right?

548
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:36,779
But no,
it's because no time traveler

549
00:24:36,823 --> 00:24:39,478
in their right mind
would ever come to this event.

550
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,218
Precisely.

551
00:24:41,262 --> 00:24:43,525
Those dicks put me here
as a joke.

552
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:44,744
They did.
No, they did!

553
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:46,180
- No.
- I've been played.

554
00:24:46,223 --> 00:24:48,443
I got played.

Hey, listen,
we just need your help.

557
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:57,365
How long until
the battle starts?

558
00:24:57,408 --> 00:24:59,280
There's an hour before
the shelling starts.

559
00:24:59,323 --> 00:25:02,370
Then Alun's division gets
pinned down in no man's land.

560
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:04,459
And then that's when Mike
is gonna freeze time.

561
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,330

and we all know how lucky that
we have been with robots.

So, yes.

00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:22,387
So this is the end
of the road.

796
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,823
End of this road.

797
00:38:23,866 --> 00:38:26,304
I'll tell the ancestors
you said, "hey."

798
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:28,741
Sure, but also tell them
not to wait up.

799
00:38:28,784 --> 00:38:30,133
Here.

800
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:31,483
Since you're gonna
live there now,

801
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:33,485
it's only right
that you have it.

802
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:36,052
- Are you sure?
- I am.

803
00:38:37,576 --> 00:38:39,012
I'm good with it.

804
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:47,542
And you two...

805
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:50,328
that's going to be
one lucky ninja baby.

806
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:52,417
Yeah.

807
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,332
Love you guys.

808
00:38:57,422 --> 00:38:58,771
Later, Legends.

809
00:39:09,129 --> 00:39:11,305
Hey, hey, hey.

810
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,612
Hey, it's gonna be all right.

811
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,833
When is this madness
going to end?

812
00:39:19,095 --> 00:39:22,969
What if I were to introduce
you to a new kind of madness?

813
00:39:23,012 --> 00:39:25,363
Wait, so you want us
to go back to Texas

814
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:26,668
after everything we did
to get out of there?

815
00:39:26,712 --> 00:39:28,409
I mean, come on, y'all.

816
00:39:28,453 --> 00:39:30,193
My mom would be pretty psyched
to have us all back.

817
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:32,195
Except we're trapped in 1916,

818
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,632
which is nine years
before we left.

819
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:35,329
Not to mention
we have a world war

820
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,157
and an ocean separating us.
- Oh, what if I were

821
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,768
to tell you that time and space
are of no matter to us?

822
00:39:39,812 --> 00:39:41,422
Yes.
You know what?

823
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:43,381
We will build
a new time machine,

824
00:39:43,424 --> 00:39:46,296
and that should take what?
Roughly--

825
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,255
- Six months max.
- Six months.

826
00:39:48,298 --> 00:39:50,300
Who needs a stupid Waverider?

827
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:57,569
I need a stupid Waverider.

828
00:39:57,612 --> 00:40:00,180
- He's back.
- I knew I liked that guy.

829
00:40:02,878 --> 00:40:04,445
Uh, where the hell
have you two been?

830
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:06,447
both: Foraging.

831
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:10,190
Welcome home.

832
00:40:10,233 --> 00:40:12,148
Yeah, so I've been thinking
about colors for the nursery.

833
00:40:12,192 --> 00:40:14,324
- Yeah?
- You built all this for me?

834
00:40:14,368 --> 00:40:15,761
Well, in a way.

835
00:40:15,804 --> 00:40:16,805
My machine was
a little more spartan,

836
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:18,459
but yes, I did.

837
00:40:18,503 --> 00:40:20,374
I can't wait
to fabricate some ribs.

838
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,767
First dibs on the shower.

839
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,508
We should collab
more often, sis.

840
00:40:23,551 --> 00:40:25,771
Yeah, I'm not gonna make
children's music with you.

841
00:40:25,814 --> 00:40:27,816
I wonder if there's
chocolate sauce on board?

842
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,950
Oh, Gary.

843
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:35,998
Huh, you have something
you want to say to us, Mike?

844
00:40:36,042 --> 00:40:37,957
Yeah, I apologize.

845
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,915
I may have acted
a bit impulsive.

846
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:43,484
- You stole our ship.
- I did, but to be fair,

847
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:45,051
I just found out
that my job was pointless.

848
00:40:45,094 --> 00:40:46,835
And then this big,
beautiful time ship

849
00:40:46,879 --> 00:40:49,011
showed up out of nowhere.
It landed right in front of me.

850
00:40:49,055 --> 00:40:51,274
What did you expect me to do?
- Well, I certainly wouldn't

851
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:54,016
have abandoned my new allies
in their time of need.

852
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,105
I know,
but I had things to do.

853
00:40:56,149 --> 00:40:59,587
You know, I had people to see,
people to save,

854
00:40:59,631 --> 00:41:01,284
adventures to be had.

855
00:41:01,328 --> 00:41:03,069
You know, I got a rep
to protect, guys.

856
00:41:03,112 --> 00:41:04,505
I'm sorry.

857
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:06,028
What's with
the aggressive jewelry?

858
00:41:06,072 --> 00:41:08,553
Oh, this?
You like?

859
00:41:08,596 --> 00:41:10,555
Good, because you're all
about to get your very own.

860
00:41:10,598 --> 00:41:13,122
Guys, come on out!
The Legends are here.

861
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:14,384
It's a setup.

862
00:41:14,428 --> 00:41:16,430
Oh, my God.
What is this?

863
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,953
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

864
00:41:17,997 --> 00:41:19,825
On the floor, Legends.
You are all under arrest.

865
00:41:19,868 --> 00:41:22,436
- The hell we are.
- Spooner, put the gun down.

866
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,221
Who the hell are you?
Why are you arresting us?

867
00:41:25,265 --> 00:41:27,789
For time crimes, duh.

868
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:29,530
That's enough out of you, Buster.

869
00:41:29,574 --> 00:41:31,532
Hey, it's Booster.

870
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:34,013
I'm Booster Gold, okay?

871
00:41:34,056 --> 00:41:36,668
Yo, dude--ow, man.

872
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:41,020
Mike--Booster--
what the hell is this?

873
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:43,022
I hope you don't have
any plans for the near future,

874
00:41:43,065 --> 00:41:45,546
because we're about to spend
a lot of time together...

875
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,156
in jail.

876
