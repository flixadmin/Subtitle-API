1
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,146
Hey.

2
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:26,442
You....

3
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:28,778
You selling?

4
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,572
I don't know
what you're talking about.

5
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,991
Okay. That's cool.

6
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:40,498
I'm just saying, you know,
if you were selling...

7
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,209
...I could maybe do with a teenth.

8
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,797
You're kidding, right?

9
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:51,134
Dude, I so smell bacon.

10
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,636
What? What are you talking about?

11
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,513
Oh, gee, I don't know.

12
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:58,558
How about over there.
That brown van.

13
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:00,935
That's yours, right?

14
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,062
What brown van?

15
00:01:03,312 --> 00:01:05,439
Parked all inconspicuous.

16
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,733
It's a cop van.

17
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:10,987
Yeah, another one right over there.

18
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,448
"Duke City Flowers"? Come on.

19
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,701
Can't you at least be original?

20
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:19,328
Dude, I just wanna get high.

21
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,747
A flower van.

22
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:25,084
You know what you should do
is a garbage truck.

23
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,253
Seriously, and I don't mean
to disrespect...

24
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,047
...but if you put cops
in the back of a garbage truck...

25
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,341
...there's no way
I'm seriously thinking...

26
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,845
...that there's cops
in the back of a garbage truck.

27
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:38,681
It's a freebie, yo. Just think about it.

28
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,058
Think about it, boys.

29
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:45,104
All right. I'm hitting it.

30
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,773
You dudes give up that easy?

31
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,984
I'm not a cop.

32
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:54,155
Then lift your shirt.
Show me you're not wearing a wire.

33
00:01:55,948 --> 00:01:57,408
All right, you know what?

34
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,411
Just to show you
you're being an asshole.

35
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,705
I'm blinded by white.

36
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:03,915
Douchebag.

37
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:06,626
Come on. I was joking. Come on.

38
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:10,213
Don't walk away angry.
Sit down. Come on.

39
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,716
I mean, what are you
complaining about?

40
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,177
You got abs, man. Kind of.

41
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:18,262
Whatever, dude.

42
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,181
I'm not even sure
I wanna buy anymore.

43
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:23,059
I think you turned me off
to the whole thing.

44
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:25,311
Come on. Don't be like that.

45
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,731
I just need you to prove it,
you know?

46
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,441
Prove you're not a cop.

47
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,361
How the hell
am I supposed to do that?

48
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,905
I don't know.

49
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:40,493
Hey, I got it. Go over there
and punch that dude right in the face.

50
00:02:40,701 --> 00:02:42,453
Which dude?

51
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,913
-That dude?
-Yeah.

52
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:46,582
No way. He'd kick my ass.

53
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,085
True that.

54
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,714
-This is so hard, you know?
-Yeah.

55
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,052
I know.

56
00:02:58,302 --> 00:03:00,096
It's simple.

57
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:04,767
If you ask a cop if he's a cop,
he's, like, obligated to tell you.

58
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,853
It's in the Constitution.

59
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,188
Constitution of America?

60
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,152
So go ahead and ask.

61
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,654
-You a cop?
-No, no. Not like that.

62
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,990
Ask it, like, official.

63
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,784
Are you a police officer?

64
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:25,872
No, I am not a police officer.

65
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,125
Okay, then. Hundred
and seventy-five for a teenth.

66
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,128
The price is the price, yo.

67
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,259
All right.

68
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,621
There you go. Enjoy.

69
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,248
Thanks, man.

70
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:18,341
Albuquerque Police!
You're under arrest! Get on the ground!

71
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:23,012
Get on your stomach now!
On your stomach! Get on the ground!

72
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:27,141
Hold it right there. Don't move.
Stay down.

73
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:53,251
<i>I had a good job
until my boss accused me of stealing.</i>

74
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,420
<i>I'd better call Saul!</i>

75
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,969
<i>I was out partying,
minding my own business....</i>

76
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,890
<i>-You are under arrest.
-I'd better call Saul!</i>

77
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:09,892
<i>Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.</i>

78
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,811
<i>Did you know that you have rights?</i>

79
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:14,480
<i>The Constitution says you do.
And so do I.</i>

80
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,649
<i>I believe that until proven guilty...</i>

81
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:20,027
<i>...every man, woman,
and child in this country is innocent.</i>

82
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,196
<i>And that's why I fight for you,
Albuquerque.</i>

83
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,406
<i>Better call Saul.</i>

84
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,700
<i>Saul Goodman, attorney at law,
505-164-CALL.</i>

85
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,911
<i>That's 505-164-CALL.</i>

86
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:34,292
I really need to get some furniture.

87
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,086
I suggest you start with a bed.

88
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,050
God, I wish we could smoke in here.

89
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,596
-Well, you can't.
-Yeah, no. I know.

90
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,806
I'm just saying.

91
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,060
Don't think I can't smell that weed.

92
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,146
You better seriously hope
that airs out.

93
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:58,107
My dad will keep
your security deposit.

94
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,612
He has a nose
like a damn bloodhound.

95
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,447
Yeah?

96
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:08,868
Has he ever caught you?

97
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:13,706
Yeah. Many times.

98
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,584
Well, listen.

99
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,630
Since I already lost my deposit
and all...

100
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,424
...maybe we should light up.

101
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,013
No, thanks.

102
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,223
You sure?

103
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,185
Well, is it cool if I burn one?

104
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,646
Maybe you'll change your mind.

105
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,944
Do what you wanna do, I guess.

106
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,285
Hey. What'd I say?

107
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,329
Nothing.

108
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,499
I just have to go is all.

109
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:16,978
What's this?

110
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,148
My 18-month chip.

111
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:23,860
I'm in recovery.

112
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:29,699
And, you know,
pot is like stepping stones.

113
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:36,247
Recovery? That's cool.

114
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,790
Right on.

115
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,168
I respect that.

116
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,212
You know,
I don't really burn much anymore.

117
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,340
It's just a sometime thing.

118
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,553
But no more, like, in the house.

119
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,351
So you wanna go grab
some dinner?

120
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,062
I could really go for some Chinese.

121
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,731
No, I better hit it.

122
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,151
We....

123
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,069
We cool?

124
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,200
Your satellite is on, by the way.

125
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,872
That screen is badass.

126
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,263
I just think it's asking a lot.

127
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,474
He knows it.

128
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,351
He's done nothing but apologise.

129
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,479
Is this gonna be
every weekend now?

130
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,982
No. It's just the end of the quarter.
You remember how that was.

131
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:49,779
But I am earning double time,
so there's a bright side.

132
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,365
So when the laziest boy
in the world wakes up...

133
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,534
...tell him he better wash
those sneakers.

134
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:55,743
And I said bye.

135
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,287
And tell him
to let them air-dry this time.

136
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,249
I don't want him
banging the hell out of my dryer.

137
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,084
What?

138
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,921
What, you don't even get
casual Saturday?

139
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,214
I mean....

140
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,091
No, it's just you....

141
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,218
You look nice is all.

142
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,637
It's work, Walt.
And everybody is gonna be there.

143
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:16,806
-Okay.
-Okay.

144
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,475
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?

145
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,102
Okay.

146
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,812
-Bye.
-Bye.

147
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,286
<i>Hi. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter, Jr.</i>

148
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,830
<i>Please leave a message,
and we'll get back to you.</i>

149
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:45,543
<i>Skyler? Are you there?
I don't know what to do.</i>

150
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:49,338
<i>I.... I need to talk to you. I....</i>

151
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:53,092
Hey, Marie. It's me. What's up?

152
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,435
Yesterday I got home
and found him.

153
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,605
He didn't even tell me
he was coming.

154
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,525
-A man was killed?
-A Federale, right in front of him.

155
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,821
Three agents wounded,
one lost his leg.

156
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,658
It's like what you hear about
from Iraq or something.

157
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,661
-The IEDs.
-Oh, Jesus.

158
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,706
I had to hear about it
from Steve Gomez.

159
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,334
Hank talked to his ASAC
for about an hour.

160
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,796
Hank could win an Oscar.
He's so damn breezy with the man.

161
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,049
He hangs up the phone,
goes right back to bed.

162
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:39,096
And all he keeps saying is,
"I'm fine. I'm fine. Leave me alone."

163
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,914
Baby, not now.

164
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,127
It's-- It's me, Hank. Sorry.

165
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,924
Hey, buddy. What's...?

166
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,676
What's up?

167
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,596
I just....

168
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,182
Do you mind if I...?

169
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,393
No. No.

170
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,272
So....

171
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:33,734
How you doing?

172
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,988
Oh, you know, lousy.

173
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,073
Montezuma's revenge, bigtime.

174
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:44,620
I mean, everything's going through me
like crap through a tinhorn.

175
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,581
Better not get too close.

176
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,750
Well, I'll take my chances.

177
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:01,762
I guess you heard about
what happened down in Juárez?

178
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,141
Terrible.

179
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,478
What do you expect?
Bunch of freaking animals.

180
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,313
<i>It's like Apocalypse Now
down there.</i>

181
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:14,358
It's like Colonel Kurtz
holed up in his jungle.

182
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,489
And my SAC in El Paso
sends me home.

183
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:24,076
Now, that's a sound leadership
decision right there, huh?

184
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,371
You know, you don't put
your second most senior man...

185
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,665
...on the trail
of those motherless bastards...

186
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,376
...you send him home. You know?

187
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,505
I was, you know--
"He's out getting an evidence bag...

188
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,632
...and so ends up
without a scratch on him.

189
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,344
So must be something wrong
with that picture, you know."

190
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,849
So are you home for good then?

191
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,353
No, no. It's....

192
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:54,440
Playing it by ear. To be determined.

193
00:12:56,984 --> 00:13:00,780
Think you might wanna talk it through
with somebody?

194
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:04,033
What, a shrink?
No, no, no. Can't go down that road.

195
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,953
Start going down that road,
kiss your career goodbye.

196
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:13,835
Or Marie. Or me, if you like.

197
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:24,220
You know, I don't know
how to say this. I....

198
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,307
You know, the things I deal with...

199
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,770
...you and me don't have much of a--

200
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:37,024
What you might call
"an experiential overlap."

201
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:47,702
What if I told you we do?

202
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:59,672
I have spent my whole life scared.

203
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,844
Frightened of things
that could happen...

204
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,388
...might happen, might not happen.

205
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:11,100
Fifty years I spent like that.

206
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:16,439
Finding myself awake
at 3 in the morning.

207
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,861
But you know what?

208
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,448
Ever since my diagnosis...

209
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,076
...I sleep just fine.

210
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,334
Okay.

211
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:42,340
And I came to realise
it's that fear that's the worst of it.

212
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,717
That's the real enemy.

213
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,055
So....

214
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,725
Get up.

215
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,478
Get out in the real world.

216
00:14:56,103 --> 00:15:00,858
And you kick that bastard
as hard as you can right in the teeth.

217
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:18,584
Do it again. Go on.

218
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,845
Ten thousand even, same as last time.
It's totally accurate.

219
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,472
You and I,
we are gonna feed this machine.

220
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:35,309
-I want it running 24 hours a day.
-Right on.

221
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,318
Not yours, I take it.

222
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:51,451
We got 10, 20, 30...

223
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:56,664
...44, five each.

224
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:02,003
Three pounds should be 48 each.

225
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,254
Who's short?

226
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,215
All right. Don't freak, all right?
We didn't get ripped off.

227
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,384
But Badger hasn't kicked in
his full amount.

228
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,887
I know he was planning on pulling
an all-nighter...

229
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,805
...so he's probably still in the sack.

230
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:16,893
Then wake him up.
He can sleep after we're paid.

231
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,562
Why you gotta be such a hard-on?

232
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,273
You're not his pal. You're his boss.

233
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,901
This only works when
they're scared of you, remember?

234
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,196
Jack-off.

235
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,576
It's going straight to voicemail.

236
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,078
Voicemail?

237
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,333
Just chill, okay? Count your money.

238
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:46,839
<i>-Combo.
-Yo, what's up?</i>

239
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,258
You seen Badger?

240
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,178
Don't you cover for him, bitch.

241
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,264
I ask you a straight-up question,
I expect a straight-up answer.

242
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,532
Well?

243
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,871
They were too scared to tell me.

244
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,125
Badger got busted.

245
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,127
He's in jail.

246
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,916
<i>Honey, I'm home!</i>

247
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,335
Too slow! What's up?

248
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,337
Got more lives than a damn cat.

249
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,506
Now if I could only learn
to lick myself.

250
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,844
What's up, guys? Good to see you.
Good to see you. Good to see you.

251
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,848
All right. Let's all get back to work,
for chrissake, okay?

252
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:22,310
In my office, man. Let's see
what you bozos been up to lately.

253
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:46,876
You okay?

254
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,586
Hanging in?

255
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,505
What's it look like?

256
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,050
-What's this from A.P.D.?
-Been checking with them to see...

257
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,719
...if they come across
that famous blue meth of yours.

258
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:59,388
Sure enough, last night.

259
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,016
Got themselves
an honest-to-God dealer.

260
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:05,520
I was thinking of cruising over
and saying hello.

261
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,730
Maybe you'd like to go with me?

262
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,234
Yeah. Well, all right.

263
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:14,237
You told me to my face
you weren't a cop, man.

264
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,864
I feel manipulated.

265
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,658
I thought we were gonna hang out.

266
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,368
We are hanging out, Badger.

267
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,912
You like Badger or Brandon?

268
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:28,209
I like people who don't, like,
abuse the Constitution.

269
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,585
Badger, listen.

270
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,546
Hey.

271
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,298
I'm trying to help you here, man.

272
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:39,178
Now, if you just tell me
who your supplier is...

273
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:42,306
...I think this can end
very well for you.

274
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,519
What are you doing, detective, talking
to my client without me present?

275
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,770
You sneaky Pete.

276
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,439
Which is which?

277
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:53,067
What, did the academy hire you
right out of the womb?

278
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:55,069
You guys get younger every--

279
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:56,946
What'd you say to baby face?

280
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,573
Did you say anything stupid?

281
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,783
By "anything stupid,"
I mean anything at all.

282
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:03,453
Look at you.
Mouth open, vocal chords a-twitter.

283
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,997
We'll talk about it later.
Right now, you out.

284
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,459
Ten minutes ago. Go on.
There are laws, detective.

285
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,836
Have your kindergarten teacher
read them to you.

286
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,756
Go grab a juice box.
Have a nap. Go on.

287
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:20,303
All right.

288
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:23,222
Who do we have?

289
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,141
Brandon Mayhew.

290
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,644
Brandon Mayhew. All right.

291
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,230
Brandon Mayhew.

292
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:37,069
-Here we go. Public masturbation.
-What?

293
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:40,156
I don't get it. What's the kick?
Why don't you do it at home...

294
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,993
...with a big flat-screen TV,
50 channels of pay-per-view?

295
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:46,704
In a Starbucks. That's nice.

296
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,831
That ain't me, man. I....

297
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,795
I was the guy who was selling meth.
Allegedly.

298
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,839
Okay. All right. I got you.
Meth. Right.

299
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:59,175
Sorry, that was a little
transpositional error.

300
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,011
Nothing a little Wite-Out
can't take care of.

301
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,139
Yeah, and felony quantity.

302
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:07,642
-Just barely.
-Yeah, just barely.

303
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,895
The cops are like butchers.
Always got their thumbs on the scales.

304
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,980
But good luck arguing that in court.

305
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,900
Let me get down to brass tacks.

306
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,819
I'm gonna get you
a second phone call.

307
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,029
You're gonna call
your mommy or your daddy...

308
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:22,615
...or your parish priest
or your Boy Scout leader...

309
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:25,952
...and they're gonna
deliver me a cheque for $4650.

310
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,788
I'm gonna write that down
on the back of my business card.

311
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,541
Four-six-five-zero. Okay?

312
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:35,878
And I need that in a cashier's cheque
or a money order, doesn't matter.

313
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:38,548
Actually, I want it in a money order.

314
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:41,509
And make it out to
"Ice Station Zebra Associates."

315
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,178
That's my loan-out. It's totally legit.

316
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:46,430
It's done just for tax purposes.

317
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,183
And after that,
we can discuss Visa or MasterCard...

318
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:53,271
...but definitely not American Express,
so don't even ask. All right?

319
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,522
Any questions?

320
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,443
You're gonna get me off, right?

321
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:04,323
What do I look like, your high-school
girlfriend? Five fingers, no waiting?

322
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:08,202
That's a joke, Brandon. Lighten up.

323
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:12,206
Son, I promise you this.

324
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:15,543
I will give you
the best criminal defence...

325
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,128
...that money can buy.

326
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,215
Yeah, but, Francesca,
I took these already.

327
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,134
Didn't I take these already?

328
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,304
It's on your head. You're not
supposed to double up on vitamin A.

329
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,389
It's bad for the liver.

330
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,101
Okay, who's next?

331
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,562
Did him. I did him.

332
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,023
That one went public defender.
Thanks for nothing.

333
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:40,318
What happened to my masturbator?
You got me all turned around.

334
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,403
Hang on. I'll get back to you.

335
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:47,366
I sense you're discussing my client.
Anything you care to share with me?

336
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:50,203
Sure. Your commercials?
They suck ass.

337
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:53,539
I've seen better acting
in an epileptic whorehouse.

338
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:55,500
Is that like the one
your mom works at?

339
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,503
Is she still offering
the two-for-one discount?

340
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,589
DEA, huh? For a street bust.

341
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:04,926
Now, what would two feds
want with that little twerp?

342
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,983
Sooner or later,
this was gonna happen.

343
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:23,528
You want your exponential growth...

344
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,780
...guys are gonna get busted.
Simple as that.

345
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,908
How about we get him a real attorney?
What the hell is this?

346
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:30,785
This is who he hires?

347
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,996
What? Are you kidding me?
This is the guy you want.

348
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,041
This is the guy I'd hire.

349
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,210
It's the guy you'd hire.

350
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,753
Look, you remember Emilio?

351
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:44,090
Okay, this dude got Emilio off,
like, twice. Okay?

352
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:48,845
Both times, they had him
dead to rights, yo. And then, poof.

353
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,221
Dude is like Houdini.

354
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,223
Seriously,
when the going gets tough...

355
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,267
...you don't want a criminal lawyer.

356
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:57,812
You want a "criminal" lawyer.

357
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,814
Know what I'm saying?

358
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:03,526
Look, we're in good shape,
Mr. White.

359
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,987
Badger is way too loyal to roll.

360
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,156
Plus, he's scared shitless of me,
all right.

361
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:12,660
We pay four large. Cost of business.
Take it out of his payroll.

362
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:14,620
And it's only his first dealing rap...

363
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:17,415
...so, worst-case scenario,
you know, they plead him out.

364
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:21,169
He does five months picking up litter
in an orange jump suit.

365
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:26,340
So who goes inside?
I don't need them seeing my face.

366
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:29,093
Well, I don't need them
seeing my face.

367
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:32,388
Why not?
You look like his typical clientele.

368
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,056
Dick.

369
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:35,766
Fine.

370
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,978
We'll flip for it, all right? Call it.

371
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:42,190
Heads.

372
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:58,372
Mayhew? Mr. Mayhew?

373
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,222
Mr. Mayhew.

374
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,391
Nice of you to come down. Please.

375
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:18,851
Look at you.

376
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:23,064
Should I call the FBI
and tell them I found D.B. Cooper?

377
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,440
Joking.

378
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:26,734
I-- Please, come on.

379
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:28,736
Come on. Please.

380
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:30,738
Hello.

381
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:34,117
Saul Goodman. Please sit.

382
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:41,582
So it's a shame that we have to meet
under these circumstances.

383
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:48,923
I believe you have
something for me?

384
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:51,259
Oh, yes.

385
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:58,224
-Mayhew. Is that Irish or English?
-Irish.

386
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:01,269
Faith and begorra.
A fellow potato-eater.

387
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:03,855
My real name is McGill.

388
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,274
The Jew thing
I just do for the homeboys.

389
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:10,528
They all want a pipe-hitting member
of the tribe, so to speak.

390
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:13,990
I digress.
Good things are happening.

391
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:18,035
Fact is, your nephew is gonna
get out in no time.

392
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:19,871
That's wonderful, yeah.

393
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,457
There's still a few details
to be ironed out...

394
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:24,625
...but now that the DEA
is involved...

395
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:28,546
...I think he's looking
at time served, then probation.

396
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:32,133
So leave your number with Francesca,
and we'll be in touch.

397
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:33,968
-Excuse me, the DEA?
-Yeah.

398
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:37,763
That's the Drug Enforcement
Administration. The feds.

399
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,977
I hope that I'm not
the breaker of bad news...

400
00:26:43,186 --> 00:26:46,731
...but your nephew got mixed up
with some pretty nasty customers.

401
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:47,940
I understand that.

402
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:49,859
What does that have
to do with the DEA?

403
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,569
They're after some mystery man...

404
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,238
...some heavy-hitter
that goes by the name Heisenberg.

405
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:56,866
They want this guy
like the axe wants the turkey.

406
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,993
Seems young Brandon
may have information...

407
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:01,037
...that could lead to his arrest.

408
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:03,581
Jesus, cheer up.
This is good news.

409
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,334
I mean, Brandon fell head-first
into the doo-doo pile...

410
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,503
...and came up
smelling like Paco Rabanne.

411
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:12,840
Wait, wait. Look, I just.... I think....

412
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:18,179
I just think that we should
review our options.

413
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,806
Options?

414
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:22,016
I'm gonna tell you
what your options are.

415
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:25,812
You got a grand total of two.
Option A: Brandon takes the deal.

416
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,189
Option B:
Brandon goes up to the penitentiary...

417
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:31,025
...and gets his rectum
resized about yay big.

418
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:34,862
Look, look. What about reprisals?

419
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:36,864
I mean, if Badger--

420
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:42,537
If Brandon informs
on this Heisenberg....

421
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:44,705
I mean, what if, God forbid...

422
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:49,710
...that they decide to take revenge?

423
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,712
What have you been telling him?

424
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:55,341
The kid keeps spouting off about,
"If I talk, they'll kill me."

425
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,469
Right now, he's the only thing
holding up this deal.

426
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,348
-Good.
-No, that's not good. That's terrible.

427
00:28:02,557 --> 00:28:05,643
Trust me, sir, your nephew
won't last in prison two weeks.

428
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:08,521
You let him take his chances
on the outside.

429
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,690
Maybe I can work
in some witness protection.

430
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:14,569
No, look, look.
These are vicious, desperate people.

431
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:19,740
I've been told that
one of them killed another man...

432
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:23,411
...by crushing his head
with an ATM machine.

433
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,081
People love to take credit
for the fun ones.

434
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,751
The guy who got his head smooshed
used to be a client of mine.

435
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,546
His wife killed him, all right?
It was open and shut.

436
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:36,257
Trust me, you folks have
nothing to worry about, okay?

437
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:39,802
I'm gonna set your nephew straight,
get him singing like a canary...

438
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:42,430
...all's right with the world.

439
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:46,642
Ten thousand dollars.

440
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:03,117
Ten thousand, cash to you.

441
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:07,997
I'm not saying to throw the case.

442
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:13,294
Just no talking to the DEA.

443
00:29:14,337 --> 00:29:16,631
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

444
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:18,800
Yes.

445
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,469
What's it going to be?

446
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:26,307
What, dude wouldn't take a bribe?

447
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:29,477
That dude in there?
Saul Goodman we're talking about?

448
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,354
Yeah. "Morally outraged," he said.

449
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:32,980
Threatened to call the police.

450
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:38,152
<i>-Wait, and Badger is gonna spill?
-Like the Exxon Valdez.</i>

451
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,280
So, what do we do about it?

452
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:54,001
Hey, Francesca,
how about I follow you home?

453
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,253
No.

454
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,130
For safety.

455
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:58,881
What?

456
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:03,636
God, you are killing me
with that booty.

457
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,860
Talk to me.
Come on, talk to me, guys, huh?

458
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:22,697
Come on, just tell me what you want.
Jesus!

459
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:26,033
Oh, no, no, no!

460
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:29,162
No, it wasn't me.
It was Ignacio. He's the one.

461
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,123
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

462
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:36,878
Shut up, dude.

463
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:40,465
Shut up, all right?
Just speak English.

464
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:43,551
Lalo didn't send you? No Lalo?

465
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:47,305
-Who?
-Oh, thank God! Oh, Christ!

466
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:50,057
Oh, I thought....

467
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:53,227
What can I do for you gentlemen?

468
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:55,855
Anything.
Just tell me what you need.

469
00:30:56,063 --> 00:31:00,151
This afternoon, an associate of ours
offered you $10,000.

470
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,903
You should have taken it.

471
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:05,198
Wait a minute.
This is in regards to what's-his-name?

472
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:07,825
Badger! Brandon Mayhew.

473
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:10,536
The uncle. That was your guy?

474
00:31:11,746 --> 00:31:14,499
No offence, but I don't take bribes
from strangers, you know?

475
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:17,043
Better safe than sorry.
That's my motto.

476
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:21,672
-But I'll take your money! Sure!
-No, that offer has expired, yo.

477
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:25,802
It was kind of low anyways.
But okay, okay, I'll take it.

478
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,720
Just tell me what you need,
all right?

479
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:30,014
I'm easy. I'm gonna keep
a happy thought...

480
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:32,517
...and assume
this is just a negotiating tactic.

481
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:35,770
All right, listen to me very carefully.

482
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:37,855
You are going to give
Badger Mayhew...

483
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:41,192
...the best legal representation ever.

484
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,653
But no deals with the DEA.

485
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:47,532
All right? Badger will not identify
anyone to anybody.

486
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,284
If he does, you're dead.

487
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:54,705
Why don't you just kill Badger?

488
00:31:57,708 --> 00:32:00,503
I mean, follow me, but if a mosquito
is buzzing around you...

489
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:03,923
...and it bites you on the ass,
you don't go gunning for the attorney.

490
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:07,552
You go grab a fly swatter.
I mean, so to speak.

491
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:11,139
I mean, all due respect,
but do I have to spell this out for you?

492
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:14,767
-We're not killing Badger, yo!
-Then you got real problems, okay.

493
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:16,978
Because the DEA
will come down on your boy...

494
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:19,105
...like a proverbial ton of bricks.

495
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:21,399
I don't think
I'm going out on a limb here...

496
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:23,401
...but, hey,
he's not gonna like prison.

497
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:28,114
He's gonna sing like Celine Dion
regardless of what you do to me.

498
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:34,996
Mr. Mayhew?

499
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:41,335
I recognise your cough. Take that
mask off, you know. Get some air.

500
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:43,212
Go on.

501
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:52,013
-God.
-Take it easy.

502
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:54,849
Breathe in, breathe out.

503
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:58,936
All right. I'm gonna stand up, all right?
Because I got bad knees.

504
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:01,522
That's better.

505
00:33:02,273 --> 00:33:05,860
Okay, now listen. The three of us
are gonna work this out.

506
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:07,570
Yeah? How?

507
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,531
First thing, you'll put a dollar
in my pocket, both of you.

508
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:15,536
You want attorney-client privilege,
don't you?

509
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:18,790
So that everything you say
is strictly between us.

510
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,876
I mean it. Put a dollar in my pocket.

511
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:23,711
Come on, make it official.

512
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:26,464
Come on, do it.

513
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:30,510
That's it, come on. Just a dollar.

514
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:38,392
All right, now you, ski bum.
Come on. Give with the dollar.

515
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,102
-Go on.
-Be smart.

516
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:41,771
What?

517
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:47,235
-All I got is a five.
-I'll take a five.

518
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:51,030
Come on, already.
Come on. Be cool.

519
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:55,451
Okay, you're now both
officially represented...

520
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,245
...by Saul Goodman and Associates.

521
00:33:57,453 --> 00:34:01,833
Your secrets are safe with me
under threat of disbarment. All right?

522
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:05,545
Take the ski mask off. I feel like I'm
talking to the Weather Underground.

523
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:09,423
Just do it.

524
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:17,431
Okay, so if a prison shanking
is completely off the table....

525
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,891
And we're sure of that?

526
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:23,020
No shanking!

527
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:26,524
All right, all right.

528
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:31,571
The way I see it is
somebody is going to prison.

529
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:37,368
It's just a matter of who.

530
00:34:38,828 --> 00:34:42,081
All right. Lame-ass TV ads aside...

531
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:45,793
...your lawyer here,
he cooked you up a pretty killer deal.

532
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:47,253
Time served, no probation.

533
00:34:47,462 --> 00:34:50,798
It's pretty slick.
Couldn't believe the judge went for it.

534
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:54,093
Don't get cocky.
You ain't home free yet.

535
00:34:54,302 --> 00:34:56,345
You don't give us
the name of your supplier...

536
00:34:56,554 --> 00:34:59,765
-...you're going nowhere.
-The tough guy act is unnecessary.

537
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:02,268
This young man
is cooperating fully.

538
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:05,396
Is that right?
Yeah, you cooperating?

539
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:12,236
Okay, let's start with a name.

540
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:16,783
He just goes by Heisenberg.

541
00:35:17,325 --> 00:35:18,326
Heisenberg, huh?

542
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:21,162
How old is this Heisenberg?

543
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:25,666
Old. Like 50 or 70 or something.

544
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,002
-Height?
-Average, I guess.

545
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:30,087
Medium height, medium weight.

546
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:33,299
-What colour hair?
-No hair.

547
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:35,134
Dude is balder than you.

548
00:35:37,345 --> 00:35:39,806
1963, James Edward Kilkelly...

549
00:35:40,014 --> 00:35:42,517
...is convicted of stealing
a vending machine.

550
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:45,520
1975, breaking and entering.

551
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:48,356
1982, grand theft auto.

552
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:50,900
1984, armed robbery.

553
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:55,446
1987, 1992. You get the idea.
And here he is today.

554
00:35:55,655 --> 00:35:57,532
Better known as Jimmy In-'N-Out.

555
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:03,246
City, state and federal, he's spent
44 of the last 58 years inside.

556
00:36:04,247 --> 00:36:06,707
Entire life behind bars.

557
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:09,460
Jimmy provides
a very special service.

558
00:36:09,669 --> 00:36:12,505
For a price,
Jimmy will go to prison for you.

559
00:36:13,506 --> 00:36:17,218
On purpose?
The guy goes to prison on purpose?

560
00:36:18,136 --> 00:36:20,054
He's actually
more comfortable inside.

561
00:36:20,263 --> 00:36:22,682
The outside world
hasn't been too kind to him.

562
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:26,727
Sometime during
the Clinton administration...

563
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:31,065
...Jimmy figured out how he could
use his talents to turn a profit.

564
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:40,366
-So when does all this happen?
-It's already happening.

565
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:41,868
The buy is set for tomorrow.

566
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:44,745
Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out,
everybody's happy...

567
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:47,957
...and all it's gonna cost you
is 80 thousand and one pound...

568
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:49,667
...of your finest meth.

569
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:58,134
Eighty thousand dollars
for eight years of his life, huh?

570
00:36:58,342 --> 00:37:00,553
First of all,
he's not gonna do eight years.

571
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:02,555
I'll represent him, and I guarantee...

572
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:06,267
...there's gonna be some unexpected
problems with the prosecution's case.

573
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:09,103
Secondly, he gets 30.
Fifty goes to me.

574
00:37:09,312 --> 00:37:12,356
-You get 50? For what?
-For facilitating.

575
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:15,234
Who's taking a bigger risk here?
He likes prison.

576
00:37:15,443 --> 00:37:17,445
You did bring the cash, didn't you?

577
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:20,740
Look, if this option
is too expensive...

578
00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:24,368
...you can still always...Badger
in the chow line.

579
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:44,764
Conscience gets expensive,
doesn't it?

580
00:38:02,198 --> 00:38:04,700
All right. There's our boy.

581
00:38:05,868 --> 00:38:08,162
Right on time.

582
00:38:24,846 --> 00:38:27,849
-Go back.
-What? All right, all right, all right.

583
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:44,365
So, what do you think?
They see us?

584
00:38:44,782 --> 00:38:46,659
No, man, I think we're good.

585
00:38:52,081 --> 00:38:54,167
Badger looks like
he's gonna throw up.

586
00:38:54,584 --> 00:38:56,043
Give me those back.

587
00:38:56,252 --> 00:38:58,212
Just give them to me.

588
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,673
Oh, no.

589
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:02,467
Where the hell is Jimmy?

590
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:04,677
Should've been here
10 minutes ago.

591
00:39:04,886 --> 00:39:09,599
You think Jimmy is actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?

592
00:39:10,183 --> 00:39:12,185
There's more
than one kind of prison.

593
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:14,228
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

594
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:16,898
There he is-- Wait a minute.

595
00:39:17,106 --> 00:39:20,651
-Oh, no, no, no.
-What? What? Let me see.

596
00:39:22,195 --> 00:39:24,405
-Who the hell is that?
-I don't know.

597
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:31,078
Mr. Heisenberg, I presume.

598
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:33,790
Time to move?

599
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:36,125
Not till we see the exchange.

600
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:41,964
No, no. Oh, shit!

601
00:39:42,173 --> 00:39:45,259
-What?
-Now he shows.

602
00:39:48,763 --> 00:39:50,681
Okay, let's do this.

603
00:39:54,852 --> 00:39:56,187
No, no.

604
00:39:56,395 --> 00:39:58,940
Oh, my God.
Jimmy is on the wrong bench. Crap!

605
00:39:59,148 --> 00:40:01,234
We're screwed!

606
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:02,819
What are you doing?

607
00:40:03,027 --> 00:40:05,154
Hey, what are you doing?

608
00:40:09,242 --> 00:40:11,119
I don't get it. What's the holdup?

609
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:23,131
Where's the stuff, man?

610
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:25,466
-Where are we going?
-Just shut up.

611
00:40:31,347 --> 00:40:32,557
Get out. Go stop him.

612
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:35,184
The DEA is right there.
If they see me, we're screwed.

613
00:40:35,393 --> 00:40:36,894
Get out. I'll do something.

614
00:40:37,103 --> 00:40:39,105
-What?
-Just go!

615
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:54,162
Hank, I thought that was you.

616
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:55,955
Schrader, I'm blocked.

617
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:58,916
-Walt, not a good time.
-How you doing? You feeling okay?

618
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,126
Schrader, I'm blocked.

619
00:41:00,835 --> 00:41:02,837
We're working.
You gotta get out of here.

620
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:06,382
-Working? Oh, like DEA working?
-Schrader, we're missing it. Schrader.

621
00:41:06,591 --> 00:41:08,634
Is something going down?

622
00:41:10,887 --> 00:41:13,431
Wrong guy, wrong guy.
Other bench.

623
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:21,355
Walt, Walt.

624
00:41:21,564 --> 00:41:23,691
-Walter, move your ass now.
-Okay.

625
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,693
Listen, I'll just go, leave you alone.

626
00:41:25,902 --> 00:41:28,696
-We'll talk about it later. Just floor it.
-Should I back up?

627
00:41:28,905 --> 00:41:30,323
-Go that way.
-Forward is better?

628
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:32,366
I'll be out of the way there.
Okay, okay.

629
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:35,036
I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry.

630
00:41:35,244 --> 00:41:37,830
-I'll leave you alone.
-We'll talk later. Just go.

631
00:41:38,581 --> 00:41:41,459
Where'd he go?
Where the hell did he go?

632
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:46,672
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Got him.

633
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:56,307
-Looks like it's going down.
-Take him.

634
00:42:04,315 --> 00:42:07,318
Freeze! Hey, right there.
Don't move.

635
00:42:09,737 --> 00:42:11,155
Come on, let's get him up.

636
00:42:20,957 --> 00:42:22,625
Jesus!

637
00:42:23,626 --> 00:42:25,461
I think they bought it.

638
00:42:29,215 --> 00:42:30,258
<i>Absolutely.</i>

639
00:42:30,466 --> 00:42:33,845
Textbook bust, sir. Yes, sir.

640
00:42:34,053 --> 00:42:36,597
Looks like we got a full pound
of the blue stuff.

641
00:42:36,806 --> 00:42:41,561
Oh, and Heisenberg's real name?
James Kilkelly.

642
00:42:42,854 --> 00:42:46,941
Thank you. Thank you very much.
It was my pleasure.

643
00:43:13,676 --> 00:43:15,011
Hey.

644
00:43:16,012 --> 00:43:18,514
You weren't home,
so I let the delivery guys in.

645
00:43:18,723 --> 00:43:22,143
-I hope that's okay.
-Absolutely.

646
00:43:31,527 --> 00:43:33,696
So you bought a bed.

647
00:43:35,156 --> 00:43:36,282
Yeah.

648
00:43:36,866 --> 00:43:38,576
What is that, a king?

649
00:43:41,078 --> 00:43:42,663
Pillow top?

650
00:44:18,866 --> 00:44:22,787
Oh, my God.
You really are a chemistry teacher.

651
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,252
You mind?

652
00:44:33,339 --> 00:44:35,550
I was terrible at chemistry.

653
00:44:35,758 --> 00:44:38,386
I'm more of a humanities guy.

654
00:44:38,594 --> 00:44:41,180
-How did you find me?
-We should talk about that.

655
00:44:41,389 --> 00:44:45,726
It should be much, much harder
for people to track you down.

656
00:44:45,935 --> 00:44:47,562
My Pl charged me for three hours...

657
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:50,731
...so I seriously doubt
it took him more than one.

658
00:44:53,651 --> 00:44:56,779
So this is, what, blackmail?

659
00:44:56,988 --> 00:44:58,698
Walter, I'm your lawyer.

660
00:44:58,906 --> 00:45:03,327
Anything you say to me
is totally privileged.

661
00:45:03,536 --> 00:45:06,080
I'm not in the shakedown racket.

662
00:45:06,289 --> 00:45:08,708
I'm a lawyer. Even drug dealers
need lawyers, right?

663
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:12,044
Especially drug dealers.

664
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:16,507
So, what, you're just doing this
out of the kindness of your heart?

665
00:45:17,049 --> 00:45:20,344
Come on.
Have you seen my hourly rate?

666
00:45:21,637 --> 00:45:23,598
By the way,
where do you keep the money?

667
00:45:23,806 --> 00:45:28,102
Is it in your mattress? Is it in a jelly jar
buried in the side yard?

668
00:45:28,311 --> 00:45:31,272
This kid Mayhew may be the first
of your guys to get picked up...

669
00:45:31,481 --> 00:45:32,774
...but he won't be the last.

670
00:45:32,982 --> 00:45:36,527
And if I can find you,
how far behind can the cops be?

671
00:45:36,736 --> 00:45:38,154
I don't understand.

672
00:45:38,362 --> 00:45:41,240
What exactly are you
offering to do for me?

673
00:45:42,742 --> 00:45:45,787
What did Tom Hagen
do for Vito Corleone?

674
00:45:46,204 --> 00:45:49,290
I'm no Vito Corleone.

675
00:45:49,499 --> 00:45:52,251
No shit. Right now, you're Fredo.

676
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,961
But with some sound advice...

677
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:56,547
...and the proper introductions,
who knows?

678
00:45:56,756 --> 00:45:58,716
I'll tell you,
you've got the right product.

679
00:45:58,925 --> 00:46:01,677
Anything that gets the DEA's panties
in this big a bunch...

680
00:46:01,886 --> 00:46:03,554
...you're on to something special.

681
00:46:03,763 --> 00:46:08,142
And I would like to be
a small and silent part of it.

682
00:46:10,728 --> 00:46:11,771
Food for thought, yeah?

683
00:46:16,984 --> 00:46:21,656
So if you wanna make more money
and keep the money that you make...

684
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:24,992
...better call Saul!
