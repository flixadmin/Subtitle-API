00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,549
<i>Report, please.</i>

7
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,388
<i>Unidentified creature reported.</i>
<i>Stay on high alert.</i>

8
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,291
<i>-It's out, sir!</i>
<i>-Is it human?</i>

9
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:24,751
<i>I can't tell, sir.</i>

10
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,669
<i>I can't see clearly because of the snow.</i>

11
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,870
<i>Moving in for closer visual.</i>

12
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:08,920
<i>It looks human!</i>

13
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,677
<i>Visibility is compromised.</i>

14
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,554
<i>Remain on standby</i>
<i>until visual is confirmed.</i>

15
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,978
<i>It keeps approaching, sir!</i>
<i>What should we do?</i>

16
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,396
<i>Units on standby at the bridge.</i>

17
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,773
<i>Standby to shoot.</i>

18
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,651
<i>Do not approach.</i>

19
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,570
If you don't stop, we will shoot.

00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,448

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,826
<i>Visual confirmed.</i>

23
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:40,743
<i>Ready to fire.</i>

24
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,329
<i>Fire!</i>

25
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,618
<i>Someone once said</i>

26
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,662
<i>that even the thickest darkness</i>

27
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,290
<i>disappears with the faintest light.</i>

28
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,262
<i>This is a story about us,</i>

29
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,056
<i>the ones trying to find</i>

30
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,807
<i>a reason to live</i>

31
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:48,519

32
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,230

PROTECT OUR RIGHT TO LIVE
GREEN HOME RESIDENTS

38
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,384
Oh, my goodness. That was close.

39
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,847
I don't know how that flew
all the way over there.

40
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,516
I'm sorry. This isn't my job,

41
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,602
but they said nobody else
could work on the weekend.

42
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,772
People here think security guards
are slaves or something…

43
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:58,983
Well, anyway…

44
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,026
Excuse me.

45
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,695
I haven't seen you before.

46
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:03,696
What brings you here?

47
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,616
I moved…

48
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,160
What? I can't hear you.
Can you speak louder?

49
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,329
I moved here.

50
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:12,872
Moved?

51
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:17,251
I heard somebody was moving
into Room 1410. I guess that's you.

52
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,211
Are you living alone?

53
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,630
Yes.

54
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,508
What? I can't hear you.

55
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,260
I'm living alone.

56
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:27,762
Right.

57
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,598
BEAUTIFUL AND CLEAN
GREEN HOME MANAGEMENT OFFICE

58
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,585
Should I just die?

59
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,117
Mister!

60
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,036
Oh, right.

61
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,164
You're always sleeping.

62
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,208
-Do you ever work?
-I'm sorry.

63
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,002
Take the bed out.

64
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,171
Pardon?

65
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,090
Someone made a complaint about the bed.

66
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,925
That bed is why you're not focused on work

67
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,011
and dozing off all day.

68
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,388
Well, but then how would I get any rest?

69
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,183
I'm telling you not to rest.

70
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,476
Got that?

71
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,145
Why can't he understand anything?

72
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,485
He's so loud and uncultured.

73
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,777
Oh, hello.

74
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,615
Don't mind him.
He just never learned any manners.

75
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,410
But you know, I used to live in Gangnam.

76
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,247
None of the security guards there
had beds in their offices.

77
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,874
Pardon?

78
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,459
I'm just saying.

79
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,253
But what brings you here?

80
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,507
Oh, this. Someone sent me some fish.

81
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,759
But you know, I only eat yellow corvinas.

82
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,929
You can have these.

83
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,848
You really didn't have to.
Thank you so much.

84
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,768
You know the term
"noblesse oblige," right?

85
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,606
-Have a nice day.
-Right. Thank you, ma'am.

86
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,733
I'll enjoy these. Thank you!

87
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,769
Fucking hell.

88
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,147
Damn it.

89
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,697
Hey!

90
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,035
Was this you?

91
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,038
No.

92
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,709
Maybe it was the gangster guy.

93
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,878
Did you see who did it?

94
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,467
No.

95
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,309
Do you want one?

96
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,687
No.

97
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,608
Are you a loner?

98
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,202
I thought handsome guys
couldn't be loners.

99
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,914
Maybe you're just an asshole.

100
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:52,670
Don't die here.

101
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:59,135
You'll just cause trouble
for a lot of people here.

102
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,137
Find somewhere else to die.

103
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,405
What are you doing?

104
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,245
I asked you to come by the office,
but I guess you forgot.

105
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,372
You need to fill out
a registration document.

106
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,294
I'll go later.

107
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,684
I'm sorry about earlier.

108
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,895
Here.

109
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,024
All right.

110
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,463
Yes, Mom.

111
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,548
I'll go back if I fail this audition.

112
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,718
How many times do I have to tell you?
This is the last one.

113
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,970
Don't take back your word.

114
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,680
I'll get accepted for sure this time.

115
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:27,765
A sponsorship?

116
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,267
I'm not going to be a prostitute. Okay?

117
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,936
-Hello.
-Right.

118
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,188
I'm so hungry.

119
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:37,024
I'm doing all this to earn a living,
but I might starve to death.

120
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,613
What? Why am I suddenly
getting a nosebleed?

121
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,060
-What do you think?
-<i>It sucks.</i>

122
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,813
<i>Are you really going to perform there?</i>
<i>Don't you have any pride?</i>

123
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,523
Hey, my pride's not making me any money.

124
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,693
And they're paying me a lot.

125
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,988
I could sell my soul
for that kind of money.

126
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,199
Hey, I have to go to work. Bye.

127
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,316
I guess you just moved here.

128
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,319
Yes, I came just a week ago.

129
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,238
Sorry I didn't introduce
myself earlier. I'm in Room 1510.

130
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,698
It's nice to meet you.

131
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,743
Oh, dear! It's okay, Da-eun.

132
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,328
She's just a neighbor.

133
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,371
Sorry.

134
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,665
I guess I was a little loud.

135
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,754
I might have a lot to be sorry about
in the future, though.

136
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,423
It's all right.

137
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,635
How old is your baby?

138
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,014
My little princess is just one year old.

139
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,393
Hello!

140
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,814
Isn't she pretty?

141
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,613
Yes, she is.

142
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,377
Aren't you getting in?

143
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,253
Oh, I…

144
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,881
forgot my wallet at home.

145
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,931
I'll wait for you.

146
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,641
No, it's fine. Go ahead.

147
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,323
What's wrong with her?

148
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,451
It's all right. She's a kind person.

149
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,876
She lost her baby last year.

150
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,753
They say her stroller

151
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,089
rolled into the street
when she wasn't looking.

152
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,844
That's so sad.

153
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,644
God sometimes gives us hardships
that are hard to overcome.

154
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,439
But failing to overcome them

155
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,982
doesn't mean you should be criticized

156
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,152
or feared by others for it.

157
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,446
Yes. You're right.

158
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,572
Everything is God's will.

159
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,951
It's nice to meet you.

160
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,203
I'm Jung Jae-heon. I live in Room 1506.

161
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,086
Am I being overly friendly?

162
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,213
No, it's just that

163
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,216
my hand reeks of cigarettes.

164
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,218
Oh, all right.

165
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:34,678
I'm Yoon Ji-su.

166
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,269
I guess you play the guitar.

167
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,562
I play the bass.

168
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,105
Oh, right.

169
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,151
What do you do, then?

170
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,862
I'm a Korean language teacher.

171
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,535
I have a Bible because I'm going
to church today. Since it's Sunday.

172
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,163
-That's nice.
-Right.

173
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,665
THE HOLY BIBLE

174
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,003
I'm not a missionary or anything.

175
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,255
Right. I get it.

176
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,054
-Bye, then.
-Bye.

177
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,502
Don't come in.

178
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,967
-Your lesson fees.
-I already paid for them.

179
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,304
-Where did you get the money?
-I met a rich guy.

180
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,641
Tell me the truth.

181
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,728
If I tell you

182
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,105
would anything change?

183
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,150
Why are you so damn nosy?

184
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,281
<i>I just yanked out the whiskers!</i>

185
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,576
<i>And then I skinned it with my knife.</i>

186
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,870
<i>Look. This is it.</i>

187
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,205
<i>You see this?</i>

188
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,250
<i>Did you catch this snake, too?</i>

189
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,085
<i>What are you talking about?</i>
<i>Oh, what's that?</i>

190
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,254
<i>It's a snake!</i>

191
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,840
<i>What are you doing?</i>

192
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,093
<i>-Hey!</i>
<i>-What? Is that a snake?</i>

193
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,261
<i>-What?</i>
<i>-Sir…</i>

194
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,346
<i>Oh, my gosh!</i>

195
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:59,531
<i>Hey! Get ready!</i>

196
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,666
Why are you doing this to me?

197
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,212
I didn't do anything!

198
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,132
<i>-Hey, this is dangerous.</i>
-I don't know what it is,

199
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,967
but I'm sorry.

200
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,012
I won't report this.

201
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,849
I won't tell anyone about this.

202
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,986
<i>Are you really going to leave?</i>

203
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,531
<i>Don't you remember?</i>

204
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,617
<i>When you were a fourth grader…</i>

205
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,745
What? What is that?

206
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,805
Please don't kill me.

207
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,269
I'm trying.

208
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,644
CONGRATULATIONS!

209
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,355
YOU'VE BEEN CHOSEN TO BE A TESTER
FOR THE REMAKE OF <i>LAST WORLD</i>

210
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,193
COME TO THE FAN FESTIVAL
AT G-TOWER ON AUGUST 25TH

211
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,490
AUGUST

212
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,121
NAME OF EVENT

213
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:23,467
AUGUST 25TH, TUESDAY
SUICIDE

214
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,719
DO NOT ENTER

215
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,764
What is this?

216
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,758
Is he unemployed?

217
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,221
He does look like a gangster, though.

218
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,850
Do you even pay rent?

219
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,853
Go and ask questions at school.

220
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,403
I got kicked out

221
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,531
for setting the school on fire.

222
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,888
<i>It's been a week since I moved here.</i>

223
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,058
<i>I've only eaten </i>ramyeon<i>,</i>
<i>so I don't feel well.</i>

224
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,436
<i>But that doesn't matter.</i>

225
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,354
<i>I'm going to kill myself anyway.</i>

226
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,691
OPEN

227
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,070
<i>This is so hard. I didn't lose any weight.</i>

228
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,030
<i>This is so irritating.</i>

229
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:10,949
<i>Hey, Kitty.</i>

230
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:14,327
I'm starving, but you're eating
as much as you want.

231
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,874
<i>Hello? Oh, hi!</i>

232
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,587
<i>Oh, it's all right. Maybe next time…</i>

233
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,046
<i>Drinks?</i>

234
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,298
<i>Yes, I enjoy drinking.</i>

235
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:28,884
<i>All right, call me anytime.</i>

236
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,635
I KEEP HEARING THINGS
AND GETTING NOSEBLEEDS

237
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,346
<i>Damn it. What do I do?</i>

238
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,098
SHOULD I SEE A DOCTOR?
IT'S REALLY SERIOUS.

239
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,768
<i>Damn it…</i>

240
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,446
WHAT THE HELL, WHO SAID TO LEAVE?

241
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,405
THAT PRICK EVEN MOVED

242
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,074
BECAUSE HIS PARENTS DIED

243
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,409
REST IN PEACE

244
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,745
HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO SURVIVED

245
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,079
FIGURES

246
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,417
DON'T DIE UNTIL WE ALLOW YOU TO

247
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,129
YOU PRICK

248
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,981
THE SECURITY GUARD WASN'T IN

Hungry…

252
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:41,850
Excuse me.

I'm so scared. Please help me.

256
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,400
Is there nobody home?

257
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,030
Please. Help me.

258
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,657
Please.

259

Hello?

Please help me.

261
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,794
I'm scared.

<i>You're home.</i>

Did something happen?

266
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,651
<i>I just came home,</i>

267
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,569
<i>and the door was open,</i>

00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,571
<i>and it was a mess inside.</i>

269

<i>And my cat is gone.</i>

<i>It was covered in blood.</i>

<i>Please, help me.</i>

273
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,252
Okay, calm down.

00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,506
I'll call the police.

275

<i>Can't you stay with me?</i>

276
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,272
What's going on?

00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,776
<i>Please…</i>

00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,489
Hang on.

<i>Please, can you open the door?</i>

Well…

00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,683
<i>What?</i>

Your arms.

Show me your arms.

291
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,398
<i>What did you say?</i>

292
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,567
Your arms.

293
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,695
Show me your arms.

<i>I told you to open the door! Open it!</i>

<i>You asshole!</i>

00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,432
It's blood.

298
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,019
There's a lot of blood.

299
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,524
Did you

300
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,943
see a weird woman just now?

301
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,706
Jeez.

302
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,126
I shouldn't have played so much.

303

Coming.

304
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,424
You must be pretty angry.

I'm sorry. I sometimes get
really inspired at night, so…

<i>-I'm hungry.</i>
-What?

307
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:55,186
<i>Open the door!</i>

308
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,605
Your face…

309
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,065
Did you hurt yourself?

310
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,610
I'll be quiet!

311
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,280
I told you I'm sorry.
You're being a bit harsh!

312
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,367
<i>Open the door!</i>

313
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:14,038
<i>I'm hungry!</i>

Don't just eat <i>ramyeon</i>, okay?

And if you're not home later,
I'm reporting you missing.

321

Just report me as dead.

Some woman was banging on the door,

327

and she had blood all over her face.

328

She seemed hurt, but she was so angry

329

and she was banging
on the door really hard…

You don't think she jumped, do you?

331

She wasn't just banging.

00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,578
She was ramming into the door.

333
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,555
Damn it. I'm late.

334
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,685
What's going on?

335
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:43,646
Where's the security guard?

336
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,023
My daughter hasn't come home yet.

337
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,316
Who lowered the shutters?

338
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,070
Excuse me.

339
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,698
Does your cell have service?

340
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,540
I guess not.

341
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,669
What's going on here?

342
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,923
-Did you just come down?
-Yes.

343
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,551
Didn't you see anything strange
on the way?

344
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:17,055
-Like what?
-Never mind.

345
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,514
I asked what's going on.

346
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,353
We're trying to find out.

347
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,857
The back doors and the parking lot doors
are locked as well.

348
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,198
Are you saying we're locked in?

349
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,951
Someone may have locked us in.

350
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,246
Hey!

351
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:43,998
Hey!

352
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,211
-Hey!
-Honey, just wait.

353
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,338
-Isn't anyone inside?
-Honey…

354
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,298
Ma'am, we can't just sit around

355
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,425
and wait forever. This is so annoying.

356
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,345
These jerks are going to ruin
our business. Damn it.

357
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,721
Honey…

358
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,765
I took photos

359
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:01,682
as evidence.

360
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,518
Is it still not open yet?

361
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,228
What…

362
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:07,730
Wait!

363
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,398
What are you doing?

364
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,192
Move if you're not going to help.

365
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,611
We'll have to pay to get the door fixed!

366
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:16,405
-Are you going to pay for it all?
-Excuse me.

367
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,699
Who's that? Hey! What the heck?

368
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,035
Oh, watch out!

369
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,748
Are you okay, sir?

370
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:27,750
Your hair.

371
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,965
That little jerk.

372
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,801
MANAGEMENT OFFICE

373
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,765
So they went home? I can't believe them…

374
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,268
Hello, this is Firefighter Seo Yi-kyung…

375
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:48,187
<i>Every operator is currently busy</i>
<i>with disaster reports.</i>

376
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,939
<i>Please wait a moment.</i>

377
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:54,694
<i>Every operator is currently busy</i>
<i>with disaster reports.</i>

378
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,904
-<i>Please wait a moment.</i>
-Landline phones must be working.

379
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:01,742
<i>Every operator is currently busy</i>
<i>with disaster reports.</i>

380
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:02,952
<i>Please…</i>

381
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,168
Did you just touch something?

382
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,087
Hey, you little…

383
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,589
I'm trying to open the doors!

384
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,008
-Put it back to how it was.
-Fine!

385
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:23,806
Maybe it wasn't that.

386
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,926
Oh, whatever.

387
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:03,179
The employees will fix the phone tomorrow.

388
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,264
That's not the point
when we're locked in here.

389
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:07,892
Is that it?

390
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,858
I found the switches!

391
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,533
All right, now we're ready.

392
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,702
The shutters will go up now.
We found the switch.

393
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:27,703
-Come on.
-Let's go.

394
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,538
-Let's open it.
-Why were they down?

395
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,832
I don't know. But all we had to do
was press a button.

396
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,334
I guess we can go out now.

397
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,585
What's that?

398
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:38,714
Okay, raise the main door switch…

399
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,133
And press this.

400
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,602
What's wrong with that guy?

401
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,525
It's open, right?

402
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,735
You're all getting out thanks to me.

403
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,989
Is that blood on his mouth?

404
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,010
Put it back down.

405
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,309
Oh my god.

406
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:33,352
Lower the shutters!

407
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,060
Help…

408
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,198
Mister!

409
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,660
Mister!

410
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,623
When I signal you, lower the shutters!

411
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,379
Okay!

412
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,799
Honey!

413
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,269
Mister!

414
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,898
Lower it!

415
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,359
MAIN DOORS

416
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,653
Now!

417
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,366
Hurry!

418
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:51,740
Hurry! Come on!

419
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,295
Thank you.

420
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:53,802
What was that?

421
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,181
It wasn't human.

422
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:43,686
Is it gone?

423
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,062
-I don't know.
-I guess it's gone.

424
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,230
Go slowly.

425
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,540
Hey.

426
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:05,749
I heard you're a firefighter.

427
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,418
What's the government doing?

428
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,796
I'm sure they'll take care of things.

429
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,506
We're paying so much tax.

430
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,174
They can't even take care of one monster?

431
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:15,801
No.

432
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,971
It's not just one.

433
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,353
Protein!

434
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,241
What's going on?

435
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,036
I don't know.

436
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,163
Maybe the world

437
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,291
is finally coming to an end.
