1
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:07,039
Hyah!

2
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:08,107
Aah!

3
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:11,910
(Exhales)

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,179
Not bad, Mickey,

5
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,115
but your form
needs work.

6
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:18,484
Spar with, uh,
someone else

7
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:20,652
while I confer
with captain black.

8
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:28,460
Sorry about
the hard knocks,
my friend,

9
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:32,331
but since section 13's
officially out of
the dark hand business,

10
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:36,168
I had to devise a way
to justify your overhead
to my superiors.

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,971
Did you put me on the books
as personal trainer,

12
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:40,773
or punching bag?

13
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:41,840
Jade: Hyah-ha!

14
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:42,908
(Gasps)

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,976
Jade!

16
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:45,477
What?

17
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,548
Oh, I, uh, told Mickey
to work on that form.

18
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,670
Shendu: Ah, ah...

19
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:46,071
Gingerly.

20
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:49,108
Watch your step.

21
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,310
Place it over
to the left...

22
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:53,445
Valmont:
And into the incinerator.

23
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,347
We could use some firewood.

24
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:56,515
Shendu:
Silence!

25
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:59,551
With some sprucing,
this fish heap

26
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:02,855
will be worthy of housing
a demon sorcerer--

27
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:05,858
valmont:
Ex-demon sorcerer.

28
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,260
Shendu:
- I may be vanquished,

29
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:11,063
but I am still
in charge, valmont,

30
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:12,931
as you can well see.

31
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:16,401
Valmont:
- This is my hideout,
and my body, shendu.

32
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:17,736
Which reminds me,

33
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:20,606
I have a change
of wardrobe
in mind for us.

34
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:21,673
(Gasps)

35
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:22,774
You wouldn't dare.

36
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,376
Aah!
Aah!

37
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:27,880
That is a thousand-year-old
heirloom

38
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:30,382
from the ling dynasty!

39
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:33,318
Well, maybe if
game geek over there
would have helped.

40
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,157
Oh...

41
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:42,661
Chow.

42
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,470
Shendu: Ah, yes.

43
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:55,474
Directions to the door
which contains tchangzu,

44
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:58,143
the thunder demon.

45
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:01,580
Hey, Cali-for-ni-yay.

46
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:02,981
We are here--

47
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,750
and we are to go south,

48
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:05,817
to--

49
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,024
you got that,
didn't you?

50
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,192
Uh...

51
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:14,626
Pretty much all of it,

52
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,995
before we, uh,
ran out of tape.

53
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:18,330
(Growls)

54
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:19,765
Dude, run.

55
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:20,966
(Shendu growls)

56
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,601
Aah!

57
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,039
(Gasps)

58
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,106
Water!

59
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,509
That's right, big v--

60
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:33,212
swimmin' pools
<i>and</i> movie stars.

61
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,214
We're headin' for...

62
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:36,348
Jackie: Hollywood?

63
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,150
I'm on my way,
captain black.

64
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:40,552
Jackie, can I come
with, please?

65
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,621
Jade,
the dark hand is there,

66
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:44,890
no doubt searching
for a demon portal.

67
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:48,026
But rafaello dicapezio
is getting his footprints
in cement

68
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,661
at the Chinese theater
this weekend.

69
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,230
Who-faello di-who-zio?

70
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:52,664
Hello?

71
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,600
Rafaello dicapezio
is only

72
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:56,902
the greatest movie star
in the history of...

73
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,136
History.

74
00:03:58,138 --> 00:03:59,371
Uncle: Ahh...

75
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:02,441
I guess you have never
heard of John Wayne.

76
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,410
Ahh, the Duke.

77
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,813
(Imitating John Wayne)
Saddle up, pilgrim.

78
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,084
Hmm, I suppose
this is one time

79
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,886
you could come along
and not be in the way.

80
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,455
Yes!

81
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:18,624
Hey, what's that
supposed to mean?

82
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,660
Jackie: Tohru will
be your chaperone,

83
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:23,562
while I search
for the dark hand.

84
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,964
Well, the festivities
aren't till tonight,

85
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,266
so why don't we
just take a minute

86
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:28,900
and help you find
the demon door?

87
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:32,938
Happy sightseeing.

88
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,378
I am so sorry
that I screamed, Jade.

89
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,079
Yeah, uh,

90
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,749
Frankenstein did look
pretty lifelike, t.

91
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,284
Must be all that wax.

92
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:49,187
Uh, maybe we should bring
back a souvenir for uncle.

93
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:52,524
Do you have any photos
of John Wayne?

94
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,467
Tohru.

95
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,612
Aw, we're
wanderin', anyway.

96
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:16,114
I want to see
Clark gable's old house.

97
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,150
Frankly, ratso,
I don't give a darn.

98
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,318
And who's wanderin'?

99
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,119
We got directions
right here.

100
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:24,523
Chow: Yeah. Halfway between
"the pools of despair"

101
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,124
and "the trail
of treachery."

102
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,893
It's all so clear.

103
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,929
(Cell phone rings)

104
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:32,064
Hello?

105
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,165
Jackie,
the dark hand guys

106
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,100
are right outside
the wax museum.

107
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:38,036
Uh, Jade,
how do you do that?

108
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,171
Never mind.

109
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,306
Do nothing
until I get there.

110
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:42,374
Can't hear you.

111
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:43,709
(Imitating static)

112
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:45,410
You're breaking...

113
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:46,611
Up.

114
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:49,114
Jade? Oh!

115
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:51,016
The wax museum--quickly!

116
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:54,219
Which do you think
uncle would like best?

117
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,620
Jade?

118
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,590
Jade: Look,
the 3 stooges!

119
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:00,125
Where?
Duh.

120
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:01,460
All: Hey!

121
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:13,972
Heh.

122
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,440
You must want this, huh?

123
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,080
Say "cheese," Princess.

124
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,316
"Cheese, Princess."

125
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,486
Tohru!

126
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,624
Maybe he'd
like to see
some real stars.

127
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,734
Finn: Chan!

128
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,537
Does this qualify
as being outnumbered?

129
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,671
Works for me.

130
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,609
Jade, are you all right?

131
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,210
Peachy. Jackie, I got--

132
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:54,946
what part of "do nothing"
didn't you understand?

133
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:57,816
But Jackie, I got--
watch her.

134
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:58,884
(Moans)

135
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:08,894
(Gasps)

136
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:11,296
I have waited
for this moment.

137
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,899
Prepare to meet
your doom.

138
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,676
I didn't know
the dark hand
had a new enforcer.

139
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,913
Hyah!

140
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,581
(Grunting)

141
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,719
Aah!

142
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:36,788
(Both grunting)

143
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,040
Wires?

144
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,477
Nigel: Cut!

145
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,580
Who are you?

146
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:02,881
This is a movie set?

147
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:05,450
Awesome. Are you gonna
put Jackie in your movie?

148
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:08,019
Oh, sure, after
I have him arrested!

149
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:10,255
Nigel, Nigel, calm down.

150
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:12,524
Larry Franklin, producer
of <i> ninjas in the hood.</i>

151
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,559
That was quite
a display the way you--

152
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:15,660
"bam" and "bam, bam!"

153
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,728
(Laughs)

154
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,730
- You have an agent?
- Uh...

155
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,432
That would be <i> moi.</i>

156
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:23,134
Bam, bam. This town's
gettin' younger every day.

157
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,769
Look, lar,

158
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,739
Jackie chan here is
going to be the next
big action superstar,

159
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,975
and you have
the opportunity

160
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,576
to get in on
the ground floor.

161
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,578
Jade.

162
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,514
Right, Jackie. Did I
mention that he does
all his own stunts?

163
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:36,648
Oh!

164
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,084
Give me a jingle.
If jc can act, bam--

165
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:40,352
we're in business.

166
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,454
(Scoffs)
Act? Jack--whoa!

167
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:45,423
Say bye-bye to
the nice man, Jade.

168
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:47,993
Jackie, play
your cards right,
and you can be a star.

169
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,594
I don't want
to be a star.

170
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,496
I want to find
the demon portal

171
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,198
before valmont's men do.

172
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,167
Oh, that.
It's in the bag.

173
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:00,105
Jade, how do you do that?

174
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,510
Jackie: If "the pools
of despair" are
the tar pits...

175
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:08,513
And "the trail
of treachery" is
the cahuenga pass...

176
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:12,284
Halfway should be
right here.

177
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:14,286
"Megagalactic studios?"

178
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:16,187
Boy, talk about
your co-ink-I-dink.

179
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:17,722
As long as we're
gonna be on the lot,

180
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,524
why don't we
"do lunch" with lar?

181
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,960
Because "we" had
a big breakfast.

182
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:29,868
Pass?

183
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,002
Uh...

184
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,637
Hey, you're
talkin' to the star

185
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,272
of <i> beach babewatch</i> here.

186
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,044
Oh, uh, sorry.

187
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:40,378
Go right ahead.

188
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,782
Oh! The dark hand?

189
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:46,618
Pass?

190
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,187
Yes, I would like to.

191
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,622
No, can't
let you on the lot

192
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,090
without a pass.

193
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:54,793
(Ring)

194
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:56,828
Good afternoon.

195
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,730
Jade arts talent agency.

196
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:00,298
Jade, I--

197
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,167
I can't get onto
the studio lot.

198
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:04,903
Yes, but--

199
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,705
yes, b-but--

200
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,506
ok, I'll do it.

201
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:10,075
(Telephone rings)
Jade? Hello?

202
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:12,177
Megagalactic studios.

203
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,311
Hey, sipowicz.

204
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:14,846
See the human
action figure

205
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,414
with the million-dollar
smile outside your gate?

206
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,917
He's Jackie chan,
the next big thing,

207
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,119
and he has a meeting
with <i> the</i> Larry Franklin.

208
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,520
So let me
give you lar's number

209
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,856
so you can explain
how we're about
to sign a deal

210
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:27,192
with another studio,
because you wouldn't let

211
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:29,561
the man who does his
own stunts onto the lot.

212
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,697
Uh, your pass?

213
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:35,200
Uh, sorry about
the inconvenience,
Mr. chan.

214
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,869
How does she do that?

215
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,673
You gettin' anything?

216
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:43,608
It's got to be
somewhere around here.

217
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,610
Sorry I can't
bring it back!
Thank you!

218
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:46,911
Chan!

219
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,079
Get him!

220
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,469
(Buzz)

221
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:13,571
Yes?

222
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:14,639
Oh, put her through.

223
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:15,740
Jade, what's up?

224
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:19,711
Lunch? Well,
let me check my--

225
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:20,779
whoa!

226
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,152
What goes up.

227
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,520
Woodchuck Chucks wood!

228
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:31,322
Whoa...

229
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,958
Aah!

230
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:38,229
Bam! He really does
do his own stunts.

231
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:39,764
Uh, of course he does.

232
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,934
So, Larry baby,
we're on for tomorrow?

233
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,102
You bet--heh--

234
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,904
unless your client's
in traction.

235
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:47,639
Jackie has a meeting.

236
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:50,208
I'm da bomb.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

237
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,745
Um, we're going to be late
for the footprint ceremony.

238
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:55,580
Rafaello, right!

239
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:57,382
Oh...

240
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,118
Ah, oh.

241
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,006
How come everyone
can do that?

242
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,541
Ah! Oh!

243
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,645
Huh? Wha--

244
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,849
the portal!

245
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,911
Greetings, tchangzu.

246
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:01,613
What took you so long?

247
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,815
Just the usual
interference

248
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:06,050
from Jackie chan.

249
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:09,487
Then he will
interfere no longer.

250
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,191
(Roars)

251
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,979
As the thunder claps,

252
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,249
so do I applaud
your skill, brother.

253
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:43,521
Shendu, you may
call me "master."

254
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,891
Of course...

255
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,526
Master.

256
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:50,228
Ooh, sss...

257
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,402
Now, take me
to my palace.

258
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:04,409
Oh, rubber is
an excellent insulator.

259
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,747
The surroundings
may not seem familiar,

260
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:11,683
but I assure you--

261
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,551
my palace!

262
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:18,556
These humans have
paved my paradise

263
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,658
and constructed a--

264
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,327
parking lot.

265
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,796
(Roar)

266
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:27,465
I will rebuild my palace.

267
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,601
For the time being, shendu,

268
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:32,837
you shall find a dwelling
place which befits me.

269
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,106
Uh, how 'bout
that one?

270
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,143
Hmm...

271
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:40,645
That will do.

272
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,452
Isn't he the dreamiest?

273
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,320
He's all right.

274
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,523
(Crowd murmuring)

275
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,293
Uh-oh.

276
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:57,996
Away, infidels!

277
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:00,899
(All murmuring)

278
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,901
Why do they not flee?

279
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,769
They think you are...

280
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,804
Entertainment.

281
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:09,107
Hmm...

282
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:10,408
Jade: Who's in charge here?

283
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,310
We specifically asked
that crowds be kept

284
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,012
at least 60 feet away.

285
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:15,513
What are you
talkin' about, miss?

286
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:18,249
How are we supposed to film
with all this interference?

287
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,652
Do you know how much
that animatronic suit cost?

288
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,289
Film?

289
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,658
They told us it was
a footprint ceremony.

290
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,894
Let's go.
Crowd control.

291
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:32,797
Wow, these agents are
gettin' younger every day.

292
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,434
Uncle: The immortal who cast
the original chi spell

293
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,037
on tchangzu,
the thunder demon

294
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,739
was patron deity
of actors.

295
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:44,842
And the portal was located
in a movie studio?

296
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:45,977
Weird.
(Cell phone rings)

297
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,178
Hello?

298
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,279
Where are you?

299
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,847
Duh. Chinese theater?

300
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:51,115
But so's
the thunder demon,

301
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,850
and he's packin'
serious boltage.

302
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:53,952
How do you do--

303
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:58,122
oh, Jade, do nothing
until I get there.

304
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,391
Jade never
does nothing.

305
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:02,160
I know, but I feel
I have to say it.

306
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,730
Jade: So raf, here's
all you gotta do.

307
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:07,332
When Jackie chan
comes running in--

308
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:08,666
Jackie who?

309
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:09,734
(Sighs)

310
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,469
Will you sign my arm?

311
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,505
I'm callin'
my manager.

312
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,874
He's not
so dreamy anymore.

313
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:19,677
Relax, t. Raf'll
come crawling back

314
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,380
once he reads about this
in tomorrow's papers.

315
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:23,781
Lar? Jade.

316
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,516
If you want to catch
Jackie in action,

317
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,585
come to the Chinese
theater pronto.

318
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,056
Where is the demon?

319
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:33,124
Inside.

320
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:34,592
Uncle,
the chi spell's ready?

321
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:35,927
I cannot prepare
the spell.

322
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,762
What?!
Need ingredients.

323
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:39,697
Why don't you have
ingredients?

324
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:42,133
How am I supposed to
gather chi ingredients

325
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:44,302
when you steal
my apprentice?

326
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:46,738
"Chaperone." Pahh.

327
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,406
Oh.

328
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:49,974
Chinatown. Hurry.

329
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:52,343
I'll try to keep
tchangzu inside.

330
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,117
Jackie!
What?

331
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,521
Please, Jade,
stay here.

332
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,793
Uncle: One more thing.

333
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:11,462
Powder of komodo
dragon tooth.

334
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,231
One more thing.

335
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:16,434
Tincture
of tortoise shell.

336
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,403
One more thing.

337
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:21,839
Castanets, the symbol
of tsao kuo-ch'iu.

338
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,474
(Crash)

339
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,443
In Chinatown?

340
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:31,215
Tchangzu: I will scorch
this city to the ground

341
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,285
while the sound
of thunder resonates!

342
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,921
Heh. Guy's
a regular Olivier.

343
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,759
Welcome to
the cheap seats, chan.

344
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,828
You!

345
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:48,366
I shall prove that lightning
can indeed strike twice.

346
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,234
Baah!

347
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,370
Aah!

348
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,272
Oh...

349
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,207
If life gives you lemons...

350
00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:59,977
Lar, glad you could make it.

351
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,112
Show's about to start.

352
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:02,513
What show?

353
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:04,449
Aah!

354
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,118
Bam!

355
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,453
Rhymes with chan.

356
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,058
State of the art.

357
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,593
You guys go all out.

358
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:17,929
Jade: Uncle!

359
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,530
Must prepare chi spell.

360
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,365
Hold these.

361
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,867
Who's the old guy?

362
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:25,303
Cranky co-star--
occasional comedy relief.

363
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,844
Forget chan!

364
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:36,347
If that accursed old man
completes his chi spell,

365
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:39,650
you will be cast
back into limbo.

366
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:41,519
That would
be our cue.

367
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,124
(Tohru grunts)

368
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:48,726
(Roars)

369
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:49,794
Aah!

370
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,531
(Gasps)

371
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:54,899
Uh, bam?

372
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:55,967
Oh!

373
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:01,506
Jade, play castanets, now!

374
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:04,342
He's also
our musical director.

375
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:05,910
(Uncle chanting)

376
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:17,722
(Grunts)

377
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:21,559
No!

378
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,401
Ole!

379
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,937
(Growls)

380
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,275
So, uh, lar, I'm
thinking buddy picture?

381
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:40,211
Chan and dicapezio,
dicapezio and chan.

382
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,882
There is no picture,

383
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:48,719
and Jackie chan
will never do lunch
in this town again

384
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,488
ever!

385
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,692
Lar didn't say anything
about dinner.

386
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:55,927
Come on, my treat.

387
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:57,428
We know of
- a Mexican restaurant

388
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,230
where uncle found
the castanets.

389
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:00,631
In Chinatown?

390
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:05,636
Hollywood is a strange
and mysterious place.

391
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,405
So we didn't get
a movie deal.

392
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:10,241
Jackie chan has definitely
made his mark in Hollywood.

393
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:19,884
Hey, Jackie,

394
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,919
have you ever met
anybody famous?

395
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,188
One year I was
doing, uh, Oscar.

396
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,457
I was standing
in the green room.

397
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,593
There's so many big stars
in the green room.

398
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:30,161
I see--wow, John Travolta.

399
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:31,562
Tom Hanks.

400
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,998
Oh, my god--
Sidney poitier.

401
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,367
I don't know what--
what should I say?

402
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,803
Suddenly,
- there's a voice--

403
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:40,371
"Jackie chan,
can I shake your hand?

404
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,974
I turn around--
Robin Williams.

405
00:20:42,976 --> 00:20:45,109
He said, "Jackie,
I'm a big fan of yours.

406
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,745
You are great."
That makes me proud.
