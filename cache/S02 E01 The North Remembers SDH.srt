1
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,659
(Both yelling)

2
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,215
(Crowd cheering)

3
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,135
Well struck.

4
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,887
Well struck, dog.

5
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,726
Did you like that?

6
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,686
It was well struck, your grace.

7
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,230
I already said it was well struck.

8
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,192
Yes, your grace.

9
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,202
- Who's next?
- Herald: Lothor brune,

10
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,497
freerider in the service of lord baelish.

11
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,750
Ser dontos the red of house hollard.

12
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,464
Ser dontos the red of house hollard!

13
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,965
Dontos: Here I am.

14
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,051
Here I am.

15
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,892
Sorry, your grace.

16
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,687
My deepest apologies.

17
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,397
- Joffrey: Are you drunk?
- No.

18
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,191
No. No, your grace.

19
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,860
- I had two cups of wine.
- Two cups?

20
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,862
That's not much at all.

21
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,573
Please, have another cup.

22
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,117
Are you sure, your grace?

23
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,494
Yes. To celebrate my name day.

24
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,996
Have two. Have as much as you like.

25
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,916
I would be honored, your grace.

26
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,629
Ser meryn, help ser dontos
celebrate my name day.

27
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,756
See that he drinks his fill.

28
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,343
(Crowd gasps)

29
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,315
(Gurgung)

30
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,901
You can't.

31
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,112
What did you say?

32
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,240
Did you say I can't?

33
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,908
I only meant

34
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,870
it would be bad luck
to kill a man on your name day.

35
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,122
What kind of stupid
peasant's superstition...

36
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,040
Hound: The girl is right.

37
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:12,419
What a man sows on his name day,
he reaps all year.

38
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,212
- (Men laughing)
- (Wine pouring)

39
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,797
(Joffrey sighs)

40
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,382
Take him away.

41
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,509
I'll have him killed tomorrow, the fool.

42
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,220
(Crowd murmuring)

43
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,141
He is a fool. You're so clever to see it.

44
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,394
He'll make a much
better fool than a knight.

45
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:32,481
He doesn't deserve
the mercy of a quick death.

46
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,985
Did you hear my lady, ser dontos?

47
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:40,113
From this day, you'll be my new fool.

48
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,407
Thank you, your grace.

49
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,619
And you, my lady, thank you.

50
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,370
Tyrion: Beloved nephew.

51
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,422
We looked for you on the battlefield.

52
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:02,052
You were nowhere to be found.

53
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,639
I've been here, ruling the kingdoms.

54
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,391
What a fine job you've done.

55
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,560
Look at you.

56
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,189
More beautiful than ever.

57
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,982
And you!

58
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,318
You're going to be bigger than the hound,

59
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,821
- but much better looking.
- (Laughs)

60
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,823
This one doesn't like me.

61
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,741
Can't imagine why.

62
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,327
- We heard you were dead.
- I'm glad you're not dead.

63
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,997
Me, too, dear. Death is so boring,

64
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,376
especially now,
with so much excitement in the world.

65
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,711
My lady, I'm sorry for your loss.

66
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,840
Her loss?

67
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,842
Her father was a confessed traitor.

68
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,510
But still her father.

69
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,593
Surely, having so recently lost your own
beloved father, you can sympathize.

70
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,436
My father was a traitor.

71
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,397
My mother and brother are traitors, too.

72
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,983
I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.

73
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,945
Of course you are.

74
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:07,826
Well, enjoy your name day, your grace.

75
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,578
Wish I could stay and celebrate,

76
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,455
but there is work to be done.

77
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,541
What work?

78
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,585
Why are you here?

79
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:24,676
Pycelle: A raven arrived from the citadel
this morning, your grace.

80
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,927
(Bird squawking)

81
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,596
The conclave has met,

82
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:31,141
considered reports from maesters
all over the seven kingdoms,

83
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,352
and declared this great summer

84
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,272
done at last.

85
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,150
The longest summer in living memory.

86
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,778
The peasants say, a long summer means
an even longer winter.

87
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,614
Pycelle: A common superstition.

88
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,074
Littlefinger: We have
enough wheat for a five-year winter.

89
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,493
If it lasts any longer,

90
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,038
we'll have fewer peasants.

91
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,499
The city's drowning in refugees,
your grace, fleeing the war.

92
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,628
We have nowhere to house them. And
with winter coming, it'll only get worse.

93
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:03,006
You command the city watch,
do you not, lord slynt?

94
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,092
I do, your grace.

95
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,178
And are you not a lord at my command?

96
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,848
I owe my title and lands
to your generosity, your grace.

97
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,434
Then do your job.
Shut the gates to the peasants.

98
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,437
They belong in the field, not our capital.

99
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,105
Yes, your grace.

100
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,523
(Tyrion whistling tune)

101
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:26,905
Don't get up.

102
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,952
More ravishing than ever, big sister.

103
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,914
War agrees with you.

104
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,541
Forgive the interruption. Carry on.

105
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,503
What are you doing here?

106
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,215
It's been a remarkable journey.

107
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,885
I pissed off the edge of the wall,

108
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,805
I slept in a sky cell,

109
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,057
I fought with the hill tribes.

110
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,684
So many adventures,

111
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,521
so much to be thankful for.

112
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:03,483
What are you doing here?
This is the small council.

113
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:08,321
Yes, well, I do believe the hand of the king
is welcome at all small council meetings.

114
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,115
Our father is hand of the king.

115
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,201
Yes, but in his absence...

116
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,877
Varys: Your father has named lord Tyrion

117
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,505
to serve as hand in
his stead while he fights.

118
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,008
Out! All of you out!

119
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,557
I would like to know
how you tricked father into this.

120
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,185
If I were capable of tricking father,
I'd be emperor of the world by now.

121
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,813
You brought this on yourself.

122
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,314
I've done nothing.

123
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,191
Quite right, you did nothing

124
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,527
when your son called for ned stark's head.

125
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,529
Now the entire north
has risen up against us.

126
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,032
- I tried to stop it.
- Did you? You failed.

127
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,326
That bit of theater
will haunt our family for a generation.

128
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,289
- Robb stark is a child.
- Who's won every battle he's fought.

129
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,708
Do you understand we're losing the war?

130
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,878
- What do you know about warfare?
- Nothing.

131
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,713
But I know people.

132
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:11,468
And I know that our enemies hate each other
almost as much as they hate us.

133
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,725
- Joffrey is king.
- Joffrey is king.

134
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,144
You are here to advise him.

135
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,896
I'm only here to advise him.

136
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,482
And if the king listens to what I say,

137
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,069
the king mightjust get
his uncle Jaime back.

138
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,322
How?

139
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,948
You love your children.

140
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,077
It's your one redeeming quality.
That and your cheekbones.

141
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,414
The starks love their children as well.

142
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,708
- And we have two of them.
- One.

143
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,421
- One?
- Arya, little animal, she disappeared.

144
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,508
Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke?

145
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,554
We had three starks to trade.

146
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,265
You chopped one's head off
and let another escape.

147
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,352
Father will be furious.

148
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,979
It must be odd for you

149
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,943
to be the disappointing child.

150
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,246
Leadranach: My lord, may the old gods
watch over your brother

151
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,957
and all our northern sons.

152
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,877
The walls of my holdfast
will not stand the winter.

153
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:32,090
The stones were last mortared
in the time of king aerys,

154
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:36,761
and I'm afraid the masons today are
not fit to carry their fathers' hammers.

155
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,597
When I was a boy,

156
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:45,061
I remember seeing them put up a new tower
at torrhen's square in a summer.

157
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,105
Men worked back then.

158
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:52,485
Today, my holdfast looks like it was built
by drunk children.

159
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:56,656
At night you can hear the wind
howling through the gaps.

160
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,992
Gods forbid it rains.

161
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,911
Why, I might as well
sleep beneath a waterfall.

162
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:06,916
Maintenance of a holdfast generally falls
to the lord of that holdfast.

163
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,501
Generally, yes,

164
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:12,005
but I've sent all the young men off
to fight robb stark's war.

165
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,216
King robb. And it's not his war.

166
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,177
He didn't choose it.

167
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,763
Maybe not, my lord, but he called
in his banners and took the men.

168
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,515
Joffrey killed my father,

169
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,018
your liege lord.

170
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,478
Do you remember your vows, ser?

171
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,397
Of course I remember!

172
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,525
We can spare four masons
for a week, my lord.

173
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,570
Will that be sufficient
to repair your walls?

174
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,697
I believe it will.

175
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,623
We didn't want him here all day, did we?

176
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,501
I didn't like the way
he was talking about robb.

177
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,253
Nor did I.

178
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,592
But listening to people
you'd rather not listen to

179
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:01,554
is one of your responsibilities
as lord of winterfell.

180
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,306
(Bran sighs)

181
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,893
Lord portan.

182
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,896
My lord, may the old gods
watch over your brother

183
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,648
and all our northern sons.

184
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,902
(Heavy breathing)

185
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,035
- (Wings flapping)
- (Bird squawking)

186
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:04,033
Boil this for an hour and drink the tea.

187
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,537
Makes all your pain go away.

188
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,122
Bran: Don't have any pain.

189
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:11,708
Lucky for you.

190
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,294
That way.

191
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,799
You've been having those dreams again.

192
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,551
Bran: I don't dream.

193
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,136
Everyone dreams.

194
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,804
I don't.

195
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,224
Heard some of the men
talking about the comet.

196
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,518
They say it's an omen.

197
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:34,022
They say it means robb
will win a great victory in the south.

198
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,565
Did they?

199
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,154
I heard some other fools say
it's Lannister red.

200
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,407
Means the lannisters
will rule all seven kingdoms before long.

201
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,952
Heard a stable boy
say it's the color of blood

202
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,204
to Mark the death of your father.

203
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,337
The stars don't fall for men.

204
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,881
Red comet means one thing, boy.

205
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,592
Dragons.

206
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,347
The dragons are all dead.

207
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,766
They've been dead for centuries.

208
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,258
(Shrieks)

209
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,054
Mmm.

210
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,728
What did your brother say
about them, khaleesi?

211
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,480
He said they ate meat.

212
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,149
He didn't tell you what kind of meat?

213
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,237
My brother didn't know
anything about dragons.

214
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,323
He didn't know anything about anything.

215
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,667
(Whinnies)

216
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,422
(Women murmuring)

217
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,234
She was drogo's first gift to me.

218
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,028
I remember.

219
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,783
I promised to protect them.

220
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,119
Promised them
their enemies would die screaming.

221
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,580
How do I make starvation scream?

222
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,374
A trick I never learned, I'm afraid.

223
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,712
Does it ever end?

224
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,630
This is further east than I've ever been.

225
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,800
But, yes, khaleesi,
everything ends, even the red waste.

226
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,303
And you're sure there's no other way?

227
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,014
If we go south to the
land of the lhazareen,

228
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,600
the lamb men will kill us
and take your dragons.

229
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,477
If we go west to the Dothraki sea,

230
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,147
the first khalasar we meet
will kill us and take your dragons.

231
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,649
No one will take my dragons.

232
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,653
They are too weak to fight,

233
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,822
as are your people.

234
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,991
You must be their strength.

235
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,036
As you are mine.

236
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,458
(Speaks Dothraki)

237
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:51,677
Rakharo, aggo, kovarro.
Take our remaining horses.

238
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:56,182
You will ride east, you southeast,
and you northeast.

239
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,560
What do we seek, khaleesi?

240
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:05,775
Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people.
Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea.

241
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:11,447
Find how far the red waste extends
before us, and what lies on the other side.

242
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,282
(Speaks Dothraki)

243
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,751
Rakharo.

244
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,797
You are my last hope, blood of my blood.

245
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,384
I will not fail you, blood of my blood.

246
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,303
You never have.

247
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,770
This is bad time to start.

248
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,494
(Horse whinnies)

249
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,517
(Wind howling)

250
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,120
Having a rough time of it?

251
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,705
Nothing's killed me yet.

252
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,458
- Grenn: Your arse killed the sledge.
- You offered me a ride.

253
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,461
I just wanted you to shut up
about your damn blisters.

254
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,519
I was born in a place like this.

255
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,522
Later, I fell on hard times.

256
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,026
Samwell: Are those girls?

257
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,861
Dolorous edd: Craster's daughters.

258
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,573
I haven't seen a girl in six months.

259
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,742
I'd keep on not seeing them if I were you.

260
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,912
What, he don't like people
messing with his daughters?

261
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,581
He don't like people
messing with his wives.

262
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,420
He marries his daughters,
and they give him more daughters.

263
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,589
And on and on it goes.

264
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,550
- That's foul.
- It's beyond foul.

265
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:40,471
All the other wildlings
for a hundred leagues have disappeared.

266
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,515
Craster's still here.

267
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,017
He must be doing something right.

268
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,521
What happens to the boys?

269
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,524
He marries his daughters.

270
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,485
What does he do with his sons?

271
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,075
He said he planned to stop here
on his way to the frostfangs.

272
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,743
People make all sorts of plans.

273
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:06,205
I haven't seen benjen stark in three years.

274
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,707
Haven't missed him.

275
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,376
Always treated me like scum.

276
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,463
Haven't had any good wine for a long time.

277
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,383
You southerners make good wine,
I'll give you that.

278
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,385
We're not southerners.

279
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,095
Who's this little girl?

280
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,433
You're prettier than half my daughters.

281
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:28,811
You got a nice wet twat between your legs?

282
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,646
What's your name?

283
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,648
- Jon snow.
- Snow, eh?

284
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,651
Listen to me, bastard.

285
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:39,697
All you lot from south of the wall,
you're southerners.

286
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,451
But now you're in the
north, the real north.

287
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:44,994
The lad meant no harm.

288
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:50,082
I catch that pretty little bastard
talking to my daughters...

289
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:54,044
No one will talk to your daughters,
you have my word.

290
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:57,173
Now, sit down and shut your mouth.

291
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,428
You bring any of that good wine with you?

292
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,096
We did.

293
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,807
We passed through
six villages on the way here.

294
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,768
All six were abandoned.

295
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,729
Where have all the wildlings gone?

296
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,191
I could tell you, but I'm thirsty.

297
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,711
Mormont: There's a barrel of dornish wine
on the sledge.

298
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,321
- Bring it in here.
- Man: Yes, commander.

299
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,491
Craster: You want to know
where they've all gone?

300
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:27,578
North, to join up with mance rayder.

301
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,706
Your old friend.

302
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,334
He's no friend of mine.

303
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:37,797
- He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers.
- Aye.

304
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,966
But once he was just a poor black crow.

305
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,886
And now he's king-beyond-the-wall.

306
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,388
He's been calling himself that for years.

307
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:50,059
What's he king of? A frozen lake somewhere?

308
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,604
That's a good-looking ax.

309
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,648
Fresh forged?

310
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,235
Give it here.

311
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,530
You'll have another one
made at castle black.

312
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,573
Here.

313
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,118
That's some lovely steel.

314
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:15,000
You want to know
what mance rayder is doing?

315
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,418
Gathering an army.

316
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,840
What I hear, he's already got more men
than any of your southern kings.

317
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:24,176
And where does he plan marching this army?

318
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,221
When you're all the way north,
there's only one direction to go.

319
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:33,811
These are bad times to be
living alone in the wild.

320
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,313
The cold winds are rising.

321
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:41,026
Let them come. My roots are sunk deep.

322
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,572
Wife,

323
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:48,617
tell the lord crow how content we are.

324
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,036
This is our place.

325
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,913
Our husband keeps us safe.

326
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:56,000
Better to live free than die a slave.

327
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,505
Craster: Don't it make
you jealous, old man,

328
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:06,886
to see me with all these young wives
and you with no one to warm your bed?

329
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:09,013
We chose different paths.

330
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:13,267
Aye, and you chose the path
with no one but boys on it.

331
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:18,272
You'll be wanting to sleep
beneath my roof, I suppose,

332
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,441
and eat me out of pigs.

333
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,401
A roof would be welcome.

334
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,903
It's been hard riding.

335
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:27,197
We've brought our own food
and good steel for you.

336
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,536
Any man lays a hand on one of my wives,

337
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,247
he loses the hand.

338
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:41,211
And I see this one staring too long,

339
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:44,298
I mightjust gouge his eyes out.

340
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,718
Your roof, your rules.

341
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,648
(Grunts)

342
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,399
Who am I?

343
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:06,612
- Who am I?
- Lord commander.

344
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,782
- And who are you?
- Jon snow.

345
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,241
Who are you?

346
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:14,203
Your steward.

347
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,705
You want to lead one day?

348
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,961
Then learn how to follow.

349
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,518
(Man panting)

350
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,232
Melisandre: Lord of light,
come to us in our darkness.

351
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:47,361
We offer you these false gods.

352
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:51,115
Take them and cast your light upon us,

353
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:56,245
for the night is dark and full of terrors.

354
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:00,249
Men: For the night is
dark and full of terrors.

355
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,545
Melisandre: After the long summer,

356
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,506
darkness will fall heavy on the world.

357
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,175
The stars will bleed.

358
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,845
We need to stop her.

359
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,682
Melisandre: The cold breath of winter
will freeze the seas...

360
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:20,936
- Not now.
- And the dead shall rise in the north.

361
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:26,275
All you men were named
in the light of the seven!

362
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,403
Is this how you treat
the gods of your fathers?

363
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:34,074
Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?

364
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,085
You smell of fear,

365
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:49,131
fear and piss and old bones.

366
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,217
Do you want to stop me?

367
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,599
Stop me.

368
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,280
In the ancient books, it's written

369
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:17,076
that a warrior will draw
a burning sword from the fire.

370
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:21,413
And that sword shall be lightbringer.

371
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,797
Stannis Baratheon,

372
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,382
warrior of light,

373
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,218
your sword awaits you.

374
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,491
(Men cheering)

375
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,960
Men: Lord, cast your light upon us!

376
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,840
Melisandre:
For the night is dark and full of terrors.

377
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:19,096
For the night is dark and full of terror.

378
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:50,002
This woman will lead him
into a war he cannot win.

379
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,670
Stannis is our king.

380
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,172
We follow where he leads,

381
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,757
- even if we don't like the path.
- King.

382
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:59,928
Since that boar killed his brother,
every lord wants a coronation.

383
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:02,181
I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.

384
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:03,891
As do I,

385
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:07,603
but loyal service
means telling hard truths.

386
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,690
He's surrounded by fools and fanatics,

387
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,819
but he trusts you, davos.

388
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,488
If you tell him the truth...

389
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,950
What's the truth?

390
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:38,234
Matthos: "And I declare upon the honor of
my house that my beloved brother Robert..."

391
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,802
He wasn't my beloved brother.

392
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,971
I didn't love him. He didn't love me.

393
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:44,890
A harmless courtesy, your grace.

394
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,016
A lie. Take it out.

395
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,104
"That my brother Robert
left no trueborn heirs,

396
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:55,776
"the boy Joffrey, the boy tommen,
and the girl myrcella being born of incest

397
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,904
"between Cersei Lannister
and her brother Jaime Lannister.

398
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,740
- "By right of birth..."
- Jaime Lannister, the kingslayer.

399
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,158
Call him what he is.

400
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,663
"And her brother Jaime Lannister,
the kingslayer."

401
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,041
"By right of birth and blood,
I do this day lay claim..."

402
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:14,002
Stannis: Make it ser Jaime Lannister,
the kingslayer.

403
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,129
Whatever else he is,
the man's still a knight.

404
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,548
"Ser Jaime Lannister, the kingslayer.

405
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,842
"By right of birth and blood,

406
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,971
"I do this day lay claim
to the iron throne of Westeros.

407
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,682
"Let all true men declare their loyalty."

408
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,059
When Eddard stark learned
the truth, he told only me.

409
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,353
I'll not make the same mistake.

410
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,498
Send copies of that letter
to every corner of the realm,

411
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,440
from the arbor to the wall.

412
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,693
The time has come to choose.

413
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,862
Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse.

414
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,448
Your grace, the lannisters are
the true enemy.

415
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,677
If, for the time being,
you could make peace with your brother...

416
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,845
I'll not make peace
with renly while he calls himself king.

417
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,663
Well, many have already declared for him,

418
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:51,957
mace Tyrell, randyll tarly.

419
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,252
Stannis does not need
to beg this lord or that lord for support.

420
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,837
The lord of light stands behind him.

421
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,173
And how many ships
has the lord of light got in his fleet?

422
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:02,718
- He has no need for ships.
- Davos: I'm sure he doesn't,

423
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,344
but we do if we're going to war.

424
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,472
If not renly, your grace,
join forces with robb stark.

425
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,641
Who would steal
the northern half of my kingdom.

426
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:13,145
I've always served thieves according to
their deserts, as you well know, ser davos.

427
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,273
Joffrey, renly, robb
stark, they're all thieves.

428
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,775
They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them.

429
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:22,571
I owe you an apology, my king.

430
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,365
My duty is to serve.

431
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:29,578
You have chosen the new god
over the old gods.

432
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:33,040
May the lord of light watch over us all.

433
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:35,459
Shall we drink together?

434
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:42,090
A cup of wine to honor the one true god.

435
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,051
(Thuds)

436
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,135
(Men murmuring)

437
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,640
The night is dark and
full of terrors, old man,

438
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,810
but the fire burns them all away.

439
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,192
(Chatter)

440
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,847
King in the north.

441
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:18,311
I keep expecting you to leave me
in one castle or another for safekeeping,

442
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:21,273
but you drag me along from camp to camp.

443
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,110
Have you grown fond of me, stark?

444
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,987
Is that it?

445
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,864
I've never seen you with a girl.

446
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,451
If I left you with one of my bannermen,

447
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:35,537
your father would know within a fortnight

448
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,166
and my bannerman would receive
a raven with a message,

449
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:42,794
"release my son
and you'll be rich beyond your dreams.

450
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:46,298
"Refuse and your house
will be destroyed, root and stem."

451
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:50,886
You don't trust the loyalty
of the men following you into battle?

452
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,013
Oh, I trust them with my life,

453
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:55,557
just not with yours.

454
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,143
Smart boy.

455
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,145
What's wrong?

456
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,813
Don't like being called "boy"?

457
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:04,733
Insufled?

458
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,153
(Grey wind snarling)

459
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:14,743
Robb: You insult yourself, kingslayer.

460
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,997
- You've been defeated by a boy.
- (Heavy breathing)

461
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,209
You're held captive by a boy.

462
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,922
Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy.

463
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,557
Stannis Baratheon sent ravens
to all the high lords of Westeros.

464
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,687
King Joffrey Baratheon
is neither a true king

465
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,398
nor a true Baratheon.

466
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,692
He's your bastard son.

467
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,111
If that's true, Stannis
is the rightful king.

468
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,239
How convenient for him.

469
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:56,576
My father learned the truth.

470
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,286
That's why you had him executed.

471
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,622
I was your prisoner
when ned stark lost his head.

472
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:04,376
Your son killed him so the world
wouldn't learn who fathered him.

473
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,710
And you,

474
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,090
you pushed my brother from a window
because he saw you with the queen.

475
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:17,305
You have proof?

476
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,059
Or do you want to trade gossip
like a couple of fishwives?

477
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:25,021
I'm sending one of your cousins down to
king's landing with my peace terms.

478
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:27,524
You think my father's going
to negotiate with you?

479
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,443
You don't know him very well.

480
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:34,114
No, but he's starting to know me.

481
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:38,451
Three victories don't make you a conqueror.

482
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,496
It's better than three defeats.

483
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,007
(Snarling)

484
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,819
Shae: This city stinks.

485
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,657
Like dead bodies.

486
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,826
Tyrion: A bit corpsey, yes.

487
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,370
And shit.

488
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,039
I thought you wanted to come here.

489
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,085
I love it.

490
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:33,048
You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?

491
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,676
And cum and garlic and rum.

492
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,262
You can smell cum from the balcony?

493
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:43,308
I love the stink. I love the noise.

494
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,393
Cities make me want to fuck.

495
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,563
And so did the country.

496
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,733
(Sighs)

497
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,318
This is where I belong.

498
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,196
Yes, well, you need to be careful.

499
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,822
No one can know you're here.

500
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,491
No one will know.

501
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,284
You can't trust anyone in king's landing.

502
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:04,329
They're all liars, good liars, bad liars,

503
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,831
one or two great liars.

504
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,792
What about you?

505
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,628
Me? I'm not from here.
I'm a slave to the truth.

506
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,381
(Laughs) Truth?

507
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:19,344
You are the biggest
little liar I have ever met.

508
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,388
Why do you think I am so little?

509
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:25,767
I'm being crushed beneath
the weight of all that truth.

510
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,982
Ned stark actually slept on this.

511
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:36,695
As if the poor man didn't suffer enough.

512
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,117
One of the many changes
we'll have to make around here.

513
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,213
Lord baelish.

514
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,548
Your grace.

515
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,092
I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.

516
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,719
Of course, your grace.

517
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,721
Ned stark's youngest daughter Arya,

518
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:04,973
we can't seem to locate her.

519
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,602
If she's escaped the capital,
winterfell seems the logical destination.

520
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,105
And yet my friends in the north
report no sign of her.

521
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,065
Curious.

522
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,234
If we choose to negotiate with the starks,

523
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,319
the girl has some value.
Whoever finds her...

524
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,655
Well, you know what they say
about lannisters and debts.

525
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:23,116
Well, you could ask varys where she is.

526
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,452
He'll have an answer for you.

527
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:26,953
Whether you believe it...

528
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:31,040
Myself, I have always had
a hard time trusting eunuchs.

529
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:33,585
Who knows what they want?

530
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,587
A mockingbird.

531
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,674
- You created your own sigil, didn't you?
- Yes.

532
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:44,429
Appropriate, for a self-made man
with so many songs to sing.

533
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,097
I'm glad you like it.

534
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:49,642
Some people are fortunate enough
to be born into the right family.

535
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:52,187
Others have to find their own way.

536
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,774
I heard a song once

537
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,443
about a boy of modest means

538
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,029
who found his way into the home
of a very prominent family.

539
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,990
He loved the eldest daughter.

540
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,409
Sadly, she had eyes for another.

541
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:11,748
When boys and girls live in the same home,
awkward situations can arise.

542
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:17,128
Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers
and sisters develop certain affections.

543
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,215
And when those affections
become common knowledge,

544
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:24,135
well, that is an awkward situation indeed,

545
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,346
especially in a prominent family.

546
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,723
But prominent families
often forget a simple truth,

547
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,184
I've found.

548
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,270
And which truth is that?

549
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,689
Knowledge is power.

550
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:42,487
Seize him.

551
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,241
Cut his throat.

552
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:49,077
Stop. Wait.

553
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:52,247
I've changed my mind. Let him go.

554
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,918
Step back three paces.

555
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,129
Turn around.

556
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,340
Close your eyes.

557
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,263
Power is power.

558
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:14,686
Do see if you can take some time away
from your coins and your whores

559
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,604
to locate the stark girl for me.

560
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,357
I would very much appreciate it.

561
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,120
Robb: You're ser alton Lannister?

562
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,789
I am, your grace.

563
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:38,251
Robb: I offer your cousins peace
if they meet my terms.

564
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:42,630
First, your family must release my sisters.

565
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,259
Second, my father's bones
must be returned to us

566
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:51,055
so he may rest beside his brother and
sister in the crypts beneath winterfell.

567
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:55,143
And the remains of all those who died
in his service must also be returned.

568
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,104
Their families can honor them
with proper funerals.

569
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,982
- An honorable request, your grace.
- Third...

570
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:07,322
Joffrey and the queen regent must renounce
all claim to dominion of the north.

571
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:12,660
From this time till the end of time,
we are a free and independent kingdom.

572
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,746
The king in the north.

573
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,248
- King in the north.
- King in the north.

574
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:21,044
Neither Joffrey nor any of his men
shall set foot in our lands again.

575
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,129
If he disregards this command,

576
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:26,090
he shall suffer the same fate as my father,

577
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:30,929
only I don't need a servant
to do my beheading for me.

578
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:34,390
These are... your grace, these are...

579
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,976
These are my terms.

580
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,146
If the queen regent and her son meet them,
I'll give them peace.

581
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,522
If not,

582
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,777
I will litter the south
with Lannister dead.

583
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,571
King Joffrey is a Baratheon, your grace.

584
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,198
Oh, is he?

585
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:54,160
You'll ride at daybreak, ser alton.

586
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,455
That will be all for tonight.

587
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,430
A word, your grace?

588
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,977
You don't have to call me "your grace"
when no one's around.

589
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,688
It's not so bad once you get used to it.

590
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,731
I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.

591
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,932
The lannisters are going
to reject your terms, you know?

592
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,820
Of course they are.

593
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,197
We can fight them
in the fields as long as you like,

594
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,575
but we won't beat them
until you take king's landing.

595
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:39,622
And we can't take king's landing
without ships.

596
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,166
My father has ships
and men who know how to sail them.

597
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,002
Men who fought my father.

598
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:46,337
Men who fought king Robert
to free themselves

599
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:50,091
from the yoke of the south,
just like you're doing now.

600
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,428
I'm his only living son.

601
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,557
He'll listen to me. I know he will.

602
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:02,770
I'm not a stark. I know that.

603
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:06,274
But your father raised me
to be an honorable man.

604
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,611
We can avenge him together.

605
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,907
You don't want balon greyjoy for an ally.

606
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:17,285
I need his ships. They say he has 200.

607
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:21,247
They say a million rats
live in the sewers of king's landing.

608
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,832
Shall we rally them to fight for us?

609
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,792
I understand you don't trust lord greyjoy.

610
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:28,671
I don't trust lord greyjoy
because he is not trustworthy.

611
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,050
Your father had to go to war
to end his rebellion.

612
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:35,887
Yes. And now I'm the one
rebelling against the throne.

613
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,222
Before me, it was father.

614
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:40,026
You married one rebel and mothered another.

615
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,977
I mothered more than just rebels,

616
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,271
a fact you seem to have forgotten.

617
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:49,609
If I trade the kingslayer for two girls,
my bannermen will string me up by my feet.

618
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,904
You want to leave sansa
in the queen's hands?

619
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,989
And Arya...

620
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:59,827
I haven't heard a word about Arya.
What are we fighting for, if not for them?

621
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:03,456
It's more complicated than that!
You know it is.

622
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,515
It's time for me to go home.

623
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:24,519
I haven't seen bran or rickon in months.

624
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,814
You can't go to winterfell.

625
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,149
I beg your pardon?

626
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:33,611
I'll send rodrik to watch over the boys

627
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:38,074
because tomorrow
you'll ride south to the stormlands.

628
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,159
Why in the name of all the gods...

629
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:44,038
Because I need you
to negotiate with renly Baratheon.

630
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,207
He's rallied an army of 100,000.

631
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,042
You know him. You know his family.

632
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,503
I haven't seen renly Baratheon
since he was a boy.

633
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,906
You have a hundred other lords...

634
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:54,966
Which of these lords
do I trust more than you?

635
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,678
If renly sides with us,

636
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,264
we'll outnumber them two to one.

637
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,142
When they feel the jaws beginning to shut,
they'll sue for peace.

638
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,894
We'll get the girls back.

639
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:09,897
Then we'll all go home, for good.

640
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,283
I will ride at first light.

641
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,295
We will all be together
again soon, I promise.

642
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,303
You've done so well.

643
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:44,515
Your father would be proud.

644
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:56,360
- Give lord renly my regards.
- King renly.

645
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,156
There's a king in every corner now.

646
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,046
What is all this?

647
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,216
Returning this room to
its proper appearance.

648
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:21,177
Say what you will about the targaryens,
they were conquerors.

649
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,888
That is a seat for a conqueror.

650
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:27,558
It needs a room to match it,
not vines and flowers.

651
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:30,061
We can't find Arya stark.

652
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,146
With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere.

653
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,273
Perhaps. But if not, we need her.

654
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:36,609
They'll never give Jaime back
to us for sansa alone.

655
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,195
I think they might. They're weak.

656
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,197
They put too much value on their women.

657
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,909
We need to set our armies
to the task of finding her.

658
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,953
Send out as many men as we can.

659
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:48,913
I'm sure if you asked grandfather...

660
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,749
The king does not ask, he commands.

661
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:55,628
And my grandfather's stupidity
in the field of battle

662
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,547
is the reason robb stark
has uncle Jaime in the first place.

663
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,508
His life is in danger.

664
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,052
We're at war.

665
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,263
All our lives are in danger.

666
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:11,936
I heard a disgusting lie about uncle Jaime.

667
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,021
And you.

668
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:19,026
Our enemies will say anything
to weaken your claim to the throne.

669
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,987
It's not a claim. The throne is mine.

670
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,365
Of course it is.

671
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,452
No one believes this foul gossip.

672
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:30,538
Someone believes it.

673
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:34,125
Father had other children?

674
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,961
Besides me and tommen and myrcella?

675
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,546
(Hammers clattering)

676
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,923
What are you asking?

677
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:44,260
I'm asking if he fucked other women
when he grew tired of you.

678
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,679
How many bastards does he have running...

679
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,848
(Work stops)

680
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:06,741
What you just did is punishable by death.

681
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,330
You will never do it again.

682
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,665
Never.

683
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,798
That will be all, mother.

684
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,597
(Screaming)

685
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,640
No, no, no, no.

686
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:34,518
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

687
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,020
Ease into it.

688
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:39,106
Slowly, with passion.

689
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:42,777
Oh, yeah.

690
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,781
Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on.

691
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,367
Both of you are working tonight.

692
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,206
We do things differently here, Daisy.

693
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:59,168
This isn't some five-copper
bawdy house in hayseed hall.

694
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,837
- Haystack hall.
- Wherever you're from.

695
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:06,384
Our establishment doesn't cater
to plowmen and goat herders.

696
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,219
Lord Olsen.

697
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,221
Taste is everything here.

698
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,223
Littlefinger's a fancy man.

699
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,933
Don't call him littlefinger.

700
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,434
He doesn't like it.

701
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:17,853
Lord baelish.

702
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,694
She pretends she doesn't
speak the common tongue

703
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:28,364
so that people will think she's exotic.

704
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,242
She grew up just down the road
in flea bottom.

705
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,786
She's beautiful.

706
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:37,164
She's a dumb slut, really,
but a lid for every pot.

707
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,333
(Armor rattling)

708
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,547
Lord commander.

709
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,466
Good to see you again.

710
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:53,639
(Snaps fingers)

711
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,457
- (Door breaks)
- (People scream)

712
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:06,527
You do realize this establishment
is owned by lord petyr baelish,

713
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,779
the king's master of coin.

714
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,698
Coin which goes in many pockets.

715
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,409
- Orders.
- Whose orders?

716
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:16,245
Someone who doesn't care
what littlefinger thinks.

717
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,372
(Woman sobbing)

718
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:24,962
(Baby crying)

719
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:37,141
No, you can't. No! Please!

720
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,352
No! Not my barra!

721
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:43,856
- Please. Please.
- Enough. Get it done.

722
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,816
- Kill the bastard.
- Woman: No, no!

723
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,319
- Please.
- Give it here.

724
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,571
No, please.

725
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:52,948
- (Dagger slashes)
- (Screams)

726
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,250
Man: Spread out. Search every house.

727
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,586
Every room. Look in every room.

728
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,089
(Grunting)

729
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:12,927
(Women screaming)

730
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,352
(People shouting)

731
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,696
Gendry! His name is gendry.

732
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,532
Where is the bastard?

733
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:37,201
The night's watch! Please, stop!

734
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,702
Where?

735
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,705
They took him up the kingsroad,
heading north.

736
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:45,376
- How will we know him?
- He's got a bull's head helmet.

737
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,295
- He made it himself.
- Find him.
