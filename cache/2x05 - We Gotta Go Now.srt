1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,960
They want us to believe
Vought superheroes are the answer.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,340
What else do they lie about?

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,630
- A-Train, you're out.
- Out of what?

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:09,550
The Seven.

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,220
I ended the relationship
when I met you.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,890
Stop fucking lying to me.

7
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,140
And you love her?

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,850
We shouldn't feel so calm or safe.
So, what are we gonna do?

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,230
Cross our fingers
that Homelander's gonna save us?

10
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,610
- I'm the face of The Seven.
- I'm just trying to help.

11
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,530
- Ain't you supposed to be a hero?
- I am a hero.

12
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,900
That's Liberty.

13
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,240
William Butcher?

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,780
I found Becca.

15
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,450
I'm gonna get you out of here.

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,910
- I'm not leaving.
- Becca, you and me, we could disappear.

17
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,080
- I have a son.
- He's a fucking Supe freak.

Here. I'm here.

22
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,590
Looks like you saved me, Red.

23
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,510
No, you saved us.

24
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,970
If you hadn't broken
into the DHS mainframe...

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,890
True, I am a hell of a hacker,
but I'm no hero.

26
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,980
You are a hero, in lots of ways.

27
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,270
What do you mean?

28
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,440
You're not afraid to live your life.

29
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,360
To be who you really are.

30
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
Me, I'm...

31
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,120
I'm afraid to show the world who I am.

32
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Yeah?

33
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,620
So who are you, Maeve?

34
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,830
I'm a lot like you.

35
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,340
I'm gay.

36
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,840
We have to keep moving.

37
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,510
Come on.

38
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,510
And cut!

39
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,810
Brilliant.

40
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,350
Yes, that was absolutely brilliant.

41
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,810
Gang, let's check that.

42
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,360
And, ladies and gents,
it is a wrap for today.

43
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,810
Good job, people.

44
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,190
That was so great.

45
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,740
Let's hit it hard in the am. Thank you.

46
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,200
That's a wrap, people.

47
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,620
Hey, Marty, play that back, please.

48
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,160
- You enjoying this?
- Yeah.

49
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,540
This new Joss rewrite really sings?

50
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,090
- When are you gonna stop torturing me?
- Don't know what you're talking about.

51
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,720
If I promise to never see her again,

52
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,050
will you stop?

53
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,350
But, Maeve, you're in love.

54
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,100
It's beautiful.

55
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,650
Elena's good for you.
I won't let you throw that away.

56
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,270
Not now, not ever.

57
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,980
I mean, that would be cruel.

58
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,530
- Come on.
- Can I have a word, sir?

59
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,200
Look at this.

60
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,910
Look at these strong female lesbians.

61
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,450
I'm inspired.

62
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,660
- You inspired?
- Yeah.

63
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,000
- Girls get it on.
- "Done." Girls get it done.

64
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,870
- They sure do, Ashley.
- In private. It's urgent.

65
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,930
Ooh.

66
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,890
Terrific.

67
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:17,380
Pfft. They're all starving,
but one of them's got a cell phone?

68
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,130
I Wish you had cleared this with me
before you went over there.

69
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,340
Jesus Christ.
I don't have to clear shit with you.

70
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,390
I saw a chance for an easy win,
and I took it.

71
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,430
- How many views?
- They posted last night.

72
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,060
We scrubbed it 17 minutes later,
but that's forever.

73
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,940
And there's been some blowback.

74
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,020
Blowback?

75
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,320
All right. Fine, fine, fine.

76
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,530
So, what, I'm down a point?

77
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,200
A point and a half? Two?

78
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,620
- No, nine and a half.
- Nine and a half?

79
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,740
Nine?

80
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,200
Nine and a half?

81
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,170
Homelander kills! Homelander kills!

82
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,420
What, they're fucking protesting... me?

83
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,390
- My God. They're protesting me.
- They've been at the Tower all afternoon.

84
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,760
Why didn't you fucking say something?

85
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,350
Goddamn it.

86
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,650
Don't these ingrates realise
I killed that asshole for them?

87
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,110
What do they think "Saving America" means?

88
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,690
PR is drafting a response as we speak.

89
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,280
- Acknowledgement, apology, action.
- No, no, no. Apology? No.

90
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,030
You schedule a press conference,
and I'll clean it up myself.

91
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,370
Well, Mr. Edgar...

92
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,670
and Legal would like
your official position

93
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,960
to be "no comment" at this time.

94
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,460
Please, no press,

95
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,670
until the Crisis Team
has an actionable strategy, okay?

96
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,340
Bad day?

97
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,350
Hey, I'm with you.
Fuck these maxi pad-wearing ingrate hicks.

98
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,890
But there's a way to handle it.

99
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,150
I do not need your fucking help.

100
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,440
Sure, you seem
to be doing so well on your own.

101
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,950
Well, I'm here when you want me.

Hello, hello. Hughie?

Hey, hey. Hi, Hi.

105
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,120
Sorry, thought I was
getting your voicemail.

106
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,950
- That why you called five times?
- No, I thought you should know.

107
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,660
Liberty, that Supe
that Raynor was looking into?

108
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,920
Turns out it's Stormfront.
Vought changed her name.

109
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,380
They're moving her around
like a Catholic priest.

110
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,380
...Right.

111
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,970
She probably murdered Raynor.
Annie's trying to figure out why.

112
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,050
But, you know, who the fuck knows?

113
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,020
Well, as long as Starlight's on the job,
we're sorted then, yeah?

114
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,640
I'm not...

115
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,440
I'm not mad, you know.

116
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,100
What do you mean?

117
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,730
I just want you to know that, um...

118
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,070
Yes, you are leaving us
holding the bag on this shitshow.

119
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,320
But I want you to know that I get it.
It's, Becca.

120
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,320
I'd do the same thing. I'm not mad.

121
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,580
Well,

122
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,580
wouldn't matter if you were.

123
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,710
How is she?

124
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,460
Lovelier than the day I met her.

125
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,050
Where are you?

126
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,470
Heading off-grid.

127
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,220
Argentina, maybe. Early retirement.

128
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,800
Butcher?

129
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:19,890
Yeah, what?

130
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,680
Could've said goodbye.

131
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,770
I know we been through some shit together.

132
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,030
You were...

133
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,160
You were always like my canary, I suppose.

134
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,660
Thank you.

135
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,080
- Goodbye, Hughie.
- Your canary...?

136
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,660
Hello?

137
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,680
On your feet, soldier.

138
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,850
Take me home to Lallybroch.

139
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,270
What are you watching?

140
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,900
A show called Eat My Dick.

141
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,980
Okay.

142
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,690
Have you seen Frenchie or Kimiko?

143
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,320
No, no. Not for a while. Why?

144
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,410
Fuck.

145
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,580
I just got off the phone with Butcher.
I think something might be wrong.

146
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,830
Like, really, really wrong.

147
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,000
What makes you think that?

148
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,040
He was nice.

149
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,840
And...

150
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,630
called me his canary.

151
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,720
Tell me everything he said.

152
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,780
Agent Pearson, sir.

153
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,870
You're a sight for sore eyes.
Agent Cruz, I thought we lost you.

154
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,750
Got by with a little help from a friend.

155
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,290
So? Good news or bad?

156
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,760
I'd say that's good news.

157
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,300
- And now the CG mutants approach.
- And there's the bad news.

158
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,640
There's no way we can restore the grid

159
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,180
if we don't get
that flash drive to the Tower.

160
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,100
- How will you get through all of them?
- Don't worry.

161
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,190
Girls get it done.

162
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:38,190
And out on rehearsal.
No one move. No one move.

163
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,360
Starlight, I'm not touching,
but can you take a step?

164
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,030
Keep going, closer. Can you mark her?

165
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,070
Closer to Stormfront. Mark her, please.

166
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,700
And let's just pretend
like you like her, okay?

167
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,330
Okay, if I have to.

168
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,500
Okay. Okay, good stuff.
Let's try one for that. Good.

169
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,960
We should've shot that.

170
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,880
Clearly you like me.

171
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,220
You've been eye-fucking me
like a lovesick stangirl all day.

172
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,300
Why is that?

173
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,470
I don't know.
I think that you're a good actor.

174
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,060
I just feel
like a frigging fembot up there.

175
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
You know...

176
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,520
Everybody, can we stand by to roll?

177
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,110
Let's try to make our day. How about that?

178
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,190
Thank you.

179
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,570
Extra. Extra.

180
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,360
And turning now to superhero news:

181
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,450
Former Seven member The Deep
surprised everybody last week

182
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,870
when he married Cassandra Schwartz,

183
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:30,370
an anthropology professor at Vassar,
in an intimate ceremony.

184
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,290
The couple asked...

185
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,120
Banana saltwater taffy.

186
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,130
- God bless. Ron can't live without it.
- Ha.

187
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,550
- Billy?
- Hello, Judy.

188
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,470
Who's this?

189
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,090
It's my nephew.

190
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,350
For Christ's sake, Billy,
you gotta ring your mum.

191
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,940
Where's my boy?

192
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,110
Your mum and dad are flying over.

193
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,440
Your mum's worried to death about you.

194
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,900
No. You tell them, no.

195
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,700
It'd be a waste
of a perfectly good plane ticket.

196
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,740
Your father's quite ill.
Cancer's spreading fast.

197
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,750
Yeah, well, not fast enough.
I ain't seeing him.

198
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,960
Now where's me boy?

199
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,510
Oi, Terror.

200
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,340
You little rascal?

201
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,260
Look at you, little fucker.
You ain't changed a day.

202
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,520
How's about you and me
go for a little stroll?

203
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
Yeah?

204
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,680
Come on.

205
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,040
So this is what it all comes to?

206
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,670
Metamucil and wringing our dicks out
for a few drops of piss.

207
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,050
I used to think that you, me,
and Becca would grow old together.

208
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,350
Bloody stupid.

209
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,930
Turns out she...

210
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,610
What the fuck was any of it for?

211
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,700
Yes, there he is.

212
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,740
There's my guy,
looking spectacular, as always.

213
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:35,830
- How we doing?
- Good.

214
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,870
- Feelgood?
- Yeah.

215
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,460
You ready
for this big fucking scene today?

216
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,340
That's basically
what I wanted to talk to you about.

217
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,050
- Great.
- I did a bit of a rewrite.

218
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,670
I want you to take a look.

219
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,470
Wow.

220
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,680
What a lot of work.

221
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,430
Yeah, I just felt
like the dialogue was a little off.

222
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,650
You know, A—Train would
never say any of this shit.

223
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:01,560
Right.

224
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,900
And you definitely just don't need
that giant expo dump at the end.

225
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,780
Your big farewell speech?

226
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,280
Honestly, I think it's better
if we just leave it open-ended.

227
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,450
- Okay.
- Know what I mean?

228
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,330
We can just play it in looks
and just not a whole bunch of words.

229
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,830
- Right.
- Maybe make it more of a question.

230
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,290
- Is A-Train really leaving The Seven?
- Yeah.

231
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,340
- We don't know. We don't know.
- We don't know.

232
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,170
Yeah.

233
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,850
I think we'll go ahead
and do the scene as scripted.

234
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,680
Thank you for putting thought into it.
You got a lot of heart.

235
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,770
Take that heart, put it in the scene.

236
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,180
All right, good stuff.

237
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,480
I'm not doing it.

238
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,360
I'm not doing this shitty scene.

239
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,610
Well...

240
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,120
that is way above my pay grade.

241
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,080
Bring that up with Ashley.

242
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,120
Right? Right.

243
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,080
By the way,
I got the crew a Vietnamese crepe truck.

244
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:09,460
They make a gluten-free bánh xèo.
It is fantastic. You're gonna be great.

245
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,300
- Where are we going?
- They need to see you in Wardrobe.

246
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,640
Deep, you look so happy.
I hardly recognise you.

247
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,270
Katie, I'm in love. You know?

248
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:23,390
To an extraordinary woman
I'm now blessed to call my wife.

249
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,100
That's really nice.

250
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:29,480
Well, let's address
the elephant in the room, shall we?

251
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,990
You know, I'm glad you asked,
because, yeah, you know,

252
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,780
Kevin here has
had some issues in the past.

253
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,660
But people grow.

254
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,000
If you could see
the letters that he writes me,

255
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,790
you would know
what a beautiful soul he has.

256
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,170
Thank you. She's only saying that
because I make her breakfast in bed.

257
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,670
- Stop.
- French toast.

258
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,930
So you are both members
of the Church of the Collective.

259
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,260
It's not realistic.

260
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,970
Alexander Hamilton
wasn't no Puerto Rican.

261
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,810
That's the point.

262
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,810
It's a metaphor for the immigrant
experience in America.

263
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,650
But he was a white guy.

264
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:13,530
You know what's really good?

265
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,370
Can we help you?

266
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,330
She's just a girl.

267
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,630
Show her a picture of kittens
or some shit.

268
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,050
How about I show her
my motherfucking dick?

269
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,640
Bitch ain't right in the head.

270
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,020
Fuck!

271
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,230
Holy Shit!

272
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,030
Stop, please.

273
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Oi, Billy, you should've told me
you were bringing company.

274
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:42,240
Oi, who's this one remind you of?
Isn't he the spitting of Lenny?

275
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,330
No.

276
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,420
Thought you were retiring.

277
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,670
Argentina, right?

278
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,250
I am.

279
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,720
What are you doing here?

280
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,680
Well, Hughie heard a dog toy on the phone.

281
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,310
I know you keep Terror
at your aunt's, so...

282
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:05,770
Brilliant as ever.

283
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,310
Time to go.

284
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,810
- Come help us with Stormfront.
- Came all this way for that?

285
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,730
No, we came because we're worried.

286
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,520
Your cunt sense tingling, is it?

287
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,940
Well, don't you worry. I'm sorted.

288
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,660
Where's Becca, man?

289
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,160
Becca?

290
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,660
What's he talking about?

291
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,120
Waiting for me at the Hampton Inn, so...

292
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:31,250
Lots of thanks. Time to piss off.

293
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,420
We're not going anywhere.

294
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,460
Right.

295
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,470
Just so you know,
that's Terror's girlfriend.

296
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:44,970
What?

297
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,140
His fuck pig.

298
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,340
Black Noir is here.

299
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,590
What?

300
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,300
It wasn't us. We were cautious.

301
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,930
We swapped cars, no toll roads...

302
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,350
It's not you.

303
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,890
It's me.
He must've tracked me from Becca's.

304
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,270
Billy, What's this all about?

305
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,350
It's complicated.

306
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,560
Becca's not with me.

307
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,480
You couldn't get her out?

308
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,950
She didn't want out.

309
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,790
I'll explain everything.

310
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,250
But right now we're in a bit of trouble.

311
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,500
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come.

312
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,670
Okay, maybe...

313
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,130
Maybe we can make a run for it,
just get to the car.

314
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,420
Nah, he moves faster than a car.

315
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,220
But if he wants to kill us,

316
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,930
he'll have to do it with an audience.

317
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,060
This is the fire department.

318
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:22,780
A natural gas leak has been reported.
Everyone, out of your homes.

319
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,740
I repeat, a gas leak has been reported.

320
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,450
- Nice one, M.M.
- Out of your homes, please.

321
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,490
Let's hope they stay a while.

322
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,580
Ma'am, do you have any nails,
ball bearings, electrical wiring?

323
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,040
Pressurized aerosol products?
I need a can about this big.

324
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,380
Really appreciate it.

325
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,380
Team Britney, 2007.

326
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,590
- Remember the meltdown?
- Yeah, that...

327
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,260
But, you know...

328
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,350
You're a firecracker.

329
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,560
Mom?

330
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:54,980
Annie.

331
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,850
You look so pretty.

332
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,110
What... What are you doing here?

333
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,190
I'm in town.
I've been texting you for days.

334
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,450
I wasn't trying to ambush you, I promise.

335
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,530
Did you get any of the Vietnamese crepes?
Because they're dope.

336
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,540
No, no, no. I'm good, thanks.

337
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,290
Your mom was telling me about

338
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,210
the hero pageants you used to do.

339
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,630
Lucky.

340
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,840
My mom would never let me.

341
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,050
Adele did not go in
for that sort of thing.

342
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,510
I had to do all my speeches
to a brush in the mirror.

343
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,470
I like this one.

344
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,930
Mom, this isn't a great time.

345
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,140
I know you're busy,

346
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,900
but you don't have to entertain me,
I promise.

347
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,940
I wanted to see you, sweetheart. I...

348
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,070
I miss you.

349
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,540
I think that this is something
that we need to discuss in private.

350
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,040
- Donna, can I tell her?
- Tell me what?

351
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,380
Look, your mom is so sorry
about the Compound V.

352
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,790
And she understands

353
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,420
that keeping that a secret
really hurt your relationship.

354
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,890
And I used you as a trophy
to make myself feel important.

355
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,260
I know that now.

356
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,390
Why are you talking to a stranger
about our relationship?

357
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,640
She's not a stranger. She's your teammate.

358
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,150
Annie, look, the whole world
knows about Compound V.

359
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:28,780
I mean, lots of parents did what I did.

360
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,030
I...

361
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,490
I'm hoping that you'll...

362
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,330
That you'll forgive me.

363
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,540
Please, forgive me.

364
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:41,670
This is not the time
or the place for this.

365
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,340
Look, everyone is upset about Compound V.

366
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,840
I mean, someone was so upset,
they leaked it to the press.

367
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,880
Can you imagine how angry
that person is, whoever they are?

368
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,810
I'll let you two hash it out,

369
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:02,480
but I just think, if it was me,
I'd be grateful to have a mom like Donna.

370
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,990
Honey, please.

371
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,700
I need to get back to set.

372
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:21,210
Do you need someone
to drive you back to your hotel?

373
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,210
No, I'll get a cab.

374
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,960
Okay, now, Queen Maeve. A goddess.

375
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,720
But our Empress of the Otherworld
struggles inside.

376
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,470
Questions of identity
rock her to her core.

377
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,350
- Until she meets...
- Elena.

378
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,220
The connection is immediate,
all-consuming.

379
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,640
A sweet Sapphic love blossoms,

380
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,230
raising Maeve's consciousness
and revealing her own inner truth.

381
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,650
She's gay, and it's okay.

382
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,730
- It's...
- Powerful.

383
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,190
She's more than just a superhero now.

384
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,780
She is a symbol.

385
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,240
Representation matters.

386
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,870
She's hashtag "Brave Maeve."

387
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,410
We're recommending
a multipronged image makeover.

388
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,660
- First guest spots on Queer Eye.
- Then an exclusive It Gets Better PSA.

389
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,000
Kimberly Peirce might direct.

390
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,130
Grand Marshalls at New York
and Chicago Pride,

391
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:10,000
because you are two proud lesbians.

392
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,300
You know Maeve is bi, right?

393
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,090
I just feel like
lesbian is an easier sell.

394
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,590
A bit more cut-and-dry.

395
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,760
Now, for Elena...

396
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,300
- Me?
- You're gonna love it.

397
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,680
Why am I a part of this shit?

398
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,350
We are going with a polished,
tailored look.

399
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,770
That looks like menswear.

400
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,400
Pew Research shows that
two feminine women in a relationship

401
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,820
sends a problematic message.

402
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,530
This isn't Penthouse Forum.

403
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,820
Americans are more
accepting of gays

404
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,360
when they're in a clear-cut
gender role relationship,

405
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,780
like Ellen and Portia.

406
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,950
Okay, let's get one thing straight.

407
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:43,870
I have no interest
in being in a public relationship.

408
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,370
You will be compensated.

409
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,960
I am not for sale.

410
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,340
Really? You're not gonna say anything?

411
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,770
I'll fix this.

412
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:06,850
Yeah.

413
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
Elena.

414
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,270
Elena, wait.

415
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,730
If they want a lesbian Ken doll,

416
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,610
they can find someone else.

417
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,990
I'm gonna cash in my vacation days
and go stay with my sister.

418
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,160
- No, you can't do that.
- Why? I'm not under contract.

419
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,870
This is Homelander, okay?

420
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,710
And he's fucking with me.
If you go out there...

421
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:35,210
Elena, there is nowhere you can go
that he won't find you.

422
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,670
Please, stay.

423
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:41,430
I can't protect you if you leave.

424
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,850
But what are we gonna do?

425
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,810
We're gonna take that motherfucker down.

426
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,360
- You trust me?
- Yeah.

427
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:03,530
Okay.

428
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,450
Is this right?

429
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,620
Just like Home Alone,
except way less delightful.

430
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,130
Butcher?

431
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,210
No.

432
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,380
It ain't right.

433
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,140
What's going on?

434
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,600
That ninja cunt's here for me, isn't he?

435
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,560
But you can't go out there.
He'll kill you.

436
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,070
So...

437
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,280
So that's it?

438
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,400
Expecting a happy ending, were we?

439
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,870
Well, I'm sorry, Hughie.

440
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,870
It ain't that kind of massage parlor.

441
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,960
Now, I can keep him busy
for a little while, yeah?

442
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,880
Give you Iota chance to leg it.

443
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,920
I'm knackered.

444
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,670
I could use a little lie down.

445
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,550
Fuck you.

446
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,270
Am I supposed to be impressed
by this blaze-of—glory jerk-off?

447
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:10,810
Guess not.

448
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,020
You don't think I thought
about cashing it in after Robin?

449
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,610
Because I do.

450
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,940
Still.

451
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,740
A lot.

452
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,450
But I don't.

453
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,880
And the thing that kills me
is that your wife is alive.

454
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,670
She just doesn't want you, that's all.

455
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,300
Say that again.

456
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,390
So you don't have shit.
Welcome to the fucking club.

457
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,680
I mean, come on,
what do any of us have besides...?

458
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:58,360
Who the fuck asked you to come here?

459
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,240
I don't need your help.

460
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,530
Jesus, you're fucking pathetic.

461
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,990
You're so scared of being alone, Hughie.

462
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,370
First you latch on to Robin,
then Starlight, and now me.

463
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,750
Well, you know what, son?
I ain't interested.

464
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,260
Look, just get out of the fucking way.

465
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,770
Don't make me move you.

466
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,350
You can move him.

467
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,060
Good luck with me.

468
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,610
She wanted the job.

469
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,110
You have her doing hits?

470
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,860
The Albanians have her doing hits.

471
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,070
I'm just a girl getting 10 percent.

472
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,910
I'm sorry, pumpkin.

473
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,660
But I told you,

474
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,160
she's no kitten.

475
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,130
She can make her own choices.

476
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,590
Why?

477
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,970
How is this stopping Stormfront?

478
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,350
I know you blame yourself
for your brother.

479
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,850
I know the rage you feel.

480
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:59,190
But this, this is not the way.

481
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,020
This is poison for your soul. I know.

482
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,950
Come with me, mon coeur.

483
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,250
I got my own baby brother killed!

484
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:22,000
He was the only thing
that mattered to me!

485
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,300
Stop trying to help me!

486
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,630
I don't want your help!

487
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:31,640
I don't understand what you're saying,
because you won't teach me.

488
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,180
Fuck this.

489
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,020
Fuck you.

490
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:46,980
Go be a monster.

491
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:02,250
Remember when you were young
and the world was full of possibilities?

492
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:06,210
Before at! the mistakes,
heartbreaks, and disappointments?

493
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,300
What if you could go back
to the way things were?

494
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:14,140
I used to be angry, insecure, and unsure.

495
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,890
But thanks
to the Church of the Collective,

496
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,350
I now know the kind of man I want to be.

497
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,690
The kind of man
who calls out injustice when he sees it.

498
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:23,900
- Stop.
- Come on.

499
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,980
Hey, dude.

500
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,520
That's not cool.

501
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,240
The kind of man
who stands up for what's right.

502
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,360
Come on, guys. Knock it off.

503
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,870
The kind of man
who sees the potential in all of us.

504
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,950
So join us
at the Church of the Collective.

505
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,870
And be the person
you were always meant to be.

506
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,550
That's a bunch of bullshit.

507
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:58,010
Didn't used to be.
Church used to mean something.

508
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,100
Are you a member?

509
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,060
I was, long time ago.

510
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,850
That place used to be pure.

511
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:10,110
And then they just started
letting all kinds of people in, you know?

512
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
I don't know.

513
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,660
So why don't you tell me?

514
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,370
Well, I think you do know.

515
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,450
Some people are quality,
and others are...

516
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,290
garbage.

517
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,090
By the way,

518
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,210
I heard they're retiring you.

519
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,630
So unfair.

520
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,510
You have a problem?

521
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,600
Of course not. Why would you say that?

522
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,150
Can I have a word, please?

523
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,650
Adam tells me
you don't want to do the scene.

524
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,280
I can't be a part
of something I don't believe in.

525
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,700
I know it's not easy losing your job.

526
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,280
When I got fired,
I Tindered my way through Barcelona.

527
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:05,160
Everyone in that city ate my paella.
Fucked a guy with elephantiasis.

528
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,000
But I got through it, and so will you.

529
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,550
Yeah, but I'm still making it happen.
My A-Trainers sell how many pairs a year?

530
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,710
Look on the bright side.

531
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,840
You served four years longer
than Mr. Marathon.

532
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,340
-Now, that is something, okay?
—But...

533
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,130
Please.

534
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,010
Let me just talk to Homelander.

535
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,230
We both know that's not a good idea.

536
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,440
I'm sorry.

537
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,650
I'm not saying the lines.

538
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,730
Okay, this can go one of two ways.

539
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,740
One, you leave The Seven with your dignity
and your severance package intact.

540
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:40,070
Or two, you get fired
for breaching your morality clause

541
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,580
by shooting up Compound V

542
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:45,040
and giving yourself a heart attack
in the fucking process.

543
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,830
It's your choice.

544
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,180
You know, the truth is,
I've been running my whole life.

545
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,020
I think it's time
that I stay put for a while.

546
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,230
It's time I went home.

547
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,980
I know this is the Dawn of the Seven.

548
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,570
But it's sunset on A—Train.

549
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,820
- It's been a good run.
- Cut!

550
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,580
Hey, dude, that was awesome.

551
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,790
Awesome? A-dog, that was fucking gold.

552
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,590
Buddy, look, I'm ready to move on.

553
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,800
But how do you feel?
Want another one? Let me know.

554
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,760
No, go ahead and move on.

555
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,180
All right, check it. Moving on.

556
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,760
- Tiffany, we need you over at Mocap.
- I'm heading there now.

557
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,430
Yes, it's true,
Vought has all the money and the power.

558
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,400
- And we have, no of fence, jack shit.
- We love you, Victoria!

559
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,900
But after Homelander's war crime,

560
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:01,910
how can I stay quiet
and still look my daughter in the eyes?

561
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:04,490
I can't. I know you can't.

562
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:08,750
And guess what.
The House Judiciary can't, either.

563
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:14,460
Finally, we are going to hold hearings
on Vought and Compound V.

564
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,500
Yes. Yeah.

565
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,630
Hey, everyone.

566
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,350
May I?

567
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,060
Thank you.

568
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,520
Congresswoman Neuman, everybody.

569
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,770
Isn't she great?

570
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:40,570
Did you love that "Walk Like an Egyptian"
dance she did online?

571
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,400
So fun.

572
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,950
I loved it.

573
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,510
But fun isn't What
we 're here for, is it?

574
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,370
No, no, no...

575
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:50,330
Let me just start by saying
how pleased I am to see you all here.

576
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:53,250
Everyone get the fuck out.
Get the fuck out.

577
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,580
Fuck you. Get out.

578
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,580
...all your voices to be heard.

579
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:59,210
I know that some of you are a little upset

580
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,380
by that video online
of me stopping the terrorist.

581
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,760
And I just want you to know
that I understand.

582
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,220
I'm upset too.

583
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,680
I mean, come on, guys.

584
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:15,020
Nobody wants innocent people to get hurt.
Of course not.

585
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,190
But sadly,

586
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,990
well, the bad guys,

587
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,240
they don't think like us.

588
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:28,530
And so,

589
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,450
sometimes,
well, these things just happen.

590
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,370
This happened before?

591
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,920
- How many times?
- Well, no. Hold on, guys.

592
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,800
My point is,
we all have the same goals, don't we?

593
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,340
- To keep our country safe.
- No.

594
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,180
So American lives
are the only ones worth protecting?

595
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,600
Of course not.

596
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,350
But if you've served
with our amazing soldiers like I have,

597
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:57,270
you would know
that freedom comes at a price.

598
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,940
You don't speak for us.

599
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,690
- Yeah, you don't speak for us.
- You don't speak for us.

600
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,860
You don't speak for us.

601
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,410
All right.
Everyone, just calm down. Calm down.

602
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:10,830
Let's not let your hearts
get in the way of your heads.

603
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:13,870
- You don't speak for us.
- Everyone just relax.

604
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:16,040
- You don't speak for us.
- Calm down.

605
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,500
You don't speak for us.

606
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,750
You don't speak for us.
You don't speak for us.

607
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,840
- You don't speak for us.
- Fuck Homelander.

608
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,300
You don't speak for us.

609
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:47,070
You don't speak for us.
You don't speak for us.

610
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,660
You don't speak for us...

611
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,870
All right. You guys are the real heroes.

612
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,540
God bless you.

613
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,330
Love you, guys.

614
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:58,620
You don't speak for us.
You don't speak for us.

615
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,010
- You guys are all good.
- Thank you.

616
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,030
It's time.

617
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,070
Right, lads. To the taffy room.

618
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,750
This is bullocks.

619
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,350
This is the taffy room?

620
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,520
Affordable alternative
to privatized health care.

621
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,520
She's a dealer.

622
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:16,450
All right.
Everybody, just calm down. Calm down.

623
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,200
Let's not let your hearts...

624
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,080
You guys, you're the real heroes.

625
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,630
You fuck.

626
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,260
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

627
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,690
No one ever said the job was easy.

628
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:53,150
Look, he's just a kid, 17 years old.
You don't gotta look at him in the face.

629
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,570
Look, no one's ever
achieved anything without sacrifice.

630
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,620
The kid's a hero. Think of it like that.

631
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,160
Right, a hero.

632
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,180
Come in.

633
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:33,320
Where do you get all these?

634
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,240
This is just the first batch.
I'll have Logan punch up the fear.

635
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,780
- Logan?
- My meme queen.

636
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,950
So...

637
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,790
When you see it
on your uncle's Facebook page,

638
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,500
then you know it's working.

639
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,210
Um...

640
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,330
Can I ask you something?

641
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,960
I suppose I got the time.

642
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,760
Who's Lenny?

643
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,380
You said I look like him.

644
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,300
Billy wouldn't want me to say.

645
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,680
Fuck Billy.

646
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:46,890
Lenny's his little brother.

647
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,070
Butcher has a brother?

648
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:53,610
Yeah.

649
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,530
Skinny, nervous little bugger.

650
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,610
Like you.

651
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:02,410
Fourth grade.

652
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:07,790
Little wanker named Dorian Savory
breaks Lenny's nose.

653
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:09,830
Well, Billy goes to work on him.

654
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,170
Was bringing the seesaw down
on Dorian's noggin, Wham, Wham.

655
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,630
Probably gonna top him.

656
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:19,760
Kids, teachers, trying to drag Billy away,
but no, no good.

657
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,970
Not gonna happen. Dorian's a goner.

658
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,600
Then Lenny steps in,

659
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:28,230
face all bleeding,

660
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:29,980
and leads Billy away,

661
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,810
easy, quiet as a lamb.

662
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,270
That was Lenny.

663
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,240
He had a way of making Billy not be...

664
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:43,530
well, you know, Billy.

665
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,420
I think Billy needs someone like that,
you know?

666
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,390
Where's Lenny now?

667
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:06,100
God rest his soul.

668
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,560
What happened?

669
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,150
Whoa, Shh, Shh.

670
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:04,110
Easy, Terror. Easy, easy.

671
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:15,580
Come here. Come on, everybody, out.

672
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,300
Out the side door.

673
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,430
Move.

674
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:33,890
- Butcher?
- Get them out of here.

675
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,400
Butcher, wait, wait, wait.
What are you...?

676
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:40,110
Butcher? Butcher?

677
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,400
Butcher, what are you doing?

678
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,200
Butcher, you don't...

679
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:46,660
Don't do this.

680
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:47,740
Butcher.

681
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:50,990
All right, you fucker.

682
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:53,870
Where are you?

683
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:10,220
So you want to take me on, do you?

684
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:13,140
Think you got the bollocks?

685
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,560
Well, come on, then, cunt.

686
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,860
What the fuck are you doing? Get out.

687
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,120
Oi, gimp cunt.

688
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,370
Over here, gimp cunt.
I'm the one you want. Come here.

689
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,540
You kill him,

690
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:18,080
and you can kiss
your fucking career goodbye.

691
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,130
I got photos
of Vought's dirty little secret,

692
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,340
my wife's son,

693
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,140
Homelander's son.

694
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:37,810
Now, you lay
one fucking finger on any of us,

695
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,270
and those photos go out of the cloud,

696
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:43,610
and into Ronan Farrow's inbox.

697
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,940
And then the whole world will know

698
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:51,320
that Homelander is nothing
but a filthy fucking rapist,

699
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:56,450
and Vought has been hiding
his little laser-eyed bastard.

700
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:01,170
Now, you cunts went to a lot of trouble
to keep that a secret.

701
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:04,380
I reckon you might
want to keep it that way.

702
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,110
Mr. Butcher.

703
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:29,150
Hello, cunt.

704
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,570
How can I be sure you actually
have the proof of which you speak?

705
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:33,860
You can't.

706
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:35,570
Roll the dice, cunt.

707
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:40,450
I reckon he'd be more popular
than Meghan and Harry's little sprog.

708
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:43,000
Here's my first and final offer.

709
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,750
That information
never sees the light of day,

710
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,920
and I'll call off Black Noir.

711
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,840
All right.

712
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,340
You got yourself a deal.

713
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,510
Want to shake on it?

714
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,300
Put Noir on.

715
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:58,930
Oi, missus wants a word.

716
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,150
Jesus Christ, Billy.

717
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:13,820
M.M., you all right?

718
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:14,910
I'm okay.

719
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,950
Do you really
have those pictures?

720
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:22,700
Of course I do.

721
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,300
They said there'd be food.

722
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:40,390
Well, this is food for your soul.

723
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,560
Go with love.

724
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:46,020
Hi.

725
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,020
Maeve. My God. Hi.

726
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,440
What brought you here?

727
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:50,980
Wait, are you...?

728
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:54,400
- You want to check this out?
- Fuck, no.

729
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:56,410
Listen, we should talk.

730
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:57,490
Yeah.

731
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:01,700
If any of these Moonies
are gonna help you get back in The Seven,

732
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,250
and that's a big "if"...

733
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:07,540
then you're gonna need a woman
to tell everyone

734
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,090
that you're not a complete piece of shit.

735
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,510
I can be that person for you.

736
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:16,180
- You think I'm a piece of shit?
- Fuck, yeah.

737
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,550
The point is, I can help you.

738
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,800
If you help me.

739
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,350
Yeah, I've got Stormfront. Flying in.

740
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,030
Why are you in my trailer?

741
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:26,160
You know, you had no right
to talk to my mother about personal shit.

742
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:28,500
What were you trying to prove?

743
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,790
Okay, sorry. Just trying to help.

744
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:35,500
She didn't just lie to me
about Compound V, okay?

745
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:38,840
She lied to me about everything.

746
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,850
So don't try and broker
some kind of peace between us,

747
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:45,220
because I don't want it.

748
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:48,430
Wow, that...

749
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:57,150
I mean, that is a performance.

750
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,150
My God.

751
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,900
Look, I'm, like, tearing up.

752
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,910
You don't suck, Starlight.

753
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:06,740
You are Tilda fucking Swinton.

754
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:10,500
I know you leaked it.

755
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:13,290
I have no idea what you're talking about.

756
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,500
Not as good. Magic's gone.
Lightning really doesn't strike twice.

757
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:20,590
Whatever. You know what?
I need to get to set, so...

758
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:22,760
That hack-a-limb, Gecko.

759
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,760
Yeah, he stole the V, and then you,

760
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:28,720
you leaked it to MSNBC.

761
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:31,140
What do you think
Vought's gonna feel when I tell them?

762
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:37,480
Well, how do you think the world will feel

763
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:40,650
when I tell them
that you used to be Liberty?

764
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:47,330
Wow, you are a special
kind of poison flower?

765
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:49,080
Going against your own people?

766
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,330
You mean fucking white people?

767
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:53,580
Starlight.

768
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,130
Superheroes.

769
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:56,670
Don't be racist.

770
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,420
My.

771
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,760
Yes.

772
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,800
That is adorable.

773
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,260
I do like you. You got spunk.

774
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:11,730
- You're gonna be a big help to me.
- What the hell does that mean?

775
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:14,850
Come in.

776
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:23,320
Hello, you two.

777
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,580
Not interrupting, am I?

778
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:33,210
No, just between us girls,
right, Starlight?

779
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:35,330
Yeah.

780
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,250
Yeah, that's right.

781
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,340
See you around.

782
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:47,760
- Can't wait to shoot our scene together.
- Yeah, me too.

783
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,060
What was that all about?

784
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,400
You girls friendly?

785
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:01,150
No, just running lines. What's up?

786
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:04,950
Me.

787
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:06,860
Five points.

788
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:17,540
Yeah, people are, checking boxes
like "patriotic" and "unwavering."

789
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,260
I owe you.

790
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,510
Well, what are you
ever gonna do to repay me?

791
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:40,230
Well, here we are.

792
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,400
I'm sorry.

793
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:48,070
I almost threw in the towel,
like a bleeding twat.

794
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:51,620
We're harder than that, ain't we?

795
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,700
I will get your mom back.

796
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,340
I swear to God, I'll get your mom back.

797
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:03,210
Just take a little bit longer.

798
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,550
You hang in there, all right?

799
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:09,760
You be a good boy for Judy.

800
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:14,260
Yeah. Who's a good lad?

801
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:24,020
I almost forgot.

802
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,690
I got you something.

803
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:30,160
Terror,

804
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:32,530
Fuck it.

805
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:34,450
That's my boy.

806
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,210
- You're all right, for an old bat.
- Yeah, yeah.

807
