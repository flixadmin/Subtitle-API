1
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,647
You there!
Laundry's that way!

2
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:18,117
Hyah!

3
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:19,651
Uhh!

4
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:23,956
Uhh!

5
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,603
Uhh!

6
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:39,972
Fine work, team.

7
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:15,641
No one can stop
the Chang gang...

8
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:19,044
Not even the j-team!

9
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,733
The coast is clear.

10
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:17,269
Move quickly, tohru.

11
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:21,440
Jade must not find out
captain black is
assembling the j-team

12
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:24,643
or she will hatch
another kooky--
Jade: Jackie!

13
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:25,911
I've hatched
a mondo plan

14
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:27,646
to take down
the j-team's
arch-Nemesis

15
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:28,947
Bartholomew Chang.

16
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,483
Tell you all
about it on the way
to section 13--awp!

17
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:36,155
The only plan, Jade,
is for you to stay
here with uncle.

18
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,193
Grrr! Jackie never listens!

19
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:43,195
Doesn't he realize
I'm not only a member

20
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:45,097
but the brains
behind the j-team?

21
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:48,967
Who is up for mah jong
and mung beans?
(Tiles clacking)

22
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:51,503
Maybe I can spell it
out for Jackie...

23
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,506
With a little help
from uncle's magic.

24
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:58,744
While in prison,
Chang managed to
recruit an elite team,

25
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:01,180
each possessing skills
matching your own--

26
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:03,849
an anti j-team,
if you will.

27
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,418
Knock-offs are never
as good as the originals.

28
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,220
don't be so sure, viper.

29
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:11,056
Meet master thief
Philip crain.

30
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,926
He's pulled
heists on several
international museums--

31
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:17,829
the louvre, guggenheim,
uffizi, Tate.

32
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,232
I hit each of those
back when I was a thief.

33
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:21,800
Not on
the same day.

34
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,101
Oh!

35
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:26,538
El toro, meet your
criminal counterpart--

36
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,674
Bob "the bopper" hathcock,

37
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:31,143
pro-wrestling champ
gone renegade.

38
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:35,547
His trademark move--
bopper's bash.

39
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,950
(Stupefied)
Bopper's bash.

40
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:43,155
(Covering) I mean,
everyone knows American
wrestling is fake.

41
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:45,691
Black: Tohru, say hello
to Helga sorensen.

42
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:48,160
She held the world's
strongest woman title

43
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:51,096
before throwing it away
for a career of crime.

44
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:53,398
How strong
could a woman be?

45
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,168
Here's Helga lifting
the world's strongest man.

46
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,004
Uhh!

47
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:01,240
(Gulps)

48
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:04,443
And my dance
partner would be?

49
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:09,248
"Little" Tony chun.
don't be fooled
by the glasses.

50
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,585
He's the most feared
martial artist on
China's most-wanted list.

51
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:18,457
Heh heh! Guess he's not
as cuddly as he looks.

52
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:26,865
Hmm...Lookee here.
A seniority spell.

53
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:30,402
"Gives it conjurer
- authority over any subject."

54
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:33,305
That means the j-team
will finally listen to me!

55
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:35,073
I'll be their leader!

56
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,345
(Chanting)

57
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:47,619
So, unc, what would you
say if I commanded you

58
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,489
to let me go
to section 13 with Jackie?

59
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:53,659
Uncle would say,
go right ahead...

60
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:56,828
Seniority rules.

61
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:02,334
If you want to make uncle
angrier than rabid goat!

62
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,303
Jade?

63
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,174
(Gasps)

64
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:10,342
Paco.

65
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:11,710
Oh, no, no, no, Jade.

66
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,912
The meeting is for
the j-team only.

67
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:16,982
Then, good thing
I brought my
membership card.

68
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,351
Chang has one weakness--

69
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:22,888
he will no doubt
attempt to reacquire
his fortune in Jade.

70
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,156
(Telephone rings)

71
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,657
Black here.

72
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,960
Bingo. Museum of
natural history.

73
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,267
(Chanting)

74
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:38,603
Ok, j-team, follow me!

75
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:41,740
Jade, stay
with paco!

76
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:47,145
Grrr! Lousy spell!

77
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:59,091
Ha ha ha ha! Ah, green!

78
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:00,692
The color of Jade!

79
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:05,697
Really, Chang, you
should consider taking
up a legal pastime.

80
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,167
Collecting baseball cards?
Snow globes, maybe?

81
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,404
Warriors, attack!

82
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,574
Uhh!
Rarrr!

83
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:18,910
No. I will take
the bopper.

84
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,112
Uhh!
Uhh!

85
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,224
Grrr!

86
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:36,528
Pretty boy's mine.

87
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,931
Uh, I cannot fight a woman.

88
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:45,337
This woman will
make you scream
like little girl.

89
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,072
Uhh!
Uhh!

90
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,140
Uhh!

91
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,945
Ha ha ha!
Jolly good.

92
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,948
Where'd you pick up
<i>that</i> accent--spies "r" us?

93
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,385
The same place
I picked up
this little gem.

94
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:01,653
Uhh!

95
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,155
Uhh!

96
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:04,890
Uhh!

97
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,429
You are quick!

98
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:13,465
You mean,
for a chubby guy?

99
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,701
No, no, no!
Not what I meant!

100
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,842
(Chuckles) It would
seem the j-team

101
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:26,745
has finally
met its match.

102
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,018
Uhh--huhh!

103
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,720
I'll hang your mask
on my mantle!

104
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:39,524
El toro fuerte never
removes his mask!

105
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:40,692
Uhh!
Uhh!

106
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,170
Grrr!

107
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,472
Ooh! Aah!

108
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:54,873
Uhh!

109
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,007
Uhh! Uhh!

110
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,275
Uhh! Uhh!

111
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:00,512
I told you,
I do not fight women.

112
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:02,113
Heeyah!

113
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:06,818
Oof!

114
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,488
You're not the only one
with the toys, handsome.

115
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:16,962
Ooh!

116
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,897
Now, <i> he</i> is chubby.

117
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,066
Ehh!
Uhh!

118
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:22,300
(All groaning)

119
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,469
That smarts.

120
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:25,971
Grrr!

121
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:27,973
Chang!

122
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:30,909
Uhh!

123
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:32,077
Ohh!

124
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:35,046
You've been made by Jade--

125
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:37,349
er, brains behind
the j-team, not the stone.

126
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,783
Jackie: Jade.

127
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,554
What? You said,
stay with paco.

128
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:44,055
<i>Como estas?</i>

129
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,291
The results speak for
themselves, Jackie!

130
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:50,362
Spell or no spell,
the j-team needs to
start including me!

131
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,264
Uh...Spell?

132
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:54,299
Uh, what spell?

133
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:56,401
What's it matter?
Didn't work.

134
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:58,703
(Gasps) Jade!

135
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,305
Huh?!
Huh?!

136
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:02,574
Or maybe it just took
time to kick in,

137
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:06,411
because I forgot
the garlic! Duh!

138
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,348
(All gasp)

139
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,118
This can't
be good.

140
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
Oh, bad day!

141
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:16,354
Oh, boy.

142
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:18,423
Mommy.

143
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,664
(J-tots gasp)

144
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,133
<i>El toro</i>
à <i> es El</i>
<i>nio?</i>

145
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,835
This is <i> so</i> not the type
of seniority spell
I had in mind.

146
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:34,506
Ha ha ha ha!
The mighty j-team,

147
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:37,576
victims of their own
foolish magic!

148
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:40,178
Now, if you brats
don't mind...

149
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,350
Go find a busy street
to play in

150
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:49,187
while the grown-ups
steal a fortune in Jade.

151
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,589
Jade!

152
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,658
I know!
I am so grounded.

153
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,561
No! Kids
against grown-ups!

154
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:57,662
Rrarr!

155
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:59,364
Waah!
Aah!

156
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,035
(Soft punching)

157
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,437
Hyah!

158
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,738
Uhh! Ehh!

159
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,374
(Grunting)

160
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,042
Hyah!

161
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,311
Jalisco hairpull!

162
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:14,546
(Efforts)

163
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:17,148
Uhh!
Uhh! Uhh!

164
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,516
Acapulco ankle-lock!

165
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:19,584
(Efforts)

166
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,487
(The bopper chuckles)

167
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,389
(El toro sputters)

168
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,024
(Grunts and groans)

169
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,894
Uh...Friends?

170
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:32,297
I will break you.

171
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,366
(Crying)

172
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,701
(Wails) Ohh!

173
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:41,106
Heee--heee--heee--

174
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,774
(singsong)
- "V" my name is viper,

175
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,609
my boyfriend's name is Van,

176
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:45,844
he lives in Venezuela,

177
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:48,246
sends me violets
when he can!

178
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:56,154
Looks like it's up to me
to stop Chang.

179
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,222
Heee-yup!

180
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,224
Ooh!

181
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:04,329
(Grunting)
Hey, watch it!

182
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,731
(Efforting)

183
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:10,402
Ta-ta, j-tots!

184
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,739
El toro, what
should we do?

185
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,341
Not so fast, paco.

186
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,877
I'm the biggest, so that
means I'm in charge!

187
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,847
And I say, let's see what
uncle thinks we should do.

188
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,282
Heh heh!

189
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,285
(Laughter and chatter)

190
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:31,656
Sensei, sensei,
look what Jade did to us!

191
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,591
Tattletale.

192
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,797
Aiyaaa! What have you
done to us, Jade?

193
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,866
Whoa. Well, let's see.

194
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,669
I've turned Jackie
into a rough-houser,

195
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,204
tohru into a crybaby,

196
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,541
viper into a--blecch!--
Girly-girl,

197
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,844
and El toro
into--(Sniffs)

198
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,080
Sorry.

199
00:11:55,082 --> 00:12:00,151
Pee-yew! Paco, maybe you
should change your hero.

200
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:03,221
El toro fuerte never
removes his pants!

201
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:07,292
Hmm. It would seem
Jade's spell

202
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:09,828
has left our
adult minds intact,

203
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,733
but made us victim
to childlike impulses!

204
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:19,237
(Giggles)
Uncle said,"butt!"

205
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,741
Jackie, this is no time
to be childish!

206
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:26,411
Jade is right!
We must act
our real ages!

207
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,912
We must find
the stolen Jade

208
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,814
and return it
to safety!

209
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:33,184
We must stop
Mr. poopy-head!

210
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:36,855
Nuh-uh, Jackie.
You're too young
to stop Chang.

211
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,723
And I'm too young
to be an adult!

212
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,792
Uncle, you have to
do something!

213
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:44,662
Luckily, uncle possesses
ancient fortune-teller

214
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:49,400
which will reveal
remedy to situation.

215
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:51,436
Pick color.

216
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:52,771
Uh, blue.

217
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:57,041
B-l-u-e.

218
00:12:57,043 --> 00:13:00,779
Ooh, fortune teller
reveals...

219
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:03,848
You have big crush
on Jade.

220
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,050
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

221
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:07,285
(Giggling)

222
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,255
¶ Jade and paco
sittin' in a tree ¶

223
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:13,792
ok, children,
you leave aunt Jade
no choice--

224
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,094
it's naptime!

225
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:17,228
No siesta!

226
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,631
I'm not tired.

227
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,366
(Yawns)

228
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,839
First one asleep
gets a cookie
when they wake up.

229
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,846
Uh-uh.
Not you, paco.

230
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,314
I cannot win
the cookie?

231
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,183
Uncle, listen.

232
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:39,818
If you don't find
a reversal spell

233
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,020
to return the j-team
to normal fast,

234
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:45,290
the world's greatest
crime fighting team
is kaput!

235
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,859
Oh, oh! Any leads
on Chang?

236
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:50,428
Intelligence indicates
Chang owns a cargo ship

237
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,096
docked at port 17.

238
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:55,200
No doubt he'll try and
move the stolen goods
out of the country.

239
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:57,635
Not with the j-team
waiting.

240
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:01,673
Jackie, you sound
all...Chipmunky.

241
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:05,844
Captain black,
is the section 13
mainframe running?

242
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,545
Uh...Of course.

243
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,981
Then why don't you
catch it!

244
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,283
(Laughter)

245
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,054
Let's move!

246
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:19,190
But Jade said
we're not allowed
to stop...You know...

247
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,226
Mr. poopy-head?

248
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:24,963
Well, Jade did not say
we couldn't stop...

249
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:27,632
Mr. doody-face.

250
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,704
Just what I like
to hear...Nothing.

251
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:33,771
Huh?!

252
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,482
"Dear Jade, how are you?
I am fine.

253
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,718
"We went to port 17
to stop Chang.

254
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,420
"When I get back,
let's have a <i> tea party?</i>

255
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,689
Best friends forever.
Viper?!"

256
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:54,626
Unh! They pulled a Jade.

257
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:57,896
I better pull a Jackie
before it's too late.

258
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:01,299
¶ I have ants in my pants,
and I must dance ¶

259
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,268
uncle, do your homework

260
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,870
or...No dessert!

261
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:09,807
Paco, make sure
he finds that spell.

262
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,958
We can't let them steal
all the pretty Jade.

263
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,695
(Gulp) But we're
no match for them.

264
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,897
You are <i> El pollo.</i>

265
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:35,233
(Imitating chicken)

266
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:38,303
No. Tohru may be
a crybaby,

267
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:39,704
but he is right.

268
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,306
(Whimpering)

269
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:43,741
We need to hatch
a plan.

270
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:45,710
A really mondo plan!

271
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:48,846
And final
ingredient...

272
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:50,682
Garlic.

273
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:53,251
Then this will
turn the j-team
back to normal?

274
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:55,253
No...

275
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:04,762
But it will make you
donkey boy! Ha ha ha ha!

276
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,464
Quickly now,

277
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,066
load the Jade
onto the ship

278
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:09,267
so we can--

279
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,202
(horn honks)

280
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,872
Move your leg.

281
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:17,275
You're stepping
on the brake.

282
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,777
Oh, oh,
tun left now.
Now right!

283
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,746
Have we lost them?

284
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:24,048
Uhh--unh!

285
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,759
So, you want to play?

286
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:37,695
Make the j-tots wish
they were never born.

287
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,599
(All gasp)

288
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,538
Jade: Back off,
you bullies!

289
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,041
Hyah!

290
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,981
Look out! It's a siamese
flesh-eating lizard!

291
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,018
Aah!

292
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,853
Aah!

293
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,856
Oop, don't forget...

294
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:08,059
(Chanting rapidly)

295
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,894
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?

296
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,699
Yes! Garlic's
the charm.

297
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,736
Warriors, attack!

298
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:20,371
(All yelling)

299
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,475
Ok, Jackie,
care to explain
the helium voice

300
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,344
and the crank calls?

301
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:27,812
Paco?

302
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:29,981
<i>Que pasa,</i>
<i>seor b</i> lack?

303
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,550
Hot cha!

304
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,152
Whoa, Nellie!

305
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:35,753
Never mind
donkey boy.

306
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:38,656
Uncle has devised
reversal spell.

307
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,425
Paco: You must take it
to the j-team.

308
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:42,527
<i>Seor u</i> ncle is
too young to drive.

309
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:45,730
But first we must stop
for ice cream!

310
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:46,864
Now?

311
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:49,901
You want uncle
to cast reversal spell

312
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,870
on j-team? Yes?

313
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:58,910
Then you will <i> stop</i>
à <i> for ice cream!</i>

314
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,979
Huh! Huh!

315
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:05,116
Sorry, Chang, I only
pick on villains
my own size.

316
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,552
Then the kid gloves
are off.

317
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,556
Whoa!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

318
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,927
Let's dance,
pipsqueak!

319
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,395
Hyah!
Hyah!

320
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,699
Rrrrrrr...
Rrrrrrr...

321
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,701
Unh! Ow!
Unh! Ow!

322
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:26,170
(Both crying)

323
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,512
Tag! You're it!

324
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:36,914
Hey, we're not
playing tag.

325
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,050
Then how about
peek-a-boo?!

326

00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:57,101
<i>Puebla</i> poo-plex.

330
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,571
(Sniffs)

331
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:05,576
Eww...Stinkies!

332
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:19,090
No fair!

333
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,927
Wedginator!

00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:25,663
Ooh! Ok, ok!

335
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,932
Uncle!

336
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:31,135
That is my name.
Do not wear it out.

337
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,574
Pbbbbbbbt!

338
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:39,477
(Chanting rapidly)

339
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,093
Yay!

340
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:58,029
Ahem. Ahem.

341
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,264
Uh, many thanks, <i> sensei.</i>

342
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:02,166
Good work, j-team.

343
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:04,168
You will need a note
from your parents

344
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,770
to get this back.

345
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,171
Rrrrrrr!

346
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:10,074
Yeah. You are so grounded!

347
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:11,976
Chang is not
the only one

348
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:13,878
who is grounded, Jade.

349
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,181
I know you are,
but what am I?

350
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,288
Hey, Jackie, what's your
favorite museum in the world?

351
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,357
There's only 2 museums
I really remember.

352
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,126
One is in Paris.
There's so many art.

353
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:30,995
I see Mona Lisa.

354
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:33,664
But there's one museum,
very interesting.

355
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,867
The Egypt, uh...Museum.

356
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,236
A lot of mummies.

357
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,605
A lot of different
interesting things.

358
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:43,374
Really, totally different
than Paris museum.
