00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,470
Hi. Welcome to Endless Pasta Week
at Tony Cicero's.

3
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,140
Where the fuck am I?

4
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,430
You're at Tony Cicero's.

5
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,640
No. What fucking city am I in?

6
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,220
Fort Wayne.

7
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,640
Fuck. You got a bit of paper,
something I could write with?

8
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:48,940
A pen, anything.

9
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,740
...closed at 10% below
its record high set last month.

10
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,990
Federal authorities
have initiated a muitistate manhunt

11
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,790
for William Butcher
for allegedly murdering

12
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,290
Vought vice president Madelyn Stillwell,

13
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,380
as we” as endangering
her infant son, Theodore.

14
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,970
Law enforcement officials have set up
a tipline and are urging anyone

15
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,590
with information regarding
the suspect's whereabouts...

16
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,750
Boy, girl...

17
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,960
I'm sorry. I do not understand.

18
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,470
All right, I'm off.

19
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,640
Where you going?

20
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,140
Going to meet a contact.

21
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,850
- Who?
- Someone who can help us

22
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,770
find this Supe terrorist cunt.

23
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,650
Who is the contact?
What is their actual name?

24
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,700
- You'll love it.
- No, I won't. I won't love it.

25
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,030
I never love it. I never fucking love it.

26
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,120
- Noted.
- Not a word from him.

27
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,790
He left us for dead,
and now it's like nothing happened?

28
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,470
You're right. I am sorry.

29
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,100
Sorry that I trusted this lot
was smart enough to save themselves

30
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,310
- like they've done a hundred times before.
- Okay, well, where you been?

31
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,690
Well, technically, I called him back.

32
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,860
He blew up Madelyn Stillwell.

33
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,480
I told you. She was already dead
when I blew her up.

34
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,700
Great. Cool. Totally.

35
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,860
We're just gonna pretend
like this is normal?

36
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,200
Like we're fucking lemmings?

37
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,420
Well, who else they gonna follow?

38
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,470
Right.

39
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,950
Hey. You know, my dad?

40
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,160
He had a ball from the '56 World Series
signed by Don Larsen himself.

41
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,200
Pitched a no-hitter in game five.

42
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,330
- Really?
- Pretty cool?

43
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,590
That's okay. You'll get the next one.

44
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,470
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

45
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,300
Yeah, I'll get the next one.

46
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,680
Okay. Ryan.

47
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,930
Use your powers.

48
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,230
What do you mean?

49
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,740
I can't do that.

50
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,860
Yes, you can. You're my son.

51
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,410
Has anyone told you
what you're capable of?

52
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,460
No.

53
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,710
Well, then it's about time you found out.

54
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Ryan. Come on, math time, buddy.
Chapters 12 and 13 in your workbook.

55
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,850
Yeah. Math, yeah. Sorry, I forgot.

56
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,640
It's your favourite.
I'll be in in a minute.

57
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,940
When I was his age,
I was breaking the sound barrier.

58
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,190
He can't even throw a fastball.

59
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:04,440
We thought it was best that he have
as ordinary of a childhood as possible.

60
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,530
We?

61
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,320
Who's we?

62
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,030
Look, I just want my kid to be normal.

63
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,660
Then it's a good thing I'm here.

64
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,420
Because my son
is the furthest fucking thing

65
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,540
on this planet to a normal boy.

66
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,380
How long are you planning on staying?

67
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,800
Becca...

68
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,550
we had a deal.

69
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:33,560
A deal that is alive and well and running
around as free as a goddamn bird.

70
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,730
So let's just try and be civil, shall we?

71
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,000
Did I get them right?

72
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,710
There's... There's no correct
or incorrect answer.

73
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,140
What is missing here?

74
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,940
Deep. How do you expect
to be welcomed back into The Seven

75
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,860
if you can't be honest with yourself?

76
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,280
Carol, if I'm being honest...

77
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,820
...I don't know what the fuck
you want from me.

78
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,790
Hey, guys. How's it going?

79
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,830
Can I have a word?

80
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,500
I don't mean to be negative,
but his operating perspective

81
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,710
is functionally non-existent.

82
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,130
I don't think there's a path here.

83
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,340
Leave it to me.

84
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,140
You're just inhibited
by suppressive energy.

85
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,060
That's it. Just gotta realign things.

86
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,430
What is it, shrooms'?

87
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,310
Last time I did shrooms
was at a Goo Goo Dolls concert

88
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,690
with some poli-sci chick from Oberlin.

89
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,650
I guess I call it more of a gateway.

90
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,160
Are you not gonna drink any?

91
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,540
No. Deep, this is your journey.

92
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,800
Who's revving up
the girl power in The Seven?

93
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,850
Keep watching WDCS,

94
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:40,060
Cleveland's first and best source
for local news.

95
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,640
Quiet, please. Going again.
On the bell. Rolling.

96
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,310
Where should I start?

97
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,060
Are you ready to meet
the newest member of The Seven?

98
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,070
See it here first, WFAK...

99
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,440
- KMFT... WDCS...
- Cut.

100
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,360
- Quiet. Still rolling.
- She's the newest member of The Seven,

101
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,950
and she's taking America by storm.

102
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,740
From Portland to Seattle,
watch what comes next, KMFT.

103
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:05,370
Amazing. Do you need to take
a break, or can we power through the rest?

104
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,580
Let's just power through.

105
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,340
Turn this way! Look here!

106
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,090
Over here. Give us a shot!

107
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,170
Gorgeous.

108
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,890
Stormfront, show us what you got.

109
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,770
Okay, ladies, we have a big day.

110
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,520
Domestic outlets until noon,
ten minutes each.

111
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,110
Foreign until 2. Roundtables until 4.

112
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,610
Print one-on-ones until 6...

113
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,030
If she vibrates any faster,
that stick up her ass is gonna explode.

114
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:39,990
Hello?

115
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,790
What?

116
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,830
When?

117
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,460
Okay. Thank you.

118
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,090
...positive, we're going female,
thoughtful but upbeat...

119
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,760
- Where...? What?
- I gotta go.

120
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,640
- What? No.
- I'm sorry. Family emergency.

121
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,060
Is everything okay?

122
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,100
We've never had three women
in The Seven before. This is a moment.

123
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,810
Girls get it done. You're not...

124
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,400
I have a family emergency too.

125
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,070
A reading
from the book of Revelations.

126
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,070
"And God shall wipe away all the tears
from their eyes

127
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,570
and there will be no more death."

128
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,700
Today, we say goodbye to Susan Raynor.

129
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,580
For though her body rests,
her soul lives on for all eternity,

130
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,250
and one day you will think of Susan
with joy as well as sadness.

131
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,590
They are two sides of a coin
you will carry forever.

132
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:41,760
And you are blessed to have your family
and your friends to help you carry it.

133
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,140
In the name of Christ, amen.

134
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:59,030
You think you can surprise me?
I literally taught you this one.

135
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,450
Hello, Grace.

136
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,620
You promised I'd never see you again.

137
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,370
I promised not to come
to your house again.

138
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,840
A subtle but important distinction.

139
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,380
I assume you sent the Edible Arrangement.

140
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,010
Deluxe Bereavement Bouquet with
white chocolate-dipped pineapple doves.

141
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,720
Raynor would've loved that.

142
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,520
Oi, Where you going?

143
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,860
There are about two dozen federal officers
in the church next door.

144
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,070
I'm gonna turn you in for the murder
of Madelyn Stillwell.

145
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,690
Come off it, Grace.
You really think I done that?

146
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,490
You really want me to answer that?

147
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,370
I know who killed Raynor.

148
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,450
Who?

149
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,130
Okay, well, I don't specifically,
technically have the answer to that,

150
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,500
but I know how to get it.

151
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,300
We think Vought killed her
for getting too close to something.

152
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,510
Getting too close to what?

153
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,010
Something to do with a Supe terrorist
smuggled into Jersey

154
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,260
a couple of nights ago.
And that is where we start.

155
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,850
Honestly, it's like asking a cockroach
to not be a cockroach.

156
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,140
It's just your nature.

157
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,980
I know what she meant to you, all right?

158
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,480
We find this terrorist, and we're one step
closer to finding out who offed her.

159
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,280
I'm not getting back in.
And if I were, which I'm not,

160
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,950
it sure as shit wouldn't be for you.

161
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:26,530
I ain't asking you all the way back in.
Just dip in a little toe, yeah?

162
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,700
Maybe two. Not for me, for Raynor.

163
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,210
You never gave a shit about Susan.
You're only here because you're desperate,

164
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,870
fucked, and you want something.

165
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,170
All right, fuck it. Grace, Grace!
Grace, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

166
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,550
I'll level with you, okay?

167
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,590

Hey!

In here. Open up.

178
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,850
Bro, we gotta talk.

179
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,430
No, you gotta look at us.

180
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,190
Look at us!

181
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,440
Okay.

182
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,530
Remember Melissa Dabrowski?

183
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,870
The kindergarten teacher you fingerbanged
backstage at the VH1 Educator Awards?

184
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,120
So what?

185
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,910
You were supposed to present her
with Teacher of the Year,

186
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,670
but you bailed while she was pulling
her panties back on.

187
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,130
Yeah, because she laughed at me.

188
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,090
Bullshit. She just put
her hands on your chest.

189
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,670
You never even unzipped your suit.

190
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,840
She would've laughed.

191
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,350
Because that's what you do.
You imagine women will laugh at us,

192
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,100
so you humiliate them first.

193
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,680
No, that's not true.

194
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,230
You can't accept your own body,
so you violate theirs.

195
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,310
Sh...

196
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,520
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

197
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,150
Hey, hey. Hey.

198
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,110
- Let me out!
- You can't swim from us forever.

199
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,580
You shut the fuck up,
you ugly pieces of shit.

200
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,290
I have nothing else to say to you.

201
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,660
We won't let you shut
us up anymore, Kevin.

202
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:42,670
Hey, hey. Hey. Let me out, man.
Just let me out! Eagle!

203
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,050
Let me out, man!

204
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,260
Ride it, brother.

205
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,030
What are you doing here?

206
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,910
Apparently, your work...

207
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,130
still has Maggie Shaw
as your emergency contact.

208
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,630
Shit. Sorry.

209
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,710
That's okay.

210
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,840
Where else would I score this sweet jelly?

211
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,930
I thought it was bad unagi.

212
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,180
Turns out my appendix was about to burst.

213
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:42,520
Well, there are easier ways
to get my attention.

214
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,770
I kept thinking you'd call.

215
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,320
Yeah. Me too.

216
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,990
You want me to call your mom?

217
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,330
Definitely not.

218
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,000
Someone else, like a girlfriend or...?

219
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,960
Seriously? Thanks for coming, but I'm sure
you have more important places to be.

220
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,920
Hey. You could die
from something like this.

221
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,590
But I didn't.
So I guess you don't need to save me.

222
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,470
Yeah, well, I still wanna see the doctor.

223
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,930
Maeve, I'm fine. I promise.

224
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:28,110
You know, watching Botched
doesn't make you a fucking medical expert.

225
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,490
I'll wait a while. Let's just see, okay?

226
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,160
Can we get this middle chair out of here,
please? Somebody? Thank you.

227
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,660
Can we get the two on the side
just smushed together?

228
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,750
We lost one of them.

229
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,660
Okay, resetting, one background.

230
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,540
- People, quiet on the set.
- Rolling.

231
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,380
Stormfront, congrats on The Seven.
Are you as excited to be here as I am?

232
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,510
I don't know.
I don't think so.

233
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,840
Can you tell us a little
about how girls get it done?

234
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,930
- ...girls get it done?
- ...girls get it done?

235
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,430
- ...girls get it done?
- Let's dish boys.

236
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,850
- Starlight, single or spoken for?
- Single, single. Single.

237
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,060
Single. Definitely single.

238
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,770
Tell us how fun it is
to have all this girl power.

239
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,230
Can you repeat that but say,

240
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,490
"Strong is the new pretty"
right at the end?

241
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,320
Do girls make better heroes?

242
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,320
Do girls make
better heroes than boys?

243
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,830
Do girls make better heroes?

244
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,660
Look, no of fence.

245
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,250
I get you have your talking points,

246
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:26,290
but why does it matter
whether heroes have a dick or a vag?

247
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,750
I mean, shouldn't we all just,
you know, be competent at our jobs?

248
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,840
I don't think girls do anything better.
Chicks and dicks are in it together.

249
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,590
That's me.

250
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,640
Sorry, Ashy.

251
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,190
Vought won't let me have pockets
in this thing.

252
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,480
You can see every crease in my ass.
You can see up Starlight's uterus.

253
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,900
You wanna talk about girl power?
Let's talk about getting some pockets.

254
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,370
Starlight, your teammate A-Train
has been out of the public eye.

255
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,870
Vought recently revealed that he was
on a top-secret mission in Kandahar.

256
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,580
- Are you worried about him?
- Yeah, of course.

257
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,040
I pray for him every night.

such a brave hero fighting for them.

260

Hey! Here comes the A-Train!
What's up?

261
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,930
- Wow.
- All right. Yeah.

262

it is such an honor to meet you.

265
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,900
- I'm a huge fan. Don't get up.
- Feeling's mutual.

266
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,950
No, yeah.
I'm just gonna relax for a second.

267

They told me you came by my room
every day to pray for me.

00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,300
- Thank you.
- . You're so welcome.

285
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:47,640
Yeah, I think that prayer
really does help.

Anyway...

287

if I hadn't been there to give you CPR?

That's good to know.

How does everyone feel about you helping
your traitor fucking boyfriend escape?

Or maybe you didn't mention that part.

So...

294
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,520

Don't fuck with me.

316
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,780
You deserve to be loved, Kevin.
But that starts with you.

317
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,780
Don't fuck with me.

318
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,950
Take a look. A real look.

319
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,870
Go on.

320
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,720
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

321
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,180
I'm the ugly one.

322
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,140
- No.
- Yes.

323
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:22,980
On the inside.

324
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,280
You just don't see what I see.

325
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:44,170
♪ You are so beautiful ♪

326
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,420
No.

So in short, do not waste
your hard-earned cash

343
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,840
on this shitty, big-titted hunk of plastic

344
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,300
that'll end up in a manatee's belly
when your kid chucks it in the garbage.

345
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,130
Hey, um...

346
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,640
I just gotta say...

347
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,560
I really like everything
that you've been saying about Vought.

348
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,930
Yeah, okay, cool.

349
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,100
No, I mean, I agree with you.

350
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,980
- You wearing a wire or something?
- What? What does that have to...?

351
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,820
Look, I mean this
in the nicest possible way,

352
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,240
but I don't need some fucking
Vought-spy Barbie sniffing around

353
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,820
to see whether I'm a team player.

354
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:43,000
What? That is not at all what I am.

355
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,170
I used to be a fan. But look at you.

356
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,290
You're like the Voughtiest Vought
in all Vought.

357
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:59,010
I think, Cyclops Dude's
trying to get your attention.

358
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,970
What happened to your eye?

359
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:08,190
Vought is testing a new volumising
dry shampoo for eye irritation.

360
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,440
As if you give a fuck.

361
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,730
Here. I brought you a sample.

362
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:20,120
Are you kidding me?
I can't take this right now.

363
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,950
I can't get away from this press junket.

364
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,700
- I literally have no pockets.
- You wanted the V, here it is.

365
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:29,170
If you threaten me again,
I'll make sure everyone knows you took it.

366
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,590
- You tight with Gecko?
- Hey.

367
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:40,590
Yeah, from Capes for Christ,
back in the day.

368
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,140
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

369
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,350
- What'd you just put in your boot?
- What? Nothing.

370
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,440
'Cause it looked like
you just put something in your boot.

371
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,780
Why don't you tell me what's in my boot?

372
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,410
Stormfront and Starlight,
signing autographs...

373
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:19,930
Maybe you shouldn't be hitting the Chrystal
with your buddies quite so soon.

374
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,180
Come on.

375
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,810
Let's finish dick-tickling these half-wits
so we can finally do our real job.

376
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,560
Shall we?

377
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,240
All right, kiddo. Here we are.

378
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,360
- Have a great lesson.
- Yep.

379
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,910
Okay. I'll be back in an hour.
I'm gonna have coffee with Miss Bird.

380
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:49,290
Yep. Um...

381
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,370
Thanks. Bye.

382
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,830
Hi, Ryan. How are you?

383
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,430
Open the door.

384
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,770
- Open the fucking door!
- Please get back inside the car.

385
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,610
I want to talk to Dr Park.

386
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,690
Go back inside the car.

387
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,730
Goddamn it! Dr Park, now!

388
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,700
- Hey, Becca.
- What the fuck is going on?

389
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,870
I understand this is upsetting.

390
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:13,330
I was told I would never
have to see him ever again,

391
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,210
that he would never know
about Ryan or me.

392
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,290
That was the deal.

393
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,460
Homelander is quite upset that this
information was concealed from him.

394
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,510
Corporate has made a decision
not to antagonize him further.

395
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,010
You need to make him leave.

396
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,800
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna take Ryan and I'm gonna run,

397
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,680
and you'll never fucking find us
ever again.

398
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,060
I think we both know
that that's not possible.

399
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,480
You have to protect us.

400
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:42,690
You have... You have to move us, please.

401
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,610
I'm sorry.

402
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:46,700
Now that he knows, there's no putting
the toothpaste back in the tube.

403
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,700
You should probably be getting back.
Piano lessons are almost done.

404
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,740
Just keep him calm.

405
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,370
Our best guess,
he'll get bored and move on.

406
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,920
You... You don't know that.

407
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,500
You don't.

408
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,720
Do I get to keep this?

409
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,140
Maybe. What will you trade me for it?

410
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,690
I will let you take me out to dinner.

411
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,820
Right.

412
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,950
I forgot. We'll need to order in.
Keep it low-pro.

413
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,740
Maeve, what are you doing here
if nothing has changed?

414
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,330
Christ.

415
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,710
The last thing that woman needs
is another nose job.

416
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:40,250
Okay, we've done this dance, thanks.

417
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,380
- Elena.
- It's time to go.

418
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:05,230
Homelander and I went to this Oscar party
for 12 Years a Slave.

419
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,530
There was this producer.

420
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:09,570
He swapped place cards
so he could sit next to me.

421
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,450
And he chatted me up all night.

422
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:15,080
Two days later,
there's a fire in his office.

423
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,700
They found his head in one room...

424
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,290
and his torso in another.

425
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,460
What are you saying?

426
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,470
I don't want him to do that to you.

427
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,090
Who?

428
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,020
Homelander?

429
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,100
You think Homelander did that?

430
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,860
The things that I've watched him do...

431
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,900
the things that he made me do...

432
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,830
If he ever finds out about you...

433
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,960
Why are you telling me this now?

434
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,850
I don't want you to hate me anymore.

435
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,640
Cool. Thank you.

436
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,180
You're welcome.

437
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:25,190
It's crazy
you don't have one already, actually.

438
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,820
I don't really have anyone
to call, though.

439
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,530
Well, you can call me.

440
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:38,950
You know, Ryan, um, when I was your age,
I didn't have many friends, either.

441
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,540
Mom says being lonely
makes you know yourself better.

442
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:46,330
Well, that's not wrong, I suppose.

443
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:53,470
Can I tell you a secret?
Man-to-man? You know?

444
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:10,190
My dad and I, we never played catch
in the yard with a World Series ball.

445
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,940
Truth is...

446
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,910
I never had a dad.

447
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,370
Or a mom.

448
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,410
Wait, you didn't?

449
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:29,290
See, sometimes it's hard, Ryan,

450
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:34,380
being superior to every single
other person on the planet.

451
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,930
It's isolating.

452
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:41,850
And gods should not have to feel
that kind of...

453
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,680
you know, pain.

454
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:50,400
Because that is what we are, Ryan.

455
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,360
You and me...

456
00:33:58,490 --> 00:33:59,620
we're gods.

457
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:07,670
Son, we can do anything we want,

458
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,420
and no one can stop us.

459
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,750
Now, that...

460
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,050
That's a good feeling.

461
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,930
A really good feeling.

462
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,310
And now

463
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:28,190
you and me can share it together.

464
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,020
I—...

465
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,530
I should probably go to bed now, you know?

466
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,400
Sure.

467
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,380
I love you, son.

468
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,920
Now you say it back.

469
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,640
Um, I love you too.

470
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,970
This is nice.

471
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,190
- Your turn, Mom.
- You need to leave.

472
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,410
Excuse me?

473
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:23,070
You need to get the fuck out of my house.

474
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,880
What happens one day

475
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,590
when Ryan asks
to go to a baseball game,

476
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,590
swim in the ocean,
or eat at a Burger King?

477
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:46,180
How is he gonna feel when he finds out
that you've lied to him his whole life?

478
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:54,980
Think he's gonna be happy
that you kept him in this pretty prison?

479
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:02,320
Or... do you think
he'll fucking despise you?

480
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,500
Let's go ask him.

481
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Don't.

482
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,040
You were right.

483
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,960
I'm not gonna get bored and move on.

484
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,760
I'm not going anywhere.

485
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,720
So feel free to tell Dr Park
to go fuck himself.

486
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,730
How about some Jiffy Pop?

487
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,570
Halothane shot.

488
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,740
I only got two of these, so...

489
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,080
Well, we better make it count.

490
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,620
What if it doesn't work
on the terrorist inside?

491
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,460
Then we're right and well fucked.

492
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,310
Are you okay?

493
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,100
Shining Light Liberation Army.

494
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,980
The ones who kidnapped you?

495
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,690
You know this man?

496
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,400
What is going on?

497
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,910
Kimiko?

498
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:42,540
Mouse.

499
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,590
I never thought I'd see you again.

500
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,760
Boy and girl.

501
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,800
Her brother.

502
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,930
That's what she was trying to tell me.

503
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,230
Butcher, wait, wait, wait.
It's her brother.

504
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:43,810
Kimiko!

505
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,980
Wait!

506
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:01,450
Hey.

507
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,370
You don't know me.

508
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,080
I'm not a sellout.

509
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:09,380
Okay. Cool. Congratulations.

510
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,260
Come on.
Why do you care what I think?

511
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:20,430
Maybe I want to say everything
that you're saying about Vought.

512
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,020
Maybe I think Vought's...

513
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,440
What? What's Vought?

514
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,700
My God.
Everyone is so fucking stage-managed.

515
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:39,580
Life isn't actually a PR strategy.
You can say what you think.

516
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,160
What if it's not safe?

517
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,040
You are literally bulletproof.
What the fuck is gonna happen?

518
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:47,960
Okay.

519
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,750
Who's the greatest superhero of all time?

520
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,800
Homelander?

521
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,260
No. Pippi Longstocking.

522
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,550
Pippi Longstocking,
she's a 9-year-old girl,

523
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,430
lived in a house all by herself?

524
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:02,520
Pet monkey?
Could lift a horse with one hand?

525
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,350
You haven't read Pippi Longstocking?

526
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,140
I guess not.

527
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,360
Okay, well, I used to dress as her
every Halloween,

528
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,280
and all the girls dressed
like Disney sluts would make fun of me.

529
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,990
And you know what I thought?
I thought, "Who fucking cares?"

530
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:22,700
Pippi didn't care. She never cared
about being polite or cute.

531
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,250
Look.

532
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,710
Fuck this world
for confusing nice with good.

533
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:34,590
Be a bitch if you want. Be whatever.
Just drop the mask once in a while.

534
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:35,760
Feels good.

535
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,880
You can finally breathe.

536
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,850
And if someone sticks a dick
in your mouth, bite it off.

537
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:51,150
Pippi Longstocking would bite a D.

538
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,820
That's for damn sure.

539
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:04,530
Butcher!

540
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,540
Hold on, mon ami.

541
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,540
- Give me your hand.
- Okay.

542
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,520
No. No, Butcher! No. Easy, easy, Butcher.

543
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,940
The CIA would have locked him up
in a black box forever.

544
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,560
- She'd never have seen her brother again.
- Easy!

545
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:36,780
Both of you, please. Not now.

546
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:42,950
Right.

547
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,670
You...

548
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:54,210
fuck off.

549
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,470
The rest, you're with me.

550
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,310
Well, come on. Don't piss about.
We ain't got all night.

551
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,310
The fuck you waiting for?

552
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:29,160
Are you telling me

553
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:33,460
that her family is worth more to you
than you seeing your own?

554
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,540
No.

555
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,130
I'm not.

556
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:40,800
But Kimiko is one of us.

557
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:43,840
I'll find another way.

558
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:46,970
I suppose you agree, don't you?

559
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:49,520
Since your tongue is halfway up her ass.

560
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,430
Jesus.

561
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,770
It's like Hughie's infected you both
with a raging case of vagina!

562
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,240
Becca's alive.

563
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:11,950
What?

564
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:18,210
She's alive.
Vought's holding her captive somewhere.

565
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:19,800
Butcher, if you...

566
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,840
No, I'm not stark raving, all right?
I fucking saw her.

567
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,180
She had a little boy with her.

568
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,930
The spitting image of Homelander.

569
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:35,060
I thought he just wanted to humiliate me,

570
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,190
show me what he'd done to my girl

571
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,690
before he gave me the good news.

572
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:43,280
Then I woke up three hours later
in a Tony fucking Cicero's.

573
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,400
God knows why.

574
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:52,200
I gotta find her,

575
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:55,960
and I gotta get her the fuck out of there.

576
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:00,500
And I need your help to do it.

577
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,130
Are you fucking with us?

578
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:05,760
I find the terrorist for Mallory,

579
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,220
she finds Becca for me.

580
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,550
That's the deal I made.

581
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,930
I know what I done to you. All right?

582
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,430
And by rights,
you should tell me to fuck off.

583
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,890
But still...

584
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,060
I'm asking.

585
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,290
When you...

586
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:39,380
When you disappeared that night...

587
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:42,090
I'm sorry.

588
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:45,380
We were supposed to watch out
for each other and then you were gone.

589
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:55,020
Shining Light sent me here.

590
00:46:55,100 --> 00:47:01,310
Put the needle in my spine
and filled me full of the blue poison.

591
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:07,900
I should have found you.

592
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:12,280
No. I'm the big sister.
I should have come back for you, but...

593
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,500
...they made me into...

594
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:24,670
...a monster.

595
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:31,050
If that's true, we're both monsters now.

596
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,770
Did it hurt?

597
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:38,020
I wanted to die.

598
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,520
Me too.

599
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,820
They had one dose left

600
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,200
and they knew it worked on you

601
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,780
so they figured it would work on me.

602
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,630
I'm sorry.

603
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:05,340
It's not your fault.

604
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:26,270
It's not your fault.

605
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:03,310
Who...? Who we sexting'?

606
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:06,690
What...?
What are you doing in here? Get out.

607
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,110
I'd... Okay.

608
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:14,450
Look, you got me.
I'm having a heavy flow day. It's...

609
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:21,250
- What are you doing with this?
- This is not how it looks.

610
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:24,420
Okay? It's just a misunderstanding.

611
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,500
Homelander should have charred your ass

612
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:29,210
as soon as he found out
that you were fucking Hughie.

613
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,050
Hughie saved your life. We both did.

614
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:34,420
Your mistake.

615
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:37,260
Okay, if you just give me a minute,
I can explain.

616
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:40,810
You know,
I just want you to think about me

617
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:42,730
when you're getting the skin

618
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,850
peeled off your face, bitch.

619
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:53,650
You're not gonna tell anyone anything.

620
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,070
Who says that I haven't already?

621
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,160
'Cause then I'd already be dead.

622
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,450
You're not gonna do shit.

623
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,790
Why is that?

624
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,460
'Cause you killed your fucking girlfriend.

625
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,170
That's what you told Hughie, right?
That you killed Popclaw?

626
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,010
You can't prove anything.

627
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,850
Did she suffer?

628
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:28,560
Did you look into her big, sad eyes
while you did it?

629
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,480
Fuck you.

630
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:36,360
Yeah, see,
I looked at the Vought forensics report,

631
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:37,530
and...

632
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,160
Wow.

633
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,540
All those needles jammed into her arm
at the same time?

634
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:47,160
I mean, one of them
actually shattered the bone.

635
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:49,830
Did you know that? Would someone
really do that to themselves?

636
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,590
I mean,
doesn't look like an accident to me.

637
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:55,340
I mean, Vought's happy to bury it,

638
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,680
but, you know, say, if...

639
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,430
Sports Illustrated found out...

640
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:05,310
If you do that...

641
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:09,100
I'm gonna take you down right with me.

642
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,440
And then we'll both be dead.

643
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:15,280
Go ahead.

644
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:17,490
Fucking try it.

645
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:20,110
I don't give a shit.

646
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:57,070
These people you were with...

647
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:00,240
They keep me safe.
They'll keep you safe too.

648
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:06,740
Or we can go home. Back to the village.

649
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,830
There is no village anymore.

650
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,210
What?

651
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,170
They came for us.

652
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:17,340
Who?

653
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,590
The Americans.

654
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:21,550
This hero came shrieking
out of the sky like a demon.

655
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:25,760
Destroyed the camp.
And all the villages around it too.

656
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:29,140
There were bodies everywhere.

657
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,810
Everyone's gone.

658
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:34,810
Then we'll go somewhere else.
Back to Japan.

659
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,730
Maybe grandma and grandpa
are still alive.

660
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,690
You don't care?

661
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:42,240
That the Superhero split
an old woman in half?

662
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,820
That the entire school caved in
with the kids inside?

663
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:48,830
That babies burned alive in their cribs
when the propane tanks exploded?

664
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:51,750
I never wanted this.
But they were right all along.

665
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:54,460
Shining Light is full of shit!

666
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:57,000
Shining Light fights injustice.

667
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,710
They stand up for
people without a voice.

668
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,130
They murdered our parents!

669
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,300
This country is an enemy
to the whole world now.

670
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,180
We need to fight back. Fight with me!

671
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:13,600
You're the boy who nursed
every mouse who lost its mother.

672
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:17,820
That was a long time ago.

673
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:21,650
You're still my brother.

674
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,240
Then... you know I have to do this.

675
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:58,790
Are you all right? Mon coeur!

676
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,260
Well, cheers, love.

677
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,180
At least someone's got
some sense around here.

678
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,310
You come between me and my missus again,

679
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,810
I'll fucking kill you.

680
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:26,750
Hey, kid. You coming?

681
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,900
