{\an5}Besides, the last explosion
in this lab

96
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,120
{\an5}caused a "Freaky Friday"
Firestorm.

97
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,600
I miss them, too.

98
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,840
{\an5}I broke into the loony bin
to perform an exorcism.

99
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,280
{\an5}And while I was at it,
that demon called your name.

100
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,120
Said you'd soon be slipping
into the dark.

101
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,280
{\an5}And I figured if Emily's demon
knows you on a first name basis

102
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,920
{\an5}you might know something that
can help me save you both.

103
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,480
I don't need saving.
And I am done fighting demons.

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,680
You think this has something to do
with the demon we're fighting?

105
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,440
I was speaking of them
metaphorically, but

106
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,360
{\an5}yes, I did recently visit
the spirit world.

107
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,920
{\an5}It's a long story,
but it's probably how

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,480
the demon knows my name.

109
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,800
{\an5}And the demon's name is Mallus.

110
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,400
Mallus.

111
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,440

this Mallus wanker out.

yourselves into,

115
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,680
but I suggest you leave it
to the experts.

116
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,640
{\an5}So nice one for the tip.
I've got a girl to save.

117
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,040
{\an5}Oh, not so fast.
You said it yourself.

118
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,920
{\an5}This is not just any demon,

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,280
{\an5}and we've been fighting it
before you even knew its name.

120
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,720
And if this girl's
connected to Mallus,

121
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,480
she might be able
to help us destroy him.

Yep.

That's out of
the bloody question, love.

125

Well, we gave you its name.
So you owe us.

126

Well, I gave you your soul.

So you owe me indefinitely.

128

{\an5}First, I apologize
for interrupting.

158
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,040
{\an5}Second, that woman
clearly has a crush on you.

159
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,840
- Just don't.
- Come, come, Captain.

160
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,320
She called you for
absolutely no reason.

161
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,960
It was just an excuse to talk
to you.

162
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,360
{\an5}Gideon, play back
that last bit, please.

163
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,680
{\an5}- Gideon, don't.
- Yeah.

164
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,120
Head down, eyes up,
cheeks flushed.

165
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,120
Classic courtship signals.

166
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,520
Even if it was and it is not

167
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,320
we're completely different people.

168
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,760
I don't know,
you're both strong women.

169
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,680
You're both obsessed
with repairing time.

170
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,720
You're both super-hot.

171
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,240
Gay, not blind.

172
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,520
Look, Ava's the kind of girl

173
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,920
that you take home
to your parents,

174
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,720
and I am the kind you take
to an exorcism.

175
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,960
All right, we've landed.
Where did they move her?

176
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,800
Can't find anyone named Emily
in the admissions record.

177
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
Guys, be careful.

178
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,640
You're in an asylum with a demon.

179
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,760
It's a twofer of terror.

180
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,520
Give her an additional
four milligrams of thiopental,

181
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,560
- and prep her for another session.
- That's her.

182
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,640
Oh, there she is.

183
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,960
Thank you, I can take it from here.

184
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,880
I mean, her from here.

185
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,600
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- I'm Doctor...

186
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,160
Yeah, I'm not doing this.

187
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,600
Nice one, love.

188
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,840
I'll make sure no one else
gets in our way.

189
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,400
Find a place for her,
and we'll rendezvous.

190
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,680
All right, now,
where to perform an exorcism?

191
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,080
There's a vacant room
in the east wing,

192
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,560
- room 237.
- 237. Allons-y, Alonzo.

193
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,080
It's Kuasa. I'll hold her off. Go.

194
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,880
I don't wanna fight you.

195
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,480
- I just wanna talk.
- There is no time for talk.

196
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,240
I must protect the moment
she became his.

197
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,320
Emily, Emily,
I need you to speak to me.

198
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,680
That's...

199
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,400
That's not my name.

200
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,280
<i>Guys?</i>

201
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,160
That girl you're trying to save...

202
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,880
<i>is Nora frigging Darhk.</i>

203
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,280
This is Damien Darhk's daughter?
How is that even possible?

204
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,480
<i>They changed her name.</i>

205
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,400
Looks like after Darhk was
killed by the Green Arrow,

206
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,560
Nora was place in
Child Protective Services.

207
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,000
Demons prey on
the most vulnerable of souls.

208
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,880
This one, she lost her name,
her family.

209
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,840
Okay, so if we exorcise Mallus,

210
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,880
we can stop the family business
before it takes off.

211
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,000
We need her alert for an exorcism.

212
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,480
Nora. Nora, love.

213
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,280
They've got her knocked out cold.

214
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,280
You guys, go hit up the pharmacy.
See if you can find some adrenaline.

215
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,680
Screw it.

216
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,920
I'm gonna help Amaya.
You get the drugs.

217
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,960
Nate, take it.

218
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,800
- How do I use it?
- You pull the trigger.

219
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,880
Leo, we really need

220
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,840
- Yes, drugs, pronto. On it.
- Nice one.

221
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,160
Oh, and see if you can
find me a light, yeah?

222
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,320
Got it!

223
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,280
What?

224
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,240
- Oh, that is a sensitive trigger.
- Nate, don't!

225
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,000
What did you do to her?

226
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,440
She was gonna kill you, Amaya.

227
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,040
Let's get your granddaughter
back on the ship

228
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,120
before she thaws out.

229
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,080
I got the adrenaline,
and what is this?

230
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,680
It's the Triangle of Solomon

231
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,280
with some elder runes
and Enochian script.

232
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,080
It's a trap of my own design.

233
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,320
Mallus will have no chance
of breaking free.

234
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,800
Now, I gotta warn you both.

235
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,240
Things are about to get
a little bit wonky in here.

236
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,600
Anything with an electrical current,
you might want to turn it off.

237
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,720
- Guys, we're going dark.
- Good luck.

238
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,720
Give it a nudge, love.

239
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,640
Who are you? Where am I?

240
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,720
It's okay, all right? You're safe.

241
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,160
Now, you told John here that
you heard voices in your head.

242
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,760
Can you tell us
what they were saying?

243
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,000
The six.

244
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,280
- Six.
- Six, the six.

245
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,800
The number of the Beast.
Now, step aside, Lance.

246
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,800
It's okay.

247
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,280
I summon the demon Mallus.
I order you to come forth.

248
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,840
Step into the light!

249
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,720
- Nora
- No, no, no!

250
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
That's not Nora.

251
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,080
I've been expecting you,
Sara Lance.

252
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,440
Soon you'll gaze upon
my true face.

253
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,760
Soon you will inhabit my world.

254
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,160
Mallus, you tosspot. I see you.

255
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,280
<i>Exorcizamus te,
omnis immundus spiritus,</i>

256
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,000
omnis incursio infernalis!

257
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,400
No, John.

258
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,800
Your tricks won't work on me!

259
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,040
Bloody hell.

260
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,040
Any ideas?

261
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,720
Those were my ideas.

262
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,280
<i>Gaesta ur nemdai
im baafed ur shael!</i>

263
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,120
She's preparing an incantation.

264
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,440
Maybe we should stop her.

265
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,880
<i>Gaesta ur nemdai
im baafed ur shael.</i>

266
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,840
Emily?

267
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,840
Emily, are you all right?

268
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:35,680
They were trying to help me,
but now he has them.

269
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,720
So, where are we, exactly?

270
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,440
Well, I think
the question is "when?"

271
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,920
Oh, January 16th, 1969.

272
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,640
She sent us back in time.

273
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,080
Wait, is that Nora's doctor?

274
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,880
Apparently her taste
in jewelry never changed.

275
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,040
But yeah, this is all a bit weird.

276
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,160
Can we get your team
to come pick us up?

277
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,480
We can't communicate across
time without special equipment.

278
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,120
You mean, we're stuck here?

279
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,240
<i>It's the time
of the season for loving</i>

280
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,720
Well, we wouldn't wanna
stand out, now would we?

281
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
Bollocks.

282
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,680
Look, they still have the same
paintings on the walls.

283
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,280
That's how we send a message.

284
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,440
The picture of the blessed
virgin that fell off the wall

285
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,680
when Nora was possessed

286
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,880
would still be hanging now in 1969.

287
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,480
If we write the message
on the back of the painting,

288
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,280
then the Legends
will find it in 2017.

289
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,280
Sure, as long as no one redecorates
for the next 50 years.

290
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,480
Fingers crossed.

291
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,640
Mick, have you heard from
Sara or the rest of the team?

292
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,800
They're not answering on comms.

293
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,320
Well, that explains
the peace and quiet.

294
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,960
It's fine, she's my granddaughter.

295
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,800
- Yeah, well, tell that to your arm.
- You two, take it outside.

296
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,320
It's week 16 of the division titles.

297
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,840
You know we're on
a time ship, right?

298
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,320
- Hey, Gideon, who won the...
- No!

299
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
I haven't watched a live game
of football in three years.

300
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,880
I do not wanna know the score.

301
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,360
- Sara, it's Ray. Do you copy?
- Z, would you please tell her

302
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,520
talking to Kuasa is a bad idea?

303
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,760
- No.
- Thank you.

304
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,600
I refuse to accept that
my granddaughter is pure evil.

305
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,680
Fine, she's 89 percent evil.

306
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,760
- Guys, I think Sara is in trouble.
- Quiet!

307
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,360
Haircut, take the new girl.

308
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,400
Find Blondie,
Fake Snart, and Trenchcoat.

309
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,760
Amaya, the Med-Bay.
Pretty, the library.

310
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,120
Water Bitch stays in the freezer.

311
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,280
You know, Mick, you're really

312
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,040
- showing some management potential.
- Get out.

313
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,680
You ready?

314
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,760
Bet you wish you'd
finished programming

315
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,320
that gun we'd been working on.

316
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,560
If you don't shut up
about that gun,

317
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,280
that demon's gonna be
the least of your...

318
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,400
Nate.

319
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,560
We haven't found Sara
or the rest of the team,

320
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,240
but we did find a strange symbol.

321
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,560
<i>What's it look like?</i>

322
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,880
Well, it looks like a circle
with a line above the circle,

323
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,600
and then there's like a U-shape
coming off of the circle.

324
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,240
A duck?

325
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,920
Welcome back to
the 21st century, you Luddites.

326
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,680
<i>Incoming message from Ms. Tomaz.</i>

327
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,120
What's it mean?

328
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,360
<i>It's an ancient runic symbol
used by practitioners</i>

329
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,800
<i>of the dark arts
for temporal manipulation.</i>

330
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,200
Oh, no.

331
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,040
Guys, I think Sara and Co.
got sucked into the timeline.

332
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,200
Gideon and I are gonna
do some research

333
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,840
to figure out where they're
gonna get spit out.

334
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,520
Or we can just ask her.

335
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,320
She is the one who cast the spell.

336
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,280
Hey, don't touch the meatloaf.
You'll regret it. Trust me.

337
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,320
This isn't my first time
in a place like this.

338
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,360
You know, I had this
roommate once who

339
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,440
who thought I was her pet cat.

340
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,400
She would hide tuna fish
in my bed every night.

341
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,040
Yeah, I don't know
what was worse, the smell,

342
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,760
or the fact that she insisted
on calling me "Slinky."

343
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,640
Friends of ours came
to see you last night.

344
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,800
They tried to help you.

345
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,800
- Where did you send them?
- I don't know.

346
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,840
It was the demon. He took over.

347
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,000
And I won't be able
to stop him the next time.

348
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,720
Then they'll lock me up
somewhere else.

349
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,360
Put me on their drugs.

350
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,920
No, no, they won't.

351
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
We're gonna get you out of here.

352
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,760
We can't take her out of here.

353
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,240
We're dealing with a D-E-M-O-N.

354
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,760
I'm not five.
I know how to spell "demon."

355
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,920
Places like this just
make people crazier,

356
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,640
more vulnerable.

357
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,520
Isn't it best we keep an eye on her?

358
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,440
- We can't take her on the ship.
- No, not the ship.

359
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,320
We need somewhere sunny and boring.

360
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,200
- Oh, that's your jam, right?
- That

361
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,720
that is my jam.

362
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,440
We need to give this girl a chance.

363
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,680
Who knows, maybe she
won't grow up to hate us.

364
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,840
Clear.

365
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,840
<i>Sara... Sara...</i>

366
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,040
<i>You're getting closer, Sara.</i>

367
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,280
Are you all right, love?

368
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,080
I'm fine. Come on.
We're almost at room 237.

369
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,360
<i>They can't reach you. Only I can.</i>

370
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,040
<i>Sara?</i>

371
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,200
- Nora?
<i>- Help me, Sara.</i>

372
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
Nora?

373
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,120
- Is that you?
- <i>Please.</i>

374
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
<i>Help.</i>

375
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,600
Captain Lance! What is it?

376
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,520
- There's nothing there.
- It's Mallus.

377
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,560
Well, I told you
there'd be repercussions

378
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,160
for going to the dark side.
It leaves a trace.

379
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,880
Now, that he's sniffed you out,
he'll wanna use you, too.

380
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,640
You can't let him break you.

381
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,840
- We gotta get out of here.
- Guard.

382
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,440
The painting.

383
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,640
I'll put a message behind it.

384
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,160
I'll see to her
then come and find you.

385
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,320
- All right.
- You gotta help me.

386
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,400
- He's coming for me.
- All right, come on.

387
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,000
What do you think you're doing?

388
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,480
Legends, we got dropped
through time from 2017

389
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,080
and are now trapped in the past.

390
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,720
The day is January 16th, 1969.
Come quick.

391
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,040
So you're a time traveler.

392
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,600
Would you believe I'm also
from an alternate Earth?

393
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,960
Of course you are.
Take him to the operating room.

394
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,160
Hey, hey, hey. Come here, come here.

395
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,760
Where are you going?
Here, stay with me.

396
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,640
- Stay with me.
- What's happening?

397
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,040
It's Mallus' trickery.

398
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,000
Fear, anger, he's using
your darkest emotions

399
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,520
to prime you for possession.

400
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,840
He wants you to be afraid.
I need you to fight him, Sara.

401
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,240
Feels like the mother
of all hangovers, don't it?

402
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,520
A shot of pickle juice
and a gin and tonic

403
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,840
will sort that right out.

404
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,400
Oh, I thought this was all over.

405
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,120
The blood lust,
the fight for my soul,

406
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,280
all the crap that I've had to endure.

407
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,400
Well, there's always
more crap to endure.

408
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,040
Take it from one who's

409
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,640
damned his own soul to Hell.

410
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,640
There was a...

411
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,320
A girl in Newcastle.

412
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,840
Astra.

413
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,360
I failed her.

414
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,800
Some might say
you should forgive yourself.

415
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,160
Well, if I could, then
perhaps I wouldn't have

416
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,160
the need to save
the likes of poor Nora.

417
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,280
What about you?

418
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,600
Have you forgiven yourself
for your sins?

419
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,360
I don't deserve forgiveness.

420
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,160
- What is that?
- It's a little reminder that,

421
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,520
you're a survivor.

422
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,720
Strong enough to keep even the
most powerful demons at bay.

423
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,360
A laundry room in
a mental asylum in 1969

424
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,320
might not be
the worst place to be stuck.

425
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,600
Are we really this damaged?

426
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,640
I certainly hope so.

427
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,880
You must find the heir.

428
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,200
She needs your protection.

<i>Frozen</i>

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,880
- Are you okay?
- What do you care, Nana Baa?

431
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,240
It's strange to be
called "grandmother."

432
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,560
If I've learned one thing,

433
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,760
it's that time travel
can be maddening.

434
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,920
I can imagine.

435
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,760
If you have the power
to change history

436
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,680
and you choose to do nothing

437
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,920
I choose to protect people

438
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,560
from those who would prey upon them.

439
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,880
And what about your own people?

440
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,200
If you really cared about them,

441
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,520
you'd take this ship back
to Zambesi, 1992.

442
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,440
I can't interfere with our fate.

443
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,960
Then you are a coward.

444
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,040
Yet you were
a wonderful grandmother.

445
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,000
I adored you, Nana Baa.

446
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,920
I wanted to be just like you.

447
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,000
- Then one night, the men came.
- Please, I can't know this.

448
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,360
I watched the men

449
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,440
murder you.

450
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,800
Then they burned
our village to the ground.

451
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,560
Mother ran with Mari.

452
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,640
- She abandoned me.
- No.

453
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,160
She thought you were dead.

454
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,840

in a country ravaged by war.

456
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,920
- I'm sorry, Kuasa.
- I learned to embrace the pain,

457

using it to strike bargains
with powerful beings.

458
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,160

459
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,320
What has he promised you?

460
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,200
Something you've refused.

461
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,560
A chance to protect our village.

462
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,520
A chance to save your life.

463

<i>Star City 2017</i>

464
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,120
A chance to go anywhere,

465
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,400
She just wants to feel normal.

with whipped cream
and caramel sauce.

472
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,640
we just got her off her meds.

473
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,280
Do you really wanna
get her hooked on sugar?

474
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,400
You know what?
I think I'll have a donut, too.

475
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,400
Nora, would you find us
a seat, please?

476
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,240
Thank you.

477
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,600
We really gotta come up with a plan,

478
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,680
besides taking Mallus
to a coffee franchise.

479
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,760
Anything's better than
that insane asylum.

480
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,960
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

481
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,680
No, no, no, you are making
a serious mistake.

482
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,440
I am not insane! I promise!

483
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,760
Miss, you don't know
what you're doing.

484
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,120
I performed thousands
of transorbital lobotomies.

485
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,120
After we've finished,
your disease will be cured.

486
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,600
- Who are you?
- We're also from the future.

487
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,720
And spoiler alert,
you don't age well.

488
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,840
They found the note.

489
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,680
And we need to find
another way out of here.

490
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,480
Okay, the symbol that Nora drew
was a time travel spell, right?

491
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,800
So why don't we just cast

492
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,960
the same spell and get out of here?

493
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,200
She was channeling
the power of Mallus

494
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,640
when she cast that spell.
Not even I have that kind of juice.

495
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,720
I do.

496
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,600
You said that Mallus can use me
the way that he does Nora.

497
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,200
So you summon Mallus into me,
I draw the rune,

498
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,800
same as her,
and we get to go home.

499
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,880
And what about when
the demon is inside you, eh?

500
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,320
You said I was strong enough
to hold my own self.

501
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,720
Yeah, well, I was trying
to seduce you.

502
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,920
Oh, please. I was seducing you.

503
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,320
I hope no one was trying
to seduce anyone

504
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,600
while I was about to be lobotomized.

505
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,320
You know, this is why
I like to work alone.

506
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,960
- Okay.
- Oh, okay.

507
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,400
It's a musical.

508
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,320
- Oh, this is an easy one.
- Oh, no, no, no.

509
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,680
Not this again.
Ray, please don't sing.

510
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,960
Please, please don't sing.

511
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,360
<i>Oh, what a beautiful morning</i>

512
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,920
<i>Oh, what a beautiful day</i>

513
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,080
<i>I've got a beautiful feeling</i>

514
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,480
<i>- Everything's going my way.</i>
- That's, I can't.

515
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,760
You guys know this
is a state, too, right?

516
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,720
Yeah. Come on, my turn.

517
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,120
<i>We're live on News 52 with
the latest in the ongoing...</i>

518
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,240
What, what is it?

519
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,760
<i>Our city's beleaguered mayor,
Oliver Queen.</i>

520
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,360
<i>Mayor Queen is facing trial
for multiple murders</i>

521
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,920
<i>including that of
Damien Darhk two years ago,</i>

522
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,480
<i>following an attempt to destroy...</i>

523
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,360
- We should go.
- Yeah.

524
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,800
Hey, let's get out of here,
all right?

525
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,400
There's no place you can take me.

526
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,000
No place he won't find me.

527
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,520
- Hey.
- Nora.

528
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,520
Nora, we know you're still in there.

529
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,320
Hey, Nora, listen to us.

530
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,400
The girl is empty.

531
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,360
Long before you arrived,
she was mine!

532
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,680
You have to fight him, Nora.

533
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,600
She feels nothing.

534
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,240
She is nothing.

535
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,320
Okay, that's enough.

536
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,120
Everyone, get out!

537
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,560
Let her go.

538
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,440
Your fight's not with her.
It's with us.

539
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,800
There will be no fight.

540
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,880
We need backup. Nora's possessed.

541
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,600
Come on. Push back.

542
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,560
We're trying, but we need help.

543
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,520
Where's the defense?

544
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,560
That's what we're asking you for.

545
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,360
{\an5}Oh, tie game. Third and goal.

546
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,320
- Here.
- Thanks.

547
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,200
Have you seen Amaya?

548
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,760
She's talking to her
granddaughter-cicle.

549
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,680
Wait, what? You let her go in there?

550
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,000
- It's fourth and goal!
- Damn it, Mick!

551
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,000
What do you mean, you spoke
to one of our ancestors?

552
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,120
She came to me in a vision

553
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,880
and told me to protect
the new totem bearer.

554
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,880
I assumed she was talking about Zari,
but now I think she meant you.

555
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,560
You want to help me?

556
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
You're family.

557
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,600
- Get away from her.
- Put the gun down, Nathaniel.

558
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,040
And once you're under,
don't let the demon

559
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,480
coax you in any further.

560
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,240
You must outwill Mallus
and draw the temporal rune.

561
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,640
Are you sure you wanna do this, love?

562
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,840
You wanna stay here forever?

563
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,400
The ash of a slain phoenix
will hold Mallus

564
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,440
within his parameter.

565
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,760
And we'll hasten his wake up call

566
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,160
by combining extract of hawk weed

567
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,360
with the saliva of a damned man.

568
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,320
Which, sorry to say, love,
you'll have to ingest.

569
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,600
Let's summon this demon already.

570
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,640
All right.

571
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,400
Let him go.

572
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,440
<i>Ab intra, resurgemus daemonium!</i>

573
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,160
It's working.

574
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,320
Somebody out there?

575
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,080
What's going on? Why did she stop?

576
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,600
Come on, Sara. Finish it.

577
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,640
Nora?

578
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,600
He's possessing you, too.

579
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,360
I don't like what
I'm doing out there.

580
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,040
I don't wanna hurt them.

581
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,240
Hurt who?

582
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,040
Listen to me.

583
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,320
You are not Mallus.

584
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,760
You are not a demon.

585
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,840
You are Nora Darhk.

586
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,560
You think you can fool me?

587
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,240
You're one of the six.

588
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,400
I'm what?

589
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,920
No!

590
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,400
Look at me. It's not your fault.

591
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,000
But now you get to make a choice.

592
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,800
You don't have to give
into the darkness.

593
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,960
You can fight it.

594
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,800
Nora, I know,

595
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,360
because I fight it every day.

596
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,080
Can you do that, Nora?

597
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,440
Can you help me fight?

598
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,480
Hey, it's okay.

599
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,600
It's okay. Hey, it's over.

600
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,640
Anytime today would be good, love.

601
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,240
- Come on!
- We leaving?

602
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,800
- We leaving now?
- Grab an arm!

603
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,000
- Are we back?
- She bloody did it.

604
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,120
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

605
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,840
No, no, no, don't do this to me.

606
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,400
Sara, come on, Sara.
Come back to me.

607
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,640
Prove me wrong. Oh, no.

608
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,560
You...

609
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,600
You should really see
your face right now.

610
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Get up.

611
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,800
Kuasa, don't.

612
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,640
If you're gonna kill me,
pull the trigger.

613
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,320
At least you'll have done
something to change my fate.

614
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,440
He can help me save you.

615
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,160
So that I can go home.

616
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,880
Let him go.

617
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,200
You need him, too.

618
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,600
Don't disappoint me, Nana Baa.

619
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,640
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

620
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,680
Nora, look. We know that wasn't you.

621
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,120
You have to know that,
and you have to believe that, too.

622
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,080
Hey, we're gonna find you a home.

623
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,200
Somewhere where people
understand you.

624
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,960
Look no further.

625
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,120
I heard you guys were in town,
so I just had to stop by.

626
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,520
Daddy?

627
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,600
Hi, honey.

628
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,920
- Nora, don't.
- You're alive.

629
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,560
I missed you so much, Daddy.
Everyone's been so mean,

630
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,400
and every place
I've gone has been terrible,

631
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,840
- but they, they kept me safe.
- Your friends lied to you.

632
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,880
They're afraid of what you are.

633
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,160
You see, Mallus is no demon.

634
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
He's your savior.

635
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,400
Do you remember how he made you feel?

636
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,560
The power?

637
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,560
One day you'll use that power
to bring me back to you.

638
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,760
You just have to accept him.

639
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,480
Nora, look, I know it's hard,
but don't listen to him.

640
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,960
Look, you still have a chance

641
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,080
Come to me.

642
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,760
That's right, my darling.

643
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,040
Come to Daddy.

644
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,280
Now, we're gonna have to
part for a little while.

645
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,200
But I know someone who's
gonna give you a home.

646
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,720
A place where they
understand your power.

647
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,080
But

648
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,720
The Order and I will help you
work with Mallus

649
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,680
so that you can bring
your father back for good.

650
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,720
Come on.

651
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,600
I know.

652
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,000
Family reunions can really suck.

653
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,360
God.

654
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,400
How many times do I have
to tell you I'm fine?

655
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,640
Well, somehow you managed
to channel a demon

656
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,200
of the highest order,
and you didn't succumb.

657
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,400
Sara's strong.

658
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,240
She's the strongest person I know.

659
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,320
Hey, when Nora was
possessed by Mallus,

660
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,160
he seemed scared of my totem.

661
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,600
He said that I was "one of the six."

662
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,200
And that bastard doesn't fear much.

663
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,440
If your totem gave him the frights,

664
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,840
maybe these trinkets are
the keys to stopping him.

665
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,280
So much for our
anti-magic nanite gun.

666
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,840
I only know about five totems.

667
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,640
There's my Spirit, your Air,
Kuasa's Water.

668
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,360
And then there's Earth,
and there's Fire.

669
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,680
But could there be more?

670
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,840
I'll do some digging.

671
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,600
I have, numerous contacts
I can draw on.

672
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,880
Well, this has been, weird.
Even for me.

673
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,400
Well, I'll be on my way, then.

674
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,600
Hey, before you go...

675
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,080
I just wanted to say thank you.

676
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,760
For helping me with Mallus, that is.

677
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,800
Oh, of course.

678
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,760
Helping you with Mallus was
good for me, too.

679
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,560
If you ever need me to
help you with Mallus again,

680
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,240
just give us a call.
I'll be right there.

681
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,960
Although, there are lots of
people out there

682
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,240
with very weird demons,

683
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,600
and they all need my help.

684
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,840
I understand.

685
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,160
- Good.
- And thanks for the shag, too.

686
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,320
That was great.

687
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,040
Oh, Ray. Big man.

688
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,760
Do us a favor,...

689
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,600
give us a hand with
the cargo door, will you?

690
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,120
It's actually a pretty intuitive
design mechanism.

691
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,640
Basic open-close functionality.

692
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,640
I know how to open
the damn door, mate.

693
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,000
Now, what's this about
an anti-magic gun?

694
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,680
Oh, I was gonna put it in storage.

695
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,960
Well, don't.

696
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,320
You keep it nearby.

697
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
You said so yourself,

698
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,280
the key to stopping Mallus
are the totems.

699
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,880
It could be.

700
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,440
But in the meantime,
you may need a more

701
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,080
accessible solution for
a more familiar target.

702
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,840
Sara may not know it, but

703
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,080
the demon's power,
it lives inside of her.

704
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,640
If or more like when
she succumbs to it,

705
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,240
you're gonna need that gun.

706
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,400
<i>As always, this is
a non-smoking aircraft.</i>

707
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,840
Don't worry, Gideon, sweetheart.

708
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,840
I'll see you around, Squire.

709
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,960
That guy's cool.

710
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,680
<i>Of the highlights so far,
there was the interception by...</i>

711
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,240
Hello, friend.

712
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,240
Would you mind,
turning that off for a second?

713
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,480
Off.

714
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,160
Okay...

715
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,760
Just wanted to say I'm grateful.

716
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,920
Grateful I was allowed to tag
along with you and the Legends.

717
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,040
It was...

718
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,800
It was an experience, and,

719
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,600
- an education.
- Likewise.

720
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,200
I'm proud to know you, and...

721
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,800
This is hard.

722
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,840
This is me saying goodbye.

723
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,880
- Take care of yourself, Mick.
- You too.

724
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,760
You know he's still watching TV,
right?

725
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,400
I wasn't watching T...

726
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,440
Just a little bit.

727
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,280
On that note, Captain Lance.

728
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,640
I'm going home.

729
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,280
I'm gonna ask Ray to marry me.

730
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,640
- Ray?
- My Ray, not your Ray.

731
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,040
That is a bold move.

732
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,520
It is.

733
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,800
It just feels like it's time
to sign up for a...

734
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,360
Different kind of adventure?

735
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,400
A different kind of adventure,
exactly.

736
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,320
Snart, I mean, Leo.

737
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
See you around.

738
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,400
I'll see you around.

739
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,200
Gideon, can you get me
a line on Ava, please?

740
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,440
<i>Yes, Captain.</i>

741
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,440
<i>Would you like some privacy as well?</i>

742
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,560
Cheeky bot.

743
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,760
Captain Lance, I was
just about to call you.

744
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,160
Really? I mean, cool.

745
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,160
Because, I just wanted to
compare notes,

746
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,600
and I thought that maybe
if you'd like

747
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,520
- to come to the ship
- There's no time.

748
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,840
I finally got through
the bureau's red tape,

749
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,840
and it seems Director Hunter
has escaped.

750
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,120
What?

751
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,480
Well, where is he?

752
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,560
We have no idea.
