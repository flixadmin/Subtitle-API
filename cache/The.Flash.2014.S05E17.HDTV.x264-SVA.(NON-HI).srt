1
00:00:00,506 --> 00:00:02,023
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,099 --> 00:00:03,524
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:03,601 --> 00:00:05,476
To the outside world,

4
00:00:05,552 --> 00:00:06,977
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:07,054 --> 00:00:08,612
But secretly, with the help

6
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:10,481
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

7
00:00:10,491 --> 00:00:12,524
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

8
00:00:12,535 --> 00:00:14,860
But when my daughter came
back from the future to help,

9
00:00:14,871 --> 00:00:17,196
she changed the present...

10
00:00:17,206 --> 00:00:19,782
and now our world is
more dangerous than ever.

11
00:00:19,858 --> 00:00:22,201
And I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.

12
00:00:22,211 --> 00:00:25,546
I am the Flash.

13
00:00:25,623 --> 00:00:27,298
Previously on "The Flash"...

14
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,541
Who is your accomplice, Nora?

15
00:00:29,552 --> 00:00:31,877
The cure's finished, and it works.

16
00:00:31,888 --> 00:00:33,629
- What do you do?
- Trust me.

17
00:00:33,705 --> 00:00:35,225
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

18
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,340
We made an arrangement.

19
00:00:36,752 --> 00:00:38,385
We cure him and then Grace.

20
00:00:38,695 --> 00:00:41,867
That is a new timeline
struggling to break through.

21
00:00:41,914 --> 00:00:43,546
Something big is coming.

22
00:00:43,571 --> 00:00:44,571
What's going on?

23
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:48,600
Please!

24
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:51,633
If Cicada doesn't exist
anymore, who was that?

25
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:55,810
I've missed you, Uncle Orlin.

26
00:01:01,797 --> 00:01:03,312
Something went wrong.

27
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,350
We got Dwyer. We gave him the cure.

28
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:06,708
This should all be over.

29
00:01:06,784 --> 00:01:12,288
But another Cicada showed
up, took Dwyer and the dagger.

30
00:01:12,313 --> 00:01:14,321
Thawne! Did you hear what I said?

31
00:01:14,346 --> 00:01:16,962
- Another Cicada showed up.
- I know.

32
00:01:18,963 --> 00:01:21,130
I know.

33
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:25,843
- Who is that?
- I have no idea.

34
00:01:27,972 --> 00:01:31,682
You said manipulating the
timeline would stop Cicada.

35
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,559
You said you knew what you were doing!

36
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,353
I know what I said.

37
00:01:37,232 --> 00:01:38,481
I was very wrong.

38
00:01:40,577 --> 00:01:43,694
What do we do? What do we do now?

39
00:01:43,705 --> 00:01:46,322
I can't help you anymore...

40
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,949
little runner.

41
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,242
What?

42
00:01:49,252 --> 00:01:52,078
You have to help me.

43
00:01:54,758 --> 00:01:56,666
It's too late.

44
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,501
No.

45
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,336
There's gotta be something we can do.

46
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:03,089
You... you have to help!

47
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:05,716
There is only one thing left to do.

48
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,136
Tell your father.

49
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,851
You tell your father everything.

50
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,061
Your lung's healing.

51
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,791
It'll take a while for you to get

52
00:02:36,816 --> 00:02:38,191
the rest of your strength back,

53
00:02:38,267 --> 00:02:40,826
but don't worry.

54
00:02:40,903 --> 00:02:43,362
I'll take care of you.

55
00:02:43,438 --> 00:02:45,030
Like you took care of me.

56
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:49,877
Who are you?

57
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,595
Grace?

58
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:12,140
Hi, Uncle Orlin.

59
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:13,275
But you were...

60
00:03:13,352 --> 00:03:15,727
A ten-year-old girl in a coma?

61
00:03:15,804 --> 00:03:19,073
Eventually, that girl
at the hospital wakes up.

62
00:03:19,149 --> 00:03:21,108
She grows older,

63
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,360
and she becomes me.

64
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:27,948
You're from the future,
like Flash's daughter.

65
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,410
I came back here to work with you again.

66
00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:35,009
And I remember everything
you taught me, Uncle Orlin.

67
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,650
Now, get some rest.

68
00:03:40,662 --> 00:03:42,379
Wait.

69
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:45,632
Where are we?

70
00:03:47,044 --> 00:03:48,978
No one will find you while I'm gone.

71
00:03:49,054 --> 00:03:51,555
There's noodles in the
pantry if you're hungry.

72
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:52,973
And ice cream.

73
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:54,683
Where are you going?

74
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:05,068
To take care of something important.

75
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:06,870
When I get back...

76
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:12,576
We're gonna figure out how
you get your powers back.

77
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:25,964
And Dr. Ambres never talked
about her relationship

78
00:04:25,989 --> 00:04:27,238
with Orlin Dwyer?

79
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,064
She never really talked about anything.

80
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:31,473
After her fiancé died,
she wasn't quite the same.

81
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,430
How so?

82
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,724
Angry. Withdrawn.

83
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:36,861
Only time she seemed happy

84
00:04:36,886 --> 00:04:38,686
was when she was with
that girl in the coma.

85
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,656
Can you think of anything
that might help us find Dwyer?

86
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:43,578
I'm sorry, Detective.

87
00:04:46,946 --> 00:04:49,330
Okay, if you come up with anything,

88
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:51,666
would you give me a call, please?

89
00:04:51,677 --> 00:04:53,126
Thank you.

90
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:57,208
Somebody's gotta know something.

91
00:04:57,233 --> 00:04:59,913
Everyone we've talked
to is telling the truth.

92
00:04:59,929 --> 00:05:02,397
I think Ambres was the
only one working with Dwyer.

93
00:05:02,474 --> 00:05:04,566
Well, look, we'll pore
over the files at CCPD.

94
00:05:04,591 --> 00:05:06,225
Maybe we missed something.

95
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,531
We'll let you know if we come
up with anything, all right?

96
00:05:12,557 --> 00:05:14,240
You okay?

97
00:05:14,265 --> 00:05:16,766
I just, uh...

98
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:19,126
don't know what to do.

99
00:05:19,258 --> 00:05:21,016
Yeah, me neither.

100
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:24,051
We've hit walls before, though.

101
00:05:24,076 --> 00:05:26,034
We'll figure it out.

102
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,643
All right.

103
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:45,429
Nora West-Allen, let's
see what we have here.

104
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:47,859
Boring. Boring. Boring.

105
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:50,709
Banality. Boring. Boring.

106
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:52,975
Come on.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,761
I know you're working
with someone, but no names.

108
00:05:58,863 --> 00:06:00,121
Clever girl.

109
00:06:00,198 --> 00:06:01,831
Hey.

110
00:06:01,842 --> 00:06:03,482
Cortex isn't gonna
clean itself, you know.

111
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,090
Oh, nice table. Liking the new digs.

112
00:06:11,115 --> 00:06:12,755
Well, technically, they're old digs,

113
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,388
but I guess there is an upside
to remodeling after an attack.

114
00:06:16,413 --> 00:06:17,615
Did you guys find anything?

115
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,961
Well, I put out an article, but
none of my readers have seen Dwyer

116
00:06:19,985 --> 00:06:21,100
or this new Cicada.

117
00:06:21,124 --> 00:06:23,662
I talked to Earl Cox, all
my contacts... nothing.

118
00:06:23,687 --> 00:06:25,697
How long till the satellite
can scan for dark matter?

119
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:26,721
How about now?

120
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,884
Well, if this new Cicada

121
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:30,575
even has traceable dark matter.

122
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,922
I mean, we've seen Cicada
numéro deux do things

123
00:06:32,947 --> 00:06:34,271
that we've not seen before, right?

124
00:06:34,282 --> 00:06:35,948
Yeah, I mean, he can dampen powers,

125
00:06:36,025 --> 00:06:38,117
he can control the
dagger just like Dwyer,

126
00:06:38,142 --> 00:06:40,476
but it's... I don't
know, it's also like...

127
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,635
Like he could take control of us.

128
00:06:42,782 --> 00:06:45,151
Let's hope Caitlin can figure
that out at the Tannhauser site

129
00:06:45,175 --> 00:06:46,809
while we figure out where he is.

130
00:06:51,618 --> 00:06:53,945
We got a Starchives
asset in Kolins Woods.

131
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,109
Starchives? What is this?

132
00:06:55,134 --> 00:06:57,063
Well, it's a place where we house

133
00:06:57,088 --> 00:06:59,069
everything Flash related...
Prototypes, super suits...

134
00:06:59,093 --> 00:07:00,771
I mean, everything since day one.

135
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,441
Okay, and the alarm
is going off because...

136
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:05,484
Because somebody just
stole something from us.

137
00:07:05,906 --> 00:07:09,666
Something really, really, not good.

138
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:16,864
You guys at the Starchives yet?

139
00:07:16,874 --> 00:07:18,291
We just got here.

140
00:07:18,325 --> 00:07:19,953
No sign of forced entry.

141
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:21,574
Or overhead lighting, apparently.

142
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:23,996
Pretty sure that's a vacuum.

143
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:26,373
Okay, keep looking!

144
00:07:26,508 --> 00:07:28,499
Remind me again what we're looking for?

145
00:07:28,524 --> 00:07:34,056
Uh, it's like a huge round glass bubble.

146
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:36,008
You mean like that?

147
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:40,637
- Yeah...
- We found it!

148
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,667
Thawne's Time Sphere? Are you sure?

149
00:07:42,692 --> 00:07:44,358
What do you mean "Am I sure?"

150
00:07:44,435 --> 00:07:46,602
- Pretty sure.
- I'm looking right at it, why?

151
00:07:49,106 --> 00:07:51,315
'Cause we're looking right at it too.

152
00:07:55,947 --> 00:07:58,706
So it's here and in the Starchives

153
00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:00,608
at the same time?

154
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,528
Somebody stole the plans
and made a duplicate?

155
00:08:02,576 --> 00:08:04,200
Not exactly.

156
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:08,246
Guys, cue up Operation Shazam.

157
00:08:10,305 --> 00:08:11,333
Ready.

158
00:08:17,683 --> 00:08:20,508
One scratch on two
different Time Spheres.

159
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,969
Or one scratch on one Time Sphere.

160
00:08:22,994 --> 00:08:26,214
That's impossible... unless...

161
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,372
Unless it's the same one.

162
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,499
It is the same one.

163
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,209
This is our Time Sphere.

164
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,169
Which shows up here at the same time

165
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:36,172
that someone who looks like
Cicada kidnaps Orlin Dwyer.

166
00:08:36,197 --> 00:08:37,955
It's not a coincidence.

167
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,226
So whoever kidnapped Dwyer...

168
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:41,084
Is the Cicada from the future.

169
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,009
You move, I shoot.

170
00:09:36,267 --> 00:09:38,735
That was dumb.

171
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:05,555
It was him, wasn't it?

172
00:10:05,631 --> 00:10:06,722
The other Cicada.

173
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,891
Guy didn't know what hit him.

174
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,618
You said he was after a cold case file?

175
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,452
- Are any of them digitized?
- Not yet.

176
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,064
But the only way to
figure out what's missing

177
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:17,117
is to see what's still here.

178
00:10:17,193 --> 00:10:18,568
I mean...

179
00:10:18,644 --> 00:10:21,737
I could help with that.

180
00:10:21,814 --> 00:10:23,739
All right, everybody. Clear out.

181
00:10:23,764 --> 00:10:25,022
CSI needs this scene.

182
00:10:27,653 --> 00:10:28,744
Hey, by the way,

183
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:30,277
this might not be our only lead.

184
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,340
Do you remember that Time Sphere

185
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:33,675
that we built for Thawne?

186
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:35,501
That big hamster ball thing?

187
00:10:35,512 --> 00:10:38,171
Someone stole one in
the future to come here.

188
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:40,965
For what, our... our Cicada copycat?

189
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:43,092
It makes sense.

190
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:45,728
I can't even believe I just said that.

191
00:10:45,753 --> 00:10:46,781
Okay, son, you're on.

192
00:10:46,806 --> 00:10:47,814
Yup.

193
00:10:50,257 --> 00:10:51,536
Okay, I went through everything.

194
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,810
There was indeed one file missing.

195
00:10:54,531 --> 00:10:59,551
And it's... thank
you... it is from 2017.

196
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,738
That's it.

197
00:11:00,763 --> 00:11:01,941
All right, I'll do some digging,

198
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:03,217
see why this was so important,

199
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:04,792
they had to cut a hole in the wall.

200
00:11:04,968 --> 00:11:06,976
- I'll help.
- Yeah.

201
00:11:12,433 --> 00:11:14,159
Are you sure you want to do this?

202
00:11:14,236 --> 00:11:16,736
I mean, this is a big deal.

203
00:11:16,813 --> 00:11:20,448
Like, "not Penny's
boat" kind of big deal.

204
00:11:24,254 --> 00:11:26,746
Okay.

205
00:11:26,823 --> 00:11:30,166
Kamilla Hwang, you
and I are officially...

206
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:32,629
"In a Relationship."

207
00:11:32,654 --> 00:11:34,699
- Social media official!
- What!

208
00:11:34,724 --> 00:11:36,306
Yeah.

209
00:11:36,383 --> 00:11:37,849
Larry, my usual.

210
00:11:37,926 --> 00:11:40,051
It's Jason.

211
00:11:40,128 --> 00:11:42,971
Ralph! What's, um...

212
00:11:43,047 --> 00:11:44,305
What are you doing here?

213
00:11:44,382 --> 00:11:46,111
Same as you... taking a break

214
00:11:46,136 --> 00:11:47,377
from saving the old world.

215
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:49,462
- Um...
- Look at you two.

216
00:11:49,473 --> 00:11:51,589
Young love.

217
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:54,175
So, uh, K-Dawg, when
you gonna meet the group?

218
00:11:54,252 --> 00:11:55,841
Uh, the group?

219
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:58,441
Yeah, the squad, the team. The gang.

220
00:11:58,466 --> 00:12:00,708
Uh, hey, we're actually in
the middle of a date here.

221
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:02,413
Actually, we're at the
end of a date, babe.

222
00:12:02,652 --> 00:12:04,526
- I have that gig.
- Oh, right.

223
00:12:04,551 --> 00:12:05,823
Your Easter thing. You have to go.

224
00:12:05,847 --> 00:12:07,781
- She has to go.
- Oh, uh, Cisco?

225
00:12:07,858 --> 00:12:10,325
I'm supposed to tell you that
Barry wanted to talk to you.

226
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:13,778
Probably could've texted that.

227
00:12:13,855 --> 00:12:15,613
Yeah, probably.

228
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,508
Okay, well, Easter Bunny photos
aren't gonna take themselves.

229
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:21,649
It's kind of a bottom-of-the-barrel
photography gig,

230
00:12:21,688 --> 00:12:22,998
but gotta start somewhere, right?

231
00:12:23,022 --> 00:12:24,172
- Totally.
- Anywhere but here.

232
00:12:24,196 --> 00:12:26,574
- Why don't I walk you out?
- Oh, okay.

233
00:12:38,563 --> 00:12:39,682
Damn it, Larry!

234
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,173
Still Jason!

235
00:12:46,003 --> 00:12:48,846
Voilà, voilà, voilà.

236
00:12:48,857 --> 00:12:51,024
Let's see what we have here.

237
00:12:53,302 --> 00:12:55,028
Thawne's Time Sphere.

238
00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:58,198
What are you doing, Sherloque?

239
00:12:59,368 --> 00:13:02,448
Well, I'm pursuing a new lead

240
00:13:02,473 --> 00:13:04,473
to identify the mystery Cicada.

241
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,327
Well, if you needed information

242
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,163
about the Time Sphere,
you could've just asked.

243
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:11,655
That's right, but
memory can be deceiving.

244
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,817
Especially for a regular human.

245
00:13:14,842 --> 00:13:18,785
No, I prefer a primary source.

246
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,143
And this new lead, were you
pursuing it last night too?

247
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,660
- That's right.
- And all last weekend?

248
00:13:24,685 --> 00:13:30,683
That's right. I am working very
hard to get... to get what I want.

249
00:13:48,609 --> 00:13:51,160
Joe traced the file
that our new Cicada took.

250
00:13:51,185 --> 00:13:52,869
There was a meta attack
here two years ago.

251
00:13:52,894 --> 00:13:55,061
Two people died, and
the meta was never ID'd.

252
00:13:55,086 --> 00:13:57,262
So this new Cicada might
be going after this meta?

253
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,192
- Well...
- Okay. What do I vibe?

254
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:02,254
Well, we're not exactly sure.

255
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,439
All the street cameras were
destroyed by the explosion.

256
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,886
The original ATM was too
fried to recover any data.

257
00:14:07,896 --> 00:14:09,721
- For real?
- Yeah.

258
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:11,347
Well, I'm out.

259
00:14:11,424 --> 00:14:14,368
I can't vibe a crime
scene that does not exist.

260
00:14:14,393 --> 00:14:15,899
Literally does not exist.

261
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:19,365
I mean, even this ATM is,
like, brand-spanking-new.

262
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,742
But this concrete isn't.

263
00:14:21,818 --> 00:14:23,243
It still has scorch marks on it.

264
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,778
Hold this.

265
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:36,915
Sweetie! You forgot your ATM card.

266
00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:47,601
What'd you see?

267
00:14:47,677 --> 00:14:49,344
The victims.

268
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:53,223
They were Grace Gibbons' parents.

269
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,104
In Grace's mindscape,
she saw herself as Cicada.

270
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:02,565
And another Cicada shows up
targeting her parents' killer.

271
00:15:02,642 --> 00:15:03,900
It has to be her.

272
00:15:03,977 --> 00:15:06,444
The new Cicada is Grace Gibbons.

273
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:07,621
From the future.

274
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:12,534
Time travel sucks.

275
00:15:23,247 --> 00:15:24,497
Grace, what's wrong?

276
00:15:27,834 --> 00:15:29,300
Look at this.

277
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:35,473
It's your parents' murder file?

278
00:15:35,484 --> 00:15:38,226
Do you see what they did?

279
00:15:38,303 --> 00:15:39,310
Nothing!

280
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:41,257
Three witnesses saw a woman

281
00:15:41,282 --> 00:15:43,640
in a hoodie leave the scene,
but did Central City's finest

282
00:15:43,665 --> 00:15:45,948
put out a search party or an APB?

283
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:49,321
No. They thought it sounded
like a job for the Flash.

284
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,493
Look at this debris from the scene.

285
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,830
Looks like a chemical burn.

286
00:15:57,906 --> 00:16:00,416
It's not a chemical burn.

287
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:04,169
It's charred dark matter residue.

288
00:16:04,246 --> 00:16:06,538
We can track the meta who left it.

289
00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:08,498
How?

290
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,585
I can't track an exact
real time location,

291
00:16:11,661 --> 00:16:12,919
but I can get close.

292
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,684
Found her.

293
00:16:23,057 --> 00:16:27,434
Grace, what are you doing?

294
00:16:27,511 --> 00:16:29,686
In the time I'm from,
their plague spreads

295
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,814
across the world, unchecked, unabated.

296
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,317
But now that I'm here with you,

297
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,527
we can change that.

298
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,946
And the mission can succeed.

299
00:16:40,023 --> 00:16:41,615
What mission?

300
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:43,241
Ours.

301
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:45,702
To kill every last meta-human.

302
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:50,181
Starting with the rat
bastard who killed my parents.

303
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,807
So, Cicada II is really
Grace from the future,

304
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:07,734
and she's trying to
get revenge on the meta

305
00:17:07,811 --> 00:17:10,237
that murdered her parents
and that killer meta is here?

306
00:17:10,314 --> 00:17:13,231
Cisco saw the last PIN that
was entered into the ATM.

307
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,727
The card belongs to
Vickie and John Bolen.

308
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:16,845
We already went by their house,

309
00:17:16,846 --> 00:17:18,596
and a neighbor said they
were having a party here.

310
00:17:18,607 --> 00:17:20,264
Um, I think this is them.

311
00:17:20,341 --> 00:17:21,974
Excuse me, sir?

312
00:17:22,051 --> 00:17:24,444
Detective Joe West, we're from CCPD.

313
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,771
Are you Mr. John Bolen?

314
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:28,439
I am. How can I help you?

315
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,492
What's going on? Oh.

316
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:30,900
Sorry to be rude,

317
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,128
but we're in the middle of a party.

318
00:17:32,137 --> 00:17:34,313
This won't take long. Um...

319
00:17:34,324 --> 00:17:37,900
Do you remember using an
ATM on Kingswell and 42nd

320
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:40,487
around May 4th, 2017?

321
00:17:40,585 --> 00:17:42,243
There was an explosion that day.

322
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,912
We think a meta-human
might have been involved.

323
00:17:44,923 --> 00:17:46,747
Hon, why don't you and
Alice start gathering

324
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:48,040
the kids for a team photo?

325
00:17:48,065 --> 00:17:51,533
I'll talk to the nice officers.

326
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:53,262
Okay.

327
00:17:55,182 --> 00:17:56,985
I can't believe you found
me after all this time.

328
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,936
We'd just like to know
what happened that day.

329
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,679
Did you blow up that ATM?

330
00:18:01,755 --> 00:18:03,439
It - it all happened so fast.

331
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,015
I touched the machine,

332
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:07,101
and it was like
something turned on in me.

333
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:09,853
You hyper-accelerated
the molecules in the ATM,

334
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,054
causing a violent chain reaction.

335
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:14,088
I just know I saw sparks and ran.

336
00:18:14,324 --> 00:18:15,532
Then I heard this explosion

337
00:18:15,557 --> 00:18:17,336
and money was flying everywhere.

338
00:18:17,361 --> 00:18:19,337
It looked like I was
trying to rob the bank.

339
00:18:19,362 --> 00:18:22,046
I was too afraid to go back.

340
00:18:22,071 --> 00:18:23,413
At least no one got hurt.

341
00:18:25,463 --> 00:18:28,130
Mrs. Bolen, we have reason to believe

342
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:30,207
a killer is targeting you.

343
00:18:30,232 --> 00:18:31,311
Why?

344
00:18:31,336 --> 00:18:34,499
It's because of your... abilities.

345
00:18:34,524 --> 00:18:37,358
Listen, we'd like to put
you in federal protection

346
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:38,757
to keep your family safe.

347
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:40,309
And what would I tell my husband?

348
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:41,625
Or my daughter?

349
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,116
"Hey, sorry, Mommy has powers."

350
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:44,661
We all have to leave our lives behind.

351
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:47,433
They don't know about your powers?

352
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,434
Of course not. No one does.

353
00:18:49,459 --> 00:18:51,083
You think I'm proud of this?

354
00:18:51,192 --> 00:18:52,794
I think they have a
right to know the truth.

355
00:18:52,818 --> 00:18:53,992
They're your family.

356
00:18:55,758 --> 00:18:57,194
And who the hell do you think you are,

357
00:18:57,218 --> 00:18:58,309
telling me what to do?

358
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,571
We're not going anywhere.

359
00:19:00,596 --> 00:19:02,614
That's final.

360
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:03,888
Please leave.

361
00:19:07,028 --> 00:19:10,622
She's not safe. We're staying put.

362
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,504
I got your text. What's the emergency?

363
00:19:17,515 --> 00:19:19,340
Okay. Listen to me very carefully.

364
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,092
I took a break from serial
killer kidnapper madness

365
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:24,353
to do something awesome.

366
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,513
So I decided on a new career path.

367
00:19:26,524 --> 00:19:28,098
Photography was always my passion,

368
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:29,486
and I figured why not make it my job?

369
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,976
These are great, Kamilla.

370
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:32,853
I Peter Parker'd her.

371
00:19:32,864 --> 00:19:34,355
Dibs, sidebar.

372
00:19:34,365 --> 00:19:35,401
Sidebar?

373
00:19:35,426 --> 00:19:36,902
Sidebar, now!

374
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:43,280
You have, uh... Peter Parker'd her.

375
00:19:43,357 --> 00:19:45,824
Yeah, I mean, Kamilla
is a great photographer

376
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:48,377
and I thought she could start
taking some pictures for Iris,

377
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,537
and then maybe she'd start
to come around S.T.A.R. Labs.

378
00:19:50,548 --> 00:19:53,524
I don't know, if we're lucky, get
bitten by something radioactive.

379
00:19:53,556 --> 00:19:54,774
Become, like, a Spider-Person.

380
00:19:54,782 --> 00:19:57,656
So, while you thought,
did it occur to you

381
00:19:57,681 --> 00:20:00,199
that no one asked you to do this?

382
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,229
You don't think she'd
make a good Spider-Person?

383
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:08,296
You listen to me and you listen
good, you turkey on stilts.

384
00:20:08,321 --> 00:20:09,954
It is not your job

385
00:20:09,965 --> 00:20:12,623
to get my girlfriend on the team!

386
00:20:12,634 --> 00:20:15,126
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, you two!

387
00:20:15,136 --> 00:20:17,128
You guys are getting
along in there, I see that.

388
00:20:17,138 --> 00:20:18,758
What's going on?

389
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:20,187
Your friend Iris was actually

390
00:20:20,212 --> 00:20:21,695
just giving me a photography gig.

391
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,987
Well, it's small, but
Kamilla has agreed to shoot

392
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:27,938
the Fairway parade for
the "Citizen" this weekend.

393
00:20:28,174 --> 00:20:30,099
Shut the front door.

394
00:20:30,176 --> 00:20:32,977
That is unbelievable.

395
00:20:32,988 --> 00:20:34,812
Congrats. That's amazing.

396
00:20:34,823 --> 00:20:37,315
Hey, why don't you and I
go, uh, drink and celebrate?

397
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:39,608
Oh, sure. Um, I will text you later.

398
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:41,046
Yes, that sounds great. Thank you.

399
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,695
- You ready?
- Yeah.

400
00:20:46,317 --> 00:20:49,076
Well, well, well.

401
00:20:49,153 --> 00:20:53,497
Bonjour, Eobard Thawne.

402
00:20:53,508 --> 00:20:56,000
If I am Eobard Thawne,

403
00:20:56,011 --> 00:20:59,331
what kind of man am I?

404
00:20:59,356 --> 00:21:01,448
Patient, right?

405
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:03,924
Master of Science.

406
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:06,144
But also...

407
00:21:08,695 --> 00:21:10,653
A master of...

408
00:21:13,344 --> 00:21:14,769
Subterfuge.

409
00:21:14,845 --> 00:21:18,314
Because not only...

410
00:21:18,391 --> 00:21:20,033
am I...

411
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:22,318
Eobard Thawne,

412
00:21:22,395 --> 00:21:25,872
but I'm also...

413
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:31,202
Dr. Harrison Wells.

414
00:21:32,696 --> 00:21:35,548
And that man...

415
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:39,001
that man would keep his secrets...

416
00:21:42,223 --> 00:21:43,798
...close.

417
00:21:45,196 --> 00:21:47,204
What have we here?

418
00:21:50,714 --> 00:21:53,232
Well, well, well.

419
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:56,143
Bonjour.

420
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,480
How could Vickie not know
she killed two people?

421
00:21:59,557 --> 00:22:01,532
There was a time in Central City

422
00:22:01,557 --> 00:22:03,795
where not all meta attacks
were public knowledge.

423
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,736
Why not? I mean, people should know...

424
00:22:05,747 --> 00:22:07,624
Former Mayor Bellows...

425
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:10,060
...tried to keep certain
things out of the media.

426
00:22:10,085 --> 00:22:12,201
Said he didn't want to create a panic.

427
00:22:12,278 --> 00:22:14,412
Turns out he had metas on the payroll.

428
00:22:14,422 --> 00:22:15,755
Didn't want the heat.

429
00:22:15,832 --> 00:22:17,373
That's Cecile. I'll be right back.

430
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,541
Hey.

431
00:22:22,496 --> 00:22:23,838
You were wrong, you know.

432
00:22:23,914 --> 00:22:25,256
About what?

433
00:22:25,332 --> 00:22:26,924
About Vickie not wanting
to tell her family

434
00:22:26,935 --> 00:22:28,509
about her abilities.

435
00:22:28,586 --> 00:22:30,010
It's her choice not to tell them.

436
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:33,681
Look, keeping a secret like that

437
00:22:33,757 --> 00:22:36,109
from her family is... It's dangerous.

438
00:22:36,185 --> 00:22:38,444
I mean, they might get hurt or worse.

439
00:22:38,521 --> 00:22:40,104
She's just trying to protect them.

440
00:22:40,181 --> 00:22:43,691
I get that, I do, but...

441
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:46,452
I-I used to think that
keeping secrets from people

442
00:22:46,529 --> 00:22:48,946
for their own good was a noble decision,

443
00:22:48,957 --> 00:22:51,020
that it would protect them.

444
00:22:51,045 --> 00:22:53,253
But when you do that,
you just rob those people

445
00:22:53,277 --> 00:22:55,753
from making their own decisions.

446
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,914
I even did it with you.

447
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:00,853
Like when you didn't want
to take me to your past.

448
00:23:00,877 --> 00:23:02,543
Mm-hmm.

449
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,930
I didn't want you to see how painful

450
00:23:03,954 --> 00:23:05,296
things got for me as the Flash

451
00:23:05,306 --> 00:23:08,090
or how bad things got for your mom.

452
00:23:08,115 --> 00:23:11,708
But secrets are like walls, and...

453
00:23:11,837 --> 00:23:13,917
you can't really know someone
with walls between you.

454
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:18,067
Ah!

455
00:23:18,144 --> 00:23:20,144
Hey!

456
00:23:25,528 --> 00:23:27,269
Hey. Are you okay?

457
00:23:27,294 --> 00:23:29,995
I must have connected to Grace's mind.

458
00:23:30,523 --> 00:23:31,780
She's coming.

459
00:23:31,857 --> 00:23:33,157
Grace is coming.

460
00:23:36,065 --> 00:23:37,585
I don't see Cicada anywhere. Do you?

461
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,534
It's the Flash!

462
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:43,538
Mom, you got Flash and XS
cosplayers for the party?

463
00:23:43,614 --> 00:23:48,584
Yes, I am the Flash! And I love...

464
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,224
Soccer, do you guys love soccer?

465
00:23:51,287 --> 00:23:53,060
Do you want to... Yeah, or... awesome!

466
00:23:53,085 --> 00:23:55,474
Come with me! Here, let's
play some soccer over here.

467
00:23:55,498 --> 00:23:57,267
This way. This way. Come
on, come on, come on.

468
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:59,246
Help me with the kids. Come on, come on!

469
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,802
Far away from there.

470
00:24:00,827 --> 00:24:02,850
- What's going on?
- Cicada is coming here.

471
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,491
- What?
- Now.

472
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,117
We can move everyone else out of here,

473
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,954
but you and your family
have to come with me.

474
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,171
All right.

475
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:20,361
- Murderer.
- Grace, stop.

476
00:24:20,386 --> 00:24:22,056
She's innocent. It was an accident.

477
00:24:22,177 --> 00:24:24,553
There are no accidents, Nora.

478
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,810
Vickie?

479
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,813
- We have to help Mom.
- Alice!

480
00:24:37,273 --> 00:24:38,906
Alice, no!

481
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:47,659
Alice!

482
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,869
My speed's back.

483
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,380
We need to get them out of here.

484
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:03,183
I'll find you.

485
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:08,765
I can't believe

486
00:25:08,776 --> 00:25:10,217
that little girl in there

487
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:13,052
grows up to be a
time-traveling serial killer.

488
00:25:13,355 --> 00:25:15,438
Why can't we just wake her up right now?

489
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:17,542
We tried before. It didn't work.

490
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:19,456
What about the meta
cure y'all cooked up?

491
00:25:19,481 --> 00:25:21,115
We'd need Grace's consent.

492
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:23,558
Besides, Caitlin says that her condition

493
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:24,949
is too fragile to even try.

494
00:25:24,974 --> 00:25:26,825
And I'm assuming that destroying

495
00:25:26,835 --> 00:25:28,753
the time-traveling hamster ball,

496
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:30,295
that messes up the timeline?

497
00:25:30,372 --> 00:25:32,747
Yeah, it would probably
just make things even worse.

498
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:34,457
- Oh, God!
- Whoa, what's wrong?

499
00:25:34,468 --> 00:25:35,945
Her mind.

500
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:38,914
It's exactly the same as the Cicada
that attacked us at S.T.A.R. Labs.

501
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:42,783
Oh, my God, it's filled
with nothing but hatred.

502
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:45,760
Nora found out when she
went into Grace's mind

503
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:48,814
that Grace could hear
Dwyer, even in her coma...

504
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,307
His anger, his rage.

505
00:25:51,318 --> 00:25:52,934
She was listening.

506
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:54,435
She can carry out his words.

507
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:56,229
Uh, hey, guys.

508
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,387
Uh, Alice is back from
the OR and she's okay,

509
00:25:58,412 --> 00:26:00,800
but her parents are really not.

510
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:03,743
Vickie, I asked you to leave!

511
00:26:04,164 --> 00:26:05,655
She's my daughter.

512
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:08,741
No. I want my dad.

513
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:10,399
Can't you see that
she's terrified of you?

514
00:26:10,423 --> 00:26:11,461
She could've been killed!

515
00:26:11,477 --> 00:26:12,985
I was trying to protect you guys.

516
00:26:13,062 --> 00:26:15,565
By lying? You're a meta, Vickie!

517
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,016
A human time bomb! How
do you keep that from us?

518
00:26:18,093 --> 00:26:20,519
Mr. Bolen... let's take a breath.

519
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:22,104
Let's step outside.

520
00:26:36,537 --> 00:26:38,796
Hey, we did the right thing.

521
00:26:38,872 --> 00:26:41,206
We kept this family safe.

522
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:42,541
Then why does it feel like

523
00:26:42,566 --> 00:26:46,035
we made everything so much worse?

524
00:27:01,061 --> 00:27:03,478
- Need any help with that, uh...
- Nope.

525
00:27:03,503 --> 00:27:05,103
Unless you came here to break something,

526
00:27:05,128 --> 00:27:08,597
in which case you'd be
the perfect candidate.

527
00:27:12,981 --> 00:27:14,406
I deserve that.

528
00:27:14,482 --> 00:27:17,835
Never should've interfered with Kamilla.

529
00:27:17,911 --> 00:27:20,495
Sometimes, I forget how...

530
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:22,706
embarrassing I can be.

531
00:27:22,716 --> 00:27:25,322
I'm not embarrassed by
you, and I'm not embarrassed

532
00:27:25,347 --> 00:27:26,644
by anyone on Team Flash.

533
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:28,520
You guys are my family.
You're not the problem.

534
00:27:28,545 --> 00:27:32,214
This is the problem.
This is the problem.

535
00:27:34,562 --> 00:27:38,188
Kamilla is blissfully unaware

536
00:27:38,265 --> 00:27:41,266
of any of the madness that
goes on in S.T.A.R. Labs,

537
00:27:41,343 --> 00:27:44,695
or that we routinely save
the city from evil metas.

538
00:27:44,771 --> 00:27:46,364
Or that you have a secret identity

539
00:27:46,389 --> 00:27:49,691
and dress up in leather
and go all pew-pew!

540
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:52,202
Especially the leather.

541
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:54,413
She and I, we got a good thing.

542
00:27:54,489 --> 00:27:58,876
And being with somebody
has never felt so...

543
00:27:58,952 --> 00:28:00,744
so easy.

544
00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:02,338
And when I'm with her, for once,

545
00:28:02,363 --> 00:28:05,040
I just feel like a normal dude,

546
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,541
with a normal life

547
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:09,002
and a social-media-official
girlfriend,

548
00:28:09,027 --> 00:28:12,095
who happens to be a very
talented photographer

549
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,866
and not... a Spider-Person.

550
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:24,559
It's... that's amazing,
man. It really is.

551
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,896
And I promise that I will respect that.

552
00:28:29,724 --> 00:28:31,742
But I gotta ask, how long do you think

553
00:28:31,818 --> 00:28:35,403
you can keep those two worlds separate?

554
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:38,490
Look... my mom dated this guy, Craig,

555
00:28:38,566 --> 00:28:42,118
and Craig was a tax accountant
and a freelance bull rider.

556
00:28:42,195 --> 00:28:43,921
Never let one world
know about the other,

557
00:28:43,997 --> 00:28:46,873
and... it just tore him up.

558
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,625
More than those bulls ever did.

559
00:28:48,702 --> 00:28:51,014
Mm. I should definitely be working.

560
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,428
Look, the thing is, I
get why you're afraid

561
00:28:53,456 --> 00:28:55,265
of losing what you have with Kamilla,

562
00:28:55,342 --> 00:28:58,551
but if you keep her out of this world...

563
00:28:58,628 --> 00:29:00,105
it seems to me that you're always

564
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:03,607
gonna be turning off a part of yourself.

565
00:29:03,684 --> 00:29:05,684
That's not right.

566
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,102
And if Craig hadn't
been crushed to death

567
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:10,021
by that huge filing cabinet...

568
00:29:10,098 --> 00:29:12,190
I know he'd feel the same way.

569
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,584
I didn't get her.

570
00:29:35,498 --> 00:29:37,424
Well, maybe that's a good thing,

571
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,803
'cause I've read this file
and it doesn't make sense.

572
00:29:41,814 --> 00:29:46,558
Grace, there was no money
taken from the crime scene.

573
00:29:46,568 --> 00:29:49,148
I think what happened
to your mom and dad

574
00:29:49,173 --> 00:29:50,764
might've been an accident.

575
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,432
She killed my parents, Uncle Orlin!

576
00:29:53,734 --> 00:29:56,067
It wasn't an accident!

577
00:29:56,144 --> 00:29:58,403
You sound like them.

578
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,614
Why do you sound like them?

579
00:30:01,691 --> 00:30:03,491
Grace, your head.

580
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,327
We gotta get you to Dr. Ambres.

581
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:06,953
She'll know how to help.

582
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:10,540
She's not helping anyone. Not anymore.

583
00:30:10,617 --> 00:30:13,960
Why not?

584
00:30:14,037 --> 00:30:16,087
I killed her.

585
00:30:16,164 --> 00:30:18,423
But Dr. Ambres saved your life.

586
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,017
And destroyed yours.

587
00:30:20,093 --> 00:30:21,926
You had a gift.

588
00:30:22,003 --> 00:30:26,514
An unbreakable weapon that fell
from the sky for you to use.

589
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,767
For you to control.

590
00:30:28,843 --> 00:30:32,437
And she took that power away from you.

591
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,230
No, Grace.

592
00:30:34,241 --> 00:30:36,274
I wanted that cure.

593
00:30:36,351 --> 00:30:38,318
And I wanted you to have it too.

594
00:30:38,395 --> 00:30:42,322
No. No, that's impossible.

595
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,041
We were supposed to do this together.

596
00:30:44,117 --> 00:30:46,826
Grace, I just wanted you to be happy.

597
00:30:46,903 --> 00:30:50,630
That's all I ever wanted.

598
00:30:50,707 --> 00:30:53,541
I love you, Grace. You're my family.

599
00:30:56,889 --> 00:31:01,132
And you'd do anything to save me, right?

600
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,722
I know what I have to do.

601
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:09,224
Grace, stop.

602
00:31:12,312 --> 00:31:15,647
Grace, stop! Grace, please!

603
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:31,996
Good evening, Dr. Wells.

604
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:33,706
Bonjour, Gideon.

605
00:31:33,783 --> 00:31:39,087
I believe I have
something that belongs...

606
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:40,422
right here.

607
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:43,383
Video log, entry 247.

608
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,218
I have long struggled

609
00:31:45,295 --> 00:31:47,595
with time's insistence on change.

610
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:49,940
One variable changes the timeline.

611
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:53,268
Our memories are changed
too, without any knowledge

612
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:57,522
of time's other
possibilities, but not anymore.

613
00:31:57,599 --> 00:31:59,524
Where he is going with this?

614
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:02,235
Just as the human
body is made up of DNA,

615
00:32:02,312 --> 00:32:04,737
so, too, is the multiverse made up

616
00:32:04,814 --> 00:32:07,699
of its own unique source code.

617
00:32:07,775 --> 00:32:10,201
- Hmm.
- One that cannot be altered.

618
00:32:10,278 --> 00:32:11,744
No matter what timeline you're in.

619
00:32:11,821 --> 00:32:13,246
Until now,

620
00:32:13,323 --> 00:32:15,957
because I have cracked that code.

621
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:18,042
Oh.

622
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:20,545
And so the timeline,
it can be malleable,

623
00:32:20,622 --> 00:32:23,548
but my knowledge...

624
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:25,142
will be intractable.

625
00:32:25,218 --> 00:32:27,510
Gideon, freeze video log.

626
00:32:27,587 --> 00:32:29,762
Capture the clear board.

627
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:32,816
Run against handwriting
sample number two.

628
00:32:32,893 --> 00:32:36,436
The journal of Nora West-Allen.

629
00:32:37,727 --> 00:32:39,852
Analysis complete... Handwriting match

630
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:41,302
for Harrison Wells confirmed.

631
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:43,136
Will that be all, Dr. Wells?

632
00:32:44,237 --> 00:32:45,545
Yes, Gideon.

633
00:32:47,303 --> 00:32:48,861
That will be all.

634
00:32:52,374 --> 00:32:55,067
And that's why I didn't
tell you about my powers.

635
00:32:55,092 --> 00:32:57,627
I thought it would be too hard for you.

636
00:32:57,638 --> 00:33:00,371
But you're tough.

637
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:03,322
Tougher than I've ever been.

638
00:33:03,967 --> 00:33:07,404
So maybe you can be tough for me too?

639
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,601
They're a good family.

640
00:33:14,144 --> 00:33:16,278
Told you they'd figure it out.

641
00:33:18,829 --> 00:33:20,254
Dad...

642
00:33:22,262 --> 00:33:24,238
I need to tell you something.

643
00:33:25,028 --> 00:33:27,566
- Ah!
- Oh, baby, what's wrong?

644
00:33:27,857 --> 00:33:29,181
Grace's mind.

645
00:33:29,192 --> 00:33:31,567
Oh, it's getting so much stronger.

646
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,522
She's here.

647
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,509
Are you okay?

648
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:07,886
Vickie Bolen!

649
00:34:07,897 --> 00:34:10,389
Give yourself over to me,

650
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,400
or your husband dies.

651
00:34:12,476 --> 00:34:14,768
This Cicada doesn't care
if someone's a meta or not.

652
00:34:14,779 --> 00:34:16,478
She'll kill anyone
who stands in her way.

653
00:34:16,503 --> 00:34:17,636
XS, get her out of here

654
00:34:17,669 --> 00:34:18,841
before Cicada tries that again.

655
00:34:18,865 --> 00:34:20,207
Do not slow down.

656
00:34:20,223 --> 00:34:21,951
Detective, we need to
get her somewhere safe.

657
00:34:21,975 --> 00:34:23,592
- Mom?
- I'm not leaving without Alice.

658
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:25,456
You're the target, Mrs. Bolen.

659
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:26,614
She's safer without you.

660
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,273
Come on, now, let's go.

661
00:34:28,283 --> 00:34:30,325
Come on, sweetie, let's
get you somewhere safe.

662
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,527
XS, go!

663
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:43,438
- What do you got?
- Well, we have a situation.

664
00:34:43,462 --> 00:34:44,609
Or two, actually.

665
00:34:44,634 --> 00:34:46,249
So that's the new Cicada,

666
00:34:46,265 --> 00:34:48,891
and that's the dagger
chasing Nora and Ms. Bolen.

667
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:51,842
- Guys, I need help!
- Time to move.

668
00:34:51,867 --> 00:34:52,895
Grace.

669
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,936
Let him go.

670
00:34:57,131 --> 00:34:58,755
I know you want revenge for your parents

671
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,789
But it wasn't that woman's fault.

672
00:35:03,212 --> 00:35:06,020
That doesn't change that they're dead.

673
00:35:06,045 --> 00:35:07,927
Or that I became this.

674
00:35:07,952 --> 00:35:11,528
- We can help you.
- With your cure?

675
00:35:11,553 --> 00:35:15,906
There's only one cure for this, Flash.

676
00:35:15,931 --> 00:35:17,086
Death.

677
00:35:18,458 --> 00:35:19,797
Guys, I can't keep this up.

678
00:35:19,822 --> 00:35:21,673
Nora, you need to hang on
for a little bit longer.

679
00:35:21,697 --> 00:35:23,456
You're gonna turn on...
The alleyway on Fuller.

680
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,906
The alleyway on Fuller. Be ready.

681
00:35:24,931 --> 00:35:26,031
For what?

682
00:35:41,036 --> 00:35:43,295
- Ooh, I am not loving that.
- Nope.

683
00:35:47,066 --> 00:35:48,618
Guys, we need you two at the hospital.

684
00:35:48,642 --> 00:35:49,825
Let's go.

685
00:35:56,691 --> 00:35:58,545
- What the hell was that?
- Cisco, what happened?

686
00:35:58,569 --> 00:36:00,157
I don't know. Something's
wrong with my breach.

687
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:01,797
We can't get through it!

688
00:36:01,822 --> 00:36:04,401
I've always wanted to
be up against the Flash

689
00:36:04,426 --> 00:36:06,318
and his legendary team.

690
00:36:06,473 --> 00:36:10,058
I guess I wasn't missing
out on anything after all.

691
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:12,533
Grace!

692
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:15,460
Don't do this.

693
00:36:15,492 --> 00:36:17,208
Please.

694
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,826
This isn't the way to make
the world a better place.

695
00:36:19,851 --> 00:36:20,851
You hated them.

696
00:36:23,361 --> 00:36:24,985
I heard you.

697
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:27,344
I was wrong.

698
00:36:27,472 --> 00:36:31,709
And that hate turned
into something even worse.

699
00:36:31,734 --> 00:36:34,785
It was wrong to make you
feel that way, Gracie.

700
00:36:34,883 --> 00:36:38,000
But you don't have to go
down the same path I did.

701
00:36:38,025 --> 00:36:42,044
You don't have to hold
on to this... this anger.

702
00:36:44,456 --> 00:36:46,331
Let it go.

703
00:36:53,057 --> 00:36:54,923
But my parents.

704
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:56,925
It was an accident.

705
00:36:58,378 --> 00:37:00,888
Let it go.

706
00:37:00,964 --> 00:37:04,224
Before it's too late, like it is for me.

707
00:37:07,405 --> 00:37:09,738
You're right, Uncle Orlin.

708
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,859
Um...

709
00:37:15,437 --> 00:37:17,371
No!

710
00:37:21,985 --> 00:37:23,702
It is too late.

711
00:37:30,243 --> 00:37:32,669
Ah!

712
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:36,637
Hey, hey, hey.

713
00:37:39,937 --> 00:37:43,639
Save my Grace.

714
00:38:00,327 --> 00:38:01,884
I can't believe she killed Dwyer.

715
00:38:02,236 --> 00:38:03,994
Yeah, as brutal as Dwyer was,

716
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:05,381
his love for his niece always kept him

717
00:38:05,405 --> 00:38:06,525
from crossing certain lines.

718
00:38:06,573 --> 00:38:08,207
Not Grace.

719
00:38:08,217 --> 00:38:10,657
No, and her powers are
incredibly dangerous.

720
00:38:10,682 --> 00:38:12,983
I ran some tests while I was
at the Tannhauser offsite...

721
00:38:13,008 --> 00:38:15,392
Her dark matter has some
sort of binding quality.

722
00:38:15,683 --> 00:38:17,559
It allows her to
telekinetically manipulate

723
00:38:17,584 --> 00:38:20,219
dark matter within a certain proximity.

724
00:38:20,229 --> 00:38:21,604
Including the dark matter in us?

725
00:38:21,629 --> 00:38:22,778
I think so.

726
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:25,469
I think what makes her
powers different from Dwyer's

727
00:38:25,643 --> 00:38:27,559
is that they came from
a wound in her head.

728
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,180
That's why she's so much stronger.

729
00:38:29,205 --> 00:38:31,297
How was Nora able to see
what Grace was seeing?

730
00:38:31,322 --> 00:38:33,581
Nora and Grace seem to
be psychically connected.

731
00:38:33,606 --> 00:38:35,779
I think it's because of
the time that Nora spent

732
00:38:35,804 --> 00:38:37,187
in Grace's brain.

733
00:38:37,396 --> 00:38:39,738
- Is there any sign of her?
- No.

734
00:38:39,815 --> 00:38:41,408
She definitely ghosted.

735
00:38:41,433 --> 00:38:43,299
What about Vickie and her family?

736
00:38:43,327 --> 00:38:46,138
Uh, federal protection.
They're gonna be fine.

737
00:38:46,163 --> 00:38:48,756
They're getting new
identities as we speak.

738
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,051
I don't know about anyone else,

739
00:38:50,075 --> 00:38:51,592
but I could use a drink.

740
00:38:51,669 --> 00:38:53,752
- Not a bad idea.
- Yeah, I'm in.

741
00:38:53,763 --> 00:38:55,763
- You want me to call a sitter?
- Yeah.

742
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:58,090
Cisco, you want to bring Kamilla?

743
00:39:00,585 --> 00:39:02,094
Not for this one.

744
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,975
Nora, you coming?

745
00:39:07,985 --> 00:39:09,351
Nora.

746
00:39:10,762 --> 00:39:12,813
You want to tell us
something, don't you?

747
00:39:16,435 --> 00:39:20,195
She wants to tell you her secret.

748
00:39:20,272 --> 00:39:21,947
Right?

749
00:39:22,024 --> 00:39:24,625
She doesn't know where to start.

750
00:39:24,702 --> 00:39:27,369
Difficult to know where to begin

751
00:39:27,446 --> 00:39:32,800
when your secret threatens everything,

752
00:39:32,876 --> 00:39:33,959
everyone around you.

753
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,168
Sherloque, stop it.

754
00:39:35,193 --> 00:39:36,952
Maybe start at the beginning.

755
00:39:37,205 --> 00:39:38,349
It's a very good place to start.

756
00:39:38,373 --> 00:39:41,216
When you first time-traveled.

757
00:39:41,293 --> 00:39:45,304
So careful to leave
the lightest footprint.

758
00:39:45,314 --> 00:39:47,556
Until you suddenly change course

759
00:39:47,632 --> 00:39:50,434
and brazenly interfere
with the Thinker satellite

760
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,060
as it crashed to Earth.

761
00:39:52,137 --> 00:39:54,396
I think to myself, "Nope, nope."

762
00:39:54,473 --> 00:40:00,444
This excessive action
doesn't make sense."

763
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,822
Until you understand that...

764
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:05,532
it wasn't your idea.

765
00:40:07,903 --> 00:40:09,661
Please stop.

766
00:40:09,672 --> 00:40:11,246
Someone instructed you to do it.

767
00:40:11,323 --> 00:40:13,790
- Stop.
- Someone...

768
00:40:13,867 --> 00:40:17,169
whose handwriting is in your journal.

769
00:40:17,245 --> 00:40:21,506
Someone who wrote, "The
timeline is malleable."

770
00:40:21,517 --> 00:40:25,135
Same person who's been
directing you all this time,

771
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,629
making puppets of all of us

772
00:40:27,654 --> 00:40:29,603
as he seeks to alter the timeline

773
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:31,386
to suit his own purpose.

774
00:40:33,595 --> 00:40:35,395
Eobard Thawne.

775
00:40:37,056 --> 00:40:39,807
The Reverse-Flash. Your teacher.

776
00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:42,444
Your partner.

777
00:40:42,521 --> 00:40:45,947
Your secret.

778
00:40:46,024 --> 00:40:47,783
Nora?

779
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,371
Please tell us this isn't true.

780
00:40:56,344 --> 00:40:58,502
She can't.

781
00:40:58,578 --> 00:41:00,629
- Dad...
- Because it is true.

782
00:41:02,499 --> 00:41:05,092
Mom?

783
00:41:05,168 --> 00:41:07,135
I wanted to tell you.

784
00:41:07,212 --> 00:41:09,396
I-I tried to tell you.

785
00:41:13,486 --> 00:41:15,328
Dad.

786
00:41:15,353 --> 00:41:17,720
Dad, please!

787
00:41:18,181 --> 00:41:19,948
Dad!

788
00:41:20,025 --> 00:41:23,077
I'm sorry I lied to you!

789
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:30,033
So am I.

790
00:41:35,073 --> 00:41:37,091
Dad...
