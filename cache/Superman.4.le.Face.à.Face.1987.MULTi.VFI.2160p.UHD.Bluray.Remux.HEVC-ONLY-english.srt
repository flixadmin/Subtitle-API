1
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,726
Misha!

2
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,632
<i>Listen carefully...</i>

3
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,259
<i>...my son.</i>

4
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,636
<i>By now, Kal-El...</i>

5
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,433
<i>...you are entering the
atmosphere of the planet Earth.</i>

6
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,269
<i>I pray you have made a safe journey.</i>

7
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:40,275
<i>Your new home's yellow sun
gives you great physical powers.</i>

8
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,278
<i>But it cannot console your spirit.</i>

9
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:48,658
<i>Placed aboard this vessel
is an energy module...</i>

10
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:52,954
<i>...all that remains
of a once-powerful civilization:</i>

11
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,790
<i>Krypton, your mother planet.</i>

12
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,793
<i>It is my last gift to you.</i>

13
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:04,299
<i>Once removed, the ship will
grow cold and silent...</i>

14
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:07,969
<i>...and you will be finally alone.</i>

15
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:12,682
<i>The power in the module
can be used but once.</i>

16
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:17,562
<i>Use it wisely, my son.</i>

17
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,137
Clark, you out here?

18
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,264
Clark Kent!

19
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,184
Hi, Mr. Hornsby. Over here.

20
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,186
- There you are.
- How are you, sir?

21
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,523
- I'm fine. How are you?
- N ice to see you.

22
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,817
- It's been a Iong time.
- A Iong time.

23
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,528
I was tidying up for you
to show it.

24
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:10,532
Did I mention there was
an offer to buy, sight unseen?

25
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,868
I don't want to sell
to a big developer.

26
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:17,872
The buyer has to want a farm,
not a shopping center.

27
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:21,418
Now darn it, Clark,
why are you so stubborn?

28
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,546
Today, nobody wants a farm.

29
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:29,134
You blink your eye and they'll
all be gone. That's progress.

30
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,179
Oh, my gosh, look at this.

31
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,060
Oh, what a joker
old Jonathan Kent was.

32
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:43,565
You know, I asked him
what happened to the baby's crib.

33
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,400
And he said:

34
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:50,864
"Oh, little Clark must've had
a bad dream and kicked it."

35
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,867
- I swear, Dad Iiked a good joke.
- Yeah.

36
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:58,538
Maybe you'd like
to keep these for your grandchildren.

37
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,374
Why, thank you very much, Clark.

38
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,293
Here, batter up.

39
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,421
- Oh, no...
- Come on. We'll hit a few.

40
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:15,055
Watch out now, these will
come in pretty fast.

41
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,689
You never could hit a curve ball!

42
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:31,821
My decision's final about the place.
I'm holding out for a farmer.

43
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,406
You are?

44
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,411
You're just as obstinate
as your father was.

45
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,789
I'm sorry, that's
just the way it is.

46
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,917
Be careful when you get back
to Metropolis.

47
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,462
It's a long way from
where you were born.

48
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,965
Yes, sir.
I never forget that, sir.

49
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,720
- Bye.
- Bye, Clark.

50
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:17,158
What is that God-awful noise
you're making?

51
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:21,329
Mozart, my low-forehead friend.

52
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:25,875
Even this wretched pit can't diminish
true genius.

53
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:29,420
Life itself started in a murky pit
like this.

54
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,633
A true genius like myself
Iearns to seize the moment.

55
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,010
You're the first to know...

56
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:40,640
...that I now have plans
to re-create Iife itself.

57
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:45,895
Luthor, start breaking a sweat
or we'II throw you to the wolVes.

58
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,564
Get them duds dirty.

59
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,191
- Move it, meathead.
- Let's see you sweat.

60
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,820
What's that car doing here?!
Stop that vehicle!

61
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,783
- Hey, stop!
- Hold it there, son.

62
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:03,997
Where the hell is this and how
do I get to Cedar City?

63
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,167
Ha, ha. You on the wrong side
of the state.

64
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,335
- No chance.
- Oh, no.

65
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:15,925
You got a fine, fine super-fine
sound system here, son.

66
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:20,889
I guess you dudes never seen
these Sensurround 100s?

67
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,433
Yeah, I seen one once in a magazine.

68
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,852
Well, heck. Come on, get in.

69
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,730
- Really?
- Come on.

70
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,524
- You want to hear it, come on!
- AII right.

71
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,861
Hop in, Bubba.
Let's give it a listen.

72
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:37,864
This is great!

73
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,701
Doors...

74
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,371
- What's going on?
- Windows...

75
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,042
- Whoa! What's happening?
- The top.

76
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,085
Seats!

77
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,339
Lordy! Lordy!

78
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,174
And away!

79
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,971
Y'all come back and see us!

80
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,724
Launch.

81
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,773
AII right!

82
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,944
Did I do okay or what, Uncle Lex?

83
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:20,073
Lenny, you're the Dutch elm
disease of my family tree.

84
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,574
But you did fine.

85
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,581
You gonna skip the country, Uncle Lex?

86
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:33,628
You pathetic product of the public
schools, I've thought of nothing else...

87
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,297
...since I've been incarcerated
except one thing:

88
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,092
- Destroy Superman!
- Destroy Superman!

89
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,806
Sorry.

90
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,781
Clark!

91
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,357
Help!

92
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,735
Help! Help!

93
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,862
Somebody get help!

94
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,587
Superman!

95
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,529
He's okay. He needs a doctor.

96
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,115
Superman!

97
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:30,745
Gentlemen, one moment. I want people
to know that our subway...

98
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:35,375
...is the safest, most reliable
public transit. Thank you.

99
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,505
Thanks.

100
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,926
You're Iate, Kent.

101
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,553
- Sorry, won't happen again.
- Ha!

102
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,139
Where is everybody?

103
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,349
Boring.

104
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,560
Tedious.

105
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,064
- Hey, what's going on?
- Abominable!

106
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,109
<i>Regardez, voilá</i> David Warfield.

107
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:04,612
David Warfield who owns those
sleazy tabloids?

108
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:09,575
<i>Au contraire.</i> Who owns those
sleazy tabloids and <i>The Daily Planet.</i>

109
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,452
Tedious.

110
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,788
You only read the pictures?

111
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,750
The fact is, Mr. White,
that I only read the Iedger.

112
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:22,130
A ledger the previous owners
paid so Iittle attention to...

113
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,340
...I bought the paper from them.

114
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,760
<i>The Daily Planet</i> hasn't made
money in three years.

115
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,430
The name of the game
is making money.

116
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:34,976
Ladies and gentlemen,
my daughter, Lacy Warfield.

117
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,770
- Thanks, Daddy.
- It's nice to meet you.

118
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,983
Mr. White, Lacy will be helping you.

119
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,193
Helping me? Helping me what?

120
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,780
Here are some mock copies
of our new Iayout.

121
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:51,701
It's super. We can change the suit.

122
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,872
Excuse me, Mr. Warfield.
The world isn't on the brink.

123
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,166
Isn't that headline irresponsible?

124
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:01,794
Maybe, but it'll sell
a lot of newspapers.

125
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,380
Mr. White, don't do anything rash.

126
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:08,384
You won't turn this grand
old lady into one of your bimbos...

127
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:13,222
May I point out that Daddy
holds all of your contracts...

128
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,516
...which you must honor.

129
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,979
<i>- Excusez-moi,</i> your spoiled-ness. <i>..</i>
- Why is Lois speaking French?

130
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:24,984
...I'm flying to Paris for
the emergency Ministers' Conference...

131
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,154
Not so fast. All trips are canceled.

132
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,240
You mean my trip to Paris is canceled?

133
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:36,704
Mr. White, I want to see your books.
Everyone get back to work.

134
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,707
This isn't fair.
I'll speak to Miss Warfield.

135
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,543
- Me too.
- Excuse me, Miss Warfield.

136
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:46,672
I speak for us all when I say
we'll cooperate.

137
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,424
Thank you.

138
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,511
But a reporter's first allegiance
is to the truth.

139
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:55,515
This city depends on us
and we can't let them down.

140
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,683
Thank you.

141
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,898
Is he for real?

142
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:08,361
100 percent, and I Iike him that way.

143
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:13,074
- Oh, you have a thing for him.
- For Clark?! No!

144
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,201
He's kind of cute.

145
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,246
Look, Miss Warfield...

146
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,916
...Clark is the oldest
living Boy Scout, okay?

147
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,418
He's trustworthy, he's helpful...

148
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:27,213
...he's loyal, he's obedient, he...

149
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,590
I don't know how to say it.

150
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:34,470
I just don't think he'd be attracted
to somebody like you.

151
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:39,308
Don't be silly. All men like me.
I'm very, very rich!

152
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:44,105
Why aren't there air travel expenses
for you, Mr. Kent?

153
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,732
I get airsick,
mostly when it's bumpy.

154
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,235
Lois, get in here!

155
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,073
Lois, explain this column of figures.

156
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,910
- The president is coming on live.
- Right now?

157
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,955
- It won't be good.
- You always overreact.

158
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:05,501
- It won't be that terrible.
- Hopefully very terrible.

159
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,796
Circulation will double
with a crisis.

160
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,591
<i>Because the summit has failed...</i>

161
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:16,971
<i>...we have no choice but
to strive to be second to none...</i>

162
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,015
<i>...in the nuclear arms race.</i>

163
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:23,853
<i>Therefore, I am announcing
the following measures...</i>

164
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,442
I know you're all upset
by the crisis.

165
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:34,113
The best thing we can do
is to try to think positiVely.

166
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,285
Now, is there anything we can do?
Doesn't anyone have a suggestion?

167
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:44,457
AII right, I'll make a suggestion.

168
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,336
Why don't we write to our congressman?

169
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:52,590
- That'll do a lot of good.
- Somebody has to be an optimist.

170
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,134
Jeremy?

171
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,347
What can we do about the crisis?

172
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,141
He doesn't know what's going on.

173
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,187
I know who I'd write to
who'd do some good.

174
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,857
- Who? Santa Claus?
- No, Superman!

175
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,026
Superman, in our new exhibit...

176
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,529
...donated a strand
of his hair to the museum...

177
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,699
...so we can have fun seeing
how strong he really is.

178
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,202
Here you see a 1000-pound load...

179
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,914
...easily suspended
by his single hair.

180
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:29,293
The museum will be closing soon,
so we should hurry.

181
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,589
Know what I can do with
a strand of his hair?

182
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,342
You could make a flying toupee.

183
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,221
That hair is
Superman's genetic material.

184
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,723
The building blocks of his body.

185
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,395
With my genius and enough nuclear
power to mutate the genes...

186
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:51,190
...I can create a being
more powerful than him.

187
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,027
With total allegiance to me.

188
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,706
You better stand back.
Keep your eye out.

189
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,615
- Miss Warfield, you want to see me?
- Hi, Clark. Come in.

190
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,785
I've come up with a brilliant idea.

191
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,620
Oh, really?

192
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,414
Daddy thinks it's brilliant.

193
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:52,585
You'll write a series
called "Metropolis Affer Hours."

194
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,503
Who, me? I...

195
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,715
It's wonderful.
It's great, isn't it?

196
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:02,094
- I don't think I'm right for this.
- You're perfect for it.

197
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:05,806
You're young, you're single,
you're successful.

198
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,641
I'm usually in bed by 10:30.

199
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:10,644
That's just it, you don't
flaunt it.

200
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:13,439
You're no slave to fashion.
Although...

201
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:17,818
- ...have you thought of contacts?
- They make my eyes itch.

202
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:21,280
Don't worry. I thought
we'd do this together.

203
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,991
- Oh?
- I know all the right places.

204
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:28,996
I belong to the right clubs.
We'll start tonight at the Metro Club.

205
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:32,041
- Oh, tonight.
- Yeah, it's a date.

206
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,334
A date! Ah!

207
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:37,296
- A date?
- Well, it's just business, actually.

208
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,342
I've got a letter here for Superman,
care of me.

209
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,552
- What?
- Superman gets mail here?

210
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,680
It's probably a photo request.
I'Il handle it.

211
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:50,768
I think it's more than just
a fan Ietter. Read it.

212
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:56,315
"Dear Superman, my teacher spoke about
the president's speech on the arms race.

213
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,153
We're all very unhappy about it.

214
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:06,492
And I said we should get Superman
to rid the world of nuclear arms...

215
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,370
...because only he could do it.

216
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:16,377
Once you've destroyed all the nuclear
missiles, they'll see I'm right.

217
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,047
Superman can make sure we don't
blow ourselves up.

218
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,384
I know you'll come through.
Your friend, Jeremy."

219
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,762
Poor kid. Oh, well,
I better get back to work.

220
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:30,766
- No, there's an angle here.
- An angle! He's just a kid!

221
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:35,771
Daddy loves whipping up campaigns.
And the public loves it!

222
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:39,567
- Lacy!
- We'll make the kid a celebrity.

223
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:43,737
The world is gonna be
wondering what Superman's reply is.

224
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,410
Welcome to Metropolis, Jeremy.

225
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,247
I'm Mr. Warfield and this is
my daughter, Lacy.

226
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,250
- Hi, Jeremy.
- Come along and meet the press.

227
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,919
- How was your trip?
- The car had a flat.

228
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,921
Sorry to hear that. Turn around.

229
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:03,424
Let everybody get a picture of you.

230
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,801
- That's it, everyone.
- Jeremy!

231
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,596
What a boy! Now come along...

232
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:11,932
...and tell the American public
what you told me.

233
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:15,102
I just said I wish Superman
would've said yes.

234
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,896
- Did you get that?
- No.

235
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:19,440
Well, say it again. Loudly.

236
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,860
I said I wish Superman
would've said yes!

237
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:31,911
Miss Lane!

238
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:36,290
Miss Lane, take a look at this.
Hot off the press.

239
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,292
Oh, my God!

240
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:42,129
This time he's gone too far.
Look, Clark.

241
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,381
Can't wait to see
the chief's reaction.

242
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,426
I'm through taking it lying down.

243
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,054
I'll be downtown.

244
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,264
Chief look different to you?

245
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:56,477
He looks like my father used to look
when he asked the bank for a loan.

246
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,771
I'll make sure he's all right.

247
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:04,276
There's nothing we can do.
It's Superman's decision now.

248
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:07,446
I'm sure he'll do the right thing.

249
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,361
<i>May the elders watch over you...</i>

250
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,488
<i>...my son.</i>

251
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,493
<i>Their wisdom is all that's left
of a once powerful...</i>

252
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,996
<i>...and enlightened planet.</i>

253
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:02,334
<i>You must listen to them, Kal-El.</i>

254
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:04,837
<i>Listen.</i>

255
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,636
I know I'm forbidden to interfere.

256
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:17,766
And yet the Earth is threatened
by the same fate as Krypton's.

257
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,561
The Earth is too primitiVe.

258
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,855
You can flee to new worlds...

259
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,400
...where war is long forgotten.

260
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:30,362
If you teach the Earth
to put its fate in any one man...

261
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,072
...even yourself...

262
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,700
...you're teaching them
to be betrayed.

263
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,247
Betrayed, betrayed...

264
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,375
...betrayed, betrayed!

265
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:49,548
<i>Because the summit has failed...</i>

266
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:53,052
<i>...we have no choice but to strive...</i>

267
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:58,223
<i>...to be second to none
in the nuclear arms race.</i>

268
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,100
<i>To that end...</i>

269
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:05,773
<i>...this administration has pursued
and will continue to pursue...</i>

270
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,734
<i>...the most vigorous policy.</i>

271
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,402
<i>Therefore...</i>

272
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,199
Just a minute.

273
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,914
- Lois?
- There you are. What happened?

274
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,958
- What do you mean?
- Nothing, just:

275
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,628
"Meet me in the lobby at 6:00
for the awards dinner.

276
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,005
Dress nice
and don't be late."

277
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:34,009
- You were talking about some other Lois?
- I'm sorry, I forgot.

278
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:37,096
Go get your penguin suit on
and we'll go.

279
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:42,101
I'd rather not, if you don't mind.
I've got lots of thinking to do.

280
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,061
But you go ahead. Okay?

281
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:51,276
Clark? Something's wrong, isn't it?

282
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,992
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yes, as a matter of fact.

283
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:01,954
- What?
- Could we go get some fresh air?

284
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,457
Fresh air?

285
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,836
Fresh air. Fresh air, sure.

286
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,796
Sure, Clark. Sure.

287
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:13,632
Who needs rubbery chicken anyway?

288
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,468
Let's go.
Let's get some fresh air.

289
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,888
Breathe. Do you feel better?

290
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,015
Clark?

291
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:25,060
Clark? Clark, things aren't
that bad! Stop!

292
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,311
Oh, Clark!

293
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,814
Clark! Clark!

294
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:39,825
Superman!

295
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,305
You okay?

296
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,806
Great.

297
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,693
Hey, look at that.

298
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,998
- There you go. Bye-bye!
- Ah!

299
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:01,281
- How'd you like going solo?
- I Ioved it.

300
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,575
Not as much as being with you.

301
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:07,120
I needed to be with you too.
You make me laugh.

302
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,751
You're the only one I can talk to.

303
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:17,589
See, sometimes I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

304
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:22,427
I'm always here for you,
you know that.

305
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:26,598
And you'll do the right thing,
no matter what. You always have.

306
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,600
Thank you.

307
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,311
- You know something?
- What?

308
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,607
- You don't even know my name.
- Kal-EI.

309
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,903
You remember, don't you?

310
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,656
I remember everything.

311
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:48,120
"Never set one of them above the rest.
Love all humanity instead ."

312
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,624
That's not fair.

313
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:23,655
- Lois! It's time to go. We'll be late.
- Huh?

314
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:29,036
Why am I out here
freezing my butt off?

315
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,997
Oh, you wanted some fresh air.

316
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:36,209
That's okay.
I don't want to catch a cold.

317
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:40,756
I feel kind of weird,
like I'm jet-lagged or something.

318
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,883
- Jeepers!
- Am I going crazy?

319
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:49,014
- How about you? Are you still down?
- Nope. Things are clear.

320
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:53,393
Good. Too much thinking
wears down your batteries.

321
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:59,733
- Clark, you gotta go with your gut.
- Hm.

322
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:00,984
Come on.

323
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,491
Here you go, Jeremy.

324
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:13,372
Mr. Warfield wants shots with local
color, but I can't think of anything.

325
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,000
- Hi, Jeremy.
- Superman!

326
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:18,877
Jimmy.

327
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:20,879
What a scoop!

328
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:24,591
- How'd you like to walk with me?
- Sure!

329
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,676
Jimmy, come on.

330
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:42,901
You can't! You'll get towed.

331
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:47,906
- Do you know how much tickets cost?
- It's only money.

332
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,292
Will you wait for me
in the gallery?

333
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:00,627
Sure, okay.

334
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,422
- Good luck, Superman.
- Thanks.

335
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,765
I saved you a seat.

336
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,269
Yeah!

337
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,772
AII right, Superman!

338
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,862
Madam Secretary, I'd like to
address the delegates.

339
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:30,949
Well, in that case,
you will need a sponsor.

340
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,121
I believe that will do. Please.

341
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,126
Thank you.

342
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:47,466
- What's he gonna say?
- Something wonderful.

343
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:50,135
Madam Secretary...

344
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:54,139
...honorable delegates,
ladies and gentlemen.

345
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:57,517
For many years now
I've lived among you as...

346
00:32:57,601 --> 00:33:01,480
...a visitor.
I've seen the beauty of your cultures.

347
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:05,692
I've felt joy in your magnificent
accomplishments.

348
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,236
I've seen the folly of your wars.

349
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:12,199
As of today I'm not a visitor
anymore...

350
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:15,660
...because the Earth is my home too.

351
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:19,247
We can't live in fear.
And I can't stand...

352
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:23,043
...idly by and watch us
stumble into the madness...

353
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:27,172
...of possible nuclear destruction.
I've come to a decision.

354
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,510
I'll do what our governments couldn't.

355
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:36,973
Effective immediately, I'll
rid our planet of all nuclear weapons.

356
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,519
AII right, Superman!

357
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,649
Way to go, Superman!

358
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,543
Missile test Alpha, all systems go.

359
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,420
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

360
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:57,656
Oh!

361
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,450
Oh. Nice to see you guys!

362
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:06,665
Why don't you just relax.
I'll get on with the introductions:

363
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:10,043
Dixie and Trixie.

364
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:17,467
From the land of the free, the home of
the cost overrun, Harry Howler:

365
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:21,179
Nuclear strategist from
America's top think tank.

366
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:24,099
A great little warmonger
in his own right.

367
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,227
A hearty <i>bienvenue</i>
to Jean Pierre Dubois:

368
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:32,232
Nuclear warhead dealer to the world.
His motto is:

369
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:38,071
"If you didn't buy it from Jean Pierre,
it wasn't on the black market."

370
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,864
General Romoff.

371
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,952
People think of you
as the "Mad Russian."

372
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:48,456
I Iike to think of you
as just madly eccentric.

373
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,083
Please be seated.

374
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:56,214
Look guys. I know you're all choked
up, kind of overcome with joy...

375
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,217
...that Superman has ended
the arms race.

376
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,431
But if we work together,
we can make the world safe...

377
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:07,392
- ...for war profits.
- Get to the point.

378
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:11,271
I, Lex Luthor, the greatest
criminal mind of the modern era...

379
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:16,693
...know how to destroy Superman.
Behold, my unscrupulous friends...

380
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,613
Shut those blinds.

381
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:24,367
- The sun is hurting my eyes!
- Exactly.

382
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:29,289
You know what the sun is? Nothing
more than a huge nuclear bomb...

383
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:34,085
...with so much radiation, it'd
incinerate the average man like that!

384
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,922
Yes, but Superman is no average man.

385
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,883
Aha, right!

386
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,844
What is your plan?

387
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:47,474
Boys, old Lex here
has kind of a secret recipe...

388
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:51,394
...a genetic stew in this dish,
if you will.

389
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,981
If you'll help me put this
on one of your missiles...

390
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:59,694
...I promise, Superman will have
the biggest surprise of his life.

391
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:04,449
I'll introduce him to his first
nightmare, a "Nuclear Man ."

392
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:08,953
He'll pierce his skin, make
him mortal. He'll become sick.

393
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:11,039
We'll dance on his grave.

394
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:15,084
Why should we deal with
a scoundrel Iike you?

395
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:19,506
Remember my motto: "The more fear
you make, the more loot you take."

396
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,716
And the more missiles you sell.

397
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:25,428
Yes, but what's in it for you?

398
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:29,474
A tiny commission.

399
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,685
Something appropriate.

400
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,104
A number...

401
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:38,191
...with a lot of zeros behind it.

402
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,616
Lenny.

403
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,285
The new genetic material.

404
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,373
And now, Leonard...

405
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,750
...your Uncle Lex...

406
00:38:55,834 --> 00:39:00,463
...with protoplasm grown
from Superman's hair cells...

407
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,509
...will duplicate creation itself.

408
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:07,679
Now the fabric.

409
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,809
U ncle Lex, this ain't gonna cover him.

410
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,355
The computer inside will...

411
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:22,110
...leave enough material to maintain
the high moral standards...

412
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,530
...that I've always subscribed to.

413
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:29,075
- Know what this means, Uncle Lex?
- What?

414
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:30,785
We're gonna be parents.

415
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,735
- What's your name?
- York, sir.

416
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,069
At ease.

417
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,187
Launch control. Yes, sir.

418
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,105
Yes, sir.

419
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:44,400
There's a weather problem.
We gotta hold.

420
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,069
Hold?

421
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,571
- What's your name, son?
- Goram.

422
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,073
"Goram, sir."

423
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,617
- Goram, sir.
- You know your code book?

424
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,160
Of course, sir.

425
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:58,539
27-0-6, inclement override.
Fire on my command. Fire.

426
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,250
Yes, sir. Stand by to Iaunch.

427
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,879
Ten, nine...

428
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,310
Missed us.

429
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:38,890
Reach out.

430
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,434
Come on.

431
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,603
Down.

432
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,563
Reach out.

433
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,066
And stretch.

434
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,400
Down.

435
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,444
- Up.
- Ugh!

436
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:54,739
- Are you okay?
- I think I better sit this out.

437
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:58,910
Are you sure? This would be great
for your series on Metropolis.

438
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,995
Let's try it again. Come on.

439
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,915
Two, three, four.

440
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:07,085
- One, two, three.
- Ugh.

441
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:10,421
- I don't think so.
- What, are you okay?

442
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:21,516
28, 29...

443
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,226
- ...33.
- Heh, heh, heh.

444
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:26,270
- Done. Great.
- Okay, you try it now.

445
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:30,775
- Let's set it a little higher for you.
- Okay.

446
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,819
Just push down.

447
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:40,368
- Are you okay? Just step down.
- Need some help?

448
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,205
He doesn't know his own strength.

449
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,915
Clark, this is Paul.

450
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,042
- He's a trainer.
- Nice to meet you.

451
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,419
Hey, I got just the thing for you.

452
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,505
Over here, Clarky.

453
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:54,132
Clarky?

454
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,680
It's real nice of him to help me out.

455
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,391
- He's really good.
- Here, try this one.

456
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,727
Clark! Are you okay? Sorry.

457
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,604
No pain, no gain.

458
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,650
Jeez, what a jerk.

459
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,486
Never realized it before.

460
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:18,489
I guess a lot of people I know
are jerks.

461
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:21,951
You must think I am too.
That's why you avoid me.

462
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,705
I don't think that at all.
Just been really busy.

463
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:27,957
But wait!

464
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,628
Lois is doing that interview
with Superman about his peace mission.

465
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:37,091
I was thinking the four of us can get
together at my hotel, have high tea.

466
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,843
It's very chic.

467
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,929
- Can you hand me those weights?
- Excuse me.

468
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:43,973
Wait, Lacy.

469
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:48,978
Come early. The view is romantic
from my balcony. See you.

470
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:53,274
- Oh, sure. Here.
- Not those! The other one!

471
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,277
No pain, no gain?

472
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,122
What was that?

473
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:14,170
Uncle Lex.
You're spooking me out.

474
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:17,632
There.

475
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,845
Madam, thank you very much.

476
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,454
I'm incredible.

477
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,458
Uncle Lex, he's like...

478
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,754
He's beautiful. He's perfect.

479
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:02,885
Welcome home, Nuclear Man.
Your father's happy to see you.

480
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:22,321
The power of the sun gives him
internally generated heat.

481
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:26,534
I'm a...

482
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,577
You are...

483
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:33,291
I'm... What? I'm a genius?

484
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,418
I'm incredible. I'm...

485
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,214
You are nothing. I am the father now.

486
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:44,677
- You have my voice.
- No, you have my voice.

487
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,263
Just remember, I made you.

488
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,683
Yeah, you're just an experiment,
freako.

489
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,186
What is that?

490
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:58,774
- Oh, no.
- I'm an experiment. I'm a freako.

491
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:02,194
I was just kidding about freako!

492
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:05,448
If anyone's a freako here,
it's gotta be me!

493
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,742
Oh, wow. Oh!

494
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:12,330
Oh, wow, I'm break dancing, hey!
This rocks. Hey!

495
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:18,836
- I made you. I can destroy you.
- Destroy.

496
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,380
Destroy Superman now.

497
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:25,134
You sweet thing.
But not quite yet, no.

498
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:29,805
Come here. We'll discuss
when the proper time is.

499
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,813
Uncle Lex.

500
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:45,738
Oh, no!

501
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,949
He's, like... He's, like, cold.

502
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,659
Of course he is.

503
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:55,539
That's his vulnerability.
The only way he'll be stopped.

504
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:56,749
What?

505
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:02,338
Lenny, my loud-mouthed nephew,
he gets his energy from the sun.

506
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:06,342
Without it, he's like you at night:
Useless.

507
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,149
Nobody's perfect.

508
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:32,868
I never had a double date before.
It's fun. How do I Iook?

509
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:38,290
Illegal. Like the last six dresses
you tried on.

510
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:42,711
Listen, Lacy? I don't want to
burst your bubble...

511
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:46,006
- ...but Clark won't notice your dress.
- Yes, he will.

512
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:50,136
- There's Clark.
- Fix that. There you go. You look great.

513
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:52,680
- Maybe it's just Superman.
- No.

514
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:57,977
No, Superman makes a different
kind of entrance.

515
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:10,948
- Hi, Lacy.
- Hi, Clark.

516
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,701
Can you break a 20?
Driver had no change.

517
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:16,412
Yeah, sure. Let me get my purse.

518
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,581
- Hi, Lois.
- Hi, Clark.

519
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:19,832
- Clark.
- What?

520
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:22,585
You won't believe
these questions...

521
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,629
...Mr. Warfield gave me
to ask Superman.

522
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:29,592
"Are you part of a plot
to weaken our national defense?"

523
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,344
- Oh, my goodness.
- I think his gray matter is...

524
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:35,931
- How will I ask him this?
- Well, politely I guess.

525
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:39,727
Let's see, I have 18 dollars and...

526
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:43,814
Clark, she really likes you,
so notice the dress.

527
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,941
...my American Express card.

528
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:48,444
- Dress.
- Oh, hey, neat dress.

529
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:50,863
Thanks. Be right back.

530
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:55,868
What's that?

531
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:01,499
Now, there's a different
kind of entrance.

532
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:06,045
- Hi, Lois.
- Hello, Superman.

533
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,421
How are you?

534
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:09,215
I'm fine.

535
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:14,595
Oh. Superman, this is Lacy Warfield.
She's the boss's daughter.

536
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,223
How do you do?
That's an attractive outfit.

537
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:20,851
- We should start our interview.
- Excuse me.

538
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:22,520
Two's company.

539
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,940
Oh, right, yeah.
Yeah, I'll go get Clark.

540
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:32,154
Clark is probably helping the cab driver
change a flat tire, or something.

541
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:33,322
That guy.

542
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,535
- Something smells wonderful.
- Thank you.

543
00:50:37,618 --> 00:50:40,371
I'm cooking us some scallops
and some duck...

544
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:44,083
...in this wonderful mushroom sauce
with champagne.

545
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,544
In case we got hungry afterwards.

546
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:48,629
I mean, Iater.

547
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:52,174
You shouldn't have gone
through all that trouble.

548
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,349
Should we get on with the interview?

549
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:03,602
Yes, let's get on
with the interview.

550
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,145
Um...

551
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,189
Um...

552
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:12,403
Have you had any trouble
confiscating the missiles?

553
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:15,948
There always was the possibility
that warped individuals...

554
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,867
...would take advantage of
the world's goodwill, but...

555
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,621
Is there something wrong?

556
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,836
Oh! My dinner! My dinner!

557
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,713
I'Il be right back.

558
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:32,548
Be right back.

559
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:46,103
Hi.

560
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:49,315
- I missed you, Clark.
- Oh. Well...

561
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:53,319
Lois and Superman are boring.
Let's do something wild.

562
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:56,113
They're expecting us.
It's not polite.

563
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,740
Yeah, you're right.

564
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:02,453
How can one man be so square
and so delicious?

565
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:07,458
Let's go chitchat. If I
have to face Superman, so do you.

566
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,418
Lacy?

567
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,005
Oh, Clark.

568
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,174
Uh... Uh... Stop.

569
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:39,281
I don't believe it! I never had duck
turn out so perfectly. It's amazing!

570
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:41,825
- I'm out here, Lois.
- Oh.

571
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:58,759
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yes, it is beautiful.

572
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,970
The whole world is beautiful.

573
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:07,351
I feel moments like this
should be shared with someone you...

574
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:11,146
Someone you care a lot about.

575
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:17,277
- Isn't that the doorbell?
- Yes. Heh, heh.

576
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:34,628
Lacy.

577
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:39,508
- Where's Clark?
- He was getting in the elevator...

578
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:44,263
- Never mind, it's a long story.
- It always is with Clark.

579
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:46,932
Great, it's him.

580
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:50,894
- Clark?
- Hi.

581
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:53,522
Those bellboys ought to
look where they're going.

582
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,274
Superman?

583
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:58,902
- I'm so glad you're back.
- Is dinner ready? Can we eat?

584
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:01,530
- Yeah, let's go sit down.
- Oh, great.

585
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:08,120
- Sorry!
- My goodness! That's okay.

586
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:11,415
Just leave it there.
It's on your pants.

587
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:14,918
Let me just get a rag.
Be right back.

588
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:21,008
Where's Clark?

589
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:26,805
<i>Hello, Dolly Hello, Dolly</i>

590
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:30,976
<i>It's so nice to have me back
Where I belong</i>

591
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,481
<i>Don't be concerned, Blue Boy.
Only you can hear me.</i>

592
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:38,942
<i>It's my own private frequency.
You might call it "Lex TV."</i>

593
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:42,446
<i>Look to your left,
tall, dark and handsome.</i>

594
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:47,951
<i>I'll blow 20 stories off that building,
give or take a floor or two.</i>

595
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:49,286
<i>Peace.</i>

596
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,039
Men.

597
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:55,626
- I hope Clark's okay. I'll look.
- Okay.

598
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:03,217
I'm sorry, but an emergency's come up.
My apologies to Miss Warfield.

599
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,510
Oh, but...

600
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:08,430
Superman! Take me with you!
I can cover the story!

601
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:12,309
- You seen Clark?
- Huh?

602
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:24,530
Guess who?
It's your old friend Lex.

603
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:30,702
I suspect if you'd actually planted
a bomb, you'd be miles away by now.

604
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:34,665
This is my nephew Lenny.
He worships me.

605
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:39,253
The dude of steel.
Boy, are you gonna get it.

606
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:44,883
Silly me, thinking that
I could fool a super guy.

607
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:47,427
You're right. No bomb.

608
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:51,181
It's just that you're so involved
in this world peace bit...

609
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:53,934
...you don't have time
for social calls.

610
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:57,020
I confess, I tricked you.

611
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:58,397
You look great.

612
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,900
Never mind the small talk.
What are you up to?

613
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,862
You know you're a workaholic?

614
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:07,865
You're playing a good guy
24 hours a day.

615
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:10,242
Why don't you stop and
smell the roses, huh?

616
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:13,662
Get yourself a hobby? A pet?
A kitten, a puppy?

617
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:18,250
I know you hate children and animals.
What are you doing back in Metropolis?

618
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:23,005
I want to be first to introduce
you to the new kid on the block.

619
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:39,021
Look closely at the cell structure.

620
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:41,315
You see anything familiar?

621
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,735
You've already broke
all the laws of man.

622
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:47,738
Now you've broken the laws
of nature too.

623
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:52,701
I assume you hid a device of some kind
in a missile I hurled into the sun.

624
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:56,914
Mr. Muscle, I'm gonna really miss
these Iittle chats we had together.

625
00:56:56,997 --> 00:56:59,708
Only you can keep up with me.

626
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,877
- Lenny!
- What?

627
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:04,963
I wanna propose a toast.

628
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:09,760
To a nice guy, who's about
to finish last.

629
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,723
Destroy Superman.

630
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,975
Later. Heh, heh, heh.

631
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:20,687
He's a little bit anxious.
Can you blame him?

632
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,649
Not one of your great thinkers.

633
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:26,985
But I, in all modesty, am.

634
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:31,448
The touching thing about this plan
is, you helped me devise it.

635
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:35,619
Prison has twisted
your mind into a delusional state.

636
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,162
No, no, no. Listen.

637
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:40,499
When I escaped prison,
I had one thing on my mind:

638
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,459
The end of Superman.

639
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:45,253
There I was, the first time in my life...

640
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:50,258
...that I didn't have a long-range,
truly devious, criminal scheme.

641
00:57:50,342 --> 00:57:52,427
And then I came up with it.

642
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,429
With this guy...

643
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:59,101
...and you gone, I'll make
a fortune rearming the world.

644
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:02,896
You'd risk nuclear war for
your own financial gain.

645
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:07,234
Nobody wants war. I just want
to keep the threat alive.

646
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:11,655
N ifty, huh?

647
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,245
Good night, sweet prince.

648
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,790
Parting is...

649
00:58:22,374 --> 00:58:23,750
...inevitable.

650
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,753
Destroy Superman.

651
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,548
First, I have fun.

652
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:34,488
Help me!

653
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,499
Superman!

654
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:26,506
I said I'd get you to run one of our
papers yourself, and I meant it.

655
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:30,093
Congratulations, Miss Publisher.

656
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:32,720
Thank you, Daddy, that's very nice.

657
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:34,681
Step into your office.

658
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:40,061
- Where'd this come from?
- Somebody brought it in.

659
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:41,604
We bought it, cheap.

660
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:45,859
Okay, this time you've both
gone too far.

661
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:49,237
You can print your stupid rag
without Lois Lane.

662
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:56,327
And you certainly have
no right to this.

663
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:59,581
- Lois, I'm sorry!
- Let her go, darling.

664
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:01,541
I mean, she's useless.

665
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:04,544
And while you're at it,
fire Clark Kent.

666
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:07,255
He hasn't been around
or telephoned.

667
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:09,757
I know, I'm worried about him.

668
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:11,509
Oh, kitten...

669
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:16,306
...didn't we have a talk about
personal involvement with the help?

670
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:19,350
- Now that you're the publisher...
- Daddy.

671
01:06:19,434 --> 01:06:21,561
- Yes, darling.
- Stuff it!

672
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:27,108
Lois. Lois, I'm sorry.

673
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:29,944
I promise, I had
nothing to do with that.

674
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:38,870
Have you heard from Clark?

675
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,249
No.

676
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:09,317
Just a minute.

677
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:11,319
Oh, Lois.

678
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,531
- What are you doing here?
- I knew it.

679
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:20,453
I just got a really bad flu.
What do you mean you knew it?

680
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:25,917
You haven't been to work
or called the office.

681
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,171
You haven't even called me back.
How could you not call me back?

682
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:36,636
Whatever it is,
you've got your reasons.

683
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:40,598
But I knew you were here, you know?

684
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:43,017
Somehow...

685
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:45,812
...something pulled me here.

686
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,273
I always know when Superman's
in trouble.

687
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:51,484
Heh, heh, heh. Superman?
Something's happened to him?

688
01:07:52,277 --> 01:07:54,946
Everybody's saying that
he's dead but...

689
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:59,742
...it can't be true. I just know it.
I feel it in my heart.

690
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:02,287
I think he just needs help.

691
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:05,498
Wherever he is,
I'm sure he'll manage.

692
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:09,502
Well, if he can't manage...

693
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:13,631
...and if he really is in trouble...

694
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:18,011
...then there's a few things
I'd like to tell him.

695
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,598
I'd tell him...

696
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:26,686
...that I will always cherish
the time we spent together.

697
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:30,565
And that I never expected
anything in return.

698
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:33,234
And no matter...

699
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:37,614
...how few minutes I saw him for,
it always made me happy.

700
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:41,367
And I would tell him
that I love him...

701
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:44,412
...and that I'll always love him.

702
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:46,080
And that...

703
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:48,541
...whatever...

704
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,377
...happens to the world...

705
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,546
...I know that...

706
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:58,635
...he's doing his best to make sure
it's good for all of us.

707
01:08:59,093 --> 01:09:01,012
Wherever he is, Lois...

708
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:05,308
...I know that he would
want to thank you.

709
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:15,276
Listen, I'm pretty tired, you know?

710
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:19,280
So I think I'll just rest here
for a while. Okay?

711
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:21,115
I'Il be fine.

712
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:24,452
It's okay. Please?

713
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:30,750
- I hope you feel better, Clark.
- Thanks.

714
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:45,098
If you do see him, or hear from him...

715
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:49,352
...he might need this.

716
01:09:57,193 --> 01:10:02,949
Oh, Lex. We're very pleased
at all the nuclear arms...

717
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,951
...you helped us sell...

718
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:09,163
...and we've decided
to increase your commission.

719
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:12,375
Guys, really, that's great.

720
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,336
It is the least we could do.

721
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:18,172
I had another idea.
Gentlemen...

722
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:22,176
...I've decided to assume control
of the company.

723
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:33,646
My first official act
is to say, "You're fired!"

724
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:36,482
You're mad.

725
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:38,192
Oh, really?

726
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:50,663
If you want a reference for work...

727
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:52,331
...forget it!

728
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:57,295
That's a good bit.

729
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:02,675
You know with my brains, and your...
Frankly, your...

730
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:06,763
...brawn, the possibilities
are absolutely staggering.

731
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:09,807
I could be president,
emperor, king.

732
01:11:10,224 --> 01:11:14,270
- See how scared those guys were?
- And what do you fear?

733
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:19,942
What? Now? With Superman dead,
and you're on my team?

734
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:24,697
It's Iike I'm the coach, and you're the
best power forward ever. What's to fear?

735
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:42,924
<i>All that remains of
Krypton's energy is yours.</i>

736
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:45,384
<i>After it is gone...</i>

737
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:49,013
<i>...you will belong solely
to your new home.</i>

738
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:54,685
<i>If our dying planet can
save your life, my son...</i>

739
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:58,147
<i>...we have not died in vain.</i>

740
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:07,383
- Where is the woman?
- You'll never find her.

741
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:11,470
If you will not tell me,
I will hurt people.

742
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,952
Stop! Don't do it, the people!

743
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,700
Whoa!

744
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,416
Whoa!

745
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,927
- What's happening?
- Easy, easy, easy.

746
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:36,681
AII right, stop! Stop! That's enough!
That's enough!

747
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:38,975
You win.
I'll take you to her.

748
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:14,010
- Where is she?
- Far away from here and safe.

749
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:15,970
She's not in there!

750
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:19,004
We must tone down the headlines.

751
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:23,008
Tone down our headlines?
That's all the common man reads!

752
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:28,055
- We can do with less sensationalism.
- Less sensational papers go broke.

753
01:19:28,389 --> 01:19:32,768
I taught you that the
business of newspapers is business.

754
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:34,144
No, Daddy...

755
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:36,522
...our business is journalism.

756
01:19:36,814 --> 01:19:41,527
We can't be irresponsible or we'll
lead everyone into disaster.

757
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,696
Don't be overdramatic,
young lady.

758
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:47,116
What kind of disaster could
we bring about?

759
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:50,619
Lacy!

760
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:25,005
What's going on? Hey!

761
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:44,316
Are you sure you know what
you're doing?

762
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:47,236
- Well...
- Uh... Ahem.

763
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:49,196
Here comes Mr. Warfield.

764
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:52,074
You'd better have
a good explanation, White...

765
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:55,077
...or else you'll be talking
to your lawyers from jail.

766
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:59,748
You know, I'm not a tycoon.
I'm just an old reporter.

767
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:03,168
But I've read enough in my own
newspaper over the years...

768
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:05,754
...about hostile takeovers
of big companies.

769
01:22:05,838 --> 01:22:08,715
You, Mr. Warfield,
must'Ve been asleep at the wheel.

770
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:13,387
Because I convinced the city's bankers
that our <i>Daily Planet...</i>

771
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:18,183
...should be treated like a natural
resource, protected from predators.

772
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:22,604
They lent me the money.
I bought up all the outstanding shares.

773
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:27,484
And you, Mr. Warfield,
are now a minority shareholder.

774
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:32,781
- Everyone, back to work.
- Way to tell him, chief!

775
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:34,408
Yay!

776
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:37,035
I'm sorry.
You win some and you lose some.

777
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:40,414
Now, this is what I call a newspaper.

778
01:22:40,497 --> 01:22:42,583
Compliments of <i>The Daily Planet.</i>

779
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:45,711
- Have a nice day. We did it!
- We're back! Ha, ha, ha.

780
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:52,634
- Hi, am I late?
- No. He's not here yet.

781
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:56,555
It must've been some effort for you
to drag yourself out of bed.

782
01:22:56,638 --> 01:23:00,225
I'm feeling a lot better.
Had a visit from a pretty good nurse.

783
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:03,812
Must have been good.
Miss Lane said you were really ill.

784
01:23:03,896 --> 01:23:07,774
Sometimes all you need is loving
attention from the right person.

785
01:23:07,858 --> 01:23:09,651
Glad you're back.

786
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:12,821
And remember, I am covering
Superman's press conference.

787
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:16,742
- You tape reactions from the crowd.
- Reactions, okay.

788
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:20,412
Oh, dear. Guess I need
a tape recorder, huh?

789
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:24,708
- Be right back.
- Same Mr. Kent. He'll never change.

790
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:26,627
I hope not.

791
01:23:26,919 --> 01:23:29,046
Ooh.

792
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:38,514
- How you doing, Superman?
- Lois. Good to see you again.

793
01:23:38,597 --> 01:23:40,390
Good to see you too.

794
01:23:40,474 --> 01:23:41,808
Morning, gentlemen.

795
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:43,393
Excuse me.

796
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:49,316
Thank you. We survived the threat
of war and found a fragile peace.

797
01:23:50,067 --> 01:23:53,070
I thought I could give you
freedom from war...

798
01:23:53,153 --> 01:23:56,573
...but I was wrong.
It's not mine to give.

799
01:23:57,616 --> 01:23:59,451
We're still a young planet.

800
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:02,829
There are galaxies out there...

801
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:06,833
...other civilizations for us
to meet, to learn from.

802
01:24:07,251 --> 01:24:09,419
What a brilliant future.

803
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:14,591
There will be peace when the people of
the world want it so badly...

804
01:24:14,675 --> 01:24:18,804
...that their governments will have
no choice but to give it to them.

805
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:23,267
I wish you could see the Earth
the way I do.

806
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:26,979
When you really look at it,
it's just one world.

807
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:32,901
Do you think he'll find us?

808
01:24:32,985 --> 01:24:37,823
Never. We'll lay low for a while,
a couple of years.

809
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:39,908
I'll come up with a new plan.

810
01:24:40,617 --> 01:24:43,036
Good thing I bought my drums.

811
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:55,924
Whoa!

812
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:59,428
U ncle Lex,
you won't believe this...

813
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:01,638
- ...but it's Superman.
- Superman.

814
01:25:01,722 --> 01:25:04,600
Heh, heh. Oh, wow. Oh, wow.

815
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:10,272
- Hey, this rocks.
- Morning, Father.

816
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:13,233
He's been under a bad influence.
Can you help him?

817
01:25:13,317 --> 01:25:16,069
- Every boy can be helped.
- You're right.

818
01:25:16,153 --> 01:25:18,280
- Good luck, son.
- Come with me.

819
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:20,657
You wouldn't happen
to have a drum set, would you?

820
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:23,660
Hey, Mozart's back!

821
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:31,501
- Duane, Mozart's back!
- I see him, Bubba!

822
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:36,006
- Shut up!
- Ha, ha, ha.

823
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:39,301
- Take him away.
- Thank you. Come on, Luthor.

824
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:43,597
- Just one thing, how did you beat him?
- High school physics.

825
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:45,974
I had time to figure out...

826
01:25:46,058 --> 01:25:49,853
...that if it was born from the sun,
that was its energy.

827
01:25:49,936 --> 01:25:53,023
- Will the world be vaporized?
- No, Luthor.

828
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:57,903
It's as it always was, on the brink,
with good fighting evil. See you in 20.
