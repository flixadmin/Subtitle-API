00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:29,642
- How did you...
- [Sherlock] And your neck is red.

478
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:31,586
Someone has gripped it
or held a knife against...

479
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,100
Are you involved in something dangerous?

480
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,250
You are still my ward.

481
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:44,041
If you need my help,
my offer remains on the table.

482
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:48,125
Don't be so desperate
to prove yourself, Enola.

483
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,208
[scoffs]

484
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:54,083
I am not desperate,
and I don't need your or anyone's help.

485
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,625
But this I will have.

- [Sherlock sighs]

488
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,041
[Enola] How dare he?
How dare he lecture me?

489
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:13,416
When he can't even solve his own case

490
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,666
and he lives in a bed of flummoxing papers
and bewildering mold.

491
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,375
How dare he claim I'm desperate?
It is not true.

492
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,750
- And this is not fair.
- [Tewkesbury] Enola?

493
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,500
It is you.

494
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,375
And it is you.

495
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:33,041
[Tewkesbury] How are you?

496
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,333
Are you well? You look...

497
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:40,708
I'm on a case. Undercover. Forget
I told you that piece of information.

498
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:44,625
It's the strangest thing. I could have
sworn I've seen you here before.

499
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:47,166
Is that right?

500
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:50,250
Well, this is my...
My route through to the Lords.

501
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:53,458
Is it? [chuckles awkwardly] How lovely.

502
00:28:53,541 --> 00:28:56,083
Well, I... I breakfast here on occasion.

503
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:03,750
I mean, yes, it's a lovely place.
I-I know the gardener here.

504
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:07,000
We've been discussing
what to sow for next year's crop.

505
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:08,416
Some fine sunflowers.

506
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,375
Uh, Sweet Williams,
for their lovely vivid reds.

507
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,000
I've seen all you're doing.

508
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:16,625
Oh. Well, it's... It's nothing.

509
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:18,041
In the society pages.

510
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:23,625
You are quite the eligible bachelor.

511
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,125
Don't believe all you read.

512
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:34,250
I wrote to you.

513
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,375
You didn't reply.

514
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:38,875
Uh...

515
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:41,583
I... was busy.

516
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:44,625
Starting my own business.
A perpetual challenge.

517
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:46,833
Perhaps, not something you'd understand.

518
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:50,041
- Well, Enola, if you need help...
- I do not.

519
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:54,583
Should my problem become horticultural,
I shall seek you out.

520
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:57,166
Right.

521
00:29:57,583 --> 00:30:00,250
Well, you know where to find me

522
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:03,500
should a plant go missing.

523
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:05,583
I hope you enjoy your breakfast.

Yeah.

[whispering] Is he looking back?

00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:22,458
[in normal voice] Oh. Good, he isn't.

528
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,250
I don't come here every day.

529
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:28,791
Just on days when I feel a need.

530
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:33,833
And sometimes he doesn't take this path.
Sometimes he takes the parallel one.

Give her a search, inspector.

638
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:41,875
Superintendent Grail, you can't believe...

639
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:44,333
What can't I believe, missy?

640
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:47,625
That young ladies
don't have the hands for killing?

641
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:48,750
Now, give them here.

642
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,750

- [Grail] After her, all of ya!

648
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,375
Why ever would she ever do that?

649
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:14,708
- [policeman] Get out of the way! Move!
- [woman shrieks]

- [policeman] Stop that girl!

You've seen this before.

652
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:28,416
Ah. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.
You remember me, I hope.

653
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,958
We're looking for your sister.
She's caused a bit of trouble.

Is it, sir?

00:37:58,708 --> 00:37:59,875
Is it?

661
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:02,125
Take it. I have others.

662
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:03,958
Take it? I can't. [chuckles]

663
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:05,083
I can.

664
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:06,166
I can't.

665
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,000
Perhaps I can.

And this, the famous fiddle?

00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:21,291
That I do not have two of.

671
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:25,416
Perhaps you can explain
what you believe Enola has done.

672
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,416
I wish I was at liberty to say, sir.

673
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,083
Do you mind?

Oh, your latest case.

678
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:45,041
What's it concerning?

679
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,708
Is it another Brixton Strangler?

680
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:49,458
Or a Periwinkle?

681
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:52,458
Don't tell me it's a Clerkenwell.

682
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:54,416
What evidence do they have
against my sister?

683
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,166
Perhaps, uh, you tell me yours
and I'll tell you mine.

684
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:02,750
Government case, some missing money.

- Just following orders, Mr. Holmes.

Or may I call you Sherlock?

689

Graydon. Graydon Lestrade.

and it is rather.

Right.

Whoa! [groans]

00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:54,333
My mistake.
I should have warned you I was opening it.

No.

[jaunty music fades]

710
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,875
Good afternoon.

711
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:15,208
May I ask a favor?

712
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:17,166
[jaunty music plays]

713
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:23,333
Never mind. Tell me everything.

714
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:25,708
- A government case?
- No.

715
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:28,916
[Lestrade] <i>Is it
another Brixton Strangler?</i>

716
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:32,125
Or... Or a Periwinkle?

"You tell me yours
and I'll tell you mine."

718
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:38,500
He's a ninny. I needed to know
what he had on you.

719
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:46,083
Money. Unaccounted transfers
going in and out of government offices.

720
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:49,458
My theory is either bribery,
extortion, or blackmail.

721
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:50,875
And what have you found?

722
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:54,750
Separate filings
from five different accounts

723
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:58,041
going via the Treasury
into one private bank.

724
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:00,791
- So someone is getting rich from this?
- Yes.

725
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,166
[intriguing music plays]

726
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,041
- Who?
- No name.

727
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:05,541
Just a number.

728
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:08,583
I visited the bank and inquired.
The money disappeared,

729
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,833
arriving at another bank,
and then another,

730
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:13,083
and another, and another,
and another, and another.

731
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:16,833
Every one of them hidden
using different account numbers.

732
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:18,083
Twenty-seven in total.

733
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:21,583
- Well, what can you deduce from that?
- Three things.

734
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:25,916
Firstly, the man's a game player,
perhaps a genius in mathematics,

735
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,083
capable of covering his traces
at every turn.

736
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:30,541
Secondly, the sources are varied.

737
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:33,958
Five banks, south of the river,
but no clear link between them.

738
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:35,875
All anonymous.

739
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:39,125
All going into one pocket.

740
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:41,541
And the third?

741
00:41:44,791 --> 00:41:45,875
He knows I'm onto him.

742
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:48,250
What? How?

743
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:51,833
Every time I pull a thread,
it loosens, vanishes,

744
00:41:51,916 --> 00:41:54,625
reappears somewhere else.
He's leading me a merry dance.

745
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:55,708
It's...

746
00:41:57,958 --> 00:41:58,958
It's infuriating.

747
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:02,083
So no leads whatsoever?

748
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:04,416
One. A week before the first transfer,

749
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,180
there was a break-in
at the Treasury office

750
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,708
by a man in a taper crown hat.

751
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:08,916
[Enola] A taper crown hat.

752
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:10,875
- What was taken?
- A document.

753
00:42:10,958 --> 00:42:13,666
They won't talk about it.
Sensitive information presumably.

754
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:18,000
But how it connects to all of this
has so far eluded me.

755
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:21,000
Your turn. I hope the blood's not yours.

756
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,500
I'm looking for a girl, Sarah Chapman.

757
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,041
Her sister employed me. Bessie.

758
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:31,458
She worked at Lyons match factory by day,
and the music hall at night.

759
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:33,375
She has a lover,

760
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:36,291
whose flat I visited.

761
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,041
He'd given her this.

762
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:43,666
28 Bell Place?

763
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:46,458
Whitechapel, yes.

764
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:48,791
And there I found her friend,

765
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:51,083
murdered.

766
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,541
And who killed her? This poppy fellow?

767
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:03,041
I suspect so.

768
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:05,791
Perhaps he kidnapped Sarah
and her friend discovered it.

769
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:08,041
[scoffs] Love.

770
00:43:09,041 --> 00:43:10,250
What it does to people.

771
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:14,351
- How was she killed?
- A kitchen knife.

772
00:43:14,416 --> 00:43:15,875
- Did you touch this weapon?
- No.

773
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:18,833
Then why did you run?

774
00:43:18,916 --> 00:43:20,500
I found more evidence on her.

775
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:22,416
This policeman wanted it.

776
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,333
- He has this walk.
- Grail.

777
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:27,250
We have a history.

778
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:30,375
[Enola] This was in her pocket.

779
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:34,666
[Sherlock sighs]

780
00:43:41,958 --> 00:43:43,583
[slow fiddle music plays]

781
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:52,250
It's as bad as the poem.

782
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:55,625
- Leave it with me.
- No.

783
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:58,333
It's mine, and it's important.

784
00:43:59,666 --> 00:44:03,041
Grail said she had stolen something
and that she was blackmailing them.

785
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:06,916
- Though Sarah wouldn't do that.
- You don't know this person.

786
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:09,083
I feel I do.

787
00:44:09,916 --> 00:44:11,958
You came here running from the police.

788
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:13,791
Someone is already dead,

789
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:16,125
and you are now a suspect
in a murder case.

790
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:18,166
You've let your emotions
get the better of you.

791
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:21,583
Stay here. Don't leave.
I will look into this.

792
00:44:21,666 --> 00:44:25,541
But Sarah Chapman is my responsibility.
No one else cares for these girls.

793
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:27,666
I promised her sister.

794
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,541
The first mistake a detective makes

795
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:33,250
is to make it about themselves
and not the case.

796
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:43,416
Enola, I know you're not a fan
of unnecessary advice,

797
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,875
but please...

798
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
[sighs]

799
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:49,125

00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,041
Thank you for the lesson.

964
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:18,208
It's a lesson hard learned.

965
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:24,166
Without power, we women
must rely on our wits for our fortune,

966
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:27,375
because our chances are short. Here.

967
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:29,083
Take my fan.

968
00:54:30,291 --> 00:54:31,583
I have no use for it.

969
00:54:33,083 --> 00:54:35,958
And if you wish to speak to William,

970
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:39,541
you could always try with that.

No, not... No, not you. Oh.

973
00:55:01,541 --> 00:55:02,541
Help.

974
00:55:05,083 --> 00:55:06,458
It would be my delight.

975
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,791
Really, there's no need to be rude.

[Enola] I-I didn't mean to.

00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,291
Tewkesbury!

980
00:55:31,375 --> 00:55:33,791
- Your timing's impeccable!
- Enola?

981
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:36,791
Don't speak to me here, otherwise
you'll be thrown onto the street.

982
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:44,125
- I need you to teach me to dance.
- Teach you to dance? When?

983
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:46,250
- Teach me to dance now.
- Wh...

984
00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:48,541
You understand
I've been learning since I was five?

985
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:51,625
Good. I'd feared
you'd be a terrible teacher.

986
00:55:51,708 --> 00:55:54,375
- What are you doing here?
- I'm looking for a murderer.

987
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,416
Though I shouldn't have told you.
Forget I told you that.

988
00:55:57,916 --> 00:56:01,916
- I'm trying to save a girl's life.
- Through dance?

989
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,250
Please, Tewkesbury.

990
00:56:06,458 --> 00:56:09,083
All right. Hold your back straight.

991
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:14,125
And I'll place my hand here and here.

992
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:15,583
Oh. Yes.

993
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:17,916
Hold your arm out.

994
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:20,375
Good.

995
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:22,958
Now, I will lead and you will follow.

996
00:56:23,041 --> 00:56:25,541
- That seems like a mistake.
- Face over my shoulder.

997
00:56:27,458 --> 00:56:30,500
And now, one, two, three.

998
00:56:31,041 --> 00:56:33,166
Two, three. Two, three.

999

Four, two, three. One, two, three.

1000

Two, three.

1001
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:39,750
Good.

1002

[soft music plays]

1003
00:56:46,208 --> 00:56:48,333
You seem different since last we spoke.

1004
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:51,221
Tell me why you've been
coming to the park.

1005
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:53,291
Why... Why watch me walk to the Lords?

1006
00:56:54,125 --> 00:56:55,541
Simply keeping an eye on you,

1007
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:58,083
in case you get yourself
into any more scrapes.

1008
00:56:58,166 --> 00:57:00,625
- Getting thrown out of trains.
- Enola...

1009
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:02,875
You cannot be trusted
to take care of yourself.

1010
00:57:03,583 --> 00:57:04,458
I'm a man now.

1011

You're a man when I tell you you're a man.

1012
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:09,333
And the scrapes I find myself in
are far less visceral.

Two, three. Two, three.

1016

Look into my eyes.

1017
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,625
The rhythm is always there.

1018
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:25,541
Dancing is a trust, it's a union.

1019
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:27,250
That's why I've always loved it,

1020
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,958
even when I was being tutored by my uncle.

1021

That man likes a pork mustard pie.

1022

His breath...

1023
00:57:34,166 --> 00:57:35,166
Turn, two.

1024
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:37,833
Turn. Feel it?

1025
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:39,583
I can feel it.

1027
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:49,375
[Tewkesbury] Good.

- You dance well.
- Perhaps I have a fine teacher.

on it than I'd hoped. [chuckles]

1034

You'll need a dance card.

1035
00:58:25,416 --> 00:58:26,875
But I don't know enough.

1036

if we might have a dance this evening.

01:20:55,208 --> 01:20:57,833
Is... Is my sister gone?

1445
01:20:57,916 --> 01:20:59,500
- Like Mae?
- No.

1446
01:20:59,583 --> 01:21:00,750
- [Bessie] Is she...
- No.

1447
01:21:00,833 --> 01:21:02,333
I'm sure she's all right.

1448
01:21:02,416 --> 01:21:04,333
I'm closer to finding her.

1449
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:07,250
Doris,

1450
01:21:08,583 --> 01:21:09,666
she'll take me in.

1451
01:21:10,291 --> 01:21:12,000
She's got a spare bed now.

1452
01:21:13,916 --> 01:21:14,916
Her sister?

1453
01:21:16,291 --> 01:21:17,291
[Bessie] Dead.

1454
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:18,375
Typhus.

[sinister music plays]

1457
01:21:23,333 --> 01:21:24,333
[Enola] Dead.

1458
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:38,416
There's traces of something in this soil.

1459
01:21:41,083 --> 01:21:42,958
One has red, and one has white in it.

1460

[sinister music continues]

1461
01:21:46,416 --> 01:21:50,166
The matches you make,
when did they change from red to white?

1462
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:52,625
I dunno. Around two years ago.

1463
01:21:52,708 --> 01:21:58,541
In two years, he's turned red into black.
Or should I say red into white?

1464
01:21:59,125 --> 01:22:00,916
[Mr. Lyon] Typhus.
The plague of our times.

1465
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,583
Two years it's been killing these girls.

What are you looking at?

[music fades]

1475
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:01,875
I need your help.

1476
01:23:04,416 --> 01:23:06,166
Don't make me repeat it! May I come in?

1477
01:23:08,208 --> 01:23:11,541
Firstly, I would like to apologize
for so much.

1478
01:23:11,625 --> 01:23:14,083
I have failed
to see allies in plain sight.

1479
01:23:14,166 --> 01:23:15,250
- And I have...
- Enola.

1480
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:17,916
There's something I wish to say too.

1481
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,520
- [Enola] All right.
- If you'd just...

1482
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:29,041
All day, every day,
all I do is compromise.

1483
01:23:30,208 --> 01:23:33,476
If I vote for this lord's bill that will
allow him to pump bilge water into a lake,

1484
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,583
then he will vote for my forestry reform.

1485
01:23:35,666 --> 01:23:39,083
I want to stand up and say,
"This isn't right," but I have no allies.

1486
01:23:39,875 --> 01:23:42,500
So to do so
would be to risk all that is good,

1487
01:23:42,583 --> 01:23:45,291
so I lie awake trying to work out
which path to follow,

1488
01:23:46,166 --> 01:23:47,166
alone.

1489
01:23:48,833 --> 01:23:50,416
There is no search for a wife,

1490
01:23:51,375 --> 01:23:54,708
because politics consumes me constantly.

1491
01:23:57,625 --> 01:23:59,625
That is the speech I stored up for you.

1492
01:24:02,875 --> 01:24:03,875
You're a good man.

1493
01:24:05,166 --> 01:24:06,166
I'm a man now?

1494
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:07,750
On occasion.

1495
01:24:08,416 --> 01:24:11,500
But I understand your struggle,
because I struggle too.

1496
01:24:12,291 --> 01:24:14,250
I am sorry we cannot talk more,
because I have...

1497
01:24:14,333 --> 01:24:16,208
A case to solve?

1498
01:24:20,666 --> 01:24:22,916
The girl I'm looking for, Sarah Chapman,

1499
01:24:23,791 --> 01:24:25,541
she has proof that girls are dying

1500
01:24:25,625 --> 01:24:27,958
from the phosphorus
they work with every day.

1501
01:24:28,041 --> 01:24:31,541
And the factory
are trying to cover it up as typhus.

1502
01:24:32,583 --> 01:24:33,583
She knows it,

1503
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:36,833
and someone is going to kill her for it.

1504
01:24:36,916 --> 01:24:38,000
Then what can we do?

1505
01:24:40,333 --> 01:24:41,333
We?

1506
01:24:44,291 --> 01:24:45,458
[knocking on door]

1507
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:50,373
- Don't open it. it could be the police.
- You're still wanted by the police?

1508
01:24:50,416 --> 01:24:52,583
- Of course. I escaped jail.
- You escaped?

1509
01:24:52,666 --> 01:24:53,833
Forget I told you that.

1510
01:24:53,916 --> 01:24:54,916
[knocking continues]

1511
01:24:55,416 --> 01:24:58,500
The lights are on. If I don't answer,
they'll suspect more. Hide.

1512
01:24:58,583 --> 01:25:00,343
- [knocking continues]
- [Tewkesbury] Coming.

1513
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:04,670
- Miss Cicely.
- [Cicely] I'm sorry it's so late.

1514
01:25:04,708 --> 01:25:08,375
No, no, not at all.
I-I told you to come. I-I want to help.

1515
01:25:08,458 --> 01:25:10,625
- [Cicely] Is anyone else here?
- [Tewkesbury] No.

1516
01:25:10,708 --> 01:25:11,958
- Um...
- [Cicely] Good.

1517
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:15,458
Better we are alone, for it is imperative
that I speak with you.

1518
01:25:15,958 --> 01:25:18,541
Sir, I feel that you're a man
of great character

1519
01:25:18,625 --> 01:25:19,750
and that I can trust you.

1520
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:23,750
Which is why I fear I may have to unburden
myself, and it may prove shocking.

1521
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:24,916
[Tewkesbury] Miss Cicely...

1522
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,041
It's just, I've been wanting
to speak with you about... a relationship.

1523
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:32,416
Oh, that. Yes. Uh, perhaps
we can discuss this another time?

1524
01:25:33,458 --> 01:25:34,291
[Cicely] Please, sir.

1525
01:25:34,375 --> 01:25:37,750
I'm terribly sorry. Let me assure you,
I do share your interest.

1526
01:25:37,833 --> 01:25:40,291
- We will talk again.
- [Cicely] Thank you.

1527
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:41,458
[door closes]

1528
01:25:43,291 --> 01:25:45,625
She's gone. She was flustered.

1529
01:25:48,458 --> 01:25:51,291
Do not think of doubting me.
Cicely was here for my help.

1530
01:25:51,875 --> 01:25:55,000
She told me at the ball that she's working
on a bill to change factory law.

1531
01:25:56,333 --> 01:25:58,833
She's unearthed something,
some corruption or other.

1532
01:25:59,458 --> 01:26:00,708
She's doing what?

1533
01:26:00,791 --> 01:26:02,250
[intriguing music plays]

1534
01:26:05,291 --> 01:26:09,125
Enola, if you have any concerns,
I tell you categorically, I...

1535
01:26:09,208 --> 01:26:10,875
I have no eyes for anyone, but...

1536
01:26:12,541 --> 01:26:14,666
Well, no, this is not
quite how I wanted to say that.

1537
01:26:15,708 --> 01:26:18,583
But to say,
in terms of romantic interests,

1538
01:26:19,083 --> 01:26:21,250
yes, my interest is...

1539
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:24,517
The reason I don't have to search,
I'm busy with politics, like I said...

1540
01:26:24,541 --> 01:26:25,981
[Cicely] <i>You admire Lord Tewkesbury?</i>

1541
01:26:26,041 --> 01:26:28,666
I hear he is a good man
and a great reformer.

1542
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:31,125
The woman I would be most interested in...

1543
01:26:31,208 --> 01:26:32,583
I mustn't lose my chance.

1544
01:26:33,916 --> 01:26:34,916
You're not listening.

1545
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,791
Good evening, Lord Tewkesbury.

1546
01:26:36,875 --> 01:26:38,583
She didn't have a chaperone.

I have missed everything.

1552
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:52,208
She's probably under your nose.

[groans]

1560

Enola, did you understand what I said?

1561
01:27:20,083 --> 01:27:24,083
Or rather what I didn't say?
Did you understand... what I didn't say?

1562
01:27:24,166 --> 01:27:26,375
Yes. You were saying that you...

[Tewkesbury] <i>You'll learn.</i>

1565
01:27:37,041 --> 01:27:40,833
That message
you sent me with the fan at the ball,

1566
01:27:40,916 --> 01:27:41,916
what did it mean?

1567
01:27:45,666 --> 01:27:46,708
It means I love you.

Of course.

1571
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,333
They were working together, in love.

1572
01:28:09,458 --> 01:28:10,833
They had a plan.

1573
01:28:12,208 --> 01:28:16,583
To expose the corruption in that factory
and stop what his father was doing.

1574
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:18,625
They wanted your help.

William Lyon invited you to that ball.

1576

He's a radical just like you.

1577
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:25,166
They needed my help. You're right.

1578
01:28:25,958 --> 01:28:27,750
But, Enola, we must return inside.

1579

The police are pursuing you,
and we have much to talk of.

No! I know we have much to talk of,
my dear, dear lord.

You love me.

And as it turns out, I love you too.

If anyone comes,

I am a lord.

Then they'll likely believe you.

[tool clatters]

- How ridiculous you are.
- [Sherlock] I'm ridiculous?

1607
01:30:15,833 --> 01:30:18,000
I told you to stay safe and stay away.

1608

Now you're breaking out of prison
and have the police after you.

Oh. Are you hurt? I am sorry.

Are you not hurt?

1611

It seems not.

Hm.

1613
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:32,583
I wonder who taught you
to fight like that.

1614
01:30:33,333 --> 01:30:35,083
Another thing our mother
has to answer for.

1615

She should have fed me as well as you
is what I think.

1616

Hang on. Why are you here?
Is it my case, or your own?

1617
01:30:42,041 --> 01:30:45,416
Both. I know how Grail
got your fingerprints.

1618

Oxidized phosphorus dust

You're innocent.

1621

You doubted it?

1622
01:30:55,791 --> 01:30:57,541
Nothing's certain till it's proved.

And your case?

1624

[Sherlock] My adversary, his trail,

And my thief in a taper crown hat.

Stay unemotional. There's nothing more
we can do for him now.

1633

Need to keep our minds fresh
and our eyes sharp.

[Enola] He was seized.

1635
01:32:07,583 --> 01:32:10,500
- [Sherlock] Yes, and searched.
- [Enola] For the document he took?

1636
01:32:11,833 --> 01:32:12,833
A knife?

1637
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:14,250
No, bigger.

1638
01:32:15,833 --> 01:32:16,833
A cutlass.

1639

Heavy boot scuffs,

But at whose behest?

1644
01:32:30,916 --> 01:32:32,666
There was another in this room.

1645
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:34,333
This cigar had a holder.

[intense music continues]

1647

And traces of wool.

1648

[Sherlock] Astrakhan, the finest.

1649
01:32:44,708 --> 01:32:49,083
[Mr. Lyon] Well, Lord McIntyre,
if I, um, might suggest a little lunch.

[William] <i>Leave me be, please.
They're watching.</i>

1651
01:32:56,583 --> 01:32:58,041
Where did William steal from?

1652
01:32:58,541 --> 01:33:00,583
- The Treasury Office?
- Yes.

1653
01:33:00,666 --> 01:33:03,333
The office of Lord McIntyre,
Treasury Minister.

1654
01:33:03,916 --> 01:33:05,166
How did you come to that?

1655
01:33:06,375 --> 01:33:08,500
I think what William stole was proof

1656
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:11,500
that Lyon and McIntyre
were conspiring together.

1657
01:33:12,583 --> 01:33:14,208
- Corruption.
- [Enola] Yes.

1658
01:33:14,291 --> 01:33:16,041
Fueled by greed.

1659
01:33:16,708 --> 01:33:20,083
McIntyre has been secretly profiting
from the factory.

1660
01:33:20,166 --> 01:33:23,041
They changed the match formula
to a cheaper phosphorus,

1661
01:33:24,541 --> 01:33:25,708
and it's deadly.

- Stay unemotional.

- Lord McIntyre.

- No.
- But it all fits.

No one has sat in this chair.
No marks on the carpet, no indentation.

The cigar has been smoked, but cold.

And look, no ash.

- No lips have touched that glass.
- [Sherlock] Exactly.

These clues
have been planted for us to find,

By who?

1678

Not McIntyre, but by someone who had
a lot to lose without that document.

1679

Someone who knew what they were up to
and was blackmailing them.

My opponent.

Someone who likes a game.

- Did they get what they wanted?
- [Sherlock] No, I don't think so.

Fine. Can you teach me to fight?

What, right now? In a carriage?

to change the phosphorus.

1924
01:48:48,666 --> 01:48:50,916
but things got out of hand,

1925
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,208
so you tried to point us to Lord McIntyre.

1926
01:48:54,208 --> 01:48:56,083
A rare misstep in your game...

1927
01:48:58,125 --> 01:48:59,166
Moriarty.

[sinister music plays]

1929
01:49:06,291 --> 01:49:10,833
Such a shame our divertissement
has to end, Mr. Holmes.

1930
01:49:12,083 --> 01:49:16,208
I was so enjoying it.

1931
01:49:17,791 --> 01:49:20,416
And you, Enola. [chuckles]

1932
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:24,458
Miss Troy, you have been behind this?

1933
01:49:25,916 --> 01:49:29,333
Of course, you never can find
the proper staff.

1934
01:49:30,041 --> 01:49:31,750
I only wanted the agreements back.

1935
01:49:32,708 --> 01:49:35,333
Though I couldn't be seen
to question William myself,

1936
01:49:35,416 --> 01:49:37,291
you were so obliging.

1937
01:49:39,083 --> 01:49:43,166
If you wish to speak with William,
you could always try with that.

1938
01:49:43,750 --> 01:49:46,125
[sinister music continues]

1939
01:49:46,875 --> 01:49:51,041
[Miss Troy] Just a pity he was smarter
and braver in the end than I'd expected.

1940
01:49:51,125 --> 01:49:55,666
They both were.
Their deaths were so unnecessary.

1941
01:49:56,291 --> 01:50:02,958
But Superintendent Grail
was somewhat of a blunt instrument.

1942
01:50:03,541 --> 01:50:04,958
[McIntyre] You!

1943
01:50:05,041 --> 01:50:07,875
How dare you take advantage
of your position!

1944
01:50:10,833 --> 01:50:13,166
I take advantage?

1945
01:50:14,875 --> 01:50:17,583
What were my advantages?

1946
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,833
Treated like a common servant
when I have twice the mind of yours.

1947
01:50:24,958 --> 01:50:26,416
Any of yours.

1948
01:50:28,833 --> 01:50:32,625
Why shouldn't I have a share
of your ill-begotten riches

1949
01:50:32,708 --> 01:50:35,125
and punish you at the same time?

1950
01:50:36,208 --> 01:50:39,458
Why shouldn't I be rewarded
for what I can do?

1951
01:50:40,791 --> 01:50:46,041
Where is my place in this... society?

1952
01:50:46,750 --> 01:50:48,416
I am a woman.

1953
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,833
I cannot join clubs,

1954
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:52,583
I cannot own shares,

1955
01:50:52,666 --> 01:50:55,583
I cannot advance myself as they can.

1956
01:50:56,791 --> 01:50:57,791
So...

1957
01:51:00,416 --> 01:51:03,000
I found my own way.

1958
01:51:05,375 --> 01:51:10,125
[inhales] And it was fun.

Yes, sir.

1964
01:51:23,041 --> 01:51:24,041
On what charge, sir?

1965
01:51:24,958 --> 01:51:26,833
- Extortion.
- Uh, yes, yes.

1966
01:51:26,916 --> 01:51:27,916
Blackmail, murder.

1967
01:51:28,750 --> 01:51:29,750
Go.

1968
01:51:30,083 --> 01:51:33,708
Such a shame our little dance has to end.

1969
01:51:35,041 --> 01:51:36,666
For now at least.

1970
01:51:36,750 --> 01:51:38,833
Perhaps we shall take to the floor again.

No!

[McIntyre] Well, there. That's that then.

1975
01:51:56,166 --> 01:51:59,166
I accidentally burnt my own property.
What of it?

1976
01:52:00,458 --> 01:52:03,041
You are corrupt, sir.

1977
01:52:03,125 --> 01:52:05,833
And complicit in the deaths
of hundreds of match girls.

1978

Where is your proof?

[haunting music plays]

1980

[McIntyre] Good.

01:52:11,375 --> 01:52:14,958
So... back to business.

and we have the truth.

[Sarah] A few weeks ago,

Mae Izley, William Lyon, and I

2008
01:53:55,750 --> 01:53:57,375
set out to prove something.

To prove that this factory
was killing people,

2010
01:54:02,791 --> 01:54:03,958
and they knew it.

2011
01:54:04,041 --> 01:54:07,458
But they decided that profit
mattered more than we did.

- You're coming with me.
- [Enola] Shh!

It ain't typhus that's killing us.
It's the phosphorus.

the only thing we have. Ourselves.

01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:49,250
It's time for us to refuse to work.

It's time to tell 'em no.

- Right, get back to work.
- [Enola] No!

You leave here, there is no coming back.

You will not get employed here again.

Well, will you join me?

Don't do it, girls.

It is not worth the risk.

01:58:37,291 --> 01:58:39,916
And what will people pay you in?
Potatoes and gratitude?

2088
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,333
If that's all they have.

2089
01:58:41,416 --> 01:58:44,541
You can deal with the hoits and toits.
This is where I should be.

2090
01:58:45,125 --> 01:58:47,125
Edith said she'll be kind with the rent.

2091
01:58:48,750 --> 01:58:54,291
You know, you are aware, should you wish
some finer surrounds, I could, uh...

2092
01:58:54,375 --> 01:58:55,375
[clicks tongue]

2093
01:58:56,416 --> 01:58:57,416
I was thinking...

2094
01:59:00,250 --> 01:59:01,416
Holmes and Holmes?

2095
01:59:04,250 --> 01:59:05,250
A partnership?

2096
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,958
[heartwarming music plays softly]

2097
01:59:09,041 --> 01:59:11,041
That is the kindest offer.

2098
01:59:12,333 --> 01:59:15,458
But if I did that,
I would always be in your shadow.

2099
01:59:16,250 --> 01:59:17,458
Hm. Yes.

2100
01:59:21,833 --> 01:59:24,083
Though I do like this new version of you.

2101
01:59:24,875 --> 01:59:26,708
No one should be alone all the time.

2102
01:59:28,083 --> 01:59:29,375
A friend would do you well.

2103
01:59:31,875 --> 01:59:33,541
Perhaps I should write that down.

2104
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:39,375
I shall drop by to check on you.

2105
01:59:40,041 --> 01:59:41,125
I would like that.

2106
01:59:41,916 --> 01:59:45,125
Perhaps you could come to Baker Street
from time to time...

2107
01:59:47,208 --> 01:59:48,208
to check on me.

2108
01:59:52,416 --> 01:59:56,000
Perhaps we can fix on Thursday, 4 p.m.

2109
01:59:56,916 --> 01:59:58,166
Thursday at 4:00 it is.

2110
02:00:00,666 --> 02:00:03,416
It seems I shan't be the last
to interrupt you today.

2111
02:00:05,625 --> 02:00:06,625
And he has flowers.

2112
02:00:07,791 --> 02:00:08,833
[Enola chuckles awkwardly]

2113
02:00:09,500 --> 02:00:11,666
- [Tewkesbury] Sherlock.
- Tewkesbury.

2114
02:00:11,750 --> 02:00:14,041
- See you on Thursday.
- [Tewkesbury] Bye, Sherlock.

2115
02:00:15,541 --> 02:00:16,541
[Enola giggles]

2116
02:00:19,750 --> 02:00:20,750
[Edith clears throat]

2117
02:00:23,208 --> 02:00:24,375
- [Edith] Sherlock?
- Yes.

2118
02:00:24,458 --> 02:00:25,458
Your paper.

2119
02:00:26,250 --> 02:00:27,250
Thank you.

2120
02:00:27,666 --> 02:00:28,666
And...

2121
02:00:30,125 --> 02:00:32,666
thank you... for everything.

2122
02:00:38,458 --> 02:00:39,458
[clears throat]

2123
02:00:39,916 --> 02:00:42,125
[intriguing music playing]

2124
02:00:49,875 --> 02:00:51,625
[newspaper rustles]

2125
02:00:51,708 --> 02:00:54,708
[Enola] Tewkesbury, when did I give you
the impression that I like flowers?

2126
02:00:54,791 --> 02:00:57,458
They're called Spreading Bellflowers.
Wild, of course.

2127
02:00:58,041 --> 02:01:00,791
Attracted to ancient woodland,
wiry, deceptive,

2128
02:01:01,458 --> 02:01:03,458
refuse to behave according to any rules,

2129
02:01:03,541 --> 02:01:07,958
but their petals are so delicate,
and their flowers...

2130
02:01:08,041 --> 02:01:09,041
Two things.

2131
02:01:09,083 --> 02:01:12,041
Your metaphor is tortured,
and I don't have delicate petals.

2132
02:01:12,125 --> 02:01:13,500
[Tewkesbury] Oh, and, and, and...

2133
02:01:14,916 --> 02:01:18,166
It is an invitation to a ball
being given by...

2134
02:01:18,250 --> 02:01:22,333
Uh, I am not going to a ball with you.
I got arrested at the last one.

2135
02:01:23,666 --> 02:01:26,875
Well, all the more reason to dance again,
wouldn't you say?

2136
02:01:26,958 --> 02:01:30,083
- [Enola] You're a nincompoop.
- [Tewkesbury] And you are a coward.

2137
02:01:30,166 --> 02:01:33,041
[Enola] How dare you speak to a lady
like that? You are a disgrace, sir.

2138
02:01:33,125 --> 02:01:35,250
[Tewkesbury] And yet
you still hold my arm.

2139
02:01:36,041 --> 02:01:37,958
[Enola] And yet I still hold your arm.

2140
02:01:39,791 --> 02:01:42,250
[uplifting music plays]

2141
02:01:51,666 --> 02:01:54,750
[uplifting music continues triumphantly]

2142
02:02:02,166 --> 02:02:04,500
- [uplifting music stops suddenly]
- [film reel whirring]

2143
02:02:04,583 --> 02:02:05,750
[clock chiming]

2144
02:02:09,041 --> 02:02:11,458
[chiming continues]

2145
02:02:12,166 --> 02:02:13,375
[knocking on door]

2146
02:02:18,250 --> 02:02:19,291
[man] Sherlock Holmes?

2147
02:02:20,166 --> 02:02:21,291
Yes.

2148
02:02:22,166 --> 02:02:23,583
I'm here for my appointment.

2149
02:02:25,458 --> 02:02:26,498
You're seeking a flatmate?

2150
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,125
- You must have the wrong address.
- Really?

2151
02:02:32,958 --> 02:02:35,958
The young lady was very clear
as to the place a-and the time.

2152
02:02:37,208 --> 02:02:39,166
- "Thursday at 4:00," she said.
- [sighs]

2153
02:02:39,250 --> 02:02:41,000
- [man] You are Sherlock Holmes?
- Hm.

2154
02:02:42,708 --> 02:02:43,708
Yes.

2155
02:02:44,791 --> 02:02:46,791
Please, do come in, Mr...?

2156
02:02:46,875 --> 02:02:47,875
Doctor.

2157
02:02:48,791 --> 02:02:49,791
Watson.

2158
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:51,625
John Watson.

2159
02:02:51,708 --> 02:02:57,625
[uplifting music resumes]

2160
02:03:23,083 --> 02:03:25,666
[uplifting music continues]

2161
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,541
[uplifting music continues]

2162
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:17,958
[music fades to silence]

2163
02:04:18,041 --> 02:04:18,958
[explosion]

2164
02:04:19,041 --> 02:04:21,500
[thrilling orchestral music playing]

2165
02:05:48,458 --> 02:05:52,125
[thrilling music intensifies]

2166
02:06:27,041 --> 02:06:29,041
[thrilling music fades]

2167
02:06:36,583 --> 02:06:41,666
[gentle instrumental music playing]

2168
02:07:34,333 --> 02:07:39,250
[gentle music continues]

2169
02:08:45,250 --> 02:08:47,250
[music fades to silence]
