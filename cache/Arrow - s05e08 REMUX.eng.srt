1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,255
Previously on
Arrow and The Flash...

2
00:00:05,548 --> 00:00:07,300
Guys, this isn't a meteor.

3
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:11,470
We've been calling them
the Dominators.

4
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,682
We learned they were abducting humans
to gather intel about us.

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,018
If they decide to attack,
no military can stop them.

6
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:18,945
- You can't do this alone.
- I don't plan to.

7
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:20,646
Guys! Thanks for coming.

8
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:22,332
Barry, I thought
you were bringing an alien?

9
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,693
This is my friend,
Kara Danvers. Supergirl.

10
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:28,696
Call Lyla, tell her these Dominators
aren't here peacefully.

11
00:00:53,638 --> 00:00:55,181
So, how was your run?

12
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,559
You know how it was,
I told you about it in the shower.

13
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,063
Here you go.

14
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:07,360
- How could I forget?
- Hmm.

15
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,613
Dinah Laurel Lance,

16
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:15,326
will you marry me?

17
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,454
I think I already answered that question.

18
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:20,164
Right.

19
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:30,132
Okay, time to get ready,
my sister will be here soon.

20
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:52,405
Any word from Felicity?

21
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:55,324
Only that Oliver, John, and Thea
have been abducted by aliens.

22
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:57,451
She actually made that sound normal.

23
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,788
I got every traffic cam from here
to Central City looking for them.

24
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:03,395
Yeah, like traffic cams are gonna
help against alien invaders.

25
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,251
You know what, it'll probably help more

26
00:02:05,418 --> 00:02:07,218
than you trying to pretend
to be Oliver Queen.

27
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:09,380
Nothing to pretend about.
Gotta keep in shape,

28
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:11,947
so when these ETs show up,
I can kick their collective asses.

29
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:14,218
Yeah, you'll have better luck
on the salmon ladder.

30
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:18,264
My whole life, I've waited to see
a sign of intelligent life.

31
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:19,807
Now that I'm seeing it,

32
00:02:19,974 --> 00:02:21,934
they're not intelligent at all,
they're just mean.

33
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:23,227
I can't believe it.

34
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:24,770
Try to start.

35
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,982
Guys, this is Cisco Ramon,
of S.T.A.R. Labs.

36
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:29,608
Curtis. Big fan.

37
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,652
- Rene Ramirez.
- Rory Regan.

38
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:35,031
Okay. Curtis, you're tall.

39
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:37,908
Rene, and Rory.

40
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:41,245
That's two Rorys I know now.
The other one, he's a douche though.

41
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,227
- You're not a douche, are you?
- No.

42
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:46,208
Okay. Good,
I just had to make sure, right?

43
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,711
Guys, we have to find Oliver and company,

44
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,797
and I'm not talking about the cherished
Disney animated film

45
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:54,967
starring Billy Joel, okay?
I'm talking, I gotta vibe, all right?

46
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,112
I need something to vibe off of,
something personal?

47
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:58,971
I got one of his old bows here somewhere.

48
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,514
That'll do.

49
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:02,600
Um, for those of us
who don't know you as well,

50
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:04,077
not me, 'cause I feel like
we're best friends,

51
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,287
and we've known each other
for a long time.

52
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:07,355
Uh, what are you going to do exactly?

53
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,857
Oh, right. Uh, I'm about to vibe.

54
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,818
It's this thing I do
where I touch something,

55
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,487
I can not only see the past,

56
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,281
I can see the future,
but most importantly,

57
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,992
I can see where people are.

58
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,954
So you're one of them, a meta-human.

59
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:25,956
Yeah.

60
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,958
Don't sound too excited about it.

61
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,879
Okay, so this is it.
Just, please don't break it.

62
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:34,715
Any more than it already is broken.
Okay, go.

63
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:56,987
I saw them.

64
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,573
They were in some kind
of stasis, like a ship.

65
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:02,118
It's a little Alien,

66
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:05,079
a little Star Trek, J.J. Abrams style,
and a whole lot of tech.

67
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:06,872
- You said tech!
- Yes, I said tech.

68
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,834
It's an alien spaceship, Felicity,
these guys aren't amateurs.

69
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,129
I think where she's going is,
if we had some,

70
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:15,756
we might be able download
some intel off it, like,

71
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,174
including everyone's location.

72
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:18,759
- Yes!
- Hold, please.

73
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:21,512
- Yes.
- Yes.

74
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:22,864
- That's what I meant.
- In fact.

75
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,568
- Thank you. Always got my back.
- Of course, yeah. Of course, I do.

76
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,017
What about this?

77
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,812
I took it off the Dominator ship
that crashed in Central City.

78
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:32,064
- What?
- We're gonna hack alien tech.

79
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,483
This is seriously the best day
of my entire life!

80
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:38,167
You didn't have to get me a gift, Speedy.

81
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:40,573
It's just a little
pre-rehearsal dinner gesture.

82
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:45,953
- Well, "little" is right.
- It's called a "Hozen."

83
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,540
It symbolizes reconnecting,
like you did with Laurel.

84
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,000
Thea, it's a rock.

85
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:54,962
It's a very thoughtful gesture
from your amazingly loving sister.

86
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:57,381
- Thank you.
- Yeah, that's better.

87
00:04:58,382 --> 00:04:59,550
Wow. What's going on here?

88
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:01,802
Thea gave me a rock.

89
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,388
Let's go, champ,

90
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:07,391
we got a 6:00 appointment
at the tailors, gotta fight traffic.

91
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:09,477
Oh, Dad, you know
I'm not much of a fighter.

92
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,354
Tell that to the paparazzo you punched.

93
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:14,315
- Ten years ago!
- Still.

94
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:16,150
Might as well be a lifetime.

95
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,778
You're practically
a completely different person.

96
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:21,489
You both are.

97
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,407
Don't start crying again, Momma,

98
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,534
just save all the tears
for the actual wedding.

99
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:28,746
I think what your mother's trying to say,
is that both of us feel blessed

100
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:31,373
to have watched the two of you grow up.

101
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,881
Whoa! Sweet reflexes.

102
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,008
God.

103
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,678
How much luggage did you bring?

104
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,056
Thank you.

105
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:49,141
What do you think, you're moving in?

106
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,478
I wish.

107
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,483
- I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

108
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:59,693
This is beautiful.

109
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,945
Thanks.

110
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,238
Ollie got it for me.

111
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,365
- Is it a bird?
- It's a canary.

112
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:08,744
Sara?

113
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,250
I just really missed you.

114
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:19,213
A tux is a good look on you.

115
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,173
Never really felt like my thing.

116
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,343
Maybe you'd be more comfortable
in a suit and tie.

117
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:25,719
Dad, come on.

118
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,264
I get sworn in as Mayor
in less than two months.

119
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:32,059
I don't have time to find a
replacement CEO for Queen Consolidated.

120
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,352
What about, um...

121
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:35,271
Walter Steele?

122
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:40,359
The Board won't back him.
Besides, QC is a family company.

123
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:41,860
It should stay in the family.

124
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,822
Dad, I wanna make my own name.

125
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,824
I don't just wanna rely on yours.

126
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:48,635
Oliver, if you don't do it,
the Board's gonna push

127
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,869
to accept Ray Palmer's buyout offer.

128
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,122
- I...
- What?

129
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:55,124
I don't know.

130
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,338
- Excuse me.
- Excuse yourself.

131
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,216
Watches, wallets, phones.

132
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,510
What're you, deaf?
Trying to catch a bullet?

133
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,530
- Take it easy.
- I'll shoot your ass right here.

134
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:09,638
Hey!

135
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:12,558
- Get away from him.
- You want a piece of this?

136
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,198
Are you all right?

137
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:30,534
Yeah.

138
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:32,244
You could've been killed.

139
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:34,872
Why would you do a thing like that?

140
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,050
Wow. Mom is totally gonna freak out.

141
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,310
That's probably why
she doesn't need to know.

142
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,387
Yeah, she probably
wouldn't believe the part

143
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,264
about the guy in a hood, anyway, so.

144
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:55,559
Actually, your brother was the one
who came to my rescue first.

145
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,561
You're quite the hero, son.

146
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,025
Oh, my God.

147
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,401
I heard what happened.

148
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:05,819
Are you okay?

149
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,696
Yeah. Hey, hey.

150
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,239
I'm fine, I'm fine.

151
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,121
Oliver. Oliver, are you okay?

152
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,376
No, I'm fine, I'm...

153
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:23,087
Probably just need some air, I'm gonna...

154
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:25,089
I'll see you at the restaurant.

155
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,596
I'm so conflicted.

156
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:34,098
You know, on the one hand,

157
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,309
I get to hack
actual extraterrestrial technology.

158
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,603
But, on the other hand, ETs are real,

159
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,690
but unfortunately they're dickwads
who are gonna Kill us.

160
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,192
Don't worry, it's gonna work out.

161
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,237
You're not gonna tell me
God has a plan, are you?

162
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,613
- Well...
- Look,

163
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,741
I respect your religion and all,
I just find it a little hard to believe

164
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:55,119
that there's some divine plan
to the universe

165
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,246
which also includes space monsters.

166
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:58,455
What's that?

167
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,999
I like call it my 3PO processor.

168
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,311
"I am fluent in over six million
forms of communication."

169
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,003
And it speaks Dominator?

170
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,172
I didn't specifically program it for that,

171
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:10,801
but in my defense, I didn't know
the Dominators even existed.

172
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,469
Let's see if it works.

173
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,728
I feel like Elliot in E. T.
"It's working! It's working!"

174
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:23,147
- Your tech guy quotes movies?
- Yeah.

175
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,648
Real original.

176
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:28,527
- No, no, no.
- No, no.

177
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:33,615
What happened?

178
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,369
We made an idiot move,
that's what happened. Ow!

179
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,997
We tried to plug human tech
into a Dominator power source,

180
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,457
of course it overloaded.

181
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,083
We need a regulator, okay?

182
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,294
Something that can handle
the Dominator juice.

183
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:48,231
Van Horn Industries was working on
a prototype for NASA over a year ago.

184
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,506
Maybe they perfected it by now.

185
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:52,527
Yeah, they perfected it, all right.
So much so, somebody's already stolen it.

186
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:55,387
According to SCPD reports, it was
a doctor named Laura Washington?

187
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,347
A doctor? That doesn't make any sense.

188
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,554
It does if she's been artificially
augmenting herself with stolen technology,

189
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,603
because why would the universe
make anything easy?

190
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,689
It says here, implants give her
enhanced strength, stamina,

191
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,524
and electricity-based powers.

192
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:09,860
Well, it's nothing we can't handle.

193
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:11,945
That's everything we can't handle.

194
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,840
Come on, Felicity, I mean,
this might be our only chance

195
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,699
to find Oliver and everyone else.

196
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,006
That's why I'm calling in reinforcements.

197
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:24,208
- Oh, hey, Captain Lance.
- Hey. I was just on my way out.

198
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,542
Do you have a minute for me?

199
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,395
Yeah. Actually,
I should've called you earlier.

200
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,899
Detective Hilton told me
about what happened tonight. You okay?

201
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,632
Oh, yeah, my dad and I are fine.

202
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,134
Good, good.
Well, we got the guy in custody.

203
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,053
Because of the guy with the bow and arrow.

204
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,057
Yeah, yeah, we've been calling him
The Hood. Some kinda vigilante.

205
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,812
If I've got the time right,
your rehearsal dinner is practically now.

206
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,108
Freeze!

207
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,197
Oliver?

208
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:59,409
Do you have any leads
on who The Hood might be or...

209
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,095
This is the last thing
you should be thinking about

210
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,329
the night before your wedding.

211
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,207
Or is that what's going on here?

212
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,751
- What do you mean?
- You getting cold feet?

213
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,461
No, not at all, I promise.

214
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,713
Good, 'cause I would hate
to have to shoot you

215
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,423
for breaking my girl's heart, okay?

216
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,092
Paperwork would be hell.

217
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:18,136
In truth, I'm probably
a little bit more shaken up

218
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,025
by the whole mugging than maybe I thought.

219
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,533
Well, you know,
I got just the thing to fix that.

220
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,618
A few drinks at your rehearsal dinner.
I'm buyin', come on.

221
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:26,270
Yeah, actually, Captain Lance,
I'll meet you there.

222
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,438
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'll see you there.

223
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,277
Actually, uh, Oliver,
something I wanna say.

224
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,611
You know, um,

225
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,739
when you and Laurel were kids,
you know, teenagers,

226
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:40,450
I... Well, let's face it,
I didn't like you much.

227
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:41,743
Well.

228
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,471
Yeah, I thought you were a rich,
entitled punk.

229
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,496
I was.

230
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:48,792
But since then, Oliver,
you have grown into a hell of a man.

231
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:52,421
The kinda guy I'm proud
to have as my son-in-law.

232
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:54,840
Thank you, Captain Lance.

233
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,222
- See you at that dinner.
- I'll see you there.

234
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:58,510
All right.

235
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,275
He's not coming.

236
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:14,985
Don't worry, he'll be here.

237
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:17,988
You know Ollie's never been on time
for anything in his entire life.

238
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,949
You didn't see him earlier,
he had this look on his face,

239
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:22,576
like he was backing out.

240
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,453
No way. He loves you.

241
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:28,165
He looked like everything
that he knew was wrong.

242
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:32,461
I'm pretty sure that every guy has
that look the night before their wedding.

243
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:37,174
You know, there was a time
when I thought the two of you

244
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,634
would actually hook up.

245
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,053
You know I prefer girls.

246
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,014
Oh, hey.

247
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:47,851
Ah. Miss Lance. Hi, I'm Ray Palmer,
a business associate of Oliver's father.

248
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:49,770
I just wanted to say congratulations.

249
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:51,772
Thank you, it's really nice to meet you.

250
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:54,399
Uh, this is my sister, Sara.

251
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,653
Have we met before?

252
00:12:58,528 --> 00:12:59,655
Ray!

253
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,991
No, I think I'd remember.

254
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:06,036
You just seem very familiar.

255
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:08,956
- Excuse us.
- Yeah.

256
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,377
Are you sure you prefer girls? He's hot.

257
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:39,820
Oh, wow.

258
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,241
What the hell?

259
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,453
Hi. We have an unauthorized entry!

260
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,642
What are you doing here?

261
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,770
How did you find this place?

262
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,734
- My name is Oliver Queen...
- I know who you are.

263
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,402
Everybody knows who you are.

264
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:23,697
- How did you find this place?
- Better question is why?

265
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,532
He's getting married tomorrow.

266
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:26,992
- Get out.
- Wait...

267
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,285
Get out!

268
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:29,619
Wait, wait!

269
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,122
No one can know my secret.

270
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,543
Your name is John.

271
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,463
- What did you say?
- Your name...

272
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,631
ils John Diggle.

273
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,218
My brother needed me.

274
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,477
No. No.

275
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,105
No! No, no, no.

276
00:14:58,565 --> 00:14:59,608
Bad idea.

277
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:00,984
How do you know all this?

278
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,738
I think we've met before

279
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,199
and you were my bodyguard.

280
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,617
And you think I'm funny.

281
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:11,328
You're thinking of my brother, Andy.
He's in personal security.

282
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,622
You were in the military.

283
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,043
105th Airborne out of Kandahar.

284
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,129
Did a lot of things back then
I'm not proud of.

285
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,048
I came back here to...

286
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,051
atone, I guess.

287
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:30,764
Uh, John, stranger danger?
Might wanna ease up on the info dump.

288
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:32,933
Felicity Smoak?

289
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,397
Felicity...

290
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:42,609
This isn't right.

291
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:44,861
I don't think that any of...

292
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:48,824
of this is right.
I don't think that you're the Green Arrow.

293
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:52,452
And I don't think Andy's alive.

294
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,540
John, I think you killed him.

295
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,294
I hate being right all the time.

296
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,382
Listen to me. You're having
some kind of psychotic break.

297
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,927
Go back to your family, your fiancée,
and your fancy house,

298
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:11,263
and you're gonna forget about all of this!

299
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,392
Felicity is right,
you've got everything.

300
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:17,352
Everything, man.

301
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,438
Stop trying to throw it all away.

302
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,446
You should've taken him up on
his offer to carry you.

303
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,454
- It was awesome.
- Nobody's carrying me anywhere.

304
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,709
It's so cool Felicity reached out,
it's awesome to meet you.

305
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,336
Yeah, well, wait till you meet her.

306
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,300
Hey, everyone!

307
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,970
Oh, I've had enough of this.

308
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:02,772
Yo, you want some company?

309
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,399
Not really.

310
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:09,279
Right. Um, so, what exactly is it
you've "had enough of"?

311
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,033
Nothing. I just didn't know
there were flying meta-humans now.

312
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,534
No sign of Washington.

313
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,953
Yeah, Supergirl's not a meta,
she's an alien.

314
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:20,123
- Oh, well, I'm one of the good ones.
- There are no good ones.

315
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:21,958
Hey, what's your damage, man?

316
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:31,134
My "damage" is that people like you two
have the power of gods,

317
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,196
yet you think you can make
the world a better place

318
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,888
just by putting on a fancy costume.

319
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:38,016
No, we think we make the world
a better place because...

320
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,352
- Well, we do.
- Yeah.

321
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:41,561
Look around.

322
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,064
Moment he showed up,
metas start appearing everywhere.

323
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,149
Now you show up, and we get aliens.

324
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,318
Superpowers are evil, man,

325
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:51,571
and I don't want anything to do with them

326
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,323
or with either of you.

327
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:19,683
Thea, you have grown into
the most beautiful young woman.

328
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:24,080
It's just a bridesmaid's dress, Mom.
No one actually looks good in one.

329
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,480
Well, you do.

330
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:27,482
You look fulfilled.

331
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:29,985
Yeah, I don't know about that one, Mom,

332
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:34,155
but I do know I have never been happier.

333
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:35,782
Good.

334
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,534
- And I love you, Mom.
- Oh.

335
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:40,120
My baby girl.

336
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,371
Mmm!

337
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,540
Okay, we're gonna wrinkle the dress.

338
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:45,125
No, I really don't care.

339
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,459
Okay.

340
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,546
No! Mom!

341
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:52,882
Thea?

342
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,884
Are you okay?

343
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,886
Yeah.

344
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,225
Laurel, I...

345
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,395
Don't you know it's bad luck
to see the bride before the wedding?

346
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,147
Or skip out on the rehearsal dinner?

347
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:08,857
I know, I said I was sorry.

348
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,358
In a text.

349
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,778
Sara, can you give us
a few minutes, please?

350
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:21,119
You're lucky
I'm not a trained assassin or anything.

351
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:31,755
Oh, wow.

352
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:36,051
You, um, you look beautiful.

353
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:38,261
I called you over 20 times last night.

354
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:41,056
I can't explain last night, I just...

355
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,517
Today,

356
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,020
today I wanna marry you.

357
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,189
Well, that's good
because there are guests here...

358
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,108
No, not with guests,
not in a few hours, now!

359
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,778
Laurel, I need to get out of here.

360
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,446
- We can elope.
- Oliver...

361
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:59,213
I'm being serious, I don't know
what's going on with me right now,

362
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,619
I just know that I want to be with
you as quickly as humanly possible.

363
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,038
What is going on with you?

364
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,459
Last night, somebody reminded me

365
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,295
that I have everything,

366
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,841
and I don't wanna give it up.

367
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,677
I'm afraid that I'm gonna give it up.

368
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,847
Well, that's very sweet of you,

369
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:26,017
but we have over 200 guests coming
and your parents,

370
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:27,745
they've have spent a fortune
on this wedding.

371
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,354
I know, I'm just...

372
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:31,648
I'm sorry if this is confusing,
or if I'm scaring you,

373
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:34,692
but the only thing in the world

374
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,945
that makes sense to me right now

375
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:39,823
is that I love you.

376
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,159
And I'm gonna take that job
at Queen Consolidated,

377
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:46,621
and I swear to God,
I'm gonna work every single day

378
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:48,998
to be the man you fell in love with.

379
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:55,004
Sorry about the interruption,

380
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,251
the Russian lady downstairs told me
to come right up.

381
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,592
You got a minute to talk?

382
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,178
I'll be right back.

383
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:06,599
Now, what happened to,
"ll should just go back to my life"?

384
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,686
Well, look, have you been getting
out into the city lately?

385
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:12,772
Seeing maybe a particular building
that shouldn't be there?

386
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,566
- Smoak Technologies.
- Yeah.

387
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:17,402
Yeah, well, when I was with my dad,
I saw it, and it, felt...

388
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,320
- It felt wrong.
- Right.

389
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:24,367
Felicity Smoak says she never owned
a building or a company.

390
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:27,704
I don't know what's going on here.

391
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,307
But when you left,
I started having these...

392
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,792
Visions, right? Like, uh,

393
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,837
memory flashes, I'm getting them, too.

394
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:37,797
John, what is happening to us?

395
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,300
I have no idea. I've seen some weird
things in the 'Stan,

396
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,760
even stranger things as The Hood,
but this...

397
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:46,389
Look, when you left, I tried

398
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:50,018
to draw one of these
"memory flashes" as you call 'em.

399
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,103
I've never been much of an artist.

400
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:55,440
This is what I came up with.

401
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:00,153
- What the hell?
- I don't know.

402
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,410
I've been remembering things.
It's like they're dreams, but they're not.

403
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:06,618
John, I don't think
that any of this is real.

404
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,871
No, we're real. But whatever's playing
these head games with us,

405
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,624
- I don't think it's fully working.
- Are you sure?

406
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,709
'Cause the Queen's Gambit...

407
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,439
They've put me into a world where
I never got on my father's boat.

408
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:21,299
Oliver, I don't know if these
are memories, or feelings,

409
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:24,761
but I think you're a hero, and I don't
think it's because of any boat.

410
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,554
These head games aren't over.

411
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,891
They are gonna push back
against whatever we do.

412
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:31,518
Push back?

413
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:33,937
Like how?

414
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,443
Like that.

415
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,312
How did I do that?

416
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,733
All right, this is hard to explain.

417
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,360
Well, start trying.

418
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:23,820
We think...

419
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:27,073
We think we're in some sort
of shared hallucination.

420
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:29,534
That's crazy.

421
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:32,996
I mean, not as crazy as me knowing
kung fu, but it is definitely up there.

422
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,707
That wasn't kung fu, that was jeet kune do

423
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:38,310
and I think that you learned it
in a spot called Nanda Parbat.

424
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:41,504
Nothing you are saying is making sense,
none of this makes sense!

425
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:43,941
Okay, look. All right.
Sara, what is the last thing you remember?

426
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:46,467
- I don't know!
- I mean, before you came here, yesterday.

427
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:50,138
What is the last thing that you remember?

428
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,478
You remembered something. Come on.

429
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:59,188
Sara, come on, concentrate!

430
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,280
There was a fight.

431
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:08,990
There was five of us, and then...

432
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,367
- And then we were taken.
- Taken where?

433
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:13,620
I don't know.

434
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:16,706
All right, there were five of us.
Who were the other two?

435
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:18,541
Ray Palmer, and...

436
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,043
and, Thea.

437
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:23,713
I mean, if this some kind of dream,
or "shared hallucination,"

438
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,299
- then how do we wake up?
- By getting out of here.

439
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,926
The Smoak Technologies building,

440
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,471
maybe the reason why that place
seems so strange is because

441
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:33,431
that's the way we get out of here.

442
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:35,892
Wherever here is.

443
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,106
What do you want?

444
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:45,026
You stole something
from Van Horn Industries.

445
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:46,569
You mean this?

446
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:48,738
Yeah, hand it over.

447
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:50,198
Or what?

448
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,367
I'll take it from you.

449
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:53,951
I doubt that.

450
00:24:58,623 --> 00:24:59,999
Do you wanna give up?

451
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:03,002
I'm just getting started.

452
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:04,253
Soam I.

453
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:36,828
That was awesome.

454
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:40,998
There's the regulator. She seems pretty
attached to it.

455
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,625
Maybe just remove it?

456
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:43,918
Okay, yeah.

457
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,628
Thanks for the save.

458
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:49,006
- Is that all you have to say?
- I don't do apologies, sweetheart.

459
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:53,886
But if super-powers are a thing,

460
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:57,223
it's good there are guys like you
to help the world.

461
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,640
You know, the green guy would've kicked
my ass if I talked to him like that.

462
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:02,478
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, we know.
- That he would.

463
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:03,646
Yep.

464
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,732
_

465
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,984
It's too bad Tommy couldn't
make it, though.

466
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:11,320
Well, they've got him working triple
shifts at the hospital these days.

467
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,656
Besides, Chicago isn't exactly next door.

468
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:15,158
Can't believe he's a doctor now.

469
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,994
Well, he says the same thing about you,
Ms. "Entrepreneur."

470
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:21,164
Yeah, I don't think running Verdant
makes me an entrepreneur.

471
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:22,999
No, but it makes you successful.

472
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:25,960
Your father should be very proud
of the woman you've grown into.

473
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:28,713
Ray, I need to talk to you.

474
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,007
Sara, right?

475
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:32,717
- Yeah.
- Hi. Um...

476
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:35,052
This is my fiancée, Felicity Smoak.

477
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:37,503
Hi, nice to meet you.
Oh, you're Laurel's sister, right?

478
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:39,640
Yeah. Can I steal him for a second?

479
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:42,018
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, okay.

480
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:44,353
Ray,

481
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:46,689
doesn't this all feel weird to you?

482
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:48,691
A little.

483
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,027
I need you to think.

484
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:53,654
She's not my fiancée.

485
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,157
My fiancée's name is Anna.

486
00:26:56,908 --> 00:26:58,242
Or it was.

487
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:00,203
What's happening?

488
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:01,829
You're remembering.

489
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:09,420
Son, don't you think
you should be getting your tuxedo on?

490
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:11,380
- Um...
- Are you all right, Oliver?

491
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,007
I just need to speak with Thea.

492
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:15,927
I think I saw her talking to Malcolm
over by the ice sculpture.

493
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,720
- Yeah, okay.
- Son.

494
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:20,640
Think you need to calm down.

495
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:23,476
We both do.
You're acting terribly strange.

496
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:25,561
Your mother and I are concerned

497
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:30,233
if you keep up this unstable behavior,
that is not going to finish well.

498
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,485
That is not going to finish well.

499
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:35,696
I'm just saying.

500
00:27:35,947 --> 00:27:38,199
Laurel, the company...

501
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:40,284
This is your life now.

502
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,958
No, itisn't.

503
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:50,086
Oliver.

504
00:27:58,469 --> 00:27:59,762
I'm sorry.

505
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:08,104
Speedy.

506
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:09,480
She knows, Ollie.

507
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,649
She knows, and she doesn't wanna go.

508
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:14,193
Better question is, why would you want to?

509
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:16,821
Because none of this is real.

510
00:28:16,988 --> 00:28:18,781
It's real enough, okay?

511
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,701
It's better than our real lives,
and in this life,

512
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:25,246
Laurel is alive, my parents are alive.

513
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,164
But those are not your parents.

514
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:30,877
They remember the only lullaby that would
actually work to put me to sleep.

515
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:34,338
They remember every day of my life, okay?

516
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,799
They even smell like them, Ollie.

517
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,384
They're not them, Thea.

518
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:42,513
I want them to be,

519
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:44,974
but they're not.

520
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:49,645
Where are John and Ray?

521
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:51,314
They're waiting outside.

522
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:53,649
Give us a few minutes?

523
00:28:56,944 --> 00:29:00,698
We can't stay here, Speedy.
No matter how much we want to, we can't.

524
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:02,283
Why not?

525
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:07,163
What is waiting for us
wherever we are right now?

526
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,625
Nothing, nothing but

527
00:29:11,626 --> 00:29:13,669
pain and suffering.

528
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:16,756
Thea, we have responsibilities,
we have people who count on us.

529
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:18,341
There's Flash,

530
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:23,220
and Supergirl and people
with actual powers now.

531
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:26,432
Whatever needs to be done,
they can handle it.

532
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:29,936
We...

533
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:33,522
We finally have a chance to be happy.

534
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:39,570
I mean, why can't you just,
for a second, accept that maybe

535
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:43,199
this is your reward
for all of the sacrifices you have made?

536
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,787
I didn't make those sacrifices
for a reward, Thea.

537
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:51,540
I did what I did
because I thought it was right.

538
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:57,129
And seeing all of this has just,
it has shown me

539
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,383
that there is still so much more to do,
So, please,

540
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:05,054
I'm begging you to come with me
because I cannot do it alone.

541
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,938
I can't lose them again.

542
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:17,692
I can't lose my family.

543
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:24,907
Okay.

544
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:27,660
Okay. All right. Just...

545
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:34,542
I want you to be well,
I want you to be happy.

546
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,253
I love you, Thea.

547
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:55,938
Where's Thea?

548
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,524
Thea's staying.

549
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:00,961
Have you explained to Ray
what we have to do?

550
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:02,945
Yeah, apparently we have
to get to an office tower

551
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:05,215
that my non-fiancée doesn't own,
which is a little strange.

552
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:08,343
All that, coming from the guy who's been
having memories that he's able to shrink.

553
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,095
Well, whatever we're doing,
we have to do it fast,

554
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,888
because whatever the Dominators
have done to us,

555
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:13,622
they would've built in safeguards

556
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:17,209
that are probably manifestations from
our memories designed to keep us here.

557
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:35,644
They're not real.

558
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:39,440
Well, they certainly look real,
but let's not get into that right now.

559
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:43,277
Speedy?

560
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:45,946
Yeah, I had a change of heart, okay?

561
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:47,698
Like I said,

562
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:49,992
I can't lose my family again.

563
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:03,339
Your father's still alive, Thea.
Your real father, at least.

564
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:09,845
Unfortunately, this is gonna be
a little less satisfying for me

565
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:11,263
than killing your sister.

566
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:18,330
Ollie!

567
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:30,342
Ollie!

568
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,015
Sara, Sara,

569
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:37,433
what's going on here?

570
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,311
Laurel, look, I can't explain but.

571
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,064
I have to go. We have to go.

572
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:45,733
What?

573
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,861
No, no, no, whatever it is, we can fix it.

574
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:51,447
Look, we can't.

575
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,743
Some things you just can't fix.

576
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,001
Ollie? Ollie.

577
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,628
Ollie, what's happening?

578
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:06,837
What...

579
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:08,672
I'm sorry.

580
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,593
The person you fell in love with,

581
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:15,679
it's not me.

582
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,807
And I never deserved that love,

583
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:23,812
and you always deserved better.

584
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:27,274
Please.

585
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:33,322
I love you.

586
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:35,824
I love you. Don't... Don't go.

587
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,548
Okay, John. What now?

588
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:53,842
Guys, I don't think that belongs there.

589
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,387
Okay, that's either the way out of here,

590
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,657
or we gotta click our heels together
three times and say,

591
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:00,700
- "There's no place like home."
- And if that doesn't work?

592
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:03,227
It has to work. He's running out of time.

593
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:04,895
Come on.

594
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:12,361
You're never without me,
my beautiful boy.

595
00:35:13,696 --> 00:35:17,616
There's nothing else to say,
except I could not be more proud.

596
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:21,203
You've become someone else,
you've become something else.

597
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:24,707
You honor the dead by fighting,
and you are not done fighting!

598
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,960
I know I called you a murderer,
but you are not,

599
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,837
you are a hero.

600
00:35:30,004 --> 00:35:32,172
You saved my life.
You gave me purpose.

601
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,590
This time, we had to save you.

602
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:36,302
I know who you are
in your bones, Oliver,

603
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,012
and that person doesn't give up.

604
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,972
This is your responsibility now.

605
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,863
Where are we?

606
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,406
You all right?

607
00:35:57,573 --> 00:36:00,242
It may not be real, but it still hurts
like a son of a bitch.

608
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:01,869
Uh, guys?

609
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:05,247
There's something you really need to see.

610
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:07,958
Any luck with the regulator
we took off CyberWoman?

611
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,878
"CyberWoman"?
I think I'm starting to like you guys.

612
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:14,465
The regulator worked,
but my translator did not.

613
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:18,427
The only thing I got back
from the Dominator tech was soup.

614
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:21,055
What? What, no, no, no, no, this...

615
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:24,141
- No, this just looks random.
- It's not.

616
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:25,893
It's Gematria.

617
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:29,146
- Huh?
- Gematria is the numerology of...

618
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:31,565
Of the Torah. How did I not see that?

619
00:36:31,774 --> 00:36:35,486
For the gentiles and those of us who
actually had social lives in high school,

620
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:37,446
what the hell are you talking about?

621
00:36:37,613 --> 00:36:40,491
In Hebrew, each letter possesses
a numerical value.

622
00:36:40,783 --> 00:36:43,827
Gematria is the calculation
of the numerical equivalence

623
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:45,537
of letters, words, or phrases.

624
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:50,042
You mean the Dominators' language
is based off the Old Testament?

625
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:52,127
Or shares commonalities, at least.

626
00:36:52,795 --> 00:36:55,631
You wanted proof of a
"divine plan to the universe," right?

627
00:36:55,798 --> 00:36:58,467
Guys, I'm getting references
to five Terran captives here.

628
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:00,219
Okay, the signal is coming from...

629
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:02,388
That's not possible.

630
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:05,599
"-3.127 latitude,

631
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:08,852
"-23.7987 longitude..."

632
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:10,479
That doesn't make any sense.

633
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:12,791
Geographical coordinates
don't have any negative numbers.

634
00:37:12,815 --> 00:37:14,316
I mean, they do, only when...

635
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,487
Oh, my God, I think I know where they are.

636
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:51,061
Okay, so how do we find our way
out of an alien spacecraft?

637
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:53,772
This way. Even though
it's an alien technology,

638
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:56,150
certain principles of design
are universal.

639
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:01,572
Or not.

640
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:11,165
Ray was right,

641
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:13,667
certain principles of design
are universal.

642
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,554
You think you can fly one of these things?

643
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:27,532
I'm hoping that between
you, me, Ray, and Sara,

644
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:29,224
someone can fly one of these things.

645
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,359
Okay, now what?

646
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,652
Ray?

647
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:43,572
Um, now might be a good time
to find the owner's manual.

648
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:56,210
And Mom said I wouldn't amount
to anything if I didn't go to college.

649
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:28,176
Uh, really hope you hit autopilot 'cause
I don't see any controls on this thing.

650
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,451
Hold on, we got incoming.

651
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:30,869
How do you know?

652
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:34,289
Lucky guess?

653
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:48,178
We need to find a way to steer this thing,
or we're not gonna last very long.

654
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:13,161
Oliver, nice clothes.
Shop at an alien Gap?

655
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,831
- Not funny.
- Well, lucky for you guys,

656
00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:19,042
the Waverider has a machine that
replicates old clothes and weapons.

657
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:20,961
- Hi, I'm Nate Heywood.
- Hi! Thea.

658
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:24,840
And this is exactly twice as many
spaceships as I ever thought I'd be on.

659
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:26,508
Well, actually, it's a time-ship.

660
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:27,759
How'd you find us?

661
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,012
I didn't. Your nerd army
back on Earth did.

662
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:33,015
I'm gonna take Digg to the Medbay,
have Gideon fix him up.

663
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,558
Whoever Gideon is.

664
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:39,187
- Get out!
- Thanks for the save.

665
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:40,480
No problem.

666
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:42,107
Except for all our other problems.

667
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:43,400
Like what, Ray?

668
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,193
After we woke up,

669
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,405
I got a look at the tech the Dominators
were using to keep us under.

670
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:52,534
They're using a neuromorphic interface
similar to how I manipulate the Atom suit.

671
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:54,786
And, wait... What does that mean?

672
00:40:54,995 --> 00:40:56,163
I think,

673
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:58,999
the shared hallucination
was to keep our minds occupied

674
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:01,185
- while the Dominators...
- While the Dominators what?

675
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:03,378
Well, while they probed our subconscious.

676
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:05,047
I'm guessing, looking for intel.

677
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,717
Wait, maybe they didn't choose us
at random.

678
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:11,637
Maybe they chose us
because we couldn't fight back.

679
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,889
Because none of you are meta-humans.

680
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:15,891
Bigger question,
what intel were they after?

681
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:17,142
What is their plan?

682
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:21,688
Gesundheit!

683
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:24,399
It's what one of the Dominators
said to another.

684
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:28,070
Which sounds like the beginning
of a not so funny joke, but... Gideon?

685
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,404
Translating.

686
00:41:31,365 --> 00:41:33,742
You ever think that our lives
would really get this weird?

687
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:35,744
The phrase loosely translates to,

688
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:37,663
"We are nearing completion of the weapon.”

689
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:38,830
What weapon?

690
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,499
I'm afraid I have no idea,

691
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:43,418
but I'm tracking the Dominator mothership
you escaped from.

692
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:47,089
And it appears to be on a direct course
for Earth.

693
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:28,755
