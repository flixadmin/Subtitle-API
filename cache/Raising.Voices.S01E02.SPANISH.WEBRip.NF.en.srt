I love you too, honey.

Wow!

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,720

Alma, do you want to watch a movie?

14
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,080
We can make popcorn if you like.

15
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,200
Alma!

16
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,280
MOM: ALMA, COME HOME RIGHT NOW.
DON'T MAKE THINGS WORSE. TURN AROUND NOW!

17
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,440
Come on.

18
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,280
Get in.

19
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,680
Where's the party?

20
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,560
What?

21
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,200
You girls don't get made up like that
to go to town.

22
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,120
Where is it? Can we go with you?

23
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,360
Why don't you sit in the middle?
I'll break my neck.

24
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,840
You're much prettier up close.

25
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,040
Friends of Hernán's, right?

26
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,760
Well, we're getting to know each other.

27
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,080
What did he say about us?

28
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,000
Nothing.

29
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,240
He told us a lot about you.

30
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,320
Like what?

31
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,360
He said you used to be a thing.

32
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,240
We made out once.
That's the story of our long relationship.

33
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,320
It must have been incredible
because he never shuts up about you.

34
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
What did you do to him?

35
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,840
What's wrong?

36
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,760
Hernán told us you like a smoke.

37
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,160
I don't want to get wasted yet.

38
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,200
No.

39
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,800
It's not polite to say no.

40
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,560
Take it nice and easy, Jota.

41
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,640
Is our weed good?

42
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,800
Yeah, I like it.

43
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,920
It's got a crazy edge.

44
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,960
You feel like dancing, jumping,

45
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,640
getting naked,

46
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,640
fucking.

47
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,520
Do you feel like fucking, Alma?

48
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,040
It's really not that great.

49
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,920
Where are we going?

50
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,520
We have to go by our place first.

51
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,200
No, take me into town.

52
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,800
We have the trunk full of weed, you know?

53
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,640
Take it easy.

54
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,800
It'll just take a minute.

55
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,640
Why are we stopping here?

56
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,040
Are you scared, Alma?

57
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,520
It's just my friend will kill me
if I'm late.

58
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,120
Hernán was right.

59
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,720
You've got balls.

60
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,560
Go, Jota.

61
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,120
I'm outta here!

62
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,400
Hey, Alma, where's the party?

63
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,840
Fuck you!

64
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,320
No, please!

65
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,600
Thanks.

66
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,240
MOM: PLEASE COME HOME.
LET'S TALK.

67
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,000
Where'd you come from?
That's not your bus.

68
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,080
What happened?

69
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,520
Are you all right?

70
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,720
Your mom again.

71
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,240
Two hundred calls? I think you're busted.

72
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,240
-Sure, I know.
-"I know"?

73
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,640
-So what do I do, Alma?
-I don't know.

74
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,680
Pick up. Say you don't know where I am.

75
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,040
Put on your pajamas and brush your teeth.

76
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,200
Wait, I'll get the dinosaurs.

77
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,000
Move it. Go.

78
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,000
How was the movie?

79
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,480
Great, Mom.

80
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,080
The best we've ever seen.

81
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,640
-Right, Dad?
-Yeah, the best. Off you go.

82
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,400
-What's wrong?
-Alma's gone.

83
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,720
-How?
-Out the window.

84
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,480
What can we do with her?

85
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,280
Where's she gone?

86
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,320
-With Greta and Nata?
-She's not with Greta.

87
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,280
I just talked to her.
Nata isn't picking up.

88
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,480
-You don't have any other numbers?
-No. You?

89
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,200
-Where are you going?
-To the park.

90
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,280
-She'll be drinking and smoking weed.
-Not a good idea.

91
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,520
She's defying us. We have to do something.

92
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,360
Making a scene in front of her friends
will only make it worse.

93
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,880
It can't get any worse.

94
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,080
I had to laugh at their damn jokes.

95
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,080
So if you get pissed, you're crazy,
and a bitch if you don't.

96
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,400
Sons of bitches.

97
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,040
Let's see.

98
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,880
Your makeup is messed up. I'll fix it.

99
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,880
We're so damn late.

100
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,800
Well,

101
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,960
no worries. I texted my brother.

102
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,680
It's not that bad.

103
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,520
The next bus is in an hour, I think.

104
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,200
-All done, gorgeous.
-Okay.

105
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,120
Alma?

106
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,440
-Hi, Berta.
-Hi.

107
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,760
What are you doing here?

108
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,120
We were on our way to a party,
but we missed the bus.

109
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,600
-Right.
-Hi.

110
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,680
Do you want a drink?

111
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,760
-How did you get it?
-With my cousin's ID.

112
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,080
I stole it from her
at my grandma's funeral.

113
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,960
-Jeez, you do look like her.
-Sure, we're family.

114
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,120
Are you coming?

115
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
We need to talk.

116
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,040
We're super late,
and if we miss the bus, we won't make it.

117
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,760
We have lots of time. Where are you going?

118
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,600
Near here. Come on.

119
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,600
Come on, Gregory.

120
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,400
Let's go.

121
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,560
-I don't like it.
-It's because you have someone.

122
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,800
-It's because you have someone.
-That's not it.

123
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,400
I don't know, but...

124
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,240
-Come this Friday.
-No.

125
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,040
-I never go out on Fridays.
-You have to come.

126
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,720
-I said no.
-It's fucking great.

127
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,640
Alma!

128
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,200
I didn't mean to scare you.

129
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,560
You know Alma, right?

130
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,120
-Everyone knows Alma.
-Has she been here?

131
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,160
No.

132
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,360
Do you know where she could be?

133
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,200
Her mother and I are worried.

134
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,240
She hasn't come round today.

135
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,240
Thanks.

136
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,080
My mother had a date tonight.

137
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,920
A toast for the loser
who wants to fuck her.

138
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,080
-He should!
-Come on.

139
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,280
-Where do you live?
-In the city.

140
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,480
But we're staying at Berta's tonight.

141
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,800
Helena and Lily are my Alma and Greta
from grade school,

142
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,960
but with more of an artsy vibe.

143
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,120
You're arty for sure.

144
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,160
-One of these days, we'll be famous.
-For sure.

145
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,360
I'm going to be the greatest.

146
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,640
-I almost did art in junior high.
-Really?

147
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,880
Yeah, but then I found out
I couldn't draw for shit,

148
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,920
and that was that.

149
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,600
I'm starving. My stomach's rumbling.

150
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,240
I think I'll go buy some junk pastries.

151
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,280
Me too. Shall we buy something?

152
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,280
-Yeah. You coming?
-Sure.

153
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,680
-I'll go with you.
-No.

154
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,880
We'll be right back.

155
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,800
Stay. Don't leave me with Gregory.

156
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,200
Want some?

157
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,520
Thanks.

158
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,200
You're not wearing my necklace.

159
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,320
I left it at home.

160
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,280
But I really like your flying fish.

161
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,680
What metal was it?

162
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,760
Brass. It's important to me.

163
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,120
I'll post a photo.

164
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,000
No, I don't care.
I just want you to wear it.

165
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,920
Anyway, I have lots of ideas
for other necklaces.

166
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,920
I need molds and an oven,
but my mom's not into it.

167
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,720
You're very talented, Berta.

168
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,960
One of the teachers says
I have a creative personality.

169
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,040
And so far,

170
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,360
I fit the profile
of a teenage artist, you know?

171
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,440
Divorced parents,
alcohol and drug problems,

172
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,720
misunderstood, therapists, loneliness...

173
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,440
We had fun in high school, right?

174
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,360
Yeah.

175
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,240
Hey,

176
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,600
do you like anyone in class?

177
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,400
No.

178
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,840
You don't?

179
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,400
Well, I like you.

180
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,240
-Not in a lesbo vibe, okay?
-Right.

181
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm sure about that. I like weenies.

182
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,560
I saw my dad's once.

183
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,080
-What?
-Yeah, he thought he was alone.

184
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,360
-He was stark naked.
-God.

185
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,280
-It was really small.
-Jeez, Berta...

186
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,320
-So disappointing.
-No.

187
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Hello? Berta!

188
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,600
I'm home.

189
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,560
Wasn't your mother in the hospital?

190
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,600
What?

191
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,480
You've been saying
your mom's really sick all week.

192
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,920
You started crying in math class today.

193
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,560
I had no time to do
the shitty science homework,

194
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,640
and then everyone

195
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,920
was so nice to me and...

196
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,000
You're a goddamn liar.

197
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,200
Are you going to tell?

198
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,160
No.

199
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,880
No. I love it.

200
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,320
God, Berta, you're the best.

201
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,200
<i>Why did we stop hanging out?</i>

202
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,200
Dunno. It's normal, right?

203
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,960
You change high schools, drift apart.
It's normal.

204
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,080
Right, but Greta changed schools too,
and you still hang out on weekends.

205
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,760
Why, Alma?

206
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,160
Why did we stop being friends?

207
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,960
I don't know.

208
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,760
The bus! Hurry!

209
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,400
We'll miss it again! Hurry!

210
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
-Bye, Berta.
-Hurry.

211
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,520
Bye.

212
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,920
Hello.

213
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,920
Here.

214
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,920
Thanks.

215
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,000
What do you think?

216
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,400
Maybe she wants you as a girlfriend.

217
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,680
No, it's not that.

218
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,720
<i>-I didn't find her.
-Probably better, Pablo.</i>

219
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,720
-I went to the park, but she wasn't there.
-It's okay. Relax.

220
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,800
Her friends don't know where she is.

221
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,680
She'll be back soon.

222
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,600
She's not with any of her friends.
Where the hell is she?

223
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,960
What are you doing?

224
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,800
VERO - ALMA'S MOM
INCOMING CALL

225
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,920
-Hello?
<i>-Hi, Nata.</i>

226
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,360
-You're not with Alma by any chance?
<i>-No.</i>

227
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,080
I thought she wasn't allowed out,
that she was grounded.

228
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,360
<i>She was, but she's gone.</i>

229
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,360
<i>And...</i>

230
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,720
I need to talk to her.

231
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,080
You don't know where she is
or who she's with?

232
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,960
<i>-With Greta?</i>
-She's not with her. I called her.

233
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,880
I don't know. She's not with me.
I have no idea where she is.

234
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,680
I'm not lying to you. I'm sorry.

235
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,760
<i>Okay. Thanks, Nata.</i>

236
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,120
Bitches.

237
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,360
You went partying without me.

238
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,160
I'm not speaking to you
for a fucking month, bitches.

239
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,760
<i>You went partying without me.</i>

240
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,560
<i>I'm not speaking to you
for a fucking month, bitches.</i>

241
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,960
She'll get over it in a few days.

242
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,680
Sure, Nata gets over things quickly.

243
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,400
Yeah, she does.

244
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,280
Hurry! He'll kill me.

245
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,640
-Greta, I'll fall on my face!
-What?

246
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,400
Sorry.

247
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,200
-Here she is.
-Sorry.

248
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,360
Sorry.

249
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,640
You're over an hour late.

250
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,040
My fault, sorry.

251
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,600
Okay, here.

252
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,080
One for you, and one for you. Put them on.

253
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,080
This is the entrance.

254
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,880
I have to see people.
You guys go hang out.

255
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,080
Don't get into trouble, please.
I don't want any hassle.

256
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,040
Yes, sir.

257
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,920
One more thing.

258
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,360
You look incredible.

259
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,800
Right.

260
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,240
Thanks.

261
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,840
Ciao.

262
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,480
Okay.

263
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,000
Let's drop off our jackets.

264
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,240
-Okay.
-Okay.

265
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,600
-Then we strut our stuff.
-Perfect.

266
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,400
I'm so wired.

267
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,880
-Let's get a drink right now!
-Yes!

268
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,440
Hello.

269
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,040
Two gin lemons.

270
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,120
Great.

271
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,080
Hello.

272
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,400
Hello.

273
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,560
We're going to Mokka.

274
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,000
Buba's brother is working tonight.
Maybe we'll get free drinks.

275
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,440
Mokka is fucking miles away.
I can't go. I have to be home by 12:00.

276
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,920
-Can't you be there later?
-No.

277
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,920
Okay.

278
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,640
What's wrong?

279
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,000
My fingertips are blue,
and my teeth are chattering.

280
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,800
We're not going to hang out for a bit?

281
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,200
-What a shitty evening.
-If you want...

282
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,840
If you like, I'll walk you to your bus
and I'll go out later.

283
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,320
-What the hell is wrong?
-I'm pissed off.

284
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,200
-Okay, but what did I do?
-You haven't done a thing.

285
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,800
Alma and Greta went partying without me,
and I found out from this photo.

286
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,040
-How did they get the tickets?
-How should I know?

287
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,120
Alma snuck out.
I feel like telling her mom where she is.

288
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,960
Then do it. Screw her.

289
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,080
I bet it was all her idea.

290
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,360
I don't know, Nata.
I feel bad for you. I mean...

291
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,040
She thinks she's better than us,
and she's not.

292
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,200
At least not you.

293
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,080
-You're much prettier and smarter.
-Hush up.

294
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I mean it.

295
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,520
You should ask yourself
if it's worth it to be friends.

296
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,680
Hey! Lucas's dad left him the van,
and he's taking us to Mokka.

297
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,040
Go on with them.

298
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,240
-You're sure?
-Yeah.

299
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,360
That way you save an hour on the bus.

300
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,200
You're the best.

301
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,320
Delicious. Thanks.

302
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,920
-Boo!
-Dammit!

303
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,960
Did I catch you psycho stalking my brother
or is it me?

304
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,920
He's so handsome, girl.

305
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,520
Really.

306
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,200
Do you think maybe he likes me a little?

307
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,280
Are you an idiot? Turn around.

308
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,040
You look amazing.

309
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,800
-Thanks.
-Today you'll score, for sure.

310
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,320
-Thanks.
-Okay?

311
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,800
It makes me mad
that it'll be with my brother.

312
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,120
I don't know, you know?

313
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,080
You don't know what? Hold this.

314
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,720
I've got something that maybe

315
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,240
will help you.

316
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,440
Where did you get that?

317
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,200
From around.

318
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,000
Do you want it or not?

319
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,760
-You are top five, girl.
-Thanks.

320
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,520
-Congratulations.
-Fab song! Let's go.

321
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,240
She's not answering my texts.

322
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,280
She could tell us she's okay at least.

323
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,680
She doesn't give a damn how we feel.

324
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,160
<i>The way she yells at us?</i>

325
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,520
<i>The awful things she says to you.</i>

326
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,160
<i>The way she looks at us with such hate.</i>

327
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,120
It's been months since we talked
about anything but her needs.

328
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,480
"I want you to buy me
a cell phone, clothes, food."

329
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,560
"I want more allowance."

330
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,720
"Take me here, take me there. I want..."

331
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,200
It's exhausting.

332
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,560
<i>She never wants to be with us.</i>

333
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,480
<i>It doesn't matter what you plan.
Alma wants to be somewhere else,</i>

334
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,400
<i>far away.</i>

335
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,240
<i>As far away as possible.</i>

336
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,120
Don't you think that rejection,

337
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,280
contempt, disrespect, and indifference
means she doesn't love us anymore?

338
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,240
No, of course she loves us.

339
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,160
She's just having a hard time.

340
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,560
It scares me when you talk like that.

341
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,600
It's like you've stopped loving her.

342
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,400
Right, your house is mine.

343
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,480
Seriously, I can get you
some interesting finance.

344
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,160
For me, of course.

345
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,120
-Sure, your house is mine.
-Good evening.

346
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,400
-That's the idea.
-Smart.

347
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,200
-Hi, Dad.
-Hi, good evening.

348
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,160
-Good evening.
-Hi, dear.

349
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,000
-How was the trip to Senegal?
-Great.

350
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,400
I don't know what you do in Senegal,
but when I go...

351
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,440
They were so awful.

352
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,160
I got rid of all the furniture,

353
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,400
and I did a gorgeous home staging.

354
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,720
Nata, sweetheart.

355
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,040
This is my eldest daughter.
Say hello, Nata.

356
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,600
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi there.

357
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,400
How was the match?

358
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,000
Great. They won.

359
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,960
Her guy is the football team captain.

360
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,240
-If I was 20 years younger...
-Mom.

361
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,080
Sorry, hon, you're gorgeous too.

362
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,200
And she's an A student.
Her father and I are so proud of her.

363
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,320
-Good night. I'm going to my room.
-Good night.

364
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,240
Bye.

365
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,960
And she really watches her diet.

366
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:46,600
I insisted on it from the very start.
Especially with her, because the boys...

367
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,160
Gorgeous!

368
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,320
Hey, you're super normal.
Hasn't the Molly hit you?

369
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,320
I only had one pill,
and you needed it more than I did.

370
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,240
Really?

371
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,400
You did that for me?

372
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,880
Yeah.

373
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,480
I swear you're the best friend
in the world.

374
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,880
You're brilliant, beautiful, wonderful.

375
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,160
Did I ever tell you I love you?

376
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,640
I'm so grateful to be your friend.

377
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,400
I love you.

378
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,320
Hey, this is cool.
Everyone loves each other so much.

379
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,800
-It's a cool party, right?
-Cool?

380
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,400
It's amazing. Thanks for inviting us.

381
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,440
Not at all. In a couple of weeks,

382
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,760
some friends in the center
are having another in a club.

383
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,200
-I could get you tickets.
-Yes, please.

384
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,360
I'm going to get a drink.

385
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,880
Remember you're a goddess,
and he's just a lucky guy, okay?

386
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,720
I saw a girl put her hand
in your back pocket.

387
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,600
-It's just business.
-Right.

388
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,720
Why the interest?

389
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,800
Simple curiosity.

390
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,480
Right.

391
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,480
Most of the people I sell to are friends.

392
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,920
They all live in the center,
and I don't take just anyone...

393
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,600
<i>Fuck, I love his hair.</i>

394
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,960
<i>It looks so soft.</i>

395
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,800
<i>I feel like stroking it.</i>

396
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,720
<i>Wow. Maybe it's the Molly?</i>

397
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,320
<i>I'd fuck him right now.</i>

398
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,640
<i>I don't have condoms,
but I bet he has a couple in his jacket.</i>

399
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,880
<i>We could get it on wild-style
in the bathroom.</i>

400
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,040
<i>Why won't he kiss me?</i>

401
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,080
<i>David, kiss me.</i>

402
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,640
<i>Kiss me.</i>

403
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,760
<i>Come on, kiss me.</i>

404
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,280
<i>Let loose, Alma.</i>

405
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,480
<i>Make the first move. Jump him.</i>

406
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,800
Alma, no.

407
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,360
I'm sorry,
but I'm not looking for anything serious.

408
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,680
Neither am I, asshole.

409
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,040
I just wanted a fuck. Go to hell.

410
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,240
There isn't another until 07:00.

411
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,720
-Go to bed.
-I won't be able to sleep.

412
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,360
Give me another vodka.

413
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,520
Maybe you should take it easy.

414
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,960
Maybe you should mind your own business.

415
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,240
You've been serving me all night,
and I'm only 17.

416
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,840
It's a bit late to worry about me.

417
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,760
Hey, do you want another shot?

418
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,160
What?

419
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,520
Do you want some shots?

420
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,880
RESTROOMS

421
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,960
Wait here, okay?
I need to go rescue my friend.

422
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,120
Cut it out!

423
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,320
-What are you doing? You're disgusting.
-What?

424
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,280
Let's get some air.

425
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,880
Life is a pile of shit.

426
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,720
Take it easy.

427
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,160
It's okay.

428
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,040
It's okay.

429
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,400
Okay.

430
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,920
I screwed up so badly...

431
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,640
-No.
-I'm an idiot.

432
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,280
-Such an idiot, huh?
-No.

433
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,000
Alma, we've all had the pull-back
one time or another.

434
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,320
-Don't worry.
-I'm such an asshole.

435
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,320
No, my brother's an asshole.

436
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,160
I'll go get our jackets. Stay here.

437
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,120
What are you doing here?

438
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,520
Greta!

439
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,480
Greta!

440
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,280
Where's Alma?

441
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,080
I left her here a minute ago,
but she's gone.

442
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,120
Damn.

443
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
Alma!

444
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,880
WHERE ARE YOU?
I'M CALLING YOU. PICK UP, DAMMIT

445
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,400
WHEN YOU GET BACK, I'M GOING TO KILL YOU

446
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,680
DELETE

447
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,520
We need to talk when she gets back.

448
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,960
All I want is
for her to come through that door.

449
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,840
It's Greta.

450
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,320
-Greta.
<i>-Hi, Vero.</i>

451
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,800
<i>Is Alma at home?</i>

452
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,000
No, why?

453
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,520
<i>Well, when you called me, I lied.</i>

454
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,520
<i>Alma and I went to a party.</i>

455
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,600
-Where is Alma?
<i>-I don't know.</i>

456
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,320
<i>I've been looking for her for three hours,</i>

457
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,920
<i>and I can't find her anywhere.</i>

458
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,080
-Did she leave with someone?
<i>-No idea.</i>

459
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,400
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

460
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,480
<i>I'm worried. I don't...</i>

461
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,760
-Go home.
<i>-Okay.</i>

462
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,600
Where is Alma?

463
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,640
Pablo!

464
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,360
My God, Alma, where were you?

465
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,400
Alma, are you okay?

466
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,480
-What happened? What is it?
-Where were you?

467
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,680
-I was at a party with Greta.
-We know that. I just spoke to her.

468
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,800
Where were you? She said you disappeared.

469
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,240
I was really dizzy, and I got lost.

470
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,240
What have you been doing till now?

471
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,240
I took a bus.

472
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,520
And you've been on a bus since 03:00?

473
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,680
-I think I fell asleep. I don't know.
-Why didn't you pick up?

474
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,920
-The battery ran out.
-It ran out when you went out the window.

475
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,280
This is unforgivable.
We'll have a serious talk.

476
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,440
-Okay, I'm sorry.
-"I'm sorry" won't do.

477
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,840
Fine, I admit it. I screwed up.
Ground me, but I need to go to bed.

478
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,240
Do you realize
what could have happened to you?

479
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,880
I need to go to bed.

480
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,040
Understand the consequences
of what you do.

481
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,080
Just think about the night I've had.

482
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,480
You have no idea the nightmare it's been
to imagine you lying in a ditch, Alma,

483
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,480
in a car trunk, or at the bottom of a pit.

484
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,960
