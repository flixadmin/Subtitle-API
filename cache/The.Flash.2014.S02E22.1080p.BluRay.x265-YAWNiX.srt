1
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:07,012
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:10,223
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,138
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:16,650
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,776
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:22,315
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:25,405
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

8
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:28,070
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:29,905
Previously on The Flash...

10
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:31,289
Welcome to Earth-2.

11
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,449
I met your doppelganger.

12
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:35,165
She's a coldhearted ice queen
named Killer Frost.

13
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,295
- The name is Vibe.
- Reverb.

14
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,082
My brothers and sisters.

15
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:45,301
I've brought us to this new world,
ours for the taking.

16
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,260
Whose world is this?

17
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:53,304
Our world! Our world!
Our world! Our world! Our world!

18
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,613
Reloading.

19
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,617
Argh!

20
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,328
David!

21
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,997
Back door, the captain's down.

22
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,506
Go, go, go, go.

23
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:29,931
Down, down, down, get down.

24
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,239
Some people are calling it
"The Metapocalypse,"

25
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,366
the days when Central City was overrun
by an army with powers beyond imagination.

26
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:01,543
But in these dark times,
we must never forget our own strength,

27
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,879
our own power to fight back.

28
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:13,392
That it is only in the blackest of nights
that we can truly see the light,

29
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,309
and know, for sure, we are not alone.

30
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,941
We are never, ever alone.

31
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:31,152
We usually take these guys down
one at a time, not 100 at a time.

32
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,911
And yet, you don't seem overwhelmed.

33
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,697
I know we can do it.

34
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,621
Guys, you have to come see this.

35
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:41,371
Cisco, what are you... Caitlin?

36
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,418
She's in shock.

37
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:49,303
A little dehydrated and malnourished,
but I think she'll be fine.

38
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:51,797
I'm okay.

39
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,091
What happened? How did you get away?

40
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,392
He let me go.

41
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,805
I didn't think he would,
I thought it was a trap.

42
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,024
But he told me you were dead.

43
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,810
I'm not. I'm right here.

44
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,774
We're all here. Together.

45
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,736
Snow,

46
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,360
Jay's not here. You're safe.

47
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,158
He's gonna overrun the city,
you can't stop him.

48
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,493
Yes, we can.

49
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:21,627
Listen to me, he's not going to succeed.
We've got this. This is our Earth.

50
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,038
You don't know that.
You don't know what he is capable of.

51
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,926
I know from being in the Speed Force
that the universe is with us, not Zoom.

52
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,130
And if the Universe is with us,
how could we possibly lose? Right, guys?

53
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,344
Yeah, yeah, right.

54
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,638
You've been through a lot.
You should get some rest, come on.

55
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,606
You were in the Speed Force?

56
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,268
I... When you were gone,
it's hard to explain,

57
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,813
but we tried to get my powers back,

58
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,152
and the dark matter lightning
I was inside...

59
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,657
Okay, I'm gonna say it.

60
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:56,161
Um, we don't think he's just being
a little too...

61
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,946
- Overconfident?
- Yeah.

62
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,456
Yeah, maybe it was his time
in the Speed Force.

63
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,493
I mean, he's acting
like he's invincible now or something.

64
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,037
Yeah, like nothing fazes him anymore,
which isn't...

65
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,204
Realistic, no.

66
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:10,046
Somebody needs to talk to him before
letting his guard down gets him hurt,

67
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,334
OI" worse.

68
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,969
I mean, he did bring me out of my coma.

69
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,347
That's bound to make someone
a little overly chipper.

70
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,850
Well, like I said,
somebody needs to talk to him.

71
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,352
Amazingjob, Anupam.

72
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,809
This is exactly
the kind of groundbreaking thinking

73
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,189
I built this company for.

74
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,480
Well done.

75
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,766
Everyone, evacuate! Now!

76
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,928
Hurry!

77
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,064
Hey.

78
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,990
She's out like a light, huh?

79
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,743
Yeah. Jay really did a number on her.

80
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:23,452
It's not like he exactly used
kid gloves on the rest of us.

81
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,003
She'll be okay, shejust needs time.

82
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,415
And for us to finally bring Zoom down.
Which we will.

83
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:35,253
Yeah, because the Universe
is with us, right?

84
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:38,885
Listen, man...

85
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:57,946
Cisco? Hey, are you okay?

86
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,026
- You just vibe?
- Yeah.

87
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,319
What'd you see?

88
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:06,583
I saw a bird. Like, a dead bird.

89
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,882
Mercury Labs.

90
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,427
- It's under attack.
- All right.

91
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,715
Come on!

92
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:37,856
Ah!

93
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:10,855
Thank you, Mr. Allen.

94
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,400
I'm not stupid.

95
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,775
Boom.

96
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,084
So, how did you know?

97
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,744
- Your real identity?
- Yeah.

98
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,835
Come on, Barry, I'm a scientist.
We're paid to be perceptive.

99
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,499
And you're always
a little too well-informed

100
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,885
when things go pear-shaped in this city.

101
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,054
But I don't believe we've ever met before.
Dr. Christina McGee.

102
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,557
Dr. Henry Allen. I'm Barry's father.

103
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,012
Okay, now that the cat's out of the bag,

104
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,769
did you happen to see who it was
that caused your building to collapse?

105
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,771
I didn't see anything,
it happened so fast.

106
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,149
Maybe the security cameras
caught something?

107
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,150
Can we access them?

108
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,108
Mercury Labs does have
a crash-survivable memory unit.

109
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:00,855
A what?

110
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,992
Virtually, a blackbox for buildings.
It will have stored

111
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,403
all the security footage
right up until the building collapsed.

112
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,789
Okay, great, I'll go find it.
This wasn't some random meta-human.

113
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,576
Whenever Mercury Labs has been targeted
in the past,

114
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,335
there's always been a specific reason.

115
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,167
Yeah, someone's after something.

116
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,752
Yes, and that someone is probably Zoom.

117
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,713
- Mmm-hmm.
- There may be one more possibility.

118
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,588
A few months ago, I saw
Harrison Wells running out of my facility.

119
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,428
I know it sounds crazy,
but I'm certain it was him.

120
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,930
Is there any way
he could have anything to do with this?

121
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,058
A few months ago? Sure.

122
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,441
Now? No.

123
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:41,196
Yeah, there are a few more things
that we could catch you up on, Dr. McGee.

124
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,279
HeY. my purse!

125
00:08:49,303 --> 00:08:51,303
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

126
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,592
That ain't yours, punk.

127
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,341
Big mistake.

128
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,135
You picked a bad time to play hero.

129
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,317
Dad?

130
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,787
Wally? What the hell were you doing?

131
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,995
That guyjustjacked a bunch of people,
so I had to go after him.

132
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,660
You could've got yourself killed!

133
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,828
I'm notjust gonna let these guys
get away with this.

134
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,669
- I have to do something.
- Wally, these are notjust guys!

135
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,832
These are meta-humans!

136
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,876
Leave this to the cops and The Flash!

137
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:48,593
The Flash can't be everywhere at once.
I... I have to do what I can to help.

138
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,349
I have to show him
I was worth being saved.

139
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,312
Wally.

140
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,856
You are worth it.

141
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,401
Really? Am I?

142
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,445
'Cause last time I checked,

143
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,111
I'm the guy
who avoided his dying mother for weeks.

144
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,742
I'm the guy who shamed
a bunch of other guys

145
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,031
and illegally took their cars from them.

146
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,496
I'm the guy who caused The Flash
to lose his powers

147
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,037
and start this whole damn Metapocalypse
in the first place.

148
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,831
- Wally...
- Last time I checked,

149
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,708
I have a whole lot to make up for.

150
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,091
That's what I intend to do.

151
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,595
Damn it.

152
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,900
- Snow.
- Oh.

153
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,319
- I didn't know you were here.
- What are you doing?

154
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:54,954
Jesse asked me to run some tests to see
if her genetic structure had changed.

155
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:01,336
Why did you ask Dr. Snow
to run tests on you again?

156
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,496
Because I got hit
with the dark matter, okay?

157
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,415
I mean,
that must have affected me somehow.

158
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,593
You're not a meta-human.

159
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:22,850
What you are
is a young woman with genius-level IQ

160
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:27,112
that we could use in our fight
against this new wave of meta-humans.

161
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,612
Okay. All right, fine.

162
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,155
Fine.

163
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,785
Snow.

164
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,953
You all right?

165
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,252
Yeah, fine.

166
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,552
- Is this it?
- That's the one.

167
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,719
All right, great.

168
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,014
Dad, Dr. McGee, Cisco,
why don't you guys crack this open,

169
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,181
- see what you can find?
- Sure.

170
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:06,147
We'll go see what kind of meta-human
powers can take down a building like that,

171
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:07,811
- and how to stop it.
- Great.

172
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:08,978
Sounds like fun.

173
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,773
All right, I'm gonna go see
if Joe needs any help in the streets.

174
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,159
Everybody cool here?
Should be a piece of cake, right?

175
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,827
Hey, slugger.

176
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,082
- Hey.
- Can I talk to you for a minute?

177
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,665
Yeah, sure. What's up?

178
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,667
Well, I know you said

179
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,298
that what happened to you
in the Speed Force

180
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,551
changed the way you see things.

181
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,674
- Yeah.
- But you seem very optimistic,

182
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,635
you know, with a lot of meta-humans
running around, tearing up the city.

183
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,971
What, did you see the future in there?

184
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,768
Um...

185
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,305
Not this time. No, I... Look,

186
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:48,602
what I was shown in the Speed Force,
it didn'tjust change my mind,

187
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,270
it changed me.

188
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,650
I don't know, I mean,
what you're seeing as optimism is...

189
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:59,203
For the first time,
I'm just not afraid anymore.

190
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,116
Great. That's...

191
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,293
But you know
you still have to be careful, right?

192
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,259
- What do you mean?
- Well...

193
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,383
I don't... Why are you trying

194
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,345
to take something from me
that I've fought so hard to get to?

195
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,599
Barry.

196
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,977
You don't know everything
that I've been through, Dad.

197
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,433
You haven't been here long enough to know.

198
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,017
I didn't mean...
I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that.

199
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,685
I think I do.

200
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,067
I haven't been around.

201
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,324
To teach you how to drive
or take you to look at colleges,

202
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:40,237
but I've done everything in my power
to know who you are.

203
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:44,078
Barry, I don't want to take anything
from you, I believe in you.

204
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,543
This isn't about my not believing in you.

205
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:50,080
I know that. And I'm fine, okay?

206
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,799
Thank you.
Thank you very much for worrying about me.

207
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,084
I love you,

208
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,216
but I'm fine.

209
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,014
Come on.

210
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,561
What is that?

211
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,693
It's C.C.P.D.

212
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,445
Zoom.

213
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,447
Barry, don't do it.

214
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,951
You know I never saw the crime photos
of my mother's murder.

215
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,250
Although I guess I didn't need to.

216
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,541
I had a ringside seat
while you got whisked away.

217
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,090
Too delicate, I suppose.

218
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,012
Notjust a hologram after all,
are you, Flash?

219
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,689
Interesting.

220
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:55,232
I know you didn't call me up here
just to banter.

221
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,648
Let's finish this right now.

222
00:14:58,439 --> 00:14:59,565
Actually, I did.

223
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,742
I called you up here to tell you

224
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,575
you can't keep running
from one meta to the next.

225
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,708
Around and around,
like a dog chasing its tail.

226
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,582
I'll do whatever it takes to stop you.

227
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,838
If only that were good enough.

228
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:17,251
'Cause here's the thing. I know you.

229
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,674
I know you,
I know what's holding you back.

230
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,514
You and me,

231
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,018
we're reallyjust the same person.

232
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,520
Yeah, you keep saying that,
but it's not gonna make it true.

233
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,814
You'll see. We are.

234
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,566
Same tragic background,
same reason for running,

235
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,784
same desire to be the fastest,
to be the best.

236
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,989
The difference?
You think your anger is dirty somehow.

237
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,534
You want to be seen as pure, the hero.

238
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,372
Doesn't it get exhausting?

239
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,795
Doesn't it get exhausting, Barry?

240
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,173
It was exhausting playing Jay, believe me.

241
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,049
I'm not pretending.

242
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,217
Now, if it were me,

243
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,266
I'd let that building tumble
without a second thought. But you?

244
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,018
You'll never let that happen, will you?

245
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,812
That's why I'm gonna beat you, Barry.

246
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,808
Because you always have to be the hero.

247
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,611
And while you're playing
the good little boy,

248
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,532
I'll be busy winning.

249
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,415
We can't let Zoom
destroy another building.

250
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,756
We need to take him down. Now.

251
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,380
And how do you propose we do that

252
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,217
with an army of meta-humans
laying waste to Central City?

253
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,599
We couldn't stop Zoom on my Earth.
What makes us different?

254
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,097
We're a team.

255
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,016
We start with the meta-humans,
they're his armor.

256
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,398
We take them down first,
then Zoom's more vulnerable.

257
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,934
Barry, we don't know even know
how many of his minions there are.

258
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,943
There could be hundreds, a thousand.

259
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,446
And all of them,
they're all working with different powers.

260
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:03,822
It could take weeks to track 'em all down.

261
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,358
Guys, we don't have weeks.

262
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,870
So what we need to do is come up
with a way to stop them all at once.

263
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,451
Again, how?

264
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,458
Cisco.

265
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:18,372
Your goggles, your camera,
they didn't work on Earth-2, right?

266
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,040
Yeah, it was all a different frequency.

267
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,799
And the way you took down
the Time Wraiths?

268
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,130
That was based on frequency.

269
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,635
Hartley's entire schtick...

270
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,968
I think I'm smelling
what you're stepping in.

271
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,507
- Yeah.
- So, basically,

272
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:33,349
we create some vibrational tech
that could take down the Earth-2 metas.

273
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:34,933
- Basically.
- I like it.

274
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,473
- Me, too.
- I'll help.

275
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:37,640
Okay.

276
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,650
I'll let you know
ifl hear anything from CCPN.

277
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,527
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

278
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:43,813
You guys,

279
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,067
we got this.

280
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,501
- Barry, can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

281
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,524
Birds. Why?

282
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,944
It's like a Hitchcock movie in my head.

283
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,612
What's up?

284
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,246
Man, it's Wally.

285
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,704
- Is he okay?
- Not really.

286
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,919
Earlier, he thought
it would be a good idea

287
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:46,551
if he used himself as bait
against a meta-human psycho.

288
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,803
Thought he could do things
the way The Flash would.

289
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,882
Joe, I mean, he did tell me

290
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:56,349
that he wasn't gonna waste
the opportunity The Flash gave him.

291
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,057
I don't know if you can stop him.

292
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,268
I'm gonna have to
or he's gonna get himself killed.

293
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:04,231
Look, he ain't you, Barry.
He can'tjust go Mach 50...

294
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,070
Mach 50 isn't a real thing.

295
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,858
Point is, thinking you're invincible
isn't any kind of armor.

296
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,203
Now, Wally's already at a higher risk
than I'm comfortable with,

297
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:17,582
and him throwing caution to the wind
on top of all of that? No.

298
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,451
We gotta keep him safe.

299
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:26,920
So, can The Flash talk to him?

300
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:28,918
Again.

301
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,592
Yeah, I'll talk to him.
I'll try, I promise.

302
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,507
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

303
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,846
Thank you.

304
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,787
I thought throwing things was Harry's
preferred method of dealing with stress.

305
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,119
That is how frustrated I am right now.

306
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,505
I'm just running out of ideas
as to how to make this work.

307
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:07,790
Where's Barry? I need a taste

308
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,335
of that Walking on Sunshine thing
he's got going on right now.

309
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,307
No, no.

310
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,186
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, it's me.

311
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,316
Okay? Breathe. Breathe.

312
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,815
You're okay, right? You're shaking.

313
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,606
I... lthought I saw him.
Zoom, I thought I saw him right there.

314
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:35,151
It'sjust me, okay?
Look at me, he's not here. He's not here.

315
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,662
I see him everywhere.

316
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:44,919
Look, you literallyjust escaped
a psychopath who kidnapped you. All right?

317
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,705
So I think it's normal for you
to have a severe reaction like this.

318
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,000
This is so much worse than that.

319
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,168
I'm afraid all the time.

320
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,339
I don't think I can ever move forward.

321
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,506
You will.

322
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:01,512
When? Jay took everything from me.

323
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:05,603
My confidence, my trust, my sanity.

324
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,564
I don't think I'll ever be whole again.

325
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:12,860
Of course, you will.

326
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,116
Promise.

327
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,830
Copy that, en route,
ETA four minutes, send backup, 442.

328
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,207
Yes, code 50 on that 11-81.

329
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:26,873
We're gonna need 1013, backup for...

330
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:31,708
Stealing is illegal, you know.

331
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:35,799
Detective West tells me

332
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,716
that you've been fighting Zoom's army
on your own.

333
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,051
Yeah, Iwanna help.

334
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,931
I admire what you're trying to do,

335
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:51,648
but the best way to help
is to just leave this to the police.

336
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:53,687
Like you did?

337
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:58,117
I do have powers, Wally,
it is a little different.

338
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:04,036
This isn't your fight, it's mine.

339
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,992
No, it's all of ours.

340
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,876
This is my city, too, now,
and it's up to all of us to protect it.

341
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,341
Barry, we got a major meta-human alert
at Fifth and Main. Get there.

342
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,929
Fifth and Main, got it.

343
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:20,924
We'll continue this later.

344
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:35,525
Why is it always so difficult
to choose?

345
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,235
- Barry, what is it?
- It's...

346
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,451
Laurel Lance.

347
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:50,870
Laurel.

348
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:56,133
Laurel Lance is dead.
On this Earth, anyway.

349
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,803
Poor Black Canary. Bye, bye, Birdie.

350
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,635
Earth-2 Laurel.

351
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,760
You knew her doppelganger?

352
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,600
We didn'tjust know her, we loved her.

353
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,771
So, what do I call you?

354
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,777
You can call me Black Siren.

355
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,281
Zoom mentioned
that you might be showing up.

356
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:23,828
Well, if he told you what I can do,
you should look more afraid.

357
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,326
And so should you.

358
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,660
Tell me,

359
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,501
why did you take down Mercury Labs?

360
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:35,002
Because I like to watch things
crumble and fall.

361
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,586
Guess what.

362
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,463
You're next, Red.

363
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,521
Barry?

364
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,689
Are you okay, Barry?

365
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,060
Look. Anything over 200 decibels
will kill a human.

366
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,813
Was that too loud?

367
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,859
Perhaps, we should
quiet things down a bit.

368
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:18,458
You know, the sad thing is,
I think Zoom's actually afraid of you.

369
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,297
I didn't think that he feared anything.

370
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,922
And you, you're hardly worth the chills.

371
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,517
How many metas did he send
to try and kill you?

372
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:30,599
Well, it's too bad,
he should have just sent me,

373
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,729
because that way,
you would have already been...

374
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:38,485
Get in!

375
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,838
- Thought you might need a lift.
- Yeah, thanks.

376
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,507
You're welcome.

377
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,727
Why do so many villains
that we go up against

378
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,513
use sound as a weapon?

379
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,440
- What?
- Nothing.

380
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:17,815
- You're gonna be fine.
- Thanks.

381
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,946
So Wally just drove on up
into the thick of it?

382
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,105
Mmm-hmm.

383
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,617
Must have been some conversation
you two had.

384
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,619
Seeing as though he did
literally the opposite of what we wanted.

385
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,163
This I can hear.

386
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,448
It's not funny.

387
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,703
- I'm sorry.
- I'm in no laughing mood.

388
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:41,166
Look, Joe, I tried.
I told you I would try, right? I...

389
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,922
Wally's a determined kid.

390
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,961
Yeah, determined to get himself killed.

391
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,005
Or determined to help people.

392
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:51,016
And be glad or, you know,
lwould not be standing here right now.

393
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:54,349
Well, he was lucky tonight.
I don't want to see the day when he isn't.

394
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,682
Yeah, we got more than luck
on our side, Joe.

395
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:10,323
You know you're not invincible, right?

396
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:16,329
Yes, of course, I know this.

397
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,000
Joe's being overprotective,
but I get it.

398
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:24,133
Yeah, but it's like you think
that nothing can touch you.

399
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,843
Like nothing bad can get in your way.

400
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,048
That's not true for any of us.

401
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:31,431
What are you saying?

402
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:37,017
Look, I know that you had an experience
in the Speed Force.

403
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:41,309
And I'm happy that you think
that we're gonna win the day.

404
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,978
But I think a little fear
can be a healthy thing.

405
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:47,361
It helps you determine
which risks are worth taking.

406
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,819
I think that's something for both
you and Wally to take to heart.

407
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:01,663
I met your little red friend
tonight.

408
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,211
Aren't you gonna ask me ifl killed him?

409
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,885
You didn't.
You're good, but not that good.

410
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:15,931
And yet, I seem to be the only one
of your top lieutenants still standing.

411
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,720
Like I said, you're good.

412
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:23,605
So why don't you go knock down
a few more buildings? Like I ordered.

413
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:25,190
What's the point?

414
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:31,405
The point is so that it seems random.

415
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:36,413
That way, The Flash and his merry band
won't realize what I'm up to

416
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:37,789
until it's too late.

417
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,124
What are you up to?

418
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,215
No good.

419
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,719
- Ow!
- Sorry.

420
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:52,880
Ow!

421
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,219
- There we go.
- Are you kidding me with this?

422
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,055
- Hey, at least it works.
- Tremendous.

423
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,434
What is it, exactly?

424
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,312
It's just a small source ofjoy.

425
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,893
But more importantly,
it's how we're gonna stop Zoom's army.

426
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,899
By giving them all electro-shock therapy?

427
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,311
By giving them all
dimensional-shock therapy.

428
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:10,276
This is where I play stupid
and you explain the science.

429
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:14,194
Okay, fair enough. So, all matter vibrates
at its own unique frequency, right?

430
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,453
You disrupt that frequency,
you disrupt the matter.

431
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,831
Like how an opera singer shatters glass
with her voice.

432
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:20,286
Exactly. So, we found out

433
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:23,953
that all Earth-2 people vibrate
at their own, more erratic frequency.

434
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,371
Higher frequency.

435
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,914
- Different frequency.
- Higher.

436
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,632
- Higher frequency than we do.
- Right.

437
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,419
So, I ran this all past Hartley, right?

438
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:36,716
And he postulated that we could create
a sort of dimensional tuning fork. Voila'!

439
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,225
Okay, you didn't do it yourself.

440
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,140
- Just let me have this one, okay?
- All right, have it.

441
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:45,809
Thank you. So, if you run around the city
fast enough to create a refracting field,

442
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:51,856
the device can send out a pulse
that will bounce off of it, split apart,

443
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:54,366
and collide with itself over and over.

444
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,118
Amplifying it to an erratic frequency
on the Earth-2...

445
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,996
- Higher. Higherfrequency.
- Higher frequency on the Earth-2 spectrum.

446
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,123
And when that pulse hits anyone
from Earth-2...

447
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,784
It'll disrupt their nervous system.

448
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,956
Earth-2 metas go night-night.

449
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,254
- Even Zoom?
- Even Zoom.

450
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:09,836
Harry and Jesse are from Earth-2.

451
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,500
How do we keep the pulse
from hurting them?

452
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:12,964
Detective, I didn't know you cared.

453
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,252
Yes, you did.

454
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,844
Well, we designed these
headphones to protect us from the pulse.

455
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,724
Beats By Wells.

456
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,222
Cisco, it's your meta-human alert app.

457
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:26,061
That's the high-rise development
on the west side.

458
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,475
Hundreds of people live there.

459
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:31,111
Ramon, we're up. Let's go.
Set that pulse off right now.

460
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,819
Allen, you need to start generating
that retracting field right now.

461
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:36,029
Black Siren could take down this building
at any point.

462
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,192
All those people, Wells...

463
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,077
How many more people are gonna die
while we wait?

464
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,239
Guys, which is it?

465
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,369
I think I Just got
the worst idea of all time.

466
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,971
I don't think I've taken down
so many buildings at once.

467
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:05,141
Maybe you're not as powerful
as you think!

468
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,654
What are you two doing here?

469
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,952
Why should you have all the fun?

470
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,583
I thought you two were dead.

471
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:39,430
Zoom thinks that, too.
And we'd like to keep it that way.

472
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,219
For now.

473
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,603
You think you two can pull one over
on Zoom?

474
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,981
Well, enjoy being dead.

475
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,562
I told you.

476
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,272
Give her a chance.

477
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,733
What chance?

478
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:57,398
She's not ready.

479
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,614
Excuse me.

480
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,078
Do you know what I'm capable of doing?

481
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:07,450
Try it and I'll shatter
your entire nervous system

482
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:09,038
without breaking a sweat.

483
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:12,250
Wow, you really think
you can take on Zoom.

484
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,540
We can.

485
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,339
You don't even know how powerful you are.

486
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,965
With a single call,
you can take down a building.

487
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,427
I'd call that impressive.

488
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:28,728
But why stop there?

489
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,645
Why serve a master
when you can be a master,

490
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,482
when you can be a god?

491
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:40,657
We could be gods.

492
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,578
- All right.
- All right.

493
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,335
All right, we're synced up
with whatever the heck that thing is.

494
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,087
Finally, something we're both baffled by.

495
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:57,341
I'm kidding.
That, my friend, is a 75-KTSB,

496
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,797
40,000 watt reverberating sound amplifier,

497
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,178
designed to single out
the operating frequency

498
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,010
of every single Earth-2 being
on this planet,

499
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,345
which, when contained and magnified

500
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:09,136
by The Flash creating
a sound pressure wall around the city,

501
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:13,102
will render
all of us Earth-2 beings unconscious.

502
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,735
Hence, the safety precautions.

503
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,646
I'm baffled by it.

504
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,573
Are we ready?

505
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,358
Yes, we are.

506
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:24,526
All right.

507
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,204
Here we go.

508
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:48,384
If I were interested
in forming an alliance with you two,

509
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:52,479
what's your plan, exactly?

510
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,359
We ambush Zoom at C.C.P.D.

511
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,521
With our three powers combined,
he'll be no match for us.

512
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:05,234
Well, I like the sound of that.

513
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,198
Great. Then let's go.

514
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:11,699
There's just one more thing.

515
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,162
Reverb, catch.

516
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,586
You know, all doppelgangers,

517
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,760
they're mirror images of themselves.

518
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:30,642
But you two, you didn't know that,
did you?

519
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,302
Reverb is left-handed.

520
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:37,141
Well, I just... I just happened to
catch it with my right... Run!

521
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,903
Oh, no. What are we gonna do?

522
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:53,077
I don't think
that there's anything you can do.

523
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,457
What the what?

524
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,798
- I don't know.
- Well, do it again!

525
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,171
Cisco?

526
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:14,386
We're a go.

527
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:27,241
There is nothing on this Earth
that can stop us!

528
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,242
It's working.

529
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,115
Ah!

530
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:44,208
Dad? Dad, it hurts.

531
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,516
- No, no, no, don't!
- Lt's okay. It's okay, honey.

532
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,203
Turn it off, turn it off, it worked.

533
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,202
It's okay, it's okay.
We'll take care of him.

534
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,631
It's okay, Jesse, he's gonna be okay.

535
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:30,296
Barry, we did it. Bring them all in.

536
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,385
Copy that. I'm on cleanup.

537
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:42,149
What's that? I can't... I can't hear you

538
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,230
through the double-paned soundproof glass.

539
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:48,022
It's... It's kind of hard to make out
what you're saying.

540
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,237
So, should we tell Sara and Captain Lance
about her?

541
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,778
No. I've seen what interacting
with your family's doppelgangers can do,

542
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,412
and that's not even Laurel.

543
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,706
Nope, it's just a poor imitation.

544
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:02,085
Speaking of, that was a pretty good
Killer Frost you did back there.

545
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:06,002
Guess I was just in the right headspace
to play a cold, vicious killer.

546
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,046
How you doing? Are you okay?

547
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,758
No.

548
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,420
But I think I'm gonna be.

549
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:16,508
Being out there with you guys,
fighting meta-humans, and saving people?

550
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:20,892
It's the first time I felt normal
in a long time.

551
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,939
Come here.

552
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:24,440
This is a group hug moment.

553
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,851
- Yeah, get in.
- It is.

554
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,656
So, all of Zoom's meta-humans
are locked up in Iron Heights?

555
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:38,117
Most of 'em. Some are somewhere else.

556
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,202
- I don't want to know.
- No, you don't.

557
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,457
And Zoom?

558
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:45,663
The metas we spoke to said Zoom
created a breach and escaped.

559
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:47,081
And how did he do that again?

560
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:49,466
Who knows? But he's back on Earth-2 now.

561
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,671
Earth-2?

562
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,377
Is that something else
I don't wanna know about?

563
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:53,545
- No.
- No.

564
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:59,306
All right. Well, Flash, thanks.
The man who saved Central City once again.

565
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,390
No, we're all just part of the same team.

566
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,772
Speaking of teams,
where the hell is Allen?

567
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,520
Sorry, man. Sorry.
Hey, heard my name.

568
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:10,733
- Uh, what's up?
- Good.

569
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,943
Well, you've got about 100 meta-criminal
cases to get through,

570
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,574
so I would get to cracking if I were you.

571
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,827
I will get right on that.

572
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:19,912
Captain.

573
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,623
- Well done.
- Thanks.

574
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:27,663
Listen, uh, I've been thinking
about Wally some more.

575
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,502
Are you gonna talk to him again?

576
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,708
- No, I'm not.
- Why not?

577
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,422
Because he's your son, Joe.

578
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:35,178
I know he's my son.

579
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:38,348
Look, no, what I mean is,
he's got your values.

580
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,601
He's got your inner drive
to help people do what's right.

581
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:45,396
We're supposed to think we're something
we're not until we become that thing.

582
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,641
That's the path that Wally's on.

583
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:52,362
I'm not gonna stop him from being the hero
that he's gonna become.

584
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,697
I really don't think you should, either.

585
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,573
I can't wait till you have kids
and they torture you.

586
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,488
I'm gonna laugh in your face.

587
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:03,790
All right, gramps.

588
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,666
- Poppa.
- What?

589
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,786
My grandkid's gonna call me Poppa.

590
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:12,461
All right.

591
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,137
What in the world?

592
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,850
- What is this?
- Blame Iris.

593
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:29,357
Okay, I just figured that since Henry
is officially back for good,

594
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:30,859
we should celebrate.

595
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,896
And since Zoom is gone
and the city is quiet right now.

596
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:37,149
I appreciate it, Iris. Thank you.

597
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,660
- Hi, Tina.
- Hello, Henry.

598
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,412
- Jesse. Hi.
- Hi.

599
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:47,417
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

600
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,044
- You look great.
- Thank you.

601
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,539
I hope you don't mind
that I invited Dr. McGee.

602
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:56,088
Seems like somebody's glad you did.

603
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,049
Mmm-hmm.

604
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,634
So, I guess you are invincible.

605
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,926
- Told you. The Speed Force is with us.
- Mmm.

606
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:11,309
Since I'm feeling extra invincible lately,

607
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,107
what do you say you and I

608
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:18,990
give this a shot?

609
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,402
Yeah, I would like that.

610
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,787
So, is it true?

611
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,786
You saved The Flash's life?

612
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:35,298
Oh, I mean, I was just in the right place
at the right time.

613
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,925
Proud of you, Wally. You did good.

614
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:40,420
Thanks, Dad.

615
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:43,139
What?

616
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,471
Uh, I'm just... I'm proud of you, too.

617
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,176
- Soup's on.
- Hey!

618
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:50,096
Taking out a city full of monsters
makes a man hungry.

619
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,186
First,

620
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,142
a toast.

621
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,611
- To family.
- To family.

622
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,649
That's my kind of toast, short and sweet,
let's eat.

623
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,449
Oh. You guys. Great.

624
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,083
It's Earth-2.

625
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:28,222
Cisco, what, what is it?

626
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,054
What'd you see?

627
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,268
What do you mean, see?

628
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,853
Cisco gets visions.

629
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,814
- I don't understand.
- What, Cisco?

630
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:42,198
Earth-2 splitting in half,
straight down through the poles.

631
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,697
Tell me I didn't just vibe the future.

632
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,863
Please, tell me I did not just see
the end of the world.

633
00:40:57,205 --> 00:41:00,334
Our story continues, Flash.

634
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:06,381
- Henry!
- Oh, my God!

635
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,896
Dad? Dad?

636
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,691
It's poetic,
returning to your childhood home.

637
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,908
Jay, don't do this.

638
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,823
All right? I'm begging you.
I'm begging you!

639
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,334
- Take me. Kill me.
- No!

640
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,711
You still won't believe me
that you and I are the same.

641
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:37,870
Come on, come on.

642
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,584
Barry, look at me, son. Look at me.

643
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,250
So, I'm gonna have to make you believe me.

644
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:46,547
Whatever happens,
you have made me the happiest father.

645
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:47,839
- Dad.
- This time,

646
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:50,429
you're gonna watch your parent die,
just like I did.

647
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,389
- No! No!
- And this is what's gonna make you

648
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,270
just like me.

649
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,147
- Your mother and I love...
- Jay!

650
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,024
No!

651
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:07,048
