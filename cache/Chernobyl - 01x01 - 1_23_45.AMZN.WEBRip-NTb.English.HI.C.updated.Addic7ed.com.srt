But it is my experience

521
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:04,060
that when the people ask questions

522
00:42:04,062 --> 00:42:07,436
that are not in their own best interest,

523
00:42:07,438 --> 00:42:09,436
they should simply be told

524
00:42:09,438 --> 00:42:11,605
to keep their minds on their labor

There was none.

- It's typical.
- See? This is what Moscow does.
