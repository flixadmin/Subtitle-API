1
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,008
<i>I was scared…</i>

2
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,344
<i>of my baby</i>

3
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,806
<i>that was born into this world so soon</i>

4
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,770
<i>and of the decision I had to make.</i>

5
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,196
<i>That all scared me.</i>

6
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,384
<i>I couldn't bring myself to kill you.</i>

7
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,846
<i>So I left you.</i>

8
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,959
<i>I thought maybe I could forget.</i>

9
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,598
I missed you!

10
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,876
<i>But I needed to know…</i>

11
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,421
<i>why you were born like this.</i>

12
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:40,845
<i>Was I to blame for bringing you</i>
<i>into this world so soon?</i>

13
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,322
<i>Was it my foul desires</i>

14
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,825
<i>that made you what you are?</i>

15
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,228
<i>What is my baby, really?</i>

16
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,898
<i>Is she a gift or a curse?</i>

17
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,693
<i>I just couldn't tell.</i>

18
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,494
<i>I thought…</i>

19
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,123
<i>you might have the answer.</i>

20
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,260
I came too late, didn't I?

21
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,015
Not at all.

22
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,394
You're here now, right?

23
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,609
That's your mommy.

24
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,736
Say hi.

25
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,626
Hi there.

26
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,976
<i>Seeing the normal little girl you were,</i>

27
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,772
<i>I was relieved.</i>

28
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:44,320
<i>Every day I spent with you,</i>
<i>hiding my worries and doubts…</i>

29
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:53,204
<i>Living every ordinary day</i>
<i>skating on thin ice.</i>

30
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,145
<i>Maybe a life like this</i>

31
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,564
<i>wouldn't be so bad.</i>

32
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,822
<i>But it all fell apart</i>

33
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,950
<i>in one moment.</i>

34
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:39,000
<i>The moment I thought I lost you,</i>
<i>but you stopped writhing in pain…</i>

35
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,133
<i>and before me stood something different.</i>

36
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,386
<i>That's when I realized…</i>

37
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,940
<i>no matter how much I denied it,</i>

38
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,277
<i>my little girl was a monster.</i>

39
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,397
What's going on?

40
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,743
Why did you have to do this?

41
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,913
I'm her mother.

42
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,707
No matter how she changes,

43
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,584
or what form she takes,

44
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,296
I need to recognize my little girl.

45
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,467
I won't ever lose her.

46
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,205
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if I'm protecting you from this world,</i>

47
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,167
<i>or if I'm protecting the world from you.</i>

48
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,005
Don't take those off no matter what.

49
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:51,841
<i>I'm just…</i>

50
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,970
<i>doing all I can to stay with you.</i>

51
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,513
Understand?

52
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,744
ORIGINAL STORY WEBTOON <i>SWEET HOME</i>
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

53
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:56,072
SWEET HOME

54
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:04,955
Mom…

55
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,250
The people…

56
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,337
They're all bad.

57
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:13,881
Did you say "Mom"?

58
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:15,549
You're no different.

59
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,218
Cha Hyun-su.

60
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,639
Cha Hyun-su!

61
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,735
Are you really just gonna leave like that?

62
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,946
Were you expecting a hug or something?

63
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,030
Yeah, I was.

64
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,576
I expected at least a "Glad to see you.
How've you been?"

65
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,870
But I'm not glad to see you.

66
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,041
It's been you all along.

67
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,005
The construction site,
all of it was you, wasn't it?

68
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,510
You just had to confuse me, didn't you?

69
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,930
Just why are you trying to run away?

70
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,308
Will you say something?

71
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,602
What?

72
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,771
You're gonna run, aren't you?

73
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,564
What are you even running away for?

74
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,361
We cross paths and that's it.

75
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,698
I figured since we're not strangers,
I should help you.

76
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,412
Nothing more.

77
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,791
You understand?

78
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,964
You're trying to get yourself killed?

79
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,342
You monster piece of shit,
what are you doing here?

80
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,142
Get gone.

81
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,042
Hey, you crazy bitch.

82
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,337
Even Ha-ni knows
not to throw away her life.

83
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,883
Of all the things to do, you're spending
your time chasing after a monster?

84
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,511
You're lucky to still be alive.

85
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,517
Thank God.

86
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,938
Hyun-su is still…

87
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,274
alive.

88
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,036
If you're gonna draw their attention

89
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,163
and bring monsters to our doorstep,

90
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,957
then just get lost.

91
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,765
- Why did you do that?
- I don't like her.

92
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,225
So why don't you like her?

93
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,270
She's the reason you hurt my friends
and the reason you keep disappearing,

94
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,313
isn't she?

95
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,733
Protecting her, you…

96
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,985
you broke your promise.

97
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,370
I was curious

98
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,166
about humans at first 'cause Mom is one.

99
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,421
So I said "hi" and they…

100
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,007
they hurt me.

101
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,803
They yelled and they pushed and…

102
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,305
and they hurt me too.

103
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,684
And they killed
all my friends and monsters!

104
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,230
Leaving only just me.

105
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,694
They were just scared.

106
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,366
Afraid of losing someone.

107
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,745
Then I'll give them a reason.

108
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,168
Show them how scary it was.

109
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,799
You should feel it too.

110
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,053
I'm talking about my pain.

111
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,180
You'll feel it too.

112
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,147
I came to tell you that, that's all.

113
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,570
Let's get out of here.

114
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,072
Huh?

115
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,704
There's no place for me.

116
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,749
My house is gone.

117
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,511
<i>I…</i>

118
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,430
no longer need you,

119
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,599
or Mom anymore.

120
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,188
Yi-kyung!

121
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,191
Are you in here?

122
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,457
Yi-kyung…

123
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,907
Hyun-su.

124
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,703
Are you okay, Yi-kyung?

125
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,123
It's all my fault it's like this.

126
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,793
I just wanted her
to be safe like you were.

127
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:41,925
All I wanted was for her to…

128
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,927
It wasn't your fault.

129
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,900
I should've killed her.

130
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,155
In the back of my mind,
I always had that thought.

131
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,240
I know…

132
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:09,411
I know she must've felt it
when I had those thoughts.

133
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:12,831
You're wrong.

134
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,542
I know because I was there too.

135
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,422
You said you were a bad mother,
but you know that's just not true.

136
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,424
The fault is all mine.

137
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,679
I was the one who made her like this.

138
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,350
No, this is good.

139
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,520
It turning out like this is for the best.

140
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,024
This way, when…

141
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,613
I don't have to kill my daughter.

142
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,118
Were you really going to kill her?

143
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,164
Why? You're her mother.

144
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,208
So why?

145
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,918
I don't deserve to be.

146
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,922
I had the same thought hundreds of times.

147
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:08,512
"Why is she cursed like this?" Why?

148
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,391
It's all my fault.

149
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,227
My awful thoughts and desires

150
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,021
turned her…

151
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,191
into a…

152
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,029
monster.

153
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,448
Yeah, so what?

154
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,369
Are monsters really all bad?

155
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,427
This one saved you.

156
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,680
Saved you 'cause you're family.

157
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:54,933
You see, monsters

158
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,269
feel and recognize people.

159
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,188
'Cause they were human once too.

160
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,858
What's with you?

161
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,069
Open your eyes!

162
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,031
What the hell are you doing?

163
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,533
I think he's dead, boss.

164
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:56,786
What's going on?

165
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,542
What's going on with him?
What happened here?

166
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,294
He's been poisoned.

167
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,130
How much did he eat?

168
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,926
He had one bowl of that.

169
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,053
He had a whole bowl?

170
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,397
What was in this?

171
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,440
Mushrooms.

172
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,901
The magic kind.

173
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,320
This one's got a high tolerance.

174
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,740
But he's gonna need an antidote.

175
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,034
Hey!

176
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,288
Hey, wake up!

177
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,222
<i>That asshole.</i>

178
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:01,142
How many times is it now?

179
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:07,107
As if enlisting in the army
without telling me wasn't enough,

180
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:11,111
now he's gonna make me cry
over some bitch?

181
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,115
PARK CHAN-YEONG

182
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,867
Shit. You know what? Screw you!

183
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,123
I'll take it if you're throwing it away.

184
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,795
Seriously.

185
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,508
You think this is something
anyone could wear?

186
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,594
I found a whole stack of them
up there the other day.

187
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,803
No, it's not.

188
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:41,016
This was Chan-yeong's gift to me
and he's signed it too, just so you know.

189
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,476
Why did you throw it then
if it's so important?

190
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,939
You're so annoying.

191
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,943
- Ready to head out?
- For what?

192
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,069
And where?

193
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,740
We're gonna go meet
with Father Peter today, remember?

194
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,742
I'm not really in the mood.

195
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,328
Come on. I don't wanna go alone.

196
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,083
Let me come with you, sir.

197
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,043
No.

198
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,587
This is personal.

199
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,131
That makes no sense.
How is finding Yong-seok personal, sir?

200
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,175
Don't be dramatic, dumbass.

201
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,094
Let them know tomorrow.

202
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,555
That I went after Yong-seok.

203
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,015
I can't do that, I'm afraid.

204
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,394
I'm sorry, Sarge.

205
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,564
I have to make sure you're safe.

206
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,863
I heard the signal came from Bamseom.

207
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,159
That's correct, sir.

208
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,369
You can't do it alone.

209
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,621
Take some men with you at least.

210
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,626
If I may, why the sudden change of heart?

211
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,670
Since we're all heading the same way,

212
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,213
let me hitch a ride, all right?

213
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,595
Sergeant, right now,
it doesn't really matter.

214
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,805
Just make sure

215
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,641
to focus on getting back here alive.

216
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,268
I'm going.

217
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,688
Yong-seok's my boy too, isn't he?

218
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,359
- No, you should stay, man.
- Hey, Kim Yeong-hu.

219
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,778
Let me go on this with you, man.

220
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,781
We're brothers, did I get that wrong?

221
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:20,699
Hey.

222
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,244
But what if they get both of us,
then what?

223
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,746
Who's gonna lead the unit then?

224
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,127
Seo-jin…

225
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,672
I'll find Yong-seok.

226
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,636
Trust me on this one.

227
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,430
I do.

228
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,683
You've always been better at everything.

229
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:48,977
But this is one I can't…

230
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,730
This is one I can't back out of.

231
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,400
I can't just sit back while you guys go.

232
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,737
So just take me.

233
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,655
'Cause I mean…

234
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,575
If it's a bust
and none of you make it back…

235
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,411
I'll be useless.

236
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,292
Wow, you two are really
making it dramatic here.

237
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,502
But I'm coming as well, Sarge.

238
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,879
Well, I'm also coming, sir.

239
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,922
Bravo! Whoa!

240
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,382
Am I the only one cringing?

241
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,800
Whoo, just got chills.

242
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,177
Let's roll out.

243
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,344
Man, what am I doing?

244
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,431
I can't drive with my hand like this.
Let's go! Let's go!

245
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,936
Damn, it's too dark to see anything
with these on.

246
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:33,855
Let's go!

247
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:04,969
What's going on?

248
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,684
What's wrong? Why aren't you talking?

249
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,689
I really can't right now.

250
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,275
- I need some drinks.
- Hmm?

251
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,372
So you're just gonna steal
in plain sight like that.

252
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,207
Let me take the booze.

253
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:35,625
I'll pay.

254
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,086
Got any more?

255
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,421
Come on then.

256
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,020
{\an8}So, uh…

257
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,815
{\an8}are you gonna accept her or not?

258
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,610
Stop it. He's a priest.
That's inappropriate.

259
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,612
I mean, why? I didn't say get hitched.

260
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,989
He can date, can't he?

261
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,408
That's enough.

262
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:10,785
Hey.

263
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,371
What's that?
What's going on over there?

264
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,873
You a couple?

265
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,541
Are you playing with my girl here?

266
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:17,959
Just go if you're drunk.

267
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,798
Damn. All men are the same. Pussies.

268
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:25,967
And that's why you're alone.

269
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,138
That sort of shit's
what scares them away, you know?

270
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,015
Get a load of this fucking bitch.

271
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,057
Hey!

272
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,852
You don't fucking know love, do you, huh?

273
00:31:57,874 --> 00:32:00,418
I thought I was turning into
a monster there.

274
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,253
I thought I was hearing things.

275
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,213
Gosh, don't say things like that!

276
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,716
That last incident
was only a few days ago.

277
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,927
Yo!

278
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:13,514
When's the last time
you heard music, huh? Right?

279
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:17,810
You've got quite the odds
and ends, Father.

280
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,522
Pay up first.
You better confess if you want a drink.

281
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,399
I know you skipped out earlier.

282
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,777
Man, oh, man, that's harsh.

283
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,946
She's right, I mean,
what did you even bring?

284
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,538
Oh, wait, what?

285
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,249
I mean, greed makes monsters of us all.

286
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,377
The only cure for that
is to love and share.

287
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,504
Being a monster doesn't sound so bad.

288
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,631
Live a long life.

289
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,300
Never get sick again.

290
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,261
Or feel scared.

291
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,433
- Hey.
- That's right.

292
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,895
Sure. Living like this day to day
really sucks, but…

293
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,563
but we're still all here, huh?

294
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,693
I'm fine as long as I don't turn into
one of them.

295
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,404
That's about all I can ask for.

296
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,323
There's so much
that I wanna go out and do.

297
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,702
If I could just hurry up
and get out of here.

298
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,121
It's a bit hard here.

299
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:21,791
What about you, Father?

300
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,293
You're always listening to us,

301
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,421
how about you talk this time?

302
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,380
Hear, hear.

303
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,799
- We're all ears.
- Let's hear it.

304
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,094
There isn't a before and after
for me, really.

305
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,514
Nothing's really different.

306
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,354
This is great.

307
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,274
I love this broken world.

308
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,989
Look how well we get along
now that we are all equals.

309
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,783
I'm so content.

310
00:33:58,661 --> 00:33:59,912
I bet you were in debt.

311
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,330
You'd be dead wrong.

312
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,707
Stop talking out of your ass.

313
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,208
Bullshit. You were homeless.

314
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:08,379
How any rich person would rather
be boozing it up here, is ridiculous--

315
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,505
Ugh!

316
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,632
Ugh, I can't.

317
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,634
I, Jung Ye-seul,

318
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,429
need to lighten this depressing mood.

319
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,889
Get up.

320
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,309
All right. And here we go.

321
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,930
I might have to change the sign.

322
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,804
You seem happy, Doc.

323
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:43,057
You wouldn't get it, Sergeant,
being that you come up here all the time.

324
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,184
You try staying holed up for a year.

325
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,148
It's all a breath of fresh air, huh?

326
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,150
Oh, I bet you're a special case, Doctor.

327
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,943
Most people would be scared.

328
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,071
That bag, what's in there?

329
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,326
A secret box.

330
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,619
What's in there?

331
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,121
I just said it's a secret.

332
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:07,707
{\an8}The more people know,
the less it's a secret.

333
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,926
Stop!

334
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,012
Stop!

335
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,264
Stop! Stop!

336
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:27,018
No. Stop! Stop!

337
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:30,229
Stop! Stop!

338
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,190
Oh, God.

339
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,109
Oh, shit.

340
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,403
Stop!

341
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,032
What's the matter?

342
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,367
My stomach is…

343
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,328
We're almost there, man.

344
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,163
No, this is an emergency, actually.

345
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,915
I'll make it quick. One second.

346
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,752
- Jong-hyun, hey.
- Sir.

347
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,086
You're on.

348
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:55,880
Ah, shit.

349
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,011
Why the hell
would you bring that with you?

350
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,554
Doesn't hurt to be prepared.

351
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:05,598
Oh, God.

352
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:25,993
<i>Hey, Jong-hyun,</i>
<i>is he about done?</i>

353
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,120
Looks like it'll take a minute.

354
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,622
Jesus, what the hell did he eat?

355
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:30,581
<i>Stay alert.</i>

356
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,959
Yes, sir, I'm on it.

357
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,226
Sir, we've got movement ahead.

358
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,186
<i>Requesting cover.</i>

359
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,271
Roger that.

360
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,941
Sergeant, do you have visuals?

361
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,443
I've got nothing here.

362
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,989
Seok-chan, get ready to drive.

363
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:03,948
Yes, sir.

364
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,420
- Hey, I wiped, okay?
- Shh.

365
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:23,884
What is that?

366
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,148
Leave it there.

367
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:39,900
I won't do that.

368
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,905
Damn it.

369
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:48,951
Fuck me.

370
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,412
Run!

371
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,449
Faster!

372
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,069
- Whoa, don't hit that.
- Fuck this shit.

373
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,904
- I'm right here, okay?
- What the fuck's in your bag?

374
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,698
I almost broke my arm. It's so heavy.

375
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,075
That's why stretching is important.

376
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,327
Are you hiding something?

377
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,538
I'm not, okay?

378
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,748
Hey. Jong-hyun, open it.

379
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,209
Whoa, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on. Hold on. Ugh!

380
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,588
Fuck me. Is this guy for real?

381
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,424
We should just toss it.
What the fuck are we doing?

382
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,303
I didn't realize
you're so scared, Sergeant.

383
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:13,512
This one's already dead.

384
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,557
That's what I'm saying.
What's the fucking point of all this?

385
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:19,727
What? Some kind of monster museum?

386
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,770
- Those monsters…
- Jeez.

387
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,023
The monsters just now.

388
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,692
You noticed it too.

389
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,113
Monsters don't recognize each other.

390
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:34,408
They never hunt as a group or go after…

391
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,744
a single target.

392
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,621
- Then what did we see?
- Right.

393
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,414
Swarming all at once,

394
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,625
- like they were ambushing us.
- They were organized.

395
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,169
What? Are you saying
they set a trap for us?

396
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,672
Could've been they were trying
to protect their location.

397
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,368
Shit.

398
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,080
Oh. Shit, really?

399
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:09,837
What's that?

400
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,147
It's bitter. Just chew it.
No swallowing and don't spit.

401
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,524
I'm good.

402
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,984
I don't want anything from you.

403
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,738
Take his ass out of here before he dies.

404
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,329
This is the cure?

405
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:48,208
Could you tell me
what I'm feeding him at least, huh?

406
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:52,296
What? You're worried I'm gonna poison
a dying bastard?

407
00:43:58,218 --> 00:43:59,178
Open up.

408
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:00,929
Chew it.

409
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,391
Just shut up and chew.

410
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:24,888
Move out.

411
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,643
Look how quickly everything changed.

412
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,769
Hey, wait.

413
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,480
It's been only a year.

414
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,109
How can it change this much in a year?

415
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:39,486
Nature always finds a way.

416
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,741
What do you mean, sir?

417
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:45,659
With humans gone,

418
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,494
nature's starting to heal.

419
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:38,712
Clear.

420
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:52,559
- Seok-chan.
- Yes, sir, what is it?

421
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,520
Does doing that help?

422
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,772
As much as anything, I guess.

423
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,733
Think we're okay, sir?

424
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,653
Why are you asking me?

425
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,696
Why don't you ask your higher power, man?

426
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,408
I thought I was doing just that, Sergeant.

427
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,705
Don't ask me, jackass.

428
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,876
You'll be coming with me,
Dr. Lim.

429
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,586
Seok-chan, you too.

430
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,587
Yes.

431
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,840
- Understood.
- What, we're not all going together?

432
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,425
That's a little scary.

433
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,052
Just a bit.

434
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,265
Seo-jin, take the men
and go find Yong-seok, all right?

435
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,182
On it.

436
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,809
Whoever's first, meet up with the other.

437
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,519
Hey, Seo-jin.

438
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:40,274
Watch your back and stay alive.

439
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,570
Go.

440
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,494
Which way are we heading?

441
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:53,704
To my sector over there.

442
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,372
The research laboratory?

443
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,001
Are you good in a pinch?

444
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,044
Killing monsters and all that?

445
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,170
Let's hope you are.

446
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,548
'Cause God knows what's waiting in here.

447
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,091
Let's move.

448
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,071
You're always drawing that house.

449
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:30,324
Mm. It's my house.

450
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:34,244
Have they said when we can go home?
I'm missing my house.

451
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,370
Not right now.

452
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,915
I hope that we can, eventually.

453
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,250
It's taking forever.

454
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:41,919
You won't go back.

455
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:44,087
Yeong-su.

456
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,632
It's all a bunch of lies.

457
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:49,885
And doesn't lying make us monsters
like Jun-il's mom?

458
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:52,179
You're being bad,
Yeong-su, huh?

459
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,473
You should stop trying so hard to be good.

460
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:56,099
You might end up dead.

461
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,644
- Kim Yeong-su.
- Don't touch me!

462
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,395
Why should I listen
to what you have to say?

463
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:01,980
You're not even my real mom!

464
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,113
Why do you even bother with that kid?

465
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,410
I really don't wanna hear it.
Do me a favor and get out.

466
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,374
I don't think they're doing much better.

467
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:21,667
You think so?

468
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:25,379
I just hope this search is uneventful,
if you know what I mean.

469
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,757
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean, what do you mean?

470
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,926
You could bring the ceiling down
looking for ants.

471
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:34,137
Even a little house can fall apart.
A place this massive?

472
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,056
Jesus, God knows.

473
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,183
You're exaggerating, come on!

474
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:40,852
And if we work hard, we might get
a little something extra.

475
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,020
Come on.

476
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,360
You're going for it?

477
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:50,862
No reason not to.

478
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:55,325
Seriously.

479
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,954
You don't have to do right, Ye-seul.

480
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,498
Why are you still working so hard, huh?

481
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,291
The Chief already takes good care of you.

482
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,836
Just trying to do my part, you know.

483
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:08,088
Just doing what I can,
not to embarrass her.

484
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,466
Ah! Ye-seul, your heart's just as…

485
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,719
beautiful as you are.

486
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:15,679
Sir.

487
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:18,432
Whoa, hey, now, I'm no "sir," okay?

488
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,225
I'm around your age, Ye-seul.

489
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:21,560
And how old is that?

490
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:23,895
Uh, well…

491
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,440
What is this? Do you like me?

492
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,526
Uh, well, I can't say I don't…

493
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,946
There isn't one guy here
who isn't crushing on you.

494
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,448
The thing is…

495
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,617
it's not mutual.

496
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:39,786
There's no chance.

497
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:43,165
Not even if hell rose.
Even if the world ended.

498
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,759
Wow, jeez, I mean…

499
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:55,761
What was that?

500
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,290
Ye-seul.

501
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,255
Help me, would you?

502
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,632
You're the only one I can trust.

503
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,343
Hmm?

504
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,527
The search party sent a signal?

505
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,821
Yes, sir. They arrived
at Bamseom now it seems.

506
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,614
Can we make contact?

507
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,993
They're too far, sir. It'll be difficult.

508
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:47,122
Report back if you receive another signal.

509
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:48,707
Yes, sir. Understood.

510
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:53,879
What? What's this?

511
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:55,839
What is it?

512
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:15,192
EMERGENCY
WARNING

513
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,282
EMERGENCY
DANGER

514
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,369
Something's jamming our signal, sir.

515
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:29,497
<i>I'm sure of it.</i>

516
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:30,957
I'm telling you, I heard it.

517
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,125
Inside the walls.

518
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:34,544
It was… It sounded like a monster.

519
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,421
You can tell Master Sergeant Tak.

520
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,422
Oh, yeah.

521
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:39,466
Sir. Uh…

522
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,383
Whoa.

523
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:45,388
This seems like…

524
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:46,973
Sir, it seems…

525
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,810
there's a creature here
inside the stadium.

526
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:11,915
Sir?

527
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,418
There's…

528
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:18,088
- a monster signal here.
- What the…?

529
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:27,722
Damn.

530
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:40,860
What's going on here?

531
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,279
Emergency roll call.

532
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,738
If you'll follow us to the plaza.

533
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:51,663
I'll head over.

534
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:54,666
Ma'am, right now, I mean.

535
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,168
We're here on orders
from the Master Sergeant.

536
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,713
Did you find an exit then?

537
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:00,672
No, ma'am.

538
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,967
We think there might be
a monster in the building.

539
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:22,277
They had this room
full of monster detectors,

540
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,696
and "beep, beep" all at once, like crazy!

541
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:25,905
So it's for real?

542
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:29,909
Were you there, man? Huh?
Did you see it yourself?

543
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,954
Hey, if it wasn't for me,
we'd all be monster chow.

544
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,968
Ugh, Jesus. This man makes me sick.

545
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:48,678
Me too.

546
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:53,558
Why are you alone?

547
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,448
You ran away?

548
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,075
Look who's talking.

549
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:11,993
That's different.

550
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:14,412
We had a spat, that's all.

551
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,833
God, you really are the opposite of cute.

552
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:28,301
As I got older,
I realized… it's all my fault.

553
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:32,972
When the adults tell you to do something,
there's a good reason for it.

554
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,517
So, apologize to your mother.

555
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,103
That's too bad. She's long gone.

556
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:42,774
What the…

557
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:44,484
Too bad you can have more than one.

558
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,654
You can even have two,
or even three, okay?

559
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,156
And Ms. Jin-ok is your mother.

560
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:53,326
Little brat.

561
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,667
Chief!

562
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,039
Wha-what's going on?

563
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,917
- Is the monster in here?
- Hurry up and kill it.

564
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:45,211
This wouldn't happen
if Crow Platoon was doing its job.

565
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:12,614
Today's monster incident will get resolved
by Crow Platoon in due time.

566
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,409
No one can escape from this.

567
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:19,245
This is the nature of our catastrophe.

568
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,165
Family, friends,

569
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,167
lovers, we all had to watch

570
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:27,170
people we care about die.

571
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:29,088
And that won't be the last time.

572
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,217
So keep your guard up

573
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:35,094
in order to maintain our safe haven here.

574
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,163
Hang on
and fight with everything you've got

575
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:04,666
instead of just asking others
for their help.

576
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:06,918
If you don't strengthen your mind,

577
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:10,088
you're going to end up consumed.

578
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:14,801
From now on,

579
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:19,180
those with symptoms who hide it from us

580
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:22,350
will have to face immediate judgment.

581
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:26,354
We request your cooperation

582
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,106
to avoid that.

583
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:31,568
Good God. What… what's he getting at?

584
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,778
Sounds like if we're sick,
they're gonna execute us.

585
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:36,698
They just declared
a reign of terror just now.

586
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,491
Hey, about the detectors earlier.

587
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:41,536
So what? Did they find it
or are they still looking, huh?

588
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:42,662
Are we safe then?

589
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,497
Ah, they handled it, I'm sure.

590
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,717
What a rousing speech.

591
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:58,261
But it's missing something.

592
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,892
You should stop hiding behind your men

593
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:09,147
and lead by example.
Won't you, Master Sergeant Tak?

594
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:26,205
Master Sergeant Tak?
Sir, you don't have to do this.

595
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:25,139
Shit.

596
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,411
There's no time to lose.

597
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,942
- Does this look right?
- I think so.

598
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:20,486
I noticed

599
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:22,989
you haven't asked what we're looking for.

600
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,115
You're not curious?

601
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:26,117
Is it for your research?

602
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,494
If that's all I need to know,
then I don't need to know.

603
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:33,666
I just need to make sure
we fulfill our objectives.

604
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,543
{\an8}If it's important…

605
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,505
{\an8}couldn't someone have taken it already?

606
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:40,465
{\an8}They wouldn't find it.

607
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,759
{\an8}I hid it very, very well.

608
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:45,470
You sure are confident.

609
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:46,888
Of course.

610
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:48,681
What we're looking for…

611
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:51,768
isn't really a thing.

612
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:56,481
Oh, shit.

613
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:27,345
It smells crazy in here.
Jesus Christ!

614
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,263
The smell might get us first.

615
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:36,354
Stop.

616
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:42,193
Something's here.

617
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:02,004
U-seok!

618
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:03,464
U-seok!

619
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:10,137
U-seok!

620
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,267
U-seok!

621
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,226
Oh, shit.

622
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,887
You fucking bastards.

623
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,851
From this point on,

624
01:04:58,102 --> 01:04:59,770
kill everything on fucking sight.

625
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:24,754
What the…?

626
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,423
What… How did it…

627
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:38,851
Doctor, I need you to fall back.

628
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:39,936
<i>Yeong-hu.</i>

629
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:40,937
<i>Yeong-hu.</i>

630
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:43,522
<i>They got U-seok.</i>

631
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:52,823
<i>Yeong-hu. Yeong-hu!</i>

632
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:54,200
Seo-jin, what's your status?

633
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:00,539
Come in. What's your status?

634
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:02,667
Sergeant Min!

635
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:25,481
U-seok?

636
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:28,401
U-seok?

637
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:32,113
What are you doing, man?

638
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,198
U-seok, wake up, man.

639
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:36,033
U-seok, talk to me. U-seok!

640
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:37,660
Hey!

641
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:39,745
Wake up, man! Hey!

642
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,247
Answer me! Okay?

643
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:42,707
Talk to me.

644
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:43,958
Man!

645
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:45,751
Grab on. Grab on!

646
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:50,256
U-seok. U-seok!

647
01:06:51,215 --> 01:06:52,800
{\an8}Sarge! Sir, we have to…

648
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:54,885
{\an8}We have to go!

649
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:56,012
We have to…

650
01:06:56,887 --> 01:06:59,140
He's already dead, sir. We have to go.

651
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:01,267
U-seok's already dead, sir!

652
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:11,527
{\an8}- U-seok.
- Jesus!

653
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:13,529
{\an8}Pull yourself together, sir. Please!

654
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:15,656
{\an8}- U-seok. U-seok!
- Oh, fuck!

655
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:23,205
- We have to go.
- U-seok…

656
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:24,915
Fuck.

657
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,251
- U-seok.
- Snap out of it!

658
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:28,294
- U-seok.
- Please.

659
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:49,023
Sergeant Min.

660
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:50,649
Sergeant Min, answer me.

661
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:52,943
Fuck.

662
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:55,571
Hey, Seok-chan, tell the men…

663
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,672
Fuck.

664
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:17,927
They were monsters.

665
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:21,388
- The monsters are changing.
- Are you saying…

666
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:25,017
these were all monsters?

667
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:33,067
Shit.

668
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:36,070
Don't touch anything.

669
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:39,990
Do you need a reminder?

670
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:43,285
Are you telling me
I have to leave this behind?

671
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:44,245
Why would I?

672
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:46,622
I'm just telling you
not to compromise the mission.

673
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:50,793
Sergeant.

674
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:52,461
This is how things are.

675
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:58,259
If you truly want something,
you have to be ready to make sacrifices.

676
01:08:58,342 --> 01:08:59,718
I know you know this, Sergeant.

677
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,679
I know this is what you signed up for.

678
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:04,014
I need you to get this through your head,
do you hear me?

679
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:06,392
My men are not expendable,
but you just might be.

680
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:09,353
So you're saying that I can just
look at them from a distance?

681
01:09:09,436 --> 01:09:10,563
Look but don't touch?

682
01:09:12,606 --> 01:09:14,733
- Oh, seriously?
- We're finding your lab.

683
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:15,860
Is something wrong, sir?

684
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:19,738
I think something happened to the others.

685
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:22,867
They're not answering comms.
We need to find them right away.

686
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:26,871
- Let's go.
- You're not suggesting we leave now.

687
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:29,290
I can't do that.

688
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,208
I'm not going anywhere.

689
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:33,627
I can't leave this place empty-handed.

690
01:09:35,462 --> 01:09:37,965
Then what are you suggesting, Doctor, huh?

691
01:09:38,048 --> 01:09:39,592
Are you gonna stay behind?

692
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,307
Okay, okay. I get it. Sheesh.

693
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:48,100
Look…

694
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:51,645
I mean, I'll only slow you down
right now, so…

695
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:55,816
I'll wait out there
once I'm finished in here.

696
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:58,402
- Sounds risky.
- I'm telling you, I'll be fine.

697
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:03,240
Well, now what?
Don't you have men you need to rescue?

698
01:10:10,664 --> 01:10:11,790
Very well then.

699
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:14,460
Let's go.

700
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:23,135
Recover the asset and make sure
you don't touch anything else on the way.

701
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:24,220
Am I clear?

702
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:26,597
Yeah, yeah, don't worry. I'm a coward.

703
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,766
I won't try anything. Now go.

704
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:31,560
Let's go.

705
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:55,334
- I'm fine, thanks.
- Huh?

706
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,212
No, careful, you'll fall.

707
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:01,340
Sit, sit, sit, sit.

708
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:07,263
So, which is it?

709
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:11,767
A brother? A boss? A dad?

710
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:14,436
What are you to each other?

711
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:16,230
Why the hell does it matter?

712
01:11:16,313 --> 01:11:17,898
You just eat and get lost.

713
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:22,861
Um, why don't you come back with us?

714
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:24,530
You'll be safer there.

715
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:26,615
Are we getting married then?

716
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:29,702
Uh, that's… that's not what I'm saying.

717
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:32,037
Safe? You guys have just been lucky.

718
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:35,332
That, or you don't know better.

719
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,294
I think you might be underestimating
some of us.

720
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:40,296
I don't trust humans, okay?

721
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:42,506
I'm not surprised.

722
01:11:42,589 --> 01:11:44,508
But you don't trust monsters either?

723
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:47,511
And what about her?

724
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:49,430
You trust her?

725
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:57,146
Sure seems like it.

726
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:02,568
Let's go with them.
Let's go together, teacher, hmm?

727
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:04,820
Hey, let's go.

728
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:09,825
What are you doing here?

729
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:47,613
Please help.

730
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:51,742
This was the only place I could turn to.

731
01:13:09,468 --> 01:13:10,886
How did she get like this?

732
01:13:11,678 --> 01:13:14,139
And the kid? The girl who left with you?

733
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:16,475
First, get her inside.

734
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:19,061
- Give me a hand.
- Okay.

735
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:32,032
Don't, sir!

736
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:33,867
You dare come crawling out here?

737
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:35,077
Stop it.

738
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:36,995
Stop, please.

739
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,330
I thought I was clear.

740
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,249
Don't bring any damn monsters here.

741
01:13:40,332 --> 01:13:41,583
Why don't we talk this out?

742
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:44,586
- He's the person she's been looking for.
- Does that thing look human to you?

743
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:53,345
Take one fucking step,

744
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,805
move a single muscle,

745
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:58,267
and I'll cut her fucking head off.

746
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:02,396
Way to prove my point about humans.

747
01:14:03,063 --> 01:14:05,899
Pulling this shit
after I saved your life is rich.

748
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:07,484
I said I'll take him with me.

749
01:14:08,068 --> 01:14:10,779
I said I'll take him,
so just… what's your problem?

750
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:13,073
You're with monsters,
that makes you a threat.

751
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:16,034
And you call yourself human? Jesus.

752
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:18,662
What makes you special?

753
01:14:19,204 --> 01:14:21,123
How are you sure you're gonna stay immune?

754
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:24,084
What if you were
to start showing symptoms?

755
01:14:25,335 --> 01:14:27,296
Seems a bullet is your only option.

756
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:29,465
Since monsters have to die.

757
01:14:30,048 --> 01:14:32,301
Stop it.

758
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:34,845
And her?

759
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:37,848
Could you put a bullet in her?

760
01:14:40,392 --> 01:14:42,102
How about I save you the trouble?

761
01:14:45,022 --> 01:14:47,483
Oh, yeah. So this is who you are.

762
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:49,067
Stop it.

763
01:14:49,776 --> 01:14:50,944
Don't do this, Eun-yu.

764
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,372
Ha-ni.

765
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:19,014
Let's get out of here.

766
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:30,943
You're just gonna stand there?

767
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,576
In this life, we weren't meant to be,

768
01:15:40,994 --> 01:15:42,204
maybe the next one.

769
01:15:43,163 --> 01:15:45,582
Get rid of the girl though.

770
01:16:08,188 --> 01:16:09,398
Are you okay to move?

771
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:12,150
How's your shoulder?

772
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:16,989
It's okay.

773
01:16:22,786 --> 01:16:24,037
I think we'd better go.

774
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:26,707
Monsters might have heard the gunfire.

775
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:43,682
Let's go.

776
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:01,617
Hypocrite.

777
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:04,369
Goddamn coward.

778
01:17:05,037 --> 01:17:07,831
Are you going to say
you had no choice again?

779
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:10,334
You're just running from the truth.

780
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:17,883
You've been screwing up every decision
one after another.

781
01:18:09,726 --> 01:18:11,478
<i>Aren't you gonna protect them?</i>

782
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:14,231
<i>Dad!</i>

783
01:18:14,314 --> 01:18:15,148
DAD
HELP ME

784
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:16,525
<i>Help me!</i>

785
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:19,778
<i>Does this look like protection to you?</i>

786
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,156
<i>I'm scared.</i>

787
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:24,449
<i>Just come clean.</i>

788
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:25,784
<i>Dad!</i>

789
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:29,705
<i>Just tell everyone</i>
<i>that the monster in the stadium is you.</i>

790
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:39,881
Sir?

791
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:41,550
Sir, may I come in?

792
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:57,983
Sir? We have a problem.

793
01:19:04,448 --> 01:19:05,407
Sir?

794
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:13,915
Sir, can you hear me?
