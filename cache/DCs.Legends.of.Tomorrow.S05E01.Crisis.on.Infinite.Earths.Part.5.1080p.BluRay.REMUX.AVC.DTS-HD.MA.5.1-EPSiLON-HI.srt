- [Alex] Well, look who's finally...
- [screams]

5
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:20,772
- Awake.
- Alex?

6
00:00:21,315 --> 00:00:22,941
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

7
00:00:23,025 --> 00:00:24,335
No, no, no, it's okay. It's okay.

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,278
Are... are you okay?
Did you have a bad dream?

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,280
I don't know. [gasps] I'm...

10
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:31,033
How did I get here?

11
00:00:31,867 --> 00:00:34,036
Well, you fell asleep
in front of the TV

12
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:35,579
and you just looked so peaceful,

13
00:00:35,662 --> 00:00:37,622
so I didn't have the heart
to move you to the bed.

14
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:40,542
The dawn of time.

15
00:00:41,293 --> 00:00:42,294
Dawn of time.

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,772
Is that what you were watching
before you nodded off?

17
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:45,881
Wait.

18
00:00:46,423 --> 00:00:47,799
What is...

19
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:50,552
This isn't right.

20
00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:53,397
Okay, well, I mean, it's right,
but it's not right because it's right.

21
00:00:53,472 --> 00:00:56,266
Uh-huh. The White Martian
did a number on you last night.

22
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,144
"White Martian." White Martian.
White Martian.

23
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:01,480
[Alex] Listen, I gotta run.
Kelly and I are trying out

24
00:01:01,563 --> 00:01:03,315
a new indoor rowing class downtown.

25
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:06,151
So, are you... You sure you're okay?

26
00:01:06,235 --> 00:01:07,736
I'm fine.

27
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:09,238
[clears throat] I'm fine.

It's good to hear your voice.

35
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,092
Well, it would be better to see my face.

36
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:32,302
Where are you?
The ceremony is about to start.

37
00:01:32,386 --> 00:01:33,386
"Ceremony"?

38
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,764
They're awarding
the Nobel Peace Prize any minute.

I saved you a seat, but...

That lady from the <i>Gazette</i>
is giving me angry eyes.

42

[sighs] If you miss this,
Andrea's gonna blow a gasket.

43

00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:47,733
Good timing.

45
00:01:49,236 --> 00:01:51,863
Hey, uh... I had a really
weird dream last night.

46
00:01:51,947 --> 00:01:53,782
Could you maybe help me interpret it?

47
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:54,865
What happened?

48
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,535
Uh, the world ended.

49
00:01:56,618 --> 00:01:58,996
But, like, all the worlds.

50
00:02:00,247 --> 00:02:01,456
All of them.

51
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:04,418
That's dramatic, even for us.

52
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:07,129
[host] And now, I am proud to introduce

53
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:09,715
the winner of this year's
Nobel Peace Prize,

54
00:02:09,798 --> 00:02:11,300
Lex Luthor.

55
00:02:17,014 --> 00:02:18,140
Nia?

56
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:20,100
Nia, am I still dreaming?

57
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:21,183
I know, right?

58
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:24,813
It is so great when this award goes to
someone who actually deserves it.

[theme music playing]

60
00:02:39,786 --> 00:02:41,997
We live in dangerous times.

61
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:45,542
Earth is a dangerous place.

62
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:49,129
I suppose that's why
people love superheroes so much.

63
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:52,924
The power, the chutzpah...

64
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:56,470
Of someone who can fly
faster than a speeding bullet.

65
00:02:57,846 --> 00:03:00,515
But that's what makes this so special.

66
00:03:01,183 --> 00:03:02,809
I don't have any powers.

67
00:03:02,893 --> 00:03:05,562
I can't leap tall buildings
in a single bound.

68
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:08,023
But I have dedicated my life

69
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:10,984
to fighting on the side of humanity,

70
00:03:11,443 --> 00:03:15,030
and to be recognized for that
is more than I can put into words.

71
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:16,698
So, I will just say...

72
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:19,785
I stand with mankind.

73
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:21,328
[cheering, applause]

74
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:27,125
I'm gonna throw up.

75
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:29,086
Are you still feeling weird?

76
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:31,397
We should get you to the med bay.
You did not seem okay this morning.

77
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:34,049
No, no, I'm fine. I'm just disoriented.

78
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:35,425
The world is...

79
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:38,261
What was Lex doing up there?

80
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:40,281
Well, they keep throwing
all these awards at him.

81
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:41,866
He doesn't
usually accept them in person,

82
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,350
but this one meant a lot to him.

83
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:44,768
People think he's a good guy?

84
00:03:45,227 --> 00:03:47,187
Kara, we're talking about Lex Luthor.

85
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:49,022
He's the best guy.

86
00:03:49,106 --> 00:03:50,064
No, he's not.

87
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:52,025
He's a psychopathic lunatic!

88
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:53,902
What? No, he...

89
00:03:54,111 --> 00:03:55,195
He's the boss.

90
00:03:55,695 --> 00:03:57,406
And he's your number-one supporter.

91
00:03:57,489 --> 00:03:58,573
I mean, besides Lena.

92
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:01,410
And all the times
they defended you to the President...

93
00:04:01,493 --> 00:04:02,911
What has gotten into you?

94
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:05,080
Hang on.

95
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:07,332
Wait... Wait, did you just say "boss"?

96
00:04:13,422 --> 00:04:14,422
No.

97
00:04:15,507 --> 00:04:17,384
Oh, no, no, no, no.

98
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:19,886
Alex, are we...

100

J'onn?

101
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:24,057
I know you must be confused.

102
00:04:24,558 --> 00:04:25,684
I was too.

103
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:27,310
But it happened.

104
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:30,147
It all happened.

105
00:04:30,564 --> 00:04:32,232
Why are we the only two that remember?

106
00:04:32,524 --> 00:04:34,025
What are we that they are not?

107
00:04:34,484 --> 00:04:35,569
Paragons.

108
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:37,612
We helped Oliver restart the universe.

109
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:39,072
And this...

110
00:04:39,573 --> 00:04:41,074
Is the result.

111
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:43,076
I suspect there will be
more such changes

112
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,661
that are yet to reveal themselves.

I'm sorry, who are you?

Weather Witch.

123
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:20,113
And you are no match for my wrath.

124

Uh, I'm having... Not so great a day,

Sorry. She's one of mine.

00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:35,086
Well, what's she doing on my Earth?

129
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,254
What?

Wait... Wait, what are you
doing on my Earth?

Supergirl? Flash?

I just love it when you guys team up.

135

Would you sign this for me, please?

Okay. Oh.

Sure, um...

Wait, you know both of us?

139

And it's normal to see us together?

140
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:03,323
Well, normally you'd also have
Green Arrow and a Legend or two.

from being destroyed?

167
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:51,931
Wait, was there a crossover?

168
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,100
Were we invited? Did we win?

169
00:07:54,601 --> 00:07:56,361
[J'onn J'onzz]
<i>That's certainly how it looks.</i>

170
00:07:56,394 --> 00:07:57,479
Did you just hear...

171
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:01,358
<i>It's good to see you both safe.</i>

172
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:03,568
J'onn, that's a neat trick.

173
00:08:04,444 --> 00:08:07,322
Wait, you know J'onn J'onzz
from Supergirl's Earth?

174
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:10,116
Of course I know J'onn. Wait, go back.

175
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:12,160
Supergirl has her own Earth?

176
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:13,787
Not any more.

177
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:18,124
When we restarted the universe,
our worlds combined,

178
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,794
and only we Paragons
know it was ever any different.

179
00:08:20,877 --> 00:08:21,961
[sighs]

180
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:23,755
Okay, sorry, guys,
I'm a little lost here.

181
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:25,674
Here, this will be faster.

182
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:30,804
Whoa.

183
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:32,847
There was a multi-verse?

184
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:34,974
It all got destroyed,
there's an evil Batman,

185
00:08:35,058 --> 00:08:36,935
and there's a me that's a super-me?

186
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:39,646
It'll take him some time
to assimilate to this new paradigm.

187
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:41,564
I have been going from city to city,

188
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:44,442
restoring the memories
of our compatriots as best I can.

189
00:08:44,526 --> 00:08:45,819
And what about Oliver?

190
00:08:47,237 --> 00:08:48,697
There's been no sign of him.

191
00:08:52,158 --> 00:08:53,326
Hey, where you going?

192
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:54,911
To find my friend.

193
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:00,709
Oliver!

194
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:06,339
Oliver!

195
00:09:19,144 --> 00:09:20,228
[John] Sara.

196
00:09:22,272 --> 00:09:23,565
No, I need to talk to you guys.

197
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:24,733
We already know.

198
00:09:26,526 --> 00:09:27,527
We already know.

199
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:31,156
Martian J'onn came by
and gave us a splitting headache.

200
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,743
It all happened, didn't it?

201
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,830
He died twice, Sara.

202
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:40,874
Yeah.

203
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:44,961
I wasn't there. [sniffs]

204
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:46,045
Both times.

205
00:09:48,423 --> 00:09:49,966
Both times, I failed him.

206
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:52,177
- Digg...
- I'm so sorry.

207
00:09:53,136 --> 00:09:54,596
It's okay.

208
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:57,474
I wasn't there.

209
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,895
He was my brother.

210
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:04,898
I know.

211
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:06,774
Listen to me.

212
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:09,944
Look, we all... We all died.

213
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:13,782
The entire universe, the multi-verse.

214
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:15,366
Now we're back.

215
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:18,912
That means Oliver, he might be back too.

216
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,126
After the brain dump,

217
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:28,630
we had Felicity run a global search.

218
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:31,257
I mean, nobody's better
at finding people.

219
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:33,635
But they've got to be here to be found.

220
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,386
You don't know, look...

221
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,973
When Oliver died,
he became something else.

222
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:41,392
He called it "the Spectre."

223
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:44,187
And maybe Felicity,
she just can't find him in that form.

224
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,709
Digg, she just
can't find him in this form.

225
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:49,776
Sara.

226
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:52,904
[sighs]

227
00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:57,242
Sara, gone is gone.

228
00:10:58,743 --> 00:10:59,869
He's gone.

229
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:08,294
[gasps]

230
00:11:28,147 --> 00:11:29,147
J'onn.

231
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:31,828
What are you doing here?
Is something wrong?

232
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,111
Not any more.

233
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:34,779
No thanks to him.

234
00:11:35,864 --> 00:11:37,574
Do you know why he's like this?

235
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:40,827
And now, so do you.

236
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:44,789
- [man] <i>Oliver!</i>
- [woman groans]

237
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:52,088
This is all his fault.

238
00:11:52,881 --> 00:11:54,591
He's the one
who released the Anti-Monitor.

239
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:57,468
He paid dearly for his misjudgment,

240
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,888
but not as much as some others.

241
00:12:00,555 --> 00:12:02,515
[gasps]

242
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,143
What happened?

243
00:12:05,393 --> 00:12:07,186
Where am I? How did I get here?

244
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:11,774
You nearly damned us
all to hell, Nash Wells!

245
00:12:11,858 --> 00:12:13,151
[sighs]

246
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:14,444
Well, that's an introduction.

247
00:12:14,527 --> 00:12:16,255
Who the hell are you,
and what are you talking about?

248
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:18,573
You need to stay calm.
Your system's still recovering.

249
00:12:18,698 --> 00:12:19,656
[scoffs]

250
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:21,326
You... You need to calm down.

251
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:24,454
I'm not going to stay here and
get lectured by some government suit...

252
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:33,546
God!

253
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:37,717
I'm sorry.

254
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:39,344
I'm so sorry.

255
00:12:39,469 --> 00:12:40,553
And so you should be.

256
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:43,181
This is all your fault.

257
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:45,391
It is my fault.

258
00:12:46,643 --> 00:12:48,978
But you... You solved it.

259
00:12:49,437 --> 00:12:51,356
You and the others,
you saved the universe.

260
00:12:51,564 --> 00:12:52,732
You fixed my mistake.

261
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,526
Right?

262
00:12:56,569 --> 00:12:57,946
Not entirely.

263
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,910
It's true.

264
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:06,245
[chuckles] We all live
on the same Earth now.

265
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:09,058
Our Earths must have merged when
we helped Oliver reboot the universe.

266
00:13:09,082 --> 00:13:10,333
[chuckles] I can't believe it.

267
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,852
What are you guys doing here?

268
00:13:11,876 --> 00:13:13,252
I had to see if it was true.

269
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:17,006
The DEO, CatCo, all of National City
is on this Earth now.

270
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,257
Even Argo's up there.

271
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:19,550
We did it!

272
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,010
We saved everyone.

273
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:22,887
Not everyone.

274
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:31,604
Oliver...

275
00:13:33,106 --> 00:13:34,107
He didn't make it.

276
00:13:36,693 --> 00:13:38,069
Guess we just have to face facts.

277
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:41,197
No, that's not... That's...

278
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:44,742
Why did he give everyone else
a fresh start, but not himself?

279
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:48,121
Maybe this was the only way, Kara.

280
00:13:49,122 --> 00:13:51,582
Maybe his sacrifice
made all of this possible.

281
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:56,254
Him for us.

282
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:00,967
[alarm beeps]

283
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,593
- What is that?
- We're being attacked.

284
00:14:02,677 --> 00:14:03,677
By who?

285
00:14:09,434 --> 00:14:11,060
You wouldn't believe it if I told you.

286
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:13,771
[all screaming]

287
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:27,285
Beebo hungry.

288
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:30,079
[roars]

289
00:14:36,044 --> 00:14:38,379
How the hell did Beebo get here?

290
00:14:38,463 --> 00:14:39,481
[Rene] Isn't the more pressing question,

291
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,591
why is there a giant Beebo
walking down the street?

292
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:43,384
This wouldn't be the first time.

293
00:14:44,177 --> 00:14:45,720
- It's a long story.
- That's right.

294
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:48,097
Wally told us about the time
you guys used those totems

295
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:50,725
to turn yourselves into a giant Beebo
to find a time demon.

296
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:52,018
I guess it's not a long story.

297
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:53,541
Could that be what's happening here?

298
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:55,411
- [device chirps]
- Ava, Nate, you there?

299
00:14:55,438 --> 00:14:57,648
I need a twenty on Behrad and his totem.

300
00:14:57,732 --> 00:14:59,233
Sara, are you okay?

301
00:14:59,317 --> 00:15:01,598
Ray called us to tell us
you were on some special mission.

302
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:04,048
But he was a little flimsy with
the deets, so what's the happs, Caps?

303
00:15:04,072 --> 00:15:06,365
Yeah, we've been busy
saving the multi-verse.

304
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:08,826
You got shanghaied into
another crossover, didn't you?

305
00:15:09,327 --> 00:15:11,162
Uh...

306
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:12,245
Yeah, kind of.

307
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:13,515
Whoa, whoa. Did they kidnap you?

308
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:15,083
This is a classic crossover move.

309
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,418
We tell 'em we're too busy,
they commit a felony.

310
00:15:17,502 --> 00:15:20,588
Guys, Beebo is rampaging
through Star City.

311
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,799
- Does Behrad have his totem?
- [Agent Sharpe] <i>Beebo?</i>

312
00:15:22,882 --> 00:15:23,942
That doesn't make any sense.

313
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,444
You would need
all six totems to make that happen,

314
00:15:25,468 --> 00:15:27,136
<i>and Behrad's
definitely still on the ship.</i>

315
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,137
All right, I gotta go.

316
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:29,347
Wait, do you need help?

317
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,515
No, stay in DC.

318
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:32,993
I don't want any more of my people
getting roped into this mess.

319
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:34,185
Well, here's the thing, um...

320
00:15:34,477 --> 00:15:37,021
One of us is kinda of already there.

321
00:15:38,231 --> 00:15:39,231
Who?

322
00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:42,276
And who should I make this out to?

323
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,404
Doris. I'm such a huge fan, Rebecca...

324
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,448
I mean, what should I call you?

325
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:49,158
"Rebecca" is fine.

326
00:15:49,784 --> 00:15:51,661
"To Doris.

327
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:54,956
"Thanks for the passion, love..."

328
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:56,958
- [Beebo roars]
- [all gasp]

329
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,709
- What is that?
- Why are they running?

330
00:15:59,377 --> 00:16:03,172
[heavy footsteps]

331
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:08,427
[Beebo chuckles]

332
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,012
Furball.

333
00:16:11,055 --> 00:16:12,055
Oh, my!

334
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,977
- [Beebo chuckles, wails]
- [car horns blare]

335
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:19,730
Oh, man, I can't believe
Nate's gonna miss seeing Beebo.

336
00:16:19,814 --> 00:16:20,940
He's gonna be so jealous.

337
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,650
[Supergirl] Here he comes.

338
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:23,860
What's the plan?

339
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:26,296
- [chuckles] Smile, Beebo.
- [Beebo laughs]

340
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,322
- [phone camera clicks]
- What are you...

341
00:16:28,406 --> 00:16:29,925
I'm sorry, you guys
don't want to be in it?

342
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:30,950
Oh, bad timing.

343
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:33,077
Is this seriously happening right now?

344
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:34,412
Maybe it's a good thing.

345
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:35,973
Guess we could all use a distraction.

346
00:16:35,997 --> 00:16:38,541
Right, compartmentalize,
focus on the work. Good idea.

347
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:40,293
Guys, uh, Beebo's still on the warpath.

348
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:42,170
Any suggestions on how we take him down?

349
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:44,505
What is that?

350
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:46,465
[John] It's a utility truck. Why?

351
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:49,343
You guys ready to do a tag-team trip up?

352
00:16:49,427 --> 00:16:50,720
Yeah, what do you have in mind?

353
00:16:50,803 --> 00:16:53,139
All right, Supergirl, Atom,
keep him contained.

354
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:54,891
Flash, use those cables to your left.

355
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:56,134
- All right. Can do.
- Got it.

356
00:16:58,728 --> 00:17:02,023
Beebo want cuddles.

357
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:04,609
Is this actually happening?

358
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:06,360
Is this what
all the crossovers are like?

359
00:17:06,444 --> 00:17:07,570
Yes, and not exactly.

360
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:09,655
I'm never letting my child
watch that show again.

361
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,157
Done.

362
00:17:11,158 --> 00:17:12,366
All right, now get him moving.

363
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:14,410
- [weapon hums]
- Die, furball!

364
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:15,411
Mick?

365
00:17:15,412 --> 00:17:17,830
That blue bastard
ruined my book signing.

366
00:17:19,624 --> 00:17:21,626
[Sara] <i>Okay,
everybody get ready to pull.</i>

367
00:17:21,751 --> 00:17:23,729
- [Supergirl gasps]
- [The Flash] Take it, take it.

368
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:25,230
- [Beebo exclaims]
- [The Flash] All right.

369
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:28,466
- The bigger they are...
- The harder they fall.

370
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:31,677
- [Beebo exclaims]
- Whoa!

371
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:32,761
[gasps]

372
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:33,930
Thanks, Supergirl.

373
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:36,557
What the hell?

374
00:17:37,016 --> 00:17:39,560
[Beebo giggles]

375
00:17:39,644 --> 00:17:41,062
[Ne-Ray] Guys, something's off.

376
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:43,940
I'm not reading any known elements.
Nothing off the periodic table.

377
00:17:47,944 --> 00:17:50,488
I don't think the rules apply
to a 50-foot talking plush toy.

378
00:17:51,197 --> 00:17:52,823
Hey! Hey, Kate's here too...

379
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:54,992
Uh, sorry, what were you saying?

380
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:58,329
- [Beebo giggles]
- It's unnatural.

381
00:17:58,955 --> 00:17:59,955
Alien?

382
00:17:59,956 --> 00:18:01,123
- Hey!
- [The Flash] Or magic?

383
00:18:01,207 --> 00:18:04,019
Sara, don't you and the Legends deal
with that kind of stuff all the time?

384
00:18:04,043 --> 00:18:06,045
Or maybe it's just here
to keep us talking.

385
00:18:06,504 --> 00:18:07,546
A diversion.

386
00:18:08,214 --> 00:18:09,214
But for what?

387
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:11,050
I know what I'd do.

388
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,135
[alarm wailing]

389
00:18:13,219 --> 00:18:17,765
It is finally time
for Sargon the Sorcerer

390
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:20,268
to claim his reward...

391
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,771
Oh, and buy
that beautiful time-share in Bogota.

392
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:29,193
Come on, man. Beebo?

393
00:18:29,277 --> 00:18:30,444
Is nothing sacred?

394
00:18:30,528 --> 00:18:31,922
[Sara] You know, it's a smart move.

395
00:18:31,946 --> 00:18:34,323
Distracting all the fuzz
with giant fuzz,

396
00:18:34,407 --> 00:18:35,807
but someone should have told you...

397
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:39,370
Beebo? He's off-limits.

398
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,002
[Beebo] Beebo.

399
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:50,131
- [Supergirl] Oh!
- [laughs] Got him again.

400
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:51,424
Pugh.

401
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:55,803
So, how normal was that for everyone?

402
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:57,054
And don't say "very."

403
00:18:57,138 --> 00:18:59,307
Well, with this new Earth,
it just may be.

404
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,850
[scoffs] Dear God, I hope not.

405
00:19:04,395 --> 00:19:05,395
What is that?

406
00:19:06,105 --> 00:19:07,105
Alcohol.

407
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,654
Rory, huh?

408
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:15,823
We had a Rory once on our team.

409
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:18,367
- We did.
- [door opens]

410
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:21,078
What's this?

411
00:19:21,162 --> 00:19:24,332
Was there a memo that went out
on how to infiltrate our secret bunker?

412
00:19:24,415 --> 00:19:25,415
Why are you here?

413
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,751
I'm here to warn you.

414
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:27,918
You see this?

415
00:19:28,002 --> 00:19:30,004
This gauntlet is primed
to detect anti-matter,

416
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,715
of which there has been
a massive surge...

417
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:34,425
here in the Star City area.

418
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,260
Okay, well,
you're about two hours too late.

419
00:19:36,469 --> 00:19:38,637
- Already took care of it.
- Did you? Really?

420
00:19:39,305 --> 00:19:40,345
My readings say different.

421
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:41,724
This thing ain't over.

422
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:43,059
As a matter of fact...

423
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:45,018
It's just beginning.

424
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,942
[beeps]

425
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,402
Something's not right.

426
00:19:53,486 --> 00:19:54,606
Is that thing still working?

427
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,864
Yeah, it's working.
I built it myself. It's infallible.

428
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:59,158
Yeah, but you're still
detecting traces of anti-matter.

429
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,535
- Then our fight isn't done, is it?
- [sighs]

430
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:03,496
No. Or worse...

431
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,915
it's starting up all over again.

432
00:20:13,923 --> 00:20:14,923
Hey.

433
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:17,343
How'd you find me?

434
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:20,930
You feel that gust of wind
a few seconds ago?

435
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,266
That was me. I did a quick search
of the whole city for you.

436
00:20:25,935 --> 00:20:28,396
When you didn't come back
for the post-Beebo celebration,

437
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:29,480
I got a little worried.

438
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,941
Yeah.

439
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:35,986
You see that tree over there?

440
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:37,737
My sister and I

441
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,865
used to race to the top
when we were little.

442
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:41,700
I'd win every time.

443
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:46,872
I used to think it was
'cause I was a better climber, but...

444
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:49,834
Now I think Laurel let me win.

445
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,878
She knew I was a sore loser.

446
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:54,171
[Barry chuckles]

447
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:57,425
A lot has changed since then.

448
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,845
I was an assassin.

449
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:02,596
[scoffs] I was dead.

450
00:21:03,389 --> 00:21:06,058
Now I'm the captain
of a freaking Timeship.

451
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:08,936
One thing remains the same...

452
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:11,355
I'm still a sore loser.

453
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:15,609
I know it's...

454
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:17,695
It's hard,

455
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,530
not having Oliver here with us.

456
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:23,534
But look at what his sacrifice
made possible.

457
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:27,663
Our world is... It's different.

458
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:31,167
But at least it's safe.

459
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:32,459
Yeah.

460
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,881
He was just the last tether...

461
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:38,841
To my old life, you know?

462
00:21:41,135 --> 00:21:45,514
And he was the only person left
who knew me when I was just...

463
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:48,225
[sighs] Me.

464
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:50,519
With him gone,

465
00:21:50,603 --> 00:21:53,439
my connection to this world,
this place...

466
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:56,150
To that tree...

467
00:21:58,527 --> 00:21:59,695
It's gone.

468
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:05,034
I know what it's like to lose family.

469
00:22:07,036 --> 00:22:09,163
My mom, my dad.

470
00:22:10,331 --> 00:22:12,208
Each death felt like...

471
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,960
There was no moving forward.

472
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,172
Like, life would never be the same.

473
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:19,255
Yeah.

474
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:23,135
And I was right.
It's not the same, but...

475
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:26,680
Somehow it's okay.

476
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,327
Family isn't just the people that
you grew up with,

477
00:22:30,351 --> 00:22:31,769
it's the people you find, the...

478
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:35,272
The ones you love,
the ones who make you crazy...

479
00:22:36,774 --> 00:22:37,942
Make you smile.

480
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:43,322
- When did you get so wise?
- [both chuckle]

481
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:47,743
The Legends,

482
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:49,328
they are my family.

483
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,247
They have been for a while.

484
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:53,040
I guess I just...

485
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,044
I always thought
there would be at least someone

486
00:22:57,253 --> 00:23:00,756
who remembered what I was like
before I got on that boat.

487
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,677
[demon shrieks]

488
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:19,417
I thought we got rid
of all those things.

489
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:22,653
[J'onn J'onzz] <i>Barry, Sara,
the Shadow Demons are back.</i>

490
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:24,822
<i>I believe we are being hunted.</i>

491
00:23:25,698 --> 00:23:27,575
If they're hunting the Paragons,
that means...

492
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:29,701
Ryan.

493
00:23:30,995 --> 00:23:34,039
- [baby cries]
- [demon shrieks]

494
00:23:34,123 --> 00:23:36,750
- [banging at door]
- [demon snarling]

495
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:40,879
[baby cries]

496
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
[Choi] Sara?

497
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:47,636
What the hell's going on?

498
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,388
You have to come with me. Now.

499
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:55,060
All right, Barry, John, Supergirl
and Batlady are gathering the troops.

500
00:23:55,144 --> 00:23:57,396
Those attacks were probably
just the first wave.

501
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,815
Assassins sent to pick us off in pairs.

502
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:02,026
How are the Shadow Demons
even still here?

503
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:04,069
Didn't Oliver destroy the guy
who controls them?

504
00:24:04,153 --> 00:24:07,239
Well, not according to the surge in
anti-matter energy I'm reading.

505
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:09,533
The Anti-Monitor is alive?

506
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:13,245
But you said
Oliver sacrificed himself...

507
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:14,788
To create this new world.

508
00:24:14,872 --> 00:24:17,249
Apparently, his sacrifice
didn't kill the Anti-Monitor.

509
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,585
Well, then how do we do that?

510
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:23,631
Well, let's just throw him into the sun
and let the bastard burn.

511
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:25,299
Yeah, let's throw him in the sun,

512
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:28,886
and cause an anti-matter explosion
that obliterates the solar system.

513
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:30,113
You know what? Let's not do that.

514
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:32,181
At least he's trying
to offer up a solution

515
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:34,058
instead of being
the cause of the problem.

516
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:35,976
That's the solution,
blow up the solar system?

517
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,021
Okay. Guys, guys,
we're all on the same team, okay?

518
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,190
No, Scrappy's right.

519
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:44,276
It's my fault we're in this mess.
We gotta fix it.

520
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,653
Gotta fix it!

521
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:47,488
It's just a little tricky.

522
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:49,948
The Anti-Monitor is made of anti-matter,

523
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:53,077
and like its opposite,
it can neither be created nor destroyed.

524
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,078
It can only...

525
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:55,747
Change form
and move from place to place.

526
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:57,331
So what if we do just that?

527
00:24:57,873 --> 00:24:59,833
What if we could set off
a chain reaction

528
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:01,335
that will destabilize his form,

529
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:02,628
compressing his molecules

530
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:05,381
so he's essentially
shrinking for eternity?

531
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:07,466
Is that kind of reaction even possible?

532
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:08,467
Sure is.

533
00:25:08,468 --> 00:25:09,968
I did it a bunch of times by accident

534
00:25:10,052 --> 00:25:11,762
when I was developing
my A.T.O.M. Exosuit.

535
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:13,657
So you think you can keep him
shrinking indefinitely?

536
00:25:13,681 --> 00:25:16,558
Essentially we'd be sending him
to the "Atomverse."

537
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:18,042
I like to call it the "Microverse."

538
00:25:18,644 --> 00:25:19,644
That's better.

539
00:25:19,728 --> 00:25:21,563
Possible trademark issues,
but that's better.

540
00:25:21,647 --> 00:25:24,274
He could get stuck there
for, like, ever.

541
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:25,918
[Ray] In theory, it could totally work.

542
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:28,278
But developing a device in time...

543
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:31,115
Leave that to me, dear leaguers.
Gotta get to S.T.A.R. Labs.

544
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:32,199
Scrappy.

545
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:38,080
Look, if this goes down
anything like it did on Earth-38,

546
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:39,665
then things are gonna get messy.

547
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:42,543
Geek team, get on it.

548
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:44,670
Mick, go with them. Keep them safe.

549
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:45,962
The rest of us,

550
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:48,590
[sighs] we'll need to hold back
this incoming army.

551
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,511
[sighs]

552
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:56,056
This can work, Sara.

553
00:25:56,724 --> 00:25:57,808
I... I know it can.

554
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,644
That's what we thought
back at the Dawn of Time.

555
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:03,397
Here we are, back at square one.

556
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:06,066
This new Earth isn't square one.

557
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:09,570
It's what Oliver gave up his life
to create.

558
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:11,613
We have to protect it.

559
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:14,783
If we're gonna go down...

560
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:18,245
We go down fighting.

561
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:29,506
All right, listen up!

562
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:32,259
I got a ton of those Shadow things
descending on Gardener Pier.

563
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:33,462
[Alex] <i>Copy. We're en route.</i>

564
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:36,263
This is new.

565
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:38,390
New world, new look.

566
00:26:38,474 --> 00:26:40,074
[Batwoman] Cut the chatter,
they're here.

567
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:44,980
[demons screech]

568
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:08,837
What the hell?

569
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,630
Was that it?

570
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:15,719
It's not over yet.

571
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:25,270
Paragons.

The universal safeguard
meant to thwart me.

It is time to meet your end.

574
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:36,782
We'll need a reinforced core
to contain the reaction.

575
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:38,492
- Titanium?
- No, that's too heavy.

576
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:40,577
What we need...
What we need is...

577
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:44,289
Depleted promethium.

578
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:47,709
S.T.A.R. Labs, I've got Shadows
advancing on your position.

579
00:27:47,793 --> 00:27:48,709
[Killer Frost] On it.

580
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,170
It's been a while, Frosty.

581
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:51,964
- You look good.
- Thanks.

582
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:54,091
I read your book, "Rebecca."

583
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:56,552
Which one? I'm very prolific.

00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:01,430
Whoa.

00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:02,951
Do you wanna take this guy
or should I?

587
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:04,184
Ladies first.

00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:06,603
- Age before beauty.
- Mmm.

00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:13,735
Who the hell are you?

590
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:15,654
The guy who just saved your ass.

591
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:17,155
We had that covered.

592
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:18,239
Sure you did.

593
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:21,243
Company's coming. You ready?

594
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:22,953
I stay ready.

595
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:27,207
I am destiny incarnate.

596
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:31,795
Inexorable and inescapable.

597
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:33,630
You are nothing.

598

Insects...

599
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:38,510
Fated to be crushed beneath my heel

600
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:41,013
without a moment's thought.

601
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:42,514
Fighting is useless.

602
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:44,850
Surrender.

603
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:49,813
Not today.

604
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:51,106
Not ever.

Oliver died so that
we could continue to fight.

He sacrificed everything
for this new world,

607

and we will not fail him.

608

We will not fail this world.

609
00:29:05,203 --> 00:29:06,246

Well, we could really use

- All right, what are we making?
- Hey.

- All right, so, plans...
- Yup.

637

Right? Now, this is
what we have to build.

is get it into direct contact
