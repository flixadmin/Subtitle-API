1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,882
BARRY: <i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,920
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,526
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,405
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,602
<i>After defeating Zoom
and saving the multi-verse,</i>

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,447
<i>I ran back in time and created
the alternate timeline, Flashpoint.</i>

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,125
<i>I restored the timeline to how it was,</i>

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,089
<i>only to find things
weren't as I left them.</i>

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,203
<i>I brought new threats to our world.</i>

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,602
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,609
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,120
<i>Previously on The Flash...</i>

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,648
<i>Caitlin, I'm sorry, honey,
these powers you have,</i>

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,926
<i>the more you use them,</i>

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,441
<i>the more difficult
they're going to be to reverse.</i>

16
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,961
- I took your cuffs.
- Is this some sort of fashion choice,

17
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,610
'cause you're not a meta-human.

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,246
- Am I her?
- Yeah, I saw the both of us.

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,608
Like, full on, Vibe versus Killer Frost.

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,646
ALCHEMY:
<i>The time has come to set you free.</i>

21
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,291
Wally, don't.

22
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,569
SAVITAR: <i>You may serve the Speed Force,
Flash, but I rule it.</i>

23
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,846
You are only a man but I am a god.

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,241
Your god.

25
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,047
I am Savitar.

26
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,730
- Shoot him!
- I can't see it.

27
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,081
Just do it!

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,280
Alchemy!

29
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,651
Let's go for a run.

30
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,681
Barry!

31
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,165
- What's happening?
- CISCO: <i>I don't understand.</i>

32
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,890
<i>The suit's tracker must be malfunctioning.</i>

33
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,560
It says he's appearing and reappearing
all over the city at once.

34
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,842
That's impossible.
He can't be moving that fast.

35
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,371
Well, if he can't,

36
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,726
maybe something else can...

37
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,166
Had enough?

38
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,611
Not even close.

39
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,286
- Look. It stopped, he's at the waterfront.
- Okay.

40
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,767
- We have to get to him.
- CISCO: <i>And do what?</i>

41
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,088
He's fighting an invisible force
that's too fast to track.

42
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,687
- If I may? I have a plan...
- No. No.

43
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,531
- Pretty good plan.
- Put your hand down.

44
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,767
It's a question in numbers.

45
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,007
<i>'Cause right now</i>

46
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,480
it seems to be one against one.

47
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,409
What if it were three against one?

48
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,170
- <i>Do you know what I'm saying?</i>
- Cisco,

49
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,888
you can open a breach
and get you both to the waterfront.

50
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,043
Guys, I can't. It's too dangerous.

51
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,526
I'm begging you, please.

52
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,010
Still alive down there?

53
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,922
You are only a shadow beneath my throne.

54
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,409
You are the past.
Whereas I...

55
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,571
I am the future, Flash.

56
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,364
I can't see it.

57
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,085
Just do it!

58
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,767
Ah...

59
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,606
Oh, boy.

60
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,011
I'm gonna feel that tomorrow.

61
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,967
That was a new and painful
use of my powers.

62
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,643
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

63
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,521
Just cold.

64
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,601
Thanks for coming.

65
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,003
Barry, you're already healing.
You should be fine soon.

66
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,847
Um, Cisco, the MRI I did of your brain
shows changes in the capillary morphology

67
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,168
similar to that of a mini-stroke.

68
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,364
<i>I wouldn't try an intra-dimensional breach</i>

69
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,164
- like that anytime soon.
- Okay, okay.

70
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,761
Mini-stroke? You can't just gloss over
that like that, okay?

71
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,086
What does, what does that mean?

72
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,770
Am I gonna have this migraine
for the rest of my life?

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,571
It means you should take a few aspirin
and you'll be fine.

74
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,129
Oh, well, just lead with that next time.

75
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,041
BARRY: <i>Cait, uh...</i>

76
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,165
I know what a risk you took
using your powers. Thank you.

77
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,127
I didn't do anything.

78
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,044
Well, you saved my life so...

79
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,890
You've saved mine plenty of times.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,729
I'm gonna go check on Wally.

81
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,601
Okay.

82
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,130
What was that?
That frozen thing at the waterfront?

83
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,361
I don't know.

84
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,730
But now we know
Alchemy is just the lackey.

85
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,048
Whatever that thing was,
it's what we're really up against.

86
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,766
Question,
you're the only one who can see him?

87
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,166
Why? I mean...

88
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,370
- Why?
- You're both speedsters.

89
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,567
Maybe it has something to do with that.

90
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,410
Maybe. But I...

91
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,051
I think he's more than a speedster.

92
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,208
I mean, when he had me,
it wasn't like we were even moving.

93
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,442
It was just like, bam,
we were instantly somewhere different,

94
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,880
even from my perspective.

95
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,286
He say anything else?

96
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,130
He said his name was Savitar.

97
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,448
Mmm. Hindu god of motion.

98
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,524
What? How do you know that?

99
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,041
Crossword puzzle wizard.
On two planets, I might add.

100
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,890
Twelve across, seven letters. Savitar.

101
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,127
<i>Bam.</i>

102
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,601
Hindu god of motion.

103
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,891
He said he was God.

104
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,285
That's, that's nice.
That's not scary at all.

105
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,241
- Hey.
- BARRY: <i>Hey.</i>

106
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,562
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

107
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,446
How are you?

108
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,721
Can you tell anything?

109
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,483
Wally's alive in there,
but his vitals are really subdued.

110
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,125
<i>His brain function is low.</i>

111
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,482
<i>Something like you'd see
in a coma patient.</i>

112
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,121
I was in a coma after I got my powers.
Maybe it's a similar process?

113
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,481
Can we take him out?

114
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,445
When a caterpillar is in its chrysalis,

115
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,291
it literally breaks
its body down into enzyme soup

116
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,164
before rebuilding as a butterfly.

117
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,926
If this cocoon is doing
the same thing to Wally,

118
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,248
I don't know.

119
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,088
You're right. You don't know.

120
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,922
None of us knows a damn thing
about what's going on in there.

121
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,767
And I feel like a fool
just standing here listening.

122
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,927
Dad?

123
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,930
I've said it before, I don't have
the education most of you had.

124
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,323
<i>The science of what we do here
is mostly lost on me.</i>

125
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,683
But what I do have

126
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,169
is my detective skills and my instinct,

127
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,125
and time and time again, I don't use them

128
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,170
because you guys all tell me
that everything is gonna be okay.

129
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,488
Everything is not okay.

130
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,841
- I'm sorry, Joe.
- I know you are.

131
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,288
But I can't just stand here.

132
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,643
My gut is telling me
I need to do something.

133
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,725
This is not your fault.

134
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,887
Yeah, it is.

135
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,483
Not so tough without your friends
and your fancy robe.

136
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,485
I want to know about Alchemy.

137
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,241
What he does.

138
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,604
- How he does it.
- His powers are beyond

139
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,205
human understanding.

140
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,447
- Try me.
- Oh, you will be tried.

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,161
All of you.

142
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,084
When my master rises,
the human race will be judged.

143
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,565
From where I'm sitting,

144
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,284
you will not fare very well.

145
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,370
You think I'm playing with you?

146
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,130
My son is in one of those cocoons

147
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,771
and you're gonna tell me
how to get him out.

148
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,086
Now talk!

149
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,121
Go away!

150
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,044
Ah...

151
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,644
Caitlin, what is it?

152
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,967
It's Wally.

153
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,485
He's out of that thing. He's fine.

154
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,642
- And he's okay?
- Yeah. He's fine.

155
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,651
- I promise.
- Thank God.

156
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,282
- Thank you, Caitlin.
- You should probably go see him.

157
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,487
Yeah.

158
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,767
Where is Alchemy?

159
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,683
Tell me where Alchemy is.

160
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,164
I sense great fear in you.

161
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,531
You fear your power, your own greatness.

162
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,330
I don't fear anything anymore.

163
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,806
Where is Alchemy?

164
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,049
The only one I fear is that
whom Alchemy serves,

165
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,284
the dark lord Savitar.

166
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,161
Maybe it's time you started fearing me.

167
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,882
DETECTIVE 1: Who's in there?

168
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,562
Hello?

169
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,561
Excuse me?

170
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,081
DETECTIVE 1: <i>Anybody out there?</i>

171
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,210
<i>Let us out of here!</i>

172
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,205
I need you to come with me.

173
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,644
Wait. What is going on?

174
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,883
Mmm. Hey, Joe.

175
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,411
- What do you mean?
- Caitlin came by the precinct.

176
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,449
She said that Wally was out
and that he was okay.

177
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,483
What? I didn't even see her leave.

178
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,241
S.W.A.T. needs to establish a cordon
at Sixth and Fairmont,

179
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,930
all the way down to Gleason. Move.

180
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,241
<i>Move. Let's go.</i>

181
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,284
- Detective Patterson? Hey, what's...
- Just the man I want to see.

182
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,403
Your little friend's in big trouble,
Allen.

183
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,444
- My... What...
- Female meta-human,

184
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,921
attacked the precinct,
took Julian Albert hostage.

185
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,930
Julian? Wait, do you know who the meta is?

186
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,641
Uh, no.
But she's smart. I'll tell you that.

187
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,570
Took out our security cameras
so we couldn't ID her.

188
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,325
I thought maybe you'd recognize her.

189
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,291
No, I...
Why would she take Julian?

190
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,604
She's a meta. They're all crazy.

191
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,411
But don't worry.

192
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,086
We'll get her.

193
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,246
What are you doing?

194
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,331
What are you doing, Cait?

195
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,961
Bit chilly in here, isn't it?

196
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,804
Shut up. I need to think.

197
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,811
Look, I know who you are.

198
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,522
Okay?
You're Allen's friend, right?

199
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,048
- Dr. Snow?
- I said be quiet.

200
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,841
Are you going to kill me?

201
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,606
- I need to find Alchemy.
- "Alchemy"? What?

202
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,724
- Oh, what do you want me to do?
- Alchemy has disciples, followers.

203
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,531
I need you to create an algorithm
that will allow you to locate anyone

204
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,200
who has searched for a specific keyword
in the last six months.

205
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,684
If we find one of his followers,
they can take me to Alchemy.

206
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,963
Okay. But "Alchemy"
is a relatively common phrase.

207
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,241
It'll have hundreds of hits.

208
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,720
Then search for an uncommon one.

209
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,724
- Such as?
- Savitar.

210
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,081
“Savitar”?

211
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,250
Get searching.

212
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,242
So, they don't know why she took Julian?

213
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,050
No, they don't. But more importantly,

214
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,571
they don't even know
that it's Caitlin yet,

215
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,524
so we need to find her before they do.

216
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,366
Savitar. Now, what about this Savitar...

217
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,204
Let's find Caitlin.
Then we can worry about Savitar.

218
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,203
You know what, guys?
I agree with Barry.

219
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,203
- Let's find Caitlin.
- IRIS: Okay, you're right.

220
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,566
When we find Caitlin, then what?

221
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,410
I don't know.
I mean, she's not thinking straight.

222
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,204
- She's...
- She's becoming Killer Frost.

223
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,243
- It's just like in the Vibe.
- No, we don't know that yet.

224
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,363
Her mother said the more that
she uses her powers,

225
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,561
the faster she's gonna go.

226
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,250
And saving you from Savitar,

227
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,085
that must have put her over the edge.

228
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,771
- Right, how do we find her?
- I don't know.

229
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,089
I tried pinging her cell and Julian's,
but she must have ditched them both.

230
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,724
- If I may proffer a notion...
- Oh, great.

231
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,763
More suggestions
from the genius over here.

232
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,729
You don't call the genius.
The genius calls you.

233
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,406
<i>Question,</i>

234
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,568
how did you catch your Captain Cold?

235
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,926
<i>I've been reading about him in your files.</i>

236
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,407
Seems like a wily fellow. Slow talker.

237
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,729
But his MO,
strikingly similar to our dear Caitlin's.

238
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,241
What? No.
We tracked him using the satellite

239
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,209
to scan for ultraviolet cold signatures.

240
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,210
Oh... Got it.

241
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,568
No. Nothing near the precinct.

242
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,086
Wait, what's that?

243
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,971
Frozen food warehouse.

244
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,127
There she is.

245
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,280
Okay, I'm gonna isolate the feed
so that no one else can see it.

246
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,083
Figure out what she's making Julian do.
I'm going.

247
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,281
Okay.

248
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,086
That is cool.

249
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,929
Found two individuals that have searched
for the name Savitar.

250
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,811
Here are both their addresses,
both of them in Central City.

251
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,801
What exactly are you gonna do to them?

252
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,967
I don't know.

253
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,127
What am I doing?

254
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,522
Son of a...

255
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,649
Sergeant, we got a location on Albert.
Let's move.

256
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,688
What part of "I'll freeze you to death"
did you not understand?

257
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,527
Stop.

258
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,689
- Get out of here.
- You know I can't.

259
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,368
What are you doing?
Take her out. Take her out.

260
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,687
You don't want to do this.

261
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,887
You don't want to hurt anybody.

262
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,531
She's willing to hurt someone.
Knock her out.

263
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,522
- Caitlin?
- Leave me alone.

264
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,529
- What are you doing?
- I have to find Alchemy.

265
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,045
We will find him. All right? Together.

266
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,004
No. You don't understand.
I don't want to lock him up.

267
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,004
- I need him to help me.
- Help you what?

268
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,242
I need him to get rid of my powers.

269
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,646
Oh, Caitlin.

270
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,530
- I don't know if it works that way.
- You don't know that it doesn't.

271
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,725
I know that we love you.

272
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,811
And we will do everything
that we can to help you.

273
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,728
You and I,
we've been through too much together

274
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,684
to let each other down now.

275
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,321
Please.

276
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,251
Let me help you.

277
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,091
Like you helped your mother?

278
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,409
- Caitlin.
- Or Wally?

279
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,921
Or me?

280
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,323
You keep messing with everyone's lives,
wrecking everything

281
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,609
and we're left behind
to pick up the pieces from your mistakes.

282
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,400
Some things you break
can't be put back together.

283
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,246
I can fix this.

284
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,289
Oh, like you fixed Cisco's family?

285
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,686
You didn't tell Cisco that
you screwed him worst of all, did you?

286
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,130
You hear that, Cisco?

287
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,289
<i>Dante was alive,</i>

288
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,241
<i>healthy and happy,
until Barry created Flashpoint.</i>

289
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,524
<i>When he reset things
that's what killed him.</i>

290
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,566
<i>Barry is the reason your brother is dead.</i>

291
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,804
Albert's down. Shoot her!

292
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,445
That severed your triceps surae.

293
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,126
Even with your healing abilities,
it'll take four hours to regenerate.

294
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,765
Don't follow me.

295
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,446
Caitlin, come on...

296
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,285
How much does it hurt?

297
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,885
As much as I deserve.

298
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,051
Okay. Let me know.

299
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,323
They took Julian to County General.

300
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,846
He's still out cold.

301
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,726
How hard did you hit him?

302
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,725
I don't know.
I didn't mean to knock him out.

303
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,646
Or maybe I did.

304
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,527
I don't know.

305
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,801
Ah...

306
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,206
Cisco.

307
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,481
<i>Hey, man, um,</i>

308
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,166
what Caitlin said...

309
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,806
Was she lying?

310
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,850
No. I'm...

311
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,241
You're sorry?

312
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,165
That you killed my brother?

313
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,001
'Cause he was here.

314
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,486
He was alive,

315
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,488
until you created Flashpoint,
until you did this.

316
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,846
I know, man.

317
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,769
I don't even know how to feel right now.

318
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,685
All I know is
Caitlin is out there,

319
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,010
and we need to find her.

320
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,570
Can we do that?

321
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,241
Yeah.

322
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,411
I hacked Julian's computer.

323
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,241
Caitlin had him look up two addresses.

324
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,571
16 Hawthorne Avenue
and 1104 Truman Place.

325
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,888
She's trying to find the acolytes,
I was trying to say.

326
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,361
What exactly would she want
with Alchemy's followers?

327
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,369
She must think that
he can take her to Alchemy.

328
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,045
She wants him to take her powers away.

329
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,605
We know. We heard everything.

330
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,523
Well, two acolytes, two addresses.
Which one's she gonna hit first?

331
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,089
- We got to watch both.
- You're gonna stay here.

332
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,204
- You can barely walk. I'll take Hawthorne.
- I'll take Truman.

333
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,204
I care about Caitlin
but I don't want to leave Wally.

334
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,484
Dad, um, Barry and I will stay with Wally.
You go with H.R.

335
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,643
Oh, yeah, I would love that.

336
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,247
Hey, you and me, all-star team up?

337
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,050
Right, you know what?
I'll make a couple cappuccinos

338
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,442
for the road, right, so we're ready
for tonight's adventures. Hey.

339
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,085
Not to worry, Barry. Right?

340
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,641
We'll help her.

341
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,926
BARRY: Cisco.

342
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,403
- If you find her...
- I won't call you.

343
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,281
You've done enough.

344
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,482
- The acolyte's on the second floor.
- Cup of joe, Joe?

345
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,285
- No.
- No? All right.

346
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,686
You're a tea drinker, I bet.

347
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,161
If you're gonna talk nonsense,
you gotta stop talking to me.

348
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,606
You're worried about your son.

349
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,807
Do you have kids?

350
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,761
No.

351
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,366
Then I don't think we could possibly
have a conversation about

352
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,446
how I'm feeling right now.

353
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,286
Okay,

354
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,762
but as an interested observer,
I can tell you,

355
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,684
Barry admires you.

356
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,126
Yeah.

357
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,651
Well, he needs to listen to me.

358
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,885
Yeah, well, the reason he doesn't

359
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,488
is Barry's real superpower

360
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,361
isn't speed.

361
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,681
It's hope.

362
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,680
- Mmm.
- Kid's got an endless reservoir.

363
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,121
- Believes everything's gonna work out.
- Well...

364
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,001
He's wrong about this one.
They all are.

365
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,962
I said it before, when my gut tells me
something is off, I trust it.

366
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,720
And I need them to trust me.

367
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,960
Next time your gut tells our team
what to do, I'll trust it.

368
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,722
How do I know you're not just telling me
what I want to hear?

369
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,051
Well, what does your gut tell you?

370
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,563
- What is that?
- The satellite.

371
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,562
It's programmed to detect
rapid temperature decelerations.

372
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,485
That's the house Cisco's watching.

373
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,846
IRIS: Oh, God.

374
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,367
Honey?

375
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,921
Craig?

376
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,401
It's freezing in here.
Go check the thermostat.

377
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,364
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

378
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,683
Both of my parents are doctors.

379
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,129
<i>It's all I ever wanted to be.</i>

380
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,765
Growing up, I used to practice
the Hippocratic Oath.

381
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,246
<i>I was obsessed with it.</i>

382
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,202
If anyone was even gonna step on a bug,

383
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,046
I would say, "Do no harm."

384
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,770
<i>It's built into my DNA.</i>

385
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,803
Unfortunately,
my DNA isn't what it used to be.

386
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,088
So, believe me when I say,

387
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,968
answer every one of my questions
or I will harm you and your family.

388
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,404
- Who is Alchemy?
- I don't know.

389
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,085
I've never seen him without the mask.

390
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,129
I know he can give people powers.

391
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,560
Can he take them away?

392
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,767
Yes.

393
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,969
But you can't make Alchemy do anything.

394
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,323
He's just an acolyte, like me.

395
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,924
We both serve the speed god,
Savitar.

396
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,291
He's shown us the future. I saw you there.

397
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,961
You were glorious

398
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,681
and powerful.

399
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,847
My lord has special plans for you,
Caitlin Snow.

400
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,851
Or should I say...

401
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,841
Killer Frost?

402
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,920
CISCO: <i>Caitlin!</i>

403
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,601
Really?

404
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,803
You brought your toys?

405
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,805
I'm hoping it won't come to that.

406
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,690
- It won't.
- Look, I'm not leaving you out here.

407
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,326
I want to help you.

408
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,280
- There's only one person who can help me.
<i>- Really?</i>

409
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,648
You really think seeking medical advice
from someone named Doctor Alchemy

410
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,966
is the way to go?

411
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,646
Why not?

412
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,247
My name is Killer Frost.

413
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,047
Your name is Caitlin Snow.

414
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,168
Can Caitlin Snow do this?

415
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,531
Caitlin, please!

416
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,687
How's the leg?

417
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,009
- I'm sorry, Caitlin.
- That was cold, Flash.

418
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,325
But this is colder.

419
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,926
Start vibrating. It'll warm you up.

420
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,601
Whoo!

421
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,128
Guess I just needed a little sleep.

422
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,447
Oh, thanks, guys.
I'm feeling much better now.

423
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,209
It's okay. You can let me out.
I promise I'm not gonna hurt anybody.

424
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,287
Hmm.

425
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,564
Guess you're all smarter than I thought.

426
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,890
You know, that was some blast there,
Vibe boy.

427
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,401
- It kind of hurt.
- I didn't want to hurt you.

428
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,211
You're pathetic.

429
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,611
Alchemy can't help you.

430
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,606
But we can. I promise.

431
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,285
Oh, like you promised Eddie?

432
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,889
And like you promised Ronnie?

433
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,289
You know, for a hero, Flash,

434
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,563
you sure let a lot of people
around you die.

435
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,243
This isn't you talking. It's the powers.
They're messing with your mind.

436
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,607
You're sick.

437
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,649
I'm broken, Barry.

438
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,645
But what do you care?

439
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,561
'Cause you've got Iris.

440
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,924
<i>You got your happy ending.</i>

441
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,443
<i>Everyone else be damned.</i>

442
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,921
So, I'll tell you what,
you guys,

443
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:53,123
let me go and I will leave you to your sad
and miserable lives.

444
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,646
No. We're not abandoning you.

445
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,643
You did this to me.

446
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,328
Do you have any idea,
how we can reverse this?

447
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,000
How we can get her back?

448
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,171
It's like Caitlin said,

449
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,690
sometimes when things get broken,
they can't be fixed.

450
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,006
My son's not gonna end up like Caitlin.
Help him out of this thing.

451
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,201
Oh, no, no. Joe, no.

452
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,686
We don't want to touch that thing.

453
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,530
First, we don't know what it's gonna
do to Wally, right?

454
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,690
Maybe this is the kind of situation
best left to the people with the science.

455
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,361
You mean Caitlin?

456
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,564
Please, help me.

457
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,045
What are you doing down here?

458
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,246
We should all be

459
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,401
working to find Alchemy and Savitar
and figure out how to stop them.

460
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,331
Instead, we're fighting each other.

461
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,003
Yeah.
Team Flash is not at its finest.

462
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,685
Why didn't I just follow you
inside the house?

463
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,760
Because you were hurting.

464
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,042
You would do anything
to make the pain go away.

465
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,931
That's why Caitlin is so lost. And Cisco.

466
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,729
We will do anything to make the pain stop.

467
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,366
That doesn't make you a bad person.
That makes you human.

468
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,251
Tell that to my friends.

469
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,727
My best friends, one of them is locked up
like a villain, the other one hates me.

470
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,444
You cannot take this all on yourself.

471
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,602
Why not?

472
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,928
How do you know that
Caitlin wasn't already affected

473
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,889
by the accelerator explosion

474
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,244
or that Dante wouldn't have died
in a car accident anyway?

475
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,563
You are not God, Barry.

476
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,604
- That's what Jay said.
- Jay's a smart man.

477
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,289
You cannot keep doing this to yourself,

478
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,523
constantly going over the what-ifs.
You'll go nuts.

479
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,723
Everyone in this building

480
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,891
needs the Flash right now, my dad, Wally,
even Cisco and Caitlin.

481
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,769
So be strong like I know you are.

482
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,769
I know you don't want
to be the leader right now,

483
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,211
but you have to be.

484
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,122
I told you I couldn't do this without you.

485
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,086
And you'll never have to.

486
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,123
- Wally.
- Come on.

487
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,489
There's an energy surge
coming from the cortex.

488
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,801
What? Wait.

489
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,329
- Joe.
- Hey. What are you doing?

490
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,606
- Hey, Barr.
- Hey, stop.

491
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,609
- You can't cut him out.
- I have to.

492
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,166
Joe, don't!

493
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,687
Wally.

494
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,601
Wally?

495
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,327
- BARRY: Joe.
- What did I do?

496
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,366
- Was this your idea?
- No.

497
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,806
<i>Joe... I was helping Joe.</i>

498
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,122
No sign of Wally.
I've got the satellite scanning

499
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,606
the entire city for rapid movement.

500
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,446
If he's a speedster, he could
be halfway across the country by now.

501
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,880
Barry, we have to find him.

502
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,043
I'm more worried about what happens
when we do find him.

503
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,169
He didn't seem like
he was all there, Iris.

504
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,687
I shouldn't have cut him
out of that thing.

505
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,282
Joe, I...
What we need right now is a biochemist.

506
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,806
You've got to go talk to her, Barr.

507
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,561
All right.

508
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,683
We need your help, Caitlin.

509
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,526
Wally, he's...

510
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,891
He's out of the cocoon,
but his biochemistry is all out of whack.

511
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,241
He went AWOL.

512
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,087
So?

513
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,241
So, when we find him,
he's gonna need your help.

514
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,763
He's gonna need your medical expertise,
your experience with metas.

515
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,607
What he needs is Caitlin Snow, MD.

516
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,929
So you came to try and talk
some sense into me.

517
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,767
No.

518
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,731
I came to let you go.

519
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,888
For a smart guy,
that was an awfully dumb move.

520
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,285
Like I said, you're free to go.

521
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,566
What's the catch?

522
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,690
- You have to kill me.
- What is he doing?

523
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,684
No, no, no. It's gonna be all right.

524
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,729
You want to fight, Flash?

525
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,729
No. I'm not gonna fight you.

526
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,921
But if you want to leave this room,
you're gonna have to kill me.

527
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,248
- Don't think I won't.
- Then do it.

528
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,406
What are you waiting for?

529
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,280
What's the big deal?

530
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,570
Come on.
Live up to your name, Killer Frost.

531
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,966
I want to see some killing.

532
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,930
You want to be the villain?
This is what they do.

533
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,322
They kill their friends,
because nothing matters to them anymore,

534
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,641
Fight?

535
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,241
Right?

536
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,721
Come on.

537
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,645
Kill me, Caitlin.

538
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,281
You can't do it.

539
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,680
You can't,

540
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,442
because underneath all that cold,
you're still you.

541
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,647
- Barry.
- It's okay.

542
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,841
I got you.

543
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,646
It's okay.

544
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,807
I think extracting Wally early
from that cocoon

545
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,042
left him in a fugue state.

546
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,846
His synapses aren't used to functioning
at super-speed,

547
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,089
so his mind and muscles are misfiring.

548
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,486
Will this stuff help?

549
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,609
I've synthesized a neural compound

550
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,083
that I think will get his mind
and body running at the same speed.

551
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,405
We just have to find him first.

552
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,761
Where'd he go, Joe?

553
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,046
What does your gut tell you?

554
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,560
The house that he grew up in.

555
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,650
He used to go there
when he missed his mother.

556
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,966
In Keystone.

557
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,921
Thank you.

558
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,161
Wally.

559
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,361
Wally. It's your dad, son.

560
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,885
You're gonna be all right.

561
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,531
We're gonna take care of you, okay?

562
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,800
Dad.

563
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,206
Whoa!

564
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,967
Damn. How fast is he going?

565
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,482
Faster than Barry could at the beginning.

566
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,206
I, uh...

567
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,684
I just wanted to...

568
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,366
It's okay.

569
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,922
You scared me for a second,
getting all Mother of Dragons

570
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,610
on me with that hair.

571
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,601
Thank you.

572
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,771
That is the greatest feeling
I've ever felt.

573
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,003
- <i>Barry, it's unreal.</i>
- Yeah, it is.

574
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,282
- How fast was I going?
- Too fast.

575
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,330
Dad, don't look so worried. I'm fine.

576
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,171
I feel fine.
In fact, I feel kind of awesome,

577
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:26,285
like everything is buzzing, electric,
like I could do anything.

578
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,881
That is what it feels like.

579
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,726
Got the Speed Force coursing through you,
giving you power.

580
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,325
You're a speedster now.

581
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,130
Cool.

582
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,041
- Um, so, what next?
- Uh, Caitlin

583
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,607
is gonna run every test
she can think of on you.

584
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,365
I mean, if you're up for it.

585
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,440
Being a doctor? That, I'm always up for.

586
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,406
Yeah. Um, but...

587
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,449
<i>When do I get to go out, Barry, with you?</i>

588
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,889
Okay, let's just take it
one normal-speed step

589
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,730
- at a time.
- Slow down, Wallace.

590
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,725
Barr, it's the hospital.
Julian's awake.

591
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,968
He knows it was me. He knows what I did.

592
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,167
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
It'll be fine. I promise.

593
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,080
Hey, man.

594
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,444
Um, I just wanted to see if you wanted to
talk about...

595
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,041
I don't.

596
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,041
All right.

597
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,721
Um...

598
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,841
Look, Cisco, um,

599
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,685
you're my best friend, man.

600
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,082
Are we gonna be okay? You and me?

601
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,004
You want me to be honest with you?

602
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,844
Yeah. Yeah.

603
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,961
I don't know.

604
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,241
Okay.

605
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,006
Hey, Patterson.

606
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,884
Barry Allen, don't you ever work?

607
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,602
I just wanted to
make sure that Julian was doing okay.

608
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,529
Well, I'm about to
take his statement, yeah.

609
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,404
Uh, would it be okay if I talked to him

610
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,688
before you went in?
I just... We're pretty close,

611
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,530
- him and I.
- Yeah.

612
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,767
Go ahead. Just make it quick.

613
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,526
Always. Thank you.

614
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,045
Hey.

615
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,925
A hospital visit.
I didn't think you missed me that much.

616
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,405
What did the doctors say?

617
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,609
Uh, concussion

618
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,887
and frostbite,
but I'll be dandy in a few days.

619
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,651
That's good news.
I'm glad you're gonna be all right.

620
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,611
Yes, well, as much as I appreciate
your outburst of emotion,

621
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,609
I think we both know
the real reason you're here.

622
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,366
Your friend...

623
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,801
Caitlin Snow.

624
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,845
She's a meta
and not one of the friendly ones.

625
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,446
- Did you know?
- She's sick, Julian.

626
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,608
She is a bloody menace.

627
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,601
Julian, I...

628
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,125
<i>Man, I know that you think
that getting powers is</i>

629
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,563
this binary game,
that you're either good or evil,

630
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,450
but life isn't like that, even for metas.

631
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,290
Look. Caitlin,

632
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,851
she's a good person.

633
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,689
I'm begging you,
don't turn her in, all right?

634
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,008
I will do anything you want,

635
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,645
but please don't do this to her.

636
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,490
I got hit pretty hard

637
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,844
and I don't have the foggiest
who even kidnapped me at all.

638
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,565
Thank you, man.

639
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,646
Thank you.

640
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,083
There is one thing
you can do for me, mate.

641
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,324
- Anything.
- Quit.

642
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,483
- What?
- Tender your resignation

643
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,963
from the Central City Police Department,
effective immediately.

644
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,287
I can overlook the unexplained absences,

645
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,047
the constant disregard
for the rules and regulations,

646
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,481
but your moral compass
is broken, my friend.

647
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,724
I point-blank refuse

648
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,962
to work with someone
whose sense of right or wrong

649
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,929
is as flippant as the weather,

650
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,241
someone who thinks friendship
is more important than justice.

651
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,840
You are unfit to be a CSI.

652
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,762
Barry Allen has no place
in law enforcement.

653
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,204
Now, do we have an agreement

654
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,202
or would you like the Detective
to meet that girl?

655
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,886
All right.

656
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,881
He's all yours.

657
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,601
Hey, Albert.

658
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,562
So, what can you tell me
about our, our meta friend?

659
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,611
I don't really remember anything.

660
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,121
To be honest with you,
it's all a bit of a blur, so...

661
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,361
IRIS: Hey.

662
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,161
Hey-

663
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,840
We just heard from Singh.

664
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,004
You quit? What, what is going on?

665
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,484
I, um,
didn't really have a choice.

666
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,164
What do you mean,
you didn't have a choice?

667
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,607
Julian.

668
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,046
You quit, he keeps his mouth shut
about Caitlin.

669
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,205
- That son of a bitch.
- I don't know.

670
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,085
I mean, he said I couldn't do something
like protect Caitlin

671
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,409
and still be a good CSI
and maybe he's right.

672
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,806
No, he's not.

673
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,329
Barry, you are an incredible CSI

674
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,409
and no one in this building cares more
about helping people

675
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,726
find justice than you.

676
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,650
And that was long before
you were the Flash.

677
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,450
This lab, it's your life.

678
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,801
You're my life.

679
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,521
Both of you.

680
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,361
And Wally and Caitlin

681
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,681
and Cisco.

682
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,687
If these past few months have
taught me anything, it's that

683
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,366
I would give up everything I have to keep
you all safe. No regrets.

684
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,611
Every time I think you've run out of ways
to be a hero,

685
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,006
you show me another one.

686
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,360
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

687
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,800
Yeah, let's get out of here.

688
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,366
SAVITAR: Julian.

689
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,481
<i>Julian.</i>

690
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,245
No. Stay away.

691
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,886
<i>No, Julian.</i>

692
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,571
<i>You can't get away.</i>

693
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,729
<i>There's nowhere I won't find you.</i>

694
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,081
Only together

695
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,925
can we bring about my return.

696
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,365
<i>Become my servant once more.</i>

697
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,847
<i>Become Alchemy.</i>
