1
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:40,929
I'll take this.

2
00:00:40,971 --> 00:00:41,972
Merci.

3
00:00:57,696 --> 00:00:59,823
Sorry about all the...

4
00:00:59,865 --> 00:01:01,450
Oh, don't be stupid.
You did us a favor.

5
00:01:06,788 --> 00:01:07,890
What are we gonna do with him?

6
00:01:07,914 --> 00:01:09,416
Ah, we'll take care of it.

7
00:01:13,628 --> 00:01:15,338
The-the, uh, tracking chip.

8
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,631
Already disabled.

9
00:01:16,673 --> 00:01:19,885
Sit down and relax,
Petit Hughie.

10
00:01:31,354 --> 00:01:33,857
Oi, where you think
you're going?

11
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:34,959
I'm going home. I need clothes.

12
00:01:34,983 --> 00:01:36,109
We'll get you clothes.

13
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:38,278
I want my clothes.

14
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,530
I'll be right back.

15
00:01:40,572 --> 00:01:44,076
You are, perhaps...
in a state of shock, mon ami.

16
00:01:44,117 --> 00:01:46,495
Hughie, you just arse-bombed
America's sweetheart.

17
00:01:46,536 --> 00:01:48,663
You can't just piss off.

18
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,376
I need to go home.

19
00:01:58,882 --> 00:02:01,093
All right.
Frenchie will go with you.

20
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:03,220
Wait, what? No.

21
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:06,973
Either he goes with you,
or I break your legs.

22
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:12,687
Good lad.

23
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,820
Translucent's skin,
it won't burn off.

24
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:22,614
Where you gonna stash it
Homelander can't find it?

25
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:25,283
Nowhere.

26
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:27,410
But we can slow the cunt down
a bit.

27
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,274
♪ No, love teachers! ♪

28
00:02:57,315 --> 00:02:59,901
♪ Lit to pop
and nobody is gonna stop... ♪

29
00:03:20,463 --> 00:03:21,882
Come on in.

30
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,222
Ms. Stillwell. Hello.

31
00:03:29,264 --> 00:03:30,515
Please sit.

32
00:03:38,607 --> 00:03:42,611
Starlight, that video.

33
00:03:42,652 --> 00:03:44,463
- Ms. Stillwell, please.
- No, no. Let me finish.

34
00:03:44,487 --> 00:03:47,490
The date-rape girl? The victim?

35
00:03:47,532 --> 00:03:49,242
She saw that video on YouTube

36
00:03:49,284 --> 00:03:51,912
and she came forward
to thank you.

37
00:03:51,953 --> 00:03:54,664
She could not have been
more effusive.

38
00:03:54,706 --> 00:03:59,669
That's... that's good, right?

39
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:02,881
It is fantastic.
You're polling through the roof.

40
00:04:02,923 --> 00:04:06,176
You have a huge boost with men...
For the ass-kicking, of course...

41
00:04:06,218 --> 00:04:08,803
But with women, too.
They love the empowerment.

42
00:04:08,845 --> 00:04:10,764
16 points with females 18 to 49,

43
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:13,683
even in the liberal
retreat jurisdictions

44
00:04:13,725 --> 00:04:16,228
like New York and San Francisco.

45
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,022
- I don't know what to say.
- You just have to enjoy this.

46
00:04:19,064 --> 00:04:23,151
This is so good for you.
And it's so great for us,

47
00:04:23,193 --> 00:04:25,153
because it is
a partnership, after all.

48
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:27,239
- This is Seth and Evan from marketing.
- Hi.

49
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,091
They have some brilliant ideas
on how to capitalize

50
00:04:29,115 --> 00:04:31,534
on all the buzz. Gentlemen.

51
00:04:31,576 --> 00:04:33,703
- Okay. So...
- Yeah.

52
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:37,749
Now, small-town Iowa girl,
unexpected child prodigy,

53
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,834
is chosen for The Seven.

54
00:04:39,876 --> 00:04:42,504
Destiny knocks
on the girl next door's door,

55
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:45,507
and she answers,
to fight for truth and justice

56
00:04:45,548 --> 00:04:48,468
- side by side with her heroes.
- The Big Apple is rough, tumble.

57
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:51,680
It's got worms. Muggers
and rapists and thieves, oh, my.

58
00:04:51,721 --> 00:04:54,015
Dorothy is not
in Kansas anymore.

59
00:04:54,057 --> 00:04:57,477
Or Iowa. Poor girl gets knocked
around something fierce.

60
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,605
- Kicked while she's down.
- So what does she do? Does she cry in her milk?

61
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:02,482
- Does she quit?
- No way!

62
00:05:02,524 --> 00:05:04,901
She adapts! She transforms!

63
00:05:04,943 --> 00:05:06,319
Embraces her feminine strengths.

64
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:07,546
Good-bye, Yellow Brick Road...

65
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,990
And hello, Starlight.

66
00:05:16,204 --> 00:05:17,872
I can't wear that.

67
00:05:17,914 --> 00:05:19,582
What?

68
00:05:19,624 --> 00:05:21,167
Why not? It's beautiful.

69
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:22,877
Seriously?

70
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:26,256
I-It's just...

71
00:05:26,298 --> 00:05:28,466
It's not me.

72
00:05:28,508 --> 00:05:31,094
I designed Homelander's suit.

73
00:05:31,136 --> 00:05:33,263
- This isn't my first rodeo.
- You're wrong.

74
00:05:33,305 --> 00:05:36,141
It's totally you. It's bold,
it's brave, it's feminist.

75
00:05:36,182 --> 00:05:38,560
- How is that feminist?
- Empowering.

76
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:41,062
It says you're confident
in your own skin,

77
00:05:41,104 --> 00:05:42,480
and you're not afraid
to show it.

78
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:45,191
Most importantly,
it tells the story.

79
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:49,654
Of your transformation, of...
of what you're going through.

80
00:05:49,696 --> 00:05:54,242
How exactly do you know what
I'm going through, exactly?

81
00:05:54,284 --> 00:05:56,494
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:56,536 --> 00:05:58,913
I-I appreciate the effort,

83
00:05:58,955 --> 00:06:02,959
I really do,
but I'm fine with my old outfit.

84
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:04,836
- We're not.
- Excuse me?

85
00:06:04,878 --> 00:06:08,048
Starlight, like I said before,
this is a partnership.

86
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:10,508
In a partnership, there is give
and there is take.

87
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,510
It's my body.

88
00:06:12,552 --> 00:06:15,513
I have the right to choose
how much of it I show.

89
00:06:15,555 --> 00:06:18,516
That is true. You do.

90
00:06:18,558 --> 00:06:21,603
You just won't be doing it
in The Seven,

91
00:06:21,644 --> 00:06:24,647
unless it is wrapped in that.

92
00:06:30,945 --> 00:06:32,864
Tomorrow,
A-Train versus Shockwave.

93
00:06:32,906 --> 00:06:34,657
The race of the century.

94
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:37,577
The question now, Al,
is can A-Train keep his title

95
00:06:37,619 --> 00:06:39,204
as the fastest man alive?

96
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:41,414
Or is tomorrow the day
he runs out of track

97
00:06:41,456 --> 00:06:43,666
at the hands of this
fresh-faced young challenger?

98
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,293
Just wait here, okay?

99
00:06:45,335 --> 00:06:46,711
Tomorrow, live on pay-per-view,

100
00:06:46,753 --> 00:06:48,380
the race of the century.

101
00:06:48,421 --> 00:06:50,173
Well, Shockwave...

102
00:08:14,299 --> 00:08:16,551
Hughie?

103
00:08:16,593 --> 00:08:18,178
Oh, hey, Dad.

104
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:20,472
Wh... look at the,

105
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:22,825
- you-you've, this is...
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry about this.

106
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:26,394
I just, I've been meaning
to clean up the Supe stuff

107
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:27,812
for a while now, so...

108
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:32,400
What, are you going somewhere?

109
00:08:32,442 --> 00:08:34,736
- Yeah. For a while.
- Where?

110
00:08:34,777 --> 00:08:37,906
Uh, I don't know.

111
00:08:37,947 --> 00:08:40,742
Well, now,
you're scaring me, Hugh.

112
00:08:40,783 --> 00:08:44,662
All right, now,
I-I spoke to Dr. Feldman...

113
00:08:44,704 --> 00:08:47,081
- My pediatrician?
- He's still your doctor.

114
00:08:47,123 --> 00:08:49,143
And he's given me the name of
someone you can-you can talk to.

115
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:51,753
Help you, you know,
get back to normal.

116
00:08:51,794 --> 00:08:54,589
There's no normal anymore.

117
00:08:54,631 --> 00:08:56,466
What do you mean,
there's... Look.

118
00:08:56,508 --> 00:08:59,469
We've always been very open
with each other, right?

119
00:08:59,511 --> 00:09:01,638
We-We've always told
each other everything.

120
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,056
- Talk to me.
- Stop it.

121
00:09:03,097 --> 00:09:05,183
- What do you mean, stop it?
- Stop it.

122
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:08,269
I have never told you
everything.

123
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:11,648
I have never told you how much
I hate sitting on that couch,

124
00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:13,900
staring at the TV
like we're already dead.

125
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:17,570
How much I fucking hate
Pizza Rolls.

126
00:09:17,612 --> 00:09:20,406
- No, you love Pizza Rolls.
- When I was seven!

127
00:09:22,116 --> 00:09:24,118
I am not seven.

128
00:09:35,964 --> 00:09:37,966
I'm sorry.

129
00:09:58,736 --> 00:10:00,697
My father was bipolar.

130
00:10:02,865 --> 00:10:05,118
One night, when I was ten,

131
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:07,870
he tried to smother me
with a Hello Kitty duvet.

132
00:10:29,892 --> 00:10:32,270
- Give him that work!
- Kick his ass!

133
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:39,819
Yo!

134
00:10:44,365 --> 00:10:46,326
What the hell
is wrong with y'all?

135
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:48,870
This is not
what we do here, gentlemen.

136
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:51,372
Now, didn't I tell you,
we take turns at the pong?

137
00:10:51,414 --> 00:10:55,835
Oslo, Deeaygo, tell me you
put your names up on my board?

138
00:10:55,877 --> 00:10:57,211
Apologies, Mr. Milk. No, sir.

139
00:10:57,253 --> 00:10:59,797
Nuh-uh, me, neither, Mr. Milk.

140
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,150
Which means
that you have cut in line

141
00:11:01,174 --> 00:11:03,134
in front of everybody else
in here.

142
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:05,011
What else does it mean?
Come on, spit it out.

143
00:11:05,053 --> 00:11:06,905
Means that we're disrespecting
all the other niggas...

144
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:08,139
Excuse me?

145
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:10,600
All our fellow brothers
in the unit.

146
00:11:10,642 --> 00:11:12,226
Now, you both know how to write

147
00:11:12,268 --> 00:11:14,479
in the English language
in a passable fashion.

148
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,498
I know that, 'cause I've seen
to it myself, have I not?

149
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:19,317
- Yes, sir.
- Then please, place your John Hancocks on my board.

150
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:21,819
Yes sir, Mr. Milk. Thank you.

151
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:24,280
At the bottom of the list.

152
00:11:31,454 --> 00:11:33,414
Oh, hell nah.

153
00:11:33,456 --> 00:11:35,625
What the fuck do you want?

154
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:37,794
What, I can't visit me old mate?

155
00:11:37,835 --> 00:11:40,004
Rekindle the unbreakable bonds
of brothers-in-arms?

156
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:42,423
- Nope.
- Come on, M.M.

157
00:11:42,465 --> 00:11:44,801
Bring it in.

158
00:11:44,842 --> 00:11:46,945
Look, if it's all the same,
let's just cut the small talk.

159
00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:49,639
All you're gonna do is lie
and say how you're doing fine,

160
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:52,058
and I'm gonna lie and pretend
like I'm happy to see you.

161
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,726
Why are you here?

162
00:11:56,187 --> 00:11:59,941
All right.

163
00:11:59,982 --> 00:12:02,652
- How'd you like to come back, have another go?
- Mm-mm.

164
00:12:02,694 --> 00:12:05,196
No, sir. Keep it to yourself.

165
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:08,783
I don't want to know nothing
about nothing.

166
00:12:08,825 --> 00:12:12,328
I'm a happy man now.
Life is good,

167
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,039
- Monique is back, we're good, just...
- Oh, yeah? How is Monique?

168
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:17,041
Spits on the ground
every time your name comes up.

169
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,544
I can't do that
to her again, man.

170
00:12:19,585 --> 00:12:22,714
Not to mention, I'm actually
making progress with these boys.

171
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:24,006
Yeah, so I can see.

172
00:12:27,343 --> 00:12:29,303
Don't make me come out there!

173
00:12:29,345 --> 00:12:31,806
Well, this is God's work.

174
00:12:31,848 --> 00:12:36,060
I can't argue with that.
But a man of your talents?

175
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:38,688
- Wasted here.
- Look, Butcher,

176
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,773
we were into some bad shit, man.

177
00:12:40,815 --> 00:12:44,610
Even before the Mallory stuff.
And that, that was...

178
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:48,740
If I'm gonna make a difference,

179
00:12:48,781 --> 00:12:51,451
I just feel more comfortable
doing it on a smaller scale.

180
00:12:51,492 --> 00:12:53,202
I'm a motherfucker with a heart.

181
00:12:53,244 --> 00:12:54,662
Whereas you?

182
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,623
You're just a motherfucker.

183
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,840
Funny you should mention
making a difference...

184
00:13:08,926 --> 00:13:11,512
'cause we just dusted a Supe.

185
00:13:11,554 --> 00:13:13,431
Bullshit.

186
00:13:13,473 --> 00:13:15,057
Translucent.

187
00:13:16,768 --> 00:13:18,186
What the f...

188
00:13:20,521 --> 00:13:22,607
Well, come on,
you lime-sucking smart-ass.

189
00:13:22,648 --> 00:13:24,400
How the hell did you do it?

190
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:28,029
Well...

191
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:32,033
Big lump of C-4,
packed right up his fudger.

192
00:13:32,074 --> 00:13:35,953
Boom. Claret everywhere,
fucking diabolical.

193
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:39,791
But before the fireworks,
he coughed up a solid lead.

194
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:41,626
Spilled the beans in a big way.

195
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:43,211
Now, we play this right,

196
00:13:43,252 --> 00:13:45,630
we could shake up
the whole hornets' nest,

197
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:48,633
bring down Seven
and Vought at the same time.

198
00:13:48,674 --> 00:13:49,759
Mm-hmm.

199
00:13:49,801 --> 00:13:52,303
You mean do Homelander?

200
00:13:55,473 --> 00:13:57,558
This is about Becca, isn't it?

201
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,144
It's always about Becca
with you.

202
00:14:00,186 --> 00:14:02,688
Oh, you ain't got your reasons?

203
00:14:07,109 --> 00:14:09,278
It'll be different this go,
all right?

204
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,572
None of that
"secrets and lies" bollocks.

205
00:14:11,614 --> 00:14:13,991
And that Mallory shit
ain't gonna happen this time.

206
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:16,077
I swear to God.

207
00:14:20,665 --> 00:14:22,583
Are you bringing Frenchie back?

208
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,044
'Cause I can't work
with that motherfucker.

209
00:14:25,086 --> 00:14:27,547
Frenchie?
No, I ain't seen him in years.

210
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:32,260
M.M., you're the only bloke
I can trust.

211
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:36,597
Since when
have you ever trusted anybody?

212
00:14:37,849 --> 00:14:39,809
Oh, fuck.

213
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:41,894
Senator Calhoun,
you've gone on the record

214
00:14:41,936 --> 00:14:43,580
against superheroes in the military.
Who's a good boy?

215
00:14:43,604 --> 00:14:45,082
- Who's a good boy?
- Why change your tune?

216
00:14:45,106 --> 00:14:46,732
No one's changing their tune.

217
00:14:46,774 --> 00:14:48,609
Uh, it's just I realized that

218
00:14:48,651 --> 00:14:51,404
it's an issue
that affects all Americans.

219
00:14:51,445 --> 00:14:54,341
- Can't you make it... stop?
- It shouldn't be decided by a few congressmen

220
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:55,717
- hidden in committee.
- He's not crying.

221
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:57,076
The bill needs to go
to the floor.

222
00:14:57,118 --> 00:14:58,119
Oh, okay.

223
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,453
Aw. Aw.

224
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:01,122
Oh, no. We can't have that...

225
00:15:01,163 --> 00:15:04,417
You know, I heard Translucent's
tracking chip went dead.

226
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,211
- Yeah?
- He could be hurt.

227
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:08,212
How?

228
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:09,547
He's got diamond skin.

229
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:10,882
He's gonna be fine.

230
00:15:10,923 --> 00:15:12,174
My guys are on it.

231
00:15:12,216 --> 00:15:14,176
All right,
I forgot to give you these.

232
00:15:14,218 --> 00:15:15,386
Here.

233
00:15:15,428 --> 00:15:16,637
What is it?

234
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:18,472
Those are
your new talking points.

235
00:15:18,514 --> 00:15:21,392
Now that the military bill
is out of committee,

236
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:24,020
corporate wants
to sell the shit out of it.

237
00:15:24,061 --> 00:15:25,980
Yes. They do.

238
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:31,986
Hey. Y-You remember when
you wanted me in the red cape

239
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:33,905
and-and I said, "No. No, no, no."

240
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:36,240
Make it the flag"?
Remember that?

241
00:15:36,282 --> 00:15:38,242
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah. I don't need these.

242
00:15:38,284 --> 00:15:40,244
Okay?

243
00:15:40,286 --> 00:15:42,413
I can sell my way
into the military.

244
00:15:42,455 --> 00:15:44,498
Thank you.

245
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,126
You take care of your baby,
and I'll take care of mine.

246
00:15:47,168 --> 00:15:50,296
Mr. Edgar wrote
those personally.

247
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:54,050
So if you want to go to 82
and take it up with him,

248
00:15:54,091 --> 00:15:56,093
be my guest.

249
00:15:58,346 --> 00:15:59,555
Oh, yes.

250
00:15:59,597 --> 00:16:01,223
Oh, you're a happy boy now, huh?

251
00:16:01,265 --> 00:16:03,184
Are you a happy boy?

252
00:16:11,192 --> 00:16:13,569
A rental, you cheap bastard?

253
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:15,571
Who do you think I am,
some double-O wanker?

254
00:16:15,613 --> 00:16:18,741
In case you hadn't noticed,
we ain't exactly rolling in it.

255
00:16:18,783 --> 00:16:21,077
And you don't think
this is conspicuous?

256
00:16:21,118 --> 00:16:22,620
Conspicuous? No, I don't think

257
00:16:22,662 --> 00:16:24,789
it's conspicuous.
I think a big black van

258
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,541
with fucking "Flowers"
on the side is conspicuous.

259
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:30,795
This is just another truck
on the street.

260
00:16:34,048 --> 00:16:36,050
Bang on time.

261
00:16:41,806 --> 00:16:43,766
Uh, hi.

262
00:16:43,808 --> 00:16:46,268
Hughie.

263
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,937
Smelly motherfucker.

264
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:54,753
- Butcher, who is this guy?!
- You'll give the game away!

265
00:16:54,777 --> 00:16:56,404
Not until this frog gets
what's coming.

266
00:16:56,445 --> 00:16:57,905
Only thing that is coming

267
00:16:57,947 --> 00:17:00,507
- is me on your mother's titties!
- Let me through at him, bitch!

268
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:02,010
- Hey!
- We had an agreement about him.

269
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:03,428
We agreed to put a pin in it,
all right?

270
00:17:03,452 --> 00:17:04,996
- What agreement?
- There was no pin.

271
00:17:05,037 --> 00:17:06,264
I don't trust this French whore.

272
00:17:06,288 --> 00:17:07,248
I am more American than you,

273
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:09,041
you racist piece of shit!

274
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,894
- Why are they fighting?!
- Nothing. It is water under the bridge.

275
00:17:10,918 --> 00:17:12,420
You tell that
to Mallory's grandkids.

276
00:17:12,461 --> 00:17:14,922
Tell them it's water
under the bridge.

277
00:17:14,964 --> 00:17:17,633
- That wasn't my fault, huh?
- Who is Mallory?

278
00:17:17,675 --> 00:17:20,052
All right, the both of you,
knock it on the head, now!

Hey, Monique.

287
00:17:39,113 --> 00:17:41,407
How you doing, baby?

288
00:17:41,449 --> 00:17:44,160
Ooh, I forgot to marinade
the tilapia.

289
00:17:44,201 --> 00:17:46,662
I am so sorry, sweetheart.

290
00:17:46,704 --> 00:17:48,789
Okay, how 'bout this?

291
00:17:48,831 --> 00:17:51,417
How about,
on my way home from work,

292
00:17:51,459 --> 00:17:53,919
I stop by DeLuca's,
pick up two fat tenderloins,

293
00:17:53,961 --> 00:17:56,314
some portobello mushrooms, that
pinot that you love so much.

294
00:17:56,338 --> 00:17:58,049
Yeah, baby.

295
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,051
Okay, I-I got to go.

296
00:18:00,092 --> 00:18:01,469
All right, sweetheart.

297
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,387
Yeah. Me, too.

298
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:05,556
Baby, I just...

299
00:18:05,598 --> 00:18:07,308
Uh, you're right, you're right.

300
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:08,809
I love you, too.

301
00:18:08,851 --> 00:18:10,853
Okay. Bye.

302
00:18:21,739 --> 00:18:24,033
Fuck all of y'all, okay?

303
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:27,536
All right. All right.

304
00:18:27,578 --> 00:18:30,998
Listen, you two knobbers
kiss and make up, yeah?

305
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,833
We got a fucking job to do.

306
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:36,253
Fuck it. Dégage, huh?

307
00:18:36,295 --> 00:18:38,339
Get out of here.

308
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,049
Who's this guy?

309
00:18:40,091 --> 00:18:41,467
The new lad. Hughie.

310
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:43,385
Hughie, Mother's Milk.

311
00:18:43,427 --> 00:18:45,721
That's a... nickname?

312
00:18:45,763 --> 00:18:48,224
No, my mother actually named me
Mother's Milk.

313
00:18:48,265 --> 00:18:50,518
- Did-did she?
- So we got

314
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,287
a French whore
and a Stephen fucking Hawking.

315
00:18:52,311 --> 00:18:53,938
- Great job, Butcher.
- Well, it was

316
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:56,565
Stephen fucking Hawking
who dusted the Supe.

317
00:18:58,025 --> 00:18:59,026
Oh.

318
00:19:00,069 --> 00:19:01,028
She's home.

319
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,196
That's Popclaw, right?

320
00:19:02,238 --> 00:19:03,405
A-Train's girlfriend?

321
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:08,577
Oh, Popclaw. Hi.

322
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:09,954
Uh, you know the-the rent?

323
00:19:09,995 --> 00:19:13,332
- It was due last week.
- Right. Of course.

324
00:19:13,374 --> 00:19:14,726
You think her
and A-Train are, uh...

325
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,502
Yeah, playing bury the bishop.

326
00:19:16,544 --> 00:19:18,396
Didn't hear nothing about it.
I'm usually up on these things.

327
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,713
According to Translucent,

328
00:19:19,755 --> 00:19:21,966
A-Train knows this bird
inside out.

329
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:23,175
I'll drop the check off ASAP.

330
00:19:23,217 --> 00:19:24,844
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

331
00:19:24,885 --> 00:19:26,303
- Yeah.
- 'Kay.

332
00:19:31,433 --> 00:19:33,227
All right.
Let's get the bugs sorted,

333
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:34,812
see for ourselves.

334
00:19:39,275 --> 00:19:41,485
Where-Where'd you get this shit,
Circuit City?

335
00:19:41,527 --> 00:19:44,405
Right? He's a cheap bastard.

336
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:50,661
You know, we don't actually need
to sneak in anything.

337
00:19:50,703 --> 00:19:53,831
- Eh?
- Look, all I need's her IPv6 number.

338
00:19:53,873 --> 00:19:57,126
Every desktop, every smart TV
in the house has a camera on it.

339
00:19:57,168 --> 00:19:58,436
They probably have one
in every room.

340
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,629
- Even in the toilet?
- No, Frenchie,

341
00:20:00,671 --> 00:20:02,274
not in the toilet. Look,
I just need five minutes inside.

342
00:20:02,298 --> 00:20:04,466
I mean, home service
is my specialty.

343
00:20:11,432 --> 00:20:13,392
Hello, ma'am,
we're with Bryman Audio-Visual.

344
00:20:13,434 --> 00:20:16,228
We got the new router. I'm...

345
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,647
This is-is Hughie.

346
00:20:18,689 --> 00:20:20,524
I'm Gary.

347
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:22,460
- I didn't make an appointment.
- Oh, well, your manager did.

348
00:20:22,484 --> 00:20:24,570
- He's upgrading the whole building.
- I just saw

349
00:20:24,612 --> 00:20:26,322
my landlord.
He didn't mention it.

350
00:20:26,363 --> 00:20:29,074
I've got a work order
right here, ma'am.

351
00:20:29,116 --> 00:20:31,911
Only takes a second.

352
00:20:31,952 --> 00:20:34,622
And we can get you all the way
up to a thousand Mbps.

353
00:20:34,663 --> 00:20:36,248
That-That's a lot.

354
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,083
Okay. Come on in.

355
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,799
The computer's right over here

356
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:48,219
- if you need it.
- Uh, yeah.

357
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,654
I just need
to sign on to your server

358
00:20:49,678 --> 00:20:51,388
in order to download
the service package.

359
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,599
- Yeah, sure.
- I have a confession.

360
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:55,476
We're really big fans. I mean,

361
00:20:55,517 --> 00:20:56,727
Terminal Beauty 3...

362
00:20:56,769 --> 00:20:58,896
Whew. Damn.

363
00:20:58,938 --> 00:21:01,315
Oh. Thanks.

364
00:21:01,357 --> 00:21:04,652
Yeah, that one
really came together.

365
00:21:04,693 --> 00:21:06,862
Let me know
if you guys need anything else.

366
00:21:06,904 --> 00:21:08,906
Thank you.

367
00:21:25,422 --> 00:21:27,466
You gonna eye-fuck that all day?

368
00:21:27,508 --> 00:21:29,760
Let's go.

369
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:42,439
Hmm.

370
00:21:42,481 --> 00:21:44,316
What is it?

371
00:21:44,358 --> 00:21:45,901
Nothing.

372
00:22:08,132 --> 00:22:10,259
This kid is full of surprises.

373
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:12,344
Okay, ma'am, all done.

374
00:22:13,804 --> 00:22:15,097
Thank you, guys.

375
00:22:15,139 --> 00:22:17,266
Thank you.

376
00:22:17,308 --> 00:22:18,767
Get your John Hancock?

377
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:20,394
- Oh, sure.
- Thank you.

378
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,606
Ooh. Excuse me, bud.

379
00:22:35,117 --> 00:22:37,619
What, you want a...
autograph or something?

380
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:50,215
Haven't we met before?

381
00:22:55,637 --> 00:22:56,930
Maybe.

382
00:22:56,972 --> 00:22:58,849
I meet a ton of people.

383
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:00,684
Come on, man.
My meter's running out.

384
00:23:00,726 --> 00:23:02,644
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

385
00:23:02,686 --> 00:23:05,022
- Excuse us, brother.
- Yeah.

386
00:23:08,317 --> 00:23:11,612
You trying to get us killed?

387
00:23:45,187 --> 00:23:47,815
Yeah.

388
00:23:49,525 --> 00:23:51,652
I'll be right there.

389
00:23:51,693 --> 00:23:53,487
Look, Translucent's
probably just lurking

390
00:23:53,529 --> 00:23:55,322
around a gynecologist's office
or something.

391
00:23:55,364 --> 00:23:56,740
For two days? Come on.

392
00:23:56,782 --> 00:23:57,991
I don't get it.

393
00:23:58,033 --> 00:23:59,701
Why is no one concerned
about this?

394
00:23:59,743 --> 00:24:01,995
Because if people find out
one of the Seven is missing,

395
00:24:02,037 --> 00:24:03,539
they panic.

396
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,542
Besides, you can't fucking stand
Translucent.

397
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,919
- Give 'em hell, Homelander!
- Yeah, you bet, pal.

398
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:10,921
Of course. But if something's
happened to him,

399
00:24:10,963 --> 00:24:12,923
then that's a direct attack
on the Seven,

400
00:24:12,965 --> 00:24:15,008
which is a direct attack on me.

401
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,444
You've managed
to make this about you

402
00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:17,845
in less than 20 seconds flat.

403
00:24:17,886 --> 00:24:19,697
Hey, I'm not the one who's down
a point and a half.

404
00:24:19,721 --> 00:24:21,348
So I think
what you mean to say is,

405
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,016
"Gee, thanks, Homelander,

406
00:24:23,058 --> 00:24:24,518
"for showing up out of the blue

407
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,995
and bringing the extra press
to my collar."

408
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:28,063
Homelander. Maeve.

409
00:24:28,105 --> 00:24:31,400
Captain, you guys
are the real heroes.

410
00:24:31,442 --> 00:24:33,694
- We're just glad we can help, right?
- That's right.

411
00:24:33,735 --> 00:24:35,821
- Where's your shooter?
- Shooter's on 31.

412
00:24:35,863 --> 00:24:37,030
All right. Sit tight.

413
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,328
Elevators?

414
00:24:47,124 --> 00:24:49,168
I'm just saying,
a missing team member

415
00:24:49,209 --> 00:24:52,337
is more important
than A-Train's insipid race.

416
00:24:52,379 --> 00:24:54,840
Mr. Edgar
wants us both at the race

417
00:24:54,882 --> 00:24:56,592
to roll out
his new talking points.

418
00:24:56,633 --> 00:24:57,718
You know this.

419
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:59,803
I've X-rayed Edgar, you know.

420
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:02,139
He is this close to a coronary.

421
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:04,141
He's got blood like engine oil.

422
00:25:04,183 --> 00:25:07,227
And Stillwell,
with that mewling baby...

423
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:09,062
It's ridiculous.

424
00:25:09,104 --> 00:25:10,898
They're just people.

425
00:25:10,939 --> 00:25:12,900
But they snap their fingers
and we jump.

426
00:25:12,941 --> 00:25:14,651
Why? Why do we do that?

427
00:25:14,693 --> 00:25:17,196
'Cause they sign our checks.

428
00:25:17,237 --> 00:25:18,405
Can we just cut to the part

429
00:25:18,447 --> 00:25:21,408
where you show up to the race
anyway?

430
00:25:23,035 --> 00:25:24,870
See, that's why I love you.

431
00:25:25,913 --> 00:25:28,040
You're the only one

432
00:25:28,081 --> 00:25:30,000
who tells me the truth.

433
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:39,968
Mm-mm.

434
00:25:50,229 --> 00:25:52,064
It's all over.

435
00:25:54,608 --> 00:25:57,027
It's all over now.

436
00:25:57,069 --> 00:25:58,987
There you go.

437
00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:11,708
Goddamn it.

438
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,925
That was my collar.

439
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:21,927
Eh, it still is.

440
00:26:21,969 --> 00:26:24,888
Yeah, well, I can't walk him
on The Today Show like that.

441
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,640
No, that's true.

442
00:26:26,682 --> 00:26:28,183
I got excited.

443
00:26:28,225 --> 00:26:29,560
I'm sorry.

444
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:31,436
I'm sure you are.

445
00:26:31,478 --> 00:26:32,437
You know the drill.

446
00:26:32,479 --> 00:26:33,897
He shot at us first.

447
00:26:36,775 --> 00:26:38,443
Attagirl.

448
00:26:48,453 --> 00:26:50,163
The things I let you do to me.

449
00:26:50,205 --> 00:26:51,415
Yeah.

450
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:52,958
We're not even dating anymore.

451
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:03,844
Fuck.

452
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:14,396
Want me to do the thing?

453
00:27:14,438 --> 00:27:16,857
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

454
00:27:16,898 --> 00:27:18,692
Okay.

455
00:27:21,111 --> 00:27:24,114
That's a good boy.

456
00:27:27,784 --> 00:27:29,953
Mmm.

457
00:27:38,503 --> 00:27:40,589
Oh, stop. Stop, stop.

458
00:27:40,631 --> 00:27:43,008
Tickles. Tickling.

459
00:27:45,927 --> 00:27:47,971
What's the problem?

460
00:27:48,013 --> 00:27:50,057
Shockwave's the problem.

461
00:27:50,098 --> 00:27:51,516
What if I lose?

462
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:53,310
You're not gonna lose.

463
00:27:53,352 --> 00:27:55,479
You're the fastest man alive.

464
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,314
Until I'm not.

465
00:27:57,356 --> 00:27:59,358
You know what Stillwell told me?

466
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:00,901
If I don't win, I'm out.

467
00:28:00,942 --> 00:28:04,655
Nobody wants the second
fastest man in The Seven.

468
00:28:08,909 --> 00:28:10,952
Babe.

469
00:28:14,331 --> 00:28:17,459
Compound V. Where'd you put it?

470
00:28:17,501 --> 00:28:21,254
Oh, you sure, babe?
I mean, that stuff, it...

471
00:28:21,296 --> 00:28:23,715
amps you up something fierce.

472
00:28:23,757 --> 00:28:25,092
Remember last time?

473
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:27,010
Last time's not gonna
happen again.

474
00:28:27,052 --> 00:28:30,180
I'm under control. Uh...

475
00:28:30,222 --> 00:28:32,933
You ran through a girl, baby.

476
00:28:32,974 --> 00:28:36,186
That's not what
I would call "control."

477
00:28:36,228 --> 00:28:38,939
That shit's a slippery slope.

478
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,774
Take it from me.

479
00:28:40,816 --> 00:28:42,776
No, I... I need it.

480
00:28:42,818 --> 00:28:45,654
Honey, I'll still
love you even if you lose.

481
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:48,156
How is that supposed
to help me right now?

482
00:28:48,198 --> 00:28:51,868
- Uh...
- I have to win this thing.

483
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:54,413
I don't want to be
some washed up B-squader.

484
00:28:54,454 --> 00:28:56,832
Like me?

485
00:28:56,873 --> 00:28:58,375
No, not like... That's...

486
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:06,383
I got to go.

487
00:29:06,425 --> 00:29:09,469
Why don't you just tell me
where the V is, please?

488
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:12,222
I'll come back to see you
tomorrow after the race.

489
00:29:13,265 --> 00:29:15,434
What are you talking about?

490
00:29:17,436 --> 00:29:19,271
I've been meaning to tell you.

491
00:29:19,312 --> 00:29:21,773
Are you kidding me?

492
00:29:21,815 --> 00:29:25,068
I have been getting my hair
done, threading my eyebrows,

493
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,988
waxing my body
like a plucked chicken,

494
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:30,991
so that we could finally
stand up there together tomorrow

495
00:29:31,032 --> 00:29:33,076
in front of the world
as a couple.

496
00:29:33,118 --> 00:29:35,871
I mean, it was all cleared
with Stillwell and everything.

497
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,082
Um...

498
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:42,127
You did clear it with Stillwell.

499
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:45,464
Look, our time is gonna come,
I promise,

500
00:29:45,505 --> 00:29:47,924
but I got to get
my leverage back first.

501
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:51,470
Where's the V?

502
00:29:57,809 --> 00:30:00,312
- What the hell is Compound V?
- Sounds like

503
00:30:00,353 --> 00:30:02,022
some kind
of performance enhancer.

504
00:30:02,063 --> 00:30:04,357
- Steroids for Supes?
- Yeah. Well, whatever it was,

505
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,651
he was juiced on it
when he murdered Robin.

506
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,632
What are you grinning at?

507
00:30:28,673 --> 00:30:30,383
Oh, I don't know, mate.

508
00:30:30,425 --> 00:30:32,928
Maybe it's 'cause
The Seven might just be a squad

509
00:30:32,969 --> 00:30:35,555
of manky 'roid heads.

510
00:30:35,597 --> 00:30:38,016
Now this is exactly the kind
of malfeasance that Langley

511
00:30:38,058 --> 00:30:39,559
is gonna eat up by the spoonful.

512
00:30:39,601 --> 00:30:42,187
Not until we're sure
it does what we think it does.

513
00:30:42,229 --> 00:30:44,272
If we get a bit,
can you work it out?

514
00:30:44,314 --> 00:30:46,066
Oh, I can run some tests,
of course.

515
00:30:46,107 --> 00:30:48,443
But there's no way of knowing
unless I try some myself.

516
00:30:48,485 --> 00:30:50,028
Amazing idea.

517
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,630
We'll cross that bridge
when we burn it.

518
00:30:51,655 --> 00:30:54,866
First of all...

519
00:30:54,908 --> 00:30:57,410
we got to get some.

520
00:31:22,102 --> 00:31:24,104
Here's your cover.

521
00:31:24,145 --> 00:31:26,731
You're a mild-mannered reporter.

522
00:31:26,773 --> 00:31:28,400
So, uh...

523
00:31:28,441 --> 00:31:32,821
Butcher tells me he met you,
what, a few days ago?

524
00:31:34,072 --> 00:31:36,324
Yeah.

525
00:31:36,366 --> 00:31:38,159
Yeah, that sounds right.

526
00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:40,829
I don't know.
I've kind of lost track of time.

527
00:31:40,871 --> 00:31:42,497
Talk about a baptism of fire.

528
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:45,083
I'll mic you up here.

529
00:31:46,918 --> 00:31:49,462
So, Translucent, huh?

530
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:53,174
How the fuck
did you pull that off?

531
00:31:55,176 --> 00:31:57,262
I don't know.
Just lucky, I guess.

532
00:31:57,304 --> 00:31:59,890
Still. Must have been scary.

533
00:32:03,184 --> 00:32:04,853
You want to know
what's really messed up?

534
00:32:04,895 --> 00:32:08,148
Is, uh...

535
00:32:08,189 --> 00:32:10,483
in some ways...

536
00:32:10,525 --> 00:32:13,153
just right in that moment, it...

537
00:32:13,194 --> 00:32:15,614
felt kind of good.

538
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:19,910
It's written all over your face,
Hughie.

539
00:32:19,951 --> 00:32:22,162
What? How can you tell?

540
00:32:22,203 --> 00:32:25,165
'Cause I know
how this job makes me feel.

541
00:32:25,206 --> 00:32:27,876
When I had the detonator
in my hand, I felt, like, a...

542
00:32:27,918 --> 00:32:29,294
I felt, like, a rush.

543
00:32:29,336 --> 00:32:31,338
I get it.

544
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:34,257
- Like I felt alive.
- But that rush, Hughie,

545
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:36,843
is no different
than the shit A-Train shoots up.

546
00:32:36,885 --> 00:32:39,095
Everything comes with a price.

547
00:32:48,605 --> 00:32:51,316
The last thing
I ever said to Robin...

548
00:32:51,358 --> 00:32:56,196
was "Don't you ever
besmirch Billy Joel."

549
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:00,492
That was the last thing
that she heard

550
00:33:00,533 --> 00:33:02,827
before she burst into pieces.

551
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:06,790
And-and I got to live with that
shit for the rest of my life.

552
00:33:14,381 --> 00:33:16,383
The price?

553
00:33:17,926 --> 00:33:19,886
Whatever it is...

554
00:33:19,928 --> 00:33:22,013
I'll pay it.

555
00:33:28,561 --> 00:33:32,691
This...
is the Race of the Century.

556
00:33:34,192 --> 00:33:37,570
This... is our legacy
and our future.

557
00:33:37,612 --> 00:33:40,615
Athletes achieving
at the highest level.

558
00:33:42,701 --> 00:33:46,454
This is what we've waited for...
The showdown.

559
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:49,916
These men are extremely
powerful and very, very quick.

560
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:51,751
The Train is ready
to leave the station.

561
00:33:51,793 --> 00:33:55,588
He reaches speeds in excess
of 1,000 miles per hour.

562
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,632
The fastest men in the world
are here in New York.

563
00:33:57,674 --> 00:33:59,843
Who will come out on top?
There he stands...

564
00:33:59,884 --> 00:34:02,554
Six foot one,
but a stature that's such

565
00:34:02,595 --> 00:34:04,472
that he's a colossus
for the whole world.

566
00:34:10,895 --> 00:34:13,148
♪ I'll put his blood
in my veins ♪

567
00:34:13,189 --> 00:34:15,442
♪ Ring the alarms, right
until my very last breath ♪

568
00:34:15,483 --> 00:34:17,736
♪ Nothing less, yes,
the best, giving it my all... ♪

569
00:34:17,777 --> 00:34:19,738
- All right, champ.
- Mmm.

570
00:34:19,779 --> 00:34:21,156
You got this?

571
00:34:21,197 --> 00:34:22,949
Yeah.

572
00:34:22,991 --> 00:34:24,993
Hey...

573
00:34:25,035 --> 00:34:29,122
Ma is looking down
on us both right now.

574
00:34:29,164 --> 00:34:32,000
Putting that wind at your back.

575
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:34,127
Now, you got this?

576
00:34:34,169 --> 00:34:36,046
- I got this.
- That's what

577
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:37,565
- I'm talking about!
- I got this. Yeah.

578
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:39,716
- That's what I want to hear.
- All right.

579
00:34:43,261 --> 00:34:46,806
Introducing
the newest member of The Seven...

580
00:34:46,848 --> 00:34:49,976
Starlight,
accompanied by Black Noir.

581
00:34:53,354 --> 00:34:55,648
I'm tired of

582
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:58,902
the red tape
and the deep-state bureaucrats.

583
00:34:58,943 --> 00:35:01,362
If the people want us
in the armed forces,

584
00:35:01,404 --> 00:35:03,907
the people can order Congress
to do it.

585
00:35:03,948 --> 00:35:07,660
Am I right? Yes!

586
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,004
Sorry I'm late.

587
00:35:18,046 --> 00:35:20,757
You got room for one more?

588
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:22,842
Ravishing as ever, my sweet.

589
00:35:22,884 --> 00:35:25,220
Hey, who's ready to see a race?

590
00:35:25,261 --> 00:35:27,764
Huh?

591
00:35:27,806 --> 00:35:29,766
Let's hear it for my boy
A-Train.

592
00:35:29,808 --> 00:35:31,476
All right.

593
00:35:31,518 --> 00:35:33,228
You fucking cocksuckers.

594
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:35,230
Please remain
standing for the singing

595
00:35:35,271 --> 00:35:36,731
of our national anthem.

596
00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:43,113
Thank you for coming.
It was nice to meet you.

597
00:35:44,405 --> 00:35:47,325
Aren't you cute?

598
00:35:47,367 --> 00:35:50,995
Is it okay if I get a selfie?

599
00:35:51,037 --> 00:35:53,331
Of course, honey. Take this.

600
00:35:57,127 --> 00:35:59,087
Look at you!

601
00:35:59,129 --> 00:36:01,172
You really dress the part.

602
00:36:01,214 --> 00:36:03,842
It's your old uniform, but
I'm saving up for the new one.

603
00:36:09,013 --> 00:36:10,765
Hey, Starlight!

604
00:36:10,807 --> 00:36:12,392
Show us your tits!

605
00:36:12,433 --> 00:36:13,810
Come on!

606
00:36:13,852 --> 00:36:15,395
- Come on!
- Baby!

607
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,773
Damn, baby, you look fine AF!

608
00:36:18,815 --> 00:36:20,942
Lean down a little bit more!

609
00:36:20,984 --> 00:36:22,819
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

610
00:36:22,861 --> 00:36:25,613
You do not need to press
your luck right now, right?

611
00:36:25,655 --> 00:36:27,115
Kick my ass, Starlight!

612
00:36:27,157 --> 00:36:30,243
Sweetie, you know what?
Save your money.

613
00:36:30,285 --> 00:36:32,370
I like that one much better.

614
00:36:35,707 --> 00:36:38,168
- Starlight?
- I need a minute.

615
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:40,378
- Where's she going?
- Starlight!

616
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,754
Starlight, come here, honey.

617
00:36:41,796 --> 00:36:43,965
Let's make some noise!

618
00:36:50,513 --> 00:36:52,390
Glad you made it.

619
00:36:52,432 --> 00:36:54,017
I had a feeling you might.

620
00:36:54,058 --> 00:36:57,729
Remember when used to just
fly off to Paris, like,

621
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,898
- on a whim?
- Yeah, I remember

622
00:36:59,939 --> 00:37:01,499
freezing my ass off
across the Atlantic.

623
00:37:01,524 --> 00:37:03,276
Yeah, those were good times.

624
00:37:03,318 --> 00:37:05,820
Why did we ever break up?

625
00:37:05,862 --> 00:37:08,948
You mind if we not crack open
that tawdry little chapter?

626
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:12,035
Oh, come on.

627
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,000
You know...

628
00:37:19,042 --> 00:37:20,418
Yeah, kiss her!

629
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:24,923
If I ever really thought

630
00:37:24,964 --> 00:37:28,468
- that you'd fallen for someone else...
- Mm.

631
00:37:28,509 --> 00:37:30,803
I just...
I don't think I could handle it.

632
00:37:30,845 --> 00:37:33,014
- Is that so?
- Yeah, you and me?

633
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,349
- Mm.
- We're different.

634
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:37,018
We're better.

635
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,604
- Together forever.
- Okay, well...

636
00:37:46,903 --> 00:37:49,072
Here comes the A-Train.

637
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:52,408
All aboard!

638
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:54,869
The Train is ready
to leave the station.

639
00:37:54,911 --> 00:37:57,330
♪ The paparazzi smash
for the best all around ♪

00:38:24,565 --> 00:38:26,901
Ooh!

648
00:38:26,943 --> 00:38:29,279
All right, Frenchie, find it.
You're in the clear.

649
00:38:32,156 --> 00:38:33,616
Starlight! Starlight!

650
00:38:33,658 --> 00:38:35,034
Starlight!

651
00:38:35,076 --> 00:38:36,536
Starlight, over here!

652
00:38:38,705 --> 00:38:40,456
Annie?

653
00:38:40,498 --> 00:38:42,625
I love your new outfit!

654
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:45,086
Annie? Annie!

655
00:38:45,128 --> 00:38:46,421
Annie? Hi!

656
00:38:46,462 --> 00:38:48,840
Hughie?

657
00:38:48,881 --> 00:38:50,258
From the bench the other day?

658
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,553
You're, uh... you're Starlight.

659
00:38:53,594 --> 00:38:55,847
That's...
How did I not realize that?

660
00:38:55,888 --> 00:38:58,182
It's actually kind of comforting
that you didn't.

661
00:38:58,224 --> 00:38:59,892
Fuckin' hell, Hughie.

662
00:38:59,934 --> 00:39:01,436
You know Starlight?

663
00:39:01,477 --> 00:39:04,439
Well, Hughie, it was...

664
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,250
It was really nice to see you,
but I should get going.

665
00:39:06,274 --> 00:39:08,901
- No, Hughie, we need more time.
- Can I, uh,

666
00:39:08,943 --> 00:39:10,570
buy you an overpriced beer?

667
00:39:10,611 --> 00:39:13,072
You know, if you've-you've...
if you got time.

668
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:18,494
Throw in some overpriced nachos?

669
00:39:18,536 --> 00:39:21,914
- Lead the way.
- Okay.

670
00:39:33,468 --> 00:39:35,595
No V.
Must have hid it somewhere else.

671
00:39:35,636 --> 00:39:37,347
Fucking find it, Frenchie.

672
00:39:37,388 --> 00:39:39,557
This is just so weird.
I mean, the other day...

673
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,309
- Was it three days ago?
- Mm-hmm.

674
00:39:41,351 --> 00:39:44,896
You just seemed, like...
You seemed so normal, you know?

675
00:39:44,937 --> 00:39:47,774
- And now, it's just...
- Now, I'm a freak.

676
00:39:47,815 --> 00:39:50,234
No. No, not at... No, that's not
what I meant at all.

677
00:39:50,276 --> 00:39:54,322
I just meant... I just...
I wasn't getting Beyoncé vibes,

678
00:39:54,364 --> 00:39:55,948
but... not that
you don't have that...

679
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:58,451
- I'm messing with you.
- Okay.

680
00:40:03,247 --> 00:40:04,999
Bad news.

681
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:07,418
- No V.
- Great. We're fucked.

682
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,170
No, it...

683
00:40:09,212 --> 00:40:11,047
It was really nice
to talk to someone

684
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:14,092
who didn't know who I was.

685
00:40:14,133 --> 00:40:18,930
Once you're behind the scenes,
it's...

686
00:40:18,971 --> 00:40:22,308
- it's different.
- Like how?

687
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:26,062
I don't know... if they really
want you to be a hero.

688
00:40:27,647 --> 00:40:29,690
I think they just want you
to look like one.

689
00:40:37,031 --> 00:40:40,243
The other day on the bench
when you were talking

690
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:43,079
about how much
you hated your job, you meant...

691
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:44,747
you meant this job?

692
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:50,128
Then, um...

693
00:40:52,547 --> 00:40:54,841
just quit.

694
00:40:54,882 --> 00:40:56,509
Just walk away.

695
00:40:56,551 --> 00:40:58,636
I mean,
you got nothing to prove.

696
00:41:04,267 --> 00:41:06,269
I should probably get back,

697
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,479
you know, before they send
a search party for me.

698
00:41:08,521 --> 00:41:11,065
- So...
- Yeah, totally. Um...

699
00:41:11,107 --> 00:41:14,193
listen, Annie... Starlight.

700
00:41:14,235 --> 00:41:15,736
- What do you, uh...?
- Annie.

701
00:41:15,778 --> 00:41:19,532
Um, this is insane, but, uh...

702
00:41:19,574 --> 00:41:20,908
I know you're you
and everything,

703
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,202
but if you ever
just wanted to...

704
00:41:23,244 --> 00:41:25,079
you know, get...

705
00:41:25,121 --> 00:41:27,123
Would you like my number?

706
00:41:30,251 --> 00:41:33,421
Yeah. Yeah, that's-that's, uh...

707
00:41:33,463 --> 00:41:35,423
that's what I was asking.

708
00:41:35,465 --> 00:41:37,675
- Okay.
- Do I call you,

709
00:41:37,717 --> 00:41:39,778
- or do I just commit a crime?
- Probably committing a crime

710
00:41:39,802 --> 00:41:41,721
would get me
to you quicker, so...

711
00:41:41,762 --> 00:41:44,599
There's a new young gun in town
and I'm ready to rock the show.

712
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,435
Ladies and gentlemen,

713
00:41:47,477 --> 00:41:49,687
here comes Shockwave.

714
00:42:03,075 --> 00:42:05,036
You all right?

715
00:42:05,077 --> 00:42:07,580
Huh? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm good. I'm good.

716
00:42:07,622 --> 00:42:09,957
I'm fast, baby.
Like, how I roll, you know?

717
00:42:09,999 --> 00:42:11,959
You look wired as hell.

718
00:42:12,001 --> 00:42:14,295
Well, it's just Mom's, uh...
Her spirit

719
00:42:14,337 --> 00:42:16,315
is flowing through my body,
you know what I'm saying?

720
00:42:16,339 --> 00:42:18,591
I've got eyes on A-Train.

721
00:42:18,633 --> 00:42:19,926
He's totally jacked.

722
00:42:19,967 --> 00:42:21,469
He must've shot up the V.

723
00:42:21,511 --> 00:42:24,013
We missed it, boys.

724
00:42:42,406 --> 00:42:45,326
I'm out of here.
I'll check in later.

725
00:42:45,368 --> 00:42:48,496
Where the hell you going?

726
00:42:48,538 --> 00:42:49,956
Just gonna see about a girl.

727
00:42:49,997 --> 00:42:51,290
Ladies and gentlemen,

728
00:42:51,332 --> 00:42:54,794
please turn your attention
to the track.

729
00:43:26,617 --> 00:43:30,162
Please, clear the track.

730
00:43:32,999 --> 00:43:34,875
Set.

731
00:43:49,682 --> 00:43:50,933
Yes!

732
00:43:50,975 --> 00:43:52,685
He's done it again!

733
00:43:52,727 --> 00:43:55,271
A-Train wins!

734
00:43:55,313 --> 00:43:56,814
A new world record for A-Train.

735
00:43:56,856 --> 00:43:59,233
They say lightning
doesn't strike twice.

736
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:03,279
The world belongs to A-Train.

737
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:06,824
A-Train wins.

738
00:44:06,866 --> 00:44:08,242
A-Train wins!

739
00:44:08,284 --> 00:44:11,746
Stunning! Absolutely stunning.

740
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,462
So, how the hell
do you know Starlight?

741
00:44:19,503 --> 00:44:21,631
I don't really know her
know her.

742
00:44:21,672 --> 00:44:23,758
Just, uh...

743
00:44:23,799 --> 00:44:26,302
we met on a park bench.

744
00:44:26,344 --> 00:44:28,804
Huh. You get her number?

745
00:44:32,516 --> 00:44:34,727
Yeah.

746
00:44:35,728 --> 00:44:36,687
Hughie?

747
00:44:36,729 --> 00:44:39,940
Uh, yeah. Got it.

748
00:44:39,982 --> 00:44:41,192
Good.

749
00:44:46,322 --> 00:44:48,282
M.M.

750
00:44:48,324 --> 00:44:51,452
Popclaw's eyeballing a vial of V
like it's made of Snickers.

751
00:44:51,494 --> 00:44:53,263
What, you think she nicked
some of A-Train's stash?

752
00:44:53,287 --> 00:44:54,997
That's exactly what I'm saying.

753
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:56,457
Get over here now.

754
00:44:56,499 --> 00:45:00,252
Well,
you know what? Shockwave ran

755
00:45:00,294 --> 00:45:02,171
a good, clean race,
but, uh, there can only be

756
00:45:02,213 --> 00:45:04,173
one fastest man in the world,

757
00:45:04,215 --> 00:45:05,966
and that's the A-Train, baby!

758
00:45:06,008 --> 00:45:07,843
- Yes, baby.
- A-Train,

759
00:45:07,885 --> 00:45:10,721
how are you celebrating tonight?
Any special girl?

760
00:45:10,763 --> 00:45:12,765
Uh... well, you know me.

761
00:45:13,808 --> 00:45:15,476
I'm always in the game,

762
00:45:15,518 --> 00:45:17,812
but I'm too fast to catch.

763
00:45:17,853 --> 00:45:20,940
I'm open to offers,
though, ladies.

764
00:45:20,981 --> 00:45:22,525
There's plenty to go around.

765
00:45:22,566 --> 00:45:23,734
A-Train, how have you managed

766
00:45:23,776 --> 00:45:25,277
to stay on top all this time?

767
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:27,279
What's your secret?

768
00:45:27,321 --> 00:45:30,282
Secret? There's no secret.

769
00:45:30,324 --> 00:45:33,035
It's just about discipline
and training

770
00:45:33,077 --> 00:45:35,413
and keeping your head
in the game, staying focused.

771
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,557
Fucking hell.

772
00:45:54,598 --> 00:45:56,809
You said it.

773
00:45:56,851 --> 00:45:58,436
She's been at it for an hour.

774
00:45:58,477 --> 00:46:00,354
Come and get me!

775
00:46:00,396 --> 00:46:02,940
How'd you know
to keep an eye on her?

776
00:46:02,982 --> 00:46:04,859
Okay.

777
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,193
You see that red case
over there?

778
00:46:06,235 --> 00:46:07,903
I've been around long enough
to know

779
00:46:07,945 --> 00:46:09,613
a fix kit when I see one.

780
00:46:09,655 --> 00:46:13,075
And she told A-Train
that V's a slippery slope.

781
00:46:13,117 --> 00:46:14,785
So she's got experience.

782
00:46:14,827 --> 00:46:16,346
I figured if you wait around
long enough,

783
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:18,080
two plus two equals nasty.

784
00:46:18,122 --> 00:46:19,999
Sherlock fucking Homie.

785
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,792
Now admit it.

786
00:46:21,834 --> 00:46:25,212
This beats babysitting
delinquents any day, don't it?

787
00:46:25,254 --> 00:46:28,257
Fuck...

788
00:46:28,299 --> 00:46:33,012
♪ You never saw the signs... ♪

789
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,026
Oh.

790
00:46:49,695 --> 00:46:53,407
- Hey, Popclaw.
- Mr. Lutz. Um...

791
00:46:53,449 --> 00:46:55,951
- house call?
- I'm just here for the rent.

792
00:46:55,993 --> 00:46:57,953
The rent you said you would pay?

793
00:46:57,995 --> 00:46:59,830
You should come in.

794
00:46:59,872 --> 00:47:02,291
You can wait there if you want,

795
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:04,478
but it's gonna take me a few
minutes to write the check.

796
00:47:04,502 --> 00:47:06,462
I don't bite.

797
00:47:06,504 --> 00:47:07,671
Unless you want me to.

798
00:47:07,713 --> 00:47:09,590
That was a joke, Alek.

799
00:47:09,632 --> 00:47:11,759
- Oh.
- Alek, right?

800
00:47:11,801 --> 00:47:13,469
Okay, let's get that check.

801
00:47:13,511 --> 00:47:16,430
You want a drink, Alek,
while you wait?

802
00:47:16,472 --> 00:47:19,433
- You prefer Alek or Alexander?
- Alek.

803
00:47:19,475 --> 00:47:21,602
It's actually short
for, uh, Aleksy.

804
00:47:21,644 --> 00:47:23,312
I like that.

805
00:47:23,354 --> 00:47:25,064
Sounds more exotic.

806
00:47:25,105 --> 00:47:26,565
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

807
00:47:33,572 --> 00:47:35,574
Like what you see?

808
00:47:35,616 --> 00:47:37,493
Huh? No.

809
00:47:37,535 --> 00:47:38,577
Yes.

810
00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:41,372
I mean, it's... lovely.

811
00:47:41,413 --> 00:47:42,832
It's okay.

812
00:47:42,873 --> 00:47:45,501
A lot of guys
have a superhero fantasy.

813
00:47:45,543 --> 00:47:48,045
Uh...

814
00:47:48,087 --> 00:47:49,630
I-I'm sorry?

815
00:47:49,672 --> 00:47:52,842
I mean, I... I mean...

816
00:47:57,429 --> 00:48:00,808
- You know...
- Hmm.

817
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:02,852
There is a world

818
00:48:02,893 --> 00:48:04,895
where we could come...

819
00:48:07,356 --> 00:48:10,317
to an understanding.

820
00:48:14,238 --> 00:48:17,867
Stop! In the name of the law.

821
00:48:17,908 --> 00:48:19,285
Oh, no. Popclaw has caught me.

822
00:48:23,163 --> 00:48:25,833
I am gonna sit right here

823
00:48:25,875 --> 00:48:28,377
until the cops come.

824
00:48:28,419 --> 00:48:30,296
You're not a cat burglar.

825
00:48:30,337 --> 00:48:33,299
You're a filthy pig. Say it.

826
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:37,636
You're a filthy pig
who likes to eat ass.

827
00:48:37,678 --> 00:48:39,138
Say it!

828
00:48:39,179 --> 00:48:40,389
I'm a filthy pig

829
00:48:40,431 --> 00:48:41,765
who likes to eat ass.

830
00:48:41,807 --> 00:48:43,893
Stay still.

831
00:48:43,934 --> 00:48:46,061
You like to eat ass?

832
00:48:54,486 --> 00:48:56,214
- He can't breathe.
- No, no, wait. Wait, wait.

833
00:48:56,238 --> 00:48:58,532
Hold on. Hey, there.
Hey, there. Not so fast.

834
00:49:28,145 --> 00:49:30,856
Oh, my...

835
00:49:33,776 --> 00:49:37,279
You let that guy die.

836
00:49:37,321 --> 00:49:39,031
And he didn't do anything wrong.

837
00:49:39,073 --> 00:49:40,157
He was dead already.

838
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:41,492
That's bullshit.

839
00:49:41,533 --> 00:49:43,285
So you can cross a street,

840
00:49:43,327 --> 00:49:45,496
run up four flights of stairs
in ten seconds

841
00:49:45,537 --> 00:49:47,539
like some Supe, can you?

842
00:49:48,582 --> 00:49:50,250
And even if
you had've got there,

843
00:49:50,292 --> 00:49:52,670
she would have clawed
your fucking head off.

844
00:49:52,711 --> 00:49:56,298
Now we got her
right where we want her.

845
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:58,217
What? What?
What are you talking about?

846
00:49:58,258 --> 00:50:00,260
You're a smart lad,
but you still ain't twigged

847
00:50:00,302 --> 00:50:03,347
the one weakness they all got.

848
00:50:05,849 --> 00:50:08,811
Their reputations.

849
00:50:08,852 --> 00:50:10,854
Come on, Frenchie.

850
00:50:18,362 --> 00:50:20,322
Like you said.

851
00:50:20,364 --> 00:50:23,325
Whatever the price,
you'll pay it.

852
00:50:23,367 --> 00:50:25,369
Right?

853
00:50:33,127 --> 00:50:34,878
Easy. Easy.

854
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,589
We ain't here to hurt you.

855
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:43,350
We're gonna help you
sort out this little mess.

856
00:50:48,892 --> 00:50:50,894
And all you got to do

857
00:50:50,936 --> 00:50:55,024
is tell us everything you know
about this.

858
00:50:56,066 --> 00:50:58,277
Who are you?

859
00:51:00,779 --> 00:51:04,575
All right, I got your message.
Where is the fire?

860
00:51:04,616 --> 00:51:08,203
No, no, not fire. Water.

861
00:51:08,245 --> 00:51:10,748
Just ask my little guppy here.

862
00:51:12,291 --> 00:51:14,293
You can show her.

863
00:51:17,337 --> 00:51:20,466
Well, a very good friend of mine

864
00:51:20,507 --> 00:51:21,967
- found this.
- It was a porpoise.

865
00:51:22,009 --> 00:51:24,553
A fucking porpoise found this
at the bottom

866
00:51:24,595 --> 00:51:25,929
of the harbor.

867
00:51:29,183 --> 00:51:30,976
Go ahead, don't be shy.

868
00:51:38,942 --> 00:51:40,986
Oh! Jesus Christ.

869
00:51:41,028 --> 00:51:42,362
Is that Translucent?

870
00:51:42,404 --> 00:51:44,573
Still think we got nothing
to worry about?

871
00:51:44,615 --> 00:51:46,909
How did they even get through
his skin?

872
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:48,911
What kind of maniac...

873
00:51:48,952 --> 00:51:51,747
Mm-mm. Not maniac.

874
00:51:51,789 --> 00:51:54,792
Smart, actually.

875
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:57,920
Very smart.

876
00:51:57,961 --> 00:52:02,257
Hey, Deep,
what can't I see through?

877
00:52:02,299 --> 00:52:04,802
- Zinc, Homelander.
- Correct.

878
00:52:04,843 --> 00:52:06,845
And what's the box made of,
Deep?

879
00:52:10,015 --> 00:52:13,018
- Zinc.
- Correct again.

880
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:15,771
They also knew
that we'd find Translucent...

881
00:52:15,813 --> 00:52:18,607
What's left of him... eventually.

882
00:52:18,649 --> 00:52:20,818
So they were just buying time.

883
00:52:20,859 --> 00:52:22,653
Why do you say that?

884
00:52:22,694 --> 00:52:24,822
I'm so glad you asked.

885
00:52:36,542 --> 00:52:39,378
Whoever it was...

886
00:52:39,419 --> 00:52:41,839
they just declared war.
