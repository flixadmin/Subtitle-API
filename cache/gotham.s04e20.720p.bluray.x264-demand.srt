1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,251
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:06,000
What's your record for how many
banks you've robbed in one day?

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,457
You're playing a dangerous game, Lee.

4
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:12,089
<i>My job is to make sure that
the people of The Narrows are safe.</i>

5
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:14,508
<i>And I will do everything
in my power to ensure that.</i>

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:15,762
I'm looking for Ed Nygma.

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,806
Five banks were robbed last night.

8
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,805
Why don't you try
going after the real criminals?

9
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,223
<i>...making money
off the backs of the poor?</i>

10
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,895
<i>Like Gotham Savings and Loan?</i>

11
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,597
You are a fool!

12
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,432
Come out with your hands up!

13
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,023
I expected you might come, Captain.

14
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,103
There's two of them.

15
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,314
<i>What if he's nuttier
than the other one?</i>

16
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,523
<i>I'm nothing like Jerome!</i>

17
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,609
I'm gonna drive you mad.

18
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,944
<i>But don't worry,
all of Gotham will be joining you.</i>

19
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,449
- Hands up!
- Bombs away!

20
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,456
<i>I'm more than a man,
I'm an idea,</i>

21
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,455
<i>and I will live on in the shadows,</i>

22
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,628
<i>within Gotham's discontent.</i>

23
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,295
<i>Burn it down, brother.</i>

24
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,180
Brothers and sisters,

25
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:08,767
let's raise a glass
to our fallen leader.

26
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,893
To Jerome!

27
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,900
To Jerome!

28
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:33,211
This affair is invitation only.

29
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,761
Well, that's all right,
you're welcome to stay.

30
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:42,763
But you won't be leaving.

31
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,481
<i>Why so sad, bozos?</i>

32
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,283
<i>Did you think they could
get rid of me so easily?</i>

33
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,492
<i>Well, okay. So, they did.</i>

34
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,533
<i>I'm dead,
but let's not dwell on negatives.</i>

35
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,502
<i>I have one last party to throw.</i>

36
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,671
<i>First on the to-do list,</i>

37
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,964
<i>dig me up.</i>

38
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,587
<i>Dig me up!</i>

39
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,838
You heard him!

40
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,300
Come on, clowns! Dig him up!

41
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,097
Get Jerome!

42
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,059
We're gonna dig you up, Jerome!
You hear me?

43
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,396
Come on out of there!
Come on, dig, dig, dig!

44
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,328
- What are you gonna do?
- What can I do?

45
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,789
The back door's
just down that hallway right there.

46
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:58,752
- I'm not letting her go, Harvey.
- Why not?

47
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,336
I'm the only one here.

48
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,638
And I'm really good
at looking the other way, partner.

49
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,714
Not this time.

50
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,392
She robbed a dirty bank.

51
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,228
People get away
with a lot worse in Gotham every day.

52
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,431
Doesn't make it right.

53
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:15,018
We got away with worse.
Both of us.

54
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:16,644
Get out of here.

55
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:17,812
What?

56
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,693
I don't need that crap
thrown in my face right now.

57
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:20,773
Get out of here!

58
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,632
Well, you finally nabbed me, copper.

59
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,880
What the hell, Lee?

60
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:47,099
I don't suppose this is where
anyone expected our story to end.

61
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,219
So, it's ending?

62
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,519
Hard to imagine what's left.

63
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,359
I wanna help you.

64
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,068
- How?
- Give up Nygma.

65
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:04,617
Return the money,
and ask the DA for supervised probation.

66
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,364
I'm not betraying my friend.

67
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,205
They can call you "the Doc,"

68
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,579
you can rob banks, fight gangsters,
but I know you.

69
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,128
You're Lee Thompkins.
And all this, this is just a...

70
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,915
A way of helping people.

71
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,000
I understand that.

72
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,258
Who doesn't want to be Robin Hood?
But you're still breaking the law.

73
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,589
Jim, you wish
you could do what I'm doing.

74
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,850
Helping people without
the straitjacket of the law?

75
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,727
As if the law
means anything in Gotham.

76
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,304
If the law has lost its meaning,

77
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,560
it's because people like you
are turning your back on it.

78
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,189
I am fighting back.
I don't deny anything I've done.

79
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,861
You want to send me to Blackgate?
Go ahead.

80
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,314
I don't want to send you to Blackgate!
It's the last thing I want to do!

81
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,025
Don't you know I wish
I could let you walk out that door,

82
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,452
- turn my head...
- What's holding you back?

83
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:53,328
Maybe if you'd let me go,
you'd let yourself go, too.

84
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:02,125
There are so many things
I wish I could change.

85
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,632
Things that I've done...

86
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,922
Jim...

87
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:20,727
Sorry to stick my face in your business,
but something just came up.

88
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,398
I've already inspected it
for booby traps.

89
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,986
- It's clear.
- Well, that's a relief.

90
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,285
I've taken the liberty of setting up
a monitor in your office.

91
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,672
You don't think
he might still be alive, do you?

92
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,045
What were the autopsy results, Lucius?

93
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,923
Dead when he came in,
more dead when he was eviscerated,

94
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,299
and his brain was sliced up.

95
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,926
<i>Hello, Jimmy!</i>

96
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,928
<i>If you're watching this,</i>

97
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,431
<i>things must not have
gone well for me.</i>

98
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,104
<i>Shucks!</i>

99
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,478
<i>I can only pray,
I gave as good as I got,</i>

100
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:04,483
<i>and left ample carnage in my wake.</i>

101
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,031
<i>But I don't want to fixate
on disappointments.</i>

102
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:11,157
<i>Jimmy, I have one last
teensy request for you.</i>

103
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,948
<i>I want you to throw me a wake</i>

104
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,997
<i>at the GCPD.</i>

105
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,378
<i>Don't worry about the guest list.</i>

106
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,502
<i>I've already sent the invitations.</i>

107
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,131
I don't like the sound of that.

108
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,733
Is everybody ready?

109
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,191
Lock down everything, now!

110
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:51,318
Everybody listen up!
Lock it down! Lock it down, now!

111
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,634
The Doc's taken care of us.
It's time for us to take care of her!

112
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,184
Let's go down there,
and bust her out of jail.

113
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,136
No one cares about the fate
of Lee Thompkins more than me,

114
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,220
is that understood?

115
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:24,559
Which is exactly why I will not have
you bumbling into the GCPD en masse.

116
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,064
So, we're going to let her rot?

117
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,697
Leave her
in the sweaty palms of Jim Gordon?

118
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,400
I would sooner debate you all
on teleology versus deontology,

119
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,531
than leave her with that
overgrown Boy Scout.

120
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:35,907
"Teleo..." Huh?

121
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:36,987
My point exactly.

122
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,823
Look, if I had it my way,

123
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,455
Jim Gordon would be off the field
of play once and for all.

124
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,161
But Lee insists that I employ
only nonlethal means.

125
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,417
So, I and my brilliant crack team

126
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,000
will liberate Lee Thompkins
with surgical precision.

127
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,084
You stay here.

128
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,090
Team, we have everything?

129
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,046
- Bicycle pump? Can opener?
- Right here.

130
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,759
Primer cord? Pickle jar?
Fishing rod?

131
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,686
Fabulous. Okay, you four,
you're with me.

132
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,980
You, go where Jim Gordon goes.

133
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,433
He comes under some harm, assist him.

134
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,644
I do not need Lee blaming me
if he's killed under friendly fire,

135
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,228
while I go about my business, okay?

136
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,858
All right, team, follow my plan,

137
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,815
and we'll be back here
to finish counting this

138
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,571
in just a few hours. Keep it up.

139
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,619
Breaking Lee out
is going to be a piece of cake.

140
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,532
Hello, Wayne Manor.

141
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,706
<i>Alfred, it's Gordon.</i>

142
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:22,829
Where's Bruce?

143
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,161
Well, he's meeting with Jeremiah
about the energy project.

144
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,462
<i>Is something amiss?</i>

145
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,039
He's meeting with Jeremiah Valeska?

146
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,331
Yes, that's right.

147
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,918
Now, you can tell me
why you sound so concerned.

148
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,379
Jerome's followers
are rampaging outside the station.

149
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,462
Oh, I see.

150
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:39,392
Are Master Bruce
and Jeremiah in any danger?

151
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,093
It's hard to say. But right now,

152
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,804
Jeremiah's maze may actually
be the safest place for him.

153
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:47,482
Right, I shall head there nonetheless.
Thank you very much.

154
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:01,743
What's the plan?

155
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,418
- Open up the armory.
- Now you're talkin'.

156
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,493
Guys!

157
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,553
Jim! Hey, Jim!

158
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,384
You figure out
when we're going to hit 'em yet?

159
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,058
- We're not.
- Say what?

160
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,480
You know how Jerome works,

161
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:27,689
dead or alive.

162
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,142
He uses distractions.

163
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,267
So, what, we're going to just let 'em

164
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,852
come in through
the front door and party?

165
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,154
This wake
is just intended to distract us,

166
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,697
while his followers hit the real target.

167
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,150
- Which is?
- Well,

168
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,279
we're never gonna figure that out

169
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,235
if we're inside,
fighting off these maniacs, are we?

170
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,697
Look, they come in
the front door, right?

171
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,283
You fall back, get a few shots off,
make it look good.

172
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,959
Meanwhile, the entire precinct

173
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,002
sneaks out this old service door
as quickly as possible.

174
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,044
I can't believe you're going to
run away from these asses.

175
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,716
Once we're outside,
we surround the building, cordon it off.

176
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,925
- And then we trap 'em all inside.
- Correct. They blow off some steam.

177
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,098
We hit 'em with teargas,
and knock a few heads.

178
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,267
Yeah. Of course,
we still have to figure out

179
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,343
what the real target is.

180
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,769
Got a plan for that?

181
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,971
I do.

182
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:10,229
It's a little sketchy right now,
but come on.

183
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,526
All right, listen up, people!

184
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,112
Here's the plan.

185
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,739
Jeremiah,

186
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,318
I didn't think you could get the
generator program working so quickly.

187
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,452
You ready for a demonstration?

188
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,165
Okay, you hit that switch there,

189
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:30,620
and the facility will be disconnected
from the power grid.

190
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,525
Ambient energy.

191
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:07,991
No cables or wires of any kind.
It's clean and stable.

192
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:11,164
Harvested from micro tremors
and air density shifts, it's...

193
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,163
It's virtually without costs.

194
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:19,335
And with the prototypes at Wayne Labs,
we can power all of Gotham?

195
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,047
You've kept this project
a secret, yes?

196
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,009
No one outside of Wayne Industries
knows it exists.

197
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,768
It's the ones who are closest to you

198
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,566
that you have to keep your eye on.

199
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,774
I know better than anyone.

200
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,610
Arkham Asylum
sent me Jerome's personal effects,

201
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,286
and amongst them, I found his diary.

202
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,496
It's a catalog
of his fantasies and goals.

203
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,879
Every twisted vision he ever had.

204
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,550
Maybe you shouldn't spend
so much time reading it.

205
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:11,809
He was obsessed with torturing and
murdering me, James Gordon, and you,

206
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,890
and if he had been
just the least bit sane,

207
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,396
he would have destroyed us all.

208
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,108
And Gotham would be in ruin.

209
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,953
Your brother's dead, Jeremiah.

210
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:31,578
It's time for you to come out
of this bunker and join the world.

211
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,827
Yes.

212
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,247
Yes, he's dead.

213
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,469
I still have trouble believing it.

214
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,429
Who is that?

215
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:48,928
It's just Alfred.

216
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:51,843
Yeah?

217
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,305
<i>Master Bruce,
I've got some rather disturbing news.</i>

218
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,270
Jerome Valeska's acolytes
are kicking off again.

219
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:03,939
Yes.

220
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:08,028
<i>- Thank you, Alfred.</i>
- I'm on my way.

221
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,664
Lunch plans.

222
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,585
That was a lie.

223
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,625
You're lying to me, Bruce?

224
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,672
You're right. I'm sorry.

225
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:33,602
It seems some of Jerome's followers
are causing trouble.

226
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:39,483
Oh, my God. I was right.

227
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,059
No, Jeremiah.

228
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,862
I was right. He's not dead.

229
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,237
Bruce, he's not dead.
He's alive, and he's coming after me!

230
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:23,691
Jeremiah, easy, easy.
You're not thinking clearly.

231
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:28,070
- Come on, this isn't like you.
- Bruce...

232
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,365
Bruce, I need to tell you something.

233
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,328
After Jerome died,
he left one last final trap for me.

234
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,710
He sprayed me with his insanity gas.

235
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:48,882
"It's a special mixture
just for you, brother," he said.

236
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,097
I can't stop seeing him.

237
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,560
Clawing his way out of his grave,

238
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,484
coming for me,
and even though I know it's not real,

239
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,186
it feels real.

240
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,947
And I can't control myself.

241
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,658
What if I could show you
he's dead and buried?

242
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,327
How?

243
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,545
- We go there, to his grave.
- No.

244
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,418
- No, no, no.
- Jeremiah, listen to me.

245
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:26,965
Your brother took away
your greatest strength,

246
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,294
your mind, and turned it into a trap.

247
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:34,681
But if you can see the reality,
you can be freed from that trap.

248
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,435
You really think that would work?

249
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,517
I do.

250
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,613
Then I'll try.

251
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,234
You're a good friend, Bruce.

252
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,878
I'm getting you
and the other prisoners out of here.

253
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,376
What were you trying
to tell me before, Jim?

254
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,044
There's a van outside,
waiting for transfer.

255
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,801
- Don't ignore me.
- I just want to get you safe first.

256
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,673
- Come to The Narrows.
- What?

257
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,724
Where you can make
a real difference in this city.

258
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,803
You can make up your own rules
about how to do it.

259
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,492
Alvarez, get them out of here. Go.

260
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,911
Don't shoot! Hold your fire.

261
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,186
There's too many of them. Fall back!

262
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:07,392
Fall back!

263
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:24,617
Let's go! Let's go!

264
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,334
Well, look at us.

265
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:40,095
We caught ourselves
Captain James Gordon.

266
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,018
Assassin of Jerome Valeska.

267
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,469
Hi, guys.

268
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,346
Don't try and get chummy
with us, Gordon.

269
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,849
We're gonna carve you up.

270
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,069
Yeah, no, I wasn't talkin' to you.
I was talkin' to them.

271
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,316
Hey, man, you like to dance?

272
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,327
Let's you and me talk outside,
what do you say?

273
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,261
- There's still no answer.
- Then something's wrong.

274
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,014
- We should go.
- He was on his way to your office.

275
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,274
He'll wait for us there.

276
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,856
What was that?

277
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,618
We're almost there.
Just a quick look, and we'll leave.

278
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:51,457
Bruce. Bruce.

279
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,749
I don't know if I can do this.

280
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,928
Just a little further.

281
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,775
Oh, God, no.

282
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,818
His followers must have dug him up.

283
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,646
He's still alive.

284
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:18,898
I knew it.

285
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,984
- We have to get out of here.
- I knew it.

286
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:26,739
- He's alive!
- Jeremiah! Jeremiah!

287
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,431
How much longer are these
petty aggressions going to continue?

288
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,228
There's nothing petty
about my aggression.

289
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:54,767
So, am I to starve until I guess
the source of your resentment?

290
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,109
You said if I joined you,
we'd be back on top.

291
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,988
Instead, we're grubbing for Jerome,
and we got played by Nygma.

292
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:10,161
You said if I joined you,
you'd find me a cure. And, yet...

293
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:16,831
I admit,
that through no fault of my own,

294
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,550
our advancement has not run apace.

295
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,922
"Not run apace"?

296
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,380
We're squatting in Falcone's mansion.

297
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:27,053
We're knockin' over liquor stores
to pay for groceries.

298
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:30,557
Meanwhile, everyone else
is carving up Sofia's territory.

299
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,138
We are lying in wait,
building a nest egg,

300
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,475
while less deliberate players
show us their cards.

301
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,985
If you don't find me Hugo Strange
and get me cured,

302
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,032
I am going to crush
your windpipe like a beer can.

303
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,109
Shh!

304
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:50,072
- Did you just shush me?
- Shush! I sense an opportunity here.

305
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,623
<i>...live to Jennifer Glory.</i>

306
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,326
<i>In a twist that Jerome Valeska
himself could've thought of,</i>

307
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,003
<i>the GCPD are laying siege
to Central Precinct,</i>

308
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,878
<i>while Valeska's followers hold a wake
for their deceased role model.</i>

309
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,876
How is that an opportunity?

310
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,589
Confusion is always an opportunity
for the clearheaded.

311
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:11,143
Someone is showing their cards, Butch.
Let's go take a peek.

312
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:27,610
One to the east, one to the west.
Let's go.

313
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,287
- Is he talkin' yet?
- I don't know, let's check.

314
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,077
Long live Jerome!

315
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,450
All right.
One more time, sunshine.

316
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,706
Did Jerome leave
any other instructions?

317
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,083
I'll never...

318
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:43,630
Harvey! Harvey! Reporters, buddy.

319
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,262
All right, look,
this is how it's going to go.

320
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,216
You're going to start talking,

321
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,723
or I'm gonna stop caring
whether you can talk, you got it?

322
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,557
I'll talk!

323
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:04,025
It's too late, anyways.
They're already dead.

324
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,321
Who? Who's dead?

325
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,447
Jeremiah and Bruce Wayne.

326
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,447
- You think he's tellin' the truth?
- I'm gonna find out.

327
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:17,205
They're at Jeremiah's bunker.
You hold down the fort here?

328
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,168
Long live Jerome!

329
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,636
- Trouble, Mr. Riddler?
- A complication, yes.

330
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,518
Hostiles take over the station.

331
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,639
Police will remove the prisoners.
Where are they?

332
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:46,897
Oh, yes. This might be
easier than I expected.

333
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,659
The Riddler! We're saved!

334
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,490
How did you get out?

335
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,408
Through the old service door.

336
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:02,879
The old service door.

337
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:05,332
- What do we do, now?
- Now we improvise.

338
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:06,792
They're going to use
teargas in here soon.

339
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:11,005
I have to get in first.
We need a costume shop. Quick!

340
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,473
Penguin! We're saved!

341
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,689
- That one.
- Jerome...

342
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,641
No, not the trunk...

343
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,612
You ever get tired of being wrong?

344
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,404
Jeremiah!

345
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,780
We need to leave! It's not safe!

346
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,866
You believe me now?

347
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,034
Jerome's alive!

348
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:26,417
No, his followers dug him up.
They're sick!

349
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:30,508
They're also dangerous,
and they might be nearby!

350
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,462
How can I trust you
if you won't believe me?

351
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,432
You can trust me
because I'm your friend.

352
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:45,356
I want you to be my friend, Bruce.

353
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:48,394
You don't know what it was like,

354
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:52,982
living underground all those years.

355
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:57,953
Then you came along and offered me
everything I could dream of.

356
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:01,122
Because I believe in you, Jeremiah.

357
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,450
We're gonna do
great things for Gotham.

358
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:08,414
We could. We really could.

359
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,088
I thought we would.

360
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,215
There's no reason to stop thinking that.

361
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,297
All we have to do, is get out of here.

362
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:24,976
First, all we had to do
was come to the cemetery.

363
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,979
Now all we have to do is leave?

364
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,728
See, that's very confusing to me.

365
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:36,533
So, tell me again, Bruce,

366
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,156
why'd you really bring me here?

367
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,326
I thought it would help.

368
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,157
I was wrong. But we need to leave.

369
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,704
What the hell are you doing?

370
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,035
You think I didn't know
what was happening

371
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,792
from the moment
you suggested coming here?

372
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:54,126
- Jeremiah, what are you talking...
- Stop pretending to be my friend!

373
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,010
I know what's really happening.

374
00:25:56,096 --> 00:26:02,309
You can fool everyone else,
but I know you made a switch.

375
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,727
That, you can't hide.

376
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:08,348
Not even behind
that new face of yours.

377
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,937
I know it's you.

378
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:16,023
I know it's you, Jerome.

379
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,656
Jeremiah, give me the gun.

380
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,204
Turn around, brother.

381
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:29,537
I said turn around!
You killed my friend Bruce.

382
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,956
Now it's time
to put you back in your grave.

383
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:35,549
Walk!

384
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,889
Ed!

385
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:41,116
Bruce? Jeremiah?

386
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:19,688
Just a little bit further, brother.
Then you'll be back in your grave.

387
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,864
You're stronger than this, Jeremiah.

388
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:24,154
You know these ideas
are just the insanity gas talking.

389
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:27,954
I won't let your lies
fool me any longer!

390
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,785
What is happening?

391
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:40,129
<i>- Hiya, Jimbo!</i>
- Jerome...

392
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:41,292
<i>Ah!</i>

393
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,427
<i>Don't bother talkin' to me.</i>

394
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:48,679
<i>This is a recorded message, and plus,
I'm still dead.</i>

395
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,681
<i>Just more posthumous fun.</i>

396
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:55,607
<i>Look, I knew you'd see through
all those shenanigans at the station.</i>

397
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:59,440
<i>I've given all my fans
a script for them to follow.</i>

398
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:01,775
<i>See,</i>

399
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:06,158
<i>I wanted to bring you here.</i>

400
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:07,235
<i>Oh!</i>

401
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,873
Now do you believe
I'm not your brother?

402
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:21,503
Jeremiah, listen to me!

403
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,964
Jerome's followers are doing this!

404
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,136
Nothing else makes sense.

405
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:30,183
He sent them instructions
to torment you.

406
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,261
How fake.

407
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:35,563
Yes, I can see quite clearly
where you cut off poor Bruce's face,

408
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:36,935
and stitched on your own.

409
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:40,777
But I am a man of science.

410
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,741
So, let's have some evidence, huh?

411
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,321
<i>Oh!</i>

412
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,907
<i>Don't mind her.</i>

413
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:58,086
<i>She's just here to make sure
there's no talking during the movie.</i>

414
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,539
<i>And, trust me,
you're gonna wanna pay attention,</i>

415
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:05,217
<i>so the twist makes sense at the end.</i>

416
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,108
Let's go, brother.
Let's pull off that grotesque facade.

417
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,386
Ecco.

418
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:14,241
<i>I tell you,</i>

419
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:17,411
<i>suicide really takes it out of a guy.</i>

420
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,752
<i>What is this?</i>

421
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:39,975
Jeremiah! Do not
let him turn you into him!

422
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:44,730
Do not let Jerome win this battle!

423
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,483
Jerome, beat me? That'll be the day.

424
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:49,989
No!

425
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,119
Long live Jerome!

426
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:59,158
- Long live Jerome!
- Long live Jerome!

427
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,493
Jerome is victorious at last!

428
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,922
Jerome victorious?

429
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,767
Are you serious?

430
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,263
He's dead.

431
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:25,934
Haven't you been paying attention?

432
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,452
<i>Thank God I'm done with that.</i>

433
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,891
I am the one who's victorious.

434
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,812
<i>Jerome is dead.</i>

435
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,392
<i>Is dead... Is dead.</i>

436
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:06,899
<i>Long live... Long live me.</i>

437
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:11,400
<i>Long live me.</i>

438
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,456
Look, Bruce,

439
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:28,789
like everything Jerome set his mind to,
his insanity gas failed.

440
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:32,967
Other than some
mild cosmetic effects,

441
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:36,046
he might as well have
sprayed me with water.

442
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:39,966
You all need to see Jerome
for the utter dud that he was.

443
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:44,054
So, I donned the mask of madness

444
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:49,984
to show you how feeble that is
compared to actual greatness.

445
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:57,701
Behold, the face of true sanity.

446
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:01,154
But looks aren't everything.

447
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:06,368
I have a compendium
of Jerome's obsessions and goals.

448
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:10,083
I will outdo every one of them.

449
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:16,294
Jerome wanted to turn Gotham
into a madhouse.

450
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,218
But to truly build something,

451
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:24,768
you must first tear down
what is already there.

452
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:28,390
<i>I apologize for the deception, Jim.</i>

453
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,099
<i>I needed to ape Jerome</i>

454
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,105
<i>in order to persuade
his followers to throw that</i>

455
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,903
<i>macabre celebration
at your police station.</i>

456
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:40,781
<i>They are a pathetic lot,
but not without their uses.</i>

457
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:48,960
<i>Sidebar, that is
a self-perpetuating generator.</i>

458
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:52,459
<i>It can store
a phenomenal amount of energy.</i>

459
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:57,461
<i>I would hate to be within a mile of it
if it were to overload.</i>

460
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:03,140
<i>Jeremiah, the gas worked.</i>

461
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:08,646
Think about it. You want to carry out
Jerome's crazy plans sanely?

462
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:11,475
- What could be madder than that?
- "Madder"?

463
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:13,776
Let's see.

464
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,069
Ah, here, for example.

465
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,152
Jerome wanted to slather you in honey,

466
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:22,360
and have you eaten alive
by corpse beetles.

467
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,907
Now, that's mad.

468
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,037
Me, if I wanna kill you,
I'll just do it.

469
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,578
I'll shoot you in the head.

470
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,334
Simply and sanely.

471
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,711
Jeremiah...

472
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,843
But I don't want to kill you.

473
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:46,805
Are you gonna listen,
or are you gonna behave like children?

474
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:51,685
See, I don't want to kill you,
because I wanna show you

475
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,687
how much I've changed things.

476
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,693
How much we've changed things.

477
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,988
Because I could not have done
any of this

478
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,116
without your help.

479
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,778
My help?

480
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,322
<i>That sound you are hearing,</i>

481
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,915
<i>that is a very bad sound.</i>

482
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,710
<i>One which, I'm afraid,</i>

483
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,134
<i>makes you something
of a guinea pig, Jim.</i>

484
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,177
<i>I feel very indebted to you, Bruce.</i>

485
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:28,222
See, those generators
that we built with your money,

486
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,852
they work even better as bombs.

487
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,357
<i>Killing you will help secure
the loyalty of Jerome's minions.</i>

488
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,400
<i>And, well...</i>

489
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,570
<i>That is that.</i>

490
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,444
<i>Goodbye.</i>

491
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,653
All right, everybody, listen up!
You know what to do!

492
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,738
Let's go get our house back!

493
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,272
That's one down.

494
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,975
Jim Gordon is dead.

495
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,529
- No! No!
- Yes, Bruce.

496
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:25,445
Sorry, but progress requires sacrifice.

497
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,196
I'm going to stop you.

498
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:32,078
I really hope you don't try.
I would hate to have to kill you.

499
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,952
In fact, I can honestly say,

500
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:41,166
you are my very best friend.

501
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,409
What I want to know,

502
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:12,830
with a minimum of fuss,

503
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:17,286
is what you and your cohort
were really up to today?

504
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,209
I'll never betray the memory of...

505
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,086
Wouldn't dream of it.

506
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:28,968
I don't expect you to betray
the memory of that old corpse.

507
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:34,223
I want you to betray whomever it is
you are currently following.

508
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,974
- Long live Jerome.
- He's not talking.

509
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,275
Is that so?

510
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,438
You starin' at me?

511
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,610
Yeah, I get it.

512
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:56,783
Sometimes, I accidentally catch
a glimpse of myself in the mirror.

513
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:00,961
It scares me, too.
And then I get angry.

514
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:07,923
The longer I'm like this,
the angrier I get.

515
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:11,927
And right now, the way I see it,

516
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,509
you are preventing me
from finding a cure.

517
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:18,888
And that

518
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:24,068
makes me very, very angry.

519
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:30,150
Is your plan to gain his sympathy
by reciting your tale of woe?

520
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:35,409
Nah. Just wanted to see if I could get
him to pee his pants a little in terror.

521
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,872
You want me to shove some chicken bones
up his nose till he squawks?

522
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,625
- Yes, that will do.
- No.

523
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,414
Let's make this quick.

524
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,170
- Tilt your head back.
- No!

525
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:51,220
- Here comes the wishbone train!
- No, no!

526
00:39:55,935 --> 00:40:00,396
Smartest man in Gotham,
and you let your heart do the thinking.

527
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,431
Wake up, Ed!

528
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:03,682
Ow!

529
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,270
- Were you awake the whole time?
- Maybe.

530
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,279
"The smartest man in Gotham," huh?

531
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:12,574
All right, get up. Up, up, up.

532
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,492
There are better things
to aspire to, you know.

533
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,952
I'm aspiring to them very much.

534
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,204
Just be yourself.

535
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,036
The guy who can let go
of the past and change,

536
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,000
I like that guy.

537
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,962
All right, now, how are we going
to get past these psychos?

538
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:30,384
I'm assuming you brought
one of those for me?

539
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,796
No. I'd be into that,
but they only had one.

540
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,256
Instead...

541
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,515
- The cavalry should be coming very soon.
- Great.

542
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,327
Round them up!

543
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:17,181
Move, move, move! Let's go!

544
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,850
Okay.

545
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:39,870
Don't just wrap me
around your finger, Lee.

546
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:42,573
Come on, let's run.

547
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,588
That's for takin' a leak on my desk.

548
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,336
What a mess.

549
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,420
You know, it's funny,

550
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,302
it kind of reminds me of
my first apartment in Crown Point.

551
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:00,470
How long ago was that?

552
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:03,727
- I still live there.
- Harvey.

553
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,062
I found the epicenter of that explosion.

554
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,316
It's Jeremiah's bunker.

555
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,518
That's where Jim
was going to look for Bruce.

556
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:21,453
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Hey there, Mr. Valeska.

557
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,956
You alone,
or you got Mr. Wayne with you?

558
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,454
No Mr. Wayne.

559
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:30,879
But I'm not alone.

560
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:36,668
What the...

561
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:05,039
Look at these.
The gifts of true friendship.

562
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,875
Let's load them on the trucks.

563
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:13,585
It's time to give Gotham City
its new face.
