1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,360
Key of A, watch me for
the changes and try to keep up.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,960
Gideon and I have calculated
another Aberration in Bhopal, 1912.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,440
Why can't it be Aruba, 2016?

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,840
We are history's last line
of defense.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,040
I like the sound of that.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,720
Have you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,000
The Spear could alter reality itself.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,240
Changes to history
because timequakes and Aberrations,

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,800
which we can undo.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,840
Changes to reality,
those are permanent.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,720
You're on the run
because your time ended.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,680
Now something's chasing you,
trying to correct the Aberration.

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,800
One of history's worst monsters.

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,080
The Legion have the Spear of Destiny
and they're like gods now.

15
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,840
It appears that after
the Legion got the Spear

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,800
and change reality,
they kept us around as their pets.

17
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,240
You'll be forced to live your lives
in a reality that I created.

18
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,200
We go back in time to 1916
and we stop the Legion

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,520
from ever getting the Spear
of Destiny in the first place.

20
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,880
<i>Time</i>

21
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,120
All right, Gideon, try it now.

22
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,240
<i>All systems nominal, Captain.</i>

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,480
That's more like it.

24
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,200
Any luck in contacting
the rest of the team?

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,320
<i>Negative, but it stands to reason</i>

26
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,440
<i>that they would be facing challenges
of their own in this altered reality.</i>

27
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,200
Indeed. Which is why it falls to us
to rescue them.

28
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,040
Engines to full power.

29
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,960
Can you pinpoint our location,
Gideon?

30
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,000
<i>Central City, 2017.</i>

31
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,080
That's odd.

32
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,760
We must be in some sort of hangar.

33
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,920
One large enough
to accommodate the Waverider.

34
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,840
Gideon, what is that?

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,200
Is that another ship?

36
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,440
<i>Negative.
It appears to be a desk lamp.</i>

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,160
STAR

38
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,280
Oh, bollocks.

39
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,040
Right. Engage our cloak
and plot a course.

40
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,680
<i>Heading, Captain?</i>

41
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,200
<i>The nearest open window.</i>

42
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,200
Any luck?

43
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,680
You asked me that five minutes ago.

44
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,240
You know, it's not easy trying
to get a 21st century radio

45
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,080
to communicate
with a 22nd century time ship.

46
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,440
Thawne never told you
what he did with Rip?

47
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,000
No, we weren't close like that.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,160
How you holding up?

49
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,000
Better than Amaya.

50
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,000
I never knew about you guys.

51
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,640
It's nothing to know.

52
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,120
We were just,

53
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,480
you know, figuring it out.

54
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,000
I figured it out.

55
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,560
We've been assuming
that Waverider's broadcasting

56
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,800
using a quantum frequency, but...

57
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,640
But only if the quad band
antenna array was in alignment.

58
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,080
Ray, you are a genius.

59
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,720
I guess I am.
I kind of forgot what it was like.

60
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,160
So, can you communicate
with Rip or what?

61
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,560
<i>Sara? Sara, is that you?</i>

62
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,080
Good job, guys. Good job.

63
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,680
We didn't do anything yet.

64
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,440
- Rip?
<i>- Yes, Dr. Palmer,</i>

65
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,520
<i>I've honed in on your location.</i>

66
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, haul ass over here
and come pick us up.

67
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,640
<i>There may be one small problem
with that.</i>

68
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,720
Look, it's the teeny,
weenie Englishman.

69
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,440
Mr. Rory, will you please stop?

70
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,000
Relax.

71
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,520
Why would Thawne use
the Spear of Destiny to shrink you?

72
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,320
I don't believe he did.

73
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,240
I'm assuming that he used
Dr. Palmer's exosuit.

74
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,000
Oh, well, then,
he must still have it in his lab.

75
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,360
We gotta steal it back
and then we can unshrink the ship.

76
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,440
<i>And then what?</i>

77
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,680
Rip, we have a plan
to put reality back as it was.

78
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,200
But you're not gonna like it.

79
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,880
Okay, where to now?

80
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,360
I don't know.

81
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,880
I, I never exactly saw
my exosuit here.

82
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,600
I just figured,
where else would Thawne hide it?

83
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,960
All right, let's split up.

84
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,240
Ray.

85
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
Yes.

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,040
Oh, I have missed you.

87
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,000
Really, dude?

88
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,800
I will never, ever leave you again.

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,200
<i>Rip, we found the suit.</i>

90
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,600
You need to close in on our position

91
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,920
{\an5}before I have to watch Ray
do anymore weird stuff.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
En route.

93
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
Weird stuff?

94
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,040
Yeah, you got issues, dude.

95
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,920
{\an5}We got two more
rent-a-thugs down the hall.

96
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,000
I thought that Thawne

97
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,160
should've killed you morons
at the reactor.

98
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,240
Then I realized,

99
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,080
now I get to kill the Legends myself.

100
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,600
Gideon, fire.

101
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,040
Fire everything.

102
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,120
Isn't that adorable?

103
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,360
Is that the best you got?

104
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
How about this?

105
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,440
Sara, reinforcements
will be on their way.

106
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,120
We're heading to you, Ray.

107
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,880
Let's blow the roof off this place.

108
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,920
All right, Rip.

109
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,840
Keep the Waverider steady.

110
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,520
FRANCE 1916

111
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,280
<i>We have returned to the Battle
of the Somme in the year 1916.</i>

112
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,280
And apparently,
we're ready to destroy time itself

113
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,800
{\an5}by interfering in events
that we've already participated in.

114
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,240
{\an5}If that's what it takes
to save Amaya, count me in.

115
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,800
{\an5}Yeah, there's no way
I'm letting Grey go out

116
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,120
as one of Thawne's lackeys.

117
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,720
{\an5}We can't allow Doomworld
to continue no matter what the risk.

118
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,600
Okay. Well, look, like time,
reality needs to set.

119
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,880
Essentially, we're in a race.

120
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,120
Not against time,

121
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,880
{\an5}but from a reality
wave initiating from 2017.

122
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,240
All the more reason to get moving.

123
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,280
{\an5}At the very least,
we need to mitigate

124
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,120
the scope of the time paradox

125
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,560
{\an5}by avoiding contact
with our former selves at all costs.

126
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,160
So, all we have to do is help us.

127
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,360
{\an5}I mean, them,
destroy the Spear without them

128
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,000
knowing that we're helping.

129
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
Kind of like Secret Santa.

130
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,160
We already know
where the Blood of Christ is.

131
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,560
{\an5}So me, you and Ray,
we go back to the Church of Amiens,

132
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,000
and we leave the Blood
for our former selves to find.

133
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,360
I got a question.

134
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,960
{\an5}What happens to us when
our former selves destroy the Spear?

135
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,800
Well, we cease to exist.

136
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,320
{\an5}Because we never
would have existed

137
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,080
{\an5}if the Legion
hadn't gotten the Spear.

138
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,440
You're saying we're the Aberrations.

139
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,440
{\an5}In order to save the world,
we have to erase ourselves.

140
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,120
Listen.
Why don't we just go to Aruba,

141
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,760
get drunk, what?

142
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,480
Sunshine.

143
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,400
Mai tais.

144
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,480
Girls in bikinis.

145
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,600
All right, Ray. You're up.

146
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,680
<i>I'm on it.</i>

147
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
<i>Pardon me.</i>

148
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,680
<i>Excuse me.</i>

149
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,320
<i>Coming through.</i>

150
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,760
{\an5}Don't mind the tiny man flying
through the middle of no man's land.

151
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,200
{\an5}<i>I'm closing in on
the Blood's burial spot, Captain.</i>

152
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,680
I'm here.

153
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,680
{\an5}Well, that was easier
the second time around.

154
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,680
{\an5}I knew you idiots
would come back from 2017.

155
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,680
Apart from being incredibly stupid,
you are just so predictable.

156
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,160
Give me back the vial.

157
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
What vial?

158
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,880
Ray? Ray, get out of there.

159
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,040
You know,
my allies keep giving me the same,

160
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,120
simple piece of advice.

161
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,280
They were right.

162
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,240
I should've done that ages ago.

163
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
Hey, what are you doing?

164
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,440
You're gonna get yourself killed.

165
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,640
- We have to get him...
- Sara, you can't.

166
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,760
- Gideon...
- Sara!

167
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,920
Sara.

168
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
He's gone.

169
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,080
So what?

170
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,880
Haircut said it himself,

171
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,200
we're all Aberrations
living on borrowed time.

172
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,400
Besides, he's alive and well in 1916.

173
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,600
Mick's right.

174
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,560
The mission hasn't changed.

175
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,000
Except we can't destroy the Spear

176
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,360
because we don't have
the Blood of Christ.

177
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,080
So, we steal the spear
and get it out of 1916.

178
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,920
Now, you do realize that there's
a big problem with that plan, Sara.

179
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,280
The other us's have the Spear.

180
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,920
Oh, never stolen anything
from myself before.

181
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,120
Could be interesting.

182
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,800
Need I remind you

183
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,520
that we cannot interact
with ourselves.

184
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,480
Which is why the three of you

185
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,680
are gonna sneak
into the other Waverider

186
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,560
while the other
you's are at the church.

187
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,360
Now that, that sounds like a plan.

188
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,320
<i>I suggest you hurry.</i>

189
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,880
<i>Events are already in motion.</i>

190
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,280
<i>Mr. Rory's earlier self is currently
being contacted by Mr. Snart.</i>

191
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,320
All right, if we're gonna
go impersonating ourselves.

192
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,760
You're gonna need a haircut.

193
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
Yeah.

194
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
Not for nothing,

195
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,840
but Aruba would've
been a better option.

196
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,200
You're not real.

197
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,120
You're an illumination.

198
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,920
A hallucination.

199
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,720
Yeah, that's it.

200
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,600
Now, did that feel like
a hallucination?

201
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,560
And how was the reunion?

202
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,400
I'm gonna let him,
spin out for a bit,

203
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,840
then go in for the kill, so to speak.

204
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,080
- Gentlemen.
- What the hell is going on here?

205
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,400
That's what I was gonna ask.

206
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,800
Aren't you supposed to be searching
for the Kalabros Manuscript?

207
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,240
- I was.
- And I found him

208
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,360
and I brought him here.

209
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,320
We no longer need the Manuscript.

210
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,600
We have a different problem.

211
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,240
- The Legends are here.
- We know.

212
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,440
I just punched Mick.

213
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,200
Not those Legends.

214
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,600
And I'm not your Eobard.

215
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,840
- I'm from the future.
- Yeah, what else is new?

216
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,160
I mean, your future.

217
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,160
One where we have
the Spear of Destiny.

218
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,760
And the Legends from that future
are here now, too.

219
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,560
Wait, there are two sets of Legends?

220
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,200
When do I get to rob a bank?

221
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,880
Just deal with them.

222
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,560
Where do you think you're going?

223
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,680
To get backup.

224
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,720
I hate when he does that.

225
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,320
You know what to do.

226
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,960
We'll hang back and make sure
everybody sticks to the script.

227
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,560
Okay, I figure we got about

228
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,920
- an hour before we...
- Shut up, pretty.

229
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,800
I'm calling the shots. I'm the thief.

230
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,680
Englishman, disable Gideon.

231
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,720
We can't risk her blowing our cover.

232
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,080
You round up everyone in the library.

233
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,960
Make sure the coast is clear.

234
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,640
Then I can snatch the item.

235
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,240
You know what?

236
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,960
This is gonna be a piece of cake.

237
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,040
Hey.

238
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,320
What are you guys doing?
You just left for the church.

239
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,480
So we did. And now we're back.

240
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,800
The church was a dead end,
I'm afraid.

241
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,080
Where's Ray?

242
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,040
He is returning Lieutenant Tolkien
to the field hospital.

243
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,560
You guys all right?

244
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Yeah.

245
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,840
- I'm just seeing double.
- Yeah, we're fine. We're fine.

246
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,200
I just need to get to the library,
so I can, you know,

247
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
locate Christ's blood.

248
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,800
I need to run some repairs on Gideon.

249
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,120
Yeah, and I need to get
the Spear a beer.

250
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,680
Yeah, well,
as long as we get it first.

251
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,920
Are you not supposed to be
guarding the Spear of Destiny?

252
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Mr. Rory offered to spell me.

253
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,920
I thought you and Lieutenant Tolkien
were going to the Church at Amiens.

254
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,400
Yeah, that didn't work out.

255
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,640
But I did happen to find the...

256
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,400
Nate.

257
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,760
I, I, I was just saying that I...

258
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,280
believe I found
the final resting place

259
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,360
of Sir Gawain.

260
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,000
So, do you wanna tell us?

261
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,280
Tell you?

262
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,240
Are you feeling all right?

263
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,720
You look like you've seen a ghost.

264
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,320
No, yeah, no. I'm, I'm fine.
Yeah, sorry, I.

265
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,080
I think the location of Gawain and,
you know,

266
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,640
the Blood of Christ is in the...

267
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,800
GALAPAGOS ECUADOR PERU

268
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,120
Galapagos Islands.

269
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,200
The Blood of Christ
is in the Galapagos Islands?

270
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,560
Yeah.

271
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,120
In 1984.

272
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,880
How could a relic
from the Crusades wind up

273
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,920
in the Galapagos
during the Reagan Administration?

274
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,040
Perhaps Gideon can help.

275
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Gideon?

276
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,880
Oh, no. Where's Gideon?

277
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,200
I'm gonna go and check on her.

278
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,480
I'll come with you.

279
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,400
Why are you looking at me like that?

280
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,040
What's going on?

281
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,960
I miss you so much.

282
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,200
You've been gone for five minutes.

283
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,480
I got it.

284
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,840
Where's pretty?

285
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,440
Away team, what's your status?

286
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,000
<i>We have the Spear,
but Dr. Heywood is running behind.</i>

287
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,440
What the hell is he doing?

288
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,080
Where the hell have you been?

289
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,080
I'm, I'm sorry.
I just got, I got distracted.

290
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,440
We gotta get out of here.

291
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,560
<i>Negative.</i>

292
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,000
We got a new problem.

293
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,840
Your old selves are back.

294
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,120
Hang on. You mean that
we've returned from the church?

295
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,640
Yes, and if you come out
of the ship now,

296
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,120
they'll see you
and wreck time itself.

297
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,160
<i>You're trapped in there.</i>

298
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Good one.

299
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,880
We have to stop them
from getting to the ship.

300
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,080
Guys.

301
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,720
We have a new problem.

302
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,760
The ship, it's broken.

303
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,920
Well, what Sara means
is there's a radiation leak.

304
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,560
- Radiation leak?
- Yes, and it's very dangerous,

305
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,760
so we need to keep our distance.

306
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,840
If you could just follow me this way.

307
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,920
Wait, where's Amaya?

308
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,480
She's safe.

309
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,440
We got everyone off
of the ship right away.

310
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,680
Except Grey, who's working on
fixing the ship right now.

311
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,080
I thought you said
it was too dangerous to be on board.

312
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,920
What's a little radiation
for one half of Firestorm?

313
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,520
I assumed we'd be on our way
to 1984 by now.

314
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,640
Yeah, Rip took Gideon offline.

315
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
Said something
about an efficiency scan,

316
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,320
- which should've been done by now.
- How strange.

317
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,640
Yeah, like how Nate
was acting in the library.

318
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,400
Shouldn't Raymond be back

319
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,320
from returning Tolkien
to his regiment?

320
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,600
Ray. What's your 20?

321
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,960
I'm standing right in front of you.

322
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,360
Ray, listen to me,
whoever that is, she's an imposter.

323
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,560
<i>Take her out.</i>

324
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,160
What about the other Jax?

325
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,080
Whoa, whoa, wait.
There's a fake version of me, too?

326
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,600
- Yeah.
- <i>Ray, whoever this bozo is,</i>

327
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
kick his ass.

328
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,400
With pleasure.

329
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,760
Okay.

330
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,480
Sorry, Sara.

331
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,560
For what?

332
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,040
Listening to you.

333
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,840
Just chill out, bro.

334
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,040
What are you doing?
We're not imposters.

335
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,120
This is madness.

336
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,720
What has come over you people?

337
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,960
If you would...

338
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,120
-Oh, Ray.
-Just...

339
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,920
Let me explain.

340
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,960
If fake me is anything like real me,
Ray's gonna need some help.

341
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,720
Copy that, Captain.

342
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,760
Enough waiting,
we gotta get out of here.

343
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,680
We can't. Our prior selves
our out there right now.

344
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,080
If we leave, they'll see us.

345
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,280
Then don't go.

346
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,360
Mr. Jackson, I can explain.

347
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,760
That you're the Legion in disguise?

348
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,400
Yeah, I know.

349
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,720
Thawne's face changing technology
is incredible.

350
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,440
Hang on.

351
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,920
I don't think she's an imposter.

352
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,960
This is the genuine Ms. Lance
and Mr. Jackson.

353
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,760
What?

354
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,440
But you told us never
to revisit our past.

355
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,080
Why would they do that?

356
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,240
You'll have to ask them that.

357
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,200
They almost made it off
the ship with this.

358
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,960
All right. Who's wearing whose faces?

359
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,280
We are not the Legion.

360
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,560
Believe it or not, we are actually
future iterations of yourselves

361
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,120
who've traveled back in time
to prevent some form of calamity.

362
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,320
I don't believe it.

363
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,000
Why would Rip Hunter break
the first rule of time travel?

364
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,360
I'm asking myself
the very same question.

365
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,360
Oh, bollocks.

366
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,040
What the hell was that?

367
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,360
It's a timequake.

368
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,560
The result of us interacting
with ourselves.

369
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,320
- Well, that wasn't so bad.
- Yeah, give it time.

370
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,800
Whose bright idea
was it to do the one thing

371
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,960
that could jeopardize all of time?

372
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
Yours.

373
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,760
What the hell are you staring at?

374
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,560
Just imagining
what you'd look like without teeth.

375
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,000
- Knock it off, Rory.
- Knock it off, Rory.

376
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,560
I can't believe that even
we would do anything so foolish,

377
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,280
unless something went terribly wrong
the first time you were here.

378
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,200
I can't help, but notice...

379
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,320
Not all of us came back with you.

380
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,480
What happens to us in the future?

381
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,920
Well...

382
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,520
dead, dead, good as dead.

383
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,800
Look, the Spear ended up
in the Legion's hands.

384
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,560
Bad things happened and it sucked.

385
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,960
But if we prevent the Legion

386
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,960
from ever getting the Spear
in the first place,

387
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,400
everything goes back to normal
and you all get to live.

388
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,560
- Where are you going?
- To think.

389
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,680
Perhaps you should go with her.

390
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,240
Two heads are better than one.

391
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yeah.

392
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,760
In the future you're from,
the Legion gets the Spear.

393
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Yes.

394
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,000
So this is my fault.

395
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,560
It's more of a team effort, really.

396
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,760
Can I ask you a question?

397
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,000
Do you wish you would have used it?

398
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,680
- No.
- But you could've stopped

399
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,760
all of this.

400
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,920
You could've erased
the Legion of Doom from existence.

401
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,640
You could have kept your team alive.

402
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,600
You know why I, we can't use it.

403
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,680
The Spear...

404
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,760
it draws on our desires,
our weaknesses,

405
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,760
our hatred.

406
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,400
Our darkness.

407
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,280
We're not strong enough to wield it.

408
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,920
The spear is a weapon.

409
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,920
And you know what we do with weapons.

410
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,120
Doing some light reading on Zembezi,
I see.

411
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What do you want?

412
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,040
I came here to drop
some future knowledge on you.

413
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,800
You need to do yourself a favor

414
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,600
and stop being
the ambassador of chill

415
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,360
and tell Amaya
how you feel about her.

416
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,040
Okay. How do I feel about her?

417
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,640
You're in love with her.

418
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,760
Look, I...

419
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,680
I really, really like Amaya.

420
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,240
I saw Leonard Snart
put a gun to her head and kill her.

421
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,040
I watched Amaya die.

422
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,480
I lost her forever.

423
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,800
You understand me?

424
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,640
What do you want me to do?

425
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,840
We all wanna change the future.

426
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,240
I'm not talking about the future.

427
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,320
I'm talking about changing
who you are now.

428
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,360
I want you to do the things
I wish I would've done

429
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,200
instead of the things
I wish I would've said.

430
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,240
You wanna know why?

431
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,960
Because there's nothing,

432
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,040
nothing worse than looking back
at your life with regret.

433
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,000
Yep. Still weird.

434
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,240
Please tell me you two have figured
a way out of this mess.

435
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,920
Clearly not.

436
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,280
- Was that another timequake?
- I don't think so.

437
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,360
Someone's firing at us.

438
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,520
<i>Captain,
our shields are nearly depleted.</i>

439
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,600
-Copy that.
-Copy that.

440
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,920
-Sorry, habit.
-Sorry, habit.

441
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,360
That was a bit powerful
for World War I air artillery.

442
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,040
That would explain it.

443
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,760
The ship's taking too much damage.

444
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,160
We gotta make a time jump.

445
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,120
I really would not recommend that.

446
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,680
- Out of my way.
- Hey, that's my seat.

447
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,520
- Traveling through time
- Yes.

448
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
with ourselves

449
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,680
could create a paradox
exponentially larger

450
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,680
than the one we have already created.

451
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,320
- What do you think?
- That we have to do

452
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,880
whatever it takes to keep
the Spear out of the Legion's hands.

453
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,440
Hold on.

454
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,200
What's going on?

455
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,720
It's the result of us interacting
with our previous selves.

456
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,080
It's a time-storm.

457
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,000
We're still in World War I.

458
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,240
-Gideon, get us out of here.
-Gideon, get us out of here.

459
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,400
<i>Negative, Captains.</i>

460
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,360
<i>The ship has sustained
critical damage.</i>

461
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,560
Well, good news.

462
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,320
The time-storm seems to have caused
a temporary ceasefire.

463
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,320
The bad news is the Legion
of Doom's still trying to kill us.

464
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,000
Wait, how far do you even think
we'll be able to make it out there?

465
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,600
You only have to make it as far
as the other Waverider.

466
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,240
You want us to time jump
together again?

467
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,280
You saw what just happened.

468
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,200
We won't be time jumping together.

469
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,280
You're not coming with us.

470
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,880
This has always been
a one-way ticket for us.

471
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,640
Your team has to get the Spear
of Destiny away from here.

472
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,960
We won't fail you guys.

473
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,160
Guys, we've got company.

474
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,240
I see them.

475
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,880
Everybody clear on the plan?

476
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,200
Run like hell.

477
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,560
Try not to die.

478
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,040
What about you guys?

479
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,440
You ready?

480
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,160
Other than the fact that
I can't Firestorm

481
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,240
and Nate can't Steel?

482
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,360
You bet your sweet ass we're ready.

483
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,240
- Damn it.
- Damien,

484
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,840
I think we should go back to basics.

485
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,040
Yeah, you're right.

486
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,720
Killing's gotten so gosh darn
impersonal lately.

487
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,880
No!

488
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
No.

489
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,960
Jefferson, no, please. Please.

490
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,200
Grey.

491
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,920
Come on, Grey.

492
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,240
Come on, come on.

493
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,440
Let him go, Mick.

494
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,480
I'm not listening to you anymore.

495
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,760
Come on, is that any way
to talk to your old partner?

496
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,360
I don't have a partner.

497
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,840
I have a team.

498
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,400
Yeah, Darhk said you'd gone soft.

499
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,440
Let me fix that for you.

500
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,040
Mick, no.

501
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,960
No.

502
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,120
What's your problem?

503
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,400
You're, you're alive.

504
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,800
You hug me, I'll kill you.

505
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,840
Okay.

506
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,080
Later.

507
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,000
Hey. The Waverider's just around.

508
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,120
I thought you were made of steel.

509
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,120
No.

510
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,640
Get this in the ship.

511
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,640
Oh, I've been waiting for this.

512
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,760
What are you waiting for?

513
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,600
Do it.

514
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,840
Death would be too kind.

515
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,560
Nice work.

516
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,680
Both of you.

517
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,880
Where's the Spear?

518
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,040
You took it to the rendezvous point.

519
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,520
Oh, did I? Right.

520
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,320
If you don't wanna get stuck in 1916,
get to the ship now.

521
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,840
<i>That means you, Amaya.</i>

522
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,280
Nathaniel.

523
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,880
Don't be a douche.

524
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,560
Excuse me?

525
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,680
I won't, bro.

526
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,760
I can't believe we made it.

527
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,240
Don't jinx it.

528
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,240
He jinxed it.

529
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,800
I hate that guy.

530
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,840
Not that guy.

531
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,720
These guys.

532
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,000
You traveled back in time
to help yourselves,

533
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,600
I figured I could do the same.

534
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,200
You know, it's true what they say.

535
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,320
If you want something done right,
you really have to do it yourself.

536
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,320
Give me the Spear
and I'll spare your team.

537
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,480
You can go to hell.

538
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,920
No, but I'll make a hell for you.

539
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,320
Do you really wanna lose another one?

540
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,120
Last chance.

541
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,360
Use the Spear.

542
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,440
<i>B'khi-eel.</i>

543
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,760
<i>Ah-ash-lem-tu-on.</i>

544
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,600
<i>K'i-aheen. Kh'det Bay-all-ma-ah.</i>

545
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,120
It can't be me. Use it.

546
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,440
Fix the world.

547
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,760
- Just do it, Sara.
- Look, I can't.

548
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,280
There's too much darkness
inside of me.

549
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,600
I can't control it.

550
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,520
I believe in you.

551
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,680
You're stronger than you know.

552
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,240
Well, the cork broke off,
but I think I managed to salvage it.

553
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,760
Here.

554
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,520
To doing movie night more often.

555
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,520
This never happened.

556
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,280
This is the Spear doing this.

557
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,600
This isn't real.

558
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,560
No, it's not,

559
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,600
but it can be.

560
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,600
You can remake reality,
however you see fit.

561
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,600
You were always the better of us,
Laurel.

562
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,840
You were the strong one.

563
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,120
I'm damaged.

564
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,320
I know.

565
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:06,440
The Gambit, Lian Yu,
League of Assassins, you dying.

566
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,200
I could take it all back.

567
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,960
But you won't.

568
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,960
Everything...

569
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,440
that has happened to me...

570
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,680
All the suffering that I endured,

571
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,320
it's all led to this moment,
hasn't it?

572
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,040
The Spear doesn't need
someone pure of heart.

573
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,320
It needs someone strong enough
to do the right thing.

574
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,080
Sara, it needs you.

575
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,200
Even if doing the right thing...

576
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,480
means not having you back?

577
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,880
I'm never too far away.

578
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I love you.

579
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,920
I love you, too.

580
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,040
Too slow, Ms. Lance.

581
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,120
Far too slow.

582
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:18,400
To think you had actual godhood
literally in your grasp.

583
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,520
Well, I'm not going to make
the mistake I made the first time.

584
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,320
I'm going to erase you all
from existence.

585
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,600
You won't even be dead.

586
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,080
<i>B'khi- eel. Ah-ash-lem-tu-on.</i>

587
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,720
<i>K'i-aheen. Kh'det Bay-all-ma-ah.</i>

588
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,640
I may have made
one small change to reality.

589
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,200
You depowered the Spear.

590
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,680
Well, I guess we'll just have
to do this the old fashioned way.

591
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,520
I am going to drive this
through your heart.

592
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,400
Yeah. About that...

593
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,840
No.

594
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,240
You did it.

595
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,400
You would've done the same thing.

596
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,480
Remember, Legends never die.

597
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
Really?

598
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,760
- Goonies?
- What's a goonie?

599
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:47,160
All right, Malcolm is back in 2016,
where he belongs.

600
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,400
- In prison?
- No.

601
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,800
His crappy apartment.

602
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,960
And what are your plans
for the two of us?

603
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,680
We're dead in 2017, remember?

604
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,560
I'm not taking you back to 2017.

605
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,440
CENTRAL CITY 2014

606
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,880
Should've done this in France, Mick.

607
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,480
Could've saved us both a lot of time.

608
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,800
I didn't bring you here to kill you,
Leonard.

609
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,320
So what are we doing here?

610
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,800
This is where Thawne
recruited you for the Legion.

611
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,440
I'm gonna wipe your memory
and put you on the right path.

612
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,920
You mean the path
where I join up with some Brit twit

613
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,800
and die trying to save the world?

614
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,880
No, you die trying
to save your friends.

615
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,880
Still a death sentence.

616
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,280
You know what your punishment is,
Leonard?

617
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,160
You end up being a better man.

618
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,760
And so do I.

619
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,360
Better?

620
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,600
- You mean softer.
- No.

621
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,160
I mean, better.

622
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,560
All right,
so let me get this straight.

623
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,920
{\an5}In retaliation for me
helping kill your team,

624
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,960
bending reality and torturing you,

625
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,560
I'm to wear this ridiculous outfit
and shoes without socks?

626
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,200
Just setting things right.

627
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,440
You mean setting me on the path
to killing your sister.

628
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,000
I've already made that choice.

629
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,560
I'm okay with it.

630
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,680
And so is Laurel.

631
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,200
And how do you know that?

632
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,920
Hey, Gideon said we're going back
to 1942.

633
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,200
The mission's over.

634
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,440
The Legion's been put back
in their proper places

635
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,440
in the timeline, so,
now it's my turn.

636
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,120
Okay.

637
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,240
Well, if you don't mind, I'd like
to get off at that stop with you.

638
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,880
What?

639
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,920
Look, I lost you once already,

640
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,920
even though it was a different me
and a different you.

641
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,800
And I don't ever wanna do that again.

642
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,080
Or at all.

643
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,120
I don't know what to say.

644
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,000
Say, "Nate, come with me to 1942."

645
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,320
I can't say that, Nathaniel.

646
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,160
Because I don't want
to go back to 1942.

647
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,600
I know that I'm supposed to.

648
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,080
I know I have a destiny

649
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,520
and that we shouldn't damage time
any more than we already have,

650
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,480
but I have to believe
that time is stronger than that.

651
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,120
And that if I have a destiny,

652
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,920
it'll wait for me.

653
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,640
Hey, you going on a trip?

654
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,880
Yes, in fact.

655
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,760
I was joking.

656
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,520
Right. Yes, well,

657
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,880
we both know that I don't have
a sense of humor at times.

658
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,160
But yes, I am taking my leave.

659
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,160
What do you mean, "leave"?

660
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,280
This team has functioned far better
in my absence

661
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,200
than it ever did under my leadership.

662
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,200
You saved reality itself.

663
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,320
Well, you were there, too.

664
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,400
Yes, but I've realized that there's
nothing further for me to teach you.

665
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,440
Any of you.

666
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,560
So, what?
You're just gonna walk out of here

667
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,640
and not say good-bye?

668
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,760
I was going to borrow the jump ship,
actually.

669
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,640
I think Mick
would call that stealing.

670
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,440
Oh, yes. Well, maybe Mr. Rory
has had somewhat of an affect on me.

671
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,200
And you on me, Captain.

672
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,480
I'm no longer the captain.

673
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,120
You are.

674
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,920
And in that spirit...

675
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,680
permission to depart, Captain Lance.

676
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,240
Permission granted.

677
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,320
Stay out of trouble.

678
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,120
What, without you lot?

679
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,520
I think that'll actually be
quite easy.

680
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,040
Mick, you wanna do the honors?

681
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,200
Plot a course?

682
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,440
You earned it.

683
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,360
Gideon, set a course for Aruba.

684
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,800
<i>Roger that, Mr. Rory.</i>

685
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,520
<i>Setting a course for Aruba,
the year 2017.</i>

686
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,040
- What was that?
- This is what happens

687
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,240
when you put Mr. Rory
in charge of navigation.

688
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,000
<i>In fact, it was another time-storm.</i>

689
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,640
<i>It seems the disruption you created
in 1916 was just the start.</i>

690
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,400
We've been ejected out
of the Temporal Zone.

691
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,360
- Get ready for a hard landing.
- Oh, come on.

692
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,280
Can we please go five minutes
without crashing the Waverider?

693
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,240
Is everyone okay?

694
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,320
This ain't Aruba.

695
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,400
<i>No, this is Los Angeles, 2017.</i>

696
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,240
Oh, boy.

697
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,360
Guys.

698
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,920
I think we broke time.
