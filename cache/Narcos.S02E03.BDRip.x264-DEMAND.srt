1
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:25,622
<i>Pablo Escobar said...
Sometimes I'm God.</i>

2
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:29,389
<i>If I say a man dies,
he dies the same day.</i>

3
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:36,363
<i>In his career, this asshole
killed thousands of police officers</i>

4
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,167
<i>at a rate of over 400 a year.</i>

5
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:43,907
<i>With numbers like that staring you
in the face, you have to ask...</i>

6
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,905
<i>what possesses a man to put on
a uniform</i>

7
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:50,712
<i>that all but guarantees
his days are numbered?</i>

8
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,387
<i>Most of them were just kids,</i>

9
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,983
<i>raised to reach a fork in the road
and choose the right path.</i>

10
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:03,495
<i>Fight for the good guys.</i>

11
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,825
<i>They were young,
they were full of hope...</i>

12
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,828
<i>and they thought
they were invincible.</i>

13
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,874
WE LOVE YOU!

14
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:17,036
<i>And those that were left behind
would feel their loss the most.</i>

15
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:19,940
<i>Everybody's got a breaking point,</i>

16
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:23,210
<i>when shit sickens them so much
that they just have to act.</i>

17
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:29,716
<i>For Pinzón,
that breaking point meant resignation.</i>

18
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,755
Present arms!

19
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:37,057
<i>But there were those who couldn't resign,
who couldn't just walk away.</i>

20
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,623
<i>Presidents have breaking points too.</i>

21
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,265
<i>And Gaviria had finally found his.</i>

22
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:49,365
I am responsible
for the death of those men, Eduardo.

23
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:56,273
And if Escobar is using their deaths
to send me a message, then I will respond.

24
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,044
I agree completely.

25
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:01,485
We have to go in full force.

26
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:06,582
Keep in mind, bringing him back
won't be a popular decision.

27
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:11,322
But since when do we care
about being popular, huh?

28
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,408
Colonel Carrillo.

29
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,984
Yes, Mr. President.

30
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:16,981
Boss, they're all saying
they don't know anything.

31
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,983
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

32
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:23,579
You gentlemen are under the impression
that you work for the Moncadas.

33
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:28,356
Allow me to clarify.
You have never worked for the Moncadas.

34
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,624
You work for me,
and you have always worked for me.

35
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,824
- Blackie.
- Yes, boss.

36
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:36,198
Who gave Judy Moncada
the cash to buy this house?

37
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:37,270
You, Don Pablo.

38
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,532
- Jairo.
- Yes, Don Pablo.

39
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,835
The money that puts food on the table
for these men, where does it come from?

40
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:44,707
- From your pocket.
- Everything you see here is mine.

41
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:51,709
Everything you have
is because I allow you to have it.

42
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:59,120
Everything you think you are protecting,
you are protecting for me.

43
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,654
Are we clear on this?

44
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:09,161
You're going to tell me the location
of every safe house, every lab,

45
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,728
every office,
every account of the Moncadas.

46
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,033
And look...

47
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:17,908
that doesn't make you gentlemen traitors.

48
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,240
Certainly not.

49
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:28,215
You simply didn't know
who you were really working for.

50
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,419
So let's begin...

51
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,358
with what's most important.

52
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:42,691
You're going to tell me right now...

53
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:51,375
where that bitch Judy Moncada is hiding.

54
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,797
- Ms. Judy, welcome.
- Thank you.

55
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,696
Pardon me.

56
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,101
- Hey!
- Navegante!

57
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:21,469
- Watch yourself.
- Mrs. Moncada is our guest.

58
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,804
We treat our guests with respect.

59
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:27,410
Even the ones who invite themselves.

60
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:35,948
Listen, Pacho,
are you sure you have enough men?

61
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,650
One might get the impression
you're scared of someone.

62
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:46,125
Perhaps if you took security
more seriously...

63
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:50,801
just maybe your husband
would still be alive...

64
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,436
and you wouldn't be coming to us
for help.

65
00:07:55,642 --> 00:08:00,307
Listen to this guy.
Who told you I was coming here for help?

66
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:03,408
Where's your boss?

67
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,344
You mean my partner.

68
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:11,618
- Handling the business.
- Is that right?

69
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:15,423
Oh, so he's still trying to pretend
he isn't a drug trafficker?

70
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,693
Mrs. Moncada,
why don't you go look around?

71
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,666
I don't know, pet the horses.

72
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,866
Or rehearse whatever it is
you came to say.

73
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,973
Gilberto will be here shortly.

74
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,508
Thank you, Pacho.

75
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,017
- We're safe!
- Pass me the ball.

76
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,020
- Here you go.
- Here it is.

77
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,557
Ma'am? Here's what you asked for.

78
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:51,364
Who's that?

79
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,190
He's one of the new guys.

80
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,230
Excuse me.

81
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:08,213
POLICE STATION ATTACKED IN MEDELLIN

82
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,656
What a hideous painting.

83
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,120
What a lovely surprise.

84
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:53,454
- To what do we owe the pleasure?
- Business.

85
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:02,528
And one by one, the nights
between our separated cities,

86
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,594
they are added to the night
that unites us.

87
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:09,642
It's the middle of the fucking day,
Gilberto.

88
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,040
Not a fan of Neruda?

89
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:16,913
The only thing that unites us in this life
is a desire to see Pablo dead.

90
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,248
<i>This is Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela.</i>

91
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:22,880
<i>And if you've never heard of him,</i>

92
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,254
<i>it's because that's exactly
the way he wants it.</i>

93
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:28,784
<i>Ask him what he does for a living
and he'll tell you that he's a banker,</i>

94
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:30,420
<i>and that would be true.</i>

95
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:33,626
<i>In fact, he and his brother Miguel
controlled their own bank.</i>

96
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,634
<i>Or he might tell you that
he and his brother owned and operated</i>

97
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,433
<i>one of Colombia's largest chains
of drug stores.</i>

98
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:44,068
<i>The brothers could also tell you they ran
their own soccer team. Which they did.</i>

99
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,739
<i>América de Cali,
one of the best teams on the continent</i>

100
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:51,011
<i>and a fierce rival
of Pablo's Atlético Nacional.</i>

101
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:56,114
<i>But what they'd never tell you
is that these businesses were a front</i>

102
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,089
<i>and that the Rodriguez brothers</i>

103
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,957
<i>were the second biggest
cocaine traffickers in the world.</i>

104
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,186
<i>The leaders of the Cali cartel.</i>

105
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:07,358
<i>Like Pablo and the Medellín cartel,</i>

106
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:11,028
<i>they started out as run-of-the-mill
criminals, bank robbers.</i>

107
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,663
<i>And with all that money they scored
from their heists,</i>

108
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,299
<i>they quickly graduated to
smuggling weed.</i>

109
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:19,175
<i>And when they realized
that ten pounds of blow</i>

110
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,304
<i>was worth as much as
a ton of marijuana,</i>

111
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:24,316
<i>they jumped headfirst
into the cocaine business.</i>

112
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:27,285
<i>These guys were no piece of shit
street dealers.</i>

113
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:31,654
<i>They planned meticulously,
maximizing profit, minimizing risk.</i>

114
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:35,126
<i>And as the business grew,
a young ambitious Colombian kid,</i>

115
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:39,632
<i>a guy you might know named Pacho Herrera,
was such a good earner,</i>

116
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,498
<i>that the brothers eventually
promoted him to partner.</i>

117
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:47,162
<i>But they had a competitor,
and not just any competitor.</i>

118
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,904
<i>One that wasn't interested in abdicating
the throne as the king of coke.</i>

119
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,980
- Don Pablo.
<i>- But Gilberto was smart.</i>

120
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,038
<i>He didn't care that Escobar
wore the crown.</i>

121
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,082
Gentlemen.

122
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:00,744
<i>So they went to him with a proposal.
Miami, the cocaine capital of the world,</i>

123
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:04,915
<i>would remain Pablo's territory,
and in return, the Rodriguez brothers</i>

124
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:08,517
<i>would make do with a little territory
in the northeast called New York City.</i>

125
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:11,758
<i>The extra 1,089 miles may have made it</i>

126
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:15,494
<i>a little harder to get to,
but it turns out the folks in New York</i>

127
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,562
<i>were just as head over heels for cocaine
as the folks down south.</i>

128
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,573
<i>And while there were
1.8 million people in Miami,</i>

129
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,905
<i>there were seven million in New York City.</i>

130
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:29,543
<i>As much as the Cali guys loved money
and the finer things in life,</i>

131
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,710
<i>they hated the wrong kind of attention.</i>

132
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:36,278
<i>For the Gentlemen of Cali, it was about
appearing like legitimate businessmen.</i>

133
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:40,690
<i>And business was good. But that didn't
mean that it couldn't get better.</i>

134
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,861
So tell me, Mrs. Moncada,
why did you come all this way?

135
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:49,266
To help you kill the man
who murdered my husband and brother

136
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:52,964
by offering very important information
that only I possess.

137
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:56,269
- And what is this information?
- Targets.

138
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,606
The location of every one of his labs.

139
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:04,775
Going after Pablo's infrastructure
will cripple him, force him to surface.

140
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:09,822
When he does, we put a bullet in his head
and we take turns shitting on him.

141
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:13,654
What's valuable isn't knowing
what Pablo has,

142
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,819
but what he wants to acquire.

143
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,953
Because that's where he'll be next.

144
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:21,591
Pablo is picking apart your operation
piece by piece.

145
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:24,797
Knowing what remains
tells us where he's going.

146
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,674
You want me to tell you where my labs are?

147
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,914
Well, let's say...

148
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:43,086
that I share that information. Hmm?
What happens to my labs?

149
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,516
Oh, Judy.

150
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,356
Your sense of vengeance is heartwarming.

151
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:51,362
Kiko would be so proud of your priorities.

152
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,757
You're right.

153
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,793
He would be very proud of me.

154
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,829
I built the business by his side, Pacho.

155
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:05,275
I'm from the Medellín cartel.
I know what I am.

156
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:10,340
I don't need bullshit art
hanging on my wall to prove any different.

157
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,384
Wait, wait, wait.

158
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,046
Hold on.

159
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:21,688
Confronting Pablo directly
won't help us maintain a low profile.

160
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:23,686
But...

161
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:31,132
what if the Search Bloc were to learn
the location of your labs?

162
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,140
What good is it if he's arrested?

163
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:39,642
He's already shown
he can fuck us from prison.

164
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,079
This won't end with Pablo in a cell.

165
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,577
You think the police will kill him?

166
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:49,249
There is one officer
that seems particularly determined.

167
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,325
And President Gaviria
has arranged for his return.

168
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:56,386
<i>This was one thing that
the Cali guys and the DEA could agree on.</i>

169
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:59,727
<i>As controversial
as Colonel Carrillo's methods were,</i>

170
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,767
<i>he was the only guy
that Escobar was afraid of.</i>

171
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,894
<i>And returning command
of Search Bloc to him</i>

172
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,200
<i>was exactly what we needed.</i>

173
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:11,267
The president has offered us every
available resource to defeat Escobar.

174
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,368
All we have to do now
is manage it properly.

175
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,881
So I'm still gonna rely on
intelligence from you.

176
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:19,543
But we're gonna do things
a little bit differently.

177
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:23,453
No more large-scale operations. Search
Bloc goes back to small-scale tactics.

178
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:25,752
- Amen.
- Stealth operations, surprise raids,

179
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,952
that sort of thing. We change the game.

180
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:32,060
But there's one thing
that we need to do first. Trujillo.

181
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:36,893
Assemble the Search Bloc outside.
I want 100 men and six trucks.

182
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,768
- Tell them we're moving out. Got it?
- On it, Colonel.

183
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:46,036
A hundred men?
That's not exactly small-scale tactics.

184
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:49,814
First thing is,
we let Pablo know that we're back.

185
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,652
<i>Now you can bet that
the second a convoy of a hundred men</i>

186
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:01,159
<i>and six marked police trucks
leave that base,</i>

187
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,389
<i>that Escobar's army of spotters
would be burning up the phone lines</i>

188
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,058
<i>just to tell Escobar all about it.</i>

189
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,330
- What's up?
- They just left. Four motorcycles,

190
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:14,395
five pickups, and a truck.
It's a large convoy.

191
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,410
<i>And you'd be right.
But that was the point.</i>

192
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:22,113
<i>You see, these spotters
made it impossible for us to operate</i>

193
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,309
<i>in the secrecy we required.</i>

194
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,408
<i>So we needed to blind them.</i>

195
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:30,923
<i>And the first step to blinding someone
is getting them to open their eyes.</i>

196
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:35,455
They're heading to Barrio Escobar.
It's going to get crowded.

197
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,622
Probably this rooftop here.

198
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:40,667
<i>Once those signals went up,
we could pick them up,</i>

199
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,133
<i>get a fix and get a location
of each one.</i>

200
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,469
The convoy has arrived.

201
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:03,151
We're in position.

202
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,350
A MAN, A NEIGHBORHOOD, A COUNTRY!

203
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,725
<i>And I guess you could say
that the second part of Carrillo's plan</i>

204
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,822
<i>was to show Pablo
that the sheriff was back in town.</i>

205
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,870
<i>And he did that the best way he could.</i>

206
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:27,674
Look. Look up there.

207
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:31,149
There's something weird happening.
What do you see?

208
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,811
- They're clouds.
- No, not clouds.

209
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,685
Because clouds form shapes.

210
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:42,187
- What I see is a turtle.
- Boss!

211
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,720
- Excuse me. I need to talk to you.
- Keep looking.

212
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,867
Keep looking at the clouds.

213
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,933
Sir, sorry to interrupt,
but it's very important.

214
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:59,910
- What's going on?
- Carrillo is back.

215
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,711
And he's here in Medellín.

216
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,916
What else?

217
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:21,128
That son of a bitch
filled Barrio Escobar with police and...

218
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:25,134
he pissed on your mural, sir.

219
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:58,002
Those fucking cops
are going up 26th Street.

220
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,833
Copy that, brother. All good.

221
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:01,907
- We got 'em.
- Keeps going like that

222
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,604
until you reached Barrio Pablo Escobar.
We captured six radio transmissions.

223
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:08,477
But we haven't pinpointed
the exact location.

224
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:10,675
- No, sir.
- So our best bet

225
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:14,310
is to corner each of these buildings.
This time, we hit the ground.

226
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:20,748
Trujillo, load up
six unmarked cars, four men per car.

227
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,456
Instruct them to leave in 20-minute
intervals to avoid attention. Clear?

228
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,759
- Yes, Colonel.
- Okay.

229
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,595
Peña, you're with me.

230
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,762
Murphy, Jacoby, you stay here to guide us.

231
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,369
Careful out there.

232
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:51,791
Freeze! Don't move!

233
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:57,360
Relax. Everything's good.

234
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:58,988
What is this?

235
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:00,555
Piraña down.

236
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,964
Oh, we got one. Spotter One is down.

237
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,535
Son of a bitch.

238
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:15,013
Where are you going? Where are you going?!

239
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:19,917
Get him! Get him! Get him!

240
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,544
Don't move!

241
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:23,753
Don't move!

242
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,187
- Good evening.
- Yes?

243
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:28,716
Would you allow me to search your house?
We're looking for...

244
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,229
Stop! Stop, boy! Stop!

245
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,594
Get on the floor!

246
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,601
Show me your hands.

247
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,080
You think you're slick?
Why were you running?

248
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:55,711
- No! What did I do wrong?
- You tell me what you did.

249
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:24,709
Do you know who I am?

250
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,282
My name is Colonel Horacio Carrillo.

251
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:35,784
Last week,
30 police officers were murdered.

252
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:39,422
- Those pigs probably deserved it.
- Shut up, kid.

253
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,232
Many of them were my friends.

254
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:50,801
People perched on rooftops,
guiding murderers with radios...

255
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,639
are assassins themselves.

256
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:58,183
I hope after this encounter,
you'll reconsider

257
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:04,621
working with someone
who thinks he's above the law.

258
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:11,992
What? Am I supposed to
shit my pants in fear?

259
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,031
No.

260
00:22:21,207 --> 00:22:22,868
Do I make myself clear?

261
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:24,636
I want you to tell your friends,

262
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,112
that this is what happens
when you work for Pablo Escobar!

263
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,228
Take it.

264
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:54,700
Take it.

265
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,205
Tell them this is for Pablo.

266
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:11,153
Remember what you saw.

267
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:17,553
And know what will happen to you
if I see you on a rooftop.

268
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:19,392
You can leave.

269
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,331
Leave!

270
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:46,215
So, what book shall we read
before bed tonight?

271
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:47,885
The Witch.

272
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,689
No, my love. No scary stories.

273
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:52,356
The Witch? What's that? I don't know it.

274
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,025
Dad reads it to us. Right, Dad?

275
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,365
- The bad witch and the good witch, right?
- Yes.

276
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,405
Not The Witch, Pablo.

277
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,373
I don't want any more scary stories
in this house.

278
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:11,481
Love, take your sister
and brush your teeth.

279
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,278
And go straight to bed.

280
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:18,118
Listen, where's my kiss?

281
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,290
Good night.

282
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:24,387
- Good night, my love.
- Straight to bed, Manuela, please.

283
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:45,110
- I heard a scary story, Pablo.
- Tata.

284
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:48,613
The man who killed Gustavo
is back in Medellín.

285
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,149
Is that story true?

286
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,487
Yes.

287
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:01,997
Does that sound like the government
is trying to negotiate? Huh?

288
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:07,534
Good night.

289
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:20,214
Tata.

290
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,622
Someone has to tell you
how things are, Pablo.

291
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,855
That man is here to kill you.

292
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:04,394
I'm scared, Pablo.

293
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,759
I promise you one thing.

294
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:15,604
If things get out of hand
and I can't control it...

295
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,236
we'll leave the country.

296
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:23,106
Okay?

297
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,395
Javi, where are the fucking spotters?

298
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:43,299
Carrillo went a different way.
He... he cut them loose.

299
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,200
Oh, we're letting people go now?

300
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:48,063
Yeah, Murphy, we're letting people go.

301
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,735
And what does that mean?

302
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:53,972
- Don't worry about it, man.
- Hey, fucking talk to me.

303
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,810
- Let go of my fucking arm.
- What the fuck happened?

304
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,986
Carrillo put a gun to the kid's head
and he pulled the trigger.

305
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,588
To make a fucking point.

306
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:11,124
We good now?

307
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,292
Yeah, we're good.

308
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:27,837
- Have you seen this woman?
- No.

309
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,276
She works at the market.

310
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:34,181
Sweetheart?

311
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:39,916
- Are you sure?
- No.

312
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:52,627
Nobody's seen the bitch.

313
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,837
I'm pissed off, brother.

314
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:05,874
Let's go for some ice cream.

315
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,179
Something cold.

316
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,863
I'd like to talk to you
about what happened tonight.

317
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:31,333
- What do you think happened?
- I know I got left behind on purpose.

318
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,844
For your own best interest.

319
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:35,812
You don't know a goddamn thing
about my best interest.

320
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:39,215
You know, Murphy, what happens out there
isn't pretty for everyone.

321
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:41,082
- But it is for Peña?
- You're not Peña.

322
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:43,245
- 'Cause I'm a damn gringo.
- Because I trust him.

323
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:44,982
Why don't you try me?

324
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,584
This fight against Escobar,
you want to win it.

325
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:52,062
These guys aren't fighting
by the same rules, so why should we?

326
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:56,765
- You know what that means?
- Oh, I do.

327
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:02,673
So whether this is about protecting me
or protecting you, stop icing me out.

328
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:15,854
You were different this time.

329
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:25,385
I always know when my clients
are trying to forget something.

330
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,362
You know what I do to relax?

331
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,040
- I write.
- You write?

332
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,709
- What do you write?
- Letters.

333
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,908
For my family, but I never send them.

334
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:46,944
It's good to forget.

335
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,894
What do you want to forget?

336
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,836
Why don't you stop?

337
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:16,138
Why don't you?

338
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:41,936
Welcome, brother.

339
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:44,773
This way.

340
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:58,646
- What is your name?
- David.

341
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:03,184
- I'm Pablo. Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you too.

342
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:04,524
Follow me.

343
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:10,028
They told me you like soccer.

344
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:14,367
- I play defense.
- Of course.

345
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:17,306
Those are the real men.

346
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,181
You're very brave, David.

347
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:27,183
I'm sorry for what you witnessed.

348
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:31,047
The people we're fighting
are very bad people.

349
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:33,818
Tell me about the man who did that.

350
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:39,562
He said this bullet is for you.

351
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,676
I need you to do one last favor for me.

352
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,710
It's very important.

353
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,285
You think you can do it?

354
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,789
Thank you, David.

355
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,067
Peña.

356
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:20,867
Agent Peña. This is Don Berna.

357
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:24,068
I have a proposition
you might be interested in.

358
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,708
What a surprise.

359
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:36,112
What's up, Peña?
Are you expecting anyone else?

360
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:38,883
No. Are you?

361
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,392
No, it's not necessary.

362
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,657
Everywhere I go in this town,
I'm surrounded by friends.

363
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:48,757
Sit down. Sit so you can taste
the best coffee in Medellín.

364
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:52,464
Doña Luz! Bring my friend a coffee.

365
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,005
You have something
other than coffee for me?

366
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:01,908
Look, Agent, I'm not one of those
street-corner informants

367
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,075
that you slip a few gringo dollars
for a tip. No, sir.

368
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,584
Then why are we here?

369
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:16,751
Agent, you and I
are like the snake and the cat.

370
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:20,989
If the snake has the chance,
it will kill the cat.

371
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:24,330
And if the cat has the chance,
it will kill the snake.

372
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:30,475
But there are times
when they see a big rat,

373
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:32,874
and they both want to eat it.

374
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:37,176
This is Moncada's biggest lab.

375
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:40,183
It'll have to be inventoried
before it's dismantled and moved.

376
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:41,810
How you know that?

377
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,816
- One of my CI's.
- Hell of a tip.

378
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:47,154
It's a hell of a CI.

379
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,523
Look, you want Escobar's men,
there they are.

380
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:51,824
- Let's do it.
- All right.

381
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:23,414
Get up! Move! Move!

382
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,956
Get up!

383
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,319
Gato!

384
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:33,265
No, no, no! Calm down.
Okay, relax. Don't kill me...

385
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:35,661
Relax, relax, relax!

386
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,238
Detaining the prisoners.

387
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,772
Your CI hooked us a pretty big fish.

388
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:46,140
Yeah, he's a winner.

389
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,269
We captured about 45 of them.

390
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:51,984
- I wonder if he'll give us Escobar.
- I don't know.

391
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:55,485
- We'll see what Carrillo gets out of him.
- Yeah. We'll see.

392
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:03,427
Carrillo told me that he talked to you.
He thinks he can trust you.

393
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:05,153
Yeah, he can.

394
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:10,001
That's not what I mean.

395
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:12,595
Let's go.

396
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,436
I'm a big boy. I can handle it.

397
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:21,645
Yeah.

398
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:46,702
Approaching.

399
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:58,209
We're locking you up.

400
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,511
Move it!

401
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,246
- You get anything out of him?
- Something.

402
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:05,050
Not everything. Are you coming?

403
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:09,827
I'm in, yeah.

404
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:51,127
- Hello, Valeria.
- Pablo.

405
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:57,441
- I didn't realize you'd be here.
- I wanted to be sure it went well.

406
00:37:57,542 --> 00:38:02,309
- People need to hear the truth, right?
- Yes, it's important.

407
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:06,809
They forced this boy
to watch his friend get shot.

408
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:10,616
When the country hears this story,
they'll turn on that son of a bitch

409
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:13,214
who's murdering children
for the Americans.

410
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:18,458
Well, that's what I hope.

411
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,897
I'm glad you came.

412
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,764
It's good to see you again.

413
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:38,509
Are all eyes still on you?

414
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:42,581
Except yours.

415
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,767
Let's begin.

416
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:00,002
Yes.

417
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:02,095
- How old are you?
- Ten.

418
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:04,999
I understand you're quite a soccer player.

419
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,378
Thank you for being brave enough
to tell us your story, David.

420
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:14,042
Tell me, who were the men
who brought you to the building that day?

421
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:16,018
They were Search Bloc policemen.

422
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,718
Do you know why they brought you there?

423
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:22,794
He said they were going
to send a message to other kids.

424
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,296
Who is he? Do you remember his name?

425
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,331
Colonel Carrillo.

426
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:29,332
Relax, gentlemen, everything's fine.

427
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:32,796
- Where are you taking us?
- Bogotá.

428
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,509
You're going to jail
until this gets resolved.

429
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:41,910
But look...
if you help me, I can help you.

430
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:47,679
Give me Pablo, or Blackie or someone else,
then I'll help you.

431
00:39:47,752 --> 00:39:50,414
I don't know where they are.
I don't know them.

432
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:53,388
- So you don't know anything?
- No, sir.

433
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:57,752
What about you, Gato?

434
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,363
All right.

435
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,761
If it's going to be like this...

436
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:16,572
Who else was there
besides Colonel Carrillo?

437
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:17,739
A bunch of men.

438
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:22,844
Some I heard speaking English.
Americans. Like in the movies.

439
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,946
Are you sure they were police?

440
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:27,718
Yes.

441
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,191
What now?

442
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:34,032
You think Pablo is going to reward you
for being brave?

443
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:37,566
Asshole, he doesn't even know you exist.
Do you know that?

444
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,732
It's your last chance, Gato.

445
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:43,399
Ask your mother, you son of bitch!

446
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,170
- Hello.
- Everything is good.

447
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:51,333
- It worked.
- Very well.

448
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:54,869
It worked.

449
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:01,474
- They took my lab.
- And a bunch of Escobar's men.

450
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:04,487
It's for a noble cause, Mrs. Moncada.

451
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,518
Boss, forgive me, but there's bad news.

452
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:16,362
Search Bloc took down the Moncadas'
biggest lab before we could take it apart.

453
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:20,995
Carrillo got Gato. We don't know where
they are or what they're doing to him.

454
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:07,942
Hello?

455
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:09,886
Hello?

456
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,781
- Steve?
- Hey, baby.

457
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:16,553
What time is it?

458
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:21,798
It's late.

459
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,134
Are you okay?

460
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:30,800
Yeah, I'm good.
I just need to hear your voice.

461
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,403
I wanted to call, Steve. I...

462
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:40,949
It's okay. You don't have to explain.

463
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:43,743
What's happened?

464
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,723
Tell me.

465
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:52,826
I'm good, baby. I'm... Don't worry.

466
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,397
You have to go.

467
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,772
