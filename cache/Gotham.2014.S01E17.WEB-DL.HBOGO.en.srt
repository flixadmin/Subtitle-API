1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
<i>- Previously on</i> Gotham...
- Welcome to Wayne Enterprises.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,400
I have some questions regarding
Wayne Enterprises business affairs.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,320
Where's Jim?

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,880
Don Falcone thinks,
you don't know how to run a club.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,880
- Hi.
- He'll help you out.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,720
Those people out there
are using us as spare parts.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,960
Unless we do something about it.

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,640
Alfred, can you teach me
how to fight?

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,240
Yes, I can.

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,280
- Pretty handy for a valet.
- Butler, mate. I'm the butler.

11
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,320
What the hell is that?

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,720
- I made it.
- You made it?

13
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,160
- Yeah.
- So, what is it?

14
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,480
Well, it's a hood.

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,520
Thought it would,
you know, spice things up.

16
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,600
When did we start wearing hoods?

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,000
- We didn't.
- Was I supposed to get one?

18
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,120
No!

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,600
- Ladies.
- And gentlemen!

20
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,280
We are not here for your money!

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,000
We're here for the bank's money!

22
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,800
So just stay cool
and no one will get hurt!

23
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,640
Don't be brave!

24
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,960
Don't be frightened!
Just do what you're told!

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,680
This will all be over quicker
than that time

26
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,760
I hooked up with
a cheerleader on prom night!

27
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,480
What are you doing up there?

28
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,200
Getting them fired up.

29
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,600
90 seconds.

30
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,760
Nice and easy, ladies and gentlemen!

31
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,600
You know, banks like this one,
who are insured to death,

32
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,680
by the way,
steal from us every single day!

33
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,920
About time a few of us returned
the favor, don't you think?

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,120
60 seconds.

35
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,400
You're being great, folks!
Almost done!

36
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,320
40 seconds.

37
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,600
Nothing!

38
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,840
Not a scratch!

39
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,760
- Thirty seconds.
- Let's get out of here!

40
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,880
You've been great, ladies and germs,
but we got to go!

41
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,320
Did you see that? That guy missed me
with like, six shots!

42
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
- He was old, nervous.
- No, no, no, it's the hood,

43
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,680
I'm telling you.

44
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,440
- Damn it.
- We're cooked.

45
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,560
Attention, citizens of Gotham!

46
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,800
What the hell are you doing?

47
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,680
There you go, everybody!

48
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,920
Take back what's yours!

49
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,000
Follow me! Come on.

50
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,400
- Hold on.
- Holly!

51
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,720
{\an5}Well, we'll never know how much
cash was lost,

52
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,680
{\an5}but I just saw a bum eating
oysters at Madeline's.

53
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,920
{\an5}Another freak in a mask. Awesome.

54
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,800
Is that guard blind or wasted?

55
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,960
{\an5}Clyde refused to wear his glasses.

56
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,720
Said they made him look old.

57
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,760
{\an5}Missing a man standing 20 feet
in front of you

58
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,720
{\an5}with six shots makes you look old.

59
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,440
{\an5}- Who tripped the alarm?
- I did.

60
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,560
Why aren't you out there, Detective?

61
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,360
This brazen audacity cannot
be tolerated.

62
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,680
{\an5}They didn't go for the vault,

63
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,160
{\an5}just the cash in the registers.
And the crew was in and out

64
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,040
in under two minutes.

65
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,880
The red-hooded man seemed nice.

66
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,760
Nice?

67
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,840
{\an5}He wasn't stealing our money,
just the bank's.

68
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,640
{\an5}Then he gave a lot of it
back to people in the street. Like...

69
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,400
Robin Hood.

70
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,640
{\an5}Great.

71
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,080
{\an5}This bank hires Communists.

72
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,160
{\an5}Robin Hood stole from the rich
and gave to the poor.

73
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,200
{\an5}These armed thieves only threw
cash away to guarantee their escape.

74
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,040
It's very different, ma'am.

75
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,600
{\an5}The thief in the back here,
was he always checking his watch?

76
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,920
Yes. He was counting down.

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,200
They knew what our response
time was.

78
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,400
They'd done their homework.

79
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,040
{\an5}Has the alarm been triggered
for any other reason recently?

80
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,440
- No.
- Well...

81
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,880
{\an5}There was that time
with the smoke bomb.

82
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,240
{\an5}- Smoke bomb?
- A week or so ago,

83
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,240
{\an5}a small flare or firework,
or something,

84
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,280
was set off by the Mortgages desk.

85
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,720
{\an5}It tripped the alarm.
We thought it was just a kid's prank.

86
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,960
{\an5}We're gonna need you to find
the surveillance footage

87
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,400
{\an5}from that incident.

88
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,720
{\an5}Yes, sir. How can I help you?

89
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,440
{\an5}Reggie?

90
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,480
Sorry for calling so late.

91
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,960
{\an5}Forgive me.

92
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,000
Oh my god, mate.
How long's it been?

93
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,080
20 years.

94
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,440
I got picked up
by the GCPD last night

95
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,760
for trying to sleep
under the Westbury Bridge.

96
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,400
{\an5}- Here, mate.
- Cheers, mate.

97
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,360
{\an5}One of the officers was a Marine,
back in the day.

98
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,440
So we got to talking.

99
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,960
I told him I was with Her Majesty's
Special Air Service back in the day.

100
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,680
So he took pity on me.

101
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,120
He says, "Why don't you look up
some of your old regiment?

102
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,680
You know, see if one of the guys can,
help you out."

103
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,800
Well, you know...

104
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,640
Pleased you looked me up, Reg.

105
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,440
If anyone would've told me...

106
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,720
This is where I'd find you,
I wouldn't have believed them.

107
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,840
I like it here.

108
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
It's good for me.

109
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,960
I can see that.

110
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
I've missed you, mate.

111
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,720
Missed your ugly mug.

112
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,240
Cheers.

113
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,920
What happened, Reggie?

114
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,000
Vanessa died.

115
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,760
11-years-ago now.

116
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,560
I just couldn't find the energy
to get back out there after that,

117
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,640
you know?

118
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,360
A year later, I lost the house.

119
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,880
Moved back to Gotham.

120
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,600
I've had a few jobs.

121
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,680
Nothing I'm proud of.

122
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,160
It was the drink, Alfie.

123
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,080
It was the drink.

124
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,640
Alfred?

125
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,280
Master Bruce.

126
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,440
This is, Reginald Payne.

127
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,840
We served together, sir.

128
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,800
Very pleased to meet you, sir.

129
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,480
You were caught in the storm?

130
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,720
Reggie's had a run of bad luck,
Master Bruce.

131
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,560
I, I don't wish to be a nuisance.
I just...

132
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,320
I hadn't seen Alfie
in a very long time.

133
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,840
No. No, I'm glad you found us,
Mr. Payne.

134
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,520
Please, feel free to stay
with us a few days.

135
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,680
That's very kind of you, but...

136
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
I insist.

137
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
Please.

138
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,000
Where are you taking me?

139
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,480
This way, Ms. Mooney.

140
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,600
Who chose these people?
Where'd you get them from?

141
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,640
Sit, please.

142
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
Sit.

143
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,800
There you are, Mr. Red Hood.

144
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,920
Armed robbery perps dating
back 10 years.

145
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,360
I took out the dead ones
and the ones in prison.

146
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,560
A "who's who" of scumbags.

147
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,960
They were casing the place
a week before they took it down.

148
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,600
Set off the alarm,
then timed the response.

149
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,960
He looks pretty young.
He might not be in here.

150
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,600
- You see that?
- No, because you took my glasses.

151
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,440
Right there, underneath his coat.

152
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,720
He's wearing a work shirt.

153
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,280
"Kleg's Auto."

154
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,040
Idiot.

155
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,160
"The Red Hood Gang"!

156
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,000
It's got a ring to it.

157
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,680
- No, it doesn't.
- See those people?

158
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,960
They loved me.

159
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,560
They loved the money
you threw at them.

160
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,080
Thanks for that, by the way.

161
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,080
Shall we take it out of your share?

162
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,440
You guys don't get it!
We're not just five mooks

163
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,080
with shotguns anymore.

164
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,880
We're the Red Hood Gang!

165
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,800
Taking from the rich
and giving back to the poor.

166
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,200
Mark my words, the people
in this town, they're gonna get me.

167
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,280
- Us.
- Will you shut up?

168
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,200
All that prancing around
could have gotten us killed.

169
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,680
You're wrong. That guard,
he was 20ft away from me!

170
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,800
Not one shot got close.

171
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,120
Luck!

172
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,240
He looked re... Real nervous.

173
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,800
It's the hood!
It's good luck, I'm telling you!

174
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,120
I feel like a totally
different person with it on.

175
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Sit down, will you?

176
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,760
We need to go over tomorrow's score.

177
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,880
No, this sets us apart.

178
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,520
It's a piece of cloth...

179
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,280
Two holes cut out of it.

180
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,720
It's a symbol!

181
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,160
Whoever wears the hood should lead!

182
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,880
He's right.

183
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,800
Any objections?

184
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,600
So...

185
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,520
You're the one causing all
of the fuss.

186
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,600
The one with the knife now.

187
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,640
This is your facility?

188
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,360
I manage it, yes.

189
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,000
But do you own it?

190
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,720
The doctor owns it.

191
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,120
- Where are you going?
- Back to the basement.

192
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,280
We're done here.

193
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,760
Ms. Mooney...

194
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,680
Take a seat.

195
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,160
I will talk to the doctor
and the doctor only.

196
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,360
He's away on a consultation
in Gotham.

197
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,160
Then call me when he returns.

198
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,840
He expressly...

199
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,160
Asked me...

200
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,640
To attend to your demands.

201
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,840
- His name.
- I'm sorry?

202
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,720
The doctor, his name!

203
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,920
Dulmacher.

204
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,920
You tell Dr. Dulmacher...

205
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,240
That the basement is mine.

206
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,520
No one will leave unless I say so.

207
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,120
It will remain that way

208
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,560
until he sits with me...

209
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,160
And negotiates terms.

210
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,480
Perhaps.

211
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,280
You and I got off on the wrong foot,
Ms. Mooney.

212
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,920
When was the last time
you had a shower?

213
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,080
A new set of clothes?

214
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,600
Take Ms. Mooney
to my private bathroom,

215
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,080
and then pick up some fresh clothes
for her from storage.

216
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,120
Freshen up.

217
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,120
Come back to me.

218
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,000
And then perhaps
we'll talk some more.

219
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,520
So the mortician says
to the waitress...

220
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,560
No, the waitress says
to the mortician.

221
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,560
- "He was always stiff!"
- That's it. Let's go.

222
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,400
Wait. No.

223
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,040
Have a good night.
See you next week, sir. Okay.

224
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,400
- It's fine. We got...
- Check, please.

225
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,480
Yeah. No, no, no.

226
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,440
Cards.

227
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,880
- What's wrong?
- Mr. Penguin.

228
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,360
I mean, the Penguin. I mean... I'm...

229
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,160
What is it?

230
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,720
We're out of booze.

231
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,160
What? Hello? Behind you,
there's a wall of booze.

232
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,320
Just colored water, sir.
Always has been.

233
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,760
We keep the real stuff down here,
but we're out.

234
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,640
- So, duh, order more.
- We did.

235
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,160
It's just that...

236
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,440
It's Maroni's booze.

237
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,720
And he's a little grumpy with you
these days.

238
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,840
He was hardly a fan of Fish, either.

239
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,600
Why did he sell her booze?

240
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,720
Business is business.

241
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,440
But he hates you with a passion.

242
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,240
But...

243
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,880
- He can't kill you, so...
- That's...

244
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,000
This is ridiculous.

245
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,920
There's a thousand
places to buy booze.

246
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,440
That's where it gets complicated.

247
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,400
See, Maroni,
he supplies this whole side of town.

248
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,800
No one would dare cross him
to help you.

249
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,960
Help!

250
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,200
Shut up...

251
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,720
Get outta here!

252
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,560
Thank you. Bye. Sorry.

253
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,720
You're not funny.

254
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,760
You must take great pleasure
watching me fail.

255
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,720
On the contrary.

256
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,880
I was with Fish...

257
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,920
When we took this place off
a Chinese bookie nine years ago.

258
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,240
It was used for cockfighting.

259
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,640
Took forever to get the smell out.

260
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,000
My blood, sweat, and tears
are in this dive.

261
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,640
Well, if you'll excuse me...

262
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,040
It seems as though I need
to procure some alcohol

263
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,000
for my dwindling clientele.

264
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,800
Be careful.

265
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,560
You've seen what happens
when you cross Maroni.

266
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,680
GCPD!

267
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,200
Looks like they were here last night.

268
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,120
Hey.
Your hot doctor friend, Thompkins.

269
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,440
- Leslie.
- Whatever.

270
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,760
Give me the double D,
"dirty details".

271
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,120
Don't leave anything out.

272
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,320
Gotta hand it to you, partner.

273
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,120
You don't sit around moping.
You got right back up

274
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,880
on the hobby horse.

275
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,960
Let's just hope you can
keep your head straight...

276
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,640
Whilst up there.

277
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,640
You had the purse,
now you got yourself a nurse.

278
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,720
Well...

279
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,360
Looks like I found
our friend Floyd.

280
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,920
What? If I don't drink it,
Forensics will.

281
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,000
All right. This was the guy
with the hood.

282
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,080
He's wearing the same coat.

283
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,400
I wonder what he did to piss off
the rest of his crew.

284
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,400
Maybe they knew
we'd catch up to him.

285
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,520
Well, he was the leader,

286
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,600
so it looks like we've seen
the last of the Red Hood Crew now.

287
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,200
Good morning, everyone!

288
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,000
Get off me! I got it.

289
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,480
- Okay.
- We're not here...

290
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,160
For your money.

291
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,200
We're here for the insurance!

292
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,000
I mean, the bank's insured money!

293
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,400
60 seconds.

294
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,640
Hey! You gonna share a little bit
of that cash with us, Hood?

295
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,520
Yeah.

296
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,160
Th... Thirty seconds.

297
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,200
Come on.
A lot of us are hurting here.

298
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,880
Yeah.

299
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,200
10 seconds. Let's go!

300
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,760
Fine!

301
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,160
So long, Gotham!

302
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,200
Sayonara!

303
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,440
And then there were four.

304
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,800
People are gonna hang out
in banks waiting

305
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,120
for handouts from these idiots.

306
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,960
We're never gonna catch a crew
no one wants us to catch.

307
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,080
Call me old-fashioned,

308
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,200
but when crooks
become more popular than cops,

309
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,520
- that's anarchy.
- Think about it,

310
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,000
as long as somebody's willing
to put that red hood on,

311
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,080
this gang can go on forever.

312
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,720
- Hey, guys.
- Got somebody here,

313
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,080
you might want to meet.

314
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,760
- This is Mister...
- Chiang.

315
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,680
Chiang, right.
He's an eyewitness.

316
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,240
From the bank?

317
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,160
I work at a restaurant a block away.

318
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,240
The Red Hood Gang parked
their van there this morning.

319
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,200
I was throwing out the trash
when they ran back to it.

320
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,440
You see their faces?

321
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,520
Just one,

322
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,080
the fat one with the hood.

323
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,160
He took it off to drive.

324
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,120
- I'll get the sketch artist.
- Well, wait a minute.

325
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,760
Got the armed robbery files
already opened.

326
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,000
Maybe he can look through them,
see if he recognizes someone.

327
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,800
Maybe that someone
is a known associate of Gus Floyd.

328
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,280
Only problem is records
are kind of old,

329
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,360
- he might look different now.
- We could pull a few based off

330
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,000
Chiang's description,

331
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,200
get ourselves
a good old-fashioned lineup.

332
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,760
Hey, wait a second.
What's in it for me?

333
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,800
I got all these parking tickets
because my ex-wife is a crazy bitch.

334
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,320
We'll see what we can do.

335
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,360
Training for a fight?

336
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,640
- Just training.
- Who's helping you?

337
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,920
Alfred.

338
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,160
Good choice.

339
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,640
Show me your stance.

340
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,680
Good.

341
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,920
Hit me.

342
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,840
Again.

343
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,720
And don't hold back.

344
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,040
You have a go at me, son.

345
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,800
Come on. It should take more than
that to piss you off, son.

346
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
Come on.

347
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,120
Again!

348
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,200
Come on.

349
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,080
Now, now. Never lose your cool.

350
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,320
It'll get you killed.

351
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,920
Now, you wanna hit me, right?
You wanna hit me, right?

352
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,960
Okay. Take a swing.

353
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,240
Take a swing. Go on. Do it.

354
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,760
Somebody gives you a free shot,
you got to make it count.

355
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,480
You hit me as hard as you can!

356
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,640
Better! Put your shoulder behind it.
Put your full body weight behind it!

357
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,800
Go on. Do it.

358
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,480
Harder! Again!

359
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,600
Again. Come on! Do it again.

360
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,720
Put me on my back, son.
Come on, you can do it.

361
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,040
Come on. Again.

362
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,600
- You're so much bigger than me!
- Then use that to your advantage!

363
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,800
You hit me low!
Hit me in the knee, the ankle!

364
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,600
Forget about the gloves!
Use whatever's around you.

365
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,000
Here... Here.

366
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,640
- Go on.
- Right!

367
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,880
That's enough of that.

368
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,200
Perhaps a shower's in order,
Master Bruce.

369
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,960
Mr. Payne was just showing me

370
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,440
- some alternative methods.
- Yeah, I can see that, can't I?

371
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,640
Not methods that fit
into our curriculum,

372
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,560
though, are they?

373
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,040
No, they're not,
but they're effective.

374
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,320
Discipline, skill and, hard work
are effective.

375
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,800
How about I start that shower
for you, sir?

376
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,760
No.

377
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,120
You ever raised a child before, Reg?

378
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,440
No.

379
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,320
Me neither.

380
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,360
Hardest job
I've ever had to do in my life.

381
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,440
Nothing prepares you for it.

382
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,680
Listen, I'm sorry
if I overstepped the mark.

383
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,160
I was just...

384
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,120
It was obvious how much
you've helped him, so...

385
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,840
No, he helped me.

386
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,680
I'm a better person for knowing him,
Reg.

387
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,480
Let's keep our past
where it belongs.

388
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,360
In the past.

389
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,000
That's it? Just two workers?

390
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,040
This'll be easy.

391
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,800
Make it quick, guys.

392
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,920
This is inconvenient.

393
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Officer.

394
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,960
- Nothing going on here.
- That so?

395
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,560
Your liquor license is out of date.

396
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,520
We're gonna be confiscating
the shipment.

397
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,160
Hey, does Don Maroni know
you guys are here?

398
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,000
Walk away...

399
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,560
Before I run you downtown.

400
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,040
This town is truly going to the dogs.

401
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,240
Evening, fellas!

402
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,680
Hold on a second.

403
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,160
Why the smile, Butch?

404
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,000
First Maroni blocks our liquor,
and now the cops?

405
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,880
Who, them? They're with me.

406
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,200
I always keep a few uniforms
in the closet.

407
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,360
A lot cleaner than going
in guns blazing, don't you think?

408
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,800
You're welcome, Oswald.

409
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,840
Nice work there.

410
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,880
<i>- How you doing, Mr. Gilzean?
- This over here.</i>

411
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,360
<i>Nothing to worry about.</i>

412
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,320
You okay?

413
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,480
Of course.

414
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,120
Thank you for letting us stay here.

415
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,360
Sorry it got a little messy.
I was just about to go.

416
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,360
I like having you guys here.

417
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,880
Selina.

418
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,240
Come here.

419
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,440
You know, you're turning
into quite the beautiful woman.

420
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,400
No, I'm not.

421
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,680
Remove the dirt...

422
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,880
That old hood...

423
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,840
These ratty clothes...

424
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,000
I bet we find a princess underneath.

425
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,800
I have an idea.

426
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,640
Holy moly.

427
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,600
Take anything that fits you guys.

428
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,520
This is all stuff you've worn?

429
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,000
Most of it.

430
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,120
You sure must go out a lot.

431
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,680
I used to.

432
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,400
Come with me.

433
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,440
You're a true beauty.

434
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,360
Something you can use
to your advantage.

435
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,600
Your appearance...

436
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,800
Can be a weapon...

437
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,400
As powerful as any knife or gun.

438
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,520
Yeah?

439
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,680
What good's it done you?

440
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,520
<i>All right, backs to the wall.
Hold your numbers up.</i>

441
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,680
<i>No talking.</i>

442
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,520
I thought they were going to be
similar types.

443
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,600
They are.

444
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,200
- Look closely, Mr. Chiang.
- I know how this works.

445
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,880
There. Number four.
The short, fat one.

446
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,280
- You're sure?
- That's your Red Hood.

447
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,160
Threw all that money away,
and I didn't get a cent.

448
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,800
Clyde Destro, 47 years old,

449
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,240
conviction for assault and armed
robbery of a convenience store

450
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,600
three years ago.

451
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,120
- Let's book him.
- Wait a minute.

452
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,200
All we have is one witness
outside of the crime scene,

453
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,560
that's it.

454
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,400
Now, Floyd was killed, so we know
they're turning on each other.

455
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,480
- Let Destro go?
- And tail him.

456
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,400
He takes us
to the other gang members,

457
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,680
we use them against each other.

458
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,760
We catch the Red Hood Gang
red-handed.

459
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,200
- That's right.
- Can I get a ride home?

460
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,160
My girlfriend will freak out
if I turn up in a patrol car.

461
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,600
Well...

462
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,520
Don't you look lovely?

463
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,280
There's still business to discuss.

464
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,720
Of course.

465
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,600
The basement.

466
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,920
How do I resume operations?
We do have a business to run.

467
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,240
Yes.

468
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,840
You're stealing body parts.

469
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,560
For who?

470
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,600
We have clients...

471
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,080
All over the world
in need of such things.

472
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,160
Also...

473
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,800
There's the doctor's
personal experiments.

474
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,120
You have such a presence,
Ms. Mooney.

475
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,440
Such a gaze.

476
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,760
Your eyes...

477
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,240
Will fetch quite a penny.

478
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,760
You will take...

479
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,760
Nothing from me.

480
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,400
Really?

481
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,280
Because the way I see it,
you have two choices. One...

482
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,160
We kill you and your little friends
in the basement.

483
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,360
That's an inconvenience
but an acceptable one.

484
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,880
Or two...

485
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,000
We take your eyes now.

486
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,880
And see how long a blind girl
can survive in the basement.

487
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,840
You forgot option three.

488
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,520
Stop her!

489
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,960
No!

490
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,440
I picked something out
from the cellar.

491
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,200
I hope that's okay.

492
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,840
Well, that's extremely
kind of you, Master Bruce,

493
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,000
but I don't think that we...

494
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,240
That I'll be, drinking this evening.

495
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,920
I'm sure it's perfectly fine
to have a...

496
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,680
Glass of wine occasionally, Alfred.

497
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,920
I, I picked an old one.

498
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,920
Seems a shame to let them
gather dust down there.

499
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,400
Domaine de la Romany Comte.

500
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,880
It's a rather nice Burgundy,
actually, it's 1966.

501
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,320
Yeah.
It's one of your father's favorites.

502
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,520
Why not? Take a pew.

503
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,240
- That's very kind of you.
- There you go.

504
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,600
- Cheers, mate.

505
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,480
Now, the idea, of course, is to...

506
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,840
Let it breathe for at least an hour.

507
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,440
Or not.

508
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,040
Delicious.

509
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,760
So he eventually opened his backpack
and he found the bloody snake.

510
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,920
We'd been waiting for it all night.

511
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,280
He didn't even flinch.

512
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,120
- What'd you do?
- You know, I chopped,

513
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,080
its head off
and we ate the bloody thing.

514
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,360
He did!

515
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,400
- What did it taste like?
- A bit like...

516
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
Fast food.

517
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,240
- It was horrible, isn't it?
- It was horrible.

518
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,920
It was disgusting.

519
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,080
So...

520
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,080
So, Mr. Payne,
you were in the Air Force?

521
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,920
Special Air Service. SAS.

522
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,560
Best soldiers in the world...

523
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,640
If I'm being honest.

524
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,040
So, that means covert missions?

525
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,120
That's right.

526
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,200
Before a conflict,
they dropped us behind enemy lines.

527
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,280
We were quiet, precise...

528
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,200
And deadly.

529
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,760
We never lost a man and we always
completed our missions.

530
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,960
Except that once, I guess.

531
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,120
Yeah, well, that's enough
of the old war stories, Reg?

532
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,120
What one time?

533
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,120
There was a sandstorm.

534
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,640
We got separated.

535
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,280
Two of us were captured.

536
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,520
You?

537
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,280
He fought 12 of them off
before they cut him down.

538
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,600
Didn't you, Alf?

539
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,360
I'm here now, aren't I?
That's all that matters.

540
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,240
All right, gents, while I have to say
this has been absolutely lovely,

541
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,680
I'd like to...

542
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,160
I'd like to tidy up
before I go to bed.

543
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,520
Tidy up?

544
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,480
Mr. "Yes Sir, No Sir"?

545
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,560
Mr. "Queensberry Rules
and Discipline"?

546
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,040
Thank you, that's enough.

547
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,880
Alfred's right. It's time for bed.

548
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,840
- Good night, Master Bruce.
- Good night. Good night.

549
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,920
Sleep well, son.

550
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,000
Why are you hiding
from him what you really are,

551
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,480
who you really are?

552
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,320
You're a war dog, Alfie.

553
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,440
You're a cold-blooded,
lethal war dog is what you are.

554
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,320
I found some fresh clothes
for you, Reg.

555
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,960
I folded them
and I put them on your bed.

556
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,280
And I've taken the liberty...

557
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,680
Of packing you a lunch
for your travels tomorrow.

558
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,480
It's been really nice to see you,
Reggie.

559
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,160
I see them at night...

560
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,240
When I'm alone.

561
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,800
The faces...

562
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,000
Faces of those we killed.

563
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
Do you?

564
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,880
I don't have to look for them, Reg.

565
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,400
They find me.

566
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,800
Holy crap.

567
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,400
You scared the snot out of me.

568
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,000
Had to see you. I couldn't wait.

569
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,400
- Where were you?
- Out.

570
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,880
Just out?

571
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,440
What's it to you?

572
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,640
I need the hood.

573
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,400
What?

574
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,520
No.

575
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,720
My girlfriend, She wants...
She wants to leave.

576
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,560
She... She called me a loser
last night.

577
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,400
Her ex is back in town.
He's a bouncer.

578
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,440
I figured she'd...
She sees me in the hood,

579
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,080
she's got...
She's got to take me seriously.

580
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,320
Did you ransack
my place looking for it?

581
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,440
I need it, Destro.

582
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,200
They're talking about it on
the streets

583
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,680
and in, and in the news.
She sees me in it, and I'm...

584
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,960
No!

585
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,000
We have one last job
before we split up and skip town.

586
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,600
You have it on you, don't you?

587
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,600
You better use that thing

588
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,920
before I make you eat it.

589
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,120
He's alive.

590
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,120
Who shot you, Destro?
Give us the name of the guy.

591
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,680
- I need an ambulance.
- We'll get to that.

592
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,400
Give us the names of the guys
in your crew.

593
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,800
I'm bleeding out.

594
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,280
Yeah, you're dying.

595
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,000
And unfortunately,
I'm not getting cell reception.

596
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,720
You know, what might help?
Giving us the names

597
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,880
of the guys in your crew!

598
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,200
I need an ambulance.

599
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,960
Java Heights and Homewood,
apartment 466.

600
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,440
I might need some pressure
on this wound.

601
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,880
Knock yourself out.

602
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,800
What do you got there, partner?

603
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,680
A stack of loan rejection letters
from the banks that were robbed.

604
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,560
"Dear Mr. Destro,
we regret to inform you

605
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,400
your application for a loan
has been denied."

606
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,840
"Mr. Destro, once again,
we must deny your application,

607
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,440
due to inadequate collateral."

608
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,720
What the hell would he need
a loan for?

609
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,920
Pastry shop.

610
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,640
Get out of here. You're a baker?

611
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,640
A damn good baker.

612
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,280
And they all turned you down.

613
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,960
So these are revenge robberies.

614
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,560
Banks don't care
about people like me.

615
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,840
Or you, probably.

616
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,120
You have to force people to see you.

617
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,720
Otherwise, you're nothing.

618
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,680
There's a third letter here.

619
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,640
International Savings Bank
of Gotham.

620
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,640
- This was the next target.
- Where's my ambulance?

621
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,800
To new beginnings.

622
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,280
I'm not trying to poison you, son.

623
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,960
Forgive me if I'm a little cautious.

624
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,560
If this club tanks,

625
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,640
Falcone's not gonna trust
either of us again.

626
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,480
I don't know about you,

627
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,000
but I'm done playing
the sidekick.

628
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,680
To no longer being a sidekick.

629
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,160
Do you miss her?

630
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,800
I do.

631
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,120
Even after everything she did to me.

632
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,880
Perhaps it's not our friends, but...

633
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,640
Our enemies that define us.

634
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,080
To Fish.

635
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,600
She got what she deserved.

636
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,160
You're stealing from us?

637
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,360
You could have just asked me
for money, Reg.

638
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,680
You don't know how hard
that is, Alfie, do you?

639
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,240
We gave you somewhere to sleep.

640
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,840
We put food in your belly.

641
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,400
I'm in trouble.

642
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,000
Real trouble.

643
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,760
I don't need a lecture right now.

644
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,160
What kind of trouble?

645
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,080
You don't want to know.

646
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,280
Right. Well, you put the bag down...

647
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,040
And you leave, now.

648
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,920
Did you bring a gun, Alfie?

649
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,120
No.

650
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,600
If there was any other way...

651
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,440
Come on,
there's always another way, mate.

652
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,080
I'm sorry.

653
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,160
Sorry f...

654
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,720
I'm so sorry.

655
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,400
This is Bruce Wayne.

656
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,720
I need immediate help
at Wayne Manor!

657
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,240
My friend has been stabbed.

658
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,360
Alfred? Alfred, Alfred, look at me.
You're gonna be okay!

659
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,240
Alfred, stay with me.

660
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,760
Please.

661
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,400
Alfred!

662
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,720
There's only three of us.

663
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,320
I'm worried.
If someone makes a move in there...

664
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,400
Don't be.

665
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,400
I have this.

666
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,480
<i>GCPD!</i>

667
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,000
<i>We have you surrounded!</i>

668
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,960
This doesn't have to end badly!
Put down your guns!

669
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,000
Suck it, coppers!

670
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,520
Man down! Man down!

671
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,840
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

672
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,840
<i>- Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!</i>

673
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,920
Drop it!

674
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,240
It's over.

675
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,280
Yeah?

676
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,440
Don't be so sure.

677
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,080
I need a danish.

678
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,880
Yeah.

679
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,080
Which hospital?

680
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,400
I can't lose him.

681
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,200
He's all I have.

682
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,760
He has nothing concrete.

683
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,880
Just...

684
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,280
Faces, some dates,

685
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,360
some newspaper articles.

686
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,360
There's no grounds
for an investigation.

687
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,440
Just suspicions,

688
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,760
some cobbled-together theories...

689
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,520
Nothing.

690
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,240
Has he had outside counsel?

691
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,040
I don't think so.

692
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,680
And his caretaker, Mr. Pennyworth?

693
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,960
He's in the hospital.

694
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,240
For how long?

695
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,840
If he lives, a few weeks,
give or take.

696
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,840
Now's the time to make
a move on the kid.

697
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,720
Thank you for your service,
Mr. Payne.

698
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,240
I doubt we'll meet again.

699
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,440
He's just a kid.

700
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,280
A good kid.

701
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,080
Goodbye, Mr. Payne
