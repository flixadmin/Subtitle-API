1
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:06,507
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:10,719
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:13,347
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,517
Then an accident made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,812
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:25,484
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:30,155
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,157
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:34,868
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:37,955
It's Clyde Mardon.
I think he can control the weather.

11
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,791
I didn't think there was
anyone else like me.

12
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,252
I'm not like you.

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,878
You're a murderer.

14
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,216
I love you, Iris.

15
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,968
He and I are just best friends.

16
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,555
So how do we catch somebody
that even I can't keep up with?

17
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:58,850
We can fashion an electronic barrier
to trap the Reverse-Flash.

18
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,853
The super-capacitors,
the containment field is fluctuating.

19
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:06,817
I don't know why the containment system
failed. I must have missed something.

20
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,987
- You think Dr. Wells killed Barry's mom?
- I don't know yet.

21
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:13,282
But I do know that Wells keeps secrets.

22
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,118
And this may be one of them.

23
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,331
I got a plane to catch.

24
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,252
Come on, Clyde.

25
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,383
Damn it.

26
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,358
I think I got one of them.

27
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:52,654
- Your luck's gonna run out one day.
- You been telling me that since I was 10.

28
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:56,199
Because I've been taking care of you
since you were 10.

29
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:01,163
Look, it's gonna get choppy.
You might want to strap yourself in.

30
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,373
You just can't help yourself, can you?

31
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,839
Oh, my God.

32
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,317
Clyde.

33
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,112
Clyde!

34
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,456
I never would've pegged you
as someone who likes to bowl.

35
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:49,670
This is one of my favorite places in the world.
One of the only sports I can destroy you at.

36
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,672
Okay, you think so, huh?

37
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,383
I am pretty sure, yeah.

38
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,134
Okay.

39
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,720
Hi, guys.

40
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,431
Iris. Eddie. Hey.

41
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,974
What are you guys doing here?

42
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,560
We thought it would be fun.

43
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:09,606
Barry and I have been bowling here since
we were kids. Why don't you guys join us?

44
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,525
Uh...

45
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,987
- We don't wanna interrupt your date.
- No, it's okay.

46
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,115
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

47
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,783
It'll be fun.

48
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,202
So blame it on the night.

49
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,287
Don't blame it on me.

50
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:28,375
- Ha, ha. Do you smell that? That's defeat.
- You never told me...

51
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,086
- you were such a big fan of bowling.
- Sure, I have.

52
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,880
This is one of my favorite places
in the world.

53
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,800
Don't blame it on me.

54
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,389
Hey-o! Ha, ha!

55
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,057
I am impressed, Allen.

56
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:48,061
I heard the owner is thinking of selling.
Maybe you could write a piece on the place?

57
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,523
Um, I'm still iffy on whether bowling
is an actual sport.

58
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,191
I've wondered the same.

59
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,362
Well, sport or hobby,
I am still better than you.

60
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,575
Well, I'm serious. With
a little bit of press...

61
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:05,954
the lanes could be designated as, like,
a landmark or something.

62
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,623
- Oh, Eddie, you're up, man.
- Oh, right.

63
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,503
Go get them, babe.

64
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:19,384
Recording start.
Central City coroner's report, File 28527.

65
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:24,139
The petechial hemorrhaging in the mucosa of
the lips and the interior of the mouth...

66
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:28,018
the strong odor of bleach, and the
presence of a postmortem ligature mark...

67
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,979
all suggest the decedent's
manner of death is...

68
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,064
Homicide.

69
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,443
- Can I help you?
- Yes, you can.

70
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:41,490
I wanna know who killed Clyde Mardon.

71
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:45,243
He was shot by a cop
little over six months ago.

72
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,246
- And I want his name.
- That's privileged information.

73
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,248
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

74
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,083
Shame.

75
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:58,840
Please.

76
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,468
The cop's name. Now.

77
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,887
I perform hundreds of autopsies a year.

78
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,475
Perhaps this will jog your memory.

79
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,648
- Buster Keaton. Guy was a genius.
- Yup.

80
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,235
- I can't believe you've never seen this.
- Must have been before my time.

81
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,363
I gotta make you
a must-see movie list, pronto.

82
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,574
Please do. While I am more
than happy to spend an evening...

83
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:28,453
watching old movies, Cisco, do you
not have your brother's dinner to attend?

84
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:33,208
Yeah, I was gonna ask Caitlin to come
with me, but then I got a much better idea.

85
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,418
- Which was?
- To not go at all.

86
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:37,671
Oh.

87
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,341
- Things are not any better with your family?
- You're missing the movie.

88
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,843
Right.

89
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,889
Okay, I'm gonna be honest with you. Things
have actually been pretty fantastic...

90
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,683
since I stopped seeing them so much.

91
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,731
Silent alarm has been tripped
at the Central City Morgue.

92
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,901
Why would anyone wanna rob a morgue?

93
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,615
I gotta go. Emergency at the morgue.

94
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,158
- Bye.
- See you at home.

95
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,035
Hey, Linda. Sorry, I should go too.

96
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:12,706
They're gonna need someone
from the crime lab. I'll see you.

97
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,586
Well, um, that was fun.

98
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,421
Yeah.

99
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:44,988
Taxi! Taxi! Oh, come on, I'm gonna be late.

100
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,621
- What's going on? What do you see?
- A dead body.

101
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,291
Barry, you're in a morgue. You're
gonna have to be more specific than that.

102
00:06:56,499 --> 00:07:00,337
The coroner. He's dead.

103
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,641
- Mayor's made this high priority.
- Copy that, captain.

104
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:15,518
Allen.

105
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:19,564
- My fiancé just bought me this.
- Yeah. I'm so sorry, captain.

106
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,692
- Just help Joe find out who did this.
- Mm-hm.

107
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,320
What's with all the water?

108
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,572
Did the sprinkler system go off
or something?

109
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,825
No, I checked all the sprinklers.
They're all intact.

110
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,827
But look at this.

111
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,040
- What is that, ice?
- Mm-hm.

112
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:40,001
The coroner has multiple impact bruises
on his torso...

113
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,087
all the size of a tennis ball.

114
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,255
Judging by the amount of ice and water...

115
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,592
- I'm guessing he was killed by hail.
- Hail. In here?

116
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,345
- Yeah.
- You think this was Snart?

117
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,764
No, his cold-gun couldn't have done this.

118
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,140
Joe, we got something.

119
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:57,519
The coroner's office just installed
an automated dictation system.

120
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,479
Listen to this.

121
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,231
Please. No more.

122
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,274
I'll stop when you tell me.

123
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,110
- Stop.
- Who killed him?

124
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,612
- I know that voice. That's Mardon.
- I want a name.

125
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,657
- Clyde Mardon's dead.
- It's not Clyde. It's his brother, Mark.

126
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,660
It was Detective West. He shot him.

127
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,538
Detective Joe West killed your brother.

128
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,791
- And he will pay for what he did.
- No.

129
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:33,596
- So Clyde Mardon has a brother?
- And both brothers survived the plane crash...

130
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:37,475
and then the dark matter released
from the particle accelerator explosion...

131
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:41,104
affects them both
in virtually the same way.

132
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,815
Yeah, only Mark's powers
seem to be a lot more precise.

133
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,609
To be able to control the weather like that
indoors...

134
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,404
You'd have to be a Weather Wizard. Ooh.

135
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,323
Been waiting since week one
to use that one. Mm!

136
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,650
- Trigeminal headache?
- What?

137
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:57,495
- Trigeminal headache. Brain freeze.
- Then why didn't you just call it brain freeze?

138
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,165
Guess running around a twister
in the opposite direction...

139
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,875
isn't gonna do the trick this time.

140
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,086
I just remembered, during our run-in
with Mardon, Clyde Mardon...

141
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:09,299
I was tinkering with something to help
attract unbound atmospheric electrons.

142
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,717
Like a grounding mechanism?

143
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,470
Yes. The only way Mardon
can control the weather...

144
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,816
is if he can tap into the atmosphere's
natural electrical circuit.

145
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,814
And if we take away
that circuit, clear skies.

146
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,062
Singh's checking in. I gotta go.

147
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,899
- Yeah, I'll meet you at the station.
- Joe. We'll find Mardon. Don't worry.

148
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,817
I'm not worried at all.

149
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,737
Well, he's taking being targeted...

150
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,074
by a revenge-seeking metahuman
rather well, I must say.

151
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,993
Don't worry, Barry.
Joe will be fine. I promise.

152
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,870
Yeah. No, I know.

153
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,082
I actually wanted to talk to you
about something else.

154
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,835
Look, last night, on
my way to the morgue...

155
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,253
I saw something.

156
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:53,093
- What did you see?
- I was running and I turned and I saw myself.

157
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:57,514
Or, I don't know, another Flash.
Running beside me.

158
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,433
- Interesting.
- Yeah. What do you think it was?

159
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:04,020
Could be an illusion, a mirroring effect
caused by wind shear and light.

160
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,397
A speed mirage, if you will.

161
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,941
It didn't seem like that.

162
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,567
It was...

163
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,445
He seemed real.

164
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,364
I'll tell you what...

165
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:18,368
let's focus on finding Mardon and once
he's safely contained in the pipeline...

166
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,245
we'll investigate this.

167
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,254
- Where we at?
- No one saw anything.

168
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,757
We're canvassing known associates,
seeing if he reached out to anybody.

169
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,386
- Maybe we can get a lead on where he is.
- Why don't we let Thawne do that?

170
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,763
Nobody knows the Mardon brothers
better than I do.

171
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,641
Chyre and I tracked them for years.
I know how they think.

172
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,812
Which is why you should coordinate
the investigation from here.

173
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,240
Hey.

174
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,703
If you guys wanna keep that smile
on that pretty face...

175
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,580
she doesn't hear about any of this.

176
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,081
Mm-hm.

177
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,084
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad.

178
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,003
- Hi.
- Hey.

179
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,799
So, what are you guys working on?

180
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,093
You got any good leads
for an honest reporter?

181
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,471
Uh, things are actually
pretty quiet around here right now.

182
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,600
Ah.

183
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:24,966
Can you guys give me a minute?

184
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,478
Yeah, me and Barry
were gonna go grab lunch.

185
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,023
We were? Right. Yeah. Yeah.

186
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,525
Duh.

187
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,697
Hey. Ever since last night,
you've barely said a peep.

188
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,324
What is going on?

189
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,661
I didn't like the way I felt
watching you and Barry last night.

190
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,122
Eddie, Barry, he's just...

191
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,874
Like family. I know.

192
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:52,003
And I know you two have a long history that
predates me. But, Iris, we live together.

193
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,254
You're my girlfriend.

194
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:57,050
And someday, hopefully, you'll be more.

195
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:02,180
I don't like feeling like the odd man out
every time you and Barry are together.

196
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,349
- I shouldn't have to.
- Eddie...

197
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,019
- Barry's always gonna be a part of my life.
- I get that.

198
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,688
But something's changed between you two.

199
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,860
Whatever that is, I am not okay with it.

200
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:26,246
Mm. I haven't had one of those
in way too long.

201
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,164
It felt appropriate.

202
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,794
So you want to talk
about what's been going on with you?

203
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,422
- What do you think is going on with me?
- You seem a bit cavalier...

204
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,842
- considering what we're up against.
- We aren't up against anything.

205
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,844
- Joe, come on.
- Look, I'm fine.

206
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:45,056
- Can we just change the subject, please?
- Sure.

207
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,935
- Actually, I could use some advice.
- About what?

208
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:55,191
- Uh, you know, just relationship stuff.
- Oh, you mean like with that girl Linda?

209
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,361
No, actually. Um, with Iris.

210
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:03,283
Because things between us
have gotten a little complicated. Again.

211
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:10,498
You're asking your adopted father for advice
about being in love with his daughter...

212
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,376
who just so happens
to be dating his partner?

213
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:17,213
- I know. I know.
- Things have gone way past complicated.

214
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,799
Sometimes me and Iris
have these moments...

215
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,926
and when I'm looking into her eyes...

216
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,847
it's hard not to think
that she's feeling the same way I do.

217
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,725
Look, you already told Iris how you feel.

218
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,395
So unless she comes out
and says she feels the same way...

219
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:36,858
all you can do is hold on to those
moments. Man, it is coming down.

220
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,318
Yeah.

221
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,490
It's another beautiful day
here in Central City. Not a cloud...

222
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,244
Mardon.

223
00:13:48,268 --> 00:13:50,268
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

224
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,196
You're confined to the precinct
until Mardon's caught.

225
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,074
David, you said it,
that son of a bitch killed my partner.

226
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,701
And I'm not gonna lose you
the way I lost Fred Chyre.

227
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,205
Look, I can't stop you from being
pissed, Joe. But I can keep you safe.

228
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,208
Maybe your daughter can contact the Flash.

229
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,377
I'm not getting her involved in this.

230
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,214
Allen, make sure he doesn't go anywhere.

231
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,466
I need to be out there.

232
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:47,470
Joe, you're always the first one to tell me
when I'm not thinking clearly.

233
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,515
I took down Clyde.
I can take down his dirtbag brother too.

234
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,975
You didn't do that alone, remember?

235
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,561
You're right.

236
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,731
How are any of these guys
gonna protect me?

237
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,609
They don't know.
They don't know what Mardon's capable of.

238
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:05,238
All right, well, lucky for you,
your friends at S.T.A.R. Labs do.

239
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:20,169
"The Flash.
Speeding his way into our lives"?

240
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,005
That's a little on the
nose, don't you think?

241
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,174
I wanna show you something.

242
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:29,178
Simon Stagg. Remember him?
Hasn't been seen in, like, six months?

243
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:33,141
I thought the rumor was he was a recluse.
You know, went all Howard Hughes.

244
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,854
This was taken the night Stagg went missing.
The last person to leave Stagg Industries...

245
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,481
the night Stagg disappeared
was Harrison Wells.

246
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,944
- This doesn't prove anything, Mason.
- It's enough to develop a theory.

247
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:48,865
Every trail in this file leads
to one person: Harrison Wells.

248
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:53,035
Which is why I need for you to ask your
friends who know him some questions, Iris.

249
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,838
Linda.

250
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,673
Hi.

251
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,509
- Last night was fun.
- Mm-hm.

252
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,720
Oh, yeah.

253
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,806
Uh, look, I just wanted to apologize.

254
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,600
Apologize...?

255
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:20,062
Well, for interrupting your date
with Barry. I shouldn't have done that.

256
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,398
And I'm sorry.

257
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,693
You know, Iris...

258
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,404
when you told me
that Barry had feelings for you...

259
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:32,742
I thought it was just the typical
weird crap that women do to each other.

260
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:38,581
But last night I realized what you didn't
tell me, and what's kind of irritating...

261
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,918
Is that you have feelings for him too.

262
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,754
No, Linda, I mean, it's not like that.

263
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,715
One thing you learn about people
when you work here, Iris...

264
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,760
it's usually what isn't said
that's the real story.

265
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,271
Sounded like something
was bothering you on the phone.

266
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,441
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, it's fine.

267
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,736
- So the other night was fun, right?
- Yeah. Eddie have a good time?

268
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,948
- Yeah. Linda?
- I think so.

269
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,910
You don't think we were too, you know...?

270
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,788
- No.
- Okay, good.

271
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,708
So the reason that I called you was because
my sort-of-advisor at the paper...

272
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:26,587
Is always teaching me lessons, tricks
of the trade, how to get a good story.

273
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:30,967
And one of the things he's repeatedly
telling me is to follow your hunch.

274
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,261
- See where it leads.
- Sounds like good advice.

275
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,471
Yeah, it is.

276
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,684
Except, in this instance,
that hunch involves you.

277
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:44,438
Uh... Well, you can ask me anything, Iris.

278
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,983
It's about Harrison Wells.

279
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,694
What about him?

280
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,781
I mean, a lot of strange things have been
happening in Central City this past year.

281
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,742
The Flash. The Burning Man.
People going missing.

282
00:17:56,951 --> 00:18:00,788
He was there at Stagg's office
the night that Stagg went missing.

283
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:08,713
And you think that Dr. Wells
is what, responsible?

284
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,925
I mean, I don't really know him.
But you and your friends do.

285
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:16,971
Uh-huh.

286
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,599
Barry, in your heart of hearts...

287
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,518
do you think it's possible
there's more to Harrison...

288
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,229
than people have been led to believe?

289
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:28,941
Harrison Wells is a good man.

290
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:33,112
If you're looking for a story,
then you're not gonna find one with him.

291
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,200
I call it the Wizard's Wand.

292
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,829
- Subtle. How does it work?
- Just think of it like an active lightning rod.

293
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:46,667
Point it at the sky and it'll suck up whatever
energy's floating around it like a sponge.

294
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,878
- And it'll stop Mardon?
- It'll slow him down.

295
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,547
If there's no atmospheric electrons
available to him...

296
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:56,052
there's no way to control the weather.
Good work, Cisco. As always.

297
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,679
Excuse me. I'm gonna go stretch my legs.

298
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:06,062
You okay? You seem a little off.

299
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:11,734
Yeah, uh, somebody at Picture News
got it into Iris' head...

300
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:15,613
that something suspicious
is going on with Dr. Wells.

301
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,573
Like what?

302
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,825
That he knows what happened
to Simon Stagg.

303
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:24,330
Nobody has heard from him or seen
him since the night I stopped Danton Black.

304
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:28,376
- What did you tell her?
- That she's wrong. And she is.

305
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,011
Keep this handy.
It'll protect you from Mardon's powers.

306
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,513
Yes, Cisco. I got it.

307
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,516
Hey, Joe. Um, I know you
got a lot going on right now...

308
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,769
but you mentioned Dr. Wells
might've had something to do...

309
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,437
with Barry's mother's murder.

310
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,732
- Why did you think that?
- Doesn't matter. I was wrong.

311
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:56,862
- But you seemed really sure of it.
- Cisco, I can't talk about this right now, okay?

312
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,630
I heard you were looking for me.

313
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,136
Here I am.

314
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,976
- Mardon.
- Hey, Joe.

315
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,478
I can call you Joe, can't I?

316
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:34,358
Figured we don't gotta be too formal, seeing
as you put two bullets in my brother's chest.

317
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:38,571
Your brother killed my partner
and a whole lot of innocent people.

318
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,614
And threatened to kill even more.

319
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,327
Yeah, Clyde was no
saint, but he was family.

320
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:51,667
And if you can't protect your family,
the least you can do is avenge them.

321
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,506
This is between us.

322
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,467
Nobody else needs to get hurt.

323
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,011
But they are gonna get hurt.

324
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,516
- Joe!
- No.

325
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,603
I'm not gonna be so easy to put down, Joe.

326
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:11,937
Take him down!

327
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,024
No, run!

328
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,119
Joe!

329
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,643
Captain!

330
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:53,687
David.

331
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,158
All right, Cisco, I'm heading home.

332
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,244
Cisco?

333
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:13,249
All right, fine, I will watch every episode
of The Walking Dead with you.

334
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,542
Hey.

335
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,837
You couldn't have stopped Mardon
from attacking the police station.

336
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,588
It's not your fault.

337
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,549
No, that's not it.

338
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:25,094
- What do you think of Dr. Wells?
- What do you mean?

339
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:30,683
I mean, do you think he's capable
of doing something bad?

340
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:33,519
Is this because of what
Barry said he heard?

341
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,397
Since the accelerator exploded,
there's always someone...

342
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,191
- who's got it in for Dr. Wells.
- It's more than that.

343
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,237
Joe said that maybe Dr. Wells was
somehow involved in Barry's mother's death.

344
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,197
In her murder.

345
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,241
That's absurd.

346
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,285
Yeah, I know. And that's what I said.

347
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,745
And we proved that
that wasn't the case, but...

348
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,248
I'm just saying,
some things aren't adding up.

349
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,125
Like what, for example?

350
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,127
Come here. Look at this.

351
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,379
When we trapped the Reverse-Flash...

352
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,798
he escaped
because the containment system failed.

353
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,758
But I checked that data three times.

354
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,803
And the super-capacitors
were fully charged when he got out.

355
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:12,308
The numbers don't add up, Caitlin. No reason
the containment system should have failed.

356
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,810
I'm sure there's
a perfectly good explanation.

357
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:18,480
One perfectly good explanation
is that Wells did something to the trap.

358
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:22,484
Are you suggesting that Dr. Wells is in
league with the man in the yellow suit?

359
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,946
I mean, we all saw that thing
nearly kill him that night.

360
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,282
Yeah. Nearly.

361
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:34,788
Cisco, what you're saying
doesn't make any sense. That's crazy.

362
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:41,629
Can you keep Wells
out of S.T.A.R. Labs tomorrow morning?

363
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,973
Thank you, Barry.

364
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,350
Yeah.

365
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,603
This isn't how I thought
I'd finally meet David's coworkers.

366
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,105
He speaks very highly of you.

367
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:01,857
Really?

368
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:04,360
David's all bark.

369
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,654
A very loud bark. Heh.

370
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,701
- How is he, doctor?
- We're stabilizing him.

371
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,955
He's experiencing some paralysis
in his lower extremities.

372
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,374
- Oh, my God.
- The hardest thing to gauge...

373
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,793
is the extent of his
neurocognitive deficits.

374
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,462
So he may not be the same person
you remember.

375
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,006
Can I see him?

376
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,634
I am sorry. Visitation's for family only.

377
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,721
Being his fiancé makes him family, doctor.

378
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,391
Ah. Sure.

379
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,729
Will he be able to return to the force?

380
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:44,733
I'm actually not sure
he'll be able to walk again.

381
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,907
- Where are you going?
- I need to end this.

382
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,034
- Not by yourself.
- Yes, by myself.

383
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:58,330
I know him. I can find him.
I don't want anybody else getting hurt.

384
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:01,375
- Especially Iris and you.
- Iris is fi...

385
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,712
Mardon said he was going to avenge
his brother. That goes beyond me.

386
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,924
It goes all the way to you and her.
You stay with Iris...

387
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,385
and you keep her safe.

388
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,095
Do not leave her side.

389
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,556
Yeah, all right.

390
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,863
Hey, have you seen Iris West?

391
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,698
She went to see her dad.

392
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,450
- You're Barry Allen, right?
- Yeah.

393
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,828
Her friend/brother. Or
is that brother/friend?

394
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,998
- Friend is fine.
- I'm Mason Bridge.

395
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,834
Ah. You're the guy who thinks
Harrison Wells is a mad genius.

396
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:49,214
Oh, no, no, no. I never said he was crazy.
He's a sociopath and a liar, for sure.

397
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,050
Really?

398
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,509
You don't see it?

399
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:55,763
- All the time you two spend together?
- Excuse me?

400
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,515
Sometimes when I'm bored,
I follow him around.

401
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,559
For the most part, he keeps to himself...

402
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:03,062
except when he's meeting with you,
which he does a lot.

403
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,814
And then, one time,
he met up with Simon Stagg.

404
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:07,983
And then, poof, no more Simon Stagg.

405
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,986
So you're saying
Wells knows where Stagg is?

406
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:12,988
No, I'm saying Wells killed him.

407
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,991
Ah.

408
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:18,243
All right. Even if I believed you,
which I don't...

409
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:21,288
he's in a wheelchair.
How could he possibly have done that?

410
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:25,375
I have evidence in a secure digital file
that will explain everything.

411
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,587
What evidence?

412
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:33,300
Well, you'll just have to read about it
in the Sunday paper, like everybody else.

413
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:49,149
Let's see if you can tell me
what really went wrong that night.

414
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,472
Hey.

415
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,809
Joe.

416
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,062
Eddie. You shouldn't be here.

417
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,982
And you shouldn't be chasing
after Mardon alone, partner.

418
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:32,442
Did you find anything?

419
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,572
Not yet, but this was an old Mardon
brothers hideout about six years ago.

420
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,616
So it's a long shot, but...

421
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:43,745
- Listen, Eddie...
- Save it. I'm not leaving.

422
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:56,091
Hey, have you heard from Dad?
He's not answering his cell.

423
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:59,511
Uh, no. I haven't talked to him.

424
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,722
I'm starting to worry about him.

425
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,266
What are you doing home so early?

426
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:09,980
Um, I was looking for you, actually.
I just met your friend Mason.

427
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:12,608
And he said that he had...

428
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,944
some kind of proof
that Dr. Wells did something.

429
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:17,696
Do you know what it is?

430
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:19,907
No, he hasn't told me.

431
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:21,617
All right.

432
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:26,955
So how are things going with Linda?

433
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:29,166
- Why do you say it like that?
- Like what?

434
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,836
Like how you used to always say
"Becky Cooper."

435
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,297
Oh, come on. Becky Cooper...

436
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:39,301
was a nightmare of a high school girlfriend.
And you should've never dated her.

437
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,803
Okay, so you're saying that Linda
is Becky material?

438
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,639
I mean, I wouldn't go that far.

439
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:48,810
She's hot and nice and smart...

440
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,480
and she is really
good at her job. I just...

441
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,734
I don't think that she's
the right one for you.

442
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:01,156
Then who is?

443
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:16,838
What?

444
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,423
I don't understand.

445
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:22,219
This doesn't make any sense.

446
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,204
Somebody was here very recently.

447
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,460
He left this here for me.

448
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,463
Where to next?

449
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,594
Joe!

450
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,781
Small miracle
you only broke the one leg, Joe.

451
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,410
The night I got sucked out of my plane...

452
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:31,246
I broke almost every bone in my body.

453
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,416
That was excruciating.

454
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:37,252
At least you got a small taste
of what that felt like.

455
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:42,716
Still, I guess you'll never know
what it really feels like to be God.

456
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,886
That's what your brother said to me
right before I killed him.

457
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,642
I don't need these powers to end your life.

458
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:57,522
Then do it.
That's what you came here for, isn't it?

459
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,483
An eye for an eye.

460
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:01,276
Oh, Joe.

461
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:06,448
I want so much more than an eye.

462
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:10,118
I forget how important it is...

463
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,746
to step away from my
ever-present routine. Thank you.

464
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:15,248
This morning has been a refreshing
change of pace.

465
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:19,544
You can have more than two
hard-boiled eggs for breakfast, Dr. Wells.

466
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,963
What can I say?
I guess I'm a creature of habit.

467
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,799
Sorry, I believe these were to go.

468
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:27,010
Actually, I thought we could sit here
and enjoy them.

469
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:32,974
Why not?

470
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:35,310
We've seen what Mardon can do.

471
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,022
But do not forget, he is not invincible.

472
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,066
- He's still a man.
- I can't believe this.

473
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,568
- At best, a criminal.
- We'll find him.

474
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,654
- And we will find this dirtbag...
- Hey.

475
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:47,781
Look at me, all right?

476
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,575
I promise, I'll bring him back to you.

477
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,494
- Whatever you need to do...
- Okay.

478
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:56,832
I need you all to scour this city
until we find Joe.

479
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,336
Move out.

480
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:07,551
Hello?

481
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,678
I have your father.

482
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:13,348
He's a little broken, but still alive.

483
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:18,186
If you want him to stay that way,
come to the waterfront, south side.

484
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,563
Oh, and, Iris.

485
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:23,316
You tell the police, your father's dead.

486
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,696
She's on her way.

487
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,577
He has my dad.

488
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:38,623
If I tell anyone, he'll kill him.
He wants to meet at the waterfront.

489
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,625
- All right, I'm coming with you.
- Okay.

490
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,085
Let's go.

491
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,631
- Barry. Um, can I talk to you for a second?
- Hey.

492
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:48,967
Linda, I'm sorry. I really can't right now.

493
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,470
- Of course not.
- Look, it's not like that.

494
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,431
It's an emergency. I have to go right now.

495
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,312
You know, Dr. Wells, I just...

496
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:05,984
I wanna thank you again
for all that you've done for Ronnie.

497
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,029
One thank-you will suffice, I'm sure.

498
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,413
You know, Caitlin...

499
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:22,876
if Cisco were to adjust
the radial velocity parameters...

500
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,753
of the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite...

501
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,797
we might be able to better detect
the vortex of a storm.

502
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,717
If we could detect those air updrafts...

503
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,261
no matter where they originate,
no matter how small...

504
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,430
we might be able to locate Mark Mardon.

505
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,891
That's a great idea.

506
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:41,394
So why don't we go to S.T.A.R. Labs
and alert Cisco?

507
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:45,106
Let me just get these to go.

508
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:55,325
Hi. Could I get these in to-go cups?

509
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:56,826
Sure, just a second.

510
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:08,922
My goals are beyond your understanding.

511
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:21,017
Dr. Wells, we meet at last.

512
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,812
My goals are beyond your understanding.

513
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:25,647
I can't believe this.

514
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,525
Oh, I'm not like the Flash at all.

515
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,946
Some would say I'm the Reverse.

516
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:41,746
Congratulations, Joe.
You're my plus-one today.

517
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:47,544
Front-row seats to watch everyone
and everything you ever loved destroyed.

518
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,547
Pretty girl too.

519
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,550
Such a shame.

520
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,511
Please, she's my daughter.

521
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,722
- Clyde was my brother.
- He's a thief...

522
00:34:58,972 --> 00:35:01,975
and a murderer. She's an innocent girl.

523
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,477
She'll pay for the
sins of her father, then.

524
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,522
They'll all pay.

525
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:18,366
You're incredibly clever, Cisco.

526
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,493
I've always said so.

527
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,121
You're him.

528
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,416
The Reverse-Flash.

529
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,544
You and I have never been truly
properly introduced.

530
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:34,132
I am Eobard Thawne.

531
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,509
Thawne?

532
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,304
Like Eddie.

533
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,474
Let's call him a distant relative.

534
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,103
The night that we trapped
the Reverse-Flash...

535
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,564
you almost died.

536
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:50,899
Mm-hm.

537
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,651
There were two of you.

538
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,373
It's an afterimage.

539
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,918
A speed mirage, if you will.

540
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,633
Joe was right.

541
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:22,180
You were there that night 15 years ago.

542
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,349
In Barry's house.

543
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:27,602
You killed Nora Allen.

544
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:31,481
It was never my intention to kill Nora.

545
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,983
I was there to kill Barry.

546
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,278
Why?

547
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:41,574
You're his friend.
You've been teaching him how to...

548
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:45,578
Go faster. I know. A means to an end.

549
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,789
And I'll tell you why.

550
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:51,835
Because I have been stuck here...

551
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:58,758
marooned here in this place
for 15 long years.

552
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,719
And the Flash...

553
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,971
and the Flash's speed...

554
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:05,098
Is the key...

555
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:08,852
to my returning to my world.

556
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,896
To my time.

557
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:18,027
And no one
is going to prevent that from happening.

558
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:23,241
I can help you.

559
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,411
You're smart, Cisco.

560
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,665
But you're not that smart.

561
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:34,753
Do you know...

562
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:41,760
how hard it has been to keep all of this
from you, especially from you?

563
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,512
Because the truth is...

564
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,641
I've grown quite fond of you.

565
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:53,938
And in many ways, you have shown me...

566
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,025
what it's like to have a son.

567
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,699
Forgive me.

568
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:07,160
But to me, you've been dead for centuries.

569
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:28,431
- What do we do?
- He'll find us.

570
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:30,892
Oh, my God.

571
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:37,565
You need to get out of here.
Get as far away from here as possible.

572
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:38,942
- I'm not leaving.
- Please.

573
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,402
Listen. Since the night
you told me how you felt...

574
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:43,947
I have not been able
to stop thinking about you.

575
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:46,324
At first, I was really mad.

576
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,744
Then I realized that the reason
I couldn't stop thinking about you...

577
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:52,247
was because I didn't want to.

578
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,960
I've never stopped thinking about you.

579
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,160
- Caitlin.
- Barry, I need to talk to you.

580
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,455
- It's Dr. Wells. He's...
- No time for that right now, all right?

581
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,458
There is a tsunami heading for the city.

582
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:38,793
How do I stop it?

583
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:43,965
Theoretically, if you can create a vortex
barrier along the coastline, a wall of wind...

584
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,467
that would sap the tidal wave
of its energy...

585
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,470
- before it hits the city.
- By running back and forth.

586
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:50,680
How fast?

587
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,891
I don't know if you can run that fast.

588
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,352
I am so sorry.

589
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,980
I didn't want you to find out this way.

590
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:04,736
Go.

591
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:27,694
Taxi! Taxi! Oh, come on, I'm gonna be late.

592
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:30,154
Oh, boy.

593
00:41:30,178 --> 00:41:38,178
