1
00:00:02,128 --> 00:00:03,588
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:04,922
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:08,593
I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:11,262
Today, I fight that war on two fronts.

5
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:14,265
By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.

6
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:16,017
But by night, I'm someone else.

7
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:17,810
I am something else.

8
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:20,771
I am the Green Arrow.

9
00:00:21,898 --> 00:00:23,149
Previously on Arrow...

10
00:00:25,276 --> 00:00:27,570
You are not going to be Bratva Captain
for much longer.

11
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:31,407
Susan Williams. She's suspecting
that Oliver's the Green Arrow.

12
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:32,575
What are we gonna do?

13
00:00:32,742 --> 00:00:34,928
Hack into her computer,
and find out what's there and delete it?

14
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:35,953
- She has...
- Everything.

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,957
Apparently, I have been plagiarizing
my stories for the past two years.

16
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:43,544
And my laptop is filled
with incriminating evidence.

17
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:46,589
But now, I've been thoroughly discredited.

18
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:50,301
Did you hack Susan Williams' computer?

19
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:52,362
Thea asked me to put a few things
on Susan's computer and...

20
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,388
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Thea asked you?

21
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:58,100
The Mayor's Office ordered
the falsification of autopsy reports

22
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:01,145
to protect the identity
of Detective Malone's Killer.

23
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:03,856
If any of these allegations prove true,

24
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:06,776
it would likely trigger impeachment
proceedings led by the Mayor's...

25
00:01:06,943 --> 00:01:09,487
This might be
the end of my administration.

26
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:16,160
When did you learn
the Green Arrow killed Detective Malone?

27
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:18,329
Why did you protect the Green Arrow?

28
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:20,164
We have no comment at this time,

29
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:23,251
but we will have
something for you shortly. Thanks.

30
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:29,465
I've called in every favor I could.
I still don't know how this got leaked.

31
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:31,842
We know how it got leaked.

32
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:35,346
It's Prometheus.

33
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:37,390
He sent the ACU after me
as the Green Arrow,

34
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,201
and now,
he is coming after me as the Mayor.

35
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:41,119
For something he set you up for
in the first place.

36
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,687
Nobody's saying the guy isn't smart.

37
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,940
We're just gonna have to be smarter.
What's the plan, boss?

38
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:47,191
We don't have a plan yet,

39
00:01:47,692 --> 00:01:51,654
but if we lose this office,
then Prometheus wins.

40
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:54,341
I just realized,
am I allowed to be in here?

41
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:56,075
Usually, the detail stands outside.

42
00:01:56,242 --> 00:01:57,451
Better go blend in.

43
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,245
Okay, well, on the political front,

44
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:01,956
I think the plan should be to deny,
deflect, obfuscate...

45
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:04,559
- That's just gonna confuse people...
- Yeah, but that's the point.

46
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:08,212
What if we tell the truth?
A version of the truth.

47
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:12,967
"The Green Arrow is a good guy
and I gave him the benefit of the doubt."

48
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:14,454
You know what, it worked on Pike.

49
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:17,239
I'll tell the vultures
you're gonna be making a statement.

50
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:19,473
Okay, do you want me to write you a draft?

51
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,618
No, I'll write it.
I need you to handle something for me.

52
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,643
Okay.

53
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,187
- You need to make things right with Susan.
- Ollie...

54
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,815
You got her fired
under false pretenses, Thea.

55
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:31,068
Only because I was trying to protect you,
which is what I'm doing now.

56
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,031
- Yes, Adrian.
- Mr. Mayor.

57
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:36,824
What's this?

58
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:40,328
My letter of resignation, in which I take
sole responsibility for the cover-up.

59
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,121
- No.
- The cover-up was my idea.

60
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,998
I approved it. I'm the Mayor.

61
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:47,960
And if this impeachment proceeding
goes the way that I think it will,

62
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,337
not for long.

63
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:02,391
The Council has broad powers to run
impeachment hearings as it sees fit.

64
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:05,394
It calls its own witnesses,
enters its own evidence,

65
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,563
they take a vote, majority rules.

66
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,273
But Oliver can't defend himself?

67
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,400
It's not a criminal trial.

68
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,944
The Council needs a pound of flesh,
and I'm volunteering.

69
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,447
- And I've already said no.
- Yeah, I'm persistent.

70
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:20,868
I have a better idea.
Be my lawyer at the hearings.

71
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,620
- Mr. Mayor...
- It's "Oliver".

72
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:25,581
And I'm not your boss anymore,

73
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,375
I'm your client.

74
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,383
I have many reasons for killing Anatoly.

75
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,803
Biggest is his poisoning Bratva
with American scum.

76
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:15,840
Fine.

77
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:19,135
What?

78
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,098
Take them.

79
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,393
What'd you do?

80
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,812
Extend our lives by length of good movie.

81
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:41,449
All right, lady, do your thing.

82
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,245
That was not your thing.

83
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:49,123
Boss is getting impeached
and you're down here playing marbles?

84
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,475
Actually, this was your idea.

85
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,685
You're the one who encouraged me
to lean into

86
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:52,853
the strengths with my tech, remember?

87
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:54,438
You said that.
We were walking down the alley,

88
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:55,605
you were like,
"Lean into your strengths... ".

89
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,773
- You literally said that!
- I didn't...

90
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:00,050
Anyway. These are two inventions of mine,

91
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,386
two autonomous mini-drones.

92
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:05,723
One with offensive,
and the other with defensive capabilities.

93
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,392
So, what,
you can't handle yourself on the field,

94
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,228
you've gotta give yourself
a pair of balls?

95
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:14,565
That was... That was too harsh, wasn't it?

96
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:17,818
You think? Yeah, it was,
but, you know what? You recognized it.

97
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,571
- Yeah, 'cause I'm trying to work on...
- Yeah, that's progress.

98
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:24,074
Anyway, Paul's big problem
with me being Mr. Terrific

99
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,618
was the fact that he was worried.

100
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,464
But now, he doesn't have to worry
with these bad boys in my arsenal.

101
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:31,040
Sounds like you got
the emotional logic all figured out.

102
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:32,374
I do.

103
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,503
Now, if I can just get
these damn things to work.

104
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,923
News of the cover-up sent shockwaves
through City Hall,

105
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:42,885
forcing Council members into enacting
a rarely-used impeachment clause.

106
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,846
Mayor Oliver Queen's administration
might be over.

107
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,413
That woman never reports good news.

108
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:50,851
It'll work out.
I'm just waiting for my opening.

109
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:52,353
There's that optimism again.

110
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,605
Chase is representing me,
so I'm gonna beat this.

111
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:58,067
How are we doing with the
data pull from Prometheus' mother's house?

112
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,736
The sniffer pulled about
a petabyte worth of data,

113
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,905
it's like looking for
a needle in a haystack,

114
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:04,740
- but I am working on it.
- Good.

115
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:07,052
There's something else
that I could use your help with.

116
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:08,244
- Okay.
- Susan Williams.

117
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,079
- Oh.
- She's not returning my calls.

118
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:13,123
Am I really the best person
to come to for love-life advice?

119
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,560
She's not returning my calls
since you and Thea got her fired.

120
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,896
Well, in my defense, I didn't know
that was gonna be Thea's play.

121
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,173
I know, but I still need your help
because Thea is not budging.

122
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:27,221
Look, I know how severely problematic
what I'm about to say is,

123
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:32,977
but Susan is your girlfriend,
so, if anyone is going to fix it,

124
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,743
- I think it has to be you.
- I'm trying,

125
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:36,581
but like I said,
she's not returning my calls,

126
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:37,815
and you may have noticed,

127
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:39,817
I'm sort of facing an impeachment
this week.

128
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:46,323
- Okay. Yeah, I'll do my best.
- Thank you very much.

129
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:48,534
Um...

130
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:49,994
For what it's worth,

131
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:53,455
and everything I know about politics
I got from Keepin' it 1600,

132
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,267
but I do think
you're gonna beat this thing.

133
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,458
What makes you so sure?

134
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,628
To Star City,
Mayor Oliver Queen is a hero.

135
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,483
Bang.

136
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:28,365
This marks only the second time
in the 140-year history of this city

137
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,618
that a mayor has faced impeachment.

138
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:34,038
In 1898, Mayor Prescott
was removed from office.

139
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:38,959
We'll see what fate awaits Oliver Queen,
who's stepping into the building now.

140
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,049
Hey, I'll catch you up there, all right?

141
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,013
- Hi, Susan.
- Sorry, busy reporting for my new blog.

142
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:52,505
I'm sorry, I've been trying...

143
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,434
My first entry will be about
how you never took this job seriously.

144
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:59,480
As Mayor, you've just phoned it in.
You'll only ever be that other guy.

145
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,565
But, of course,
I can't write that

146
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:04,818
because no one will believe me
now that you've trashed my credibility.

147
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,867
I had nothing to do with that,
but I am working

148
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:09,144
- to make it right, I'm...
- Whatever. You deserve today.

149
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,914
Hey, so, what do you think
Oliver's chances are?

150
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:19,249
Come to order.

151
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,335
We're about to find out.

152
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,630
We recently learned
that Detective William Malone

153
00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:28,967
was murdered by the vigilante
known as the Green Arrow.

154
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:34,098
It appears
that the Mayor knew some time ago,

155
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:38,936
and actively worked to hide the fact,
even from the SCPD.

156
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:42,356
Today, the Council considers
two grave questions.

157
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:47,778
Did Oliver Queen's actions
violate the oath he took faithfully

158
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,197
to serve Star City?

159
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:55,452
And should he therefore be
removed as Mayor?

160
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,122
- Hell to the no!
- What he said.

161
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:01,458
It's Paul. Should I take it?

162
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,752
I'm not gonna take it.
Maybe I should take it.

163
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,004
No, no. Okay, I'll take it.

164
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,382
- Hey.
- This is so completely unfair.

165
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,229
Yeah, that seems to be
going around lately.

166
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,404
So, you got Oliver's girlfriend fired?

167
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:13,780
He told you? Of course he told you.

168
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,524
Well, did he also tell you
it was a mistake?

169
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,196
- I mean, on my part at least?
- Felicity.

170
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,660
I'm putting the toothpaste
back in the tube, okay?

171
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:19,828
- And how is that going?
- Well...

172
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:21,788
- Felicity, what's going on with you?
- What do you mean?

173
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:22,956
This week it was Oliver's girlfriend.

174
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,249
Last month,
he tells me you're getting involved

175
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:25,417
in some stuff
you shouldn't be involved in?

176
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:26,668
Well, that is a matter of perspective

177
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:29,012
considering that that "stuff"
helped get you out of prison,

178
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,549
- and General Walker's gun-sights.
- What're you talking about?

179
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:36,952
"Pandora"?

180
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:39,431
It's a data cache compiled
by a group of hacktivists called Helix.

181
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:41,725
They collect electronic dirt
on literally billions of people,

182
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:43,083
including General Walker.

183
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,711
So, when I asked for it
to get you off, they...

184
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:47,379
That's a bad choice of words.

185
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:50,174
They gave me the whole package.

186
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,735
And you're still in bed with these people.

187
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,486
What? You make it sound like
it's a bad thing.

188
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,845
Pandora's just a tool.

189
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,364
Sounds to me like this could be a weapon.

190
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,056
Okay. And is there a problem if it is?

191
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,267
- It depends, Felicity.
- On what?

192
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,810
On how you use it.

193
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,858
My autopsy showed that
mortal injury on the deceased

194
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:10,905
was consistent with the edging of
the arrowheads used by the Green Arrow.

195
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,822
I have here,
your original Cause of Death Report,

196
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:17,701
in which you conclude
that the Green Arrow killed Malone,

197
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:21,371
but this report,
it was never included in the case file.

198
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:22,581
Why is that?

199
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:24,374
The DA came to me, and I...

200
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,668
You're referring to Adrian Chase?

201
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,629
That's correct.

202
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:31,548
He instructed me to revise the report
to indicate

203
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,884
that the Throwing Star Killer
was responsible.

204
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:35,594
This report.

205
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:39,306
And you went ahead and signed it,
even though you knew it was fake,

206
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,767
and then passed it along to the police.

207
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:43,227
Is that the case?

208
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,437
- Yes.
- Why?

209
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:47,981
Did Mr. Chase threaten you?

210
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,567
He didn't have to.

211
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,488
He said the request came
from the Mayor himself.

212
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:57,825
The Mayor?

213
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:01,161
Yes, he told me
the Green Arrow killed Detective Malone.

214
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,705
And did Mayor Queen say why?

215
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,401
He said the Throwing Star Killer,

216
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,876
a man we've been calling Prometheus,
manipulated him.

217
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:10,045
Did he say why this Prometheus

218
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,714
would wanna orchestrate
Detective Malone's murder?

219
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:13,882
No.

220
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:17,469
Standing here today, do you believe
what Mr. Queen has told you?

221
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,100
Honestly, I'm not sure.

222
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:27,187
He's clearly been determined to protect
the Green Arrow for his own purposes.

223
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:30,816
I think the question here is, why?

224
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,156
Coming through.

225
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,330
Who's most in our corner?

226
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,350
- Pollard, believe it, or not.
- That's not surprising.

227
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,060
She can't call in the marker
I owe her for helping

228
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:50,564
with the gun reform if I'm impeached.

229
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:51,795
I'll touch base with her,

230
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:54,723
see if I can get her to call you
to testify in your own defense, okay?

231
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:08,562
Okay, well, I...
I have a very political idea.

232
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:09,813
I'm listening.

233
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:14,610
Like Adrian said, the Council needs
somebody thrown to the wolves,

234
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,445
and I think it should be Malone.

235
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:17,654
- Theal!
- What?

236
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:21,158
Half the SCPD is corrupt,
so, it's not hard to believe.

237
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:25,996
And he is no longer with us,
so, he wouldn't really mind.

238
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:29,499
That way, the cover-up is
no longer about the Green Arrow,

239
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:34,046
it becomes about protecting Malone's
reputation for the sake of his family.

240
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,048
Now you're gonna
destroy his reputation. No.

241
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,300
- But, Ollie...
- Thea, it's not even a question.

242
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,637
Okay.

243
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,056
How do we think the Council's gonna vote?

244
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:47,851
It's a pretty even split
with Kullens as the swing vote.

245
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:01,448
Hold on!

246
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:16,088
My target's the Mayor and his corruption.

247
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,341
He surrenders,
I'll let the rest of you live.

248
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,386
Good man.

249
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:27,724
Good woman.

250
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:31,061
Hey, hey, get to safety, get to safety.

251
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:34,314
- Quentin, the driver!
- Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.

252
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:58,255
You want me? Come on!

253
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,848
Lucky you. You get one more day.

254
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,611
Okay, all right.

255
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,822
Look, I appreciate what you're doing,
but I'm fine.

256
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,615
Mr. Mayor, all due respect,

257
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:29,119
your head's bleeding and our concussion
protocol's even stricter than the NFL's.

258
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,788
Well, I'm the Mayor, so I'm suspending it.

259
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,958
The, uh. Your driver, he's okay.

260
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,436
Yeah, he took a hit on his shoulder,

261
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,187
and he's got a bump on the head,
but he's fine.

262
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,089
And before you ask, he didn't see you turn
all Bruce Lee back there.

263
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,633
- Where's Dinah?
- She's doing her job, working the scene.

264
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,480
All right, I gotta get to the Bunker, I...

265
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:46,887
- Oh, boy.
- Easy, Ollie.

266
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,930
You know
there's a concussion protocol, right?

267
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,265
Yeah, so I've heard.

268
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,350
- This was Vigilante?
- Yeah.

269
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:56,480
Apparently, because of the
impeachment hearing, I'm a criminal.

270
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,816
- You okay?
- Oh. Never felt better.

271
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:06,156
Hey, so, I made sure the unis keep
all the press behind the cordon.

272
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:09,493
Trust me, you don't want them
snapping shots of you in an ambulance.

273
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:10,827
Yeah, no ambulance.

274
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,139
But I'm tougher than I look.
I'm gonna get back to the office.

275
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,403
Where have I heard that before?

276
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,875
Hey, look, while under threat
of the impeachment,

277
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,920
you can't exactly amend by-laws,
so that concussion protocol?

278
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,254
Yeah, it's a thing.

279
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,924
It's okay, Ollie,
I can go back to the office

280
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:26,051
and tell everyone
we're gonna be working overtime.

281
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:30,180
Plus, I'm never getting into a limo
with you again.

282
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:38,146
Oliver's on his way to Starling General,
but don't worry, he'll be fine.

283
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:39,993
I heard shots were fired on the motorcade.

284
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,566
Yeah, flipped our limo in the air.

285
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,860
- Cool.
- Not "cool," more like "ow,"

286
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,445
and Oliver might be concussed.

287
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:48,323
But in the meantime,
there's still the Vigilante out there.

288
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,634
Okay, Rene and I
are gonna hit the streets,

289
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:52,136
see if we can't muscle the Vigilante's
whereabouts out of some people.

290
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,430
Curtis, let's check the Key Hole satellite
and CC thermal cams.

291
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,956
Actually, hold on. I need a favor.

292
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,101
Okay, if this is about Susan Williams,
I'm already on it.

293
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,168
No, it's about the impeachment.

294
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:03,046
You said that Pandora
has dirt on a lot of people, right?

295
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,608
Yeah, if by "a lot of people,"
you mean "everybody," then, yeah.

296
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:06,832
What about Councilman Kullens?

297
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,236
Last time I checked,
he's part of "everybody."

298
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,386
- Why?
- You know why.

299
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:10,595
Oh. Oh!

300
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,098
You wanna blackmail him?

301
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:16,935
No. It's not blackmail, it's politics.

302
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,249
In the wake of the attack,
Councilman Kullens

303
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:23,900
has called a brief recess
to the impeachment hearings.

304
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:26,751
If the Mayor is medically cleared,
the Council will vote tomorrow.

305
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:28,071
Okay.

306
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,408
Well, sounds like you need a note
from your doctor, Mr. Mayor.

307
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:34,202
This is ridiculous,
I know what real injury feels like.

308
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:37,414
I can only imagine, given your other job.

309
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,333
And you're right, your CAT scan is clear.

310
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,878
- Good.
- Uh-uh-uh. Not so fast.

311
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:46,047
Look, I can't discharge you without
a few more hours of observation.

312
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,340
Doctor Schwartz...

313
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,177
People can withstand only so much strain.

314
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,680
And being both Mayor and him,
it's unsustainable.

315
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,348
I assure you, my body can handle it.

316
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,852
I'm not talking about your body,
Mr. Queen.

317
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,437
I'm talking about this.

318
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:02,522
The mind needs rest,

319
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:06,818
or at least someone to take your thoughts
off all the evil you face each day.

320
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:10,447
Doctor Schwartz,
are you prescribing me a girlfriend?

321
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:12,490
Or just a friend.

322
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:34,137
Hi, this is Susan.
I can't come to the phone...

323
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,812
"Demand an exam"?

324
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,564
Yeah, it rhyme better in Russian.

325
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:49,152
Spros dopros is Bratva way
to call Pakhan to account for actions.

326
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,739
Captains all listen,
maybe Pakhan lose position.

327
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,324
That's good news!

328
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:57,011
That's good. That means we can
overthrow Gregor without a fight.

329
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:00,080
No. Everybody knows about
Gregor's deal with Kovar.

330
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,998
No, no, we still end up dead.

331
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:05,502
Men who call, vote, are killed
if Pakhan keeps position.

332
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:06,753
Anatoly, why bother?

333
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,506
I did not want to die
in hospital basement.

334
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,008
That's... Fair.

335
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:16,012
Look, all we have to do is find evidence
that Gregor's deal with Kovar

336
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:18,139
benefits him and not the Bratva.

337
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,946
Yes, but where are we going to find that?

338
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:23,853
I have to go.

339
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,691
Code says you have one hour to finalize
personal affairs before Spros dopros.

340
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:28,858
I can do that.

341
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,836
But you must have Captain with you,
who is not me.

342
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,028
I'll lose him.

343
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,864
I'm really good at losing people.

344
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,836
I've got bullet fragments and casings
coming out of my ass,

345
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:49,421
but nothing new.

346
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,717
All right, I'll catch you back downtown.

347
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,684
Hey, Johnson,
gotta make room for a tow truck.

348
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,238
- Anything?
- Nada.

349
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:18,050
Peeps on the street are actually
more afraid of the Vigilante than us.

350
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,075
What about you?

351
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,828
Vigilante changes artillery supplier
every week.

352
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,079
Every lead goes cold.

353
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:24,966
We could really use
a break right about now.

354
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,125
I think I got something.

355
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:29,103
Yes! I totally manifested that!
What do you got?

356
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:33,965
When my sonic cry hit Vigilante,
it knocked off a small piece of his visor.

357
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,068
It looks like it's lined
with some kind of circuitry.

358
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,236
Well, that means it's manufactured.

359
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,904
Maybe I can link to back
to where he bought it from.

360
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,072
I think I can do you one better.

361
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,616
My T-Spheres can actually track the tech
to the individual user.

362
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:45,047
Except they won't be ready
till the iPhone 16 is released.

363
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,103
- Ye, of little faith...
- What's a T-Sphere?

364
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,313
Curtis' balls.

365
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,275
They're something really fascinating,
and of my own personal invention.

366
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,985
I realized that quantum computation

367
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,047
- could be used to...
- All right, yeah, forget I asked.

368
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,697
I'll bring you guys the visor, okay?

369
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,992
Copy that, we're here.
Curtis, this is on you now.

370
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,285
Challenge accepted.

371
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,638
Hey, seriously, man,
what's up with your balls?

372
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,849
I mean, you were literally gonna
throw those things in the trash.

373
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:10,001
Paul called, asked me to dinner.
Like, a date.

374
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,670
Like, I'm gonna get my man back.

375
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,690
I told you, hoss,
some piece of tech ain't gonna...

376
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,050
Look, I know Paul,

377
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:22,305
he wouldn't be asking me to go out
to dinner if he wasn't ready to reconcile.

378
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,398
Personal call?

379
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,276
Uh, yeah, I had a family emergency.
I'm sorry.

380
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:38,196
Don't be. Family's important.

381
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,492
Hey, why don't I log that in for you?

382
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,494
So you can handle your emergency.

383
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,037
Uh...

384
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,040
Don't worry, I'll take good care of this.

385
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,671
And, uh, I hope everything's okay
with your family.

386
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,648
- Oliver Queen is mine.
- Not if I kill him first.

387
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,319
Yes.

388
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:03,072
I'd like to report a sighting
of Vigilante.

389
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,575
This is District Attorney Chase.

390
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,689
Hey, Oliver's out of the hospital,
headed to City Hall.

391
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:19,923
Any word from Dinah?

392
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:23,129
Um, she's at the precinct, trying to
recover that piece of Vigilante's visor.

393
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,053
What about you, Felicity?

394
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:29,933
And don't tell me that it's traffic cams,
we both know they're on autopilot.

395
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,395
I sent Thea something
to sway Councilman Kullens.

396
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,624
Apparently, he's the swing vote
on Oliver's impeachment.

397
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:37,649
Pandora?

398
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:39,776
Officially, his wife died in a car crash.

399
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:42,111
Unofficially, she crashed the car
on purpose.

400
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,280
- Suicide?
- He used his clout to cover it up,

401
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,133
so I'm guessing
he's not gonna want it uncovered.

402
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:48,117
And you are okay with this, right?

403
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,328
I think the city needs Oliver
to keep being Mayor.

404
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:53,414
Felicity, Kullens is not a criminal,
he's a human being.

405
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,267
He's a politician,
that's hardly the same thing.

406
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,451
A human being that went through
a very tragic accident,

407
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:59,337
a very private one.

408
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,005
Come on, this isn't you.

409
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:03,132
Well, it pretty much is.

410
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:07,470
Okay, do you know what your superpower is?

411
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:10,181
- Computers?
- Empathy.

412
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,352
Big, reflexive, pure empathy.

413
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,729
- Well, maybe I'm fresh out.
- Because of Billy.

414
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:21,317
It's a dark world.

415
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:23,152
And for the past four years,

416
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,823
I have watched you and Oliver
and Laurel and Thea and Roy,

417
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,801
I've watched all of you
use a little darkness to fight it.

418
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:30,660
That's true.

419
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:33,371
Sometimes, we do fight fire with fire,

420
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:36,082
but every time we do, Felicity,
every single time,

421
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,377
we risk being burned.

422
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,277
Well, some days, I can't help but feel

423
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:48,261
as if this city
wants to collapse in on itself,

424
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,268
and all we're doing is
delaying the inevitable.

425
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,015
No, we're preventing it.

426
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,993
We're the good guys,
don't you forget that, all right?

427
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:57,145
Whack-a-mole.
We got Prometheus, the Vigilante.

428
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:59,981
And the one wild card I thought
maybe might be on our side,

429
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:01,649
Just murdered a cop.

430
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:03,985
- Nah, the Green Arrow got played.
- I don't know.

431
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:06,487
What I do know is
the next Mayor owes me a raise.

432
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:10,241
Yeah, I'll put in a word with Mayor Queen.
He's not impeached yet.

433
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:11,576
All right.

434
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:19,943
Please tell me you didn't send it.

435
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:24,213
The thing with Kullens' wife,
he doesn't deserve that.

436
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,841
- Felicity told you, didn't she?
- Thea...

437
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:29,135
I haven't sent the email, okay?

438
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:33,348
Ollie, don't look at me like that,
it's politics!

439
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,018
There's about to be a vote,
so it's time to play hardball.

440
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:39,020
This isn't hardball, this is cruel.

441
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:41,397
What would be cruel is
the people of this city

442
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:42,774
not having you as the Mayor.

443
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,068
The Anti-Crime Unit,

444
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:48,154
low-income housing,
commonsense gun legislation.

445
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:51,074
Ollie, in the short amount of time
you've been doing this,

446
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,909
you've done a remarkable job.

447
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:56,663
Please, just let me do what I have to do
to help you keep doing that.

448
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,706
Felicity told me about this Kullens thing

449
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:00,708
because of something
that John said to her.

450
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:05,505
Thea, when you fight fire with fire,
you are probably gonna get burned.

451
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:08,716
I won't. It'll be fine.

452
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:10,051
Like it was with Susan?

453
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:15,473
You destroyed her career,
now you've graduated to blackmail.

454
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:19,602
Where does it stop?

455
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,001
Magic hands.

456
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,922
The magnetic resonance frequencies
within Vigilante's tech

457
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,383
are now communicating with my T-Spheres.

458
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,010
Great. So what does it mean?

459
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:36,220
Can we catch the Vigilante, or not?

460
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:41,476
Well, cross your fingers
and your toes.

461
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,359
It's working!

462
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:53,046
The T-Sphere's picking up on the signal
from the piece of visor!

463
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,700
Yeah, but the other one's still wonky.

464
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:58,868
No, no, it's not.

465
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:00,995
It's actually tracking
the rest of the visor.

466
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:03,039
- Let's take down this SOB.
- Without Oliver?

467
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:06,086
If Vigilante gets to him, we'll be
doing this without Oliver permanently.

468
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,710
- Let's suit up.
- Suit up!

469
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:10,317
Oh. Sorry, I thought since Oliver's gone,
I would, probably...

470
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:12,215
But it makes more sense probably for you...

471
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,501
I'll make sure I'll work on
the timing there. Promise.

472
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:19,555
- Balls.
- My. T-Spheres. Don't call 'em "balls."

473
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:27,730
You speak with Pollard?

474
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:30,691
She won't call you to testify
without Kullens' blessing.

475
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:31,901
We're not gonna get that.

476
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:33,668
And the Council hearing directly
from you

477
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:35,631
is only one of two ways
I can see us winning this thing.

478
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:37,532
- What's the second way?
- You won't like it.

479
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,826
Does it involve
offering up a sacrificial lamb?

480
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,828
Either me, or Detective Malone.

481
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:46,082
Oliver, this impeachment
is about punishing someone,

482
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:47,569
and if you don't offer up a name,

483
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,908
this'll be the last time
you're looking out that window.

484
00:27:53,965 --> 00:27:56,759
If the Council is not gonna let me
testify at the hearing,

485
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,220
then I need to take my case
directly to the public.

486
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:01,222
- A press conference?
- Yeah.

487
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:03,641
Mind filling me in on
who you're throwing under the bus?

488
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,898
The Green Arrow.

489
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:30,918
Right here.

490
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:33,880
And, stop.

491
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:39,218
- Dude, we got him?
- I think so.

492
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:41,429
- Oh. This is bad.
- Why is that?

493
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:43,365
The building that
you just stopped in front of?

494
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,549
Well, City Hall is located
directly behind it, offering

495
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,578
perfect line-of-sight to where
Oliver is giving his speech.

496
00:28:47,602 --> 00:28:49,437
It's the Vigilante's Book Depository.

497
00:28:49,604 --> 00:28:51,039
Felicity, we need you
to check the blueprints.

498
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,064
Yeah, already on it.

499
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,293
Okay, the sixth floor is under renovation.
Dollars to donuts...

500
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:55,568
That's where he'll be.

501
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:28,309
Yeah. I'm listening.

502
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:31,187
Yeah, copy that.

503
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:35,608
Vigilante is across the street.
Sixth floor.

504
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:39,862
He's gonna take you out as soon as
you walk outside into the open.

505
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:43,491
- Is the team on site?
- Yeah.

506
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:46,786
Then it'll be fine.

507
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:10,351
Good evening, everyone.

508
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:14,146
I'd like to thank the City Council
for conducting these hearings

509
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:15,982
with honesty and integrity.

510
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:21,862
Simply wish that I could've done the same
with regards to the Green Arrow's

511
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:25,116
murder of Detective William Malone.

512
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:30,538
- Terrific, where is he?
- This way, this way!

513
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:44,593
What's so funny?

514
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:46,721
I think I just found
a new use for my T-Sphere.

515
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:48,014
Your what?

516
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:54,353
When I took the oath of office,
I promised to be honest and forthright.

517
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,939
I never wanted to be a politician

518
00:30:57,106 --> 00:31:02,111
who relied on dirty politics
or underhanded tactics.

519
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:06,115
Now, that's what I'm talking about!

520
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:13,122
Oh, no.

521
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:19,128
And in the spirit of that transparency,

522
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:23,090
I think I owe everyone an explanation
as to why

523
00:31:23,257 --> 00:31:25,176
I covered up what the Green Arrow did.

524
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:54,830
I did it in a misguided attempt
to protect everyone from the tragic news

525
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:57,083
that the Green Arrow
had become a cop killer.

526
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,250
What?

527
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:02,713
That a man we had put our faith in
had failed this city.

528
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:06,175
I didn't think that we could afford
to lose another hero.

529
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:08,511
Hey, Vigilante!

530
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,554
I got two of these.

531
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:19,396
- Nice aim.
- That's the thing, they aim themselves.

532
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:24,485
Awesome!

533
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,114
Awesome!

534
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:34,036
You're awesome. That was badass.

535
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:36,580
- That mean no more ball jokes?
- Hell, no.

536
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:44,713
Remind me to thank Cisco
for that upgraded Kevlar.

537
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,884
- You guys all right?
- Yeah, but what about Oliver?

538
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:51,720
But the truth is more important,

539
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,473
and the truth is that
the Green Arrow has gone rogue.

540
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,562
We must disavow him, we must hunt him,
and punish him for what he has done.

541
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:03,023
Green Arrow is not a hero.

542
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:10,573
He is what's keeping Star City from being
the best that it can be.

543
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:14,702
Thank you very much.

544
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:27,835
They're still deliberating.

545
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:29,925
Well, that's taking longer than I thought.

546
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:32,595
Yeah, well,
you gave them plenty to think about.

547
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:36,098
So, how's it feel, huh?
Making yourself into a villain like that?

548
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:39,602
Susan Williams is here.

549
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:40,912
You want me to say you're busy?

550
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,606
No! No, I'd like to tell the truth
for the rest of the day,

551
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,332
if at all possible. Please send her in.

552
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,734
All right.

553
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,236
Susan, please.

554
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:51,697
Thank you.

555
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:54,783
I'm glad you're here.

556
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,454
- Susan, I'm very sorry.
- I got my job back.

557
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:03,167
An anonymous hacker confessed
that the plagiarism story was fake.

558
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:06,462
Said they were just messing with us.
My boss apologized.

559
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:09,340
Well, that's good news.
Still though, I'm really sorry.

560
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:11,467
Are you? What I mean is,

561
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:13,719
you didn't know about this
beforehand, did you?

562
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:15,679
No, I had no idea.

563
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:19,433
But once you did,
you made them make it right. Right?

564
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:23,020
- Are we off the record?
- Yes.

565
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:26,482
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

566
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:28,984
So, what happens next?

567
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:32,446
You mean, what do I do with your secret?
I keep it.

568
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:35,366
I care about this city,
and you're working double-time

569
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:36,992
to make it a better place.

570
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:41,538
I do appreciate that, but I meant,
what happens next with us?

571
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:43,666
Uh...

572
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:48,295
Sorry to interrupt,
but I think you'll be happy that we did.

573
00:34:49,964 --> 00:34:51,757
Council voted

574
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:53,217
against impeachment.

575
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:59,598
Thank you so much, Adrian,
I could not have done this without you.

576
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:01,517
Are you kidding me? No thanks needed.

577
00:35:01,684 --> 00:35:05,479
You're not just my boss, Oliver,
you're my friend.

578
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:11,485
I'm gonna go give Thea the good news.
I'll be right back.

579
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:12,778
Okay.

580
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:18,701
Hey, no need to pack up, we won.

581
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,203
We both get to keep our jobs.

582
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,871
Yeah, not...

583
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,165
Not both of us.

584
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:29,211
Look, Ollie, you... You were right. I...

585
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:33,590
I am getting deeper and deeper
into the mud lately,

586
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:36,385
and it's like my bloodlust last year,

587
00:35:36,552 --> 00:35:39,305
except instead of arrows and swords,

588
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,974
I've replaced it with
politics and slanders, so I am...

589
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:44,977
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
that you have to quit, Thea.

590
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:46,584
- I need you here...
- Ollie, please.

591
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:49,898
Please don't ask me to stay,
because I will.

592
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:51,775
I will for you.

593
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:56,113
But I am broken. Okay?

594
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,158
I need you to let me go.

595
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:03,245
Let me go, so, I can try to fix myself.

596
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:06,749
Well...

597
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,673
- Your resignation's accepted.
- Thank you.

598
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:27,853
My resignation letter's on the desk.

599
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:35,819
When I signal,
you must align with Anatoly,

600
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:39,281
who called Spros dopros,
or Gregor, our incumbent Pakhan.

601
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:41,950
Now, let's get this over with quickly.

602
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:55,297
Hey, stop!

603
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:57,132
Mr. Queen, you do not have floor.

604
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:58,717
Just give me 10 seconds,

605
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:02,221
listen to what I have to say,
and if you don't like it, shoot me.

606
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:04,890
As you wish.

607
00:37:08,477 --> 00:37:12,147
This laptop contains
80 million rubles in transfers

608
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:15,317
from Kovar's accounts
to accounts that Gregor controls.

609
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:18,904
Yes, we know this,
to spread among Bratva captains.

610
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:25,536
It also contains 40 million rubles worth
of bank transfers from Kovar

611
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,872
that Gregor hasn't disclosed.

612
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:33,335
Open it. Ask him if it's true.

613
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:37,756
Is this true, Gregor?

614
00:37:44,138 --> 00:37:47,349
40 million rubles. So, it's true.

615
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:51,186
If anybody wishes to cast a new vote,
please do so now.

616
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,031
It seems that
you are deciding vote, Viktor.

617
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:05,242
What say you, my friend?

618
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,457
We have a new Pakhan.

619
00:38:11,874 --> 00:38:14,001
This is most disappointing.

620
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:17,546
I liked many of you.

621
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:24,845
- Council isn't impeaching.
- Yes!

622
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,180
- Still the mayor.
- Whoo!

623
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,682
Yet, the Green Arrow is
Public Enemy Number One.

624
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:30,410
We've dealt with
the police on our backs before.

625
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:32,519
Not like this, one of their own is dead.

626
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:33,687
Dinah's right.

627
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:36,774
And now we know just how much the police
can interfere with our work here.

628
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:38,150
Can I go?

629
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:40,277
I'm kind of
getting back together with Paul.

630
00:38:40,444 --> 00:38:42,112
It's a big deal.

631
00:38:42,279 --> 00:38:45,782
- Can I leave? Can I...
- Yes! Yes, of course. Go.

632
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:48,035
Have fun.
Everyone should have fun tonight.

633
00:38:48,202 --> 00:38:49,745
Just quickly though,

634
00:38:49,912 --> 00:38:52,623
I might have buried the headline here.

635
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:56,585
You all saved my life.

636
00:38:56,752 --> 00:38:58,128
And five months ago,

637
00:38:58,295 --> 00:39:00,964
I never would've thought
that was possible.

638
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:05,844
Thank you for working hard,

639
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:07,822
thank you for banding together,
thank you for being...

640
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:10,766
Sorry. I...
I mean, thank you for saying thank you.

641
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:14,436
Wow. Man to man, that means a lot,
but I'm really late to see Paul, so...

642
00:39:14,603 --> 00:39:15,938
- Give Paul my best.
- Thank you!

643
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,607
- Good luck.
- Good luck!

644
00:39:21,485 --> 00:39:22,819
Oh. Thank you.

645
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:27,866
I'm sorry.

646
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:32,204
Sorry, we were stopping an assassination.

647
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:34,051
Can you believe
I stopped an assassination?

648
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:36,291
Wow.

649
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:41,964
So, on the way over here,
I rehearsed what I would say to you.

650
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:45,801
How I would win you back,

651
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:49,096
tell you I love you.

652
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,932
You know, I just started with...

653
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:55,018
That was definitely not
how I planned on opening,

654
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:57,688
but can I start again? I'ma start again.
When I came to...

655
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:00,816
It's nice to see you, Curtis. I mean that.

656
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:04,152
As much as you're going to think
that I don't.

657
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:05,612
What?

658
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:14,413
Are you divorcing me?

659
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:18,875
I'm sorry. I really am.

660
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,523
Felicity! _Hil

661
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,650
I am so glad you got in touch.

662
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:46,653
- Though I am a little surprised?
- Yeah, me, too.

663
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,072
Well, "surprised" isn't actually

664
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:51,366
the right word to describe
how I'm feeling.

665
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:53,577
What's the right word?

666
00:40:53,744 --> 00:40:55,037
Ready.

667
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:56,288
A good friend of mine

668
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:58,749
told me that if you're gonna try
to fight fire with fire,

669
00:40:58,915 --> 00:40:59,958
you're gonna get burned,

670
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:03,045
but then another friend of mine

671
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,881
came through something
pretty scary tonight

672
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,799
because he had backup,

673
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:10,344
a team.

674
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,929
You're accepting the invitation
to join Helix?

675
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:16,224
Yes. Full throttle.

676
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:24,733
Susan.

677
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:26,652
Oh. Hey.

678
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:30,364
- I thought we could talk.
- About?

679
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:32,574
An exclusive.

680
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:36,203
Can we set up the meeting tomorrow?
I'm late for a dinner.

681
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:45,087
The thing is that this story,
it's important.

682
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,257
You could call it life or death.

683
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:26,628
English - SDH
