00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:27,892
KHUSHI

1
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:41,210
It'll be all right

2
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:33,063
Welcome sir Has the
midwife arrived Sitaram

3
00:02:36,603 --> 00:02:37,592
Greetings

4
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:40,733
Don't be afraid it'll all be
okay in a little while

5
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:47,269
Don't be afraid be brave.
Give me that towel

6
00:02:50,283 --> 00:02:52,274
Give me some water

7
00:02:59,593 --> 00:03:03,290
Congratulations
God has given you a baby girl

8
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,064
Praise the Lord!
- Come on in, sir

9
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:37,328
She's so lovable

10
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:44,132
Well? My whiskers prick?

11
00:03:54,814 --> 00:04:00,684
This is the world in which every man
lives for just one reason

12
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:03,879
That they find love in
everyone's heart

13
00:04:04,357 --> 00:04:08,350
Love manifests itself in many ways
Between mother and son.

14
00:04:09,029 --> 00:04:11,020
between brothers
and sisters friends

15
00:04:11,798 --> 00:04:14,358
but there's a love far removed
from all these kinds of love...

16
00:04:14,768 --> 00:04:19,535
a love that is born in young hearts.
A love that brings joy to the heart

17
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,707
Born in the eastern part
of India, in Kolkata...

18
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:33,375
is Karan

19
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:43,985
Born in Chamoli village of
Uttaranchal state...

20
00:04:44,397 --> 00:04:47,798
is Virbhadra's daughter, Khushi

21
00:04:50,904 --> 00:04:54,806
Theirs is a marriage
God decided in His heavens

22
00:04:56,409 --> 00:05:00,402
Despite being born in
different castes and regions...

23
00:05:00,747 --> 00:05:03,409
they have one thing in common...

24
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,581
Iove

25
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:11,423
These are the two children who
are going to fall in love

26
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:15,418
When will they fall in love?
When will they unite?

27
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:17,920
That's what this story is all about

28
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:24,427
Despite the distance between them,
when will these two young hearts...

29
00:05:24,938 --> 00:05:26,929
get to know each other
and accept each other?

30
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,704
Let's witness the miracle
of nature

31
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:43,452
This is the biggest sari-store
in Mumbai

32
00:05:44,024 --> 00:05:46,015
You'll find every kind of sari here

33
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:48,859
What do you think of this one?
- Nice

34
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:57,793
That yellow one. Show me that

35

71
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,575
Why's she so late? She should
have been here by now

72
00:07:44,577 --> 00:07:47,569
Who? Ram Singh?
- No. Lali!

73
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:51,573
You start ranting the moment
your daughter's a bit late

74
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:55,918
Mind your own business.
And don't say I'm ranting

75
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,023
Here comes Lali!
Lali...

76
00:08:03,696 --> 00:08:07,257
Ram Singh, hasn't Lali come?
- No

77
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:09,864
Moron! You must have
missed her in the crowds

78
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:14,597
What crowds, sir? There's just a
single railway line and a hut

79
00:08:15,008 --> 00:08:18,273
If anyone ever gets off the train,
it's only to have some water

80
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:21,612
So what crowds will there be?
- Strange

81
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:24,945
She told me that she'd be coming

82
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:28,619
What could have happened?

83
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:47,629
My Lali has arrived!

84
00:09:42,896 --> 00:09:44,693
Like the flying clouds...

85
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:46,695
is the kohl in my eyes

86
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:49,027
Like fragrant winds...

87
00:09:49,235 --> 00:09:51,100
is my disposition

88
00:09:51,304 --> 00:09:54,034
On my lips,
plays a smile

89
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:02,704
Here comes Khushi (happiness)

90
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:10,321
I bring khushi

91
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:19,724
From me flows every cheer

92
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:23,999
Without me,
they're all fake

93
00:10:24,537 --> 00:10:27,529
I bring the mischief
of Spring

94
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,912
Khushi

95
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:22,121
The rains come down
in a patter...

96
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:25,790
it wins our hearts

97
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,530
I wish I could sway

98
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:34,798
I wish I could kiss
the skies

99
00:11:35,274 --> 00:11:38,801
I tread a new path
towards a new goal

100
00:11:45,284 --> 00:11:48,981
Water, I could turn into a spark

101
00:11:49,822 --> 00:11:53,485
Even a spark would go berserk
at my touch

102
00:11:54,093 --> 00:11:58,086
With my beauty,
I cast a spell

103
00:11:58,498 --> 00:12:02,161
Even the stars
talk about me

104
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:05,838
Like a fairy in Spring...

105
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:09,237
here comes Khushi

106
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:35,196
O little girl...

107
00:12:35,935 --> 00:12:39,666
at your feet
lies the world

108
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:43,868
I wonder,
so does everybody...

109
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,302
what is it about you?

110
00:12:48,314 --> 00:12:52,341
When you smile,
it ushers in a new dawn...

111
00:12:52,885 --> 00:12:55,877
when you cry,
it plunges us into darkness

112
00:13:13,106 --> 00:13:16,098
I'm a carefree soul

113
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:20,176
I do as I please

114
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:33,252
Shade and the dazzling Sun...

115
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:37,453
it's all about my
stunning beauty

116
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:41,325
I'm the talk of the town

117
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,942
My bangles tinkle,
my anklets chime

118
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:55,940
Like a crazy beauty,
I sway in my gait

119
00:13:56,749 --> 00:14:00,378
I'm a bit mischievous,
and a bit shy...

120
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:04,949
nobody can guess
what it is about me

121
00:14:05,391 --> 00:14:08,121
Like a fairy in Spring...

122
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,432
here comes Khushi

123
00:14:21,974 --> 00:14:24,374
I bring khushi

124
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:50,161
Lali! My child!

125
00:15:04,183 --> 00:15:05,775
Welcome, sir. Greetings

126
00:15:06,018 --> 00:15:09,010
Madam Lali says they're here
in the village to help us

127
00:15:09,355 --> 00:15:11,687
I've made all the arrangements
they wanted

128
00:15:11,924 --> 00:15:14,017
Where is my daughter donating blood?
- Over there

129
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:15,216
Moron!

130
00:15:26,038 --> 00:15:29,371
Bloody doctor! How dare you
draw blood from my daughter?

131
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:34,038
How dare you?
Put that blood back in her! Go on!

132
00:15:34,447 --> 00:15:38,645
Hurry! Get that syringe out
which is drawing her blood

133
00:15:39,185 --> 00:15:41,380
Listen to me...
- Use a syringe to put in the blood

134
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:46,518
How dare you draw blood from her?
- Donating blood isn't a bad thing

135
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:49,327
Blood is blood! It isn't water.
- Come on, Papa

136
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:11,572
Karan...

137
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:44,539
It'll give me strength

138
00:16:57,797 --> 00:17:01,460
I'll find a girl
who wears short skirts

139
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:06,132
Love blossoms in my heart...

140
00:17:06,572 --> 00:17:10,474
I see the stars and the Moon
at daytime

141
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,538
I'm about to fall in love...

142
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:19,148
I'm about to lose my heart

143
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:45,706
To Tollygunge,
I will get...

144
00:17:47,012 --> 00:17:50,175
how are you?
I'll ask

145
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,778
The girl will ask,
what happened?

146
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:59,319
Come with me, I'll say

147
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:03,787
Samosas and rossogollas...

148
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,188
sweet yogurt,
we'll feast on

149
00:19:07,393 --> 00:19:10,385
Life is short

150
00:19:11,363 --> 00:19:14,662
I will find a girl
as a crazy as I am

151
00:19:15,935 --> 00:19:19,666
And then will begin...

152
00:19:20,506 --> 00:19:23,270
our love-story

153
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:37,278
In the boat, we sail...

154
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,683
across the vast Ganges,
we sail

155
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:56,964
Whichever girl prefers
Rabindra-sangeet...

156
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,305
will be mate for life

157
00:20:59,371 --> 00:21:03,171
Mother Goddess... please don't
send my son faraway from me

158
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:08,380
Don't pray like this for me.
- Why're you angry with your mother?

159
00:21:08,814 --> 00:21:11,806
Ma's asking for just the opposite
of what I'm asking of God

160
00:21:12,384 --> 00:21:15,046
God must himself be confused.
Will He heed my prayers or Ma's?

161
00:21:15,554 --> 00:21:18,546
What you've prayed for and
what your Ma prayed for?

162
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:22,383
I prayed so I can go away to Canada
and she prays that I don't go away

163
00:21:22,795 --> 00:21:24,990
It isn't just a prayer,
she's been meditating

164
00:21:25,397 --> 00:21:27,388
Dad, do you mind?
- Not at all

165
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:30,126
If my son studies in Canada,
what would be better than that?

166
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:33,064
How true!
- If it was only for 5 months...

167
00:21:33,405 --> 00:21:35,737
I wouldn't have said anything,
but 5 years?

168
00:21:36,141 --> 00:21:39,406
Just 5 years, Ma!
They'll pass in a jiffy

169
00:21:41,013 --> 00:21:43,004
What haven't I done to
get an admission?

170
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:47,408
I ran around for the passport
and visa

171
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:53,082
When I can stay away for 5 years,
can't you do it too, Ma?

172
00:21:53,425 --> 00:21:57,020
She's always crying, daddy!
- Obviously, my son. She's your mother

173
00:22:05,738 --> 00:22:08,730
What? You want to study further?
- Yes

174
00:22:09,141 --> 00:22:09,971
Oh no

175
00:22:10,776 --> 00:22:13,244
We have very few educated boys
in our community anyway

176
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:16,839
And you want to study further?
Where will I find a suitor for you?

177
00:22:17,683 --> 00:22:21,244
A suitor...? What for?
- To play Cricket with you

178
00:22:22,921 --> 00:22:25,253
Why're you talking about
marriage right now, Papa?

179
00:22:25,658 --> 00:22:28,923
I want to complete my M Sc.
I've filled in the application form

180
00:22:29,461 --> 00:22:30,860
Sign it

181
00:22:32,131 --> 00:22:33,462
Sign it, Papa

182
00:22:33,732 --> 00:22:35,859
I'll pull you by your plaits!

183
00:22:36,835 --> 00:22:38,996
Who do you think you are?

184
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:43,465
You're always doing as you wish

185
00:22:46,478 --> 00:22:48,469
There are just four boys
who've done BSc...

186
00:22:48,647 --> 00:22:50,638
in our village and the
neighbouring villages

187
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,041
Two of them belong
to our community

188
00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:57,478
One of them is leaving for America.
What for, God alone knows

189
00:22:58,557 --> 00:23:01,822
That leaves Ranvir Chaudhary's son

190
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:07,223
I've begged him and got him to agree
to live with us after your marriage

191
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:10,661
I've called them over tomorrow
for your engagement

192
00:23:11,003 --> 00:23:12,994
Called them over?
With whose permission?

193
00:23:13,338 --> 00:23:15,329
Whose permission do I need to take?
- I don't want all this

194
00:23:15,507 --> 00:23:16,838
I want to study

195
00:23:27,986 --> 00:23:31,513
My child, listen to me

196
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:37,859
After 10 years of prayers,
God blessed us with a child

197
00:23:38,697 --> 00:23:43,930
A baby-girl. If I get you
married in another town...

198
00:23:44,703 --> 00:23:47,934
I'll keep thinking
and worrying about you

199
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:53,705
Tell me, will I be able to live
if you're far away from me?

200
00:23:54,546 --> 00:23:57,538
Who's marrying and going far away?
- If you study any further...

201
00:23:57,783 --> 00:24:01,344
that's just what is going to happen!
So I've called them for an engagement

202
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,212
So ask them not to come. I want to
study further. Please sign this

203
00:24:17,236 --> 00:24:19,227
You tore up my application form?

204
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:22,167
That's chap coming to meet
me tomorrow, isn't he?

205
00:24:22,574 --> 00:24:25,065
Just you see!
I'll drive him away!

206
00:24:25,377 --> 00:24:27,174
Just you watch!

207
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:41,787
Come to bed.
- I'm not sleepy. You go on

208
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:45,763
It's 2 in the morning. Come...
- I'm not sleepy. You go to sleep!

209
00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:39,382
Lord Hanuman...

210
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:43,143
please make my daughter
agree to the wedding...

211
00:25:43,655 --> 00:25:45,919
please make my daughter
agree to the wedding...

212
00:25:54,433 --> 00:25:58,665
God has heard your prayers.
- What? Really?

213
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:02,401
You may call them over.
I agree to the wedding

214
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:06,667
Praise You, Lord Hanuman!

215
00:26:09,748 --> 00:26:14,242
This is my daughter, Khushi.
I call her Lali lovingly

216
00:26:14,686 --> 00:26:20,056
After the marriage, you can
call her either Khushi or Lali

217
00:26:20,692 --> 00:26:24,355
You can even give her a new name.
It's your choice

218
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,711
Do you like the boy?

219
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:54,049
I'm so happy that you've
agreed to the wedding

220
00:26:54,526 --> 00:27:00,396
But if you don't like the boy,
tell me. I'll find other boys

221
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:04,126
Now tell me...
do you approve of this chap?

222
00:27:08,307 --> 00:27:10,298
That's chap coming to meet
me tomorrow, isn't he?

223
00:27:10,475 --> 00:27:12,739
Just you see!
I'll drive him away!

224
00:27:13,078 --> 00:27:14,636
Just you watch!

225
00:27:16,114 --> 00:27:19,106
Wow! So you approve of him!

226
00:27:22,788 --> 00:27:25,348
The wedding of Virbhadra Singh's
daughter Khushi...

227
00:27:25,557 --> 00:27:28,924
has been fixed with Ranvir Singh's
son Mahendra

228
00:27:40,238 --> 00:27:41,569
My glasses...

229
00:27:41,773 --> 00:27:46,767
I haven't done anything.
- So who is it?

230
00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:56,578
I'm flying to Canada?

231
00:27:59,524 --> 00:28:02,322
Why're you laughing?
- I'm the one who's going

232
00:28:03,095 --> 00:28:06,189
You?
- My pasport's okay, my visa's okay

233
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:11,124
Go away to Canada.
I'm going to rot here

234
00:28:20,979 --> 00:28:23,470
God... how could this happen?

235
00:28:23,882 --> 00:28:27,613
Why're you crying?
What happened, Ma?

236
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,682
I don't know...

237
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:33,154
the groom's sister was crying
after she read this letter

238
00:28:34,826 --> 00:28:37,818
Dear Khushi, forgive me.
I'm in love with someone

239
00:28:38,296 --> 00:28:40,821
Had I told my father,
he'd have killed me

240
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:44,830
I know, it's terrible to tell
the girl a day before the wedding...

241
00:28:45,837 --> 00:28:48,169
What happened, Lali?
What happened?

242
00:29:05,857 --> 00:29:08,849
Daddy, look at her.
She always sports a long face

243
00:29:09,327 --> 00:29:13,320
Look at dad, Mom. He's so happy
to see me off

244
00:29:13,765 --> 00:29:18,464
But all you know is to shed tears!
- Let me see you off at the airport

245
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,132
You? At the airport?

246
00:29:23,141 --> 00:29:25,871
I want to see smiling faces
before I leave. Not crying faces

247
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,241
My darling Ma!
- Look after yourself

248
00:29:34,386 --> 00:29:36,149
I'll return soon. I promise

249
00:29:49,401 --> 00:29:52,564
Take a careful look at the
guy wearing glasses in that crowd

250
00:29:53,972 --> 00:29:56,497
This man has nothing to do
with our story

251
00:29:56,908 --> 00:29:59,900
But he's the one who's going
to give the story a new twist

252
00:30:39,117 --> 00:30:42,280
Watch out... step on the brakes!

253
00:30:51,963 --> 00:30:55,558
You know whose blood this is?
Yes, it's Khushi's

254
00:30:56,701 --> 00:31:00,694
The blood she donated in Chamoli
has journeyed far to reach here

255
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,472
For Karan

256
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,978
Lali! My child!

257
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:21,982
Lali, just don't worry

258
00:31:22,994 --> 00:31:25,986
I've told the priest to find
another suitor for you

259
00:31:26,431 --> 00:31:28,763
You're going to be married
next week

260
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,333
Keep quiet, Papa.
- Why, my child?

261
00:31:32,804 --> 00:31:36,001
How can you take such decisions
without even thinking?

262
00:31:37,008 --> 00:31:41,001
Do you know what I've been through?
A groom has just walked out on me

263
00:31:41,513 --> 00:31:44,004
And you're already thinking
of another marriage?

264
00:31:45,016 --> 00:31:48,179
And I want to study further.
But you...

265
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,384
Yes, you wanted to study further.
But I stood in your way

266
00:31:56,027 --> 00:32:01,829
Papa, may I study further?
May I complete my MSc?

267
00:32:02,234 --> 00:32:07,399
How will you study further?
I tore up your application form

268
00:32:09,107 --> 00:32:11,268
You tore up the form
of Pune University

269
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:13,636
But I've also applied
to the Mumbai University

270
00:32:14,045 --> 00:32:17,708
They've even called me for an interview.
With your permission...

271
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:22,042
I'll leave for further studies.
- Bombay University?

272
00:32:25,056 --> 00:32:27,718
How about my signature?

273
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:33,656
Big deal! It's just Virbhadra Singh

274
00:32:34,065 --> 00:32:37,057
Just a fowl-scratch.
I've done it already

275
00:32:40,538 --> 00:32:42,062
Thief!

276
00:32:49,414 --> 00:32:51,405
What's happening?

277
00:32:52,584 --> 00:32:57,487
I saw hands and legs
in plaster...

278
00:32:58,089 --> 00:33:02,082
but not on a whole face!

279
00:33:02,694 --> 00:33:05,686
Moron! Wear your glasses.
That isn't my face

280
00:33:06,097 --> 00:33:07,826
It's over here

281
00:33:19,177 --> 00:33:22,613
Bastard, you're laughing at me
instead of feeling sorry?

282
00:33:23,114 --> 00:33:25,446
You said you were going to Canada

283
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:40,120
You can't leave me
and go away anywhere

284
00:33:40,532 --> 00:33:43,626
Karan! My son!
- Greetings

285
00:33:44,135 --> 00:33:46,330
Mother Goddess!
What's happened to my son?

286
00:33:46,671 --> 00:33:48,138
Mother Goddess...

287
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:54,501
Why're you angry? She's crying
because you've met with an accident

288
00:33:55,146 --> 00:33:57,137
This accident took place
because she cried

289
00:33:57,315 --> 00:33:59,943
She cried before I got into the car,
so the accident happened

290
00:34:00,318 --> 00:34:02,149
Thank God she didn't come
to the airport

291
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,413
Had she come there, maybe
the plane would've crashed

292
00:34:05,557 --> 00:34:08,651
Send me to Canada
some way or the other

293
00:34:10,428 --> 00:34:13,659
Rascal! Why're you laughing?
I haven't cracked a joke

294
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:17,566
It is a joke indeed.
When I broke a little toe...

295
00:34:17,902 --> 00:34:23,499
I was laid up for a week. And you...
you're laid down for 2 months at least

296
00:34:24,242 --> 00:34:28,178
Forget Canada, you can't even
go to the loo for two months

297
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,178
Why must he shut up?
He's right

298
00:34:31,616 --> 00:34:34,176
The doctor says you need bed rest
for at least two months

299
00:34:34,586 --> 00:34:36,577
Dad, what happens of my studies?

300
00:34:36,755 --> 00:34:39,849
You so badly wanted
to go to Canada...

301
00:34:40,191 --> 00:34:42,785
that you didn't apply
to any college here

302
00:34:43,194 --> 00:34:45,526
There's just one way now

303
00:34:46,197 --> 00:34:48,859
The Vice Chancellor at Mumbai
University is a friend of mine

304
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:53,533
If you wish, I can have a word with
him and have a seat blocked for you

305
00:34:54,205 --> 00:34:56,196
Will you go to Mumbai then?

306
00:34:56,908 --> 00:34:59,570
What difference does it make
when I can't go to Canada anyway?

307
00:35:00,211 --> 00:35:01,610
Be it Calcutta or Mumbai

308
00:36:04,275 --> 00:36:06,266
Looks like you're a huge fan
of Ricky Martin

309
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,013
I follow a rule. I fit in
with whoever's a big hit

310
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:15,285
Whether it's Ricky Martin
or a rusty tin

311
00:37:13,511 --> 00:37:17,743
Whenever I visit a temple...
I find a lot of peace of mind

312
00:37:20,351 --> 00:37:23,343
I used to visit the temple in the
village every day. I liked going there

313
00:37:26,758 --> 00:37:29,750
Look at the politician. It looks
as if he's asking God for votes

314
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,521
What did you say?
- I was only kidding

315
00:39:12,964 --> 00:39:14,955
I've seen you somewhere

316
00:39:15,533 --> 00:39:18,468
No, that wasn't what
I was getting at. Please

317
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:25,466
But it's true that boys use this
line when they want to befriend a girl

318
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,901
But that wasn't I was getting at

319
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,742
But I'm speaking the truth.
I've seen you somewhere

320
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:35,642
I get that feeling too

321
00:39:37,355 --> 00:39:40,222
This is the first time we've met,
but somehow I feel...

322
00:39:40,491 --> 00:39:45,827
as if I've known you for 20 years.
- True. That's how I feel too

323
00:39:56,207 --> 00:39:58,107
You do look happy

324
00:40:02,914 --> 00:40:04,245
You're here to?

325
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:23,523
Do you have a girlfriend?
- Yes, in our college

326
00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:26,927
In our class?
- No, in the maths section

327
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:29,869
What's her name?
- Priya

328
00:40:30,441 --> 00:40:33,535
What hankypanky have you been upto?
- I've been upto no hankypanky

329
00:40:34,545 --> 00:40:37,946
It's the same old status problem.
She's the daughter of a rich man

330
00:40:38,282 --> 00:40:43,276
And I was brought up in an orphanage.
- Why do we always have...

331
00:40:43,554 --> 00:40:46,546
this angle in every love-story?
It's very sad!

332
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:54,224
So now?
- Somehow or the other...

333
00:40:54,565 --> 00:40:59,298
I want to reach this letter to her.
- You plan on killing us, do you?

334
00:40:59,837 --> 00:41:01,828
Madan, please.
- Give it to me

335
00:41:24,662 --> 00:41:26,994
Listen, make him see reason

336
00:41:27,865 --> 00:41:31,130
If he doesn't understand, finish him.
- Sure

337
00:41:33,671 --> 00:41:37,300
You've had it, Vicky. Did you have to
fall in love with this guy's daughter?

338
00:41:40,611 --> 00:41:43,409
Khushi, my dear. How are you?
- I'm all right

339
00:41:44,415 --> 00:41:47,213
How's your friend doing at studies?
- Very well

340
00:42:04,635 --> 00:42:06,626
What are you doing here?

341
00:42:10,641 --> 00:42:12,302
What's that in your hand?

342
00:42:17,715 --> 00:42:20,980
Yes. How did you know?
- It's all over your face

343
00:42:21,886 --> 00:42:25,822
Don't you have any manners on
how to behave with a girl in public?

344
00:42:26,324 --> 00:42:29,316
Don't you realise what people
on the streets will think?

345
00:42:30,661 --> 00:42:33,858
You dress so well but you
behave like a cheapskate?

346
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:39,363
You're talking any nonsense.
- My mouth, my tongue...

347
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:42,334
I will say what I want to.
- But my ears can't listen to all this

348
00:42:42,673 --> 00:42:47,201
You're hurting my feelings.
- Feelings, I see!

349
00:42:47,678 --> 00:42:50,943
You get friendly at the first meeting
and pass love-letters the next moment!

350
00:42:51,949 --> 00:42:53,940
What feelings are those?
So cheap!

351
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:59,285
Madam, I haven't written
this love-letter to you

352
00:42:59,557 --> 00:43:02,025
My friend Vicky wrote it
for your friend Priya

353
00:43:02,693 --> 00:43:07,289
He said that she has a strict father
who won't let her take his calls...

354
00:43:07,698 --> 00:43:10,189
and asked me if I could deliver
this letter to Priya

355
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:13,295
When I arrived here with the letter,
I found the watchman at the gate

356
00:43:13,704 --> 00:43:17,037
I was wondering what I could do
when these cars arrived

357
00:43:17,441 --> 00:43:19,705
There were these deadly thugs
with Priya's father

358
00:43:19,877 --> 00:43:22,710
I was so shocked to see them,
I didn't know what to do

359
00:43:23,047 --> 00:43:25,038
That's when I saw you
walking out with Priya

360
00:43:25,182 --> 00:43:28,709
Khushi! She's the girl I met
at the temple

361
00:43:29,053 --> 00:43:32,511
I thought my friend's work was done.
I'd send the letter to her through you

362
00:43:32,924 --> 00:43:36,917
But you, you tell me that I don't
have any sense, any manners...

363
00:43:37,128 --> 00:43:38,823
who do you think you are?

364
00:43:39,063 --> 00:43:42,055
Maybe you have a tongue.
But you also brains to think

365
00:44:05,756 --> 00:44:09,556
We've been studying in the same college
and yet we didn't know each other

366
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,988
That's strange, isn't it?

367
00:44:12,096 --> 00:44:16,760
Strange also that we're here together.
- For love

368
00:44:17,234 --> 00:44:20,169
For love?
- Yes. Priya and Vicky's love

369
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:26,942
What did you think?
- Nothing at all

370
00:44:27,578 --> 00:44:30,376
May I ask something?
Have you ever fallen in love?

371
00:44:32,783 --> 00:44:34,182
You?

372
00:44:34,986 --> 00:44:37,113
Why not?
- Why not?

373
00:44:37,788 --> 00:44:41,383
What will I say?
Why didn't you fall in love?

374
00:44:43,494 --> 00:44:46,486
I don't know.
- You don't know how to fall in love?

375
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,591
So you do?

376
00:45:03,214 --> 00:45:04,806
Shall we leave, Vicky?

377
00:45:34,278 --> 00:45:37,179
What for?
- For dropping me home

378
00:45:38,349 --> 00:45:40,840
You say thanks when a stranger
drops you home

379
00:45:41,352 --> 00:45:44,651
We're not strangers anymore.
So why be so formal?

380
00:45:45,856 --> 00:45:48,848
But I've already said thanks.
What do we do?

381
00:45:50,861 --> 00:45:53,193
You must withdraw the words

382
00:46:13,884 --> 00:46:18,287
Students, the cultural programme
at the college begins very soon!

383
00:47:56,053 --> 00:47:57,987
What happened?
- It's open

384
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:02,382
The way you reacted over such
a trivial thing, I got really scared

385
00:48:07,198 --> 00:48:10,998
This is how friends should be.
Your friend showed trust in you...

386
00:48:11,335 --> 00:48:15,328
and gave you an open personal letter.
He must have so much of faith in you

387
00:48:16,006 --> 00:48:18,167
That's not such a big thing.
You may read it, if you wish to

388
00:48:22,012 --> 00:48:24,003
Your friend gave it to you,
because he trusted you

389
00:48:24,215 --> 00:48:26,206
You gave it to me,
because you trust me

390
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:30,614
And my friend has faith in me.
We must never betray someone's faith

391
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:36,691
What's the big deal?
The letter says, Dear Priya...

392
00:48:37,027 --> 00:48:39,621
I can't take you
to the movies this Friday

393
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:42,364
I've got to go to Nashik for 2 days,
so please don't be angry with me

394
00:48:42,766 --> 00:48:45,030
I don't know what I will do
without you these 2 days

395
00:48:45,502 --> 00:48:50,030
There's so much I will miss.
You, your voice, your lovely eyes...

396
00:48:50,374 --> 00:48:54,708
your cheeks, beautiful lips,
the ones I kiss...

397
00:48:55,512 --> 00:48:59,505
your lap, in which I rest my head.
I will keep saying...

398
00:49:05,556 --> 00:49:07,547
Must you read someone's letter?

399
00:49:10,861 --> 00:49:13,227
It's a love-letter!
Full of personal emotions

400
00:49:14,498 --> 00:49:17,399
You've let your friend down.
You have betrayed his trust

401
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:23,570
You're a dirty man...

402
00:49:29,146 --> 00:49:31,614
Are you through?
May I speak now?

403
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:38,077
Vicky hurt his thumb, not me.
It was bleeding

404
00:49:38,689 --> 00:49:41,089
Can someone write when
he has a hurt thumb?

405
00:49:42,092 --> 00:49:46,358
No? So he dictated letter to me
and I wrote it for him. Get it?

406
00:49:47,097 --> 00:49:50,089
You need more explanation?
You just need an opportunity...

407
00:49:50,367 --> 00:49:52,835
to fly off the handle
and you won't stop

408
00:49:55,506 --> 00:49:58,703
And you even say sorry.
Know what?

409
00:49:59,109 --> 00:50:02,772
Record I'm sorry on a cassette
a thousand times...

410
00:50:03,113 --> 00:50:06,105
because you use those words
often and often. Okay?

411
00:50:31,942 --> 00:50:33,933
What happened?
- The fan-belt seems to have snapped

412
00:50:34,211 --> 00:50:36,145
I had one fixed just yesterday

413
00:50:39,016 --> 00:50:41,814
What do we do now?
- We'll lock it up and walk

414
00:50:44,488 --> 00:50:46,479
The mechanic will take it away
in the morning

415
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:54,153
Khushi, what are you thinking about?
- Nothing

416
00:50:54,565 --> 00:50:56,556
What are you thinking about?
- Nothing

417
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:59,892
Khushi, if I ask you a question
will you answer me?

418
00:51:03,574 --> 00:51:05,565
Whom do you like most?

419
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:12,174
The most...? My Papa
- Of course

420
00:51:12,683 --> 00:51:16,175
Everyone of us loves his Papa.
He's the one who brings us up

421
00:51:19,523 --> 00:51:22,924
Apart from Papa,
who else do you like?

422
00:51:24,194 --> 00:51:29,928
Apart from Papa... my Mummy.
- Who can forget Mummy

423
00:51:30,534 --> 00:51:33,196
Mummy is great. At her feet
lie the heavens

424
00:51:33,937 --> 00:51:39,204
Look outside the house. Whom do
you like, apart from your folks?

425
00:51:51,288 --> 00:51:53,017
Who doesn't like him?

426
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:05,827
Look away from the film industry.
There must be someone else?

427
00:52:08,672 --> 00:52:11,903
There is...
- There is?

428
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:15,774
Who?
- Sachin Tendulkar

429
00:52:28,258 --> 00:52:34,060
Khushi, fathers, mothers, actors
and cricketers are all so common

430
00:52:34,765 --> 00:52:41,261
Everyone likes them. But whom do you
like specially and personally?

431
00:52:48,278 --> 00:52:50,269
Khushi... wait

432
00:52:53,283 --> 00:52:56,616
What happened?
- Tell me the name

433
00:52:57,087 --> 00:53:01,023
And I'll say that I like him.
But please don't bother me like this

434
00:53:02,292 --> 00:53:04,283
So what's the name?

435
00:53:08,298 --> 00:53:09,788
Never mind

436
00:54:28,378 --> 00:54:30,710
I was supposed to come, but...

437
00:54:32,382 --> 00:54:34,179
Have you seen Karan around?

438
00:54:34,384 --> 00:54:37,046
Is it your birthday?
- No

439
00:54:37,387 --> 00:54:40,049
Something special at home?
- No. Why?

440
00:54:40,891 --> 00:54:43,155
Your new dress and the sparkle?

441
00:54:45,195 --> 00:54:48,790
Nothing of the sort. Where's Karan?
- He's there in the corridor

442
00:54:49,566 --> 00:54:51,557
He wasn't there.
That's where I came from

443
00:54:51,902 --> 00:54:54,393
Maybe, but he's in
the telephone booth

444
00:54:56,073 --> 00:54:57,563
In the telephone booth?

445
00:55:02,412 --> 00:55:04,209
Please try to understand me

446
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:08,745
I couldn't come because my friends
asked me to stay back

447
00:55:09,419 --> 00:55:11,410
Hello... Madhu

448
00:55:13,423 --> 00:55:16,221
We have two or three days off
again next month

449
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,591
Yes, I promise

450
00:55:24,935 --> 00:55:28,098
There's still a week, right?
So let me make up for it

451
00:55:42,452 --> 00:55:44,443
Were you waiting for me?

452
00:55:46,456 --> 00:55:50,449
Well? You aren't looking nice today.
- Oh yes, that's what you will say

453
00:55:50,861 --> 00:55:53,125
Oh no, you're really
looking very beautiful

454
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:56,465
I spoke just the opposite.
- That's how you've always been

455
00:55:56,867 --> 00:55:59,267
I was only kidding.
Why're you taking it seriously?

456
00:56:01,738 --> 00:56:03,729
Khushi's looking for you

457
00:56:08,679 --> 00:56:12,137
Were you looking for me?
- Yes

458
00:56:12,549 --> 00:56:15,814
What for?
- It was something important

459
00:56:16,219 --> 00:56:18,210
But I've forgotten what it was

460
00:56:25,929 --> 00:56:28,727
Who?
- Who and who?

461
00:56:29,499 --> 00:56:31,899
On the phone.
- Madhu

462
00:56:32,502 --> 00:56:34,231
Madhu who?
- My Ma

463
00:56:34,504 --> 00:56:36,096
Ma?
- Yes

464
00:56:38,508 --> 00:56:40,908
But you were uttering her name

465
00:56:41,511 --> 00:56:44,503
That's my mother's name and
I address my mother by her name

466
00:56:52,522 --> 00:56:53,648
Yes, Ma

467
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:01,329
Yes, Ma

468
00:57:10,941 --> 00:57:14,206
Get cracking. The show begins in
two hours. I don't have time to waste

469
00:57:17,547 --> 00:57:19,344
Remember your step?

470
00:57:21,551 --> 00:57:24,349
You always teach me the same step.
- Because that's all I know

471
00:57:24,755 --> 00:57:27,315
What? Can you show me
something else?

472
00:57:51,581 --> 00:57:54,573
For the last 10 years, I've been
in this college like a milestone

473
00:57:55,585 --> 00:58:00,921
My juniors have turned professors.
But my friends, my cronies, I...

474
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:03,282
Enough. I get it

475
00:58:35,325 --> 00:58:36,622
Meaning?

476
00:58:38,628 --> 00:58:41,426
Meaning... she's a friend

477
00:59:49,699 --> 00:59:53,692
If not you...

478
00:59:55,438 --> 00:59:59,704
if not you...

479
01:00:07,117 --> 01:00:11,315
if not you... life's tough

480
01:00:12,455 --> 01:00:17,722
If not with you,
my love...

481
01:00:18,128 --> 01:00:22,724
I can't even die

482
01:00:43,887 --> 01:00:48,290
I get no sleep

483
01:00:49,225 --> 01:00:51,750
If not you

484
01:00:54,864 --> 01:01:02,100
If not you... life's restless

485
01:01:49,819 --> 01:01:51,810
Pining...

486
01:01:52,822 --> 01:01:54,414
overwhelms me...

487
01:01:55,492 --> 01:02:00,156
every moment, I swear

488
01:02:01,431 --> 01:02:03,422
Last night...

489
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:06,301
in my dreams...

490
01:02:06,836 --> 01:02:11,170
I have seen you, my love

491
01:02:13,443 --> 01:02:15,377
Laughter...

492
01:02:16,346 --> 01:02:20,840
sounds like a wail
if it isn't you

493
01:02:24,854 --> 01:02:26,845
Finding...

494
01:02:27,657 --> 01:02:32,458
is like losing...
if I can't find you

495
01:03:19,476 --> 01:03:23,913
In memories, I was lost...

496
01:03:24,914 --> 01:03:29,248
all night.
I could not go to sleep

497
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,911
Loneliness...

498
01:03:33,723 --> 01:03:35,714
gnaws...

499
01:03:36,359 --> 01:03:40,921
I have no one but you

500
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:45,528
Rose-gardens...

501
01:03:46,002 --> 01:03:50,939
appear to be barren,
if not with you

502
01:03:54,611 --> 01:03:56,602
This moment...

503
01:03:57,213 --> 01:04:02,207
seems frozen,
if not with you

504
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,820
Were you scared?
- No

505
01:05:18,027 --> 01:05:19,790
What's this?
- A gift

506
01:05:19,896 --> 01:05:20,590
For me?

507
01:05:27,136 --> 01:05:29,696
What's the hurry?
Open it later

508
01:05:42,051 --> 01:05:44,042
Necessary for smokers

509
01:05:45,054 --> 01:05:47,352
Where did you buy it?
- Akbarallys

510
01:05:49,058 --> 01:05:50,855
For how much?
- 5000

511
01:05:52,262 --> 01:05:53,251
5000?

512
01:05:54,397 --> 01:05:56,388
An ashtray? For 5000?

513
01:05:58,067 --> 01:06:01,400
It's no ordinary ashtray.
It's made from French crystal glass

514
01:06:01,804 --> 01:06:04,295
It's expensive because of
its intricate art-work

515
01:06:05,074 --> 01:06:07,065
It's very nice indeed

516
01:06:08,144 --> 01:06:11,602
But you could have given me
another gift instead of this

517
01:06:15,385 --> 01:06:18,081
It's such an expensive
and beautiful ashtray...

518
01:06:19,088 --> 01:06:24,082
I'd hate to drop ash in it
when I smoke

519
01:06:26,095 --> 01:06:29,087
That's exactly why I got
this ashtray

520
01:06:29,565 --> 01:06:32,557
Because whenever you drop ash,
you must remember me

521
01:06:33,102 --> 01:06:35,832
And you must feel that
you're dropping ash...

522
01:06:36,105 --> 01:06:38,096
not in the ashtray, but on me

523
01:06:39,509 --> 01:06:43,104
So you must give up smoking

524
01:06:48,284 --> 01:06:49,774
Karan quits smoking?

525
01:06:52,388 --> 01:06:55,846
Ask me for anything else, and I'll
do it. But give up smoking? No way

526
01:06:59,128 --> 01:07:00,561
If you...

527
01:07:03,399 --> 01:07:05,128
respect me...

528
01:07:08,137 --> 01:07:10,128
you will give up smoking

529
01:07:46,209 --> 01:07:47,437
Happy?

530
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,037
For the exams.
I'm studying

531
01:11:13,549 --> 01:11:16,814
That's not nice.
- What?

532
01:11:17,153 --> 01:11:19,383
That which you're doing

533
01:11:21,591 --> 01:11:23,183
Reading a book is a nice thing.

534
01:11:23,392 --> 01:11:27,055
In any case, it isn't porn.
It's a college book

535
01:11:27,496 --> 01:11:29,726
I'm not talking about
what you're reading

536
01:11:30,132 --> 01:11:32,396
I'm talking about the thing
you've been staring at

537
01:11:35,605 --> 01:11:38,073
Yes, I've been taking a good look

538
01:11:38,474 --> 01:11:40,942
Don't switch the topic.
You...

539
01:11:44,847 --> 01:11:46,838
you were staring at my waist

540
01:11:48,417 --> 01:11:51,147
Don't pretend! You were watching it!
- I didn't

541
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:53,411
You did too!
- I didn't, I say

542
01:11:53,889 --> 01:11:57,416
And I say you did. You did!
I caught you staring at it!

543
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:08,429
Well, maybe my eyes wandered
when I was turning a page

544
01:12:09,038 --> 01:12:11,165
But I didn't have any intentions

545
01:12:11,641 --> 01:12:15,441
You haven't been here a minute,
nor have you read a page...

546
01:12:15,945 --> 01:12:18,436
but you looked at it a dozen times!
- Now look, Khushi...

547
01:12:18,848 --> 01:12:23,046
you're mistaking me.
- What...? I'm making a mistake...

548
01:12:23,319 --> 01:12:24,911
or was it you?

549
01:12:28,457 --> 01:12:31,449
Remember all those things! When
I gave you Vicky's open letter...

550
01:12:31,727 --> 01:12:34,195
when I told you about its contents,
what did you say?

551
01:12:34,463 --> 01:12:36,454
One must never look at
other's private affairs

552
01:12:36,632 --> 01:12:41,968
You called me so many names!
Didn't you?

553
01:12:42,471 --> 01:12:46,840
When I told you that he had hurt
his thumb and that I had written...

554
01:12:47,143 --> 01:12:49,270
the letter for him,
you said sorry to me

555
01:12:49,478 --> 01:12:50,877
Didn't you?

556
01:12:52,515 --> 01:12:54,380
Never mind that.
Let's talk about our first meeting

557
01:12:54,483 --> 01:12:57,213
When I gave you that letter
Vicky wanted delivered to Priya...

558
01:12:57,486 --> 01:12:59,477
what conclusion did you jump to?
That I was giving you the letter

559
01:12:59,655 --> 01:13:01,646
You yelled so much at me

560
01:13:10,499 --> 01:13:13,059
Didn't you yell at me?
But when you got to know the truth...

561
01:13:13,235 --> 01:13:17,501
you said sorry. Didn't you?
I know what you want

562
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:20,500
You want everyone to praise your
beauty, to be crazy about you...

563
01:13:20,843 --> 01:13:23,004
and say I love you to you.
And when someone does that...

564
01:13:23,245 --> 01:13:25,110
you get worked up,
you kick up a fuss...

565
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:29,240
you start accusing him and say that
he's after girls. Isn't that right?

566
01:13:29,685 --> 01:13:33,314
Talk about me...
not about other girls

567
01:13:33,723 --> 01:13:37,523
What do you know about
girls' psychology? What?

568
01:13:37,893 --> 01:13:40,327
We don't pretend! I don't pretend!
But you do!

569
01:13:42,531 --> 01:13:43,793
You do!

570
01:13:44,767 --> 01:13:47,258
What did you do at the restaurant
the other day?

571
01:13:47,603 --> 01:13:52,870
You deliberately dropped your spoon,
so you could use my spoon to eat!

572
01:13:53,542 --> 01:13:56,875
You did put on an act then.
What were you hiding on?

573
01:13:58,614 --> 01:14:02,141
The other day, you said your car had
broken down and that we'd have to walk

574
01:14:02,551 --> 01:14:06,544
And what did you ask me?
Whom did you like most?

575
01:14:06,956 --> 01:14:08,719
You bored me to death!

576
01:14:09,625 --> 01:14:12,560
And when your daddy come to the
college, you introduced everyone...

577
01:14:19,001 --> 01:14:21,367
Why didn't you say it freely?

578
01:14:22,571 --> 01:14:26,029
Why did you hestitate then?
What feelings were you hiding?

579
01:14:26,575 --> 01:14:29,567
Oh sure, despite
knowing everything...

580
01:14:29,912 --> 01:14:32,312
why've you been acting as
if you didn't know anything?

581
01:14:32,581 --> 01:14:34,378
What will I take that for?

582
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:37,312
Despite knowing everything,
you gifted me an ashtray

583
01:14:37,653 --> 01:14:39,587
Okay, you gave that to me
as a friend

584
01:14:39,855 --> 01:14:42,187
But when I was talking to my Ma
the other day...

585
01:14:42,391 --> 01:14:43,915
when I was showering kisses on her...

586
01:14:44,026 --> 01:14:46,494
why did you badly
want to know the truth?

587
01:14:46,762 --> 01:14:50,323
You calmed down only after you
got to know that Madhu's my Ma

588
01:14:51,634 --> 01:14:55,161
You presented me an ashtray.
All right, maybe that's friendship

589
01:14:55,604 --> 01:15:00,303
But the restlessness you showed
when you wanted to know about my Ma...

590
01:15:00,609 --> 01:15:03,043
the streak of possessiveness you
showed, what do I take that for?

591
01:15:12,521 --> 01:15:15,615
Let's not stray from the point.
Didn't you stare at my waist?

592
01:15:17,293 --> 01:15:19,625
Haven't you loved me?

593
01:15:19,995 --> 01:15:21,986
No.
- I didn't stare either

594
01:15:28,637 --> 01:15:32,630
I happen to talk to a girl
and she finds faults with me!

595
01:15:33,642 --> 01:15:35,974
I can't ever be friends
with an egoistic girl like her!

596
01:15:36,212 --> 01:15:38,203
Even if we are friends,
it's never going to lead to love

597
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:40,371
Even if we fall in love,
we'll never marry

598
01:15:40,516 --> 01:15:42,507
And even if we somehow
make it to the marriage altar...

599
01:15:42,651 --> 01:15:47,054
I'll say that I can't marry a girl
like her and run away from there!

600
01:15:50,659 --> 01:15:51,853
What a girl!

601
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:05,006
You have no right to
talk about my character

602
01:16:07,042 --> 01:16:10,671
I'll forget that I ever
met someone called Karan

603
01:16:12,681 --> 01:16:16,674
You and I have nothing
to do with each other

604
01:16:57,490 --> 01:16:59,981
She looks like a twin-sister
of our master

605
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:05,253
Excuse me, you're not
our master's twin, are you?

606
01:17:05,665 --> 01:17:08,657
Oh no. There are only
sisters in our family

607
01:17:10,002 --> 01:17:12,994
It's the master himself.
What disguise is this, Master?

608
01:17:13,339 --> 01:17:18,276
What? People go to great lengths
to have an album released

609
01:17:18,678 --> 01:17:21,272
I've only changed my name.
From Madan to Badan Bhosle

610
01:17:21,681 --> 01:17:25,549
So what's wrong?
- Name an album of yours, Master

611
01:17:26,118 --> 01:17:28,746
Don't be stubborn, my love
- How about humming the tune?

612
01:17:29,288 --> 01:17:31,813
The tune? It's fantastic

613
01:17:32,558 --> 01:17:36,289
I've really worked hard on this song.
When it's released...

614
01:17:36,629 --> 01:17:40,463
it's going to kick up a storm.
Want me to sing it for you?

615
01:17:43,302 --> 01:17:46,533
The bud of the night,
blossoms by day

616
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:50,634
She's mischievous...
she wanders everywhere

617
01:17:51,310 --> 01:17:54,905
What else will I say?

618
01:17:55,314 --> 01:17:57,646
Don't be stubborn, my love

619
01:18:07,326 --> 01:18:10,659
That's a number from Asha Bhosle's
hit album Jaanam Samjha Karo

620
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:14,493
What nonsense!
That's the title of a movie!

621
01:18:15,334 --> 01:18:18,132
The album of the same name was a hit,
but the film was shit

622
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:25,009
What's between you and me?
- That's for you to decide, sir

623
01:18:25,344 --> 01:18:28,006
I'll decide later. Now tell me
what do you mean to me?

624
01:18:28,214 --> 01:18:30,205
Your secretary, sir.
- And what's a secretary's job?

625
01:18:30,349 --> 01:18:34,012
You must go out in the market and
find out which album is doing well...

626
01:18:34,253 --> 01:18:37,518
and what the get up is...
so that they don't clash with ours

627
01:18:38,357 --> 01:18:40,018
What sorry?

628
01:18:40,459 --> 01:18:44,361
Well, sir...
- No wells! That's it

629
01:18:45,631 --> 01:18:48,122
Want me to sing another song?
- Sure. Go ahead

630
01:18:49,368 --> 01:18:52,860
What would I do,
if not die?

631
01:18:53,272 --> 01:18:56,764
You're the chosen one
in thousands...

632
01:18:57,176 --> 01:18:59,041
my love

633
01:19:35,481 --> 01:19:39,417
Do not be mistaken.
I haven't come here for a compromise

634
01:19:42,655 --> 01:19:44,646
Why? Is that wrong?

635
01:19:45,057 --> 01:19:46,820
I don't want to...

636
01:19:48,694 --> 01:19:50,218
with you...

637
01:19:53,766 --> 01:19:57,429
I don't want any argument.
I have something important to say

638
01:19:58,571 --> 01:20:01,165
During the summer vacations
when we were not around...

639
01:20:01,574 --> 01:20:05,442
a lot of things have taken place.
Vicky went to meet Priya at her place

640
01:20:05,845 --> 01:20:08,177
He mistook her father for her
and awakened him

641
01:20:08,614 --> 01:20:10,241
He was caught

642
01:20:12,651 --> 01:20:15,449
Priya's father is holding her
captive in the house

643
01:20:16,455 --> 01:20:18,446
Did Vicky attend class?
- No

644
01:20:18,991 --> 01:20:23,121
The love affair we promoted
is now facing problems

645
01:20:24,597 --> 01:20:27,464
I'm talking about Vicky
and Priya's love affair

646
01:20:30,603 --> 01:20:32,161
Did you meet Priya?

647
01:20:35,007 --> 01:20:37,942
I mean, have you?
- Yes

648
01:20:38,811 --> 01:20:42,474
I've come from her house right now.
She was crying

649
01:20:43,282 --> 01:20:51,883
I told her not to worry. To unite her
with Vicky is my duty, I promised her

650
01:20:52,491 --> 01:20:56,825
And you have promised your friend
to unite the two of them

651
01:20:58,764 --> 01:21:02,495
So, to honour the promise
I've made to my friend...

652
01:21:02,902 --> 01:21:06,497
and for you to honour the promise
you've made to your friend, we must...

653
01:21:08,507 --> 01:21:09,997
We must?

654
01:21:12,511 --> 01:21:15,173
We must get together
and unite them

655
01:21:20,519 --> 01:21:26,515
We must... what I'm saying is that
...I want to make it clear

656
01:21:30,796 --> 01:21:34,527
In uniting them, the relationship
we are going to share...

657
01:21:34,934 --> 01:21:37,198
is what I'll decide right now

658
01:21:39,738 --> 01:21:45,540
It will not be love, no friendship
and no relationship at all

659
01:21:50,616 --> 01:21:54,552
Our relationship will last as long
as they are united

660
01:21:58,791 --> 01:22:03,888
I hope you will do that

661
01:22:05,998 --> 01:22:09,934
That you will do it,
I am convinced

662
01:22:12,638 --> 01:22:16,301
What can I say now?
You've said what I wanted to

663
01:22:18,577 --> 01:22:20,909
Shall we go to meet Vicky?

664
01:22:40,666 --> 01:22:43,931
You're the limit! You couldn't
wait for two months

665
01:22:47,606 --> 01:22:52,134
All I want to know is what you told
Priya's old man when you woke him up

666
01:22:52,478 --> 01:22:54,469
Priya darling, here I am?
Or was it...

667
01:22:54,613 --> 01:22:56,410
Sorry, Uncle. Wrong number?

668
01:22:59,618 --> 01:23:02,416
This is exactly why I tell you
not to fall in love!

669
01:23:02,788 --> 01:23:06,417
Look at me. I'm such a happy man!
And why?

670
01:23:06,892 --> 01:23:11,955
Because I'm not in love with someone!
And I don't have any problems like you

671
01:23:12,932 --> 01:23:16,231
Look at your face. You look like
the perfect jilted-Iover

672
01:23:24,109 --> 01:23:30,309
To hide your pain and fake a laughter
is nothing but stupidity

673
01:23:30,849 --> 01:23:33,977
What?
- I'm talking about Vicky's pain

674
01:23:34,653 --> 01:23:36,553
The one you're feeling too

675
01:23:37,656 --> 01:23:41,649
Will it solve the problem by
feeling the pain and crying? No

676
01:23:45,397 --> 01:23:48,662
Just concentrate on your studies,
Vicky. As for your love...

677
01:23:49,068 --> 01:23:52,663
leave it to us. To unite you
with Priya is our responsibility

678
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:58,835
Can't you trust my words?
All right

679
01:23:59,678 --> 01:24:03,944
But you do trust your love,
don't you? If your love is true...

680
01:24:04,283 --> 01:24:07,480
it'll surely unite the two of you.
Am I right?

681
01:24:09,688 --> 01:24:13,283
If our love is true,
it'll surely unite us

682
01:24:18,097 --> 01:24:21,362
Yes.
- Yes, yes indeed

683
01:24:41,787 --> 01:24:44,517
Where's the need to walk?
I'll drop you home

684
01:24:48,727 --> 01:24:53,391
You needn't necessarily be my
girlfriend for me to drop you home

685
01:24:54,533 --> 01:24:57,730
It doesn't need a relationship at all.
You could say...

686
01:24:58,070 --> 01:25:00,334
you've taken a ride
in a stranger's car

687
01:25:00,806 --> 01:25:04,071
And I'll think I gave a ride
to a girl who was a stranger

688
01:25:07,146 --> 01:25:11,742
If you still want to walk,
it's upto you

689
01:25:12,751 --> 01:25:14,946
What can I do about it?

690
01:25:15,487 --> 01:25:18,149
I live in the hostel now.
Not in that flat

691
01:25:19,758 --> 01:25:23,421
To distance myself from some one,
I had to stay at the hostel

692
01:25:27,966 --> 01:25:30,230
I'll drop you at the hostel then

693
01:26:24,623 --> 01:26:30,823
Two strangers,
where are they headed?

694
01:26:31,563 --> 01:26:33,724
Where are they going?

695
01:26:39,538 --> 01:26:44,237
Angry with each other...

696
01:26:44,943 --> 01:26:49,175
they appear to be,
even as they drive on

697
01:27:00,225 --> 01:27:06,858
Two strangers...
where are they headed?

698
01:27:07,299 --> 01:27:09,460
Where are they going?

699
01:27:15,207 --> 01:27:19,871
Angry with each other...

700
01:27:20,679 --> 01:27:24,877
they appear to be,
even as they drive on

701
01:28:13,432 --> 01:28:15,263
Awake...

702
01:28:15,701 --> 01:28:17,726
asleep...

703
01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:20,261
Iost?

704
01:28:20,739 --> 01:28:22,604
Ask them

705
01:28:33,952 --> 01:28:38,514
Stop faking anger...
be friends again

706
01:28:38,957 --> 01:28:43,951
Do not break each other's hearts,
that isn't a nice thing to do

707
01:28:49,968 --> 01:28:51,959
From a distance...

708
01:28:52,237 --> 01:28:54,228
up close...

709
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:59,636
they torment each other,
they go together

710
01:29:42,054 --> 01:29:46,388
Desire, hatred...

711
01:29:47,025 --> 01:29:51,018
what exactly do they
want in love?

712
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:04,708
Yes and no...

713
01:30:05,177 --> 01:30:07,577
is all they say

714
01:30:07,946 --> 01:30:12,383
What's in their hearts?
No one knows

715
01:30:18,490 --> 01:30:23,052
Longing in their eyes,
to see each other...

716
01:30:24,062 --> 01:30:28,328
they're afraid,
they go together

717
01:30:39,077 --> 01:30:45,482
Two strangers...
where are they headed?

718
01:30:46,151 --> 01:30:48,415
Where are they going?

719
01:30:54,459 --> 01:30:58,759
Angry with each other...

720
01:30:59,564 --> 01:31:03,864
they appear to be,
even as they drive on

721
01:31:36,234 --> 01:31:39,465
I have't done anything this time.
It has stalled on its own

722
01:31:51,149 --> 01:31:53,140
The wire of the spark-plug
has come off

723
01:32:31,623 --> 01:32:34,456
God! I haven't seen anything
- What?

724
01:32:36,695 --> 01:32:38,185
Nothing

725
01:32:49,474 --> 01:32:53,604
When a stranger drops me home,
I always thank him

726
01:32:54,613 --> 01:32:57,207
That's a habit of mine.
- Nice habit too

727
01:33:08,426 --> 01:33:13,955
Because of my native tongue, you got
to know that I'm from the villages!

728
01:33:14,599 --> 01:33:16,226
You want to rob me?
- No, sir

729
01:33:16,301 --> 01:33:20,237
Thief! I asked you to take me
to Mumbai University and...

730
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:22,971
you've been taking me around Mumbai!

731
01:33:23,542 --> 01:33:25,840
You've been driving
around the same place!

732
01:33:26,244 --> 01:33:28,508
Forget it, sir.
It's human to err

733
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:31,012
Looks like you're
hand in glove with him

734
01:33:34,252 --> 01:33:36,914
Please let him go, Uncle

735
01:33:39,257 --> 01:33:41,555
Come with me.
I'll give you a ride

736
01:33:42,694 --> 01:33:46,596
You don't appear to be a cabbie.
Why will you give me a ride?

737
01:33:46,932 --> 01:33:48,923
He's the one who'll take me there.
You go on

738
01:33:51,269 --> 01:33:54,067
Until you leave, no one else
will be able to move from here

739
01:33:54,606 --> 01:33:56,733
The traffic's come to a standstill
because of you

740
01:33:58,276 --> 01:34:01,803
I study at the Bombay University too.
Come with me, I'll take you there

741
01:34:06,284 --> 01:34:08,081
You take me to be an idiot?

742
01:34:11,289 --> 01:34:13,086
The moron!

743
01:34:15,627 --> 01:34:19,290
Son, how do you live in this city?

744
01:34:20,732 --> 01:34:23,633
Everyone here appears to be
a fraud to me

745
01:34:25,303 --> 01:34:27,203
But you're a nice boy

746
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:30,972
Guess what I like most about you?

747
01:34:33,645 --> 01:34:35,306
Your smile

748
01:34:37,315 --> 01:34:40,978
Do you know my daughter?
- Who?

749
01:34:46,324 --> 01:34:49,725
How would you know her? There must
be so many girls in the college

750
01:34:51,329 --> 01:34:56,733
There's this hostel near the college.
- Which hostel?

751
01:34:57,502 --> 01:35:02,337
Now what is the name?
Mary...

752
01:35:07,579 --> 01:35:10,343
Right, St Mary's Girls Hostel!

753
01:35:12,350 --> 01:35:15,080
Do you know where the hostel is?
- Know?

754
01:35:17,589 --> 01:35:20,581
I can't ever forget that hostel.
- Why?

755
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,160
There's this girl I know
who stays there

756
01:35:24,729 --> 01:35:28,722
She's no ordinary girl, mind you.
She has a massive ego

757
01:35:29,434 --> 01:35:31,698
What?
- Ego

758
01:35:32,771 --> 01:35:36,366
Meaning?
- Ego meaning...

759
01:35:38,043 --> 01:35:40,876
she thinks she's the last word

760
01:35:44,382 --> 01:35:48,842
Even when she knows she's wrong,
she'll never say sorry

761
01:35:52,891 --> 01:35:54,882
This damn ego...

762
01:35:55,894 --> 01:36:01,389
how will I explain it?
This girl...

763
01:36:02,133 --> 01:36:05,569
she's stubborn, a bit eccentric...

764
01:36:09,407 --> 01:36:14,811
I get it. That daughter
of an ass is arrogant

765
01:36:15,413 --> 01:36:16,812
Yes, arrogant!

766
01:36:21,419 --> 01:36:26,413
I wanted to tell you about the girl,
but you've spoken about her family!

767
01:36:34,699 --> 01:36:41,434
She's just a girl, you know.
If she can be so arrogant...

768
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:44,434
am I any less?
- Oh yes

769
01:36:49,180 --> 01:36:50,442
Oh yes!

770
01:36:52,917 --> 01:36:53,906
Oh yes!

771
01:36:58,456 --> 01:37:03,052
That's the block.
- Thank you very much

772
01:37:03,795 --> 01:37:09,631
I live in Chamoli, son. If you ever
visit the place, do meet me

773
01:37:11,469 --> 01:37:12,697
See you

774
01:37:15,206 --> 01:37:17,003
Lali! My child!

775
01:37:19,544 --> 01:37:21,478
How are you?
- I'm fine

776
01:37:21,946 --> 01:37:24,471
Why're you so late?
- What will I tell you?

777
01:37:25,016 --> 01:37:27,814
On my way, I got into
a fight with a cabbie

778
01:37:28,286 --> 01:37:31,983
It was a terrible fight and
this nice boy really helped me

779
01:37:32,824 --> 01:37:35,292
He... one moment!

780
01:37:37,228 --> 01:37:39,492
Hello son... hello!

781
01:37:39,898 --> 01:37:41,763
Come here

782
01:37:43,201 --> 01:37:44,691
Lali, come here

783
01:38:01,519 --> 01:38:05,512
As I was telling you, I got into
a fight with a crazy cabbie

784
01:38:06,124 --> 01:38:09,252
And a decent boy came along
and helped me. He's the one

785
01:38:10,061 --> 01:38:11,858
This is my daughter, Lali

786
01:38:25,543 --> 01:38:28,808
Have some coffee before you leave.
- Thanks, but I've got to go

787
01:38:29,247 --> 01:38:33,240
Oh no. Back in the village, we don't
let a guest go away without...

788
01:38:33,551 --> 01:38:36,816
extending our hospitality. If you
leave without having coffee...

789
01:38:37,055 --> 01:38:39,888
I'm going to feel bad.
Tell him to stay, dear

790
01:38:43,761 --> 01:38:45,752
Please have some coffee

791
01:38:48,566 --> 01:38:53,970
I'll go and lock my car.
- All right. Let's go

792
01:38:56,774 --> 01:38:59,334
I don't want to get married.
- Why not?

793
01:38:59,978 --> 01:39:02,572
When you wanted to study further,
I agreed with you

794
01:39:02,914 --> 01:39:05,906
And now that I want you to get
married, you must listen to me

795
01:39:07,585 --> 01:39:09,849
Come, son.
Have some coffee

796
01:39:10,388 --> 01:39:12,982
I just don't agree!
- Why not?

797
01:39:13,391 --> 01:39:15,791
Look at her, son.
She's not listening to me

798
01:39:21,399 --> 01:39:24,926
You must listen to Papa, mustn't you?
- Do you know what he's saying?

799
01:39:25,603 --> 01:39:28,595
And this is between the two of us.
You aren't interfering

800
01:39:29,073 --> 01:39:32,270
You'll get a slap, Lali.
He's a guest...

801
01:39:32,610 --> 01:39:37,104
is that how you talk to a guest?
What wrong have I said, son?

802
01:39:37,615 --> 01:39:40,345
I'm looking for a groom for her
and she's refusing me

803
01:39:44,889 --> 01:39:50,350
When a girl keeps refusing to get
married, what does it mean?

804
01:39:50,995 --> 01:39:54,624
It means there is someone else
she loves

805
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:59,966
I'm not against that. All I want
is for you to have a nice wedding

806
01:40:00,705 --> 01:40:06,439
But how should the suitor be?
He must be just like this boy

807
01:40:08,646 --> 01:40:13,447
Clean-hearted, innocent eyes...
a handsome young man

808
01:40:15,987 --> 01:40:19,980
If there is someone you love,
tell me about it

809
01:40:22,660 --> 01:40:24,924
I'm not in love with anyone

810
01:40:25,663 --> 01:40:29,064
If you really don't love anyone,
you must obey your Papa

811
01:40:31,669 --> 01:40:35,662
Papa, I'm willing to get married.
- Wow!

812
01:40:37,775 --> 01:40:39,470
This is amazing!

813
01:40:39,677 --> 01:40:42,407
I've been trying for so long
and she just wouldn't agree

814
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:46,013
You spoke to her just once
and viola! She agreed!

815
01:40:46,851 --> 01:40:49,684
Looks like we share the
same birth-sign, son

816
01:40:50,688 --> 01:40:53,680
I had a problem with the cabbie
and you solved

817
01:40:54,692 --> 01:40:57,684
And this problem of her marriage
you have solved too

818
01:40:58,696 --> 01:41:02,928
I'm happy to have achieved
what I set out to do

819
01:41:03,468 --> 01:41:06,869
Lali, I'm leaving by this
evening's train

820
01:41:07,305 --> 01:41:09,239
Do look after yourself, okay?

821
01:41:09,574 --> 01:41:12,509
Come on... drop me on the way

822
01:41:16,814 --> 01:41:20,716
Lali, I forgot to tell you
something very important

823
01:41:21,719 --> 01:41:24,449
There's a girl he knows
who stays here

824
01:41:26,257 --> 01:41:29,192
They have a fight going
between themselves

825
01:41:31,729 --> 01:41:34,391
Never mind, Uncle. Please...
- Now wait a moment

826
01:41:34,732 --> 01:41:37,530
Won't I do anything for all the help
you've extended to me?

827
01:41:37,902 --> 01:41:39,460
What will people say?

828
01:41:39,737 --> 01:41:46,734
She's a very arrogant girl, Lali.
As he said, she's very stubborn too

829
01:41:47,178 --> 01:41:50,170
Not just stubborn, she's...

830
01:41:51,749 --> 01:41:56,083
a bit mental, eko...
what word did you use?

831
01:41:56,754 --> 01:42:01,191
Never mind, Uncle. Forget it...
- Give me the word! What was it?

832
01:42:04,962 --> 01:42:10,161
Yes! Ego!
She's possessed by ego!

833
01:42:10,768 --> 01:42:14,363
Like spirits taking possession
of people's bodies...

834
01:42:14,772 --> 01:42:17,468
this girl is possessed with ego!

835
01:42:19,243 --> 01:42:23,771
Ask the girl not to
fight with him, dear

836
01:42:24,182 --> 01:42:28,175
He's a very nice boy. Even my Papa
believes he's a very nice boy

837
01:42:28,686 --> 01:42:30,677
Bring the two of them together.
Okay?

838
01:42:33,057 --> 01:42:37,187
Will that be enough or do you want me
to stay over for your help, son?

839
01:42:37,595 --> 01:42:39,790
No thank you, Uncle.
You've done so much!

840
01:42:40,198 --> 01:42:42,792
That's all right...
See you

841
01:42:43,334 --> 01:42:48,397
She's a fool to get into a fight
with a nice boy like you

842
01:42:48,973 --> 01:42:52,136
It isn't her fault. It must be
her father who...

843
01:42:52,543 --> 01:42:56,206
has really pampered
the arrogant girl

844
01:42:58,316 --> 01:43:02,480
What has come to be?
And why?

845
01:43:04,322 --> 01:43:09,055
Don't think about it...

846
01:43:11,329 --> 01:43:19,327
Think, how could that girl blow such
a little thing out of proportion?

847
01:43:22,073 --> 01:43:27,841
I can't get this. This little part
of the female anatomy...

848
01:43:29,847 --> 01:43:34,841
Don't remind me, please!
- Everyone gets to look at it

849
01:43:35,353 --> 01:43:42,452
What went wrong if you looked at it?
In Mumbai, girls expose their legs

850
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:44,851
This is just what
I can't understand!

851
01:43:47,331 --> 01:43:53,861
Your friend Shibu has come all the
way from Kolkata to solve your problem

852
01:43:54,872 --> 01:43:56,863
And I'll solve it too

853
01:44:01,546 --> 01:44:05,312
Look at this. Once this goes in,
your woes will vanish

854
01:44:07,251 --> 01:44:11,881
No thanks. I don't drink.
I don't want it

855
01:44:12,156 --> 01:44:17,890
Drink it up... listen to me.
Just a little... come on

856
01:44:24,902 --> 01:44:26,233
Fun?

857
01:44:28,906 --> 01:44:33,639
I'll now sing a hit song for you

858
01:44:34,912 --> 01:44:37,244
You'll find happiness

859
01:44:57,368 --> 01:45:02,431
Shut up! You make me sadder!

860
01:45:02,940 --> 01:45:07,274
Drink some more. The more you drink,
the more your problems will vanish

861
01:45:10,281 --> 01:45:12,943
You didn't approve of the
Bengali song, did you?

862
01:45:13,517 --> 01:45:15,747
I'll sing a song from Mumbai
for you

863
01:45:18,956 --> 01:45:23,290
Everyone wants a slender waist

864
01:45:36,374 --> 01:45:42,973
If only your heart
could win over the waist

865
01:45:57,995 --> 01:45:59,986
Fun, wasn't it?

866
01:46:00,398 --> 01:46:05,734
The song's over, so is the booze

867
01:46:12,009 --> 01:46:14,000
You have a smoke...

868
01:46:18,649 --> 01:46:20,810
I'll get lots of booze

869
01:46:32,029 --> 01:46:40,027
When you drop ash in this ashtray
you must know it's not the ashtray...

870
01:46:41,439 --> 01:46:43,839
but me it's falling on.
- Oh yes!

871
01:47:00,057 --> 01:47:04,050
What are you staring at?
This way

872
01:47:07,398 --> 01:47:10,060
This way... look here

873
01:47:13,070 --> 01:47:14,867
What?

874
01:47:16,374 --> 01:47:20,868
What are you staring at
with your big...

875
01:47:24,248 --> 01:47:29,481
no, with your two small eyes.
What are you looking at?

876
01:47:51,175 --> 01:47:55,111
All I did was to look
at this little waist

877
01:47:56,614 --> 01:48:01,108
Who do you think you are?
You're very beautiful?

878
01:48:02,286 --> 01:48:07,451
Your face is like a chameleon's,
a pencil-thin nose...

879
01:48:10,194 --> 01:48:13,129
and your body?
It's all right

880
01:48:14,698 --> 01:48:18,134
Your waist is the only thing
one can look at

881
01:48:18,636 --> 01:48:20,627
This little waist

882
01:48:23,140 --> 01:48:28,134
Draped in a black sari,
that little area...

883
01:48:28,579 --> 01:48:34,677
is like a lemon.
No, lemons are yellow

884
01:48:37,154 --> 01:48:41,818
In reds and yellows, if it's shown up
in a romantic light...

885
01:48:42,059 --> 01:48:45,153
naturally, I will look at it.
If you mind...

886
01:48:45,362 --> 01:48:47,694
you mustn't show it at all

887
01:48:49,567 --> 01:48:53,765
Just as your face is a part
of your body, so is your waist

888
01:48:54,171 --> 01:48:57,971
I look at your face, you don't mind.
I see the waist, you mind. What for?

889
01:48:58,509 --> 01:49:00,909
Tell me, darling. Speak

890
01:49:02,646 --> 01:49:06,776
Not just your body, I'm going to
take a look at your whole body now

891
01:49:12,690 --> 01:49:15,750
You have no right to
stand there before me!

892
01:50:17,588 --> 01:50:19,579
You have no right to touch it!

893
01:50:35,406 --> 01:50:37,738
I came here to discuss
something important with you

894
01:50:38,175 --> 01:50:41,269
But neither are you in the mood to
listen, nor am I in the mood to tell

895
01:50:50,621 --> 01:50:54,853
Khushi, I've done nothing.
It's my Bengali friend

896
01:50:55,292 --> 01:50:57,283
He forced me to drink

897
01:50:59,396 --> 01:51:03,093
If people smoke and drink,
why must I care?

898
01:51:03,767 --> 01:51:07,635
It isn't necessary for me
to know why you had liquor

899
01:51:28,325 --> 01:51:29,656
Want some?

900
01:51:32,496 --> 01:51:35,829
I came here because I thought
you were a nice human being

901
01:51:36,333 --> 01:51:39,131
But you're worse than
I could ever imagine

902
01:51:44,341 --> 01:51:46,002
If you'd listen...

903
01:52:32,556 --> 01:52:35,889
You're a performer...

904
01:52:36,593 --> 01:52:39,391
you can't make me dance

905
01:52:40,497 --> 01:52:43,898
When it's your turn...

906
01:52:44,401 --> 01:52:47,063
you'll beat a hasty retreat

907
01:52:50,507 --> 01:52:55,069
Master, that's Altaf Raja's tune.
- Altaf Raja? A foreigner?

908
01:52:55,412 --> 01:52:59,405
He's a famous qawwal. This is
a tune from his famous album

909
01:53:00,751 --> 01:53:02,742
How's that possible?
- It is

910
01:53:03,420 --> 01:53:06,412
You must've heard the tune
and pinched it

911
01:53:07,491 --> 01:53:11,757
But this is a three-year old tune.
- What a thief!

912
01:53:12,429 --> 01:53:17,093
I composed the tune three days ago,
and he stole it three years back!

913
01:53:17,835 --> 01:53:19,700
No more qawwali for me!

914
01:53:32,850 --> 01:53:35,182
How did you know it's Priya
without even looking at her?

915
01:53:35,719 --> 01:53:40,850
The fragrance! I can tell every
beautiful girl from her fragrance

916
01:53:42,459 --> 01:53:44,791
Where's this stink coming from?
Lay off!

917
01:53:51,535 --> 01:53:54,265
You like my wig, don't you?
Here you are

918
01:54:04,648 --> 01:54:08,482
Remember, the cultural programme at
the college is fast approaching?

919
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:13,083
Join Karan immediately
and start your rehearsals

920
01:54:13,957 --> 01:54:15,618
No, Master.
- Why?

921
01:54:16,493 --> 01:54:19,087
I can't participate in this function.
- Why not?

922
01:54:19,830 --> 01:54:21,957
I've told you. I'm not participating

923
01:54:28,505 --> 01:54:34,102
Mukesh, make a team of Karan and Roma
and send them on the stage

924
01:54:34,511 --> 01:54:36,308
You have my blessings!

925
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:47,513
Who's Roma?
- You don't know Roma? Roma!

926
01:54:47,925 --> 01:54:51,918
A new student in the first year!
She's kicked up a storm in the college

927
01:54:52,396 --> 01:54:56,924
The students are crazy about her
and go around her like blind men

928
01:54:57,334 --> 01:54:58,232
What for?

929
01:55:26,930 --> 01:55:30,229
Could you help me cross the road?
- What for?

930
01:55:30,567 --> 01:55:32,967
A blind man needs help

931
01:56:00,931 --> 01:56:03,593
You've crossed the road.
- Small road

932
01:56:03,934 --> 01:56:06,596
What?
- You've helped a blind man

933
01:56:07,004 --> 01:56:09,598
Thank you so much.
You are large-hearted

934
01:56:13,677 --> 01:56:16,009
Slipped out of my hands! Damn it!

935
01:56:28,125 --> 01:56:30,423
What is the matter?
- Priya has sent a letter

936
01:56:31,128 --> 01:56:33,119
You can give it to Vicky.
- It's not for him

937
01:56:33,297 --> 01:56:34,628
Is it for me?
- No

938
01:56:34,798 --> 01:56:36,197
It must be for you then.
- No

939
01:56:36,366 --> 01:56:38,630
If not for me, you nor Vicky...
- It's for the two of us!

940
01:56:50,981 --> 01:56:52,972
You read it

941
01:57:01,992 --> 01:57:04,256
I love Vicky so dearly...

942
01:57:04,661 --> 01:57:07,459
I don't think anyone in
the world loves anyone as much

943
01:57:08,265 --> 01:57:12,998
You must think why every lover
in the world says that

944
01:57:14,037 --> 01:57:16,471
It's because they have
true love for each other

945
01:57:17,274 --> 01:57:21,267
And the suffering of separation
those truly in love go through...

946
01:57:21,678 --> 01:57:23,475
only I know about

947
01:57:23,914 --> 01:57:28,681
I'm pining to meet Vicky.
Please bring us together

948
01:57:30,754 --> 01:57:32,483
Yours, Priya

949
01:57:33,690 --> 01:57:35,282
What are we to do now?

950
01:57:37,694 --> 01:57:40,060
Priya has a friend called
Shehnaz, right?

951
01:57:46,703 --> 01:57:48,466
How are you, Rukhsana?
- I'm fine

952
01:57:49,706 --> 01:57:51,230
Be careful, Vicky

953
01:57:55,712 --> 01:57:58,112
The two of you chat,
I'm going to bed

954
01:58:07,457 --> 01:58:09,448
Who's this girl?

955
01:58:09,726 --> 01:58:11,717
It's Shabana.
Shehnaz's friend

956
01:58:22,739 --> 01:58:25,071
Is she coming here
for the first time?

957
01:58:26,143 --> 01:58:27,132
Yes

958
01:58:28,912 --> 01:58:32,746
I see. Go ahead and
chat with Rukhsana...

959
01:58:33,550 --> 01:58:35,745
I'll take Shabana around the house

960
01:58:36,219 --> 01:58:38,210
Come on, Shabana.
- Run away, Vicky!

961
01:59:07,217 --> 01:59:09,777
Car number 906.
Is it yours?

962
01:59:10,220 --> 01:59:11,778
Yes.
- Karan?

963
02:01:57,954 --> 02:01:59,945
Let me do it

964
02:02:56,012 --> 02:02:59,004
How are you related to the girl?
- I...

965
02:03:00,483 --> 02:03:03,748
Help me with the injection.
- All right

966
02:03:17,701 --> 02:03:19,032
In the waist

967
02:03:23,039 --> 02:03:26,031
Give it to her in the arm.
- This is meant for the waist

968
02:03:26,209 --> 02:03:28,837
No, give it to her in the arm.
- The one for the arm...

969
02:03:29,112 --> 02:03:32,707
is given in the arm, the one
for the waist is given in the waist

970
02:03:35,618 --> 02:03:38,610
You don't know anything
about this waist, doctor

971
02:03:39,122 --> 02:03:43,388
This waist has caused
a very big problem already

972
02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:47,791
If I go into details,
it'll take at least 2 hours

973
02:03:48,264 --> 02:03:50,858
Your duty hours will be over
and when the next doctor comes...

974
02:03:51,201 --> 02:03:54,728
I'll have to explain to him!
Have mercy on me...

975
02:03:55,071 --> 02:03:57,062
and give it to her in the arm

976
02:04:03,079 --> 02:04:06,810
That's all right!
You can give it wherever you wish

977
02:04:07,317 --> 02:04:10,753
Give it to anyone. To her,
the nurse or yourself...

978
02:04:11,488 --> 02:04:13,888
I've seen nothing,
I will see nothing

979
02:04:15,558 --> 02:04:18,425
God, why did You make
this waist? Why?

980
02:04:46,556 --> 02:04:49,548
My heart, my love...

981
02:04:51,694 --> 02:04:54,458
I've given to you

982
02:04:56,132 --> 02:04:59,124
My love...

983
02:05:01,171 --> 02:05:04,140
what have you done?

984
02:05:05,241 --> 02:05:09,143
When our gaze met,
I realised...

985
02:05:09,846 --> 02:05:14,146
I'm crazy about you

986
02:05:14,751 --> 02:05:18,687
It's something my heart knows

987
02:05:19,956 --> 02:05:23,551
You're the one
I've taken for my beloved

988
02:06:36,232 --> 02:06:39,827
On your lips, is a smile.
Your eyes hold an intoxication

989
02:06:40,270 --> 02:06:44,229
The sight of you
makes my heart sway

990
02:06:45,542 --> 02:06:49,911
I love you all day and night.
I find peace only after meeting you

991
02:06:51,114 --> 02:06:59,044
Your dark tressses
lend a fragrance to my being

992
02:07:00,156 --> 02:07:04,593
All I wish to say is that
it's your arms I must stay in

993
02:07:05,261 --> 02:07:09,527
Don't ever forget
this promise

994
02:07:10,133 --> 02:07:14,263
Don't make me cry,
now that you make me smile

995
02:07:14,971 --> 02:07:18,873
Don't make excuses...

996
02:07:20,076 --> 02:07:23,944
don't ever hide
anything from me

997
02:07:30,887 --> 02:07:33,947
My heart, my love...

998
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:38,956
I've given to you

999
02:08:29,145 --> 02:08:32,945
My dream, my desire...

1000
02:08:33,349 --> 02:08:37,342
is to adorn your arms
with bridal bangles

1001
02:08:38,354 --> 02:08:42,916
These lovely meetings,
I love the way you talk...

1002
02:08:43,526 --> 02:08:47,519
Should you consent, my love...

1003
02:08:47,864 --> 02:08:51,698
I'd bring the bridal palanquin
to your house

1004
02:08:53,036 --> 02:08:57,632
I spend my nights pining.
I dream of marriage

1005
02:08:58,441 --> 02:09:02,377
My world of love,
you must embellish...

1006
02:09:03,046 --> 02:09:06,709
never leave me ever

1007
02:09:08,251 --> 02:09:11,880
Keep your promises

1008
02:09:12,889 --> 02:09:16,882
Always hold me in your arms

1009
02:09:23,299 --> 02:09:26,791
My heart, my love...

1010
02:09:28,805 --> 02:09:31,399
I've given to you

1011
02:09:33,676 --> 02:09:36,406
My love...

1012
02:09:38,414 --> 02:09:41,406
what have you done?

1013
02:09:55,832 --> 02:09:57,424
What is it? What?

1014
02:09:57,600 --> 02:10:00,091
I tried several times to
meet you at your office

1015
02:10:00,436 --> 02:10:03,098
But you staff wouldn't let me.
So...

1016
02:10:04,974 --> 02:10:06,965
My name is Karan

1017
02:10:08,444 --> 02:10:11,436
Vicky's my friend, sir.
His past is nothing...

1018
02:10:12,181 --> 02:10:15,241
at present, he's a student
and he has a very bright future

1019
02:10:15,618 --> 02:10:17,449
You don't know that,
but I do

1020
02:10:17,787 --> 02:10:20,950
At my age, my father was
even worse off than Vicky is

1021
02:10:22,458 --> 02:10:25,450
At this age, even you...
don't take offense

1022
02:10:25,962 --> 02:10:28,795
You used to be a small-time thug

1023
02:10:29,532 --> 02:10:31,864
But I tell you, at your age...

1024
02:10:32,034 --> 02:10:35,470
Vicky will be far ahead of you,
me and even my father

1025
02:10:37,573 --> 02:10:40,474
Apart from all this,
he has a very kind heart

1026
02:10:43,479 --> 02:10:46,471
When a boy falls in love
with a girl...

1027
02:10:47,550 --> 02:10:50,485
and he finds the girl
without any problem...

1028
02:10:52,488 --> 02:10:57,221
imagine how happy it'll make him.
Please don't separate them

1029
02:10:57,894 --> 02:11:00,089
Please unite them

1030
02:11:08,504 --> 02:11:11,234
Your two minutes are up.
Let's go, Gotya

1031
02:11:15,311 --> 02:11:17,176
Did he have nothing to say?

1032
02:11:17,513 --> 02:11:19,913
Your two minutes are up, he said.
And left

1033
02:11:24,520 --> 02:11:27,114
All right.
Even if he said nothing...

1034
02:11:27,523 --> 02:11:30,788
couldn't you guess
what was on his mind?

1035
02:11:31,127 --> 02:11:34,528
What?
- I ask...

1036
02:11:34,797 --> 02:11:37,527
couldn't you guess
what was on his mind?

1037
02:11:39,936 --> 02:11:43,531
If one knew what's on everyone's mind,
there wouldn't be any problem at all

1038
02:11:44,040 --> 02:11:46,270
We have these problems
because we don't know

1039
02:11:46,542 --> 02:11:49,534
What do you mean by these problems?
- These problems. Period

1040
02:11:53,549 --> 02:11:55,881
All right. I must leave now

1041
02:12:10,700 --> 02:12:12,565
Did you call?

1042
02:12:13,836 --> 02:12:14,996
Yes

1043
02:12:15,238 --> 02:12:16,569
What for?

1044
02:12:18,941 --> 02:12:21,910
To talk.
- That's what we've been doing

1045
02:12:23,646 --> 02:12:26,114
No, there's something else
I want to talk about

1046
02:12:31,988 --> 02:12:34,252
What is it about?

1047
02:12:36,759 --> 02:12:41,594
She knows... why must she
ask what it's about

1048
02:12:42,732 --> 02:12:44,393
The arrogant one!

1049
02:12:49,005 --> 02:12:51,940
It's about what you think

1050
02:12:54,677 --> 02:12:58,078
I'm thinking about nothing.
You wanted to talk to me

1051
02:12:58,347 --> 02:13:00,338
So tell me what you want to

1052
02:13:19,936 --> 02:13:22,632
Is that what you called me to say?
- Yes

1053
02:14:36,712 --> 02:14:39,237
Your intoxicating eyes...

1054
02:14:42,151 --> 02:14:44,381
your lips...

1055
02:14:50,159 --> 02:14:53,151
there's a huge list
I have of you

1056
02:15:01,103 --> 02:15:04,937
Roma, can you fall in love with me?

1057
02:15:07,743 --> 02:15:09,734
Can you really like me?

1058
02:15:11,013 --> 02:15:12,742
However...

1059
02:15:14,750 --> 02:15:20,313
the possibility of me
falling in love with you...

1060
02:15:24,427 --> 02:15:27,760
does exist.
- Thanks

1061
02:15:36,772 --> 02:15:41,436
I don't you well, you see.
Let's see each other for a few days...

1062
02:15:41,777 --> 02:15:44,769
and then I'll decide about it.
It'll take a bit of time, okay?

1063
02:15:46,115 --> 02:15:50,779
What's a bit... take all the time.
All my time is now yours

1064
02:15:56,592 --> 02:16:00,119
I feel as if something is
stirred in my heart for you

1065
02:16:01,797 --> 02:16:03,594
Your lovely tresses...

1066
02:16:05,101 --> 02:16:07,092
your rose-like lips...

1067
02:16:14,210 --> 02:16:16,201
and this lovely neck and...

1068
02:16:26,822 --> 02:16:31,987
I'm not calling you because
you have a girl in your arms

1069
02:16:33,829 --> 02:16:38,391
Neither have I called you because
you're drawing pictures on her body

1070
02:16:39,502 --> 02:16:41,834
I haven't called out
to disturb you

1071
02:16:43,839 --> 02:16:47,832
We've got to be at Priya's place
at 7:30. You remember that?

1072
02:16:48,844 --> 02:16:56,512
Karan, who's she? A friend?
- A friend? Oh no, no chance at all

1073
02:16:57,653 --> 02:17:01,180
Is she a lover then?
- Lover? How disgusting!

1074
02:17:02,658 --> 02:17:06,856
To be my lover,
a girl needs extra qualities

1075
02:17:08,697 --> 02:17:10,597
So who's she?

1076
02:17:14,670 --> 02:17:19,869
She's Khushi. There's nothing else
I know about her

1077
02:17:20,876 --> 02:17:25,472
Karan, just 15 minutes to go
for 7:30. May we leave now?

1078
02:17:32,288 --> 02:17:34,620
When will you meet me again?
- Again?

1079
02:17:39,228 --> 02:17:43,562
At lunch?
- Not lunch. At dinner

1080
02:17:44,900 --> 02:17:51,237
At night. Candle-light.
Sunday 10, at my place

1081
02:18:05,020 --> 02:18:06,351
Shall we?

1082
02:18:18,434 --> 02:18:21,301
Today's Sunday.
So?

1083
02:18:54,970 --> 02:18:57,302
It was you who said it...

1084
02:18:57,973 --> 02:19:00,237
Yes, I did, but...

1085
02:20:13,048 --> 02:20:15,642
Whoever you are with,
why must I care?

1086
02:20:31,066 --> 02:20:33,057
Sorry, I'm late

1087
02:20:43,078 --> 02:20:47,845
What happened?
- Last night... nothing

1088
02:20:52,087 --> 02:20:55,887
What did Priya have to say?
- She says forget it

1089
02:20:56,925 --> 02:20:58,893
Forget what?
- Love

1090
02:20:59,161 --> 02:21:02,688
Whose love?
- The love Vicky had for Priya

1091
02:21:03,165 --> 02:21:05,099
Priya asks to forget it

1092
02:21:09,104 --> 02:21:10,901
And what did you tell her?

1093
02:21:11,106 --> 02:21:13,700
When she herself isn't interested,
what can I do?

1094
02:21:14,143 --> 02:21:18,477
What is it with girls? Flirt when you
want to, dump the guy when you wish

1095
02:21:19,348 --> 02:21:23,648
Have you girls ever considered
what it does to us guys?

1096
02:21:24,119 --> 02:21:25,916
You're acting like
a very decent guy?

1097
02:21:26,121 --> 02:21:28,521
Do you think I don't know
the truth about you?

1098
02:21:28,924 --> 02:21:31,916
Were you breathing heavily
last night, or weren't you?

1099
02:21:32,628 --> 02:21:33,390
What?

1100
02:21:34,163 --> 02:21:36,393
Were you breathing last night,
or weren't you?

1101
02:21:36,565 --> 02:21:41,468
Breathing? I was breathing last night
and the night before that too

1102
02:21:41,870 --> 02:21:45,738
And I breathe every day...
and well at that

1103
02:21:46,141 --> 02:21:48,803
It's good for the health.
Is it bad to breathe?

1104
02:21:49,144 --> 02:21:52,136
Maybe it's bad to look at this...
but why's it bad to breathe?

1105
02:21:52,681 --> 02:21:54,876
How will man live
if he doesn't breathe?

1106
02:21:55,150 --> 02:21:58,142
Am I the only one who breathes?
Everyone does. Every single day

1107
02:21:58,554 --> 02:22:01,546
Your parents do, so do mine.
Because they breathe...

1108
02:22:01,824 --> 02:22:05,487
you are here, I am here...
so's the dog

1109
02:22:06,161 --> 02:22:09,892
He breathes every day.
Nicely at that. Right puppy?

1110
02:22:11,166 --> 02:22:13,691
See? If you call that bad,
what can I do?

1111
02:22:14,636 --> 02:22:17,161
The breathing I spoke about is
different from the one you allude to

1112
02:22:17,573 --> 02:22:20,974
It's all the same. If breathing
is wrong, everything is wrong

1113
02:22:21,510 --> 02:22:23,102
I'll leave if you talk like this

1114
02:22:28,183 --> 02:22:30,981
I know the suffering of one
truly in love

1115
02:22:31,353 --> 02:22:34,845
Priya's words, weren't they?
So how can she ask us to forget it?

1116
02:22:35,190 --> 02:22:37,852
What does it mean?
We have to talk

1117
02:22:48,570 --> 02:22:52,734
Today's the last day at college.
It's time to separate

1118
02:22:53,208 --> 02:22:55,540
So come forth and take my blessings

1119
02:23:12,227 --> 02:23:13,888
You been in a crowded train?

1120
02:23:18,800 --> 02:23:21,826
So many of them have
gone into coma for you

1121
02:23:22,237 --> 02:23:27,038
I'm in a coma too. Embrace me
and revive me from the coma, Roma

1122
02:23:33,582 --> 02:23:36,050
Priya's wedding has been fixed

1123
02:23:47,262 --> 02:23:49,253
What are we to do?

1124
02:23:55,737 --> 02:23:56,726
Greetings

1125
02:23:59,608 --> 02:24:01,599
Mr Zorawar Singh... over here

1126
02:24:07,783 --> 02:24:10,274
Where are you going?
To fetch your daughter?

1127
02:24:11,286 --> 02:24:17,555
She's with us right now.
She's marrying the man she loves

1128
02:24:47,990 --> 02:24:50,982
From the look of it, it appears
as if you want to give me a thrashing

1129
02:24:53,629 --> 02:24:57,121
Don't even think of it.
Pray to God...

1130
02:24:57,933 --> 02:25:00,925
that I come to no harm.
If something happens to me...

1131
02:25:01,503 --> 02:25:04,734
you'll be the guilty one
in the eyes of the law

1132
02:25:05,474 --> 02:25:07,942
I've made arrangements, you know

1133
02:25:10,412 --> 02:25:13,347
You're picking up something
to throw at me

1134
02:25:18,820 --> 02:25:22,017
Forget me...
you can't even touch my image

1135
02:25:28,697 --> 02:25:31,757
Spend a month in Mahabaleshwar
before you return to Calcutta

1136
02:25:32,534 --> 02:25:36,026
Dad has found a job for you
over there. Okay?

1137
02:25:37,372 --> 02:25:39,772
Spend your lives together.
Be happy

1138
02:26:02,597 --> 02:26:07,796
There are problems between
you and Khushi, isn't it?

1139
02:26:10,906 --> 02:26:18,813
You know why man faces problems?
Because he hides his feelings

1140
02:26:20,215 --> 02:26:23,207
If you speak your heart,
you face no problems

1141
02:26:23,418 --> 02:26:25,409
But I don't know why man
doesn't understand that

1142
02:26:26,054 --> 02:26:28,818
He loves someone,
but he pretends to hate her

1143
02:26:29,091 --> 02:26:31,821
He hates someone and he pretends
to love her. What for?

1144
02:26:33,095 --> 02:26:38,829
Poor heart. Why do we burden
it with a thousand worries...

1145
02:26:39,434 --> 02:26:44,770
and make life unbearable for it?
If you love her...

1146
02:26:44,940 --> 02:26:47,773
tell her that you love her,
or tell her that you don't

1147
02:26:50,445 --> 02:26:53,437
God has given you eyes to see,
ears to hear...

1148
02:26:54,783 --> 02:26:58,116
and a heart to love

1149
02:27:00,122 --> 02:27:03,853
So forget about egoes
and fall in love

1150
02:27:04,459 --> 02:27:05,858
Love each other

1151
02:27:07,529 --> 02:27:11,124
I've told you how I feel

1152
02:27:36,124 --> 02:27:39,753
You've been a great help in uniting
my friend with his beloved

1153
02:27:48,003 --> 02:27:54,169
Thanks to you too. In uniting
my friend with her beloved...

1154
02:27:57,512 --> 02:28:01,915
you've been a great help.
Thank you

1155
02:30:53,688 --> 02:30:55,087
This is Seema here

1156
02:30:58,493 --> 02:31:00,688
I'm leaving today
- Okay

1157
02:31:01,196 --> 02:31:05,690
I'm leaving and you're just...
- I have another tension, Seema

1158
02:31:28,723 --> 02:31:31,055
Sir, the taxi has arrived

1159
02:31:52,747 --> 02:31:56,148
Karan?
- He has left for VT Station

1160
02:31:56,251 --> 02:31:58,549
Which train is it?
- Howrah Mail at 7:15

1161
02:32:05,160 --> 02:32:06,855
Is Khushi there?
- She has left

1162
02:32:06,928 --> 02:32:08,759
Where to?
- Bombay Central

1163
02:32:09,764 --> 02:32:12,756
Which train?
- Golden Temple Express at 7:10

1164
02:32:45,300 --> 02:32:47,598
Karan?
- No one has arrived yet

1165
02:33:33,848 --> 02:33:36,248
Was there a girl called Khushi here?
- There's no one

1166
02:34:10,518 --> 02:34:12,884
Maybe he has gone to
Mumbai Central to meet me

1167
02:34:13,888 --> 02:34:16,516
Maybe she has gone to
VT Station to meet me

1168
02:34:16,658 --> 02:34:17,886
And what if he hasn't?

1169
02:34:18,293 --> 02:34:19,282
Now?

1170
02:34:30,238 --> 02:34:35,301
A girl called Khushi will come here.
Please give her this letter

1171
02:34:37,912 --> 02:34:41,575
A boy called Karan will come here.
Please give him this

1172
02:36:26,654 --> 02:36:28,417
Karan?
- Yes?

1173
02:36:32,360 --> 02:36:36,421
I've been wanting to tell you
something for a very long time

1174
02:36:37,198 --> 02:36:40,429
You know?
I love you, Khushi

1175
02:36:43,137 --> 02:36:46,038
When we were together,
this is what I wanted to say...

1176
02:36:46,274 --> 02:36:49,835
but I never could,
I don't know why

1177
02:36:50,211 --> 02:36:53,703
And now that I want to speak,
you are not with me

1178
02:36:53,915 --> 02:36:56,850
We said so much to each other
when we fought...

1179
02:36:57,051 --> 02:37:02,455
but we couldn't say one single word
to get together. I'm sorry, Khushi

1180
02:37:04,859 --> 02:37:08,454
When I freed my hand from yours
after thanking you...

1181
02:37:08,563 --> 02:37:11,054
I felt something strange
stir in my heart

1182
02:37:11,299 --> 02:37:14,393
I don't know what it was.
But I need you, Karan

1183
02:37:16,237 --> 02:37:22,233
I now realise that the fights
we had was all part of our love

1184
02:37:24,078 --> 02:37:30,483
I need you, Khushi.
To love me, to fight with me

1185
02:37:38,693 --> 02:37:41,719
You're a lucky girl to have
found a father like yours

1186
02:37:41,896 --> 02:37:43,830
Ever since you agreed
to the wedding...

1187
02:37:43,898 --> 02:37:46,093
all he has done is to
look out for suitors

1188
02:37:46,200 --> 02:37:50,500
He decided to have Lali married
the day she returned from the city

1189
02:37:50,605 --> 02:37:53,438
Everything is ready.
The bridegroom, the garland...

1190
02:37:53,608 --> 02:37:56,509
step forward and be garlanded

1191
02:38:08,122 --> 02:38:10,113
Lali! My child!

1192
02:38:11,125 --> 02:38:13,525
You're back! Welcome!

1193
02:38:13,728 --> 02:38:16,288
Go and get ready quickly.
- But Papa...

1194
02:38:16,531 --> 02:38:20,524
Just don't worry, my little girl.
The boy I've chosen this time...

1195
02:38:21,135 --> 02:38:24,127
is neither running away
nor leaving behind letters...

1196
02:38:24,372 --> 02:38:27,136
and he's not in love with
another girl either

1197
02:38:28,276 --> 02:38:31,143
Why're you chanting Papa?
Go and get dressed quickly

1198
02:38:31,479 --> 02:38:33,140
Coming!

1199
02:38:45,827 --> 02:38:48,159
Lali, take a look
at your bridegroom

1200
02:38:49,797 --> 02:38:51,162
Take a look at him

1201
02:39:10,184 --> 02:39:12,584
You left this note for him
in the train...

1202
02:39:13,187 --> 02:39:15,178
and he turned out to be
faster than you

1203
02:39:15,490 --> 02:39:20,189
He halted the train and
took a flight to get here

1204
02:39:20,461 --> 02:39:22,190
He has told me everything

1205
02:39:22,363 --> 02:39:26,197
Karan's parents will also be
coming here for the wedding

1206
02:39:26,334 --> 02:39:27,858
Are you happy now

1207
02:40:40,775 --> 02:40:46,680
This is how two hearts met
and accepted each other

1208
02:40:47,782 --> 02:40:51,684
They're celebrating their
ninth anniversary

1209
02:40:52,286 --> 02:40:55,687
and they're still fighting
What is surprising is that

1210
02:40:55,790 --> 02:41:00,693
they haven't one or two kids
they have 17 children in 8 years

1211
02:41:01,596 --> 02:41:05,293
Twins every year But how
does it still add up to 17

1212
02:41:05,800 --> 02:41:09,292
Confusing, isn't it
They didn't fight for a year

1213
02:41:09,437 --> 02:41:11,302
and they had triplets

1214
02:41:13,541 --> 02:41:19,104
Khushi's expecting again.
Twins or triplets I don't know

1215
02:41:19,547 --> 02:41:22,710
I'm just looking on
and praying for them

1216
02:41:24,819 --> 02:41:28,721
May Karan keep giving Khushi
