1
00:00:09,892 --> 00:00:13,305
Barry, please!

2
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:16,107
That's not me!

3
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:23,648
This can't be happening.

4
00:00:23,717 --> 00:00:25,584
Are you real?

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,086
No, of course you're not.

6
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:29,854
That's it. That's it.

7
00:00:29,923 --> 00:00:32,190
I've finally lost it.

8
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:34,826
It's okay. I-I'm real.

9
00:00:42,236 --> 00:00:43,435
Oh, my...

10
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:47,138
I...

11
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:50,274
Oh, I-I...

12
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:52,778
I can't believe I'm talking
to another person.

13
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:55,146
It's been so long.

14
00:00:55,215 --> 00:00:56,447
Wait, I know you...

15
00:00:56,516 --> 00:00:57,882
you and your husband, Joseph Carver,

16
00:00:57,951 --> 00:00:59,584
you founded McCulloch Technologies.

17
00:00:59,653 --> 00:01:02,020
You're Eva McCulloch.

18
00:01:02,088 --> 00:01:04,689
But you're supposed to be dead.

19
00:01:04,758 --> 00:01:06,558
No.

20
00:01:06,627 --> 00:01:08,292
Not dead.

21
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:10,028
Just trapped.

22
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:14,666
Now so are you.

23
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:33,980
www.TUSUBTITULO.com
-DIFUNDE LA CULTURA-

24
00:01:34,221 --> 00:01:37,589
You see, until now, this
place was a whole world

25
00:01:37,658 --> 00:01:41,059
with one inhabitant...

26
00:01:41,127 --> 00:01:43,194
- Me.
- This must be another Earth.

27
00:01:43,263 --> 00:01:45,864
Same Earth. Another dimension.

28
00:01:45,932 --> 00:01:48,333
You see, a mirror-version of Central City.

29
00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:52,537
Same city, same buildings, just empty.

30
00:01:54,642 --> 00:01:57,942
- _
- Who are you anyway?

31
00:01:58,011 --> 00:01:59,277
I'm Iris West-Allen.

32
00:01:59,345 --> 00:02:01,480
I'm a reporter for "The CC Citizen."

33
00:02:01,548 --> 00:02:03,148
Never heard of it.

34
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:04,749
Not that it matters.

35
00:02:04,818 --> 00:02:06,652
God, it feels so good
to have a conversation

36
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,853
that's not one-sided.

37
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:11,956
Everything is backwards.

38
00:02:12,025 --> 00:02:13,291
Eva, you said that this place

39
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,727
was a mirror-version of our own.

40
00:02:15,796 --> 00:02:17,896
How is that possible?

41
00:02:17,964 --> 00:02:20,665
Think of it like this:

42
00:02:20,734 --> 00:02:23,001
our reality is observed
by three dimensions:

43
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,803
width, depth, and length.

44
00:02:24,872 --> 00:02:26,437
The superstring theory posits

45
00:02:26,506 --> 00:02:28,773
that there are other realities,

46
00:02:28,842 --> 00:02:32,477
fractal dimensions humans can't see.

47
00:02:32,545 --> 00:02:34,579
So...

48
00:02:34,648 --> 00:02:36,715
Two sides.

49
00:02:36,784 --> 00:02:39,150
One, our world.

50
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:42,287
The other is just some empty reflection.

51
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,457
I'm a quantum engineer.

52
00:02:45,526 --> 00:02:48,660
It's... it's my wheelhouse.

53
00:02:54,635 --> 00:02:57,669
Yeah, that is a side-effect
of this dimension.

54
00:02:57,738 --> 00:03:01,740
I... I barely notice them anymore.

55
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:04,843
How did you end up here, Eva?

56
00:03:04,912 --> 00:03:06,378
Six years ago,

57
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:09,681
I was developing the technology

58
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,250
to open doors to other planes of existence.

59
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,052
I was in my office

60
00:03:14,121 --> 00:03:17,822
the night Harrison Wells'
dream went up in smoke.

61
00:03:28,602 --> 00:03:30,535
I've been here ever since.

62
00:03:30,604 --> 00:03:32,804
Dark matter must have
washed over that mirror

63
00:03:32,873 --> 00:03:34,773
and created a doorway.

64
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:37,709
I was in this office when
I got pulled in too.

65
00:03:37,778 --> 00:03:39,845
But that's not all.

66
00:03:39,913 --> 00:03:41,679
There is someone else on the
other side of that mirror,

67
00:03:41,748 --> 00:03:42,714
another me.

68
00:03:42,783 --> 00:03:44,783
How is that possible, Eva?

69
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:48,186
A fractal variable caused by the mirror.

70
00:03:48,255 --> 00:03:50,321
A duplicate of you.

71
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,990
You mean the mirror
left a fake clone of me

72
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:53,792
in the real world?

73
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,993
We're getting out of here.

74
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:56,895
I've tried. For six years,

75
00:03:56,963 --> 00:03:59,497
I've been in my own personal hell.

76
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:01,700
Eva, I have to go home.

77
00:04:01,768 --> 00:04:04,469
I'm sorry you're stuck here, but...

78
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,341
I thought I was gonna die here alone.

79
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,944
At least now there's two of us.

80
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:16,648
Investigation into the disappearance

81
00:04:16,717 --> 00:04:18,650
of socialite Sue Dearbon.

82
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:22,754
Day 274

83
00:04:22,823 --> 00:04:26,224
since her parents first
hired me to find her.

84
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:30,762
Status update.

85
00:04:30,831 --> 00:04:32,097
Nothing.

86
00:04:32,165 --> 00:04:33,865
Sue's trail went cold in Midway City

87
00:04:33,934 --> 00:04:36,835
after Remington Meister
provided a dead end.

88
00:04:36,904 --> 00:04:39,471
- However, she was there.
- _

89
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,606
Meister confirmed that much.

90
00:04:41,674 --> 00:04:45,410
Hey, what are you still
doing here... oh, seriously?

91
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,045
Ralph. When I left last night,

92
00:04:47,114 --> 00:04:49,414
you were standing here staring
at the exact same board,

93
00:04:49,482 --> 00:04:50,982
same as the night before.

94
00:04:51,051 --> 00:04:52,183
Honey, don't you think maybe

95
00:04:52,252 --> 00:04:53,718
it's time you got a little help?

96
00:04:53,786 --> 00:04:56,454
- And a shower?
- Cecile, this is my process.

97
00:04:56,522 --> 00:04:58,489
I work things out with the only person

98
00:04:58,558 --> 00:05:00,992
that can keep up with my
beautiful detective mind.

99
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:02,593
- Me.
- You could work with me.

100
00:05:02,662 --> 00:05:04,829
We took down the FEMA guy
together, that was so great.

101
00:05:04,898 --> 00:05:06,731
You're not loving that, all right.

102
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:08,099
Cecile, you know me.

103
00:05:08,168 --> 00:05:10,468
I-I like doing things my own way.

104
00:05:10,537 --> 00:05:12,070
Ralph...

105
00:05:12,138 --> 00:05:14,105
every Holmes needs a Watson.

106
00:05:15,408 --> 00:05:17,508
Hang on.

107
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:20,879
What is it?

108
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:22,781
So a couple months ago,
I put up these alerts

109
00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:25,550
on Sue's bank accounts,
trusts, and credit cards.

110
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:29,120
Apparently, she just made
a small deposit on...

111
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:31,990
an apartment in Central City.

112
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:33,424
See? Told you.

113
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:36,060
- Only partner I need is...
- This guy.

114
00:05:37,022 --> 00:05:38,629
See you.

115
00:05:41,234 --> 00:05:43,868
Oh, wow, something
definitely just died in here.

116
00:05:51,363 --> 00:05:52,444
LEX LUTHOR WINS
MAN OF TOMORROW AWARD

117
00:05:52,445 --> 00:05:54,078
Kara and Lex Luthor?

118
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:55,480
Man, this post-Crisis world

119
00:05:55,548 --> 00:05:56,881
gets harder to understand every day.

120
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,616
Right?

121
00:05:58,685 --> 00:06:00,385
- Man.
- What's wrong?

122
00:06:00,453 --> 00:06:02,053
I'm still sore

123
00:06:02,122 --> 00:06:05,156
from our little double date
with Amunet and Goldface.

124
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:06,391
So, so weird.

125
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:07,859
Maybe you should stay home today.

126
00:06:07,928 --> 00:06:09,828
No, no.

127
00:06:09,897 --> 00:06:12,163
Are you working on more Black Hole stuff?

128
00:06:12,232 --> 00:06:13,865
Yeah, I think I am getting

129
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:17,068
really close to taking
this son of a bitch down.

130
00:06:17,137 --> 00:06:19,170
Yeah.

131
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:20,604
That's the mirror gun?

132
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:22,240
Yeah, it contains bleeding-edge

133
00:06:22,308 --> 00:06:23,741
reflective micro-chip technology.

134
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,376
If I can examine the gun up close,

135
00:06:25,445 --> 00:06:27,378
then maybe I can find
some kind of small clue

136
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:29,680
that connects the gun to Black Hole

137
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:32,450
since McCulloch created it.

138
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,986
It's still in the Starchives, right?

139
00:06:35,055 --> 00:06:36,888
Yeah, yeah, it is.

140
00:06:36,957 --> 00:06:40,525
Could you... get it for me?

141
00:06:42,963 --> 00:06:44,462
I-I mean, unlocking a weapon like that

142
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,230
sounds like a bad idea.

143
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:48,433
Barry, it's me.

144
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:50,868
I-I know, but I mean,
after what just happened

145
00:06:50,937 --> 00:06:52,670
with you and Carver... w-what if the gun

146
00:06:52,739 --> 00:06:54,138
fell into the wrong hands?

147
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,273
Just like the cold gun fell into Snart's.

148
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:57,175
It won't, trust me.

149
00:06:57,243 --> 00:06:59,443
Iris, I... look, you I trust,

150
00:06:59,512 --> 00:07:01,146
but... the guy who just tried to

151
00:07:01,214 --> 00:07:03,114
to have you assassinated,

152
00:07:03,183 --> 00:07:04,448
not so much.

153
00:07:04,517 --> 00:07:06,952
I mean, and if Black Hole had a weapon

154
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,452
as powerful as the mirror gun,

155
00:07:08,521 --> 00:07:10,822
I mean, there's no telling
what could happen.

156
00:07:10,891 --> 00:07:12,991
Yeah, you're right. I will...

157
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,259
I'll try a different angle.

158
00:07:16,563 --> 00:07:18,129
I'm just being cautious.

159
00:07:18,198 --> 00:07:20,664
Yeah, I know, I get it.

160
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:22,466
Have fun.

161
00:07:22,535 --> 00:07:24,736
Okay.

162
00:07:39,386 --> 00:07:41,719
Not exactly the Ritz.

163
00:07:47,794 --> 00:07:49,160
Get down!

164
00:07:55,869 --> 00:07:57,402
What the hell, lady?

165
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,237
Hey, I just saved your life.

166
00:07:59,306 --> 00:08:01,039
You're welcome, by the way.

167
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,711
Oh, my God.

168
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,913
It's you.

169
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:11,015
You're Sue Dearbon.

170
00:08:11,084 --> 00:08:13,484
In the flesh.

171
00:08:13,553 --> 00:08:16,587
And you are?

172
00:08:19,347 --> 00:08:21,525
No one followed us. We're clear.

173
00:08:21,526 --> 00:08:24,127
Sue, I... I have been looking for you

174
00:08:24,196 --> 00:08:26,096
- for nine months.
- Ouch.

175
00:08:26,165 --> 00:08:27,897
I hope you don't bill by the hour.

176
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,432
Where have you been?

177
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:31,368
A-and why did your apartment
explode in my face?

178
00:08:31,437 --> 00:08:32,802
Yeah, hate it when that happens.

179
00:08:32,872 --> 00:08:34,604
Look, I'm serious. Now who set that bomb?

180
00:08:34,674 --> 00:08:36,039
Why are they trying to kill you?

181
00:08:36,108 --> 00:08:38,142
And how long has this been going on for?

182
00:08:38,468 --> 00:08:40,744
My ex. Because I know too much.

183
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:43,046
About nine months. You done?

184
00:08:43,115 --> 00:08:44,648
No, I'm most certainly not done.

185
00:08:44,716 --> 00:08:47,885
Why is your ex sending you
explosive candy grams?

186
00:08:49,081 --> 00:08:51,088
The cheap stuff.

187
00:08:53,859 --> 00:08:56,426
Look. Drinks later.

188
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:58,862
Spilling your guts to tell a tragic story?

189
00:08:58,931 --> 00:09:00,730
- That'd be now.
- Fine.

190
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,166
I fell in love with a murderer.

191
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:05,468
Happy?

192
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,474
John Loring.

193
00:09:11,543 --> 00:09:15,145
Turns out Mr. Dreamy Muscles
and charisma-for-miles

194
00:09:15,214 --> 00:09:17,814
was also a major arms
dealer on the black market.

195
00:09:17,883 --> 00:09:19,583
So why does Loring want you dead?

196
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:22,886
Because I stumbled
across his client lists,

197
00:09:22,955 --> 00:09:24,621
weapons inventory, and everything else

198
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,157
that exposes him for the
bag of crap that he is.

199
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:29,459
The first time he tried to kill me,

200
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,361
I was asleep.

201
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,963
All right, well...

202
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,233
- Who are you calling, Slick?
- Your parents.

203
00:09:36,302 --> 00:09:39,069
To let 'em know you're safe.

204
00:09:40,572 --> 00:09:43,841
What... come on, I just switched plans.

205
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:45,608
John can track your phone.

206
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:47,811
You call my parents, they're dead.

207
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,646
All right, then...
we'll go to the police.

208
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,381
I know a Precinct Captain who can help us.

209
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,418
The last time I tried that,
they tried to kill me too.

210
00:09:54,486 --> 00:09:55,853
John's got cops on the payroll

211
00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:58,054
in every city he does business.

212
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:02,859
Then what's your plan to get out of this?

213
00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:06,963
Sue, you can't run forever.

214
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:08,332
Who says I'm running?

215
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,436
You and Loring are hunting each other.

216
00:10:12,504 --> 00:10:14,004
That's why you're in Central City.

217
00:10:14,073 --> 00:10:16,206
John's in town for a massive sale.

218
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:19,442
If I can get damning
evidence on what he's doing,

219
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:21,211
he goes to jail.

220
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,412
And I go home.

221
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:25,348
I smell a mystery.

222
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,417
I smell...

223
00:10:27,486 --> 00:10:28,786
Expired milk.

224
00:10:28,854 --> 00:10:30,287
Look, everything is gonna be fine.

225
00:10:30,356 --> 00:10:32,055
Your parents hired me
to do whatever it takes

226
00:10:32,124 --> 00:10:33,190
to bring you home safely.

227
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,458
And that's what I'm gonna do.

228
00:10:35,527 --> 00:10:37,561
- How?
- Easy.

229
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:39,963
I'm gonna find Loring, I'm
gonna get your evidence,

230
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:41,398
then I'm gonna take it to CCPD.

231
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:43,733
And after I do that, I'm
gonna take you home.

232
00:10:43,803 --> 00:10:47,771
John's a killer. You'd
be risking your life.

233
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,706
For me.

234
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:54,644
If you get killed...

235
00:10:54,713 --> 00:10:57,381
my parents are out good money.

236
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,349
I'm coming with you.

237
00:11:02,021 --> 00:11:05,488
1,322. 1,322.

238
00:11:05,557 --> 00:11:10,694
1,322. 1,322. Okay.

239
00:11:10,762 --> 00:11:13,096
Eva, there has got to
be a way out of here

240
00:11:13,164 --> 00:11:14,298
that we haven't thought of yet.

241
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:16,065
There isn't.

242
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,735
There's only two options in this place:

243
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,471
survival or madness.

244
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,806
1,322...

245
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:25,609
Eva, my husband will be
looking for me, please.

246
00:11:25,677 --> 00:11:29,246
This is how it all starts!
Don't you understand?

247
00:11:29,315 --> 00:11:31,781
You sit here and you think
everything's gonna work out.

248
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:34,150
You can't possibly stay here forever,

249
00:11:34,219 --> 00:11:39,122
and then 1,322.

250
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:41,258
That's how many times I've
tried to escape this place.

251
00:11:41,327 --> 00:11:44,428
That's how many times I've failed.

252
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:47,297
1,322 reminders

253
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:50,300
that I'm never leaving this place.

254
00:11:52,404 --> 00:11:55,939
So please don't...

255
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:58,141
give me another one.

256
00:12:06,051 --> 00:12:09,152
I'm having a really bad hair day.

257
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,891
I'm sorry. I...

258
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,395
I've been alone for a very long time.

259
00:12:18,464 --> 00:12:20,830
Well, you're not anymore.

260
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:23,400
We just need one way out of here, Eva.

261
00:12:23,469 --> 00:12:25,034
That's it.

262
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:32,009
Sam Scudder.

263
00:12:32,077 --> 00:12:33,510
Who?

264
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:36,446
He was one of the bad guys. He trapped...

265
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:39,015
someone in a mirror a few years ago.

266
00:12:39,084 --> 00:12:41,918
And my friends got him out by
bringing it to absolute zero.

267
00:12:41,987 --> 00:12:43,353
We...

268
00:12:43,422 --> 00:12:45,755
Eva, we just need to find
some liquid nitrogen.

269
00:12:45,824 --> 00:12:47,357
Well, I-I have a lab down the hall.

270
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:49,025
There should be some in there.

271
00:12:49,094 --> 00:12:51,561
The nitrogen should slow
down the mirror's molecules

272
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,264
to the lowest enthalpy state possible.

273
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,333
Oh, my God.

274
00:12:56,402 --> 00:12:58,368
This could work.

275
00:13:04,843 --> 00:13:06,710
Hey, Barr. Morning.

276
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:08,245
- Hey.
- You got a sec?

277
00:13:08,314 --> 00:13:09,546
Yeah, what's up, Captain?

278
00:13:09,615 --> 00:13:10,948
- Eh.
- Yeah, that never gets old.

279
00:13:11,016 --> 00:13:12,915
Yeah, it kinda does. Listen.

280
00:13:12,984 --> 00:13:16,453
There was a house fire on
Batton Street last month.

281
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:17,921
- Okay.
- The occupant died

282
00:13:17,989 --> 00:13:19,456
of smoke inhalation.

283
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:22,091
I'm wondering if you could
take a second look.

284
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,261
Joe, this case was already
declared an accident.

285
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:26,296
Yeah.

286
00:13:26,365 --> 00:13:29,799
I need... fresh pair of eyes on it.

287
00:13:29,868 --> 00:13:31,935
Okay, I mean, what am I looking for?

288
00:13:32,004 --> 00:13:34,571
Whatever you find.

289
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,439
Joe, I mean, I've got a mountain of cases

290
00:13:36,508 --> 00:13:37,741
I need to go through.

291
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:39,509
Ones that haven't been solved already.

292
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:42,445
Okay, all I can say

293
00:13:42,514 --> 00:13:44,814
is that you'd be doing me a favor.

294
00:13:44,883 --> 00:13:46,649
And whatever you find, Barr,

295
00:13:46,718 --> 00:13:49,386
bring it directly to me.

296
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,488
Okay.

297
00:13:51,557 --> 00:13:53,390
Thank you.

298
00:13:58,897 --> 00:14:00,163
John owns that warehouse.

299
00:14:00,232 --> 00:14:02,699
That's where the deal will go down.

300
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:04,701
Where are you going?

301
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,869
- I'm going with you.
- No, no, no, no, no.

302
00:14:06,938 --> 00:14:08,472
Oh, look, I get it.

303
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,939
Chivalry's your brand.

304
00:14:10,008 --> 00:14:11,508
You're an MIT grad, speak six languages,

305
00:14:11,577 --> 00:14:13,009
and you play polo.

306
00:14:13,077 --> 00:14:14,711
You belong in a country
club, not in the field.

307
00:14:14,849 --> 00:14:17,947
You belong in the 19th
Century with your Victorian,

308
00:14:18,016 --> 00:14:19,783
save-the-damsel-in-distress crap.

309
00:14:19,851 --> 00:14:21,918
Loring doesn't know that I'm coming,

310
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,287
so I have the element of surprise.

311
00:14:24,356 --> 00:14:25,688
You, on the other hand,

312
00:14:25,757 --> 00:14:27,056
he might kinda know that you're coming.

313
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,692
Translation: stay in the car, please.

314
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:55,017
I hope Loring looks good in orange.

315
00:14:57,606 --> 00:15:00,990
I don't suppose you're
a fellow bird watcher?

316
00:15:16,675 --> 00:15:17,840
Hey, Vin Diesel!

317
00:15:22,665 --> 00:15:25,314
You still want me to wait in the car?

318
00:15:34,454 --> 00:15:37,589
So you mind telling me
how you know martial arts?

319
00:15:37,657 --> 00:15:39,524
My parents sent me to Kyoto for a summer.

320
00:15:39,593 --> 00:15:41,393
Trained with a blind sensei.

321
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:43,661
- Taught me everything I know.
- Really?

322
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,064
No.

323
00:15:45,132 --> 00:15:47,967
I trained with a guy named Frank at a YMCA.

324
00:15:48,035 --> 00:15:49,467
Will you relax?

325
00:15:49,536 --> 00:15:51,703
We're safe here. John's not stupid.

326
00:15:51,772 --> 00:15:53,241
Killing me in a public place?

327
00:15:54,092 --> 00:15:54,439
It's not gonna happen.

328
00:15:54,508 --> 00:15:57,176
I'm sorry, I believe
he blew up an apartment

329
00:15:57,244 --> 00:15:58,243
to get to you.

330
00:15:58,312 --> 00:15:59,311
That building was scheduled

331
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,745
for demolition next month.

332
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:03,515
But he does know that
someone's after him now.

333
00:16:03,584 --> 00:16:05,117
It'll make him harder to get to.

334
00:16:05,185 --> 00:16:06,351
Thanks to you.

335
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:09,955
Where are you going?

336
00:16:10,024 --> 00:16:11,056
Sorry, Slick.

337
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,424
I can't partner up with someone

338
00:16:12,492 --> 00:16:13,625
who doesn't think I can pull my own weight.

339
00:16:13,693 --> 00:16:15,460
Hang on a second, Sue. Hang on.

340
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:17,997
Will you just hang on one second, please?

341
00:16:18,065 --> 00:16:19,798
Look, when I take a case,

342
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:22,067
I see it through to the end.

343
00:16:22,136 --> 00:16:24,502
And this doesn't end until you're safe.

344
00:16:24,571 --> 00:16:26,438
Do you trust me, Ralph?

345
00:16:28,175 --> 00:16:30,175
I just met you.

346
00:16:30,244 --> 00:16:31,943
But you did save my keister.

347
00:16:32,012 --> 00:16:35,347
Twice. And that means I owe you.

348
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,581
And I always pay my debts.

349
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,084
I'll take that as a yes.

350
00:16:39,153 --> 00:16:40,552
So...

351
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,121
- without those pictures...
- We are back to square one.

352
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,090
Fortunately, we still have John's ledger.

353
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:46,891
He keeps a detailed record of every deal

354
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,893
he's ever made in it.

355
00:16:47,962 --> 00:16:49,328
Years of evidence against him.

356
00:16:49,396 --> 00:16:50,462
But his office is still
on the seventh floor

357
00:16:50,531 --> 00:16:51,997
of that warehouse.

358
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:53,632
Which has probably doubled
its security by now.

359
00:16:53,701 --> 00:16:55,167
But the sewer system,
that's a good way in.

360
00:16:55,236 --> 00:16:56,769
Those tunnels, they lead
directly to the center

361
00:16:56,837 --> 00:16:58,303
- of the building.
- And then we time our entry

362
00:16:58,372 --> 00:16:58,818
for when the guards...

363
00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:00,419
- Change shifts.
- Change shifts.

364
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,274
And then we mosey up the
stairs into Loring's office,

365
00:17:02,342 --> 00:17:03,441
we get the prize.

366
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,009
Well, you are slick.

367
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:09,314
Oh, my God, Ralph, you found her!

368
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:11,583
Oh, technically, I found him.

369
00:17:13,254 --> 00:17:14,820
Sue Dearbon.

370
00:17:14,889 --> 00:17:16,088
- Hi.
- Hi.

371
00:17:16,156 --> 00:17:17,656
Cecile Horton. Meta-human attorney.

372
00:17:17,725 --> 00:17:20,092
But I also have 20 years of experience

373
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,459
defending non-meta-humans.

374
00:17:21,528 --> 00:17:23,361
The law is my game, Cecile is my name.

375
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,497
I can cover you no matter
what you've had going on

376
00:17:25,565 --> 00:17:26,765
- all this time.
- Just need a quick word.

377
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:31,003
Oh, gotcha. Just one sec.

378
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:32,838
Listen, we're... we're...

379
00:17:32,907 --> 00:17:35,039
we're kind of in the middle of something.

380
00:17:35,109 --> 00:17:36,741
Sue's been on the
run for the last year.

381
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,111
It turns out that someone's after her.

382
00:17:40,514 --> 00:17:43,315
And you're her knight in shining armor?

383
00:17:43,384 --> 00:17:45,884
Ralph, I love it!

384
00:17:45,953 --> 00:17:48,087
By the way, you two?

385
00:17:48,155 --> 00:17:50,989
When I read the both of you with my powers,

386
00:17:51,058 --> 00:17:53,125
I could barely tell you apart.

387
00:17:53,193 --> 00:17:55,593
Like, emotionally speaking,

388
00:17:55,662 --> 00:17:59,832
you and Sue are definitely
surfing the same wave.

389
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,199
Just trying to keep her safe.

390
00:18:01,268 --> 00:18:03,335
I mean, it's not like we're dating.

391
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:05,111
"Do you want more coffee?"

392
00:18:05,112 --> 00:18:06,552
"No, thanks."

393
00:18:09,043 --> 00:18:13,045
I can't believe I didn't
think of this before.

394
00:18:14,481 --> 00:18:17,282
You would have, eventually.

395
00:18:29,696 --> 00:18:32,030
What's happening?

396
00:18:40,574 --> 00:18:42,540
No.

397
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:44,142
It should've worked.

398
00:18:44,211 --> 00:18:45,643
No.

399
00:18:48,015 --> 00:18:50,515
No.

400
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:06,631
I really thought I was
going back to my old life.

401
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,466
Eva, you will.

402
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:11,670
It doesn't even matter anymore.

403
00:19:13,673 --> 00:19:16,774
My sweet Joseph.

404
00:19:16,843 --> 00:19:18,510
We were so in love.

405
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:24,749
I saw him in the mirror.

406
00:19:24,818 --> 00:19:26,318
I watched him for five years

407
00:19:26,386 --> 00:19:31,990
as he mourned, grieved, and...

408
00:19:32,058 --> 00:19:34,692
moved on.

409
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:38,029
And I can't... I...

410
00:19:38,098 --> 00:19:40,632
I can't move on.

411
00:20:09,986 --> 00:20:12,264
Oh, my gosh. Nash.

412
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:15,200
I didn't think anyone
else would be down here.

413
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,070
I-I lost something down here, so.

414
00:20:18,138 --> 00:20:20,138
Oh, right. Well, that makes sense.

415
00:20:20,206 --> 00:20:22,740
These Starchives are so massive.

416
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:25,110
- Okay.
- Okay.

417
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,213
I'm sorry, what were you doing down here?

418
00:20:28,282 --> 00:20:30,515
Cisco asked me to hold down the fort

419
00:20:30,584 --> 00:20:31,916
while he...

420
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:33,385
He wanted me to take the inventory,

421
00:20:33,454 --> 00:20:35,487
so I gotta do that. It sucks.

422
00:20:35,555 --> 00:20:36,688
That's a lie.

423
00:20:42,104 --> 00:20:43,228
What are you doing here?

424
00:20:43,297 --> 00:20:44,863
I lost Nora's journal.

425
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:47,031
I haven't seen it for a couple weeks.

426
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,666
And...

427
00:20:48,735 --> 00:20:50,568
you know, it's the only thing I have left

428
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:52,170
of my daughter, so.

429
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:56,240
- Ah, must be hard.
- You would know, wouldn't you?

430
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,843
Now that I think about
it, that's probably...

431
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:00,678
I am digging up the past,

432
00:21:00,747 --> 00:21:02,948
and, you know, maybe I should

433
00:21:03,017 --> 00:21:06,084
start living in the present.

434
00:21:06,153 --> 00:21:07,586
So should we all.

435
00:21:07,654 --> 00:21:09,854
But it's difficult for you.

436
00:21:09,923 --> 00:21:11,890
Isn't it, Nash?

437
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:15,027
There's so much unfinished business.

438
00:21:15,095 --> 00:21:16,695
- Look, Nash.
- Right.

439
00:21:16,763 --> 00:21:19,498
Barry doesn't know about this.

440
00:21:19,566 --> 00:21:20,832
He'll be crushed if he knew

441
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:23,034
that I lost anything of Nora's, so.

442
00:21:23,103 --> 00:21:26,738
Could you maybe not mention

443
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:28,273
me being down here?

444
00:21:28,342 --> 00:21:31,743
Maybe you should mention
why you're down here.

445
00:21:31,811 --> 00:21:33,178
It'll be our little secret.

446
00:21:33,247 --> 00:21:35,647
I always knew I liked you.

447
00:21:42,874 --> 00:21:45,546
THE DIARY OF HARRISON "HARRY" WELLS

448
00:22:04,311 --> 00:22:06,311
Loring's office is right up those stairs.

449
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,182
Last one there buys the Gingold.

450
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,583
Hey!

451
00:22:11,651 --> 00:22:13,718
Freeze! Stop or we'll shoot!

452
00:22:21,728 --> 00:22:23,561
- At least he's not a pack rat.
- Focus.

453
00:22:27,267 --> 00:22:29,000
- Not finding it.
- Search faster.

454
00:22:31,705 --> 00:22:33,805
- Think I've got something.
- That's not a ledger.

455
00:22:33,873 --> 00:22:36,174
No, it's a key for a safety deposit box

456
00:22:36,243 --> 00:22:37,875
at the CC Mercantile Bank.

457
00:22:37,944 --> 00:22:41,913
Where I'm guessing your ex hid
the ledger for safe keeping.

458
00:22:41,982 --> 00:22:44,916
Good point. Time to go.

459
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,658
We have a problem.

460
00:22:53,727 --> 00:22:56,761
- Do you trust me?
- Define trust.

461
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,196
Hang on.

462
00:22:58,265 --> 00:22:59,664
Are you crazy?

463
00:22:59,733 --> 00:23:01,065
Sometimes?

464
00:23:01,134 --> 00:23:02,634
Don't let go.

465
00:23:15,616 --> 00:23:17,381
We just...

466
00:23:17,451 --> 00:23:19,818
You just...

467
00:23:19,886 --> 00:23:21,420
You're the Elongated Man?

468
00:23:21,488 --> 00:23:23,755
Yeah, I'm just full of surprises.

469
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:31,330
How... how did you become

470
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:33,427
the Elongated Man, anyway?

471
00:23:34,322 --> 00:23:35,554
I was brutally experimented on

472
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,356
by a covert organization for years.

473
00:23:37,425 --> 00:23:40,493
They forced me to consume
rubber-based polymer compounds.

474
00:23:40,562 --> 00:23:43,196
- Seriously?
- No.

475
00:23:43,264 --> 00:23:45,598
I rode a bus.

476
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:51,303
So you're, like, an
honest-to-God superhero.

477
00:23:51,372 --> 00:23:52,605
What's that like?

478
00:23:52,674 --> 00:23:53,939
It's like any other job you love.

479
00:23:54,008 --> 00:23:57,342
It's rewarding as hell.

480
00:23:57,411 --> 00:24:00,145
But boy, the hours? Let me tell you.

481
00:24:00,214 --> 00:24:01,714
Seriously.

482
00:24:01,782 --> 00:24:04,917
You're like a...

483
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:05,984
good person.

484
00:24:06,053 --> 00:24:07,220
I helped you get a key.

485
00:24:07,288 --> 00:24:08,187
It's no ledger.

486
00:24:08,255 --> 00:24:09,388
Well, Loring's ledger

487
00:24:09,456 --> 00:24:11,357
will definitely be in the box

488
00:24:11,426 --> 00:24:12,758
that goes with this.

489
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:14,360
Now we know where the box is located.

490
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:16,362
All we have to do is open it.

491
00:24:16,431 --> 00:24:19,298
And then you can get back to your life.

492
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:21,834
Listen...

493
00:24:21,903 --> 00:24:24,737
I want you to know how
much I appreciate you

494
00:24:24,805 --> 00:24:27,907
trusting me with your secret.

495
00:24:27,975 --> 00:24:30,743
It means a lot.

496
00:24:35,116 --> 00:24:36,515
I can call my friends at CCPD

497
00:24:36,584 --> 00:24:38,951
and get a warrant for Loring's deposit box.

498
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,085
Shouldn't take more than a day.

499
00:24:40,155 --> 00:24:41,854
We don't have a day.

500
00:24:41,923 --> 00:24:43,189
Loring's already spooked.

501
00:24:43,258 --> 00:24:44,690
He could move that box at any minute.

502
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:46,925
I feel like our only chance at...

503
00:24:46,994 --> 00:24:48,360
- nah, it's too crazy.
- Come on.

504
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:50,262
Share your thoughts with the class.

505
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,766
What if...

506
00:24:55,603 --> 00:24:58,638
We break into CC Mercantile Bank now?

507
00:24:58,706 --> 00:24:59,839
Just us.

508
00:24:59,907 --> 00:25:01,174
And take the ledger for ourselves.

509
00:25:01,242 --> 00:25:02,808
Believe that's called stealing.

510
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:05,210
Oh, come on, Slick.

511
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,845
You're also a P.I.

512
00:25:06,914 --> 00:25:09,281
You can't tell me you've
always operated by the book.

513
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,885
No, but I can't commit a crime.

514
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:16,822
I get it.

515
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:18,724
And I respect that.

516
00:25:18,793 --> 00:25:21,360
But Ralph, I'm not a hero.

517
00:25:21,428 --> 00:25:23,262
So if this is the only chance I have

518
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,265
to see my parents again,

519
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:28,701
I have to take it.

520
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,669
Sue...

521
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:31,970
being a hero,

522
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:35,508
it's about helping innocent people.

523
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:38,477
I'm not gonna let you do this alone.

524
00:25:38,546 --> 00:25:40,213
- You're not?
- No.

525
00:25:40,281 --> 00:25:42,514
But we do this my way.

526
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,717
We get inside, get the ledger,

527
00:25:44,786 --> 00:25:48,186
and immediately bring it
to my friends at CCPD.

528
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:51,089
Deal or no deal?

529
00:25:53,694 --> 00:25:55,361
Deal.

530
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:00,633
So? What did you find out?

531
00:26:00,701 --> 00:26:01,967
These scorch marks.

532
00:26:02,036 --> 00:26:03,235
They're giant burns like

533
00:26:03,303 --> 00:26:05,671
sunlight through a magnifying glass.

534
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,173
So in your expert CSI opinion...

535
00:26:08,242 --> 00:26:10,876
The fire was started by UV light rays.

536
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:15,014
Same way Dr. Light torched "The Citizen."

537
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:17,917
All right, Joe.

538
00:26:17,985 --> 00:26:19,318
What's going on?

539
00:26:19,387 --> 00:26:22,321
Look, this isn't the only file I found

540
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:26,024
where it looks like something
had fallen through the cracks.

541
00:26:26,093 --> 00:26:30,195
All of these cases involve
accidental deaths.

542
00:26:30,264 --> 00:26:31,731
All the victims are associated

543
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,999
with this guy Joseph Carver.

544
00:26:34,068 --> 00:26:37,703
I'm start to think that
somebody here in CCPD

545
00:26:37,772 --> 00:26:40,105
is helping him cover this up.

546
00:26:43,944 --> 00:26:45,410
You think there's a mole here?

547
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,947
Carver's influence runs deep, man.

548
00:26:48,015 --> 00:26:50,850
Governors, mayor, CEOs.

549
00:26:50,918 --> 00:26:53,586
Okay, all right...

550
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,388
look, this is what Iris
is already investigating.

551
00:26:56,457 --> 00:26:59,291
Her lead had to do with the mirror gun

552
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,661
that we stole from McCulloch
Technologies last year.

553
00:27:01,729 --> 00:27:04,530
It fell through because I
wouldn't give it to her.

554
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:05,931
Why didn't you give it to her?

555
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,400
- I mean, was it dangerous?
- Yeah, yeah.

556
00:27:07,468 --> 00:27:08,934
I mean, it could put her in danger.

557
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:10,069
Yeah, I don't trust what the world might do

558
00:27:10,137 --> 00:27:11,504
if that gun got out there.

559
00:27:11,572 --> 00:27:13,105
Yeah, well, the world is crazy,

560
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:16,141
but it's clear that Carver
is really dangerous.

561
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,711
Iris is your partner and family,

562
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:20,613
and I don't think we can
trust this right now

563
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:24,282
with anybody other than family.

564
00:27:27,922 --> 00:27:29,388
I'm sorry you're not gonna
see your husband again,

565
00:27:29,456 --> 00:27:31,457
but it's easier if you just accept it.

566
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:36,095
Eva, you said that you wanna
go back to your old life.

567
00:27:36,163 --> 00:27:39,631
Look, maybe it's gone, but
you can start a new one.

568
00:27:40,768 --> 00:27:43,202
I'm glad it's broken.

569
00:27:45,139 --> 00:27:47,506
I'm glad it's broken.

570
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:53,145
I'm tired of looking at a world
that doesn't want me anyway.

571
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:57,249
I'm tired of waiting for
someone to come and rescue me.

572
00:27:57,317 --> 00:28:00,019
And I'm sick and tired of people

573
00:28:00,087 --> 00:28:03,055
telling me that everything
is gonna be all right.

574
00:28:03,124 --> 00:28:04,824
Because it isn't.

575
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:07,960
It's never gonna be all right!

576
00:28:08,028 --> 00:28:10,028
Never!

577
00:28:18,705 --> 00:28:22,141
What just happened?

578
00:28:22,209 --> 00:28:25,177
I think we just found
our way out of here.

579
00:28:27,048 --> 00:28:29,247
And you're sure this is necessary?

580
00:28:29,316 --> 00:28:31,049
A credible tip came in to CCPD

581
00:28:31,118 --> 00:28:34,186
saying this branch was a
target for robbery, so yes.

582
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:37,490
Well, this is the only way
in or out of the vault.

583
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:38,791
The inner gate is fitted

584
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:40,526
with an anti-theft electrical system.

585
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:43,262
Opening or closing it
without the manager's key

586
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:46,198
automatically activates a
50,000 volt fail-safe.

587
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:48,300
An electric fence to keep the cattle in.

588
00:28:48,368 --> 00:28:49,869
- Yeah.
- Smart.

589
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,203
Thanks, pal.

590
00:28:53,407 --> 00:28:57,076
Sweet Fancy Moses.

591
00:29:00,332 --> 00:29:03,648
I understand why people are
grossed out when I do that.

592
00:29:03,717 --> 00:29:05,117
Your turn, Slick.

593
00:29:05,185 --> 00:29:06,751
Oh, right.

594
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:14,159
You know, besides a passion for fisticuffs

595
00:29:14,228 --> 00:29:16,128
you've got a real knack for detective work.

596
00:29:16,197 --> 00:29:18,864
You ever think about getting behind a desk?

597
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:21,800
That sounds worse
than my boarding school.

598
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:23,468
Or the times my parents made me take

599
00:29:23,537 --> 00:29:24,903
horseback riding lessons.

600
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:27,305
Or learning French every Saturday

601
00:29:27,374 --> 00:29:31,076
at the US Embassy in Paris.

602
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,316
Gee, your childhood sounds just awful.

603
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:40,319
I didn't say it was awful.

604
00:29:40,387 --> 00:29:43,456
It just wasn't me.

605
00:29:43,524 --> 00:29:44,857
The truth is,

606
00:29:44,925 --> 00:29:48,526
I always hated the whole socialite scene.

607
00:29:48,595 --> 00:29:51,230
Which is why, one day,
I woke up and realized

608
00:29:51,298 --> 00:29:53,966
I had no idea who I was.

609
00:29:54,035 --> 00:29:57,302
Guess I still haven't figured
out exactly where I belong.

610
00:29:58,439 --> 00:29:59,938
Poor little rich girl.

611
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,941
How could she be so lost?

612
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:05,911
No, I... I get it.

613
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,681
I used to wear that uniform you've got on.

614
00:30:08,749 --> 00:30:11,450
I was a cop. A damn good one.

615
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:15,654
And then that ended abruptly,
and I got lost too.

616
00:30:15,722 --> 00:30:19,758
And I rode that bus, and
found where I belong.

617
00:30:19,827 --> 00:30:22,327
So you're saying there's hope for me?

618
00:30:22,396 --> 00:30:25,698
There is from where I'm standing.

619
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:31,403
So, partner.

620
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:37,209
It's a big moment. You
mind if I do the honors?

621
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:40,045
Of course.

622
00:30:40,114 --> 00:30:42,147
You earned it.

623
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,326
- Found it.
- Must be a tiny ledger.

624
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,428
Now what do you say we get out
of here and play "Mario Kart"...

625
00:31:01,468 --> 00:31:02,835
What the hell?

626
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:09,774
I guess you're not the only
one that's full of surprises.

627
00:31:15,234 --> 00:31:16,867
We are this close to taking down Loring.

628
00:31:19,882 --> 00:31:22,516
Sue, why are you doing this?

629
00:31:22,585 --> 00:31:25,752
Who cares about Loring? I
don't even know the guy.

630
00:31:25,821 --> 00:31:27,254
I do, however,

631
00:31:27,322 --> 00:31:29,790
know where he keeps his valuables.

632
00:31:33,762 --> 00:31:35,762
There never was a ledger.

633
00:31:35,831 --> 00:31:37,330
- Keep going.
- That's why you rented

634
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:39,399
an apartment in Central City.

635
00:31:39,467 --> 00:31:42,035
You knew I was keeping tabs on you,

636
00:31:42,104 --> 00:31:45,172
so... so you lured me in.

637
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,874
You rigged your own
apartment to explode for...

638
00:31:47,943 --> 00:31:49,743
for what? Just to sell the story of...

639
00:31:49,812 --> 00:31:52,379
of sympathetic socialite
running for her life?

640
00:31:52,447 --> 00:31:54,847
You bought it.

641
00:31:54,917 --> 00:31:57,050
But don't feel bad.

642
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:58,652
You're a good guy.

643
00:31:58,721 --> 00:32:00,253
And a hero.

644
00:32:00,322 --> 00:32:02,422
You probably see the best in everyone.

645
00:32:02,491 --> 00:32:06,093
Me, I see what I want

646
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:07,828
and I take it.

647
00:32:07,897 --> 00:32:09,162
You used my detective mind

648
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:12,265
to track down Loring's deposit box.

649
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:15,202
You... you played everyone.

650
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:19,740
Your parents are desperate to find you.

651
00:32:19,808 --> 00:32:21,208
Do they even know what you really are?

652
00:32:21,276 --> 00:32:24,277
No. That's our little secret.

653
00:32:24,346 --> 00:32:29,282
If they found out their
only daughter was a thief,

654
00:32:29,351 --> 00:32:30,817
they'd be devastated.

655
00:32:30,885 --> 00:32:33,019
So you keep your mouth shut about who I am,

656
00:32:33,088 --> 00:32:35,655
I keep mine shut about who you are.

657
00:32:35,724 --> 00:32:38,859
Deal, Elongated Man?

658
00:32:38,927 --> 00:32:43,096
Sue, was anything you told me real?

659
00:32:43,165 --> 00:32:45,365
Yes.

660
00:32:45,433 --> 00:32:46,633
And no.

661
00:32:46,702 --> 00:32:47,968
See you around, Slick.

662
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:05,485
CCPD.

663
00:33:05,554 --> 00:33:06,786
You're all under arrest.

664
00:33:06,855 --> 00:33:08,288
Nice try, officer.

665
00:33:08,356 --> 00:33:11,124
But I have a silent alarm
on my deposit box.

666
00:33:11,193 --> 00:33:13,526
So I know you stole that from me.

667
00:33:15,764 --> 00:33:17,263
No phone.

668
00:33:17,332 --> 00:33:18,598
Can't stretch through these bars

669
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:21,201
without getting seriously toasty.

670
00:33:25,407 --> 00:33:27,340
Always come prepared.

671
00:33:27,409 --> 00:33:29,876
- You don't wanna do this.
- Yeah, I do.

672
00:33:29,945 --> 00:33:31,612
I'm that guy.

673
00:33:45,093 --> 00:33:46,927
You're not getting rid of me that easily.

674
00:33:48,363 --> 00:33:50,931
- Give us a minute.
- Kill 'em both.

675
00:33:54,669 --> 00:33:56,036
I'm inside you?

676
00:33:56,105 --> 00:33:57,503
Do you have any idea how
disgusting this is?

677
00:33:57,572 --> 00:34:00,040
- I'm saving your life.
- No, you're not.

678
00:34:00,108 --> 00:34:01,374
We are not partners.

679
00:34:01,443 --> 00:34:02,642
I have handled being shot at before.

680
00:34:02,711 --> 00:34:04,044
Why does that not surprise me?

681
00:34:04,112 --> 00:34:05,846
- Let me out.
- Sure, I'll let you out.

682
00:34:05,914 --> 00:34:07,280
And then I'll take you to Iron Heights

683
00:34:07,349 --> 00:34:09,649
as soon as these idiots run out of ammo.

684
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:13,520
Do you ever shut up? Do something.

685
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:15,488
I am doing something.

686
00:34:15,557 --> 00:34:17,024
What's your contribution to
this quaint little scenario?

687
00:34:17,092 --> 00:34:18,258
Oh, wait, nothing.

688
00:34:18,327 --> 00:34:20,360
This is all your fault.

689
00:34:23,065 --> 00:34:25,231
Always come prepared.

690
00:34:48,457 --> 00:34:50,490
Is there anyone that
doesn't want to kill you?

691
00:34:50,558 --> 00:34:52,325
Not really.

692
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:02,202
I have really gotta learn Spanish.

693
00:35:13,348 --> 00:35:15,482
You want the diamond?

694
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,783
Come and get it.

695
00:36:09,704 --> 00:36:12,905
Looks like we've both been had.

696
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,513
She softened him up.

697
00:36:20,582 --> 00:36:22,081
Let's finish the job.

698
00:36:29,657 --> 00:36:30,923
It's all yours, Captain West.

699
00:36:30,992 --> 00:36:33,693
Thanks, Flash. Clear this out, guys.

700
00:36:33,761 --> 00:36:35,762
- Hey, bud.
- Flash.

701
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,963
- Yeah.
- It's him.

702
00:36:37,031 --> 00:36:38,898
He's the one who robbed us.

703
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:40,300
Excuse me?

704
00:36:40,368 --> 00:36:41,734
That's a case of mistaken identity, sir.

705
00:36:41,803 --> 00:36:44,237
I'm sure Captain West can explain.

706
00:36:44,306 --> 00:36:47,374
It's all right.

707
00:36:47,442 --> 00:36:49,141
Hey man, I'm sorry I got word late,

708
00:36:49,211 --> 00:36:51,478
but I searched the whole area.
Ultraviolet's gone.

709
00:36:51,546 --> 00:36:54,681
Couldn't stop her. But don't
worry, we'll get her.

710
00:36:54,682 --> 00:36:55,330
I promise.

711
00:36:55,331 --> 00:36:59,186
I wasn't talking about Ultraviolet.

712
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:04,776
Loring's in custody,

713
00:37:04,845 --> 00:37:06,878
but facial recognition isn't
picking her up anywhere

714
00:37:06,947 --> 00:37:08,679
in Central City.

715
00:37:08,748 --> 00:37:11,549
Looks like Sue Dearbon has vanished.

716
00:37:11,618 --> 00:37:13,084
Again.

717
00:37:13,153 --> 00:37:15,153
That's on me.

718
00:37:15,222 --> 00:37:16,220
She played me, Iris.

719
00:37:16,289 --> 00:37:19,624
Like... Coltrane's soprano sax.

720
00:37:19,693 --> 00:37:21,392
Ralph, you can't beat yourself up.

721
00:37:21,462 --> 00:37:23,628
I mean, it's not like you knew
who you were dealing with.

722
00:37:23,696 --> 00:37:26,497
I'm supposed to be a master detective!

723
00:37:26,566 --> 00:37:28,499
Ralph, we've all put our trust in people

724
00:37:28,568 --> 00:37:31,102
who have betrayed us. God knows I have.

725
00:37:31,171 --> 00:37:33,972
I'm gonna go tear down my crime board.

726
00:37:37,911 --> 00:37:41,913
It's gonna take him a
while to get over this one.

727
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:46,685
Hey, Joe told me that
you came by CCPD today.

728
00:37:46,753 --> 00:37:48,720
I think I know why you didn't come say hi.

729
00:38:01,768 --> 00:38:04,268
What happened to it falling
into the wrong hands?

730
00:38:04,337 --> 00:38:07,305
These are the right hands.

731
00:38:07,373 --> 00:38:10,341
Joe and I found evidence
linking Carver's assassins

732
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,642
to more killings.

733
00:38:11,711 --> 00:38:14,545
Crimes that CCPD thought were accidents.

734
00:38:14,614 --> 00:38:18,717
Black Hole is a lot more
dangerous than I even realized.

735
00:38:18,785 --> 00:38:21,953
But if you can use this in
your investigation in any way

736
00:38:22,022 --> 00:38:24,055
to bring down Carver and his people faster,

737
00:38:24,124 --> 00:38:28,026
then that's a good thing.

738
00:38:28,095 --> 00:38:32,797
And while I don't trust the world...

739
00:38:32,865 --> 00:38:35,133
I do trust you.

740
00:38:35,202 --> 00:38:37,135
With everything.

741
00:38:42,309 --> 00:38:45,143
Thank you.

742
00:38:51,585 --> 00:38:53,684
You have a connection to the mirror, even

743
00:38:53,753 --> 00:38:57,722
when it's broken.

744
00:38:57,791 --> 00:39:00,191
Now who sounds crazy?

745
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,994
I've seen a lot of strange
things in the last six years.

746
00:39:03,063 --> 00:39:06,097
You being able to control that
mirror is the least of it.

747
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:08,666
Sam Scudder could even travel through them.

748
00:39:08,735 --> 00:39:11,369
Well, I'm not a meta-criminal
who jumps through mirrors

749
00:39:11,437 --> 00:39:13,071
to rob banks.

750
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,872
I know.

751
00:39:14,941 --> 00:39:16,574
You're much more than that.

752
00:39:16,643 --> 00:39:18,443
We're the only people in this world, Eva,

753
00:39:18,511 --> 00:39:22,547
so trust me when I say that
you're stronger than you think.

754
00:39:22,615 --> 00:39:25,583
You're a survivor.

755
00:39:25,652 --> 00:39:31,489
Now prove it.

756
00:39:37,864 --> 00:39:40,331
You did it. Now keep going.

757
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:19,437
1,323...

758
00:40:38,491 --> 00:40:40,591
I'm still with you.

759
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:55,740
How did I do that?

760
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,713
I don't know.

761
00:41:02,782 --> 00:41:05,250
But I promise you, we will figure it out.

762
00:41:46,659 --> 00:41:49,527
Game on.

763
00:41:49,528 --> 00:41:51,133
