00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:32,823
Good morning, Ladies, good morning.

2
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:35,208
Do you speak English?

3
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:38,155
I, I...

4
00:25:41,803 --> 00:25:42,348
Help.

5
00:25:42,373 --> 00:25:44,008
Help, help. Thank you.

6
00:25:44,213 --> 00:25:46,948
I need, need... help.

7
00:25:47,377 --> 00:25:49,071
To clean, yes?

8
00:25:49,868 --> 00:25:50,975
What?

9
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,223
Understand?

10
00:25:53,371 --> 00:25:54,634
What do you want?

11
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,420
It's fine.

12
00:25:56,983 --> 00:26:00,150
Please, please.
To the back, to the back. Yes.

13
00:26:00,296 --> 00:26:01,840
Very good.

14
00:26:01,902 --> 00:26:03,342
<i>What do you think?</i>

15
00:26:05,206 --> 00:26:06,916
Very good.

16
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:10,674
No, no, no. We can't.

17
00:26:10,947 --> 00:26:11,649
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

18
00:26:11,674 --> 00:26:13,488
No, no. There's no problem.

19
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,125
One moment, one moment.

20
00:26:15,432 --> 00:26:17,268
Not there, not there.

21
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:17,971
Can we?

22
00:26:17,996 --> 00:26:18,632
No.

23
00:26:18,796 --> 00:26:21,201
We can't.
We must go back to work.

24
00:26:21,935 --> 00:26:23,987
One moment, one moment.

25
00:26:25,441 --> 00:26:27,848
I need... Help...

26
00:26:28,406 --> 00:26:31,326
To clean. Two hours maximum.

27
00:26:31,593 --> 00:26:32,566
<i>No, we can't...</i>

28
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,392
Very easy.

29
00:26:33,457 --> 00:26:35,601
They'll fire us.
He wants to do the back.

30
00:26:40,568 --> 00:26:41,899
Money.

31
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,239
For you.

32
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:45,923
Yes, yes, yes. For you.

33
00:26:48,004 --> 00:26:48,850
Yes.

34
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,417
President Grant.

35
00:26:51,441 --> 00:26:52,441
Yes.

36
00:26:52,783 --> 00:26:54,442
For you. Yes.

37
00:26:55,244 --> 00:26:57,078
More money, more money...

38
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,557
<i>They'll fire us from work...</i>

39
00:26:59,833 --> 00:27:01,251
It's only two hours.

40
00:27:01,276 --> 00:27:03,260
But they'll fire us...

41
00:27:03,939 --> 00:27:05,799
We'll be without a job...

42
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,486
Let's go.

43
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,934
Two hours maximum, yes.

44
00:27:10,615 --> 00:27:12,590
Please, please.

45
00:27:14,302 --> 00:27:15,960
Equal!

46
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:32,712
<i>But what does one do for money, right?</i>
