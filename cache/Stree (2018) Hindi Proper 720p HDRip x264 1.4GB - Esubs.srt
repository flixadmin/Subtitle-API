2
00:02:41,681 --> 00:02:44,973
O Stree come tomorrow

3
00:03:04,973 --> 00:03:09,306
O Stree come tomorrow

4
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:41,306
Prakash.

5
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,848
Prakash...

6
00:04:06,473 --> 00:04:09,514
Prakash!

7
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:58,723
O Stree come tomorrow

8
00:05:37,764 --> 00:05:41,264
"The heart's completely open,
with no hook or button..."

9
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:43,014
"No button."

10
00:05:47,224 --> 00:05:48,724
"Dreams are larger than life..."

11
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:50,808
"...and a mind that cares for no one."

12
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:52,558
"...cares for no one."

13
00:05:55,794 --> 00:06:00,092
"My dreams are too
big to fit in this city."

14
00:06:00,172 --> 00:06:01,599
"Bigger than the city..."

15
00:06:01,683 --> 00:06:06,561
"I can fix your pain
with just a smile."

16
00:06:06,974 --> 00:06:09,433
"I am the tailor of Heart."

17
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:14,308
"Like a bird soaring in the skies."

18
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:15,433
Hey...

19
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:19,058
"I am the tailor of love."

20
00:06:21,474 --> 00:06:25,391
"Like a bird soaring in the skies."

21
00:06:26,224 --> 00:06:28,974
"I am the tailor of Heart."

22
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:47,266
"Stitch me a beautiful dress,
sweetheart..."

23
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:50,141
"...which makes me
look more charming."

24
00:06:50,224 --> 00:06:52,891
"I am the tailor of Heart."

25
00:06:55,058 --> 00:06:59,391
"Like a bird soaring in the skies."

26
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:02,224
"I am the tailor of Heart."

27
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:07,058
Uncle...you start this charade
in every festival, don't you?

28
00:07:08,474 --> 00:07:10,683
Vicky, there's still time.

29
00:07:11,058 --> 00:07:12,808
But, this is no ordinary ink.

30
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:17,558
These are crushed bones of a bat
mixed with the pee of a white crow.

31
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:19,266
That's how this ink is prepared.

32
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:23,766
Uncle, sell these stories to
those who like reading Aesop's fables.

33
00:07:24,516 --> 00:07:25,641
We're the modern generation.

34
00:07:26,683 --> 00:07:28,391
The entire city believes
in this ignorance.

35
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:32,474
Vicky, any house that has
this ink outside their house...

36
00:07:32,558 --> 00:07:34,974
...will always be safe from 'Stree'.

37
00:07:35,058 --> 00:07:35,933
I see...

38
00:07:36,183 --> 00:07:38,099
Have you ever heard that the
Ambani's daughter was possessed?

39
00:07:38,766 --> 00:07:40,391
Or the Tatas or Birla's were haunted.

40
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:42,141
I know she will come.

41
00:07:42,724 --> 00:07:44,933
Loosen your pockets
and let me finish writing.

42
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:47,933
Uncle, don't forget
to write on our wall too.

43
00:07:48,474 --> 00:07:51,349
And listen, write it in bold.

44
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:55,599
Otherwise, she might not
read it and come right in.

45
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:57,683
Yes, I will.

46
00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:00,308
Your mouth will end
up like that aunty.

47
00:08:04,474 --> 00:08:06,099
Close the gate, mister.

48
00:08:07,224 --> 00:08:08,391
Or the cow will barge in.

49
00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:10,141
I am the watchman as well.

50
00:08:10,516 --> 00:08:11,811
So you finally found
time to come home.

51
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:12,724
What's the matter?

52
00:08:12,808 --> 00:08:15,141
- You should also come with me from tomorrow.
- I don't need to.

53
00:08:15,224 --> 00:08:16,724
The sewing machine gives
me all the exercise I need.

54
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:18,474
And, you don't need this either.

55
00:08:18,641 --> 00:08:20,183
Or soon you'll be
hanging from a hanger.

56
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:21,558
Was that a joke?

57
00:08:21,724 --> 00:08:23,016
And you're trying to be wise.

58
00:08:23,516 --> 00:08:25,224
I'm already observing a fast
for the next four days.

59
00:08:25,308 --> 00:08:26,599
And, you're making me waste my energy.

60
00:08:26,895 --> 00:08:29,433
- Another fast?
- Focus on your job.

61
00:08:29,516 --> 00:08:32,139
Soon the ladies will queue up.

62
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:36,141
I've told you before
stop taking alteration work.

63
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,516
"Loosen the petticoat,
tighten my blouse."

64
00:08:38,808 --> 00:08:41,016
We'll only accept orders
for stitching new clothes.

65
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:43,266
Brand new clothes only.

66
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,183
Only?

67
00:08:44,974 --> 00:08:46,891
And what will you do for
the rest of the year, son?

68
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:48,516
Ring the bell.

69
00:08:48,683 --> 00:08:50,891
Daddy, explaining you is impossible.

70
00:08:50,974 --> 00:08:51,641
Listen...

71
00:08:52,308 --> 00:08:53,933
Listen... Listen... Listen...

72
00:08:54,683 --> 00:09:00,349
You should spend some time
learning how to run the shop.

73
00:09:00,891 --> 00:09:04,058
Otherwise,
if someday your dad passes away...

74
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:05,933
...you won't be able
to run the show alone.

75
00:09:06,016 --> 00:09:09,933
Even if Death comes himself
to collect your soul, you won't die.

76
00:09:10,474 --> 00:09:13,891
Even when your fingers will become frail,
you'll still be altering lady's dresses.

77
00:09:14,224 --> 00:09:16,974
Son, soon you'll be following
in my footsteps.

78
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:22,724
Daddy, I wasn't born
to alter lady's dresses.

79
00:09:22,808 --> 00:09:24,599
Then what are you destined for, son?

80
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:27,599
I don't know yet, dad.
But I will know pretty soon.

81
00:09:27,683 --> 00:09:31,224
(Rap Song)

82
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:44,266
Let them in.

83
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:46,058
How are you, brother Vicky?

84
00:09:46,474 --> 00:09:48,058
Stitch a dress for me.

85
00:09:48,391 --> 00:09:49,516
Take down sister-in-law's
measurements.

86
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:50,349
Step back a little.

87
00:09:51,951 --> 00:09:53,811
Length;48, Shoulder; 14.5.

88
00:09:53,891 --> 00:09:54,933
- Take off the shawl, sister-in-law.
- Yes.

89
00:09:55,016 --> 00:09:59,391
Arm-hole;16, Wrist;
7, Chest; 38, waist; 42.

90
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:00,516
Turn around, sister-in-law.

91
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,058
Hip;44, Neck:10

92
00:10:03,141 --> 00:10:04,141
Deep or Medium?

93
00:10:04,474 --> 00:10:05,349
No, not deep.

94
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:06,183
Keep it medium.

95
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:07,891
Deep's better, sister-in-law.
It's in fashion these days.

96
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,183
You'll look nice.

97
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:12,974
I am telling you, my son
is the tailor-incarnation of God.

98
00:10:13,058 --> 00:10:13,891
Do you want it tighter?

99
00:10:14,099 --> 00:10:15,391
The shoulder on this dress...

100
00:10:15,474 --> 00:10:18,724
But this idiot doesn't
respect his own talent.

101
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:21,974
(Rap Song)

102
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:35,891
What is this boy, Khan sir?
What is he?

103
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:38,099
I've stitched thousands of clothes.

104
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:40,558
But the way his fingers
moves on the machine...

105
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:43,266
...feels like God's fingers
moving on the machine.

106
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:48,641
The way he handles the scissors sounds
like Goddess Saraswati's playing her Veena.

107
00:10:49,224 --> 00:10:54,099
When he puts a thread in the needle,
I can hear conches resonating in my ears.

108
00:10:54,974 --> 00:10:58,686
I am sure it's some
connection from his past life.

109
00:10:58,766 --> 00:11:01,016
"I am the tailor of Heart."

110
00:11:03,724 --> 00:11:07,558
"Like a bird soaring in the skies."

111
00:11:08,476 --> 00:11:10,808
"I am the tailor of Heart."

112
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:15,599
I'll be back in 10 minutes, dad.

113
00:11:15,683 --> 00:11:16,308
Break time.

114
00:11:18,058 --> 00:11:20,016
"I am the tailor of Heart."

115
00:11:46,952 --> 00:11:47,349
Hi.

116
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:53,016
Hi...

117
00:11:53,175 --> 00:11:56,349
- Is your name Vicky?
- Yes.

118
00:11:57,431 --> 00:11:59,348
I saw you last year at the festival.

119
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,389
Okay...

120
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:03,848
I've heard a lot about you.

121
00:12:06,098 --> 00:12:09,264
I don't live here, but I come
every year during the festival.

122
00:12:10,556 --> 00:12:11,306
I see... okay.

123
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:15,014
- Can you stitch a dress for me?
- Okay.

124
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:18,473
- How long?
- 2 weeks.

125
00:12:18,764 --> 00:12:19,973
Can't you do it earlier?

126
00:12:22,014 --> 00:12:23,098
How about 10 days?

127
00:12:23,306 --> 00:12:24,681
I want it on the last
day of the festival.

128
00:12:25,431 --> 00:12:26,556
To wear it during the
auspicious veneration.

129
00:12:36,473 --> 00:12:37,723
Vicky, please.

130
00:12:39,931 --> 00:12:41,306
Give it earlier.

131
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:46,598
It's okay.

132
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:48,264
I'll get it done by someone else.

133
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:49,098
Thank you.

134
00:12:49,598 --> 00:12:51,181
Two days... Two...

135
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:58,598
- Two days.
- Thank you so much.

136
00:13:00,973 --> 00:13:01,931
My measurements.

137
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,014
Take off the jacket.

138
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,431
Turn around.

139
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,681
Turn.

140
00:13:16,848 --> 00:13:17,514
Again.

141
00:13:20,931 --> 00:13:21,514
Done.

142
00:13:21,973 --> 00:13:22,889
Ohh...

143
00:13:24,764 --> 00:13:25,764
Thank you.

144
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:34,973
I'll be visiting the
temple in the evening.

145
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:36,306
Good.

146
00:13:42,348 --> 00:13:43,639
For the evening veneration.

147
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:44,473
Very good.

148
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:54,931
Visiting the temple...

149
00:13:55,098 --> 00:13:56,014
Okay.

150
00:14:01,264 --> 00:14:06,473
(Religious venerations)

151
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:17,473
One.

152
00:14:30,181 --> 00:14:30,681
Saw?

153
00:14:33,056 --> 00:14:36,514
She doesn't even look at you, and
you can already hear wedding bells.

154
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,598
And you're Mister know-it-all,
aren't you?

155
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:43,556
Whenever I pass through her lane,
she always looks at me.

156
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:45,764
No, she doesn't, she stares at you.

157
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:52,264
Are you all right?

158
00:14:54,014 --> 00:14:55,806
Will you say something? What happened?

159
00:14:56,806 --> 00:14:59,806
- Love at first eye-sight.
- First eye-sight.

160
00:14:59,973 --> 00:15:01,598
Love at first sight.

161
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:03,851
We both attended the English
Speaking course together.

162
00:15:03,931 --> 00:15:05,681
Don't try to be Shakespeare.

163
00:15:06,556 --> 00:15:07,348
Who is the girl?

164
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:09,348
The same girl who attended
the festival last year.

165
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:10,931
The one with brown eyes.

166
00:15:11,764 --> 00:15:13,931
- One with the long hair.
- Yeah...

167
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:15,889
The one you bragged about last year?

168
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,098
I wasn't bragging.

169
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:20,639
She came out of nowhere
like a cool breeze.

170
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:22,598
Took my hand and said...

171
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:25,348
"Vicky, please!"

172
00:15:25,556 --> 00:15:26,556
She held your hand.

173
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:27,556
Ba***

174
00:15:27,806 --> 00:15:29,264
- And she even said please?
- Yes.

175
00:15:29,556 --> 00:15:31,264
He is lying and you believe him.

176
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:32,556
Swear on my sewing machine.

177
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,598
She held your hand and said,
Vicky, please.

178
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,723
"Vicky, please!"

179
00:15:39,223 --> 00:15:40,514
Vicky, please!

180
00:15:41,973 --> 00:15:43,181
"Vicky, please!"

181
00:15:43,306 --> 00:15:44,931
That's what I am saying,
Vicky, please.

182
00:15:45,014 --> 00:15:46,306
You have no emotions at all.

183
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:46,973
Give me your hand.

184
00:15:49,223 --> 00:15:50,431
"Vicky, please!"

185
00:15:51,264 --> 00:15:52,348
Now that's emotion.

186
00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:54,389
But why you?

187
00:15:54,556 --> 00:15:55,473
She wants me to stitch a dress.

188
00:15:56,348 --> 00:15:57,181
Stitch a dress.

189
00:15:57,264 --> 00:15:58,973
I have a readymade dress shop.

190
00:15:59,264 --> 00:16:00,723
Who gets dresses stitched nowadays.

191
00:16:00,806 --> 00:16:03,556
You idiot, stitched dresses
have a different charisma.

192
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,264
And love is never readymade.

193
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,056
It's always tailor-made.

194
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:10,473
Right.

195
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:12,431
"Vicky, please!"

196
00:16:13,351 --> 00:16:14,681
Bro put it on my tab.

197
00:16:16,473 --> 00:16:18,264
Jealous.

198
00:16:19,014 --> 00:16:20,098
She held this hand.

199
00:16:20,514 --> 00:16:21,056
Smell it.

200
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:22,848
Sunflower.

201
00:16:23,848 --> 00:16:25,848
I think you should start
planning your wedding.

202
00:16:26,431 --> 00:16:28,098
Even I can hear wedding bells, Jana.

203
00:16:28,264 --> 00:16:30,723
Hey, ...snap out of your dream world.

204
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:32,764
Today is the first
day of the festival.

205
00:16:33,056 --> 00:16:36,264
Lokesh is throwing a
party at his uncle's home.

206
00:16:36,764 --> 00:16:39,056
So we're going to have
a ball for the next four nights.

207
00:16:39,223 --> 00:16:40,306
Nobody be late.

208
00:16:40,514 --> 00:16:42,348
Meaning party all night and,
in the morning...

209
00:16:42,431 --> 00:16:43,056
Full tight.

210
00:16:43,348 --> 00:16:44,098
Right.

211
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:45,181
But that's in the morning.

212
00:16:47,514 --> 00:16:51,389
"Just tell me why
do you throw tantrums."

213
00:16:51,764 --> 00:16:55,681
"I can follow you around
like your crazy lover."

214
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:59,598
"I feel a little shy to convey."

215
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:04,306
"But, I want to sleep in your arms."

216
00:17:04,389 --> 00:17:08,181
"I've been telling
you since February came."

217
00:17:08,598 --> 00:17:11,931
"Darling,
step out of Chanderi for me."

218
00:17:12,139 --> 00:17:15,181
"Come over to my mansion."

219
00:17:23,056 --> 00:17:26,264
"Come over to my mansion."

220
00:17:31,473 --> 00:17:34,181
"Come over to my mansion."

221
00:17:41,932 --> 00:17:45,098
"Come over to my mansion."

222
00:17:50,389 --> 00:17:53,056
"Come over to my mansion."

223
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:55,056
You guys go ahead,
I'll join you later.

224
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:56,514
What are you planning to do out here?

225
00:17:57,014 --> 00:17:58,848
My heart's a little restless.

226
00:17:58,931 --> 00:17:59,973
I guess I'll just sit here and pray.

227
00:18:00,056 --> 00:18:01,973
What's wrong with you, Vicky? Why
are you feeling so religious today?

228
00:18:02,056 --> 00:18:03,181
That dancer from Bhopal
must have arrived too.

229
00:18:03,264 --> 00:18:04,098
I've been waiting
for a year to see her.

230
00:18:04,181 --> 00:18:06,223
- Let's go...
- Jana, you just go.

231
00:18:06,306 --> 00:18:07,931
- I'll come later...
- Hold on.

232
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:10,348
He's going to see that girl.

233
00:18:10,431 --> 00:18:11,431
One who said "Vicky Please".

234
00:18:11,514 --> 00:18:12,973
And he's making excuses to us.

235
00:18:13,181 --> 00:18:14,723
Is sister-in-law coming?

236
00:18:14,806 --> 00:18:15,723
Then we'll wait too.

237
00:18:15,806 --> 00:18:17,556
- What?
- No one's coming.

238
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,389
- I'll get the offerings for you.
- What offerings.

239
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,014
Stop making excuses, Vicky.

240
00:18:21,431 --> 00:18:22,903
Remember, females have been
the reason for the downfall of men.

241
00:18:22,983 --> 00:18:23,598
What?

242
00:18:23,678 --> 00:18:25,848
It was a female who disrupted
Vishwamitra's penance.

243
00:18:25,931 --> 00:18:27,348
And I am not Vishwamitra.

244
00:18:27,428 --> 00:18:28,514
And I am not looking for a boon.

245
00:18:29,431 --> 00:18:31,889
I am not standing on one leg and waiting
for some Meneka to disrupt my penance.

246
00:18:32,056 --> 00:18:32,639
What do you think?

247
00:18:32,723 --> 00:18:33,556
You explain to him.

248
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:34,431
He's talking nonsense.

249
00:18:34,806 --> 00:18:35,556
Take him with you, Jana.

250
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:36,764
This is not about any girl.

251
00:18:37,181 --> 00:18:37,931
Let's go, Bittu.

252
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:39,556
Go on.

253
00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:40,264
Come soon.

254
00:18:40,348 --> 00:18:41,306
You too.
- Come on.

255
00:18:41,389 --> 00:18:41,764
I'm coming.

256
00:18:41,848 --> 00:18:42,389
Not you too.

257
00:18:42,806 --> 00:18:43,389
Jana.

258
00:18:43,842 --> 00:18:44,473
Go on.

259
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:45,514
Why did you say yes?

260
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:27,931
Hi.

261
00:19:28,514 --> 00:19:29,389
Hi.

262
00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:31,098
Hello.

263
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:32,389
I thought you didn't understand.

264
00:19:32,598 --> 00:19:37,264
No, I understood,
but it takes me a little time to...

265
00:19:38,014 --> 00:19:39,931
I mean I've very
little experience in...

266
00:19:40,014 --> 00:19:41,514
I...I...

267
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,639
- Do you have a problem in speaking?
- No. Why?

268
00:19:45,723 --> 00:19:47,389
Because if you do, it can be treated.

269
00:19:47,473 --> 00:19:50,098
No, no, I can speak pretty well.

270
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:55,514
Peacock.

271
00:19:55,764 --> 00:19:56,806
Peacock is our National bird.

272
00:19:56,889 --> 00:19:58,056
Peacock has a long and sharp beak.

273
00:19:58,139 --> 00:19:59,264
The Peacock is around 1.5 feet tall.

274
00:19:59,348 --> 00:20:00,139
The Peacock is a beautiful bird.

275
00:20:00,223 --> 00:20:01,764
The Peacock's feather has many colors.

276
00:20:01,931 --> 00:20:03,723
Some people believe when the female
peacock drinks the male peacock's tear...

277
00:20:03,806 --> 00:20:04,851
...then a baby peacock is born.

278
00:20:04,931 --> 00:20:06,098
When the Peacock dances
during the monsoons...

279
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:07,389
...people are enchanted
to see the sight.

280
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:08,723
Just like I was
enchanted when I saw you...

281
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:13,389
Sorry.

282
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,306
By the way,
you're looking really nice tonight.

283
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:20,931
Even you're looking...alright.

284
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:23,098
Thank you.

285
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,893
- You're late. The veneration is over.
- Is it?

286
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:28,889
Yes.

287
00:20:29,056 --> 00:20:30,264
I didn't realize I was late.

288
00:20:30,723 --> 00:20:32,973
It's the ambiance.

289
00:20:35,056 --> 00:20:37,139
But I will inform you before
the veneration starts tomorrow.

290
00:20:37,431 --> 00:20:38,056
I will call you.

291
00:20:38,297 --> 00:20:39,848
Store your number on this.

292
00:20:40,264 --> 00:20:41,389
I don't carry a mobile.

293
00:20:41,764 --> 00:20:42,473
You don't.

294
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,056
Okay.

295
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:50,473
So if I...or anyone else wants
to talk to you, or call you...

296
00:20:50,556 --> 00:20:51,431
...then how to do that?

297
00:20:51,973 --> 00:20:53,306
I don't know about others, but...

298
00:20:54,681 --> 00:20:56,889
...if you want to talk, then...

299
00:20:58,306 --> 00:20:58,973
Then?

300
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:03,598
Just think about me.
And I'll come over.

301
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:06,681
Fine, I will do that.

302
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:11,014
Letter.

303
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:13,056
"To Vicky."

304
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:14,056
For me?

305
00:21:15,014 --> 00:21:15,556
No.

306
00:21:16,014 --> 00:21:17,514
Read it tomorrow morning,
after you've freshened up.

307
00:21:18,848 --> 00:21:19,681
After...

308
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:22,598
Okay.

309
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:23,848
Thank you.

310
00:21:28,514 --> 00:21:30,473
By the way, it's quite late, isn't it?

311
00:21:31,348 --> 00:21:32,723
It's dark everywhere.

312
00:21:33,431 --> 00:21:35,264
I wait for this darkness.

313
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:40,723
Okay...

314
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:46,973
FIRST NIGHT

315
00:21:49,223 --> 00:21:51,931
What's the point of owning
a bike if you can't afford fuel?

316
00:21:52,389 --> 00:21:53,931
Do you have a problem with petrol?

317
00:21:54,139 --> 00:21:55,973
It's always getting over.

318
00:21:56,056 --> 00:21:56,931
Forget the petrol.

319
00:21:57,014 --> 00:21:58,098
Think about Vicky.

320
00:21:58,348 --> 00:21:59,931
Stop fighting, Bittu.

321
00:22:00,681 --> 00:22:02,639
It was his good luck,
that he found a girl.

322
00:22:02,764 --> 00:22:03,973
But he could've introduced us as well.

323
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:04,806
Why isn't he introducing us to her?

324
00:22:05,098 --> 00:22:06,264
I think there is no
girl in the first place.

325
00:22:06,348 --> 00:22:07,723
And if there is one,
then there's something wrong with her.

326
00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:09,014
What was that sound?

327
00:22:09,306 --> 00:22:11,181
What sound?
I've been speaking all this time?

328
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:12,514
What sound did you hear?

329
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:14,431
There, I heard it again.

330
00:22:14,931 --> 00:22:15,639
What?

331
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:18,806
- Brother Rudra.
- Hello.

332
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:19,723
Hello, brother Rudra.

333
00:22:19,931 --> 00:22:21,973
- Are you two in your right mind?
- Yes, we are.

334
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:24,306
- Where are you two going at this hour?
- Why?

335
00:22:24,514 --> 00:22:25,223
What happened?

336
00:22:25,514 --> 00:22:26,723
The festival has begun.

337
00:22:27,348 --> 00:22:29,514
She will be out
hunting for the next four days.

338
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:30,514
Who?

339
00:22:32,556 --> 00:22:33,181
She.

340
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:37,098
Stree.

341
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,514
Stop scaring him, brother Rudra.

342
00:22:40,598 --> 00:22:42,514
I am not scaring him,
just warning you.

343
00:22:44,056 --> 00:22:47,848
Look, our city is the
only place in this world...

344
00:22:48,098 --> 00:22:52,848
...where no male steps out alone
during these days of the festival.

345
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:57,598
She abducts male,
leaving only his clothes behind.

346
00:22:57,973 --> 00:22:58,764
Only his clothes.

347
00:23:00,056 --> 00:23:02,098
It's just that I like you two,
you two are like family...

348
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:04,389
...that's why I was telling you,
otherwise...

349
00:23:04,473 --> 00:23:06,806
Brother Rudra, please tell us.

350
00:23:08,056 --> 00:23:09,014
Form a triangle. Form a triangle.

351
00:23:09,098 --> 00:23:09,639
Come here.

352
00:23:12,348 --> 00:23:13,056
What is that?

353
00:23:13,181 --> 00:23:13,973
Beer.

354
00:23:14,098 --> 00:23:15,431
All right. I have mine.

355
00:23:20,056 --> 00:23:20,764
Yes.

356
00:23:23,514 --> 00:23:27,223
There are certain rules
to escape the wrath of Stree.

357
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:29,931
Rule no. 1.

358
00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:36,306
Under no circumstances, and I mean
none... don't step out of the house alone.

359
00:23:37,556 --> 00:23:42,973
And only those men are safe, who have
written outside their home, O Stree...

360
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:44,139
...Come tomorrow.

361
00:23:44,806 --> 00:23:46,056
Rule no. 2.

362
00:23:47,389 --> 00:23:52,473
If in case you've to step out, then don't
try to be a lion, be a wolf instead.

363
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,764
- Wolf?
- Why?

364
00:23:53,848 --> 00:23:57,139
- Travel in packs, not alone.
- I see.

365
00:23:57,348 --> 00:23:58,723
Rule no. 3.

366
00:23:59,514 --> 00:24:03,014
If you ever come across the Stree...

367
00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:06,056
...then she will first
call out your name.

368
00:24:07,223 --> 00:24:08,806
Hello, Tom-Dick-Harry.

369
00:24:09,806 --> 00:24:10,931
What do you do?

370
00:24:11,848 --> 00:24:13,889
Take off your slippers,
hold it in your hand, and...

371
00:24:14,014 --> 00:24:15,098
- Run!
- No!

372
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:18,473
No running.

373
00:24:19,723 --> 00:24:20,931
Keep walking.

374
00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:22,181
Do what?

375
00:24:22,556 --> 00:24:23,931
Keep walking.

376
00:24:24,389 --> 00:24:26,098
Then she will call out to you again.

377
00:24:26,514 --> 00:24:27,931
This time with more passion.

378
00:24:28,098 --> 00:24:29,598
And what do you do?

379
00:24:29,764 --> 00:24:30,806
Keep walking.

380
00:24:30,931 --> 00:24:32,306
Then she will call out to you again,
for the third time.

381
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:34,014
With an enchanting, alluring voice.

382
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:35,389
Like an angel.

383
00:24:36,386 --> 00:24:42,931
"Embrace me now... because this
night may not come again."

384
00:24:43,223 --> 00:24:45,139
That's the kind of
emotions you'll feel.

385
00:24:45,598 --> 00:24:47,973
Your breathing will get faster,
your heart will start pounding.

386
00:24:48,056 --> 00:24:50,389
Bedroom. Bedroom. Bedroom
will be the only thing on your mind.

387
00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:51,973
And what do you do?

388
00:24:52,056 --> 00:24:53,848
- Keep walking.
- No.

389
00:24:56,019 --> 00:25:01,144
No man could ever resist the Stree
when she calls out for the third time.

390
00:25:02,186 --> 00:25:05,061
You will start losing
control over yourself.

391
00:25:05,686 --> 00:25:07,061
And as soon as you turn around...

392
00:25:09,394 --> 00:25:10,144
Gone!

393
00:25:13,228 --> 00:25:15,894
But brother Rudra,
there must be some way.

394
00:25:16,103 --> 00:25:16,853
Yes.

395
00:25:17,436 --> 00:25:19,144
Rule no. 4.

396
00:25:20,068 --> 00:25:23,728
And the most important thing to
remember if you want to escape the Stree.

397
00:25:24,186 --> 00:25:25,728
At any point...

398
00:25:28,353 --> 00:25:29,103
Yes, Shama.

399
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:30,561
What?

400
00:25:30,811 --> 00:25:32,519
You're coming into my life.

401
00:25:32,936 --> 00:25:34,228
I am coming right over.

402
00:25:34,711 --> 00:25:36,711
Brother Rudra.

403
00:25:36,795 --> 00:25:39,795
You didn't finish the 4th rule.

404
00:25:44,565 --> 00:25:49,481
Keep walking!
Keep walking! Keep walking!

405
00:25:49,731 --> 00:25:50,940
Don't make a noise.

406
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:57,648
Keep walking!
Keep walking! Keep walking!

407
00:26:00,981 --> 00:26:02,690
- Wait a minute.
- No!

408
00:26:02,773 --> 00:26:05,523
Keep walking!
Keep walking!

409
00:26:26,731 --> 00:26:27,481
Bittu.

410
00:26:29,898 --> 00:26:30,856
Jana, look.

411
00:26:31,732 --> 00:26:32,148
What?

412
00:26:32,231 --> 00:26:32,898
Someone's out there.

413
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,898
Bittu. Wait.

414
00:26:51,148 --> 00:26:52,106
Stop.

415
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:55,356
Bittu.

416
00:26:55,898 --> 00:26:57,315
Stop Bittu, for your mother's sake.

417
00:26:59,315 --> 00:27:01,565
- Why are you running?
- Because you're running.

418
00:27:02,815 --> 00:27:04,106
Come on.
- Come.

419
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,315
What was that?
- I haven't the slightest clue.

420
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,773
Don't tell Vicky anything.
or he'll make fun of us.

421
00:27:09,148 --> 00:27:10,773
Do you understand or not?

422
00:27:10,856 --> 00:27:12,106
Do you understand?

423
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,648
Where were you two?

424
00:27:15,648 --> 00:27:16,481
What happened?

425
00:27:16,773 --> 00:27:17,690
- Huh!
- Nothing.

426
00:27:18,356 --> 00:27:18,856
What...

427
00:27:31,731 --> 00:27:33,106
"Oh, my silly beloved..."

428
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,065
"...snap out of your illusion."

429
00:27:35,148 --> 00:27:36,606
"Stop being afraid."

430
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,106
"Stop making gestures
from a distance."

431
00:27:41,648 --> 00:27:43,690
"Open the door to
your heart wide apart..."

432
00:27:43,773 --> 00:27:44,856
"...and say it out loud."

433
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,440
"Don't be scared."

434
00:27:46,606 --> 00:27:48,773
"Tell me what's your
plan for tonight."

435
00:27:50,773 --> 00:27:53,481
"I want to be struck by lightning."

436
00:27:53,565 --> 00:27:55,568
"Start a fire in my heart."

437
00:27:55,648 --> 00:28:02,023
"If you come with us, baby and..."

438
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,523
"Shake your hips..."

439
00:28:04,648 --> 00:28:05,856
"Shake it... Shake it... "

440
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,065
"Shake it... Shake it... "

441
00:28:07,148 --> 00:28:09,273
"Cross your eyes...with us."

442
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:10,773
"Cross your eyes..."

443
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,065
"Cross your eyes...with us."

444
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,190
"Shake your hips..."

445
00:28:14,273 --> 00:28:15,731
"Shake it... Shake it... "

446
00:28:15,815 --> 00:28:17,023
"Shake it... Shake it... "

447
00:28:17,106 --> 00:28:19,440
"Cross your eyes..."

448
00:28:19,523 --> 00:28:20,690
"Cross your eyes...with us."

449
00:28:20,773 --> 00:28:21,981
"Cross your eyes..."

450
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:26,023
"Take my heart, sweetheart..."

451
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:28,190
"Take my life..."

452
00:28:28,648 --> 00:28:30,315
"But just..."

453
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:33,440
"Just...shake your hips for me."

454
00:28:33,606 --> 00:28:35,815
"Take my heart, sweetheart..."

455
00:28:36,065 --> 00:28:38,190
"Take my life..."

456
00:28:38,565 --> 00:28:40,065
"But just..."

457
00:28:40,273 --> 00:28:44,231
"Just...shake your hips for me."

458
00:28:44,315 --> 00:28:45,481
"Shake it... Shake it... "

459
00:28:45,565 --> 00:28:46,690
"Shake it... Shake it... "

460
00:28:46,773 --> 00:28:49,148
"Cross your eyes..."

461
00:28:49,231 --> 00:28:51,651
"Cross your eyes...with us."

462
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:52,981
"Cross your eyes..."

463
00:29:02,815 --> 00:29:04,023
"These beautiful sights..."

464
00:29:04,106 --> 00:29:05,231
"The stars in the sky..."

465
00:29:05,315 --> 00:29:06,481
"...the season of spring
that's arrived..."

466
00:29:06,565 --> 00:29:08,106
"...its all for you my love."

467
00:29:08,273 --> 00:29:09,273
"My love..."

468
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,190
"...and my joys..."

469
00:29:10,273 --> 00:29:13,106
"Take anything you want, sweetheart."

470
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,315
"These beautiful sights..."

471
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:15,565
"The stars in the sky..."

472
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,648
"...the season of spring
that's arrived..."

473
00:29:16,731 --> 00:29:18,065
"...is all for you my love."

474
00:29:18,148 --> 00:29:19,148
"My love..."

475
00:29:19,231 --> 00:29:20,398
"...and my joys..."

476
00:29:20,606 --> 00:29:22,568
"Take anything you want, sweetheart."

477
00:29:22,648 --> 00:29:24,940
"I want to be struck by lightning."

478
00:29:25,106 --> 00:29:27,190
"Start a fire in my heart."

479
00:29:27,273 --> 00:29:32,981
"If you come with us, baby and..."

480
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:36,148
"Shake your hips..."

481
00:29:36,231 --> 00:29:37,440
"Shake it... Shake it... "

482
00:29:37,523 --> 00:29:38,648
"Shake it... Shake it... "

483
00:29:38,731 --> 00:29:41,065
"Cross your eyes..."

484
00:29:41,148 --> 00:29:42,356
"Cross your eyes...with us."

485
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,606
"Cross your eyes..."

486
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:46,065
"Shake your hips..."

487
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,481
"Shake it... Shake it... "

488
00:29:48,648 --> 00:29:50,940
"Cross your eyes...with us."

489
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:53,481
"Cross your eyes...with us."

490
00:29:53,606 --> 00:29:55,981
"Shake your hips..."

491
00:29:56,065 --> 00:29:57,190
"Shake it... Shake it... "

492
00:29:57,273 --> 00:29:58,440
"Shake it... Shake it... "

493
00:29:58,565 --> 00:30:00,856
"Cross your eyes...with us."

494
00:30:00,981 --> 00:30:02,106
"Cross your eyes...with us."

495
00:30:02,231 --> 00:30:03,440
"Cross your eyes...with us."

496
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:04,398
Bye.

497
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,356
"Cross your eyes...with us."

498
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:18,356
"Shake your hips..."

499
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,648
"Shake it... Shake it... "

500
00:30:20,815 --> 00:30:24,148
"Cross your eyes...with us."

501
00:30:28,496 --> 00:30:31,648
"Shake it... Shake it... "

502
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:42,898
"Shake it... Shake it... "

503
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,148
Go on.

504
00:31:04,273 --> 00:31:05,940
Go.

505
00:31:41,023 --> 00:31:42,606
Come on. Come in.

506
00:31:43,082 --> 00:31:44,565
She's my girlfriend.

507
00:31:45,356 --> 00:31:47,065
I called her over for 'friendship'!

508
00:31:50,898 --> 00:31:51,481
Come in.

509
00:31:51,724 --> 00:31:53,273
This kind of 'Friendship'
isn't allowed in here.

510
00:31:53,606 --> 00:31:55,148
Wasn't it enough
that we called a dancer?

511
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,065
Uncle will never approve of this.

512
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:59,356
Just go out and start
the generator, okay.

513
00:31:59,481 --> 00:32:01,231
Why didn't you inform me before that
there are going to be more people?

514
00:32:01,315 --> 00:32:02,565
Don't worry, darling.

515
00:32:02,742 --> 00:32:04,898
I've already reserved
a room for us upstairs.

516
00:32:05,094 --> 00:32:05,731
No one's going to disturb us.

517
00:32:05,815 --> 00:32:07,815
Just you and me. Me and you.

518
00:32:07,898 --> 00:32:09,674
All alone in a room.

519
00:32:09,815 --> 00:32:12,106
Well, if I had known, I would've
brought my friends along too.

520
00:32:12,315 --> 00:32:14,273
And even your friends could've
snuggled up with them in a room.

521
00:32:14,648 --> 00:32:15,720
Naughty.

522
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,773
Go upstairs.

523
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,690
Narender. Narender. Narender

524
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,565
"Shake it... Shake it... "

525
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:42,648
Come on.

526
00:32:43,231 --> 00:32:46,315
- Are you carrying protection?
- Protection?

527
00:32:46,606 --> 00:32:48,315
No protection, no friendship.

528
00:32:48,648 --> 00:32:50,606
Oh... protection.

529
00:32:51,023 --> 00:32:54,773
"Shake it... Shake it... "

530
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:17,567
Hello. Who is it?

531
00:33:25,356 --> 00:33:28,648
Jana. Are you carrying protection?

532
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:30,648
Protection.

533
00:33:31,231 --> 00:33:32,398
No, I don't carry one.

534
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:34,315
Let's ask one of the guys.

535
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:38,023
Guys... is anyone carrying protection?

536
00:33:39,065 --> 00:33:40,440
Come on, quickly.

537
00:33:41,356 --> 00:33:41,940
Hurry up.

538
00:33:59,981 --> 00:34:02,690
Lights back. Lights back. Lights back.

539
00:34:02,773 --> 00:34:04,398
I got the stuff.

540
00:34:04,981 --> 00:34:06,648
Why have you turned off the lights?

541
00:34:06,773 --> 00:34:09,648
I like the lights on.
Because now I've protection.

542
00:34:11,084 --> 00:34:12,814
This thing is older
than my grandfather.

543
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,773
Such a cheap quality.

544
00:34:16,065 --> 00:34:16,856
Yes.

545
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,981
Narender.

546
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,065
- What happened?
- There...

547
00:34:28,148 --> 00:34:28,898
What?

548
00:34:28,981 --> 00:34:29,940
Outside the window.

549
00:34:30,023 --> 00:34:30,690
What?

550
00:34:30,773 --> 00:34:32,815
Someone dragged him out of the window.

551
00:34:32,898 --> 00:34:33,568
Narender.

552
00:34:33,648 --> 00:34:37,731
I came into the room and
someone dragged him outside.

553
00:34:37,815 --> 00:34:38,481
Stay here.

554
00:34:38,565 --> 00:34:39,273
You go check.

555
00:34:39,606 --> 00:34:40,606
Narender.

556
00:34:40,856 --> 00:34:42,356
Narender.

557
00:34:45,898 --> 00:34:46,648
Clothes.

558
00:34:47,273 --> 00:34:48,106
Clothes?

559
00:34:48,981 --> 00:34:50,190
Narender's clothes.

560
00:34:51,773 --> 00:34:53,315
Narender's clothes.

561
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:54,356
Only his clothes.

562
00:34:54,773 --> 00:34:55,731
Stree took him.

563
00:34:57,356 --> 00:34:58,648
This is Stree's doing.

564
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:02,481
Whenever she takes any man with her,
she leaves his clothes behind.

565
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:12,231
But I don't understand one thing?
How did Stree come inside?

566
00:35:12,315 --> 00:35:13,065
I don't know.

567
00:35:13,398 --> 00:35:15,565
I wrote "O Stree come
tomorrow" on the wall...

568
00:35:15,648 --> 00:35:16,898
...so that we can party peacefully.

569
00:35:19,023 --> 00:35:20,231
Someone erased it.

570
00:35:20,683 --> 00:35:24,731
I think that someone
intentionally erased it.

571
00:35:24,918 --> 00:35:26,440
Who peed on the wall?

572
00:35:26,986 --> 00:35:27,731
Who was it?

573
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:28,981
Who was it?

574
00:35:29,648 --> 00:35:30,690
Speak up now.

575
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:35,523
- Vicky?
- You did it.

576
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:36,856
No, it wasn't me.

577
00:35:37,273 --> 00:35:39,481
Oh really? Then who did this?

578
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:43,106
Right... you went out
in the middle of the dance.

579
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,690
You peed on the wall.

580
00:35:44,815 --> 00:35:46,106
Yes, I did.

581
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,398
It didn't say no peeing here.

582
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:47,981
Get lost.

583
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:50,606
Why did you have to pee
there of all the places?

584
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:53,981
My pee, my will,
I can pee anywhere I want.

585
00:35:54,065 --> 00:35:56,398
We lost a friend because of you.

586
00:35:56,481 --> 00:35:57,273
He's a junkie.

587
00:35:57,356 --> 00:35:58,648
He must be high and wandering around.

588
00:35:58,731 --> 00:36:00,523
We won't hear anything
against our friend.

589
00:36:00,606 --> 00:36:03,190
- You made him disappear.
- I didn't do anything.

590
00:36:03,273 --> 00:36:06,106
You made him disappear.
You peed on the wall.

591
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:07,773
Just a second.

592
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,023
Stop! Stop! Stop, guys! Stop!

593
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,773
What's the point of beating up Jana?

594
00:36:16,898 --> 00:36:19,356
Your friend's missing,
go look for him.

595
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:20,981
Stop ranting Stree.

596
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,898
It's pretty late.

597
00:36:35,481 --> 00:36:37,398
Daddy must be waiting for me.

598
00:36:37,813 --> 00:36:39,648
Even I didn't tell my
mom that I'm coming here.

599
00:36:41,398 --> 00:36:43,898
Fine, let's come back tomorrow.

600
00:37:00,356 --> 00:37:01,690
Letter.

601
00:37:04,398 --> 00:37:05,501
Here's the letter.

602
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,981
Brother, some madam's here to see you.

603
00:37:16,106 --> 00:37:16,481
Who is it?

604
00:37:16,565 --> 00:37:17,231
Tell her to come back later.

605
00:37:17,315 --> 00:37:18,273
It's her.

606
00:37:19,315 --> 00:37:20,523
Take a look for yourself.

607
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:25,550
What the...

608
00:37:26,675 --> 00:37:28,675
- Did you tell her that I am at home?
- I did, brother?

609
00:37:33,092 --> 00:37:34,092
Come here.

610
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,592
What are you doing here?

611
00:37:36,717 --> 00:37:38,634
- I want my money.
- What money?

612
00:37:38,925 --> 00:37:40,717
Money for the 'friendship'.

613
00:37:41,558 --> 00:37:43,259
Your friend didn't pay
me for the 'friendship'.

614
00:37:43,557 --> 00:37:44,092
So?

615
00:37:44,172 --> 00:37:45,092
So you're going to pay me.

616
00:37:45,175 --> 00:37:46,217
Why will I pay?

617
00:37:46,925 --> 00:37:50,509
I see... you pee on the
wall and I won't get my money.

618
00:37:50,664 --> 00:37:52,550
Has the government
put a ban on my pee?

619
00:37:53,009 --> 00:37:54,759
I can pee anywhere I want.

620
00:37:54,925 --> 00:37:55,759
Pay up quietly.

621
00:37:56,717 --> 00:37:59,092
I heard that the
friendship never happen.

622
00:37:59,617 --> 00:38:01,592
We were halfway through...

623
00:38:02,523 --> 00:38:04,675
Please sister,
I don't have that kind of money.

624
00:38:04,759 --> 00:38:05,634
I don't have money...

625
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,634
Look here, stop making excuses...

626
00:38:07,717 --> 00:38:10,342
...otherwise, I will come down
here with my friends and make a scene.

627
00:38:10,425 --> 00:38:11,550
Calm down.

628
00:38:12,009 --> 00:38:14,134
And, your father won't like it.

629
00:38:14,217 --> 00:38:15,300
I have heard a lot about him.

630
00:38:15,384 --> 00:38:17,134
How much do I pay, sister?

631
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:20,092
She's collecting donation.

632
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:23,967
I think 3000 will be fine.

633
00:38:25,634 --> 00:38:26,550
Take some lessons from him.

634
00:38:26,634 --> 00:38:27,342
Jai Mata Di.

635
00:38:34,175 --> 00:38:37,842
So mister, are you going to stand
around like this or put something on.

636
00:38:42,842 --> 00:38:44,717
Take care of your son.

637
00:38:45,425 --> 00:38:46,592
He's bustling with energy.

638
00:38:51,634 --> 00:38:56,675
Son, I'm going to share a
really important experience of life.

639
00:38:57,509 --> 00:39:01,967
Youth... is a weird phase.

640
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:06,800
The body bustles with vitality.

641
00:39:06,884 --> 00:39:08,759
A tank full of energy.

642
00:39:09,717 --> 00:39:15,009
And this energy... craves to come out.

643
00:39:15,217 --> 00:39:19,217
But this body... is puzzled
about what to do or not to do.

644
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,842
And this restlessness...

645
00:39:23,009 --> 00:39:27,384
...provokes it to have
friendship with the opposite sex.

646
00:39:27,634 --> 00:39:29,842
Dad, I hope you know
what friendship means here.

647
00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:31,592
Friendship.

648
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:36,300
Son, I was born in
this town before you.

649
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,800
I've had a lot of friendship
back in my days.

650
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,509
- You had friendships.
- I did.

651
00:39:42,217 --> 00:39:46,842
Yes, but once I met your mother...

652
00:39:47,425 --> 00:39:50,050
...she completely changed
my point of view.

653
00:39:50,509 --> 00:39:52,467
The union of a male and a female...

654
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,300
- Listen to me.
- Go on.

655
00:39:54,384 --> 00:39:58,134
The union of a male
and a female is pure.

656
00:39:58,217 --> 00:39:59,509
It's auspicious.

657
00:39:59,675 --> 00:40:02,425
Like the union of Heaven and Earth.

658
00:40:02,505 --> 00:40:05,509
The confluence of Shiv and Shakti.

659
00:40:05,592 --> 00:40:08,259
But why are you telling me all this?

660
00:40:08,717 --> 00:40:11,967
I telling you so that
you don't pay for friendship.

661
00:40:12,134 --> 00:40:13,800
When did I pay for friendship?

662
00:40:14,509 --> 00:40:19,092
- And what about her...
- Dad, she wasn't here for me.

663
00:40:19,259 --> 00:40:20,134
I didn't pay for friendship.

664
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:22,509
Listen to me first.

665
00:40:23,634 --> 00:40:28,134
My advice to you is that you must
wait for a companion...

666
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:33,175
...with whom you can enjoy this
process for the rest of your life.

667
00:40:33,259 --> 00:40:37,884
And learn to control this energy
bustling in your body till then.

668
00:40:38,634 --> 00:40:42,842
And if you can't, then...

669
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:44,759
Then what?

670
00:40:45,425 --> 00:40:46,800
Then be self-reliant.

671
00:40:48,259 --> 00:40:49,092
Cater to your needs.

672
00:40:49,175 --> 00:40:50,384
Meaning...

673
00:40:50,842 --> 00:40:53,425
Meaning... yourself.

674
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:54,717
How, daddy?

675
00:40:54,925 --> 00:40:55,800
I mean...

676
00:40:57,384 --> 00:40:57,884
I mean...

677
00:40:57,967 --> 00:40:58,717
Loss of words?

678
00:40:59,009 --> 00:40:59,842
Come on. Go out.

679
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:01,592
Listen...

680
00:41:01,675 --> 00:41:03,217
Come on. Go out.

681
00:41:07,717 --> 00:41:08,800
Energy.

682
00:41:12,842 --> 00:41:14,425
Where is my energy?

683
00:41:20,925 --> 00:41:21,842
My dear Vicky.

684
00:41:23,175 --> 00:41:27,050
If she's started with 'my dear'
then she will end it with 'with love'.

685
00:41:27,134 --> 00:41:27,717
Okay.

686
00:41:27,925 --> 00:41:29,259
My dear Vicky, how are you?

687
00:41:29,842 --> 00:41:30,967
What a stupid question?

688
00:41:31,467 --> 00:41:33,134
She just met yesterday and
today she wants to know how you are.

689
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:33,884
Keep reading.

690
00:41:34,217 --> 00:41:39,425
Honestly speaking I was
really happy to meet you.

691
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:47,592
After talking to you I felt like that
we've known each other for a long time.

692
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:51,634
Since I retreated...

693
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:52,634
Returned.

694
00:41:53,634 --> 00:41:54,800
Sorry, since I returned
after meeting you...

695
00:41:55,092 --> 00:41:56,925
...I want to meet you again.

696
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,342
And this time when we meet,
my dear Vicky...

697
00:42:00,675 --> 00:42:03,925
...can you bring these things for me?

698
00:42:04,092 --> 00:42:04,967
PTO.

699
00:42:06,925 --> 00:42:08,175
A quarter brandy.

700
00:42:08,509 --> 00:42:09,759
Half a kilo of mutton.

701
00:42:10,259 --> 00:42:12,092
A kilo of charred glass.

702
00:42:12,675 --> 00:42:13,592
Thornapple flower.

703
00:42:13,675 --> 00:42:15,509
Hair of a cat.

704
00:42:15,717 --> 00:42:17,009
- And...
- And?

705
00:42:17,925 --> 00:42:19,717
The tail of a lizard!

706
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,842
Thanking you, with love.

707
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,259
With love. See...

708
00:42:23,634 --> 00:42:25,509
What is this stupid stuff?

709
00:42:26,217 --> 00:42:28,300
Who asks to get stuff like these?

710
00:42:28,676 --> 00:42:29,637
Plus she drinks.

711
00:42:29,717 --> 00:42:30,717
So what if she drinks?

712
00:42:30,925 --> 00:42:31,884
Sister-in-law is cool.

713
00:42:32,092 --> 00:42:33,217
That's not the point.

714
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,967
She wants you to get
the tail of a lizard.

715
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:39,092
And you're a tailor,
not the ancestor of lizards.

716
00:42:39,352 --> 00:42:42,217
You're prepared to go on this impossible
mission because she told you.

717
00:42:42,384 --> 00:42:44,300
Jana has been telling
to you to stitch a shirt for him.

718
00:42:44,384 --> 00:42:44,967
But did you?

719
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:46,467
I have been telling
you to let's go to Goa.

720
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,259
But did you?

721
00:42:47,675 --> 00:42:49,300
Trying to be a hero for the girl.

722
00:42:51,467 --> 00:42:52,634
You say something.

723
00:42:53,467 --> 00:42:54,384
What now?

724
00:42:54,759 --> 00:42:56,800
- She's asked so politely...
- So?

725
00:42:57,259 --> 00:42:58,175
Then I must get it.

726
00:42:59,050 --> 00:42:59,842
What?

727
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,967
It's very simple.

728
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,759
Guys always do what
girls tell them to.

729
00:43:03,884 --> 00:43:04,384
That's it.

730
00:43:36,369 --> 00:43:38,300
Shahjahan built the
Taj Mahal for his love.

731
00:43:39,967 --> 00:43:41,675
And our brother
chasing cats and lizards.

732
00:43:42,509 --> 00:43:45,342
Whoever imagined love would
fall to such levels in 500 years.

733
00:43:47,384 --> 00:43:49,675
Tell me something, don't
you think something is wrong?

734
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:53,092
Right and wrong is just
a point of view, Bittu.

735
00:43:53,175 --> 00:43:54,800
Don't try to be wise.

736
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:59,550
I am telling you,
I have a bad feeling about this.

737
00:44:00,717 --> 00:44:01,800
Something is wrong about this girl?

738
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:04,467
Got it. Got it. Got it.

739
00:44:04,717 --> 00:44:06,009
Got it.

740
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:22,533
Come on, now hurry up.

741
00:44:22,783 --> 00:44:24,242
That Stree already
took one male last night.

742
00:44:24,993 --> 00:44:27,033
We must return home before
she comes out to hunt.

743
00:44:27,825 --> 00:44:28,700
I am going as fast as I can.

744
00:44:28,867 --> 00:44:29,992
Don't be scared.
I am with you.

745
00:44:30,075 --> 00:44:32,492
You can't handle one woman, and
now you're scared of another.

746
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:03,867
Hello.

747
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:05,533
Jana, meet me right now.

748
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,283
Vicky!

749
00:45:19,533 --> 00:45:20,158
Vicky!

750
00:45:20,825 --> 00:45:21,242
Hi.

751
00:45:22,325 --> 00:45:22,783
Hello.

752
00:45:23,341 --> 00:45:26,908
Sorry, I was too engrossed
in listening to music.

753
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:28,475
What do you listen to?

754
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:29,850
English.

755
00:45:30,475 --> 00:45:31,267
Wow!

756
00:45:32,017 --> 00:45:33,517
- Akon.
- Who?

757
00:45:34,225 --> 00:45:34,767
Akon.

758
00:45:36,725 --> 00:45:39,017
"Wanna be my Chammak Challo."

759
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:42,100
The guy's like Kumar
Sanu of his country.

760
00:45:42,392 --> 00:45:42,975
I see.

761
00:45:43,059 --> 00:45:44,475
- You don't know?
- No.

762
00:45:45,193 --> 00:45:45,809
I see.

763
00:45:47,267 --> 00:45:49,225
You missed the veneration again.

764
00:45:49,309 --> 00:45:51,392
I guess I don't get
along with God too well.

765
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:53,267
Right. Right.

766
00:45:55,142 --> 00:45:56,142
I...

767
00:45:56,559 --> 00:45:58,309
I brought this offering for you.

768
00:45:59,225 --> 00:46:00,350
I'm fasting today.

769
00:46:01,642 --> 00:46:02,809
Even offerings are not allowed.

770
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:05,267
I see.

771
00:46:06,142 --> 00:46:06,600
Doesn't matter.

772
00:46:06,684 --> 00:46:07,934
Whether you eat it or me,
it's the same.

773
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,184
By the way, we can go inside.

774
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:12,892
I know the priest.

775
00:46:13,309 --> 00:46:15,434
I can arrange for a
special veneration for you.

776
00:46:16,122 --> 00:46:18,142
And even make a donation
of 11 rupees in your name.

777
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:20,975
- Your name...
- Did you get the items on the list?

778
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:22,934
Yes.

779
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:25,434
I got everything you asked for.

780
00:46:25,809 --> 00:46:28,934
You didn't tell me which brand
of brandy, so I got every brand.

781
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:32,767
But it's better this way.
You can try every brand, for variety.

782
00:46:32,975 --> 00:46:35,309
And, I couldn't find a
cat with completely white hair.

783
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:36,892
She had mixed colors.

784
00:46:36,975 --> 00:46:38,850
But what will you
do with all these things?

785
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:42,850
Are you going to ask
everything right now?

786
00:46:46,684 --> 00:46:47,809
Let's go someplace else.

787
00:46:49,617 --> 00:46:51,934
- At this hour?
- Yes.

788
00:46:53,434 --> 00:46:54,267
Okay.

789
00:46:55,059 --> 00:46:56,434
But where?

790
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,725
Let's go. I know a spot.

791
00:47:12,934 --> 00:47:15,059
"Fair...you're so fair."

792
00:47:15,392 --> 00:47:17,975
"Like the moonlight that's
falling on earth."

793
00:47:18,475 --> 00:47:20,559
"Bad... very bad."

794
00:47:20,975 --> 00:47:23,142
"The world's intentions are very bad."

795
00:47:23,225 --> 00:47:25,850
"I hope no one casts
an evil eye on you..."

796
00:47:25,934 --> 00:47:28,517
"...this thought keeps
scaring me all day."

797
00:47:28,684 --> 00:47:31,309
"I hope no one casts
an evil eye on you..."

798
00:47:31,389 --> 00:47:35,059
"...this thought keeps
scaring me all day."

799
00:47:45,392 --> 00:47:51,184
"This silky dress...that
you've worn tonight."

800
00:47:51,309 --> 00:47:56,229
"When you smile...all
my sorrows get alleviated."

801
00:47:56,309 --> 00:47:59,017
"I hope no one casts
an evil eye on you..."

802
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,725
"...this thought keeps
scaring me all day."

803
00:48:01,809 --> 00:48:04,475
"I hope no one casts
an evil eye on you..."

804
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:07,309
"...this thought keeps
scaring me all day."

805
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:16,350
- Vicky's gone tonight.
- Where?

806
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,059
Focus on my meaning.

807
00:48:19,975 --> 00:48:21,475
I pondered over this a lot.

808
00:48:21,975 --> 00:48:24,892
And the verdict I've
reached is pretty dangerous.

809
00:48:25,392 --> 00:48:26,517
What is your verdict?

810
00:48:26,872 --> 00:48:31,392
You were a genius at school,
then how are you so slow in real life?

811
00:48:31,934 --> 00:48:34,684
I go to the depth of every
matter and weigh it properly.

812
00:48:35,267 --> 00:48:36,725
My dear Pacific Ocean.

813
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:39,809
Why aren't your depths
showing you what I can see?

814
00:48:42,392 --> 00:48:43,309
This girl...

815
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,850
...comes once in
a year like an endangered species.

816
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:49,017
And always during the festival.

817
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,392
And do you know who else
shows up during the festival?

818
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,225
Who?

819
00:48:53,684 --> 00:48:54,350
Stree!

820
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:01,184
Mister, open your mind

821
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:04,725
Has anyone else seen
her except for Vicky?

822
00:49:05,434 --> 00:49:06,100
No.

823
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,725
And what does she ask him
to get in her first love letter?

824
00:49:11,392 --> 00:49:14,434
- Cat hair, lizard leg...
- Tail.

825
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:15,975
It's one and the same.

826
00:49:16,059 --> 00:49:17,267
Who asks to get stuff like this?

827
00:49:19,642 --> 00:49:20,350
He's not picking up.

828
00:49:20,434 --> 00:49:22,892
- Mister, turn off your phone.
- You shut your mouth.

829
00:49:22,975 --> 00:49:24,392
And fill fuel worth 50 rupees.

830
00:49:24,642 --> 00:49:25,309
50 again.

831
00:49:25,725 --> 00:49:27,100
Why don't you ever put more?

832
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:28,892
Why don't you try
telling my father that?

833
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,767
You try calling him.

834
00:49:34,142 --> 00:49:36,017
He's gone to meet her,
I am telling you.

835
00:49:36,632 --> 00:49:38,642
Our friend is in trouble, understand.

836
00:49:39,413 --> 00:49:40,725
Stree has laid a trap.

837
00:49:40,892 --> 00:49:44,267
And our love hungry friend,
is heading straight for it.

838
00:49:45,017 --> 00:49:46,225
He is actually cutting the calls.

839
00:49:47,225 --> 00:49:49,100
Why do people become blind in love?

840
00:49:49,254 --> 00:49:50,309
How would I know?

841
00:49:52,858 --> 00:49:54,517
You can be anyone you want,
but not a devotee.

842
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:57,600
Where do you think the new couple would
have gone to spend some time alone?

843
00:49:57,684 --> 00:49:58,350
The lake.

844
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:07,147
SECOND NIGHT

845
00:50:11,522 --> 00:50:13,147
How do you know about this place?

846
00:50:16,855 --> 00:50:18,855
And why did we come here?

847
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:22,897
Because it's dark out here.
And no one comes here.

848
00:50:27,522 --> 00:50:28,355
Dark.

849
00:50:32,397 --> 00:50:33,647
He isn't here either.

850
00:50:34,314 --> 00:50:35,189
Where could he be?

851
00:50:35,397 --> 00:50:37,814
I am telling you,
we'll only find his clothes today.

852
00:50:41,049 --> 00:50:42,314
Your clothes are very nice.

853
00:50:44,605 --> 00:50:45,647
Where did you buy them?

854
00:50:46,147 --> 00:50:47,605
I designed them myself.

855
00:50:48,189 --> 00:50:50,147
People call me the Manish
Malhotra of Chanderi.

856
00:50:52,897 --> 00:50:54,147
Isn't it too tight?

857
00:50:54,355 --> 00:50:55,689
It's just my body...

858
00:50:55,772 --> 00:50:56,980
How do you open it?

859
00:51:00,647 --> 00:51:01,855
- Listen.
- Yeah...

860
00:51:01,935 --> 00:51:03,855
- Shall we leave?
- Why?

861
00:51:04,272 --> 00:51:06,480
- Are you scared too?
- No.

862
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,314
I am not scared of
any ghosts or spirits.

863
00:51:08,605 --> 00:51:11,397
But how long are we going
to waste our time on a selfish guy?

864
00:51:11,689 --> 00:51:13,189
But he's our friend.

865
00:51:17,314 --> 00:51:18,105
Bittu.

866
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,314
Wait.

867
00:51:20,105 --> 00:51:22,147
So what else do you
stitch at your shop?

868
00:51:22,605 --> 00:51:25,064
Just skirts and long dresses,
or anything else?

869
00:51:25,605 --> 00:51:26,939
Actually, we make everything.

870
00:51:27,189 --> 00:51:28,189
Completely ladies fashion.

871
00:51:28,522 --> 00:51:31,772
Skirts, tops, traditional dresses,
tunics. Midis, minis.

872
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:36,689
Short dresses, long dresses,
kaftans, fringe, party dresses.

873
00:51:36,939 --> 00:51:43,772
Mirror work,
stonework, designer panty, nightfall.

874
00:51:44,689 --> 00:51:45,980
Nighty fall.

875
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,189
That's it.

876
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:51,230
When will you give me my dress?

877
00:51:51,855 --> 00:51:54,897
It completely slipped off my mind.

878
00:51:57,814 --> 00:52:01,397
- I troubled you a lot, didn't I?
- Of course not.

879
00:52:01,805 --> 00:52:03,064
It was no trouble at all.

880
00:52:03,314 --> 00:52:06,189
And anything for you.

881
00:52:10,855 --> 00:52:13,230
I should have taken
your measurements that day.

882
00:52:14,605 --> 00:52:16,314
I thought you did.

883
00:52:17,105 --> 00:52:21,980
Normally I am good at this,
but in your case, I goofed up.

884
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:30,272
So take it now.

885
00:52:31,272 --> 00:52:33,605
But I don't have my measuring tape.

886
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,647
Can't you take my
measurement without it?

887
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:38,564
I can, but...

888
00:52:39,397 --> 00:52:40,314
Should I?

889
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:41,522
Take it.

890
00:52:42,272 --> 00:52:42,980
Should I?

891
00:52:43,605 --> 00:52:44,564
Take it.

892
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,105
Okay, I will.

893
00:54:27,939 --> 00:54:28,772
Hello.

894
00:54:29,939 --> 00:54:30,772
Where are you?

895
00:54:30,855 --> 00:54:31,730
Hello.

896
00:54:40,564 --> 00:54:41,689
- Bittu.
- Yes.

897
00:54:41,772 --> 00:54:43,730
I am missing my mom.

898
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:46,939
Shall we go back?

899
00:54:47,939 --> 00:54:49,439
You're right.

900
00:54:50,397 --> 00:54:55,064
- Parents are more important than friends.
- You're right.

901
00:54:55,605 --> 00:54:56,897
Let's go back.

902
00:55:02,855 --> 00:55:03,605
What happened?

903
00:55:06,105 --> 00:55:07,272
Let me check.

904
00:55:15,522 --> 00:55:16,067
What?

905
00:55:16,147 --> 00:55:17,647
I think we're out of petrol.

906
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,189
I told you, didn't I?

907
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:23,022
Tell me one thing...is
your father a menial labor?

908
00:55:24,064 --> 00:55:25,105
You own a big shop in the city.

909
00:55:25,314 --> 00:55:27,647
From Manish Malhotra to Manish Behl.

910
00:55:27,772 --> 00:55:28,397
What is this?

911
00:55:29,147 --> 00:55:31,855
Whether you fill 50 rupees
petrol at a time or fill your tank.

912
00:55:32,147 --> 00:55:33,230
It's still the same.

913
00:55:33,314 --> 00:55:35,022
The petrol pump is close-by. Push.

914
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,980
It's your bike, isn't it?

915
00:55:37,105 --> 00:55:37,689
You push.

916
00:55:37,939 --> 00:55:38,814
Why should I?

917
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:40,397
I've been pushing
it since we were kids.

918
00:55:40,647 --> 00:55:41,564
What's wrong with you?

919
00:55:41,772 --> 00:55:43,064
That Stree is wandering
around the city.

920
00:55:43,314 --> 00:55:45,730
And we're stuck in
the middle of nowhere.

921
00:55:45,897 --> 00:55:47,189
And you want to know what's wrong?

922
00:55:47,647 --> 00:55:48,730
Mom clearly said that
I should come back soon.

923
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:52,897
If I don't hurry up,
she will lock the doors and sleep.

924
00:55:53,272 --> 00:55:53,772
What now?

925
00:55:54,522 --> 00:55:55,522
Push!

926
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:02,814
Mummy!

927
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:08,564
Hello.

928
00:56:13,189 --> 00:56:14,230
Where are you?

929
00:56:16,064 --> 00:56:17,230
Madam.

930
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:42,647
Where are you going?

931
00:56:43,814 --> 00:56:45,439
I knew it, selfish rascal.

932
00:56:45,522 --> 00:56:46,689
What's wrong with you today?

933
00:56:46,772 --> 00:56:48,480
I am your friend, not your slave.

934
00:56:48,647 --> 00:56:51,189
First I go over to your house so that you
can tuck yourself neatly under the blanket.

935
00:56:51,439 --> 00:56:53,897
- And then I go home all alone.
- But we do that all the time.

936
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:54,564
Not today.

937
00:56:54,647 --> 00:56:55,147
Fine, let it be.

938
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:56,230
I've been listening to
your nonsense for a long time.

939
00:56:56,314 --> 00:56:56,689
Go on.

940
00:56:56,772 --> 00:56:57,564
Fine, you don't have to.

941
00:56:57,772 --> 00:56:58,522
Get going.

942
00:56:58,772 --> 00:56:59,689
Weird guy.

943
00:57:00,564 --> 00:57:03,105
- I hope Stree abducts you.
- Same to you.

944
00:58:40,022 --> 00:58:40,772
Son!

945
00:58:41,147 --> 00:58:42,730
No...no...

946
00:59:02,189 --> 00:59:06,647
If you ever come across the Stree,
this is what you do.

947
00:59:13,814 --> 00:59:15,772
Jana

948
00:59:18,064 --> 00:59:18,980
No.

949
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,314
Don't turn around.

950
00:59:22,022 --> 00:59:23,397
Keep walking.

951
00:59:29,189 --> 00:59:31,439
Jana

952
00:59:42,814 --> 00:59:45,480
Jana

953
01:00:43,355 --> 01:00:46,480
No... No... No!

954
01:00:56,605 --> 01:00:58,855
Jana

955
01:00:59,904 --> 01:01:02,855
Jana. My Jana.

956
01:01:04,147 --> 01:01:05,855
Curse that Stree.

957
01:01:06,209 --> 01:01:09,605
My Jana never even touched any female.

958
01:01:10,147 --> 01:01:12,439
And now she must be
sitting on top on him.

959
01:01:13,176 --> 01:01:17,772
I told him a thousand times not to hang
around with these worthless friends.

960
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:20,980
Jana could've had a good job.

961
01:01:21,605 --> 01:01:24,939
But these rascal friends spoiled him.

962
01:01:25,689 --> 01:01:28,064
Lord, give him strength.

963
01:01:28,605 --> 01:01:30,814
Give my son strength.

964
01:01:31,064 --> 01:01:32,689
I know you went to meet her.

965
01:01:34,397 --> 01:01:37,605
Stop getting jealous of my love life.
Think about Jana.

966
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,189
Did anything weird happen?

967
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:41,855
Weird how?

968
01:01:42,272 --> 01:01:45,105
Anything at all,
when you were with her?

969
01:01:45,564 --> 01:01:47,397
What did you two do?

970
01:01:48,439 --> 01:01:49,272
Why?

971
01:01:49,564 --> 01:01:50,605
Just tell me.

972
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,689
We went to the temple.

973
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:56,772
Then to the river banks.

974
01:01:57,397 --> 01:02:00,064
We were just sitting and chatting,
and then she disappeared.

975
01:02:00,605 --> 01:02:01,689
And didn't return.

976
01:02:01,897 --> 01:02:02,730
I knew it.

977
01:02:04,564 --> 01:02:05,814
I knew it, Vicky.

978
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:06,564
What?

979
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:09,689
- That your girlfriend is a ghost.
- What do you mean ghost?

980
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:11,689
Jana and I were coming to save you.

981
01:02:11,772 --> 01:02:14,439
- And she took Jana instead.
- What nonsense.

982
01:02:14,855 --> 01:02:17,730
Snap out of your dream world, Romeo.

983
01:02:18,147 --> 01:02:22,439
Why does your girlfriend show up only
during the festival, and then disappear?

984
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:26,522
She asks you to get ingredients
for black magic in her love letter.

985
01:02:27,314 --> 01:02:28,564
Have you ever seen her feet?

986
01:02:28,814 --> 01:02:29,855
Are they straight or crooked?

987
01:02:30,147 --> 01:02:31,022
Did you ask her name?

988
01:02:31,105 --> 01:02:32,272
Do you know her phone number?

989
01:02:34,147 --> 01:02:37,064
Has anyone seen her except for you?
Because I haven't.

990
01:02:39,814 --> 01:02:40,772
But...

991
01:02:46,064 --> 01:02:46,939
OH F***

992
01:02:52,189 --> 01:02:54,605
I just don't understand one thing.

993
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:57,022
How does she enter the temple?

994
01:02:57,564 --> 01:02:59,564
Are these ghosts atheists?

995
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:01,522
Aren't they scared?

996
01:03:02,272 --> 01:03:05,772
She never enters the temple,
always stays out.

997
01:03:06,397 --> 01:03:08,522
She doesn't take the offerings either.

998
01:03:16,105 --> 01:03:19,647
Vicky, for the first time
I am feeling sad for you.

999
01:03:20,689 --> 01:03:24,022
Because of all the things in the
world... you fell in love with a witch.

1000
01:03:28,064 --> 01:03:32,064
Go and ask her,
your Stree, where she took Jana.

1001
01:03:33,397 --> 01:03:34,730
I miss him.

1002
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:38,939
One more thing.

1003
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:43,314
Don't tell her that
Bittu told you all this.

1004
01:03:44,272 --> 01:03:45,980
Otherwise, she might abduct me too.

1005
01:04:19,615 --> 01:04:22,782
Warning! Warning! Warning!

1006
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:27,157
An important piece of warning
for all the males in the city.

1007
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:32,324
Stree is out hunting
and the males are in threat.

1008
01:04:32,615 --> 01:04:36,074
The method to save yourself
from Stree is written in this paper.

1009
01:04:36,157 --> 01:04:37,782
Remember it.

1010
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:40,199
- Show me.
- No, it's not for you.

1011
01:04:40,282 --> 01:04:40,949
You're safe.

1012
01:04:41,032 --> 01:04:45,115
If you ever run into Stree...

1013
01:04:45,282 --> 01:04:47,782
...then there's just
one way to escape

1014
01:04:47,949 --> 01:04:50,365
Under no circumstance will you...

1015
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:50,990
Hello!

1016
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:51,782
Hello!

1017
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:55,244
How do you know so
much about the Stree?

1018
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:56,740
I know everything.

1019
01:04:57,032 --> 01:05:01,032
Tripple BA, Double MA,
literarian, musician, teacher.

1020
01:05:01,115 --> 01:05:02,574
I have all these degrees.

1021
01:05:03,157 --> 01:05:05,202
I spent my childhood
amongst crocodiles.

1022
01:05:05,282 --> 01:05:06,449
Rudra Book Depot.

1023
01:05:06,532 --> 01:05:09,032
But why do we write
"O Stree Come tomorrow"?

1024
01:05:09,199 --> 01:05:10,407
We can write something else.

1025
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:11,407
Like, "Stree, never come back again".

1026
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:14,324
As long as it's working,
let it continue.

1027
01:05:14,407 --> 01:05:16,449
And by the way,
if we ever have an unwanted guest...

1028
01:05:16,532 --> 01:05:19,240
...we don't directly say "Get
lost and don't come back" to him.

1029
01:05:19,407 --> 01:05:21,949
We politely say "Come back tomorrow".

1030
01:05:22,032 --> 01:05:25,824
I've heard that the Stree first
s**** her prey before killing him.

1031
01:05:26,407 --> 01:05:28,490
That's the system with
female scorpions too.

1032
01:05:28,657 --> 01:05:31,365
She swallows the male
scorpion which she mates with.

1033
01:05:31,532 --> 01:05:34,865
Listen wise guy, please don't
share your knowledge with us.

1034
01:05:34,949 --> 01:05:36,324
Leave all that aside.

1035
01:05:36,407 --> 01:05:38,699
Tell us what's the solution to it.

1036
01:05:38,865 --> 01:05:40,990
My wife says that I should
wear a saree when I step out.

1037
01:05:41,157 --> 01:05:43,449
Please don't spread such rumors.

1038
01:05:43,699 --> 01:05:46,074
Or soon we'll see everyone
in our city draped in a saree.

1039
01:05:46,324 --> 01:05:48,199
"My beloved's arrived" type.

1040
01:05:48,282 --> 01:05:48,865
No, no.

1041
01:05:48,949 --> 01:05:50,907
How does she know everyone's name?

1042
01:05:51,074 --> 01:05:53,074
Because all our databases
are linked to her.

1043
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:53,865
I see.

1044
01:05:53,949 --> 01:05:55,282
Shut up, idiot.

1045
01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:58,324
You see, two youngsters
have already been abducted.

1046
01:05:58,407 --> 01:05:59,699
Be alert.

1047
01:05:59,782 --> 01:06:02,824
Poor guy was abducted from the town
square. He was such a healthy boy

1048
01:06:03,657 --> 01:06:04,949
Wasn't he your friend too, Vicky?

1049
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:07,740
But not anymore. Not anymore.

1050
01:06:11,782 --> 01:06:13,532
- Keep the glass down.
- What?

1051
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:17,699
Trying to be over smart. Huh!

1052
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:18,407
Get lost.

1053
01:06:20,282 --> 01:06:21,657
He's still alive.
My friend isn't dead.

1054
01:06:53,824 --> 01:06:54,615
Brother.

1055
01:07:01,574 --> 01:07:03,240
Sir. Sir.

1056
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:04,545
See for yourself.

1057
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:29,490
Brother Vicky, you are amazing.

1058
01:07:29,865 --> 01:07:31,532
You stitched this dress in 31 minutes.

1059
01:07:31,824 --> 01:07:32,615
Sir.

1060
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:00,490
- What happened?
- No... it's nothing.

1061
01:08:23,657 --> 01:08:25,824
No, I haven't done anything.
I didn't do anything.

1062
01:08:25,907 --> 01:08:29,449
Don't kill me, Stree. Don't kill me.

1063
01:08:29,532 --> 01:08:30,157
What happened?

1064
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,574
Don't kill me, Stree. Don't kill me.

1065
01:08:31,657 --> 01:08:33,240
Vicky, what's wrong?

1066
01:08:35,949 --> 01:08:36,657
What happened?

1067
01:08:41,532 --> 01:08:43,532
It's nothing.

1068
01:08:44,115 --> 01:08:46,157
You look like you saw a ghost.

1069
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:46,865
Ghost.

1070
01:08:46,949 --> 01:08:48,324
No... no ghost.

1071
01:08:48,407 --> 01:08:49,157
It's nothing.

1072
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,907
- You okay right, Vicky?
- Yes, I am okay.

1073
01:08:52,199 --> 01:08:52,865
I am all right.

1074
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:58,115
- Is it ready?
- Yes, it is.

1075
01:09:00,282 --> 01:09:01,032
Thank you.

1076
01:09:01,407 --> 01:09:01,990
It's all right.

1077
01:09:05,699 --> 01:09:06,907
Shall we go out somewhere?

1078
01:09:07,782 --> 01:09:08,449
Out?

1079
01:09:08,949 --> 01:09:10,907
I'll take you to another
one of my favorite spots.

1080
01:09:11,615 --> 01:09:12,282
No!

1081
01:09:12,449 --> 01:09:13,824
This is my favorite place.

1082
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:16,449
- Let's sit here.
- Okay.

1083
01:09:18,532 --> 01:09:27,865
(Hanuman Chalisa)

1084
01:09:28,865 --> 01:09:30,615
There's magic in your fingers.

1085
01:09:33,324 --> 01:09:35,199
And even in my feet.

1086
01:09:35,532 --> 01:09:38,157
I can turn it around like this.

1087
01:09:38,490 --> 01:09:40,449
Can you turn your feet around too?

1088
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:45,032
- Is there a problem?
- No. What problem?

1089
01:09:45,282 --> 01:09:46,240
There is no problem.

1090
01:09:48,615 --> 01:09:53,240
Can I ask you a question
for my personal knowledge?

1091
01:09:53,865 --> 01:09:56,282
Do you believe in ghosts and spirits?

1092
01:09:57,490 --> 01:10:01,907
I've heard that a woman
wanders in this city at night.

1093
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:03,282
Called Stree.

1094
01:10:04,074 --> 01:10:05,157
She is a witch.

1095
01:10:05,365 --> 01:10:07,365
She abducts males.

1096
01:10:08,365 --> 01:10:09,449
Strips them.

1097
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:13,699
I know she must have a good reason.

1098
01:10:14,115 --> 01:10:16,407
No one is born as a witch. Right.

1099
01:10:17,157 --> 01:10:18,532
I understand.

1100
01:10:20,157 --> 01:10:23,449
My friend Jana,
he's disappeared as well.

1101
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:24,907
He's a very nice guy.

1102
01:10:25,949 --> 01:10:27,740
People say that Stree took him.

1103
01:10:30,490 --> 01:10:32,240
Have you seen Jana?

1104
01:10:38,574 --> 01:10:39,824
Can I ask you a question?

1105
01:10:41,532 --> 01:10:44,699
Its personal,
but don't take it personally.

1106
01:10:46,115 --> 01:10:48,324
Are you...

1107
01:10:49,074 --> 01:10:49,824
Are you...

1108
01:10:50,032 --> 01:10:51,657
I mean not intentionally.

1109
01:10:51,824 --> 01:10:54,407
Are you... Stree.

1110
01:10:55,699 --> 01:10:56,990
I just asked.

1111
01:10:57,074 --> 01:10:58,240
I don't have a problem.

1112
01:10:58,365 --> 01:10:59,574
I was just confirming.

1113
01:11:00,032 --> 01:11:01,532
If you're a ghost...

1114
01:11:01,699 --> 01:11:03,657
I mean you are what you are.

1115
01:11:04,032 --> 01:11:06,032
If it's anything like that,
please tell me now.

1116
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:10,157
I'll just be prepared mentally.
That's all.

1117
01:11:16,032 --> 01:11:16,990
Uncle.

1118
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:19,365
Do you see that girl standing there?

1119
01:11:22,324 --> 01:11:23,115
What girl?

1120
01:11:23,282 --> 01:11:24,615
That one...

1121
01:11:25,115 --> 01:11:25,865
That...

1122
01:11:32,032 --> 01:11:39,032
(Song Other languages)

1123
01:11:39,324 --> 01:11:41,074
You should listen
to your friends as well.

1124
01:11:44,365 --> 01:11:47,324
But how can a beautiful
woman like her be Stree?

1125
01:11:48,115 --> 01:11:49,115
Was she beautiful?

1126
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:51,990
Sorry.

1127
01:11:54,324 --> 01:11:55,657
Think about Jana.

1128
01:11:55,949 --> 01:11:57,115
What condition will he be in?

1129
01:11:58,240 --> 01:11:59,907
Lying somewhere naked in this cold.

1130
01:12:02,782 --> 01:12:03,657
What now?

1131
01:12:06,949 --> 01:12:10,365
We'll have to find someone who's
an expert in such absurd folklores.

1132
01:12:20,657 --> 01:12:21,865
You came to the right place.

1133
01:12:21,949 --> 01:12:23,074
I know everything.

1134
01:12:23,699 --> 01:12:26,532
- Doesn't get me high.
- Then why do you drink?

1135
01:12:27,282 --> 01:12:28,949
In Shama's memory, that's why.

1136
01:12:29,032 --> 01:12:30,574
Leave Shama aside.

1137
01:12:30,740 --> 01:12:32,532
And tell us what you know about Stree.

1138
01:12:32,657 --> 01:12:34,782
I am doing research on Madam Stree.

1139
01:12:35,407 --> 01:12:37,490
And like they say, the fruits
of hard work is always sweet.

1140
01:12:37,574 --> 01:12:38,074
Yeah...

1141
01:12:38,157 --> 01:12:39,824
- And I got one too.
- Sweet fruit.

1142
01:12:39,907 --> 01:12:41,365
No. Book.

1143
01:12:42,032 --> 01:12:42,407
Book.

1144
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:44,282
Just a minute. Just a minute.

1145
01:12:47,407 --> 01:12:48,157
Here you go.

1146
01:12:53,782 --> 01:12:54,532
Ohh...

1147
01:12:54,865 --> 01:12:55,949
KS.

1148
01:12:57,115 --> 01:12:58,199
Ka Su...

1149
01:12:58,324 --> 01:12:59,532
- Are you researching on this?
- Not that.

1150
01:12:59,615 --> 01:13:00,740
This one. This is it.

1151
01:13:00,824 --> 01:13:02,490
This is Chanderi Puran.

1152
01:13:02,990 --> 01:13:04,449
Chanderi has its own manuscript.

1153
01:13:04,532 --> 01:13:08,032
Our city is older than you think.

1154
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:10,032
The spot where you're sitting.

1155
01:13:10,282 --> 01:13:12,282
If we dig beneath it,
you'll find the Harappa Civilization.

1156
01:13:12,699 --> 01:13:13,202
Right here.

1157
01:13:13,282 --> 01:13:13,990
Harappa.

1158
01:13:14,157 --> 01:13:15,907
You don't say.
Exactly under this spot.

1159
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:20,615
So look, Chanderi Puran
written by Shankar Shashtri.

1160
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:22,865
Here we go.

1161
01:13:24,657 --> 01:13:26,449
Many years ago.

1162
01:13:28,615 --> 01:13:32,532
Many years ago there used to be
a beautiful and attractive courtesan.

1163
01:13:32,949 --> 01:13:35,490
Every male in the city
would dream about her.

1164
01:13:36,157 --> 01:13:40,907
Finally, she found a man
who loved soul and not her body.

1165
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:42,199
True love.

1166
01:13:42,407 --> 01:13:44,032
And talk about your generation.

1167
01:13:44,199 --> 01:13:45,657
Love at first sight.

1168
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:47,115
Then your place or mine.

1169
01:13:47,282 --> 01:13:48,824
What direction is this
generation heading in?

1170
01:13:48,907 --> 01:13:49,824
Brother Rudra.

1171
01:13:50,324 --> 01:13:50,990
Don't try to be a dad.

1172
01:13:51,074 --> 01:13:52,824
- Please read ahead.
- Yes.

1173
01:13:53,449 --> 01:13:55,449
They both decided to get married.

1174
01:13:56,074 --> 01:13:58,240
But the other males
couldn't tolerate their joy.

1175
01:13:58,324 --> 01:14:04,115
And before their wedding night, some
jealous people murdered both of them.

1176
01:14:05,824 --> 01:14:07,449
Since then she has been
wandering in this city.

1177
01:14:07,907 --> 01:14:12,157
Looking for her love,
and complete her wedding night.

1178
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:16,407
And this can only happen when
she will find her lost love again.

1179
01:14:16,865 --> 01:14:18,532
Such insolent people.

1180
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:21,032
They can't tolerate
someone's happiness.

1181
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:23,074
Every female has the
right to find her true love.

1182
01:14:23,157 --> 01:14:24,574
Brother Rudra. Brother Rudra.

1183
01:14:24,657 --> 01:14:26,907
We can have this debate later.

1184
01:14:27,157 --> 01:14:29,740
First, tell us if there's
a method to stop Stree?

1185
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:32,740
There I just one way
to get rid of Stree...

1186
01:14:32,824 --> 01:14:34,199
- Yeah
- Turn the page.

1187
01:14:35,074 --> 01:14:36,407
- Turn the page.
- Okay.

1188
01:14:39,574 --> 01:14:42,365
The city's main business was silk.

1189
01:14:42,532 --> 01:14:44,244
People had such high
Scarcity for education,

1190
01:14:44,324 --> 01:14:46,449
...that they actually believed
that the moon was their uncle.

1191
01:14:46,532 --> 01:14:47,657
The main...

1192
01:14:48,157 --> 01:14:50,824
How come Shastri turn
up in west from east.

1193
01:14:52,115 --> 01:14:53,907
After page 66 there is page 80.

1194
01:14:54,032 --> 01:14:54,824
Where are the rest of the pages?

1195
01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:57,574
This is why I don't let anyone in.

1196
01:14:57,824 --> 01:15:00,490
Children tear pages from
the book and make paper boats.

1197
01:15:00,574 --> 01:15:02,199
How will we save Jana now?

1198
01:15:02,282 --> 01:15:03,074
Just a minute.

1199
01:15:04,574 --> 01:15:05,824
I've seen this place.

1200
01:15:06,407 --> 01:15:07,365
- You have?
- Yes.

1201
01:15:08,490 --> 01:15:09,157
Where?

1202
01:15:09,412 --> 01:15:10,412
Above the hill.

1203
01:15:11,162 --> 01:15:12,995
- We should go there.
- Then let's go.

1204
01:15:13,079 --> 01:15:14,495
- We might find something here.
- Yes.

1205
01:15:14,579 --> 01:15:17,120
- Go. Go on you two.
- What "go"?

1206
01:15:17,870 --> 01:15:19,495
- You must come along too.
- Me?

1207
01:15:19,662 --> 01:15:22,579
- Brother Rudra, you have done research.
- Of course.

1208
01:15:22,662 --> 01:15:22,995
I see...

1209
01:15:23,079 --> 01:15:23,787
Wait a minute then.

1210
01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:25,329
Let me take a sip. Take this along.

1211
01:15:27,287 --> 01:15:28,745
Shama, I am going.

1212
01:15:32,954 --> 01:15:36,079
THIRD NIGHT
- We'll run out of petrol.

1213
01:15:36,162 --> 01:15:37,829
How much further, Vicky?

1214
01:15:37,995 --> 01:15:39,079
Just a little further.

1215
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:43,870
Stop!

1216
01:15:43,954 --> 01:15:44,620
Stop.

1217
01:15:55,162 --> 01:15:55,620
What?

1218
01:15:56,537 --> 01:15:57,954
I am allergic... to dust.

1219
01:15:58,037 --> 01:15:58,579
Come on.

1220
01:16:03,495 --> 01:16:04,662
It's so dark around here.

1221
01:16:06,287 --> 01:16:10,037
- What if she abducts me?
- She is a female, not a male.

1222
01:16:10,579 --> 01:16:13,079
She doesn't use force
against your will, like men.

1223
01:16:13,579 --> 01:16:15,370
She will first ask
for your permission.

1224
01:16:16,579 --> 01:16:17,954
Hello Mr. Tom-Dick-or-Harry.

1225
01:16:18,329 --> 01:16:19,370
And if you turn around.

1226
01:16:19,787 --> 01:16:21,162
Then she will think it's a yes.

1227
01:16:21,287 --> 01:16:22,912
Yes, means yes.

1228
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:24,287
Then she will take you away.

1229
01:16:24,787 --> 01:16:27,204
So under no circumstance
will you turn around.

1230
01:16:27,495 --> 01:16:28,829
- No turning around.
- No.

1231
01:16:28,912 --> 01:16:29,537
Let's go.

1232
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,204
Jana.

1233
01:16:41,204 --> 01:16:42,120
Jana.

1234
01:16:47,745 --> 01:16:48,620
Jana.

1235
01:16:55,787 --> 01:16:56,662
Jana.

1236
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:03,912
Jana.

1237
01:17:07,829 --> 01:17:09,620
What are you doing?

1238
01:17:17,204 --> 01:17:18,912
Brother Rudra. Give me the alcohol.

1239
01:17:19,745 --> 01:17:20,495
Alcohol.

1240
01:17:21,954 --> 01:17:22,579
Why?

1241
01:17:24,245 --> 01:17:26,037
This is no time or a drink.

1242
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:27,579
No.

1243
01:17:27,787 --> 01:17:28,370
Power.

1244
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,120
No power.

1245
01:17:32,037 --> 01:17:32,787
Okay, give me.

1246
01:17:37,537 --> 01:17:39,079
Save some for me.

1247
01:17:40,162 --> 01:17:41,787
You're worried about the alcohol.

1248
01:17:41,912 --> 01:17:43,079
You go that way.

1249
01:17:43,245 --> 01:17:45,079
Brother Rudra, you search upstairs.

1250
01:17:45,162 --> 01:17:46,037
- Why?
- And I will look here.

1251
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:46,954
Let's stay together.

1252
01:17:47,037 --> 01:17:47,995
We don't have time for that.

1253
01:18:42,704 --> 01:18:46,204
Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess!

1254
01:18:53,037 --> 01:18:56,537
Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess!

1255
01:18:57,870 --> 01:19:01,870
Mom always said to learn
the Hanuman Chalisa.

1256
01:19:03,037 --> 01:19:04,412
Now see.

1257
01:19:05,787 --> 01:19:06,995
Sorry, mom.

1258
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:19,912
Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake!

1259
01:19:19,995 --> 01:19:21,704
Run.

1260
01:19:21,954 --> 01:19:22,579
Snake!

1261
01:19:41,579 --> 01:19:42,204
Mummy!

1262
01:19:47,954 --> 01:19:49,704
Brother Rudra! Brother Rudra!

1263
01:19:49,787 --> 01:19:50,495
Where are you going?

1264
01:19:50,704 --> 01:19:51,745
I was just warming up.

1265
01:19:52,412 --> 01:19:54,329
- I saw her.
- You did.

1266
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:57,537
Brother Rudra!

1267
01:20:10,537 --> 01:20:11,912
Jana.

1268
01:20:48,537 --> 01:20:50,704
Vicky...

1269
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:59,662
Stree... it's me. Vicky.

1270
01:21:00,537 --> 01:21:02,329
Remember I stitched your dress.

1271
01:21:03,704 --> 01:21:09,287
I am here for Jana,
he's a... very nice guy.

1272
01:21:09,556 --> 01:21:11,579
In fact, he calls you sister-in-law.

1273
01:21:11,662 --> 01:21:14,329
Vicky...

1274
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:20,412
I stitched your dress in 35 minutes,
Stree, and you want to abduct me.

1275
01:21:21,245 --> 01:21:22,954
You hurt me.

1276
01:21:23,329 --> 01:21:25,162
I won't turn around.

1277
01:21:26,037 --> 01:21:27,579
- Vicky...
- I can't hear you at all.

1278
01:21:27,662 --> 01:21:29,795
Hello. Hello. Hello.

1279
01:21:52,912 --> 01:21:54,120
Daddy.

1280
01:21:55,537 --> 01:21:56,412
Daddy.

1281
01:22:57,037 --> 01:22:58,287
Vicky!

1282
01:23:07,954 --> 01:23:08,662
Are you okay?

1283
01:23:08,745 --> 01:23:11,829
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I am fine.

1284
01:23:12,287 --> 01:23:13,870
Is she gone?

1285
01:23:15,204 --> 01:23:16,079
Don't know.

1286
01:23:16,912 --> 01:23:17,912
Don't know?

1287
01:23:21,495 --> 01:23:23,329
But at least one good thing happened.

1288
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:25,412
You're not Stree.

1289
01:23:26,495 --> 01:23:27,870
You know, like in the morning...

1290
01:23:30,037 --> 01:23:30,745
Sorry.

1291
01:23:31,373 --> 01:23:32,581
Shall we go back?

1292
01:23:32,831 --> 01:23:34,331
- But Vicky is still inside.
- Bittu.

1293
01:23:34,748 --> 01:23:37,664
Where were you?

1294
01:23:37,998 --> 01:23:38,789
Did you see Jana?

1295
01:23:40,664 --> 01:23:41,123
No!

1296
01:23:41,206 --> 01:23:43,289
Run brother Rudra.
He's fallen prey as well.

1297
01:23:43,581 --> 01:23:44,914
That's not her.

1298
01:23:44,998 --> 01:23:46,498
- She is not Stree.
- You are lying.

1299
01:23:46,748 --> 01:23:47,789
That's the girl.

1300
01:23:47,914 --> 01:23:48,998
The letter... Remember.

1301
01:23:49,164 --> 01:23:50,081
The dress.

1302
01:23:51,331 --> 01:23:52,373
"Vicky Please!"

1303
01:23:52,998 --> 01:23:53,914
That's her.

1304
01:23:54,581 --> 01:23:57,001
I swear she risked
her own life to save mine.

1305
01:23:57,081 --> 01:23:58,206
You two would've...

1306
01:23:59,039 --> 01:23:59,998
Been amazed.

1307
01:24:00,331 --> 01:24:01,956
She flung her dagger at the witch.

1308
01:24:02,123 --> 01:24:04,456
If we had posted her video on Youtube,
it would've been an instant hit.

1309
01:24:05,081 --> 01:24:06,331
#daggergirl.

1310
01:24:06,498 --> 01:24:09,248
But what is she doing here?
How does she know we're here?

1311
01:24:09,706 --> 01:24:11,623
Your friend is not
the only one missing.

1312
01:24:12,331 --> 01:24:14,039
Many people go missing every year.

1313
01:24:14,456 --> 01:24:16,748
I've been coming here for the
past three years during the festival.

1314
01:24:17,414 --> 01:24:19,873
So that I can get rid of her for good.

1315
01:24:24,123 --> 01:24:26,373
I know he will never come back.

1316
01:24:27,914 --> 01:24:28,748
But still...

1317
01:24:30,539 --> 01:24:32,914
You can share your sorrow with me.

1318
01:24:33,581 --> 01:24:34,914
It will lighten your burden.

1319
01:24:36,998 --> 01:24:37,581
No!

1320
01:24:38,164 --> 01:24:39,289
Okay.

1321
01:24:39,998 --> 01:24:41,998
By the way,
where did you learn this art?

1322
01:24:42,539 --> 01:24:43,706
I had to wander around for it.

1323
01:24:44,289 --> 01:24:47,873
I went to ascetics, and tantric.

1324
01:24:48,414 --> 01:24:51,748
Tantra, magic, hypnosis,
and spells from the red book.

1325
01:24:51,831 --> 01:24:52,873
I learned everything.

1326
01:24:53,456 --> 01:24:55,873
I've had only one mission
for the past three years.

1327
01:24:56,289 --> 01:24:57,498
Defeating Stree.

1328
01:24:59,539 --> 01:25:02,831
I tried everything I knew.

1329
01:25:03,581 --> 01:25:04,789
But it wasn't enough.

1330
01:25:05,206 --> 01:25:06,956
I thought I was ready.

1331
01:25:07,664 --> 01:25:09,664
I thought that I would
defeat her this time.

1332
01:25:10,748 --> 01:25:15,539
You see, ma'am. I've done
extensive research on this subject.

1333
01:25:15,623 --> 01:25:16,664
Research.

1334
01:25:16,748 --> 01:25:21,748
I have books on magic spells, hypnosis,
and other art forms in my library.

1335
01:25:21,956 --> 01:25:23,623
You can come over
if you need any help.

1336
01:25:23,873 --> 01:25:25,748
Even we have a shop
for lady's fashion.

1337
01:25:25,831 --> 01:25:26,623
Best in town.

1338
01:25:26,873 --> 01:25:29,123
If you need anything at any time,
just let me know.

1339
01:25:29,498 --> 01:25:32,623
And anyway... it's always
better than stitched clothes.

1340
01:25:33,039 --> 01:25:34,373
I don't like readymade.

1341
01:25:37,956 --> 01:25:38,539
Shall we?

1342
01:25:40,081 --> 01:25:40,956
Vicky.

1343
01:25:42,123 --> 01:25:42,914
What happened?

1344
01:25:56,206 --> 01:25:59,123
Jana. My Jana is back.

1345
01:25:59,206 --> 01:26:00,956
My son is back.

1346
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:04,706
My son, where were you?

1347
01:26:05,081 --> 01:26:08,206
- Where were you...
- You'll tear his (the) clothes.

1348
01:26:08,289 --> 01:26:09,706
He's lost so much weight.

1349
01:26:10,248 --> 01:26:12,414
Forgive me, son. Forgive me.

1350
01:26:12,664 --> 01:26:14,664
You really are his friend.

1351
01:26:14,748 --> 01:26:16,539
- I said such bad things.
- It's all right.

1352
01:26:16,623 --> 01:26:17,289
It's okay, aunty.

1353
01:26:17,373 --> 01:26:20,498
Jana, it's your mom, your mom.

1354
01:26:20,581 --> 01:26:21,831
I want to go sleep.

1355
01:26:22,956 --> 01:26:24,039
He wants to sleep.

1356
01:26:24,498 --> 01:26:25,998
- Yes son, let's go.
- Come on.

1357
01:26:26,123 --> 01:26:28,081
Please send my coat back.

1358
01:26:28,164 --> 01:26:28,831
Okay, aunty.

1359
01:26:30,081 --> 01:26:30,789
Bye, Jana.

1360
01:27:07,081 --> 01:27:09,706
Aunty. Aunty.

1361
01:27:09,789 --> 01:27:12,081
She took my husband.

1362
01:27:12,289 --> 01:27:16,373
She took my son too.

1363
01:27:16,456 --> 01:27:19,414
She took him too.

1364
01:27:20,789 --> 01:27:23,206
She took my husband.

1365
01:27:23,289 --> 01:27:25,956
My husband too.

1366
01:27:45,956 --> 01:27:48,373
But... how did so
many people disappear?

1367
01:27:50,123 --> 01:27:51,873
Someone erased the ink.

1368
01:27:58,498 --> 01:28:00,748
Jana, look what Stree did.

1369
01:28:01,081 --> 01:28:03,289
She abducted a dozen men.

1370
01:28:03,498 --> 01:28:05,414
And she's also erased the ink.

1371
01:28:05,498 --> 01:28:06,206
Jana.

1372
01:28:07,789 --> 01:28:08,289
You...

1373
01:28:13,706 --> 01:28:14,456
Jana.

1374
01:28:19,164 --> 01:28:20,164
Jana...

1375
01:28:22,289 --> 01:28:24,123
Why are you sitting like that, Jana?

1376
01:28:27,206 --> 01:28:28,289
And your palms...

1377
01:28:30,373 --> 01:28:31,331
Jana.

1378
01:28:38,873 --> 01:28:41,623
I am your mother.
Listen to your mom, son.

1379
01:28:42,248 --> 01:28:42,956
Jana.

1380
01:28:43,914 --> 01:28:45,623
Jana, spare your friends at least.

1381
01:28:46,081 --> 01:28:49,206
Listen to me,
I am already 70% damaged.

1382
01:28:53,664 --> 01:28:54,289
Jana.

1383
01:28:54,373 --> 01:28:57,331
We're humans, not kites.

1384
01:28:58,831 --> 01:28:59,539
Jana.

1385
01:28:59,623 --> 01:29:02,873
Vicky, look at Jana's hand.
He erased the ink.

1386
01:29:03,081 --> 01:29:05,001
- Divert his attention?
- Me?

1387
01:29:05,081 --> 01:29:05,956
Go.

1388
01:29:06,498 --> 01:29:07,248
Jana.

1389
01:29:07,331 --> 01:29:08,623
Someone get a blanket.

1390
01:29:09,789 --> 01:29:10,831
Jana.

1391
01:29:11,539 --> 01:29:12,248
Jana.

1392
01:29:12,706 --> 01:29:13,414
Jana.

1393
01:29:13,539 --> 01:29:14,539
Jana, stop.

1394
01:29:14,623 --> 01:29:19,748
Jana. Jana. Jana. Jana. Jana.

1395
01:29:20,998 --> 01:29:22,623
It's Vicky.

1396
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:27,206
Jana.

1397
01:29:27,289 --> 01:29:28,289
Quiet!

1398
01:29:28,706 --> 01:29:30,789
Or else I will slap you.

1399
01:29:30,998 --> 01:29:31,539
Quiet!

1400
01:29:35,498 --> 01:29:36,623
Jana.

1401
01:29:36,706 --> 01:29:38,039
What are you doing?

1402
01:29:38,914 --> 01:29:40,248
It's Vicky.

1403
01:29:42,706 --> 01:29:45,289
Bittu! Bittu!

1404
01:29:50,081 --> 01:29:50,956
Come on.

1405
01:29:56,373 --> 01:29:58,081
This is the only solution left.

1406
01:29:58,289 --> 01:30:00,998
Wear saree and bangles like women do.

1407
01:30:01,123 --> 01:30:02,539
Your solutions were
not effective at all.

1408
01:30:02,706 --> 01:30:05,164
That Stree took 20 men.

1409
01:30:06,373 --> 01:30:07,164
Yes, Vicky.

1410
01:30:07,498 --> 01:30:09,123
Yes, I know. I am coming.

1411
01:30:09,414 --> 01:30:10,331
I am coming.

1412
01:30:10,414 --> 01:30:12,748
We want our youngsters back.

1413
01:30:13,248 --> 01:30:16,248
Whoever brings the
missing men back,

1414
01:30:16,664 --> 01:30:22,956
...will be rewarded
10,000 for every male.

1415
01:30:24,081 --> 01:30:25,164
Understand?

1416
01:30:27,998 --> 01:30:29,581
This city wants freedom.

1417
01:30:29,664 --> 01:30:31,248
Freedom.

1418
01:30:31,373 --> 01:30:33,081
Everyone knows...

1419
01:30:33,164 --> 01:30:34,789
Stree is a thief.

1420
01:30:34,873 --> 01:30:36,956
Let's all unite.

1421
01:30:37,039 --> 01:30:38,664
And drive Stree away.

1422
01:30:38,748 --> 01:30:41,789
You give us men...

1423
01:30:41,956 --> 01:30:43,748
We'll give you freedom.

1424
01:30:45,081 --> 01:30:48,081
It's the smoke coming on my face.

1425
01:30:49,414 --> 01:30:52,414
- Bittu, untie me.
- Wait.

1426
01:30:52,498 --> 01:30:53,873
No one listens to him.

1427
01:30:54,289 --> 01:30:57,164
David has turned into Goliath today.

1428
01:30:57,539 --> 01:30:59,123
How can someone beat
up your own friend?

1429
01:30:59,581 --> 01:31:01,081
We cannot waste any more time.

1430
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:03,081
Jana is completely under her control.

1431
01:31:03,331 --> 01:31:05,706
We must do something solid
before the festival ends.

1432
01:31:05,956 --> 01:31:09,623
You're experienced in this field,
suggest something.

1433
01:31:10,081 --> 01:31:14,123
If we can find out more about Stree,
then I can come up with something.

1434
01:31:15,289 --> 01:31:16,248
But from where?

1435
01:31:17,456 --> 01:31:20,206
- We found a book at his shop.
- Library.

1436
01:31:21,664 --> 01:31:23,748
We found a book in his library.

1437
01:31:24,164 --> 01:31:25,164
But the pages were missing.

1438
01:31:26,873 --> 01:31:30,123
What if we find the
guy who wrote that book...

1439
01:31:30,414 --> 01:31:32,623
...then he would know what
was written on those pages.

1440
01:31:33,331 --> 01:31:35,789
- Do you know that guy?
- I know everything.

1441
01:31:35,956 --> 01:31:37,498
Is he alive?

1442
01:31:38,498 --> 01:31:39,873
He lives in Emergency.

1443
01:31:40,498 --> 01:31:41,539
- What?
- ICU!

1444
01:31:42,706 --> 01:31:43,748
Emergency.

1445
01:32:08,164 --> 01:32:09,956
Which book are you talking about?

1446
01:32:12,248 --> 01:32:13,873
Respected Mr. Shastri.

1447
01:32:14,123 --> 01:32:18,414
You wrote the history
of our city in a book.

1448
01:32:18,498 --> 01:32:21,664
Chanderi Puran, remember?

1449
01:32:22,164 --> 01:32:24,998
The book was launched
in my Rudra Book Depot.

1450
01:32:26,581 --> 01:32:29,373
You used to sell
adult books back then.

1451
01:32:30,373 --> 01:32:33,623
Mr. Shashtri,
that Stree abducted our friend.

1452
01:32:33,831 --> 01:32:35,664
She abducted many more males too.

1453
01:32:35,748 --> 01:32:37,706
Can we get them back?

1454
01:32:38,248 --> 01:32:39,331
Stree.

1455
01:32:39,498 --> 01:32:41,248
Please, Mr. Shashtri.

1456
01:32:41,914 --> 01:32:43,039
We request.

1457
01:32:45,831 --> 01:32:47,706
Did the emergency end?

1458
01:32:48,248 --> 01:32:49,414
We've been banging
our heads against a wall.

1459
01:32:49,498 --> 01:32:50,956
This man doesn't remember anything.

1460
01:32:51,664 --> 01:32:55,248
Yes, Emergency is over.

1461
01:32:56,248 --> 01:32:57,831
No-no-no.

1462
01:32:58,289 --> 01:33:01,039
Mr. Shashtri,
we're talking about Stree.

1463
01:33:01,206 --> 01:33:01,914
Stree.
- Stree.

1464
01:33:01,998 --> 01:33:03,081
Like "Stree Come back tomorrow".

1465
01:33:03,164 --> 01:33:03,873
Stree.

1466
01:33:04,498 --> 01:33:06,123
What is a Stree (Female)?

1467
01:33:08,539 --> 01:33:11,706
She has no s tature compared to males.

1468
01:33:11,998 --> 01:33:12,914
What?

1469
01:33:13,164 --> 01:33:15,498
She should always
stay within her limits.

1470
01:33:16,123 --> 01:33:18,289
Never step out of the home.

1471
01:33:19,623 --> 01:33:23,748
Her job is to keep her husband happy,
and bear children.

1472
01:33:24,039 --> 01:33:28,873
And if she crosses her limit,
then burn her alive at the cross.

1473
01:33:30,873 --> 01:33:31,956
He has no solution.

1474
01:33:32,039 --> 01:33:32,914
Such vile thoughts.

1475
01:33:32,998 --> 01:33:34,081
We just wasted our time with him.

1476
01:33:34,206 --> 01:33:35,581
What kind of a writer is he?

1477
01:33:36,039 --> 01:33:36,914
Is this what he writes?

1478
01:33:37,456 --> 01:33:38,414
What about Jana now?

1479
01:33:38,498 --> 01:33:39,581
He's too strong to control.

1480
01:33:39,664 --> 01:33:40,164
Let's think.

1481
01:33:40,248 --> 01:33:41,539
He's got such a filthy mind.

1482
01:33:42,623 --> 01:33:49,789
It's not me,
its this city that has a filthy mind.

1483
01:33:51,206 --> 01:33:54,331
They used that Stree
as long as they wanted.

1484
01:33:54,706 --> 01:33:55,914
And then got rid of her.

1485
01:33:57,164 --> 01:34:02,873
And that man who gave her respect,
they took him away as well.

1486
01:34:04,414 --> 01:34:05,456
They will all die.

1487
01:34:06,456 --> 01:34:07,498
Everyone.

1488
01:34:10,206 --> 01:34:15,289
As long as there's even one male
in this city, she won't stay quiet.

1489
01:34:17,289 --> 01:34:22,248
Just one...
one man can douse this fire.

1490
01:34:22,456 --> 01:34:24,873
- Who is he?
- How does he look?

1491
01:34:26,331 --> 01:34:30,123
Wheatish color, long nose.
And treats himself like a king.

1492
01:34:31,164 --> 01:34:33,414
Born in the arms of the oak tree.

1493
01:34:33,498 --> 01:34:35,289
The prince of his family.

1494
01:34:35,623 --> 01:34:37,498
Love reflects in his eyes.

1495
01:34:37,748 --> 01:34:39,248
A true artist.

1496
01:34:39,873 --> 01:34:42,456
He's the true protector of this city.

1497
01:34:44,164 --> 01:34:47,248
A prostitute's son who's a bachelor.

1498
01:34:47,331 --> 01:34:49,331
Courtesan's son who's a bachelor.

1499
01:34:49,414 --> 01:34:53,081
A courtesan's son who's a bachelor.

1500
01:34:55,081 --> 01:34:57,998
Wheatish color, long nose.
And treats himself like a king.

1501
01:34:58,414 --> 01:35:03,373
Born in the arms of the oak tree.
The prince of his family.

1502
01:35:04,789 --> 01:35:08,414
Vicky. Weren't you born
at your grandma's house?

1503
01:35:10,123 --> 01:35:12,664
And there was an oak
tree behind her house.

1504
01:35:13,456 --> 01:35:14,248
Yes.

1505
01:35:14,539 --> 01:35:15,081
So?

1506
01:35:15,748 --> 01:35:17,123
And you're the only son.

1507
01:35:18,039 --> 01:35:19,289
Prince.

1508
01:35:19,664 --> 01:35:20,456
Very good.

1509
01:35:20,831 --> 01:35:25,081
Wheatish color, long nose.
And treats himself like a king.

1510
01:35:25,289 --> 01:35:28,706
- He has wheatish color.
- And a long nose.

1511
01:35:29,373 --> 01:35:34,373
And, you always think
of yourself as a king.

1512
01:35:34,706 --> 01:35:36,789
Love reflects in his eyes.

1513
01:35:37,289 --> 01:35:38,581
And a true artist.

1514
01:35:39,039 --> 01:35:40,456
There's love in your eyes.

1515
01:35:40,956 --> 01:35:43,248
And Stree saw that,
which is why she didn't abduct him.

1516
01:35:43,456 --> 01:35:44,706
There's love in my eyes?

1517
01:35:44,873 --> 01:35:46,623
Stree can see it, not her.

1518
01:35:46,831 --> 01:35:48,456
And you're an artist as well.

1519
01:35:49,081 --> 01:35:50,789
Aren't you getting carried away now?

1520
01:35:51,039 --> 01:35:52,206
What artist?

1521
01:35:52,706 --> 01:35:57,998
Vicky is the best ladies tailor
in the neighboring three districts.

1522
01:35:58,164 --> 01:35:58,956
Exactly.

1523
01:35:59,081 --> 01:36:00,539
This is a good coincidence.

1524
01:36:00,914 --> 01:36:03,123
But we must find someone
who has all five qualities?

1525
01:36:03,206 --> 01:36:05,248
And what about the fifth quality?
courtesan's son?

1526
01:36:05,331 --> 01:36:06,539
How will find him?

1527
01:36:07,498 --> 01:36:09,456
Courtesan means that right?

1528
01:36:09,623 --> 01:36:10,081
That...

1529
01:36:21,623 --> 01:36:23,164
No one told him.

1530
01:36:23,581 --> 01:36:24,373
Nobody.

1531
01:36:24,789 --> 01:36:28,206
Everyone knows, but you don't know.

1532
01:36:28,873 --> 01:36:29,456
What?

1533
01:36:32,289 --> 01:36:33,206
- What?
- Look...

1534
01:36:35,998 --> 01:36:38,289
There's no need to feel bad.

1535
01:36:39,081 --> 01:36:44,123
Some mothers are school teachers,
some are government officers.

1536
01:36:44,498 --> 01:36:46,373
Some make pickles.

1537
01:36:47,498 --> 01:36:50,331
- Your mother was that...
- What?

1538
01:36:50,998 --> 01:36:51,623
That.

1539
01:36:53,456 --> 01:36:54,123
What?

1540
01:36:55,498 --> 01:36:56,248
Courtesan!

1541
01:36:59,123 --> 01:37:01,081
I will kill you right now.

1542
01:37:04,748 --> 01:37:07,123
I thought you never meant
it when you called me a bas***

1543
01:37:07,623 --> 01:37:08,414
You...

1544
01:37:08,914 --> 01:37:10,039
This is absurd.

1545
01:37:12,289 --> 01:37:13,706
And in front of her.

1546
01:37:16,706 --> 01:37:18,414
Vicky. it's true.

1547
01:37:20,289 --> 01:37:22,748
Jana, I will break your head.

1548
01:37:26,331 --> 01:37:26,873
Vicky.

1549
01:37:26,956 --> 01:37:27,789
Don't look at me.

1550
01:37:28,414 --> 01:37:30,206
I won't believe you.

1551
01:37:32,706 --> 01:37:34,123
My mother was not a courtesan.

1552
01:37:35,123 --> 01:37:36,206
- Listen!
- No.

1553
01:37:36,831 --> 01:37:38,164
Vicky!

1554
01:37:45,373 --> 01:37:46,998
We've found the protector of the city.

1555
01:37:49,539 --> 01:37:50,873
He will deal with Stree.

1556
01:37:51,623 --> 01:37:54,289
- You mean Stree.
- Yes. Stree.

1557
01:38:12,039 --> 01:38:12,748
One more.

1558
01:38:20,289 --> 01:38:23,581
Brother Vicky, mom's asking
when you will return her blouse.

1559
01:38:28,123 --> 01:38:28,873
Dad.

1560
01:38:32,914 --> 01:38:34,623
What were you lecturing
me about energy?

1561
01:38:38,164 --> 01:38:40,206
You've done a lot of
friendship when you were young.

1562
01:38:42,623 --> 01:38:44,081
Tell me something.

1563
01:38:45,289 --> 01:38:48,831
Did you do friendship with mom,
or marry her?

1564
01:38:56,164 --> 01:38:57,414
Blouse petticoat.

1565
01:39:04,081 --> 01:39:05,164
Who was she?

1566
01:39:06,623 --> 01:39:07,706
Why didn't you tell me?

1567
01:39:09,748 --> 01:39:11,956
You kept lying to me.

1568
01:39:23,664 --> 01:39:26,623
Daddy, I won't drink again.
Swear on mom.

1569
01:39:27,581 --> 01:39:28,623
Swear on my dad, okay.

1570
01:39:28,831 --> 01:39:29,456
Sorry.

1571
01:39:30,414 --> 01:39:31,456
Eat.

1572
01:39:36,164 --> 01:39:37,581
You could've told me this once.

1573
01:39:37,748 --> 01:39:38,456
That's all.

1574
01:39:41,914 --> 01:39:42,706
Eat.

1575
01:39:47,971 --> 01:39:49,148
I talked to daddy.

1576
01:39:49,404 --> 01:39:50,581
And I thought how does it matter.

1577
01:39:51,206 --> 01:39:52,331
She was my mother after all.

1578
01:39:53,664 --> 01:39:55,039
Maybe my father's someone else too.

1579
01:39:55,831 --> 01:39:57,248
But I know only one father.

1580
01:39:58,831 --> 01:40:01,748
The guy who stands at the
shop with the measuring tape.

1581
01:40:03,711 --> 01:40:07,878
And who thinks that my talent
is the greatest talent in the world.

1582
01:40:10,378 --> 01:40:11,544
But this city...

1583
01:40:12,378 --> 01:40:16,003
Everyone knew about me,
but they never made fun of me.

1584
01:40:17,586 --> 01:40:19,878
Otherwise, people like to gossip.

1585
01:40:21,586 --> 01:40:27,044
I always knew that I wasn't
meant for altering dresses.

1586
01:40:27,711 --> 01:40:31,336
But I didn't know that
I was born to save these people.

1587
01:40:32,309 --> 01:40:35,518
Lord chose a really
unique mission for me.

1588
01:40:37,820 --> 01:40:39,434
"Born in the arms of the oak tree."

1589
01:40:40,078 --> 01:40:41,351
"The sole prince..."

1590
01:40:45,128 --> 01:40:46,268
"The son of a courtesan
who's a bachelor."

1591
01:40:47,434 --> 01:40:49,518
If I really am the
son of a coutesan...

1592
01:40:49,726 --> 01:40:51,601
...then I will save this city.

1593
01:40:52,101 --> 01:40:54,143
Along with Jana,
I will save everyone!

1594
01:40:55,841 --> 01:40:57,768
Bittu gather everyone.

1595
01:41:02,809 --> 01:41:04,226
What do we know about the Stree?

1596
01:41:04,768 --> 01:41:06,976
- She is scary.
- Ferocious.

1597
01:41:07,226 --> 01:41:09,768
No! She can read.

1598
01:41:10,018 --> 01:41:13,059
Have you ever heard about
a ghost or spirit who can read?

1599
01:41:13,226 --> 01:41:14,643
Right.

1600
01:41:14,726 --> 01:41:17,309
Meaning we're up against
an educated witch.

1601
01:41:17,393 --> 01:41:18,934
She is the new generation witch.

1602
01:41:19,168 --> 01:41:20,059
Point no. 2.

1603
01:41:20,559 --> 01:41:22,518
She comes every year during
the festival, to abduct men.

1604
01:41:22,976 --> 01:41:26,059
But if you write outside your
house "O Stree, come back tomorrow".

1605
01:41:26,393 --> 01:41:28,809
Then she reads it and thinks...

1606
01:41:29,226 --> 01:41:34,393
"Oh... okay. Rest today,
and I'll come back tomorrow."

1607
01:41:34,851 --> 01:41:37,351
Meaning she listens.

1608
01:41:37,434 --> 01:41:38,851
Meaning she is obedient.

1609
01:41:39,059 --> 01:41:39,976
No. 3.

1610
01:41:40,559 --> 01:41:41,768
She is very stupid.

1611
01:41:41,976 --> 01:41:43,059
Next night she comes back again.

1612
01:41:43,351 --> 01:41:46,184
Reads the same line
again and thinks...

1613
01:41:46,684 --> 01:41:49,726
"Oh shit, now I'll have
to come back tomorrow again."

1614
01:41:49,809 --> 01:41:50,643
"This is cheating."

1615
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:52,893
And she goes back to her home.

1616
01:41:53,059 --> 01:41:55,393
Poor thing doesn't understand
that these people are s...

1617
01:41:57,268 --> 01:41:58,226
I mean making a fool of her.

1618
01:41:58,684 --> 01:42:00,809
- She has a low IQ level.
- Exactly.

1619
01:42:00,934 --> 01:42:03,601
And we're much smarter than her.

1620
01:42:03,893 --> 01:42:04,559
Thank you.

1621
01:42:04,643 --> 01:42:06,143
And, if we get serious...

1622
01:42:06,976 --> 01:42:09,643
...then we can easily
get rid of this witch forever.

1623
01:42:10,018 --> 01:42:12,934
- Then let's get serious.
- Correct. Let's get serious.

1624
01:42:15,351 --> 01:42:16,434
But what are we going to do?

1625
01:42:20,393 --> 01:42:21,268
Wedding night.

1626
01:42:22,018 --> 01:42:23,018
Wedding night.

1627
01:42:23,434 --> 01:42:25,184
But brother Rudra,
aren't you too old for that?

1628
01:42:25,268 --> 01:42:26,226
No me.

1629
01:42:26,768 --> 01:42:27,268
No!

1630
01:42:27,393 --> 01:42:29,309
According to Mr. Shashtri's book,

1631
01:42:29,518 --> 01:42:32,851
Stree wants her wedding
night which was left incomplete.

1632
01:42:32,976 --> 01:42:33,851
Yes so.

1633
01:42:33,976 --> 01:42:35,559
And if you're the
protector of this city...

1634
01:42:35,643 --> 01:42:39,018
...then you must fulfill her wish.

1635
01:42:39,101 --> 01:42:40,018
What are you saying?

1636
01:42:40,101 --> 01:42:40,976
Have you lost your mind?

1637
01:42:41,059 --> 01:42:42,351
- No.
- What are you saying?

1638
01:42:42,976 --> 01:42:45,143
My father never even let
me watch a wedding night on TV,

1639
01:42:45,226 --> 01:42:46,434
...how can I do it with a witch?

1640
01:42:46,559 --> 01:42:47,268
Yes.

1641
01:42:47,976 --> 01:42:50,101
I am the protector, shouldn't
I prepare for a battle or something.

1642
01:42:50,184 --> 01:42:52,684
The battle begins
after the wedding night.

1643
01:42:53,643 --> 01:42:54,559
Brother Rudra...

1644
01:42:55,101 --> 01:42:58,809
You mean, me and that witch...

1645
01:42:59,018 --> 01:43:01,559
We just have to use it as bait.

1646
01:43:02,434 --> 01:43:05,184
We must lead her to you, that's all.

1647
01:43:05,601 --> 01:43:07,643
Remember she saw love in your eyes.

1648
01:43:07,976 --> 01:43:08,518
Yes.

1649
01:43:08,601 --> 01:43:10,518
- And then?
- Then leave it to me.

1650
01:43:10,899 --> 01:43:12,601
She is very strong in her own home.

1651
01:43:13,018 --> 01:43:16,351
But I know how to overpower
her when she is out of her house.

1652
01:43:17,809 --> 01:43:19,018
But where will we call her?

1653
01:43:21,015 --> 01:43:22,809
Right here, in Vicky's Palace.

1654
01:43:23,059 --> 01:43:23,726
Best place.

1655
01:43:55,059 --> 01:43:56,184
Show the bait.

1656
01:44:18,018 --> 01:44:20,226
Hurry up.

1657
01:44:41,851 --> 01:44:43,393
Stree is out hunting today.

1658
01:44:43,518 --> 01:44:46,143
Don't step out of the
house and lock the door.

1659
01:44:46,226 --> 01:44:46,643
Okay.

1660
01:44:46,726 --> 01:44:47,809
Come back soon.

1661
01:44:47,893 --> 01:44:49,559
I feel scared alone.
- I'll be back soon.

1662
01:44:49,643 --> 01:44:51,018
Keep the doors closed.

1663
01:45:05,393 --> 01:45:06,851
Vicky, you're looking really handsome.

1664
01:45:06,934 --> 01:45:08,351
- Now wear this cap.
- No, no.

1665
01:45:08,518 --> 01:45:09,726
- I said wear it.
- No, no, caps. You'll ruin my hair.

1666
01:45:09,809 --> 01:45:11,559
- But the groom has to wear...
- I don't want to...

1667
01:45:11,643 --> 01:45:12,268
Wear it.

1668
01:45:26,559 --> 01:45:28,309
Dad had such vivid
dreams about my wedding.

1669
01:45:28,976 --> 01:45:31,559
Who knew that I'll be
marrying a witch some day.

1670
01:45:31,726 --> 01:45:32,768
Don't worry.

1671
01:45:33,143 --> 01:45:34,976
You're getting a chance
to save the entire city.

1672
01:45:35,184 --> 01:45:36,351
Not everyone gets this opportunity.

1673
01:45:36,434 --> 01:45:36,896
Don't be scared.

1674
01:45:36,976 --> 01:45:38,726
Don't you want to save Jana?

1675
01:45:38,809 --> 01:45:40,393
Don't you want to make
him a human being again?

1676
01:45:40,934 --> 01:45:41,809
What is the plan?

1677
01:45:41,893 --> 01:45:42,684
What do we do?

1678
01:45:43,434 --> 01:45:46,934
Stree will definitely come here
after reading the message on the wall.

1679
01:45:49,184 --> 01:45:52,809
When she looks into your eyes,
don't look away.

1680
01:45:52,893 --> 01:45:54,601
Instead look into her eyes.

1681
01:45:55,184 --> 01:45:56,434
I know a spell.

1682
01:45:56,851 --> 01:45:58,976
That spell will render her powerless.

1683
01:45:59,143 --> 01:46:02,726
And then we must drive
this dagger through her heart.

1684
01:46:02,893 --> 01:46:04,768
Dagger? How can I...

1685
01:46:06,226 --> 01:46:07,268
We're waiting inside.

1686
01:46:07,559 --> 01:46:08,309
Don't be scared.

1687
01:46:09,851 --> 01:46:10,434
Let's go.

1688
01:46:10,684 --> 01:46:11,643
Listen...

1689
01:46:12,059 --> 01:46:14,101
Will your spell work?

1690
01:46:14,268 --> 01:46:15,018
90%

1691
01:46:15,101 --> 01:46:16,893
What is 90%?

1692
01:46:17,893 --> 01:46:19,226
Maybe 99%.

1693
01:46:19,768 --> 01:46:22,393
Meaning there is a
1% chance I'll be dead.

1694
01:46:24,018 --> 01:46:24,976
Daddy...

1695
01:46:25,309 --> 01:46:26,226
Let's go.

1696
01:46:26,601 --> 01:46:27,976
Listen.

1697
01:46:29,518 --> 01:46:31,101
I am going...

1698
01:46:33,976 --> 01:46:35,976
Don't worry, okay.

1699
01:46:36,226 --> 01:46:37,309
Don't forget you are Vicky.

1700
01:46:37,601 --> 01:46:40,226
The guy who can spend
a night with a witch.

1701
01:46:40,434 --> 01:46:43,643
In case I don't come back,
don't come looking for me.

1702
01:46:44,393 --> 01:46:46,934
And... look after my dad.

1703
01:46:51,518 --> 01:46:53,851
O Stree come back tomorrow.

1704
01:46:54,976 --> 01:46:57,976
O Stree there are no men here.

1705
01:46:59,768 --> 01:47:01,893
O Stree come back tomorrow.

1706
01:47:02,809 --> 01:47:05,809
O Stree there are no men here.

1707
01:47:40,559 --> 01:47:44,976
O STREE COME HERE.

1708
01:48:03,101 --> 01:48:05,018
O STREE COME HERE.

1709
01:48:15,976 --> 01:48:17,018
I think it's her.

1710
01:48:29,018 --> 01:48:33,601
O STREE COME HERE.

1711
01:48:42,601 --> 01:48:43,976
She isn't coming inside.

1712
01:48:44,143 --> 01:48:45,559
Is she suspicious?

1713
01:48:45,809 --> 01:48:48,934
Stree is smarter than
you all thought she is.

1714
01:48:51,934 --> 01:48:53,226
- Jana.
- Jana.

1715
01:48:53,559 --> 01:48:54,268
Jana.

1716
01:48:54,351 --> 01:48:55,268
Listen to me.

1717
01:48:55,351 --> 01:48:56,143
Jana.

1718
01:49:00,434 --> 01:49:01,101
Jana.

1719
01:49:01,351 --> 01:49:02,976
Leave him.

1720
01:49:07,851 --> 01:49:08,851
Jana.

1721
01:49:10,643 --> 01:49:13,143
Vicky.

1722
01:49:25,351 --> 01:49:26,518
Jana.

1723
01:49:32,018 --> 01:49:34,268
- Jana!
- Jana.

1724
01:49:46,101 --> 01:49:47,309
Vicky is missing.

1725
01:49:48,684 --> 01:49:49,393
Vicky.

1726
01:49:56,643 --> 01:49:57,643
Vicky.

1727
01:50:00,393 --> 01:50:01,101
Vicky.

1728
01:50:02,934 --> 01:50:03,684
Vicky isn't here.

1729
01:50:03,851 --> 01:50:04,601
He's not.

1730
01:50:05,726 --> 01:50:07,018
Where could he be?

1731
01:50:08,101 --> 01:50:10,809
Meaning Stree was here
and she took her lover.

1732
01:50:10,893 --> 01:50:11,851
Don't say that.

1733
01:50:11,934 --> 01:50:15,101
All our arrangements, the wedding
night preparations, didn't work.

1734
01:50:16,643 --> 01:50:19,934
Where did your sister take him?

1735
01:50:20,309 --> 01:50:23,226
- Vicky just sent a message, on WhatsApp.
- What?

1736
01:50:23,594 --> 01:50:25,018
He just shared his location.

1737
01:50:30,018 --> 01:50:31,101
Stree.

1738
01:50:34,559 --> 01:50:36,934
Where are you, Stree?

1739
01:50:52,893 --> 01:50:53,851
Stree, I...

1740
01:51:17,434 --> 01:51:20,601
Okay. Fine. I am sitting here.

1741
01:51:20,684 --> 01:51:21,976
I'm not going anywhere.

1742
01:51:22,934 --> 01:51:24,018
I am sitting right here.

1743
01:51:36,684 --> 01:51:37,726
This is the same place.

1744
01:51:37,809 --> 01:51:39,643
I guess she took him to the bedroom.

1745
01:51:40,018 --> 01:51:41,976
And she won't let him go until
she spends her wedding night with him.

1746
01:51:51,226 --> 01:51:52,184
Oh, God.

1747
01:51:59,143 --> 01:52:01,976
Stree... I am ready.

1748
01:52:03,601 --> 01:52:07,059
Come on this bed.
We'll spend our wedding night.

1749
01:52:11,393 --> 01:52:13,768
I am getting ready.
I am getting ready.

1750
01:52:19,143 --> 01:52:20,351
I'm taking it off.

1751
01:52:27,059 --> 01:52:28,646
Do I have to take my pants off too?

1752
01:52:29,393 --> 01:52:31,226
Fine, I'll take it off.

1753
01:52:35,893 --> 01:52:39,393
I am ready now. Come on.

1754
01:52:44,976 --> 01:52:46,143
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1755
01:52:46,226 --> 01:52:49,934
Sorry, Stree. I understand
that you've no interest in all this.

1756
01:52:50,059 --> 01:52:51,851
I respect you.

1757
01:52:53,101 --> 01:52:54,976
I'll even wear my clothes back.

1758
01:52:55,143 --> 01:52:56,976
See, I am wearing them back.

1759
01:52:57,226 --> 01:52:58,226
Don't kill me, Stree.

1760
01:52:58,309 --> 01:53:00,934
I am the only son.

1761
01:53:47,819 --> 01:53:48,726
Vicky!

1762
01:53:53,976 --> 01:53:55,018
Jana.

1763
01:53:57,434 --> 01:53:58,809
What happened?

1764
01:53:58,889 --> 01:53:59,851
Is she dead?

1765
01:54:00,184 --> 01:54:02,101
She is just powerless at the moment.

1766
01:54:02,184 --> 01:54:05,101
But we must finish her
before she gets her powers back.

1767
01:54:06,226 --> 01:54:07,101
Where are your clothes?

1768
01:54:08,184 --> 01:54:09,101
Sorry, I...

1769
01:54:09,351 --> 01:54:12,518
I thought in order to save the city,
I will have to sleep with her.

1770
01:54:13,559 --> 01:54:16,059
But you know what,
I don't think she wants any of it.

1771
01:54:17,768 --> 01:54:18,643
Here you go.

1772
01:54:19,143 --> 01:54:21,101
You must pierce her
heart with this dagger.

1773
01:54:21,184 --> 01:54:22,351
And cut off her braid.

1774
01:54:22,536 --> 01:54:23,309
Braid?

1775
01:54:23,393 --> 01:54:25,268
How did her braid get in all this?

1776
01:54:25,434 --> 01:54:26,976
And, how will I do this?

1777
01:54:27,059 --> 01:54:27,976
You do it, please.

1778
01:54:28,059 --> 01:54:30,684
I would've done it if I could.

1779
01:54:30,768 --> 01:54:31,601
You will have to do it.

1780
01:54:31,684 --> 01:54:32,976
You're the protector of the city.
Come on.

1781
01:54:33,059 --> 01:54:36,643
Yes, I know I am the protector,
but I am a tailor, not a killer.

1782
01:54:36,726 --> 01:54:37,601
Kill her before she wakes up again.

1783
01:54:37,684 --> 01:54:38,268
Take it.

1784
01:54:38,351 --> 01:54:39,684
- Come on.
- Yes.

1785
01:54:41,518 --> 01:54:42,226
Go.

1786
01:55:16,704 --> 01:55:17,976
Do we have to kill her?

1787
01:55:18,503 --> 01:55:20,143
Poor thing is lying
down so comfortably.

1788
01:55:20,351 --> 01:55:22,101
This is exactly how the
people of this city treated her.

1789
01:55:22,226 --> 01:55:23,226
And we're doing the same.

1790
01:55:23,685 --> 01:55:25,059
So what's the difference
between us and them?

1791
01:55:25,268 --> 01:55:26,518
She must have a reason.

1792
01:55:26,893 --> 01:55:28,976
She is trying to find her true love.

1793
01:55:29,976 --> 01:55:30,976
Let her go, please.

1794
01:55:32,226 --> 01:55:33,226
There must be another way.

1795
01:55:33,393 --> 01:55:35,309
Like lizard's tail, cockroach soup.

1796
01:55:40,268 --> 01:55:41,684
Then cut off her braid.

1797
01:55:42,143 --> 01:55:43,684
This will make her powerless.

1798
01:55:43,768 --> 01:55:44,643
And, she won't die either.

1799
01:55:45,521 --> 01:55:46,268
Okay.

1800
01:55:53,434 --> 01:55:55,018
- No, no, no.
- Look into her eyes.

1801
01:55:55,934 --> 01:55:56,976
Find the dagger.

1802
01:55:57,303 --> 01:55:58,601
Look. Look.

1803
01:55:59,772 --> 01:56:00,972
Vicky, open your eyes.

1804
01:56:01,052 --> 01:56:03,661
She won't do anything
if you look in her eyes.

1805
01:56:04,018 --> 01:56:05,101
It's not working.

1806
01:56:05,184 --> 01:56:05,938
She is hungry for love.

1807
01:56:06,018 --> 01:56:06,601
For love...

1808
01:56:06,684 --> 01:56:07,726
Look into her eyes with love.

1809
01:56:08,726 --> 01:56:09,559
Love.

1810
01:56:11,098 --> 01:56:12,018
Love.

1811
01:56:18,434 --> 01:56:19,393
Love...

1812
01:56:19,851 --> 01:56:21,393
More love, Vicky.

1813
01:56:21,518 --> 01:56:24,059
I am shitting in my pants,
and you want more feelings.

1814
01:56:25,976 --> 01:56:26,809
Quiet!

1815
01:56:28,643 --> 01:56:29,393
Quiet!

1816
01:56:30,393 --> 01:56:32,018
What is all this yelling for?

1817
01:56:32,309 --> 01:56:33,976
This is no way to take revenge.

1818
01:56:35,601 --> 01:56:37,559
I am the protector of the city,
so show some respect.

1819
01:56:38,809 --> 01:56:39,726
Always screaming.

1820
01:56:40,393 --> 01:56:41,143
Vicky.

1821
01:56:42,601 --> 01:56:43,226
Here.

1822
01:57:26,268 --> 01:57:27,309
Vicky.

1823
01:57:27,877 --> 01:57:29,309
Throw the braid away.

1824
01:57:32,309 --> 01:57:33,768
Are you okay?

1825
01:57:35,562 --> 01:57:36,851
Yes.

1826
01:57:36,934 --> 01:57:38,434
Dagger.

1827
01:57:42,268 --> 01:57:43,226
Sit up.

1828
01:57:43,309 --> 01:57:44,559
Get up.

1829
01:57:45,601 --> 01:57:47,268
Sit up straight.

1830
01:57:50,976 --> 01:57:52,893
- I think she's gone.
- Yes.

1831
01:57:52,976 --> 01:57:53,601
Isn't it?

1832
01:57:54,525 --> 01:57:57,067
She kept attacking her.

1833
01:57:57,525 --> 01:57:59,692
But I snuck up behind
her and cut off her braid.

1834
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:01,109
Then she disappeared.

1835
01:58:01,234 --> 01:58:01,817
And didn't come back.

1836
01:58:01,900 --> 01:58:03,317
But is the Stree dead or not?

1837
01:58:04,817 --> 01:58:05,567
Tell me.

1838
01:58:07,234 --> 01:58:09,234
Meaning she will come
back again next year.

1839
01:58:09,824 --> 01:58:13,817
- She's only hungry for one thing.
- No. it's two.

1840
01:58:14,150 --> 01:58:14,692
What?

1841
01:58:15,734 --> 01:58:19,067
Love and respect,
which this city never gave her.

1842
01:58:19,775 --> 01:58:21,359
And that was this
city's biggest mistake.

1843
01:58:22,150 --> 01:58:23,650
And we were going to
repeat the same mistake.

1844
01:58:25,567 --> 01:58:29,609
And if this city gives her
the respect, which she never received.

1845
01:58:30,650 --> 01:58:32,067
Then she might leave us alone.

1846
01:59:08,317 --> 01:59:14,317
These brave men together
have protected the city...

1847
01:59:14,734 --> 01:59:18,067
...and we will never
forget their contribution.

1848
01:59:18,317 --> 01:59:23,984
All the youngsters who went missing
in the last two days have returned.

1849
01:59:24,067 --> 01:59:25,817
Are you listening?

1850
01:59:38,734 --> 01:59:40,109
- There she is.
- Stop. Stop.

1851
01:59:40,609 --> 01:59:42,109
Sister-in-law.

1852
01:59:42,734 --> 01:59:44,650
The flower. The flower.

1853
01:59:44,730 --> 01:59:45,900
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1854
01:59:46,974 --> 01:59:50,109
Everyone was looking for you.

1855
01:59:53,109 --> 01:59:55,109
You wore the dress.

1856
01:59:55,977 --> 01:59:56,775
Does it fit well?

1857
01:59:57,693 --> 01:59:59,442
You took my measurements so well.

1858
02:00:01,567 --> 02:00:03,525
This is for you.

1859
02:00:03,804 --> 02:00:06,692
I could've never fought
against the Stree without you.

1860
02:00:08,072 --> 02:00:08,942
Thank you.

1861
02:00:11,484 --> 02:00:13,109
You are very nice, Vicky.

1862
02:00:13,724 --> 02:00:16,484
I wish we had met before, then
we could've become friends before.

1863
02:00:17,567 --> 02:00:18,817
Will you be my friend?

1864
02:00:21,984 --> 02:00:25,525
You mean friends, or...

1865
02:00:26,442 --> 02:00:28,817
Yes. Isn't that what friendship means?

1866
02:00:29,925 --> 02:00:30,655
No.

1867
02:00:30,864 --> 02:00:33,128
There's another meaning
for friendship in our town.

1868
02:00:44,752 --> 02:00:47,739
What if I want to talk to you,
or meet you?

1869
02:00:47,822 --> 02:00:49,155
I don't even have your number.

1870
02:00:50,655 --> 02:00:51,822
Just think of me.

1871
02:00:54,239 --> 02:00:56,155
Do you have to go?

1872
02:00:56,489 --> 02:00:58,030
Please wait for a few more days.

1873
02:00:59,012 --> 02:01:00,030
Please.

1874
02:01:01,447 --> 02:01:02,572
Vicky, please!

1875
02:01:17,489 --> 02:01:18,364
Name?

1876
02:01:18,447 --> 02:01:20,030
You didn't tell me your name...

1877
02:01:20,572 --> 02:01:24,197
This is my first time where he's smitten
by love but doesn't know her name.

1878
02:01:24,350 --> 02:01:25,609
Maybe this is true love.

1879
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:34,197
'For the past three years,
I had only one motive.'

1880
02:01:34,822 --> 02:01:36,072
'Defeating Stree.'

1881
02:01:36,739 --> 02:01:40,947
'I tried everything I knew,
but it wasn't enough.'

1882
02:01:41,739 --> 02:01:44,947
'There's always a method
to control any power.'

1883
02:01:45,655 --> 02:01:46,989
'Just cut off her braid.'

1884
02:01:47,239 --> 02:01:50,114
'She will become powerless,
and won't die.'

1885
02:02:07,614 --> 02:02:10,447
'I would've done
it long ago if I could.'

1886
02:02:10,530 --> 02:02:12,989
'You're the protector of the city,
you have to do it.'

1887
02:02:32,514 --> 02:02:36,139
ONE YEAR LATER.

1888
02:03:09,514 --> 02:03:12,097
O STREE PROTECT US.

1889
02:03:59,864 --> 02:04:00,697
"Music."

1890
02:04:16,155 --> 02:04:17,947
"Everyone's talking about you."

1891
02:04:18,030 --> 02:04:19,822
"They all know that you're an angel."

1892
02:04:19,905 --> 02:04:20,864
"You're hard to get..."

1893
02:04:20,947 --> 02:04:23,655
"...your poor beloved's been waiting."

1894
02:04:23,739 --> 02:04:25,575
"All I know is there's a cave..."

1895
02:04:25,655 --> 02:04:27,489
"...but the cave's hard to open."

1896
02:04:27,572 --> 02:04:29,364
"No matter what I do,
but you're never impressed..."

1897
02:04:29,489 --> 02:04:31,489
"...your beloved's
been wandering around."

1898
02:04:31,655 --> 02:04:33,489
"I've played all the shots right."

1899
02:04:33,572 --> 02:04:35,280
"And seen have all slots."

1900
02:04:35,364 --> 02:04:38,905
"But I haven't hit
the jackpot yet, but..."

1901
02:04:39,322 --> 02:04:41,155
"You'll get it... You'll get it."

1902
02:04:41,239 --> 02:04:43,072
"You'll get it..."

1903
02:04:43,155 --> 02:04:44,614
"I'll get it too."

1904
02:04:44,697 --> 02:04:46,534
"The miracle's going to happen."

1905
02:04:46,614 --> 02:04:48,780
"You'll get it... You'll get it."

1906
02:04:48,864 --> 02:04:50,614
"You'll get it..."

1907
02:04:50,697 --> 02:04:52,239
"Someday we'll all get it."

1908
02:04:52,322 --> 02:04:54,197
"Be patient my friend."

1909
02:05:17,030 --> 02:05:17,947
"I warned you before..."

1910
02:05:18,030 --> 02:05:18,905
"I warned you before..."

1911
02:05:18,989 --> 02:05:19,864
"She will come draped in a saree..."

1912
02:05:19,947 --> 02:05:20,822
"Draped in a saree..."

1913
02:05:20,905 --> 02:05:22,239
"And come for your..."

1914
02:05:22,775 --> 02:05:24,614
"Heart... Your heart... Your heart..."

1915
02:05:24,697 --> 02:05:26,530
"She comes alone."

1916
02:05:26,614 --> 02:05:28,447
"When she comes along."

1917
02:05:28,530 --> 02:05:32,239
"Just meet me."

1918
02:05:32,642 --> 02:05:34,575
"Meet me in my dreams."

1919
02:05:34,655 --> 02:05:36,489
"Meet me completely decked up."

1920
02:05:39,447 --> 02:05:40,239
"Because..."

1921
02:05:40,322 --> 02:05:42,072
"You'll get it... You'll get it."

1922
02:05:42,155 --> 02:05:43,614
"You'll get it..."

1923
02:05:44,072 --> 02:05:45,534
"I'll get it too."

1924
02:05:45,614 --> 02:05:47,447
"The miracle's going to happen."

1925
02:05:47,530 --> 02:05:49,364
"You'll get it... You'll get it."

1926
02:05:49,489 --> 02:05:51,575
"You'll get it..."

1927
02:05:51,655 --> 02:05:53,197
"Someday we'll all get it."

1928
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:55,114
"Be patient my friend."
