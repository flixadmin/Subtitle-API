1
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:35,472
Hi. Welcome to Endless Pasta Week
at Tony Cicero's.

2
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:38,141
Where the fuck am I?

3
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:39,434
You're at Tony Cicero's.

4
00:01:39,518 --> 00:01:41,645
No. What fucking city am I in?

5
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:43,230
Uh, Fort Wayne.

6
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:47,651
Oh, fuck. You got a bit of paper,
something I could write with?

7
00:01:47,734 --> 00:01:48,944
- A pen, anything.
- Uh...

8
00:01:49,695 --> 00:01:50,779
Ah, ah.

9
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:59,746
<i>...closed at 10% below
its record high set last month.</i>

10
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:04,001
<i>Federal authorities
have initiated a multistate manhunt</i>

11
00:02:04,084 --> 00:02:06,795
<i>for William Butcher
for allegedly murdering</i>

12
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:09,298
<i>Vought vice president Madelyn Stillwell,</i>

13
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:12,384
<i>as well as endangering
her infant son, Theodore.</i>

14
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:16,972
<i>Law enforcement officials have set up
a tipline and are urging anyone</i>

15
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:20,600
<i>with information regarding
the suspect's whereabouts...</i>

16
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:47,753
Boy, girl...

17
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:57,971
I'm sorry. I do not understand.

18
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:07,481
All right, I'm off.

19
00:03:07,564 --> 00:03:08,648
Where you going?

20
00:03:08,732 --> 00:03:10,150
Going to meet a contact.

21
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:12,861
- Who?
- Someone who can help us

22
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:14,780
find this Supe terrorist cunt.

23
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:17,657
Who is the contact?
What is their actual name?

24
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:22,704
- You'll love it.
- No, I won't. I won't love it.

25
00:03:22,788 --> 00:03:25,040
I never love it. I never fucking love it.

26
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:30,128
- Noted.
- Not a word from him.

27
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:32,798
He left us for dead,
and now it's like nothing happened?

28
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:42,474
You're right. I am sorry.

29
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:47,104
Sorry that I trusted this lot
was smart enough to save themselves

30
00:03:47,187 --> 00:03:50,315
- like they've done a hundred times before.
- Okay, well, where you been?

31
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:52,692
Well, technically, I called him back.

32
00:03:52,776 --> 00:03:54,861
He blew up Madelyn Stillwell.

33
00:03:54,945 --> 00:03:58,490
I told you. She was already dead
when I blew her up.

34
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:01,701
Oh. Great. Cool. Totally.

35
00:04:01,785 --> 00:04:03,870
We're just gonna pretend
like this is normal?

36
00:04:03,954 --> 00:04:05,205
Like we're fucking lemmings?

37
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:18,427
Well, who else they gonna follow?

38
00:04:26,476 --> 00:04:27,476
Right.

39
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:44,953
Hey. You know, my dad?

40
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:50,167
He had a ball from the '56 World Series
signed by Don Larsen himself.

41
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,210
Pitched a no-hitter in game five.

42
00:04:52,294 --> 00:04:54,337
- Really?
- Pretty cool, huh?

43
00:04:56,256 --> 00:04:57,256
Oh.

44
00:04:58,049 --> 00:05:01,595
That's okay. Uh, you'll get the next one.

45
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:03,472
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

46
00:05:03,555 --> 00:05:05,307
Yeah, I'll get the next one.

47
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:11,688
Okay. Ryan.

48
00:05:12,772 --> 00:05:13,940
Use your powers.

49
00:05:14,024 --> 00:05:15,233
What do you mean?

50
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:23,742
I can't do that.

51
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:26,870
Yes, you can. You're my son.

52
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:33,418
Has anyone told you
what you're capable of?

53
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,463
No.

54
00:05:39,299 --> 00:05:41,718
Well, then it's about time you found out.

55
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:45,805
Ryan. Come on, math time, buddy.
Chapters 12 and 13 in your workbook.

56
00:05:46,765 --> 00:05:49,851
Yeah. Math, yeah. Sorry, I forgot.

57
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:52,646
It's your favourite.
I'll be in in a minute.

58
00:05:53,772 --> 00:05:56,942
When I was his age,
I was breaking the sound barrier.

59
00:05:58,276 --> 00:06:00,195
He can't even throw a fastball.

60
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:04,449
We thought it was best that he have
as ordinary of a childhood as possible.

61
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:05,533
We?

62
00:06:07,244 --> 00:06:08,328
Who's we?

63
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:11,039
Look, I just want my kid to be normal.

64
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:14,668
Then it's a good thing I'm here.

65
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:18,421
Because my son
is the furthest fucking thing

66
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:20,549
on this planet to a normal boy.

67
00:06:20,632 --> 00:06:22,384
How long are you planning on staying?

68
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:25,804
Becca...

69
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:27,556
we had a deal.

70
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:33,562
A deal that is alive and well and running
around as free as a goddamn bird.

71
00:06:33,645 --> 00:06:38,733
So let's just try and be civil, shall we?

72
00:06:57,711 --> 00:06:59,004
Did I get them right?

73
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:06,720
There's... There's no correct
or incorrect answer.

74
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:07,846
Oh.

75
00:07:10,807 --> 00:07:12,142
What is missing here?

76
00:07:16,688 --> 00:07:17,981
Uh...

77
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:24,946
Deep. How do you expect
to be welcomed back into The Seven

78
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,865
if you can't be honest with yourself?

79
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:29,284
Carol, if I'm being honest...

80
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:31,828
...I don't know what the fuck
you want from me.

81
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,791
Hey, guys. How's it going?

82
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:38,835
Can I have a word?

83
00:07:41,546 --> 00:07:44,507
I don't mean to be negative,
but his operating perspective

84
00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:46,718
is functionally non-existent.

85
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,137
I don't think there's a path here.

86
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:51,348
Leave it to me.

87
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,144
You're just inhibited
by suppressive energy.

88
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:59,064
That's it. Just gotta realign things.

89
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,441
What is it, shrooms?

90
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:04,319
Last time I did shrooms
was at a Goo Goo Dolls concert

91
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:06,696
with some poli-sci chick from Oberlin.

92
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:11,660
I guess I call it more of a gateway.

93
00:08:21,461 --> 00:08:23,171
Are you not gonna drink any?

94
00:08:23,797 --> 00:08:26,549
No. Deep, this is your journey.

95
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,808
Who's revving up
the girl power in The Seven?

96
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:36,851
Keep watching WDCS,

97
00:08:36,935 --> 00:08:40,063
Cleveland's first and best source
for local news.

98
00:08:40,146 --> 00:08:42,649
Quiet, please. Going again.
On the bell. Rolling.

99
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:44,317
Where should I start?

100
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:47,070
Are you ready to meet
the newest member of The Seven?

101
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:49,072
See it here first, WFAK...

102
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:51,449
- KMFT... WDCS...
- Cut.

103
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:54,369
- Quiet. Still rolling.
- She's the newest member of The Seven,

104
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:55,954
and she's taking America by storm.

105
00:08:56,037 --> 00:08:59,749
From Portland to Seattle,
watch what comes next, KMFT.

106
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:05,380
Amazing. Do you need to take
a break, or can we power through the rest?

107
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:06,589
Let's just power through.

108
00:09:06,673 --> 00:09:09,342
Turn this way! Look here!

109
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:11,094
Over here. Give us a shot!

110
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:12,177
Gorgeous.

111
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,892
Stormfront, show us what you got.

112
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:24,774
Okay, ladies, we have a big day.

113
00:09:24,858 --> 00:09:27,527
Domestic outlets until noon,
ten minutes each.

114
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,113
Foreign until 2. Roundtables until 4.

115
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:31,614
Print one-on-ones until 6...

116
00:09:31,698 --> 00:09:35,034
If she vibrates any faster,
that stick up her ass is gonna explode.

117
00:09:38,955 --> 00:09:39,998
Hello?

118
00:09:44,753 --> 00:09:45,795
What?

119
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:47,839
When?

120
00:09:51,468 --> 00:09:53,470
Okay. Thank you.

121
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:57,098
...positive, we're going female,
thoughtful but upbeat...

122
00:09:57,182 --> 00:09:58,767
- Where...? What?
- I gotta go.

123
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,644
- What? No.
- I'm sorry. Family emergency.

124
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:03,062
Is everything okay?

125
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:06,107
We've never had three women
in The Seven before. This is a moment.

126
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:07,817
Girls get it done. You're not...

127
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:12,405
I have a family emergency too.

128
00:10:14,032 --> 00:10:16,075
<i>A reading
from the book of Revelations.</i>

129
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:19,078
"And God shall wipe away all the tears
from their eyes

130
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:20,580
and there will be no more death."

131
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:23,708
Today, we say goodbye to Susan Raynor.

132
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:27,587
For though her body rests,
her soul lives on for all eternity,

133
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:32,258
and one day you will think of Susan
with joy as well as sadness.

134
00:10:32,342 --> 00:10:35,595
They are two sides of a coin
you will carry forever.

135
00:10:36,221 --> 00:10:41,768
And you are blessed to have your family
and your friends to help you carry it.

136
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:44,145
In the name of Christ, amen.

137
00:10:53,613 --> 00:10:59,035
You think you can surprise me?
I literally taught you this one.

138
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,456
Hello, Grace.

139
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:06,626
You promised I'd never see you again.

140
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:11,381
I promised not to come
to your house again.

141
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:16,845
A subtle but important distinction.

142
00:11:16,928 --> 00:11:19,389
I assume you sent the Edible Arrangement.

143
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:23,017
Deluxe Bereavement Bouquet with
white chocolate-dipped pineapple doves.

144
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:25,728
Raynor would've loved that.

145
00:11:29,232 --> 00:11:30,525
Oi, where you going?

146
00:11:30,608 --> 00:11:33,862
There are about two dozen federal officers
in the church next door.

147
00:11:34,404 --> 00:11:37,073
I'm gonna turn you in for the murder
of Madelyn Stillwell.

148
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:39,701
Oh, come off it, Grace.
You really think I done that?

149
00:11:39,784 --> 00:11:41,494
You really want me to answer that?

150
00:11:42,662 --> 00:11:44,372
I know who killed Raynor.

151
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,460
Who?

152
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:55,133
Okay, well, I don't specifically,
technically have the answer to that,

153
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:56,509
but I know how to get it.

154
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,306
We think Vought killed her
for getting too close to something.

155
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:02,515
Getting too close to what?

156
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:05,018
Something to do with a Supe terrorist
smuggled into Jersey

157
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:07,270
a couple of nights ago.
And that is where we start.

158
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:10,857
Honestly, it's like asking a cockroach
to not be a cockroach.

159
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,150
It's just your nature.

160
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:13,985
I know what she meant to you, all right?

161
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:17,488
We find this terrorist, and we're one step
closer to finding out who offed her.

162
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:20,283
I'm not getting back in.
And if I were, which I'm not,

163
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:21,951
it sure as shit wouldn't be for you.

164
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:26,539
I ain't asking you all the way back in.
Just dip in a little toe, yeah?

165
00:12:27,123 --> 00:12:29,709
Maybe two. Not for me, for Raynor.

166
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:33,212
You never gave a shit about Susan.
You're only here because you're desperate,

167
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:34,881
fucked, and you want something.

168
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:40,178
All right, fuck it. Grace, Grace!
Grace, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

169
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,555
I'll level with you, okay?

170
00:12:44,474 --> 00:12:45,600
Just hear me out.

00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,041
Hey!

180
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,087
In here. Open up.

181
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:29,852
Bro, we gotta talk.

182
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:34,440
No, you gotta look at us.

183
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:37,193
Look at us!

184
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,450
Okay.

185
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:48,538
Remember Melissa Dabrowski?

186
00:13:48,621 --> 00:13:52,875
The kindergarten teacher you fingerbanged
backstage at the VH1 Educator Awards?

187
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,127
So what?

188
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,921
You were supposed to present her
with Teacher of the Year,

189
00:13:57,005 --> 00:13:59,674
but you bailed while she was pulling
her panties back on.

190
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:02,135
Yeah, because she laughed at me.

191
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:05,096
Bullshit. She just put
her hands on your chest.

192
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,681
You never even unzipped your suit.

193
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:07,849
She would've laughed.

194
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:11,352
Because that's what you do.
You imagine women will laugh at us,

195
00:14:11,436 --> 00:14:13,104
so you humiliate them first.

196
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:14,689
No, that's not true.

197
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:18,234
You can't accept your own body,
so you violate theirs.

198
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:19,317
Sh...

199
00:14:19,986 --> 00:14:22,530
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

200
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,159
Hey, hey. Hey.

201
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,121
- Let me out!
- You can't swim from us forever.

202
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:32,582
You shut the fuck up,
you ugly pieces of shit.

203
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:34,292
I have nothing else to say to you.

204
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,669
We won't let you shut
us up anymore, Kevin.

205
00:14:36,753 --> 00:14:42,675
Hey, hey. Hey. Let me out, man.
Just let me out! Eagle!

206
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:46,054
Let me out, man!

207
00:14:46,137 --> 00:14:47,263
Ride it, brother.

208
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:14,040
What are you doing here?

209
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:17,919
Apparently, your work...

210
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:22,131
still has Maggie Shaw
as your emergency contact.

211
00:15:22,215 --> 00:15:24,634
Ah, shit. Sorry.

212
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:25,717
That's okay.

213
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:30,848
Where else would I score this sweet jelly?

214
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:35,937
I thought it was bad <i>unagi.</i>

215
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:39,190
Turns out my appendix was about to burst.

216
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:42,527
Well, there are easier ways
to get my attention.

217
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:46,781
I kept thinking you'd call.

218
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:50,326
Yeah. Me too.

219
00:15:51,911 --> 00:15:53,996
You want me to call your mom?

220
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,332
Definitely not.

221
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:01,003
Someone else, like a girlfriend or...?

222
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:05,967
Seriously? Thanks for coming, but I'm sure
you have more important places to be.

223
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,928
Hey. You could die
from something like this.

224
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:11,597
But I didn't.
So I guess you don't need to save me.

225
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:14,475
Yeah, well, I still wanna see the doctor.

226
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,937
Maeve, I'm fine. I promise.

227
00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:28,114
You know, watching <i>Botched</i>
doesn't make you a fucking medical expert.

228
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:32,493
I'll wait a while. Let's just see, okay?

229
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:37,165
Can we get this middle chair out of here,
please? Somebody? Thank you.

230
00:16:37,248 --> 00:16:39,667
Can we get the two on the side
just smushed together?

231
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,751
We lost one of them.

232
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:42,670
Okay, resetting, one background.

233
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:44,547
- People, quiet on the set.
- Rolling.

234
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:48,384
Stormfront, congrats on The Seven.
Are you as excited to be here as I am?

235
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:50,511
I don't know.
I don't think so.

236
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:53,848
Can you tell us a little
about how girls get it done?

237
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:55,993
- ...girls get it done?
- ...girls get it done?

238
00:16:56,017 --> 00:16:58,436
- ...girls get it done?
- Let's dish boys.

239
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:01,856
- Starlight, single or spoken for?
- Uh, single, single. Single.

240
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:05,067
Uh, single. Definitely single.

241
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:07,778
Tell us how fun it is
to have all this girl power.

242
00:17:08,404 --> 00:17:10,239
Can you repeat that but say,

243
00:17:10,323 --> 00:17:12,491
"Strong is the new pretty"
right at the end?

244
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:15,328
Do girls make better heroes?

245
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:17,330
Do girls make
better heroes than boys?

246
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:19,832
Do girls make better heroes?

247
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,667
Look, uh, no offence.

248
00:17:21,751 --> 00:17:23,252
I get you have your talking points,

249
00:17:23,336 --> 00:17:26,297
but why does it matter
whether heroes have a dick or a vag?

250
00:17:26,923 --> 00:17:30,760
I mean, shouldn't we all just,
you know, be competent at our jobs?

251
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,847
I don't think girls do anything better.
Chicks and dicks are in it together.

252
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Oh, that's me.

253
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:44,649
Sorry, Ashy.

254
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:47,193
Vought won't let me have pockets
in this thing.

255
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,489
You can see every crease in my ass.
You can see up Starlight's uterus.

256
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:54,909
You wanna talk about girl power?
Let's talk about getting some pockets.

257
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:59,372
Starlight, your teammate A-Train
has been out of the public eye.

258
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:00,413
Mm-hm.

259
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:04,878
Vought recently revealed that he was
on a top-secret mission in Kandahar.

260
00:18:04,961 --> 00:18:07,588
- Are you worried about him?
- Yeah, of course.

261
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:10,049
I pray for him every night.

262
00:18:11,634 --> 00:18:15,304
America really is lucky to have
such a brave hero fighting for them.

263
00:18:15,388 --> 00:18:18,349
What if I told you he's right behind you?

264
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:24,146
Hey! Here comes the A-Train!
What's up?

265
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,941
- Wow.
- All right. Yeah.

266
00:18:30,236 --> 00:18:32,154
- Wow, welcome back.
- Thanks.

267
00:18:32,238 --> 00:18:33,864
Thank you. Mm.

268
00:18:33,948 --> 00:18:36,242
Stormfront, you know,
it is such an honour to meet you.

269
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:38,911
- I'm a huge fan. Don't get up.
- Feeling's mutual.

270
00:18:38,995 --> 00:18:40,955
No, yeah.
I'm just gonna relax for a second.

271
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:42,415
Let me get a chair or something.

272
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:45,876

278
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,521
- Fan-fucking-tastic.
- That's great.

279
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:07,356
We were really worried about you.

280
00:19:10,735 --> 00:19:12,445

- Nope.

I want that shit.

284

00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:34,675
- You know?
- Totally.

287
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:39,305
They told me you came by my room
every day to pray for me.

288
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:44,310
- Thank you.
- Mm. You're so welcome.

289
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:47,646
Yeah, I think that prayer
really does help.

290
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:51,734
- Anyway...
- Mm-hm.

291
00:19:52,318 --> 00:19:56,113
You should know that everyone thinks
it was a really good idea

292
00:19:56,197 --> 00:19:58,282
that you called me in
for backup that night.

293
00:19:58,366 --> 00:20:02,453
I mean, what would've happened
if I hadn't been there to give you CPR?

294
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:04,580
Hmm.

295
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:07,583
- That's good to know.
- Mm.

296
00:20:11,212 --> 00:20:14,715
How does everyone feel about you helping
your traitor fucking boyfriend escape?

297
00:20:16,342 --> 00:20:18,010
Or maybe you didn't mention that part.

298
00:20:25,393 --> 00:20:26,393

303

Colonel Mallory?

304
00:21:20,156 --> 00:21:21,072
You saw her?

00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:25,287
That's right, Frenchie.
She's gonna help us.

306

We get her the Supe terrorist,

307
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,332
and she's gonna get the CIA
to scrub our records clean.

315
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:18,964
Ahh.

316
00:22:19,632 --> 00:22:22,801
Melissa Dabrowski was more
than just another fingerbang, you know?

317
00:22:22,885 --> 00:22:26,555
No, no, no. It's not fucking happening.
It's not fucking real.

318
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:31,060
The way she looked at you.
She was sweet, smart.

319
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:32,937
Girl like that, you could've been happy.

320
00:22:34,772 --> 00:22:36,190
You deserve to be loved.

321
00:22:39,485 --> 00:22:40,861
Don't fuck with me.

322
00:22:40,945 --> 00:22:44,782
You deserve to be loved, Kevin.
But that starts with you.

323
00:22:45,366 --> 00:22:46,784
Don't fuck with me.

324
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:49,954
Take a look. A real look.

325
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:52,872
Go on.

326
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:16,730
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

327
00:23:16,814 --> 00:23:18,190
I'm the ugly one.

328
00:23:18,274 --> 00:23:20,150
- No.
- Yes.

329
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,987
On the inside.

330
00:23:25,698 --> 00:23:28,284
You just don't see what I see.

331
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:44,174
<i>♪ You are so beautiful ♪</i>

332
00:23:47,428 --> 00:23:48,428
No.

348
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:07,257
So in short, do not waste
your hard-earned cash

349
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:09,843
on this shitty, big-titted hunk of plastic

350
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:13,305
that'll end up in a manatee's belly
when your kid chucks it in the garbage.

351
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,140
Hey, um...

352
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:18,644
I just gotta say...

353
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:22,564
I really like everything
that you've been saying about Vought.

354
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:23,941
Yeah, okay, cool.

355
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:27,111
No, I mean, I agree with you.

356
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,989
- You wearing a wire or something?
- What? What does that have to...?

357
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:33,826
Look, I mean this
in the nicest possible way,

358
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:37,246
but I don't need some fucking
Vought-spy Barbie sniffing around

359
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:38,831
to see whether I'm a team player.

360
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:43,001
What? That is not at all what I am.

361
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:46,171
I used to be a fan. But look at you.

362
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:49,299
You're like the Voughtiest Vought
in all Vought.

363
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:59,017
I think, uh, Cyclops Dude's
trying to get your attention.

364
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:03,981
What happened to your eye?

365
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:08,193
Oh, Vought is testing a new volumising
dry shampoo for eye irritation.

366
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:09,445
As if you give a fuck.

367
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:13,741
Here. I brought you a sample.

368
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:20,122
Are you kidding me?
I can't take this right now.

369
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:21,957
I can't get away from this press junket.

370
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,711
- I literally have no pockets.
- You wanted the V, here it is.

371
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:29,173
If you threaten me again,
I'll make sure everyone knows you took it.

372
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:36,597
- You tight with Gecko?
- Hey.

373
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,601
Yeah, uh, from Capes for Christ,
back in the day.

374
00:26:41,143 --> 00:26:43,145
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

375
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:46,356
- What'd you just put in your boot?
- What? Nothing.

376
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:51,445
'Cause it looked like
you just put something in your boot.

377
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:55,783
Why don't you tell me what's in my boot?

378
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:05,417
<i>Stormfront and Starlight,
signing autographs...</i>

379
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:19,932
Maybe you shouldn't be hitting the Cristal
with your buddies quite so soon.

380
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:22,266
Come on.

381
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:25,813
Let's finish dick-tickling these half-wits
so we can finally do our real job.

382
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:30,566
Shall we?

383
00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:38,242
All right, kiddo. Here we are.

384
00:27:38,826 --> 00:27:40,369
- Have a great lesson.
- Yep.

385
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:46,917
Okay. I'll be back in an hour.
I'm gonna have coffee with Miss Bird.

386
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,294
Yep. Um...

387
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:51,380
Thanks. Bye.

388
00:27:51,964 --> 00:27:53,841
Hi, Ryan. How are you?

389
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,441
Open the door.

390
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:55,777
- Open the fucking door!
- Please get back inside the car.

391
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:57,613
I want to talk to Dr Park.

392
00:28:57,696 --> 00:28:58,697
Go back inside the car.

393
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,741
Goddamn it! Dr Park, now!

394
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:08,707
- <i>Hey, Becca.</i>
- What the fuck is going on?

395
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,876
<i>I understand this is upsetting.</i>

396
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:13,337
I was told I would never
have to see him ever again,

397
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,213
that he would never know
about Ryan or me.

398
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:16,298
That was the deal.

399
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:19,468
<i>Homelander is quite upset that this
information was concealed from him.</i>

400
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:22,512
<i>Corporate has made a decision
not to antagonise him further.</i>

401
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:25,015
You need to make him leave.

402
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:28,810
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna take Ryan and I'm gonna run,

403
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:31,688
and you'll never fucking find us
ever again.

404
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:34,066
<i>I think we both know
that that's not possible.</i>

405
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:38,487
You have to protect us.

406
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:42,699
You have... You have to move us, please.

407
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:43,699
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

408
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,704
<i>Now that he knows, there's no putting
the toothpaste back in the tube.</i>

409
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:49,706
<i>You should probably be getting back.
Piano lessons are almost done.</i>

410
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:51,750
<i>Just keep him calm.</i>

411
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,378
<i>Our best guess,
he'll get bored and move on.</i>

412
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,922
You... You don't know that.

413
00:29:58,507 --> 00:29:59,507
You don't.

414
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:10,727
Do I get to keep this?

415
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:13,146
Maybe. What will you trade me for it?

416
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,693
I will let you take me out to dinner.

417
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:22,822
Right.

418
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,952
I forgot. We'll need to order in.
Keep it low-pro.

419
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,747
Maeve, what are you doing here
if nothing has changed?

420
00:30:31,707 --> 00:30:33,333
Oh, Christ.

421
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:37,713
The last thing that woman needs
is another nose job.

422
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:40,257
Okay, we've done this dance, thanks.

423
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,385
- Elena.
- It's time to go.

424
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:05,240
Homelander and I went to this Oscar party
for <i>12 Years a Slave.</i>

425
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:06,533
There was this producer.

426
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:09,578
He swapped place cards
so he could sit next to me.

427
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:12,456
And he chatted me up all night.

428
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:15,083
Two days later,
there's a fire in his office.

429
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:17,711
They found his head in one room...

430
00:31:19,212 --> 00:31:21,298
and his torso in another.

431
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,468
What are you saying?

432
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:28,472
I don't want him to do that to you.

433
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:30,097
Who?

434
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:37,022
Homelander?

435
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:41,109
You think Homelander did that?

436
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:44,863
The things that I've watched him do...

437
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:50,911
the things that he made me do...

438
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:58,835
If he ever finds out about you...

439
00:32:02,964 --> 00:32:04,966
Why are you telling me this now?

440
00:32:12,808 --> 00:32:14,851
I don't want you to hate me anymore.

441
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:19,648
Cool. Thank you.

442
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:22,191
You're welcome.

443
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:25,195
It's crazy
you don't have one already, actually.

444
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:27,823
I don't really have anyone
to call, though.

445
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,534
Well, you can call me.

446
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:38,959
You know, Ryan, um, when I was your age,
I didn't have many friends, either.

447
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:42,546
Mom says being lonely
makes you know yourself better.

448
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:46,341
Well, that's not wrong, I suppose.

449
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:53,473
Can I tell you a secret?
Man-to-man? You know?

450
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:10,198
My dad and I, we never played catch
in the yard with a World Series ball.

451
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:12,951
Truth is...

452
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:15,912
I never had a dad.

453
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:18,372
Or a mom.

454
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:22,419
Wait, you didn't?

455
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:29,301
See, sometimes it's hard, Ryan,

456
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:34,389
being superior to every single
other person on the planet.

457
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:36,933
It's isolating.

458
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:41,855
And gods should not have to feel
that kind of...

459
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:44,691
you know, pain.

460
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:50,405
Because that is what we are, Ryan.

461
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:55,368
You and me...

462
00:33:58,496 --> 00:33:59,623
we're gods.

463
00:34:03,835 --> 00:34:07,672
Son, we can do anything we want,

464
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,425
and no one can stop us.

465
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:12,761
Now, that...

466
00:34:14,512 --> 00:34:16,056
That's a good feeling.

467
00:34:17,307 --> 00:34:18,934
A really good feeling.

468
00:34:20,727 --> 00:34:22,312
And now

469
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:28,193
you and me can share it together.

470
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:34,031
I...

471
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:36,534
I should probably go to bed now, you know?

472
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,410
Sure.

473
00:34:51,174 --> 00:34:52,384
I love you, son.

474
00:34:54,886 --> 00:34:56,930
Now you say it back.

475
00:34:57,514 --> 00:35:00,642
Um, I love you too.

476
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:03,979
This is nice.

477
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:18,201
- Your turn, Mom.
- You need to leave.

478
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:20,494
Excuse me?

479
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:23,081
You need to get the fuck out of my house.

480
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:31,881
What happens one day

481
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:36,594
when Ryan asks
to go to a baseball game,

482
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:39,597
swim in the ocean,
or eat at a Burger King?

483
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:46,187
How is he gonna feel when he finds out
that you've lied to him his whole life?

484
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:54,988
Think he's gonna be happy
that you kept him in this pretty prison?

485
00:35:57,866 --> 00:36:02,329
Or... do you think
he'll fucking despise you?

486
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:05,039
Hmm?

487
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:08,501
Let's go ask him.

488
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:11,003
Don't.

489
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,051
You were right.

490
00:36:17,886 --> 00:36:19,971
I'm not gonna get bored and move on.

491
00:36:21,473 --> 00:36:22,766
I'm not going anywhere.

492
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:26,728
So feel free to tell Dr Park
to go fuck himself.

493
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:34,736
How about some Jiffy Pop?

494
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:43,578
Halothane shot.

495
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:45,747
I only got two of these, so...

496
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:48,083
Well, we better make it count.

497
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:50,627
What if it doesn't work
on the terrorist inside?

498
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,462
Then we're right and well fucked.

499
00:37:10,313 --> 00:37:11,313
Are you okay?

500
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:35,106
Shining Light Liberation Army.

501
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:38,985
The ones who kidnapped you?

502
00:38:40,445 --> 00:38:41,696
You know this man?

503
00:38:44,824 --> 00:38:46,409
What is going on?

504
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:49,912
Kimiko?

505
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:42,549
Mouse.

506
00:39:42,632 --> 00:39:46,594
I never thought I'd see you again.

507
00:39:46,678 --> 00:39:48,763
Boy and girl.

508
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:50,807
Her brother.

509
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:53,935
That's what she was trying to tell me.

510
00:40:01,901 --> 00:40:05,238
Butcher, wait, wait, wait.
It's her brother.

511
00:40:42,817 --> 00:40:43,817
Kimiko!

512
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:48,989
Wait!

513
00:41:00,376 --> 00:41:01,461
Hey.

514
00:41:03,087 --> 00:41:04,380
You don't know me.

515
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:06,090
I'm not a sellout.

516
00:41:06,174 --> 00:41:09,385
Oh, okay. Cool. Congratulations.

517
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,265
Oh, come on.
Why do you care what I think?

518
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:20,438
Maybe I want to say everything
that you're saying about Vought.

519
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:22,023
Maybe I think Vought's...

520
00:41:28,237 --> 00:41:29,447
What? What's Vought?

521
00:41:32,325 --> 00:41:35,703
Oh, my God.
Everyone is so fucking stage-managed.

522
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:39,582
Life isn't actually a PR strategy.
You can say what you think.

523
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:41,167
What if it's not safe?

524
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:45,046
You are literally bulletproof.
What the fuck is gonna happen?

525
00:41:47,131 --> 00:41:48,049
Okay.

526
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,760
Who's the greatest superhero of all time?

527
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:52,804
Hmm. Homelander?

528
00:41:52,887 --> 00:41:55,264
No. Pippi Longstocking.

529
00:41:56,683 --> 00:41:58,559
Pippi Longstocking,
she's a 9-year-old girl,

530
00:41:58,643 --> 00:42:00,436
lived in a house all by herself?

531
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,522
Pet monkey?
Could lift a horse with one hand?

532
00:42:02,605 --> 00:42:04,357
You haven't read Pippi Longstocking?

533
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:06,066
I guess not.

534
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:07,067
Hmm.

535
00:42:07,902 --> 00:42:11,364
Okay, well, I used to dress as her
every Halloween,

536
00:42:11,447 --> 00:42:14,283
and all the girls dressed
like Disney sluts would make fun of me.

537
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:17,995
And you know what I thought?
I thought, "Who fucking cares?"

538
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,709
Pippi didn't care. She never cared
about being polite or cute.

539
00:42:24,252 --> 00:42:25,252
Look.

540
00:42:26,087 --> 00:42:29,716
Fuck this world
for confusing nice with good.

541
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:34,595
Be a bitch if you want. Be whatever.
Just drop the mask once in a while.

542
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:35,763
Feels good.

543
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:37,890
You can finally breathe.

544
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:46,858
Oh, and if someone sticks a dick
in your mouth, bite it off.

545
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,154
Pippi Longstocking would bite a D.

546
00:42:51,237 --> 00:42:52,822
That's for damn sure.

547
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:04,541
<i>Butcher!</i>

548
00:43:05,168 --> 00:43:06,544
Hold on, <i>mon ami.</i>

549
00:43:07,628 --> 00:43:09,547
- Give me your hand.
- Okay.

550
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:28,524
No. No, Butcher! No. Easy, easy, Butcher.

551
00:43:28,608 --> 00:43:30,943
The CIA would have locked him up
in a black box forever.

552
00:43:31,027 --> 00:43:33,571
- She'd never have seen her brother again.
- Easy!

553
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:36,783
Both of you, please. Not now.

554
00:43:41,954 --> 00:43:42,954
Right.

555
00:43:49,587 --> 00:43:50,671
You...

556
00:43:51,756 --> 00:43:54,217
fuck off.

557
00:43:58,387 --> 00:43:59,472
The rest, you're with me.

558
00:44:05,686 --> 00:44:08,314
Well, come on. Don't piss about.
We ain't got all night.

559
00:44:13,903 --> 00:44:15,321
The fuck you waiting for?

560
00:44:27,834 --> 00:44:29,168
Are you telling me

561
00:44:30,378 --> 00:44:33,464
that her family is worth more to you
than you seeing your own?

562
00:44:33,548 --> 00:44:34,549
No.

563
00:44:35,091 --> 00:44:36,133
I'm not.

564
00:44:37,593 --> 00:44:40,805
But Kimiko is one of us.

565
00:44:42,557 --> 00:44:43,850
I'll find another way.

566
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:46,978
I suppose you agree, don't you?

567
00:44:47,061 --> 00:44:49,522
Since your tongue is halfway up her ass.

568
00:44:49,605 --> 00:44:50,523
Jesus.

569
00:44:50,524 --> 00:44:53,776
It's like Hughie's infected you both
with a raging case of vagina!

570
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:10,251
Becca's alive.

571
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,960
What?

572
00:45:15,214 --> 00:45:18,217
She's alive.
Vought's holding her captive somewhere.

573
00:45:18,301 --> 00:45:19,802
Butcher, if you...

574
00:45:19,886 --> 00:45:22,847
No, I'm not stark raving, all right?
I fucking saw her.

575
00:45:27,184 --> 00:45:29,186
She had a little boy with her.

576
00:45:30,187 --> 00:45:31,939
The spitting image of Homelander.

577
00:45:32,023 --> 00:45:35,067
I thought he just wanted to humiliate me,

578
00:45:35,151 --> 00:45:37,194
show me what he'd done to my girl

579
00:45:37,778 --> 00:45:39,697
before he gave me the good news.

580
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:43,284
Then I woke up three hours later
in a Tony fucking Cicero's.

581
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:44,410
God knows why.

582
00:45:50,917 --> 00:45:52,209
I gotta find her,

583
00:45:53,419 --> 00:45:55,963
and I gotta get her the fuck out of there.

584
00:45:58,674 --> 00:46:00,509
And I need your help to do it.

585
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:03,137
Are you fucking with us?

586
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,765
I find the terrorist for Mallory,

587
00:46:05,848 --> 00:46:07,224
she finds Becca for me.

588
00:46:07,308 --> 00:46:08,559
That's the deal I made.

589
00:46:08,643 --> 00:46:11,938
I know what I done to you. All right?

590
00:46:13,064 --> 00:46:15,441
And by rights,
you should tell me to fuck off.

591
00:46:15,524 --> 00:46:16,901
But still...

592
00:46:17,902 --> 00:46:19,070
I'm asking.

593
00:46:34,085 --> 00:46:37,296
When you...

594
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,382
When you disappeared that night...

595
00:46:39,465 --> 00:46:42,093
I'm sorry.

596
00:46:42,176 --> 00:46:45,388
We were supposed to watch out
for each other and then you were gone.

597
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:55,022
Shining Light sent me here.

598
00:46:55,106 --> 00:47:01,320
Put the needle in my spine
and filled me full of the blue poison.

599
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,910
I should have found you.

600
00:47:07,994 --> 00:47:12,289
No. I'm the big sister.
I should have come back for you, but...

601
00:47:16,002 --> 00:47:19,505
...they made me into...

602
00:47:21,257 --> 00:47:24,677
...a monster.

603
00:47:27,304 --> 00:47:31,058
If that's true, we're both monsters now.

604
00:47:33,811 --> 00:47:35,771
Did it hurt?

605
00:47:36,147 --> 00:47:38,024
I wanted to die.

606
00:47:41,485 --> 00:47:43,529
Me too.

607
00:47:44,363 --> 00:47:46,824
They had one dose left

608
00:47:46,907 --> 00:47:49,201
and they knew it worked on you

609
00:47:49,285 --> 00:47:52,788
so they figured it would work on me.

610
00:48:00,588 --> 00:48:02,631
I'm sorry.

611
00:48:02,715 --> 00:48:05,342
It's not your fault.

612
00:48:24,028 --> 00:48:26,280
It's not your fault.

613
00:49:01,398 --> 00:49:03,317
Who, uh...? Who we sexting?

614
00:49:03,984 --> 00:49:06,695
What...?
What are you doing in here? Get out.

615
00:49:09,907 --> 00:49:11,117
I'd... Okay.

616
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,453
Look, you got me.
I'm having a heavy flow day. It's...

617
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:21,252
- What are you doing with this?
- This is not how it looks.

618
00:49:21,794 --> 00:49:24,421
Okay? It's just a misunderstanding.

619
00:49:24,505 --> 00:49:26,507
Homelander should have charred your ass

620
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:29,218
as soon as he found out
that you were fucking Hughie.

621
00:49:29,301 --> 00:49:32,054
Hughie saved your life. We both did.

622
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:34,430
Your mistake.

623
00:49:34,974 --> 00:49:37,268
Okay, if you just give me a minute,
I can explain.

624
00:49:37,351 --> 00:49:40,813
You know,
I just want you to think about me

625
00:49:40,896 --> 00:49:42,731
when you're getting the skin

626
00:49:42,815 --> 00:49:44,859
peeled off your face, bitch.

627
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,659
You're not gonna tell anyone anything.

628
00:49:56,662 --> 00:49:58,080
Who says that I haven't already?

629
00:49:58,164 --> 00:50:00,166
'Cause then I'd already be dead.

630
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:02,459
You're not gonna do shit.

631
00:50:03,502 --> 00:50:04,795
Why is that?

632
00:50:05,963 --> 00:50:08,465
'Cause you killed your fucking girlfriend.

633
00:50:10,926 --> 00:50:14,180
That's what you told Hughie, right?
That you killed Popclaw?

634
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:20,019
You can't prove anything.

635
00:50:20,603 --> 00:50:21,854
Did she suffer?

636
00:50:23,981 --> 00:50:28,569
Did you look into her big, sad eyes
while you did it?

637
00:50:30,946 --> 00:50:32,489
Fuck you.

638
00:50:33,115 --> 00:50:36,368
Yeah, see,
I looked at the Vought forensics report,

639
00:50:36,452 --> 00:50:37,536
and...

640
00:50:38,245 --> 00:50:40,164
Wow.

641
00:50:40,247 --> 00:50:44,543
All those needles jammed into her arm
at the same time?

642
00:50:44,627 --> 00:50:47,171
I mean, one of them
actually shattered the bone.

643
00:50:47,254 --> 00:50:49,840
Did you know that? Would someone
really do that to themselves?

644
00:50:49,924 --> 00:50:52,593
I mean,
doesn't look like an accident to me.

645
00:50:53,177 --> 00:50:55,346
I mean, Vought's happy to bury it,

646
00:50:55,429 --> 00:50:58,682
but, you know, say, if...

647
00:50:59,225 --> 00:51:01,435
<i>Sports Illustrated</i> found out...

648
00:51:03,979 --> 00:51:05,314
If you do that...

649
00:51:06,857 --> 00:51:09,109
I'm gonna take you down right with me.

650
00:51:09,652 --> 00:51:11,445
And then we'll both be dead.

651
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,282
Go ahead.

652
00:51:16,116 --> 00:51:17,493
Fucking try it.

653
00:51:18,661 --> 00:51:20,120
I don't give a shit.

654
00:51:53,821 --> 00:51:57,074
These people you were with...

655
00:51:57,658 --> 00:52:00,244
They keep me safe.
They'll keep you safe too.

656
00:52:03,872 --> 00:52:06,750
Or we can go home. Back to the village.

657
00:52:09,086 --> 00:52:10,838
There is no village anymore.

658
00:52:11,463 --> 00:52:13,215
What?

659
00:52:13,882 --> 00:52:15,175
They came for us.

660
00:52:15,259 --> 00:52:17,344
Who?

661
00:52:17,428 --> 00:52:18,595
The Americans.

662
00:52:18,679 --> 00:52:21,557
This hero came shrieking
out of the sky like a demon.

663
00:52:22,391 --> 00:52:25,769
Destroyed the camp.
And all the villages around it too.

664
00:52:26,979 --> 00:52:29,148
There were bodies everywhere.

665
00:52:30,482 --> 00:52:31,817
Everyone's gone.

666
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:34,820
Then we'll go somewhere else.
Back to Japan.

667
00:52:34,903 --> 00:52:37,740
Maybe grandma and grandpa
are still alive.

668
00:52:37,823 --> 00:52:39,700
You don't care?

669
00:52:39,783 --> 00:52:42,244
That the Superhero split
an old woman in half?

670
00:52:43,662 --> 00:52:45,831
That the entire school caved in
with the kids inside?

671
00:52:45,914 --> 00:52:48,834
That babies burned alive in their cribs
when the propane tanks exploded?

672
00:52:48,917 --> 00:52:51,754
I never wanted this.
But they were right all along.

673
00:52:52,338 --> 00:52:54,465
Shining Light is full of shit!

674
00:52:54,548 --> 00:52:57,009
Shining Light fights injustice.

675
00:52:57,092 --> 00:52:58,719
They stand up for
people without a voice.

676
00:52:59,303 --> 00:53:02,139
They murdered our parents!

677
00:53:02,222 --> 00:53:04,308
This country is an enemy
to the whole world now.

678
00:53:06,185 --> 00:53:08,187
We need to fight back. Fight with me!

679
00:53:08,979 --> 00:53:13,609
You're the boy who nursed
every mouse who lost its mother.

680
00:53:16,153 --> 00:53:17,821
That was a long time ago.

681
00:53:18,739 --> 00:53:21,658
You're still my brother.

682
00:53:23,285 --> 00:53:27,247
Then... you know I have to do this.

683
00:54:55,961 --> 00:54:58,797
Are you all right? <i>Mon coeur!</i>

684
00:55:02,468 --> 00:55:05,262
Well, cheers, love.

685
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:08,182
At least someone's got
some sense around here.

686
00:55:55,562 --> 00:55:58,315
You come between me and my missus again,
