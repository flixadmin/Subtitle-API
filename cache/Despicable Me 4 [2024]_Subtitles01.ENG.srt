1
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:46,370
Stuart.

2
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:49,741
Illumination!

3
00:02:32,249 --> 00:02:34,681
Phil, Ron, Ralph! Stay focused.

4
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,980
Okay, okay.

5
00:02:43,626 --> 00:02:46,561
Okay, our target
is Maxime Le Mal,

6
00:02:46,696 --> 00:02:49,229
one of the Anti-Villain League's
most wanted.

7
00:02:49,365 --> 00:02:52,400
And, trust me, a real jerk.

8
00:02:52,535 --> 00:02:55,872
So, there is no room
for error. Got it?

9
00:02:56,007 --> 00:02:57,542
<i>Sí,</i> boss.

10
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:11,284
Phil, Ron!

11
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:35,206
Kids can be so cruel,
but Maxime can be even crueler.

12
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:42,379
Ho, ho, ho.
Well, well, well.

13
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,779
Look who it is.

14
00:03:43,915 --> 00:03:46,785
If it isn't Gru-ser the Loser.

15
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:50,554
Well, if it isn't Maxime Le Mal.
You look--

16
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,523
Magnificent? Yes, I know.

17
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:54,768
What did you think?

18
00:03:54,854 --> 00:03:58,400
I was going to look like a
bald loser with a dad bod?

19
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:01,598
Looks like you beat me to it, no?

20
00:04:07,575 --> 00:04:09,207
It's good to laugh, no?

21
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,011
Anyway, you remember
my girlfriend, Valentina?

22
00:04:14,146 --> 00:04:17,221
She was captain of
the Femme Fatale cheer squad,

23
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,724
and the most popular girl
at school.

24
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,290
I remember.

25
00:04:22,425 --> 00:04:24,422
Good to see you, Valentina.

26
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,426
What happened, Gru?

27
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:32,308
All your dreams of becoming
a famous villain,

28
00:04:32,332 --> 00:04:34,413
they go poof-poof?

29
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,966
Well, I don't know if you know,

30
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:39,071
but I did manage
to steal the moon.

31
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:40,306
Really?

32
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:42,613
You mean, that moon?

33
00:04:44,109 --> 00:04:46,647
Is this on?

34
00:04:46,782 --> 00:04:49,321
Can I have
everyone's attention, please?

35
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:54,117
Good evening and welcome,
Lycée Pas Bon alumni.

36
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,418
Now, we're going to
kick off the festivities

37
00:04:57,554 --> 00:05:01,294
by announcing the winner
of our most coveted award,

38
00:05:01,429 --> 00:05:03,328
The Golden Alumni.

39
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,331
And so, without further ado,

40
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:13,248
the winner of this year's
Golden Alumni is…

41
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:16,847
My favorite student.

42
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,515
Maxime Le Mal.

43
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,642
What?

44
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,446
Are you kidding me?
Thank you. Thank you.

45
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:23,614
<i>Merci. Merci beaucoup.</i>

46
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,820
No, you don't have to.

47
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:33,060
Thank you. Thank you.

48
00:05:33,195 --> 00:05:34,196
Thank you.

49
00:05:34,331 --> 00:05:35,568
I'm sure you all know

50
00:05:35,654 --> 00:05:39,102
that I have something
very big in the works.

51
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:42,511
Now, some of you laughed at my
childhood obsession

52
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:44,334
with cockroaches.

53
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,828
But I quickly learned

54
00:05:45,852 --> 00:05:49,540
that they are
a miracle of evolution.

55
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:54,142
And I have found a way
to harness the strength

56
00:05:54,278 --> 00:05:57,083
and the speed and the--
What is the word?

57
00:05:57,219 --> 00:06:02,151
"Unsquishability" of the most
powerful creature on the planet.

58
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:07,558
Which makes me
indestructible and unstoppable!

59
00:06:07,694 --> 00:06:10,829
Maxime! Maxime! Maxime!

60
00:06:10,965 --> 00:06:14,538
Behold the power
of the cockroach!

61
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:46,764
So, my sad little friend,
what do you say about that?

62
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:49,673
Well, I'd say you're…

63
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:51,441
under arrest,

64
00:06:51,604 --> 00:06:53,974
courtesy of
the Anti-Villain League.

65
00:06:55,007 --> 00:06:56,838
I don't think so, <i>mon ami.</i>

66
00:06:56,974 --> 00:06:58,540
Oh, yeah? Goop grenade!

67
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,787
No!

68
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:11,791
Move in.

69
00:07:11,927 --> 00:07:13,398
AVL!
Everybody, freeze!

70
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:15,467
Stay where you are.
Move!

71
00:07:25,606 --> 00:07:26,676
Stay there!

72
00:07:27,705 --> 00:07:28,744
Freeze!

73
00:07:35,185 --> 00:07:36,679
Gotcha!

74
00:07:36,814 --> 00:07:38,286
No, no, no! No!

75
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:39,621
This is not happening!

76
00:07:39,756 --> 00:07:41,422
<i>C'est impossible.</i>

77
00:07:41,557 --> 00:07:43,462
Get your hands off of me!

78
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:47,063
- I am commanding you
to let me go.

79
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:48,494
So long, Maxime!

80
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,564
Who's the loser now?

81
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,597
Loser, loser, loser!

82
00:08:03,545 --> 00:08:05,550
This is not over!

83
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,814
You won't always
have the AVL

84
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:10,619
to fight your battles,
you coward!

85
00:08:10,754 --> 00:08:13,825
Mark my words!
I will exterminate you!

86
00:08:20,746 --> 00:08:22,031
Not--

87
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:23,997
Not scary at all.

88
00:08:39,911 --> 00:08:41,277
Hello, everybody!

89
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:43,015
Gru, what's up?
Yay, Gru!

90
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:44,983
- Hey, Gru.
- I'm so happy you're here!

91
00:08:45,118 --> 00:08:47,125
What's shaking
in the Gru house?

92
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,127
Look what I taught Lucky.

93
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,387
- Lucky, sit.

94
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,892
Lucky, I said sit.

95
00:08:59,637 --> 00:09:03,067
Well, it is only
his first lesson.

96
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,705
Maybe we practice
outside from now on.

97
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,280
There's my favorite husband!

98
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:10,248
Did you remember
to get the milk?

99
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,211
Well, yes. They had a few kinds.

100
00:09:12,346 --> 00:09:14,718
They got the almond milk,
soy milk, hemp milk,

101
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:17,518
oat milk, goat milk,
chocolate milk, half-and-half,

102
00:09:17,654 --> 00:09:20,091
powdered, and of magnesia.

103
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,384
What about regular milk?

104
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,719
No, they don't
make that anymore.

105
00:09:25,989 --> 00:09:27,597
Wait a minute.

106
00:09:27,732 --> 00:09:29,791
One, two, three girls.

107
00:09:29,926 --> 00:09:31,634
One wife.

108
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,395
Something is missing.

109
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:37,199
No, I think
that's all of us. Yeah.

110
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:38,968
You know what?
I keep forgetting…

111
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:40,579
this guy!

112
00:09:43,826 --> 00:09:45,045
There's my boy!

113
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,251
There he is!

114
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:51,787
Where is Daddy's hug?

115
00:09:52,415 --> 00:09:55,088
Looks like
somebody's a little cranky!

116
00:09:55,223 --> 00:10:00,295
Behind that sourpuss,
I know you love your dada!

117
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,658
Go on, say it.

118
00:10:01,794 --> 00:10:04,262
Dada. Dada.

119
00:10:04,398 --> 00:10:06,636
Yes, of course
he loves you! He just--

120
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,899
He just doesn't show it
on his face,

121
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:11,142
or with his body language.

122
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,037
Right, Gru Jr? Come on.

123
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:15,039
Show Daddy how much
you love him.

124
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,776
I know what
will make you happy!

125
00:10:19,873 --> 00:10:22,150
Bahama Medley!

126
00:10:23,951 --> 00:10:26,816
No? It's from The Bahamas.

127
00:10:26,952 --> 00:10:28,488
All of them. Look.

128
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,112
So yummy!

129
00:10:35,606 --> 00:10:37,960
That really tastes
like The Bahamas!

130
00:10:38,544 --> 00:10:40,029
See? He loves his daddy!

131
00:10:40,165 --> 00:10:42,105
He's sharing.

132
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,072
Phil, Ralph, Ron!

133
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:53,744
Pistachio. Yeah, cashew.

134
00:10:57,453 --> 00:10:58,987
Gotcha!

135
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,138
Thanks, guys.

136
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:19,242
Ramsbottom?

137
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:20,811
Bottom.

138
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,540
I need a word with you both.
Sure, but what--

139
00:11:24,675 --> 00:11:26,741
I'm sorry.
There's no time for chitchat.

140
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:30,051
Maxime Le Mal has sent you
a message from prison.

141
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,624
<i>Bonjour,</i> Gru.

142
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,157
I know you can hear me,
so hear this.

143
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:39,887
You think you can humiliate me
and get away with it? Yes?

144
00:11:40,023 --> 00:11:41,724
But, no!

145
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,695
When I break out of prison,
I'm coming for my revenge, Gru!

146
00:11:44,831 --> 00:11:48,966
But this time,
I won't go so easy on you!

147
00:11:49,102 --> 00:11:51,341
And I know where you live!

148
00:11:51,468 --> 00:11:53,318
So you better sleep
with one eye open,

149
00:11:53,507 --> 00:11:55,307
because you can't hide from me!

150
00:11:56,207 --> 00:11:58,442
Sweet dreams, Gru-ser!

151
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,817
Don't worry.
He can't get out of there.

152
00:12:02,952 --> 00:12:05,347
It's a maximum security prison.

153
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,217
Yes, well…

154
00:12:07,856 --> 00:12:09,092
…he escaped yesterday.

155
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,392
What?

156
00:12:10,527 --> 00:12:12,221
Leave our home?

157
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,926
Oh, no. You're gonna love it.

158
00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:16,258
It's called "the safe house,"

159
00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:18,559
and it's fun, and it's safe,
and it's fantastic

160
00:12:18,728 --> 00:12:19,661
and we're going.

161
00:12:19,797 --> 00:12:22,032
Yeah, you'll get a new room,
go to a new school.

162
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:23,764
It'll be fun, right?

163
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,673
Everything's gonna be new.
We love new!

164
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:27,202
What about all my friends?

165
00:12:27,338 --> 00:12:28,444
You'll make new friends.

166
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:30,113
Probably better ones.

167
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:32,883
I can't believe this.

168
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,617
Yes, yes. Lot of emotions.
Big life change.

169
00:12:35,753 --> 00:12:37,321
Less talking, more walking.

170
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,153
Come on, here we go.

171
00:12:48,596 --> 00:12:52,927
I'm sorry
you can't go with us, Lucky.

172
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:56,731
Take good care of him.

173
00:12:57,871 --> 00:12:59,369
Be good, Lucky!

174
00:12:59,505 --> 00:13:02,814
Don't forget
to practice your tricks!

175
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,784
We'll arrive at the AVL
safe house in a few hours.

176
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,917
Mayflower is a lovely town.

177
00:13:12,053 --> 00:13:14,625
A lovely, safe, boring town.

178
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,453
Trust me,
it is for the best, Gru.

179
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,595
And what about Grandma
and Uncle Dru?

180
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,498
I'm sorry. No one can know
of your whereabouts,

181
00:13:22,706 --> 00:13:23,834
not even family.

182
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,003
Bingo!
There's your silver lining.

183
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:28,649
And you promise to take
care of the other Minions?

184
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:31,673
They'll be safe and sound
at AVL Headquarters.

185
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:33,840
I have big plans for them.

186
00:13:33,976 --> 00:13:36,309
Good luck with that.

187
00:13:54,831 --> 00:13:57,363
That is it!

188
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:07,307
Quiet!

189
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:12,243
You are now on Carl's bus.

190
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:15,645
And Carl is
a longtime AVL employee

191
00:14:15,781 --> 00:14:18,550
whose retirement benefits
are almost vested.

192
00:14:18,685 --> 00:14:23,795
So, while on Carl's bus,
you follow Carl's rules.

193
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,026
No shenanigans,
no antics and no tomfoolery.

194
00:14:28,161 --> 00:14:29,323
Tom?

195
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,168
So this ends now.

196
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,986
Or you're gonna see
a side of Carl

197
00:14:34,186 --> 00:14:36,002
you do not wanna see.

198
00:14:36,452 --> 00:14:39,303
Do I make myself clear?

199
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:40,972
Bazooka!

200
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,079
This won't st--

201
00:14:49,215 --> 00:14:50,882
Carl does not like this!

202
00:14:51,018 --> 00:14:52,213
Watch your hands.
What are you doing?

203
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:53,047
Who's pinching?

204
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,585
No, no!

205
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:03,224
Here we are.
The town of Mayflower.

206
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:05,920
This safe house has been used
to protect our agents

207
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:07,703
for decades now.

208
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,339
Look at that place.

209
00:15:10,315 --> 00:15:12,209
Look at these lawns.
The flowers.

210
00:15:13,518 --> 00:15:15,538
- That is cool.
- Are we really gonna live here?

211
00:15:15,674 --> 00:15:17,381
Look at that fountain.

212
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,281
Awesome.

213
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:21,076
Is that one ours?

214
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,814
Hey, hey.

215
00:15:23,393 --> 00:15:24,581
Look at that.
That's pretty.

216
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,289
I could get used to this.

217
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,392
It looks like
a princess lives there.

218
00:15:33,158 --> 00:15:34,790
And here it is.

219
00:15:36,195 --> 00:15:38,068
Your new home.

220
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:46,778
No fountain.

221
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:49,279
I'm sure
it's gonna be great.

222
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,706
Come on.

223
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:53,243
Silas says that there is
a pool in the back.

224
00:15:53,378 --> 00:15:54,810
That'll be fun, huh?

225
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:06,127
It's so cold and uninviting.

226
00:16:06,263 --> 00:16:08,194
- But in a homey kind of way.
- What?

227
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,558
Yes, everything here
is AVL standard.

228
00:16:11,724 --> 00:16:12,997
What it lacks in comfort,

229
00:16:13,109 --> 00:16:15,336
it more than makes up for
in functionality.

230
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:18,971
There's even
a fully automated lockdown mode.

231
00:16:19,106 --> 00:16:20,173
Isn't that fun?

232
00:16:20,948 --> 00:16:22,510
Full lockdown mode.

233
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,450
It has a vending machine.

234
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,244
I love this place!

235
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,732
This will be great.

236
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:42,663
All right,
now down to business.

237
00:16:42,798 --> 00:16:43,946
For your own safety,

238
00:16:44,057 --> 00:16:46,301
you'll all be assuming
new identities.

239
00:16:46,436 --> 00:16:49,003
New identities?
Is that really necessary?

240
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,039
It's not up for debate, Gru.

241
00:16:51,175 --> 00:16:53,671
Now, you are
a solar panel salesman.

242
00:16:53,806 --> 00:16:57,307
Lucy, you're a hairstylist
at an upscale salon.

243
00:16:57,443 --> 00:17:01,145
A hairstylist? Yes, jackpot!

244
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,987
Silas, did you choose that
because you knew I cut my own hair,

245
00:17:04,122 --> 00:17:05,782
and that I would
totally rock at this?

246
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,788
No.

247
00:17:07,924 --> 00:17:09,488
"Chet Cunningham."

248
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:12,329
That's got a nice ring to it.

249
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,460
Girls.

250
00:17:14,062 --> 00:17:16,928
Cool. I'm Blair.

251
00:17:17,063 --> 00:17:18,293
"Britney"?

252
00:17:18,428 --> 00:17:19,795
My name is Bree?

253
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,199
Oh, come on.
There are worse names than Bree.

254
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:24,003
Yeah, like Blanche.

255
00:17:24,138 --> 00:17:25,934
Yes, Margo.

256
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:29,177
Blanche? That is a terrible name.

257
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:31,849
Imagine being named Blanche.

258
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,711
Truly, I cannot think
of a worse--

259
00:17:34,778 --> 00:17:36,148
My name's Blanche, isn't it?

260
00:17:36,283 --> 00:17:37,512
Yep.

261
00:17:37,648 --> 00:17:39,553
Well, I'll get used to it.

262
00:17:39,688 --> 00:17:42,524
Well, why don't you girls go
and pick out your rooms

263
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,393
while I have a word
with your parents?

264
00:17:47,397 --> 00:17:49,423
Yes, I didn't want
to frighten the girls,

265
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,113
but it is absolutely crucial

266
00:17:51,207 --> 00:17:53,502
you keep your true identities
under wraps.

267
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:57,400
Gru, you're going to have to try
to not be so "Gru-ish."

268
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:59,566
What is that supposed to mean?

269
00:17:59,702 --> 00:18:01,443
Well, I'm just
saying you tend to

270
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:03,472
stand out in a
crowd, that's all.

271
00:18:03,607 --> 00:18:04,863
You know…

272
00:18:05,045 --> 00:18:07,209
…like the way you're always
cranky and irritable.

273
00:18:07,344 --> 00:18:08,628
And how you

274
00:18:08,652 --> 00:18:10,912
make things a bit awkward
for everyone around you.

275
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:13,590
You do do that.
I mean, you know--

276
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,126
Okay, enough.

277
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,925
I don't make people
awkward or uncomfortable.

278
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:19,862
I'm very comforting.

279
00:18:19,997 --> 00:18:21,864
Like a nice meat loaf.

280
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:23,926
I'm pretty delicious.

281
00:18:27,904 --> 00:18:29,119
This is not awkward.

282
00:18:29,143 --> 00:18:30,840
You're the ones who
are making it awkward.

283
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,143
Gru, you have to blend in.

284
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,073
Your family's lives
are at stake.

285
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:36,576
You understand?

286
00:18:36,711 --> 00:18:38,248
Of course, yes.
Fully understand.

287
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,977
We would do anything
to keep our family safe. Yeah.

288
00:18:41,113 --> 00:18:44,421
Right, well, I'll be in contact
when this is all over.

289
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:49,490
Until then, capturing Maxime
Le Mal is our top priority.

290
00:18:50,926 --> 00:18:51,954
Stay safe.

291
00:18:54,531 --> 00:18:57,327
You know what, Gru,
maybe this isn't so bad.

292
00:18:57,462 --> 00:18:59,501
We need a break
from chasing down villains

293
00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:01,535
and dangerous missions, right?

294
00:19:01,671 --> 00:19:04,003
We can actually be
a normal family for once.

295
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:09,310
And I can finally spend some
real bonding time with the baby.

296
00:19:09,445 --> 00:19:12,082
It's gonna be great.
Right, pal?

297
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,446
Who's got your nose?
Who's got--

298
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:16,979
He's got my nose.

299
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,491
Quite the grip there.
That kid is strong.

300
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,560
Thank you.
Look at everyone. Yes.

301
00:20:02,695 --> 00:20:04,731
We are having
a good time, right?

302
00:20:04,866 --> 00:20:07,763
<i>♪ I'm free to do what I want ♪</i>

303
00:20:07,898 --> 00:20:09,465
<i>♪ And have a good time ♪</i>

304
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,670
No, I love you.

305
00:20:15,806 --> 00:20:18,674
Thank you, my beautiful army.

306
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,879
Maxime's back, baby.

307
00:20:24,254 --> 00:20:26,171
And a special <i>merci beaucoup</i>

308
00:20:26,402 --> 00:20:29,359
to everyone who helped me
break out of AVL prison.

309
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,928
Todd and Linda, where are you?
Where are you? Yes.

310
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,690
For distracting the guards.

311
00:20:34,457 --> 00:20:35,728
<i>Très magnifique.</i>

312
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,399
Now, silence!

313
00:20:38,535 --> 00:20:41,429
We must make Gru suffer
for arresting me.

314
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,506
And what better way

315
00:20:44,642 --> 00:20:47,709
than to take away from him
his precious little baby.

316
00:20:47,844 --> 00:20:50,481
I want to take that baby.

317
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:52,814
Yeah!

318
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,281
Oh, Maxime.

319
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,550
No, no. Wait, wait. Not Maxime.

320
00:20:56,686 --> 00:21:00,176
What if I start going by
"Cockroach Man,"?

321
00:21:00,722 --> 00:21:03,058
Little on the nose,
but it is very clear.

322
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:04,506
It's good, no?

323
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:06,971
I am not calling you
that stupid name,

324
00:21:07,162 --> 00:21:09,294
but I love this evil plan.

325
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,235
Well, Gru has it coming.

326
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:14,070
He humiliated me
in front of the whole school.

327
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:17,307
I had my trophy and everything.

328
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,402
But now the game begins.

329
00:21:20,538 --> 00:21:22,644
He runs and hides
like the mouse,

330
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,813
and we find him like the cat.

331
00:21:25,949 --> 00:21:27,813
Game on.

332
00:21:41,493 --> 00:21:45,061
Okay, we've got Chet's famous,
super cheesy scrambled eggs.

333
00:21:45,197 --> 00:21:48,436
And Blanche's famous bacon
that spells your name.

334
00:21:48,572 --> 00:21:52,440
- Here you go, Britney.

335
00:21:52,576 --> 00:21:56,506
Wait, I can't say
my name is Britney.

336
00:21:56,641 --> 00:21:58,340
That would be a lie.

337
00:21:58,475 --> 00:21:59,745
Yes.

338
00:21:59,881 --> 00:22:02,350
But we aren't
"stupposed" to lie.

339
00:22:02,485 --> 00:22:04,145
Don't think of it as lying.

340
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,682
Think of it
as high-stakes pretending.

341
00:22:06,818 --> 00:22:08,885
Well, I'm not going to.

342
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,957
Bah, it's just
a little white lie.

343
00:22:11,093 --> 00:22:11,862
No.

344
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,226
Agnes, as your father,

345
00:22:13,361 --> 00:22:14,928
I command you to lie.

346
00:22:15,063 --> 00:22:16,031
No.

347
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:17,283
Yes, lie.

348
00:22:18,097 --> 00:22:20,703
You are walking
on thin ice, little lady.

349
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,141
Why can't you be more
like your sister Edith?

350
00:22:26,276 --> 00:22:27,910
She lies all the time.

351
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:29,113
No, I don't.

352
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,377
See? See? She's lying right now.

353
00:22:31,513 --> 00:22:33,213
Beautifully, I might add.

354
00:22:33,348 --> 00:22:34,548
Okay, you guys.

355
00:22:34,684 --> 00:22:36,120
This is our first big day
in Mayflower,

356
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:38,516
and I say
we make it a great one.

357
00:22:38,652 --> 00:22:40,324
Right, Chet Jr?

358
00:22:41,085 --> 00:22:43,424
Mayflower. Yes!

359
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,495
We're gonna be late for karate.

360
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,036
And you have to
get Margo to school.

361
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,630
It's gonna be awesome.

362
00:22:49,766 --> 00:22:52,227
Hey, you just have to
put yourself out there,

363
00:22:52,362 --> 00:22:56,034
and I promise Mayflower
will love Chet Cunningham.

364
00:22:56,169 --> 00:22:59,073
Well, they're gonna love him
just as much as I do.

365
00:22:59,622 --> 00:23:00,915
And you, little man,

366
00:23:00,939 --> 00:23:03,571
are gonna have so much fun
with your daddy today.

367
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:07,643
Yep, just you and Dada.

368
00:23:07,778 --> 00:23:09,785
Come on, say it. Dada.

369
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,455
Dada.

370
00:23:15,423 --> 00:23:17,428
Gonna be a fun day.

371
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,042
Buddies.

372
00:23:36,178 --> 00:23:37,738
Okay.

373
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,386
- Thanks a lot, guys.
- Buddy.

374
00:23:44,521 --> 00:23:46,952
…check ya.

375
00:23:49,018 --> 00:23:51,421
All right. Thanks, hon.

376
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:52,892
Bye.
Bye.

377
00:23:53,726 --> 00:23:55,732
Look, Margo, neighbors.

378
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:56,997
Hello!

379
00:23:58,563 --> 00:23:59,662
Come on.

380
00:23:59,797 --> 00:24:01,397
You got this, Chet.

381
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:06,372
I'm your new neighbor,
Chet Cunningham.

382
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:08,270
Perry Prescott.

383
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:12,508
So, what brings you
to the neighborhood, Chet?

384
00:24:12,644 --> 00:24:13,917
Well…

385
00:24:15,776 --> 00:24:19,818
Solar panels. That's it.
I sell solar panels.

386
00:24:19,953 --> 00:24:22,584
Have you joined
the solar revolution?

387
00:24:22,719 --> 00:24:24,325
Yeah, no.

388
00:24:24,995 --> 00:24:26,259
I think I'm good.

389
00:24:26,394 --> 00:24:27,427
Good to know.

390
00:24:27,563 --> 00:24:29,264
So, what do you do, Perry?

391
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:31,368
I own Prescott Motors.

392
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:34,929
The largest auto dealer
in the state.

393
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:37,668
That's impressive.

394
00:24:37,804 --> 00:24:39,733
This is my daughter Margo.

395
00:24:39,868 --> 00:24:40,804
Bree, Dad.

396
00:24:42,072 --> 00:24:44,645
Yes. Yes. Did I say "Margo"?

397
00:24:44,781 --> 00:24:46,643
It's funny,
because I was thinking--

398
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,275
I was thinking about a fish

399
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:50,452
I once had as a
pet, named Margo.

400
00:24:50,588 --> 00:24:54,789
Who lived in the pond
and then died.

401
00:24:57,332 --> 00:24:59,454
Anyway, I--

402
00:24:59,589 --> 00:25:03,127
I'm about to take Bree
to school for her first day.

403
00:25:03,262 --> 00:25:06,036
Yeah, I was about to take Poppy
to school, so…

404
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,502
Poppy. Hello, Poppy.

405
00:25:08,638 --> 00:25:10,635
That's a fun name to say.

406
00:25:10,771 --> 00:25:12,367
You want to carpool with us?

407
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:13,903
No.

408
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:16,011
You could be friends
with Bree.

409
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:17,171
Right, Bree?

410
00:25:17,306 --> 00:25:19,473
You don't have any friends.

411
00:25:22,183 --> 00:25:25,316
Well, love to chitchat, Chet,
but she's got school,

412
00:25:25,452 --> 00:25:28,251
and I'm meeting some pals
over at the country club, so…

413
00:25:28,386 --> 00:25:30,357
Country club.
That sounds like a lot of fun.

414
00:25:30,492 --> 00:25:33,103
If I were ever invited
to a country club,

415
00:25:33,127 --> 00:25:36,567
I am sure that I would love it.

416
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:40,235
Yeah, well,
we really have to get going.

417
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,800
So nice meeting you, Chet.

418
00:25:43,967 --> 00:25:45,115
Okay, cool.

419
00:25:45,139 --> 00:25:49,277
Any time you want to hang out,
just hit me up with a text.

420
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:51,080
He's gonna text me.

421
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,715
That was painful.

422
00:25:57,786 --> 00:25:59,416
You'll see. By lunchtime,

423
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,201
you will have forgotten all
about your old, lousy friends.

424
00:26:03,797 --> 00:26:05,563
Not so sure about that.

425
00:26:10,231 --> 00:26:12,762
Right? Oh, my gosh.

426
00:26:12,897 --> 00:26:14,064
Not my problem, bro.

427
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:17,700
Hey, honey,
you got this.

428
00:26:17,836 --> 00:26:18,800
You're smart.

429
00:26:18,936 --> 00:26:20,136
You're funny.

430
00:26:20,272 --> 00:26:21,937
What's there
to worry about, right?

431
00:26:22,073 --> 00:26:24,439
They're gonna love you.

432
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:26,848
Thanks, Gru.

433
00:26:28,913 --> 00:26:30,280
Bye-bye.

434
00:26:32,547 --> 00:26:34,616
Please let them love you.

435
00:26:39,329 --> 00:26:41,291
Hey, Poppy.

436
00:26:48,801 --> 00:26:51,134
Come on. Hey. Move it!

437
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:54,440
Sorry. My bad.
I'm going. All right.

438
00:26:54,575 --> 00:26:55,910
I'm going.

439
00:26:58,503 --> 00:27:00,145
Glassos.

440
00:27:13,389 --> 00:27:14,896
No, no, no. Sit. Sit.

441
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:17,998
No.

442
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,404
All right, gentlemen.

443
00:27:28,971 --> 00:27:30,010
Fall in.

444
00:27:31,982 --> 00:27:34,479
Some of you may be wondering
why you're here.

445
00:27:35,037 --> 00:27:35,847
<i>Sí.</i>

446
00:27:35,982 --> 00:27:37,851
As you may or may not know,

447
00:27:37,986 --> 00:27:39,780
I was recently
called out of retirement

448
00:27:39,915 --> 00:27:42,491
to head up the AVL's
new top-secret initiative

449
00:27:42,626 --> 00:27:45,153
to take down Maxime Le Mal.

450
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,021
And that's where you come in.

451
00:27:47,156 --> 00:27:48,460
We need volunteers.

452
00:27:48,596 --> 00:27:50,393
Me! Me! Me!

453
00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:52,828
We are looking for
the strong, the mighty…

454
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:55,536
- …the fearless.
- Nope.

455
00:27:55,672 --> 00:27:58,136
We need the best of the best.

456
00:27:58,271 --> 00:28:01,173
So, who's it going to be?

457
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,342
Yes, nice work, gentlemen.

458
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,663
The AVL is known

459
00:28:10,687 --> 00:28:13,021
for cutting-edge
weapons and vehicles,

460
00:28:13,156 --> 00:28:16,386
but now we are developing
cutting-edge agents.

461
00:28:16,521 --> 00:28:19,890
And I can think of
no better guinea pigs than you.

462
00:28:20,026 --> 00:28:21,428
Guinea pigs!

463
00:28:23,033 --> 00:28:26,330
You will be the first
to test our super serum.

464
00:28:26,466 --> 00:28:28,872
Designed to transform you
into elite agents

465
00:28:29,008 --> 00:28:33,502
with powers and abilities
far beyond those of mortal men.

466
00:28:34,941 --> 00:28:37,105
Or you might just explode.

467
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,676
We don't really know.

468
00:28:44,188 --> 00:28:45,382
Hey.

469
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:25,623
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the Mega Minions.

470
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:34,228
Cool.

471
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,739
You guys look adorable.

472
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,668
And-- And really tough
and scary.

473
00:29:38,804 --> 00:29:41,241
I'll look even better
when I have a black belt.

474
00:29:43,202 --> 00:29:45,242
I'm gonna break a brick
with my head.

475
00:29:45,378 --> 00:29:47,246
That's the spirit.

476
00:29:48,711 --> 00:29:50,785
Okay. Now, go have fun
while I'm at work.

477
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,354
Blair and Britney.
Right?

478
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,456
We will.

479
00:29:55,591 --> 00:29:57,655
Okay. Bye, Mom.

480
00:29:57,791 --> 00:29:58,656
Bye.

481
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:00,127
Got ya.

482
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,300
Circle up, people.

483
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:08,100
Show respect for your sensei.

484
00:30:08,235 --> 00:30:10,764
Yes, Sensei O'Sullivan.

485
00:30:12,276 --> 00:30:13,338
Hai!

486
00:30:17,281 --> 00:30:18,468
You, Moscovitch,

487
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:20,175
didn't I tell you
to cut that hair?

488
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,076
You look like a sheepdog.

489
00:30:22,211 --> 00:30:23,485
Sorry, Sensei.

490
00:30:25,522 --> 00:30:27,397
Now, we have
two new students today

491
00:30:27,421 --> 00:30:28,985
ready to begin their journey--

492
00:30:29,753 --> 00:30:32,088
To awesomeness.

493
00:30:32,224 --> 00:30:34,323
You, tiny girl.

494
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,625
Step forward
and tell us your name.

495
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:40,332
It's Britney.

496
00:30:42,513 --> 00:30:43,731
My name?

497
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,336
I can't.

498
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,809
There's no "can't" in karate.

499
00:30:49,945 --> 00:30:52,515
Ten push-ups after class!

500
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,149
Hey, that's not fair.

501
00:30:55,996 --> 00:30:59,312
You better not be
talking back to your sensei.

502
00:31:00,847 --> 00:31:02,557
Now, are you ready

503
00:31:02,581 --> 00:31:04,554
to tell us your name
and participate?

504
00:31:06,926 --> 00:31:08,826
I guess not.

505
00:31:08,946 --> 00:31:10,482
Then why don't you go sit

506
00:31:10,506 --> 00:31:12,844
in the corner of
disgrace and reflection

507
00:31:12,995 --> 00:31:15,829
and think about what kind
of person you wanna be?

508
00:31:20,605 --> 00:31:24,710
Now, am I gonna get
any trouble from you?

509
00:31:24,845 --> 00:31:26,472
Yeah, probably.

510
00:31:26,608 --> 00:31:28,016
Excuse me?

511
00:31:28,151 --> 00:31:30,443
If you think
I'm above fighting children,

512
00:31:30,579 --> 00:31:32,890
you picked the wrong dojo.

513
00:31:48,035 --> 00:31:49,736
Yeah!

514
00:31:49,872 --> 00:31:52,069
That was for my sister.

515
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:58,773
You broke my pinkie toe.

516
00:31:58,909 --> 00:32:03,383
That's gonna be
a lot of push-ups.

517
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,548
Okay, then put this over
here, then the hair gel.

518
00:32:06,684 --> 00:32:08,690
- Hair spray.
- Mrs. Cunningham?

519
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,189
Yeah. Hi.

520
00:32:10,324 --> 00:32:13,254
I have to say,
this is quite a résumé.

521
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,061
Well, what can I say?

522
00:32:15,197 --> 00:32:16,659
I'm good at what I do.

523
00:32:16,794 --> 00:32:19,627
Well, you are
exactly what we need here.

524
00:32:19,763 --> 00:32:22,295
Lot of vain, demanding divas
in this town.

525
00:32:25,403 --> 00:32:27,308
I have a hair emergency, people.

526
00:32:28,011 --> 00:32:29,346
Where's what's-her-name?

527
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:30,944
Remy? Rhonda?

528
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,814
Melora, I'm so sorry.

529
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,409
Rachel's on maternity leave.

530
00:32:34,544 --> 00:32:37,076
What? That is unacceptable.

531
00:32:37,203 --> 00:32:39,270
But you are in luck,

532
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,988
because Blanche here
is fantastic.

533
00:32:42,124 --> 00:32:44,258
Perfect. I'll be in my chair.

534
00:32:45,456 --> 00:32:47,264
Okay, kiddo, you're up.

535
00:32:51,265 --> 00:32:55,105
So, Melora,
what are we thinking?

536
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,240
What if we just wet the hair
and let it dry in the air?

537
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,833
Let nature do its thang…
…you know?

538
00:33:00,969 --> 00:33:03,376
No, no, no, no.
That style is dead to me.

539
00:33:03,511 --> 00:33:06,206
It's-It's time
for a whole new Melora.

540
00:33:06,342 --> 00:33:08,517
I want this.

541
00:33:12,781 --> 00:33:16,557
Okay, let's start with color?

542
00:33:16,693 --> 00:33:17,798
Yes, color.

543
00:33:17,822 --> 00:33:18,996
Because that's what
you start with.

544
00:33:21,093 --> 00:33:22,626
Little of this.

545
00:33:23,326 --> 00:33:24,826
Some of that.

546
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:26,801
That's pretty.

547
00:33:26,937 --> 00:33:27,961
This isn't so hard.

548
00:33:35,975 --> 00:33:37,641
What?

549
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:40,548
Should it be smoking?

550
00:33:41,074 --> 00:33:41,982
Yes.

551
00:33:42,117 --> 00:33:43,845
Smoking means it's working.

552
00:33:52,227 --> 00:33:53,520
What's going on?

553
00:33:53,655 --> 00:33:55,395
Perfect. No one panic.

554
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,068
Call 911.

555
00:34:03,235 --> 00:34:04,503
Quickly, quickly.

556
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:08,408
Wonder where they're going.

557
00:34:12,983 --> 00:34:15,548
Voilà! My latest creation.

558
00:34:15,684 --> 00:34:19,446
All of my transformation powers
in a handheld design, huh?

559
00:34:19,581 --> 00:34:21,214
<i>Ay!</i> I love it.

560
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:23,927
And look at the little antenna.
That's so cute.

561
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,261
It's not supposed
to be cute. No.

562
00:34:26,396 --> 00:34:29,056
I'm going for intimidating.
Terrifying, even.

563
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:33,363
Now, all I have to do is find
that walking boiled potato,

564
00:34:33,499 --> 00:34:35,904
and his baby is mine.

565
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,767
Check this out.

566
00:34:51,081 --> 00:34:55,092
No, I kid you not.
I'm being serious--

567
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:15,145
This is going to be so good.

568
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,990
- Okay, Daddy is
officially exhausted.

569
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,451
I changed your diaper.

570
00:35:31,545 --> 00:35:33,661
I've got your bottle,
your Binky,

571
00:35:33,826 --> 00:35:35,924
and here are your balloons.

572
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:38,968
There you go.
You like those, right?

573
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:41,562
All right.
A little bit of me time.

574
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:17,554
Someone put a glitter bomb
in my locker.

575
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:20,177
Teenagers are the worst.

576
00:36:21,244 --> 00:36:24,547
Yeah. Babies are
no picnic either.

577
00:36:31,513 --> 00:36:32,585
Junior!

578
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:48,614
Okay. Okay.

579
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,374
Dua Lipa prosciutto.

580
00:36:58,876 --> 00:37:01,251
Fire in the bowl.

581
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,552
Good night, Ralph.

582
00:37:09,189 --> 00:37:11,152
<i>♪ Taking out the trash
'Cause I'm an awesome dad ♪</i>

583
00:37:11,287 --> 00:37:13,422
<i>♪ And the baby
Finally went to sleep ♪</i>

584
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,493
Hello, Gru.

585
00:37:18,629 --> 00:37:21,568
Hello. Hey! What the…

586
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,607
Hello, Poppy.
Did you say something?

587
00:37:26,743 --> 00:37:29,646
Wha-- my name's Chet, by the way.

588
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:31,213
Chet Cunningham.

589
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:34,812
Gru? What does that even mean?

590
00:37:37,848 --> 00:37:39,548
It means you're bad at lying.

591
00:37:39,683 --> 00:37:41,354
Hey. That's not nice.

592
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,585
Ever hear of
respecting your elders?

593
00:37:43,721 --> 00:37:45,695
I don't respect boomers.

594
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:47,287
I just mock them.

595
00:37:48,515 --> 00:37:51,297
Is that, like,
a joke you read on the Web?

596
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,396
"The Web"? How old are you?

597
00:37:55,531 --> 00:37:58,838
Well, old enough to know
that you are a rotten little--

598
00:38:00,557 --> 00:38:02,504
You better watch yourself.

599
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:06,582
You used to be a master villain.

600
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:10,850
That's not me.
I don't even see a resemblance.

601
00:38:10,986 --> 00:38:16,755
Clearly, you have the wrong guy,
as I sell… solar panels.

602
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,592
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna expose you.

603
00:38:19,728 --> 00:38:21,590
Because you're gonna
help me pull a heist.

604
00:38:21,726 --> 00:38:23,299
We start planning tomorrow.

605
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:26,300
You want to pull a heist?

606
00:38:26,435 --> 00:38:27,936
Listen, kid,
I'm not going to--

607
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,662
No. You listen, old man.

608
00:38:30,462 --> 00:38:32,307
I own you.

609
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:37,111
And I promise,
you do not want to cross me.

610
00:38:37,247 --> 00:38:39,215
Okay. All right.

611
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:42,114
But tomorrow is
not really good timing.

612
00:38:42,249 --> 00:38:43,447
Bummer for you.

613
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:45,786
Because this is happening.

614
00:38:45,922 --> 00:38:50,855
Unless you want the whole world
to know exactly who you are…

615
00:38:54,094 --> 00:38:55,761
Gru.

616
00:38:56,629 --> 00:38:59,369
She is terrifying.

617
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:20,271
…five!

618
00:39:31,729 --> 00:39:32,834
Hey, Jiminy!

619
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,163
No problemo.

620
00:39:50,152 --> 00:39:51,230
Oy.

621
00:40:00,562 --> 00:40:02,762
All right, all right.
Settle down.

622
00:40:03,495 --> 00:40:04,899
Settle down!

623
00:40:05,034 --> 00:40:06,375
Thank you.

624
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:09,529
It's time to get you out
for some real-world training.

625
00:40:09,665 --> 00:40:10,930
Liberty.

626
00:40:11,066 --> 00:40:13,376
And, if you do well out there,

627
00:40:13,512 --> 00:40:16,710
you'll be
the AVL's new secret weapon.

628
00:40:17,343 --> 00:40:18,338
Pomodoro!

629
00:40:19,246 --> 00:40:21,275
Pomodoro!

630
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:32,495
I'm quite sure
I won't regret this.

631
00:40:33,893 --> 00:40:35,756
No.
The painters canceled.

632
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,091
True story.

633
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:38,628
I don't know
what is the deal with--

634
00:40:38,764 --> 00:40:40,099
Morning, neighbors.

635
00:40:40,234 --> 00:40:41,569
Hey there!

636
00:40:41,704 --> 00:40:44,235
Still waiting on
that invite, Perry.

637
00:40:45,803 --> 00:40:47,560
No. No, no.

638
00:40:48,169 --> 00:40:49,471
- Patsy!
- Our neighbors.

639
00:40:49,606 --> 00:40:50,874
Oh, Patsy.

640
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:53,613
Hi there.
I'm Perry's wife, Patsy.

641
00:40:54,357 --> 00:40:56,277
I'm Blanche.
And this is Chet.

642
00:40:56,413 --> 00:41:00,116
Hi. So, I look over here
and I see you…

643
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:02,985
…and I have
one of my brilliant ideas.

644
00:41:03,121 --> 00:41:05,190
Perry needs a fourth
for tennis tomorrow.

645
00:41:05,325 --> 00:41:06,524
Oh, honey.

646
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,256
I don't know.

647
00:41:08,391 --> 00:41:10,831
He doesn't seem like
much of a tennis guy.

648
00:41:10,966 --> 00:41:14,135
Much of a tennis guy?
I'm too much of a tennis guy.

649
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,768
I'm Mr. Tennis.

650
00:41:15,904 --> 00:41:19,236
It's my favorite
of all the sports games.

651
00:41:19,371 --> 00:41:21,781
With the racket
and with the balls.

652
00:41:21,898 --> 00:41:23,946
So yellow and fuzzy.

653
00:41:25,311 --> 00:41:26,513
Then we're all set.

654
00:41:26,648 --> 00:41:29,082
See you two
at the club tomorrow.

655
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:33,347
Okay. Toodle-oo
to you two too.

656
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,849
So, you-- you play tennis?

657
00:41:35,985 --> 00:41:38,689
Yes. Yes. I play tennis.

658
00:41:38,825 --> 00:41:41,330
I'm pretty fantastic actually.

659
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:43,323
Well, at least
I was at summer camp.

660
00:41:43,728 --> 00:41:46,729
That's great. Here you go.

661
00:41:46,864 --> 00:41:48,728
Okay, bye.

662
00:41:48,863 --> 00:41:50,265
Have fun!

663
00:41:51,273 --> 00:41:52,432
There you go.

664
00:41:54,242 --> 00:41:55,606
Okay.

665
00:42:04,847 --> 00:42:05,987
What the…

666
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,470
Gru.

667
00:42:23,605 --> 00:42:26,474
You can't hide from me, Gru.

668
00:42:26,609 --> 00:42:28,474
<i>Ay!</i> My back is killing me.

669
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:30,412
How long is this gonna take?

670
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:32,743
It will take
as long as it takes.

671
00:42:32,878 --> 00:42:36,047
Mark my words, Gru will not win.

672
00:42:36,183 --> 00:42:38,517
This won't be like
the ninth-grade talent show.

673
00:42:38,653 --> 00:42:40,917
<i>Ay,</i> again with this.

674
00:42:41,053 --> 00:42:43,720
Yes, again.
It was a pivotal moment.

675
00:42:43,856 --> 00:42:45,292
Why can't you indulge me?

676
00:42:47,764 --> 00:42:50,523
It was the night
of the big show.

677
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:53,670
<i>I had practiced for weeks,</i>

678
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:57,169
<i>perfecting a number that would
blow my classmates away.</i>

679
00:42:57,305 --> 00:42:59,840
<i>♪ Karma, karma
Karma, karma chameleon ♪</i>

680
00:42:59,975 --> 00:43:01,905
<i>I was about
to go on when…</i>

681
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,340
- What?
<i>- …I heard it.</i>

682
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:11,114
<i>♪ Karma, karma
Karma, karma chameleon ♪</i>

683
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:15,458
<i>There was that little jerk
doing my big number.</i>

684
00:43:18,856 --> 00:43:20,555
He ruined everything.

685
00:43:20,691 --> 00:43:23,759
I couldn't go on after him.
I would have looked like a fool.

686
00:43:23,895 --> 00:43:25,697
Like I was copying him.

687
00:43:25,832 --> 00:43:28,127
Maybe it was just a coincidence.

688
00:43:28,263 --> 00:43:29,931
That was a very popular song.

689
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:32,240
No, no, no, no. He knew.

690
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:33,875
He did it on purpose.

691
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:36,160
He reveled in humiliating me.

692
00:43:37,444 --> 00:43:38,546
What now?

693
00:43:38,681 --> 00:43:40,172
We're low on fuel.

694
00:43:40,308 --> 00:43:42,014
It's always something.

695
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:45,846
Look, I can never focus
on just being evil.

696
00:43:45,981 --> 00:43:48,185
Okay. Pull over.

697
00:44:17,145 --> 00:44:18,517
Okay, let's see.

698
00:44:18,652 --> 00:44:20,527
Regular unleaded.

699
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,288
It is expensive, no?

700
00:44:23,424 --> 00:44:27,261
Okay. Insert card
and remove rapidly.

701
00:44:27,396 --> 00:44:28,764
"Card not read"?

702
00:44:30,258 --> 00:44:31,993
- Oh, come on.

703
00:44:32,129 --> 00:44:33,466
Did you pull it out rapidly?

704
00:44:33,602 --> 00:44:35,864
Yes. Yes. Very rapidly.

705
00:44:35,999 --> 00:44:37,534
Come--

706
00:44:43,507 --> 00:44:46,474
<i>Ay,</i> get me a slushy.
It's my cheat day.

707
00:44:47,952 --> 00:44:51,584
Hey, you. Your stupid machine
won't read my card.

708
00:44:51,719 --> 00:44:53,254
Did you remove it rapidly?

709
00:44:53,389 --> 00:44:55,156
Yes.

710
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:59,221
Well, sometimes it's too rapid.
You should probably try again.

711
00:44:59,357 --> 00:45:01,797
I don't have
time for this.

712
00:45:04,197 --> 00:45:08,298
I'm trying to
destroy my arch nemesis!

713
00:45:08,433 --> 00:45:11,506
Now, give me 900 gallons
on pump four, you idiot.

714
00:45:12,531 --> 00:45:14,069
Please, don't hurt me.

715
00:45:14,205 --> 00:45:16,243
I'm not going to hurt you.

716
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:19,243
Wha--

717
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:28,422
Look at you!

718
00:45:29,661 --> 00:45:30,887
Much better.

719
00:45:31,023 --> 00:45:33,228
Now, get me a purple slushy!

720
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:37,324
I'm not paying for that,
just so you know. So there.

721
00:45:37,459 --> 00:45:39,565
I know. I'm so bad.

722
00:45:46,512 --> 00:45:49,041
Okay, why don't you guys
pick out a healthy cereal?

723
00:45:49,176 --> 00:45:52,177
This is
Lucky's favorite cereal.

724
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,248
You don't think he'll forget me?

725
00:45:55,384 --> 00:45:56,784
Do you?

726
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,853
Oh, sweetheart,
that's impossible.

727
00:45:59,988 --> 00:46:02,590
You play with Lucky
and dress him up.

728
00:46:02,725 --> 00:46:04,556
And you guys have your podcast.

729
00:46:04,691 --> 00:46:06,460
There is no way in this world

730
00:46:06,589 --> 00:46:09,530
he could ever forget
his best friend.

731
00:46:10,495 --> 00:46:11,691
Thanks, Mom.

732
00:46:12,765 --> 00:46:13,865
Oh, lookit!

733
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,834
This one has extra marshmallows.

734
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:18,500
Double-frosted choco clusters.

735
00:46:18,635 --> 00:46:21,004
Yeah.
Let's go with those.

736
00:46:21,139 --> 00:46:22,968
All right. What else do we need?

737
00:46:25,188 --> 00:46:26,781
Oh, no.

738
00:46:27,446 --> 00:46:29,742
Nobody see. Nobody notice.
Nobody notice.

739
00:46:33,581 --> 00:46:34,862
What's wrong?

740
00:46:35,914 --> 00:46:37,234
Nothing. Just…

741
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,391
Stretching before
we hit the aisles.

742
00:46:40,526 --> 00:46:43,294
Shopping is the number one
cause of pulled hamstrings.

743
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:45,131
You probably didn't know that.

744
00:46:48,134 --> 00:46:49,471
Okay, all stretched. Let's go.

745
00:46:49,607 --> 00:46:52,103
Quickly. Quick, quick, quick.

746
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:54,602
Okay.
Coast is clear--

747
00:46:58,613 --> 00:47:01,011
You.

748
00:47:02,983 --> 00:47:05,980
You did this to me, you fraud.

749
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:07,081
Come on, girls.

750
00:47:07,217 --> 00:47:08,749
Clean up on aisle nine!

751
00:47:08,884 --> 00:47:11,652
I've always wanted to say that.
Just hide over here.

752
00:47:12,487 --> 00:47:14,420
What does that lady want?

753
00:47:14,555 --> 00:47:16,162
Lady? I didn't see a lady.

754
00:47:18,534 --> 00:47:20,468
Lady!

755
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:21,963
Come on. Let's go.

756
00:47:22,099 --> 00:47:23,309
Faster!

757
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,736
You're no hairdresser.

758
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,576
I'm on to you! Get back here.

759
00:47:29,712 --> 00:47:30,847
I gotta get out of here.

760
00:47:47,694 --> 00:47:49,222
Okay.

761
00:47:56,198 --> 00:47:57,236
Come back here.

762
00:48:03,206 --> 00:48:04,540
Hey! No, no, no, no!

763
00:48:06,148 --> 00:48:09,545
- You can't just--
- Open, open, open!

764
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:19,192
Let's go!

765
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,729
Stop! Come here, you!

766
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:33,239
That was a close one.

767
00:48:33,374 --> 00:48:35,571
Always a fun time
when you go shopping with Mom.

768
00:48:35,706 --> 00:48:38,948
- Yeah! I feel so alive!
- Best shopping trip ever!

769
00:49:11,675 --> 00:49:13,580
<i>Perfecto.</i>

770
00:49:13,715 --> 00:49:14,482
<i>Poppy!</i>

771
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:17,450
<i>Poppy!</i>

772
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:22,083
<i>I don't see her, Junior.</i>

773
00:49:22,218 --> 00:49:23,683
Look up, genius.

774
00:49:24,451 --> 00:49:25,819
<i>You're late.</i>

775
00:49:26,729 --> 00:49:28,530
How do I get up there?

776
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:30,023
<i>Use the trampoline.</i>

777
00:49:36,936 --> 00:49:38,106
Here we go.

778
00:50:05,866 --> 00:50:07,066
It is I,

779
00:50:07,202 --> 00:50:11,605
- Poppy Prescott, villainess.

780
00:50:11,741 --> 00:50:13,433
Have a seat, Gru.

781
00:50:13,569 --> 00:50:14,802
All right, I'll sit--

782
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:18,837
Okay. Why am I here?

783
00:50:18,973 --> 00:50:23,943
Because, like you,
I was born to be bad.

784
00:50:24,078 --> 00:50:28,881
And now, it's time to discuss
our big heist.

785
00:50:29,016 --> 00:50:31,984
Pfft, heist. Please.
You're just a child.

786
00:50:33,996 --> 00:50:36,089
All great villains start young.

787
00:50:36,224 --> 00:50:39,233
Didn't you steal the Crown
Jewels when you were 12?

788
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,970
I was a lot younger than that.

789
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:44,071
And, no offense,
but you're not me.

790
00:50:44,816 --> 00:50:47,802
I plan on being
a lot better than you.

791
00:50:48,469 --> 00:50:50,239
Check this out.

792
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:53,073
Hey, is that my old school?

793
00:50:53,209 --> 00:50:54,177
Bingo.

794
00:50:54,313 --> 00:50:55,783
Which I have expertly modeled

795
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:58,277
with glue and Popsicle sticks.

796
00:50:58,413 --> 00:51:03,455
And it's where we are going
to steal the school mascot.

797
00:51:04,322 --> 00:51:05,855
You want to steal Lenny?

798
00:51:05,991 --> 00:51:07,293
Exactly.

799
00:51:07,429 --> 00:51:10,222
Lycée Pas Bon
has always been my dream school.

800
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:13,602
And this heist will look so
great on my villain transcripts.

801
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:15,762
That is a terrible idea.

802
00:51:15,898 --> 00:51:18,874
Have you ever even seen
a honey badger?

803
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:21,033
They are vicious
little monsters.

804
00:51:21,168 --> 00:51:25,043
They literally eat bees
and cobras for breakfast.

805
00:51:25,179 --> 00:51:27,211
Honey badger don't care.

806
00:51:27,346 --> 00:51:29,612
No way. No way am I helping you.

807
00:51:29,747 --> 00:51:32,253
Well, that's the thing
with blackmail,

808
00:51:33,253 --> 00:51:35,117
you kinda have no choice.

809
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:06,115
Okay.

810
00:52:10,385 --> 00:52:11,486
Tim! Tim.

811
00:52:11,621 --> 00:52:13,189
Go, go, go!

812
00:52:17,196 --> 00:52:18,659
Chihuahua.

813
00:52:24,369 --> 00:52:26,642
No!

814
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:37,849
Suppository!

815
00:52:42,021 --> 00:52:43,019
Give it!

816
00:52:43,155 --> 00:52:44,922
Hey! Police!

817
00:52:45,058 --> 00:52:46,294
No problemo!

818
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:56,997
Piña colada.

819
00:53:04,175 --> 00:53:05,175
Help!

820
00:53:07,618 --> 00:53:08,376
Hola.

821
00:53:08,512 --> 00:53:10,014
Please. Can you help me?

822
00:53:10,149 --> 00:53:11,143
<i>Sí, sí.</i>

823
00:53:19,135 --> 00:53:21,560
Hey! All is good. Ciao!

824
00:53:24,685 --> 00:53:26,157
Smudge!
Smudge, come down.

825
00:53:26,197 --> 00:53:27,302
Hey!

826
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:32,835
<i>El gato.</i>

827
00:53:34,207 --> 00:53:36,168
Thank you. Thank you.

828
00:53:38,312 --> 00:53:39,710
Smoocha.

829
00:53:43,049 --> 00:53:44,418
Smoochy.

830
00:53:51,453 --> 00:53:52,560
Help!

831
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:55,388
Bazooka!

832
00:54:19,855 --> 00:54:20,789
Hey, hey.

833
00:54:26,389 --> 00:54:27,593
Yeah!

834
00:54:39,938 --> 00:54:42,274
There they are.
Those guys crushed my car.

835
00:54:42,409 --> 00:54:43,903
They destroyed the coffee shop.

836
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:45,412
Yeah! Get outta here!

837
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:47,174
They're ruining everything.

838
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:49,744
I'm sick of superheroes.
Yeah! Let's get 'em.

839
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,079
No more superheroes!

840
00:54:53,515 --> 00:54:55,153
Get in!

841
00:54:58,363 --> 00:54:59,836
Yeah, get outta here!

842
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,996
Gentlemen…

843
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,792
…our experiment has failed.

844
00:55:03,927 --> 00:55:06,764
You are officially
going to be retired.

845
00:55:06,899 --> 00:55:09,428
Retirement!

846
00:55:09,923 --> 00:55:10,768
No?

847
00:55:26,876 --> 00:55:27,983
There it is.

848
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:38,125
The castle, the gargoyles.

849
00:55:38,261 --> 00:55:40,193
I can't believe
I'm really here.

850
00:55:46,935 --> 00:55:48,471
Okay.

851
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:54,710
Okay.
Let's get this over with.

852
00:55:54,845 --> 00:55:56,811
Ron, hand me my gear.
Voilà.

853
00:55:56,947 --> 00:55:59,111
Keep a close eye on him.
Okay.

854
00:55:59,246 --> 00:56:00,853
If you need anything…

855
00:56:00,988 --> 00:56:03,281
…I brought formula, extra
diapers, his favorite Binky--

856
00:56:03,417 --> 00:56:06,025
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go.

857
00:56:13,635 --> 00:56:16,900
And now, we cut through
the glass with my…

858
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:18,934
diapers?

859
00:56:19,069 --> 00:56:21,437
What? You've got to
be kidding with me.

860
00:56:22,673 --> 00:56:24,138
<i>Muerte a la piñata!</i>

861
00:56:24,274 --> 00:56:27,810
Hey, guys.
Guys. Guys? Guys!

862
00:56:27,946 --> 00:56:30,843
Guys, where is
the other bag with my gear?

863
00:56:30,979 --> 00:56:32,350
Balloon.

864
00:56:37,885 --> 00:56:39,718
What? How--

865
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:42,857
All right. All right.

866
00:56:42,881 --> 00:56:44,517
Let's see what I got in here.

867
00:56:45,436 --> 00:56:48,129
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on.

868
00:56:58,742 --> 00:57:01,340
Easy-peasy.

869
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:21,297
That's Mr. Friendly.

870
00:57:21,433 --> 00:57:23,269
Stupid kids.

871
00:57:25,701 --> 00:57:27,370
No, no, no!

872
00:57:33,842 --> 00:57:34,980
I hate my job.

873
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:39,587
Stupid kids.

874
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:54,635
That's Dr. Destructo.
He was just a kid.

875
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:57,167
And there is Killer Driller's
original helmet.

876
00:57:57,303 --> 00:57:58,434
Come on!

877
00:57:58,569 --> 00:57:59,805
Stay focused.

878
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,618
Diaper.

879
00:58:24,492 --> 00:58:28,167
I need something like--
Something that I can--

880
00:58:28,302 --> 00:58:29,496
How about this?

881
00:58:29,632 --> 00:58:31,133
Nice.

882
00:58:34,342 --> 00:58:35,511
Yes!

883
00:58:39,248 --> 00:58:41,147
We're in.

884
00:58:41,283 --> 00:58:43,808
Wait. No, no, no.

885
00:58:43,944 --> 00:58:44,876
Baby powder!

886
00:58:45,011 --> 00:58:46,016
<i>Sí, sí.</i>

887
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:55,662
You know, the most
important part of a heist

888
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:59,531
is being constantly aware
of potential danger.

889
00:58:59,667 --> 00:59:01,570
Tiramisu!

890
00:59:03,634 --> 00:59:05,337
No. Junior!

891
00:59:05,473 --> 00:59:06,740
Junior, come back here.

892
00:59:09,303 --> 00:59:11,575
So, what's your plan now?

893
00:59:11,711 --> 00:59:13,841
I am dealing with it.

894
00:59:17,145 --> 00:59:18,744
Don't touch anything. No.

895
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,557
No, no, no!

896
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,619
Good job, Junior.
Way to go.

897
00:59:30,863 --> 00:59:32,033
He's having fun.

898
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:33,765
Too much fun.

899
00:59:37,166 --> 00:59:38,670
Please, Junior.

900
00:59:38,806 --> 00:59:41,038
Daddy needs to steal
a honey badger.

901
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:45,944
Okay.

902
00:59:47,045 --> 00:59:49,310
I know they keep
Lenny here at night.

903
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:52,081
And, if memory serves,

904
00:59:52,217 --> 00:59:55,550
there is a hidden switch
around here somewhere.

905
00:59:58,461 --> 00:59:59,958
Yes!

906
01:00:12,035 --> 01:00:13,708
I'll hit him with this.

907
01:00:13,844 --> 01:00:16,471
Once he's knocked out,
we'll open the cage.

908
01:00:16,607 --> 01:00:19,307
That fuzzy demon will
sleep like a baby the whole--

909
01:00:24,822 --> 01:00:27,821
Okay.
He's still asleep.

910
01:00:32,053 --> 01:00:33,992
Mamma mia!

911
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:39,833
I tranked myself.

912
01:00:47,068 --> 01:00:48,534
Hey! Hey!

913
01:00:50,943 --> 01:00:52,714
Gru, what do we do?

914
01:00:53,478 --> 01:00:54,815
No!

915
01:00:58,786 --> 01:01:01,187
Oh, no!
I've ruined our heist.

916
01:01:03,556 --> 01:01:06,090
What? Who dares?

917
01:01:11,827 --> 01:01:13,427
Intruders!

918
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:17,937
Intruders!

919
01:01:29,779 --> 01:01:31,247
Wake up!

920
01:01:32,352 --> 01:01:33,216
No!

921
01:01:39,327 --> 01:01:40,289
What?

922
01:01:51,636 --> 01:01:52,703
No. Nope.

923
01:01:55,335 --> 01:01:57,746
Come on. We have to go.

924
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:05,278
Intruders!

925
01:02:05,414 --> 01:02:07,754
You messed with
the wrong principal.

926
01:02:07,889 --> 01:02:10,550
Here we go.
Come on. Come on.

927
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:18,065
Go, go, go!
Go, go, go.

928
01:02:22,011 --> 01:02:23,156
Come on! Come on!

929
01:02:23,722 --> 01:02:25,466
You won't get away with this.

930
01:02:48,361 --> 01:02:50,623
Prepare to feel
the wrath of Übelschlecht!

931
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,171
Diaper rash cream.

932
01:02:56,306 --> 01:02:57,569
Oh, no. Oh, no!

933
01:02:57,705 --> 01:02:59,297
Stop, stop, stop!

934
01:03:01,541 --> 01:03:02,934
Oh, dear.

935
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:06,841
Get back here, you.

936
01:03:06,976 --> 01:03:09,312
I want my Lenny!

937
01:03:13,117 --> 01:03:15,288
How are we getting out of here?

938
01:03:15,423 --> 01:03:16,990
Follow me.

939
01:03:17,722 --> 01:03:18,717
Get in!

940
01:03:21,289 --> 01:03:23,164
Come on, come on, come on.

941
01:03:25,797 --> 01:03:27,330
Mr. Friendly!

942
01:03:50,393 --> 01:03:53,359
I have to say,
that was without a doubt

943
01:03:53,603 --> 01:03:56,062
the coolest night of my life.

944
01:03:56,197 --> 01:03:58,624
I can't believe
we actually pulled that off.

945
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:03,228
Not gonna lie,
that was pretty fun.

946
01:04:05,804 --> 01:04:06,969
Thanks, Ron.

947
01:04:08,645 --> 01:04:12,375
And thank you for everything.

948
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,608
And hey. Don't worry.

949
01:04:15,744 --> 01:04:18,812
Your secret
is safe with me, partner.

950
01:04:18,948 --> 01:04:20,287
Thanks.

951
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:21,648
Good night.

952
01:04:24,291 --> 01:04:27,354
Your dada did
pretty good, huh, Junior?

953
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:35,530
<i>Sí, sí, sí.</i> Go, go.

954
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:38,231
Hello, Maxime.

955
01:04:38,367 --> 01:04:40,868
How's my favorite student?

956
01:04:41,004 --> 01:04:42,336
You know, I think you and I

957
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,678
might be looking for
the same person.

958
01:04:44,813 --> 01:04:47,916
And I know exactly where he is.

959
01:04:56,024 --> 01:04:58,351
Thank you,
Principal Übelschlecht.

960
01:04:58,486 --> 01:04:59,757
We got him.

961
01:04:59,893 --> 01:05:02,794
Valentina, to Mayflower.

962
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:05,230
With pleasure.

963
01:05:10,756 --> 01:05:11,899
Here we go.

964
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:14,876
Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

965
01:05:15,012 --> 01:05:16,908
It's all coming back to me.

966
01:05:20,674 --> 01:05:23,380
Okay.
See you later.

967
01:05:24,215 --> 01:05:25,585
Say, "Bye, Mommy and Daddy."

968
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:26,750
Have fun at the club!

969
01:05:26,886 --> 01:05:28,819
Make good choices.

970
01:05:28,954 --> 01:05:30,983
Bye, guys.
Goodbye!

971
01:05:31,118 --> 01:05:32,316
Bye!

972
01:05:32,452 --> 01:05:33,724
Hey, Cunninghams.

973
01:05:34,702 --> 01:05:35,925
Hey, Poppy.

974
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:37,775
I heard our parents
are having a playdate,

975
01:05:37,919 --> 01:05:39,493
which is adorable, by the way,

976
01:05:39,629 --> 01:05:42,163
and I thought
you might wanna hang out.

977
01:05:43,041 --> 01:05:44,300
Yeah. Sure. Come on in.

978
01:05:44,436 --> 01:05:47,239
Let's get
this party started, people.

979
01:05:47,906 --> 01:05:49,435
I like her.

980
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:51,906
Yeah. Most people do.

981
01:05:52,041 --> 01:05:53,640
Sweet.

982
01:05:53,775 --> 01:05:56,446
So, have you guys
ever seen a honey badger?

983
01:06:03,645 --> 01:06:05,958
Okay, these guys
aren't messing around.

984
01:06:06,094 --> 01:06:08,491
There are
my favorite new neighbors.

985
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:10,259
Hi.

986
01:06:10,394 --> 01:06:12,624
I'm loving this whole vibe.

987
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,436
You two look like
a couple of pros.

988
01:06:16,796 --> 01:06:18,997
Yeah, but we're not.

989
01:06:19,133 --> 01:06:21,666
Perry and the boys are waiting
for y'all on the court,

990
01:06:21,801 --> 01:06:24,477
and we are
hitting the clubhouse.

991
01:06:24,613 --> 01:06:27,138
And you're telling me where
you got that to-die-for outfit.

992
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:35,048
Over here, Chet.

993
01:06:35,183 --> 01:06:36,288
Hello.

994
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:38,653
Okay.

995
01:06:39,354 --> 01:06:40,351
Skip, Chip, Chet.

996
01:06:40,487 --> 01:06:41,495
Chet, Skip, Chip.

997
01:06:41,631 --> 01:06:42,620
Hey there, fellas.

998
01:06:42,756 --> 01:06:44,293
Hello.
How are you doing, Chet?

999
01:06:44,428 --> 01:06:46,761
Okay.

1000
01:06:46,896 --> 01:06:49,763
Chet here is gonna show
us fellas how it's done.

1001
01:06:50,638 --> 01:06:51,834
Right?

1002
01:06:54,737 --> 01:06:57,938
I'm gonna smoke this guy.

1003
01:06:58,074 --> 01:06:59,509
Okay.

1004
01:07:09,682 --> 01:07:11,719
What the…

1005
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,859
Okay, let's do this.

1006
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:26,837
You've gotta be kidding.

1007
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:30,672
Okay, okay.

1008
01:07:31,173 --> 01:07:32,047
Better?

1009
01:07:38,048 --> 01:07:39,276
What?

1010
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:41,953
That doesn't count.

1011
01:07:42,088 --> 01:07:43,253
And--

1012
01:07:43,388 --> 01:07:46,091
What? You can't just j--
Hey!

1013
01:07:46,227 --> 01:07:48,723
This is ridiculous!

1014
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,698
…burrito.

1015
01:08:03,505 --> 01:08:04,903
Thanks, Ron.

1016
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,208
Hey, no! Oh, no.

1017
01:08:08,785 --> 01:08:10,312
Come and get it.

1018
01:08:10,736 --> 01:08:12,079
He's so cute.

1019
01:08:12,618 --> 01:08:16,117
This is the weirdest dog ever.

1020
01:08:16,252 --> 01:08:17,455
I'll get it.

1021
01:08:27,093 --> 01:08:31,096
Well, hello, little one.
Is your daddy home?

1022
01:08:31,231 --> 01:08:34,899
Sorry. I'm not "stupposed"
to talk to strangers.

1023
01:08:35,924 --> 01:08:37,668
I'm not a stranger.

1024
01:08:37,804 --> 01:08:40,605
Well, you look strange to me.

1025
01:08:41,924 --> 01:08:43,111
Who is it?

1026
01:08:43,247 --> 01:08:44,975
I don't know.

1027
01:08:45,111 --> 01:08:48,954
But she's old
and smells like pickles.

1028
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:54,690
Okay, I'm coming.

1029
01:08:58,294 --> 01:08:59,495
Oh, no. Oh.

1030
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:01,829
I'll be right back.

1031
01:09:04,498 --> 01:09:05,364
Can I help you?

1032
01:09:05,499 --> 01:09:06,974
Well, I hope so.

1033
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:09,441
I'm an old friend of Gru's.

1034
01:09:10,309 --> 01:09:12,780
Well, he's not here, so…

1035
01:09:13,454 --> 01:09:15,183
That's all right.

1036
01:09:16,147 --> 01:09:17,581
I'll wait.

1037
01:09:21,461 --> 01:09:23,047
What? No.

1038
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:26,689
Whenever you're ready, Perry.

1039
01:09:36,662 --> 01:09:37,730
Needless to say,

1040
01:09:37,865 --> 01:09:39,566
Perry and I are
no longer welcome

1041
01:09:39,701 --> 01:09:42,172
on the island of Oahu.

1042
01:09:42,308 --> 01:09:44,638
- True story.

1043
01:09:44,774 --> 01:09:46,380
Honey!
Oh, thank goodness.

1044
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:48,876
It's the children.
We have to go now.

1045
01:09:51,545 --> 01:09:53,020
Thanks. Bye.

1046
01:09:53,155 --> 01:09:55,151
Our cover's blown!
What?

1047
01:09:55,287 --> 01:09:57,185
Call Silas!
Oh, no.

1048
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:25,814
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

1049
01:10:33,227 --> 01:10:34,752
Gru's been compromised.

1050
01:10:34,888 --> 01:10:36,721
This is an emergency, people.

1051
01:10:36,857 --> 01:10:39,031
Retirement is officially over.

1052
01:10:39,167 --> 01:10:41,533
Assemble the Mega Minions.

1053
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,578
Pomodoro!

1054
01:11:00,539 --> 01:11:01,445
Pomodoro!

1055
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,969
Hey.

1056
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,372
Busy bee.

1057
01:11:22,008 --> 01:11:23,467
Pomodoro!

1058
01:11:30,885 --> 01:11:32,045
Pomodoro!

1059
01:11:34,385 --> 01:11:36,668
Pomodoro!

1060
01:11:55,404 --> 01:11:56,438
So…

1061
01:11:56,574 --> 01:11:59,175
your father has been naughty.

1062
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:01,614
Very naughty.

1063
01:12:01,749 --> 01:12:05,817
He took something of mine
that I desperately want back.

1064
01:12:10,423 --> 01:12:12,217
Principal Übelschlecht?

1065
01:12:14,105 --> 01:12:16,326
I know you took my Lenny.

1066
01:12:16,462 --> 01:12:18,023
Now hand him over.

1067
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:20,924
That's actually
a very funny story.

1068
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:22,103
Zip it.

1069
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:23,835
I don't wanna hear your excuses.

1070
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:26,198
I'm here to teach you a lesson.
Let's go, tough guy.

1071
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:29,600
Okay. Okay. I'm not going to
fight an old lady.

1072
01:12:29,735 --> 01:12:31,436
Oh, yeah?

1073
01:12:31,572 --> 01:12:34,440
Well, I'm gonna give you a
whupping for the history books.

1074
01:12:38,183 --> 01:12:39,783
Take that.

1075
01:12:43,958 --> 01:12:45,756
Yeah! Go!

1076
01:12:45,891 --> 01:12:48,324
Girls, look out! Over here!

1077
01:12:48,459 --> 01:12:50,255
Everyone, get down!

1078
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:53,599
Hey, back off, lady!

1079
01:13:04,737 --> 01:13:05,837
Stop it!

1080
01:13:05,972 --> 01:13:07,572
Let him go!

1081
01:13:07,707 --> 01:13:08,746
Take that!

1082
01:13:17,690 --> 01:13:20,584
Now we have to get in
there and find that baby.

1083
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:21,858
What?

1084
01:13:25,397 --> 01:13:26,994
Oh, jackpot, huh?

1085
01:13:27,129 --> 01:13:29,830
<i>Ay,</i> Maxime.
This is too easy.

1086
01:13:29,965 --> 01:13:32,532
Come here, little <i>bébé.</i>

1087
01:13:32,667 --> 01:13:34,032
Come to Maxime.

1088
01:13:34,168 --> 01:13:36,110
Yes. Coochy, coochy--

1089
01:13:37,261 --> 01:13:38,207
<i>Ay,</i> Maxime.

1090
01:13:38,343 --> 01:13:39,507
You little--

1091
01:13:39,643 --> 01:13:42,241
You are in big trouble.

1092
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:44,419
Gotcha!

1093
01:13:56,430 --> 01:13:57,723
Wait. Where's the baby?

1094
01:13:57,858 --> 01:13:59,560
Where's the baby?

1095
01:13:59,695 --> 01:14:01,297
Junior?

1096
01:14:05,469 --> 01:14:06,500
Lucy!

1097
01:14:06,636 --> 01:14:07,807
Go after the baby.

1098
01:14:10,737 --> 01:14:11,671
Maxime.

1099
01:14:11,806 --> 01:14:13,574
Say au revoir, Gru.

1100
01:14:13,928 --> 01:14:14,975
And don't worry.

1101
01:14:15,111 --> 01:14:18,112
He will be very happy
with his new daddy.

1102
01:14:18,147 --> 01:14:21,545
Right? Look at him.
He loves his new daddy.

1103
01:14:21,781 --> 01:14:23,153
Junior!

1104
01:14:25,223 --> 01:14:26,956
No!

1105
01:14:31,032 --> 01:14:32,258
Get in.

1106
01:14:33,126 --> 01:14:34,964
We've got a baby to save.

1107
01:14:42,938 --> 01:14:44,676
We got him!

1108
01:14:45,874 --> 01:14:48,281
Who is ready
to become a little roach?

1109
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:50,381
Let go!

1110
01:14:50,517 --> 01:14:52,054
Those are very sensitive.

1111
01:14:52,517 --> 01:14:53,853
You squirmy little--

1112
01:14:56,912 --> 01:14:58,017
Are you kidding me?

1113
01:14:58,592 --> 01:15:00,553
You got pee-pee
all over my ship.

1114
01:15:02,657 --> 01:15:03,626
Valentina!

1115
01:15:03,761 --> 01:15:05,965
Bring me the Roachification Ray!

1116
01:15:09,302 --> 01:15:10,637
There they are.

1117
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:14,234
I'm on it.

1118
01:15:14,934 --> 01:15:16,577
Here we go.

1119
01:15:32,066 --> 01:15:33,357
What's that?

1120
01:15:34,734 --> 01:15:35,654
Hello.

1121
01:15:36,499 --> 01:15:37,492
Gru!

1122
01:15:37,627 --> 01:15:39,193
Get me closer!

1123
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:43,463
Almost there.

1124
01:15:44,998 --> 01:15:46,005
Take them out!

1125
01:15:58,221 --> 01:16:00,181
You're doing great.

1126
01:16:05,723 --> 01:16:07,122
Go get 'em, partner.

1127
01:16:24,072 --> 01:16:26,273
<i>Ay!</i> I can't see!

1128
01:16:42,031 --> 01:16:43,224
Junior!

1129
01:16:44,193 --> 01:16:46,363
Don't worry, Gru.

1130
01:16:46,499 --> 01:16:48,101
The baby is fine.

1131
01:16:48,237 --> 01:16:49,904
See for yourself.

1132
01:16:53,545 --> 01:16:54,901
Junior.

1133
01:16:55,036 --> 01:16:56,574
And now he belongs to me.

1134
01:16:56,709 --> 01:16:59,306
Isn't that right, Maxime Jr?

1135
01:17:00,383 --> 01:17:02,280
Together we will wreak havoc,

1136
01:17:02,415 --> 01:17:03,516
cause mayhem,

1137
01:17:03,651 --> 01:17:05,777
and have so much fun doing it.

1138
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:10,024
And best of all, he hates you!

1139
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:11,355
He really does.

1140
01:17:11,491 --> 01:17:13,425
Let my son go!

1141
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,356
No, I don't think so.

1142
01:17:15,491 --> 01:17:18,328
The fun is just about
to start, huh?

1143
01:17:28,201 --> 01:17:30,977
Look at what a coward
your old daddy is, huh?

1144
01:17:58,474 --> 01:18:00,174
You crossed the line, Maxime.

1145
01:18:00,309 --> 01:18:01,899
Now, give me my son.

1146
01:18:02,035 --> 01:18:03,176
I told you.

1147
01:18:03,312 --> 01:18:05,144
He is my son now.

1148
01:18:16,149 --> 01:18:18,048
Watch your step, Gru.

1149
01:18:18,184 --> 01:18:19,419
It's a doozy!

1150
01:18:20,538 --> 01:18:22,422
Too bad you can't fly, huh?

1151
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:31,002
Let go!

1152
01:18:42,713 --> 01:18:44,375
This ends now!

1153
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:47,513
Say goodbye to Daddy.

1154
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:54,256
It's okay, Junior.

1155
01:18:55,022 --> 01:18:56,390
Dada loves you.

1156
01:19:21,522 --> 01:19:22,452
Get back here.

1157
01:19:22,587 --> 01:19:23,619
Bad baby.

1158
01:19:25,252 --> 01:19:26,885
Get off me, you demon.

1159
01:19:27,021 --> 01:19:30,193
- You're going to
feel the wrath of--

1160
01:19:53,015 --> 01:19:55,454
See? Not a scratch.

1161
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:57,090
What?

1162
01:19:57,226 --> 01:19:59,819
Salami!

1163
01:20:01,593 --> 01:20:04,029
Pastrami!

1164
01:20:05,896 --> 01:20:07,466
No, no, no, no, no.

1165
01:20:10,802 --> 01:20:12,868
- What?
- Prosciutto!

1166
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:14,974
Gross!

1167
01:20:19,173 --> 01:20:21,046
Nice try. When I--

1168
01:20:24,281 --> 01:20:27,019
Antipasti.

1169
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:34,790
Gru.
Gru!

1170
01:20:34,926 --> 01:20:36,153
- Yeah, yeah!
- Junior!

1171
01:20:40,763 --> 01:20:41,998
Yes!

1172
01:20:42,429 --> 01:20:43,297
Holy cow!

1173
01:20:43,432 --> 01:20:45,172
- You guys okay?
- That was insane!

1174
01:20:50,169 --> 01:20:51,208
Dada.

1175
01:20:58,405 --> 01:21:00,278
- My boys.
- Dada.

1176
01:21:00,414 --> 01:21:02,021
You know something?

1177
01:21:02,156 --> 01:21:06,986
Today has been a real
roller coaster of emotion.

1178
01:21:10,995 --> 01:21:11,860
Gru?

1179
01:21:11,996 --> 01:21:13,868
Can we go back home now?

1180
01:21:18,970 --> 01:21:20,900
All right. There you go.

1181
01:21:23,042 --> 01:21:24,538
Thanks, Dr. Nefario.

1182
01:21:25,513 --> 01:21:26,445
Good as new.

1183
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:27,942
No job too small,

1184
01:21:28,077 --> 01:21:30,181
or too mad.

1185
01:21:30,847 --> 01:21:31,910
Bye, then.

1186
01:21:32,045 --> 01:21:33,118
Bye.

1187
01:21:41,190 --> 01:21:43,855
Hey. You okay, sweetie?

1188
01:21:43,990 --> 01:21:47,858
Agnes,
someone's here to see you!

1189
01:21:55,676 --> 01:21:57,604
Lucky?

1190
01:22:01,878 --> 01:22:02,950
Lucky!

1191
01:22:06,350 --> 01:22:08,553
Did you practice your tricks?

1192
01:22:08,688 --> 01:22:10,584
Okay. Play dead.

1193
01:22:17,756 --> 01:22:20,931
- That was disturbing.
- Yeah, little bit.

1194
01:22:21,066 --> 01:22:22,893
- Lucky.

1195
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:27,001
Hey, I'll…
I'll be back soon.

1196
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:28,670
Okay.

1197
01:22:28,805 --> 01:22:30,308
There's something
I need to take care of.

1198
01:22:30,332 --> 01:22:31,073
Yeah.

1199
01:22:31,209 --> 01:22:33,178
See you later, buddy.

1200
01:22:33,779 --> 01:22:34,743
Love you, honey.

1201
01:22:42,824 --> 01:22:44,791
How you doing, Maxime?

1202
01:22:45,457 --> 01:22:47,252
What are you doing here, Gru?

1203
01:22:47,387 --> 01:22:48,893
You came to gloat? No?

1204
01:22:49,028 --> 01:22:50,592
Gloat? No, no, no, no. I just--

1205
01:22:50,727 --> 01:22:53,428
- I wanted to
get something off my chest.

1206
01:22:53,563 --> 01:22:56,762
And it concerns
the ninth-grade talent show.

1207
01:22:57,736 --> 01:22:58,764
Well,

1208
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:00,502
actually,

1209
01:23:01,402 --> 01:23:03,839
I did steal your song.

1210
01:23:03,974 --> 01:23:05,903
What? I knew it!

1211
01:23:06,038 --> 01:23:08,875
I knew there was no coincidence.
You little liar!

1212
01:23:10,749 --> 01:23:11,715
Well?

1213
01:23:11,850 --> 01:23:13,184
Well, what?

1214
01:23:13,319 --> 01:23:14,781
Well, where's my apology?
Apolo--

1215
01:23:14,916 --> 01:23:17,952
What are you talking about?
I just apologized.

1216
01:23:18,087 --> 01:23:19,317
No, no, no.

1217
01:23:19,453 --> 01:23:21,287
No, that was no apology.

1218
01:23:21,423 --> 01:23:23,360
You just wanted to rub it in.

1219
01:23:23,496 --> 01:23:26,227
I can't believe
you stole my song!

1220
01:23:26,363 --> 01:23:28,308
I only did that to
get back at you

1221
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:30,800
for pantsing me
at the homecoming dance.

1222
01:23:30,935 --> 01:23:34,138
- Besides, you could've
gone on after me.

1223
01:23:34,274 --> 01:23:37,139
It is not my fault
that you were afraid.

1224
01:23:37,274 --> 01:23:40,105
Afraid because I killed it!

1225
01:23:40,241 --> 01:23:41,319
Afraid?

1226
01:23:42,077 --> 01:23:44,174
I could outsing you
any day of the week

1227
01:23:44,334 --> 01:23:45,819
and all day Sunday.

1228
01:23:47,014 --> 01:23:48,455
I'd like to see that.

1229
01:23:48,591 --> 01:23:50,557
Anytime, anyplace.
