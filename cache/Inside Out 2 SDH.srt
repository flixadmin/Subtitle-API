179
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:34,608
My penalty almost lost us
the game today.

180
00:07:34,609 --> 00:07:36,693
What if I get to camp
and I screw it up?

181
00:07:36,694 --> 00:07:38,195
Hey, don't talk like that.

182
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:40,406
Yeah,
you did great today, honey.

183
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:42,409
Exactly. Mom gets it.

184
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:44,244
Yeah, I guess.

185
00:07:44,411 --> 00:07:46,204
We're so proud of you.

186
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:48,080
Night, monkey.

- All right, all right.

188
00:07:49,624 --> 00:07:50,957
Sleep tight, honey.

[sighs]

191
00:07:56,506 --> 00:07:59,342
Oh, Riley's so hard
on herself.

192
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:01,469
But we can make
everything easier.

193

This is for all those memories

198
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,356
that belong
in the Back of the Mind,

199
00:08:14,357 --> 00:08:16,108
like this penalty one.

200
00:08:16,109 --> 00:08:18,944
It's weighing on her,
so let's lighten the load.

201

A one-way expressway to,

202
00:08:20,988 --> 00:08:23,616
"We're not gonna think
about that right now." Whoo!

203
00:08:26,578 --> 00:08:27,661
- [Anger] Not bad.
- [Sadness] Oh, Joy.

204
00:08:27,662 --> 00:08:28,954
- That's pretty impressive.
- You worked hard.

205
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:31,208
You take such good care
of Riley.

206
00:08:31,374 --> 00:08:32,833
Thanks, I try.

207
00:08:32,834 --> 00:08:34,294
Okay, let's do a sweep.

208
00:08:35,045 --> 00:08:36,670
Oh, here's one
where she waved at a guy

209
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:38,964
who was actually waving
at a girl behind her.

210
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:41,175
Oh, that was so bad.
Good choice.

211
00:08:41,176 --> 00:08:43,884
Oh, here's when she forgot
that girl's name.

212
00:08:43,885 --> 00:08:45,011
Oh, yeah,
that was super awkward.

213
00:08:45,012 --> 00:08:46,097
What was her name?

214
00:08:46,098 --> 00:08:47,264
I don't know,
Janet or something?

215
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:49,016
Whatever. Let's just
get rid of it. Oh! [chuckles]

216
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:53,604
We keep the best
and toss the rest. [sighs]

217
00:08:53,605 --> 00:08:54,938
Nice work, everyone.

218
00:08:54,939 --> 00:08:56,022
All right, Anger,

219
00:08:56,023 --> 00:08:57,692
the rest of these babies
can go to long-term.

220
00:09:04,824 --> 00:09:06,743
Oh, okay.
Let's get some shut-eye.

221
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:08,370
Big day tomorrow.

222
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:17,336
Joy, are you taking that

223
00:09:17,337 --> 00:09:19,880
where I think
you're taking that?

224
00:09:19,881 --> 00:09:22,174
- Wanna come this time?
- Yes.

225
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,259
I mean no. I...

226
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,802
Oh, no. I really shouldn't.

227
00:09:25,803 --> 00:09:27,054
You know, you're the only one

228
00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:28,847
who hasn't been
to the Belief System.

229
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:30,391
Yeah, it's just that it's new,

230
00:09:30,392 --> 00:09:32,269
and I know
how important it is.

231
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:35,562
And I don't wanna mess it up
or break it,

232
00:09:35,563 --> 00:09:38,023
or burn it to the ground
or anything.

233
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:40,609
Sadness, you won't hurt it,
I promise.

234
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,236
Have I ever
steered you wrong before?

235
00:09:42,237 --> 00:09:44,196
Yeah, many times.

236
00:09:44,197 --> 00:09:45,406

Can't you just lay off for,
like, one second?

Uh, overreact much?

this day would come.

make a big deal about this.

Remain calm.
Stick to the prepared script.

You are not gross, honey.

00:14:35,738 --> 00:14:37,782
You're just changing.

338
00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:39,450
Remember that
beautiful butterfly

339
00:14:39,451 --> 00:14:41,078

that caterpillar...</i>

get your wings.</i>

- But if you have questions...
- Oh, my gosh, Mom!

346
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:51,463
Just go away! Ugh!

347
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,007
Well, that's a preview
of the next 10 years.

348
00:14:55,717 --> 00:14:57,343
- Riley!
- Oh, my gosh!

349
00:14:57,344 --> 00:14:58,511
- We're gonna have so much fun!
- [Dad] All right.

350

Who's ready for hockey camp?

351
00:15:00,555 --> 00:15:01,681
[girls] Oh, yeah!

352

[Joy] <i>Okay, until we can
figure this out,</i>

353
00:15:03,558 --> 00:15:06,228
nobody touch the console
unless you really need to.

354
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:10,440
So, big weekend for us.
What do you wanna do?

355
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:12,316
Well, we could finally
clean out the garage.

356
00:15:12,317 --> 00:15:13,985
Or, actually,
we can get upstairs...

357
00:15:14,236 --> 00:15:16,238
How great
is next year gonna be?

358
00:15:16,404 --> 00:15:19,741
Coach Roberts' team has been
state champs like every year.

359
00:15:20,117 --> 00:15:23,411
And Val Ortiz
is the captain now.

360
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:26,539
This Valentina Ortiz obsession
is outta control.

361
00:15:26,706 --> 00:15:29,209
Uh, she made the Fire Hawks
when she was only a freshman.

362
00:15:29,376 --> 00:15:31,086
That's really hard.

363
00:15:31,253 --> 00:15:33,255
All we have to do
is be super awesome at camp,

364
00:15:33,421 --> 00:15:37,259
Coach will put us on the team,
and we'll all be Fire Hawks!

365
00:15:38,093 --> 00:15:39,594
- Wait, what was that?
- What was what?

366
00:15:39,761 --> 00:15:41,638
We got a look.
I don't like this.

367
00:15:41,804 --> 00:15:43,055
What? You're paranoid.

368
00:15:43,056 --> 00:15:44,307
I never miss a look.

369
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,187
[Disgust] Enhance 224... 176.

370
00:15:49,354 --> 00:15:50,980
Track right. Zoom in.

371
00:15:51,398 --> 00:15:53,483
Right there!

372
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,610
- So?
- She's hiding something.

373
00:15:55,777 --> 00:15:57,028
But what?

374
00:15:59,697 --> 00:16:00,698
What is she doing?

375
00:16:00,865 --> 00:16:02,034
She's looking at our look!

376
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,911
No, it's much more than that.

377
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:08,664
She looks the same to me.

378
00:16:08,665 --> 00:16:10,083
Overlay and compare.

379
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,877
See? Riley then, Riley now.
Riley then, Riley now.

380
00:16:13,878 --> 00:16:15,505
- [all gasp, exclaim]
- Oh, It's so obvious!

381
00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:16,756
But what does it mean?

382
00:16:17,507 --> 00:16:19,551
She knows
we're hiding something.

383
00:16:21,469 --> 00:16:22,678
What is happening right now?

384
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:23,762
I don't know! I don't know!

385
00:16:23,763 --> 00:16:25,972
- I can't take this anymore!
- Ah!

386
00:16:25,973 --> 00:16:27,642
You spilled the tea!

387
00:16:27,975 --> 00:16:29,644
Coach Roberts isn't gonna be
our coach next year.

388
00:16:29,811 --> 00:16:30,812
Grace!

389
00:16:30,813 --> 00:16:31,938
[whimpers]

390
00:16:33,273 --> 00:16:36,067
We... We got assigned to
a different high school.

391
00:16:36,068 --> 00:16:37,194
A-ha! Oh...

392
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,403
Oh, no.

393
00:16:39,404 --> 00:16:40,571
Oh...

394
00:16:40,572 --> 00:16:41,822
Okay. Um...

395
00:16:41,823 --> 00:16:43,615
Yeah. No big deal.

396
00:16:43,616 --> 00:16:45,742
- This is a huge deal!
- Our life is over!

397
00:16:45,743 --> 00:16:46,993
Is she serious right now?

398
00:16:46,994 --> 00:16:48,079
How long have they known this?

399
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,163
- [Fear] I can't breathe.
- We can't go to high school

400
00:16:49,164 --> 00:16:51,623
- without Bree and Grace.
- We won't know anybody.

401
00:16:51,624 --> 00:16:52,999
We'll still get to hang out.

402
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,710
And we'll have this weekend,

403
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:56,462
which means
we'll get one last time

404
00:16:56,463 --> 00:16:57,672
playing on the same team.

405
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,674
Friends are forever, right?

406
00:17:00,508 --> 00:17:02,634
Yeah. Of course.

407
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:03,760
[both] Whoo!

408
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:05,180
I can't wait
to get to the rink.

409
00:17:05,346 --> 00:17:06,347
When do we get our schedules?

410
00:17:06,348 --> 00:17:08,765
[Grace]
I heard our room has a view...

411
00:17:08,766 --> 00:17:10,809
Oh, this is so sad.

412
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,477
No, wait, Sadness!

413
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:13,938
- No, no, no! Don't!
- I don't have a good grip!

414
00:17:14,147 --> 00:17:15,981
Just keep it together
until we're out of the car.

415
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:18,608
[Dad] Here we are.

416
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:20,903
This looks really cool.

417
00:17:21,071 --> 00:17:22,612
{\an8}Are you sure you don't need
an assistant coach?

418
00:17:22,613 --> 00:17:23,698
'Cause I am available.

419
00:17:23,864 --> 00:17:25,199
[Mom] Bill!
[Dad] No? All right.

420
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,784
- We'll see you in a few days.
- [Mom] Have fun!

421
00:17:26,951 --> 00:17:27,993
- [Bree] Thanks so much. Bye!
- Don't miss us too much.

422
00:17:28,161 --> 00:17:29,871
- Okay, bye!
- Wait. Riley,

423
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:31,331
are you sure
you have everything?

424
00:17:31,456 --> 00:17:32,457
- Stick?
- Yes.

425
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,540
- Gloves?
- Yes.

426
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,916
- You have your phone?
- Yes, of course.

427
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:36,585
- Fully charged?
- Yeah, it's like 50.

428
00:17:36,586 --> 00:17:37,753
- What?
- Dad, it's fine.

429
00:17:37,754 --> 00:17:39,381
Okay, call us if you need us.

430
00:17:39,547 --> 00:17:40,548
I love you. Go get 'em.

431
00:17:40,715 --> 00:17:41,758
Okay. Love you guys.

432
00:17:41,924 --> 00:17:44,052
- Don't forget the deodorant!
- Mom!

433
00:17:44,261 --> 00:17:45,262
Bye, monkey.

434
00:17:47,597 --> 00:17:49,932
Okay, now.

435
00:17:50,517 --> 00:17:52,519
[crying]

436
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:57,315
It's okay. We need this.

437
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:00,860
[sniffles]

438
00:18:01,611 --> 00:18:02,612
[gasps]

439
00:18:03,071 --> 00:18:04,988
[Disgust] <i>Guys,
these are high-schoolers.</i>

440
00:18:04,989 --> 00:18:06,115
- Oh...
- We do not wanna be

441
00:18:06,116 --> 00:18:07,199
red and puffy, do we?

442
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,284
No.

443
00:18:08,285 --> 00:18:10,036
Don't worry,
we'll have plenty of time

444
00:18:10,037 --> 00:18:11,912
to think about this
after camp.

445
00:18:11,913 --> 00:18:14,082
<i>Now, where did
Bree and Grace go?</i>

446
00:18:14,582 --> 00:18:15,958
- Oh! There they are.
- Wait.

447
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:18,086
Aren't those traitors
dead to us?

448
00:18:18,253 --> 00:18:19,962
Our best friends?
[scoffs] No.

449
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,300
[girl] Whoa! Hey!

450
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:25,260
Are you okay?

451
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:28,470
[gasps] Everybody act regular.
It's Valentina Ortiz.

452
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:29,764
- Ah!
- We gotta say something.

453
00:18:30,182 --> 00:18:32,016
- Uh...
- Hey.

454
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:33,725
- Hi. I'm Val...
- I know.

455
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:34,810
You're the varsity captain,

456
00:18:34,811 --> 00:18:36,520
you set the all-time
goal record as a junior,

457
00:18:36,521 --> 00:18:37,854
your favorite color's red,
and your skates...

458
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:39,022
What are we saying?

459
00:18:39,023 --> 00:18:40,357
We are so uncool.

460
00:18:40,358 --> 00:18:42,318
Why are we
still holding her hand?

461
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:44,070
Just like me.
[gasps, chuckles nervously]

462
00:18:44,071 --> 00:18:45,988
Oh, you're the one
Coach told us about.

463
00:18:46,156 --> 00:18:47,907
Riley, from Michigan, right?

464
00:18:48,075 --> 00:18:49,658
- It's Minnesota, sweetie.
- No, no, no.

465
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:51,994
We cannot correct Val Ortiz.

466
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,539
[laughs] Yeah, that's me.

467
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:57,125
Riley from good old Michigan.

468
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,919
Orange?
Who made the console orange?

469
00:19:00,087 --> 00:19:01,671
- Do I look orange?
- I didn't touch it.

470
00:19:01,838 --> 00:19:03,256
- Orange is not my color.
- Not me.

471
00:19:04,006 --> 00:19:06,258
- Hello, everybody.
- [all scream]

472
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:08,845
Oh, my gosh. I am just
such a huge fan of yours.

473
00:19:09,011 --> 00:19:11,847
And now, here I am,
meeting you, face to face.

474
00:19:11,848 --> 00:19:13,765
[squeals]
Okay. How can I help?

475
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:15,143
- Uh... [exclaims]
- I can take notes,

476
00:19:15,268 --> 00:19:16,686
get coffee, manage your
calendar, walk your dog,

477
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:18,355
carry your things,
watch you sleep.

478
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:21,149
Wow! You have a lot of energy.
[chuckles]

479
00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:23,109
Maybe you could just
stay in one place.

480
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,194
Anything.

481
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:25,820
Just call my name,
and I am here for you.

482
00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:27,030
Okay, love that.

483
00:19:27,197 --> 00:19:28,448
- And what was your name again?
- Oh.

484
00:19:28,615 --> 00:19:30,074
I'm sorry.
I can get ahead of myself.

485
00:19:30,075 --> 00:19:31,158
I'm Anxiety.

486
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:32,535
I'm one of
Riley's new emotions.

487
00:19:32,702 --> 00:19:34,829
And we are just
super-jazzed to be here.

488
00:19:34,996 --> 00:19:36,205
Where can I put my stuff?

489
00:19:36,206 --> 00:19:37,706
Uh-uh-uh.
What do you mean "we"?

490
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:38,790
[female voice
sighs in exasperation]

491
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,377
[female voice] I wish I was
as tall as all of you. [grunts]

492
00:19:41,378 --> 00:19:43,587
- Who the heck are you?
- [grunting, panting]

493
00:19:43,588 --> 00:19:44,921
I'm Envy.

494
00:19:44,922 --> 00:19:47,216
Oh! Look at your hair.

495
00:19:47,217 --> 00:19:49,218
- Oh, yeah, not happening.
- [gasps]

496
00:19:49,219 --> 00:19:50,595
Look at her hair!

497
00:19:50,762 --> 00:19:52,722
We need hair like that.

498
00:19:52,889 --> 00:19:55,307
Oh, my gosh.
I love the red in your hair.

499
00:19:55,308 --> 00:19:56,558
- Oh...
- [Disgust gasps]

500
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,186
What are you doing?

501
00:19:58,686 --> 00:20:00,437
Hey,
maybe when I make the team,

502
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:02,064
I can join Team Redhead, too!

503
00:20:02,065 --> 00:20:03,150
Yeah, yeah.

504
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:05,609
[whimpers]

505
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,777
[gasps]

506
00:20:06,778 --> 00:20:08,196
Okay, who's this guy?

507
00:20:08,363 --> 00:20:10,073
What's your name, big fella?

508
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,366
That's Embarrassment.

509
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:12,949
He's not really big
on eye contact,

510
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,827
or uh, like, good talking,

511
00:20:14,994 --> 00:20:16,288
but he's a really sweet guy.

512
00:20:16,454 --> 00:20:19,665
Well, welcome to Headquarters,
Embarrassment.

513
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:21,376
Oh, we're doing a... No.

514
00:20:21,543 --> 00:20:22,585
No, going high. Oh.

515
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,421
You got a real sweaty palm
there, buddy. [chuckles]

516
00:20:25,422 --> 00:20:26,713
[Embarrassment whimpering]

517
00:20:26,714 --> 00:20:28,507
Hey, do you wanna
come with me, actually?

518
00:20:28,508 --> 00:20:29,841
You can meet some of
the other Fire Hawks.

519
00:20:29,842 --> 00:20:31,010
[Anxiety] <i>Ooh,
this is exciting.</i>

520
00:20:31,178 --> 00:20:33,305
But we can't let her know
we're excited.

521
00:20:34,013 --> 00:20:35,431
Yeah, sounds good.

522
00:20:35,432 --> 00:20:36,849
What emotion was that?

523
00:20:37,016 --> 00:20:38,060
That's Ennui.

524
00:20:38,226 --> 00:20:39,976
- An-what?
- [female voice 2 sighs]

525
00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:41,271
Ennui.

526
00:20:41,438 --> 00:20:43,898
It's what you would call
the boredom.

527
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:46,651
Well, come on up here, An-wer.

528
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:47,985
Am I saying it right?

529
00:20:48,153 --> 00:20:49,486
An-wah. No.

530
00:20:49,487 --> 00:20:51,573
Oh, nicknames!
I'm gonna call you Wee-Wee.

531
00:20:51,739 --> 00:20:52,907
No.

532
00:20:53,491 --> 00:20:54,826
How are you driving?

533
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:56,577
- Console app.
- [beeps]

534
00:20:56,578 --> 00:20:58,495
Hey! Stop it! That's enough.

535
00:20:58,496 --> 00:21:00,539
Now, now,
I know new emotions

536
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,335
can sometimes feel
unhelpful at first,

537
00:21:03,501 --> 00:21:05,419
and you just wanna...
[grunting]

538
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,505
say to them,
"Why are you so annoying?"

539
00:21:08,131 --> 00:21:12,427
But I've learned that every
emotion is good for Riley.

540
00:21:12,927 --> 00:21:14,636
- Even this turkey.
- [Sadness chuckles]

541
00:21:14,637 --> 00:21:16,430
Okay, fine.

542
00:21:16,431 --> 00:21:17,723
[Ennui sighs]

543
00:21:17,724 --> 00:21:18,891
Cool. Lead the way.

544
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:21,060
All right. Grab your stuff
and follow me.

545
00:21:21,061 --> 00:21:22,770
[Sadness] <i>Oh, but what about
our friends?</i>

546
00:21:22,937 --> 00:21:24,688
[Envy] <i>Val is our future.</i>

547
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:26,190
Yes, I agree completely.

548
00:21:26,191 --> 00:21:27,441
We need new friends or else

549
00:21:27,442 --> 00:21:29,486
we'll be totally alone
in high school.

550
00:21:29,652 --> 00:21:30,653
- Right, Joy?
- Well...

551
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,988
- I mean, maybe, um...
- Here we go!

552
00:21:32,155 --> 00:21:33,156
Wait up.

553
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,033
Thanks for showing me around.

554
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,326
Wait, why did you do that?

555
00:21:36,493 --> 00:21:37,785
Sorry. What did I do?

556
00:21:37,952 --> 00:21:39,621
We just left
our best friends behind.

557
00:21:39,787 --> 00:21:41,580
But what about the new ones
that we're about to meet?

558
00:21:41,581 --> 00:21:42,664
No. Okay.

559
00:21:42,665 --> 00:21:45,709
These next three days need
to be about Bree and Grace.

560
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,045
Joy, the next three days
could determine

561
00:21:48,046 --> 00:21:49,963
the next four years
of our lives.

562
00:21:49,964 --> 00:21:52,966
[chuckles] Now, I think
that's overstating things a bit.

563
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:55,345
Ooh, la, la.
Joy is so old school.

564
00:21:55,512 --> 00:21:56,513
What?

565
00:21:56,514 --> 00:21:57,930
Look, we all have a job to do.

566
00:21:58,098 --> 00:21:59,265
You make Riley happy,

567
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:00,349
Sadness makes her sad,

568
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,685
Fear protects her from
the scary stuff she can see,

569
00:22:02,852 --> 00:22:04,478
and my job is to protect her

570
00:22:04,479 --> 00:22:06,148
from the scary stuff
she can't see.

571
00:22:06,314 --> 00:22:08,191
I plan for the future.

572
00:22:08,358 --> 00:22:10,152
Oh, I can show you.
You're gonna love this.

573
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,237
[console beeps]

574
00:22:13,238 --> 00:22:14,863
I was using that
as a cup holder.

575
00:22:14,864 --> 00:22:17,158
Okay, so my team
has run all the data,

576
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:18,492
and we're looking
at the following

577
00:22:18,493 --> 00:22:19,618
likely scenarios.

578
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:21,578
First, we don't take
this camp seriously,

579
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:22,789
and we goof off
with Bree and Grace.

580
00:22:22,955 --> 00:22:25,292
Riley looks really uncool
in front of Val.

581
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,542
She fails to
impress the coach,

582
00:22:26,543 --> 00:22:27,918
does not become a Fire Hawk,

583
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,671
and finally arrives
at high school.

584
00:22:29,837 --> 00:22:31,172
- She has no one.
- [bell ringing]

585
00:22:31,173 --> 00:22:33,215
She eats alone,
and only the teachers

586
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,550
- know her name.
- Ew.

587
00:22:34,551 --> 00:22:36,052
Okay, you and I
are gonna be friends.

588
00:22:36,053 --> 00:22:38,512
Oh, this is a sad story.

589
00:22:38,513 --> 00:22:40,472
It's a ridiculous story.

590
00:22:40,473 --> 00:22:43,184
Look, again, love the energy,
but you're being silly.

591
00:22:43,185 --> 00:22:44,811
None of this
will actually happen.

592
00:22:44,977 --> 00:22:46,228
Right. Whatever you say.

593
00:22:46,229 --> 00:22:47,729
- You're the boss. [chuckles]
- [female voice 3] Oh...

594
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:51,525
Remember when we all finally
came up to Headquarters?

595
00:22:51,526 --> 00:22:54,237
That was like 30 seconds ago,
Nostalgia.

596
00:22:54,404 --> 00:22:56,488
Yeah, those were the days.

597
00:22:56,489 --> 00:22:59,116
Nostalgia, you aren't supposed
to be here yet.

598
00:22:59,117 --> 00:23:01,536
You still have about 10 years,
two graduations,

599
00:23:01,703 --> 00:23:03,245
and a best friend's wedding
before you're invited,

600
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:04,914
but I will keep you
in the loop, I promise.

601
00:23:05,082 --> 00:23:06,123
- [Valentina] <i>All right...</i>
- Hey, hey...

602
00:23:06,124 --> 00:23:07,249
<i>- you ready, Riley?</i>
- everybody focus!

603
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,669
Val is leading us
into their holy inner sanctum!

604
00:23:09,836 --> 00:23:11,171
- And here we are!
- [indistinct chatter]

605
00:23:14,091 --> 00:23:16,967
[Envy] <i>These girls are so cool!</i>

606
00:23:16,968 --> 00:23:18,053
[Disgust] <i>And older.</i>

607
00:23:18,178 --> 00:23:19,387
We are not changing
in front of them.

608
00:23:19,554 --> 00:23:20,596
It's fine!

609
00:23:20,597 --> 00:23:22,431
<i>Locker rooms are places
of mutual respect.</i>

610
00:23:22,432 --> 00:23:24,850
Hey, come on! I want you to
meet the other Fire Hawks.

611
00:23:24,851 --> 00:23:25,935
- Hey, girl!
- What's up?

612
00:23:26,311 --> 00:23:27,312
Hey.

613
00:23:27,313 --> 00:23:28,855
Riley is from Michigan.

614
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:30,981
Okay, we're stuck with that.

615
00:23:30,982 --> 00:23:32,941
Oh, Cool. Where in Michigan
are you from?

616
00:23:32,942 --> 00:23:34,776
- Uh...
- Oh, no. What now?

617
00:23:34,777 --> 00:23:36,696
Okay, looks like
we're committing to this.

618
00:23:36,863 --> 00:23:37,989
Cities in Michigan...

619
00:23:38,156 --> 00:23:39,199
We need to make something up.

620
00:23:39,366 --> 00:23:41,576
I'm from all over.

621
00:23:41,743 --> 00:23:43,245
Nice. See you out there.

622
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,703
Hey, you wanna sit with us?

623
00:23:44,704 --> 00:23:46,373
[Anxiety]
<i>Oh, she wants to sit with us.</i>

624
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:48,875
[gasps]
Everything is beautiful!

625
00:23:49,042 --> 00:23:51,044
There's not enough room
for Bree and Grace.

626
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:52,836
Oh! Let's go sit over there.

627
00:23:52,837 --> 00:23:54,714
I was gonna go save seats
for my friends.

628
00:23:54,881 --> 00:23:56,215
But thanks anyway.

629
00:23:56,216 --> 00:23:58,300
Oh. Uh... Yeah. Okay.

630
00:23:58,301 --> 00:23:59,385
No worries.

631
00:23:59,386 --> 00:24:01,179
See? Was that so hard?

632
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:02,347
No. You're totally right.

633
00:24:02,472 --> 00:24:03,764
That decision's
not gonna haunt us

634
00:24:03,765 --> 00:24:05,308
for the rest
of our lives at all.

635
00:24:05,725 --> 00:24:07,935
- [Bree] No way!
- Bree and Grace!

636
00:24:08,103 --> 00:24:09,396
- There you are.
- Riley.

637
00:24:09,562 --> 00:24:12,274
Time to celebrate!

638
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,775
- Say, "awooga"!
- [both] Awooga!

639
00:24:14,776 --> 00:24:17,237
Okay, ladies.
Let's all settle in.

640
00:24:18,821 --> 00:24:20,240
[babbling, chuckling]

641
00:24:20,782 --> 00:24:22,658
- Uh, Joy?
- Wait, wait, wait.

642
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:23,785
- [coach] Ladies!
- [girls gasp]

643
00:24:23,951 --> 00:24:25,995
Settle in means settle down.

644
00:24:26,538 --> 00:24:27,663
I need your focus.

645
00:24:27,664 --> 00:24:29,998
Which means now I'm going
to need your cell phones.

646
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:31,084
All of 'em.

647
00:24:31,376 --> 00:24:33,377
[girl] Wait, what?
Are you serious?

648
00:24:33,378 --> 00:24:37,674
[tuts] You're here
to work, not goof around.

649
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,883
Got that, Andersen?

650
00:24:40,593 --> 00:24:41,635
Yes, Coach.

651
00:24:41,636 --> 00:24:43,929
Please put all your phones
in the basket.

652
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,765
You get them back
at the end of camp.

653
00:24:48,017 --> 00:24:51,146
Wow. Coach is so serious.

654
00:24:51,313 --> 00:24:53,481
Joy, I'm just curious.
Maybe, um, I could help...

655
00:24:53,648 --> 00:24:54,649
Thank you. Not now.

656
00:24:54,816 --> 00:24:55,982
I know, right? [laughs]

657
00:24:55,983 --> 00:24:57,485
[all chuckling]

658
00:24:58,153 --> 00:25:00,071
Oh. [chuckles]
You think this is funny?

659
00:25:00,072 --> 00:25:01,823
Uh-huh. Well, you know
what else is funny?

660
00:25:01,989 --> 00:25:03,033
Skating lines.

661
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,659
- Now hit the ice, ladies.
- [all groaning]

662
00:25:04,951 --> 00:25:06,828
- Great job, Michigan.
- Thanks a lot, new girl.

663
00:25:06,994 --> 00:25:08,205
[girl 1] Just make her do it.

664
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:12,124
[sighs] Bravo, Joy.
She's totally fitting in now.

665
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:14,086
Oh, thanks so much, Wee-Wee.

666
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:15,587
[all panting]

667
00:25:17,964 --> 00:25:19,674
You're lagging behind,
Andersen!

668
00:25:19,841 --> 00:25:21,758
- Skate harder!
- [player] This is the worst.

669
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:22,843
[whistle blows]

670
00:25:22,844 --> 00:25:25,012
All right, ladies,
take a breather.

671
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,973
Then we'll divide into teams.

672
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,726
[breathing heavily]

673
00:25:33,146 --> 00:25:34,521
[Fire Hawk player]
Oh, that Michigan girl

674
00:25:34,522 --> 00:25:36,566
- is off to a rough start.
- [Anxiety] <i>Oh, no.</i>

675
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:37,942
Are they talking about us?

676
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,693
Yeah, there's no way
Coach is putting her

677
00:25:39,694 --> 00:25:41,278
on the team if she can't
get it together.

678
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,489
Uh, okay, Dani,
like you had it all together

679
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,574
when you were a freshman?

680
00:25:44,741 --> 00:25:45,992
I wasn't that immature.

681
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,330
[Sofia] Dani, you stuck straws
up your nose. Like last night.

682
00:25:50,872 --> 00:25:51,873
[Embarrassment groaning]

683
00:25:52,874 --> 00:25:54,041
[grunting]

684
00:25:54,042 --> 00:25:56,253
Aw. I got you, big guy.

685
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,962
- [sobbing]
- [Envy] Oh.

686
00:25:58,963 --> 00:26:02,633
I always wanted people to talk
about us, but not like this.

687
00:26:02,634 --> 00:26:04,677
Oh, Joy, what do we do now?

688
00:26:04,886 --> 00:26:05,887
Um...

689
00:26:05,888 --> 00:26:07,097
We can just, um...

690
00:26:07,264 --> 00:26:08,514
I have an idea.

691
00:26:08,515 --> 00:26:09,598
Okay.

692
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,436
If we can get Val on our side,
everything will be great.

693
00:26:17,482 --> 00:26:18,815
Uh, Val?

694
00:26:18,816 --> 00:26:20,567
Oh, hey, Riley. What's up?

695
00:26:20,568 --> 00:26:21,778
Uh, I-I...

696
00:26:23,613 --> 00:26:24,989
I'm so sorry.

697
00:26:25,157 --> 00:26:27,075
I didn't mean to get
the whole team skating lines.

698
00:26:27,242 --> 00:26:28,285
I feel terrible.

699
00:26:28,451 --> 00:26:29,619
I respect you so much.

700
00:26:29,786 --> 00:26:31,162
I would never do anything
to mess you up.

701
00:26:31,163 --> 00:26:32,622
Uh, that's laying it on
a bit thick, don't you think?

702
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:33,790
- [shushes] Joy.
<i>- You're a great hockey player,</i>

703
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:35,457
and you lead the team
so amazingly,

704
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:36,625
and I really
look up to you and...

705
00:26:36,626 --> 00:26:38,586
Okay, okay. Thanks. [chuckles]

706
00:26:38,753 --> 00:26:41,214
Listen, Coach was pretty hard
on you today,

707
00:26:41,381 --> 00:26:42,840
but that's not a bad thing.

708
00:26:43,007 --> 00:26:44,342
It means you're on her radar.

709
00:26:44,467 --> 00:26:45,468
Really?

710
00:26:45,469 --> 00:26:47,345
Listen, I'm glad you came
to talk with me.

711
00:26:47,512 --> 00:26:49,513
Hey, let's try to be on
the same team later, okay?

712
00:26:49,514 --> 00:26:51,098
Oh, yeah. Cool.

713
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:52,184
- [sighs wearily]
- Wow.

714
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,893
- [Ennui] Good job. Wow.
- I wish I could do that.

715
00:26:54,061 --> 00:26:56,270
You guys, I mean,
it really wasn't anything.

716
00:26:56,271 --> 00:26:57,896
I'm just trying to help.

717
00:26:57,897 --> 00:26:59,357
I agree.

718
00:26:59,524 --> 00:27:01,651
Great job, Anxiety.

719
00:27:01,818 --> 00:27:03,778
I stepped back,
you stepped in,

720
00:27:03,945 --> 00:27:06,656
you got Riley back on track,
now I'm ready to step back in.

721
00:27:06,823 --> 00:27:08,450
But that was just
part one of my plan.

722
00:27:08,616 --> 00:27:09,701
There's a part two?

723
00:27:09,867 --> 00:27:12,329
A good plan
has many parts, Joy.

724
00:27:12,495 --> 00:27:14,246
Okay, ladies,
we're gonna form your teams

725
00:27:14,247 --> 00:27:15,331
for the rest of camp.

726
00:27:15,332 --> 00:27:16,708
Now, split yourselves
down the middle.

727
00:27:16,874 --> 00:27:19,877
Team one on the right,
team two on the left.

728
00:27:20,045 --> 00:27:21,046
Let's do this!

729
00:27:21,047 --> 00:27:22,422
One more time
on the same team, right?

730
00:27:22,589 --> 00:27:23,590
Right.

731
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,883
Val wants us.

732
00:27:26,884 --> 00:27:28,594
But we promised
Bree and Grace.

733
00:27:28,595 --> 00:27:30,472
Joy, we have to
plan for the future.

734
00:27:33,308 --> 00:27:35,017
Come on, Riley, move.
Move those feet!

735
00:27:35,185 --> 00:27:36,353
Val's on team one,
you wanna be on team one.

736
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:37,520
Let's go.

737
00:27:37,521 --> 00:27:39,189
She made a promise
to her friends.

738
00:27:39,356 --> 00:27:41,023
She's not gonna break it.

739
00:27:41,191 --> 00:27:42,525
Oh, you're so right, Joy.

- [grunts]
- [shatters]

741
00:27:44,277 --> 00:27:45,403
- What are you doing?
- [Anger] Hey!

742
00:27:46,571 --> 00:27:48,990
No! You can't have that.
Put that back.

743
00:27:52,077 --> 00:27:53,078
Joy, I don't mean
to overstep...

744
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,161
- No!
- ...but it has to be done.

745
00:27:54,162 --> 00:27:55,747
What are you... No!

746
00:28:04,256 --> 00:28:05,840
[gasps] No...

747
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:08,468
I know change is scary,
but watch.

748
00:28:10,595 --> 00:28:12,597
- I'm so excited.
- [gasps]

749
00:28:14,391 --> 00:28:16,351
All right.
Welcome to our team, Michigan.

750
00:28:23,066 --> 00:28:24,483
That is not Riley.

751
00:28:24,484 --> 00:28:26,068
I know. It's a better Riley.

752
00:28:26,069 --> 00:28:28,446
A Riley who won't be alone
next year.

753
00:28:28,613 --> 00:28:30,365
We build her
a new Sense of Self.

754
00:28:30,698 --> 00:28:32,534
A brand-new her.

755
00:28:33,201 --> 00:28:34,202
No, no, no!

756
00:28:34,203 --> 00:28:35,370
You can't go down there
with that.

757
00:28:35,537 --> 00:28:37,664
Over my dead flaming body!

758
00:28:39,374 --> 00:28:40,875
I am truly sorry.

759
00:28:41,043 --> 00:28:43,211
I was so looking forward
to working with you guys.

760
00:28:43,795 --> 00:28:45,129
Hey, hey! What do you think
you're doing?

761
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,213
Get off me!

762
00:28:46,214 --> 00:28:47,631
Riley's life
is more complex now.

763
00:28:47,632 --> 00:28:50,385
It requires more sophisticated
emotions than all of you.

764
00:28:50,552 --> 00:28:52,928
You just aren't what
she needs anymore, Joy.

765
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:54,012
[gasps]

766
00:28:54,013 --> 00:28:55,639
How dare you, madam!

767
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,516
You can't just bottle us up!

768
00:28:57,517 --> 00:28:59,226
Oh! That's a great idea.

769
00:28:59,227 --> 00:29:01,312

- [Fear] I can't breathe.

770

I can't breathe!

771
00:29:02,397 --> 00:29:03,480
It's not forever.

772
00:29:03,481 --> 00:29:04,648
It's just
until Riley makes varsity,

773
00:29:04,649 --> 00:29:06,733
or until she turns 18,
or maybe forever.

774
00:29:06,734 --> 00:29:07,901
I don't know.
We'll have to see.

775
00:29:07,902 --> 00:29:09,196
- Bye!
- [Joy] Anxiety!

776
00:29:09,362 --> 00:29:10,863
- Riley needs us!
- [all clamoring]

777
00:29:11,823 --> 00:29:12,824
Okay.

778
00:29:12,825 --> 00:29:14,742
Don't worry, Riley.
You're in good hands.

779
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:17,079
Now let's change
everything about you.

[Embarrassment exclaims]

783
00:29:27,173 --> 00:29:29,756
Quick question. How do we
build a new Riley,

784
00:29:29,757 --> 00:29:31,884
which I'm loving, by the way,
amazing concept,

785
00:29:32,052 --> 00:29:35,429
if it took them 13 years
to build the old one?

786
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,557
Well, good news is we're not
starting from scratch.

787
00:29:38,766 --> 00:29:39,933
I wanna plant one.

788
00:29:39,934 --> 00:29:41,227
- Next time.

Where are you putting us?

The same place we keep
all of Riley's secrets.

803
00:30:27,023 --> 00:30:28,065
We're not secrets.

Denial.

Yeah, I always thought Riley

00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:53,420
Then you must make your curse
your gift.

875
00:32:54,712 --> 00:32:56,506
Shield yourself, my friends,

876
00:32:56,673 --> 00:32:59,092
for I shall set you all free!

877
00:32:59,926 --> 00:33:01,344
[Lance grunting]

878
00:33:03,971 --> 00:33:04,972
Hey, little help?

879
00:33:04,973 --> 00:33:06,558
[growls]

880
00:33:07,267 --> 00:33:08,559
[glass shatters]

881
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,935
Great job, Dark Secret.

882
00:33:09,936 --> 00:33:11,019
[grunts]

883
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,980
Now it's your turn to help us.

884
00:33:13,148 --> 00:33:15,733
My pouch has just the thing
to get us out of here.

885
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,571
Everybody say, "Oh, Pouchy!"

886
00:33:20,363 --> 00:33:22,614
[all] Oh, Pouchy!

887
00:33:22,615 --> 00:33:24,076
[♪ amusing music plays]

888
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,536
Hi, everybody. I'm Pouchy.

889
00:33:27,537 --> 00:33:29,247
Pouchy, we need to escape.

890
00:33:29,414 --> 00:33:31,083
Do you have anything
that can help us?

891
00:33:31,249 --> 00:33:32,709
I have lots of items.

892
00:33:33,085 --> 00:33:35,128
Which one do you think
will work the best?

893
00:33:35,295 --> 00:33:36,504
A tomato,

894
00:33:36,671 --> 00:33:37,839
a frog,

895
00:33:38,005 --> 00:33:40,050
or exploding dynamite?

896
00:33:40,217 --> 00:33:41,634
Oh, for crying out loud.

897
00:33:42,094 --> 00:33:43,095
[explosion]

898
00:33:43,886 --> 00:33:45,972
Yay! We did it, everyone!

899
00:33:46,139 --> 00:33:47,223
Let's all sing

900
00:33:47,224 --> 00:33:48,725
the "We did it" song.
[inhales deeply]

901
00:33:48,891 --> 00:33:50,017
[all] No time!

902
00:33:50,518 --> 00:33:52,728
Thank you, friends. I must...
[grunts]

903
00:33:52,729 --> 00:33:55,022
I must be leaving you.

904
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:57,484
What about Dark Secret?

905
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,778
Not yet.

906
00:34:01,988 --> 00:34:03,823
Yeah, that's probably best
for everybody.

907
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:06,159
[Dave] Hey! Who let you out?
Get back in there!

908
00:34:06,326 --> 00:34:07,785
- Oh, boy.
- What are we gonna do?

909
00:34:07,952 --> 00:34:08,995
Oh, disgusted one,

910
00:34:09,704 --> 00:34:13,915
as you once believed in me,
I will now believe in myself.

911
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:15,001
[sword clatters]

912
00:34:15,752 --> 00:34:16,753
[guards gasp]

913
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,296
Huh?

914
00:34:19,297 --> 00:34:20,798
- Wait. What?
- [all laughing]

915
00:34:23,843 --> 00:34:25,177
- [groans]
- Ooh!

916
00:34:25,178 --> 00:34:26,638
[screams, grunts]

917
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:29,099
[groans, grunts]

918
00:34:29,682 --> 00:34:32,601
Whoa! What's happening? Whoa!

919
00:34:32,602 --> 00:34:33,686
- [Sadness gasps]
- [Anger laughing]

920
00:34:33,895 --> 00:34:34,979
[groaning]

921
00:34:36,022 --> 00:34:37,023
No...

922
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,191
Dave, help! Help!

923
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:39,359
Hold on!

924
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:40,860
[cop] Dave!

925
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,072
Lance!

926
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,240
[Lance] Goodbye, friends.

927
00:34:45,407 --> 00:34:47,034
Hello, destiny!

928
00:34:47,784 --> 00:34:49,119
Well, there's a lid
for every pot.

929
00:34:49,286 --> 00:34:50,287
Come on!

930
00:34:52,164 --> 00:34:53,456
[Fear] What do we do?
What do we do?

931
00:34:53,623 --> 00:34:55,417
Whoa, Anger, stop.
Where are you going?

932
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:58,170
Um, back to Headquarters,
to help Riley!

933
00:34:58,336 --> 00:34:59,671
Riley's not up there.

934
00:34:59,837 --> 00:35:01,298
She's out there.

935
00:35:01,464 --> 00:35:04,176
We can't go back
without her Sense of Self.

936
00:35:04,342 --> 00:35:07,512
You want us to go all the way
to the Back of the Mind?

937
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:09,597
Are you out of your mind?

938
00:35:09,764 --> 00:35:11,015
But, Joy, how will we...

939
00:35:11,183 --> 00:35:12,184
- [male cop] Freeze!
- Come on!

940
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,351
[male cop] Hold it right there!

941
00:35:13,352 --> 00:35:14,436
[siren wailing]

942
00:35:14,936 --> 00:35:18,022
[scoffs] How do we get there?
Do you even have a plan, Joy?

943
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,733
I bet Anxiety would have
a really good plan...

944
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,694
Of course I have a plan.
Who doesn't have a plan?

945
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,155
Look, she's not the only one
who can project the future.

946
00:35:25,322 --> 00:35:28,366
First, all we have to do is,
uh...

947
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,701
<i>Give me a second.</i>

948
00:35:30,243 --> 00:35:32,704
<i>Ooh! Follow the stream
of consciousness,</i>

949
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,455
<i>and then we take
a nice, easy float</i>

950
00:35:34,456 --> 00:35:35,747
<i>all the way
to the Back of the Mind.</i>

951
00:35:35,748 --> 00:35:37,083
[Fear] <i>Where all
the bad memories are.</i>

952
00:35:37,084 --> 00:35:38,167
[Joy] <i>Exactly. And there,</i>

953
00:35:38,168 --> 00:35:40,628
<i>we'll find the Riley
we know and love.</i>

954
00:35:41,213 --> 00:35:42,838
<i>We'll put her
Sense of Self back,</i>

955
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:44,840
<i>and then Riley
will be Riley again.</i>

956
00:35:44,841 --> 00:35:45,924
[Fear] <i>Okay,
I'm gonna give it to you.</i>

957
00:35:45,925 --> 00:35:47,176
<i>That could actually work.</i>

958
00:35:47,177 --> 00:35:48,344
[Joy] <i>Yeah, it could!</i>

959
00:35:48,345 --> 00:35:52,557
<i>And then I tell Anxiety, "Hey,
don't worry so much anymore."</i>

960
00:35:52,724 --> 00:35:54,933
<i>And she'll say,
"Wow, Joy, I never thought</i>

961
00:35:54,934 --> 00:35:56,435
<i>"of that before. Thank you."</i>

962
00:35:56,436 --> 00:35:57,812
<i>And then we hug
and become best friends...</i>

963
00:35:57,979 --> 00:35:59,731
[Anger] <i>And then I punt her
into the dump.</i>

964
00:36:00,565 --> 00:36:01,648
- [Anxiety screaming]
- What? No, Anger.

965
00:36:01,649 --> 00:36:03,651
Okay, fine. No punting.

966
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,072
Don't worry, I know
right where the stream is.

967
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:09,656
Sadness and I
have been here before. Oh.

968
00:36:09,657 --> 00:36:11,701
[Disgust]
Joy, this is a dead end.

969
00:36:11,868 --> 00:36:14,162
Those are the worst kinds
of ends!

970
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:17,789
Everything's changing so fast!
[crying]

971
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,125
So, we're lost.

972
00:36:19,126 --> 00:36:21,627
No. You're never lost
if you're having fun.

973
00:36:21,628 --> 00:36:22,961
No one is having fun, Joy.

974
00:36:22,962 --> 00:36:24,755
Oh, come on! Look at Sadness.

975
00:36:24,756 --> 00:36:26,215
She's having a great time.

976
00:36:26,216 --> 00:36:27,716
[crying]

977
00:36:27,717 --> 00:36:29,302
I thought you knew
where you were going.

978
00:36:29,469 --> 00:36:30,470
I do. I did.

979
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:32,097
- I just need a moment.
- She doesn't know.

980
00:36:32,264 --> 00:36:33,556
We're stuck here!

981
00:36:34,516 --> 00:36:36,309
Oh, Riley's awake.

982
00:36:36,476 --> 00:36:38,728
Wait, she's up too early.
What are they doing to her?

983
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,772
Come on,
we'll find another way.

984
00:36:42,315 --> 00:36:44,442
Don't worry, Riley.
We're coming.

985
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:47,944
[memories clinking]

986
00:36:47,945 --> 00:36:49,197
[breathing heavily]

987
00:36:50,365 --> 00:36:51,448
[Ennui sighs]

988
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:53,660
Why are we up so early?

989
00:36:53,826 --> 00:36:56,079
Because, <i>mon ami,</i>
we need to speed things up,

990
00:36:56,246 --> 00:36:57,580
and that means
we hit the ice early,

991
00:36:57,747 --> 00:37:00,375
<i>and practice like
we've never practiced before.</i>

992
00:37:00,542 --> 00:37:02,085
[Ennui] <i>Aren't we already good
at hockey?</i>

993
00:37:02,252 --> 00:37:03,253
[Envy] <i>We're good.</i>

994
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,797
- But the Fire Hawks are great.
- That's right!

995
00:37:07,215 --> 00:37:08,966
[grunts, groans]

996
00:37:09,551 --> 00:37:10,552
[Anxiety]
<i>Every time we miss,</i>

997
00:37:10,553 --> 00:37:11,885
<i>we skate a lap
around the rink.</i>

998
00:37:11,886 --> 00:37:13,929
Hockey is not a game,
it is a sport.

999
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,682
[Riley grunts]

1000
00:37:23,648 --> 00:37:25,274
[grunts]

1001
00:37:25,275 --> 00:37:26,818
- Yes!
- [Envy] <i>Wow.</i>

1002
00:37:27,152 --> 00:37:28,402
That was amazing.

1003
00:37:28,403 --> 00:37:30,487
We need to be that good
every time.

1004
00:37:30,488 --> 00:37:31,655
Let's run it again.

1005
00:37:31,656 --> 00:37:33,824
Hey, I see I'm not the only
one who likes to start early.

1006
00:37:33,825 --> 00:37:34,909
[Anxiety] <i>You guys, it's Val!</i>

1007
00:37:35,118 --> 00:37:36,368
We had the same idea.

1008
00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:37,828
We're basically
the same person.

1009
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:39,164
We're gonna be best friends.

1010
00:37:39,331 --> 00:37:40,707
How long have you been here?

1011
00:37:40,873 --> 00:37:42,667
I don't know. Maybe an hour.

1012
00:37:42,834 --> 00:37:45,087
I just wanted to get in
some extra ice time.

1013
00:37:45,253 --> 00:37:46,378
I'm the same way.

1014
00:37:46,379 --> 00:37:48,130
[Anxiety]
<i>Oh, my gosh. She gets us.</i>

1015
00:37:48,131 --> 00:37:50,382
See? I told the other girls
you'd figure it out.

1016
00:37:50,383 --> 00:37:52,552
You get what it takes
to be the best.

1017
00:37:54,929 --> 00:37:56,013
Look at us.

1018
00:37:56,181 --> 00:37:57,931
This is going great!

1019
00:37:57,932 --> 00:38:00,476
Yeah! But we need Val
to really like us.

1020
00:38:00,477 --> 00:38:02,645
Oh, we should ask Val
lots of questions.

1021
00:38:02,812 --> 00:38:04,522
People love
talking about themselves.

1022
00:38:04,689 --> 00:38:07,692
So, what was your freshman
year on the Fire Hawks like?

1023
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:10,445
I mean,
it was a lot of work,

1024
00:38:10,612 --> 00:38:12,072
like, a lot... [chuckles]

1025
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:14,365
but it's also
how I met my best friends.

1026
00:38:14,366 --> 00:38:16,492
Val is sharing things with us!

1027
00:38:16,493 --> 00:38:18,703
Hey, a few of us are just
gonna hang out tonight,

1028
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,829
order some food.
You should come.

1029
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:23,207
Oh! An exclusive invitation.
[chuckles]

1030
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:24,292
We're going!

1031
00:38:24,751 --> 00:38:25,918
- Really?
- Definitely.

1032
00:38:26,086 --> 00:38:27,087
It'll be fun.

1033
00:38:27,088 --> 00:38:28,963
[coach] All right, ladies,
let's warm up.

1034
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,591
Hey, Riley.

1035
00:38:31,592 --> 00:38:32,674
Hi.

1036
00:38:32,675 --> 00:38:34,886
We are not sharing Val
with them.

1037
00:38:35,053 --> 00:38:36,804
[grunts] Early mornings
make me so hungry.

1038
00:38:36,971 --> 00:38:38,056
I know, right?

1039
00:38:38,348 --> 00:38:40,599
I'd give anything for a piece
of pizza right now.

1040
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,684
Yes!

1041
00:38:41,851 --> 00:38:43,603
See? I told you I'd find it.

1042
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,147
The Stream of Consciousness.

1043
00:38:45,313 --> 00:38:47,899
- [Sadness] But, Joy...
- Wow! Our girl is hungry.

1044
00:38:48,108 --> 00:38:49,234
Hop on something delicious!

1045
00:38:49,401 --> 00:38:50,734
- Joy...
- Ooh, deep dish.

1046
00:38:50,735 --> 00:38:52,487
[chuckles]
And it's still warm.

Sadness, come on.

1049
00:38:55,157 --> 00:38:56,616
But I've been trying
to tell you.

1050
00:38:56,783 --> 00:38:58,826
We can't take the tube back,
Joy.

1051
00:38:59,161 --> 00:39:01,704
Someone has to be
at the console to recall us.

1052
00:39:01,871 --> 00:39:03,831
She's right. We'd be stranded.

1053
00:39:03,998 --> 00:39:05,333
Yeah. Anxiety would have
thought about that.

1054
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,793
Well, I doubt it. Fine.

1055
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:08,378
Okay. Uh...

1056
00:39:08,711 --> 00:39:11,464
So, someone's gonna have to
crawl up that tube,

1057
00:39:11,631 --> 00:39:12,882
and go back to Headquarters,

1058
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,758
and at the right moment,
bring us back.

1059
00:39:14,759 --> 00:39:16,428
Oh, I'll do it.
I'll pound that...

1060
00:39:16,594 --> 00:39:17,678
I don't think so, punty.

1061
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:19,513
- Okay, here's the thing.
- You were never an option.

1062
00:39:19,514 --> 00:39:20,597
Thank you.

1063
00:39:20,598 --> 00:39:22,850
You want me to crawl through
a tube in this?

1064
00:39:23,017 --> 00:39:24,311
Yeah, not happening.

1065
00:39:27,105 --> 00:39:29,941
[gasps] Oh, no, not me.

1066
00:39:30,108 --> 00:39:31,818
Yes! Sadness, you could do it.

1067
00:39:31,984 --> 00:39:34,112
You know the console
better than anybody.

1068
00:39:34,279 --> 00:39:36,156
You've read the manuals
cover to cover.

1069
00:39:36,323 --> 00:39:37,781
I mean, you say that,

1070
00:39:37,782 --> 00:39:41,285
but I know a lot less about
Manual 28, Chapter Seven,

1071

"How to Recall
Non-Memory Objects"

1072
00:39:43,038 --> 00:39:44,830
than most folks realize.

1073
00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:46,498
You've proven my point
for me, Sadness.

1074
00:39:46,499 --> 00:39:47,708
That sounds like a yes.

You are strong.

1087

Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

1108

It's got
a very interesting texture.

00:44:29,782 --> 00:44:30,866
[Anxiety] Something better,
something cool. Come on.

1216
00:44:30,867 --> 00:44:33,120
No, not that. No.

1217
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:34,745
This is the best we have!

1218
00:44:34,746 --> 00:44:37,456
It's mostly jingles
and Dad's yacht rock.

1219
00:44:37,457 --> 00:44:39,500
But, I mean,
you don't still like

1220
00:44:39,501 --> 00:44:41,128
Get Up and Glow, do you?

1221
00:44:41,544 --> 00:44:43,295
Okay, don't panic.
What do we do?

1222
00:44:43,296 --> 00:44:44,505
If we don't like their music,

1223
00:44:44,506 --> 00:44:45,631
we have nothing

1224
00:44:45,632 --> 00:44:46,757
- to offer these girls.
- [Ennui groans]

1225
00:44:46,758 --> 00:44:47,841
We'll be outed as the imposter

1226
00:44:47,842 --> 00:44:49,135
- that we obviously are.
<i>- Pardon. Excusez moi.</i>

1227
00:44:49,136 --> 00:44:52,138
I've been waiting my whole
life for this very moment.

1228
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:53,223
[console buzzes]

1229
00:44:53,556 --> 00:44:56,768
[sarcastically] Oh, yeah.
I love Get Up and Glow.

1230
00:44:56,934 --> 00:44:59,271

[Disgust screams]

[Joy screams]

1236
00:45:12,284 --> 00:45:13,618
[Joy breathing heavily]

1237
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:17,497
- [Disgust] Joy!
- Give us your hand! Come on.

1238
00:45:17,747 --> 00:45:18,748
[both grunting]

1239
00:45:19,332 --> 00:45:20,833
What is that?

1240
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,377
That's a Sar-chasm.

1241
00:45:22,544 --> 00:45:23,961
It can open for miles!

1242
00:45:24,129 --> 00:45:25,505
Run for your lives!

1243
00:45:25,672 --> 00:45:27,799
Sar-chasm? Really?

1244
00:45:27,965 --> 00:45:29,216
[Riley sarcastically]

1245
00:45:29,217 --> 00:45:30,551

1246
00:45:30,552 --> 00:45:32,469
But she loves Get Up and Glow.

1247
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:34,056
They choreograph
their own dances.

1248
00:45:34,222 --> 00:45:35,306
Okay, Joy,

1249
00:45:35,307 --> 00:45:36,473
if we can't follow the stream,

1250
00:45:36,474 --> 00:45:37,558
we don't know
where we're going.

1251
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:38,934
And if we don't know
where we're going,

1252
00:45:38,935 --> 00:45:40,437
we can't follow the stream!

1253
00:45:40,603 --> 00:45:44,566
It is an endless loop
of tragedy and consequence!

1254
00:45:44,732 --> 00:45:46,318
Or we could just
ask those guys.

1255
00:45:46,484 --> 00:45:47,860
Oh, yeah. Or that.

1256
00:45:48,027 --> 00:45:50,987
Boy, are we so lucky
we ran into you guys!

1257
00:45:50,988 --> 00:45:54,200
[echoing in sarcastic voice]
Boy, are we so lucky

1258
00:45:54,201 --> 00:45:57,703
- we ran into you guys!
- Huh?

1259
00:45:57,704 --> 00:46:00,790
Please,
we really need your help!

1260
00:46:00,957 --> 00:46:03,626
[echoing in sarcastic voice]
We really need your help.

1261

What's their problem?

1262
00:46:05,337 --> 00:46:07,254
Guys, you just gotta
turn on the charm.

Wow, those guys are jerks.

- [crane beeping]

1268

[sarcastically] Oh, yeah.
Get Up and Glow is so awesome.

1269

Riley, what are you
talking about?

1270
00:46:24,814 --> 00:46:27,066

always trying to
hang out with us?

Come on, Riley,
we just went to their concert.

1275
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:35,700
Well, yeah.

1276
00:46:35,701 --> 00:46:37,409
- I mean, sure, but like...
- But what?

1277
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:38,495
We had a great time.

[worker clamoring]

1283
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:48,921
Why can't they just
leave her alone?

1284
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:50,631
What are we gonna do now, Joy?

1285
00:46:50,632 --> 00:46:53,009
We go the long way,
which is the best way.

1286
00:46:53,176 --> 00:46:55,512
Stretch those hammies, Anger.
Let's go.

1287
00:46:56,263 --> 00:46:58,265
Best night of my life.

1288
00:46:58,431 --> 00:47:00,349
Well,
this has been really fun.

1289
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,642
Extremely.

1290
00:47:01,643 --> 00:47:02,768
But we're gonna go now.

1291
00:47:02,769 --> 00:47:04,354
Okay, bye.

- [♪ upbeat pop music playing]
- Oh, this is

1293

- Okay, Riley!
- Michigan knows what's up!

1295
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:12,278
See? As long as
we like what they like,

1296
00:47:12,279 --> 00:47:13,737
we have all the friends
we need.

1297
00:47:13,738 --> 00:47:14,906
- [Riley laughing]
- [Sofia] Night, guys.

1298
00:47:15,073 --> 00:47:17,033
Well, I think
I'm calling it a night.

1299
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:19,201
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, it's late.

1300
00:47:19,202 --> 00:47:20,327
Plus, I think
you'll want to get some sleep

1301
00:47:20,328 --> 00:47:21,412
before tomorrow's scrimmage.

1302
00:47:21,413 --> 00:47:22,496
What scrimmage?

1303
00:47:22,497 --> 00:47:25,167
Uh. It's just something Coach
always does on the last day.

1304
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:26,959
It's how Val made the team
as a freshman.

1305
00:47:27,127 --> 00:47:28,128
Don't tell her that.

1306
00:47:28,295 --> 00:47:29,836
Val scored two goals.

1307
00:47:29,837 --> 00:47:31,422
No freshman
has ever done that.

1308
00:47:31,423 --> 00:47:32,507
Dani, stop.

1309
00:47:32,674 --> 00:47:34,842
Technically, it's not your
tryout for the next year,

1310
00:47:35,009 --> 00:47:36,469
but it basically is.

1311
00:47:37,262 --> 00:47:39,263
You'll do great.
Just be yourself.

[Anxiety] <i>Did you hear that?</i>

1313
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,600
We could become a Fire Hawk,
like, tomorrow.

1314
00:47:42,767 --> 00:47:45,852
But how do we be ourself if
our new self isn't ready yet?

1315
00:47:45,853 --> 00:47:47,355
[grunts] Excellent point.

1316
00:47:47,522 --> 00:47:49,398

these memories downstairs.

00:48:03,163 --> 00:48:05,373
We're getting
deeper and deeper in, Joy.

1322
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:06,541
Great observation.

1323
00:48:06,708 --> 00:48:07,874
The long way did turn out

1324
00:48:07,875 --> 00:48:08,959
to be a little longer
than I thought.

1325
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,669
Anyway,
who wants to sing a song?

1326
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:12,838
Oh, I know a song.
It's called, "I give up."

1327
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:14,632
Or let's play the quiet game!

1328
00:48:14,799 --> 00:48:16,426
One, two, three, hush.

1329
00:48:16,801 --> 00:48:18,009
[Anger] I'll tell you
what we do,

1330
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:19,553
we go back up there
and we kick those...

1331
00:48:19,554 --> 00:48:20,972
[Joy] Anger,
now is not the time.

1332
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:22,431
[Disgust] Joy, this is useless.

1333
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:24,058
Real Riley is out there
somewhere,

1334
00:48:24,059 --> 00:48:25,142
and we're never
going to find her.

1335
00:48:25,143 --> 00:48:26,310
[worker] You know what?
Yeah, these can go.

1336
00:48:26,311 --> 00:48:27,436
- Forget 'em!
- No, no, no, I can find her.

1337
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:29,147
I just need to get
a better view.

1338
00:48:31,566 --> 00:48:32,567

[machine whirring]

1340
00:48:44,037 --> 00:48:46,123
Okay, well, this isn't
working, and that's fine.

1341
00:48:46,289 --> 00:48:47,665
- Everything's fine.
- This is hopeless.

1342
00:48:47,832 --> 00:48:49,834
I say we cut our losses
and walk back.

1343
00:48:50,001 --> 00:48:51,710
This whole trip
is just a series

1344
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:53,213
of deader and deader ends.

1345
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,382
Ever since that
puberty alarm went off

1346
00:48:55,548 --> 00:48:58,093
nothing around here works
the way it's supposed to!

1347
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,262
I don't even recognize
this place anymore.

1348
00:49:00,428 --> 00:49:02,514
It's light out at 1:00
in the morning!

1349
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,142
I have never been inside
so many jars in my life.

1350
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:08,061
And the Riley we knew is gone!

1351
00:49:08,228 --> 00:49:12,357
And if Joy can't see that,
well, then, she's delusional!

1352
00:49:15,527 --> 00:49:16,819
Delusional?

1353
00:49:16,986 --> 00:49:19,239
Of course I'm delusional!

1354
00:49:19,406 --> 00:49:21,990
Do you know how hard it is to
stay positive all the time,

1355
00:49:21,991 --> 00:49:25,578
when all you folks do is
complain, complain, complain?

1356
00:49:25,745 --> 00:49:27,538
Jiminy mother-loving
toaster strudel!

1357
00:49:27,539 --> 00:49:28,622
[all gasp]

1358
00:49:28,623 --> 00:49:30,417
Do you think
I have all the answers?

1359
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:32,127
Of course I don't!

1360
00:49:33,045 --> 00:49:34,711
[sighs]

1361
00:49:34,712 --> 00:49:37,757
We can't even find
the back of our own mind.

1362
00:49:41,719 --> 00:49:43,221
Anxiety is right!

1363
00:49:43,846 --> 00:49:47,475
Riley doesn't need us as much
as she needs them.

1364
00:49:49,977 --> 00:49:51,729
And that hurts.

1365
00:49:52,605 --> 00:49:53,856
It really hurts.

1366
00:49:58,903 --> 00:50:00,862
Joy, you've made
a lot of mistakes.

1367
00:50:00,863 --> 00:50:02,115
A lot.

1368
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:05,410
And you'll make a whole lot
more in the future.

1369
00:50:06,453 --> 00:50:07,953
But if you let that stop you,

1370
00:50:07,954 --> 00:50:10,582
we might as well lie down
and give up now.

1371
00:50:10,748 --> 00:50:12,374
Well, actually,
that does sound kinda nice.

1372
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:13,460
Ow!

1373
00:50:14,127 --> 00:50:15,253
Come on.

1374
00:50:22,094 --> 00:50:23,720
- [Anger] Excuse us.
- Hey! You can't use that.

1375
00:50:23,886 --> 00:50:25,972
- Riley emergency.
- [Fear] Thank you!

1376
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:27,640
Hop on!

1377
00:50:30,768 --> 00:50:31,769
[chuckles]

[all grunt]

1381
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:43,740
Let's just forget
that ever happened.

1382
00:50:43,906 --> 00:50:45,200
You don't have to
ask me twice.

1383
00:50:46,118 --> 00:50:47,119
- [Joy sighs]
- [Disgust groans]

1384

[gasps] Look.

1386
00:50:52,124 --> 00:50:53,375
[Fear gasps]

1387
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:56,294
We're right behind you.

1388
00:51:04,136 --> 00:51:05,137
[sighs]

1389
00:51:05,553 --> 00:51:06,846
- Whoa!
- This is great.

1390
00:51:07,013 --> 00:51:08,473
The Fire Hawks
have accepted us.

1391
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,099
But if Coach doesn't put us
on the team,

1392
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,267
none of that matters.

1393
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:12,934
Tomorrow is everything.

1394
00:51:12,935 --> 00:51:14,979
Which is why
we're gonna need more help.

1395
00:51:15,147 --> 00:51:16,314
Ennui,
are you paying attention?

1396
00:51:16,481 --> 00:51:18,274
- No.
- Ugh. Embarrassment?

1397
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:19,358
[Grace] <i>Well,
this has been really fun.</i>

1398
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:20,484
[Anxiety distantly]
Embarrassment?

1399
00:51:20,485 --> 00:51:21,652
- [Bree] <i>Extremely.</i>
- [Anxiety] Never mind.

1400
00:51:21,653 --> 00:51:24,072
- [Grace] <i>But we're gonna go.</i>
- [Riley] <i>Okay, bye.</i>

1401
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:25,240
[book thuds]

1402
00:51:32,872 --> 00:51:33,873
Ah!

1403
00:51:34,957 --> 00:51:36,042
- [gasps]
- [Anxiety] Now, let's see.

1404
00:51:36,043 --> 00:51:37,835
What am I looking for?

1405
00:51:38,378 --> 00:51:39,671
Don't you just hate it
when you go to do something,

1406
00:51:39,837 --> 00:51:40,879
and then
you get there to do it,

1407
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,963
and you forget
what you were gonna do?

1408
00:51:41,964 --> 00:51:43,716
[Envy] We'll need all the help
we can get.

1409
00:51:43,883 --> 00:51:45,177
[Anxiety] That is exactly
what I was thinking.

1410
00:51:46,053 --> 00:51:47,054
[whimpers]

1411
00:51:52,434 --> 00:51:53,435
Oh...

1412
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:58,815
[Anxiety] Most important game
of our lives.

1413
00:52:04,237 --> 00:52:05,238
[Embarrassment whimpers]

1414
00:52:09,576 --> 00:52:11,827
All right, guys,
it's gonna be a long night.

1415
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:14,246
- [cans popping open]
- [gulps, sighs]

1416
00:52:14,247 --> 00:52:16,041
So let's get the team ready.

1417
00:52:17,709 --> 00:52:19,752
[Joy] Come on. We just need to
cut through...

1418
00:52:19,877 --> 00:52:22,171
[gasps] Imagination Land!

1419
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:23,798
Oh, you guys
are gonna love it.

1420
00:52:23,965 --> 00:52:27,009
There's French Fry forest
and Cloud Town and...

1421
00:52:28,136 --> 00:52:29,137
Whoa!

1422
00:52:29,138 --> 00:52:31,098
This place has changed.

1423
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:34,642
{\an8}Mount Crushmore?

1424
00:52:34,809 --> 00:52:36,268
- Those are her top four?
- [Disgust sighs]

1425
00:52:36,269 --> 00:52:38,605
The only one that matters
is Lance.

1426
00:52:38,771 --> 00:52:40,357
Well, at least
they got his good side.

1427
00:52:40,523 --> 00:52:43,024
- Every side is his good side.
- [posters rustling]

1428
00:52:43,025 --> 00:52:44,736
<i>- The Rumor Mill?</i>
- Ooh.

1429
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:46,320
{\an8}Where all of our good gossip
comes from.

1430
00:52:46,321 --> 00:52:47,405
[Vendor] Extra, extra!

1431
00:52:47,572 --> 00:52:49,656
Pipin' hot rumors
right off the mill!

1432
00:52:49,657 --> 00:52:51,868
"The teacher's lounge
has a hot tub"?

1433
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:54,579
"Lucy from math class
is legit psychic"?

1434
00:52:54,746 --> 00:52:56,163
"Abbie R's been
texting Mike T,

1435
00:52:56,164 --> 00:52:58,500
"but Mike T's been obsessing
over Sarah M"? [gasps]

1436
00:52:58,666 --> 00:53:00,209
Where's the journalistic
integrity?

1437
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,045
Oh!
Fort Pillowton's still here!

1438
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:03,671
And it even got bigger.

1439
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:05,382
Hmm.

1440
00:53:05,548 --> 00:53:07,467
And orange?

1441
00:53:11,346 --> 00:53:13,347
[Anxiety] <i>All right, 22, Riley
breaks her leg in practice,</i>

1442
00:53:13,348 --> 00:53:14,431

00:53:14,432 --> 00:53:15,641
<i>Nice job.</i>

1444
00:53:15,642 --> 00:53:17,226
<i>Now, 18.

1445
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:18,520

1446
00:53:18,686 --> 00:53:21,398
<i>Great! We need to help
Riley prepare.</i>

1447
00:53:21,564 --> 00:53:22,689
<i>Now's the time to send up</i>

1448
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:24,859

00:53:25,026 --> 00:53:26,944

00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:29,280
<i>Every possible mistake

[workers chattering]

1452
00:53:30,365 --> 00:53:33,826
<i>Come on, 17. I'm not seeing
anything from you.</i>

1453
00:53:37,205 --> 00:53:38,247
[Anxiety]
<i>Riley misses an open goal,</i>

1454
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:39,331
<i>Coach writes about it
in her notebook.</i>

1455
00:53:39,332 --> 00:53:40,416
<i>Yes!</i>

1456
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:41,793
<i>More like that.</i>

1457
00:53:42,044 --> 00:53:43,045
[Disgust] Oh, no!

1458
00:53:43,046 --> 00:53:45,171
They're using Riley's
imagination against her.

1459
00:53:45,172 --> 00:53:46,713
<i>Val and her friends
like us now,</i>

1460
00:53:46,714 --> 00:53:47,798
<i>but if we
don't make the team,</i>

1461
00:53:47,799 --> 00:53:49,258
<i>will they like us tomorrow?</i>

1462
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:50,427
[sighs]

1463
00:53:52,554 --> 00:53:54,221
Okay,
let's go to number three.

1464
00:53:54,222 --> 00:53:55,472
- [both cheering]
- Bree and Grace's team win,

1465
00:53:55,473 --> 00:53:57,349
- and we look stupid.
- [groans]

1466
00:53:57,350 --> 00:54:00,353
Number 22. Val passes to us,
and we miss it. [gasps]

1467
00:54:01,813 --> 00:54:03,315
We can't let her
do this to Riley.

1468
00:54:03,481 --> 00:54:05,150
We have to shut this down.

1469
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:07,693
- [worker groans]
- [Anxiety] <i>Love it, 37.</i>

1470
00:54:07,694 --> 00:54:10,155
<i>Riley hits the puck
into her own net.</i>

1471
00:54:11,198 --> 00:54:13,200
- Why are you drawing a hippo?
- I'm not.

1472
00:54:13,658 --> 00:54:14,784
I... [stammers] I'm drawing Riley!

1473
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:16,327
Joy, you forgot her ponytail.

1474
00:54:16,328 --> 00:54:17,912
Oh, I love her pony tail. Yes!

1475
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:20,747
Riley scores
and everyone hugs her?

1476
00:54:20,748 --> 00:54:22,375
81, that is not helping.

1477
00:54:22,542 --> 00:54:24,252
Riley paints her nails
to match her jersey.

1478
00:54:24,419 --> 00:54:26,879
Everybody copies her.
And she is so cool.

1479
00:54:27,047 --> 00:54:29,132
Riley wears knee pads.

1480
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:31,801
We buy flowers
for the losing team!

1481
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:35,137
What? I can't always be
the rage guy.

1482
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:36,598
No, no. I liked it.

1483
00:54:36,764 --> 00:54:38,182
Nail polish? Knee pads?

1484
00:54:38,183 --> 00:54:39,475
I'm starting to think you guys

1485
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:41,352
don't understand
the assignment.

1486
00:54:41,353 --> 00:54:42,603
- [can clatters]
- What...

1487
00:54:42,604 --> 00:54:44,147
[muffled cheering]

1488
00:54:44,647 --> 00:54:45,815
[sighs in relief]

1489
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:48,651
What? Who sent that
projection to Riley?

1490
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:50,319
- Why would I know that?
- Don't look at me.

1491
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,403
[groans]

1492
00:54:51,404 --> 00:54:52,780
- [keys clacking]
- [console beeping]

1493
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:54,324
What is going on?

1494
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,451
Who is sending
all this positive...

1495
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,454
<i>Joy.</i>

1496
00:54:59,621 --> 00:55:01,414
<i>- I know you're in there.</i>
- [workers gasping]

1497
00:55:01,581 --> 00:55:02,999
- [worker 1] Is that really her?
- [worker 2] Is she really here?

1498
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:04,501
[worker 3]
Joy from Headquarters?

1499
00:55:04,667 --> 00:55:06,127
The mind police
are on their way.

1500
00:55:06,128 --> 00:55:07,212
[shuts down]

1501
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:08,838
Well, I think we gave it
our best shot.

1502
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:10,840
Don't listen to Anxiety.

1503
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:14,385
She's using these horrible
projections to change Riley.

1504
00:55:14,386 --> 00:55:16,346
<i>Joy, I'm doing this for you!</i>

1505
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:18,515
This is all
so Riley can be happier.

1506
00:55:18,681 --> 00:55:22,602
If you wanted her to be happy,
then you'd stop hurting her.

1507
00:55:22,977 --> 00:55:23,978
Who's with me?

1508
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:26,689
- [worker 4] Uh-uh.
- [workers whimpering]

1509
00:55:27,149 --> 00:55:28,900
Really? Nothing?

1510
00:55:29,067 --> 00:55:30,567
[Anxiety] <i>Sorry, Joy.</i>

1511
00:55:30,568 --> 00:55:33,487
- [screen chimes]
- Yeah! I see you, 87.

1512
00:55:33,488 --> 00:55:34,572
A cat.

1513
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:36,658
A little off-topic,
but I'll take it.

1514
00:55:36,824 --> 00:55:38,450
Who else? Come on!

1515
00:55:38,451 --> 00:55:39,785
<i>What if Riley
is better than Val</i>

1516
00:55:39,786 --> 00:55:41,037
<i>and then Val hates her?</i>

1517
00:55:41,038 --> 00:55:44,249
Or what if Riley is better
than Val and Val respects her?

1518
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:46,500
- [screens chiming]
- [Joy] Yeah! There we go!

1519
00:55:46,501 --> 00:55:47,584
[sighs softly]

1520
00:55:47,585 --> 00:55:51,380
What if Riley is so bad she
has to give up hockey forever?

1521
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:54,216
What if Riley does so well
that the coach cries,

1522
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:55,634
and the Olympics call,

1523
00:55:55,635 --> 00:55:58,720
and she rallies
a weary nation to victory?

1524
00:55:58,721 --> 00:56:00,847
Uh, Joy,
reality is also a thing.

1525
00:56:00,848 --> 00:56:02,558
[screens chiming]

1526
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,643
No!

1527
00:56:03,976 --> 00:56:06,978
Anxiety has got you all
chained to desks,

1528
00:56:06,979 --> 00:56:08,397
drawing nightmares!

1529
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:10,983
But you don't have to
take it anymore!

1530
00:56:11,151 --> 00:56:13,277
Pencils down! Projections off!

1531
00:56:13,278 --> 00:56:14,362
Yeah!

1532
00:56:14,487 --> 00:56:15,822
- Enough is enough!
- [worker cheering]

1533
00:56:18,366 --> 00:56:20,034
[gasps] My projections!

1534
00:56:20,035 --> 00:56:21,452
Pillow fight!

1537
00:56:24,664 --> 00:56:26,041
For Riley!

<i>- We need to be prepared.</i>
- [screen shatters]

1539
00:56:31,379 --> 00:56:32,839
Oh! No!

1540
00:56:34,466 --> 00:56:35,507
[sighs in relief]

1541
00:56:35,508 --> 00:56:37,634
Okay, it's time to go!

1542
00:56:37,635 --> 00:56:38,885
Yeah, I think so.

1543
00:56:38,886 --> 00:56:41,056
- Bring it on, coppers!
- [Joy] Oh, no, no, no.

1544
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:43,474
[cop blows whistle]

[cop] Hey, get back here!

1547
00:56:46,187 --> 00:56:48,438
Quick! To the Parade
of Future Careers!

1548
00:56:48,771 --> 00:56:49,772
[workers chattering]

1549
00:56:51,733 --> 00:56:52,734
{\an8}Grab a balloon!

1550
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,318
- [Disgust] Oh, a pastry chef!
- [Joy] Underpaid!

1551
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:55,695
- [Fear] Art teacher!
- [Joy] Underappreciated.

1552
00:56:55,987 --> 00:56:58,405
- Oh, ethnomusicologist!
- I don't understand

1553
00:56:58,406 --> 00:57:00,491
what that is. Oh!
Supreme Court justice!

1554
00:57:00,492 --> 00:57:01,575
- That's the one!
- I trust her judgment.

1555
00:57:01,576 --> 00:57:02,660
Get back here!

1556
00:57:03,661 --> 00:57:05,413
- [Disgust] Move!
- [cop] They're getting away!

1557
00:57:07,582 --> 00:57:10,792
[chuckles] Yes! Now Riley can
get some sleep.

1558
00:57:10,793 --> 00:57:13,380
[Fear sobbing]
I miss the jar!

1559
00:57:13,546 --> 00:57:15,005
Joy doesn't get it.

1560
00:57:15,006 --> 00:57:17,341
Without our projections,
we won't be prepared.

1561
00:57:17,342 --> 00:57:19,135
Tomorrow's game is everything.

1562
00:57:19,136 --> 00:57:20,719
Coach will either
make us a Fire Hawk

1563
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,930
or doom us
to a friendless future.

1564
00:57:23,931 --> 00:57:26,393
I wish we knew what
Coach thought about us.

1565
00:57:27,227 --> 00:57:30,188
- [gasps] Her notebook!
- Yes! That's a great idea!

1566
00:57:30,855 --> 00:57:32,732
[Dani] <i>Everything Coach thinks
about you is in there.</i>

1567
00:57:34,067 --> 00:57:35,859
All we got to do is sneak
into her office

1568
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:37,237
- and read it.
- [Embarrassment whimpers]

1569
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,409
[Anxiety] <i>Come on, Riley.
Move those feet.</i>

1570
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,451
She doesn't want to?

1571
00:57:44,452 --> 00:57:46,287
Uh, are we pushing her
too hard?

1572
00:57:46,288 --> 00:57:48,206
We got to see
what's in the notebook!

1573
00:57:48,373 --> 00:57:50,250
It's the only way for us
to know how we can do better.

1574
00:57:58,591 --> 00:58:00,926
Oh, Riley, no.

1575
00:58:00,927 --> 00:58:02,470
[whimpers] Oh. Hmm.

1576
00:58:03,638 --> 00:58:05,639
[whispering]
Joy? Come in, Joy.

1577
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,765
[Joy loudly, over radio]
<i>Sadness?</i>

1578
00:58:06,766 --> 00:58:07,850
[muffled]
<i>Sadness, what's wrong?</i>

1579
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:09,060
Why is Riley awake again?

1580
00:58:09,061 --> 00:58:10,352
- Over.
- [Fear screaming]

1581
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:13,315
Anxiety is making Riley
break into the coach's office.

1582
00:58:13,481 --> 00:58:15,233
- What?
- She knows better than that.

1583
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,819
She will once we get her
Sense of Self back.

1584
00:58:17,985 --> 00:58:20,072
Sadness,
you have to stop her.

1585
00:58:20,238 --> 00:58:22,074
<i>Just don't get caught.</i>

1586
00:58:22,949 --> 00:58:23,950
<i>- Over!</i>

[gasps] Sadness?

1604
00:59:37,732 --> 00:59:39,233
Ennui! Where's your phone?

1605
00:59:39,234 --> 00:59:41,319
Ooh, la, la, my phone?
Where is my phone?

This is not happening!

No, no, no!

1608
00:59:44,947 --> 00:59:47,325
Okay, she's got to be here
somewhere. Find her.

[Sadness] Uh... No.

1613
01:00:10,014 --> 01:00:13,142
[sighs] I know Riley
sneaking around feels wrong.

1614
01:00:13,143 --> 01:00:15,312
This isn't who Riley is.

1615
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:17,897
It's not about who Riley is.

1616
01:00:18,065 --> 01:00:20,400
It's about
who she needs to be.

Wait. Coach already decided?

1620
01:00:39,544 --> 01:00:40,919
We're not making the team?

1621
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,172
No. We have one day left.

1622
01:00:43,173 --> 01:00:44,673
What do we do? What can we do?

1623
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:46,092
- Okay, okay, okay.
- What would Val do?

1624
01:00:46,093 --> 01:00:49,345
Uh, well, we're just gonna
have to change Coach's mind.

1625
01:00:49,346 --> 01:00:50,972
Which means
we're gonna need ideas.

1626
01:00:51,139 --> 01:00:52,181
Lots of them.

1627
01:00:52,182 --> 01:00:54,309

Oh, no. It's a Brainstorm!

Trash talk the other team?

1633
01:01:11,618 --> 01:01:13,370
- [laughing] Ooh!
- Yes!

1634
01:01:15,622 --> 01:01:18,416
We can't let these bad ideas
get to Riley. [grunts]

1635
01:01:18,833 --> 01:01:19,834
Joy!

1636
01:01:19,959 --> 01:01:21,628
[rumbling]

1637
01:01:21,753 --> 01:01:23,963

Joy!

1639
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:28,093
[all screaming]

1640
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:35,182
I'll start sorting these into
ideas I wish I'd thought of.

1641
01:01:35,183 --> 01:01:37,351
Oh, no, no, no.
None of these are good enough.

1642
01:01:37,352 --> 01:01:39,271
We need more. Get more!

1643

01:01:41,356 --> 01:01:43,107

[grunting] Whoa!

[grunting, spits]

1647

than the broccoli!

[grunts, screams]

1651
01:01:57,205 --> 01:01:59,457
- Whoa!
- These ideas are too small.

1652
01:01:59,624 --> 01:02:01,042
These ideas are too small!

1653
01:02:01,043 --> 01:02:02,710
We need something bigger.

1654
01:02:04,254 --> 01:02:05,255
[gasps]

1655
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:08,299
That's our way out!

01:02:13,846 --> 01:02:14,847

- [all screaming]

1659
01:02:22,064 --> 01:02:24,315
Joy! We need this idea!

1660
01:02:24,316 --> 01:02:25,566
If Riley takes
one of these ideas,

1661
01:02:25,567 --> 01:02:26,984
it could be a disaster!

1662
01:02:27,152 --> 01:02:29,237
Joy, the only way out is up.

Whoa! I like it.

1668
01:02:48,423 --> 01:02:50,300

you have a parachute?

[Fear] Uh, yes.

1674
01:03:03,896 --> 01:03:05,689
The real question is,
why don't any of you?

1675

[Disgust laughs]

1676
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:09,235

- [Disgust] Yes!

- We made it!

Come on,
to the Back of the Mind!

You're finished, Anxiety!

[warbling weakly]

1682
01:03:19,037 --> 01:03:20,996
Coach is right.
Riley isn't ready.

1683
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:24,583
But we're so close
to a new Riley who is.

1684
01:03:24,584 --> 01:03:25,960
This is what we're missing.

1685
01:03:26,503 --> 01:03:30,632
We show them we're a Fire Hawk
who will do whatever it takes.

[♪ thrilling music playing]

1687

Finally, we're one of them!

1688
01:03:54,947 --> 01:03:56,241
What do you think, Sadness?

1689
01:03:56,408 --> 01:03:57,575
- Well, I...
- Awesome!

[Envy]

[Bree] Yeah, no,

1692
01:04:00,412 --> 01:04:01,704
I mean, it's so much fun.

[Bree chuckling]

1694
01:04:07,794 --> 01:04:10,504
Okay, it's giving jealousy.
I'm sorry.

1695
01:04:10,505 --> 01:04:11,713
[scoffs]
They wouldn't know cool

1696
01:04:11,714 --> 01:04:13,091
if it hit them in the face.

1697
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:14,883
[Valentina]
Hey, Michigan.

1698
01:04:14,884 --> 01:04:17,344
Oh! Rocking the red, huh?

1699
01:04:17,345 --> 01:04:19,471
- Yes!
- We are in.

1700
01:04:19,472 --> 01:04:21,015
[chuckles] I hope it's okay.

1701
01:04:21,183 --> 01:04:22,724
I know I'm not officially
a Fire Hawk yet,

1702
01:04:22,725 --> 01:04:24,226
but I figured since we're
on the same team

1703
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:25,353
we should match, right?

1704
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,563
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

1705
01:04:26,729 --> 01:04:28,190
Did you, um, sleep last night?

1706
01:04:28,356 --> 01:04:30,566
No, how could I?
Big game today!

1707
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:32,151
You mean the camp scrimmage?

1708
01:04:32,152 --> 01:04:34,571
See? I told you
not to freak her out.

1709
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:36,864
You're all good, okay?
I see you're in your zone.

1710
01:04:37,032 --> 01:04:38,825
Get ready to score some goals.

1711
01:04:38,991 --> 01:04:40,327
Yeah! I will!

1712
01:04:40,535 --> 01:04:42,078
Val scored two goals
in the scrimmage

1713
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:43,163
to become a Fire Hawk.

1714
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:44,914
And you know
what's better than two?

1715
01:04:45,082 --> 01:04:46,083
- Three!
- Three!

1716
01:04:46,084 --> 01:04:47,249
I was just about to say that.

1717
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,876
We were about to say that
at the same time.

1718
01:04:49,044 --> 01:04:52,004
But how are we gonna score
three goals?

1719
01:04:52,172 --> 01:04:54,132
The new Riley
will handle anything.

1720
01:04:54,299 --> 01:04:56,968
And I think this
is the finishing touch.

1721
01:04:57,844 --> 01:04:59,137
[panel chimes]

1722
01:05:00,222 --> 01:05:01,306

01:24:52,747 --> 01:24:54,540
Oh, is it Coach's email?

2077
01:24:54,541 --> 01:24:56,959
No. It's Bree and Grace.
[chuckles]

2078
01:24:57,085 --> 01:24:59,337
Aw. I miss those girls.

2079
01:24:59,629 --> 01:25:02,131
Oh. Remember when
Bree and Grace,

2080
01:25:02,132 --> 01:25:03,550
- and us used to...
- You're still early.

2081
01:25:03,716 --> 01:25:05,093
- No, no, no. Too early.
- Go downstairs.

2082
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:07,762
I'll just be downstairs
if you need me.

2083
01:25:07,929 --> 01:25:09,389
[Joy] <i>It's 3 minutes to 2:00.</i>

2084
01:25:09,556 --> 01:25:12,015
- She's got this.
- 'Cause she's got us.

2085
01:25:12,016 --> 01:25:17,522
Ooh, yeah! Right? 'Cause
she's... [nervously] Maybe?

2086
01:25:17,689 --> 01:25:19,191
All right, Embarrassment.

2087
01:25:19,357 --> 01:25:21,193
Everybody,
look at Embarrassment!

2088
01:25:22,069 --> 01:25:23,320
[whimpers]

2089
01:25:23,570 --> 01:25:25,487
Hey, look, if you don't
make it this year,

2090
01:25:25,488 --> 01:25:26,698
there's always next year.

2091
01:25:27,032 --> 01:25:28,282
I know.

2092
01:25:28,283 --> 01:25:30,785
- I love our girl.
- How could you not?

2093
01:25:30,952 --> 01:25:32,369
<i>She's super smart.</i>

2094
01:25:32,370 --> 01:25:33,912
[Sadness] <i>And great at hockey.</i>

2095
01:25:33,913 --> 01:25:35,290
[Disgust]
<i>She's really creative.</i>

2096
01:25:35,457 --> 01:25:37,833
She can be bored,
but never boring.

2097
01:25:37,834 --> 01:25:40,627
But she can be a little
sarcastic from time to time.

2098
01:25:40,628 --> 01:25:43,715
[Fear] <i>She can have
really bad ideas.</i>

2099
01:25:43,881 --> 01:25:46,593
[Anger] <i>Occasionally, she can
do the wrong thing.</i>

2100
01:25:46,759 --> 01:25:49,804
[Joy] <i>And sometimes, she can be
too hard on herself.</i>

2101
01:25:50,138 --> 01:25:52,890
<i>But every bit of Riley
makes her who she is.</i>

2102
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,810
<i>And we love all of our girl.</i>

2103
01:25:57,187 --> 01:26:01,023
<i>Every messy,
beautiful piece of her.</i>

2104
01:26:01,149 --> 01:26:02,150

2105
01:26:06,571 --> 01:26:08,740
[♪ hopeful music ends]

[♪ upbeat music playing]

2107
01:26:30,011 --> 01:26:32,305
So, Riley, how was camp?

2108
01:26:33,348 --> 01:26:36,058
Okay, we talked about this.
We tell them everything.

2109
01:26:36,059 --> 01:26:37,434
Uh...

2110
01:26:37,435 --> 01:26:38,519
But what about sneaking

2111
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:39,770
- into Coach's office?
- What about hitting Grace?

2112
01:26:39,771 --> 01:26:40,854
- Remember the lying?
- Are we gonna

2113
01:26:40,855 --> 01:26:41,980
tell her about the Fire Hawks?

2114
01:26:41,981 --> 01:26:43,482
- She doesn't need to know.
- Objection.

2115
01:26:43,483 --> 01:26:44,651
<i>Pardon. Excusez moi.</i>

2116
01:26:44,817 --> 01:26:45,859
[console chimes]

2117
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:46,944
It was good.

2118
01:26:49,072 --> 01:26:52,283
She goes away for three days
and all we get is, "good"?

2119
01:26:52,284 --> 01:26:53,493
And what about
the red in her hair?

2120
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:54,661
Did she join a gang?

2121
01:26:54,827 --> 01:26:56,288
Welcome back, Anxiety.

2122
01:26:58,165 --> 01:27:01,793
She goes away for three days
and all we get is, "good"?

2123
01:27:02,419 --> 01:27:04,754
Yeah. Sounds right.
Back to the game.

2124
01:27:04,921 --> 01:27:06,797

It's time.

[groans]

2139
01:34:56,601 --> 01:35:00,187
It's okay. Come on.

[mumbling]

2141
01:35:02,399 --> 01:35:04,776
Okay. Let it go, buddy.

2142
01:35:04,942 --> 01:35:06,194
What's the secret?

[sighs wearily]

2144
01:35:08,363 --> 01:35:11,324
We burn hole in rug.

2145
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:13,493
Really? That's it? Whew!

2146
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:16,078
I thought you were gonna say
the time we peed in the pool.

2147
01:35:16,079 --> 01:35:18,290
- [whimpers]
- Oh, no, wait.

2148
01:35:20,292 --> 01:35:21,501
And he's gone.
