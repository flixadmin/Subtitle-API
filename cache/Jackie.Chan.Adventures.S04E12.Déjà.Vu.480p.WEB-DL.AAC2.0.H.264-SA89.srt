00:00:01,868 --> 00:00:04,670
Previously
- on <i> Jackie chan adventures...</i>

2
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:06,905
Prepare for battle.

3
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,541
Daolon wong!

4
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:11,810
Enforcers: Argh!

5
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:13,045
Aah!
Unh!

6
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:14,279
Ugh!
Guh!

7
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:17,016
Busted.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,454
Quickly, Jackie.

9
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:25,824
We must find
deja vu stone
before daolon wong.

10
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:28,560
Can you believe
dark wizard was
released from jail

11
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,763
for good behavior?

12
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:33,632
I do not think
the justice system
is prepared

13
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:36,835
to comprehend crimes
of magic, uncle.

14
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:38,504
(Gasps)

15
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:45,577
Blowfish indicates
stone is near.

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,849
What is so important
about a deja vu stone?

17
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:52,951
Whosoever
possesses stone

18
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:55,854
can transport himself
into his own past

19
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:57,289
and back again,

20
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,858
simply by willing it.

21
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,829
Daolon wong could revisit
all his past defeats.

22
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,466
(Grunting)

23
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,809
Ow!

24
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:24,483
Why would anyone
want to be defeated

25
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:26,618
over and over
again? Ow!

26
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,520
You are slow on uptake!

27
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,689
Daolon wong
is now powerless.

28
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,558
He would change
past outcomes

29
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,126
to regain his magic.

30
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:35,527
(Footsteps)

31
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:36,929
(Gasps)

32
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:40,399
The dark chi
master himself?

33
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:43,936
T'ch! The sly
niece-meister herself!

34
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,905
(Gasps)
The deja vu stone!

35
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,540
Jade!

36
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:49,908
Come on, Jackie.

37
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,111
I've helped save the day
72 times,

38
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:53,445
the world
half a dozen times,

39
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,414
and your butt more times
than I care to count.

40
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:57,049
And you have made
a mess of things

41
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:59,251
more times than I
care to count.

42
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:01,186
But I always clean up
after myself.

43
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,956
Just admit it, Jackie.
You need me. Hey!

44
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,190
Ha!

45
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,825
All: Daolon wong?!

46
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:09,895
Many thanks
for the memories.

47
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,633
Hyah!

48
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,137
Jackie?

49
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,906
(Echoing)
Jackie?

50
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,258
Uh, where'd they go?

51
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,726
Somewhere in time.

52
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,062
We must locate
their whereabouts.

53
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,665
How? History's
a big place.

54
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:22,234
Deja vu stone
allows one to travel

55
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:25,571
only into
their own past.

56
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:31,210
Jade:
Whoa! Mondo rewind.

57
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,515
But which Jackie
is the one we're
looking for?

58
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:39,084
According to uncle's
locator spell,

59
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:40,986
that one.

60
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,292
Funny. I have
the strangest feeling

61
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,927
I have been here before.

62
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,896
Chan! The tal--

63
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:54,066
oh, tohru! Am I
glad to see you!

64
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:56,068
One moment, I was
in the far east

65
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,736
confronting
daolon wong.

66
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:58,937
The next,
I am here in--

67
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,772
yargh!
Waah!

68
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:02,908
Grr!

69
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,610
Yargh!
Waah!

70
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,447
Tohru, what has
gotten into you?

71
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:10,148
It is as if
you are--

72
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,917
the talisman.

73
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,853
Working for
the dark hand.

74
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:18,857
The deja vu stone!
I have been here before!

75
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,926
Aah!
Yargh!

76
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,895
And I do not think
I enjoyed myself!

77
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:25,964
Whoa!

78
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,666
Grr!

79
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,003
Yargh!

80
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:33,772
I do not see
deja vu stone.

81
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,307
Daolon wong
must have it.

82
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:36,908
So Jackie's
stuck there?

83
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,143
And why isn't
wong with him?

84
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:39,945
Perhaps because
the ex-wizard

85
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,480
was randomly hurled

86
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:43,949
somewhere into
his own past.

87
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,451
We must help Jackie
with portal magic.

88
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,090
Unh!

89
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:56,028
Heh! I knew you were
going to do that.

90
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,730
I'm sorry to leave
a future friend

91
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,565
in the lurch, tohru.

92
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,968
Chan!

93
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,571
Both: Aah!

94
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,006
Ooh!

95
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:11,176
Hey, didn't
Jackie get out
of this scrape

96
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,145
in one piece
the first time
around?

97
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,180
When one revisits past,

98
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:18,050
one risks changing
its outcome.

99
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:23,989
Ooh! That's is not

100
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,725
what happened
the first time.

101
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:27,993
But this happens next.

102
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,162
Unh!
Waah!

103
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:32,030
You did it, unc!

104
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,665
So where's Jackie?

105
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,068
Portal magic good
for quick escape,

106
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,036
but only way back
to present time

107
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:41,740
is through the power
of the deja vu stone.

108
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,008
(Gasps)

109
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,843
Portal magic
will allow Jackie

110
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,578
to visit more memories,

111
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,648
where he will hopefully
locate daolon wong

112
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,750
and the stone.

113
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,822
How did I--

114
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,256
where am I?

115
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,426
Oh, no!

116
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,268
Oh! This is one memory

117
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,304
I have been trying
to forget!

118
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,910
I outran the train before,

119
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,479
I will do it again!

120
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:22,247
Unh! Aah!

121
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,782
I must be out of shape!

122
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:26,051
Uncle, when you
said the past
could change,

123
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,285
did you mean--

124
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:29,321
if Jackie makes
wrong move,

125
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:32,724
he may never
come out alive.

126
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,727
Yaah!

127
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,466
Yaah!

128
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,571
Aah!

129
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:50,175
Whew! The past
sure is tense.

130
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:53,111
Humph! Jackie must learn
to be more careful.

131
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,646
So, where to next?

132
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:57,916
Where Jackie stops,
nobody knows.

133
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,920
Ugh! Aah!

134
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,488
A broken leg?!

135
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,857
But I did not even
hit the ground!

136
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,059
Jackie!
Oh, Jade!

137
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,495
Do you see
the mess you have
gotten me into?

138
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,431
Gee, Jackie,
I already admitted

139
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:13,598
it was totally my fault

140
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,233
you slipped
on my gnomekop action figure

141
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,468
and busted your leg.

142
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,702
No, not that!

143
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,471
If you hadn't
gotten in the way

144
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:22,240
and allowed
daolon wong to take
the deja vu stone,

145
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,709
I wouldn't be
lost in time.

146
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,011
Huh?

147
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:28,680
Ugh! Never mind.

148
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:30,816
You are
the past Jade.

149
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:32,684
You wouldn't know
about that.

150
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:35,487
Uncle,
do you think
Jackie's right?

151
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,322
Did I really
mess things up?

152
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,291
Humph! Nonsense, Jade.

153
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,660
Jackie needs to watch
where he's walking.

154
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:43,862
Not the broken leg!
The deja vu thing!

155
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,096
I stood there
like a dummy

156
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,565
while wong
snaked it from me.

157
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:49,234
It's all my fault
Jackie's stuck
in rerun-ville.

158
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:50,802
Ohh!

159
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,507
Jackie!

160
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,242
Aah!

161
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:58,844
Gee. Couldn't you
send Jackie

162
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,779
to a less
life-threatening
roller coaster,

163
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:02,848
like the pukinator
at moose world?

164
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,383
Uncle has no control
over portal direction.

165
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:08,353
It is process of
trial and error.

166
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:09,788
Bad day, bad day,
bad day!

167
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,923
Mostly error.

168
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:19,097
Aah!

169
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,866
Whoa!

170
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,170
After him!

171
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,639
Oh, magic hole,
please open up!

172
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,040
I do not know
where you come from,

173
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,810
but I am ready for you
to take me away from here!

174
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,718
Whoa! Look at
Jackie go!

175
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,954
Hmm.
Guess he does do ok
without my help.

176
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,364
Aah!

177
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,589
I'll give Jackie
a 9.2 for thinking
on his feet,

178
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,791
but we really
work much better
as a team.

179
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,927
Jackie: No! No, Jade!

180
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:24,129
Do not get on that plane!

181
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,900
Heh heh! See?
Teamwork!

182
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,202
You never listen.

183
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,145
Not this.
Anything but this!

184
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,782
(Huffing and puffing)

185
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:46,985
Aah!

186
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,620
Ohh!

187
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:51,222
Ok, things can't
get any worse
for Jackie.

188
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,359
Unh!

189
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,895
Turning into statue
is better?

190
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:58,663
Heh heh.
- Depends who you ask.

191
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,376
Jackie: Quick, Jade!
The antidote!

192
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:14,646
No!

193
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:16,715
T'ch, you'd think
I woulda got it right

194
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,149
the second time around.

195
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,585
Your past self
does not know then

196
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:23,021
what you know now,
Jade.

197
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,756
Maybe--
urk--

198
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,424
this is preferable to--
ohh--

199
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:29,327
being cursed
to relive all the--
uhh--

200
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,396
worst moments of my life!

201
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,132
Whew!

202
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,868
Jackie was very close
to becoming pigeon roost.

203
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,204
Uh, let's hope
he doesn't become

204
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:40,872
dragon chow.

205
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,143
Uhh!

206
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,649
Of all the villains,
I had to bump
into shendu?

207
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,151
Uhh!

208
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,823
Cute.

209
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,259
Bwaaa!

210
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,664
(Gasps)
Invisibility.

211
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,433
Bwaaa!

212
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,774
Monkey see, monkey do!

213
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,911
Aah!

214
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,283
Ooh!
If memory serves,

215
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,318
here's where I make
a star entrance

216
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,887
and save the day.

217
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,194
The strength talisman.
Good one.

218
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,630
I know, Jade--
bwaaa!

219
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:39,798
Jade?!
How did you--

220
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,466
your hands!

221
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:42,667
I get it,
that must be

222
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,402
some uncle magic and--
(Gasps)

223
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:46,104
Bwaaa!

224
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:48,306
Ugh!
I blew it again!

225
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:51,109
I distracted Jackie
just like I did today.

226
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:52,911
Does twice make a pattern?

227
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,749
Oh, no!

228
00:11:57,751 --> 00:12:00,085
Valmont has
the dragon talisman power!

229
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:09,828
Ah, now things are
getting interesting.

230
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,930
Uhh!

231
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:14,966
Uhh!

232
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:24,909
Ohh!

233
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,580
Respect your elders.

234
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:29,681
Ohh!

235
00:12:29,683 --> 00:12:32,751
Uncle! How do you
spray for bugs?

236
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,819
Ow!

237
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:38,256
One more thing...

238
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,126
Ha ha!

239
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:43,762
Who else wants
a piece of uncle?

240
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,897
Ok, but have you
saved Jackie's butt

241
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,499
72 times?

242
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:49,768
I'm the one who always
gets him out of binds.

243
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,337
Uhh!
Uhh!

244
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:53,738
Do not waste
your strength.

245
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,774
Someone will come.

246
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:59,410
This is a job
for supermoose!

247
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,579
¶ Dope Dee dope Dee Doe ¶

248
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,515
guh-huh.

249
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:06,050
Heh. Well,
almost always.

250
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,422
Could it be?

251
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,525
Jackie: A view?

252
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:16,828
In a nice, cozy,
danger-free hotel?

253
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,630
A happy memory?

254
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:21,399
Wha? Bwaaa!

255
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,571
Jackie, don't worry.
I can explain everything.

256
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:27,939
(Creaking)

257
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,676
(Together)
Heh. Hi, Jackie.

258
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:33,278
So I'm quite the rascal.

259
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,481
But it's not like
I'm evil or anything.

260
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,259
Jackie: Jade?

261
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,295
I couldn't help it.
I was possessed!

262
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,497
Did uncle ask you
to tattoo demon face

263
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,698
onto your leg?

264
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,866
No?

265
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:57,068
You do not see
uncle walking around

266
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,204
being evil, do you?

267
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:01,472
Uh...Unc?

268
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,074
(Snarling)

269
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:04,776
Uncle could not help it,

270
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:07,812
was victim of chi vampire.

271
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:10,782
Oh, yeah,
- and I had a piece
of your mind.

272
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:16,254
You must keep
vampire uncle busy

273
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,690
while I learn
how to subdue him!

274
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:21,459
My master will feast
upon your <i> chi!</i>

275
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,394
Please, learn fast!

276
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:24,596
And while you're at it,

277
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:26,197
learn a way to send me
back to the future

278
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,966
where I belong!

279
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,042
Uncle, isn't there
some way to,

280
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:41,012
I don't know,
make the portal
magic work faster?

281
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,083
There is one way,

282
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,819
but it is
very risky.

283
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,122
Riskier than
an up-close look

284
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:52,891
at po Kong
- the mountain demon's
tonsils?

285
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,526
Megadose of garlic.

286
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,366
Whew!
Too close.

287
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:04,102
(Gasps)
It is as I feared!

288
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:06,037
Bad day! Bad day!

289
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,305
Bad day! Bad day!

290
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,741
Bad day! Bad day!
Bad day! Bad day!

291
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,110
Bad day! Bad day!
Bad day! Bad day!

292
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,511
What's happening,
uncle?

293
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:16,547
Garlic has accelerated
portal magic,

294
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:21,319
causing Jackie to bounce
against walls of time.

295
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,854
Jackie:
Bad day! Bad day!

296
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,126
Jackie:
Bad day! Bad day!
Bad day! Bad day!

297
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,727
One more thing.
One more thing.

298
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,329
One more thing.
One more thing.

299
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:34,065
One more thing.
One more thing.
One more thing.

300
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,199
Duh. T'ch.

301
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,334
Duh. T'ch.

302
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:37,735
Duh. T'ch.

303
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,404
Duh. T'ch. Duh.

304
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:40,972
Ow! Ow! Ow!

305
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:43,174
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

306
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:44,309
If this doesn't
end soon,

307
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:45,576
I'm gonna hurl.

308
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:48,146
Uncle becoming
very dizzy.

309
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,949
Aah!

310
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,285
Ohh. Where'd
he go this time?

311
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,386
Ah!

312
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:56,487
Brrr!

313
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,022
We have found
daolon wong,

314
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:00,725
but not deja vu stone.

315
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:02,160
Their struggle
must have caused

316
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:04,195
stone itself
to be randomly lost

317
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:07,165
in one of their
past experiences.

318
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,633
Uncle!

319
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:09,701
Aah! Uhh!

320
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:10,835
Huh?

321
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,937
Uh...Hello.

322
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:14,339
Uhh!

323
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:15,873
Hmm.

324
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,410
Portal magic?

325
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,149
See the oinker
at 12 o'clock?

326
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,552
Yes, that is
very nice, Jade,

327
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:29,721
but I am really
not supposed to be here--

328
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:30,822
oh.

329
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,391
There!

330
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:35,326
Check it out!
I helped!

331
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,961
The deja vu stone.

332
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:40,064
Uh, yeah, whatever.
Aren't we looking
for the pig talisman?

333
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,466
Uhh!

334
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:42,867
Tohru!

335
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:45,036
Many thanks

336
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:48,473
for leading us
to the prize.

337
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,742
You are not welcome.

338
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:51,809
You!

339
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:55,346
Why so afraid?
He is an old man.

340
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,549
Uhh! Ohh! Uhh!
Ohh! Uhh! Ohh!

341
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,451
Uhh!

342
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,420
That will teach
foolish tohru

343
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:04,422
to mess with uncle
when he is powered

344
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:07,859
by immortality talisman.

345
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,261
Oh. Do not tell
faithful apprentice

346
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:11,829
uncle said that.

347
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:13,564
Come on, Jackie!
Grab the stone

348
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,166
and will yourself
back here.

349
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,937
Hyah!

350
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,076
Since you seem
to have things
well in hand, uncle,

351
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,911
I will take my leave.
(Gasps)

352
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:30,181
The stone is mine!

353
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:31,816
Who is that?!

354
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:33,184
And what is
with this stone

355
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,886
you all keep
jabbering about?

356
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,288
Whoa. Wong
snaked his way in!

357
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,956
Aiyaaa!

358
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,894
(Breathing hard)

359
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,163
Take me back
to the beginning!

360
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,735
So here we are,

361
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,738
back in the old fool's
trash heap.

362
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,608
That is old fool's
rare trash heap to you!

363
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,911
Wait a sec.

364
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,712
Jackie went to
the wrong beginning:

365
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,281
The first time
we met!

366
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:05,049
Wait. This can't
be right.

367
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,417
Where are uncle and--

368
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,652
give me that!

369
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:09,287
Ohh!

370
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,724
Jade.

371
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:16,828
Jackie is right.
I do get in his way.

372
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:26,337
You're Jackie chan,
the archeologist?

373
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,306
I bet
you are looking
for the shield

374
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:29,907
I brought back
from Bavaria.

375
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,742
We're looking for--
how'd you know?

376
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:34,078
He has it.

377
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,313
Chan is lying!

378
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:38,349
Do you not recognize
your master?

379
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:41,052
The only master
we have is big v.

380
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:43,387
Chow: And he's gonna
wanna hear all about

381
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:46,257
where you stashed
the shield.

382
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,727
Way to rewrite
history, Jackie.

383
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,498
Did they buy anything?
No.

384
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,000
You are terrible salesman!

385
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,140
Who are
you calling?

386
00:19:02,142 --> 00:19:05,176
Jade's parents.
She must return
to Hong Kong.

387
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:06,744
But she just arrived!

388
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,079
What? No way!

389
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:09,347
Who's gonna help
save the day?

390
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,182
The world?
Jackie's butt?!

391
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:13,084
Uncle,
you must trust me.

392
00:19:13,086 --> 00:19:14,752
It will be
better for Jade,

393
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:17,321
for us,
if she does not stay.

394
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,091
No, Jackie.
Hang up the phone.

395
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:21,392
You need me.

396
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,796
Hyah!

397
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,965
Jade is in the house.

398
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:35,072
I got your back,
Jackie.

399
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,346
Man: Hello?

400
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,082
Uh, sorry.
Wrong number.

401
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:47,919
Uncle: Jackie,

402
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:50,121
next time you
make crank call,

403
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:51,789
phone local.

404
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,925
Living with you guys
is gonna rock!

405
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:57,628
(Sighs)
You have no idea yet
just how much.

406
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,130
(Gasps)
You speak English!

407
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:02,500
Now, return me
to the present.

408
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:08,139
Jackie!
You do need me!

409
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:10,708
Jade,
how did you know?

410
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,579
Where did Jackie go?

411
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:16,747
I'm glad you decided
to keep me around.

412
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:19,217
Let us just say,
I realized that perhaps

413
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,819
you have saved me
a time or two.

414
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:24,088
T'ch. Try 72.

415
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,599
Hey, Jackie, do you
believe fortune tellers
can predict the future?

416
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:37,235
Uh, actually,
I don't believe.

417
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,803
I only believe myself.

418
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:41,939
Work hard, learn more,
helping people,

419
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,975
always give people
second chance,

420
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:45,543
then you have
a good future.

421
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:47,245
That's what I believe.
