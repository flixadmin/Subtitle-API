1
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,434
- Papa?
- Yeah, I'm gonna talk to him.

2
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:15,218
- You promise?
- Of course.

3
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:17,250
- We'll do it soon.
- Okay.

4
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,916
Papa! Papa, he's coming.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,541
- He's coming.
- Calm down.

6
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,505
- There he is.
- I'll ask him.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,500
Professor...

8
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,625
Professor, would you like a little...

9
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,666
a little coffee, huh?

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,833
Well, yes, that'd be great. Thank you.

11
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,041
Good morning.

12
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,000
Here's your coffee.

13
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,333
Want some cookies, Professor?

14
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:41,583
Okay, um...

15
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,208
Thank you.

16
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,666
You have something to ask me?

17
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,583
Mm... Um...

18
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,375
Uh...

19
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,500
- One little thing.
- Yeah, uh...

20
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:58,166
A really quick question.

21
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:00,416
Do you have a brother?

22
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:04,750
Please. No personal questions.
It's one of the first rules, so please...

23
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:08,333
So, I have a buddy.
He's... He's like a brother.

24
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,291
We were in the mine together,

25
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:12,166
stole together, in jail together.

26
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,375
And that's the problem, because I'm out,
and he still has five years left.

27
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:19,125
- Five years, Professor.
- Yes, well, it's just that...

28
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:22,166
I'm sorry, but I don't know
what I can do for your...

29
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,333
for your friend or your brother, whoever.

30
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:25,958
No, it's his son.

31
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,291
- For his son?
- Yes, Juanito. He's my godson.

32
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,291
He's also like a brother to me.

33
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:33,708
I promised him
when I got out of jail to look after him.

34
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:37,833
And we haven't seen him in a long time,
and we've just heard he's not doing well.

35
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:40,458
He's out of work, almost homeless.

36
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:44,291
And I thought it'll give him
a fresh start... if we bring him here.

37
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,708
You think it's better
getting him involved with a heist?

38
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:48,375
This heist is incredible.

39
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,250
Just look at this kid.

40
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:52,583
I've never seen him
more focused in my life.

41
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:56,750
And if it works out, when there's food
for a hundred, there's food for one more.

42
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,833
- Moscow, I'm really sorry. It's...
- This guy is incredible.

43
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:01,833
No. It doesn't matter if he's amazing.

44
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,708
He's good at everything.

45
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,250
Why do you think

46
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,458
we call you Denver and you Moscow

47
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,291
and Helsinki? It's a matter safety.

48
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:13,083
No one's supposed to know the names
of the others in the heist. You can't...

49
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,291
Moscow, listen to me.

50
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:17,708
I already made an exception by bringing in
your son. And now your godson?

51
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:21,000
It's not a family business where we can
suddenly give your second cousin a job...

52
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,000
Wait. What the fuck
are you talking about, nerd?

53
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,601
- What?
- Hey, hey. Watch your language!

54
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,465
Hold on.
What we're talking about here is a guy

55
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,380
- who's almost homeless, Papa.
- Relax.

56
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,892
We're putting our lives on the line
for this jerk, and he repays us

57
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:32,708
with some shit about city names?

58
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,875
Professor, do you know what I'm gonna do
with the name Denver?

59
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:38,916
I'm gonna stick it up your ass
because my name is Dani.

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,333
I've been Dani my whole life.
I'll tell you another thing.

61
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:44,375
Your plan, your perfect plan
for the Royal Mint of Spain,

62
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,625
it's bullshit.
Real fucking bullshit.

63
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,375
There's a printer downstairs.

64
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:51,125
We can print the bills here
and it'll be a lot easier.

65
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,875
Thank you so much for the coffee.

66
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:01,250
This is the last time you speak
to that man like that. Understand me?

67
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,000
This is embarrassing for me.

68
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,958
He's an intellectual.

69
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,750
Well, we have to do something.

70
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,416
You have to trust this man.
You have to respect him.

71
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,291
- You don't think I respect him?
- No!

72
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:17,250
No, no, no. The thing is,
maybe the kid's onto something.

73
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,708
If we print the bills at home,
we'd avoid a lot of problems,

74
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,375
and we don't have to spend
any money on guns

75
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,500
or ammunition. Right?

76
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,208
Denver, you bring us the printer,

77
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,416
and we'll download bills
from the internet.

78
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:32,916
Nice work, maestro.

79
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,458
No, no, no.

80
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,541
Better yet...

81
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,375
I could draw the bills...
and you can color them.

82
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:41,291
We could manage two a day.

83
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:45,083
Hm? After all,
I pride myself on my artistry.

84
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,000
I call it

85
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:49,958
<i>Passion for Juanito.</i>

86
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,666
Are you gonna keep busting my balls?

87
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,630
Because maybe I could
bust your fucking face in,

88
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,186
and then we could print some new teeth
for you. You're so funny!

89
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,541
Everyone, go fuck yourselves.

90
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,166
Denver, don't get mad. It's a joke.

91
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,416
<i>I woke up as a prisoner
of one of our prisoners.</i>

92
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:13,958
<i>Chained,</i>

93
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,250
<i>disoriented, with a madman in front of me.</i>

94
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,833
<i>I'd lost my freedom,
and the clock was ticking.</i>

95
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,791
<i>Only 15 minutes after I opened my eyes,</i>

96
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:26,958
<i>Gandía would've already attacked
most of the gang.</i>

97
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,375
What are you doing? Hm?

98
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,708
- If you weren't tied up, I'd break you.
- Let me go.

99
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,333
Then we'll see who breaks who.

100
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,166
Why didn't you kill me?

101
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:51,916
I am not a murderer.

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,375
You're not a murderer?

103
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:58,083
You tried to kill Nairobi and Helsinki,
and you're not a murderer?

104
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,666
So why didn't you kill me?

105
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,500
You're my chained beast.

106
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,250
And you?

107
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,291
What the fuck are you?

108
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,375
I'm the tamer.

109
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,291
And you're in luck.

110
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,083
I'm turning you domesticated.

111
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,510
The next time you kick me,

112
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,063
I'll beat the shit out of you so hard

113
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,541
that nobody in your gang
will ever recognize you.

114
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,458
Stay still.

115
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,875
You will stay still.

116
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,120
Stay still.

117
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,333
Listen to me. I'm gonna explain.

118
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,416
It's very easy.

119
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,625
Motherfucker.

120
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,083
Ssh. Look.

121
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,208
My first card is you.

122
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:55,958
Missing.

123
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,000
They have no choice but to look for you.

124
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,583
And the search will drive them mad.

125
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,875
Divided and nervous.

126
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,875
<i>I'm already winning.</i>

127
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,458
The next card...

128
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,583
Shatter your team.

129
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,166
Didn't you wonder how I escaped?

130
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:25,666
This is Gandía,

131
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,333
<i>chief of security for the Bank of Spain.</i>

132
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,791
<i>At the moment, I'm hidden.</i>

133
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,666
<i>I'm safe, and I'm capable
of taking whatever action</i>

134
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,833
<i>is necessary to recover</i>

135
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,916
- full control and security...
- He wants to kill all of us!

136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,916
<i>Stay together. He's watching you!</i>

137
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,783
<i>As you've just heard,</i>

138
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,791
I'm with marvelous company.

139

You'd better start behaving

149
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,750
because if you don't,
you'll be completely immobilized.

150
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:02,250
Tied up with a gag in your mouth,
a blindfold over your eyes.

151
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:06,125
And then we won't be able
to continue getting to know each other.

152
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:07,875
Get it?

153
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:10,500
Good.

154
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,916
I'd like to take this moment
to give my thanks to Palermo.

155
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,750
<i>His advice
on how to escape from my handcuffs</i>

156
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,708
<i>by dislocating my thumb
is what made me a free man.</i>

157
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,666
<i>Thanks to him,
I hope to be able to help all of you.</i>

158
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,166
Well, this will be fun.

159
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,583
Is that true?

160
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,916
If you prefer believing a psychopath
before a colleague, okay.

161
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,041
That's your decision.

162
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,375
Save your breath, you motherfucker.

163
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,642
- Mr. Denver, I need to use the bathroom.
- It's not a good time.

164
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,916
What I'm telling you is...

165
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,833
Is that I have a really bad stomach ache.

166
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,541
I need to go to the bathroom urgently.

167
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:18,916
What's wrong?

168
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,458
The museum is big.

169
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,375
And 60, 70 hostages
are difficult to control.

170
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,708
Those numbers could spark a rebellion.

171
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,208
No.

172
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,791
That would be suicide,
and under those circumstances,

173
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,555
what prevails
is the instinct to stay safe.

174
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:37,791
No.

175
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:39,208
Fear.

176
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,500
Fear and more fear
will allow them to make poor decisions,

177
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:46,000
like desperately attacking one of us
even if we're carrying M16s.

178
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,083
- What are you thinking?
- Infiltrate someone.

179
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:56,791
They wouldn't have any direct contact with
us except in case a rebellion breaks out.

180
00:09:56,875 --> 00:10:00,125
And if there aren't any problems,
they'll leave like the other hostages.

181
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,875
It‘s a job that even a smoking monkey
from Ringling Brothers could do.

182
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,208
Maybe even that Juanito guy could do it.

183
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,083
That's it.

184
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:36,666
Is that him?

185
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,208
- No.
- No.

186
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,916
- Well, that was his bus.
- Yeah.

187
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:45,625
- This isn't good. We're leaving.
- No, Professor. Maybe he got confused.

188
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:48,166
Sure.
Or maybe he got out at a different stop.

189
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,750
Or maybe he fell asleep,
and he's still on the bus.

190
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,250
Godfather.

191
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Jesus.

192
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:06,916
It's me.

193
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:09,625
Juanito?

194
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,125
Julia.

195
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,166
It's been a long time, no?

196
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,041
You look very beautiful, Julia.

197
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Well...

198
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:24,333
you were always handsome. Pretty.

199
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,125
Those eyes,

200
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,958
that mouth, that smile.

201
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,916
You're very beautiful, Julia.

202
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,458
Everything okay, Daniel?

203
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,208
You look freaked out.

204
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:46,708
No, I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.
I-I-I think it's really fucking great.

205
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,333
I mean, you know, everyone is free to do

206
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,458
whatever they want
and when they want it.

207
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,291
Well, then.

208
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:57,708
Well, it's just that I look in your eyes,
and you're still Juanito, but...

209
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,625
you're beautiful!

210
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,958
Come here. Give me a hug.

211
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,041
Okay.

212
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:09,500
Hey, does your father know?

213
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,166
'Cause I saw him a year ago,
and he said nothing.

214
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,583
My father's so supportive.

215
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,583
He always said he wanted a daughter,
so this worked out.

216
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,666
And who's this?

217
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,833
The boy with the plan, no?

218
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,166
The boy with the plan, yes.

219
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,458
And what are we doing for this heist?

220
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:37,000
Gandía's telling the truth. Palermo
helped him escape from his handcuffs.

221
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,476
- How do you know?
- I saw him gesturing to his thumb.

222
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,708
They were talking. Palermo kept going
over to him the entire day.

223
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,059
- You didn't say anything?
- Because I couldn't hear them,

224
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,166
and I didn't know he'd tell him
to break his finger.

225
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,041
Then move closer! That's why you're here.

226
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:52,750
No, no, no, no. I'm here to keep an eye
on the hostages, not on the gang.

227
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:57,875
Uh...

228
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,458
You hear so much shit in here.

229
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:01,958
- Yeah, I know.
- Hm.

230
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
How's Nairobi?

231
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:07,000
Well, she's still recovering
as best as she can.

232
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,125
And Tokyo was abducted. Two down.

233
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:13,208
Hmm. Things are starting
to get a little fucked up, no?

234
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,791
Julia.

235
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,375
What do you want?

236
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,541
I want you to let me go, give me a weapon,
and let me join the others

237
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,825
'cause my ass is constantly asleep
from sitting on it...

238
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,476
They have think you're a hostage
in case things get more fucked up.

239
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,142
- More? It's gonna get worse?
- Quit fucking around and sit back down.

240
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,375
Jesus! Even Matías has a gun.

241
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,517
It's bigger than him.
He doesn't know how to hold it.

242
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:33,301
No, no. Just listen to me.
Orders are orders.

243
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,375
What you have to do
is go back to your place.

244
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,000
And the orders are given by you
because you're in charge here.

245
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,750
- Me? What do you mean I'm in charge?
- Of course you're in charge!

246
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:41,666
Nairobi's been shot.

247
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,791
Tokyo's been taken. Palermo...
Well, nobody could ever trust Palermo.

248
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,875
Do the math, Dani. You're next.
You're in charge.

249
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,041
You're really starting to piss me off.

250
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,166
So start giving orders.

251
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,500
It's easy. Give me a gun,
a vest and all the gear you have.

252
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,583
And...

253
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,208
start calling me Manila
because I'm Manila, Dani.

254
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:03,250
No, you're not Manila
because you're still a hostage.

255
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:05,750
And don't call me Dani. My name is Denver.

256
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:06,833
We're gonna go.

257
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,125
And I'll tell you something else.

258
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,750
Don't stare at me that way
because people are starting to notice.

259
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:13,916
Stare at you?

260
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,791
I was sending you signals,
you fucking moron.

261
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:17,875
Stare at you!

262
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,833
Oh, fuck.
It feels like a fucking sauna.

263
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,333
Turn on the air-conditioning.

264
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,541
If I turn it on,
they'll know where we are.

265
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,500
- That would be a shame.
- It would.

266
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,291
We have so much to talk about.

267
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,250
Without the AC, there's not much oxygen,

268
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:44,416
so I suggest you ration your breathing.

269
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,291
Don't worry about me.

270
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:53,375
The people out there broke into
the vaults of the national reserve.

271
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:56,333
You think they won't find a way
into this bunker?

272
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:58,416
You're a dead man.

273
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,583
You're sweating.
May I open your jumpsuit?

274
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,625
We can't afford poor hygiene here.

275
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,208
Touch me and I'll rip your arm off,
motherfucker.

276
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:10,833
Oh, yeah?
What happened to that kid up there?

277
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,916
The one with the curly hair.

278
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,333
He's not making you horny?

279
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,708
Like an animal.

280
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,083
I really doubt that.

281
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,041
You're not into IT guys or kids.

282
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,666
I set up this heist for him.

283
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,791
What's the most
someone's ever done for you?

284
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,583
Give you a drill on Father's Day?

285
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,583
You're more into real men.

286
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,416
- Kinda like you?
- Mm-hmm. Like me.

287
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,333
That's right.

288
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,083
You've even stopped kicking me.

289
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,416
Because you've tied up my legs,
you fucking imbecile.

290
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,250
Well, whatever the reason,

291
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,791
the important thing is
you're much more receptive.

292
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,875
And you even painted your toes for me.

293
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,541
I love it.

294
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,916
<i>Is it true you helped Gandía escape?</i>

295
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,416
Yes, sir.

296
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,000
<i>And are you aware that he almost killed
Nairobi and Helsinki?</i>

297
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,125
- Collateral damage.
- Collateral damage?

298
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,208
- You are such a piece of shit.
- Relax.

299
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:13,916
Why did you do it, Palermo?

300
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,291
<i>Tokyo staged a </i>coup d'etát,<i> sir.</i>

301
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,750
I felt morally obligated...

302
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,958
to save the plan.

303
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,750
The plan is where my loyalty lies.
I had to restore the order

304
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,625
that was established because you never
relieved me in my position.

305
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,125
<i>As a matter of fact, I did.</i>

306
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,250
And that has absolutely nothing
to do with releasing Gandía.

307
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,208
<i>Of course, it does.</i>

308
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,500
I had to generate chaos.
It was obvious he would go after her.

309
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,541
He could kill her, you fuck up.

310
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,083
- I repeat, she stole my command from me.
- He's full of shit.

311
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,500
<i>He was gonna abandon ship
like a rat,</i>

312
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:47,666
- and he was taking the state secrets.
- The child is incorrect.

313
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,833
I stopped you at the door

314
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,458
<i>with the briefcase.</i>

315
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,458
You were gonna make a deal,
you fucker.

316
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,791
<i>I was?</i>

317
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,995
With the documents that I stole in my
briefcase? It's right there. Have a look.

318
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,791
Denver, open the briefcase.

319
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:06,708
What's inside?

320
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,166
Muffins.

321
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:16,011
I don't care what's in the briefcase.
It doesn't make any difference.

322
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,458
<i>You have betrayed the gang.</i>

323
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,250
You've put everyone in danger,

324
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,666
and it's your fault that Gandía has taken
my officer in command as his prisoner.

325
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,833
Listen. I'm going to give you...
one opportunity to redeem yourself.

326
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,708
<i>But I won't forget what you've done.</i>

327
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,333
And, you'll never have your command back.

328
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,583
Then I'll go back to the hostages.

329
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:39,666
What should I do?

330
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,166
First, you shut your mouth.

331
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,166
And no, don't go back to the hall.

332
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,083
Release him.

333
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,708
We have a murderer on the loose.
This is not the time to be divided.

334
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,833
When all this is over,
then we'll decide on a judgment.

335
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,125
<i>Now, listen to me carefully.</i>

336
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,583
<i>Gandía is a lone wolf.</i>

337
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,208
The most vulnerable place is the lobby,

338
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,091
so that's the first place
we have to evacuate.

339
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,541
Palermo, Stockholm, Helsinki,
gather the hostages together

340
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,458
<i>in the library. Gandía doesn't want
to escape. He wants to kill you.</i>

341
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,083
The door doesn't matter.

342
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,416
Don't wear your masks,
he could do the same

343
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,180
<i>and we wouldn't
be able to distinguish him.</i>

344
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,916
Bogotá, what's the situation
in the basement?

345
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,083
They've stopped the furnaces.
They're scared.

346
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,416
Bring Nairobi to safety in the library

347
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,740
<i>and go to the basement.
We have to keep melting the gold.</i>

348
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:54,541
Denver.

349
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,583
- Talk to me.
- <i>You and Rio take action.</i>

350
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,791
<i>Let the hunt begin.</i>

351
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:01,166
<i>You'll be more exposed,
so equip the appropriate tools.</i>

352
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,125
Helmets, ammunition, magazines.
Everything you might need.

353
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,458
Search every room on the first floor,
and when you've searched a room, seal it.

354
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,833
And the other floors?

355
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,476
<i>Split them with Helsinki and Stockholm.</i>

356
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,541
<i>They'll join after the hostages
are in the library.</i>

357
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:16,208
Everyone know what to do?

358
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,333
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

359
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,500
- Yeah.
- Yes.

360
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:20,833
One more thing.

361
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,250
Good luck.

362
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,583
- And be very careful.
- Let's go!

363
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,791
- How are you feeling, sweetheart?
- I'm okay.

364
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,791
I've got a real good nurse.

365
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,000
You like the big guy, huh?

366
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:52,208
We'll see.

367
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,625
Stay strong.

368
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,250
You too.

369
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,125
Whoo!

370
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,458
Holy shit!

371
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,750
That lady is so wasted, Helsinki!

372
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,125
You know what she said to me? She said,

373
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,208
"You've got yourself some piece of ass!"

374
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,250
She was talking about you.

375
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,916
- Everyone thinks we're married.
- It's better.

376
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,458
- We can go unnoticed.
- No, it's not better!

377
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:23,250
It's not better. This way neither of us
will get laid.

378
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,083
We don't need to get laid, Nairobi.

379
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,375
- <i>Salud!</i>
- Cheers.

380
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,291
It's fine for a day or two,
but if it goes on too long,

381
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,833
we might both grow our hymens back.

382
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,250
Truth is, me and you,
we make a great couple.

383
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,875
We're spectacular.

384
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,333
You and me...

385
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,125
family, and we'll be...

386
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:46,125
family forever.

387
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,250
You're damn right.

388
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,666
The things I've experienced with you
I've never experienced with anyone.

389
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,916
This, Helsi...

390
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,166
This is a love story.

391
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,708
Not just any love story,
but a perfect one.

392
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,583
No.

393
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,291
One day, you'll meet someone,

394
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,833
and that will be love.

395
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:11,916
But not this.

396
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:16,208
You have to be open and brave
because, believe me,

397
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:20,000
it takes much more courage
to be in love...

398
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,208
than it does for war.

399
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,291
And you...

400
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:26,708
you're courageous.

401
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:30,958
Put it on.

402
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,541
We're going to the basement.

403
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,166
We're going to the library.

404
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,250
Those are the orders.

405
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:43,541
Bogotá!

406
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:49,583
Don't fuck with me.

407
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,896
They're probably shitting themselves.

408
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,916
They won't last five minutes
against Gandía if they're that scared.

409
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:57,166
I need to talk to them.

410
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,541
How long since you ate?

411
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,208
Two days.

412
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,000
- Three.
- And since you slept?

413
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,583
I've probably slept two two-hour shifts
since I got here.

414
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:18,958
Do you wanna know anything else?

415
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,708
Before you eat,
I'm gonna disinfect that wound of yours.

416
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,541
Ssh. Quiet.

417
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,458
Your hair is stuck in it.

418
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,625
I hit you hard, huh?

419
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,500
- <i>Library is clear.</i>
- Copy that.

420
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,750
Everyone stand up
and make four lines, now!

421
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:12,666
My dear hostages...

422
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I'm back.

423
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:19,541
As you know, there's a wolf on the loose,
and you're the lambs,

424
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:22,416
so we're going to kindly escort you
to your stable.

425
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,583
Our escorts for today
will be my colleagues and shepherds,

426
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:27,083
Helsinki and Stockholm.

427
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,500
Let's go, quickly! Let's go!

428
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:31,708
Everyone, follow me. Now!

429
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,958
You stay here with me, sir.

430
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,291
You're the best shield
I have against Gandía.

431
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,208
Keep moving. Quicker.

432
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,875
<i>Here. This works miracles.</i>

433
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,875
<i>But isn't that too much?</i>

434
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,000
Amanda, right?

435
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,583
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?

436
00:23:58,166 --> 00:23:59,708
- Yeah, yeah.
- Are you sure?

437
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:01,958
Well...

438
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:03,833
I'm a little dizzy.

439
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:07,083
It's probably just those pills I got
from Mr. Roman.

440
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,500
Hey, there. How's it goin'?

441
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,000
Fine.

442
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,583
I-I'm Arturo.

443
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,291
- Arturo Roman.
- Mmm-hm.

444
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,250
You looked real tense earlier.

445
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:29,208
When you insisted
on going to the bathroom, I was worried.

446
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:32,416
I'm just nervous.
It's not easy being in here.

447
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,940
With these terrorists,
it's not going to be a day in the park.

448
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,208
Take it from experience.

449
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,916
I was a little bit anxious.
I'm good. Thank you.

450
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,208
We're all stuck, so we have
to stay together and help each other.

451
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:46,791
Trust me.

452
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:48,625
Yeah.

453
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:55,666
If you start feeling
a little anxious again,

454
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:58,916
I've got something to make you feel great.

455
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,500
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

456
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:01,583
What's that?

457
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:05,791
Some advice from a veteran. Ssh.

458
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:08,708
That's all the hostages.

459
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,750
We've brought you
to the library because,

460
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:14,375
as the old, well-known saying goes,
knowledge is power.

461
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:17,375
And in this case,
it might also save your lives.

462
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:20,625
<i>In Search of Lost Time,</i>
for example, by Marcel Proust.

463
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:22,541
Monumental. Beautiful novel.

464
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:24,291
I'm convinced

465
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:29,000
that whoever finds it
and presses it firmly against their chest

466
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:32,250
will be able to deflect the bullets
from an M16.

467
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:36,541
It's a joke.

468
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:37,791
I'm joking. Calm down.

469
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:40,833
We're going to be here for a few hours.

470
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,750
These are the rules of coexisting.

471
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,458
Number one...

472
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:48,291
Bogotá, Nairobi, where are you?

473
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:52,333
5:00 MINUTES EARLIER

474
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:56,125
Don't move!

475
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:58,041
Are you fucking idiots?

476
00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:59,250
Put your guns down.

477
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:12,541
Are you afraid?

478
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:13,625
Come on, man.

479
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:16,125
There's a lunatic armed to the teeth.

480
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:18,666
I'm afraid too, you know.

481
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:22,083
- Bogotá, are you afraid?
- Maybe the most.

482
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,625
Palermo, Helsinki and Stockholm
are scared too.

483
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:33,541
They're taking the hostages
to the library.

484
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:39,791
Denver and Rio are practically
shitting themselves upstairs.

485
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:44,041
Because they're looking for Gandía.

486
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:45,916
And Gandía...

487
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:49,791
Gandía is the most afraid, so he's
won't stop until he kills us all.

488
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:51,541
Kill us, my ass.

489
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:53,583
"My ass."

490
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,833
Everyone else is doing their jobs,

491
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:11,541
and we're over here...

492
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,583
scared shitless...

493
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:15,916
hiding behind a little trench.

494
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,708
- We didn't come here for a fucking war.
- I know, honey.

495
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,833
We don't have any other choice.

496
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:25,291
This is the easiest place to defend.

497
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:27,750
You can only get in from over there,

498
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:31,715
and if he does, we'll know, and any of us
can shoot the shit out of him.

499
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:34,916
But what would he see
if he came through that door now?

500
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:38,958
A squad of chickens
clucking and shitting in fear.

501
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:43,708
I don't recognize you
I don't recognize you.

502
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:47,875
All of you are workers.

503
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,208
You're welders.

504
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:53,750
The toughest guys
I've ever met in my fucking life.

505
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:54,958
My golden boys.

506
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:57,541
You're not fucking chickens.

507
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:03,125
You know what else
is a really scary thing?

508
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:07,041
Going home alone every night.

509
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:11,666
But you all continue doing it.

510
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:14,333
You grab fear by the hand,

511
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:16,458
and you keep on living.

512
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:19,916
Because we have to live!

513
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:21,583
Gentlemen!

514
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:24,041
We have to live until the finale!

515
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:32,333
Fuck! Look at this.

516
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:36,041
You brought me back from the dead
to bust all your balls?

517
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,333
What?

518
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:44,291
Aren't you going to give me a hug
or something?

519
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:52,333
- How are you?
- I don't even know.

520
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:54,000
I'm so full of drugs right now.

521
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,916
What happened to the music, Bogotá?

522
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,916
- Is work gonna be depressing from now on?
- The music? Of course.

523
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,416
Are we Latinos or Germans?

524
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,416
Nice motorcycle, boss. Is it a Harley?

525
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,666
Real funny. Tease me again
and you'll regret it, okay?

526
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,791
Bogotá, how many tons do we have?

527
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:09,208
Forty-three and a half.

528
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:11,416
We can do better!

529
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,916
I want the furnace on high

530
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,958
and two-hour shifts so we can
pick up the gold bars left.

531
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:17,833
You, get me a sample of the grains.

532
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:24,083
Let's see.

533
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:26,791
Ooh!

534
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:31,416
We have to turn up the gas pressure
by two kilopascals.

535
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:34,166
We've gone over the ideal diameter.

536
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,916
And I wanna see you working
just like before.

537
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,916
With rhythm. With passion.

538
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:47,125
Chickie boom, chickie boom, chickie boom!

539
00:29:55,958 --> 00:29:56,958
What's with you?

540
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:02,041
What about me?

541
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:04,083
Nothing.

542
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:07,038
I'll have to tell you again

543
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:08,923
that I wouldn't touch you
with a ten-foot pole.

544
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,041
Because when I said that, at least you...

545
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:14,125
paid some attention to me.

546
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:15,708
But now...

547
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:18,666
it's like I have typhus.

548
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,870
I don't wanna take advantage of you
while you're hurt.

549
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:27,208
Ah!

550
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:29,958
Yeah.

551
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:31,708
Okay, then.

552
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:34,291
We'll wait until I'm better,

553
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,041
until we get out of here,
and then we'll look for my father.

554
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:39,541
You'll ask him for my hand.

555
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:47,291
If you changed your mind... let me know.

556
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:54,166
[light romantic music playing[

557
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:14,208
You call that a fucking kiss?

558
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:20,166
Help me up.

559
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:43,333
Ow, ow, ow!

560
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:44,916
Hands down there.

561
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:46,833
Yeah.

562
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,000
Shit!

563
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:53,083
- Are you okay?
- Yes. You?

564
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:54,833
- Yeah.
<i>- Bogotá, Nairobi,</i>

565
00:31:54,916 --> 00:31:57,208
<i>- where are you?</i>
- Freight elevator. We're fine.

566
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:58,458
Where's Denver and Rio?

567
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:01,625
5:00 MINUTES EARLIER

568
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:07,833
- The library is clear.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

569
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:27,500
- That thing you said about the Maserati...
- What about it?

570
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:29,208
I wanna tell you something.

571
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:30,416
Right now?

572
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,500
What is it?

573
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:33,208
Tokyo might be a Maserati,

574
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:35,416
but I was always
just hanging off the back

575
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,208
like the cans on a wedding car.

576
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:38,500
Yeah, yeah.

577
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,125
Rio. Rio.

578
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
The office.

579
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:43,916
Go.

580
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,208
Are you into her?

581
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:06,958
- What the fuck are you saying?
- The Maserati. Fuck.

582
00:33:08,458 --> 00:33:11,208
If you're into her and you wanna take her
for a ride, be my guest.

583
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:13,458
Are you listening
to the shit coming out of your mouth?

584
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:21,000
First, she has to feel it.

585
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,000
She thinks and she decides.

586
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:28,125
The thing is,
she's pretty fucked from the breakup.

587
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:31,500
I'm gonna tell you something.
You're my friend,

588
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:33,476
- and I respect your girlfriend.
- Ex-girlfriend.

589
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,541
Who cares?

590
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:38,791
Ex or not, a friend's girlfriend is like
a radioactive city. Do you understand?

591
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:42,833
Even after 20,000 years, it's still
contaminated land and you don't enter it,

592
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:45,556
not even with the blessing of her ex
or your dick in a hazmat suit.

593
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:47,625
- That's fucking bullshit.
- No, it's ethics.

594
00:33:47,708 --> 00:33:49,416
It's ethics that should be sacred.

595
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:52,625
What were you doing
on the couch with Stockholm?

596
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,583
We just were talking.

597
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:57,166
Barefoot?

598
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:58,666
Come on, man.

599
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,916
What difference is it
that we were barefoot?

600
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,916
It makes a difference, Rio.

601
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,041
I wouldn't take my shoes off
and talk to Lisbon on a sofa.

602
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:07,250
It'd be weird as shit.

603
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:10,125
And I'd be uncomfortable.
Do you know why?

604
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:12,208
That's the territory of the Professor.

605
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:16,250
Look. It's your boyfriend.

606
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:17,333
Wanna say hi?

607
00:34:17,916 --> 00:34:19,416
Rio! Rio, right?

608
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:22,333
Rio! Denver!

609
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:24,625
Help me! I'm begging you!

610
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:26,416
I'm tied up in here!

611
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:31,250
Little friends from the gang,
please help me now!

612
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:41,375
The walls around you are made
of 70 centimeters of reinforced concrete.

613
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,958
It's like screaming on a submarine
in the middle of the sea.

614
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:55,291
The third card...

615
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,583
I spill blood.

616
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:02,750
I'm heading out for a bit.

617
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:17,291
I was telling her about my
post-traumatic stress, moron.

618
00:35:17,708 --> 00:35:19,875
- Shh.
- I wasn't stealing your girlfriend.

619
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:22,125
Talking to her just calms me down.

620
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:24,791
- You calm down when you talk to Stockholm?
- Yeah.

621
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:28,333
She's intelligent, sympathetic.
She listens.

622
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:31,208
She's kind.
You could talk to her about anything.

623
00:35:31,625 --> 00:35:33,333
You could talk to me too,

624
00:35:33,416 --> 00:35:35,496
but you don't
because you're thinking with your dick!

625
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:46,291
I haven't been able to sleep for shit.

626
00:35:47,583 --> 00:35:50,458
When I close my eyes,
I have nightmares, anxiety attacks,

627
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:52,166
tachycardia, sweating, man.

628
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:56,833
I was only able to sleep
if I knew she was next to me.

629
00:35:58,083 --> 00:35:59,583
Do you understand what I mean?

630
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:04,500
You're telling me you slept with her
to my face.

631
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:07,291
I didn't sleep with her, Denver.

632
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,458
She was keeping me company, okay?

633
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:17,375
Are you my fucking friend or not?

634
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:22,541
- Yes, I'm your friend.
- It doesn't sound like it, Rio.

635
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:28,625
Motherfucker!

636
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:29,708
No, no, no, no!

637
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:30,791
Your helmet!

638
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:32,458
Now your vest!

639
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:34,041
We've gotta push down on the grenade!

640
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:37,375
Come on, Denver! With me!

641
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:47,142
- Bogotá, Nairobi, where are you?
<i>- The freight elevator.</i>

642
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:49,291
We're fine. Where's Denver and Rio?

643
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:50,875
Denver, Rio.

644
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:53,916
- Denver, Rio!
- I'll do it. I'll go.

645
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,166
No. You stay here with the hostages.

646
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,666
Come on, Helsinki. Let's go.

647
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:12,333
Careful. That son of a bitch
is around here.

648
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,791
Bogotá, the explosion was in the elevator
on the first floor.

649
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:28,958
Copy that.

650
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,500
He could be close.

651
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:32,708
We're gonna stay here.

652
00:37:35,416 --> 00:37:36,416
Come on, fatty.

653
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:55,541
It's okay. We're here.

654
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,750
We've got you!

655
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:00,875
- Come on. Get up!
- Denver...

656
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:02,666
Are you okay?

657
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:05,333
Let me take a look.
Are you okay?

658
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:09,458
Okay?

659
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:12,083
Are you okay?

660
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,416
Get down!

661
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,250
Fire back, Helsinki!

662
00:38:24,291 --> 00:38:25,625
Fucking Gandía there!

663
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:30,500
Motherfucker!

664
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:35,750
We're cornered.

665
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:38,375
<i>First floor elevator. We need backup now!</i>

666
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:40,541
Go.

667
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:45,833
Go. Go.

668
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:43,250
Looks like third time's the charm, mutt.
