1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,274
Previously on "Crisis
on Infinite Earths”...

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,632
There's a wave of
antimatter sweeping

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,029
across this universe,

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,913
destroying
everything in its path.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,237
He fought to his last breath

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,955
knowing every moment
was another life saved.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,952
Dig, we are working
on bringing him back

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,997
the same way that he
brought me back, remember?

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,434
You're talking about
a trip to Purgatory?

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,432
- “Yes.
- Fine. Count me in.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,159
I need you to come back to us.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,152
You're my brother.
Can't lose you, man.

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,390
Oliver Queen.

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,593
“Who are you? -Jim Corrigan,

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,200
but I'm also a Spectre.

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,075
It's your turn now.

17
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,117
Only you can light
the spark, Oliver.

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,196
Itis your destiny.

19
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,275
What's happening?

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,435
Iris!

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,830
Where are we?

22
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,754
This is the vanishing point.

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,873
It's a point outside
of time and space.

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,592
- Something's wrong.
- No. Hey, hey.

25
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,715
What did you do?

26
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,356
Well, I held The
Book of Destiny,

27
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,117
and I thought destiny
could use a little rewrite.

28
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,356
What do we do now?

29
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,350
Are we ready?

30
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,351
Just about.

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,715
You better suit up.

32
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,670
Ilove you.

33
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,634
I'love you.

34
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,429
Okay. This will be
temporal jump trial one.

35
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,159
All systems nominal.

36
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,829
+l look ridiculous.

37
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,793
Is this really the height of
fashion at the dawn of time?

38
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,992
The suit provides
a shield against...

39
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,355
the coronal radiation...

40
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,318
my body will be-- yes, yes, yes.

41
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,710
«I'm familiar with the jingle,

42
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,240
but you couldn't have
designed something

43
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,710
a tad less...bulky?

44
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,591
Remind me again,
why did I marry you?

45
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,355
You have a thing for
men of towering ambition.

46
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,437
Are you seeing this
quantum flux cascade?

47
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,069
I am just a time
traveler here, my love.

48
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,159
You are the Monitor.

49
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,279
Engaging quantum portal.

50
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,869
Field is stabilizing.

51
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,473
The portal is engaging.

52
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,594
Next stop... the dawn of time.

53
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,394
I'am in the temporal zone.

54
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,711
Oh, 1 wish you
could see this, Xneen.

55
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,789
The birthplace of all creation.

56
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,109
It is beautiful.

57
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,516
Mar, I'm getting readings
here I don't understand.

58
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,432
Your presence has
corrupted the zone somehow.

59
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,274
It's...it's releasing radiation
I've never seen before.

60
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,432
/ think-- 1 think this
might be anti-matter.

61
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,069
You have to get out of there.

62
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,039
Get out of there right now!

63
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,356
Xneen...Xneen, can you hear me?

64
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,914
Something went wrong.

65
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,117
1 do not think this
is the dawn of time.

66
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,154
No, itis.

67
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,035
It just isn't the dawn
of time of our universe.

68
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,631
What?

69
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,311
You breached the wall
between our universe

70
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,550
and its opposite.

71
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,759
An anti-universe?

72
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,673
Your body was suffused
with coronal radiation.

73
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,519
The suit couldn't contain it.

74
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,113
Mar? Mar, can you hear me?

75
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,279
I'm sorry, my love.

76
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,711
My towering ambition...

77
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,719
has doomed us all.

78
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,150
Dear Amanda,

79
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,474
so...you're dead

80
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,319
along with, well, everyone,

81
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,591
everyone who's ever
lived in any reality ever,

82
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,279
{electricity zapping]

83
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,432
and me, I'm supposed
to be a Paragon,

84
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,437
one of seven people
who are supposed to be

85
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,632
the multiverse's
last, best chance.

86
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,235
I don't see it.

87
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,595
The so-called
Paragon of Destiny,

88
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,515
she doesn't even believe
in tomorrow anymore.

89
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,476
The Paragon of
Courage spends every day

90
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,994
working herself to the bone,

91
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,194
training for a fight
that will never come.

92
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,919
The Paragon of
Honor just meditates

93
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,114
for hours on end.

94
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,469
The Paragon of Hope

95
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,275
has lost hers...

96
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,910
and me, I spend my
days trying to repurpose

97
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,593
the broken
technology of this place

98
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,591
to find us a way out.

99
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,875
Careful, careful.

100
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,277
Narcissist, sociopath,
evil genius--

101
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,592
there are a lot of ways
to describe Lex Luthor.

102
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,400
Agh! Idiot!

103
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,279
Why couldn't I be trapped
at the edge of eternity

104
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,750
with someone possessing
more than 200 IQ points?

105
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,192
But I find "douchebag"
to be the most descriptive.

106
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,033
As for Barry Allen,
aka the Flash,

107
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,512
aka the Paragon of
Love, he's just gone.

108
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,951
Missing.

109
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,911
What, you guys
building modern art now?

110
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,878
Hey, team. We're repurposing

111
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,758
leftover time masters tech.

112
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,638
Mr. Luthor and I
think we've retrofitted it

113
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,949
into a teleportation device.

114
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,720
To teleport us to where exactly?

115
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,553
Kate makes a good point.

116
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,872
There is no...there
out there anymore.

117
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,634
So we send somebody to test it.

118
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,113
- Hl go.
- No.

119
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,272
We've lost too many
good people already.

120
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,279
Thanks for volunteering, Lex.

121
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,629
Well, that's very cold.

122
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,234
Is it because I killed your
parallel reality cousin?

123
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,671
Start it up.

124
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,792
If this works...

125
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,549
We get out of here,

126
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,473
we defeat the Anti-Monitor,

127
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,600
and we find a way to get
all the people we lost back.

128
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,955
Perhaps it was too
much to hope for.

129
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,838
Is there some way
you can get it to work?

130
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,879
It was a longshot to begin with.

131
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,871
Watch out!

132
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,913
Barry! Ugh!

133
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,273
Where am 1? Where am 1?

134
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,991
The Vanishing Point.

135
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,389
You've been gone for months.

136
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,994
What are you--what
are you talking about?

137
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,594
1 just left two seconds ago.

138
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,191
To go where?

139
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,277
To the speed force. I didn't--

140
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,400
I couldn't--it was like--

141
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,998
it was like running into
a mountain at mach 10.

142
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,792
I couldn't--

143
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,069
there's no way out of here.

144
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,950
What did you see?

145
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,476
Everything.

146
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,233
I see everything now.

147
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,311
Then you're ready.

148
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,831
Why would you make
me relive all that?

149
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,752
Every fight, every
punch you've thrown,

150
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,274
every kick you've landed,

151
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,590
every arrow you've fired,
they have all led you here

152
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,679
to this moment,
to the ultimate fight.

153
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,556
Who am I fighting?

154
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,597
Not who.

155
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,677
What.

156
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,110
The Anti-Monitor.

157
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,079
The Monitor's adversary.

158
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,429
Not just adversary.

159
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,273
A being who stands against
all there ever was or will be,

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,640
the apocalypse itself
given life and form

161
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,109
and terrible purpose.

162
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,555
How do I beat him?

163
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,357
With help.

164
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,474
It's time to get your friends.

165
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,671
Barry, wait. You look
spent. You need to rest.

166
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,996
No. I'm fine. I
have to try again.

167
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,033
Hey, Barry, that's
a bad idea, okay?

168
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,235
The effort alone could kill you.

169
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,834
It's better than
just staying here.

170
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,115
We're not gonna
let you kill yourself.

171
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,076
Get out of my way!

172
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,909
- Barry!
- We're not letting you

173
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,070
go anywhere.

174
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,880
-So try and stop me!
-In the condition you're in, Barry,

175
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,917
-it's not gonna be
that hard. «Cut it out!

176
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,398
Whatever's going to happen is not
going to include us turning on each other.

177
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,080
M-maybe you're right.
Maybe the speed force

178
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,793
is our last, best hope.

179
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,791
ltis.

180
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,790
The speed force is
the key to saving you.

181
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,272
It's the key to saving everyone.

182
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,709
Oliver?

183
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,470
Yes and no.

184
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,275
It's complicated.

185
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,875
Nice outfit.

186
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,555
Very...Sith.

187
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,915
Oliver?

188
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,833
I am Oliver Queen,

189
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,119
but I'm also something more.

190
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,271
More what?

191
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,999
Some might call me a ghost,

192
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,030
a Spectre...

193
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,197
that's in tune with
the entire multiverse.

194
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,589
So there's still a
multiverse out there?

195
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,034
No. It's gone,

196
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,759
replaced with its antithesis.

197
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,395
An anti-matter universe.

198
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,233
Which we need to
prevent from happening.

199
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,440
Right now, the Anti-Monitor

200
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,874
is at the dawn of time,

201
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,753
fighting to make permanent
his destruction of worlds.

202
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,155
Then we go there,
and we end him.

203
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,038
He's extremely powerful.

204
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,112
The eight of us
might not be enough.

205
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,880
We need a backup plan.

206
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,439
You have our attention.

207
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,479
Several millennia ago
on a planet named Maltus,

208
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,714
Mar Novu attempted to travel
to the birth of the universe

209
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,794
but instead...opened a breach
to the anti-matter universe.

210
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,679
So the Monitor gave
us the Anti-Monitor.

211
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,751
Correct. So while some of us

212
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,513
fight at the dawn of time,

213
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,754
others must go to Maltus.

214
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,997
And prevent Novu from
freeing his doppelganger?

215
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,156
I'm in.

216
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,231
Travel to an alien world? So in.

217
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,071
Same.

218
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,832
Come on. You know
you don't want to risk

219
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,037
letting me out of your
sight for even a millisecond.

220
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,199
We can get to both
through the speed force,

221
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,271
but I can't get into the
speed force right now.

222
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,397
It's probably because
there's no multiverse left,

223
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,919
but you said you're in
tune with the multiverse.

224
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,514
Does that include
the speed force?

225
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,831
What you're asking me
is very dangerous, Barry.

226
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,070
But possible.

227
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,311
You could give me
the energy boost I need.

228
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,916
Please.

229
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,918
We have to do this.
Everyone's lives depend on it.

230
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,752
I've unlocked your
potential, Barry.

231
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,035
By touching my head?

232
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,032
Use this power with caution.

233
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,830
Do you trust me?

234
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,634
Are you Oliver Queen?

235
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,951
Yes.

236
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,236
Then I trust you with
every cell of my body.

237
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,355
Good. Now run, Barry.

238
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,631
Run.

239
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,915
Okay.

240
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,834
Thanks for the kind assist.

241
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,680
Why doesn't this alien
forest look more alien?

242
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,832
Let's focus. Mar Novu
could be anywhere,

243
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,800
and it's not like we can just
do an internet search for him.

244
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,110
Well, actually, maybe we can.

245
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,118
Look at that.

246
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,869
Any city that large has
to be a bureaucracy.

247
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,356
And?

248
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,116
Well, bureaucracies
require some form

249
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,554
of central data
bank to function.

250
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,990
We find that, we find Novu.

251
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,349
That's actually not
a bad idea. Lex--

252
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,393
Where's Lex?

253
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,953
Sorry I'm late,

254
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,679
but actually my train was late.

255
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,751
Well, the second one.
The first one { did miss,

256
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,479
but that was my
cab driver's fault.

257
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,110
I've got this great traffic
app, and he thought that...

258
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,033
Queen consolidated?

259
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,910
Not exactly.

260
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,474
You're in the
speed force, Barry.

261
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,919
What happened
to you? You're not...

262
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,719
spectrey anymore.

263
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,556
Oh. Well, I'm lost.

264
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,751
I'm out there somewhere
in the speed force, too.

265
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,876
Right. The
Anti-Monitor attacked.

266
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,397
We were separated,
and I am utilizing

267
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,916
various pieces of my essence

268
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,594
to keep me, Sara,
J'onn, and Kate together.

269
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,994
That's why I'm here. This is--

270
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,280
this is where we first met.

271
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,000
There are few things more
powerful in the universe

272
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,037
than memory and connection.

273
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,114
I am using our
memories of our friends

274
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,554
and closest allies

275
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,549
to keep all of us from
falling out of the speed force.

276
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,514
Wait. What happens
if they fall out?

277
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,358
We'll be consumed
by anti-matter.

278
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,437
I can buy you time, Barry,

279
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,520
but...you need to
get to each of us.

280
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,279
I mean, the speed
force is infinite.

281
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,914
I could never know
where to begin to look.

282
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,230
Remember, Barry,
memories and connections.

283
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,954
You need to consider
our greatest victories,

284
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,393
our most crushing defeats,

285
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,472
the moments when the
bonds between us were forged.

286
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,394
When the bonds were forged.

287
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,151
Now do this, Barry.

288
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,394
Because you have to.

289
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,955
What the--?

290
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,997
Um, hello?

291
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,359
What the hell is this?

292
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,033
I'm asking myself the
same question. literally.

293
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,600
No. This--this
can't be happening.

294
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,717
This--you--what
are you doing here?

295
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,634
Well, I'll tell you
that when you tell me

296
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,714
where...here...is.

297
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,950
Is this cosplay? Oh, do
you want a selfie, bro?

298
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,071
+'m sorry.
-No, no. We're not--no.

299
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,392
I'm also the Flash.

300
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,311
You're also the what?

301
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,394
-The Flash? ~The Flash?

302
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,560
~The Flash. -It's complicated.

303
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,038
+l like your outfit. It seems...comfy.
-l was thinking yours is pretty cool.

304
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,713
-Smooth.
-Seems safe and...

305
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,676
it's breathable.

306
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,710
I'm Barry Allen.

307
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,559
-No! What?

308
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,438
What does that
mean? How can this--

309
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,999
This should be impossible now.

310
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,116
Should be impossible now?

311
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,758
You don't know about the--

312
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,796
Oh, my God. Don't do this to me.

313
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,870
I don't know about the what?

314
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,753
- Are you okay? Oh, my God.

315
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,594
1 told Victor this was possible.

316
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,510
What does this mean?

317
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,630
What do you think you're doing?

318
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,915
What you should
have done the moment

319
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,275
Fleet Feet dropped us off here-

320
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,234
checked out the lay of the land,

321
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,000
looked for hidden dangers.

322
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,714
We are on an alien world.

323
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,394
Any number of chest busters or
predators could be lying in wait.

324
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,914
Don't you capes
ever watch a movie?

325
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,832
You know what? Whatever
it is you're planning,

326
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,559
I'm gonna figure it out, and...

327
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,434
I'm gonna stop you.

328
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,031
I doubt that.

329
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,074
In a contest of mind over
muscle, mind wins every time,

330
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,715
but here.

331
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,990
Let me make it easy for you.

332
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,353
Ask me what I'm up to.

333
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:32,837
Go ahead.

334
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,554
All right, What
are you up to, Lex?

335
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,673
Universal domination, of course.

336
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,119
Oh, I probably should
have mentioned

337
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,679
that I gave myself
a few upgrades

338
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,070
when I checked The Book
of Destiny out of the library.

339
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,476
What are you doing?

340
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,960
God, I am so tired of
answering that question.

341
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,791
Moving on.

342
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,158
Yeah. The Black Canary.

343
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,189
She tried to shut me up,
but it's not gonna work.

344
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,839
I didn't kill those people.

345
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,038
Yes, I know. Felicity told me.

346
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,952
An impersonator, right?

347
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,190
Hate when that happens.

348
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,558
Five years on a deserted island.

349
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,753
That kind of thing really
changes you, doesn't it?

350
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,796
Must have been
difficult if not impossible

351
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,110
to hold on to your
sanity all those years,

352
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,071
and here you are,

353
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,589
pretending you have
everything in control.

354
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,952
Felicity told you the truth,

355
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,799
and you should
trust her judgment.

356
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,830
How can I do that?

357
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,553
Her perception of
you is clearly clouded

358
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,876
by her emotional attachment.

359
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,360
She's not seeing you
for what you really are.

360
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,717
You have no idea what
this city is up against.

361
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,634
Actually, I think I do,

362
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,834
and I'm gonna stop him.

363
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,350
Who are you?

364
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,999
I want to limit your
involvement in this.

365
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,316
Why? Because I'm an alien?

366
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,398
I also happen to be
your biggest weapon.

367
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,597
You're an unknown quantity,
and this isn't personal.

368
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,478
Except that's
exactly how this feels.

369
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,394
When I--when I
started living this life,

370
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,597
Iwas going up against
human threats alone,

371
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,631
and I could handle that.

372
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,751
Then there were metahumans,

373
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,910
and I could handle that.

374
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,192
I just discovered that
there are multiple Earths,

375
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,510
and I was brainwashed
aboard an alien spacecraft.

376
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,869
I'm sure that was unnerving.

377
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,350
I don't get unnerved. When I
go up against something new,

378
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,516
I push back.

379
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,592
Right or wrong, it's who I am,

380
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,717
and it's what I do,
so I am asking you

381
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,240
for just a little bit of space

382
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,398
so that I can draw
a line somewhere,

383
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,476
so that I can claw back just
a small sense of normalcy.

384
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,200
I'm afraid we're
well past normal.

385
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,752
J'onn, what are you doing here?

386
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,595
That...is a very long story.

387
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,756
Supergirl?!

388
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,310
Supergirl, please wake up.

389
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,915
Hey. Ryan?

390
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,795
Yeah. I think Lex
pulled a Luthor on us.

391
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,590
On the bright side,

392
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,076
I've never been knocked
unconscious on an alien planet before.

393
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,510
It's pretty much the same as
being knocked unconscious on Earth.

394
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,510
No broken bones. You'll be fine.

395
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,791
Thanks. This definitely makes
me question again why I'm here.

396
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,993
I' haven't got special powers

397
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,117
or, you know, powers.

398
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,631
I'm pretty much the dictionary
definition of unspecial,

399
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,276
and I definitely don't feel
like I'm a Paragon of anything,

400
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,760
let alone Humanity.

401
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,996
Hey--wait.

402
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,672
Are you sure you
guys got the right guy?

403
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,833
You left your family
because someone

404
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,071
you never even met told
you you were needed.

405
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,079
I'd say that makes
you pretty special.

406
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,476
1 don't know about hope,

407
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,557
but you're definitely the
Paragon of Pep Talks.

408
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,553
Years of practice. We
need to catch up to Lex.

409
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,716
How do you know
where he's headed?

410
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,200
Well, before he knocked me out,

411
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,795
he said was looking for
universal domination, so...

412
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,798
Hardly sounds like a newsflash.

413
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,514
The universal part is
new, but if know him,

414
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,240
he's looking to mess
with Novu's experiment,

415
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,550
change history to his advantage.

416
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,111
He really is a selfish
asshat, isn't he?

417
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,634
You really have no idea.

418
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,831
What are you doing?

419
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm guessing you haven't
flown on an alien planet either.

420
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,513
I've never flown. No,
but it's okay, Dr. Choi.

421
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,556
You don't have to be nervous.

422
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,838
It's just up, up, and away.

423
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,676
It's over, Deegan!

424
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,309
No. I decide when
the story ends!

425
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,354
Come on, Oliver. Where are you?

426
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,111
Agh!

427
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,235
I wasn't here for this.

428
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,910
Told you you'd catch me.

429
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,630
Thanks for the save.

430
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,439
With a magic arrow, no less.

431
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,193
It's a gift from the Monitor.

432
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,639
- Barry? Hey.

433
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,116
Did you go out shopping
for a new costume

434
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,032
while you were supposed
to be out saving the world?

435
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,191
What? Uh, no. No.

436
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,919
l-it's a crazy, long
story, and you wouldn't

437
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,036
believe me if I told you.

438
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,269
Can I talk to you for a minute?

439
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,678
Please. Excuse us.

440
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,875
Are you okay?

441
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,833
What I'm about to tell you
isn't gonna make any sense,

442
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,153
but...you're not really
h-here right now.

443
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,118
You're actually--
-In the speed force.

444
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,634
I remember. I...

445
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,875
I remember everything.

446
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,510
Okay. Well, in that case...

447
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,673
that arrow... from the Monitor,

448
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,511
1 always felt like
there was something

449
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,670
you weren't telling me.

450
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,997
I didn't want to burden
you with the choice I made.

451
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,035
The choice to do what?

452
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,035
You and Kara, Barry,

453
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,520
you were fated to die
trying to save the world.

454
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,194
Right before you died,

455
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,358
you said you'd given up
everything for me and Kara.

456
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,673
You made some
kind of devil's bargain

457
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,319
with the Monitor to
save us, didn't you?

458
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,039
No. It wasn't a
devil's bargain, Barry,

459
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,191
and I'd make it
again in a second.

460
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,192
It cost you your family, Oliver.

461
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,110
Cost you your life.

462
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,269
Dying's the easy part.

463
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,749
The dead are at peace,

464
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,399
but the real heroes are the ones

465
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,153
who have to keep going.

466
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,670
Go find the others.

467
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,110
Laurel.

468
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,556
Laurel, it's time. It's
time to put her to rest.

469
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,956
What am I supposed
to tell my parents?

470
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,876
My father, he--
he has a bad heart.

471
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,519
He won't live through this.

472
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,150
It should have been me.

473
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,434
She was the true hero.

474
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,232
A hero sets an
example, Laurel...

475
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,715
so follow hers.

476
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,670
Wear the mask.

477
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,315
Be the Canary.

478
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,478
That's how you
keep your sister alive.

479
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,269
Oh, boy.

480
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,479
Engaging quantum portal.

481
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,670
I wouldn't do that.

482
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,516
Xneen?

483
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,195
No.

484
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,357
No, obviously.

485
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,438
Hi. Lex Luthor.

486
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,629
I'm here to make you an
offer won't let you refuse.

487
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,835
How did you get in here?

488
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,591
Our security
protocols are-- A joke,

489
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,713
but the fact that I was able to
circumvent them with astonishing ease

490
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,632
is exactly why you
need to listen to me.

491
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,357
-Xneen?
-Is taking a little nappy time.

492
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,430
Not to worry.

493
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,918
So you are a scientist.

494
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,350
Tell me you're not intrigued
by what I have to say,

495
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,839
or do you get regular visits from
humans with future knowledge?

496
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,671
Speak.

497
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,959
The experiment you're conducting

498
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,760
will not only destroy you

499
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,151
but your planet and your wife.

500
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,400
Another ancient
zealot. lam so sick--

501
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,311
Don't know who they are.

502
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,550
I'm not even from this universe.

503
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,233
What I am from is the future,

504
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,439
so I know exactly how your little
time-jumping experiment will go wrong,

505
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,391
and I am willing to share
my future knowledge with you.

506
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,356
And in return?

507
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,475
Well, I don't cotton to aliens,

508
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,076
but you will soon
have certain abilities

509
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,597
that I will need in
order to deal with some,

510
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,078
shall we say, super problems

511
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,834
popping up in my world.

512
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,758
Ido not have any...abilities.

513
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,875
Stick with me, kid.

514
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,360
So what do you say? Team up?

515
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,120
The brave and the bald?

516
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,756
Who are you?

517
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,035
Hey. Um, this is awkward.

518
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,559
Long story short, you
guys aren't really you guys,

519
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,350
and none of this is
really actually happening.

520
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,438
What are you talk--hey! Hey!

521
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,635
Don't you touch her!

522
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,557
I'm so sorry.

523
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,710
It's a miracle.

524
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,235
Barry? Hey.

525
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,756
‘What's happening? t's
a long, very weird story.

526
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,070
I'll catch you up on the way.
-On the way to where?

527
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,275
You're not taking her anywhere.

528
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,470
I'm sorry. Like I said,

529
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,951
you guys aren't really here.

530
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,954
The speed force?

531
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,394
I can only assume.

532
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,270
We were moving through the
speed force when we were attacked.

533
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,875
Uh, by someone
called... The Anti-Monitor.

534
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,758
Doesn't even sound
like an actual name.

535
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,354
We're all trying to stop him.

536
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,075
We're working together.

537
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,955
The two of you... work together.

538
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,079
I know you don't
trust each other.

539
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,955
Right now, I know you
don't even like each other,

540
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,549
but all that changes.

541
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,269
In fact, we all come to
depend on each other.

542
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,191
We all come to trust each other.

543
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,278
Why are you telling us this now?

544
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,436
This seems to be
a pattern with you.

545
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,313
You don't trust people.
They don't trust you.

546
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,199
Then all of that changes,

547
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,431
and the bond between
you is stronger than iron.

548
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,757
I'm sorry. What's your point?

549
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,830
It's maybe something
I can learn from.

550
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,879
So basically, you
tore a little hole

551
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,394
in the space-time continuum,

552
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,115
opened a doorway into something
called the anti-matter universe.

553
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,836
Matter and anti-matter
cannot coexist.

554
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,554
Hence a lot of bad stuff
happening that we would

555
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,949
just as soon not have happen,

556
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,473
so I think what we need to do is
adjust the Ronstrom coefficient.

557
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,279
Lex, we need to talk.

558
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,118
Mar Novu, do not trust
this man with anything!

559
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,350
Give him a knife for his food,

560
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,079
and no matter how much
he thanks you for the dinner,

561
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,639
he'll stab you right
in the back with it.

562
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,439
Or the front. I'm not choosy.

563
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,113
Last time, you
caught me by surprise.

564
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,595
That's not gonna happen again.

565
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,950
Get Novu outta here.

566
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,879
Come with me, sir, please.

567
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,075
Xneen!

568
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,710
Okay. Listen to me.

569
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,349
Whatever you do, you
can't open that portal.

570
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,159
The hairless one warned me.

571
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,511
No. This isn't a
warning kind of situation.

572
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,752
This is a don't do it at
any...cost kind of situation.

573
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,955
It is my life's work.

574
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,156
Trillions of other
people's lives,

575
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,038
an infinite number,

576
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,271
will be lost if you
go through with it.

577
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,550
It's not worth it.

578
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,472
You just show up
here as if by magic

579
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,269
and demand belief.

580
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,910
The fact I'm here at all should
be enough to convince you.

581
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,550
You are a remarkable individual.

582
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,671
Funny. A new friend of
mine just told me I'm special.

583
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,512
1 didn't believe her until now.

584
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,437
I wonder, is it a double-cross

585
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,511
if I never trusted
you in the first place?

586
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,832
Why do you Kryptonians always
have to take things so personally?

587
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,269
You tried to kill my cousin,

588
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,115
you tried to kill me,
you betrayed Lena,

589
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,874
left her with nothing but a
ruined name and a broken heart.

590
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,712
All I did was
tell her the truth,

591
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,991
something you never
had the courage to do.

592
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,239
Don't take it personally.

593
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,438
Hey! If you would stop
trying to kill each other.

594
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,230
1 got through to Novu.

595
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,117
You just ruined a
perfectly good bad guy plan,

596
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,310
you know that, new guy?

597
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,277
{wind howling]

598
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,996
Where are we?

599
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,480
The anti-matter universe.

600
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,069
At the dawn of time.

601
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,674
We arrived, and he
was already here--

602
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,235
the Anti-Monitor.

603
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,234
That's impossible. 1 got
through to him. I know I did.

604
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,472
Some fates are inescapable.

605
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,191
You spoke to one man
across countless universes,

606
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,916
but within the tapestry
of the multiverse,

607
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,515
there will always
be one Mar Novu

608
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,149
who cannot turn from
his towering ambition,

609
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,435
and in that inevitability,
there is destiny.

610
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,999
Welcome to mine!

611
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,236
All of you,

612
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,116
listen to me.

613
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,794
This is why you were
selected. You're Paragons.

614
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,997
Yeah. I'm still a little unclear
on what all that means.

615
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,594
It means you're powerful enough

616
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,034
to hold the line,

617
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,473
to buy us the time we need.

618
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,357
To do what?

619
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,679
Rebirth the universe.

620
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,994
What, like, a do-over?

621
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,709
The dawn of time is the
only place it can happen.

622
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,389
I'l light the spark,
you fan the flame.

623
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,516
And how do we do that?

624
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,079
You'll know when it's time.

625
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,470
Why do you cosmic types
always have to be so obtuse?

626
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,914
If 1 knew, I'd tell you.

627
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,151
I don't.

628
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,394
All I have is trust.

629
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,435
Do you trust me?

630
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,279
With every cell in my body.

631
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,669
Let's do this.

632
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,434
Die, you creepy shadow things!

633
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,030
That's for Oliver!

634
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,634
Idiots! If anyone's gonna
take over the universe,

635
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,869
it's gonna be me!

636
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,519
ltis too late.

637
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,072
After 10,000 years,
I shall be victorious.

638
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,555
No, you won't be.

639
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,554
Such confidence.

640
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,995
You believe Corrigan
prepared you for this fight.

641
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,919
I believe my entire life
prepared me for this fight.

642
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,634
All life ends.

643
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,397
Only death is eternal.

644
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,829
Only I am eternal.

645
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,389
We'll see about that.

646
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,350
Is this typical for you
guys, saving the world?

647
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,351
Yes!

648
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,075
No!

649
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,351
My team and I
usually mess things up

650
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,430
for the better!

651
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,720
Focus! We're in the
fight of our lives here.

652
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,189
You have failed...

653
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,075
this universe!

654
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,074
We--we did it.

655
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,393
So this is what being
a hero feels like.

656
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,750
Interesting.

657
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,876
Where's Oliver?

658
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,791
There!

659
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,676
Oliver.

660
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,990
What is that?

661
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,194
"I'll light the spark"...

662
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,512
"While you fan the flame."

663
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,754
He said you would
know what to do.

664
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,479
I think dying kind of
messed with his head.

665
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,994
Well, think. You're
meant to be the genius.

666
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,480
A genius who's had the fortitude

667
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,950
to read The Book of
Destiny and retain his sanity.

668
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,713
I think the jury's
still out on that one.

669
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,229
The Book of Destiny.

670
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,196
I made myself the
Paragon of Truth.

671
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,434
What if truth can tell
us what we need to do?

672
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,636
Being what?

673
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,631
Use what's left of the book

674
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,074
to fan the flame.

675
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,634
How do we all use the book?

676
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,469
We focus.

677
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,714
A singular, laser-like focus.

678
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:24,991
On what?

679
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,230
Humanity,

680
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,795
truth,

681
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,396
love,

682
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,395
destiny,

683
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,271
honor,

684
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,555
courage...

685
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,476
and hope.

686
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,630
No!

687
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,754
No!

688
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,676
Oh, my God!

689
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,909
Oliver! Barry, get us there.

690
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,157
Oliver.

691
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,836
I need both of you to
watch over my family.

692
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,434
Hey, Ollie. They're
gonna be fine, all right?

693
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,715
You're gonna be fine.

694
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,190
You did it.

695
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,991
You all did-- you all did it.

696
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,795
Did what? What did we do?

697
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,515
Just look.

698
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,669
Ollie, we saw, but what is it?

699
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,273
It's the new universe.

700
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,797
It's kind of small
for a universe.

701
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,229
Wait for it, Barry.

702
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,510
It's almost time, almost time.

703
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,960
There. You did it.

704
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,236
No, Ollie, you did it, okay,

705
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,073
and that's why you got
to come back with us,

706
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,753
s0 we need you to hang on, okay?

707
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,560
Sara, this is just what the
Monitor said would happen.

708
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,714
No. What?

709
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,394
There was an end...

710
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,719
and there's a beginning.

711
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,953
You remember what I told you?

712
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,193
Dying is the easy part.

713
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,714
I'm at peace.

714
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,989
The real heroes...

715
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,033
They're the ones who
have to keep going.

716
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,912
So keep...going...

717
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,393
don't ever stop.

718
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:01,152
This world, this new world...

719
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,159
it needs both of you,

720
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,069
Barry...

721
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,475
An end.

722
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,240
And a beginning.

723
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,119
Thank you, Oliver,

724
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,760
Greg, move your head!
