Kevin found out and wanted to ditch, too.

But he's not even in jazz band.

He just wanted to hang out with Piper.

521

I was the one hanging out with Piper.

522
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,540
So I'm supposed to go in
and change his absent to present

- so he can hang out with Piper?
- It's bullshit.

524
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:21,124
So, instead,
I gave him three more absents.

I think, if you don't need me here,
I might just go back to the car.

It was an innocent mistake.

1320

You tried to steal a priceless piece
of gold from the Dark Lord of Winter.

Not innocent and not a mistake.

Well, who leaves their gold just lying out
in an open treasure chest?

1323
01:14:09,583 --> 01:14:12,040
It's a tribute box to Krampus.

01:14:12,041 --> 01:14:14,208
Guests come, they leave him gifts.
You stole from it.

I shouldn't be surprised.

Is that 'cause I happen to be on the list?

You disappointed in me, too, Cal?

1328

I have no expectations of you, Jack,
so I can't be disappointed.

You know, I got problems of my own.

what choice did I even have?

Krampus, I need to find him.

1440
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:31,750
Let me go.

1441
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:36,082
And why...

1442
01:20:36,083 --> 01:20:38,166
would I do that?

1443
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,833
Because we need him.

1444
01:20:44,541 --> 01:20:46,541
Now more than ever, we need him.

1445
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:49,041
And you know that.

1446
01:20:51,541 --> 01:20:53,166
Let me go.

1447
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:05,124
Northerner.

1448
01:21:05,125 --> 01:21:07,500
You are not going anywhere.

1449
01:21:08,875 --> 01:21:11,540
You, get out.

1450
01:21:11,541 --> 01:21:14,207
And deliver this message
to that MORA scum.

1451
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:17,582
There is a price for this intrusion.

1452
01:21:17,583 --> 01:21:20,874
Now and forever,

1453
01:21:20,875 --> 01:21:23,208
Drift belongs to me.

1454
01:21:24,708 --> 01:21:26,749
[laughter]

1455
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:28,707
So I can...

1456
01:21:28,708 --> 01:21:30,500
just walk out of here?

1457
01:21:31,666 --> 01:21:32,833
I suggest you run.

1458
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:38,958
You'll learn to love it here.

1459
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:41,707
Take him away.

1460
01:21:41,708 --> 01:21:43,874
[crowd murmuring, laughing]

1461
01:21:43,875 --> 01:21:47,415
Wait. Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Uh, sorry. Wait.

1462
01:21:47,416 --> 01:21:49,040
Um, uh, L-Lord... uh, Mister...

1463
01:21:49,041 --> 01:21:51,957
Lord Krampus, um...

1464
01:21:51,958 --> 01:21:53,541
you and I aren't so different.

1465
01:21:58,125 --> 01:22:00,999
We're pretty different, but I think
we have some things in common.

1466
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,415
Ah. Do you, now?

1467
01:22:03,416 --> 01:22:04,707
Yeah.

1468
01:22:04,708 --> 01:22:07,582
I mean, you strike me as a guy
that likes to have a good time.

1469
01:22:07,583 --> 01:22:08,874
Bit of a gambler?

1470
01:22:08,875 --> 01:22:10,374
Well, so am I.

1471
01:22:10,375 --> 01:22:14,832
Now, when we came in here, my man told me
that he thought he could beat you

1472
01:22:14,833 --> 01:22:17,832
at your game, uh, Krampusschlap.

1473
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:19,832
- What?
- [laughter]

1474
01:22:19,833 --> 01:22:22,999
Now, initially, I said, "No way."

1475
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,832
But the more I see him getting riled up,
I'm starting to like my odds,

1476
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:28,540
so just hear me out.

1477
01:22:28,541 --> 01:22:31,624
If you win, we go to your dungeon forever.

1478
01:22:31,625 --> 01:22:34,708
If he wins, we walk.

1479
01:22:35,791 --> 01:22:37,749
Unless you don't want to for some reason.

1480
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:39,582
I mean, I get that. He's a big guy.

1481
01:22:39,583 --> 01:22:41,249
No shame.

1482
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:42,625
Lot of people watching.

1483
01:22:48,125 --> 01:22:50,582

01:22:50,583 --> 01:22:52,749

The contestants
will exchange blows in turn.

I'm sure you do.

He's still your brother.

And he never gave up on you.

What would you know about it?

1506

I know him.

what's the deal with that?

01:36:47,583 --> 01:36:48,707
What?

1761
01:36:48,708 --> 01:36:50,040
Is it because I slashed Kevin's tires?

1762
01:36:50,041 --> 01:36:52,207
No, no, no, no, no, no, Dylan.

1763
01:36:52,208 --> 01:36:53,624
You said it was for naughty people,
didn't you?

1764
01:36:53,625 --> 01:36:55,082
Well, she said that, but--

1765
01:36:55,083 --> 01:36:56,790
- What did I do?
- Dylan.

1766
01:36:56,791 --> 01:36:58,291
Look at me.

1767
01:36:59,583 --> 01:37:02,582
You may have done some things
that you shouldn't have.

1768
01:37:02,583 --> 01:37:05,708
Everybody does. Everybody.
There is nothing wrong with you.

1769
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:09,999
You're only in here be...

1770
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,916
because of me.

1771
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:14,707
What did you do?

1772
01:37:14,708 --> 01:37:17,207
Mm. Lot of stuff.

1773
01:37:17,208 --> 01:37:19,625
It's... long list.

1774
01:37:21,333 --> 01:37:23,957
But bigger than any of that,
it's what I didn't do.

1775
01:37:23,958 --> 01:37:25,875
What are you talking about?

1776
01:37:32,583 --> 01:37:34,208
I've been a terrible father.

1777
01:37:36,125 --> 01:37:38,874
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is. It is.

1778
01:37:38,875 --> 01:37:40,582
I haven't been around.

1779
01:37:40,583 --> 01:37:43,624
I told myself I was doing you a favor,
which is bullshit.

1780
01:37:43,625 --> 01:37:47,166
It was bad for you,
and it was terrible for me.

1781
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:51,332
I've made some mistakes, pal. I know that.

1782
01:37:51,333 --> 01:37:53,750
But I also know that I can do better.

1783
01:37:54,875 --> 01:37:56,957
And I know that's easier said than done.

1784
01:37:56,958 --> 01:38:00,625
I know it's a lot of work,
and I hope it's not too late.

1785
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:08,791
Every day,
every decision is an opportunity.

1786
01:38:11,666 --> 01:38:13,500
And I want to start taking some of those.

1787
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,957
So I'm not asking you to believe me.

1788
01:38:16,958 --> 01:38:20,625
I'm just asking for you to...
give me a chance.

1789
01:38:22,041 --> 01:38:24,540
I know I may never be
the greatest father in the world,

1790
01:38:24,541 --> 01:38:27,290
but I know I can do better,

1791
01:38:27,291 --> 01:38:30,832
and I'm telling you right now
that I promise

1792
01:38:30,833 --> 01:38:33,124
I will never stop trying.

[sighs]

What just happened?

1800
01:39:04,916 --> 01:39:07,000
I think I just got a little bit nicer.

1801
01:39:08,125 --> 01:39:10,540
- Can we get out of here?
- Yeah.

1802
01:39:10,541 --> 01:39:13,332
First, we got to find somebody. Come on.

[sighs] Cal.

1807
01:39:26,833 --> 01:39:30,000
If you could make any toy in the world
real right now, what would it be?

1808
01:39:31,375 --> 01:39:32,749
Wonder Woman.

1809
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:33,999
It's him.

1810
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,249
You all right?

1811
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:37,374
Yeah. Yeah.

1812
01:39:37,375 --> 01:39:38,915
It's good to see you.

1813
01:39:38,916 --> 01:39:40,916
[Dylan] Dad?

1814
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,290
[Jack] Buddy, come here.

1815
01:39:43,291 --> 01:39:44,790
I want you to meet some friends.

1816
01:39:44,791 --> 01:39:47,957
Cal, Zoe, this is my son Dylan.

1817
01:39:47,958 --> 01:39:49,832
The one and only Dylan.

1818
01:39:49,833 --> 01:39:51,250
Your dad's told me so much about you.

1819
01:39:53,416 --> 01:39:54,915
Welcome to the North Pole.

1820
01:39:54,916 --> 01:39:57,249
Huh?

1821
01:39:57,250 --> 01:39:59,999
I can't believe she got
the old Quatuplicator back online again.

1822
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,832
This thing has been out of commission
since the late 1800s.

1823
01:40:01,833 --> 01:40:04,249
This thing was cranking out snow globes
like rat turds,

1824
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:06,249
and it just stopped
like somebody pulled the plug.

1825
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:07,415
Cal, we saw her.

1826
01:40:07,416 --> 01:40:09,499
She said she was
gonna do the ride herself.

1827
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,374
- What?
- Deliver one of these snow globes

1828
01:40:11,375 --> 01:40:12,540
to everybody on the list.

1829
01:40:12,541 --> 01:40:15,290
That's impossible.
The sleigh won't lift off.

1830
01:40:15,291 --> 01:40:16,540
Without him.

1831
01:40:16,541 --> 01:40:18,125
We can't let that sleigh take off.

1832
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,749
There's a subterranean access point
to the hangar.
