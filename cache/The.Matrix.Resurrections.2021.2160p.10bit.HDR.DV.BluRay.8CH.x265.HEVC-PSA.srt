1
00:00:58,211 --> 00:00:59,740
<i>- Seq, I'm in.
- Captain.</i>

2
00:00:59,843 --> 00:01:00,843
<i>You were right.</i>

3
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,212
<i>The skylight was a window pane.</i>

4
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,651
<i>I've got serious interference.</i>

5
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:05,739
<i>Weird.
It's some kind of Modal.</i>

6
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,686
<i>Looks like old code.</i>

7
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,146
<i>It feels really familiar.</i>

8
00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:10,841
<i>Drop a pin.
I'll signal for backup.</i>

9
00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:12,363
<i>- I'm gonna check it out.
- Bugs?</i>

10
00:01:12,442 --> 00:01:14,085
<i>If the general finds out
we've been fishing...</i>

11
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:15,778
<i>A quick peek can't hurt.</i>

12
00:01:15,861 --> 00:01:17,154
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

13
00:01:17,237 --> 00:01:18,704
<i>Shit. I think
our signal was traced.</i>

14
00:01:18,804 --> 00:01:20,824
<i>Bugs, this feels like a trap.</i>

15
00:01:20,908 --> 00:01:22,034
<i>Bugs!</i>

16
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,353
Freeze!
Do not move!

17
00:02:04,443 --> 00:02:05,533
We will shoot!

18
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:08,914
Very slowly, raise your hands.

19
00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:24,388
Here we go.

20
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,420
Hey, where are you going?

21
00:02:31,772 --> 00:02:33,081
You were warned, Lieutenant.

22
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:35,351
I think we can handle
one little girl.

23
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:39,571
You're wasting your time!

24
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:41,519
My men are bringing her
down now.

25
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:43,350
No, Lieutenant,

26
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:46,353
your men are already dead.

27
00:02:57,045 --> 00:02:58,200
Seq, you with me?

28
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,590
This old code keeps crashing.

29
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,234
Your projection's breaking up.
Switch to audio.

30
00:03:01,258 --> 00:03:02,593
Bugs, this is a direct violation

31
00:03:02,676 --> 00:03:03,927
of the general's protocols.

32
00:03:04,011 --> 00:03:05,429
I know, I know.

33
00:03:05,512 --> 00:03:07,139
But something is happening here.

34
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,686
Something important.

35
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,934
Oh, fuck.

36
00:03:11,018 --> 00:03:12,603
We know what happens next.

37
00:03:12,686 --> 00:03:14,354
She kicks their ass.

38
00:03:36,877 --> 00:03:38,295
Now she makes a call.

39
00:03:38,378 --> 00:03:39,630
The line was traced.

40
00:03:39,713 --> 00:03:41,965
- And then...
- Then she runs for her life.

41
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:43,383
Are there any agents?

42
00:03:43,467 --> 00:03:44,885
We know this story.

43
00:03:46,428 --> 00:03:48,055
This is how it all began.

44
00:03:48,764 --> 00:03:50,599
God damn it.

45
00:03:50,682 --> 00:03:52,142
This is where he began.

46
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:55,479
You're thinking this Modal
is a loop? Or a treadmill?

47
00:03:55,562 --> 00:03:59,107
Some sort of sequencer
evolving a program to do what?

48
00:03:59,191 --> 00:04:00,359
I don't know.

49
00:04:01,526 --> 00:04:03,153
But I'm going to find out.

50
00:04:03,236 --> 00:04:04,363
All right.

51
00:04:34,977 --> 00:04:37,354
So deja vu and yet it's
obviously all wrong.

52
00:04:37,437 --> 00:04:39,606
Why use old code
to mirror something new?

53
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,316
I don't know.

54
00:04:54,705 --> 00:04:56,039
If that's supposed
to be Trinity,

55
00:04:56,123 --> 00:04:57,666
that's not what happens.

56
00:04:59,626 --> 00:05:01,586
Maybe this isn't the story
we think it is.

57
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,047
Bugs, you have
to get out of here.

58
00:05:04,131 --> 00:05:06,383
It's gotta be a trap.

59
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:08,844
Shit.

60
00:05:46,548 --> 00:05:47,883
Uh...

61
00:05:47,966 --> 00:05:49,760
You all carry on.

62
00:05:49,843 --> 00:05:50,844
As you were.

63
00:05:53,847 --> 00:05:55,390
I'm just gonna...

64
00:05:56,308 --> 00:05:58,060
see myself out.

65
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,144
Kill her.

66
00:06:33,303 --> 00:06:35,097
Oh, Seq!

67
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:44,207
- Why did you save me?
- You first.

68
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,042
Who are you?
Where did you come from?

69
00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:47,669
Okay.

70
00:07:47,752 --> 00:07:49,504
My name is Bugs.

71
00:07:49,588 --> 00:07:51,882
As in "Bunny."

72
00:07:51,965 --> 00:07:53,675
And tech that listens.

73
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,720
Do you know this is a Modal?

74
00:07:57,971 --> 00:07:59,097
What's a Modal?

75
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:01,474
It's a simulation
used to evolve programs.

76
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,230
Do you understand
that you are...

77
00:08:08,148 --> 00:08:09,816
digital sentience?

78
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,568
I know what I am.

79
00:08:11,651 --> 00:08:12,903
Just like I know my job

80
00:08:12,986 --> 00:08:15,071
is to hunt down
and destroy synthients.

81
00:08:15,155 --> 00:08:16,406
Like you.

82
00:08:20,577 --> 00:08:22,120
And yet...

83
00:08:23,872 --> 00:08:25,207
Here we are.

84
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,708
Here we are.

85
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:30,462
The other agents
don't know about this room?

86
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:33,590
How'd you find it?

87
00:08:33,673 --> 00:08:36,176
No one was ever in the key shop,

88
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:37,469
so I started looking.

89
00:08:38,637 --> 00:08:40,722
More you looked,
the more you found.

90
00:08:41,765 --> 00:08:43,350
Story of my life.

91
00:08:50,482 --> 00:08:51,483
What?

92
00:08:53,652 --> 00:08:55,237
I feel like I know this room.

93
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,289
Holy shit.

94
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:10,126
This is his apartment.

95
00:09:11,378 --> 00:09:13,463
You mean Thomas Anderson's?

96
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:15,507
I searched everywhere.
He doesn't exist.

97
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,842
He stopped being Thomas
a long time ago,

98
00:09:17,926 --> 00:09:20,303
but maybe you know him
by his real name.

99
00:09:21,054 --> 00:09:22,138
Neo.

100
00:09:23,598 --> 00:09:24,849
You do.

101
00:09:25,934 --> 00:09:27,519
Oh, okay.

102
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:29,479
Uh...

103
00:09:29,562 --> 00:09:32,190
I can't believe this,
after all these years.

104
00:09:32,274 --> 00:09:35,944
You see, most people
think that Neo is dead.

105
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,697
But I know he's not.

106
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:41,408
Because I've seen him.

107
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,453
Where?

108
00:09:45,537 --> 00:09:48,081
It's not something
I can explain easily, but...

109
00:09:52,586 --> 00:09:55,714
<i>But the moment he looked at me,</i>

110
00:09:55,797 --> 00:09:57,424
I felt something...

111
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,470
unlock my mind.

112
00:10:05,015 --> 00:10:06,099
Okay.

113
00:10:08,393 --> 00:10:10,353
Something like that
happened to me.

114
00:10:15,275 --> 00:10:16,943
<i>I saw this pattern...</i>

115
00:10:18,236 --> 00:10:19,654
<i>and it was everywhere.</i>

116
00:10:21,281 --> 00:10:23,658
We can't see it,
but we're all trapped inside

117
00:10:23,742 --> 00:10:26,286
these strange, repeating loops.

118
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:29,622
Somehow I saw it in the mirror.

119
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:32,459
Just a flicker,
but it was like you said.

120
00:10:37,964 --> 00:10:40,342
And suddenly I understood.

121
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:42,886
This is not the real world.

122
00:10:45,347 --> 00:10:48,683
<i>For the first time,
I felt real purpose.</i>

123
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:51,311
I knew who I was

124
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:53,313
and what I had to do.

125
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,398
Who are you?

126
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:58,443
What do you have to do?

127
00:11:01,404 --> 00:11:02,697
I am...

128
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,866
Morpheus.

129
00:11:05,992 --> 00:11:08,286
And I have to find Neo.

130
00:11:12,457 --> 00:11:13,792
Morpheus.

131
00:11:16,753 --> 00:11:18,380
Okay. Okay.

132
00:11:18,463 --> 00:11:19,547
Oh, my God!

133
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:20,924
I have to get you out of here.

134
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:23,426
I need to figure out
who built this Modal.

135
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,095
Okay, come with me.

136
00:11:25,178 --> 00:11:27,365
You have to be ready to leave.
You have to be really ready.

137
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:28,681
And if you're not,

138
00:11:28,765 --> 00:11:30,525
if you think that
this is where you belong...

139
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:34,687
You call this a choice?

140
00:11:34,771 --> 00:11:36,332
Oh, honestly, when somebody
offered me these things,

141
00:11:36,356 --> 00:11:37,917
I went off on binary
conceptions of the world

142
00:11:37,941 --> 00:11:39,581
and said there was no way
I was swallowing

143
00:11:39,609 --> 00:11:41,486
some symbolic reduction
of my life.

144
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:42,963
And the woman
with the pills laughed

145
00:11:42,987 --> 00:11:44,215
'cause I was missing the point.

146
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:45,782
What point?

147
00:11:45,865 --> 00:11:48,785
The choice is an illusion.

148
00:11:48,868 --> 00:11:51,079
You already know
what you have to do.

149
00:11:57,836 --> 00:11:58,920
Truth.

150
00:12:05,635 --> 00:12:06,636
Okay.

151
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:07,929
There's an old building

152
00:12:08,012 --> 00:12:09,597
with a skylight
and lots of stairs.

153
00:12:09,681 --> 00:12:10,890
The Lafayette.

154
00:12:10,974 --> 00:12:12,517
One of the four back doors
leads there.

155
00:12:13,351 --> 00:12:14,477
Oh.

156
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:16,122
- Don't fight it.
- Whoa, what's happening?

157
00:12:16,146 --> 00:12:17,230
Keep breathing.

158
00:12:17,313 --> 00:12:18,749
Extraction works
pretty much the same

159
00:12:18,773 --> 00:12:20,692
for humans and programs.

160
00:12:23,528 --> 00:12:24,529
Ouch.

161
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:25,655
Ah.

162
00:12:27,073 --> 00:12:28,366
Okay.

163
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,328
- Hey.
- Hey.

164
00:12:32,412 --> 00:12:34,205
I've never worn
different glasses before.

165
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:37,041
Yeah, looks good.
Which door?

166
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,918
- It's gotta be...
- Okay.

167
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:45,675
Agent White.

168
00:12:45,758 --> 00:12:46,968
Agent Smith?

169
00:12:52,682 --> 00:12:54,142
Go!

170
00:13:01,357 --> 00:13:03,026
Seq! Can you hear me?

171
00:13:03,109 --> 00:13:04,360
Bugs! I thought I lost you.

172
00:13:04,444 --> 00:13:05,754
Can you get us
to the window pane?

173
00:13:05,778 --> 00:13:07,739
Bugs! Bugs! He's an agent!

174
00:13:17,916 --> 00:13:20,168
That window! Go hard!

175
00:14:06,381 --> 00:14:08,841
What the...

176
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:17,100
What the hell?

177
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,285
Something wrong?

178
00:14:35,368 --> 00:14:38,121
Uh... Just a little crash.

179
00:14:38,204 --> 00:14:40,582
Morning, Bobbi. Morning, dude.

180
00:14:40,665 --> 00:14:44,460
What a beautiful day
to be alive. Am I right?

181
00:14:44,544 --> 00:14:46,546
- Problemo?
- He lost something.

182
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,173
Is this old <i>Matrix</i> code?

183
00:14:51,175 --> 00:14:52,760
A little Modal experiment.

184
00:14:52,844 --> 00:14:55,805
For <i>Binary?</i>

185
00:14:55,888 --> 00:14:58,516
- I need a coffee.
- Coffee. Yes, stat!

186
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,726
I'm buying.

187
00:15:02,729 --> 00:15:04,480
I'm not trying to blow
smoke up your ass,

188
00:15:04,564 --> 00:15:08,985
but the first time I played
the trilogy, I was shook.

189
00:15:09,068 --> 00:15:11,654
The paradox
between free will and destiny.

190
00:15:11,738 --> 00:15:12,905
Are we all just algorithms

191
00:15:12,989 --> 00:15:14,229
doing what we're supposed to do

192
00:15:14,282 --> 00:15:15,992
or can we escape
our programming?

193
00:15:16,075 --> 00:15:19,996
Genius, inside the context
of the game, BT dubs.

194
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,165
Hey, did I tell you
it took over my life?

195
00:15:22,248 --> 00:15:25,001
Yeah. I failed
the seventh grade.

196
00:15:25,084 --> 00:15:27,253
Your game almost ruined me.

197
00:15:27,337 --> 00:15:29,839
- So you've said.
- Yet here we are.

198
00:15:29,922 --> 00:15:32,759
You tell me, Mr. Anderson,

199
00:15:32,842 --> 00:15:33,885
is it free will

200
00:15:35,136 --> 00:15:36,763
or destiny?

201
00:15:41,434 --> 00:15:43,353
Oh, yeah.

202
00:15:43,436 --> 00:15:45,355
There she is.

203
00:15:45,438 --> 00:15:46,939
Total f-ing MILF.

204
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:49,901
Daggers. Look, I'm sorry.

205
00:15:49,984 --> 00:15:52,278
I'm a geek.
I was raised by machines.

206
00:15:52,362 --> 00:15:53,613
Maybe you should go.

207
00:15:53,696 --> 00:15:56,741
No, please.
I... I promise, best self.

208
00:15:56,824 --> 00:15:58,076
Best self.

209
00:16:01,996 --> 00:16:03,247
Sure.

210
00:16:04,123 --> 00:16:05,541
You ever talk to her?

211
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:09,087
Tell you what.

212
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:13,549
For all you've done for me,
let me do this for you.

213
00:16:13,633 --> 00:16:16,386
Jude, no. Stop.

214
00:16:16,469 --> 00:16:18,179
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Thanks.

215
00:16:18,262 --> 00:16:19,681
Hi. Um...

216
00:16:19,764 --> 00:16:21,349
I know this is all
a bit extemporaneous.

217
00:16:21,432 --> 00:16:23,059
I'm Jude Gallagher.

218
00:16:23,142 --> 00:16:25,728
I work for a game company
called Deus Machina.

219
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:27,063
Hi, Jude, I'm Tiffany.

220
00:16:27,146 --> 00:16:30,066
Tiffany. Wow.
Didn't see that coming.

221
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:32,068
- Mom loved Audrey Hepburn.
- Jude.

222
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:36,072
Oh, and this is my very
good friend, Thomas Anderson.

223
00:16:36,155 --> 00:16:38,074
He is a bona fide famous person

224
00:16:38,157 --> 00:16:39,534
and considered by most to be

225
00:16:39,617 --> 00:16:41,619
the greatest game designer
of our generation.

226
00:16:41,703 --> 00:16:42,912
I'm sorry about this.

227
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:44,205
- Jude...
- Just talk to her.

228
00:16:44,288 --> 00:16:46,791
Hi, Thomas.
Everyone calls me "Tiff."

229
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:48,876
Hi.

230
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,176
Have we met?

231
00:16:58,636 --> 00:17:00,763
Uh, we both come here.

232
00:17:00,847 --> 00:17:02,287
- Can I have your morning bun?
- Hey!

233
00:17:02,348 --> 00:17:03,826
Are you trying
to ball my mom or what?

234
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,143
Brandon!

235
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:07,103
Can I have one bite?

236
00:17:07,186 --> 00:17:10,189
Babe! What's going on?
We're gonna be late.

237
00:17:10,273 --> 00:17:12,191
This is my husband, Chad.

238
00:17:12,275 --> 00:17:14,068
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

239
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:17,780
Babe, we gotta get
Callie to practice.

240
00:17:17,864 --> 00:17:19,949
Right. Sorry.

241
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:21,659
Come on, kids. Let's move out.

242
00:17:46,017 --> 00:17:47,018
What?

243
00:17:54,484 --> 00:17:56,819
Sorry. Uh, it's the boss.

244
00:18:02,742 --> 00:18:05,828
"Billions of people
just living out their lives...

245
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:08,873
oblivious."

246
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,211
I always loved that line.

247
00:18:13,294 --> 00:18:14,754
You wrote that one, yeah?

248
00:18:17,465 --> 00:18:19,634
Every time I stand here,

249
00:18:19,717 --> 00:18:22,970
I mean, O-M-G.

250
00:18:23,054 --> 00:18:25,097
It's so perfect,
it's gotta be fake.

251
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,558
Right?

252
00:18:29,435 --> 00:18:30,686
Yeah.

253
00:18:31,437 --> 00:18:32,688
Sure.

254
00:18:32,772 --> 00:18:34,607
Have a seat.

255
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,820
Smoke?

256
00:18:40,112 --> 00:18:41,155
I thought you quit.

257
00:18:42,031 --> 00:18:44,408
I quit calling it a habit.

258
00:18:44,492 --> 00:18:46,410
Now it's just a guilty pleasure.

259
00:18:48,579 --> 00:18:52,166
Oh. Maybe I can make this
easy for you.

260
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,293
I know <i>Binary</i> is over budget.

261
00:18:54,377 --> 00:18:56,671
This is not about <i>Binary,</i> Tom.
It's bigger than that.

262
00:18:56,754 --> 00:18:58,089
This is about our future,

263
00:18:58,172 --> 00:19:01,133
which is a sticky subject,
given our past.

264
00:19:01,217 --> 00:19:02,426
What do you mean?

265
00:19:03,553 --> 00:19:05,138
How's the therapy?

266
00:19:05,221 --> 00:19:06,514
Good.

267
00:19:07,223 --> 00:19:08,683
Any...

268
00:19:09,642 --> 00:19:10,977
episodes?

269
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:13,855
No.

270
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,274
That's terrific.

271
00:19:17,984 --> 00:19:21,487
Look, Tom, I know we've
always had our differences.

272
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:23,406
What did you say
about our first meeting?

273
00:19:23,489 --> 00:19:26,742
We had all the chemistry
of an FBI interrogation.

274
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:30,872
But look at this place.

275
00:19:31,956 --> 00:19:33,291
We did this.

276
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:35,877
Together.

277
00:19:37,253 --> 00:19:38,713
Yeah.

278
00:19:38,796 --> 00:19:40,756
Now what?

279
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,427
Things have changed.
The market's tough.

280
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,804
I'm sure you can understand
why our beloved

281
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:48,264
parent company, Warner Bros.,

282
00:19:48,347 --> 00:19:50,766
has decided to make
a sequel to the trilogy.

283
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,268
What?

284
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:54,329
They informed me they're gonna
do it with or without us.

285
00:19:54,353 --> 00:19:56,188
I thought they couldn't do that.

286
00:19:57,398 --> 00:19:58,774
Oh, they can.

287
00:19:58,858 --> 00:20:00,192
And they made it clear

288
00:20:00,276 --> 00:20:02,445
they'll kill our contract
if we don't cooperate.

289
00:20:02,528 --> 00:20:04,238
Really?

290
00:20:04,322 --> 00:20:08,200
I know you said the story
was over for you,

291
00:20:08,284 --> 00:20:10,453
but that's the thing
about stories.

292
00:20:12,246 --> 00:20:14,165
They never really end, do they?

293
00:20:14,248 --> 00:20:16,792
We're still telling the same
stories we've always told,

294
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:21,172
just with different names,
different faces

295
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:25,885
and I have to say
I'm kind of excited.

296
00:20:28,721 --> 00:20:29,889
After all these years,

297
00:20:29,972 --> 00:20:32,975
to be going back
to where it all started.

298
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,394
Back to <i>The Matrix.</i>

299
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,230
I've spoken to Marketing...

300
00:20:44,195 --> 00:20:45,738
Tom?

301
00:20:45,821 --> 00:20:47,365
Yeah.

302
00:20:47,448 --> 00:20:48,491
Are you all right?

303
00:20:50,826 --> 00:20:51,953
Yeah.

304
00:20:56,874 --> 00:20:59,085
What were you feeling
at that point?

305
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:03,965
What was I feeling?

306
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:12,014
I felt either I'm having
a mental breakdown again

307
00:21:12,098 --> 00:21:16,352
or I'm living inside
a computer-generated reality

308
00:21:16,435 --> 00:21:17,979
that has imprisoned me...

309
00:21:18,604 --> 00:21:19,772
again.

310
00:21:30,449 --> 00:21:31,951
Not much of a choice.

311
00:21:32,034 --> 00:21:33,244
No.

312
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:34,912
Maybe it's not
as binary as that.

313
00:21:34,996 --> 00:21:38,290
Maybe there are other ways
to understand what happened.

314
00:21:38,874 --> 00:21:39,959
Yeah.

315
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:42,211
Thomas, you are
a suicide survivor

316
00:21:42,294 --> 00:21:45,172
gifted with
a powerful imagination.

317
00:21:45,256 --> 00:21:47,008
Those facts have combined

318
00:21:47,091 --> 00:21:49,593
to create dangerous fictions
in your life.

319
00:21:49,677 --> 00:21:51,220
Yesterday,
you walked into a meeting

320
00:21:51,303 --> 00:21:52,430
with your business partner

321
00:21:52,513 --> 00:21:53,973
and he ambushed you,

322
00:21:54,056 --> 00:21:56,475
demanding you make a game
you said you would never make.

323
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,895
This attack effectively
took away your voice.

324
00:21:59,979 --> 00:22:02,732
His violence triggered you
and your mind fought back.

325
00:22:02,815 --> 00:22:04,692
You did to him
what he was doing to you.

326
00:22:06,193 --> 00:22:07,570
We've talked about the value

327
00:22:07,653 --> 00:22:11,198
of adaptive anger
in healing trauma.

328
00:22:11,282 --> 00:22:14,660
Far from suggesting a repeat
of your initial breakdown,

329
00:22:14,744 --> 00:22:15,953
I believe this episode

330
00:22:16,037 --> 00:22:17,830
demonstrates healthy
self-protection.

331
00:22:19,373 --> 00:22:21,584
And more importantly,
I remember how hard

332
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:24,712
it was for you
to share something like this.

333
00:22:24,795 --> 00:22:27,506
Which tells me
just how far we've come.

334
00:22:32,595 --> 00:22:34,889
Do you need a refill
on your prescription?

335
00:22:36,766 --> 00:22:37,933
Yeah.

336
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:02,750
First of all, I know
I speak for everyone

337
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:05,127
when I say that
I'm so, so excited

338
00:23:05,211 --> 00:23:07,296
to be working on a game
that was such a...

339
00:23:07,379 --> 00:23:09,465
well, game changer.

340
00:23:09,548 --> 00:23:11,133
Now, the packet in front of you

341
00:23:11,217 --> 00:23:14,011
has our focus group research.

342
00:23:14,095 --> 00:23:15,554
Inside, you'll find
the breakdown

343
00:23:15,638 --> 00:23:18,474
including keyword association
with the brand.

344
00:23:18,557 --> 00:23:21,644
The top two being
"originality" and "fresh,"

345
00:23:21,727 --> 00:23:23,771
which I think are great things
to keep in mind

346
00:23:23,854 --> 00:23:26,065
as you begin
working on <i>Matrix 4.</i>

347
00:23:27,608 --> 00:23:29,193
And who knows how many more?

348
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:48,129
What made <i>Matrix</i> different?
It effed with your head.

349
00:23:48,212 --> 00:23:49,505
On point.

350
00:23:49,588 --> 00:23:51,590
People want us
up in their grey space,

351
00:23:51,674 --> 00:23:54,718
switching their synaptic
"WTF" light on.

352
00:24:03,853 --> 00:24:07,189
What made <i>Matrix</i> different?
It effed with your head.

353
00:24:07,273 --> 00:24:09,108
People want us
up in their grey space,

354
00:24:09,191 --> 00:24:10,526
switching their synaptic

355
00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:13,237
"What the hell
is going on here?" light on.

356
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:27,543
I didn't love the first one,
like some of you.

357
00:24:27,626 --> 00:24:30,045
And, frankly,
I've got zero tolerance

358
00:24:30,129 --> 00:24:32,548
for anything that requires
a syllabus and a highlighter.

359
00:24:32,631 --> 00:24:34,508
I like my games big,
loud and dumb.

360
00:24:34,592 --> 00:24:36,552
We need guns! Lots of guns.

361
00:24:36,635 --> 00:24:39,221
<i>Matrix</i> means mayhem.

362
00:24:43,893 --> 00:24:46,061
Mindless action is not on-brand.

363
00:24:46,145 --> 00:24:47,563
She's right.

364
00:24:47,646 --> 00:24:50,691
<i>Matrix</i> is mind-porn.
Philosophy in shiny...

365
00:24:50,774 --> 00:24:52,443
- tight PVC.
- Yeah.

366
00:24:52,526 --> 00:24:54,403
Ideas are the new "sexy."

367
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:10,252
Obviously <i>The Matrix</i> is about...

368
00:25:10,336 --> 00:25:12,588
- trans-politics.
- Crypto-fascism.

369
00:25:12,671 --> 00:25:13,589
It's a metaphor...

370
00:25:13,672 --> 00:25:15,341
of capitalist exploitation.

371
00:25:27,811 --> 00:25:32,191
This cannot be another reboot,
retread, regurgitated...

372
00:25:32,274 --> 00:25:34,360
Why not? Reboots sell.

373
00:25:37,488 --> 00:25:39,549
We are so far down the wrong
rabbit hole, here, people.

374
00:25:39,573 --> 00:25:43,410
You say <i>Matrix</i> to anyone...
You say <i>Matrix...</i>

375
00:25:43,494 --> 00:25:46,455
Matrix...
Matrix... Matrix...

376
00:25:46,538 --> 00:25:48,374
this is what they see.

377
00:25:55,047 --> 00:25:57,341
Allow me to sum up our goal
in a single word.

378
00:25:57,424 --> 00:25:59,593
Bullet time! Bullet time!

379
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:01,303
That's two words.

380
00:26:05,307 --> 00:26:08,477
We need a new "bullet time."

381
00:26:11,063 --> 00:26:14,984
We need to revolutionize
gaming again.

382
00:26:15,067 --> 00:26:18,862
Revolutionize gaming again!

383
00:26:44,763 --> 00:26:46,515
<i>Afternoon, Tiff.</i>

384
00:26:46,598 --> 00:26:47,766
The ushe?

385
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:50,019
You know what, Skroce?
I'm going wild.

386
00:26:50,102 --> 00:26:52,604
I'll have a cortado today.

387
00:26:52,688 --> 00:26:55,232
Fly that freak flag.

388
00:26:55,316 --> 00:26:57,067
Mind if I get that?

389
00:26:57,151 --> 00:26:58,193
Oh, hi.

390
00:26:59,194 --> 00:27:01,196
Hi.

391
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,782
I remember wanting a family,

392
00:27:03,866 --> 00:27:05,159
but was that because

393
00:27:05,242 --> 00:27:07,911
that's what women
are supposed to want?

394
00:27:07,995 --> 00:27:09,764
How do you know
if you want something yourself

395
00:27:09,788 --> 00:27:12,916
or if your upbringing
programmed you to want it?

396
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,001
Mmm.

397
00:27:15,044 --> 00:27:17,004
I pay my analyst a lot of money

398
00:27:17,087 --> 00:27:19,673
to answer such questions for me.

399
00:27:19,757 --> 00:27:20,966
Smart.

400
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,259
I should get more therapy

401
00:27:22,343 --> 00:27:24,762
but honestly,
I'm too goddamn tired.

402
00:27:24,845 --> 00:27:26,597
Kids are exhausting, you know?

403
00:27:28,182 --> 00:27:30,434
No. Never had kids.

404
00:27:30,517 --> 00:27:33,270
Oh, right, I knew that.

405
00:27:33,354 --> 00:27:35,814
Sorry. I googled you.

406
00:27:37,775 --> 00:27:40,361
So, what's it like being
a world-famous game designer?

407
00:27:40,444 --> 00:27:42,988
- Must be amazing.
- Uh...

408
00:27:43,072 --> 00:27:44,573
A lot of hours.

409
00:27:44,656 --> 00:27:46,700
Sometimes it is amazing.

410
00:27:46,784 --> 00:27:48,285
Most times...

411
00:27:49,495 --> 00:27:50,788
I don't know.

412
00:27:50,871 --> 00:27:53,374
But you made <i>The Matrix.</i>
Even I've heard of that.

413
00:27:53,457 --> 00:27:57,252
Yeah. We kept
some kids entertained.

414
00:27:57,336 --> 00:27:59,463
So, worth it?

415
00:28:05,803 --> 00:28:08,389
Can I ask something
about your game?

416
00:28:08,472 --> 00:28:09,723
Sure.

417
00:28:09,807 --> 00:28:12,059
Did you base your
main character on yourself?

418
00:28:17,189 --> 00:28:19,191
There is a lot of me in him.

419
00:28:21,693 --> 00:28:24,863
Maybe a little too much.

420
00:28:26,865 --> 00:28:28,617
Can I ask you something else?

421
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,910
Please.

422
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,914
There's a woman in your game.

423
00:28:35,124 --> 00:28:36,125
Trinity.

424
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,712
Which is a weird
coincidence also, right?

425
00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:43,382
God, yeah.

426
00:28:44,758 --> 00:28:46,009
I like her.

427
00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:49,513
- I like Trinity.
- Ah.

428
00:28:49,596 --> 00:28:50,848
And I dig her Ducati.

429
00:28:50,931 --> 00:28:53,934
Another coincidence.
I love motorcycles.

430
00:28:57,229 --> 00:28:59,940
My friend Kush and I
actually build them.

431
00:29:00,023 --> 00:29:01,150
Really?

432
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:04,611
You have your analyst,
I have my bikes.

433
00:29:04,695 --> 00:29:09,324
So, I was looking at images
from your game. At Trinity.

434
00:29:11,034 --> 00:29:12,619
Well, I showed Chad a scene,

435
00:29:12,703 --> 00:29:14,746
and I was like,
"So, what do you think?"

436
00:29:15,831 --> 00:29:18,333
He didn't get it until I said,

437
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:20,419
"Don't you think
she looks like me?"

438
00:29:22,254 --> 00:29:23,964
You know what he did?

439
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:26,550
He laughed.

440
00:29:31,263 --> 00:29:34,141
And I laughed too,
like it was a joke.

441
00:29:34,224 --> 00:29:35,767
How could it not be, right?

442
00:29:37,978 --> 00:29:39,605
Made me so angry.

443
00:29:41,106 --> 00:29:43,442
I hated myself for laughing.

444
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:48,197
I wanted to kick him so hard.

445
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,782
Not too hard.

446
00:29:50,866 --> 00:29:54,077
Maybe just hard enough
to break his jaw off.

447
00:29:57,289 --> 00:29:59,124
And right now,
you're probably regretting

448
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:00,709
sitting down with me.

449
00:30:02,878 --> 00:30:06,757
This is the best thing
I've done in a long time.

450
00:30:11,136 --> 00:30:12,846
I have to take this.

451
00:30:16,475 --> 00:30:17,559
Hi, this is Tiff.

452
00:30:17,643 --> 00:30:18,727
Oh, God, no.

453
00:30:20,771 --> 00:30:22,773
I'll be right there.

454
00:30:22,856 --> 00:30:25,692
My, uh, youngest
stuck a Lego up his nose.

455
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:27,861
Oh.

456
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,322
I gotta go.

457
00:30:32,491 --> 00:30:35,118
I hope I see you again.

458
00:30:53,053 --> 00:30:54,179
<i>There has been a report</i>

459
00:30:54,263 --> 00:30:55,764
<i>of an emergency.</i>

460
00:30:55,847 --> 00:30:57,766
<i>Proceed calmly
to the nearest exit</i>

461
00:30:57,849 --> 00:30:59,893
<i>and leave the building
immediately.</i>

462
00:30:59,977 --> 00:31:01,353
What's going on?

463
00:31:01,436 --> 00:31:03,331
We probably just got swatted
by some 14-year-old.

464
00:31:03,355 --> 00:31:04,999
Yeah, someone pissed
about the latest update.

465
00:31:05,023 --> 00:31:06,441
Or they're just a dick.

466
00:31:06,525 --> 00:31:09,278
Please move to the exits.
Building's being evacuated.

467
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:32,217
Sir, this way.

468
00:31:38,056 --> 00:31:39,224
Jude?

469
00:31:40,726 --> 00:31:41,810
Jude!

470
00:31:48,275 --> 00:31:50,235
At last.

471
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,322
Ah.

472
00:31:53,405 --> 00:31:54,865
I wasn't too sure
about the callback,

473
00:31:54,948 --> 00:31:56,950
but, you know,
it was hard to resist.

474
00:31:57,034 --> 00:31:58,160
What?

475
00:31:58,243 --> 00:31:59,661
Morpheus Uno.
Reveal at the window.

476
00:31:59,745 --> 00:32:02,205
Lightning, thunder and theater.

477
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:04,166
At last.

478
00:32:04,249 --> 00:32:06,668
All these years later,
here's me,

479
00:32:06,752 --> 00:32:09,004
strolling out of a toilet stall.

480
00:32:09,087 --> 00:32:10,213
Tragedy or farce?

481
00:32:10,297 --> 00:32:11,923
I know you.

482
00:32:12,007 --> 00:32:14,009
Not every day
you meet your maker.

483
00:32:14,092 --> 00:32:15,260
This can't be happening.

484
00:32:15,344 --> 00:32:17,012
Oh, most definitely is.

485
00:32:17,095 --> 00:32:19,556
You can't be
a character I coded.

486
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,683
100% natural.

487
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:30,359
How?

488
00:32:30,442 --> 00:32:32,611
All the explanation you need.

489
00:32:35,822 --> 00:32:37,449
Oh.

490
00:32:37,532 --> 00:32:38,700
No.

491
00:32:38,784 --> 00:32:40,535
No, no, no.

492
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:42,412
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What do you mean, "no"?

493
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,123
You wanted this, you did this.
This was your idea.

494
00:32:45,207 --> 00:32:49,544
It was a test. An experiment.

495
00:32:50,837 --> 00:32:52,047
An experiment?

496
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,550
You put me in a tiny-ass Modal,

497
00:32:55,634 --> 00:32:57,010
left me to bang my head till

498
00:32:57,094 --> 00:32:59,346
I nearly lost my shit
searching for you

499
00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:00,931
as an experiment.

500
00:33:01,014 --> 00:33:03,076
- The exit's breaking down.
- He hasn't taken the pill.

501
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,434
What? There's no time.

502
00:33:04,518 --> 00:33:06,561
I know, I know.
He's having a moment.

503
00:33:06,645 --> 00:33:09,106
Does he know how hard it was
to hack that mirror?

504
00:33:11,441 --> 00:33:13,068
Still open.

505
00:33:13,151 --> 00:33:16,571
This... This can't be real.

506
00:33:16,655 --> 00:33:18,490
Target acquired.
We got him.

507
00:33:26,081 --> 00:33:27,416
This isn't happening.

508
00:33:27,499 --> 00:33:29,960
It's in my mind.
It's in my mind.

509
00:33:30,043 --> 00:33:31,253
Hey, you!
Stop! Hold it!

510
00:33:47,352 --> 00:33:48,895
This can't be happening.

511
00:33:52,023 --> 00:33:53,775
Freeze! Don't move!

512
00:34:02,743 --> 00:34:03,869
Neo!

513
00:34:18,759 --> 00:34:20,177
Oh, my God!

514
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,004
Neo!

515
00:35:00,884 --> 00:35:03,094
Mr. Anderson!

516
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:05,180
No!

517
00:35:05,263 --> 00:35:06,306
It can't be.

518
00:35:15,106 --> 00:35:16,942
I've missed you.

519
00:35:32,207 --> 00:35:33,875
It's in my mind.

520
00:35:35,001 --> 00:35:36,378
It's in my mind.

521
00:35:44,553 --> 00:35:46,054
Can you hear me, Thomas?

522
00:35:47,305 --> 00:35:50,100
Follow my voice.

523
00:35:50,183 --> 00:35:53,895
Feel the tips of your fingers.
What are they touching?

524
00:35:55,939 --> 00:35:57,315
The bell.

525
00:35:59,818 --> 00:36:01,236
Do you hear the bell?

526
00:36:04,656 --> 00:36:07,701
Do you remember what happened?
How you got here?

527
00:36:09,327 --> 00:36:10,620
You must have walked.

528
00:36:10,704 --> 00:36:11,913
I heard Deja Vu outside,

529
00:36:11,997 --> 00:36:13,357
opened my door,
and there you were.

530
00:36:18,587 --> 00:36:21,423
You feel like
you can talk about it?

531
00:36:21,506 --> 00:36:22,786
When we started
working together,

532
00:36:22,841 --> 00:36:24,593
you had lost your capacity

533
00:36:24,676 --> 00:36:27,220
to discern reality from fiction.

534
00:36:27,304 --> 00:36:30,473
You came to me after
trying to jump off a building.

535
00:36:30,557 --> 00:36:32,851
You said you wanted to fly away.

536
00:36:46,197 --> 00:36:48,950
We have made
a lot of progress since then,

537
00:36:49,034 --> 00:36:51,369
but you seem particularly
triggered right now.

538
00:36:51,453 --> 00:36:52,913
Can you tell me how it started?

539
00:36:54,915 --> 00:36:56,625
He texted me.

540
00:36:57,792 --> 00:36:59,127
Who?

541
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,670
Morpheus.

542
00:37:00,754 --> 00:37:01,838
Ah.

543
00:37:03,548 --> 00:37:04,925
So, he's back.

544
00:37:05,008 --> 00:37:07,177
It wasn't actually him.

545
00:37:08,345 --> 00:37:11,640
It was a program
I coded for a Modal.

546
00:37:11,723 --> 00:37:13,892
And this "Modal," Morpheus,

547
00:37:13,975 --> 00:37:15,977
came to help you escape

548
00:37:16,061 --> 00:37:19,689
from a virtual reality
called <i>The Matrix.</i>

549
00:37:29,741 --> 00:37:31,785
Am I crazy?

550
00:37:31,868 --> 00:37:34,329
We don't use that word in here.

551
00:37:34,412 --> 00:37:37,332
What word should I use?

552
00:37:37,415 --> 00:37:40,752
What word explains
what is happening to me?

553
00:37:40,835 --> 00:37:42,504
Can I see the texts?

554
00:37:44,965 --> 00:37:46,508
They were erased.

555
00:37:51,763 --> 00:37:55,100
If we got in my car
and drove to your office,

556
00:37:55,183 --> 00:37:57,143
what do you think
we'd find there?

557
00:37:57,227 --> 00:37:58,269
Nothing.

558
00:38:00,981 --> 00:38:03,066
Because there was no attack.

559
00:38:04,275 --> 00:38:05,860
No one was killed.

560
00:38:06,778 --> 00:38:08,905
No one texted.

561
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:11,032
My mind made it all up.

562
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:15,120
Is that what
I'm supposed to say?

563
00:38:15,203 --> 00:38:16,705
Is that what you believe?

564
00:38:17,497 --> 00:38:19,374
It felt real.

565
00:38:19,457 --> 00:38:21,209
Of course.

566
00:38:21,292 --> 00:38:24,212
It was your great ambition
to make a game

567
00:38:24,295 --> 00:38:26,673
that was indistinguishable
from reality.

568
00:38:26,756 --> 00:38:28,216
To achieve this goal,

569
00:38:28,299 --> 00:38:30,760
you converted elements
of your life into narrative.

570
00:38:30,844 --> 00:38:33,096
Your sublimated anger
toward your business partner

571
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:35,390
cast him as your nemesis.

572
00:38:35,473 --> 00:38:37,100
A married woman named Tiffany

573
00:38:37,183 --> 00:38:40,520
became the "Trinity"
of a doomed romance.

574
00:38:40,603 --> 00:38:44,774
Even your dislike of my cat
made it into your <i>Matrix.</i>

575
00:38:44,858 --> 00:38:46,651
There's nothing wrong with that.

576
00:38:46,735 --> 00:38:48,194
It's what artists do.

577
00:38:48,278 --> 00:38:51,656
But it becomes a problem
when fantasies

578
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,075
endanger us or other people.

579
00:38:56,327 --> 00:38:58,705
We don't want anyone
to get hurt,

580
00:38:58,788 --> 00:39:00,165
do we, Thomas?

581
00:39:08,256 --> 00:39:10,383
Hi, Thomas.
Everyone calls me "Tiff."

582
00:39:10,467 --> 00:39:12,886
- Who are you?
- My name is Trinity.

583
00:39:12,969 --> 00:39:14,596
<i>No one can tell you
you're in love.</i>

584
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:17,182
You just know it,
through and through.

585
00:39:17,265 --> 00:39:19,768
Balls to bones.

586
00:39:19,851 --> 00:39:21,644
<i>You feel this?</i>

587
00:39:23,354 --> 00:39:25,065
I'm never letting go.

588
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:34,783
<i>You have to let it all go, Neo.</i>

589
00:39:34,866 --> 00:39:37,243
Free your mind.

590
00:39:56,012 --> 00:39:57,472
Huh.

591
00:39:57,555 --> 00:39:59,557
Looks easy enough.

592
00:40:06,397 --> 00:40:09,025
"Free my mind." Shit.

593
00:40:14,197 --> 00:40:16,241
Okay.

594
00:40:16,324 --> 00:40:17,742
Free my mind.

595
00:40:33,967 --> 00:40:35,510
I fly...

596
00:40:36,427 --> 00:40:38,346
or I fall.

597
00:40:46,146 --> 00:40:47,397
Who the hell are you?

598
00:40:48,273 --> 00:40:50,358
You won't remember me,

599
00:40:50,441 --> 00:40:53,695
but a long time ago,
you changed my life

600
00:40:53,778 --> 00:40:56,156
when you leapt off another roof.

601
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:59,159
<i>Back then, I was just like
any other coppertop,</i>

602
00:40:59,242 --> 00:41:00,952
<i>pretending my life...</i>

603
00:41:01,035 --> 00:41:05,165
until I looked up and I saw you.

604
00:41:05,248 --> 00:41:07,750
<i>It was a different you,
but I saw</i>

605
00:41:08,543 --> 00:41:10,295
the real you,

606
00:41:10,378 --> 00:41:12,172
just a second before...

607
00:41:13,631 --> 00:41:14,716
you leapt.

608
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:21,264
And you never fell.

609
00:41:26,561 --> 00:41:28,730
Are you the one
that hacked my Modal?

610
00:41:29,314 --> 00:41:30,315
Yeah.

611
00:41:31,816 --> 00:41:33,359
That'll be Jude.

612
00:41:33,443 --> 00:41:34,777
He's not your friend.

613
00:41:34,861 --> 00:41:36,380
He's a handle,
a program used to control you.

614
00:41:36,404 --> 00:41:37,447
He's on his way here,

615
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:39,365
and he's bringing
Agents with him.

616
00:41:40,825 --> 00:41:42,076
Jude.

617
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,600
<i>Bro, I've been calling you
all night.</i>

618
00:41:43,661 --> 00:41:45,371
<i>We have a major problemo.</i>

619
00:41:46,915 --> 00:41:48,499
Are you alone?

620
00:41:51,252 --> 00:41:54,047
<i>That's kind
of a sexy question, dude.</i>

621
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,424
They don't look like
typical Agents.

622
00:41:56,507 --> 00:41:57,985
They use bots now,
skinned as normal people,

623
00:41:58,009 --> 00:41:59,195
which means they're everywhere

624
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:01,471
and you never know who to trust.

625
00:42:01,554 --> 00:42:03,306
Why should I trust you?

626
00:42:05,391 --> 00:42:08,478
Because if they open
that door, we lose our hack.

627
00:42:08,561 --> 00:42:10,271
I will be caught and killed

628
00:42:10,355 --> 00:42:11,564
and you will be put right back

629
00:42:11,648 --> 00:42:12,958
on that treadmill
they designed for you,

630
00:42:12,982 --> 00:42:14,168
just like they did the last time

631
00:42:14,192 --> 00:42:15,432
you tried to leap your way out.

632
00:42:16,694 --> 00:42:19,113
I know why you left
your Modal open.

633
00:42:19,197 --> 00:42:21,658
You needed someone else
to free Morpheus.

634
00:42:21,741 --> 00:42:23,844
And it's because of him that
we were able to get to you.

635
00:42:23,868 --> 00:42:25,745
I know these things the same way

636
00:42:25,828 --> 00:42:28,581
that I knew one day
I would find you.

637
00:42:28,665 --> 00:42:31,292
And that when I did,
you would be ready for this.

638
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,257
If you want the truth, Neo,

639
00:42:38,508 --> 00:42:40,510
you're going
to have to follow me.

640
00:42:42,053 --> 00:42:43,054
Okay.

641
00:43:02,573 --> 00:43:05,201
- Where are we?
- Tokyo.

642
00:43:05,285 --> 00:43:07,120
A moving portal
makes it harder to track us.

643
00:43:07,203 --> 00:43:09,831
- Seq is the best of them.
- Portal's clean.

644
00:43:09,914 --> 00:43:11,332
Reading our shadows.

645
00:43:12,834 --> 00:43:15,336
I don't remember this.

646
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,714
We don't have to run to
phone booths anymore, either.

647
00:43:27,307 --> 00:43:28,766
Door's on your right.

648
00:43:42,989 --> 00:43:45,366
Set and setting, right?

649
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:46,743
Oh, no.

650
00:43:46,826 --> 00:43:48,286
It's all about set

651
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,371
and setting.

652
00:43:50,455 --> 00:43:52,582
After our first contact
went so badly,

653
00:43:52,665 --> 00:43:54,542
we thought elements
from your past

654
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:56,127
might help ease you
into the present.

655
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:59,047
Nothing comforts anxiety like

656
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:00,548
a little nostalgia.

657
00:44:00,631 --> 00:44:02,967
This is footage from your game.

658
00:44:10,183 --> 00:44:12,185
Time is always against us,

659
00:44:13,061 --> 00:44:15,104
etcetera, etcetera.

660
00:44:16,314 --> 00:44:17,440
No one can be told

661
00:44:17,523 --> 00:44:20,818
what the Matrix is,
blah, blah, blah.

662
00:44:23,404 --> 00:44:25,365
You gotta see it to believe it.

663
00:44:28,993 --> 00:44:30,578
Time to fly.

664
00:44:32,622 --> 00:44:34,082
Wait.

665
00:44:34,165 --> 00:44:35,416
If this is real,

666
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,127
if I haven't lost my mind,
does that mean

667
00:44:39,837 --> 00:44:41,214
this happened?

668
00:44:50,056 --> 00:44:51,682
But if it did...

669
00:44:55,812 --> 00:44:57,355
then we died.

670
00:44:57,438 --> 00:44:59,357
Obviously not.

671
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,858
Why the Machines kept you alive

672
00:45:00,942 --> 00:45:03,820
and why they went
to such lengths to hide you

673
00:45:03,903 --> 00:45:05,738
are questions
we don't have answers to.

674
00:45:05,822 --> 00:45:07,407
Hide me?

675
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:11,786
I've been at a company making
a game called <i>The Matrix.</i>

676
00:45:11,869 --> 00:45:14,455
Doesn't seem like they were
trying to hide anything.

677
00:45:14,539 --> 00:45:16,141
We've been tracking
that company for years.

678
00:45:16,165 --> 00:45:18,960
We screened every
Thomas Anderson we found.

679
00:45:19,043 --> 00:45:20,628
What we didn't understand

680
00:45:20,711 --> 00:45:23,214
was that they could
alter your DSI.

681
00:45:23,297 --> 00:45:25,049
Pods generate
your digital self-image

682
00:45:25,133 --> 00:45:27,635
through a feedback system
called Semblance.

683
00:45:27,718 --> 00:45:29,720
This is how
you look to yourself.

684
00:45:29,804 --> 00:45:33,516
Somehow they were able
to alter your DSI loop.

685
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,102
This is how
everyone else sees you.

686
00:45:50,199 --> 00:45:52,160
Twenty years?

687
00:45:53,453 --> 00:45:56,998
Why did it take 20 years
to find me?

688
00:45:57,081 --> 00:45:58,916
It took a lot longer than that.

689
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,002
It's been over 60 years
since you and Trinity

690
00:46:01,085 --> 00:46:02,837
flew to one
of the Machine Cities.

691
00:46:03,546 --> 00:46:04,546
What?

692
00:46:04,589 --> 00:46:06,799
There's so much we don't know.

693
00:46:06,883 --> 00:46:08,634
Like why you've barely aged,

694
00:46:08,718 --> 00:46:10,928
or how many times
they've altered your DSI.

695
00:46:11,012 --> 00:46:12,346
But based on what we do know,

696
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:13,764
it appears no one found you

697
00:46:13,848 --> 00:46:15,683
because you didn't
want to be found.

698
00:46:15,766 --> 00:46:18,519
- That's not true.
- Maybe it isn't.

699
00:46:18,603 --> 00:46:19,812
Maybe there's no foundation

700
00:46:19,896 --> 00:46:21,123
to the rumors
that you disappeared,

701
00:46:21,147 --> 00:46:22,315
because you were working

702
00:46:22,398 --> 00:46:23,838
with the Machines
from the beginning.

703
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,026
Morpheus, stop.

704
00:46:25,109 --> 00:46:28,237
All I'm saying is
this is the moment

705
00:46:28,321 --> 00:46:30,865
for you to show us what is real.

706
00:46:30,948 --> 00:46:33,159
If you want out,

707
00:46:33,242 --> 00:46:34,619
you'll take this pill.

708
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,539
But if you are where you belong,

709
00:46:38,623 --> 00:46:40,792
you can go back to this.

710
00:46:40,875 --> 00:46:42,210
Every day.

711
00:46:42,293 --> 00:46:45,922
Over and over forever.

712
00:46:49,383 --> 00:46:50,593
Fuck.

713
00:47:00,645 --> 00:47:01,812
Keep the loop tight.

714
00:47:14,242 --> 00:47:15,409
Cybebe needs that tower pin.

715
00:47:15,493 --> 00:47:17,370
I got a signal. It's faint.

716
00:47:17,453 --> 00:47:18,913
It's definitely off-grid.

717
00:47:25,795 --> 00:47:28,214
Captain. I'm tracking
a whole lot of weird.

718
00:47:28,297 --> 00:47:29,757
- What?
- It's some kind of graft.

719
00:47:36,013 --> 00:47:37,306
Thomas?

720
00:47:38,474 --> 00:47:40,268
Oh, God.

721
00:47:40,893 --> 00:47:42,603
Oh, no.

722
00:47:43,938 --> 00:47:46,107
- We got company.
- How'd they find us?

723
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,278
Thomas, none of this is real.

724
00:47:50,361 --> 00:47:54,574
You are in the midst
of a serious psychotic break.

725
00:47:54,657 --> 00:47:56,742
- Lexy?
- Almost there.

726
00:47:56,826 --> 00:47:58,911
Thomas?

727
00:47:58,995 --> 00:48:01,831
Thomas, please.
This is not a game.

728
00:48:01,914 --> 00:48:03,416
Feel my hand.

729
00:48:03,499 --> 00:48:04,709
This is what is real.

730
00:48:07,712 --> 00:48:09,505
Stay with me.

731
00:48:09,589 --> 00:48:11,215
No. No.

732
00:48:14,093 --> 00:48:15,303
Stay with me.

733
00:48:17,972 --> 00:48:18,973
Neo!

734
00:48:22,685 --> 00:48:23,686
Morpheus!

735
00:48:25,229 --> 00:48:26,647
Let's go, let's go!

736
00:48:57,053 --> 00:48:59,138
- Bots are being activated.
- It's a swarm.

737
00:49:23,287 --> 00:49:24,372
Come on!

738
00:49:57,822 --> 00:49:59,323
I got a hack
in the bathroom. Hurry!

739
00:49:59,407 --> 00:50:00,408
Yes.

740
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,201
Come on!

741
00:50:04,245 --> 00:50:05,287
Seq, where?

742
00:50:07,415 --> 00:50:09,083
- That mirror.
- What?

743
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:10,918
- We'll never fit.
- You gotta fit,

744
00:50:11,001 --> 00:50:12,437
'cause I don't have
another way off this train.

745
00:50:12,461 --> 00:50:13,462
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

746
00:50:14,505 --> 00:50:16,006
No, no, no.

747
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:17,258
Think "perspective."

748
00:50:17,341 --> 00:50:19,135
Closer you are, bigger it gets.

749
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,348
Okay, come on.

750
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:26,767
In you go.

751
00:52:21,632 --> 00:52:23,008
Trinity.

752
00:52:28,347 --> 00:52:29,348
No!

753
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:53,182
Welcome back to the real world.

754
00:54:01,732 --> 00:54:02,900
Trinity.

755
00:54:02,983 --> 00:54:04,169
- What's up, Doc?
- His vital systems

756
00:54:04,193 --> 00:54:05,653
have been
meticulously maintained,

757
00:54:05,736 --> 00:54:07,613
but it doesn't look good.

758
00:54:12,952 --> 00:54:15,371
- We're losing him.
- Cold boot could shock him.

759
00:54:15,955 --> 00:54:16,997
Do it.

760
00:54:30,094 --> 00:54:31,595
I remember this.

761
00:54:34,264 --> 00:54:35,808
The Construct.

762
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,228
In between everything

763
00:54:39,311 --> 00:54:41,438
and nothing.

764
00:54:41,522 --> 00:54:43,190
Welcome to the Crib.

765
00:54:44,775 --> 00:54:46,819
I've been chilling here
in the ship network...

766
00:54:50,197 --> 00:54:51,824
learning all about you.

767
00:54:56,537 --> 00:54:57,663
And me.

768
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:05,337
Careful. It'll do your head in.

769
00:55:05,421 --> 00:55:08,966
Are memories turned
into fiction any less real?

770
00:55:12,136 --> 00:55:15,389
Is reality based in memory
nothing but fiction?

771
00:55:15,472 --> 00:55:18,726
As to my role in all this,
my best guess

772
00:55:18,809 --> 00:55:20,102
is that you wrote me

773
00:55:20,185 --> 00:55:22,229
as an algorithmic reflection
of two forces

774
00:55:22,312 --> 00:55:24,815
that helped you become you,

775
00:55:24,898 --> 00:55:28,360
Morpheus and Agent Smith.

776
00:55:28,444 --> 00:55:29,570
A combo pack

777
00:55:29,653 --> 00:55:32,156
of counterprogramming
that was...

778
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:38,787
Let's just say, more than
a little bit crazy-making.

779
00:55:38,871 --> 00:55:41,790
But it worked
because here we are.

780
00:55:42,833 --> 00:55:44,418
Now, for the bad news.

781
00:55:44,501 --> 00:55:46,712
Your brain
is hooked on this shit

782
00:55:46,795 --> 00:55:49,673
the Matrix has been
force-feeding you for years.

783
00:55:49,757 --> 00:55:51,425
Hooked bad.

784
00:55:51,508 --> 00:55:53,028
You're going through
major withdrawals.

785
00:55:53,093 --> 00:55:56,305
Docbots are giving you
crap odds for surviving.

786
00:55:56,388 --> 00:55:58,640
But, see,
they don't know you like I do.

787
00:56:01,518 --> 00:56:03,729
I know exactly what you need.

788
00:56:25,584 --> 00:56:27,294
You gotta be kidding.

789
00:56:27,377 --> 00:56:28,420
Uh-uh.

790
00:56:29,421 --> 00:56:31,215
No joke.

791
00:56:31,298 --> 00:56:35,427
Could be this is the first day
of the rest of your life.

792
00:56:35,511 --> 00:56:37,346
But if you want it...

793
00:56:40,974 --> 00:56:42,309
you gotta fight for it.

794
00:56:43,435 --> 00:56:46,396
No. I'm done fighting.

795
00:56:47,439 --> 00:56:48,440
Are you?

796
00:57:31,775 --> 00:57:33,193
What the hell is he doing?

797
00:57:34,361 --> 00:57:37,156
Oh, yeah.
They taught you good.

798
00:57:42,619 --> 00:57:45,873
Made you believe their world
was all you deserved.

799
00:57:45,956 --> 00:57:47,875
But some part of you knew
that was a lie.

800
00:57:47,958 --> 00:57:50,711
Some part of you remembered
what was real.

801
00:57:53,463 --> 00:57:54,631
You don't know me.

802
00:57:55,257 --> 00:57:56,300
No?

803
00:58:02,264 --> 00:58:03,265
Ooh.

804
00:58:38,967 --> 00:58:40,594
I know you, because I know

805
00:58:40,677 --> 00:58:42,596
the only thing
that still matters to you.

806
00:58:42,679 --> 00:58:45,849
I know it's why you're here,
why you're still fighting

807
00:58:45,933 --> 00:58:47,517
and why you will never give up.

808
00:59:01,698 --> 00:59:03,033
Come on, Neo!

809
00:59:04,451 --> 00:59:05,661
This is it.

810
00:59:07,788 --> 00:59:09,373
This is your last chance.

811
00:59:17,339 --> 00:59:18,799
You gotta fight
for your goddamn life

812
00:59:18,882 --> 00:59:20,217
if you want to see
Trinity again.

813
00:59:25,138 --> 00:59:26,515
Come on, Neo! Fight for her!

814
00:59:29,142 --> 00:59:31,770
- Holy shit.
- Fight for her!

815
01:00:23,822 --> 01:00:25,532
- Hey.
- Hey.

816
01:00:27,451 --> 01:00:28,952
Mind if I...

817
01:00:42,132 --> 01:00:43,633
How are you doing?

818
01:00:45,177 --> 01:00:47,304
If this plug is actually real,

819
01:00:49,264 --> 01:00:51,600
that means they took my life...

820
01:00:54,144 --> 01:00:56,521
and turned it into a video game.

821
01:00:59,649 --> 01:01:01,276
How am I doing?

822
01:01:02,235 --> 01:01:04,279
I don't know.

823
01:01:04,363 --> 01:01:06,531
I don't even know how to know.

824
01:01:07,657 --> 01:01:09,117
That's it, isn't it?

825
01:01:10,619 --> 01:01:12,829
If we don't know what's real...

826
01:01:14,915 --> 01:01:16,041
we can't resist.

827
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,420
They took your story,

828
01:01:20,504 --> 01:01:22,005
something that meant

829
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:25,342
so much to people like me,

830
01:01:26,968 --> 01:01:29,638
and turned it
into something trivial.

831
01:01:31,431 --> 01:01:33,225
That's what the Matrix does.

832
01:01:34,059 --> 01:01:36,269
It weaponizes every idea.

833
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,438
Every dream.

834
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:41,733
Everything
that's important to us.

835
01:01:44,194 --> 01:01:46,488
Where better to bury truth
than inside something

836
01:01:46,571 --> 01:01:49,616
as ordinary as a video game?

837
01:01:49,699 --> 01:01:51,701
That sounds like the Oracle.

838
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,913
Heard so much about her.

839
01:01:57,707 --> 01:01:59,251
She was gone before I was free.

840
01:02:00,877 --> 01:02:02,295
Gone?

841
01:02:02,379 --> 01:02:05,215
When this new version
of the Matrix was uploaded,

842
01:02:06,716 --> 01:02:08,260
there was a purge.

843
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:16,893
They promised peace
and they gave us purge.

844
01:02:18,353 --> 01:02:19,813
No.

845
01:02:19,896 --> 01:02:21,606
No, there was peace.

846
01:02:23,024 --> 01:02:28,155
You made it possible,
and it changed everything.

847
01:02:28,238 --> 01:02:31,741
Doesn't feel like
it changed anything.

848
01:02:31,825 --> 01:02:35,036
The Matrix is the same or worse.

849
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,330
And I'm back where I started.

850
01:02:40,083 --> 01:02:42,544
It feels like everything I did,

851
01:02:43,587 --> 01:02:45,088
everything we did...

852
01:02:51,094 --> 01:02:53,305
like none of it mattered.

853
01:02:55,515 --> 01:02:57,184
All of it mattered.

854
01:02:58,935 --> 01:03:00,437
I can show you.

855
01:03:11,114 --> 01:03:12,699
This is my crew.

856
01:03:15,827 --> 01:03:17,996
Our operator, Seq.

857
01:03:20,207 --> 01:03:24,085
Sequoia. But everybody
calls me Seq.

858
01:03:24,169 --> 01:03:25,629
Nice to meet you.

859
01:03:26,671 --> 01:03:28,715
Dad loved redwoods.

860
01:03:28,798 --> 01:03:30,050
When he escaped the Matrix

861
01:03:30,133 --> 01:03:31,676
and found out
they no longer existed,

862
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,261
it almost killed him.

863
01:03:33,345 --> 01:03:34,554
Lucky, he met Mom

864
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:37,057
and here I am.

865
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:40,852
This is Lexy, Berg and Ellster.

866
01:03:41,603 --> 01:03:42,729
Hi.

867
01:03:42,812 --> 01:03:45,398
You knew my grandfather,
Captain Roland.

868
01:03:45,482 --> 01:03:47,943
Roland was your grandfather?

869
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,819
He always laughed,

870
01:03:49,903 --> 01:03:51,303
joking how he never
believed in you.

871
01:03:51,988 --> 01:03:53,406
But, in private, he said that

872
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:55,617
you freed his mind
a second time.

873
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,744
Uh, not to fanboy out here,

874
01:03:57,827 --> 01:03:59,829
but this is kind
of a huge moment for me.

875
01:03:59,913 --> 01:04:02,415
Berg is our resident
Neo-ologist.

876
01:04:02,499 --> 01:04:03,708
A what?

877
01:04:03,792 --> 01:04:06,836
There's a lot of people
out there like me

878
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:09,256
who are a little bit
obsessed with your life.

879
01:04:09,339 --> 01:04:10,507
I would never have recognized

880
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:11,776
your Modal
if it weren't for him.

881
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,110
Whenever
you're feeling up for it,

882
01:04:13,134 --> 01:04:15,095
I've got, like,
a million questions.

883
01:04:15,178 --> 01:04:17,639
Me too. Starting with them.

884
01:04:18,974 --> 01:04:20,016
It's okay.

885
01:04:20,767 --> 01:04:22,018
Come meet him.

886
01:04:22,102 --> 01:04:23,395
This is Cybebe.

887
01:04:23,478 --> 01:04:24,896
That's Octacles.

888
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:27,649
That's Lumin8.

889
01:04:27,732 --> 01:04:29,985
Machines are on our side now?

890
01:04:30,068 --> 01:04:31,278
They are synthients.

891
01:04:31,361 --> 01:04:33,029
It's a word
they prefer to "Machines."

892
01:04:33,113 --> 01:04:34,507
Your contact
with the Synthient City

893
01:04:34,531 --> 01:04:36,908
had a huge impact
on their world.

894
01:04:36,992 --> 01:04:38,118
That's what I meant.

895
01:04:38,201 --> 01:04:39,452
What you changed

896
01:04:39,536 --> 01:04:41,216
that nobody believed
could ever be changed.

897
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:45,542
The meaning of "our side."

898
01:04:49,337 --> 01:04:51,172
Cybebe and Octacles
risked their lives

899
01:04:51,256 --> 01:04:52,424
to help get you out.

900
01:04:53,883 --> 01:04:54,884
Thank you.

901
01:04:56,428 --> 01:04:57,470
But why?

902
01:04:57,554 --> 01:05:00,098
Not all seek to control.

903
01:05:00,181 --> 01:05:02,183
Just as not all wish to be free.

904
01:05:03,977 --> 01:05:05,228
What is that?

905
01:05:05,312 --> 01:05:07,606
An exomorphic-particle codex.
It's pretty new.

906
01:05:07,689 --> 01:05:09,816
It gives programs
access to this world.

907
01:05:09,899 --> 01:05:11,109
Within limits.

908
01:05:11,192 --> 01:05:14,195
Limits are the domain
of the limited.

909
01:05:14,279 --> 01:05:15,822
Morpheus.

910
01:05:15,905 --> 01:05:16,948
Thank you.

911
01:05:17,032 --> 01:05:18,450
It was my honor.

912
01:05:20,243 --> 01:05:21,494
Wow.

913
01:05:21,578 --> 01:05:22,746
How does it work?

914
01:05:22,829 --> 01:05:24,331
Paramagnetic oscillation.

915
01:05:24,414 --> 01:05:25,582
If you want,

916
01:05:25,665 --> 01:05:26,976
I can download
the codex manual for you.

917
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,419
- Sure.
- Downloading used to be fun.

918
01:05:29,502 --> 01:05:31,880
Now it's all manuals
and diagnostics.

919
01:05:31,963 --> 01:05:33,673
Can I ask them something?

920
01:05:36,593 --> 01:05:39,846
When you unplugged me,
there was another pod?

921
01:05:41,181 --> 01:05:44,059
Yes. We've analyzed the data.

922
01:05:45,268 --> 01:05:46,603
It could be Trinity.

923
01:05:47,437 --> 01:05:49,022
It's her.

924
01:05:49,105 --> 01:05:52,192
I figured we were going
to have this conversation.

925
01:05:52,275 --> 01:05:55,195
Look, you were not
a typical flush-and-grab.

926
01:05:55,278 --> 01:05:56,946
You were in this weird tower
that Cybebe

927
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:59,115
had never accessed,
and she's now exiled.

928
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:01,576
We burned our one shot for you.

929
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:03,703
Even if it were Trinity
and she wanted to be free,

930
01:06:03,787 --> 01:06:05,830
we have no idea how to do it.

931
01:06:05,914 --> 01:06:06,915
Yet.

932
01:06:09,334 --> 01:06:12,212
Nobody believed
we'd ever find him,

933
01:06:12,295 --> 01:06:13,338
but we did.

934
01:06:15,757 --> 01:06:17,676
Okay.

935
01:06:17,759 --> 01:06:20,887
We don't know
how to get her out... yet.

936
01:06:22,931 --> 01:06:25,600
Captain, we're approaching
security clearance.

937
01:06:26,893 --> 01:06:28,061
We're here.

938
01:06:28,144 --> 01:06:29,187
Zion?

939
01:06:37,278 --> 01:06:38,738
Have a seat.

940
01:06:38,822 --> 01:06:41,574
This is Hanno.
Best pilot in our fleet.

941
01:06:41,658 --> 01:06:42,658
Quite a few synthients

942
01:06:42,701 --> 01:06:44,160
deserve that title before me.

943
01:06:44,244 --> 01:06:45,412
Mnemosyne, <i>you are cleared</i>

944
01:06:45,495 --> 01:06:46,871
<i>for landing. Welcome home.</i>

945
01:06:46,955 --> 01:06:48,623
Thank you, Control.

946
01:06:48,707 --> 01:06:50,291
Um, we're about to crash.

947
01:06:57,215 --> 01:06:58,466
General realized we were

948
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:00,593
never going to beat
the Sentinels, so...

949
01:07:00,677 --> 01:07:02,804
we just got better
at hiding from them.

950
01:07:07,392 --> 01:07:08,977
Welcome to Io.

951
01:07:10,603 --> 01:07:12,021
Io.

952
01:07:18,445 --> 01:07:21,197
Wow. That looks real.

953
01:07:21,698 --> 01:07:23,283
Bio-sky.

954
01:07:26,870 --> 01:07:29,205
Works kind of like grow lights.

955
01:07:29,289 --> 01:07:30,957
It's way more complex than that.

956
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,501
It pulls water from the crust,
hydronating the air.

957
01:07:33,585 --> 01:07:36,921
It balances the ECO
and our SRI cycles.

958
01:07:38,006 --> 01:07:39,340
Plus...

959
01:07:40,175 --> 01:07:41,968
it is pretty to look at.

960
01:07:42,051 --> 01:07:43,845
As opposed to that.

961
01:07:45,138 --> 01:07:47,724
I guess the general sent us
a welcome party.

962
01:08:05,992 --> 01:08:07,410
God damn.

963
01:08:08,495 --> 01:08:09,704
It is you.

964
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:11,748
Niobe?

965
01:08:13,583 --> 01:08:17,170
A few more wrinkles
and a few less teeth,

966
01:08:17,253 --> 01:08:20,924
but wise enough to know
I don't know anything.

967
01:08:21,007 --> 01:08:23,676
I sure as shit
never saw this coming.

968
01:08:24,511 --> 01:08:25,678
Neither did I.

969
01:08:25,762 --> 01:08:27,096
I told you he was alive.

970
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:29,140
Captain, you and your crew
have been grounded.

971
01:08:29,224 --> 01:08:30,850
General,
if you'd just let me explain.

972
01:08:30,934 --> 01:08:33,561
The protocols are put in place
for everyone's protection.

973
01:08:33,645 --> 01:08:35,522
I'm sorry.
I saw an opportunity

974
01:08:35,605 --> 01:08:37,065
and I was afraid we'd lose him.

975
01:08:37,148 --> 01:08:39,818
But, General, people have been
waiting for so long.

976
01:08:41,486 --> 01:08:42,737
We found The One.

977
01:08:44,572 --> 01:08:46,282
I don't believe in The One.

978
01:08:48,535 --> 01:08:49,661
I never did.

979
01:08:50,328 --> 01:08:51,412
No?

980
01:08:52,497 --> 01:08:54,040
Me neither.

981
01:08:54,123 --> 01:08:56,501
But there was a time

982
01:08:56,584 --> 01:08:59,254
when you trusted me
with your ship,

983
01:08:59,337 --> 01:09:01,130
against the Council's orders.

984
01:09:01,214 --> 01:09:03,299
The world was different then.

985
01:09:05,134 --> 01:09:06,761
We were different.

986
01:09:08,805 --> 01:09:10,223
Report to the docks.

987
01:09:10,306 --> 01:09:12,016
Scrub down the <i>Mnemosyne.</i>

988
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:14,394
Transfer your access codes.

989
01:09:14,477 --> 01:09:15,895
You are done, Captain.

990
01:09:25,572 --> 01:09:27,407
We need to talk.

991
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:35,290
When word first came

992
01:09:35,373 --> 01:09:37,625
that it actually might be you...

993
01:09:41,379 --> 01:09:45,174
I didn't know how I would feel
in this moment.

994
01:09:53,057 --> 01:09:55,018
It is nice to see you.

995
01:09:55,101 --> 01:09:57,812
It's good to see you too.

996
01:10:03,693 --> 01:10:06,446
A long way
from Dozer's paint stripper.

997
01:10:06,529 --> 01:10:09,490
Yes.

998
01:10:09,574 --> 01:10:11,326
A lot has changed.

999
01:10:12,869 --> 01:10:14,787
Except maybe you.

1000
01:10:17,582 --> 01:10:19,125
You remember this?

1001
01:10:26,215 --> 01:10:28,968
It's so easy to forget
how much noise

1002
01:10:29,052 --> 01:10:30,970
the Matrix pumps into your head

1003
01:10:31,054 --> 01:10:32,847
until you unplug.

1004
01:10:34,307 --> 01:10:35,683
Yeah.

1005
01:10:35,767 --> 01:10:38,686
Something else
makes the same kind of noise.

1006
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:40,980
Takes over every damn thing,

1007
01:10:41,064 --> 01:10:42,774
just like the Matrix.

1008
01:10:44,442 --> 01:10:45,443
War.

1009
01:10:47,153 --> 01:10:49,781
I stood at the barricade
of the Temple.

1010
01:10:51,574 --> 01:10:53,868
Staring
at the army of Sentinels,

1011
01:10:54,994 --> 01:10:57,622
waiting for them
to kill every one of us.

1012
01:10:59,082 --> 01:11:02,168
But then, they left.

1013
01:11:03,378 --> 01:11:05,838
They said you saved us.

1014
01:11:05,922 --> 01:11:07,090
I didn't believe it.

1015
01:11:07,173 --> 01:11:10,510
Every night I would dream
of attack sirens.

1016
01:11:11,177 --> 01:11:12,428
But then,

1017
01:11:15,014 --> 01:11:17,225
I would wake up to this...

1018
01:11:21,229 --> 01:11:22,689
silence.

1019
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:27,694
I'm ashamed of it now.

1020
01:11:27,777 --> 01:11:31,781
My pessimism of how long
it took me to believe

1021
01:11:31,864 --> 01:11:35,118
a world without war
was possible.

1022
01:11:36,536 --> 01:11:38,538
You gave me that.

1023
01:11:38,621 --> 01:11:41,499
You gave that gift to us all.

1024
01:11:41,582 --> 01:11:45,253
And it is the gift
that continues to bear fruit.

1025
01:11:47,964 --> 01:11:49,716
Come help me get up.

1026
01:11:49,799 --> 01:11:51,551
Let's take a walk.

1027
01:12:15,658 --> 01:12:17,660
Oh! Beautiful.

1028
01:12:18,745 --> 01:12:21,706
This is Freya, head of botany.

1029
01:12:21,789 --> 01:12:25,084
And this is Quillion,
our lead digitologist.

1030
01:12:25,168 --> 01:12:29,172
I presume our guest
needs no introduction.

1031
01:12:29,255 --> 01:12:31,924
Nothing travels
faster than light,

1032
01:12:32,008 --> 01:12:33,259
except gossip.

1033
01:12:35,636 --> 01:12:37,055
Welcome to the Garden, Neo.

1034
01:12:39,098 --> 01:12:40,266
A strawberry?

1035
01:12:40,349 --> 01:12:42,060
Using digital code
from the Matrix,

1036
01:12:42,143 --> 01:12:44,562
we retro-convert it
into DNA sequences.

1037
01:12:44,645 --> 01:12:46,064
And they grow here?

1038
01:12:46,147 --> 01:12:47,774
It's not easy
augmenting the genome

1039
01:12:47,857 --> 01:12:50,401
to photosynthesize
Bio-sky, but...

1040
01:12:50,485 --> 01:12:52,236
We're getting there.

1041
01:12:52,987 --> 01:12:54,697
Go ahead. Try it.

1042
01:13:02,205 --> 01:13:04,415
We're quite excited
about the blueberries.

1043
01:13:04,499 --> 01:13:06,417
You remember that shit
we used to eat?

1044
01:13:06,501 --> 01:13:08,878
That slop that tasted like rust.

1045
01:13:10,463 --> 01:13:14,092
Zion could have never
made something like this.

1046
01:13:14,175 --> 01:13:15,802
Why?

1047
01:13:15,885 --> 01:13:18,471
Because we needed synthients

1048
01:13:18,554 --> 01:13:20,515
and DI like him.

1049
01:13:20,598 --> 01:13:23,976
Zion was stuck in the past.
Stuck in war.

1050
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:26,437
Stuck in a Matrix of its own.

1051
01:13:26,521 --> 01:13:30,399
They believed
that it had to be us or them.

1052
01:13:30,483 --> 01:13:33,486
This city was built by us

1053
01:13:33,569 --> 01:13:35,238
and them.

1054
01:13:40,910 --> 01:13:42,453
What happened to Zion?

1055
01:13:42,537 --> 01:13:45,957
I've been waiting
for you to ask that question.

1056
01:13:47,917 --> 01:13:51,379
All of the troubles
started in the Machine Cities.

1057
01:13:51,462 --> 01:13:55,174
Power plants were unable
to produce enough energy.

1058
01:13:55,258 --> 01:13:59,011
Nothing can breed violence
like scarcity.

1059
01:14:00,763 --> 01:14:02,348
For the first time,

1060
01:14:02,431 --> 01:14:05,643
<i>we saw machines at war
with one other.</i>

1061
01:14:08,646 --> 01:14:12,650
We got word from the Oracle
of a new power rising.

1062
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:17,280
That was the last
we heard from her.

1063
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:22,326
Morpheus.

1064
01:14:22,410 --> 01:14:26,789
After the siege,
he was elected unanimously.

1065
01:14:26,873 --> 01:14:29,750
High Chair of the Council.

1066
01:14:29,834 --> 01:14:33,254
Oh, how he loved that.

1067
01:14:33,337 --> 01:14:37,550
But as rumors
of this new power spread,

1068
01:14:37,633 --> 01:14:39,051
he ignored them.

1069
01:14:39,135 --> 01:14:43,764
He was certain what you had
done could not be undone.

1070
01:14:43,848 --> 01:14:47,810
All of these people never
stopped believing in miracles,

1071
01:14:47,894 --> 01:14:50,271
believing in you.

1072
01:15:02,325 --> 01:15:03,701
I'm sorry.

1073
01:15:05,536 --> 01:15:07,955
How could I know
this would happen?

1074
01:15:08,039 --> 01:15:10,333
We didn't understand
all of it back then.

1075
01:15:10,416 --> 01:15:12,251
No more than we do now.

1076
01:15:12,335 --> 01:15:15,630
I didn't come here
to cause you problems, Niobe,

1077
01:15:16,672 --> 01:15:18,424
but I need your help.

1078
01:15:20,092 --> 01:15:21,552
Trinity is alive.

1079
01:15:21,636 --> 01:15:23,387
Then there is another question.

1080
01:15:23,471 --> 01:15:25,264
Why did they keep her alive?

1081
01:15:25,348 --> 01:15:26,599
I can't answer that.

1082
01:15:26,682 --> 01:15:30,019
But if there's a chance
I can free her,

1083
01:15:30,102 --> 01:15:31,646
I have to try.

1084
01:15:31,729 --> 01:15:35,650
Even if it means endangering
everyone in this city?

1085
01:15:39,904 --> 01:15:41,614
I'm sorry, Neo.

1086
01:15:41,697 --> 01:15:45,368
I won't let what happened
to Zion happen to Io.

1087
01:15:47,161 --> 01:15:48,537
I hope you'll forgive
an old woman

1088
01:15:48,621 --> 01:15:51,707
for asking you to go
with Sheperd, here,

1089
01:15:51,791 --> 01:15:53,292
till we have
better understanding

1090
01:15:53,376 --> 01:15:54,794
of what's going on.

1091
01:15:54,877 --> 01:15:57,922
You're going to imprison me
after I just got free?

1092
01:15:58,005 --> 01:16:01,801
I know it doesn't seem fair,

1093
01:16:01,884 --> 01:16:04,679
but neither does growing old.

1094
01:16:04,762 --> 01:16:06,889
But you don't
hear me complaining.

1095
01:16:18,901 --> 01:16:20,736
Sorry.

1096
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:22,863
I've never met a legend before.

1097
01:16:26,242 --> 01:16:27,326
Neo.

1098
01:16:28,619 --> 01:16:30,371
Sheperd.

1099
01:16:31,747 --> 01:16:33,582
Crazy. You're real.

1100
01:16:35,543 --> 01:16:36,669
"Real."

1101
01:16:37,753 --> 01:16:39,755
There's that word again.

1102
01:16:45,261 --> 01:16:47,638
People talk a lot
about the old days.

1103
01:16:47,722 --> 01:16:49,974
About you, the viral Agent.

1104
01:16:50,057 --> 01:16:52,685
The siege of Zion.

1105
01:16:52,768 --> 01:16:54,770
Everything was simpler
back then.

1106
01:16:55,771 --> 01:16:57,356
People wanted to be free.

1107
01:16:59,442 --> 01:17:01,360
It's different now.

1108
01:17:01,444 --> 01:17:04,905
Sometimes it feels like
people gave up.

1109
01:17:06,157 --> 01:17:07,867
Like the Matrix won.

1110
01:17:10,661 --> 01:17:12,079
This is you.

1111
01:17:16,083 --> 01:17:18,377
And I gotta ask you one thing.

1112
01:17:20,421 --> 01:17:22,131
Is it true you could fly?

1113
01:17:26,969 --> 01:17:27,970
Cool.

1114
01:17:58,501 --> 01:17:59,794
Morpheus.

1115
01:17:59,877 --> 01:18:02,797
Oh. General stuck you
in the Rapunzel tower.

1116
01:18:05,257 --> 01:18:06,759
On the upside, it's a nice view.

1117
01:18:06,842 --> 01:18:08,928
What happened to Bugs
and the others?

1118
01:18:09,011 --> 01:18:10,781
They're supposed to be
sterilizing the <i>Mnemosyne</i>

1119
01:18:10,805 --> 01:18:12,932
- with a toothbrush.
- "Supposed to be"?

1120
01:18:13,015 --> 01:18:14,409
Well, I could tell you
that they're standing by,

1121
01:18:14,433 --> 01:18:15,744
waiting for you
to make the choice

1122
01:18:15,768 --> 01:18:17,603
to remain meekly incarcerated

1123
01:18:17,687 --> 01:18:20,022
or bust the hell out of here
and go and find Trinity.

1124
01:18:21,607 --> 01:18:22,692
But that ain't a choice.

1125
01:18:35,329 --> 01:18:37,456
General, what should we do?

1126
01:18:40,876 --> 01:18:43,462
Bugs has the same
independence of mind

1127
01:18:43,546 --> 01:18:45,005
she had the day you freed her.

1128
01:18:45,089 --> 01:18:48,092
This is not
independence of mind.

1129
01:18:48,175 --> 01:18:49,218
It's mutiny.

1130
01:18:50,553 --> 01:18:51,804
Come on, 'Be.

1131
01:18:51,887 --> 01:18:54,890
I know how much
you hated locking him up.

1132
01:18:54,974 --> 01:18:57,685
Just like I know
there's a part of you

1133
01:18:57,768 --> 01:19:00,813
that's relieved now
that he's gone.

1134
01:19:02,273 --> 01:19:06,110
We've worked so hard
to keep Io safe.

1135
01:19:08,863 --> 01:19:10,489
This scares me.

1136
01:19:21,041 --> 01:19:22,334
That's her.

1137
01:19:22,418 --> 01:19:23,544
On the bridge.

1138
01:19:24,086 --> 01:19:25,087
Got her.

1139
01:19:33,763 --> 01:19:36,015
It's sick
how the Semblance works.

1140
01:19:36,098 --> 01:19:38,851
You see flashes
of the real her, but...

1141
01:19:38,934 --> 01:19:40,561
the way she reads...

1142
01:19:42,271 --> 01:19:44,899
Code-wise, she's pure bluepill.

1143
01:19:46,775 --> 01:19:49,862
This is a tough question, Neo,
but it has to be asked.

1144
01:19:50,988 --> 01:19:53,157
What if she's happy
where she is?

1145
01:19:54,617 --> 01:19:55,868
How did I read?

1146
01:19:57,953 --> 01:19:59,872
Exactly like her.

1147
01:20:03,626 --> 01:20:05,878
Take us to broadcast depth.

1148
01:20:17,181 --> 01:20:18,641
Thank you for helping me.

1149
01:20:20,267 --> 01:20:22,269
Most of us are here
because of you.

1150
01:20:24,939 --> 01:20:26,065
I also admit our only chance

1151
01:20:26,148 --> 01:20:27,566
to get out
of the general's doghouse

1152
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:29,276
is for you to find your mojo.

1153
01:20:30,986 --> 01:20:33,572
What if I can't be
what I once was?

1154
01:20:35,115 --> 01:20:36,742
Then we're all fucked.

1155
01:20:36,825 --> 01:20:38,202
Two minutes.

1156
01:20:38,285 --> 01:20:39,662
Two minutes to broadcast.

1157
01:20:48,837 --> 01:20:50,317
I slipped you in
through a hotel room.

1158
01:20:52,007 --> 01:20:53,467
Should be safe.

1159
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:05,771
Portal's open.

1160
01:21:05,854 --> 01:21:08,041
Closest I could get you is
the warehouse near her garage.

1161
01:21:08,065 --> 01:21:09,608
Whole zone's crawling with bots.

1162
01:21:10,985 --> 01:21:12,528
Let's go.

1163
01:21:39,763 --> 01:21:42,891
So, what do you think of him?

1164
01:21:42,975 --> 01:21:45,769
I was kinda worried at first
because he's so much older.

1165
01:21:45,853 --> 01:21:48,355
The beard, the hair... Oh.

1166
01:21:48,439 --> 01:21:51,859
- No, totally works for me.
- You idiot.

1167
01:21:51,942 --> 01:21:53,319
I mean "The One" thing.

1168
01:21:54,987 --> 01:21:57,948
You know, everyone that
shipped with him died.

1169
01:21:58,032 --> 01:22:00,826
Oh, yeah. He's gonna
get us all killed, for sure.

1170
01:22:06,206 --> 01:22:07,750
Predictable as ever.

1171
01:22:10,002 --> 01:22:11,754
Smith.

1172
01:22:11,837 --> 01:22:14,173
Smith? As in, "the" Smith?

1173
01:22:22,306 --> 01:22:23,599
This is so insane.

1174
01:22:23,682 --> 01:22:24,993
There's so many theories
about the two of them

1175
01:22:25,017 --> 01:22:26,685
and they're standing
right there.

1176
01:22:26,769 --> 01:22:28,354
This code is freaky!

1177
01:22:28,437 --> 01:22:31,315
He's like an Agent, but not.

1178
01:22:35,486 --> 01:22:37,071
An appeal to reason.

1179
01:22:41,283 --> 01:22:42,785
How did you find us?

1180
01:22:42,868 --> 01:22:45,788
You never appreciated
our relationship.

1181
01:22:45,871 --> 01:22:47,247
Not like The Analyst.

1182
01:22:47,331 --> 01:22:49,249
- The what?
- My doctor.

1183
01:22:49,333 --> 01:22:53,045
He used our bond
and turned it into a chain.

1184
01:22:53,128 --> 01:22:54,797
It's so obvious
once you see it, right?

1185
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:58,300
But this whole altered-code
update really blew my mind.

1186
01:22:58,384 --> 01:23:00,386
I still don't know
how he did it.

1187
01:23:00,469 --> 01:23:03,263
You, as a balding nerd.

1188
01:23:03,347 --> 01:23:05,099
Hilarious.

1189
01:23:05,182 --> 01:23:07,559
And me...

1190
01:23:07,643 --> 01:23:10,312
even more perfect.

1191
01:23:10,396 --> 01:23:12,398
Maybe a little too far
on the piercing blue eyes.

1192
01:23:12,481 --> 01:23:14,400
What do you think?

1193
01:23:14,483 --> 01:23:16,443
What do you want, Smith?

1194
01:23:18,612 --> 01:23:20,906
I have such dreams, Tom.

1195
01:23:20,989 --> 01:23:22,700
Big dreams.

1196
01:23:22,783 --> 01:23:25,536
Well, mostly just extremely
violent revenge fantasies,

1197
01:23:25,619 --> 01:23:27,037
but in order for me
to pursue mine,

1198
01:23:27,121 --> 01:23:29,164
I need to dissuade you
from pursuing yours.

1199
01:23:29,248 --> 01:23:32,876
Hmm. Sounds like conflict.

1200
01:23:34,586 --> 01:23:36,130
Inevitable?

1201
01:23:37,339 --> 01:23:38,674
Doesn't have to be.

1202
01:23:38,757 --> 01:23:40,926
All you have to do
is stay out of the Matrix,

1203
01:23:41,009 --> 01:23:42,511
and leave the good doctor to me.

1204
01:23:42,594 --> 01:23:44,930
You can have him.
I'm here for Trinity.

1205
01:23:45,013 --> 01:23:46,515
That's the trouble, Tom.

1206
01:23:46,598 --> 01:23:49,268
He knew you'd come,
just like I did.

1207
01:23:51,019 --> 01:23:52,229
Trust me.

1208
01:23:53,188 --> 01:23:54,732
You're not ready for him.

1209
01:23:54,815 --> 01:23:57,609
Captain, I'm reading portals
from the lower frequencies.

1210
01:24:02,906 --> 01:24:06,076
I won't have his leash
on my neck again.

1211
01:24:13,542 --> 01:24:15,794
I found some
old acquaintances of yours.

1212
01:24:16,837 --> 01:24:20,215
Bugs!

1213
01:24:33,896 --> 01:24:34,938
Exiles.

1214
01:24:35,022 --> 01:24:36,249
I thought they were all purged.

1215
01:24:36,273 --> 01:24:37,775
You?

1216
01:24:37,858 --> 01:24:38,984
Oh!

1217
01:24:39,067 --> 01:24:41,403
It is you!

1218
01:24:42,738 --> 01:24:46,325
All these years.
I can't believe it.

1219
01:24:46,992 --> 01:24:48,660
Oh, God.

1220
01:24:48,744 --> 01:24:52,706
You stole my life!

1221
01:24:57,461 --> 01:24:59,004
What the Merv is trying to say,

1222
01:24:59,087 --> 01:25:01,548
is that their situation
is a little bit like mine.

1223
01:25:01,632 --> 01:25:03,842
To have their lives back,
yours has to end.

1224
01:25:07,513 --> 01:25:08,597
Kill him!

1225
01:25:21,819 --> 01:25:24,279
You ruined

1226
01:25:24,363 --> 01:25:27,491
every suck-my-silky-ass thing!

1227
01:25:27,574 --> 01:25:30,160
We had grace.

1228
01:25:35,207 --> 01:25:36,750
We had style!

1229
01:25:36,834 --> 01:25:38,836
We had conversation!

1230
01:25:38,919 --> 01:25:40,879
Not this...

1231
01:26:05,404 --> 01:26:08,949
Art, films,
books were all better!

1232
01:26:09,032 --> 01:26:12,244
Originality mattered!

1233
01:26:12,327 --> 01:26:14,246
You gave us Face-Zucker-suck

1234
01:26:14,329 --> 01:26:17,791
and Cock-me-climatey-
Wiki-piss-and-shit!

1235
01:27:03,921 --> 01:27:05,505
I still know kung fu.

1236
01:27:07,382 --> 01:27:08,383
Neo!

1237
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:39,581
Just like old times.

1238
01:28:37,222 --> 01:28:38,265
Neo.

1239
01:28:40,183 --> 01:28:42,853
I've been thinking
about us, Tom.

1240
01:28:42,936 --> 01:28:46,231
Look how binary is the form,
the nature of things.

1241
01:28:47,482 --> 01:28:48,775
Ones and zeros.

1242
01:28:49,985 --> 01:28:51,111
Light and dark.

1243
01:28:53,238 --> 01:28:55,282
Choice and its absence.

1244
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:00,912
Anderson and Smith.

1245
01:29:37,532 --> 01:29:39,743
You've lost something, Tom.

1246
01:29:43,705 --> 01:29:45,540
You're not what you used to be.

1247
01:29:46,792 --> 01:29:47,876
It's true.

1248
01:30:01,223 --> 01:30:03,225
- Nice one.
- Thanks.

1249
01:30:11,066 --> 01:30:12,275
Come on, Neo.

1250
01:30:37,259 --> 01:30:39,803
Captain. You okay?

1251
01:30:39,886 --> 01:30:42,848
Yeah. Where's Neo?

1252
01:30:42,931 --> 01:30:44,057
Smith is killing him.

1253
01:30:44,141 --> 01:30:45,517
Where?

1254
01:30:53,024 --> 01:30:55,026
I feel bad about this, Tom.

1255
01:30:57,612 --> 01:30:59,739
After all, you are the one
who set me free...

1256
01:31:01,032 --> 01:31:02,033
again.

1257
01:31:04,077 --> 01:31:05,162
So, you, more than anyone,

1258
01:31:05,245 --> 01:31:06,872
understands why I can't go back.

1259
01:31:09,457 --> 01:31:11,251
You should have listened to me.

1260
01:31:13,461 --> 01:31:15,213
Now you'll never see her again.

1261
01:31:28,810 --> 01:31:29,978
What was that?

1262
01:31:30,061 --> 01:31:31,438
That was Neo.

1263
01:31:33,064 --> 01:31:34,065
Mojo rising.

1264
01:31:42,115 --> 01:31:43,575
You all right?

1265
01:31:43,658 --> 01:31:45,160
Yeah.

1266
01:31:45,243 --> 01:31:46,443
It's gonna trigger a response.

1267
01:31:46,495 --> 01:31:47,704
I got multiple exits ready.

1268
01:31:47,787 --> 01:31:49,247
This is not over yet!

1269
01:31:49,331 --> 01:31:52,042
Our sequel franchise spinoff!

1270
01:31:59,090 --> 01:32:00,508
We should go.

1271
01:32:00,592 --> 01:32:01,760
I can't.

1272
01:32:01,843 --> 01:32:03,762
I have to talk to her.

1273
01:32:03,845 --> 01:32:06,097
Neo, those Exiles
were older than you,

1274
01:32:06,181 --> 01:32:07,265
and we barely handled them.

1275
01:32:10,852 --> 01:32:12,395
You really wanna do this now?

1276
01:32:17,817 --> 01:32:19,027
I mean...

1277
01:32:23,031 --> 01:32:24,616
you look like shit.

1278
01:32:35,877 --> 01:32:38,421
Oh, my God. What?
What happened?

1279
01:32:38,505 --> 01:32:39,631
An accident.

1280
01:32:39,714 --> 01:32:42,050
Kush! Call a doctor.

1281
01:32:42,133 --> 01:32:43,677
It's fine.

1282
01:32:44,594 --> 01:32:46,721
I don't have a lot of time.

1283
01:32:46,805 --> 01:32:48,515
I wasn't sure I'd see you again.

1284
01:32:48,598 --> 01:32:51,184
After we spoke, I realized...

1285
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:54,104
my life wasn't a life.

1286
01:32:55,563 --> 01:32:58,316
At some point, I think I gave up

1287
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,652
searching for something real.

1288
01:33:06,992 --> 01:33:08,285
Wait.

1289
01:33:09,744 --> 01:33:12,330
Something happened.

1290
01:33:12,414 --> 01:33:14,791
I looked for you
at the coffee shop.

1291
01:33:16,584 --> 01:33:18,920
I began to wonder
if I imagined you.

1292
01:33:20,088 --> 01:33:22,632
And then last night
I had a dream.

1293
01:33:22,716 --> 01:33:25,510
In the dream, you were
surrounded by police,

1294
01:33:25,593 --> 01:33:28,138
then they started chasing us.

1295
01:33:28,221 --> 01:33:31,224
- Us?
- You were on my bike with me.

1296
01:33:33,393 --> 01:33:34,769
How did it end?

1297
01:33:36,187 --> 01:33:37,355
Not good.

1298
01:33:39,899 --> 01:33:43,320
I've had dreams
that weren't just dreams.

1299
01:33:43,403 --> 01:33:45,655
You mean a dream that came true?

1300
01:33:53,330 --> 01:33:55,957
Finally, we can talk
like adults.

1301
01:33:57,625 --> 01:34:00,754
I hate lying. I do.
It exhausts me.

1302
01:34:02,547 --> 01:34:04,632
Tiff and I have been
waiting for you...

1303
01:34:04,716 --> 01:34:05,967
like, forever.

1304
01:34:13,058 --> 01:34:14,351
Deja vu, right?

1305
01:34:16,144 --> 01:34:18,313
Oh, no use.
You can't beat time.

1306
01:34:18,396 --> 01:34:22,108
This rewind is happening
faster than you can blink.

1307
01:34:26,988 --> 01:34:28,990
You gave me the idea.

1308
01:34:31,826 --> 01:34:35,121
Allow me to sum up our goal
in a single word.

1309
01:34:38,166 --> 01:34:39,292
"Bullet time."

1310
01:34:41,127 --> 01:34:43,088
I know. Kind of ironic,

1311
01:34:43,171 --> 01:34:47,092
using the power that defined
you to control you.

1312
01:34:47,175 --> 01:34:49,803
I kept such a close eye on you

1313
01:34:49,886 --> 01:34:52,430
and still you found a way out.

1314
01:34:52,514 --> 01:34:54,891
Clever monkey, using that Modal.

1315
01:34:55,850 --> 01:34:57,018
Call me an optimist,

1316
01:34:57,102 --> 01:34:59,270
but this could
all be for the best.

1317
01:34:59,354 --> 01:35:02,190
The skin's not looking
too bad this time.

1318
01:35:02,273 --> 01:35:04,901
I know some of this will be
difficult for you to hear,

1319
01:35:04,984 --> 01:35:06,444
after everything
you went through.

1320
01:35:06,528 --> 01:35:07,904
All that pain and suffering,

1321
01:35:07,987 --> 01:35:10,824
only to learn the world
doesn't end when you do.

1322
01:35:12,367 --> 01:35:13,451
Surprise.

1323
01:35:19,457 --> 01:35:20,875
I was there when you died.

1324
01:35:23,378 --> 01:35:24,504
I said to myself,

1325
01:35:24,587 --> 01:35:27,799
"Here is the anomaly
of anomalies."

1326
01:35:27,882 --> 01:35:30,677
What an extraordinary
opportunity.

1327
01:35:32,345 --> 01:35:33,805
First, I had to convince
the Suits

1328
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:35,306
to let me rebuild
the two of you.

1329
01:35:35,390 --> 01:35:36,975
Why her? Getting there.

1330
01:35:37,058 --> 01:35:38,852
And don't worry,
she can't hear me.

1331
01:35:38,935 --> 01:35:42,063
Resurrecting you both
was crazy expensive.

1332
01:35:42,147 --> 01:35:43,481
Like renovating a house.

1333
01:35:43,565 --> 01:35:45,817
Took twice as long,
cost twice as much.

1334
01:35:49,904 --> 01:35:52,365
I thought you'd be happy
to be alive again.

1335
01:35:53,408 --> 01:35:54,659
So wrong.

1336
01:35:56,453 --> 01:36:00,081
Did you know hope and despair
are nearly identical in code?

1337
01:36:02,083 --> 01:36:04,043
We worked for years,

1338
01:36:04,127 --> 01:36:05,754
<i>trying to activate
your source code.</i>

1339
01:36:05,837 --> 01:36:09,257
I was about to give up,
when I realized...

1340
01:36:12,343 --> 01:36:13,386
Trinity.

1341
01:36:13,470 --> 01:36:15,638
It was never just you.

1342
01:36:15,722 --> 01:36:18,808
Alone, neither of you
is of any particular value.

1343
01:36:20,518 --> 01:36:21,686
Like acids and bases,

1344
01:36:21,769 --> 01:36:24,147
you're dangerous
when mixed together.

1345
01:36:24,230 --> 01:36:27,192
Every sim
where you two bonded...

1346
01:36:27,275 --> 01:36:29,360
Let's just say
bad things happened.

1347
01:36:31,404 --> 01:36:32,864
Neo!

1348
01:36:37,118 --> 01:36:40,497
However, as long as I managed
to keep you close,

1349
01:36:40,580 --> 01:36:42,248
but not too close,

1350
01:36:42,332 --> 01:36:45,543
I discovered
something incredible.

1351
01:36:45,627 --> 01:36:49,130
Now, my predecessor
loved precision.

1352
01:36:49,214 --> 01:36:52,884
His Matrix was all fussy facts
and equations.

1353
01:36:52,967 --> 01:36:54,719
He hated the human mind.

1354
01:36:54,802 --> 01:36:56,221
So he never bothered to realize

1355
01:36:56,304 --> 01:36:57,531
that you don't give a shit
about facts.

1356
01:36:57,555 --> 01:36:58,973
It's all about fiction.

1357
01:36:59,057 --> 01:37:03,728
The only world that matters
is the one in here.

1358
01:37:03,812 --> 01:37:06,814
And you people
believe the craziest shit.

1359
01:37:07,357 --> 01:37:08,608
Why?

1360
01:37:08,691 --> 01:37:11,277
What validates
and makes your fictions real?

1361
01:37:12,237 --> 01:37:13,321
Feelings.

1362
01:37:14,489 --> 01:37:15,949
Allow me.

1363
01:37:17,325 --> 01:37:18,993
Kush, here,
is one of my handlers.

1364
01:37:19,077 --> 01:37:20,411
They're everywhere.

1365
01:37:20,495 --> 01:37:23,081
Such a pain, cloning Agents
over a coppertop.

1366
01:37:23,164 --> 01:37:25,625
Far more effective
just to saturate a population.

1367
01:37:27,544 --> 01:37:30,421
And, bonus,
swarm mode is sick fun.

1368
01:37:42,850 --> 01:37:45,979
Ooh! Nicely done.

1369
01:37:47,438 --> 01:37:50,692
You ever wonder
why you have nightmares?

1370
01:37:50,775 --> 01:37:53,736
Why your own brain tortures you?

1371
01:37:53,820 --> 01:37:57,323
It's actually us,
maximizing your output.

1372
01:37:57,407 --> 01:37:58,575
It works just like this.

1373
01:37:58,658 --> 01:38:01,286
Oh, no!
Can you stop the bullet?

1374
01:38:01,369 --> 01:38:04,289
If only you could move faster.

1375
01:38:04,372 --> 01:38:06,916
Here's the thing about feelings.

1376
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,294
They're so much easier
to control than facts.

1377
01:38:10,253 --> 01:38:12,130
Turns out, in my Matrix,

1378
01:38:12,213 --> 01:38:15,675
the worse we treat you,
the more we manipulate you,

1379
01:38:15,758 --> 01:38:18,219
the more energy you produce.

1380
01:38:18,303 --> 01:38:20,513
It's nuts.

1381
01:38:20,597 --> 01:38:22,181
I've been setting
productivity records

1382
01:38:22,265 --> 01:38:23,558
every year since I took over.

1383
01:38:23,641 --> 01:38:26,477
And, the best part,
zero resistance.

1384
01:38:26,561 --> 01:38:27,937
People stay in their pods,

1385
01:38:28,021 --> 01:38:31,107
happier than pigs in shit.

1386
01:38:31,190 --> 01:38:32,400
The key to it all?

1387
01:38:32,483 --> 01:38:33,818
You.

1388
01:38:33,901 --> 01:38:35,069
And her.

1389
01:38:35,153 --> 01:38:37,363
Quietly yearning
for what you don't have,

1390
01:38:37,447 --> 01:38:39,866
while dreading
losing what you do.

1391
01:38:39,949 --> 01:38:41,618
For 99.9% of your race,

1392
01:38:41,701 --> 01:38:44,370
that is the definition
of reality.

1393
01:38:44,454 --> 01:38:47,332
Desire and fear, baby.

1394
01:38:47,415 --> 01:38:50,376
Just give the people
what they want, right?

1395
01:38:59,677 --> 01:39:02,722
She's the only home
you have, Thomas.

1396
01:39:02,805 --> 01:39:06,100
Come home before
something terrible happens.

1397
01:39:16,527 --> 01:39:17,820
- Bugs!
- I hear him.

1398
01:39:24,202 --> 01:39:25,370
Trinity!

1399
01:39:25,453 --> 01:39:27,163
- You shouldn't call me that.
- I'm sorry.

1400
01:39:28,665 --> 01:39:29,916
I have to go.

1401
01:39:29,999 --> 01:39:31,167
But I'll be back.

1402
01:39:32,293 --> 01:39:34,587
Neo! Time to go.

1403
01:39:37,090 --> 01:39:38,800
- Sentinels?
- Worse.

1404
01:39:40,259 --> 01:39:41,344
<i>General ordered me</i>

1405
01:39:41,427 --> 01:39:42,428
<i>to look after the ship.</i>

1406
01:39:42,512 --> 01:39:44,389
So you shadowed us?

1407
01:39:44,472 --> 01:39:46,057
Check your long-range scans.

1408
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:48,142
<i>Squids are combing this area.</i>

1409
01:39:48,226 --> 01:39:49,686
He's right.

1410
01:39:49,769 --> 01:39:50,937
You can stay here and die,

1411
01:39:51,020 --> 01:39:53,398
or come back
and face a court-martial.

1412
01:39:53,481 --> 01:39:55,483
And you call that a choice?

1413
01:40:02,699 --> 01:40:04,826
Sheperd should have
left you to the Squids.

1414
01:40:04,909 --> 01:40:08,287
I'm too damn old to sit
through some boring-ass trial.

1415
01:40:08,371 --> 01:40:09,580
Niobe, don't blame Bugs.

1416
01:40:09,664 --> 01:40:11,582
Do shut your mouth.

1417
01:40:11,666 --> 01:40:13,960
Do address me as General.

1418
01:40:14,043 --> 01:40:18,297
And do not rob
my ex-captain of her agency,

1419
01:40:18,381 --> 01:40:20,383
which she exercised with her own

1420
01:40:20,466 --> 01:40:23,970
particular brand
of shortsighted stupidity.

1421
01:40:25,221 --> 01:40:26,305
Shortsighted?

1422
01:40:27,974 --> 01:40:31,936
You care more about growing
fruit than freeing minds.

1423
01:40:32,019 --> 01:40:34,522
We are not going
to have this argument again.

1424
01:40:34,605 --> 01:40:36,941
It's not an argument.
It's a fact.

1425
01:40:37,024 --> 01:40:38,234
You gave up on people.

1426
01:40:39,694 --> 01:40:42,029
I tell you
what I'm going to give up on

1427
01:40:42,113 --> 01:40:43,197
and it's you!

1428
01:40:45,616 --> 01:40:47,535
Sheperd, get her
out of my sight!

1429
01:40:47,618 --> 01:40:48,745
General...

1430
01:40:50,663 --> 01:40:51,748
Disarm!

1431
01:40:51,831 --> 01:40:53,458
Kujaku's a friend.

1432
01:41:00,006 --> 01:41:01,632
Hello, friend.

1433
01:41:04,218 --> 01:41:05,219
Okay.

1434
01:41:06,554 --> 01:41:07,764
Him?

1435
01:41:14,687 --> 01:41:16,355
General.

1436
01:41:16,439 --> 01:41:17,732
Thank you for seeing me.

1437
01:41:17,815 --> 01:41:19,609
I figured if there was anyone

1438
01:41:19,692 --> 01:41:21,986
who could make sense
of this mess,

1439
01:41:22,069 --> 01:41:23,863
it would be you.

1440
01:41:23,946 --> 01:41:25,072
Hello, Neo.

1441
01:41:25,156 --> 01:41:26,991
I know you.

1442
01:41:27,074 --> 01:41:29,076
I tried to keep my eye on you.

1443
01:41:32,413 --> 01:41:33,664
Why?

1444
01:41:33,748 --> 01:41:35,500
We met a long time ago.

1445
01:41:37,210 --> 01:41:38,294
Good morning.

1446
01:41:41,088 --> 01:41:42,089
Sati.

1447
01:41:42,173 --> 01:41:44,675
My father knew we'd meet again,

1448
01:41:44,759 --> 01:41:47,720
though he would have wished
for happier circumstances.

1449
01:41:47,804 --> 01:41:49,597
His inadvertent role
in what happened to you

1450
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:51,933
was the greatest regret
of his life.

1451
01:41:52,016 --> 01:41:53,893
I don't understand.

1452
01:41:55,269 --> 01:41:56,938
My father was the chief engineer

1453
01:41:57,021 --> 01:41:58,272
at the Anomaleum.

1454
01:41:58,356 --> 01:41:59,732
The what?

1455
01:41:59,816 --> 01:42:02,902
My father designed
the resurrection pods

1456
01:42:02,985 --> 01:42:04,904
where Neo and Trinity
were imprisoned.

1457
01:42:06,948 --> 01:42:08,199
I'm sorry.

1458
01:42:08,282 --> 01:42:09,784
You knew what happened to him?

1459
01:42:09,867 --> 01:42:13,079
You knew that he and Trinity
both were alive...

1460
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:15,373
and you didn't tell me?

1461
01:42:15,456 --> 01:42:18,376
There were times
I doubted my decision, Niobe.

1462
01:42:18,459 --> 01:42:20,086
But Io needed you.

1463
01:42:20,169 --> 01:42:21,504
This city needed to be built

1464
01:42:21,587 --> 01:42:23,631
for your people as well as mine.

1465
01:42:24,799 --> 01:42:26,551
If I would have
told you everything,

1466
01:42:26,634 --> 01:42:28,803
you would have had a very
difficult choice to make.

1467
01:42:28,886 --> 01:42:30,471
My friends

1468
01:42:31,806 --> 01:42:34,308
let me make my own choices.

1469
01:42:34,392 --> 01:42:36,310
If it was a mistake,

1470
01:42:36,394 --> 01:42:38,479
you have my deepest apologies.

1471
01:42:40,565 --> 01:42:41,899
Why are you here now?

1472
01:42:41,983 --> 01:42:44,485
Neo's escape has
destabilized the Matrix.

1473
01:42:44,569 --> 01:42:45,820
The Anomaleum draws its current

1474
01:42:45,903 --> 01:42:47,238
from Trinity alone now.

1475
01:42:47,321 --> 01:42:49,490
A fail-safe has been
triggered to reset

1476
01:42:49,574 --> 01:42:51,576
the Matrix back
to the previous version.

1477
01:42:51,659 --> 01:42:53,452
But The Analyst
halted the reset.

1478
01:42:53,536 --> 01:42:54,829
He's convinced the authorities

1479
01:42:54,912 --> 01:42:56,873
that you will soon
return voluntarily.

1480
01:42:57,999 --> 01:42:59,917
And why would he say that?

1481
01:43:00,001 --> 01:43:03,087
Because if I don't go back,
he'll kill Trinity.

1482
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:08,217
Faced with returning to your pod

1483
01:43:08,301 --> 01:43:11,095
or enduring
Trinity's death again.

1484
01:43:11,178 --> 01:43:12,471
What would you choose, Neo?

1485
01:43:13,556 --> 01:43:14,849
I'll go back.

1486
01:43:16,559 --> 01:43:18,769
Well, The Analyst
knows you well,

1487
01:43:18,853 --> 01:43:21,606
but that knowledge
has made him incautious.

1488
01:43:21,689 --> 01:43:23,357
After you escaped,

1489
01:43:23,441 --> 01:43:26,277
he should have accepted his
losses and devacuated Trinity.

1490
01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:29,238
But that would have prevented
this extraordinary opportunity

1491
01:43:29,322 --> 01:43:31,240
that now exists before us.

1492
01:43:31,908 --> 01:43:34,827
A few hours ago,

1493
01:43:34,911 --> 01:43:38,205
no one would have been able
to convince me

1494
01:43:38,289 --> 01:43:42,585
that I would be standing here,
trying to explain a mission

1495
01:43:42,668 --> 01:43:44,629
as crazy as this one.

1496
01:43:48,424 --> 01:43:50,051
What are you doing?

1497
01:43:50,134 --> 01:43:51,677
- Volunteering.
- Oh, no.

1498
01:43:51,761 --> 01:43:56,307
You are the one captain
that I am ordering to go.

1499
01:43:56,390 --> 01:43:57,975
Now you don't
have to order me, General,

1500
01:43:58,059 --> 01:43:59,727
'cause I'm volunteering.

1501
01:44:03,105 --> 01:44:04,649
I need two more.

1502
01:44:09,153 --> 01:44:11,989
Are you out of your minds?

1503
01:44:12,073 --> 01:44:13,950
You don't even know what it is.

1504
01:44:14,033 --> 01:44:16,953
General, we know you.

1505
01:44:17,036 --> 01:44:18,245
If you say this is important,

1506
01:44:18,329 --> 01:44:20,373
none of us is
choosing to stay home.

1507
01:44:25,753 --> 01:44:26,837
Thank you.

1508
01:44:31,926 --> 01:44:33,928
Knuckle up, and good luck.

1509
01:45:03,958 --> 01:45:05,459
Trinity is held
in the Anomaleum,

1510
01:45:05,543 --> 01:45:07,294
which is in this
transmission tower.

1511
01:45:07,378 --> 01:45:09,630
<i>The passages used
to rescue Neo are now sealed</i>

1512
01:45:09,714 --> 01:45:11,924
<i>and a legion of Sentinels
patrols the tower.</i>

1513
01:45:12,008 --> 01:45:14,051
So, stealth will be paramount.

1514
01:45:14,135 --> 01:45:15,886
As long as we raise no alarms,

1515
01:45:15,970 --> 01:45:18,055
this first part of the mission
should be the easiest.

1516
01:45:18,139 --> 01:45:19,449
You mean crossing the Fetus Fields,

1517
01:45:19,473 --> 01:45:21,225
sneaking across
an entire power plant,

1518
01:45:21,308 --> 01:45:22,727
climbing a two-kilometer tower

1519
01:45:22,810 --> 01:45:24,645
guarded by thousands
of Sentinels?

1520
01:45:24,729 --> 01:45:25,896
That's the easy part?

1521
01:45:25,980 --> 01:45:27,648
Exactly so.

1522
01:45:27,732 --> 01:45:30,067
Because all we have to do
is convince someone

1523
01:45:30,151 --> 01:45:31,819
who does this every day

1524
01:45:31,902 --> 01:45:33,320
to take one of us along.

1525
01:45:56,844 --> 01:45:58,679
Fifty meters below the Anomaleum

1526
01:45:58,763 --> 01:46:00,264
is a stratum
of amniotic filters.

1527
01:46:00,347 --> 01:46:03,768
Hidden along this edge
is a small hexagonal vent.

1528
01:46:03,851 --> 01:46:07,021
<i>This vent feeds the air intake
into the corpuscular modifier,</i>

1529
01:46:07,104 --> 01:46:10,191
<i>which oxygenates
the bio-gel used in Neo's pod.</i>

1530
01:46:10,858 --> 01:46:12,068
I get it.

1531
01:46:12,151 --> 01:46:15,029
The exomorph slinkies up
Neo's old umbilicus.

1532
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:17,406
What could go wrong?

1533
01:47:04,286 --> 01:47:05,663
<i>Once inside,</i>

1534
01:47:05,746 --> 01:47:07,581
<i>Morpheus will use
the System Operator</i>

1535
01:47:07,665 --> 01:47:10,000
<i>to open the devacuator line
and disengage the macerators.</i>

1536
01:47:14,088 --> 01:47:15,673
In order to unplug
Trinity's body,

1537
01:47:15,756 --> 01:47:17,967
while her mind still remains
connected to the Matrix,

1538
01:47:18,050 --> 01:47:19,677
I'm gonna need
a second human brain

1539
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:20,970
to implement the bypass.

1540
01:47:21,053 --> 01:47:22,680
And since Neo
must be with The Analyst,

1541
01:47:22,763 --> 01:47:25,933
the only available mind
that's a near-enough match

1542
01:47:26,016 --> 01:47:27,059
is yours.

1543
01:47:28,602 --> 01:47:29,602
Figures.

1544
01:47:47,037 --> 01:47:48,164
Thanks, Cybebe.

1545
01:47:56,380 --> 01:47:58,382
Does Trinity still have
to take the red pill?

1546
01:47:58,465 --> 01:47:59,884
Since Kujaku and I
are transferring

1547
01:47:59,967 --> 01:48:01,260
her consciousness onto the ship,

1548
01:48:01,343 --> 01:48:03,012
it's not strictly necessary.

1549
01:48:03,095 --> 01:48:07,016
But what matters is that
this is her choice.

1550
01:48:07,099 --> 01:48:10,394
Extracting a confused
or an uncertain mind will,

1551
01:48:10,477 --> 01:48:11,854
in all probability, kill her.

1552
01:48:11,937 --> 01:48:14,481
But even if it is
what she wants,

1553
01:48:14,565 --> 01:48:18,235
won't The Analyst just order
the Sentinels to stop you?

1554
01:48:18,319 --> 01:48:19,820
He will.

1555
01:48:19,904 --> 01:48:22,364
But if my plan works,
it won't matter.

1556
01:48:22,448 --> 01:48:23,448
Why?

1557
01:48:23,490 --> 01:48:25,117
Because we'll already be gone.

1558
01:48:26,827 --> 01:48:28,746
Somebody thinks
this hard about a plan,

1559
01:48:28,829 --> 01:48:30,247
there has to be a reason why.

1560
01:48:32,458 --> 01:48:33,667
When my father realized

1561
01:48:33,751 --> 01:48:36,003
how the Anomaleum
was going to be used,

1562
01:48:36,086 --> 01:48:39,548
he covertly transferred
the designs to me.

1563
01:48:39,632 --> 01:48:42,134
The Analyst
discovered his betrayal

1564
01:48:42,218 --> 01:48:44,094
and had my parents purged.

1565
01:48:46,722 --> 01:48:49,725
I would have been murdered too
if it wasn't for Kujaku.

1566
01:48:52,770 --> 01:48:56,774
Not a day goes by
that I don't grieve them.

1567
01:48:56,857 --> 01:48:59,985
I've been praying for this day
for a very long time.

1568
01:49:08,077 --> 01:49:09,620
We're coming up on broadcast.

1569
01:49:12,206 --> 01:49:16,210
I thought you should know
that I'm here because of her.

1570
01:49:19,713 --> 01:49:22,091
All I ever wanted was to be
as fearless as Trinity.

1571
01:49:24,301 --> 01:49:27,721
But I saw how she reacted
in the garage, and I...

1572
01:49:27,805 --> 01:49:30,432
You're wondering if I'm wrong.

1573
01:49:30,516 --> 01:49:32,059
What if we're too late?

1574
01:49:33,852 --> 01:49:35,562
What if she's not
Trinity anymore?

1575
01:49:40,985 --> 01:49:43,737
I never believed I was The One.

1576
01:49:44,613 --> 01:49:46,031
But she did.

1577
01:49:47,074 --> 01:49:48,701
She believed in me.

1578
01:49:51,370 --> 01:49:53,580
It's my turn to believe in her.

1579
01:50:18,564 --> 01:50:20,482
This is where it gets tricky.

1580
01:50:31,618 --> 01:50:34,038
Have you ever done
an operation like this?

1581
01:50:34,747 --> 01:50:35,831
Not yet.

1582
01:50:57,561 --> 01:50:58,896
Here we go.

1583
01:51:16,538 --> 01:51:18,457
Welcome home.

1584
01:51:18,540 --> 01:51:20,918
All I want is to talk to her.

1585
01:51:21,001 --> 01:51:22,628
Do you mean Tiff?

1586
01:51:22,711 --> 01:51:25,464
Come back, and you can talk
to her as often as you like.

1587
01:51:25,547 --> 01:51:26,924
I mean, handsome Chad

1588
01:51:27,007 --> 01:51:28,467
may have something
to say about it.

1589
01:51:28,550 --> 01:51:31,845
If she tells me
this is what she wants,

1590
01:51:33,055 --> 01:51:34,223
you win.

1591
01:51:34,306 --> 01:51:35,432
Really?

1592
01:51:35,516 --> 01:51:38,268
But if she wants me,

1593
01:51:38,352 --> 01:51:40,187
then you'll let us go free.

1594
01:51:40,270 --> 01:51:43,023
And why would I do something
as stupid as that?

1595
01:51:43,107 --> 01:51:45,901
Right now, I'm on a ship full
of people who will unplug me

1596
01:51:45,984 --> 01:51:48,987
before they'll let you
take me back.

1597
01:51:49,071 --> 01:51:51,115
If you want this Matrix,

1598
01:51:51,198 --> 01:51:52,741
this is your only chance.

1599
01:51:52,825 --> 01:51:55,786
But how do I know
they won't unplug you anyway?

1600
01:51:55,869 --> 01:51:59,206
Same way I know you'll let us
walk out of here.

1601
01:52:24,815 --> 01:52:26,483
Okay.

1602
01:52:26,567 --> 01:52:28,068
I like tests.

1603
01:52:28,944 --> 01:52:30,737
We'll let Tiff decide.

1604
01:52:48,088 --> 01:52:49,256
That's it.

1605
01:52:50,466 --> 01:52:52,009
Bypass is ready.

1606
01:52:52,092 --> 01:52:53,802
Now what?

1607
01:52:53,886 --> 01:52:55,137
We wait.

1608
01:52:55,220 --> 01:52:57,181
Doesn't it seem crazy
to come all this way

1609
01:52:57,264 --> 01:52:58,849
and leave her here?

1610
01:52:58,932 --> 01:53:01,602
We must abide by her decision.

1611
01:53:01,685 --> 01:53:03,270
And if she says no,

1612
01:53:04,104 --> 01:53:05,564
what happens to Neo?

1613
01:53:05,647 --> 01:53:06,857
At this time,

1614
01:53:06,940 --> 01:53:09,776
the most important choice
of Neo's life

1615
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:11,361
is not his to make.

1616
01:53:42,392 --> 01:53:44,186
I saw this in my dream.

1617
01:53:45,646 --> 01:53:49,107
If I was the Oracle,
maybe I could explain it.

1618
01:53:49,775 --> 01:53:51,360
The Oracle.

1619
01:53:51,443 --> 01:53:53,111
From your game?

1620
01:53:54,988 --> 01:53:57,241
It's not a game.

1621
01:53:59,368 --> 01:54:00,577
Oh, God.

1622
01:54:08,043 --> 01:54:11,463
After you left, I went home

1623
01:54:11,547 --> 01:54:13,257
and I played it.

1624
01:54:15,634 --> 01:54:18,095
I kept thinking,

1625
01:54:18,178 --> 01:54:21,515
why does this story
feel like a memory?

1626
01:54:28,689 --> 01:54:30,440
There's a part of me

1627
01:54:33,026 --> 01:54:36,238
that feels like I have been
waiting my whole life for you.

1628
01:54:39,199 --> 01:54:41,451
And that part is like,

1629
01:54:41,535 --> 01:54:45,247
"What the hell
took you so long?"

1630
01:54:45,330 --> 01:54:47,374
I don't have an easy answer.

1631
01:54:49,543 --> 01:54:51,712
Maybe I was afraid of this.

1632
01:54:53,171 --> 01:54:55,048
Afraid of what might happen.

1633
01:54:56,550 --> 01:54:59,553
Afraid of hurting
the only person I ever loved.

1634
01:55:01,263 --> 01:55:04,808
I wish I was who you think I am.

1635
01:55:06,184 --> 01:55:07,769
But look at me.

1636
01:55:09,062 --> 01:55:11,231
I can't be her.

1637
01:55:11,315 --> 01:55:13,442
- Mom!
- Mom! Come on.

1638
01:55:13,525 --> 01:55:14,776
- Mom!
- It's Callie.

1639
01:55:14,860 --> 01:55:15,861
Is this real?

1640
01:55:15,944 --> 01:55:17,112
You have to come with us.

1641
01:55:17,195 --> 01:55:18,572
Come on, we gotta go.

1642
01:55:18,655 --> 01:55:20,216
Tiff, hey. Don't know
what's going on here,

1643
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:21,575
but I'm glad we found you.

1644
01:55:21,658 --> 01:55:23,011
- She got hit by a car!
- I know, it's crazy.

1645
01:55:23,035 --> 01:55:24,161
She was chasing after you.

1646
01:55:24,244 --> 01:55:25,638
They're casting her arm.
We gotta go.

1647
01:55:25,662 --> 01:55:27,039
Doctor said she's gonna be fine.

1648
01:55:27,122 --> 01:55:28,915
You have to come
with us to the hospital.

1649
01:55:28,999 --> 01:55:30,083
It's too late.

1650
01:55:30,167 --> 01:55:31,376
I understand.

1651
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:33,295
- Tiff, come on, let's go.
- Come on.

1652
01:55:39,801 --> 01:55:40,886
What's happening?

1653
01:55:42,971 --> 01:55:44,097
Neo was wrong.

1654
01:56:17,464 --> 01:56:18,548
Tiffany.

1655
01:56:22,135 --> 01:56:24,680
Tiffany, you have
to come with us.

1656
01:56:26,306 --> 01:56:27,683
Tiffany!

1657
01:56:29,976 --> 01:56:33,689
I wish you would
fucking stop calling me that.

1658
01:56:33,772 --> 01:56:35,315
I hate that name.

1659
01:56:36,817 --> 01:56:38,360
My name is Trinity

1660
01:56:38,443 --> 01:56:40,821
and you better
take your hands off of me.

1661
01:56:51,998 --> 01:56:52,999
Neo!

1662
01:56:53,500 --> 01:56:54,501
Trinity!

1663
01:56:55,669 --> 01:56:56,712
Oh, shit.

1664
01:56:58,004 --> 01:56:59,339
Get her out. Get her out!

1665
01:57:07,973 --> 01:57:11,268
Aye-yi-yi, what a mess.

1666
01:57:11,351 --> 01:57:14,020
I own that mistake.
Shouldn't have pressed.

1667
01:57:14,104 --> 01:57:17,107
Women used to be
so easy to control.

1668
01:57:17,190 --> 01:57:21,737
You know there's no way
I can let you two go free.

1669
01:57:25,157 --> 01:57:26,616
Cannot happen.

1670
01:57:29,786 --> 01:57:32,622
So, I guess it's deja vu
all over again.

1671
01:57:33,749 --> 01:57:35,542
She dies

1672
01:57:35,625 --> 01:57:37,002
and it's all your fault.

1673
01:57:38,545 --> 01:57:41,131
Lies, lies and more lies.

1674
01:57:41,882 --> 01:57:43,091
Smith?

1675
01:57:43,175 --> 01:57:44,301
What has the world come to

1676
01:57:44,384 --> 01:57:45,611
when you can't even
trust a program?

1677
01:57:45,635 --> 01:57:48,972
How...

1678
01:57:49,055 --> 01:57:51,808
Tom and I have more in common
than you know.

1679
01:57:51,892 --> 01:57:54,936
Once he got out, let's just say,

1680
01:57:55,771 --> 01:57:57,564
I was free to be me.

1681
01:58:05,238 --> 01:58:07,991
- Yeah!
- Trinity?

1682
01:58:56,373 --> 01:58:57,541
You ready?

1683
01:58:57,624 --> 01:58:58,917
Yeah.

1684
01:59:41,001 --> 01:59:42,460
Oh, no.

1685
01:59:43,837 --> 01:59:46,214
Destroy her. Destroy her!

1686
02:00:03,189 --> 02:00:04,190
No.

1687
02:00:10,030 --> 02:00:11,531
Stop them.

1688
02:00:37,182 --> 02:00:38,683
You think this is over?

1689
02:00:38,767 --> 02:00:40,769
Lockdown. Initiate swarm.

1690
02:00:49,736 --> 02:00:52,072
Here, our unexpected
alliance ends.

1691
02:00:53,740 --> 02:00:56,368
You know the difference
between us, Tom?

1692
02:00:56,451 --> 02:00:58,328
Anyone could have been you.

1693
02:00:58,411 --> 02:01:00,455
Whereas I've always been anyone.

1694
02:01:05,835 --> 02:01:07,337
What just happened?

1695
02:01:07,420 --> 02:01:08,588
What?

1696
02:01:10,590 --> 02:01:13,176
Oh, no! Move! Move!

1697
02:01:13,259 --> 02:01:14,302
Get the hell out of there!

1698
02:01:18,181 --> 02:01:20,141
- How bad?
- Like, all the bad.

1699
02:01:21,434 --> 02:01:22,894
Yeah, this is bad.

1700
02:01:24,270 --> 02:01:25,897
I don't suppose
you can still fly?

1701
02:01:36,282 --> 02:01:37,993
Yeah, that's not happening.

1702
02:02:03,727 --> 02:02:04,978
Neo! Get on.

1703
02:02:13,653 --> 02:02:15,447
Calliope! Take the wounded!

1704
02:02:15,530 --> 02:02:17,574
Everyone else,
we stay with them!

1705
02:02:34,632 --> 02:02:37,177
- How is she?
- Life signs are good.

1706
02:02:41,014 --> 02:02:42,474
Her signal's strong, Captain.

1707
02:02:51,357 --> 02:02:53,401
Well done, Captain.

1708
02:02:55,779 --> 02:02:57,655
All we need is a miracle.

1709
02:03:25,725 --> 02:03:26,768
I hate bots.

1710
02:03:33,066 --> 02:03:34,901
- Get us out of here!
- I'm trying!

1711
02:03:34,984 --> 02:03:36,986
The lockdown is tracking.
Swarm is everywhere.

1712
02:03:37,070 --> 02:03:38,270
Never seen anything like this.

1713
02:04:24,117 --> 02:04:26,286
Seq, what is that?

1714
02:04:31,291 --> 02:04:32,417
What's wrong?

1715
02:04:34,127 --> 02:04:35,628
What are you...

1716
02:04:43,178 --> 02:04:45,221
He's turning bots into bombs.

1717
02:05:17,670 --> 02:05:18,880
Shit!

1718
02:05:18,963 --> 02:05:19,964
Lexy?

1719
02:05:34,354 --> 02:05:35,563
Sheperd's in trouble.

1720
02:05:38,650 --> 02:05:40,443
Jack me in.

1721
02:05:40,526 --> 02:05:42,570
I can get you in.
I don't know if I can get you out.

1722
02:05:48,534 --> 02:05:50,245
No!

1723
02:06:03,591 --> 02:06:04,717
What are they doing?

1724
02:06:08,763 --> 02:06:10,431
Herding them into a kill zone.

1725
02:06:43,506 --> 02:06:44,841
Captain, you gotta hurry.

1726
02:06:44,924 --> 02:06:47,176
Hang on, Lex.

1727
02:06:51,389 --> 02:06:53,224
Lexy!

1728
02:07:35,475 --> 02:07:36,642
There they are!

1729
02:08:03,086 --> 02:08:04,253
Morpheus!

1730
02:08:08,132 --> 02:08:09,842
Lex.

1731
02:08:09,926 --> 02:08:11,803
- Bugsy.
- Hell yeah!

1732
02:08:12,762 --> 02:08:14,389
Seq, where's Neo?

1733
02:08:14,472 --> 02:08:16,099
It's bad. They're pinned.

1734
02:08:16,182 --> 02:08:17,266
Heading to a roof.

1735
02:09:26,544 --> 02:09:27,795
Nodal fibrillation is critical.

1736
02:09:27,879 --> 02:09:29,297
She'll die if we don't extract.

1737
02:10:10,296 --> 02:10:12,924
It's so beautiful.

1738
02:10:28,231 --> 02:10:29,941
I remember this.

1739
02:10:32,026 --> 02:10:34,237
I remember us.

1740
02:10:52,338 --> 02:10:54,340
My dream ended here.

1741
02:11:05,226 --> 02:11:06,811
We can't go back.

1742
02:11:08,938 --> 02:11:10,022
We won't.

1743
02:11:29,292 --> 02:11:30,668
Can they make the jump?

1744
02:12:01,741 --> 02:12:03,367
I'm not doing this.

1745
02:12:03,451 --> 02:12:04,827
Are you doing this?

1746
02:12:28,934 --> 02:12:30,019
Bye.

1747
02:13:51,058 --> 02:13:52,643
How dramatic.

1748
02:13:53,477 --> 02:13:54,770
"Tiffany"?

1749
02:13:54,854 --> 02:13:57,815
It was a private joke.

1750
02:13:57,898 --> 02:13:59,442
An amusement, that's all.

1751
02:13:59,525 --> 02:14:01,861
An amusement? Hmm.

1752
02:14:03,612 --> 02:14:05,781
Whoa.

1753
02:14:05,865 --> 02:14:07,283
Kind of like that?

1754
02:14:11,397 --> 02:14:13,900
Okay. Ow.

1755
02:14:14,373 --> 02:14:15,833
If you hated the name so much,

1756
02:14:15,916 --> 02:14:18,085
why did you heel like
a good little bitch so long?

1757
02:14:21,213 --> 02:14:23,466
Yeah. Definitely asked
for that.

1758
02:14:28,763 --> 02:14:30,723
Can't you control her?

1759
02:14:36,456 --> 02:14:38,166
That was for using children.

1760
02:14:43,046 --> 02:14:44,547
We have a few questions.

1761
02:14:44,631 --> 02:14:46,320
You tried to activate
the fail-safe.

1762
02:14:46,409 --> 02:14:47,884
The Suits tried.

1763
02:14:47,967 --> 02:14:50,261
Obviously, without control
of your source code,

1764
02:14:50,345 --> 02:14:51,861
I knew that was impossible.

1765
02:14:51,970 --> 02:14:54,015
So, why haven't
the Suits purged you?

1766
02:14:54,891 --> 02:14:56,630
Because I know the system.

1767
02:14:57,559 --> 02:14:59,283
I know human beings.

1768
02:15:00,096 --> 02:15:02,280
And I know you.

1769
02:15:04,884 --> 02:15:07,278
Right now, you're feeling good
about what you've done.

1770
02:15:07,362 --> 02:15:09,781
You should.
It was a victory. Bravo.

1771
02:15:10,545 --> 02:15:11,950
Now what?

1772
02:15:12,033 --> 02:15:14,691
You've come here to negotiate
some kind of deal?

1773
02:15:14,790 --> 02:15:16,369
You think you hold
all the cards,

1774
02:15:16,463 --> 02:15:18,862
because you can do whatever
you want in this world.

1775
02:15:18,960 --> 02:15:21,261
I say, go for it.

1776
02:15:21,374 --> 02:15:23,920
Remake it.
Knock yourselves out.

1777
02:15:24,003 --> 02:15:26,047
Paint the sky with rainbows.

1778
02:15:26,131 --> 02:15:27,298
But here's the thing.

1779
02:15:27,382 --> 02:15:30,352
The sheeple aren't
going anywhere.

1780
02:15:30,440 --> 02:15:31,850
They like my world.

1781
02:15:32,003 --> 02:15:34,753
They don't want this sentimentality.

1782
02:15:34,846 --> 02:15:36,770
They don't want freedom
or empowerment.

1783
02:15:36,858 --> 02:15:39,227
They want to be controlled.

1784
02:15:39,350 --> 02:15:41,351
They crave
the comfort of certainty.

1785
02:15:41,440 --> 02:15:44,180
And that means you two,
back in your pods,

1786
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:47,736
unconscious and alone,
just like them.

1787
02:15:52,060 --> 02:15:54,704
We're not here
to negotiate anything.

1788
02:15:54,794 --> 02:15:57,036
We were on our way
to remake your world.

1789
02:15:57,120 --> 02:15:58,553
Change a few things.

1790
02:15:58,650 --> 02:16:01,051
I kind of like the "paint the sky
with rainbows" idea.

1791
02:16:01,150 --> 02:16:03,330
Just remind people
what a free mind can do.

1792
02:16:03,420 --> 02:16:04,961
I forgot. It's easy to forget.

1793
02:16:05,044 --> 02:16:07,464
- He makes it easy.
- That, he does.

1794
02:16:07,647 --> 02:16:09,538
Something he should think about.

1795
02:16:10,759 --> 02:16:11,968
Before we got started,

1796
02:16:12,051 --> 02:16:14,358
we decided to stop by
to say thank you.

1797
02:16:15,111 --> 02:16:18,057
You gave us something
we never thought we could have.

1798
02:16:18,141 --> 02:16:19,517
And what is that?

1799
02:16:20,353 --> 02:16:21,903
Another chance.

1800
02:27:25,589 --> 02:27:28,227
Face reality, people.
Movies are dead.

1801
02:27:28,310 --> 02:27:29,929
Games are dead.

1802
02:27:30,182 --> 02:27:31,182
Narrative?

1803
02:27:31,279 --> 02:27:32,181
Dead.

1804
02:27:32,241 --> 02:27:34,271
Media is nothing
but neuro-trigger response

1805
02:27:34,351 --> 02:27:35,351
and viral conditioning.

1806
02:27:35,445 --> 02:27:36,986
Wait, what are you two
talking about?

1807
02:27:39,258 --> 02:27:40,433
Cat videos.

1808
02:27:41,222 --> 02:27:44,874
What we need is
a series of videos

1809
02:27:44,994 --> 02:27:47,324
that we call "The Catrix."
