RORY: <i>Leonard?</i>

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,301
I must be losing my mind.

5
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:12,145
The reason why Snart and I got on
so well is,

6
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,264
we trusted one another. We were friends.

7
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:17,602
Have either of you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

8
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,441
<i>The Spear could alter reality itself.</i>

9
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,150
We broke it into four separate pieces.

10
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,397
Mr. Hunter took one...

11
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,825
<i>And took the rest of you
to three different time periods.</i>

12
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,452
Which means the last piece unaccounted for
must be with your grandfather.

13
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,160
<i>Waverider</i> crew, we are now
the proud owners

14
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,952
of the last fragment
of the Spear of Destiny.

15
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,118
Back in 1942,
you have a destiny waiting for you.

16
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,581
Ask Ray what happens to your village.

17
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:38,084
<i>Ask him what happens to your daughter
and your granddaughter.</i>

18
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,167
<i>Then tell me you'll choose history
over your own family.</i>

22
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,599
Corning through, coming through!

23
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,646
According to this map,

24
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:57,649
Jesus' blood is somewhere over there.

25
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,647
The Spear is sensing the blood.

26
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,478
We won't last five minutes out there.

27
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,821
It's not too late to use it.

28
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,837
<i>It's hard to imagine that,

29
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,998
they're as powerful as God.

30
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:24,176
But, right now,
that's just a useless piece of wood.

31
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,677
It's not useless.

32
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,346
I know 10 different ways
to kill somebody with this.

33
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,849
(CLEARS THROAT) Not to mention,

34
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,518
it's great for scratching
in those hard-to-reach places.

35
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,347
Please don't tell me you used
the Spear of Destiny as a back scratcher.

36
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,808
Who said anything about my back?

37
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:42,145
Well, as Mr. Rory has demonstrated,
in the wrong hands,

38
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,025
this divine artifact

39
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,028
- can be put to truly horrific use.
- Yeah.

40
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,534
Which is why I called this meeting.

41
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:52,363
To figure out how to keep it
out of the Legion's hands.

42
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,207
Where's Nate?

43
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:59,378
Nathaniel said he wasn't
feeling up to socializing.

44
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,213
He said he'll go along
with whatever we decide.

45
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,715
What is there to decide?

46
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,377
We find the Legion and we steal back
their pieces of the Spear.

47
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,886
There is no need to find the Legion.

48
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,515
I know where they have been
operating out of.

49
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,059
Why keep it a secret?
Let's just go get them.

50
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:15,848
The reason why you've been
unable to locate.

51
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,430
Mr. Thawne and his partners all this time

52
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,228
is because they have been
operating outside of it.

53
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,729
- You lost me.
- Yeah. Me, too.

54
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:22,893
Three.

55
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,195
What is the one place
that exists outside of time?

56
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,111
- No way.
- Yes way.

57
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:32,203
We must return to the Vanishing Point.

58
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,382
- We're in position. Ray?
- RAY: <i>Ready.</i>

59
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,926
- Mick?
- RORY: Yeah.

60
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,128
Standby. Here.

61
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,135
The pieces of the Spear
call to each other.

62
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:56,727
We will be able to use these to locate
the pieces in the Legion's possession.

63
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,600
That's why we're separating
into two teams.

64
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,102
Mr. Jackson, shall we?

65
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,943
Are you sure bringing our pieces
of the Spear was a good idea?

66
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:08,106
- If this goes wrong...
- Then the Legion has the entire Spear.

67
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,781
So we have to be careful.

68
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,740
<i>On my way for Legion-watching.
Twenty seconds.</i>

69
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,579
And I thought
I'd seen the last of this place.

70
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,415
Let's not make it a habit.

71
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,515
Well, I appear to be getting
considerable vibrational energy from this.

72
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,646
My old friend, please forgive me.

73
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,238

74
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,526
Are you okay?

75
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,281
Am I okay?

76
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,323
Why wouldn't I be okay?

77
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,665
I miss him, too.

78
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,417
He blew himself up.

79
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,465
For what?

80
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,588
- So the rest of us could live.
- Idiot.

81
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,801
Mick, we gotta go.

82
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,425
Look, this is a heist.

83
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,892
We have to steal the other pieces
of the Spear and get out of here.

84
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,019
You think this is what Snart wants?

85
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,851
You waiting around
so that you can get caught?

86
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,529
Probably not.

Yes, it does.

00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,419
Jax and I may have
found the other pieces of the Spear.

95
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,865
Your try, Mr. Jackson.

96
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,150
(EXHALES)

97
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,321
What's your favorite candy?

98
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,748
Jelly beans. Why?

99
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,635
A little transmutation trick
me and Grey have been working on.

100
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:51,106
Both delicious and impressive,
Mr. Jackson.

101

- Get back to the ship.

104

- WHITE CANARY: Did you get it?
- GIDEON: Indeed.

106
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,241
Gideon, get us out of here.

107
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,931
No!

108
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:25,352
RORY: Piece of cake.
JAX: Whoa. You thought that was easy?

109
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:29,398
- RORY: I want a piece of cake and a beer.
- Later. Where is the Spear?

110
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,101
There

111
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,316
we

112
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,525
go.

113
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:40,279
- What is that?
- That's power.

114
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,569
The pieces of the Spear
are calling to each other.

115
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,404
They long to be whole.

116
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,662
- Yup. That just happened.
- That's remarkable.

117
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,749
The Spear must be composed of
some kind of magnetized compound

118
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,173
which acts as its own sealant.

119
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:58,677
No, no, no. Don't. Don't touch it.

120
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:02,757
Now that the Spear is whole,
it will try and lure each of us to use it.

121
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,387
It will draw on our weaknesses,

122
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,935
<i>our desires, our regrets.</i>

123
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:13,434
It will promise each of us that we can
remake the world just as we want it.

124
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,109
What's wrong with that?

125
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,775
What? Come on.

126
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,983
- You're all thinking it.
- Absolute power corrupts, Mr. Rory,

127
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:25,534
even when used with the best intentions,
which is why I'd attempted to destroy it.

128
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,618
Maybe you didn't try hard enough.

129
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,495
- No, no, no. No, no, no.
- Mick, don't!

130
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,582
- Not on the ship, bro.
- He said "destroy," so I destroyed.

131
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,957
AMAYA:
<i>It's not destroyed. It's not even charred.</i>

132
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:40,256
Any harm brought upon the Spear
is temporary. It will always heal itself.

133
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,337
That's why you had
to keep the pieces separated.

134
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,765
Yes. Accomplished with much effort
and numerous explosives.

135
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,844
Wait a sec.
There's something written on it.

136
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,769
RIP: <i>That's odd.</i>

137
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,807
That wasn't there before.

138
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,767
It must have been revealed by the flames.

139
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,152
See, I did help.

(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

143
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,076
Yes. But what does that mean?

00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,079
"Born of blood, undone by blood."

145
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,960
And what does that mean?

146
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,251
Look, we finally have the Spear.

147
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,881
We just need to figure out
what to do with it.

148
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,805
- We need to determine a way to protect it.
- You don't.

149
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,299
You destroy it.

150
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,595
Yes, well, I've tried that, Dr. Heywood.
It is impervious to destruction.

151
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:32,804
No, it's not.

152
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:37,400
"Born of blood, undone by blood."

153
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,694
Pretend we're not historians.

154
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,989
"Born of blood" because the blood
of Christ gave the Spear power.

155
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,736
"Undone by blood"

156
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,820
because the blood of Christ
is the only thing that can destroy it.

157
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,450
Now you're talking.

- Don't you dare, Gideon.

159
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,622
Look, throughout history,

160
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:59,673
there are certain moments
whose integrity are crucial.

161
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,834
The birth, life, and death of Jesus Christ
are all such moments.

162
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,421
Any interference, no matter how minuscule,

163
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,889
could have disastrous consequences
for the time stream.

164
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,967
We cannot go there. Ever.

165
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:14,013
Look, I understand that. But if this is
the only way to destroy the Spear...

166
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,472
It's not.

167
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,899
It's not the only way.

168
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,311
Now, I'm not a historian,

169
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:25,775
but I can't imagine it's possible to
obtain the blood of Christ without Christ.

170
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,528
Actually, it is.

171
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:35,455
I did a year abroad at Oxford
while working on my master's.

172
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,581
And in between dating this girl, Wendy,

173
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,665
I remember reading this unpublished paper

174
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,842
by this classic scholar
from early 20th century.

175
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:48,764
Now, this scholar had
this far-fetched theory about Sir Gawain

176
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:52,684
that the knight returned from
the Crusades, not with the Holy Grail,

177
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,012
but with something far more valuable.

178
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,223
- The blood of Christ.
- Exactly.

179
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,856
Now, the paper went on to theorize
that Gawain had a vial

180
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,859
of this precious substance on him
up to his death

181
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:08,067
and was buried with it somewhere
in the north of France.

182
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,449
Just "somewhere in the north of France"?
It's a big area.

183
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,703
I know. But if anyone, and I mean anyone,
knows where to start looking,

184
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,534
it's this guy.

185
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:23,757
(READING) <i>"The Burden of the Purest Heart,
Sir Gawain's Secret Treasure."</i>

186

Written by...

187
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:31,215
- John Ronald Reuel Tolkien.
- You're kidding.

188
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,513
Guy who wrote <i>The Hobbit</i>
and <i>The Lord of the Rings.</i>

189
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,971
<i>John Tolkien was in the north of France
in 1916 during the Battle of the Somme</i>

190
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,016
<i>as a second lieutenant in World War I.</i>

191
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:44,398
Well, looks like we're going back to war.

- Don't test me, Damien!

195
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,074
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

196
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,244
You sent me and Malcolm off
to find the Kalabros manuscript

197
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,625
while the Legends managed to
abscond with the Spear of Destiny.

198
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,460
I should have that zombie speedster
you're so afraid of eat your brain!

199
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,419
No.

200
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:13,757
No, this is actually
a positive development.

201
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,509
Or maybe he already has.

202
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,261
With the entire Spear
in the Legends' possession,

203
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,430
we no longer have to keep
going after it piecemeal.

204
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,766
I'm a glass-half-full kind of guy...

205
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,809
The Legendary idiots
won't be able to use it.

206
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,611
They'll either try to hide it
or destroy it.

207
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,613
And when they do, we'll be there,

208
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,861
waiting.

209
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,447
- No.

<i>Not just us.</i>

211
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,946
I'm not sure
if you're keeping score, Eobard,

212
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,327
but we're losing.

213
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,375
So it's time to change the game.

214
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,382
All right. We gotta be careful.

215
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,848
The Battle of the Somme is one of
the bloodiest conflicts in human history.

216
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,301
- Sounds terrible. I'm in.
- We're all in.

217
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,636
It's not gonna be easy finding Tolkien
in this mess.

218
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,224
GIDEON: <i>According to military records,</i>

219
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,815

<i>and was transferred to a first aid outpost
to await transportation back to Britain.</i>

221
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,486
Perfect. Amaya, take the Backstreet Boys,
intercept Tolkien, find out what he knows,

222
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,743
- send him on his way.
- So what you want us to do?

223
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,534
Guard the Spear. Somebody has to be
with the Spear at all times.

224
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,866
Indeed.
Now that the Spear has been reconstituted,

225
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,667
the stakes have never been greater.

226
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,086
Which is why
I should stay on the ship, too.

00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:29,666
I'm fine.

229

All right. In that case, go with the guys.

230

They could use the adult supervision.

231

and we need your help.

311
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,976
In your paper, <i>The Burden
of the Purest Heart,</i> you described

312
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,484
- the final resting place of Sir Gawain.
- I never actually published that paper.

313
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,861
- How did you...
- It's hard to explain. But we need to know

314
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,318
- where the knight is buried.
- You abducted me

315
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,995
from the middle of a battlefield
to ask about an old myth?

316
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,370
There is a war on, you fools.

317
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,997
And I imagine that the view
from the trenches is pretty bleak.

318
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,162
- It looks to me like the end of the world.
- But it's not.

319
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,089
Believe me, this darkness will pass.

320
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,384
You speak as someone
who's seen the future.

321
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,386
Haven't all students of history?

322
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,092
Those who suffer, heal.

323
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,931
Everything destroyed gets rebuilt.

324
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,676
And our towers grow
a little taller every time.

325
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:15,728
I should like to believe you.

326
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,848
Tell me, why do you
seek the grave of Gawain?

327
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,766
Uh...

328
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,230
It's a long story.

329
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,063
- I enjoy long stories.
- Yeah, he does.

330
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,522
(CLEARS THROAT)

331
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,363
- In short, my fellow travelers and I...
- Fellowship, if you will.

332
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,241
We are on a journey to destroy an object.

333
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:36,040
One which would bring the bearer
unimaginable power.

334
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,038
Have you heard of the Spear of Destiny?

335
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:42,794
I came across numerous obscure
references to it in my studies.

336
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,383
Of course, such a divine artifact
could never actually exist.

337
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,800
But it does.

338
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,422
And we need your help to end its threat.

339
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,553
I left all my research at Oxford.

340
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,764
To help you, I would need a vast library.

341
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,812
Well, lucky for you, we brought one.

342
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,442
How did it go out there?

343
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,613
Amaya?

344
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,075
It was worse than any nightmare.

345
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,086
You've seen this before.

346
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,589
I mean, World War II
is definitely a situation

347
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:32,013
where the sequel
was worse than the original.

348
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,177
What changed?

349
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,761
I had Gideon show me
the historical record.

350
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,103
My future.

351
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,269
How much did you see?

352
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,360
My village burned to the ground.

353
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,948
My daughter turned into a refugee

354
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,450
and her daughter turned into an orphan.

355
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,663
Seeing the battlefield today
just made it so real.

356
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,625
I'm so sorry.

357
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,630
But, if it helps,

358
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,675
from what my sister told me,

359
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:14,840
despite all the pain and suffering
your granddaughter will endure,

360
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,477
she turns out to be
a pretty remarkable person.

361
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,562
A hero.

362
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,993
PROFESSOR STEIN:
Don't even think about it!

363
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,375
That is not a scratcher of any variety.

364
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:44,501
What happened to your face?

365
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,378
I saw Snart again.

366
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:49,548
More likely you took
a nasty blow on the battlefield.

367
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,172
Perhaps you're suffering
some minor brain damage,

368
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,335
or, at least, more brain damage.

369
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,005
Snart did this!

370
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,347
I believe you.

371
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,175
You do?

372
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,686
Of course not.
I just don't want you to hurt me.

373
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,180
But, given our trip
to the Vanishing Point,

374
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,190
it would make sense
that he'd be in your thoughts.

375
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,393
Mick! Let him go.

376
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,108
You're going to church.

377
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,940
I'm not the religious type.

378
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,863
Tolkien's located Gawain's burial place.

379
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,530
RIP: <i>It's in a cathedral in Amiens.</i>

380
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,280
If it's still there.
The war's already passed through.

381
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,282
- Are you sure you're up for this?
- Yes.

382
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,913
Snart,

383
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,376
he's in my head, right?

384
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,055
TOLKIEN: The church of Amiens.

385
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,887
Built in the 1600s.

386
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,476
For centuries, it was a shelter, a refuge.

387
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,263
Now, just a place
for marauding armies to squat.

388
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:47,561
Look closely, but be careful.

389
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,896
Returning knights of the Crusades
were known to hide their relics,

390
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,068
so only the worthy could find them.

391
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:56,115
They set traps for those
who aren't so worthy.

392
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,740
Aw. They're so close, they're finishing
each other's dire warnings.

393
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,117
I think I found something.

394
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,115
(GASPS)

395
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,917
This has gotta be worth a fortune.

396
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,083
- Gold.
- Yeah, don't bite the relics.

397
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,590
- Give me that!
- And don't steal the relics.

398
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:16,427
Now, if I'm not mistaken,
the inscription's written in...

399
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,593
Proto-Celtic.

400
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:26,096
It says, "Follow the outlier,
then push further still."

401
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,018
But what is the outlier?

402
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,400
Three rubies...

403
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,193
One emerald.

404
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:38,942
I think I found our outlier.

405
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,239
Then, "push further still."

406
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,242
The structure's been damaged
from all the fighting.

407
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,464
Sir Gawain, I presume.

408
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:01,222
Hey. Look, on his shield,
it's an engraving.

409
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:02,890
SNART: <i>Pretty pathetic,</i>

410
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,434
if you ask me.

411
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,226
Mr. Snart?

412
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,983
Wait. You can see him?

413
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,520
You're supposed to be dead.

414
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:20,533
Yeah, they told me all about how
I get soft and die for you losers.

415
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,948
- I didn't believe them.
- Believe who?

416
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:27,328
Well, if that's not an entrance line,
I don't know what is.

417
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,791
What is going on here?

418
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,670
The Legion must have
traveled back in time,

419
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,998
picked up Mr. Snart
before he joined the Legends.

420
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:39,710
He told us all about your plan
on how you're going to destroy the Spear.

421
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,382
Thanks for the tip, Mick.

422
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,011
I didn't think he was real.

423
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,638
No, no, no. No need to defend yourself.

424
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,186
Actually, there is.

425
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,346
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

426
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,186
Get behind me!

427
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,527
What is this madness?

(MEN GROANING)

00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,072

(SCREAMS)

431
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,707
What are you doing? We gotta go!

432
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,334
Not without the engraving.

433
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:22,219
You actually care about these losers.

434
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,922
Mick! Come on, let's go!

435
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:29,177
Because I guarantee
they don't care about you, Mick.

436
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:34,849
So Snart's alive.

437
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,730
And he's working with the Legion.

438
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,736
Well, it's not just the Legion.
Is it, Mick?

439
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,230
You got something to say to me?

440
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,946
You told him about our plan
to destroy the Spear.

441
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,909
Well, I thought I was seeing things.

442
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,412
Whether Mr. Snart was
a hallucination or not,

443
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,244
the fact that you told him
about our plan speaks volumes.

444
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,080
Volumes of what, Professor?

445
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:54,414
I think what Martin is trying to say

446
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:58,748
is that he's worried that if it came down
to a decision between Leonard and us...

447
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,209
You would choose Snart in a heartbeat.

448
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,173
Yeah, I would. He's a friend.

449
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:06,389
And you guys ain't exactly
being friendly right now.

450
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:07,764
Can you blame us?

451
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:11,139
We're concerned
that your blunder with Mr. Snart

452
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:15,765
confirms that you haven't truly
given up your roots as a thug.

453
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:20,736
Is that what you think, Captain?

454
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:24,114
Mick, we just need you to be careful.

455
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,607
Why?

456
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,158
Oh, I see.

457
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:34,826
In your eyes,
I'm always gonna be a criminal.

458
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,506
This is fascinating.

459
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:45,298
Apparently, the Spear will glow
in the presence of divine blood.

460
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,346
Yeah, and it also revealed a message
when Mick lit it on fire.

461
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,637
A secret only fire can tell.
(CHUCKLES)

462
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,800
How marvelous.

463
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,811
So, unless you wanna wander all over
France waiting for this thing to light up,

464
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,972
I suggest we figure out this map.

465
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,776
You okay?

466
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,527
I'm afraid I suffer from what is known
in the trenches as shell shock.

467
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:09,486
Although some would prefer
to call it common cowardice.

468
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:13,197
Said the guy who dodged bullets
to get a grave rubbing. Give me a break.

469
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:16,037
Proof I belong in a library
and not on a...

470
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:19,954
Battlefield.

471
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:24,170
I know where we have to go
to destroy the Spear.

472
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,547
Where?

473
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,507
The middle of hell on Earth.

474
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:30,847
(HAUNTING VOICES BECKONING)

475
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:41,851
You hear them, too, huh?

476
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:43,565
I'm sorry?

477
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:46,481
The voices.

478
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,024
What's the Spear saying to you?

479
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,860
It's not the Spear. It's my mother.

480
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,745
Her voice, at least.

481
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,991
She's begging me to help our people,

482
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,544
to keep our family and our legacy safe.

483
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,007
She wants me to change my destiny.

484
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,881
Maybe the Spear can do that for her.

485
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,756
A chance to rewrite reality.
Who wouldn't be tempted?

486
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:15,763
What do you hear?

487
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:19,726
My parents.

488
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,061
What are they saying?

489
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:25,227
"Don't play with fire, Mick."

490
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,897
SARA: <i>Mick, Amaya, I need you in here.</i>

491
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:35,450
So it looks like our historians
have made a discovery.

492
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:38,449
According to this map,
the blood of Christ is hidden

493
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,121
right smack in the middle
of no-man's-land.

494
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:43,371
Great. Right in the center of
the bloodiest battle in human history.

495
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,798
Even if we were to make it
through the terrain unscathed,

496
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,417
there's still the issue
of the blood's precise location.

497
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,626
That's the good news.

498
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:53,097
Just as the Spear acted
as a divining rod for its pieces,

499
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,758
it glows when it's close to Jesus' blood.

500
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:59,269
But one cannot simply walk
into the middle of a war zone.

501
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:00,475
What if we convince both sides

502
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,974
to stop fighting long enough
for us to get in there?

503
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,395
AMAYA: <i>That'll never work.</i>

504
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,144
But there is another way.

505
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:08,820
<i>We can rewrite reality.</i>

506
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,608
Eliminate the threat of the Legion
once and for all time.

507
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,775
No, we can't.

508
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:14,985
This is just a tool.

509
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,408
In the right hands, in our hands,
we can use it for good.

510
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:21,459
The Spear has more power
than any of us could possibly wield.

511
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:24,621
I know a thing or two about
wielding mystical artifacts.

512
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:27,335
I can control it.

513
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:30,130
(SCOFFS)
Look, a totem is one thing, but that...

514
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,839
That is more powerful than
anything any of us have seen.

515
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,302
She said she can handle it.

516
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,762
Mick, not now.

517
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:41,307
Amaya, look, you don't know
what the Spear can do to you.

518
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,272
Having the ability
to rewrite your own reality,

519
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:46,817
it's too much temptation for anyone.

520
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,403
That's why we have to do this.

521
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:50,650
The hard way.

522
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,650
All right. "Hard way" it is.

523
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,027
I'm in.

524
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,864
Yeah, I'm down.

525
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:02,783
It's the right thing to do.

526
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,672
Obviously, I've been outvoted.

527
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,167
I will help you whatever way I can.

528
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,629
But I think you're making a huge mistake.

00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,192
According to this map,

533
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,070
Jesus' blood is somewhere over there!

534
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:37,117
The Spear is sensing the blood.

535
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:38,990
We won't last five minutes out there.

536
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:41,204
It's not too late to use it.

Commander, if we may
request a moment of your time.

We are in the midst of battle.
There are no moments.

Lieutenant Tolkien.

542
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,094
I was told you were suffering
from trench fever.

543
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,677
And you better be.
Else, I'll report you as a deserter.

544
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,353
Captain Hunter, Royal Army Medical Corps.

545
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:08,398
Now, I can assure you
that this man is no deserter.

546
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:10,643
As such, we have an urgent entreaty.

547
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:13,274
We need you to contact German command
and request a ceasefire.

548
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,775
How dare you waste my time?

549
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,278
- We're on the verge of taking Guillemont.
- Guillemont can wait.

550
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,577
There is a greater battle at hand.
One that concerns all of humanity.

551
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,571
<i>Both sides must lay down their arms,</i>

552

Twenty-three hundred dead.

<i>Nearly 8,000 wounded.</i>

All has already been lost.

Perhaps, our friends on the German side
are having more luck.

559
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,942
You wish for me to order our artillery
to stop shelling the enemy.

560
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:58,990
Just long enough for us to rescue
the wounded from the battlefield.

561
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,034
And so the British can rescue theirs.

(EXPLOSION BLASTS)

563

I will order our batteries to stop firing
when they stop firing on us.

564

It seems neither side wants
to give up the fight.

We don't have time.
Not with the Legion on our tails.

566
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,292
We have to push forward.

Now is our best chance to move.

It's all on us now.

Watch each other's backs,
and we'll make it to the ship alive.

That way.

582
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,795
Sir, you need to understand

583
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:46,473
that this is one problem
that cannot be solved with violence.

584
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,973
Okay, maybe a spot of violence.

Well, if he's not gonna give the order
for the ceasefire, we'll have to.

- Three megahertz.

between us run deep,</i>

<i>that they may very well be insurmountable.</i>

596
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:38,601
But I implore both of our armies,

597
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,528
<i>for this one moment,</i>

598

<i>to come together as allies

599

so that the injured may be removed
from the field of battle.

<i>But today is not that day.</i>

we might just save it.

Though I have to admit, negotiating a
ceasefire in the middle of a World War?

615

Pretty impressive.

- SARA: What are you doing?
- Hey. Man, we're your friends.

624
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,026
I don't have friends.

625

But he does have partners.

626
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:55,491
So what do you say, partner?

00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:58,574
Mick, you're better than this.

628
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,325
No, actually, you're not.

629
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:03,707
<i>They may pretend to believe in you
as long as they can use you.</i>

630
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:05,710
<i>But they'll just as soon let you die.</i>

631
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,544
Same as they did me.

632
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,001
He's messing with your head, man.

633
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,838
Ever since I've been on that ship,
you people have been trying to change me.

634
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:14,138
That's not true, Mick.

635
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,007
But guess what.

636
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:19,728
There are things about me
I wanna change, too.

637
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,314
Steel up, Nate. Stop him.

638
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,860
He does, you and animal chick die,
but we still keep the Spear.

639
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,405
And we're gonna make
all kinds of fun changes.

640
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:31,652
You bastard!

641
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,199
Come with me.

642
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:39,957
The Spear can help us fix
your messed-up future and my past.

643
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:43,748
Never.

644
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,214
If you think we're gonna let you
walk out of here with the Spear...

645
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,170
You're right.
You know, we could use a distraction.

646
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:53,424
I hereby declare
that the armistice is over.

647
00:36:58,091 --> 00:36:59,092
Get down!

648
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,733
That's just great.
Now, we're all gonna die.

649
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:12,405
Mick, have I ever pulled a heist
without a getaway plan?

650
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:13,898
(EXPLOSION BLASTING)

651
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,827
I wish things
could have been different, Sara.

652
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:24,617
Get down.

653
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,246
Jax, we need an extraction.

654
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:28,455
Go!

655
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,915
Copy that. I'm inbound.

656
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:07,911
Okay, opening the cargo bay doors.

657
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:12,545
Let's go!

658
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:16,836
Amaya.

659
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,675
Mick's gone. It's over.

660
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:33,270
We never should've set foot
on that battlefield.

661
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,446
We didn't have a choice.

662
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,194
That's not true.

663
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,905
There was a choice,
and you made the wrong one.

664
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,782
<i>And now the Spear of Destiny,</i>

665
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,954
the most powerful weapon
in all of history,

666
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,375
is in the hands of not one,
but four psychopaths.

667
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,293
Don't forget Mr. Rory.

668
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:50,495
That's right.

669
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,456
We trusted him, and he screwed us over.

670
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,258
Did we trust him?

671
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,088
(SCOFFS)
I mean, admit it. We never really did.

672
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,554
And he picked up on it.

673
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:04,719
Yeah, apparently,
Mr. Rory's not entirely stupid.

674
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:06,599
We lied to him.

675
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:10,440
Not Mick. Tolkien.
We told him there was hope,

676
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,735
that humanity will light its way,

677
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,731
but we just ended up
dumping him back in the trenches.

678
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,692
We have to restore time.

679
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,785
Although I suppose
it doesn't really much matter

680
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,579
now that reality itself is threatened.

681
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:30,039
Maybe not.

682
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:37,084
Last time I checked, there was not
an on-off button on the Spear.

683
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:40,386
What if...

684
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,430
What if they don't know how to use it?

685
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:45,926
I have to say,

686
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:47,848
well done.

687
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,392
I've heard of your skills
as a thief before,

688
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:53,396
but this has taken it
to a whole new level.

689
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,227
Truly masterful.

690
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,233
Getting one of them to steal it for us.

691
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,064
He was never really one of them.

692
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,774
Were you, Mick?

693
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,486
I thought you said
the Spear belonged to us.

694
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,196
There's plenty of power to go around.

695
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,247
Thanks for waiting for me.

696
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,208
Seems like I missed a few things.

697
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,625
You found the Kalabros.

698
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,794
The word of God himself.

699
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,915
It's like the owner's manual
for the Spear of Destiny.

700
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,545
It wasn't easy to find.

701
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,797
Now what?

702
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:25,386
Grab hold.

703
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,896
