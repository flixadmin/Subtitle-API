{\an8}Thank you, Officer,
you can wait outside.

{\an8}Since you fired
District Attorney Armand,

33

{\an8}the DA's office has brought in

Okay, well, that could be a good thing.

00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,408

Should I have heard of her?

38
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,831
[Felicity] She took down Intergang
and Bruno Mannheim.

39
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,292
{\an8}She's prosecuted
CEOs and serial killers,

40
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,127
{\an8}and she has CIA-caliber investigators

anything and everything.

[Jean] She called me last night
and she offered a plea.

00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,177
Single count of
first-degree manslaughter...

45
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,429
That doesn't sound so bad.

46

...with a 15-year minimum sentence.

47

That sounds bad.
We're not taking that, right?

{\an8}Well, I'm planning
on pleading the Fifth.

59

{\an8}Did you have a different
amendment in mind?

60
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,711
{\an8}We can't plead the Fifth
without looking guilty.

61
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,880
{\an8}We are guilty. We are vigilantes,

62
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,506
{\an8}and we know Oliver is the Green Arrow.

63
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,800
{\an8}Which is why we gotta lie
through our teeth.

00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,303
{\an8}And we gotta be convincing.
We gotta have our story straight.

{\an8}Hoss, you wanna weigh in on this?
You've been real quiet.

{\an8}Why?

67
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,893
{\an8}It's not like I'm gonna have to testify.

68

you have FOMO

69

00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,981
{\an8}Yeah, I have major FOMO. Don't I rate?

00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,608
{\an8}You know, maybe you're just
so much better

{\an8}at maintaining your secret identity
than the rest of us.

73

{\an8}Guys, can we be real for a second here?

74
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,614
{\an8}I mean, Oliver's facing life in prison.

75
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,533
{\an8}Yeah, and I guess I'm just
a little bit surprised that you care.

76
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,745
Not that I think you actually
want Oliver to go to prison, Rene,

77
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,497
{\an8}-but come on...
-Oliver's a jerk.

78
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,124
{\an8}My position on that hasn't changed.

79
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,211
{\an8}But what also hasn't changed
is the position that he's in

80
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,337
{\an8}right now.

81
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,966
{\an8}He's in it because of me.

82
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,470
{\an8}[sighs] You're right.

83
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,097
{\an8}And I think we can all agree,

84
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,224
{\an8}no matter what our feelings are
about Oliver,

85
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,976
{\an8}none of us would want him
to go to prison.

86
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,227
{\an8}Am I right?

87
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,605
Damn right.

88
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,362
From where I'm sitting,
it's pretty simple.

89
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,197
They've got the wrong guy.

90
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:45,076
Oliver Queen isn't the Green Arrow
any more than I am.

91
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,787
And for the record,
I'm not the Green Arrow.

92
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,414
There appears to be
a fair amount of evidence

93
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,207
to suggest the former mayor is guilty.

94
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,333
What evidence?

95
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,585
That photo from several months ago?
That was doctored.

96
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,878
And I don't know
who they're going to find

97
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,672
to say Oliver's the Green Arrow,
but they'll be lying.

98
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,799
-You sound pretty sure of that.
-I am.

99
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,719
I'm the guy that arrested Oliver
six years ago, remember?

100
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,971
I watched him pass a polygraph.

101
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,308
-He's not the Green Arrow.
-Do you know who is?

102
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,435
I got a few guesses. [chuckles]

103
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,895
-Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
-You're welcome.

104
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,815
Oh, hey.

105
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,233
Sorry, they told me
I could come in here.

106
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,402
Uh, no, that's fine. Right?
We're finished.

107
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,279
Actually, maybe we could just
get some B-roll.

108
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,199
As the Black Canary, you have to know
who the Green Arrow is.

109
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:26,868
I do.

110
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,205
And I'll testify to it
if they subpoena me.

111
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,791
Happy? Got your sound bite?

112
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,002
Good.

113
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,882
This looks bigger than the O.J. trial.

114
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,884
How would you know?
You were in, like, fourth grade.

115
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,510
Yeah, but I watch <i>American Crime Story.</i>

116
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,137
I guess John decided not to show.

117
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,181
I knew he was pissed,
but I didn't know he was that pissed.

118
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,183

119

So many reporters outside.

126
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,578
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

-You okay?
-I always thought

-He'd get hurt.
-I know.

130
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,295
Okay, he's been through something
like this before. I mean...

131
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,090
Not exactly like this,
but something, and...

-[cameras clicking]
-It's gonna be okay.

133

[bailiff] All rise.

134
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,307
Docket number 11-19-41-73,

135
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,559
<i>The People v. Oliver Jonas Queen.</i>

136
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,478
Status of the parties?

137
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,854
Ready for trial.

138
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:38,397
Ready for trial.

139
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,566
Then let's begin.

140
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,531
Oliver Queen is a hero.

141
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,533
He is.

142
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,327
He's saved this city more times
than anybody can count.

143
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,540
But he's done it all from behind a mask,

144
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,709
so that he could take the law
into his own hands.

145
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:03,464
In fact, he's taken as many lives
as he's saved.

146
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,467
So, yes, Oliver Queen is a hero,

147
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,345
but that doesn't mean
he's not also a criminal.

148
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,478
[Jean] Three weeks ago,
Oliver Queen was mayor of this city.

149
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,732
In that time, he has gone
from being under indictment,

150
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,819
to impeachment, to being on trial.

151
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,405
How?

152
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,907
How could everything go wrong
so quickly for him?

153
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,326
I think intuitively you know the answer.

154
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:33,744
Corruption.

155
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,330
It runs through this city like a cancer,

156
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:41,252
compromising some city officials
while discrediting others, like...

157
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,546
Like the defendant.

158
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,674
Even the anti-vigilante law
that he is being charged under

159
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,177
is the work of the corrupt men and women

160
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,762
who are holding our city in their grip.

161
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,265
This may sound like a conspiracy theory,

162
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,601
but at the conclusion of this trial,

163
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,645
I'm going to ask you
what is most likely.

164
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,732
That our city's government
has been compromised,

165
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,652
or that we elected a superhero
as our mayor?

166
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,866
Ms. Van Owen,
please call your first witness.

167
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,993
The people call John Diggle.

168
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:19,790
Where is he?

169
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,628
A bench warrant will issue
for Mr. Diggle.

170
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,755
If he's not made to appear
within one hour,

171
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,924
he'll be held in contempt of this court.

172
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,092
Is your next witness ready?

173
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,511
Yes, Your Honor.

174
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,598
Please state your name
and occupation for the record.

175
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,475
Dr. Eliza Schwartz.

176
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,561
I'm an attending physician
at Starling General Hospital.

177
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,147
Thank you, Dr. Schwartz.

178
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,358
And you've had an occasion
to treat the defendant?

179
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,985
-Yes.
-For various suspicious injuries,

180
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,070
is that correct?

181
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,573
I can't say without violating
doctor-patient confidentiality.

182
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,741
I understand.

183
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,661
Then let me direct your attention,
please, to an incident

184
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,996
when Mr. Queen was not a patient.

185
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,582
On the night of April 6th, 2016,

186
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,668
the Green Arrow
brought in the Black Canary.

187
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,671
And according to your records,
she had been stabbed...

188
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,173
Objection. Is there a question
in our future?

189
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,591
Yes.

190
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,594
That night, you were close enough
to the Green Arrow

191
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,179
to determine his identity.

192
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:19,350
So my question is whose face
did you see that night?

193
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,144
I was focused
on saving Ms. Lance's life.

194
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:25,273
I wasn't the least bit concerned
with who the Green Arrow was.

195
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,983
<i>Concerned or not,</i>

196
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,860
<i>whose face did you see
underneath that mask?</i>

197
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,363
You know, it's not bad.
Oliver might just pull this one off.

198
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,031
You want to put money on that?

199
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,326
Diaz wants Oliver in prison.

200
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,288
You'd think he'd want to kill him.
I mean, at least try.

201
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,915
What, so the Green Arrow
can become a martyr?

202
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,625
-Diaz is smarter than that.
-[cell phone ringing]

203
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,461
I have to go.

204
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,171
Diaz yank your leash?

205
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,590
Something like that.

206
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,133
You know, you don't have to go.

207
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,053
First step to standing up to him
is to stand up to him.

208
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,681
Sounds like the first step
to getting myself killed.

209
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,601
Not for nothing,
but apart from your face,

210
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,770
there's one thing
you got in common with my Laurel.

211
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,063
And what's that?

212
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,150
Neither of you would let
somebody else tell you what to do

213
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,359
or have you running scared.

214
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:13,195
You think your Laurel
would stand up to Diaz?

215
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,280
I know it.

216
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,158
Well, maybe if she were a little smarter

217
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,410
she wouldn't have gotten herself killed.

218
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,375
It's been one hour.

219
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,169
Mr. Diggle having not yet appeared,

220
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,379
-he is hereby in contempt of this court.
-[DOOR OPENS]

221
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,632
I'm sorry I'm late, Your Honor.

222
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,718
I had some business to take care of.

223
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,136
Out of town.

224
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,265
Oliver Queen is not the Green Arrow.

225
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,185
I can't make it any plainer than that.

226
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,895
How can you be so sure?

227
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:49,273
From 2012 to 2016,
I was his personal bodyguard.

228
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,276
If he was running around
with a bow and arrow,

229
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:53,944
I would have known it.

230
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,155
-But would you admit knowing it?
-Why wouldn't I?

231
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,616
Because you were aiding
and abetting a vigilante?

232
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,825
I absolutely was not.

233
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,787
In fact, I had very limited
interaction with Oliver Queen.

234
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,038
How can that be?

235
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,123
You were head of his security
at City Hall.

236
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,750
And my job was to keep him safe.

237
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,295
And that included
not jumping off of rooftops.

238
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,631
Mr. Diggle, you can't even keep
yourself safe.

239
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:17,426
I mean, in the past four years
you've been abducted by Damien Darhk.

240
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,303
Your own child was also kidnapped.

241
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,806
You were hospitalized for nerve damage

242
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,141
caused by severe trauma.

243
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,768
Mr. Diggle,

244
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,980
either you travel in some
very dangerous circles,

245
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,942
or you have the worst luck ever.

246
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,153
Who was Sean Sonus?

247
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,863
-[Jean] Objection. Relevance?
-Overruled.

248
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,490
-Your Honor...
-I said overruled.

249
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,784
Answer the question.

250
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,703
He was a drug dealer I investigated

251
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,872
while undercover in the
Central City Police Department.

252
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,458
And he was shot and killed
in Hub City last year.

253
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,336
Your Honor, I renew my objection
as to relevance.

254
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,130
Well, if Ms. Drake is a murderer,

255
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,715
it would certainly undermine
her credibility now, wouldn't it?

256
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,717
[Judge] Objection overruled.

257
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,429
Again. Sit down, Ms. Loring.

258
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,349
So, you were not with
the Central City Police Department

259
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,226
when Mr. Sonus was killed.
Is that correct?

260
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,061
-That's right.
-Did you murder him?

261
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,689
-Your Honor!
-Answer the question.

262
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,322
I'm exercising my Fifth Amendment right

263
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,699
against self-incrimination.

264
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,284
[crowd murmuring]

265
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,045
You beckoned?

266
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,340
I saw something interesting on TV.

267
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,219
<i>And I'll testify to it
if they subpoena me.</i>

268
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,514
Is there a problem?

269
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,850
Not yet, there isn't.

270
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,061
You know, this would move a lot faster

271
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,771
if you would stop talking in circles.

272
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,983
You were given
the gift-wrapped opportunity

273
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,402
to say that Oliver Queen

274
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,029
was the Green Arrow.

275
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,116
You didn't do it, baby.

276
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,784
I wasn't aware I was supposed to.

277
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,705
Well, that's why we're here,
having this little meeting.

278
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,583
So we can set expectations.

279
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:16,712
The prosecution is holding you
as a rebuttal witness,

280
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,672
so when they call you,

281
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,133
you're gonna be the final nail
in the coffin.

282
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,886
If I go in and try
and convince a courtroom

283
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,179
that I'm Laurel Lance,

284
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,223
I'm gonna get made.

285
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,434
Maybe you're right.

286
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,355
You don't have a poker face.

287
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:38,817
For example...

288
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,321
The way you've been acting lately,

289
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,700
ever since I torched Federico
on that rooftop...

290
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,539
You've been keeping
your distance from me.

291
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,250
I don't know what you're talking about.

292
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,794
It's okay.

293
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,047
You're okay.

294
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,093
I just want to be a little clear.

295
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,679
[choking]

296
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,140
When you take the stand,

297
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,020
I want you to give the jury
a much better performance

298
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,189
than the one you're giving me.

299
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,068
You know what I'm talking about now?

300
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,571
Good.

301
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,031
That's a good girl.

302
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,577
[gasping]

303
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,415
Gotta go to the courthouse.

304
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,466
It's not going too good, is it?

305
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,093
Hey, no, it's going fine.

306
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,636
It's fine. That was just
the prosecution's turn,

307
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,389
so when it's our turn,
we're gonna kick some major ass.

308
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,725
That's a legal term.

309
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,687
Why don't you go
and get yourself something

310
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,606
that's not too unhealthy
from the vending machine, okay?

311
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,899
Okay.

312
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,614
What will happen
if Mr. Oliver goes to jail?

313
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,240
He's not going to jail, Raisa.

314
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,867
He's not the Green Arrow.

315
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,162
I think we both know better.

316
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,670
I tanked it. I did exactly
what you said not to do.

317
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,297
Lawyer's good, D.

318
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,132
Don't worry, I'll bring it home.

319
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,551
How? We got immunity
from the prosecution.

320
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,553
If watching every episode
of <i>Law &amp; Order</i>ever

321
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,972
has taught me anything,
it's that you can't plead the Fifth.

322
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,725
If you get cornered
and you refuse to testify,

323
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,144
-you go to jail, Rene.
-Well, then I'll go to jail, Hoss.

324
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,647
But I'm not screwing Oliver over again.

325
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,359
Hey, guys, the clerk just called
the court back into session.

326
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,366
I worked in the Mayor's office
close to a year.

327
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,161
Side-by-side with Mr. Queen
every single day.

328
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,874
If he was running around
pretending to be Robin Hood,

329
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,085
-I would have known.
-And did you know it?

330
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,342
Mr. Ramirez...

331
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,972
Mr. Ramirez...

332
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,808
Did you have occasion to determine

333
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,644
whether Oliver Queen
was the Green Arrow?

334
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:24,942
[Oliver] Rene...

335
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:36,704
He's the Green Arrow.

336
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,497
Oliver is.

337
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,708
[Van Owen] And you know this
because you were a member

338
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,751
of his vigilante team, weren't you?

339
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,087
Yeah.

340
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:51,385
Did you ever see the defendant kill
or maim anyone as the Green Arrow?

341
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,512
Yeah.

342
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,389
How many people did he kill or maim?

343
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,146
-I don't know.
-Ballpark it for me.

344
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,272
I don't know!

345
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,402
It's too many to count.

346
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,487
-[crowd murmuring loudly]
-[Judge] Order.

347
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:11,655
Order!

348
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,991
[Van Owen]
The prosecution rests, Your Honor.

349
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,005
Are you okay?

350
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,757
-Are you hurt?
-I'm fine.

351
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,341
He picked me up from school.

352
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,010
He was with a police officer.

353
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,344
They said you were hurt.

354
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,057
He was here and we just let him walk?

355
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,600
We're not letting him walk.

356
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,351
Let's get outta here.

357
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,239
Hey, look at you.

358
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,076
Maybe you don't care about people
finding out the truth about you.

359
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,078
That's right. I don't care.

360
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,662
Whatever it takes to stop you.

361
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,457
How about taking on
the entire police force?

362
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,751
How does that sound to you?

363
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,545
You want us to light them up, boss?

364
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,464
That depends on them.

365
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,133
My man.

366
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,551
What do you want us to do with them?

367
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,720
Nothing.

368
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,598
If they had an accident
after testifying...

369
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,683
Could be awkward.

370
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,145
Hey, smile.

371
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,815
It's your lucky day, baby.

372
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,072
Okay.

373
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,824
Is this as bad as it looks?

374
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,367
Arguably worse.

375
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:44,123
Can we prove that Diaz
was putting pressure on Rene?

376
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,416
No, no, no. I mean,
even assuming we could,

377
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,336
the jury has no idea
who Ricardo Diaz is.

378
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:54,424
Conventional wisdom says you never
ask a client if they are guilty,

379
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:58,220
because the more I know,
the more it might tie my hands but...

380
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,139
I am gonna ask...

381
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,934
Are you the Green Arrow?

382
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:06,895
Yes.

383
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,820
Then I'm going to propose
a new strategy.

384
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,572
-Okay.
-Jury nullification.

385
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,073
-Hmm?
-You're going to admit

386
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,449
to being the Green Arrow.

387
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,911
We are then going to highlight
every single thing you have done

388
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,247
for this city,
all the times you have saved it.

389
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,875
We will argue you do not deserve
to go to prison.

390
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,086
This is a legitimate chance, Oliver.

391
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,672
-I can't do it.
-Why not?

392
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,717
I'd be putting a target on my back.

393
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:41,138
I'd be putting a target
on my wife and son's back.

394
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,267
I have been the Green Arrow
for six years.

395
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,103
I didn't plan on doing it forever.

396
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,647
I thought that one day
my mission would end,

397
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,650
and I would finally,
after all this time,

398
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,570
get a chance to actually live my life.

399
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,699
That will never happen,

400
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,828
if I tell the whole world

401
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,206
that I'm the Green Arrow.

402
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,759
You don't have to testify.

403
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,136
-Jean doesn't have to call you.
-Yes, she does.

404
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,512
And I want to testify.

405
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,973
I don't want you in a position
where you perjure yourself

406
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,058
because of me.

407
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,018
Well, let me just add it
to the long list of felonies

408
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,102
I've already committed for you.

409
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,812
Look, John has something planned.

410
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,524
You don't have to take the chance.

411
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,193
I will take any chance,

412
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,404
if it keeps you from being taken away
from me and William.

413
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,864
[bailiff] Court is back in session.

414
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,491
Here we go.

415
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:52,542
I graduated summa cum laude from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology

416
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,920
with master's degrees in cybersecurity

417
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,088
and computer sciences.

418
00:20:56,171 --> 00:21:00,342
From 2015 to 2016, I served as
the CEO of Palmer Tech Incorporated.

419
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,261
[Jean] Thank you.

420
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,597
Defense moves to have Ms. Smoak
accepted as an expert witness.

421
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,224
I don't see the point of this,
Ms. Loring.

422
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:10,185
I want the witness to testify
to the validity of this photograph.

423
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,979
Fine, but make it quick.

424
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,648
Ms. Smoak,

425
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:18,610
this appears to be a photograph
of your husband, Oliver Queen,

426
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,154
-dressed as the Green Arrow.
-Yes.

427
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,992
The key words being "appears to be."
This photo has been doctored.

428
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:28,870
A pixel level analysis will show
almost undetectable light shifts

429
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,831
and resolution inconsistencies

430
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,874
that would not be present
in a natural photo.

431
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,126
[Van Owen]
Objection, Your Honor.

432
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:37,421
What is the point of showing us an
allegedly doctored photograph at all?

433
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,006
The better question would be,

434
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,341
who and why would they doctor a photo

435
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,051
to make Oliver Queen
look like the Green Arrow

436
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,177
if he were the Green Arrow?

437
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,723
I mean, which he's not.
He's my husband, I would know.

438
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,683
[Jean] No further questions.

439
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,228
When was Mr. Queen arrested?

440
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,230
November 21st, 2017.

441
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,773
And when were the two of you married?

442
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,151
-November 28th.
-Just a week later?

443
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,277
Yes.

444
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,820
Is it possible that you
rushed the wedding

445
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,947
so that you could claim
spousal privilege,

446
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,658
just in case you had to testify
against Mr. Queen?

447
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,828
I've been in love with Oliver
for six years.

448
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:11,788
Trust me, it felt anything but rushed.

449
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,457
[Van Owen]
Let's change the topic.

450
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,751
Your father's Noah Kuttler,
the alleged Calculator...

451
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,419
-Objection.
-Overruled.

452
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,172
-He's reformed.
-[Van Owen] But before he was,

453
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,884
did you know that he was a notorious
computer hacker and cybercriminal?

454
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:24,968
No, I had no idea.

455
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,595
Doesn't say much about your ability

456
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,972
to see criminality in people
close to you, does it?

457
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,807
-I would...
-And under the heading,

458
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,684
"Apples falling from trees,"

459
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,520
have you yourself ever engaged
in cybercrime?

460
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,397
No, I haven't.

461
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,442
Good luck proving otherwise,
Ms. Van Owen.

462
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,321
Roy Harper is not a vigilante.

463
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:47,324
He sacrificed himself
to protect the identity

464
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,118
of a man that the city at the time

465
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,162
referred to as "The Hood,"

466
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,497
or "The Arrow."

467
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,124
I've since come to learn
that the Green Arrow

468
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,250
is the same person.

469
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,003
-But that's not you.
-It's absolutely not me.

470
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:01,963
And do you know who it is?

471
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:05,592
Yes, I do,
but I will not reveal his identity.

472
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,221
Not even if it sends me to prison.

473
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,015
Pass the witness.

474
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,767
Well, that's convenient.

475
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,852
You're not the Green Arrow,

476
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,146
you know who is the Green Arrow,
but you're not saying.

477
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,023
Well, I keep my promises, Ms. Van Owen.

478
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,733
When did you meet this mystery man?

479
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,568
Shortly after I returned to Star City.

480
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,738
As you know, I was marooned
for five years on an island

481
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,823
named Lian Yu.

482
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,450
This photograph was taken
during that five-year period.

483
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,453
I'm just curious, why does Lian Yu
look a lot like Russia?

484
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,205
-Objection.
-[Judge] Overruled.

485
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,165
[Van Owen] We obtained this photograph
from a reporter

486
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,042
by the name of Susan Williams.

487
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:46,383
I've not been entirely forthcoming
about that period of time in my life.

488
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,053
Parts of it were spent in Hong Kong,

489
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,640
and, yes, parts of it
were spent in Russia.

490
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,559
So, you lied,

491
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:58,645
repeatedly and publicly?

492
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,773
You lied about being on Lian Yu,

493
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,067
and you lied about
five years of your life,

494
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,528
which begs the question, Mr. Queen...

495
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,072
What else have you lied about?

496
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,593
Quiet.

497
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,386
Quiet or I'll clear the courtroom.

498
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:32,637
[gavel banging]

499
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,598
Please state your name for the record.

500
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,349
Thomas Merlyn.

501
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,185
"Tommy" is fine if you want.

502
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,562
Mr. Merlyn, you were declared dead,

503
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,772
May 15, 2013.

504
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,942
That night, my father destroyed
a large portion of the city.

505
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,486
With the heightened scrutiny
on my family,

506
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,239
I took the opportunity
to fake my own death

507
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,700
to protect my identity as The Hood.

508
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:54,910
Three years ago,

509
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,871
Roy Harper confessed to being The Hood.

510
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,372
To protect me.

511
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,542
And then he was attacked in prison.

512
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:07,672
I have lived with that guilt
for three years.

513
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:12,344
I am not about to let Oliver
take the blame for me

514
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,429
the same way that Roy did.

515
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,723
And that's why I'm here.

516
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:18,850
To set the record straight.

517
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,560
Thank you.

518
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,437
Your witness.

519
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,775
If you're the Green Arrow,

520
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:30,487
how come Rene Ramirez testified
under oath that Oliver Queen is?

521
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:34,699
Well, I would suspect
that he was being pressured to.

522
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,451
Are you saying he perjured himself?

523
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,370
Well, I don't know. I'm not a lawyer.

524
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,372
I'm just the Green Arrow.

525
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,084
And I am telling you I am the only man

526
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,253
that has ever worn this hood.

527
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,754
Mr. Merlyn,

528
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,257
you're under arrest
on suspicion of murder,

529
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,177
assault, and violation
of the Anti-Vigilante Act of 2017.

530
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,513
The bailiff will remand
Mr. Merlyn into custody.

531
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,682
Objection, Your Honor.
It's the People's contention

532
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:01,351
that Mr. Merlyn here
is not the Green Arrow.

533
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,477
Be that as it may,

534
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,312
I can't just let him walk out
of my courtroom.

535
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,231
You know, if it's any consolation,

536
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:09,651
my team is going to extract me
before I ever get to prison, so...

537
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,028
Get him out of here.

538
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,782
Your Honor, defense moves
for a dismissal.

539
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:16,908
Nice try,

540
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,703
but it's the jury's job
to sort out this kind of mess,

541
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,037
and that's what I'm gonna let them do.

542
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,382
Guys, on the way to Iron Heights,

543
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,800
do you think we could stop
at a drive-thru?

544
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,428
-I am starving.
-We're not going to Iron Heights.

545
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,972
Mr. Diaz really wants to meet you.

546
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,641
All right, so where did we land
on the drive-thru? It's my treat...

547
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,768
[laughing]

548
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,021
You know, six against one,

549
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:47,689
it's not really a fair fight.

550
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,983
You should have brought backup. I did.

551
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,660
You're cutting a little close there,
aren't you, John?

552
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,456
What's your exit strategy?

553
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,082
Sitting right there.

554
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,502
Well, let's go.

555
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:17,469
-Thanks for doing this.
-My pleasure.

556
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,846
I always wanted to say,
"I am Spartacus."

557
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,186
-It's Christopher Chance.
-Rene Ramirez.

558
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,980
I think I bought you
a perjury charge back there, Rene.

559
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,857
Small price to pay
for a clear conscience.

560
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,525
You think it worked?

561
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:36,196
At the very least, we've created
some very serious reasonable doubt.

562
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,073
Yeah, let's hope so.

563
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,085
When you said I didn't have
to take the "chance" of lying,

564
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,836
-that was a pun!
-I don't do puns.

565
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,922
Well, that was Christopher Chance
I did just see in there, right?

566
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,048
Yes.

567
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,549
I'm sorry that I couldn't loop you in.

568
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,386
We had Officer Parks listening
to every word that we said,

569
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,470
and I...

570
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,395
I didn't know Chance
was gonna use Tommy's face.

571
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,065
Well, yeah, I mean, I guess they were
thinking what's more compelling

572
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,608
than a testimony from a dead guy, right?

573
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,112
Excuse me.

574
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,489
-Mr. Mayor.
-We've got a problem.

575
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,573
Not anymore.

576
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,118
-Chance just saved our bacon.
-Laurel told me.

577
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,912
She also told me
that Diaz is making her testify

578
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,080
as a rebuttal witness.

579
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:31,835
He's sending her in there
with Chance's entire CIA file.

580
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,379
She will be telling the jury everything

581
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,798
about what you guys
just pulled in there.

582
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,217
Or Diaz is going to kill her.

583
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,512
How does Diaz even know about Chance?

584
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:47,142
'Cause Diaz has access to everything
that Cayden James learned from his...

585
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,229
It's the bug in the bunker.

586
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:52,731
I'm sorry, Oliver.

587
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,150
We'll think of something.

588
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,068
I'll give you guys some room.

589
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,034
Okay. Okay, so...

590
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,456
Okay, what's the something
that we're gonna think of?

591
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,750
Jean suggested that I just admit
I'm the Green Arrow

592
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,460
and we go for some sort of
jury nullification.

593
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,211
But I explained to her that

594
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,796
I would like to have a life

595
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:20,258
after being the Green Arrow,
but more importantly, I...

596
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,969
I cannot put a target
on you and William.

597
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,388
Let me worry about me and William.

598
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,599
Let me at least take that
off your plate.

599
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,019
That's not how wedding vows work.

600
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,854
We didn't exchange vows.

601
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,731
But if we did,

602
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,357
"exchange" means "go both ways."

603
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,027
And we fight

604
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,238
for each other, Oliver.
We protect each other.

605
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:45,867
We're gonna save each other.

606
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,161
I can't save anyone from behind bars.

607
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,704
We'll get you out
just like we got John out.

608
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:53,374
I can break out of prison, Felicity,
but then what, you know?

609
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,545
I'm not abandoning the two of you.

610
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,506
I can't make the two of you fugitives.

611
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,840
We're gonna be okay.

612
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,426
John and I have been talking, and...

613
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,554
If I go to prison, I need

614
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,392
you and William to go into
A.R.G.U.S. protective custody.

615
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,061
[gasps]

616
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,608
We're not there yet.

617
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,528
We cannot live in denial.

618
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,322
All right, we have to have a plan.

619
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,701
I can handle losing my freedom.

620
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,998
I cannot handle losing you and William.

621
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,975
[Black Siren] I solemnly affirm to
tell the truth, the whole truth,

622
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,393
and nothing but the truth.

623
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,395
-[exhales]
-[Van Owen] Ms. Lance,

624
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,522
the defendant here
has publicly acknowledged

625
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,692
that you were the vigilante
known as the Black Canary.

626
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,027
Is it fair to take Mr. Queen
at his word?

627
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:05,989
On that, at least.

628
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:10,118
And being that the Black Canary is
a known associate of the Green Arrow,

629
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,122
is it fair to say

Good girl.

633
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:22,964
Over the course of this trial,
we heard Rene Ramirez testify

634
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,301
that Oliver Queen was the Green Arrow,

635
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:30,597
but a man calling himself
Tommy Merlyn claims that identity.

-Are you okay?
-Until Diaz gets a hold of me, yeah.

I thought you said
you were gonna bury Oliver.

Thanks to you, I now know exactly
what I have to do.

659
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:59,978
Earlier, Judge McGarvey said
it fell upon you, the jury,

660
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,606
to sort out what he deemed to be a mess.

661
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:07,443
True, we have contradicting witnesses,

662
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,530
and, yes, we have
conflicting testimonies.

663
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:13,408
But that is not a mess,
ladies and gentlemen.

664
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,160
That is the textbook definition

665
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,287
of reasonable doubt.

666
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,133
Fifteen minutes
after being taken into custody,

667
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,636
Tommy Merlyn was freed by members
of the Green Arrow's team.

668
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:38,099
Now, you might take that as evidence
that he is in fact the Green Arrow,

669
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:42,562
but I would like to offer you
a much more plausible explanation.

670
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:48,401
And that is, Oliver Queen has people
and resources at his disposal

671
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:51,237
to do whatever it takes
to keep his secrets.

672
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:55,074
And don't think that doesn't mean
someone falling out of the sky

673
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:58,411
into this courtroom with a false face
and a made-up story,

674
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,664
because Tommy Merlyn
is just another Roy Harper.

675
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,333
He's just another man

676
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,253
willing to go to prison
to cover up the crimes

677
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,130
that that man committed.

678
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,758
Don't let him get away with it.

679

I love both of you very much.

And whatever happens,
nothing is gonna change that.

00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,422
-What do you mean?
-I mean that

691
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:54,592
the man who wants me in prison

692

controls the judge,

693
00:34:56,761 --> 00:35:00,181
and we think it's a pretty good bet
that he has

694
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,142
a strong influence over the jury.

-It means...

the standard for granting a JNOV

00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,264
after the crap you pulled in court.

793
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,557
No.

794
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:37,351
I'm smart enough to know
there's no place I can run

795
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,936
where you can't find me.

796
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:54,034
I'm so sorry, Ricardo.

797
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,539
Fool me once...

798
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,713
Couldn't get it out in time.

799
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,467
Come on.

800
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,886
I had a plan.

801
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:17,016
Get Oliver Queen
discredited, imprisoned...

802
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:22,563
I worked for months to make that happen.

803
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,982
I'm so sorry to disappoint you.

804
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:27,401
Oh, I'm not disappointed, baby.

805
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,947
I'm moving on to plan B.

806
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,452
Killing Oliver Queen,

807
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:42,124
and anyone and everyone he cares about.
