1
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:38,660
Ana, take my car.

2
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,245
I gave you the recorder, right?

3
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:43,915
Oh, yes.

4
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,833
And you have all the questions?

5
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:46,918
Yes.

6
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:47,960
And you know where you're going?

7
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:49,587
Yes, I do have a GPS.

8
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:51,255
And a 4.0 GPA.

9
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:52,799
I can figure it out.

10
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:53,925
Are you wearing that?

11
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:57,929
Okay, maybe a little
less talking,

12
00:02:58,096 --> 00:02:59,597
more eating.

13
00:02:59,764 --> 00:03:00,848
How about that?

14
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:18,866
Wow.

15
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:49,939
Miss Kavanagh?

16
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:53,109
May I take your coat?

17
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:54,652
Oh. Yeah. Um...

18
00:03:55,695 --> 00:03:57,363
She's...
Okay, so...

19
00:03:57,572 --> 00:03:59,031
Mr. Grey will see you now.

20
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:00,450
Okay.

21
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:01,701
This way, please.

22
00:04:01,868 --> 00:04:05,580
Okay. Mr. Grey has a
conference call at 11:15.

23
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:15,173
Right this way.

24
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:24,348
Miss Kavanagh.

25
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:26,726
Are you all right?

26
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:31,814
Christian Grey.

27
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:33,524
I'm Anastasia Steele.

28
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:38,029
Um, Miss Kavanagh has the flu,
so she asked me to fill in.

29
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:39,322
I see.

30
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:40,948
So, you're studying
journalism as well.

31
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:43,367
No, English Lit.

32
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:44,619
Um...

33
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:46,162
Kate's my roommate.

34
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:48,539
As I said,
I only have 10 minutes.

35
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:50,208
Please, have a seat,
Miss Steele.

36
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,760
Okay.

37
00:05:16,943 --> 00:05:18,110
Thank you.

38
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,115
Ready?

39
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:25,701
Whenever you are.

40
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:27,954
Okay. Um...

41
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:30,373
So, this is for the special
graduation issue

42
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:31,415
of the student newspaper.

43
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:34,794
Yes, I'm giving the commencement
address at this year's ceremony.

44
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:35,920
You are?

45
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:38,965
I mean, um...

46
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,635
I know.

47
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:47,974
Uh..."You are very young to
have amassed such an empire.

48
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:49,100
"To what do you owe your..."

49
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,060
To what do I owe my success?

50
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:53,479
Yep.

51
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:54,981
Seriously?

52
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,440
Yes.

53
00:05:58,818 --> 00:06:00,069
Business is about people.

54
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:03,739
And I've always
been good at people.

55
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,492
What motivates them,
what incentivizes them,

56
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:08,119
what inspires them.

57
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:11,581
Um, maybe you're just lucky.

58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,377
I've always found
that the harder I work,

59
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,504
the more luck I seem to have.

60
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:22,258
The key to my success has been in
identifying talented individuals

61
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:24,594
and harnessing their efforts.

62
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,137
So, you're a control freak?

63
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:29,765
Oh, I exercise control in
all things, Miss Steele.

64
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:34,312
Okay. Um...

65
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:38,107
"Your company is
involved primarily

66
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:40,443
"in the telecommunications
sector,

67
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:44,280
"yet you also invest in
numerous agricultural projects,

68
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:45,698
"including several in Africa.

69
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:47,992
"Is that something that you
feel passionate about?

70
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,036
"Feeding the world's poor?"

71
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,746
It's smart business.

72
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,166
You don't agree?

73
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,503
I don't know enough about it.

74
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,344
I just wonder if

75
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:10,139
perhaps your heart might be a bit
bigger than you want to let on?

76
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:14,352
There are some people who say
that I don't have a heart at all.

77
00:07:14,894 --> 00:07:16,062
Why would they say that?

78
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,897
Because they know me well.

79
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:21,484
Go on.

80
00:07:23,736 --> 00:07:26,030
Um..."Do you have any
interests outside of work?"

81
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:29,367
I enjoy various
physical pursuits.

82
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:31,202
You're unmarried.

83
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,244
Oh.

84
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,205
You were adopted at age four.

85
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,040
That's a matter
of public record.

86
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,585
I'm sorry, I didn't...

87
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:43,547
Do you have an actual
question, Miss Steele?

88
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,050
Yeah, sorry.

89
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:48,886
"Are you gay?"

90
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:56,060
It's written here, I'm just...

91
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,397
No, Anastasia.

92
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:00,606
I'm not gay.

93
00:08:01,691 --> 00:08:04,402
I apologize, Mr. Grey.
Kate can be a little...

94
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:05,569
Intrusive?

95
00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:08,948
Curious.

96
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,038
What about you?

97
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:22,920
Why don't you ask me something
that you want to know?

98
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:29,802
Earlier, you said that there are
some people who know you well.

99
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,975
Why do I get the feeling
that, that is not true?

100
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:40,896
Mr. Grey, your next meeting
is in the conference room.

101
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:43,024
Cancel, please.
We're not finished here.

102
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:44,400
Yes, sir.

103
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46,110
No... I'm...

104
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:47,611
I can go. It's fine.

105
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,780
I would like to
know more about you.

106
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,618
There's really not much
to know about me.

107
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:56,954
You said you're
an English major?

108
00:08:57,455 --> 00:08:59,415
Tell me,
was it Charlotte Brontë,

109
00:08:59,457 --> 00:09:00,791
Jane Austen, or Thomas Hardy

110
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,086
who first made you fall
in love with literature?

111
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:06,964
Hardy.

112
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,469
I would have guessed
Jane Austen.

113
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:15,973
What are your plans
after you graduate?

114
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,476
I'm just trying to
get through finals right now.

115
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:19,602
And then?

116
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:22,980
And then I was planning
on moving here, to Seattle,

117
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:24,482
with Kate.

118
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,859
We offer an excellent
internship program.

119
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,447
I don't think I'd fit in here.

120
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,162
Look at me.

121
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,499
I am.

122
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,714
I hope you got
everything you needed.

123
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,842
I... I think you only
answered four questions.

124
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:00,810
Anastasia.

125
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,561
Christian.

126
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,073
Holy cow.

127
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:31,048
Um...

128
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:32,133
Before you say anything...

129
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,759
You're a goddess.
This is perfect.

130
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:34,927
What?

131
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:38,264
I just got his e-mail.
He answered every question.

132
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:41,016
So, what was he like?

133
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,101
Um...

134
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:45,437
He was fine.

135
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:48,149
"Fine"?

136
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:49,900
Just fine?

137
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:53,946
Um, he was really polite,

138
00:10:54,113 --> 00:10:57,449
and he was courteous,

139
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,287
and very formal,

140
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:03,622
and clean.

141
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,374
"Clean"?

142
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:11,130
I mean, he was very smart.

143
00:11:11,297 --> 00:11:13,632
And intense.

144
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,302
It was kind of intimidating.

145
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,555
I can understand
the fascination.

146
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:20,598
Uh-huh.

147
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,601
Why are you
looking at me like that?

148
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:25,394
Like what?

149
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,146
Okay.

150
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:30,482
I'm gonna make a sandwich.
Do you want one?

151
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:31,775
No, thanks.

152
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:39,909
You have to admit,
he's ridiculously hot.

153
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,911
I'm sure if you

154
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:48,626
are attracted to that
sort of human, then...

155
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,837
The hot type of human?

156
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:55,341
I asked him if he was gay.
That was in your questions.

157
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:56,634
Why would you do that to me?

158
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,928
Because whenever he's
in the society pages,

159
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,764
he's never been photographed with a woman.
So, naturally...

160
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:04,308
Well, maybe he just wants to keep
his private life private, Kate.

161
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:06,310
And now you're defending him.

162
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,938
I'm terminating
this conversation.

163
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:12,483
Too bad we don't have
some original stills

164
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:16,445
of your hot, clean
27-year-old billionaire.

165
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:18,155
The camera loves him
almost as much as you do.

166
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:22,284
Okay, I wasn't hungry,
but now I am.

167
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:24,787
Thank you.

168
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,623
I love you.

169
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,184
"I declared I could not change,

170
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:48,978
"yet you tell me to my face

171
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,230
"I shall change soon.

172
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,276
"And what a distortion
in your judgment,

173
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:58,529
"what a perversity
in your ideas..."

174
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:12,042
Ana. I've been looking for you.
What's up?

175
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:13,168
Guess what.
What?

176
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:17,006
Portland Place is going to exhibit
my photographs next month.

177
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,008
Oh, my God.

178
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:21,552
Congratulations!
That's so good!

179
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:23,220
Solo show, corazón.

180
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:25,055
Can we celebrate later? Because
I'm really late for work.

181
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:26,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You got it.
But, um...

182
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:28,892
Hold on.

183
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:30,853
Thank you.

184
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:32,604
You're my hero.

185
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:33,689
I'll see you later.

186
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:34,732
Okay.

187
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,783
Mom, I'm at work.
Can I call you back?

188
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,869
Oh, no, wait.
I called for a reason.

189
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:49,455
Bob broke his foot playing
golf, of all things.

190
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,915
God. Is he okay?
Is he in a lot of pain?

191
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,083
Who can tell with the man?

192
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:54,710
He calls the paramedics
for a blister.

193
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:58,922
It means, though, we won't be
able to fly in for graduation.

194
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,550
Really?

195
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,137
You don't wanna just come alone?
You don't have to bring Bob.

196
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,848
Ah. And leave Tiger Woods
to fend for himself?

197
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,392
You do understand.
Don't you, darling?

198
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,770
Yeah. Yeah, it's fine.

199
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:15,105
Um, I really have to go, okay?

200
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:16,398
I love you, Ana.

201
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,150
I know. I love you, too.

202
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:20,444
Oh, God.

203
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:21,612
Ana.

204
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:23,989
Could you give me
a hand out back?

205
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:26,116
Uh, yeah.
I'll be right there.

206
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,211
I thought it was you.

207
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:38,837
What the...

208
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,964
What a pleasant surprise,
Miss Steele.

209
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,634
Just "Ana."

210
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:44,927
Just "Ana."

211
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:46,095
You're in here.

212
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:48,305
I was in the area on business.

213
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:49,807
I needed to pick
up a few things.

214
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:51,308
Are you free?

215
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:53,310
Yeah.

216
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:55,604
What can I help you with?

217
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:57,815
Do you stock cable ties?

218
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,109
Cable ties, yes. We do.

219
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:02,486
I can show you, if you want.

220
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:04,988
Please lead the way,
Miss Steele.

221
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:06,865
Just "Ana."

222
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,330
Is that it?

223
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:14,873
Masking tape.

224
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:17,000
Are you redecorating?

225
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,669
No.

226
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:23,215
Um, we have two-inch
and one-inch.

227
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:25,509
But the truly
self-respecting handyman

228
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,469
will have both in his toolbox.

229
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:28,846
Of course he will.
Mmm-hmm.

230
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,515
It's rare to find
a connoisseur these days.

231
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,852
Do you want anything else?

232
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:36,520
Yes.

233
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:38,730
Rope.

234
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:43,652
That's impressive.

235
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:45,028
Are you a Girl Scout?

236
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,282
Um, no.

237
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:51,994
Organized group activities
aren't really my thing.

238
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,496
So what is your "thing"?

239
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:56,665
Um...

240
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:59,084
I don't know. Books?

241
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:01,545
Okay.

242
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:05,048
Rope, tape, cable ties.

243
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,551
You're the complete
serial killer.

244
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,678
Not today.

245
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:11,930
Anything else?

246
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:13,682
What would you recommend?

247
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,560
For a do-it-yourselfer?
Um...

248
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:20,272
Maybe coveralls,
so you protect your clothes.

249
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:23,066
I could just take
all my clothes off.

250
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,402
Okay.

251
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:26,570
No clothes.

252
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,155
I mean, no coveralls.

253
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,242
I can't think of anything else.

254
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,913
Well, I guess that's it, then.

255
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,289
Cool.

256
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:40,876
Thank you for answering
Kate's questions, by the way.

257
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,044
She was thrilled.

258
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:43,253
I hope she's feeling better.

259
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,421
She is, yeah, much.

260
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:46,924
She's just having a hard time
clearing a photo of you, I think.

261
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,760
If she'd like an original,
I'm around tomorrow.

262
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,762
You'd be willing to do that?

263
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:53,180
Yeah.

264
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,556
Want me to bag for you, Ana?

265
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:57,100
Oh. Uh, no, I'm good.
Thanks, though, Paul.

266
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:00,646
Okay.

267
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:08,445
I'm staying
locally at the Heathman.

268
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:09,863
Call me before 10:00.

269
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:13,033
About the photos.

270
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:14,409
Oh.

271
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,953
Yeah, I will.

272
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:20,123
Enjoy your...

273
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,812
Thanks again
for doing this, Mr. Grey.

274
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:43,230
I'm happy to help.

275
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:46,191
Uh, how about we try
a few with a smile?

276
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,155
Or not.

277
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:55,033
You do realize that he hasn't
stopped looking at you.

278
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:00,038
He asked me
to go for coffee afterwards.

279
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:01,957
What?

280
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:03,667
Kate, shh.

281
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,837
So, is he your boyfriend?

282
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:08,505
Who?

283
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:10,048
The photographer.

284
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:12,009
José?

285
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:13,343
No.

286
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,512
I saw the way
he was smiling at you.

287
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,390
No, José is more like family.

288
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:20,183
He's not my boyfriend.

289
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,019
And the guy at the store?

290
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,062
Paul?

291
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:25,689
No.

292
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:34,323
Thank you.

293
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:44,875
You seem nervous.

294
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,711
I find you intimidating.

295
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:50,380
You should.

296
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:53,634
Eat.

297
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,886
Not to mention high-handed.

298
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,597
I'm used to getting my own way.

299
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,599
That must get very boring.

300
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:05,729
Tell me about your family.

301
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,481
My family? Um...

302
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:08,732
Okay.

303
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:11,276
My dad died when I was a baby.

304
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:14,488
So, I was raised by
my stepfather, Ray.

305
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,573
He's amazing.

306
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:18,408
And your mother?

307
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:23,121
Um, my mother is on
husband number four.

308
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:27,000
She's an incurable romantic.

309
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:28,960
Are you?

310
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:30,462
Am I a romantic?

311
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:33,965
Well, I study English Lit.

312
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,009
So, I kind of have to be.

313
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:41,139
I thought the photo
shoot went well. Right?

314
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:42,307
Kate seems to be really...

315
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:44,601
I'm sorry, I can't...

316
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,228
What?

317
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:47,771
I'll walk you out.

318
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:54,861
Do you have a girlfriend?
Is that it?

319
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,197
I don't do the girlfriend thing.

320
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,365
What does that even...
Watch it!

321
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,130
I'm not the man for you.

322
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:16,466
You should steer clear of me.

323
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,804
I have to let you go.

324
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:26,810
Goodbye, Mr. Grey.

325
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:33,817
All right, pencils down.

326
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,987
Please take your final exams
to the back of the classroom.

327
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,905
Final grades will be
posted in two weeks.

328
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,742
Hey. You all good?

329
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,536
Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

330
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,663
We are so partying tonight.

331
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,290
Oh, my God.

332
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,666
This is way too much.

333
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,085
No, this is exactly
the right amount.

334
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:53,795
You're getting it
all over my face.

335
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:55,172
That's the idea.

336
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:57,591
Wow. No, Kate.

337
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,177
Cab's early. Let's go.

338
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:03,680
Ana, it's a package for you.

339
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:09,019
"Why didn't you tell
me there was danger?

340
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:10,353
"Why didn't you warn me?

341
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,230
"Ladies know what
to guard against

342
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:15,066
"because they read novels that
tell them of these tricks."

343
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:17,903
That's a quote from
Tess of the D'Urbervilles.

344
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:19,696
Oh, my God.

345
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,698
These must be from Christian.

346
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:25,869
Do you... I mean...

347
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,247
These are incredible.

348
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:31,208
Wow, Grey.

349
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,377
Kate, these are first editions.

350
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:36,546
I can't.

351
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:38,298
This is too much.

352
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:41,593
- I can't accept these.
- I have to send them back.

353
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:43,053
That's the cab.

354
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:44,763
Okay, are you ready?

355
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:47,891
Are you ready to go?
Yes. Yes, very.

356
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,392
Let's get out of here.

357
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,146
- Shots first...
- Shots, shots, shots!

358
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,440
Hold on.
Nobody hold back, either.

359
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,277
Did you do it all?

360
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:01,571
All right.
With my eyes closed

361
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:02,823
and left-handed,
I can get this in.

362
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:03,990
- What?
- Ready?

363
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,784
I gotta pee.
Okay.

364
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:06,952
Where you going?
I gotta go.

365
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,245
I gotta pee.

366
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:47,951
Anastasia?

367
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:49,452
Yeah, this is me.

368
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:52,289
I'm sending back
your expensive books,

369
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,249
because I already
have copies of those.

370
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,793
Thanks, though,
for the kind gesture.

371
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:59,671
You're welcome. Where are you?

372
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:03,341
I'm in line, because I
have to pee really bad.

373
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:05,176
Anastasia,
have you been drinking?

374
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:07,178
Yeah.

375
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:09,681
I have, Mr. Fancy Pants.

376
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:12,267
You hit the hail on the nead.

377
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,352
I mean,
the head right on the nail.

378
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,813
Listen to me. I want you
to go home right now.

379
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,982
You're so bossy.

380
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:20,483
"Ana, let's go for coffee."

381
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,861
"Ana, let's go for coffee."

382
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:25,488
"No, stay away from me, Ana.

383
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:27,782
"I don't want you.
Get away."

384
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:29,701
"Come here, come here."
"Go away."

385
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,328
That's it.
Tell me where you are.

386
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,997
I'm a long way from Seattle.

387
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:35,373
A long way from you.

388
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,167
Which bar?
What's it called?

389
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,668
I don't know.
I gotta go, though.

390
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,045
Which bar, Ana?

391
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:45,175
I told him. Right?

392
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:54,935
I'm sorry, I didn't...

393
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,853
Stay where you are.
I'm coming to get you.

394
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,355
What?

395
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:01,232
Hello?

396
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,039
Hey.

397
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:18,583
Oh, thanks.

398
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,335
You okay?

399
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:26,424
Yeah. I'm just a little
bit more drunk than...

400
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:28,551
Come here, stay warm.

401
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,972
Oh, it's cool.
I'm good, José. I got it.

402
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:35,558
I don't know when I'll have
the courage to do this.

403
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:37,560
Do what?

404
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:39,521
Ana. I like you.
No.

405
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,022
You do?
Very much.

406
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:42,440
Oh, my God.

407
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,693
Please.

408
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:46,528
One kiss.

409
00:24:46,695 --> 00:24:47,904
No, no, no.

410
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:50,407
José, I don't...
I'm sorry, no.

411
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:51,908
Dude, she said no!

412
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:54,035
Christian?

413
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:01,084
- Don't look at me. Ugh.
- Here.

414
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:06,464
Nice touch.

415
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:09,426
I will launder this item.

416
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:10,719
Let's get you home.

417
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,137
I'm with Kate.

418
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,221
I'll have Elliot tell her.

419
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:14,723
Who's Elliot?

420
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:17,308
He's my brother. He's inside,
talking to her right now.

421
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:19,060
How... I don't...

422
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,104
He was at my hotel with me.

423
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:22,647
You're still at the Heathman?

424
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,482
Yeah.

425
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:26,901
Come.

426
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:43,960
That's your brother?

427
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:45,420
Not by choice. Let's go.

428
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:47,881
Wait, what did Kate say?

429
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:49,924
She warned me to be
on my best behavior.

430
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:51,509
More like threatened me.

431
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:52,635
She threatened you?

432
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,641
You're spinning.

433
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:00,560
I think I'm gonna faint.

434
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:01,644
What? Now?

435
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:55,990
Good morning, Anastasia.

436
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:00,870
How are you feeling?

437
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:04,666
Better than I deserve.

438
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,548
Did you put me to bed?

439
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:15,343
Mmm-hmm.

440
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:17,720
You undressed me?

441
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:19,889
I didn't have much choice.

442
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:22,559
Where did you sleep?

443
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:29,524
Oh, my God.
Did we? We didn't...

444
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:31,860
Necrophilia is not my thing.

445
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:34,195
So we just slept, then?

446
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:37,031
It was a novelty for me, too.

447
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,036
You need to eat.

448
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:45,665
I had Taylor pick
you up some clothes.

449
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:47,167
Who's Taylor?

450
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,501
My driver.

451
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:51,045
Thank you, but you
didn't have to do that.

452
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:52,755
Yes, I did.

453
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:54,424
Yours were covered in vomit.

454
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:58,553
You shouldn't get
drunk like that.

455
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,638
I'm all for testing the limits,

456
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:01,890
but you put yourself
at risk last night.

457
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:04,559
I know.

458
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,733
If you were mine, you wouldn't
be able to sit down for a week.

459
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:13,276
What?

460
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:18,406
I gotta go take a shower.

461
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:28,082
Why am I here, Christian?

462
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:34,756
You're here because I'm
incapable of leaving you alone.

463
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:39,636
Then don't.

464
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:45,808
Why did you send me those books?

465
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:49,354
I thought I owed you an apology.

466
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:51,397
For what?

467
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,943
For letting you
believe that I...

468
00:28:58,363 --> 00:28:59,697
Listen to me.

469
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:04,118
I don't do romance.

470
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:08,998
My tastes are very

471
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,251
singular.

472
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:14,045
You wouldn't understand.

473
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:24,013
Enlighten me, then.

474
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:02,468
You look beautiful.

475
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:06,139
Taylor has good taste.

476
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:10,893
What are you doing later?

477
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:13,980
I'm working at the
hardware store until 7:00.

478
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:16,190
I'll have Taylor
pick you up then.

479
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:23,698
I would like to bite that lip.

480
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:27,618
I think I'd like that, too.

481
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:29,787
I'm not gonna touch you.

482
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:31,664
Not until I have
your written consent.

483
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:34,584
What?

484
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:35,835
I'll explain later.

485
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:37,545
Come, I'll take you home.

486
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:52,101
Fuck the paperwork.

487
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:09,994
As I was saying...

488
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:18,211
What is it about elevators?

489
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:29,972
Hey.

490
00:31:32,016 --> 00:31:33,893
Hi. You must be Ana.

491
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,478
You must be Elliot.

492
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:37,397
And we must be going.
Elliot...

493
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:39,023
So awesome to meet you.

494
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:41,275
Kate's told me a lot about you.

495
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:44,195
Elliot, find your shoes. Some
of us have work to attend to.

496
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:45,863
What you're doing with
Mr. Warmth here,

497
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,323
I have no idea.

498
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:52,120
Laters, baby.

499
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,040
I'll see you tonight.

500
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:58,042
E-mail me
if something changes.

501
00:31:58,209 --> 00:31:59,460
My computer's broken.

502
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:02,171
Call, then.
I know you have my number.

503
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:05,425
Laters, baby.

504
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,641
Elliot seems
like a really nice guy.

505
00:32:13,808 --> 00:32:15,268
Uh-uh. No, no.
We're starting with you.

506
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:16,686
If you're seeing
him again tonight,

507
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:18,312
that means that
something happened.

508
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:22,275
Ana.
Mmm-hmm.

509
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:23,693
Ana, you have to
tell me what happened.

510
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,653
I have to get ready for work.

511
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:27,530
We just kissed.

512
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,781
Once.

513
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:32,201
Only once? That's odd.

514
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:33,369
Mmm.

515
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,456
"Odd" doesn't even cover it.

516
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:37,540
Uh-huh.

517
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:38,958
And a new jacket.

518
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:40,835
Hmm.

519
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:56,017
Bye.

520
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,562
Hi. It's Taylor, right?

521
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:03,357
Good evening, Miss Steele. Mr.
Grey will be joining us there.

522
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,749
Good evening, Anastasia.

523
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:37,767
Wait. You're flying this?

524
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:56,619
No escaping now.

525
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:05,419
November 1-2-2-4. Charlie
Tango, ready to depart.

526
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:06,546
Roger that, Charlie Tango.

527
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,464
Your flight plan from Portland
to Seattle is cleared.

528
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:11,384
Seattle?
That's where we're going?

529
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,323
Would you like a drink?

530
00:35:15,698 --> 00:35:17,116
Yes, please.

531
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:32,006
Wow.

532
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:44,518
Do you play?

533
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:46,979
Yes.

534
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:51,400
Of course you do.

535
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,908
What's this?

536
00:36:01,202 --> 00:36:03,371
It's a non-disclosure
agreement.

537
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:05,706
It means that you cannot discuss

538
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:08,417
anything about us with anyone.

539
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:11,504
I'm afraid my lawyer
insists on it.

540
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:14,924
I'd never talk to
anyone about us, anyway.

541
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:28,437
Are you gonna
make love to me now?

542
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:34,568
Two things.

543
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:37,405
First, I don't make love.

544
00:36:39,073 --> 00:36:40,700
I fuck.

545
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:41,992
Hard.

546
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:46,872
And the second thing?

547
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,960
Come.

548
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:05,224
It's just beyond this door.

549
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:07,309
What is?

550
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:09,103
My play room.

551
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:11,772
Like your Xbox and stuff?

552
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:15,401
It's important that you know
you can leave at any time.

553
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:17,111
Why? What's in there?

554
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:19,572
I meant what I said.

555
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:22,158
The helicopter's on standby to
take you whenever you wanna go.

556
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:23,659
Christian, just open the door.

557
00:37:42,011 --> 00:37:44,096
Oh, my God.

558
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:25,471
It's called a flogger.

559
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:37,399
Say something, please.

560
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:45,282
Do women do this to you?
Or do you...

561
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:47,910
No, I do this to women.
With women.

562
00:38:48,536 --> 00:38:50,913
Women who want me to.

563
00:39:00,464 --> 00:39:01,924
You're a sadist?

564
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:03,759
I'm a dominant.

565
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:05,219
What does that mean?

566
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:08,138
It means I want you to willingly
surrender yourself to me.

567
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:10,891
Why would I do that?

568
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:13,269
To please me.

569
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:15,646
To please you?

570
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:16,772
How?

571
00:39:16,814 --> 00:39:17,982
I have rules.

572
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:21,068
If you follow them,
I'll reward you.

573
00:39:21,235 --> 00:39:23,445
If you don't, I'll punish you.

574
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:25,072
You'll punish me...

575
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:27,283
Like, you'd use
this stuff on me?

576
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:29,785
Yes.

577
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:33,122
What would I get out of this?

578
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:37,167
Me.

579
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,349
If we were to do this,

580
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:55,311
this would be your room.

581
00:39:55,686 --> 00:39:58,522
You can decorate it
however you like.

582
00:40:00,316 --> 00:40:01,942
You want me to move in?

583
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:05,029
Not full time.
Just Friday through to Sunday.

584
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:06,697
We can negotiate
the particulars.

585
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:10,242
So, uh...

586
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:12,328
So, I'd sleep in here with you?

587
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:15,164
No. I'd be downstairs.

588
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:17,833
I told you,
I don't sleep with anyone.

589
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:22,421
What if I don't want
anything to do with that?

590
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:24,673
I would understand completely.

591
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,426
But then we wouldn't have any
sort of relationship at all?

592
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:30,679
This is the only sort
of relationship I have.

593
00:40:31,722 --> 00:40:33,223
Why?

594
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:38,103
It's the way I am.

595
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:47,863
When you said "negotiate,"

596
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,239
what did you mean?

597
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:53,869
I already have a contract prepared.
It's fairly detailed.

598
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:55,204
You would review it,

599
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:59,166
and we would negotiate what you
are and are not willing to try.

600
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:01,835
How could I know what
I'd be willing to try?

601
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:03,504
Well, when you've had sex

602
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:06,715
was there anything that
you didn't like doing?

603
00:41:09,802 --> 00:41:13,430
We have to be honest with each
other for this to work, okay?

604
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,770
I wouldn't know.

605
00:41:21,438 --> 00:41:22,898
What do you mean?

606
00:41:25,818 --> 00:41:28,737
Because I haven't...

607
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:30,906
You're still a virgin?

608
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,741
I have just shown you...

609
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:34,910
I know. I just...

610
00:41:35,244 --> 00:41:37,246
You've done other things, right?

611
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,248
No.

612
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:49,591
Where have you been?

613
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:52,469
Waiting.

614
00:41:53,429 --> 00:41:56,098
Men must throw
themselves at you.

615
00:41:57,725 --> 00:41:59,601
Never one I've wanted.

616
00:42:05,441 --> 00:42:07,317
You're biting your lip.

617
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,413
What are you doing?

618
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,498
Rectifying the situation.

619
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,500
I'm a situation?

620
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:36,877
Mmm.

621
00:47:25,253 --> 00:47:26,755
You're energetic this morning.

622
00:47:28,673 --> 00:47:29,758
You hungry?

623
00:47:30,842 --> 00:47:32,010
Very.

624
00:47:35,388 --> 00:47:37,766
Because I'm making pancakes.

625
00:47:45,106 --> 00:47:46,900
Let's get you cleaned up.

626
00:48:37,075 --> 00:48:38,910
Do you trust me?

627
00:48:50,839 --> 00:48:52,590
Stay here.

628
00:49:08,606 --> 00:49:10,108
Hold out your wrists.

629
00:49:26,749 --> 00:49:28,168
Hold them there.

630
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,003
You understand?

631
00:49:31,921 --> 00:49:33,756
Tell me you understand.

632
00:49:35,258 --> 00:49:37,135
I won't move my arms.

633
00:49:37,969 --> 00:49:39,345
Good girl.

634
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,148
Stay still.

635
00:49:50,315 --> 00:49:51,524
Okay.

636
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:02,160
Say "yes."

637
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:03,661
To what?

638
00:50:04,162 --> 00:50:05,538
To being mine.

639
00:50:09,667 --> 00:50:11,878
No need
to announce me. Christian!

640
00:50:12,045 --> 00:50:13,379
Shit.
What?

641
00:50:13,546 --> 00:50:14,923
It's my mother.

642
00:50:18,676 --> 00:50:20,511
I'm naked.
Get dressed.

643
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:25,183
And there's no need
to show me around.

644
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:26,809
And there's no need to hover.

645
00:50:26,976 --> 00:50:28,186
He's still sleeping,
Dr. Grey.

646
00:50:28,353 --> 00:50:29,354
He's still sleeping?

647
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,856
But he never sleeps in.
Certainly not at this hour.

648
00:50:32,023 --> 00:50:33,358
Unless, of course,
he's ill. Is he... Ah.

649
00:50:34,192 --> 00:50:35,360
Sorry, Mr. Grey.

650
00:50:35,526 --> 00:50:37,153
It's fine.
I know how she can be.

651
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,321
"She"?

652
00:50:38,363 --> 00:50:39,781
Well, if you're
trying to avoid me,

653
00:50:39,864 --> 00:50:40,865
the very least you can do

654
00:50:40,907 --> 00:50:44,535
is call me by my correct
name, which would be "Mum."

655
00:50:44,702 --> 00:50:45,870
Hi.

656
00:50:46,496 --> 00:50:47,914
Oh. Dear God.

657
00:50:47,997 --> 00:50:49,374
Mother, Anastasia Steele.

658
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:52,085
Ana, meet my mother,
Dr. Grace Trevelyan Grey.

659
00:50:52,252 --> 00:50:55,546
You have no idea how
delighted I am to meet you.

660
00:50:55,713 --> 00:50:57,715
It's nice to meet you,
too, Dr. Grey.

661
00:50:57,882 --> 00:50:58,883
"Grace."

662
00:50:58,925 --> 00:51:01,594
She's very pretty.
You're very pretty.

663
00:51:01,761 --> 00:51:03,054
Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

664
00:51:03,554 --> 00:51:06,266
So, what happened to
calling before dropping by?

665
00:51:06,432 --> 00:51:08,351
And have your henchmen
give me the runaround?

666
00:51:08,393 --> 00:51:10,895
No, thank you.
I'll take my chances.

667
00:51:11,062 --> 00:51:12,272
Anyway, I was in
the neighborhood,

668
00:51:12,355 --> 00:51:14,399
and I thought perhaps
we could have lunch.

669
00:51:14,565 --> 00:51:16,567
I can't today.
I have to drive Ana home.

670
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:21,239
It's okay. Take it.
I was just showing Mother out.

671
00:51:21,364 --> 00:51:22,365
Excuse me.

672
00:51:24,242 --> 00:51:25,785
Anastasia...
Kate, hold on.

673
00:51:25,868 --> 00:51:27,578
It was a joy to meet you.

674
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:28,913
And I'm having the whole family

675
00:51:28,997 --> 00:51:30,581
for dinner next week
at my house.

676
00:51:30,748 --> 00:51:32,917
Christian's sister,
Mia, is back from Paris.

677
00:51:33,084 --> 00:51:34,127
You must come.

678
00:51:34,377 --> 00:51:35,420
We'll see, Mother.

679
00:51:35,586 --> 00:51:36,587
Nice to meet you.

680
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:38,131
You, too.

681
00:51:41,968 --> 00:51:43,720
Thank you.

682
00:51:48,474 --> 00:51:50,727
I can't talk about
it right now, Kate.

683
00:51:55,648 --> 00:51:57,817
I gotta go.
I'll call you back, okay?

684
00:52:16,085 --> 00:52:18,338
Everything okay
with the phone call?

685
00:52:20,173 --> 00:52:22,050
Yeah. Nothing important.

686
00:52:22,592 --> 00:52:24,177
I liked your mom.

687
00:52:24,969 --> 00:52:28,473
She's excited. She's never
seen me with a woman before.

688
00:52:28,806 --> 00:52:30,600
It was a first.

689
00:52:35,855 --> 00:52:37,690
What is it, Ana?

690
00:52:38,232 --> 00:52:39,275
Um...

691
00:52:39,317 --> 00:52:40,526
I just...

692
00:52:41,527 --> 00:52:43,154
How many women
have stayed in here?

693
00:52:45,156 --> 00:52:46,324
Fifteen.

694
00:52:48,785 --> 00:52:50,620
That's a lot of women.

695
00:52:51,037 --> 00:52:52,705
I told you before,
if you want out...

696
00:52:52,872 --> 00:52:54,040
I don't want out. I just...

697
00:52:54,123 --> 00:52:56,167
I'm not exactly jumping
at the opportunity

698
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,920
to get whipped and tortured
in your red room of pain.

699
00:52:59,003 --> 00:53:01,214
That room is much more
about pleasure.

700
00:53:01,381 --> 00:53:03,132
Promise you.

701
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:10,390
Would we still go out
to dinner and movies?

702
00:53:11,015 --> 00:53:13,351
That's not really my thing.

703
00:53:15,353 --> 00:53:17,397
Try to keep an open mind.

704
00:53:20,149 --> 00:53:22,527
If you agree to be
my submissive,

705
00:53:22,693 --> 00:53:24,695
I will be devoted to you.

706
00:53:26,531 --> 00:53:28,825
This is what I want.

707
00:53:28,991 --> 00:53:30,910
And I want it with you.

708
00:53:35,665 --> 00:53:37,542
Why do I have to sleep in here?

709
00:53:38,543 --> 00:53:40,378
We slept in the same bed
last night.

710
00:53:40,711 --> 00:53:42,588
Like normal people.

711
00:53:43,005 --> 00:53:45,925
Try not to get hung up on
the sleeping arrangements.

712
00:53:46,092 --> 00:53:47,844
If you agree to do this,

713
00:53:47,885 --> 00:53:49,220
you're gonna want your own room.

714
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:52,348
Why, because I'll
be your sex slave?

715
00:53:52,515 --> 00:53:55,268
I don't wanna do this here.
Let's talk downstairs.

716
00:53:55,435 --> 00:53:56,436
No. You know what?

717
00:53:56,519 --> 00:53:57,812
I think I'll hold
on to my free will

718
00:53:57,895 --> 00:54:00,106
a little while longer,
thank you.

719
00:54:03,609 --> 00:54:05,945
Actually, you know what? I would
like to go home. Can I go home?

720
00:54:10,575 --> 00:54:12,243
Which one's yours?

721
00:54:12,743 --> 00:54:14,120
All of them.

722
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,796
Let's go for a walk.

723
00:55:08,169 --> 00:55:10,630
How did you start doing this?

724
00:55:11,673 --> 00:55:14,009
One of my mother's friends.

725
00:55:14,843 --> 00:55:16,344
I was 15.

726
00:55:17,137 --> 00:55:19,014
She seduced you?

727
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:21,016
I was her submissive
for six years.

728
00:55:21,182 --> 00:55:22,684
Seriously?

729
00:55:24,352 --> 00:55:26,021
Does your mother know that?

730
00:55:26,187 --> 00:55:27,897
Of course not.

731
00:55:28,315 --> 00:55:32,569
No one in my family knows
about this part of me.

732
00:55:35,238 --> 00:55:38,199
So, she introduced you
to all this?

733
00:55:38,366 --> 00:55:40,368
Mrs. Robinson?

734
00:55:40,744 --> 00:55:42,370
"Mrs. Robinson."

735
00:55:43,204 --> 00:55:45,498
I'll tell her you said that.
She'll love it.

736
00:55:46,041 --> 00:55:48,001
You still talk to her?

737
00:55:48,835 --> 00:55:50,378
On occasion.

738
00:55:50,545 --> 00:55:52,047
We're friends.

739
00:56:00,305 --> 00:56:01,514
Ana.

740
00:56:02,057 --> 00:56:03,975
I know how intimidating this is.

741
00:56:04,267 --> 00:56:06,186
I felt the same at first.

742
00:56:08,355 --> 00:56:10,065
Well, what changed your mind?

743
00:56:15,737 --> 00:56:18,865
By giving up control,
I felt free.

744
00:56:19,824 --> 00:56:23,703
From responsibility,
from making decisions.

745
00:56:24,913 --> 00:56:26,247
I felt safe.

746
00:56:26,748 --> 00:56:28,708
You will, too, you'll see.

747
00:56:32,879 --> 00:56:36,091
I've never taken anyone
in the helicopter.

748
00:56:36,549 --> 00:56:39,594
I've never had sex
in my own bed.

749
00:56:41,971 --> 00:56:44,057
I've never slept next to anyone.

750
00:56:45,016 --> 00:56:46,518
Ever.

751
00:56:50,188 --> 00:56:51,564
Only you.

752
00:57:13,461 --> 00:57:14,712
This is the contract.

753
00:57:15,126 --> 00:57:16,670
Read it carefully.

754
00:57:16,836 --> 00:57:18,797
E-mail me if you
have any questions.

755
00:57:19,464 --> 00:57:21,341
I told you, my computer's down.

756
00:57:21,508 --> 00:57:23,301
Just consider it, okay?

757
00:57:28,682 --> 00:57:30,976
I really hope you say yes.

758
00:57:40,902 --> 00:57:42,362
Thanks for the ride.

759
00:57:42,404 --> 00:57:43,405
Laters, baby.

760
00:57:48,577 --> 00:57:49,578
Um...

761
00:57:50,203 --> 00:57:51,663
Okay, you're all set.

762
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:52,872
Your roommate let me in.

763
00:57:52,956 --> 00:57:55,792
I just figured that you forgot to
tell me about it. Do I look okay?

764
00:57:55,917 --> 00:57:57,836
- Tell you about what?
- Just sign here.

765
00:57:58,003 --> 00:57:59,713
Hold on. Do you have
the right apartment?

766
00:57:59,879 --> 00:58:01,256
Anastasia Steele?

767
00:58:08,263 --> 00:58:09,306
Enjoy.

768
00:58:09,723 --> 00:58:10,890
Another gift, huh?

769
00:58:11,224 --> 00:58:13,602
Whatever happened
to flowers and chocolates?

770
00:58:13,768 --> 00:58:15,020
I'm dying to hear everything.

771
00:58:15,061 --> 00:58:17,272
But I have to run right now, because
Elliot and I are having dinner

772
00:58:17,439 --> 00:58:19,274
and then we're going to
see a show at The Gorge.

773
00:58:19,441 --> 00:58:22,068
José called for you.
Twice, by the way.

774
00:58:22,569 --> 00:58:23,737
Did the mail already come?

775
00:58:24,863 --> 00:58:26,573
Oh. Um, no, this is...

776
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,783
These are my thesis notes.
I left them at school.

777
00:58:28,908 --> 00:58:32,120
Oh. All right. Well,
there's yesterday's mail.

778
00:58:40,337 --> 00:58:41,338
What?

779
00:58:41,755 --> 00:58:42,922
I don't know.

780
00:58:43,089 --> 00:58:45,258
You look different.

781
00:58:46,259 --> 00:58:48,303
I feel different.

782
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:49,763
Of course you do.

783
00:58:51,264 --> 00:58:52,390
Okay.

784
00:58:53,183 --> 00:58:54,184
Okay.

785
00:58:54,267 --> 00:58:55,560
Bye!

786
00:59:48,191 --> 00:59:50,193
The fundamental
purpose of this contract

787
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,237
is to allow
the Submissive to explore

788
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,697
her sensuality and
her limits safely.

789
00:59:55,657 --> 00:59:58,368
The Dominant and Submissive
agree and acknowledge

790
00:59:58,535 --> 01:00:00,995
that all that occurs under
the terms of this contract

791
01:00:01,162 --> 01:00:03,540
will be consensual,
confidential,

792
01:00:03,706 --> 01:00:05,333
and subject to the agreed limits

793
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:08,378
and safety procedures
set out in this contract.

794
01:00:10,547 --> 01:00:11,589
The Submissive will agree

795
01:00:11,673 --> 01:00:15,301
to any sexual activity deemed fit
and pleasurable by the Dominant,

796
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:18,555
excepting those activities
outlined in Hard Limits.

797
01:00:21,224 --> 01:00:22,475
...so much.
Thank you.

798
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:26,437
The Submissive will not drink to excess,
smoke, or take recreational drugs,

799
01:00:26,813 --> 01:00:29,274
or put her person into
any unnecessary risk.

800
01:00:31,526 --> 01:00:34,028
The Submissive will not
enter into sexual relations

801
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:36,072
with anyone other than
the Dominant.

802
01:00:37,949 --> 01:00:40,577
The Submissive agrees to
procure oral contraception

803
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:43,788
from a physician
of the Dominant's choosing.

804
01:00:44,122 --> 01:00:45,748
The Submissive
will eat regularly

805
01:00:45,832 --> 01:00:47,500
to maintain her
health and well-being

806
01:00:47,584 --> 01:00:50,253
from a prescribed
list of foods. Appendix Four.

807
01:00:51,504 --> 01:00:54,716
The Submissive will obey any
instruction given by the Dominant.

808
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:57,886
She will do so eagerly
and without hesitation.

809
01:00:59,929 --> 01:01:01,890
The Submissive may not
touch the Dominant

810
01:01:01,931 --> 01:01:04,267
without his expressed
permission to do so.

811
01:01:05,685 --> 01:01:07,437
The Submissive shall
always conduct herself

812
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,397
in a respectful manner
to the Dominant,

813
01:01:09,439 --> 01:01:12,483
and she'll address him only
as "Sir," "Mr. Grey..."

814
01:01:12,775 --> 01:01:15,111
...or such other title
as the Dominant may direct.

815
01:01:16,821 --> 01:01:21,117
The Dominant may flog, spank, whip,
or corporally punish the Submissive

816
01:01:21,159 --> 01:01:24,287
as he sees fit,
for purposes of discipline

817
01:01:24,621 --> 01:01:25,914
or for his personal enjoyment.

818
01:01:26,456 --> 01:01:28,207
The safeword "Yellow"
will be used

819
01:01:28,291 --> 01:01:30,001
to bring to the attention
of the Dominant

820
01:01:30,251 --> 01:01:32,462
that the Submissive
is close to her limit.

821
01:01:32,545 --> 01:01:34,756
When the safeword
"Red" is spoken,

822
01:01:34,797 --> 01:01:37,842
the Dominant's action will cease
completely and immediately.

823
01:01:42,221 --> 01:01:46,100
Does the Submissive consent to being
restrained with hands bound in front?

824
01:01:46,184 --> 01:01:47,977
Does the Submissive consent
to being blindfolded?

825
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:51,689
Does the Submissive consent
to being gagged?

826
01:01:51,856 --> 01:01:55,401
How much pain is the Submissive
willing to experience?

827
01:02:33,398 --> 01:02:34,691
Christian.

828
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:38,277
It's been "nice"
knowing me, has it?

829
01:02:51,374 --> 01:02:55,128
Let me remind you
how "nice" it was.

830
01:03:02,927 --> 01:03:04,721
Is this what you want?

831
01:03:32,206 --> 01:03:33,207
Don't make a sound.

832
01:05:00,753 --> 01:05:02,338
Was this "nice"?

833
01:05:34,370 --> 01:05:36,414
That was really nice.

834
01:05:44,088 --> 01:05:46,215
What are you doing to me?

835
01:06:04,187 --> 01:06:05,313
What about here?

836
01:06:08,525 --> 01:06:09,651
Why not?

837
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:12,362
Is it breaking the rules?

838
01:06:15,782 --> 01:06:17,325
Speaking of which...

839
01:06:18,326 --> 01:06:21,121
I haven't made up my mind yet.

840
01:06:27,127 --> 01:06:28,670
You're not staying?

841
01:06:30,338 --> 01:06:33,466
I told you,
I don't sleep with anyone.

842
01:06:35,301 --> 01:06:37,512
Well, can we negotiate?

843
01:07:58,968 --> 01:08:01,763
Now, that's a hell of a sack,
Miss Steele.

844
01:08:10,396 --> 01:08:12,273
Business meeting.

845
01:08:37,799 --> 01:08:38,967
Impressive.

846
01:08:39,801 --> 01:08:41,511
I've done this before.

847
01:08:43,847 --> 01:08:45,682
Business meetings, I mean.

848
01:08:46,516 --> 01:08:47,517
Oh.

849
01:08:47,976 --> 01:08:49,185
Miss Steele.
Hmm?

850
01:08:49,477 --> 01:08:50,478
Your meeting.

851
01:08:52,522 --> 01:08:53,606
Page one.

852
01:08:54,315 --> 01:08:57,360
Strike out my old address and
replace with the new one.

853
01:08:57,443 --> 01:08:59,362
An oversight. Duly noted.

854
01:08:59,696 --> 01:09:02,782
Page three, section 1520.

855
01:09:02,949 --> 01:09:05,326
"The Submissive
shall submit to any

856
01:09:05,368 --> 01:09:07,495
"sexual activity
demanded by the Dominant

857
01:09:07,662 --> 01:09:11,749
"and shall do so without
hesitation or argument."

858
01:09:18,006 --> 01:09:20,341
Uh, turn to page five.

859
01:09:20,508 --> 01:09:22,719
Appendix Three,
"Soft Limits."

860
01:09:22,969 --> 01:09:23,970
With you.

861
01:09:24,679 --> 01:09:26,639
Find "anal fisting."

862
01:09:26,806 --> 01:09:27,932
I'm all ears.

863
01:09:28,349 --> 01:09:29,392
Strike it out.

864
01:09:34,856 --> 01:09:36,149
Strike out
"vaginal fisting," too.

865
01:09:36,941 --> 01:09:38,026
Are you sure?

866
01:09:38,401 --> 01:09:39,694
Yep.

867
01:09:41,696 --> 01:09:44,866
Same page, "Is the use of sex toys
acceptable to the Submissive?"

868
01:09:45,033 --> 01:09:48,077
Vibrators, okay.
Dildos, fine.

869
01:09:48,745 --> 01:09:50,538
Genital clamps?

870
01:09:50,705 --> 01:09:52,206
Absolutely not.

871
01:09:52,373 --> 01:09:54,334
Consider them gone.

872
01:09:56,878 --> 01:09:58,338
What are butt plugs?

873
01:10:13,937 --> 01:10:17,357
You must go through quite a few
non-disclosure agreements.

874
01:10:17,732 --> 01:10:20,526
My staff know only what
I choose to tell them.

875
01:10:21,069 --> 01:10:23,571
Please resume, Miss Steele.

876
01:10:26,115 --> 01:10:29,786
Also on page five, there are some
terms which need clarification.

877
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,580
"Suspension"?

878
01:10:32,914 --> 01:10:34,624
Hanging on ropes
from the ceiling.

879
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:37,460
For what possible reason?

880
01:10:37,752 --> 01:10:38,962
For your pleasure.

881
01:10:39,587 --> 01:10:40,588
Really?

882
01:10:40,755 --> 01:10:42,382
And mine.

883
01:10:43,091 --> 01:10:44,384
Something to consider.

884
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:45,718
No. Hard limit.

885
01:10:51,432 --> 01:10:53,476
I'm good with rope,

886
01:10:53,643 --> 01:10:56,145
leather cuffs, handcuffs.

887
01:10:56,312 --> 01:10:58,231
Please lose "tape."

888
01:11:00,066 --> 01:11:01,401
And what's "Other"?

889
01:11:03,277 --> 01:11:05,071
Cable ties.

890
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:10,034
Can I just say
how impressed I am

891
01:11:10,118 --> 01:11:11,661
with your commitment
to this meeting?

892
01:11:13,454 --> 01:11:16,958
And in that spirit, I'm
gonna throw in a sweetener.

893
01:11:17,959 --> 01:11:19,752
How about once a week,

894
01:11:19,919 --> 01:11:22,130
on a night of your choosing,

895
01:11:22,296 --> 01:11:24,132
we go on a date?

896
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:26,843
Just like a regular couple.

897
01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:29,637
Dinner, movie,

898
01:11:30,138 --> 01:11:31,305
ice skating.

899
01:11:31,639 --> 01:11:33,266
Whatever you want.

900
01:11:35,476 --> 01:11:36,686
Accepted.

901
01:11:37,145 --> 01:11:38,980
You're very kind.

902
01:11:39,981 --> 01:11:41,983
I'll suggest it
in Appendix Five.

903
01:11:57,540 --> 01:12:00,293
I would like to fuck you into
the middle of next week.

904
01:12:03,004 --> 01:12:04,672
You're not fighting fair.

905
01:12:05,673 --> 01:12:06,966
I never have.

906
01:12:08,676 --> 01:12:12,638
I'll review all these changes and
try to arrive at a decision.

907
01:12:13,514 --> 01:12:14,849
You wanna leave?

908
01:12:15,558 --> 01:12:16,726
Yes.

909
01:12:16,893 --> 01:12:18,936
But your body tells me
something different.

910
01:12:20,646 --> 01:12:22,565
Your legs, for instance.

911
01:12:23,357 --> 01:12:27,153
The way you're pressing your
thighs together under the table.

912
01:12:27,695 --> 01:12:29,197
And the change
in your breathing.

913
01:12:31,824 --> 01:12:33,367
And in your complexion.

914
01:12:33,785 --> 01:12:35,036
My complexion?

915
01:12:35,411 --> 01:12:36,579
You're flushed.

916
01:12:36,996 --> 01:12:38,539
That could just be the wine.

917
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,333
It's the adrenaline.

918
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:51,511
Say I did stay.

919
01:12:53,346 --> 01:12:54,597
What would happen?

920
01:12:55,515 --> 01:12:56,724
First,

921
01:12:57,850 --> 01:13:00,436
I would help you out of
that little dress of yours.

922
01:13:01,062 --> 01:13:02,063
Yes.

923
01:13:02,563 --> 01:13:05,608
And I'd be pleased to discover
that you're naked underneath.

924
01:13:06,067 --> 01:13:07,735
Really?

925
01:13:09,612 --> 01:13:11,239
Then I would bend you over.

926
01:13:12,073 --> 01:13:13,407
Right here?

927
01:13:13,908 --> 01:13:15,034
Yes.

928
01:13:16,119 --> 01:13:17,745
On this table?

929
01:13:18,788 --> 01:13:19,956
Yes.

930
01:13:38,724 --> 01:13:41,102
Thank you for the meeting,
Mr. Grey.

931
01:13:51,612 --> 01:13:53,114
This is me.

932
01:13:55,241 --> 01:13:58,619
Didn't know I was a collector
of classic cars, huh?

933
01:14:00,496 --> 01:14:02,123
You sure I can't
persuade you to stay?

934
01:14:03,457 --> 01:14:04,750
Good night, Christian.

935
01:14:05,001 --> 01:14:06,460
When will you know?

936
01:14:06,794 --> 01:14:09,297
Soon, maybe.

937
01:14:18,472 --> 01:14:21,309
Why do I think
you're telling me goodbye?

938
01:14:22,143 --> 01:14:23,978
Because I'm leaving.

939
01:14:30,193 --> 01:14:32,278
You got your
valedictory speech ready?

940
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,446
Oh, more or less.

941
01:14:33,487 --> 01:14:34,697
Annie!

942
01:14:34,864 --> 01:14:36,032
Dad!

943
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:38,492
Hi!

944
01:14:38,659 --> 01:14:40,786
Sorry I'm late. I had
a hell of a time parking.

945
01:14:40,953 --> 01:14:43,080
That's okay. You're here,
that's all that matters.

946
01:14:43,164 --> 01:14:44,874
You kidding me? I wouldn't
miss this for the world.

947
01:14:44,999 --> 01:14:46,667
I saved you a seat
next to Kate's parents.

948
01:14:46,751 --> 01:14:47,752
Anywhere you
want me, sweetheart.

949
01:14:47,835 --> 01:14:49,086
Okay. I'll see you after. Yeah.

950
01:14:49,170 --> 01:14:50,421
Good luck up there.

951
01:14:50,588 --> 01:14:53,633
And he's also a major
benefactor to our university.

952
01:14:54,508 --> 01:14:58,221
Please join me in welcoming
Mr. Christian Grey.

953
01:15:12,985 --> 01:15:14,487
Thank you.

954
01:15:14,695 --> 01:15:18,407
I am deeply moved by the great
compliment accorded to me today.

955
01:15:19,033 --> 01:15:20,701
He is so hot.

956
01:15:20,868 --> 01:15:23,746
Oh, God. He so is.

957
01:15:26,582 --> 01:15:28,834
I heard he's gay.

958
01:15:30,836 --> 01:15:32,380
The goal?

959
01:15:32,546 --> 01:15:37,218
To help eradicate hunger and
poverty across the globe.

960
01:15:40,513 --> 01:15:42,848
I myself

961
01:15:43,015 --> 01:15:45,142
have known what it's like
to be profoundly hungry.

962
01:15:45,851 --> 01:15:48,604
So this is a very
personal mission for me.

963
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,776
Megan Soliah.

964
01:15:57,238 --> 01:15:59,782
Anastasia Steele.

965
01:16:04,078 --> 01:16:06,205
Nancy Hines.

966
01:16:06,414 --> 01:16:08,624
Congratulations.
You should be very proud.

967
01:16:08,791 --> 01:16:09,917
I am.

968
01:16:10,084 --> 01:16:11,419
Nice tie, by the way.

969
01:16:11,585 --> 01:16:13,587
It's recently
become my favorite.

970
01:16:14,088 --> 01:16:15,298
Do you have your answer yet?

971
01:16:15,798 --> 01:16:17,425
I'm still thinking.

972
01:16:17,591 --> 01:16:19,885
Anastasia, just try it
my way. Please.

973
01:16:20,928 --> 01:16:21,929
Okay.

974
01:16:21,971 --> 01:16:22,972
What?

975
01:16:26,934 --> 01:16:28,936
Congratulations.
Thank you.

976
01:16:29,603 --> 01:16:32,398
We did it, we did it, we did it!

977
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:33,983
Dad! Hi.

978
01:16:34,066 --> 01:16:35,735
I am so proud of you, Annie.

979
01:16:35,776 --> 01:16:36,902
Thank you.

980
01:16:37,445 --> 01:16:39,613
And, Kate, best
valedictorian speech ever.

981
01:16:39,739 --> 01:16:41,115
Oh, thank you.
It was awesome.

982
01:16:41,198 --> 01:16:43,367
Yeah...
Ana. Hi.

983
01:16:43,617 --> 01:16:44,744
Hi.

984
01:16:44,952 --> 01:16:47,455
Ray, have you met Christian
Grey, Ana's boyfriend?

985
01:16:47,621 --> 01:16:49,665
Hi. Great pleasure
to meet you.

986
01:16:49,832 --> 01:16:51,417
Likewise. I really
enjoyed your speech.

987
01:16:51,584 --> 01:16:52,585
Thank you, sir.

988
01:16:52,626 --> 01:16:54,628
Sounds like you have accomplished
some pretty impressive things.

989
01:16:54,712 --> 01:16:55,921
- I'll say.
- Thank you.

990
01:16:55,963 --> 01:16:57,298
Well, I'm gonna go
find my family

991
01:16:57,465 --> 01:16:59,467
who've been patiently
waiting to embarrass me.

992
01:16:59,633 --> 01:17:01,635
Bye. Come see us
in Seattle, okay?

993
01:17:01,677 --> 01:17:03,929
Yeah, as soon as I
get an invitation.

994
01:17:03,971 --> 01:17:05,848
So, how long have you two
known each other?

995
01:17:06,724 --> 01:17:08,601
Um... Mmm-hmm.
A few weeks, now.

996
01:17:08,768 --> 01:17:09,769
We actually met when Anastasia

997
01:17:09,810 --> 01:17:11,687
interviewed me for
the student newspaper.

998
01:17:11,971 --> 01:17:12,847
Uh, picture, please,
Mr. Grey?

999
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:14,515
Excuse us a moment.

1000
01:17:17,602 --> 01:17:19,979
Big smile, now.

1001
01:17:47,465 --> 01:17:49,425
To celebrate your graduation,

1002
01:17:49,592 --> 01:17:52,178
among other things.

1003
01:17:55,181 --> 01:17:56,766
Roll your eyes at me again

1004
01:17:56,933 --> 01:17:59,143
and I will take you
across my knee.

1005
01:18:00,186 --> 01:18:01,187
Oh.

1006
01:18:04,607 --> 01:18:06,484
So it begins.

1007
01:18:09,862 --> 01:18:11,697
Mmm. Come on. I have
something to show you.

1008
01:18:11,864 --> 01:18:12,865
What?

1009
01:18:21,531 --> 01:18:22,657
That's cute.

1010
01:18:23,825 --> 01:18:25,827
Doesn't really seem
like your style, though.

1011
01:18:26,328 --> 01:18:27,662
It's not.

1012
01:18:30,499 --> 01:18:32,125
Happy graduation, Anastasia.

1013
01:18:32,834 --> 01:18:33,835
Oh, my God.

1014
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:36,630
Christian, that's a car.

1015
01:18:37,047 --> 01:18:38,673
You don't miss much, do you?

1016
01:18:41,676 --> 01:18:43,970
Thank you, but I can't...

1017
01:18:44,137 --> 01:18:45,138
Do you like it?

1018
01:18:45,305 --> 01:18:47,474
Of course I like it.
It's beautiful.

1019
01:18:48,475 --> 01:18:50,519
But I have a car.

1020
01:18:52,479 --> 01:18:53,480
Where's my car?

1021
01:18:53,647 --> 01:18:54,898
I told Taylor to
fetch a decent price.

1022
01:18:55,524 --> 01:18:57,526
Oh, Christian,
this is way too much.

1023
01:18:57,692 --> 01:18:59,486
Did you just roll
your eyes at me?

1024
01:19:05,492 --> 01:19:06,493
Oh!

1025
01:19:07,536 --> 01:19:08,912
Do you know why I'm doing this?

1026
01:19:09,079 --> 01:19:10,664
Because I rolled my eyes.

1027
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:12,082
And is that polite?

1028
01:19:12,415 --> 01:19:14,125
No.

1029
01:19:14,584 --> 01:19:15,585
Excuse me?

1030
01:19:16,211 --> 01:19:17,379
No, sir.

1031
01:19:36,231 --> 01:19:37,732
Do you want more?

1032
01:19:46,616 --> 01:19:48,451
Welcome to my world.

1033
01:20:10,265 --> 01:20:11,433
What are you doing?

1034
01:20:12,225 --> 01:20:14,978
I have a few things at the office
that require my attention.

1035
01:20:16,104 --> 01:20:17,230
You okay?

1036
01:20:21,276 --> 01:20:22,319
I just thought that...

1037
01:20:22,485 --> 01:20:24,279
I enjoyed tonight.

1038
01:20:25,947 --> 01:20:28,325
I'll see you
at my place tomorrow.

1039
01:20:58,855 --> 01:21:00,190
Hi, Momma.

1040
01:21:00,357 --> 01:21:01,816
Anastasia, what's going on?

1041
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:04,277
I have left you two
messages this week.

1042
01:21:04,444 --> 01:21:06,780
I know. I'm sorry.

1043
01:21:07,322 --> 01:21:09,157
I just got a little distracted.

1044
01:21:09,324 --> 01:21:12,827
Sorry I missed your graduation, honey.
I heard it was lovely.

1045
01:21:12,994 --> 01:21:14,996
And your new beau?

1046
01:21:15,163 --> 01:21:18,500
Ray told me all about him. He
sounds like quite the young man.

1047
01:21:18,833 --> 01:21:20,377
Of course,
I would have preferred

1048
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:22,796
to have heard
about him from you.

1049
01:21:26,633 --> 01:21:28,009
Ana?

1050
01:21:28,677 --> 01:21:30,512
What's the matter?

1051
01:21:31,346 --> 01:21:33,264
Nothing. I'm fine.

1052
01:21:33,807 --> 01:21:35,850
Is he not making you happy?

1053
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:40,021
He is, yeah.
Most of the time, yeah.

1054
01:21:40,522 --> 01:21:42,565
It's complicated.

1055
01:21:44,359 --> 01:21:47,821
Listen, honey,
if you need a break,

1056
01:21:47,987 --> 01:21:50,323
you just come
right on down here.

1057
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:51,991
Even if it's for a day or two.

1058
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:55,704
I have air miles, and we could
talk and have girl time.

1059
01:21:56,830 --> 01:21:59,040
Promise me
you'll think about it.

1060
01:21:59,207 --> 01:22:01,000
Yeah, I promise.

1061
01:22:01,501 --> 01:22:03,002
I promise.

1062
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,255
I love you, Momma.

1063
01:22:05,422 --> 01:22:07,716
I love you, too, darling.

1064
01:22:08,216 --> 01:22:09,926
I gotta go.

1065
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:12,387
Bye.

1066
01:22:19,769 --> 01:22:22,731
Looks like you and Grey did
some celebrating last night.

1067
01:22:23,732 --> 01:22:25,400
Is he still asleep?

1068
01:22:25,567 --> 01:22:28,069
Uh... No, he couldn't stay.

1069
01:22:28,570 --> 01:22:30,196
Whose car keys are those, then?

1070
01:22:33,616 --> 01:22:35,285
Those are my keys.

1071
01:22:35,744 --> 01:22:37,537
Wow, Ana.

1072
01:22:39,289 --> 01:22:40,373
What?

1073
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:41,541
Nothing. I just...

1074
01:22:42,876 --> 01:22:44,961
Make sure you're taking it
at your own pace, okay?

1075
01:22:45,128 --> 01:22:47,422
I am, I am. I gotta go.

1076
01:22:47,589 --> 01:22:49,257
Where are you going?

1077
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,266
Look at this.

1078
01:22:58,433 --> 01:23:00,018
I've seen it.

1079
01:23:00,351 --> 01:23:02,103
It's not a bad picture.

1080
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:04,773
"Christian Grey
with friend."

1081
01:23:05,607 --> 01:23:07,150
It says we're friends.

1082
01:23:07,317 --> 01:23:09,527
Well, it must be true
if it's in the paper.

1083
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:10,653
Mmm.

1084
01:23:10,945 --> 01:23:12,614
So, how'd it go
with Dr. Greene?

1085
01:23:12,781 --> 01:23:14,157
It was fine.

1086
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,409
But she said that I
have to abstain from

1087
01:23:16,451 --> 01:23:18,453
all sexual activity
for at least four weeks.

1088
01:23:18,703 --> 01:23:20,205
You know,
after I start the pill.

1089
01:23:20,288 --> 01:23:21,289
What?

1090
01:23:24,334 --> 01:23:26,169
Just kidding.

1091
01:23:40,850 --> 01:23:43,228
I wanna take you
to my play room.

1092
01:23:44,646 --> 01:23:46,856
But I haven't signed
the contract.

1093
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:49,150
I'm well aware.

1094
01:23:49,317 --> 01:23:51,861
Call it due diligence.

1095
01:23:52,487 --> 01:23:53,988
Okay.

1096
01:23:59,577 --> 01:24:01,162
You ready?

1097
01:24:35,572 --> 01:24:37,115
Eyes down.

1098
01:24:39,117 --> 01:24:40,535
Take off your shoes.

1099
01:24:44,372 --> 01:24:46,416
Arms above your head.

1100
01:24:52,547 --> 01:24:54,424
You have a beautiful
body, Anastasia.

1101
01:25:00,054 --> 01:25:03,600
I want you unashamed of your nakedness.
Do you understand?

1102
01:25:04,392 --> 01:25:05,768
Yes, sir.

1103
01:25:07,312 --> 01:25:09,063
You're biting your lip.

1104
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:12,317
You know what that does
to me. Turn around.

1105
01:25:19,073 --> 01:25:21,659
When I tell you to
come into this room,

1106
01:25:21,826 --> 01:25:23,661
this is how you'll be.

1107
01:25:25,079 --> 01:25:26,748
You'll wait for me,

1108
01:25:27,624 --> 01:25:29,500
kneeling by the door.

1109
01:25:32,295 --> 01:25:33,922
Do it now.

1110
01:25:39,928 --> 01:25:42,347
Hands flat on your thighs.

1111
01:25:43,806 --> 01:25:45,266
Good.

1112
01:26:16,798 --> 01:26:18,716
Hold out your hand.

1113
01:26:45,201 --> 01:26:46,661
Did that hurt?

1114
01:26:47,328 --> 01:26:48,371
No.

1115
01:26:48,454 --> 01:26:49,455
You see?

1116
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:52,542
Most of your fear
is in your head.

1117
01:26:53,501 --> 01:26:54,752
Come.

1118
01:29:13,929 --> 01:29:15,597
How does it feel?

1119
01:29:16,431 --> 01:29:18,225
Good, sir.

1120
01:29:36,910 --> 01:29:37,911
Mmm.

1121
01:29:38,453 --> 01:29:39,788
Quiet.

1122
01:31:15,463 --> 01:31:16,464
Where are we going?

1123
01:31:21,761 --> 01:31:24,139
Remember my mother
mentioned dinner?

1124
01:31:24,306 --> 01:31:25,932
My sister Mia's in town.

1125
01:31:26,433 --> 01:31:27,809
Yeah.

1126
01:31:30,937 --> 01:31:32,355
You got everything you need?

1127
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:35,442
Yeah.

1128
01:31:36,318 --> 01:31:37,652
Dance with me.

1129
01:32:25,075 --> 01:32:26,159
Good evening, Mr. Grey.

1130
01:32:26,326 --> 01:32:27,911
They're here.

1131
01:32:28,370 --> 01:32:30,664
You're here.
Welcome, welcome.

1132
01:32:30,830 --> 01:32:32,249
Ana, Mother, you've met.

1133
01:32:32,332 --> 01:32:33,333
Hi. Good to see you. Come on in.

1134
01:32:33,375 --> 01:32:34,501
And this is my father, Carrick.

1135
01:32:34,668 --> 01:32:36,878
Hi, pleasure to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

1136
01:32:37,045 --> 01:32:38,838
Is she here? You are the
subject of some speculation.

1137
01:32:39,005 --> 01:32:41,675
Oh, my God, you exist!

1138
01:32:42,592 --> 01:32:45,178
It's a great apartment, and
the rent's not ridiculous.

1139
01:32:45,345 --> 01:32:47,180
Elliot and José
helped us move in.

1140
01:32:47,847 --> 01:32:49,015
José is Ana's friend.

1141
01:32:49,557 --> 01:32:52,310
Although, I think that
Elliot's trying to poach him.

1142
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:54,521
They've sparked
quite the bromance.

1143
01:32:54,688 --> 01:32:56,189
He's a cool guy.

1144
01:32:56,606 --> 01:32:58,858
Ana, where is your family from?

1145
01:32:59,442 --> 01:33:02,237
My stepfather lives in Montesano,
and my mom's in Georgia.

1146
01:33:02,404 --> 01:33:04,030
Georgia? Which part?

1147
01:33:04,197 --> 01:33:05,365
Savannah.

1148
01:33:05,532 --> 01:33:06,616
How nice.

1149
01:33:06,783 --> 01:33:09,744
Although, I do hear it gets rather
humid in Georgia this time of year.

1150
01:33:09,911 --> 01:33:11,204
Oh, my God, it does.

1151
01:33:11,621 --> 01:33:13,373
It's stifling sometimes.

1152
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:15,417
Actually, I'm going
to visit her tomorrow.

1153
01:33:15,875 --> 01:33:17,377
Oh, how nice.
Mmm-hmm.

1154
01:33:17,544 --> 01:33:19,045
You hear that, Christian?

1155
01:33:19,212 --> 01:33:22,632
Some children do visit their
parents now and again.

1156
01:33:24,217 --> 01:33:25,885
Hey, Dad, you catch
the Mariners game?

1157
01:33:26,052 --> 01:33:27,429
Uh, I heard it went
to extra innings.

1158
01:33:27,595 --> 01:33:29,597
Ugh. Seattle baseball...

1159
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:31,141
This is news to me.

1160
01:33:32,892 --> 01:33:34,311
When were you gonna tell me?

1161
01:33:35,228 --> 01:33:37,063
Who wants coffee?

1162
01:33:37,230 --> 01:33:40,483
Actually, I promised Ana
a tour of the grounds.

1163
01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:42,235
Excuse us.

1164
01:33:46,781 --> 01:33:50,243
Christian, I cannot walk
that fast in these shoes.

1165
01:33:51,453 --> 01:33:52,662
Oh.

1166
01:33:53,496 --> 01:33:55,415
When were you gonna
tell me about Georgia?

1167
01:33:55,582 --> 01:33:57,625
What? You have
no right to be mad.

1168
01:33:57,792 --> 01:34:00,754
Yeah, but I am mad.
Palm-twitchingly mad.

1169
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:01,921
Ow!

1170
01:34:05,091 --> 01:34:06,092
You're mine.

1171
01:34:06,259 --> 01:34:08,136
All mine, you understand?

1172
01:34:15,268 --> 01:34:17,354
Christian, you are so confusing.

1173
01:34:21,066 --> 01:34:22,067
Ana.

1174
01:34:22,484 --> 01:34:24,110
What do you want?

1175
01:34:25,111 --> 01:34:26,279
What do you want?

1176
01:34:26,446 --> 01:34:28,031
I want you.

1177
01:34:28,948 --> 01:34:30,950
I'm trying, Christian.

1178
01:34:35,205 --> 01:34:36,790
I know you are.

1179
01:34:37,624 --> 01:34:39,959
Why can't we sleep
in the same bed?

1180
01:34:40,668 --> 01:34:42,796
Why won't you let me touch you?

1181
01:34:43,296 --> 01:34:45,507
Why does it have
to be like this?

1182
01:34:52,347 --> 01:34:53,640
If you would just
sign the contract,

1183
01:34:53,723 --> 01:34:54,808
you wouldn't have
to think about...

1184
01:34:54,849 --> 01:34:56,851
Why do you care so much about
the contract, Christian?

1185
01:34:57,018 --> 01:34:59,062
Don't you like me the way I am?

1186
01:34:59,312 --> 01:35:00,563
Of course I do.

1187
01:35:00,814 --> 01:35:02,649
Then why are you
trying to change me?

1188
01:35:03,149 --> 01:35:04,651
I'm not.

1189
01:35:05,902 --> 01:35:06,903
It's...

1190
01:35:07,153 --> 01:35:09,989
I need more. I want more.

1191
01:35:11,157 --> 01:35:12,867
Hearts and flowers?

1192
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:15,662
That's not something I know.

1193
01:35:17,455 --> 01:35:18,998
Ana, please.

1194
01:35:21,126 --> 01:35:23,670
It's you that's changing me.

1195
01:35:25,171 --> 01:35:27,298
Let me touch you.

1196
01:35:28,007 --> 01:35:29,634
Let me.

1197
01:35:43,314 --> 01:35:44,899
Are they burns?

1198
01:35:46,025 --> 01:35:48,361
I had a rough start in life.

1199
01:35:48,528 --> 01:35:50,029
That's all you need to know.

1200
01:35:52,198 --> 01:35:53,700
Okay.

1201
01:36:16,222 --> 01:36:18,725
The woman that gave birth to me

1202
01:36:19,517 --> 01:36:21,603
was a crack addict

1203
01:36:22,353 --> 01:36:24,564
and a prostitute.

1204
01:36:28,735 --> 01:36:30,737
She died when I was four.

1205
01:36:34,407 --> 01:36:36,576
I remember certain things.

1206
01:36:39,704 --> 01:36:41,581
Terrible things.

1207
01:36:45,585 --> 01:36:47,754
But I don't remember her.

1208
01:36:50,757 --> 01:36:52,592
But sometimes,

1209
01:36:54,761 --> 01:36:57,222
I think I see her in my dreams.

1210
01:37:14,447 --> 01:37:15,448
Mmm.

1211
01:37:16,696 --> 01:37:18,824
Do you really have
to go to Georgia?

1212
01:37:22,994 --> 01:37:25,247
Yeah, I really do.

1213
01:37:29,668 --> 01:37:31,711
Good morning. 12-H is
down to your right.

1214
01:37:32,295 --> 01:37:34,548
Good morning. 2-B, oh
it's just right here.

1215
01:37:35,173 --> 01:37:36,967
Oh! No, I'm supposed
to be in coach.

1216
01:37:37,008 --> 01:37:38,635
Oh, you must have been upgraded.

1217
01:37:39,344 --> 01:37:42,973
Good morning. 12-A
just down to your right.

1218
01:37:43,723 --> 01:37:44,766
Good morning.

1219
01:38:28,351 --> 01:38:29,352
Oh.

1220
01:38:33,315 --> 01:38:35,984
Gazpacho is very healthy, Bob.

1221
01:38:36,151 --> 01:38:38,945
You'll get fat with all this
sitting around. You tell him, Ana.

1222
01:38:39,112 --> 01:38:40,363
I'm not gonna tell him that.

1223
01:38:40,530 --> 01:38:42,115
Yes, thank you, Ana.

1224
01:38:42,356 --> 01:38:45,734
I'm just saying that gazpacho is
basically eating a bowl of salsa.

1225
01:38:45,901 --> 01:38:48,737
You should hand me some chips
with my bowl of salsa here.

1226
01:38:48,904 --> 01:38:50,489
You can have a carrot.

1227
01:38:51,114 --> 01:38:52,616
What are you
getting at with this?

1228
01:38:53,742 --> 01:38:57,245
You are damn lucky that I just
happen to love you very much.

1229
01:38:57,412 --> 01:38:58,747
I know that.

1230
01:38:58,914 --> 01:39:00,791
Do you?
Mmm, I do.

1231
01:40:37,762 --> 01:40:39,473
Oh, darling, I think
we should pace ourselves.

1232
01:40:39,556 --> 01:40:40,557
Or at least order
something to eat.

1233
01:40:40,724 --> 01:40:42,934
You go ahead.
I'm not very hungry.

1234
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:45,854
Oh. I'll just have
the fruit salad.

1235
01:40:50,734 --> 01:40:52,235
He can wait.

1236
01:40:53,570 --> 01:40:54,863
Mom...

1237
01:40:57,908 --> 01:40:58,950
Holy fuck.

1238
01:40:59,117 --> 01:41:00,744
What? What is it?

1239
01:41:00,911 --> 01:41:03,747
It's Christian. He's here.

1240
01:41:03,830 --> 01:41:05,916
Um, in Georgia.

1241
01:41:07,542 --> 01:41:08,543
Oh.

1242
01:41:08,627 --> 01:41:09,920
"Here" here.

1243
01:41:10,086 --> 01:41:12,547
Mrs. Adams.
Delighted to meet you.

1244
01:41:12,714 --> 01:41:14,090
Something to drink, sir?

1245
01:41:14,257 --> 01:41:15,258
Gin and tonic.

1246
01:41:15,342 --> 01:41:16,384
Hendrick's, if you have it.

1247
01:41:16,426 --> 01:41:17,594
Otherwise, Bombay Sapphire.

1248
01:41:17,928 --> 01:41:19,971
Cucumber with the Hendrick's,
lime with the Bombay.

1249
01:41:20,138 --> 01:41:21,932
I like him already.

1250
01:41:22,098 --> 01:41:23,600
What are you doing here,
Christian?

1251
01:41:23,767 --> 01:41:25,060
I came to see you.

1252
01:41:25,769 --> 01:41:27,229
I'm gonna step
outside for a bit.

1253
01:41:37,739 --> 01:41:39,991
I broke rule seven, clause five.

1254
01:41:40,158 --> 01:41:41,576
Here.

1255
01:41:42,619 --> 01:41:44,120
We'll let it go.

1256
01:41:45,664 --> 01:41:48,083
Let's not talk about
the contract right now.

1257
01:41:48,458 --> 01:41:50,126
How was your dinner?

1258
01:41:53,630 --> 01:41:55,298
She's a friend.

1259
01:41:55,465 --> 01:41:56,508
That's all.

1260
01:41:56,675 --> 01:41:58,969
She's a child abuser.

1261
01:41:59,135 --> 01:42:00,470
I confide in her.

1262
01:42:00,845 --> 01:42:02,347
She knows me.

1263
01:42:03,473 --> 01:42:05,642
What did she advise you to do?

1264
01:42:06,643 --> 01:42:08,478
Well, I'm here.

1265
01:42:10,522 --> 01:42:12,190
And now what?

1266
01:42:12,816 --> 01:42:15,110
I've got a room in this hotel.

1267
01:42:16,319 --> 01:42:18,363
Well, I hope you'll
be comfortable in it.

1268
01:42:22,826 --> 01:42:25,287
What are you doing
for breakfast tomorrow?

1269
01:42:30,333 --> 01:42:31,918
Where are we going?

1270
01:42:32,002 --> 01:42:33,503
It's a surprise.

1271
01:42:34,004 --> 01:42:37,340
I think I've reached
my quota of surprises.

1272
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:40,510
We're almost there.

1273
01:42:47,309 --> 01:42:49,853
Mr. Grey. Hey.
I'll be your tow pilot.

1274
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:54,065
How do you do? This is my
girlfriend, Anastasia Steele.

1275
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:26,931
We're at 3,000 feet.
Y'all ready?

1276
01:43:27,223 --> 01:43:28,725
Well?

1277
01:43:28,892 --> 01:43:30,268
Yeah, do it.

1278
01:43:30,435 --> 01:43:31,895
Release.

1279
01:44:00,924 --> 01:44:02,634
Hold on tight.

1280
01:44:04,761 --> 01:44:05,929
Is this more?

1281
01:44:06,096 --> 01:44:08,640
Oh, my God. So much more!

1282
01:44:28,785 --> 01:44:32,122
Oh, my God. That was
incredible, Christian.

1283
01:44:32,664 --> 01:44:33,790
Thank you.

1284
01:44:33,957 --> 01:44:36,126
We aim to please, Miss Steele.

1285
01:44:36,626 --> 01:44:39,295
And you said you
didn't do romance.

1286
01:44:39,337 --> 01:44:40,338
I don't.

1287
01:44:41,172 --> 01:44:43,091
Ana.
Mmm. What?

1288
01:44:43,675 --> 01:44:44,926
What?

1289
01:44:45,093 --> 01:44:47,137
Why are you fighting this?

1290
01:44:49,514 --> 01:44:51,683
What are you afraid of?

1291
01:45:01,693 --> 01:45:03,027
Grey.

1292
01:45:03,862 --> 01:45:04,863
What?

1293
01:45:05,530 --> 01:45:07,157
When?

1294
01:45:08,450 --> 01:45:10,452
Tell Stephan to
have the plane ready.

1295
01:45:10,493 --> 01:45:12,328
I'll be on the tarmac
in 30 minutes.

1296
01:45:12,579 --> 01:45:13,580
What happened?

1297
01:45:13,788 --> 01:45:17,167
I have to go back to Seattle.
Come, I'll take you home.

1298
01:45:19,294 --> 01:45:20,754
Oh, sweetheart.

1299
01:45:20,837 --> 01:45:22,255
I wish Christian
could have stayed.

1300
01:45:22,338 --> 01:45:24,132
Bob was really looking
forward to meeting him.

1301
01:45:24,299 --> 01:45:25,425
I know.

1302
01:45:25,592 --> 01:45:26,968
He had to get back
to Seattle, though.

1303
01:45:27,010 --> 01:45:29,012
There was some
situation at work.

1304
01:45:29,179 --> 01:45:32,682
I wish I could tell you that
things get easier, but they don't.

1305
01:45:32,766 --> 01:45:36,478
You just get to
know yourself better.

1306
01:45:37,145 --> 01:45:38,521
Thank you for everything, Momma.

1307
01:45:38,688 --> 01:45:39,981
Take care
of yourself, sweetheart.

1308
01:45:40,148 --> 01:45:41,524
I will.

1309
01:46:01,294 --> 01:46:04,380
Did you think I wouldn't
recognize you, Taylor?

1310
01:46:11,638 --> 01:46:13,181
How does he seem today, Taylor?

1311
01:46:13,807 --> 01:46:15,475
Preoccupied, I'm afraid.

1312
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:17,143
Really?

1313
01:46:17,727 --> 01:46:18,728
Yes, ma'am.

1314
01:46:24,984 --> 01:46:26,861
Well, that's not gonna work.

1315
01:46:28,905 --> 01:46:30,365
When?

1316
01:46:32,242 --> 01:46:34,911
Well, then, tell them that
they don't have 24 hours.

1317
01:46:36,037 --> 01:46:38,665
That is unacceptable.
I need to know.

1318
01:46:39,666 --> 01:46:41,709
Just keep me informed.

1319
01:46:57,267 --> 01:46:59,435
Is everything okay?

1320
01:47:01,104 --> 01:47:03,565
Nothing that concerns you.

1321
01:47:04,858 --> 01:47:06,401
I can leave.
Do you want me to go?

1322
01:47:06,568 --> 01:47:07,777
No.

1323
01:47:09,028 --> 01:47:11,281
No, that's the last thing
I want.

1324
01:47:17,370 --> 01:47:19,747
I want you to be

1325
01:47:19,789 --> 01:47:22,083
in the play room in 15 minutes.

1326
01:47:49,152 --> 01:47:50,403
What are your safewords?

1327
01:47:51,237 --> 01:47:53,031
"Red" and "Yellow."

1328
01:47:53,239 --> 01:47:54,782
Remember those.

1329
01:48:10,590 --> 01:48:11,591
Mmm.

1330
01:50:02,535 --> 01:50:04,662
It sounds so sad.

1331
01:50:05,955 --> 01:50:08,916
Everything you play is so sad.

1332
01:50:10,209 --> 01:50:11,711
You said you were six
when you learned.

1333
01:50:11,878 --> 01:50:15,381
Was it because you wanted
to please your new family?

1334
01:50:23,014 --> 01:50:25,808
I just wanna talk.

1335
01:50:29,437 --> 01:50:31,647
Why won't you let me in?

1336
01:50:33,816 --> 01:50:34,984
We should be talking.

1337
01:50:35,151 --> 01:50:36,778
Like normal people?

1338
01:50:36,944 --> 01:50:38,446
Yeah.

1339
01:50:41,407 --> 01:50:43,451
Is that so wrong?

1340
01:50:55,505 --> 01:50:57,048
Is this because of the contract,

1341
01:50:57,131 --> 01:50:58,633
because I still
haven't signed it?

1342
01:50:59,133 --> 01:51:01,010
Fuck the contract.

1343
01:51:01,177 --> 01:51:03,304
I think it's a little
redundant, don't you?

1344
01:51:04,847 --> 01:51:07,016
So, then, the rules
are redundant, too?

1345
01:51:07,183 --> 01:51:09,477
No. The rules stand.

1346
01:51:09,644 --> 01:51:11,187
And what if I break them?

1347
01:51:11,354 --> 01:51:12,855
Then there'll be consequences.

1348
01:51:13,022 --> 01:51:14,023
Punishment.

1349
01:51:14,148 --> 01:51:15,608
Yes.

1350
01:51:16,526 --> 01:51:18,111
Why do you want to punish me?

1351
01:51:18,277 --> 01:51:19,445
Ana...

1352
01:51:19,612 --> 01:51:21,864
Why do you wanna hurt me?

1353
01:51:23,991 --> 01:51:26,536
I would never do anything to
you that you couldn't handle.

1354
01:51:26,702 --> 01:51:30,623
But why do you even wanna do
anything to me at all, Christian?

1355
01:51:31,791 --> 01:51:34,418
If I told you, you would never
look at me the same way again.

1356
01:51:35,545 --> 01:51:37,213
So, there is a reason.

1357
01:51:38,548 --> 01:51:40,216
Tell me.

1358
01:51:41,634 --> 01:51:43,052
Do you wanna punish me
right now?

1359
01:51:43,219 --> 01:51:46,848
Yes. I wanna punish you
right now.

1360
01:51:48,182 --> 01:51:51,144
What if I told you that I feel the
same way about being punished

1361
01:51:51,227 --> 01:51:52,645
as you do about me touching you?

1362
01:51:52,728 --> 01:51:54,856
Would you still
want to punish me then?

1363
01:51:57,150 --> 01:51:58,568
No.

1364
01:51:58,734 --> 01:52:00,069
But that doesn't mean
I wouldn't need to.

1365
01:52:00,236 --> 01:52:01,237
Why?

1366
01:52:01,404 --> 01:52:03,156
Ana, stop.
Why do you need to?

1367
01:52:03,322 --> 01:52:04,740
Because it's the way I am!

1368
01:52:13,082 --> 01:52:15,835
Because I am fifty shades
of fucked up.

1369
01:52:38,399 --> 01:52:39,901
Show me, then.

1370
01:52:53,873 --> 01:52:56,250
I need you to show me

1371
01:52:57,293 --> 01:52:59,045
what you want to do to me.

1372
01:52:59,295 --> 01:53:00,630
Punish me.

1373
01:53:00,796 --> 01:53:05,301
Show me how bad it can be. I
want you to show me the worst.

1374
01:53:12,058 --> 01:53:14,727
It's the only way
I can understand.

1375
01:53:27,990 --> 01:53:30,159
Are you sure about this?

1376
01:53:30,326 --> 01:53:31,911
Yes.

1377
01:53:48,302 --> 01:53:49,971
Bend over.

1378
01:53:58,938 --> 01:54:01,357
I'm gonna hit you six times.

1379
01:54:01,524 --> 01:54:03,776
And you're gonna count with me.

1380
01:54:15,288 --> 01:54:17,540
Count, Anastasia.

1381
01:54:18,874 --> 01:54:20,418
One.

1382
01:54:25,631 --> 01:54:26,632
Two.

1383
01:54:35,391 --> 01:54:36,851
Three.

1384
01:54:47,278 --> 01:54:48,404
Four.

1385
01:54:55,911 --> 01:54:57,246
Five.

1386
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:11,761
Six.

1387
01:55:23,689 --> 01:55:27,151
No! Don't fucking touch me.

1388
01:55:31,530 --> 01:55:33,157
This is what you want?

1389
01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:35,534
You want to see me like this?

1390
01:55:36,827 --> 01:55:37,828
Ana...

1391
01:55:37,995 --> 01:55:39,789
Don't come near me.

1392
01:55:46,837 --> 01:55:49,382
Does this give you pleasure?

1393
01:55:51,842 --> 01:55:52,843
Don't.

1394
01:55:57,973 --> 01:56:00,393
Don't you dare come near me.

1395
01:57:03,914 --> 01:57:06,167
Please don't hate me.

1396
01:57:08,544 --> 01:57:11,380
You'll never
do that to me again.

1397
01:57:19,555 --> 01:57:21,932
I'm not what you want.

1398
01:57:22,391 --> 01:57:25,227
No, you're everything
that I want.

1399
01:57:33,277 --> 01:57:35,321
I've fallen in love with you.

1400
01:57:39,325 --> 01:57:40,326
No.

1401
01:57:40,743 --> 01:57:43,496
No, Ana, you can't love me.

1402
01:57:56,425 --> 01:57:58,677
I need you to leave.

1403
01:58:04,934 --> 01:58:06,769
Please.

1404
01:59:00,322 --> 01:59:02,324
I'd like my car back.

1405
01:59:03,909 --> 01:59:05,911
Taylor already sold it.

1406
01:59:07,871 --> 01:59:10,249
Then I'd like the money
he got for it, please.

1407
01:59:11,709 --> 01:59:13,586
I'll send you a check.

1408
01:59:14,003 --> 01:59:15,421
Okay.

1409
01:59:21,010 --> 01:59:23,178
Taylor will take you home.

1410
01:59:40,237 --> 01:59:41,322
Stop.

1411
01:59:42,323 --> 01:59:43,324
No!

1412
01:59:58,582 --> 01:59:59,583
Ana...

1413
01:59:59,625 --> 02:00:01,043
Christian.
