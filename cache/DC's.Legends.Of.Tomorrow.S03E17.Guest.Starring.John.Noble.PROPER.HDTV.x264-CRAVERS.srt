1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,294
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

2
00:00:01,296 --> 00:00:03,545
Sara can never find
out the truth about Ava.

3
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:04,796
- I'm a...
- You're a clone.

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:05,992
Future clone thing?

5
00:00:05,995 --> 00:00:08,929
The first totem bearers
imprisoned a great evil.

6
00:00:08,932 --> 00:00:11,032
And time is his cage.

7
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:14,203
If you cannot defeat me in this vessel,

8
00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:17,705
how will you stop me once
I've assumed my true form?

9
00:00:17,707 --> 00:00:20,141
Our family's destruction looms in 1992.

10
00:00:20,143 --> 00:00:21,809
You promised you'd save us.

11
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:26,486
Kuasa.

12
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:29,747
Gideon, set a course. I
have to save my family.

13
00:00:31,888 --> 00:00:34,789
Code 1-3-1! All hands on the bridge!

14
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,357
- What's going on?
- Yeah.

15
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:38,129
I gotta get back to "Lord of the Rings."

16
00:00:38,132 --> 00:00:39,727
You read?

17
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:41,662
Code 1-3-1.

18
00:00:41,664 --> 00:00:43,397
Come on, guys, I wrote
a whole a whole memo.

19
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:44,732
Yeah, nobody read it.

20
00:00:44,734 --> 00:00:46,467
- I did.
- Thank you, Ray.

21
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:49,325
- Pancakes for breakfast.
- No, 1-3-1 is not... is it?

22
00:00:49,328 --> 00:00:50,872
Yeah. Does that mean no pancakes?

23
00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:53,374
Anyway, I wrote a song to
help us remember all the codes.

24
00:00:53,376 --> 00:00:55,243
It goes like this. From the top!

25
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:57,629
♪ If the code is 1-1-1 ♪

26
00:00:57,632 --> 00:01:00,148
♪ Mallus escaped the time dungeon ♪

27
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,083
♪ If the code is 1-1-2... ♪

28
00:01:02,085 --> 00:01:03,417
All right, Nate, just tell us.

29
00:01:03,419 --> 00:01:05,253
Someone stole the jumpship.

30
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,689
Where's Amaya?

31
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:11,659
Uh, according to the jumpship logs,

32
00:01:11,661 --> 00:01:13,728
Zambesi, 1992.

33
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,597
Right before the warlords
destroyed her village.

34
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,599
And she dies.

35
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:20,668
The old her, that is.

36
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:24,772
Whoa, the temporal zone
is getting real choppy.

37
00:01:24,774 --> 00:01:26,374
Yeah, the timeline was
crumbling even before Amaya

38
00:01:26,376 --> 00:01:27,742
decided to change history.

39
00:01:27,744 --> 00:01:29,143
If that happens, the Darhks will be able

40
00:01:29,145 --> 00:01:30,678
to free their demon.

41
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,447
Oh, well, I'd better
get back to my movie.

42
00:01:33,449 --> 00:01:34,949
And we'd better stop Amaya

43
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:36,507
before she does something reckless.

44
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,325
- Gideon, plot a course for...
- Pardon me, Captain Lance.

45
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,056
But we are receiving an
urgent call from Mr. Hunter.

46
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:44,117
- You good?
- Gideon, put him on.

47
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,194
The Bureau needs backup.

48
00:01:47,197 --> 00:01:48,796
Grodd's going after Barry.

49
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:52,551
Well, that explains the time turbulence.

50
00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:53,935
The Flash is always in trouble.

51
00:01:53,937 --> 00:01:56,470
- It's kind of his thing.
- Not that particular Barry.

52
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,997
Barack Obama.

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,860
It will almost be an honor to kill you.

54
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:26,997

55
00:02:28,805 --> 00:02:30,371
All right, people, we're dealing with

56
00:02:30,373 --> 00:02:33,341
two anachronisms now,
Zambesi and young Obama.

57
00:02:33,343 --> 00:02:34,642
Wally, Nate, I want you guys

58
00:02:34,644 --> 00:02:36,077
to go talk some sense into Amaya.

59
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,466
You mean, convince
her to stand down while

60
00:02:37,468 --> 00:02:39,180
her village and family is torn apart?

61
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:42,650
What if I use my temporal
simulator to find some loophole

62
00:02:42,652 --> 00:02:45,386
that Amaya can use to help save Zambesi?

63
00:02:47,123 --> 00:02:48,522
All right, do it.

64
00:02:48,524 --> 00:02:51,058
The rest of us, we're on Obamacare.

65
00:02:55,999 --> 00:02:58,499
You will not escape.

66
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:01,602
- Grodd will complete his mission.
- Whoa.

67
00:03:01,604 --> 00:03:06,007
Time to make America Grodd again.

68
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:07,575
Clearly, you have some grievances.

69
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:11,178
But perhaps we can look
for a common ground.

70
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,980
Whoa!

71
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:15,950
Or not.

72
00:03:22,765 --> 00:03:26,200
I can feel his arrival.

73
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,664
Oh, goodie.

74
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:50,017
Yes, resist.

75
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:52,953
You will only prolong your suffering.

76
00:03:59,929 --> 00:04:02,430
Should have wasted
your hairy ass in 'Nam.

77
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:08,402
Run, Barry, run!

78
00:04:11,507 --> 00:04:15,076
A hairless ape who fights with fire.

79
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:16,977
How primitive.

80
00:04:30,827 --> 00:04:33,194
Nora. Nora, honey.

81
00:04:33,196 --> 00:04:36,130
- You okay?
- We were so close.

82
00:04:36,132 --> 00:04:38,432
My master was escaping his bonds.

83
00:04:38,434 --> 00:04:39,446
What happened?

84
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:41,202
Grodd's mission must have failed.

85
00:04:41,204 --> 00:04:42,670
Maybe that could be a good thing.

86
00:04:42,672 --> 00:04:43,826
It gives you and me
time to figure out what

87
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:45,806
the big guy's arrival really means.

88
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,910
It means the end of history.

89
00:04:49,912 --> 00:04:52,246
A chance for us to live as gods.

90
00:04:52,248 --> 00:04:54,982
As gods?

91
00:04:54,984 --> 00:04:56,884
Man, that sounds fantastic and all.

92
00:04:56,886 --> 00:04:58,285
But what I just saw, it seems like

93
00:04:58,287 --> 00:05:00,588
there won't be a "you" anymore.

94
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,857
It'll just be him.

95
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:06,994
That's what we always wanted.

96
00:05:06,996 --> 00:05:10,231
Isn't it?

97
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:13,484
Totally. 100%.

98
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:15,645
You know, I'm just gonna
check on our grumpy gorilla

99
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,238
and see how he screwed this thing up.

100
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:23,444
I'll see you later.

101
00:05:23,446 --> 00:05:26,781
No, you won't.

102
00:05:26,783 --> 00:05:29,517
Of course.

103
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,252
'Cause once I complete Grodd's mission,

104
00:05:31,254 --> 00:05:35,723
you will be gone.

105
00:05:35,725 --> 00:05:38,759
What I meant to say was,

106
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:40,494
I'll see Mallus later.

107
00:05:48,644 --> 00:05:50,359
Goodbye, Nora doll.

108
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:05,753
Grodd will destroy you. You're dead!

109
00:06:05,755 --> 00:06:08,155
Nice work. Let's get
him back to the ship.

110
00:06:08,157 --> 00:06:10,391
Yeah. Come on, teeny-tiny Grodd.

111
00:06:10,393 --> 00:06:12,193
I think we still have
some chew toys left over

112
00:06:12,195 --> 00:06:13,661
from the saber-toothed tiger.

113
00:06:13,663 --> 00:06:14,728
Nice to meet you.

114
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,130
I'm a PhD student

115
00:06:16,132 --> 00:06:18,632
doing history research, Andy Watkins.

116
00:06:18,634 --> 00:06:20,267
No one cares about the cover story.

117
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:22,136
Shut up, Darren Applebottom,

118
00:06:22,138 --> 00:06:23,737
talent scout for the New York Knicks.

119
00:06:25,775 --> 00:06:27,041
What are you doing here?

120
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:30,444
What are you doing here?

121
00:06:30,446 --> 00:06:32,317
Preventing the genocide
of my people tomorrow.

122
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,415
We know. We're here to stop you.

123
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:36,023
Peacefully.

124
00:06:36,026 --> 00:06:39,086
Look, Amaya, I know you're
upset about what happened

125
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:41,989
to Kuasa, and all I can say is I am...

126
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:44,593
I'm truly sorry.

127
00:06:44,596 --> 00:06:45,829
I don't blame you for

128
00:06:45,832 --> 00:06:48,800
my granddaughter's death, Nathaniel.

129
00:06:48,803 --> 00:06:51,932
I blame the warlords who
draw closer by the minute.

130
00:06:51,934 --> 00:06:56,136
And I intend to stop them,
so stay out of my way.

131
00:06:58,508 --> 00:07:00,641
I must say, it has been
such an honor, Barack.

132
00:07:00,643 --> 00:07:04,311
- Oh, I go by Barry.
- I really like Barack.

133
00:07:04,313 --> 00:07:07,047
Well, Barack is what it
says on my birth certificate.

134
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:08,849
Yeah, you might want to hold on to that.

135
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:14,688
So, what's the backup plan?

136
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,892
Well, according to Ray's
song, this is a code 2-2-2.

137
00:07:17,894 --> 00:07:19,293
What's that?

138
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,362
It means we're screwed
no matter what we do.

139
00:07:21,364 --> 00:07:23,898
All right. Crisis averted.

140
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,368
And a new one's just begun.

141
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,007
You're not getting Obama.

142
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,710
I'm not here for him.

143
00:07:30,713 --> 00:07:33,613
I'm here for my daughter.

144
00:07:33,616 --> 00:07:35,234
And I need your help.

145
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:41,756
I assure you, this is
completely unnecessary.

146
00:07:41,758 --> 00:07:44,430
I come, as they say, in peace.

147
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:46,995
And I, as they say,
think you're full of crap.

148
00:07:46,997 --> 00:07:48,229
I'm a changed man, Sara.

149
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:49,597
The only change I want to see

150
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,366
you go through is from alive to dead.

151
00:07:51,368 --> 00:07:53,468
Ray, how we doing with
Constantine's spell?

152
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,904
Just need one more splash of bat spleen.

153
00:07:55,906 --> 00:07:56,905
Sorry, bat.

154
00:07:56,907 --> 00:07:58,173
And that should do it.

155
00:07:59,776 --> 00:08:01,676
Mm.

156
00:08:01,678 --> 00:08:03,178
Maybe I missed an ingredient.

157
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,113
Your Ankh symbol,
it's... it's upside down.

158
00:08:05,115 --> 00:08:06,314
Uh...

159
00:08:06,316 --> 00:08:07,782
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

160
00:08:07,785 --> 00:08:09,284
- No, it's not!
- Ooh.

161
00:08:09,286 --> 00:08:11,415
I knew it'd be difficult
to get you guys to trust me.

162
00:08:11,418 --> 00:08:12,820
Hmm. Try impossible.

163
00:08:12,822 --> 00:08:15,490
Which is why I brought
this gesture of good faith.

164
00:08:15,492 --> 00:08:17,258
The Water Totem.

165
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,927
I borrowed it from my daughter after

166
00:08:18,929 --> 00:08:21,396
she ripped it from Kuasa's chest.

167
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:22,751
Sorry about that, by the way.

168
00:08:26,895 --> 00:08:29,170
Do you guys mind if I
give you a hand with this?

169
00:08:29,172 --> 00:08:31,272
You seem to be struggling a bit.

170
00:08:31,274 --> 00:08:33,106
Yeah? Okay, great.

171
00:08:37,481 --> 00:08:40,448
Cool. Uh, now, uh, try to choke me.

172
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,084
- Really?
- Yeah.

173
00:08:44,621 --> 00:08:47,086
You... you can't.

174
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:49,057
- Satisfied?
- Yeah.

175
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:50,959
That Water Totem's
gotta be worth something.

176
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:52,694
With all six, you guys might actually

177
00:08:52,696 --> 00:08:54,011
have a chance against Mallus.

178
00:08:54,014 --> 00:08:55,192
You mean the same demon you've been

179
00:08:55,194 --> 00:08:56,730
creating anachronisms to release?

180
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:57,966
That was before I realized

181
00:08:57,968 --> 00:08:59,567
what our partnership would cost me.

182
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:00,802
Nora...

183
00:09:00,804 --> 00:09:03,251
Dies the moment the demon escapes.

184
00:09:03,254 --> 00:09:06,074
Now, I know this might
rankle you a bit, Sara,

185
00:09:06,076 --> 00:09:08,142
but our interests are aligned.

186
00:09:08,144 --> 00:09:11,179
We can save Nora and stop
Mallus from being freed,

187
00:09:11,181 --> 00:09:13,815
together.

188
00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:15,336
- No.
- Excuse me?

189
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:17,118
Rory, kill him.

190
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,100
Wait, nono-no.

191
00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:19,394
Wait, wait, wait. Okay, look.

192
00:09:19,397 --> 00:09:21,688
I... I know Damien has done
terrible things in his past

193
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:23,235
which cannot be forgiven,

194
00:09:23,238 --> 00:09:25,526
but I know that he loves his daughter.

195
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:27,831
- We can't just kill him.
- He was already dead.

196
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,868
Killing him would be
repairing an anachronism.

197
00:09:29,871 --> 00:09:32,100
Yeah, so would incarcerating
him in the Bureau.

198
00:09:32,102 --> 00:09:33,701
I agree with Rip.

199
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:36,044
We need to think through
this situation rationally.

200
00:09:36,047 --> 00:09:37,313
Boss?

201
00:09:40,243 --> 00:09:42,477
Stand down.

202
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:44,312
I'm glad to see you came to your senses.

203
00:09:44,314 --> 00:09:46,681
Think this makes us
straight, you're wrong.

204
00:09:52,622 --> 00:09:54,222
What are we even doing here, man?

205
00:09:54,225 --> 00:09:56,959
We need to stop Amaya,
not party with the village.

206
00:10:00,297 --> 00:10:02,230
There she is.

207
00:10:02,232 --> 00:10:04,899
Okay, great, well, let's
get her out of here.

208
00:10:04,901 --> 00:10:07,435
Not our Amaya.

209
00:10:07,437 --> 00:10:09,037
That Amaya.

210
00:10:11,007 --> 00:10:14,208
What's wrong?

211
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,111
Nothing, it just means...

212
00:10:17,113 --> 00:10:19,947
my Amaya comes back to Zambesi

213
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:23,318
and we don't grow old together.

214
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,987
For thousands of years,

215
00:10:25,989 --> 00:10:30,391
the Anansi Totem has been in my family.

216
00:10:30,393 --> 00:10:31,693
And tonight,

217
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:36,397
it is my great joy...

218
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,069
to pass this totem
down to my own daughter.

219
00:10:42,305 --> 00:10:44,238
Make way

220
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,777
for the new protector of Zambesi, Esi.

221
00:11:01,491 --> 00:11:05,526
Kuasa, where is Esi, child?

222
00:11:05,528 --> 00:11:09,397
I'm sorry, Nana Baa, but

223
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:11,466
Mother isn't coming.

224
00:11:16,106 --> 00:11:19,807
My daughter has chosen

225
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:24,645
to reject her destiny and her duty.

226
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:26,748
I am sorry.

227
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,250
We have come here for nothing.

228
00:11:39,028 --> 00:11:41,529
Amaya. What just happened?

229
00:11:41,531 --> 00:11:43,531
My daughter rejected the totem.

230
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:45,329
You sound more excited
than I thought you'd be.

231
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:46,968
Esi never bonded with the totem.

232
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,071
This is why the warlords were
able to destroy my village.

233
00:11:51,351 --> 00:11:53,985
You think you can convince
Esi to be a totem bearer.

234
00:11:53,988 --> 00:11:56,110
She'll protect the village tomorrow.

235
00:11:56,112 --> 00:11:59,251
She'll protect Kuasa.
Everything will change.

236
00:11:59,254 --> 00:12:00,637
That's the problem.

237
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,683
I saw what happened with
Barry Allen when he went back

238
00:12:02,685 --> 00:12:04,095
and stopped his mother's murder,

239
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,354
a little thing called Flashpoint.

240
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:08,489
We can't change history. I'm sorry.

241
00:12:08,491 --> 00:12:11,426
Tell her, Nate.

242
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:13,129
Nate?

243
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,629
I can't believe I'm gonna say this,

244
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:16,197
t screw history for once.

245
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:20,368
Okay, so you go talk to your daughter,

246
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,903
and I go talk to you,

247
00:12:21,905 --> 00:12:23,704
the older you.

248
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:26,073
Hmm.

249
00:12:26,075 --> 00:12:28,242
You always had a way with her.

250
00:12:29,712 --> 00:12:31,078
Come on.

251
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,715
Wait, we doing what?

252
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:35,949
So, listen...

253
00:12:38,555 --> 00:12:40,121
Are you okay?

254
00:12:40,123 --> 00:12:41,923
The hardest thing I
ever had to do in my life

255
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:43,891
was let Darhk live.

256
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:46,794
And now he's back, and it is taking

257
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:51,914
every ounce of self-control
not to kill him.

258
00:12:53,102 --> 00:12:57,805
And I keep asking myself, "Why?"

259
00:12:57,807 --> 00:12:59,841
For the good of the mission.

260
00:12:59,843 --> 00:13:01,542
"For the good of the mission."

261
00:13:01,544 --> 00:13:02,770
Listen to yourself.

262
00:13:02,773 --> 00:13:04,379
You sound like some government...

263
00:13:04,382 --> 00:13:07,215
- Clone?
- I was gonna say "stiff."

264
00:13:07,217 --> 00:13:08,816
You know, Rip thought I could
talk some sense into you,

265
00:13:08,818 --> 00:13:11,085
- but maybe...
- Wait.

266
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:13,221
You're here because of Rip?

267
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:16,491
Why would you do anything for that man?

268
00:13:16,493 --> 00:13:18,931
Ava, he lied to you.

269
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:21,729
He implanted false
memories into your head.

270
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:24,365
He hired actors to
pretend to be your parents.

271
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:25,900
I mean, what more is it gonna take

272
00:13:25,902 --> 00:13:27,056
to get you to confront him?

273
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:28,368
I am prioritizing the mission

274
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:29,962
over my own personal baggage.

275
00:13:29,965 --> 00:13:31,665
You and your team
should try it sometime.

276
00:13:33,843 --> 00:13:37,044
No, that's not what you're doing.

277
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:38,637
You're covering,

278
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,821
because you're afraid of
what you might find out.

279
00:13:40,824 --> 00:13:42,524
What else is there to find out, Sara?

280
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,127
I'm one of thousands.
I was grown in a lab.

281
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:45,853
There has to be more to the story, Ava,

282
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,189
and you deserve to know.

283
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:50,291
Look, you need...

284
00:13:50,293 --> 00:13:52,894
You need to talk to Rip now.

285
00:13:58,001 --> 00:13:59,367
Ah.

286
00:13:59,369 --> 00:14:02,837
Could do with a wee nip myself.

287
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:04,839
Everything good, Director Sharpe?

288
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:06,165
Peachy.

289
00:14:06,168 --> 00:14:07,835
Are we good to

290
00:14:07,838 --> 00:14:10,939
transport Mr. Darhk back to the Bureau?

291
00:14:10,942 --> 00:14:14,315
No, Rip, we're not.

292
00:14:14,317 --> 00:14:15,528
Where are you going?

293
00:14:15,531 --> 00:14:17,384
To go talk to someone
who can think straight

294
00:14:17,387 --> 00:14:19,654
when the whole world has gone crazy.

295
00:14:19,656 --> 00:14:21,889
So what you're saying is

296
00:14:21,892 --> 00:14:24,509
you won't aid the man
that killed your sister,

297
00:14:24,512 --> 00:14:27,040
even if it will prevent
Mollusk from escaping...

298
00:14:27,043 --> 00:14:28,462
"Mallus."

299
00:14:28,464 --> 00:14:31,432
From escaping his
inter-dimensional prison

300
00:14:31,434 --> 00:14:33,572
and wreaking havoc across time?

301
00:14:33,575 --> 00:14:35,142
Yeah, when you put it that way,

302
00:14:35,145 --> 00:14:36,337
it does sound kind of petty.

303
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:38,839
Not at all. It sounds...

304
00:14:38,841 --> 00:14:40,032
It sounds human.

305
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:42,343
Okay. But then what?

306
00:14:42,345 --> 00:14:44,884
I'm just supposed to
hand Darhk over to Ava

307
00:14:44,887 --> 00:14:46,645
and let the Time Bureau deal with him?

308
00:14:46,648 --> 00:14:50,151
Your ex is clinging to
rules and regulations

309
00:14:50,153 --> 00:14:51,986
in the face of the startling revelation

310
00:14:51,988 --> 00:14:53,955
that she is...

311
00:14:53,957 --> 00:14:56,724
I'm sorry... a clone, was it?

312
00:14:56,726 --> 00:14:59,293
But here's the thing.

313
00:14:59,295 --> 00:15:02,530
I'm not convinced the
Bureau is best equipped

314
00:15:02,532 --> 00:15:04,966
to stop a demon.

315
00:15:04,968 --> 00:15:07,702
No, it sounds like that calls for

316
00:15:07,704 --> 00:15:11,572
a much more unorthodox approach.

317
00:15:14,611 --> 00:15:16,677
I really miss you.

318
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:24,986
Oh, hi guys.

319
00:15:24,988 --> 00:15:27,054
I do hope you're not feeling all

320
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:28,956
killy-killy, stabby-stabby.

321
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,326
I want you to listen to me carefully.

322
00:15:32,328 --> 00:15:35,029
I don't believe for a
second that you've changed.

323
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:37,798
You're still the same
cowardly son of a bitch

324
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,767
that put an arrow in my sister.

325
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:42,136
But I will work with
you to defeat Mallus

326
00:15:42,138 --> 00:15:43,771
under one condition.

327
00:15:43,773 --> 00:15:45,439
After this is over,

328
00:15:45,441 --> 00:15:48,809
I'm putting you back in
the ground where you belong.

329
00:15:48,811 --> 00:15:49,944
Deal.

330
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,394
Huh.

331
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,640
Is... so, do any of
these flashing screens

332
00:16:06,642 --> 00:16:07,674
actually do anything?

333
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:08,940
Focus, Damien.

334
00:16:08,943 --> 00:16:11,000
How do we capture your demon daughter?

335
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,620
Um, if we coordinate a strike

336
00:16:12,623 --> 00:16:14,314
between the Legends and the Time Bureau,

337
00:16:14,316 --> 00:16:16,416
we might be able to take her down.

338
00:16:16,418 --> 00:16:18,619
How did that work for
you in Victorian London?

339
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:22,723
Besides, my little angel's
only gotten more powerful since.

340
00:16:22,725 --> 00:16:25,058
What if we just ask Nora nicely?

341
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,861
I did have a bit of a
connection with her in Berlin.

342
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:29,696
Not that kind.

343
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:32,562
All right, maybe she'll
listen to her dear old dad.

344
00:16:32,565 --> 00:16:35,035
Not anymore. Nora only
listens to Mallus now.

345
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:37,271
He's always in her ear.

346
00:16:37,273 --> 00:16:40,240
That's it. What if I got inside Nora?

347
00:16:40,242 --> 00:16:42,809
Not like that.

348
00:16:42,811 --> 00:16:44,611
What if I shrunk down,

349
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:48,015
flew into her ear and
pretended to be Mallus?

350
00:16:48,017 --> 00:16:49,416
Okay, new guy on the team here.

351
00:16:49,418 --> 00:16:50,917
Is that a joke plan or a real plan?

352
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:53,226
- We are so screwed.
- No, this could work.

353
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:55,789
We just have to convince
her that it's actually him.

354
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:59,326
This is how you would serve your city.

355
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:02,262
You would risk its utter ruin.

356
00:17:02,264 --> 00:17:03,664
That's it.

357
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,966
I did what I judged to be right.

358
00:17:05,968 --> 00:17:09,403
What you judged to be right?

359
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:12,570
You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor,

360
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,070
in the hands of a witless halfling!

361
00:17:15,073 --> 00:17:19,008
Whoa, the vocal similarity
to Mallus is uncanny.

362
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:21,315
- Quiet!
- Gideon?

363
00:17:21,317 --> 00:17:22,949
Who is that actor?

364
00:17:22,951 --> 00:17:25,485
And how can we get him
without dealing with his agent?

365
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:28,112
Red leather, yellowl eather. Yeah?

366
00:17:28,123 --> 00:17:29,756
- Mis... mister Noble?
- What?

367
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,925
Uh, we have some, uh,
last-minute rewrites.

368
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:33,994
No worries! We'll fix 'em in post!

369
00:17:33,996 --> 00:17:38,565
Tell Peter Jackson
no more chickens, huh?

370
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:40,734
I ate four this morning, eh?

371
00:17:40,736 --> 00:17:42,336
- So what's up, mate?
- Yeah, so.

372
00:17:42,338 --> 00:17:43,937
Rewrites, uh, from Peter.

373
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:45,939
And he'd like me to,
uh, run lines with you.

374
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:47,541
You're kidding.

375
00:17:47,543 --> 00:17:50,744
Okay. Uh, let's see.

376
00:17:50,746 --> 00:17:53,013
"Nora, you must heed my command."

377
00:17:53,015 --> 00:17:54,381
That's good. That's good.

378
00:17:54,383 --> 00:17:56,016
- Who's Nora?
- Nora.

379
00:17:56,018 --> 00:17:58,051
Nora, she's a new character that, um,

380
00:17:58,053 --> 00:18:01,221
well... they wanted to beef up
the female presence in the film.

381
00:18:01,223 --> 00:18:02,522
You can't do that, mate.

382
00:18:02,524 --> 00:18:04,124
It's Tolkien, "Lord of the Rings."

383
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:06,293
I know... But it's a studio note.

384
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:08,468
Oh, studio note. Very
good note, yeah, all right.

385
00:18:08,471 --> 00:18:11,531
- Yeah, from the top?
- Hmm.

386
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:13,767
"Nora, you must heed my command."

387
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:15,469
Uh, "What is it, Master?"

388
00:18:15,471 --> 00:18:17,624
"Go to the Waverider, Nora."

389
00:18:17,627 --> 00:18:19,593
"I cannot go to the Waverider."

390
00:18:19,596 --> 00:18:22,743
"The totems are ripe for the picking."

391
00:18:22,745 --> 00:18:24,148
This is crap, isn't it? Aye?

392
00:18:24,151 --> 00:18:25,879
- Oh, well...
- I mean, who wrote this?

393
00:18:25,881 --> 00:18:27,414
- I mean, somebody...
- Don't... don't worry about it.

394
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:28,749
- Took a lot of time...
- Don't worry about it.

395
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:30,450
"The totems are ripe for the picking.

396
00:18:30,452 --> 00:18:32,419
Your father will lead you to them."

397
00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:33,653
"My father?"

398
00:18:37,425 --> 00:18:40,926
Esi.

399
00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:42,796
Who are you?

400
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:45,132
I am a distant cousin.

401
00:18:45,134 --> 00:18:47,267
I came for the ceremony.

402
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:49,069
Sorry to disappoint you.

403
00:18:51,874 --> 00:18:53,707
I love it here.

404
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:55,065
When I was a child,

405
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:58,712
I'd come here and lose
myself in the stars,

406
00:18:58,714 --> 00:19:02,249
think about where my life would lead.

407
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:06,052
For as long as I can remember,

408
00:19:06,054 --> 00:19:09,990
the Anansi Totem has been my destiny.

409
00:19:09,992 --> 00:19:11,425
But now,

410
00:19:11,427 --> 00:19:16,096
I'm not sure I want it.

411
00:19:16,098 --> 00:19:18,732
- You wouldn't understand.
- Try me.

412
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:25,806
My mother is the great Amaya Jiwe.

413
00:19:25,808 --> 00:19:29,609
She's protected our
village her entire life.

414
00:19:29,612 --> 00:19:32,745
She never doubted, never wavered.

415
00:19:32,748 --> 00:19:34,947
That's not true.

416
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,986
Every totem bearer starts
their journey with doubt.

417
00:19:39,988 --> 00:19:42,255
Even your mother.

418
00:19:42,257 --> 00:19:44,562
I will never live up to her legacy.

419
00:19:44,565 --> 00:19:46,226
You have her strength

420
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:49,830
and the strength of all
others who've come before her.

421
00:19:49,832 --> 00:19:52,276
But there is danger coming,

422
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:54,935
and your people need
you to stand up for them.

423
00:20:12,187 --> 00:20:13,954
All right, you fathwoom
into Amaya's hut,

424
00:20:13,956 --> 00:20:16,022
grab the totem, and we'll
give it to her daughter.

425
00:20:16,024 --> 00:20:18,625
Nate, I... now that you
have some space from her,

426
00:20:18,627 --> 00:20:20,360
I need you to come to your senses.

427
00:20:20,362 --> 00:20:22,148
Amaya can't see this, she's too close.

428
00:20:22,151 --> 00:20:24,064
But she's going to
cause more harm than good

429
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:25,198
if this releases Mallus.

430
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,766
- We don't know that.
- We do.

431
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:27,901
You do.

432
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:36,142
I can't not help her, Wally.

433
00:20:36,144 --> 00:20:38,311
I love you, man, but I will stop you

434
00:20:38,313 --> 00:20:42,015
if you take this too far.

435
00:20:51,193 --> 00:20:55,795
Like stealing candy
from a very old baby.

436
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,651
Ow! Oh, Amaya, wait.

437
00:21:23,654 --> 00:21:25,541
It's me.

438
00:21:25,544 --> 00:21:27,294
You know, I didn't think
this would do it for me,

439
00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:28,662
but it actually kind of does.

440
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:29,829
- Who are you?
- Oh!

441
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,765
- It's me, Nate.
- Who?

442
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:32,877
Nate.

443
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,126
I know it's been a while,

444
00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:35,901
but we used to travel
through time together.

445
00:21:35,904 --> 00:21:38,271
You know, do other things...

446
00:21:38,273 --> 00:21:39,807
If this is some kind of a joke...

447
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:40,906
It's not a joke.

448
00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:43,209
I have pictures of us

449
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:44,911
on my phone.

450
00:21:44,913 --> 00:21:47,280
Ow.

451
00:21:54,963 --> 00:21:56,796
This is me.

452
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,566
Of course.

453
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:01,127
You really don't remember, do you?

454
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:02,495
How is this possible?

455
00:22:02,497 --> 00:22:04,064
We were part of a bitchin' team

456
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:05,602
that travelled through time together...

457
00:22:05,604 --> 00:22:07,300
I mean, the 1942 you.

458
00:22:07,302 --> 00:22:11,104
Why are you here, time traveler?

459
00:22:11,106 --> 00:22:14,975
To keep my promise to you,

460
00:22:14,977 --> 00:22:17,410
by making sure your daughter Esi

461
00:22:17,412 --> 00:22:20,113
gets the Spirit Totem tonight.

462
00:22:20,115 --> 00:22:23,550
She didn't even show
up to her own ceremony.

463
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:27,520
Her head is always somewhere else.

464
00:22:27,522 --> 00:22:29,923
She doesn't know what she wants.

465
00:22:32,127 --> 00:22:33,593
Yeah, you had a hard time

466
00:22:33,595 --> 00:22:35,562
figuring that out too
when you were her age.

467
00:22:37,699 --> 00:22:42,335
But, look, if Esi believed
you were truly in her corner,

468
00:22:42,337 --> 00:22:44,638
she wouldn't doubt herself.

469
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,707
She would accept the
totem and be unstoppable,

470
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:49,588
just like you.

471
00:22:56,184 --> 00:22:58,585
Uh, hey there, Nora doll.

472
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:00,413
Why am I still here?

473
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:02,455
Why is the Master still in prison?

474
00:23:02,457 --> 00:23:03,690
You failed me!

475
00:23:03,693 --> 00:23:05,058
I know, it's terrible.

476
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,682
The Legends captured Grodd,

477
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,628
and this whole Obama
thing is just not working,

478
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:11,865
so perhaps Mallus can advise us

479
00:23:11,867 --> 00:23:13,967
as to what to do next.

480
00:23:17,873 --> 00:23:21,107
Mallus only speaks when he desires.

481
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:23,158
I can't just "summon" him.

482
00:23:23,161 --> 00:23:24,377
Well, maybe we'll just, uh...

483
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:26,913
Wait here until he

484
00:23:26,915 --> 00:23:28,548
gets the itch.

485
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:31,507
Nora.

486
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,421
You must heed my command.

487
00:23:34,423 --> 00:23:36,556
It's him. He's speaking to me.

488
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:38,458
Very loudly.

489
00:23:39,728 --> 00:23:42,202
Really? Mallus is speaking to you?

490
00:23:42,205 --> 00:23:44,464
Shh! I need to concentrate.

491
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:47,867
Go to the Waverider, Nora.

492
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:50,336
The Waverider, why?

493
00:23:50,338 --> 00:23:54,174
The totems are ripe for the picking.

494
00:23:54,176 --> 00:23:56,342
Your father will lead you to them.

495
00:23:56,344 --> 00:23:57,644
My father?

496
00:23:57,646 --> 00:24:00,413
What... what... Mallus has plans for me?

497
00:24:00,415 --> 00:24:01,614
I... I wonder what those are.

498
00:24:01,616 --> 00:24:03,562
The... the... the Legends' ship.

499
00:24:03,565 --> 00:24:05,351
The Master wants you to take me there.

500
00:24:05,353 --> 00:24:08,221
Oh, I would in a heartbeat,

501
00:24:08,223 --> 00:24:10,256
but we are hopelessly
outnumbered, honey.

502
00:24:10,258 --> 00:24:11,558
There's just no way...

503
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,992
He must take you there now, Nora.

504
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:14,094
Just do it!

505
00:24:14,096 --> 00:24:16,023
God, do it! Don't be a fool!

506
00:24:16,026 --> 00:24:17,897
No problemo. Let's go.

507
00:24:22,104 --> 00:24:26,039
Those totems should be
around here somewhere.

508
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,915
You.

509
00:24:40,922 --> 00:24:42,021
What is this?

510
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:43,089
I'm sorry, sweetheart,

511
00:24:43,091 --> 00:24:44,257
but it's for your own good.

512
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:45,458
No.

513
00:24:46,728 --> 00:24:49,996
No!

514
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:56,761
I get it.

515
00:24:56,764 --> 00:24:57,980
You think that I failed you

516
00:24:57,983 --> 00:24:59,478
because I joined with the Legends

517
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:00,747
and trapped you here.

518
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,783
Well, you're right.

519
00:25:02,785 --> 00:25:04,184
I did fail you.

520
00:25:04,186 --> 00:25:05,719
But that's not how.

521
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:08,288
I was a terrible father.

522
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:11,892
I was obsessed with world domination.

523
00:25:11,894 --> 00:25:14,428
Because of that...

524
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,963
I died,

525
00:25:15,965 --> 00:25:19,700
leaving you all alone as a child,

526
00:25:19,702 --> 00:25:24,504
trapped with my name
and my foolish dreams.

527
00:25:24,506 --> 00:25:27,574
Oh, I turned you into a
demon long before Mallus did.

528
00:25:28,677 --> 00:25:30,811
It's why I'm begging you,

529
00:25:30,813 --> 00:25:34,214
do not let him take you away from me.

530
00:25:34,216 --> 00:25:37,684
Your daughter is long gone.

531
00:25:37,686 --> 00:25:38,986
No!

532
00:25:38,988 --> 00:25:41,253
I know you can hear me. Fight him!

533
00:25:41,256 --> 00:25:43,823
Oh, there was no fight.

534
00:25:43,826 --> 00:25:48,028
Her soul...

535
00:25:48,031 --> 00:25:50,999
her flesh...

536
00:25:51,002 --> 00:25:54,401
were freely given.

537
00:25:54,403 --> 00:25:56,203
You sick son of a bitch.

538
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,198
One more alteration to the timeline

539
00:26:00,201 --> 00:26:02,475
and my cage crumbles.

540
00:26:11,561 --> 00:26:13,320
Can't believe that worked.

541
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:14,521
I can.

542
00:26:14,523 --> 00:26:16,556
Sara knows what she's doing.

543
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:18,592
I may have my flaws, but I do know

544
00:26:18,594 --> 00:26:22,162
how to pick the best people for the job.

545
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,563
So why did you pick me?

546
00:26:23,565 --> 00:26:25,265
What? Come on.

547
00:26:25,267 --> 00:26:28,201
Brilliant mind, calm
demeanor, incredible strength.

548
00:26:28,203 --> 00:26:32,105
And, unlike the Legends,
you actually follow rules.

549
00:26:32,107 --> 00:26:35,142
It almost sounds like
I was made for the job.

550
00:26:35,144 --> 00:26:38,011
What are you getting at?

551
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,047
I know I'm a clone, Rip.

552
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:41,753
I see.

553
00:26:41,756 --> 00:26:44,990
So why me? Hmm?

554
00:26:44,993 --> 00:26:47,921
Of all the clones in
2213, why did you pick me?

555
00:26:47,923 --> 00:26:49,623
You're special.

556
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:51,725
So why'd you erase my memory?

557
00:26:51,727 --> 00:26:54,194
- I thought it would be easier.
- Easier?

558
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,063
Easier for you or easier for me?

559
00:26:56,065 --> 00:26:57,651
Don't lose focus, Ava.

560
00:26:57,654 --> 00:26:59,699
You are too critical to this mission.

561
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:02,002
Well, the good news is if I die,

562
00:27:02,004 --> 00:27:04,638
you can just skip off to 2213,
and get yourself another clone.

563
00:27:06,475 --> 00:27:09,710
Oh, my God.

564
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:11,311
I wasn't even the first one, was I?

565
00:27:11,313 --> 00:27:13,213
We both know how hard it is

566
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,649
to find agents as talented as you.

567
00:27:15,651 --> 00:27:18,618
And to find one who is also
replaceable is invaluable...

568
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,191
How many?

569
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:22,955
How many?

570
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:25,525
You're the 12th.

571
00:27:25,527 --> 00:27:28,128
The 12th?

572
00:27:28,131 --> 00:27:29,831
So I wasn't even your first choice?

573
00:27:29,834 --> 00:27:31,133
Or your second or...

574
00:27:31,136 --> 00:27:33,099
You don't understand.

575
00:27:33,102 --> 00:27:36,236
- You are exceptional.
- Don't, Rip.

576
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,372
Just don't.

577
00:27:45,314 --> 00:27:47,080
Nora's gone.

578
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,416
It's just Mallus now.

579
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:50,851
You must be enjoying this,

580
00:27:50,853 --> 00:27:53,120
seeing your nemesis with a broken heart.

581
00:27:53,122 --> 00:27:56,490
I didn't know you had a heart to break.

582
00:27:56,492 --> 00:28:00,660
Where was it the night
you murdered my sister?

583
00:28:00,662 --> 00:28:02,737
Look, what I did was unforgivable.

584
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,731
But back then, I hadn't
loved anyone enough

585
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:07,701
to understand the pain that I caused.

586
00:28:07,703 --> 00:28:11,338
Not that it's any comfort, but
if I could take it all back,

587
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,240
I would.

588
00:28:13,242 --> 00:28:15,542
We all have regrets.

589
00:28:15,544 --> 00:28:18,745
But we can't undo the
things that we've done.

590
00:28:18,747 --> 00:28:21,448
True.

591
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,284
But even the worst of us
can be made whole again.

592
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:26,319
You, for example.

593
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:28,394
League to Legend to killer to captain.

594
00:28:28,397 --> 00:28:29,889
That's not a bad makeover, is it?

595
00:28:29,892 --> 00:28:32,097
- It's not good enough.
- Why?

596
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,693
Because you put on the Death Totem

597
00:28:33,695 --> 00:28:35,228
and almost killed your entire team?

598
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:37,347
- Yes.
- But you didn't, did you?

599
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,800
And you know why?

600
00:28:38,803 --> 00:28:40,634
The same reason I'm spilling my guts to

601
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:43,103
a woman who's imagined
my death 1,000 times over.

602
00:28:43,105 --> 00:28:44,671
More like 10,000.

603
00:28:44,673 --> 00:28:48,308
Love! Sara.

604
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,110
'Cause without it, people like us,

605
00:28:50,112 --> 00:28:53,613
we're left alone with the darkness.

606
00:28:53,615 --> 00:28:55,248
That's not good for anyone, is it?

607
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:17,103
I'm so proud of you, my child.

608
00:29:17,106 --> 00:29:19,072
Esi's embraced her destiny.

609
00:29:19,074 --> 00:29:21,642
Tomorrow when the marauders
come, she'll be ready.

610
00:29:21,644 --> 00:29:23,019
And if she's not, we'll be right there

611
00:29:23,021 --> 00:29:24,281
to fight alongside her.

612
00:29:24,284 --> 00:29:26,313
You don't have to stay, Nathaniel.

613
00:29:26,315 --> 00:29:28,148
I know that what I did was selfish.

614
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:31,885
You couldn't be selfish if you tried.

615
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:35,589
Now, you see that
boomin' granny over there?

616
00:29:35,591 --> 00:29:38,525
She doesn't remember me,

617
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,260
or the Legends.

618
00:29:40,262 --> 00:29:43,597
You know why that is?

619
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:46,633
I must have erased my memory.

620
00:29:46,635 --> 00:29:49,536
And why would you do that?

621
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,972
Because if I chose to come back here,

622
00:29:51,974 --> 00:29:55,142
after everything we've
been through, then

623
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:56,944
erasing you would be the only way

624
00:29:56,946 --> 00:29:59,813
that I could be the
protector my people deserve.

625
00:29:59,815 --> 00:30:03,550
Otherwise, I'd always be split in two.

626
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:07,654
And part of me would
be in love with you.

627
00:30:07,656 --> 00:30:09,809
I tried to reason with
them, but they won't listen.

628
00:30:09,812 --> 00:30:11,473
Amaya is dead set on saving her village.

629
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,526
And Nate? He's just...

630
00:30:12,528 --> 00:30:13,994
- Whipped.
- I was gonna say "in love."

631
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:14,999
But, yeah, same thing.

632
00:30:15,002 --> 00:30:16,054
Zari, please tell me that

633
00:30:16,057 --> 00:30:17,364
you found a loophole that allows

634
00:30:17,366 --> 00:30:18,632
Amaya to save her village.

635
00:30:18,634 --> 00:30:20,167
There is no loophole.

636
00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:22,028
I've tried billions of variations,

637
00:30:22,031 --> 00:30:24,098
but this event has too
many ripple effects.

638
00:30:24,101 --> 00:30:25,672
The village has to be destroyed.

639
00:30:25,674 --> 00:30:26,840
Or Mallus is freed.

640
00:30:26,842 --> 00:30:30,577
And we're all doomed.

641
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,312
What if we're not?

642
00:30:32,314 --> 00:30:34,014
Hmm?

643
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,616
We have the six totems,

644
00:30:36,618 --> 00:30:38,585
the only thing that Mallus is afraid of.

645
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,121
But you can't fight what you can't see.

646
00:30:41,123 --> 00:30:44,293
What if the only way to kill
Mallus is to let him out?

647
00:30:44,296 --> 00:30:47,060
Are you really suggesting
that we allow Mallus to escape

648
00:30:47,062 --> 00:30:48,962
because you have a
collection of magical stones?

649
00:30:48,964 --> 00:30:51,676
Look, we have two choices: we
fight Amaya or we fight Mallus.

650
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,034
And I know it sounds crazy
to let a time demon out,

651
00:30:54,036 --> 00:30:55,996
but it's a hell of a
lot easier to stomach

652
00:30:55,999 --> 00:30:57,366
than turning on a friend.

653
00:30:57,369 --> 00:30:59,574
Okay, yes, but didn't
the original totem bearers

654
00:30:59,577 --> 00:31:01,491
try and face Mallus and... and blow it?

655
00:31:01,494 --> 00:31:03,710
Constantine said the only
reason they couldn't kill Mallus

656
00:31:03,712 --> 00:31:06,281
was because the Death
Totem betrayed them.

657
00:31:06,284 --> 00:31:08,081
And that's not gonna happen this time.

658
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:09,416
How can you be so sure?

659
00:31:09,418 --> 00:31:10,784
I needn't remind you what happened

660
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,138
the last time you tried to wield it.

661
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,154
She won't have to wield it.

662
00:31:14,156 --> 00:31:16,723
I will.

663
00:31:16,725 --> 00:31:18,925
The Death Totem was
attracted to Captain Lance

664
00:31:18,927 --> 00:31:20,994
because of a unique
quality we both share.

665
00:31:20,996 --> 00:31:23,030
We were both brought back from the dead.

666
00:31:23,032 --> 00:31:25,065
Plus, I have a personal stake

667
00:31:25,067 --> 00:31:27,034
in wanting to send
Mallus straight to Hell.

668
00:31:27,036 --> 00:31:29,523
He took my little girl.

669
00:31:29,526 --> 00:31:31,104
True as that may be,

670
00:31:31,106 --> 00:31:32,706
there is no chance that Captain Lance

671
00:31:32,708 --> 00:31:34,949
would trust you with
such a dangerous weapon.

672
00:31:37,713 --> 00:31:39,379
Death Totem's all yours.

673
00:31:39,381 --> 00:31:40,981
Sara, you can't be serious.

674
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:42,593
Ava, we don't have a choice.

675
00:31:42,596 --> 00:31:45,018
Our only choice is to stop
Amaya and stop the anachronisms.

676
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,219
This is insanity.

677
00:31:46,221 --> 00:31:48,522
Insane is what we do best, Ava.

678
00:31:48,524 --> 00:31:50,157
I will not condone this behavior,

679
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,192
and the Bureau certainly
does not stand behind you.

680
00:31:52,194 --> 00:31:53,960
Rip, let's go. We have work to do.

681
00:31:53,962 --> 00:31:55,629
Remember when I told you
that we would need the Legends

682
00:31:55,631 --> 00:31:57,230
before this was through?

683
00:31:57,232 --> 00:32:00,667
Perhaps it is time that
we set aside the scalpel

684
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:04,738
and let them be the chainsaw.

685
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,241
I will consider that your resignation.

686
00:32:08,243 --> 00:32:10,410
Ava.

687
00:32:10,412 --> 00:32:12,012
Ava, wait.

688
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,319
This plan can work and you know it.

689
00:32:19,321 --> 00:32:21,288
You just need to trust your gut.

690
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,923
My gut?

691
00:32:22,925 --> 00:32:24,124
You mean the one that was

692
00:32:24,126 --> 00:32:26,093
manufactured to factory settings?

693
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:27,360
That's the same gut that

694
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,995
11 other Avas used and got killed?

695
00:32:28,997 --> 00:32:31,574
Ava, please. Just trust me.

696
00:32:31,577 --> 00:32:32,899
You don't understand.

697
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:34,901
This plan breaks every
rule in every book,

698
00:32:34,903 --> 00:32:37,771
and all I have right
now are the rules, okay?

699
00:32:37,773 --> 00:32:39,940
You have me.

700
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:50,016
What are you doing?

701
00:32:50,018 --> 00:32:54,287
I'm admitting something
that could save us both.

702
00:32:54,289 --> 00:32:57,858
I love you.

703
00:32:59,128 --> 00:33:02,629
There is no "me" to love.

704
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:16,094
She looks good out there,

705
00:33:16,096 --> 00:33:17,862
ready.

706
00:33:17,864 --> 00:33:21,132
Like mother, like daughter.

707
00:33:22,969 --> 00:33:24,135
The warlords are early.

708
00:33:24,137 --> 00:33:25,536
Hey! Oh, no.

709
00:33:25,538 --> 00:33:27,369
- Don't puma-pounce us.
- Really, Wally?

710
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,210
- You're gonna do this?
- It's not like that, Nate.

711
00:33:29,212 --> 00:33:32,001
- I know why you're here.
- No, no, you really don't.

712
00:33:32,004 --> 00:33:34,444
Short version: Nora's on the
ship, tripping on Mallus juice.

713
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:35,847
Damien Darhk gave us the Water Totem

714
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:37,081
after they saved Barack Obama.

715
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:38,716
And, uh, we are here to help you

716
00:33:38,718 --> 00:33:40,585
create the anachronisms
so we can release Mallus,

717
00:33:40,587 --> 00:33:42,478
and then we can kill him.

718
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:44,381
Oh, and I met John Noble.

719
00:33:45,986 --> 00:33:48,658
So you're working with Damien Darhk?

720
00:33:48,661 --> 00:33:50,128
Please, don't rub it in.

721
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,529
And you're letting him
wield the Death Totem.

722
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:53,798
In order to do justice
for someone I love.

723
00:33:53,801 --> 00:33:55,048
Sure you can understand that.

724
00:33:55,051 --> 00:33:56,967
Thankfully that is our only similarity.

725
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,336
- Hm.
- So.

726
00:33:58,338 --> 00:34:00,238
Who gets Earth? Who gets Water?

727
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,307
Well, as a man of steel,
which is an element,

728
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:05,409
I always felt a strong
connection to the earth.

729
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:07,578
Actually, steel is an
alloy of iron and carbon.

730
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,412
Also, I've watched every single episode

731
00:34:09,415 --> 00:34:10,681
of "Planet Earth" on Blu-ray,

732
00:34:10,683 --> 00:34:12,483
and I was only stoned all of the time.

733
00:34:12,485 --> 00:34:14,185
Can I just please have the damn totem?

734
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:15,553
- Thank you.
- All yours.

735
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:17,288
And Water? Anyone?

736
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:19,657
Actually, water is really powerful.

737
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:21,559
It... it's crucial to life on Earth.

738
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:23,461
And did you know that we
are made up of 60% water?

739
00:34:23,463 --> 00:34:24,562
- If...
- All right, I think we get it.

740
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:25,368
Take a totem.

741
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:26,851
Oh, I wasn't making a pitch for one.

742
00:34:26,854 --> 00:34:27,886
Just take the totem!

743
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:29,133
Okay, cool.

744
00:34:29,135 --> 00:34:30,535
All right, so is there, like,

745
00:34:30,537 --> 00:34:32,603
an instruction manual? A YouTube video?

746
00:34:32,605 --> 00:34:33,905
You better figure it out.

747
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:36,073
Warlords are coming, and that means

748
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:38,009
Mallus is about to make his debut.

749
00:34:41,048 --> 00:34:44,149
Dad?

750
00:34:44,152 --> 00:34:46,249
Nora.

751
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:49,187
You're here but... how?

752
00:34:49,189 --> 00:34:52,256
The totem means you're dead.

753
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:55,860
No, not yet.

754
00:34:55,862 --> 00:35:00,264
Mallus is trying to take me,
but I'm still fighting him.

755
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:01,332
For now.

756
00:35:01,334 --> 00:35:04,468
But Dad?

757
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,071
I made a mistake.

758
00:35:07,073 --> 00:35:08,751
I'm sorry.

759
00:35:08,754 --> 00:35:10,447
I don't want him to take me.

760
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,976
Please don't let him
take me. I'm scared.

761
00:35:12,979 --> 00:35:15,146
You ready?

762
00:35:21,588 --> 00:35:23,821
Yeah, let's do this
before it's too late.

763
00:35:32,668 --> 00:35:34,268
This place has been sacred to my people

764
00:35:34,271 --> 00:35:35,503
since the dawn of time.

765
00:35:35,506 --> 00:35:37,033
The totems will be strongest here.

766
00:35:37,036 --> 00:35:38,220
Well, they'd better be,

767
00:35:38,223 --> 00:35:39,736
'cause mine's not turning on.

768
00:35:42,275 --> 00:35:43,741
It's time.

769
00:35:43,743 --> 00:35:45,877
As soon as Esi defeats the warlords,

770
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:47,712
our fight against Mallus begins.

771
00:36:02,061 --> 00:36:03,728
Should we help your daughter?

772
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,596
Esi's got this.

773
00:36:05,598 --> 00:36:07,498
Nono-no! No-no-no!

774
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,834
Looks like it's time
to meet our monster.

775
00:36:09,836 --> 00:36:11,035
Or our maker.

776
00:36:11,037 --> 00:36:12,403
I'm not dying today.

777
00:36:14,941 --> 00:36:17,108
Here's Mallus.

778
00:36:21,281 --> 00:36:23,019
Why isn't she transforming?

779
00:36:23,022 --> 00:36:24,032
Rip, what gives?

780
00:36:24,035 --> 00:36:26,832
The historical record is showing
that Zambesi's still destroyed.

781
00:36:26,835 --> 00:36:28,035
That doesn't make any sense.

782
00:36:28,038 --> 00:36:29,620
The battle's over. The good guys won.

783
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:35,059
- Rip, what's going on?
- Oh, my God.

784
00:36:35,061 --> 00:36:36,727
The warlords don't destroy the village.

785
00:36:36,729 --> 00:36:39,063
The village was destroyed by

786
00:36:39,065 --> 00:36:41,165
an angry gorilla.

787
00:36:47,941 --> 00:36:49,449
I had to. She's my daughter.

788
00:36:49,452 --> 00:36:50,685
You released Grodd.

789
00:36:50,688 --> 00:36:53,589
I need history to run its course.

790
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,581
Your time must end.

791
00:37:04,584 --> 00:37:06,192
This way! Quick.

792
00:37:06,194 --> 00:37:07,993
You should go too, Maame.

793
00:37:07,995 --> 00:37:09,929
I can handle this beast.

794
00:37:09,931 --> 00:37:12,765
I believe in you, Obabaa.

795
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,986
Esi.

796
00:37:33,988 --> 00:37:35,287
No.

797
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:41,127
Amaya! Amaya!

798
00:37:41,129 --> 00:37:43,462
Hey, hey, are you okay?

799
00:37:43,464 --> 00:37:45,898
I'm okay.

800
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:50,836
Nate, my family...

801
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:52,238
I won't let them die.

802
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,906
I promise.

803
00:37:53,908 --> 00:37:56,653
Damien, Mallus is coming.
This won't save Nora.

804
00:37:56,656 --> 00:37:58,511
If there's a chance in
hell, I'm gonna take it.

805
00:37:58,513 --> 00:37:59,945
I'll handle this.

806
00:38:03,784 --> 00:38:07,319
"Always incapacitate
your speedster first."

807
00:38:07,321 --> 00:38:08,666
That's day one stuff.

808
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,517
Let him go.

809
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:20,065
I'm warning you, don't stand in my way.

810
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:22,234
I was powerful before
I had this trinket,

811
00:38:22,236 --> 00:38:23,936
but now I'm unstoppable.

812
00:38:23,938 --> 00:38:25,638
Yeah, we've heard that one before.

813
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:32,378
I don't want to kill you.

814
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,113
I want to kill them to save my daughter!

815
00:38:34,115 --> 00:38:36,048
Why can't you understand that?

816
00:39:00,174 --> 00:39:01,874
Can't move.

817
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:03,175
What is happening?

818
00:39:03,177 --> 00:39:04,944
Foolish human.

819
00:39:04,946 --> 00:39:07,980
You are now mine to control.

820
00:39:07,982 --> 00:39:09,782
You will not harm my village!

821
00:39:09,784 --> 00:39:12,151
Maame! Get away from him!

822
00:39:23,698 --> 00:39:25,130
It worked!

823
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:28,467
Amaya.

824
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:36,976
Nathaniel.

825
00:39:40,214 --> 00:39:42,989
I... I didn't take
you for a totem bearer.

826
00:39:42,992 --> 00:39:45,251
That makes two of us.

827
00:39:49,523 --> 00:39:51,357
Nora.

828
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,167
I'll find you. I promise.

829
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,337
Go.

830
00:40:06,454 --> 00:40:07,536
Go!

831
00:40:09,944 --> 00:40:13,612
Hey!

832
00:40:14,749 --> 00:40:16,982
Performance anxiety, Raymond?

833
00:40:16,984 --> 00:40:18,517
You're only proving my point that

834
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:21,520
this plan was never gonna work.

835
00:40:21,522 --> 00:40:24,623
Oh come on. Don't make me do this.

836
00:40:27,495 --> 00:40:28,894
It's too bad, really.

837
00:40:28,896 --> 00:40:31,964
I was just beginning to
like you after Berlin.

838
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:44,310
You literally stabbed me in the back.

839
00:40:44,312 --> 00:40:45,944
It only seemed fitting.

840
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:48,052
You're lucky I wasn't
aiming for your heart.

841
00:40:48,055 --> 00:40:50,282
I am not gonna let Nora be taken by him.

842
00:40:50,284 --> 00:40:51,750
Nora's gone, Damien.

843
00:41:03,364 --> 00:41:07,466
Finally, I am free.

844
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:26,652
No.

845
00:41:26,654 --> 00:41:29,355
- Nora.
- You can't help her, Ray.

846
00:41:29,357 --> 00:41:30,989
Oh, my God.

847
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:40,032
I am so much more than a god.

848
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:45,907
