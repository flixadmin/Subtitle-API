Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,035
Is this your new girlfriend?

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,713
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,856
You and I dating would be totally weird.

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:08,880
Totally weird.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,878
Wow, that's beautiful.

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,354
Step away from the creature, miss.

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,035
You murdered him!

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,671
Hank is running some secret project.

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,912
He's not just taking the fugitives,
he's testing on them.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,195
I don't need you anymore.

12
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,158
I don't need you anymore, either.

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,158
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry.

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,872
Maybe I shouldn't intrude.

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,156
Nate needs all of our support right now.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,800
What am I supposed to say to him?

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,136
"Sorry the woman I've been
exchanging love letters with in prison

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,080
killed your dad."

19
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:57,471
They ought to put that
on a condolence card.

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,472
Look, we are going inside

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,280
and we are going to strive, with grace,

22
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,272
to help our friend cope with his loss.

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,035
<i>Damn it.</i>

24
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,713
Here, let me help.

25
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,520
Hey, uh...

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,637
Thanks for sticking around
this past week.

27
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,671
What are pretend girlfriends for?

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,351
My mom is going to be so crushed
when I tell her we broke up.

29
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
Then don't.

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,513
I mean, she's going through a lot.

31
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,990
We can pretend break up anytime we want.

32
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,438
We should...
We should probably get out there.

33
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,109
You ready for this?

34
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,320
Oh, Nathaniel.

35
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,073
I need you to make a toast later.

36
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,073
Tell everyone what an amazing man
your father was.

37
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,437
Mom, I don't think that's a great idea.

38
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,874
What? Of course it is.

39
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,274
And, Zari, I am so glad that you're here
for Nathaniel to lean on right now.

40
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,879
Yeah, you know me. I'm... I'm his rock.

41
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,316
I can't... I can't face him.

42
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,079
Ray, wait.

43
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,880
I hope you're not stress-eating, squire.

44
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,960
I don't know what else to do.

45
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,480
I can't believe this is happening.

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,873
You feel the energy in this room.

47
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,034
It's like sitting on a keg of dynamite.

48
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,680
You see, wakes are notorious soft spots

49
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,717
where the supernatural
meets the living world.

50
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,240
You see Nate's aunt?

51
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,154
That particular prayer
is to ward off evil spirits.

52
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,360
They've covered the mirrors

53
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,159
so the bad lads can't get in.

54
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,233
- That's creepy.
- Yeah, well.

55
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,232
Creepy is my business.

56
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,838
And it looks like business is good.

57
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,956
Oh!

58
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,070
Nate! Nate, Nate, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

59
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,276
No, it's okay, Ray.

60
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,317
No. No, no, it's not.

61
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,030
I keep giving Nora second chances
and she goes and does this.

62
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,157
Look, you thought Nora could change...

63
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,312
I never thought my dad would be
torturing magical creatures,

64
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,754
so I guess...

65
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,320
I guess we were both wrong.

66
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,917
I can't believe
you're the one comforting me.

67
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,720
Come on, I love you, bro.

68
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,000
That's never going to change.

69
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,030
I love you, too.

70
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,395
Oh, no, don't... No, no, no, don't...

71
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,757
Don't... Don't do it, Ray.
You're gonna do it.

72
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,556
You're gonna do it.

73
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,869
Nora?

74
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,274
How... How are you doing this?

75
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,192
It's a reflection spell.

76
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,555
I can't hold it much longer.

77
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,656
Well, good. Because there's nothing
you could possibly say

78
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,696
that would make any difference.

79
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,757
This time, there will be
no more second chances.

80
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,797
Ray, I didn't kill Nate's dad.

81
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,120
Oh, thank God, you're innocent.

82
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,320
Tell me where you are.
I need to talk to you in person.

83
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,716
Now, who wants a nice, juicy steak?

84
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,237
Charlie, you know that I'm a vegetarian.

85
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,518
No, no, no, you used to be a vegetarian

86
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,990
when you were a normal, boring human.

87
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,072
- But now, you are...
- A monster?

88
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,080
Exactly.

89
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:49,081
I mean, how cool is that?

90
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,392
Wait, are you trying to get me
to shift into Wolfie?

91
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,520
Of course I am.

92
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:56,041
You've been moping about the ship
thinking about your lost love.

93
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,756
I think that he would really want you to
just embrace your wild side.

94
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,392
Konane liked me as Mona.

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Whoa!

96
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,920
The birds on your shirt?

97
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:10,595
These are the names of my favorite
Jane Austen characters.

98
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
It appears that

99
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,559
you are experiencing
the impact of a magical fugitive.

100
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,389
Oh!

101
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,117
This better be good, Mona.

102
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,160
A fugitive got to Jane Austen.
She never wrote <i>Sense and Sensibility.</i>

103
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,119
And <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> disappeared,
too.

104
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,696
Whatever it is, it's gonna have to wait.

105
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,996
Did someone say history is in trouble?

106
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,470
Legends assemble.

107
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,511
Okay, yeah, I really need
to get out of here, too.

108
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,670
Hey, what's up?

109
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,230
Nothing. There's a fugitive alert,
but it can wait.

110
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,155
No, you should go.

111
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,600
It's hard enough I have to play pretend,
you guys shouldn't.

112
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,235
Okay.

113
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,910
Bye, Nate.

114
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
Bye, Zari.

115
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,670
Gideon traced the new fugitive
to a wedding

116
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,753
Jane Austen attended in Bath,
England, 1802.

117
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,117
I already had Gideon chart a course.
Can I come on the mission?

118
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,555
Please?

119
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
Sure.

120
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,190
Yeah, and as much as I love
a good wedding sneak,

121
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,950
I'm gonna QB from... From my bedroom.

122
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,277
Is he acting weirder than normal?

123
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,113
Yeah.

124
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,635
Speaking of weird.

125
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,077
I think my sense of smell
has improved because of Wolfie

126
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,200
and you smell exactly like... Nate.

127
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,040
No, I don't.

128
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,239
It's definitely Nate.

129
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,436
Nate and something else.

130
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,913
Arousal?

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,596
No, I don't... I don't like Nate.
That would be wrong and...

132
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,680
Nate likes you.

133
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,517
He confessed it
when he swallowed the truth bug.

134
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,717
We are so not passing
the Bechdel test right now.

135
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,996
It's okay to talk about guys sometimes.

136
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,356
Come on, I bet it's been months
since you got laid.

137
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,671
Now, why don't you just go smash Nate?

138
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,991
Or better yet, you should go
smash somebody else,

139
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,456
because if you're
still thinking about Nate,

140
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,119
then you know you're really into him.

141
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,793
Why don't you talk to Nate?

142
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,280
Tell him how you feel.

143
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,476
Boo.

144
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,040
That is a terrible idea.

145
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,679
Okay, I'm going. Bye.

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,879
This is like a Jane Austen novel
come to life.

147
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,313
My bonnet!

148
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,800
Look out!

149
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:41,281
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

150
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,160
Forgive me, miss.

151
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
Are you hurt?

152
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,000
Only my pride.

153
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,317
Injured pride is a small thing...

154
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,634
if it allowed us to meet.

155
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,199
What's the holdup there?

156
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,350
Come, come, I say.

157
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,556
Duty calls.

158
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,192
Apologies, Lord Remington.

159
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,839
We'll be on our way shortly.

160
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,160
Here.

161
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,071
Not a word.

162
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,514
Was that a curtsy?

163
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,711
"Only my pride."

164
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Okay, let's go. Shut up!

165
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,515
A damsel.

166
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,151
If you don't jump that
buff coachman's bones, I will.

167
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,600
We're at this wedding
to catch a magical creature.

168
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,912
If that's the groom,

169
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,434
then I'm glad I'm not the bride.

170
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,674
A man's charms are equal to his fortunes

171
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,878
and Mr. Dockerty's fortunes
are prodigious.

172
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,714
Jane, don't be rude.

173
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,357
That's Jane Austen.

174
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,158
I cannot marry you, Mr. Dockerty.

175
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,318
My heart yearns for another.

176
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,718
Our family scullery maid.

177
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,998
Ellen, are you here?

178
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,750
I'm here!

179
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,874
I love you, too.

180
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,680
The scandal!

181
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
Wow.

182
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,671
I give not one fig, Miss Sinclair.

183
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,069
For my heart, and my lower extremities,
yearn for your mother.

184
00:09:53,121 --> 00:09:55,271
Get over here, gorgeous.

185
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,600
Come to me, my love.

186
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,392
Now, this is what I call a wedding.

187
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,875
The coast is clear.

188
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,750
I really don't want you to get
in trouble with your friends.

189
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
Oh, it's no trouble.

190
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:27,752
It looks like everyone else
is still on mission.

191
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,956
Okay.

192
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,235
So, who did kill Hank?

193
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,719
- The demon.
- Okay, good.

194
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,279
Obviously...
I mean, obviously, it's bad.

195
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,714
If it's a demon, that means
that John will be able to find proof

196
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,757
and you just need to lay low
until he comes back.

197
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,593
You really don't mind me staying here?

198
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,672
Yeah, no,
it'd be nice if you stayed here.

199
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,036
Oi, Rayge? Where are you?

200
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,796
Rayge?

201
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,435
- It's a long story. Go.
- What's a long...

202
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,680
What...

203
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,749
What are you hiding in there?

204
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,115
Hmm? What? Nothing.

205
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,240
Oh, buffing the old bishop, was we?

206
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,120
It's all right, mate.
No judgement here, all right?

207
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,270
- Come on.
- Yeah.

208
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,639
So the bride and
the scullery maid, that was...

209
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,757
- Insane.
- Romantic.

210
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,115
I was gonna say hot.

211
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,635
Regardless, that definitely
did not happen in actual history.

212
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,317
Ray, Charlie, what you got?

213
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,360
This wedding was the second of
a series of "lust outbreaks" in 1802.

214
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,353
Yeah, the sexual revolution
came a couple hundred years too early.

215
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,150
Why would it make
Jane Austen stop writing?

216
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,430
We need more info.

217
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,638
Jane Austen was known for
being a keen social observer.

218
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,117
So if anyone would have noticed
a new magical arrival in town,

219
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,429
it would be her.

220
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,989
Okay, let's go interview Jane.

221
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,639
<i>Oh, wait, hang on a tick.</i>

222
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,394
People with the real dirt,
always the servants.

223
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,199
Like a handsome coachman, perhaps.

224
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Hmm?

225
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,230
Fine, I'll go ask him some questions.

226
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,431
- But that's it.
- You go get it, girl.

227
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,715
Okay.

228
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,794
Sister dear,
this is Miss Lance and Miss Wu.

229
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,553
They're new in town.

230
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,154
Try not to scare them away.

231
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,993
I shall do my best, Cassandra.

232
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,158
We are so sorry to interrupt
your writing, Miss Austen.

233
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,993
This? Just a letter.

234
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,390
Shall we take a turn around the room
while we converse?

235
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,920
We'd be delighted to.

236
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,310
It's a Regency thing, go with it.

237
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,552
So, the bride, Miss Sinclair,

238
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,996
her behavior must have been
quite a shock.

239
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,396
Ever since Lord Remington
arrived a week ago,

240
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,712
the entire town has been acting
most imprudently.

241
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,431
But Miss Sinclair's situation
is truly horrendous.

242
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,356
I think you of all people would
celebrate the triumph of romance.

243
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,794
What's to celebrate?

244
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,792
Miss Sinclair will be cut off
from her fortune

245
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,576
and the two women
will have nothing to live on.

246
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,559
But it's because of you, I mean...

247
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:18,036
I have come to believe that love will
find a way to overcome any obstacle.

248
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,033
Then you're either lying
or you're a fool.

249
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,710
Tell me, has love worked out
so well for you?

250
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,110
- No.
- Then you are a fool.

251
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,709
For you shouldn't have to
learn a lesson twice.

252
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,439
Let's go find Lord Remington.

253
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
We should be going.

254
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,120
<i>Hello?</i>

255
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,033
This is stupid.

256
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,871
What a pleasure to see you again.

257
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,160
Hey, man.

258
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,636
What's up, Pretty?

259
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,554
This whole toast thing is
eating me up on the inside.

260
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,109
My... My dad was such a dick.

261
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,800
He lied about everything and now
he's turning me into a liar, too.

262
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,394
Listen,

263
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,712
your old man's gone, whatever you say
out there, that's for you.

264
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,230
You know what, Mick?

265
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,839
I think you're onto something.

266
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,080
<i>Nathaniel!</i>

267
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,829
Hey, where is Nate?

268
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,435
We need to find him
because Hank's spirit is still here.

269
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,874
Hey, cheer up.

270
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,360
What does Jane Austen know?

271
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,274
How to be witty and wise
and mix satire with romance.

272
00:15:10,321 --> 00:15:13,597
I bet you these girls know
where Lord Remington is.

273
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,478
They do look like fan girls.

274
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,240
Okay, you know the era,
you take the lead.

275
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,870
He's simply the handsomest man
I've ever laid eyes on.

276
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,554
I know what you mean.

277
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,951
Lord Remington is such a fine specimen.

278
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,238
I can't say I share your sentiment.

279
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,509
His coachman though,

280
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,037
what he lacks in means,
he makes up for in magnetism.

281
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,236
I concur.

282
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,835
His arrival has sent
many hearts aflutter.

283
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Coachman.

284
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,711
As in, the guy we pushed Zari
to hook up with.

285
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,235
Zari is gonna smash the fugitive.

286
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,756
Come on!

287
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
Sorry.

288
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,199
This is moving really fast.

289
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,590
- I agree.
- You do?

290
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,076
What's your name?

291
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,995
Uh...

292
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,276
My name is Zari. What's your name?

293
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,874
You know what? Don't answer that.

294
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,316
You don't kiss like any man
I've ever known.

295
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,269
What are you?

296
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,072
I am Kamadeva.

297
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,237
The Hindu god of love.

298
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,196
Awesome.

299
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,360
We're too late.

300
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,910
Zari?

301
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,029
- We think you might be dealing with...
- The fugitive?

302
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,120
Yeah, I know.

303
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,359
This is Kamadeva.

304
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,238
As in, the namesake of
<i>Kama-sutra,</i> Kamadeva?

305
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,549
That I did not know.

306
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,475
Look, I'm not going to sleep with
a magical fugitive.

307
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,033
You are incredible.

308
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,515
A woman has never before
resisted my charms.

309
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,034
All right, you're coming with us.

310
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,680
I would follow Miss Zari
to the world's end.

311
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,474
Well, your days of ruining Regency-era
marriages are over, Kamadeva.

312
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,759
I only sought to grant people the
courage to follow their heart's desire.

313
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,953
Oh, think he likes you.

314
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,480
Gideon, get us out of here.

315
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,870
I'm not so sure we can go yet.

316
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,800
Miss Wu is correct.

317
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,513
The historical records still indicate

318
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,398
that Jane Austen's career is
in jeopardy.

319
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,160
We caught the fugitive.
What's the problem?

320
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,556
Well, it's too late
to knock on Jane Austen's door tonight.

321
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,756
We'll talk to her tomorrow.

322
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,992
So, I'm to spend the night...

323
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
Alone.

324
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,910
What a waste.

325
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,514
All right, everybody out.

326
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,193
- Come on.
- Hi.

327
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,794
Surely, I could have a bed?

328
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,156
Well, I had Gideon fabricate
some jimjams.

329
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,596
Because it's a slumber party.

330
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,751
Oh, thanks.

331
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,274
Obviously, since you are my guest,
you will get the bed.

332
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,992
Well, it's big enough
for the both of us. We can just share.

333
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,714
Oh, okay.

334
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,840
You can turn around now.

335
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,114
It really covers everything.

336
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,356
The thing is, I pride myself
on being a gentleman,

337
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,911
and the gentlemanly thing to do
would be to sleep in the chair, so...

338
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,312
But you can't...
There's no way...

339
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,720
Oh...

340
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,279
That's not...

341
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
Okay.

342
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,216
Hey, mate.

343
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,833
How is the old toast going?

344
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,151
Is there one or two "N"s in "conniving"?

345
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,840
Right then, may I suggest
a slight change of plan?

346
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,274
No, Mick is right.

347
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,240
It's time for me to tell the truth
about my dad.

348
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,636
How was I supposed to know
Hank's ghost was here?

349
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,120
Wait, what?

350
00:19:47,121 --> 00:19:49,681
Yeah, that's about the gist of it,
Natey boy, you see.

351
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,479
Your old man's spirit is
working very hard

352
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,353
to stay attached to the mortal realm.

353
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,120
I can only surmise that he has something
he wants to say to you, so,

354
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,136
if you wouldn't mind leaving off
your roast for a bit,

355
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,992
join us for a brief séance

356
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,680
and I'll have him on his way in no time.

357
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,754
No.

358
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,274
There's nothing Hank can say now

359
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,398
to excuse him from embezzling money
and hurting creatures.

360
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,557
In fact, I'm glad he's still here.

361
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,711
'Cause it's his turn to listen to me.

362
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,753
You don't scare me, Hank.

363
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
Ray.

364
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,154
Do you want me in bed with you?

365
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,715
Yes, I did. I do.

366
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,995
I do.

367
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,880
Is this okay?

368
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,430
Yes.

369
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,079
Ava...

370
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Oh. Oh...

371
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,438
Damn it, this is definitely a dream.

372
00:22:20,161 --> 00:22:23,437
- The fugitive get to you, too?
- Yeah.

373
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,696
Well, personally,
I really enjoyed my night,

374
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,518
blowing David Bowie's mind.

375
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,401
Who'd you get a leg over, Z?
Wait, let me guess. Nate?

376
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,676
No, Kamadeva.

377
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,280
Both?

378
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,672
It was both! Blimey, Z,
I didn't know you had it in you.

379
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,989
What about you, Wolfie?

380
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,157
You dreamt about Konane.

381
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,516
Mona.

382
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,920
I'll get it.

383
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,680
Hey. Hey, hey. It's okay.

384
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,912
He had the sweetest eyes.

385
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,196
And when he would look at me,

386
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,476
the whole world would disappear.

387
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,153
And now, he's dead.

388
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,591
Mona, I know it's hard, but,

389
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,798
try to have some perspective.
You didn't know him for very long.

390
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,113
So, you think I'm a fool too?

391
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,590
No, I just don't think anyone
should give their heart away

392
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,319
without thinking about the consequences.

393
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,359
But romance is taking
a chance on someone

394
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,397
without knowing how it's gonna end up.

395
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,757
Romance is something used
to sell novels. It's not real.

396
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,752
Well, it'll never be real for you.

397
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,153
Not if you never try.

398
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,232
Not if you never take a risk.

399
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,976
You know, it's hard
to take advice from someone

400
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,878
whose boyfriend turned her
into a werewolf.

401
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,670
Hey, guys, let's just take a breath.

402
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,040
You're right.

403
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,238
I might be stupid for being a romantic,

404
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,871
but it's not Konane's fault.

405
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,480
Bloody hell.

406
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,874
Finally, you look wicked, mate!

407
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,675
Mona, wait.

408
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,520
Jane Austen.

409
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,830
It's time for you to pay.

410
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,953
Stay back, beast!

411
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,191
If I'm a beast, it's because of you!

412
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,476
Your books made me
an incurable romantic.

413
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,674
You're the reason
I risked everything for love.

414
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,832
And now Konane is dead.

415
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,598
And look at me.

416
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,874
You don't believe in romance!

417
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,918
Your writing is all lies!

418
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,592
Are you the girl from earlier?

419
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,360
Mona is weak.

420
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,991
Wolfie is strong.

421
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,198
Well, Wolfie,

422
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,470
I believe from the depths of my soul
that one should only marry for love.

423
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,280
You do?

424
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,791
So much so that I rejected the only man
who has ever asked for my hand.

425
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,070
He was a smug simpleton
who only read sermons!

426
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,033
How remarkable.

427
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,672
You shouldn't mess with people's dreams.

428
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,357
My powers don't create passion
out of thin air.

429
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,393
Whomever you dreamt about,
you truly desire.

430
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,016
That doesn't mean I have to act on it.
It's called impulse control.

431
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,353
You sound like a woman who has never
let herself fall in love.

432
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,511
Where I'm from, love is a liability.

433
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,719
And yet, a life without love
is no life at all.

434
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,320
Tell me, what does a god know
about the human heart?

435
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,513
My real name is Sunjay.

436
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,430
I was born thousands of years ago.

437
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,319
When the actual Kamadeva
was immolated by Shiva,

438
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,798
I gathered his ashes in this vial.

439
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,158
They bestowed powers
I could have scarcely imagined.

440
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,519
Why are you telling me this?

441
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,990
Because I like you.

442
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,276
And I think you secretly yearn
to be impulsive and free.

443
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,117
Unless you lack the courage.

444
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,078
Okay. Give me a hit.

445
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,834
- Might I suggest...
- No, if I'm gonna do this,

446
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,436
I want to experience love, lust,
the whole shebang.

447
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,718
That is, unless you lack the courage.

448
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,079
One, two, three.

449
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,470
Wow.

450
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,559
Most of you here knew Hank well.

451
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,918
Or thought you did.

452
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,152
I'm gonna talk about a different Hank.
A Hank I got to know this year.

453
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,360
What are you doing?

454
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,316
Hank was a workaholic
who never took a day off.

455
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,830
Well, Hank,
you can finally rest in peace.

456
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,480
Um...

457
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,950
Hank never knew his own father.

458
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,399
That's why he wanted to be there
for Nathaniel growing up.

459
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,195
But work often got in the way.

460
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,834
So, one year,

461
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,432
we planned to use Hank's leave
to stay for a week in Disney World.

462
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,597
Nathaniel was over the moon.

463
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,960
But the morning that
we were to fly to Orlando,

464
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,237
we ended up having to take Nathaniel
to the hospital instead.

465
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,440
When Hank saw the look of disappointment
in his son's eyes,

466
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,912
he went out and rented
a Mickey Mouse costume.

467
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,673
Put it on and went to the hospital.

468
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,757
He convinced everyone there that
Mickey Mouse had come to see them.

469
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,269
Hank Heywood was not a perfect man.

470
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,396
But when he was at his best,
that is who he was.

471
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,637
A man who could make you
believe in magic.

472
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,480
To Hank.

473
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,872
To Hank.

474
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,518
Why did you tell me that
by following their hearts

475
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,831
those women would only
fall into despair?

476
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:48,801
Because my decision
was the result of my pride.

477
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,873
When my father dies, my sister and I
will be reduced to penury.

478
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,119
- But your writing...
- Has been rejected by every publisher.

479
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,759
It's no wonder.

480
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,277
I satirize the manners of a society that
seems to have lost all sense of decorum.

481
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,432
Therefore,
I have decided to stop writing.

482
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,838
But you will publish.

483
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,719
You can't give up now,
because your books

484
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,239
are timeless.

485
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,915
- How can you be so sure?
- Because...

486
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,158
You're my favorite author.

487
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,591
May I offer you a bit of advice?

488
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,389
My books advocate a partnership
based on love and mutual respect,

489
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,959
not on losing control.

490
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,800
What shall we do next?

491
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,880
I have an idea.

492
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,634
Let's get married.

493
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,400
Do you hear that?

494
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,709
No, hear what?

495
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,432
There is definitely music playing.

496
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,318
Kamadeva loved music.

497
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,156
- Perhaps you should sing.
- I don't sing.

498
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,473
<i>Every day I find a way</i>

499
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,992
<i>To shove my past and anger down</i>

500
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,309
Go on, my love.

501
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,675
That was beautiful.

502
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,037
<i>My humor's dry
I never cry</i>

503
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,191
<i>If I start, I'd surely drown</i>

504
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,030
<i>When I'm on my own
I can't help wanting something more</i>

505
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:37,312
<i>Today, instead of closing off
I'm opening a door</i>

506
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,552
<i>So now I'm tossing sense aside
And I surrender</i>

507
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,350
<i>To the fantasy and pleasure
I surrender</i>

508
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:51,152
<i>To my happy ever after</i>

509
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,070
<i>I won't fight it, won't deny it</i>

510
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,518
<i>Do you have a ring? I'll try it
I surrender</i>

511
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,195
In the morning, we should go ask
the parson to marry us.

512
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,873
A Christian wedding?

513
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,872
For a Muslim woman and a Hindu man?

514
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,077
Let's not think with our heads,

515
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,117
but feel with our hearts.

516
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,517
Gideon, where's that music coming from?

517
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,354
I took the liberty
of broadcasting Miss Tomaz's comms.

518
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,909
Ha! It's rather infectious.

519
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,397
Ray, this music, I think it's magical.

520
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,075
You're right. I want to express
my feelings to you in verse.

521
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,719
Is that really necessary?

522
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,190
<i>I had a dirty dream of you</i>

523
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,237
<i>I'll bet mine was dirtier</i>

524
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,232
<i>Why didn't you go and make a move?</i>

525
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,073
<i>I would have if you'd been flirtier</i>

526
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,616
<i>Look, this is complicated</i>

527
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,836
<i>- If Nate knew, he'd be enraged
- I know</i>

528
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,311
<i>And I'm sorry
but my desire's been uncaged</i>

529
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,557
<i>Don't let this moment pass us by</i>

530
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,438
<i>It could be our only chance</i>

531
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,113
<i>You're right, I need you now</i>

532
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,556
<i>Sorry, Nate and Captain Lance</i>

533
00:33:01,601 --> 00:33:06,039
<i>I fixed the timeline as a cat
Saved a cowboy, kept his hat</i>

534
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,399
<i>I took Salem's breath away
Got stuck reliving the same day</i>

535
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,520
<i>Through it all, I kept my cool</i>

536
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,040
<i>Never thought I'd play the fool</i>

537
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,559
<i>Now I've surrendered to you</i>

538
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:27,793
<i>It's time for me to say, "I do"</i>

539
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,197
I do? What are you talking about?

540
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,595
We need to find Mona.

541
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,400
Wait a sec, is this
a Bollywood musical number?

542
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,949
You bet your ass it is.

543
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,197
<i>Now we're tossing sense aside</i>

544
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,953
<i>And we surrender</i>

545
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,714
<i>To the fantasy and pleasure
We surrender</i>

546
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:10,397
<i>To our happy ever afters</i>

547
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,793
<i>We won't fight it, won't deny it
Losing all control? We'll try it</i>

548
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,872
<i>We surrender</i>

549
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,318
<i>I want you badly as my bride
Please make my wish come true</i>

550
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,837
<i>These feelings can't be denied
So, yes, I say I...</i>

551
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,920
Stop!

552
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,514
You're making a mistake.

553
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,311
<i>Zari</i>

554
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,816
Whoa! Why did I just sing that?

555
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,480
Okay, I guess I'm just gonna
roll with the whole singing thing.

556
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,400
<i>Every day we find a way
To hold grief in, not let them see</i>

557
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,320
<i>We feel so wrong, we often long
Get swept away in fantasy</i>

558
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,913
<i>You've been so brave, wise and strong</i>

559
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,917
<i>By opening your door</i>

560
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,759
<i>Please, Zari, have courage now</i>

561
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:10,551
<i>To wait for something more</i>

562
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,960
Don't listen to her, my love.

563
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,509
No, Mona's right, Z.
You don't even know this guy.

564
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,496
He's been using the powers
of a love god for years,

565
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,720
guarantee you he's got a wife.

566
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,072
- Is that true?
- Not exactly.

567
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,160
I have a thousand wives.

568
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,633
But lucky number 1,001
is the most important!

569
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,720
Seriously?

570
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,275
So, you still want to marry me?

571
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,431
No, I definitely do not.

572
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,757
<i>Now I've got my senses back
But I'll surrender</i>

573
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,559
<i>Life's not done, I'll love again
I'll surrender</i>

574
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:52,238
<i>With my friends now by my side</i>

575
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,835
<i>I won't hide it, won't deny it</i>

576
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,914
<i>Real love comes my way, I'll try it</i>

577
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:04,354
<i>I'll surrender</i>

578
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,591
<i>Voi</i>-bloody-<i>là.</i>

579
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,032
Now, only the particular spirit
we're after

580
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,679
will be able to enter the vessel.

581
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,035
What vessel?

582
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,590
The vessel is you.

583
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,953
I'm gonna kill you, weasel.

584
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,109
Hank Heywood.

585
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,799
I summon you.

586
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,680
Hank?

587
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,136
Who else would it be?

588
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,196
Where's Nathaniel?

589
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,559
Nate gave you the big middle finger,
so I'm afraid you're stuck with me.

590
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,518
Still angry, is he?

591
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,910
Us Heywoods, we hold a good grudge.

592
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,595
Now, what's so important
that you had to stick around?

593
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,919
It pains me to admit it,
but I made a terrible mistake.

594
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,471
<i>A man approached me about a deal.</i>

595
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,512
<i>Unlimited funding.</i>

596
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,557
<i>And all I had to do was give him access</i>

597
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,031
<i>to all the magical creatures
within the Time Bureau,</i>

598
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,238
<i>but this man was
no ordinary beltway bandit.</i>

599
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,270
He was a demon.

600
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,870
<i>Only after he murdered me
did I realize the truth.</i>

601
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,919
What was the demon's name?

602
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,879
- Promise me you'll keep Nathaniel safe.
- Yes, yes, yes. I promise.

603
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,520
Now, come on, Hank,
you can't delay the inevitable forever.

604
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,194
What was the demon's name?

605
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,631
His name was Neron.

606
00:38:34,361 --> 00:38:36,875
<i>Hey, world! I'm Hank Heywood.</i>

607
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,152
<i>And I'm here to tell you
about an exciting opportunity.</i>

608
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,193
<i>When I learned about the existence
of magical creatures...</i>

609
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,432
<i>Yes, magical creatures exist.</i>

610
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,558
<i>I ran right home
and pulled out a drawing,</i>

611
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,879
<i>made by my son Nathaniel
when he was only nine years old.</i>

612
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,869
<i>My son envisioned a theme park</i>

613
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,714
<i>where everyone could gaze in wonder</i>

614
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,032
<i>at dragons and unicorns,
werewolves and Minotaurs.</i>

615
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,909
This is insane.

616
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,720
<i>Now, you may be thinking,
this is insane.</i>

617
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,033
<i>But what great man hasn't been thought
of as insane at one point in his life?</i>

618
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,756
<i>I believe this park
can bring our country together.</i>

619
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,069
<i>And with your help,</i>

620
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,074
<i>I'm gonna turn my son's dream
into a reality.</i>

621
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,038
<i>I call it Heyworld.</i>

622
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,560
Oh, Hank.

623
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,954
Why?

624
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,633
Oh, Hank.

625
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,398
I have so many questions.

626
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,955
You weren't torturing magical creatures,

627
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,600
you were training them
to be in a theme park.

628
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,399
That is nuts.

629
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,192
But I gotta respect you
for dreaming big.

630
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,073
It was your moon shot,
your way of risking it all

631
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,594
to make the world a better place.

632
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,397
I was so wrong about you.

633
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,556
At the end of the day,

634
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,712
you were just as wacky
and well-intentioned as any Legend.

635
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,554
And I wish I'd had the chance
to get to know that side of you.

636
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,315
I'm gonna miss you.

637
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,593
I love you, Hank.

638
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,078
I love you, Dad.

639
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,951
Look at you.

640
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,112
Take a look at yourself,
you miserable git.

641
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,712
That's right.

642
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,871
Soak it in.

643
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,555
Your big sacrifice, it was for nothing.

644
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,476
But instead of rolling up your sleeves
and taking it to that demon bastard,

645
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,270
you're getting rat-arse drunk in a shed.

646
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,514
I can't fight him.

647
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,876
He's too strong.

648
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,519
Well, this isn't about Neron.

649
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,112
You failed Desmond, you failed Astra.

650
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,715
And you'll fail Nate.
And do you know why?

651
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,712
Because deep down,

652
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,638
you want them all to go to hell.

653
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,079
You want the company.

654
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,594
You liar!

655
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,953
Hey, Johnny.

656
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,149
Miss me?

657
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,720
Des?

658
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,915
I'm surprised
you haven't figured it out yet.

659
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,949
Neron.
