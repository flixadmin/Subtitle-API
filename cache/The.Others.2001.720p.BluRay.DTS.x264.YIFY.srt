1
00:00:33,627 --> 00:00:37,953
Now, children,
are you sitting comfortably?

2
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:41,001
Then I'll begin.

3
00:00:41,045 --> 00:00:44,291
This story started many
thousands of years ago...

4
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:47,667
but it was all over
in just seven days.

5
00:00:47,712 --> 00:00:49,667
All that long, long time ago...

6
00:00:49,712 --> 00:00:51,833
none of the things
we can see now-

7
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:54,960
the sun, the moon,
the stars, the earth...

8
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:58,785
the animals and plants-
not a single one existed.

9
00:00:58,838 --> 00:01:00,793
only God existed...

10
00:01:00,838 --> 00:01:03,457
and so only He
could have created them.

11
00:01:03,504 --> 00:01:05,164
And He did.

12
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:17,843
Simpson. What a character he was.

13
00:03:17,892 --> 00:03:20,132
I wonder whatever became of him?

14
00:03:20,184 --> 00:03:22,554
Oh, I imagine he's dead
like all the rest.

15
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:25,220
Ah, those were the days.

16
00:03:34,602 --> 00:03:36,593
Mr Tuttle, your hair.

17
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:45,970
Yes?

18
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,970
Good morning, ma'am.
We've come about the-

19
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,551
Oh, yes, of course.

20
00:03:52,604 --> 00:03:53,848
Come in.

21
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,600
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

22
00:04:05,605 --> 00:04:06,931
You are...?

23
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:08,556
I'm Bertha Mills, ma'am.

24
00:04:08,605 --> 00:04:10,845
And this is Edmund Tuttle.

25
00:04:10,897 --> 00:04:12,555
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

26
00:04:12,605 --> 00:04:14,347
You must be the gardener.

27
00:04:14,397 --> 00:04:16,720
That's right. The gardener.

28
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:20,767
And this young lady
is called Lydia.

29
00:04:20,815 --> 00:04:23,267
Have you had
much experience in service?

30
00:04:23,314 --> 00:04:26,515
oh, don't let that angel face
fool you, ma'am.

31
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:28,639
She's older than she looks.

32
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,562
Can you iron?

33
00:04:32,816 --> 00:04:34,972
What's the matter?
Has the cat got your tongue?

34
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:39,267
She can't talk, ma'am.

35
00:04:39,316 --> 00:04:40,975
The poor little mite's a mute.

36
00:04:41,025 --> 00:04:42,517
Oh.

37
00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:44,107
Oh, but she's a good little worker.

38
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:45,347
I can promise you that.

39
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,936
All right.

40
00:04:47,984 --> 00:04:50,519
All right. The other girl
I had spoke too much, anyway.

41
00:04:50,567 --> 00:04:53,269
Follow me.
Mrs Mills, you and the girl...

42
00:04:53,317 --> 00:04:56,067
will sleep in the attic room
at the top of the stairs.

43
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,475
- And you, Mr...
- Tuttle, ma'am.

44
00:04:59,526 --> 00:05:04,066
You could sleep in the shed
around the back.

45
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,476
As you can see, the housework
has been rather neglected...

46
00:05:07,527 --> 00:05:09,933
since the servants disappeared
almost a week ago.

47
00:05:09,986 --> 00:05:12,107
You mean they just vanished?

48
00:05:12,153 --> 00:05:14,937
Into thin air.

49
00:05:14,986 --> 00:05:17,225
No notice, nothing. They didn't
even collect their wages.

50
00:05:17,277 --> 00:05:20,146
They... they just left us.

51
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,434
What a strange thing to do.

52
00:05:22,486 --> 00:05:24,477
You'll soon find out
there are times...

53
00:05:24,528 --> 00:05:28,025
when this house is not
exactly an ideal home.

54
00:05:28,071 --> 00:05:29,777
Hence my advertisement
in the newspaper...

55
00:05:29,821 --> 00:05:33,268
requesting honest,
hard-working people.

56
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,070
There's nobody more honest
or hard-working than us.

57
00:05:36,113 --> 00:05:37,440
Isn't that right, Mr Tuttle?

58
00:05:37,488 --> 00:05:39,644
Oh, aye, we're very honest.

59
00:05:39,696 --> 00:05:42,813
And, um, very hard-working.

60
00:05:45,697 --> 00:05:48,067
The kitchen.

61
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,986
I have breakfast at 8.00...

62
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:52,069
the children at 9.00.

63
00:05:52,115 --> 00:05:55,315
Lunch will be served at 1.00
and dinner at 7.30.

64
00:05:55,364 --> 00:05:57,688
And the master, ma'am?

65
00:06:00,282 --> 00:06:02,770
The master went off to war...

66
00:06:02,824 --> 00:06:04,695
a year and a half ago.

67
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,686
I've had no news
since the war ended.

68
00:06:08,741 --> 00:06:10,198
Which of you does the cooking?

69
00:06:10,241 --> 00:06:12,611
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

70
00:06:12,658 --> 00:06:14,732
Which of you does the cooking?

71
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,655
You'll notice what I'm doing.

72
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,232
In this house,
no door must be opened...

73
00:06:20,284 --> 00:06:22,405
without the previous one
being closed first.

74
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,117
It is vital that you remember this.

75
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:27,197
It's not as easy as it may seem.

76
00:06:27,243 --> 00:06:30,324
There are 15 different keys
for all of the 50 doors...

77
00:06:30,368 --> 00:06:33,780
depending on which area of
the house you're in at the time.

78
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,398
Mrs Mills, from tomorrow onwards...

79
00:06:36,452 --> 00:06:38,905
I will be leaving
a set of keys in your charge.

80
00:06:38,952 --> 00:06:40,410
Yes, ma'am.

81
00:06:40,452 --> 00:06:42,408
The music room.

82
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:44,775
That old piano was already here
when we moved in.

83
00:06:44,827 --> 00:06:48,952
Please do not let
the children thump away on it.

84
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:50,700
It sets off my migraine.

85
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:55,403
Silence is something that we
prize very highly in this house.

86
00:06:55,454 --> 00:06:58,120
That is why you will not find
a telephone, a radio...

87
00:06:58,162 --> 00:07:00,367
or anything else
that makes a racket.

88
00:07:00,412 --> 00:07:02,651
Oh, we don't have
electricity, either.

89
00:07:02,704 --> 00:07:05,027
During the war, the Germans
kept cutting it off...

90
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:07,650
so we learned to live
without it. Let's continue.

91
00:07:07,704 --> 00:07:10,324
Ma'am, there's no need
to show us the whole house.

92
00:07:10,372 --> 00:07:11,569
Yes!

93
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:14,703
Yes, there is.

94
00:07:14,746 --> 00:07:17,366
Most of the time,
you can hardly see your way.

95
00:07:17,414 --> 00:07:19,286
It's often difficult
to make out...

96
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:22,531
if there is a table, a chair,
a door, a sideboard...

97
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:26,622
or one of my children
playing hide and seek.

98
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:29,746
What do you mean, ma'am?

99
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:32,823
Perhaps I should introduce you
to the children.

100
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,738
Mr Tuttle,
you can see to the garden now.

101
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,034
You'll find tools in the shed.

102
00:07:42,082 --> 00:07:43,742
Yes, ma'am.

103
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,327
You two can start closing
the curtains.

104
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,033
All of them.

105
00:08:18,086 --> 00:08:19,911
Come.

106
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:34,041
I'll wake them.
You wait here.

107
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:36,327
Whatever you do,
don't open the curtains.

108
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,917
Wakey, wakey.

109
00:08:44,213 --> 00:08:46,287
Now, come on.

110
00:08:46,338 --> 00:08:49,206
Eyes closed, hands together.

111
00:08:49,255 --> 00:08:52,289
Let it be, at light of day...

112
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:54,543
Jesus, to whom now I pray.

113
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:56,960
Blessed be the Virgin pure...

114
00:08:57,007 --> 00:08:59,080
Whom I greet with faith too short.

115
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:01,287
Jesus, Mary, spotless rose...

116
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,587
Keep us till this day doth close.

117
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,127
They're still half asleep.

118
00:09:12,174 --> 00:09:15,754
What sweet little children.

119
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,129
Well... what do you say?

120
00:09:19,174 --> 00:09:23,165
How do you do?

121
00:09:23,216 --> 00:09:26,665
How do you do, children?

122
00:09:26,717 --> 00:09:28,459
My name is Mrs Mills...

123
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:31,673
but you can call me
Bertha if you like.

124
00:09:31,718 --> 00:09:33,543
What are your names?

125
00:09:33,593 --> 00:09:36,295
- Anne.
- Nicholas.

126
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:40,716
Anne and Nicholas.
What pretty names.

127
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,628
Are you going to be
our new nanny?

128
00:09:43,677 --> 00:09:45,632
Mm-hmm.

129
00:09:46,677 --> 00:09:50,126
Yes, my dears.
I'm your new nanny.

130
00:09:50,178 --> 00:09:51,968
It's time for their breakfast.

131
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:54,086
Lydia, go to the kitchen
and close every shutter.

132
00:10:01,054 --> 00:10:03,838
The doctors were never able
to find a cure.

133
00:10:03,887 --> 00:10:05,843
For what?

134
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:08,211
Their condition.

135
00:10:08,263 --> 00:10:12,755
The children have a very
serious allergy to light.

136
00:10:12,805 --> 00:10:15,128
They are photosensitive
and must never be exposed...

137
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,550
,,,to any light much
stronger than this.

138
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:19,836
Otherwise, in a matter of minutes...

139
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:21,714
they will break out
in sores and blisters...

140
00:10:21,764 --> 00:10:25,011
and begin to suffocate.

141
00:10:25,056 --> 00:10:26,596
It would eventually be fatal.

142
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,962
Good heavens.

143
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,721
I don't like this toast.

144
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:33,387
Oh? Why not?

145
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:35,588
It tastes funny.

146
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,595
I liked it better before.

147
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,966
That's because before,
somebody else made it.

148
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,220
When are they coming back?

149
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:47,847
They're not coming back, child.

150
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:50,842
Just like Daddy.

151
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:53,381
Daddy is coming back, though.

152
00:10:53,434 --> 00:10:57,475
Mrs Mills, our father's
fighting in a war in France.

153
00:10:57,517 --> 00:10:58,926
It's the world war.

154
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:00,847
I know, but he's in France.

155
00:11:00,892 --> 00:11:05,182
That's enough, chatterboxes.
Finish up your breakfasts.

156
00:11:05,226 --> 00:11:08,757
Are you going to leave us, too?

157
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:12,223
Of course not!

158
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:14,058
Why should I leave you?

159
00:11:14,102 --> 00:11:16,140
The others said they wouldn't...

160
00:11:16,185 --> 00:11:18,176
but they did,
and then it happened.

161
00:11:18,227 --> 00:11:20,183
Be quiet!

162
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:26,634
What do you mean, Anne?
What happened?

163
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,894
Mummy went... mad.

164
00:11:30,937 --> 00:11:33,721
- Nothing happened.
- Yes, it did.

165
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,725
- No, it didn't!
- Yes, it did!

166
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,927
Be quiet.

167
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,804
What's going on?
I want those plates empty...

168
00:11:42,854 --> 00:11:45,141
...in less than a minute.
Is that clear?

169
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:50,678
Mrs Mills, would you
come outside a moment?

170
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,767
I'd like a word with you.

171
00:11:54,523 --> 00:11:56,015
Yes, ma'am.

172
00:11:59,648 --> 00:12:03,855
The postman usually
comes every Wednesday.

173
00:12:03,898 --> 00:12:05,356
But I just checked
the letter-box...

174
00:12:05,398 --> 00:12:07,685
and this week he hasn't.

175
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:09,723
I'm afraid I don't follow, ma'am.

176
00:12:09,773 --> 00:12:11,681
This letter should
have been collected...

177
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:14,399
...and delivered to the
newspaper five days ago.

178
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:15,898
It's an advertisement
for servants.

179
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,185
Since it was never published...

180
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:19,935
...would you explain
what you're doing here?

181
00:12:19,983 --> 00:12:22,897
Oh, I understand.

182
00:12:22,941 --> 00:12:26,023
Ma'am, that's what
I was going to say to you...

183
00:12:26,066 --> 00:12:27,560
When you opened the door to us.

184
00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:30,097
The truth is that we just come by...

185
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,437
on the off chance.

186
00:12:32,484 --> 00:12:34,060
A big house like this...

187
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:36,680
is always in need of someone
who knows the ropes.

188
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,649
You've served in a house
like this one before?

189
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:42,312
This may come as a surprise
to you, ma'am, but...

190
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,140
We, in fact, used to work here.

191
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,557
Here?

192
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:53,067
Oh, now, 'twas a few years ago.

193
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:56,062
If you don't mind
my saying so, ma'am...

194
00:12:56,111 --> 00:12:59,892
they were the best years
of my life.

195
00:12:59,944 --> 00:13:03,275
That's why we come by,
because this house...

196
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,227
means a lot to us.

197
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,230
Perhaps I'd best show you
our references, ma'am.

198
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,063
No, no, no. Don't bother.
There's no need.

199
00:13:11,112 --> 00:13:13,269
So you say you
know the house well?

200
00:13:13,321 --> 00:13:15,775
Like the back of my hand.

201
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:18,939
That is assuming the walls
haven't sprouted legs...

202
00:13:18,989 --> 00:13:20,979
and moved in the meantime.

203
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,194
The only thing that
moves here is the light.

204
00:13:25,697 --> 00:13:28,814
But it changes everything.

205
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:36,108
It's rather difficult,
to say the least.

206
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:41,572
One might almost say...
unbearable.

207
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:47,313
The only way of enduring it
is by keeping a cool head.

208
00:13:47,366 --> 00:13:49,652
Oh, yes, ma'am.

209
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:52,366
I don't like fantasies.

210
00:13:52,408 --> 00:13:54,778
Strange ideas.
Do you know what I mean?

211
00:13:54,825 --> 00:13:57,907
I think so, ma'am.

212
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,896
My children sometimes
have strange ideas.

213
00:14:01,951 --> 00:14:04,735
But you mustn't pay
any attention to them.

214
00:14:04,784 --> 00:14:07,782
Children will be children.

215
00:14:07,826 --> 00:14:10,196
Yes, of course, ma'am.

216
00:14:10,242 --> 00:14:15,232
All right. You can stay.

217
00:14:16,785 --> 00:14:19,404
Thank you very much, ma'am.

218
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,026
It did happen.

219
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:44,911
"The Roman governor
tried to make them..."

220
00:14:44,954 --> 00:14:46,779
"change their minds afterwards..."

221
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:50,112
"To make them change their minds."
Full stop.

222
00:14:50,163 --> 00:14:52,154
- "Afterwards..."
- Mm-hmm.

223
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:53,781
"He ordered them to be beaten."

224
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,955
"But Justus and Pastor,
far from being afraid..."

225
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,532
"rejoiced and showed themselves
willing to die for Christ."

226
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,288
"when he saw this..."

227
00:15:02,331 --> 00:15:04,203
"the Roman governor
was filled with rage..."

228
00:15:04,248 --> 00:15:05,871
"and ordered their heads
to be cut off."

229
00:15:11,832 --> 00:15:14,913
What do you find so amusing?

230
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:16,415
Well...

231
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,413
Well, what?

232
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,946
Those children were really stupid.

233
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:23,037
Why?

234
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,872
Because they said
they only believed in Jesus...

235
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,583
and then they got killed for it.

236
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:29,865
And what would you have done,
deny Christ?

237
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:31,375
Well, yes.

238
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:33,325
Inside I would have
believed in him...

239
00:15:33,376 --> 00:15:36,208
but I wouldn't have told
the ROMANS that.

240
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:40,908
Is that what you think, too,
Nicholas?

241
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:47,080
I see.

242
00:15:47,127 --> 00:15:50,658
So you would have lied
to the point of denying Christ.

243
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:55,119
You'd have saved your heads
from the ROMANS, that's true.

244
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:56,875
But what would have
happened afterwards?

245
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,116
When?

246
00:15:58,169 --> 00:16:00,409
In the next life.

247
00:16:00,462 --> 00:16:02,583
The one waiting for us
after we die.

248
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,584
Where would you have gone?

249
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:05,825
Ahh.

250
00:16:05,878 --> 00:16:07,455
Where, Nicholas?

251
00:16:07,504 --> 00:16:09,044
To the children's limbo.

252
00:16:09,087 --> 00:16:11,042
What is the children's limbo, Anne?

253
00:16:11,087 --> 00:16:13,208
One of the four Hells.

254
00:16:13,254 --> 00:16:14,664
Which are?

255
00:16:17,463 --> 00:16:19,785
Me, me, me! Me!

256
00:16:19,838 --> 00:16:22,327
No. Let him answer. Which are?

257
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,047
There's the Hell
where the damned go...

258
00:16:25,088 --> 00:16:27,126
then there's Purgatory...

259
00:16:27,172 --> 00:16:28,499
Yes.

260
00:16:28,547 --> 00:16:30,206
And the bosom of Abraham
where the just go...

261
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:31,997
and limbo where children go.

262
00:16:32,047 --> 00:16:33,422
At the centre of the earth.

263
00:16:33,464 --> 00:16:36,498
Where it's very, very hot.

264
00:16:36,548 --> 00:16:38,088
That's where children
go who tell lies...

265
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,205
but they don't just go
there for a few days.

266
00:16:40,256 --> 00:16:41,666
Oh, no.

267
00:16:41,715 --> 00:16:45,412
No, they're damned. Forever.

268
00:16:45,465 --> 00:16:48,913
Think about it.

269
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:53,671
Try to imagine
the end of eternity.

270
00:16:53,716 --> 00:16:56,039
Close your eyes.

271
00:16:56,091 --> 00:16:59,623
Close your eyes
and try to imagine it.

272
00:16:59,675 --> 00:17:01,132
Forever.

273
00:17:02,842 --> 00:17:06,421
Pain... forever.

274
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:10,922
I'm getting dizzy. Heh.

275
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:13,005
Now do you understand...

276
00:17:13,051 --> 00:17:16,132
...why Justus and Pastor
told the truth?

277
00:17:19,385 --> 00:17:20,795
All right.

278
00:17:20,844 --> 00:17:24,423
Open your readers at lesson six.

279
00:17:24,469 --> 00:17:25,748
Can't we play?

280
00:17:25,803 --> 00:17:27,544
You most certainly cannot.

281
00:17:27,594 --> 00:17:29,003
First you're going
to read the lesson...

282
00:17:29,052 --> 00:17:31,209
Then you're going
to learn it by ear.

283
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:32,458
All of it?

284
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:33,755
Any more protests...

285
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,374
...and there'll be
no playing at all today.

286
00:17:36,428 --> 00:17:39,960
In fact, I think you can
study in separate rooms.

287
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:42,761
- No, no, no!
- Yes, yes, yes!

288
00:17:42,804 --> 00:17:44,594
But we get scared
if we're separated!

289
00:17:44,637 --> 00:17:47,671
Scared? As if you weren't
used to this house by now.

290
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:49,676
What if we see a ghost?

291
00:17:49,721 --> 00:17:52,755
Has your sister been telling you
one of her stories?

292
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,547
I haven't told him anything!

293
00:17:54,597 --> 00:17:56,053
If you see a ghost
you say "Hello"...

294
00:17:56,096 --> 00:17:57,554
and continue on studying.

295
00:17:57,597 --> 00:17:59,753
- Come to the music room.
- Why me?

296
00:17:59,806 --> 00:18:01,761
Because I say so!
Now come on.

297
00:18:01,806 --> 00:18:03,713
Take your book.

298
00:18:03,764 --> 00:18:05,387
Nicholas, I want to see
that lesson learned...

299
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:06,710
in less than an hour.

300
00:18:06,764 --> 00:18:09,467
- Mummy...
- What?

301
00:18:09,514 --> 00:18:11,754
Give me a kiss.

302
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:14,639
"Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss."

303
00:18:14,682 --> 00:18:16,719
Anne, wait for me outside.

304
00:18:16,765 --> 00:18:20,510
You know I can't.

305
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,180
Over there.

306
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:27,463
Mrs Mills, close all the curtains.

307
00:18:27,516 --> 00:18:30,965
My daughter is going
to cross the living room.

308
00:18:31,017 --> 00:18:33,055
Yes, ma'am.

309
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:41,177
All right, Anne.

310
00:18:44,143 --> 00:18:45,766
Darling...

311
00:18:47,351 --> 00:18:51,297
Mummy can't be with you
all the time, hmm?

312
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:56,133
You must learn to be on your own.

313
00:18:57,435 --> 00:18:59,675
Where's your rosary?

314
00:18:59,727 --> 00:19:02,679
Ahh!

315
00:19:02,728 --> 00:19:05,560
Whenever you feel afraid...

316
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,435
I want you to squeeze it
with all your might...

317
00:19:08,478 --> 00:19:12,058
...say an Our Father,
and your fear will go away.

318
00:19:12,104 --> 00:19:16,512
- It won't.
- Yes, it will. Honestly.

319
00:19:16,562 --> 00:19:18,305
Don't you see that
when you do that...

320
00:19:18,355 --> 00:19:20,262
the Lord is with you?

321
00:19:21,604 --> 00:19:23,891
There's no reason to be afraid.

322
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:05,312
"The house and the family."

323
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:08,523
"We all live in a
house with our family."

324
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:11,980
"The family is usually
made up of parents..."

325
00:20:12,026 --> 00:20:14,596
"children, and their grandparents."

326
00:20:14,651 --> 00:20:16,441
"we must be obedient..."

327
00:20:16,485 --> 00:20:19,815
"... and kind towards
other members of our family..."

328
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:22,608
"and we must
never argue or fight..."

329
00:20:22,651 --> 00:20:25,187
"with our brothers and sisters."

330
00:20:25,235 --> 00:20:27,191
Do you have any children?

331
00:20:27,236 --> 00:20:28,692
No.

332
00:20:28,735 --> 00:20:32,978
Mr Tuttle and the girl Lydia
are all I've got...

333
00:20:33,027 --> 00:20:34,437
...and I'm all they've got.

334
00:20:34,486 --> 00:20:36,524
Was she born like that?

335
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,023
Beg your pardon, ma'am?

336
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,317
The girl. Was she born a mute?

337
00:20:42,362 --> 00:20:46,142
No.

338
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:48,317
I think I've finished here, ma'am.

339
00:20:48,362 --> 00:20:50,437
If you'll excuse me,
I think I'll go...

340
00:20:50,488 --> 00:20:53,023
and see if Mr Tuttle needs a hand.

341
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,483
Nicholas!

342
00:21:29,408 --> 00:21:31,197
Nicholas, I'm coming!

343
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,444
Oh!

344
00:21:38,117 --> 00:21:40,321
- Nicholas?
- What's the matter?

345
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:41,564
Why were you crying?

346
00:21:41,617 --> 00:21:44,236
I wasn't crying.
I was reading.

347
00:21:44,284 --> 00:21:47,366
But I just heard you...
Anne!

348
00:21:55,452 --> 00:21:56,779
Anne!

349
00:21:58,577 --> 00:22:00,568
Anne?

350
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,526
I haven't learned it yet, Mummy.

351
00:22:02,577 --> 00:22:06,239
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

352
00:22:06,286 --> 00:22:09,367
- Why were you crying?
- I wasn't.

353
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:13,108
I just heard you a moment ago.

354
00:22:13,161 --> 00:22:15,152
There's no need
to feel ashamed, darling.

355
00:22:15,203 --> 00:22:16,483
I don't.

356
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:18,907
If I'd been crying,
I'd tell you.

357
00:22:18,954 --> 00:22:21,074
Oh, really.
So I imagined it, did I?

358
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,491
No. It was that boy.

359
00:22:23,538 --> 00:22:25,445
What boy?

360
00:22:25,496 --> 00:22:26,989
Victor.

361
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:29,361
Who's Victor?

362
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:32,779
The boy that was here
a moment ago.

363
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,702
I told him to let me study...

364
00:22:34,747 --> 00:22:36,904
but he wouldn't stop crying.

365
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:38,863
I think he's a spoiled brat.

366
00:22:38,914 --> 00:22:41,119
He said we'd have
to leave the house.

367
00:22:41,164 --> 00:22:44,779
Oh, did he, now?
And why was he crying?

368
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:46,490
Because he doesn't
like this house...

369
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,787
but he has to live here.
His father's a pianist-

370
00:22:49,832 --> 00:22:52,285
- His father's a pianist?
- Yes.

371
00:22:52,332 --> 00:22:55,662
I already told him he's not
allowed to touch the piano.

372
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:56,904
He isn't, is he, Mummy?

373
00:22:58,499 --> 00:23:00,822
So, you've spoken
to his father as well?

374
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,746
No, only with Victor.

375
00:23:02,791 --> 00:23:04,248
His father's with the others
in the hall.

376
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:06,661
I've just come from the hall.
There's no one there.

377
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,415
They must've gone upstairs.
They're viewing the house.

378
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:15,204
That'll do, Anne!
That's enough!

379
00:23:15,251 --> 00:23:16,530
Now why were you crying?

380
00:23:16,584 --> 00:23:17,958
It was Victor!

381
00:23:18,001 --> 00:23:20,536
- So where is he now?
- He went out through there!

382
00:23:20,584 --> 00:23:22,161
Would you mind
telling me how a boy...

383
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:25,125
...can get in and out
of this room if it's locked?

384
00:23:29,127 --> 00:23:32,457
I thought I made
myself quite clear.

385
00:23:32,502 --> 00:23:33,960
No door is to be opened...

386
00:23:34,003 --> 00:23:35,792
without the previous one
being closed first.

387
00:23:35,836 --> 00:23:38,040
Is that so hard to understand?

388
00:23:38,086 --> 00:23:40,161
This house is like a ship.

389
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:42,249
The light must be contained
as if it were water...

390
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:45,411
by opening and closing
the doors.

391
00:23:45,461 --> 00:23:47,370
My children's lives
are at stake!

392
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,617
But, ma'am-

393
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,338
Do not argue with me!
Be quiet!

394
00:23:51,379 --> 00:23:54,378
Which was the last of you
to enter that room?

395
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,700
Lydia?

396
00:23:57,462 --> 00:24:00,544
She hasn't got a key.
I already told you that.

397
00:24:00,588 --> 00:24:02,625
That leaves you, then.

398
00:24:02,671 --> 00:24:04,213
But I was in the hall
the whole time.

399
00:24:04,255 --> 00:24:05,748
And then I went out
into the garden.

400
00:24:05,797 --> 00:24:07,041
You saw me with your own eyes.

401
00:24:07,089 --> 00:24:10,420
I hope you are not suggesting
that it was me!

402
00:24:10,464 --> 00:24:12,787
Do you think that I would
overlook such a thing...

403
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:16,003
and endanger the life
of my own daughter?

404
00:24:22,424 --> 00:24:25,872
You're not supposed
to read at the table.

405
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:27,168
Oh, really?

406
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:30,048
Who's going to tell Mummy?
You?

407
00:24:32,216 --> 00:24:36,424
Or perhaps you?

408
00:24:40,008 --> 00:24:43,670
Did you really see a boy?

409
00:24:43,717 --> 00:24:45,424
Yes. He's called Victor.

410
00:24:47,717 --> 00:24:49,590
Is he a ghost?

411
00:24:49,634 --> 00:24:51,957
Don't be stupid.
Ghosts aren't like that.

412
00:24:52,009 --> 00:24:53,881
What are they like?

413
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:56,380
I've told you
a thousand times.

414
00:24:56,427 --> 00:24:59,544
They go about in white sheets
and carry chains.

415
00:24:59,594 --> 00:25:01,963
- How do you know?
- Because I've seen them.

416
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:04,582
They come out at night.

417
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,792
Fibber. Where?

418
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,207
- You're stupid.
- Not half as much as you.

419
00:25:16,262 --> 00:25:18,418
I don't believe
you saw that boy.

420
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,963
Believe what you like.

421
00:25:20,012 --> 00:25:22,796
You'll soon be begging us
to play with you.

422
00:25:35,305 --> 00:25:36,502
Nicholas!

423
00:25:36,555 --> 00:25:40,632
Huh? What?

424
00:25:40,681 --> 00:25:43,300
Look.

425
00:25:43,347 --> 00:25:45,255
Why have you opened
the curtains?

426
00:25:45,306 --> 00:25:47,344
- It wasn't me.
- Who was it, then?

427
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,594
It was Victor.

428
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,045
He's been doing it all night.

429
00:25:52,098 --> 00:25:54,255
You're lying.
I'm going to tell Mummy.

430
00:25:54,307 --> 00:25:56,925
- So I'm a liar, am I?
- Yes.

431
00:25:56,973 --> 00:25:59,676
Victor, come out from
behind that curtain...

432
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,592
...so my stupid brother
can see you.

433
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,175
Leave me alone.

434
00:26:13,225 --> 00:26:15,263
So you don't want
to see him now, eh?

435
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:16,885
You're a cowardy custard.

436
00:26:16,934 --> 00:26:20,928
Cowardy cowardy custard.

437
00:26:22,685 --> 00:26:25,303
I'll just have
to do it myself, then.

438
00:26:42,645 --> 00:26:44,220
That's enough, Victor.

439
00:26:47,103 --> 00:26:49,224
Nicholas. Nicholas.

440
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,597
Tell him to leave
the curtains alone.

441
00:26:50,645 --> 00:26:51,889
He won't listen to me.

442
00:26:51,937 --> 00:26:54,260
Stop it.
Get off my bed, both of you.

443
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,019
This is our bed.

444
00:26:56,063 --> 00:26:57,721
No, it's mine.

445
00:26:57,771 --> 00:27:00,805
Anne, please stop
putting on that voice.

446
00:27:00,855 --> 00:27:03,425
You be quiet, cowardy custard.

447
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,727
Listen, if you don't stop,
I'll call my mother...

448
00:27:06,772 --> 00:27:08,229
and she'll kick you out.

449
00:27:08,271 --> 00:27:10,558
You don't know my mother.

450
00:27:10,605 --> 00:27:12,228
And you don't know my parents.

451
00:27:12,272 --> 00:27:15,223
Anne, I'm going to tell
Mummy about you.

452
00:27:15,272 --> 00:27:18,638
Don't be stupid.
Can't you see it's not me?

453
00:27:18,689 --> 00:27:22,056
Victor, touch his cheek
so he knows you're real.

454
00:27:29,607 --> 00:27:30,804
Aah!

455
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,224
Mummy! Help!

456
00:27:35,274 --> 00:27:37,478
Help! Help, Mummy!

457
00:27:37,524 --> 00:27:40,309
What is it? What is it?

458
00:27:41,691 --> 00:27:43,101
What is it?

459
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:46,729
She was fighting with me,
and I told her to be quiet.

460
00:27:46,775 --> 00:27:49,181
I'm fed up.
Do you hear me?

461
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:50,940
I am fed up with you!

462
00:27:50,984 --> 00:27:52,607
I didn't do anything!

463
00:27:56,152 --> 00:27:58,984
"Therefore the Lord God
sent him forth..."

464
00:27:59,027 --> 00:28:01,183
"from the garden of Eden..."

465
00:28:01,235 --> 00:28:03,640
"to till the ground
from whence he was taken."

466
00:28:03,693 --> 00:28:05,187
"So he drove out the man..."

467
00:28:05,236 --> 00:28:07,985
"and placed to the east
of the Garden of Eden..."

468
00:28:08,027 --> 00:28:10,480
"cherubims and
a flaming sword..."

469
00:28:10,527 --> 00:28:12,565
"which turned every way
to keep the way..."

470
00:28:12,611 --> 00:28:14,187
"of the Tree of Life."

471
00:28:14,237 --> 00:28:16,903
There. I finished.

472
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,978
Very good.

473
00:28:21,778 --> 00:28:24,445
Now you can ask the Virgin
for forgiveness.

474
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:27,817
Wwhat?
That's not what we agreed!

475
00:28:27,862 --> 00:28:29,770
We didn't agree anything,
young lady.

476
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:32,819
Today you're being punished,
and you'll do as I say.

477
00:28:32,863 --> 00:28:34,900
You can't make me ask
the Virgin for forgiveness.

478
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:36,356
How dare you!

479
00:28:36,405 --> 00:28:39,605
Mummy, I won't ask forgiveness
for something I didn't do!

480
00:28:39,655 --> 00:28:41,776
You told your brother
someone else was in the room!

481
00:28:41,822 --> 00:28:43,232
- There was!
- You're lying!

482
00:28:43,281 --> 00:28:44,821
I am not!

483
00:28:46,198 --> 00:28:47,987
Anne...

484
00:28:48,031 --> 00:28:52,025
Do you remember the story
about Justus and Pastor?

485
00:28:52,073 --> 00:28:55,155
Children who don't tell
the truth end up in limbo.

486
00:28:55,198 --> 00:28:58,031
That's what you say,
but I read the other day...

487
00:28:58,073 --> 00:29:01,025
that limbo's only for children
who haven't been baptised.

488
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:04,487
And I have!

489
00:29:04,533 --> 00:29:06,938
"And Abraham took the wood..."

490
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:11,115
"of the burnt offering and
laid it upon Isaac his son."

491
00:29:11,158 --> 00:29:15,104
"And he took the fire
in his hand and a knife..."

492
00:29:15,158 --> 00:29:17,315
"and they went,
both of them together."

493
00:29:17,367 --> 00:29:20,365
"And Isaac spake
unto Abraham his father..."

494
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:22,530
"and said, 'My father...'"

495
00:29:22,576 --> 00:29:26,155
"and he said,
'Here I am, my son.'"

496
00:29:41,369 --> 00:29:43,075
Did you look in on Nicholas?

497
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:46,947
Yes, ma'am.
The little angel is fast asleep.

498
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:49,318
What about Anne?

499
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,076
Is she still on the stairs?

500
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,952
Oh, yes, ma'am.

501
00:29:53,995 --> 00:29:55,902
I'd prefer to have her
where I can see her...

502
00:29:55,953 --> 00:29:59,117
but I can't embroider
in such poor light.

503
00:30:02,121 --> 00:30:04,076
How long is this punishment
going to go on?

504
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:06,076
It's been three days now.

505
00:30:06,121 --> 00:30:07,698
It's up to her.

506
00:30:09,747 --> 00:30:11,405
She's got to learn
to swallow her pride...

507
00:30:11,455 --> 00:30:13,860
and ask for forgiveness.

508
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:16,782
Anyway, it's time
she stared to read the Bible.

509
00:30:16,831 --> 00:30:21,323
The priest will be very pleased
to hear that, ma'am.

510
00:30:21,373 --> 00:30:23,280
If he ever deigns
to pay us another visit.

511
00:30:23,331 --> 00:30:25,452
He knows perfectly well
that the children can't go out.

512
00:30:25,498 --> 00:30:26,873
He told me yesterday...

513
00:30:26,914 --> 00:30:29,783
...he'd be by as soon as possible.

514
00:30:29,832 --> 00:30:33,661
I'm beginning to feel
totally cut off from the world.

515
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:36,622
This fog doesn't exactly help.

516
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:38,242
It's never lasted
this long before.

517
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:40,447
Oh, that's true, ma'am.

518
00:30:40,499 --> 00:30:42,786
Even the seagulls
have gone quiet.

519
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:47,624
Anne!

520
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:50,334
Anne, I can't hear you.

521
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,991
Oh!

522
00:30:55,042 --> 00:30:57,329
Incidentally, Mrs Mills, I've
had to put up with the noise...

523
00:30:57,376 --> 00:30:59,367
of Lydia running around
above my head.

524
00:30:59,418 --> 00:31:01,040
She's been hurling
backwards and forwards...

525
00:31:01,084 --> 00:31:03,158
as if there were three of her.

526
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,917
Would you kindly tell her
it's not necessary...

527
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,745
to kick up quite such a rumpus
just to do a little cleaning?

528
00:31:07,794 --> 00:31:10,626
I couldn't bear to get
another migraine attack.

529
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:12,541
I'll tell her, ma'am.

530
00:31:12,586 --> 00:31:14,576
Thank you.

531
00:32:01,007 --> 00:32:03,376
Now she's really gone too far.

532
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:06,457
Lydia! Lydia!

533
00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:29,258
"... in the mount of
the Lord it shall be seen."

534
00:32:29,301 --> 00:32:30,960
"And the angel of the Lord..."

535
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,550
What's going on up there?

536
00:32:32,593 --> 00:32:35,129
Nothing, Mummy.
I'm just reading.

537
00:32:35,177 --> 00:32:39,585
- Did you hear it as well?
- Hear what?

538
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:44,791
"And the angel of the Lord..."

539
00:32:44,844 --> 00:32:46,918
"called unto Abraham
out of Heaven..."

540
00:32:46,969 --> 00:32:48,925
"the second time and said..."

541
00:32:48,969 --> 00:32:51,375
"'By myself, I have sworn,'
saith the Lord..."

542
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,714
Shh!

543
00:33:02,762 --> 00:33:04,137
What was that?

544
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:05,636
I don't know.

545
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,926
Anne, tell me
who's making that noise.

546
00:33:08,971 --> 00:33:10,879
I can't tell you, Mummy.

547
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:13,134
You tell me.

548
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,922
I told you there was
someone in the room...

549
00:33:14,972 --> 00:33:16,844
and you punished me.

550
00:33:16,889 --> 00:33:18,168
Now I don't know what to say.

551
00:33:18,222 --> 00:33:21,634
Anne, I want the truth.

552
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,051
Tell me if there is
someone upstairs.

553
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,629
There. In that junk room.

554
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,299
Mummy, you're letting the light in.

555
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:20,643
Shh!

556
00:35:20,692 --> 00:35:23,358
- She's a woman.
- She's what?

557
00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:48,146
Where did they go?

558
00:35:48,194 --> 00:35:50,350
They just came past here.
Didn't you see them?

559
00:35:50,402 --> 00:35:51,979
Which way did they go?

560
00:35:52,028 --> 00:35:55,393
Over there, over there,
and down there as well.

561
00:36:00,779 --> 00:36:05,069
They're everywhere.
They say this house is theirs.

562
00:36:05,113 --> 00:36:08,774
And they're going
to take the curtains down.

563
00:36:10,113 --> 00:36:12,151
Ma'am, stay calm, please.

564
00:36:12,196 --> 00:36:13,393
I will not stay calm!

565
00:36:13,446 --> 00:36:15,318
For five whole years
during the occupation...

566
00:36:15,363 --> 00:36:17,934
I managed to avoid a single Nazi
stepping foot in this house...

567
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:21,734
and now there is someone here,
opening and closing the doors.

568
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,736
Ma'am, this is a very old house.

569
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:26,779
The floorboards squeak
and the plumbing clanks-

570
00:36:26,823 --> 00:36:28,695
There were voices.
I'm telling you.

571
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:30,149
Mummy, look.

572
00:36:30,198 --> 00:36:31,739
A boy and two women,
talking together.

573
00:36:31,781 --> 00:36:33,487
Mummy, look!

574
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:37,273
I did it yesterday.

575
00:36:37,323 --> 00:36:39,030
This is the father,
this is the mother...

576
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:42,404
...this is Victor,
and this is the old woman.

577
00:36:42,449 --> 00:36:44,321
What do these numbers stand for?

578
00:36:44,365 --> 00:36:46,605
That's the number
of times I've seen them.

579
00:36:46,658 --> 00:36:49,111
I've seen the old woman
the most.

580
00:36:53,533 --> 00:36:55,405
Oh, God in Heaven.

581
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,694
Mrs Mills,
go and call Mr Tuttle.

582
00:36:56,742 --> 00:36:59,231
We have to search the
whole house immediately...

583
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:00,480
before it gets dark.

584
00:37:00,534 --> 00:37:02,441
- Yes, ma'am. There, now.
- Mummy!

585
00:37:02,492 --> 00:37:03,820
Yes, darling. It's all right.

586
00:37:03,868 --> 00:37:07,234
Nothing will happen to you
while Mummy's here.

587
00:37:07,285 --> 00:37:10,448
Look, Mummy.
She really scares me.

588
00:37:10,493 --> 00:37:11,737
It's as if she's
not looking at you...

589
00:37:11,785 --> 00:37:13,278
but she can see you.

590
00:37:13,327 --> 00:37:16,278
And she's always around
saying "Come with me..."

591
00:37:16,327 --> 00:37:18,034
No, Anne, don't lie to me.

592
00:37:18,077 --> 00:37:20,779
Honestly, Mummy.
And she asks me things.

593
00:37:20,827 --> 00:37:22,699
Victor told me she's a witch.

594
00:37:22,744 --> 00:37:24,154
What does she ask you?

595
00:37:24,203 --> 00:37:26,158
Things.

596
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,910
Her breath smells.

597
00:37:33,703 --> 00:37:35,943
We have to open
all the curtains.

598
00:37:35,995 --> 00:37:38,236
I don't want any dark corners
where someone could hide.

599
00:37:38,288 --> 00:37:39,614
Yes, ma'am.

600
00:37:39,662 --> 00:37:42,151
You both search the right side,
and I'll take the left.

601
00:37:42,205 --> 00:37:44,076
Then we'll search upstairs.

602
00:38:54,919 --> 00:38:56,792
Perhaps they're ghosts...

603
00:38:56,836 --> 00:38:59,040
who lived in this house before.

604
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,575
Don't be stupid.
I've already told you.

605
00:39:01,629 --> 00:39:03,204
Ghosts go about in white sheets...

606
00:39:03,253 --> 00:39:05,955
and carry chains and go "Oooh."

607
00:39:06,003 --> 00:39:07,283
Now, Anne.

608
00:39:07,337 --> 00:39:09,872
Why do you make up
such stories?

609
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,994
I don't. I read them in books.

610
00:39:12,046 --> 00:39:13,953
Well, you shouldn't
believe everything...

611
00:39:14,004 --> 00:39:15,201
...that you read in books.

612
00:39:15,254 --> 00:39:16,796
That's what our mother says.

613
00:39:16,838 --> 00:39:20,370
She says all this stuff
about ghosts is rubbish...

614
00:39:20,422 --> 00:39:22,377
and then she expects us...

615
00:39:22,422 --> 00:39:24,578
to believe everything
written in the Bible.

616
00:39:24,631 --> 00:39:26,123
And don't you believe it?

617
00:39:26,172 --> 00:39:27,369
I believe some things.

618
00:39:27,422 --> 00:39:29,746
But, for example,
I don't believe...

619
00:39:29,798 --> 00:39:32,416
that God made the world
in seven days.

620
00:39:32,464 --> 00:39:34,123
And I don't believe
that Noah...

621
00:39:34,173 --> 00:39:36,377
got all those animals
into one boat...

622
00:39:36,423 --> 00:39:38,994
or the Holy Spirit is a dove.

623
00:39:39,048 --> 00:39:41,335
No, I don't
believe that, either.

624
00:39:41,382 --> 00:39:43,123
Doves are anything but holy.

625
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:44,750
They poo on our windows.

626
00:39:50,466 --> 00:39:54,163
Have you mentioned
any of this to your mother?

627
00:39:58,258 --> 00:39:59,965
Oh.

628
00:40:59,389 --> 00:41:01,676
Ma'am.

629
00:41:01,722 --> 00:41:03,381
Yes?

630
00:41:03,431 --> 00:41:05,718
They've searched everywhere, ma'am.

631
00:41:05,765 --> 00:41:07,340
There's no one.

632
00:41:07,389 --> 00:41:09,132
I see.

633
00:41:11,182 --> 00:41:13,966
Mrs Mills.

634
00:41:14,015 --> 00:41:15,591
Yes, ma'am?

635
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,508
Do you have any idea
what this might be?

636
00:41:20,432 --> 00:41:22,387
'Tis a photograph album, ma'am.

637
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,926
No, but look. They're all asleep.

638
00:41:23,975 --> 00:41:26,049
Look.

639
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,767
They're not asleep, ma'am.
They're dead.

640
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:32,256
'Tis a book of the dead.

641
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:34,216
In the last century, I believe...

642
00:41:34,268 --> 00:41:36,175
...they used to take
photographs of the dead...

643
00:41:36,226 --> 00:41:38,133
in the hopes that their souls...

644
00:41:38,184 --> 00:41:40,969
would go on living
through the portraits.

645
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:46,055
There are even group portraits.

646
00:41:46,102 --> 00:41:49,135
And children!

647
00:41:49,185 --> 00:41:51,934
Oh, it's macabre!

648
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:56,346
How could these people
be so superstitious?

649
00:41:56,395 --> 00:41:58,681
Grief over the death
of a loved one...

650
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:02,935
can lead people to do
the strangest things.

651
00:42:06,187 --> 00:42:09,268
Get rid of it.
I don't want it in the house.

652
00:42:09,312 --> 00:42:11,184
Yes, ma'am.

653
00:42:22,188 --> 00:42:24,393
Mrs Mills, it's cold.

654
00:42:24,439 --> 00:42:26,642
Why don't you come
and sit by the fire?

655
00:42:37,981 --> 00:42:41,312
Thank you very much, ma'am.

656
00:42:41,357 --> 00:42:45,221
So... tell me about
when you worked here before.

657
00:42:45,274 --> 00:42:47,478
Did you have to look
after children then?

658
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:51,932
No, I was in charge of
organizing the housework.

659
00:42:51,982 --> 00:42:54,650
Hmm. Were there many servants?

660
00:42:54,692 --> 00:42:58,602
Oh, about fifteen.

661
00:42:58,650 --> 00:42:59,893
Though in the end...

662
00:42:59,941 --> 00:43:02,181
...there were just
the three of us left.

663
00:43:02,233 --> 00:43:03,561
Why?

664
00:43:03,609 --> 00:43:05,848
My employers moved to London.

665
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,846
They came here
less and less...

666
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,105
...it being
so out of the way like.

667
00:43:12,151 --> 00:43:16,525
So gradually the house
just became empty.

668
00:43:16,568 --> 00:43:21,356
Everybody ends up leaving
this damned island.

669
00:43:21,402 --> 00:43:24,685
My family left
in the summer of 1940...

670
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:28,148
just before the invasion.

671
00:43:28,194 --> 00:43:30,481
That was the last
I've heard of them.

672
00:43:32,403 --> 00:43:34,026
Oh.

673
00:43:35,111 --> 00:43:37,779
I don't blame them.

674
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:41,352
Actually, we left, too.

675
00:43:41,404 --> 00:43:43,145
Although, you know...

676
00:43:43,195 --> 00:43:45,270
sometimes when
you leave a place...

677
00:43:45,321 --> 00:43:49,860
it's like it's there
with you all the time.

678
00:43:49,904 --> 00:43:53,602
I always felt like I
never left this house.

679
00:43:53,655 --> 00:43:55,895
Why did you leave?

680
00:43:55,946 --> 00:43:58,233
Oh, 'twas on account
of the tuberculosis.

681
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,527
The whole area was evacuated.

682
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:03,977
Oh.

683
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:06,317
Was that when Lydia went dumb?

684
00:44:06,364 --> 00:44:09,279
Yes, I think so...

685
00:44:09,323 --> 00:44:13,186
though my memory's a bit
rusty these days, ma'am.

686
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,899
What happened to her?

687
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,238
It was suddenly one day.

688
00:44:23,282 --> 00:44:27,276
She just... stopped talking.

689
00:44:27,324 --> 00:44:30,276
There must've been a reason.

690
00:44:30,325 --> 00:44:32,814
People don't just stop talking.

691
00:44:32,867 --> 00:44:34,276
These things are
always the result...

692
00:44:34,325 --> 00:44:37,525
of some sort of trauma.

693
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:39,650
Something must've happened to her.

694
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:45,616
Did your employers treat you well?

695
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,615
Oh, they were always very kind to us.

696
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:50,693
They treated us just like family.

697
00:44:52,994 --> 00:44:56,359
You know, ma'am,
I think I will go to bed.

698
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:59,113
I'll never be able
to get up in the morning.

699
00:44:59,161 --> 00:45:00,784
Off you go.

700
00:45:00,828 --> 00:45:02,653
I'm going to stay here
a while longer.

701
00:45:02,703 --> 00:45:04,325
Yes, ma'am.

702
00:45:38,456 --> 00:45:42,154
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

703
00:45:48,249 --> 00:45:50,820
Can you forgive me?

704
00:45:56,457 --> 00:45:58,034
Anne.

705
00:46:17,001 --> 00:46:18,198
Mummy.

706
00:46:18,252 --> 00:46:19,449
What?

707
00:46:19,501 --> 00:46:21,907
When's Daddy coming home?

708
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,373
When the war's over.

709
00:46:25,419 --> 00:46:27,539
Why did he go to war?

710
00:46:27,585 --> 00:46:32,493
I mean, nobody's done
anything bad to us.

711
00:46:32,544 --> 00:46:34,452
Daddy went...

712
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:41,158
Daddy went because he's very brave...

713
00:46:41,212 --> 00:46:43,250
and because he wasn't prepared...

714
00:46:43,295 --> 00:46:46,827
to let the Germans tell him
what he had to do.

715
00:46:46,879 --> 00:46:48,538
Why?

716
00:46:56,338 --> 00:46:59,786
Charles...

717
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:01,912
Where are you?

718
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:43,967
Oh!

719
00:49:49,146 --> 00:49:54,053
Mrs Mills!

720
00:49:55,354 --> 00:49:56,895
What's the matter, ma'am?

721
00:49:56,938 --> 00:50:00,517
The key to the music room,
give it to me! Quickly!

722
00:50:00,563 --> 00:50:03,135
- What's happening, ma'am?
- Come on!

723
00:50:11,939 --> 00:50:14,474
Oh, my God.

724
00:50:14,522 --> 00:50:16,265
Oh!

725
00:50:16,315 --> 00:50:19,313
I checked that room myself.

726
00:50:21,357 --> 00:50:23,265
It was empty.

727
00:50:23,316 --> 00:50:26,065
Take these tablets, ma'am.

728
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:28,015
They'll do you good.

729
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:31,313
And yet I felt as if
there was someone else there.

730
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:35,055
And it wasn't human.

731
00:50:35,108 --> 00:50:38,391
There is something
in this house.

732
00:50:38,441 --> 00:50:40,314
Something diabolic.

733
00:50:40,359 --> 00:50:41,851
Ma'am...

734
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,898
Something which is not...

735
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:49,400
...not at rest.

736
00:50:52,651 --> 00:50:55,318
I know you don't believe it.

737
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,979
You don't believe it, do you?

738
00:50:58,027 --> 00:50:59,401
I don't blame you.

739
00:50:59,444 --> 00:51:03,485
I used to not believe
these things.

740
00:51:04,819 --> 00:51:08,351
I do believe it, ma'am.

741
00:51:09,903 --> 00:51:13,020
I've always believed
in those things.

742
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,310
They're not easy to explain...

743
00:51:15,362 --> 00:51:17,020
but they do happen.

744
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:22,024
We've all heard stories of...
the beyond...

745
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:25,022
...now and then...

746
00:51:25,071 --> 00:51:32,230
...and I think sometimes
the world of the dead...

747
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:36,025
...gets mixed up with
the world of the living.

748
00:51:36,072 --> 00:51:39,023
But it's impossible.

749
00:51:39,072 --> 00:51:41,395
The Lord would never allow
such an aberration.

750
00:51:41,448 --> 00:51:42,645
The living and the dead...

751
00:51:42,697 --> 00:51:46,773
...will only meet
at the end of eternity.

752
00:51:46,822 --> 00:51:49,525
It says so in the Bible.

753
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,978
Ma'am...

754
00:51:52,031 --> 00:51:56,938
...there isn't always
an answer for everything.

755
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:09,983
Where are you off to, ma'am?

756
00:52:10,033 --> 00:52:12,865
I'm going to the village
to pay Father McGraw a visit.

757
00:52:12,908 --> 00:52:14,982
If he won't come here,
then I shall go to him.

758
00:52:15,033 --> 00:52:16,361
I shall bring him back.

759
00:52:16,409 --> 00:52:18,530
Ma'am, you should wait
till the weather improves.

760
00:52:18,576 --> 00:52:20,401
I've waited long enough.

761
00:52:20,451 --> 00:52:22,608
Ma'am, the priest told me that-

762
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,816
I don't care what he told you!

763
00:52:24,867 --> 00:52:26,989
I want him to tell me
personally!

764
00:52:27,034 --> 00:52:28,611
He must come today!

765
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,450
But what are you
going to tell him?

766
00:52:30,494 --> 00:52:33,242
That we have searched
every room inch by inch...

767
00:52:33,285 --> 00:52:35,952
and now I need them
to be blessed.

768
00:52:37,327 --> 00:52:39,484
Ma'am, please, wait.

769
00:52:39,536 --> 00:52:40,945
Still, it's very early.

770
00:52:40,994 --> 00:52:43,234
- Mr Tuttle.
- Morning, ma'am.

771
00:52:43,286 --> 00:52:46,237
I need you to search
the garden for gravestones.

772
00:52:46,286 --> 00:52:47,530
Gravestones?

773
00:52:47,578 --> 00:52:48,952
Yes. when my husband
bought this house...

774
00:52:48,995 --> 00:52:50,868
we were told there
was a little cemetery.

775
00:52:50,912 --> 00:52:53,282
I think it was over there,
amongst the trees.

776
00:52:53,329 --> 00:52:54,526
I've not seen anything.

777
00:52:54,579 --> 00:52:57,661
Check carefully.
It could be overgrown.

778
00:52:57,704 --> 00:52:58,983
Yes, ma'am.

779
00:52:59,037 --> 00:53:01,361
I need to know if there was
a family buried here...

780
00:53:01,413 --> 00:53:04,115
and if they had
a little boy... Victor.

781
00:53:19,289 --> 00:53:22,537
Now she thinks
the house is haunted.

782
00:53:22,581 --> 00:53:25,248
Do you think
it's safe to let her go?

783
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:28,703
Oh, don't worry. The fog
won't let her get very far.

784
00:53:28,749 --> 00:53:30,325
Oh, yes, the fog.

785
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:32,863
The fog, of course.

786
00:53:32,916 --> 00:53:34,492
And when do you think...

787
00:53:34,541 --> 00:53:37,907
...we should bring all
this out into the open?

788
00:53:37,958 --> 00:53:39,830
All in good time, Mr Tuttle.

789
00:53:39,875 --> 00:53:42,280
All in good time.

790
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:44,905
Speaking of which.

791
00:53:44,959 --> 00:53:46,368
Oh!

792
00:54:54,881 --> 00:54:56,209
Wha-

793
00:55:03,507 --> 00:55:04,881
Oh.

794
00:55:34,635 --> 00:55:35,914
Oh!

795
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,166
Charles?

796
00:55:41,219 --> 00:55:42,499
Grace?

797
00:55:45,636 --> 00:55:47,592
Oh.

798
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:48,915
Oh!

799
00:55:49,845 --> 00:55:51,670
Oh!

800
00:55:56,596 --> 00:55:59,961
You're here. You're here.

801
00:56:00,012 --> 00:56:02,133
They said there was no hope.

802
00:56:02,179 --> 00:56:05,380
They said I should
give you up for dead.

803
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:08,048
They say a lot of things.

804
00:56:08,096 --> 00:56:10,502
Oh.

805
00:56:10,555 --> 00:56:12,380
Oh!

806
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:15,179
Oh, thank you.

807
00:56:15,222 --> 00:56:18,347
Thank you, God.

808
00:56:18,389 --> 00:56:21,506
Every night I prayed for this...

809
00:56:21,556 --> 00:56:24,045
begging God to bring you back.

810
00:56:25,889 --> 00:56:28,295
Bring the children
their father back.

811
00:56:28,348 --> 00:56:29,889
Bring him...

812
00:56:32,349 --> 00:56:35,632
But where have you been
all this time?

813
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:40,305
Out there...
looking for my home.

814
00:56:47,308 --> 00:56:50,307
You're so different.

815
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:52,425
So different.

816
00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:55,225
Sometimes I bleed.

817
00:57:32,187 --> 00:57:33,728
Ma'am-

818
00:57:34,896 --> 00:57:39,470
Mrs Mills...

819
00:57:39,521 --> 00:57:41,596
this is my husband.

820
00:57:44,647 --> 00:57:47,396
I'm very pleased
to meet you, sir.

821
00:57:47,439 --> 00:57:49,430
He's very weak.

822
00:57:49,481 --> 00:57:50,760
Here.

823
00:57:53,314 --> 00:57:56,396
I want you to prepare a hot bath
and some clean clothes.

824
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,644
And something to eat.

825
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:01,309
Right away, ma'am.

826
00:58:19,442 --> 00:58:21,479
How are my little ones?

827
00:58:23,734 --> 00:58:25,013
Daddy!

828
00:58:27,609 --> 00:58:30,560
Why did you take so long?

829
00:58:37,485 --> 00:58:38,895
Hello, Nicholas.

830
00:58:38,944 --> 00:58:40,270
I told you, you see.

831
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:41,977
I told you he'd come back.

832
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:51,025
Have you both been well-behaved?

833
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:52,776
We've been very good.

834
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,278
Have you been good
to your mother?

835
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:55,599
Very good.

836
00:58:55,653 --> 00:58:58,854
We study every day
for our First Communion.

837
00:58:58,904 --> 00:59:02,483
Daddy, did you kill anyone?

838
00:59:07,446 --> 00:59:10,149
Oh! Here he comes!

839
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:16,984
Darling,
we've prepared lunch for you.

840
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:19,235
Are you coming down
or would you prefer-

841
00:59:31,823 --> 00:59:33,481
When's Daddy coming down?

842
00:59:33,531 --> 00:59:37,478
Be patient, Anne.
Daddy is... not well.

843
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:39,523
He said he'd seen
a lot of dead men.

844
00:59:39,574 --> 00:59:41,316
Shh.

845
00:59:43,949 --> 00:59:47,150
Mummy, when people die
in the war...

846
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,397
Where do they go?

847
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:50,358
Oh, what a question.

848
00:59:50,409 --> 00:59:54,237
- It depends.
- On what?

849
00:59:54,284 --> 00:59:57,898
Whether they fought on the side
of the goodies or the baddies.

850
00:59:57,951 --> 01:00:00,522
Your father, for example,
fought for England...

851
01:00:00,575 --> 01:00:02,650
on the side of the goodies.

852
01:00:04,535 --> 01:00:07,106
How do you know who the goodies
and the baddies are?

853
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:10,028
That's enough questions.
Eat your food.

854
01:00:10,077 --> 01:00:11,699
You'll never go to war.

855
01:00:11,743 --> 01:00:13,699
We'll never go anywhere.

856
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:15,983
Oh.

857
01:00:16,036 --> 01:00:18,987
You're not missing out
on anything.

858
01:00:19,036 --> 01:00:21,525
You're much better off at home
with your Mummy and Daddy...

859
01:00:21,578 --> 01:00:23,569
who love you very, very much.

860
01:00:25,579 --> 01:00:26,905
And the intruders.

861
01:00:28,579 --> 01:00:31,150
There are no intruders here.

862
01:00:31,204 --> 01:00:33,325
But you said that there were.

863
01:00:33,371 --> 01:00:34,828
No, I said that
there are no intruders here.

864
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:36,778
I don't want to hear
another word on the subject.

865
01:00:36,829 --> 01:00:39,400
- But you said-
- That is enough!

866
01:00:39,455 --> 01:00:41,659
Can I say something?

867
01:00:41,705 --> 01:00:42,948
- No!
- Why not?

868
01:00:42,996 --> 01:00:45,616
Because you can't!

869
01:00:51,372 --> 01:00:53,861
Anne, stop breathing like that.

870
01:00:56,123 --> 01:00:57,829
You heard me. Stop it.

871
01:01:00,831 --> 01:01:03,237
Stop breathing.

872
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:07,325
Right, you go to your room.

873
01:01:07,374 --> 01:01:11,415
Go to your room.
No dessert for you today.

874
01:01:15,249 --> 01:01:19,457
Oh, no crying now, no crying.

875
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,455
Oh, stop that here.

876
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,948
Look what an awful face
you've got when you cry.

877
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,580
- I don't care!
- There, there.

878
01:01:28,626 --> 01:01:31,956
You listen to me.

879
01:01:32,001 --> 01:01:34,324
I've seen them, too.

880
01:01:34,376 --> 01:01:36,616
You have?

881
01:01:36,668 --> 01:01:39,156
Yes.

882
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:41,959
Why don't you tell my mother?
Then maybe she'll believe me.

883
01:01:42,001 --> 01:01:45,118
There are things your mother
doesn't want to hear.

884
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:48,202
She only believes
in what she was taught.

885
01:01:48,252 --> 01:01:52,993
But don't worry,
sooner or later...

886
01:01:53,044 --> 01:01:55,082
...she'll see them.

887
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,332
Then everything
will be different.

888
01:01:57,378 --> 01:02:00,210
How?

889
01:02:00,253 --> 01:02:02,624
Oh, you'll see.

890
01:02:02,671 --> 01:02:06,367
There are going to be
some big surprises.

891
01:02:06,421 --> 01:02:11,078
There are going to be...
changes.

892
01:02:11,129 --> 01:02:13,120
Changes?

893
01:02:24,464 --> 01:02:29,003
Now she's behaving
as if nothing had happened.

894
01:02:29,048 --> 01:02:31,371
What about her daughter?

895
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:33,579
Oh, she's not so stubborn.

896
01:02:33,632 --> 01:02:36,832
The children will be
easier to convince.

897
01:02:36,882 --> 01:02:41,954
No, it's the mother who's going
to cause us problems.

898
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:45,918
Do you think her husband
suspects anything?

899
01:02:45,966 --> 01:02:50,707
No. I don't think
he even knows where he is.

900
01:03:05,135 --> 01:03:09,626
Oh, look what
a pretty daughter I've got.

901
01:03:11,385 --> 01:03:15,628
Mummy made this veil
especially for you.

902
01:03:15,677 --> 01:03:18,426
- Hmm?
- I look like a bride.

903
01:03:19,636 --> 01:03:22,799
Yes. You do.

904
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:30,132
I need to shorten
the sleeves a little.

905
01:03:30,179 --> 01:03:32,548
- You can take it off now.
- No.

906
01:03:32,595 --> 01:03:34,752
This dress has to be spotless
for your First Communion.

907
01:03:34,804 --> 01:03:36,297
I promise I won't dirty it.

908
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:39,344
Just let me wear it
for a little longer.

909
01:03:39,387 --> 01:03:41,876
Oh, just a little?

910
01:03:41,929 --> 01:03:46,551
All right.
I'll be back shortly.

911
01:03:46,596 --> 01:03:49,002
No sitting on the floor
or leaning against the walls.

912
01:03:49,055 --> 01:03:50,383
No.

913
01:04:06,349 --> 01:04:09,347
Monsieur,
would you like to dance?

914
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:14,131
I'd love to.

915
01:04:37,143 --> 01:04:39,299
Charles,
you can't go on like this.

916
01:04:39,352 --> 01:04:42,266
You must eat something.

917
01:04:45,768 --> 01:04:48,139
Oooh.

918
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:06,266
# In the sky #

919
01:05:06,312 --> 01:05:11,302
# I don't know if
it's cloudy or bright #

920
01:05:13,104 --> 01:05:17,015
# But I only have eyes #

921
01:05:17,063 --> 01:05:21,851
# For you, dear #

922
01:05:21,896 --> 01:05:26,222
# The moon may be high #

923
01:05:58,066 --> 01:06:00,472
Anne, you need to take
the dress off now.

924
01:06:04,275 --> 01:06:07,227
Anne, are you listening to me?

925
01:06:08,943 --> 01:06:10,222
Anne?

926
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:17,181
What did I tell you
about sitting on the floor?

927
01:06:17,235 --> 01:06:18,645
But it's clean.

928
01:06:18,694 --> 01:06:19,973
It makes no difference.

929
01:06:20,027 --> 01:06:22,895
Why can't you ever do
as you're told...

930
01:06:46,237 --> 01:06:47,779
What's the matter?

931
01:06:47,821 --> 01:06:49,978
Where is my daughter?

932
01:06:52,405 --> 01:06:55,569
What have you done
with my daughter?

933
01:06:55,614 --> 01:06:58,944
Are you mad? I am your daughter.

934
01:06:58,989 --> 01:07:01,774
No! You're not my daughter!

935
01:07:03,406 --> 01:07:06,854
No! No!

936
01:07:06,907 --> 01:07:08,104
Aah!

937
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:10,562
You're not my daughter! No!

938
01:07:10,615 --> 01:07:14,775
- Aah!
- No! Aah!

939
01:07:24,491 --> 01:07:26,150
Ma'am, I heard shouts.

940
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,609
She wants to kill me!

941
01:07:27,658 --> 01:07:30,112
She won't stop until she kills us!

942
01:07:30,159 --> 01:07:32,314
She won't stop!

943
01:07:32,367 --> 01:07:33,943
Hush, child. Come with me.

944
01:07:33,992 --> 01:07:36,362
You're wicked!
You're wicked! wicked!

945
01:07:37,659 --> 01:07:38,856
Wicked!

946
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,902
How is she?

947
01:07:50,952 --> 01:07:53,487
There's no calming her...

948
01:07:53,535 --> 01:07:55,194
so I've left her with her father.

949
01:07:55,244 --> 01:07:56,488
Oh!

950
01:07:56,536 --> 01:07:58,740
She insisted on speaking with him.

951
01:08:02,162 --> 01:08:05,113
What happened? Why did you fight?

952
01:08:05,162 --> 01:08:06,903
It wasn't her.

953
01:08:06,954 --> 01:08:11,492
It was the old woman
with the strange eyes.

954
01:08:11,537 --> 01:08:13,824
She was imitating
my daughter's voice.

955
01:08:13,871 --> 01:08:18,410
I'd swear to God that
it wasn't my daughter.

956
01:08:18,454 --> 01:08:23,077
Oh, God. God help me.

957
01:08:23,122 --> 01:08:26,487
God help me.
What's the matter with me?

958
01:08:26,538 --> 01:08:29,074
I don't know what's
the matter with me.

959
01:08:29,122 --> 01:08:31,693
You must get more rest.

960
01:08:34,081 --> 01:08:38,537
You can't take on the whole
responsibility of this house.

961
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:40,074
Leave it to us.

962
01:08:40,123 --> 01:08:42,611
We know what has to be done.

963
01:08:45,832 --> 01:08:47,657
What do you mean by that?

964
01:08:49,124 --> 01:08:51,447
What do you mean
you know what has to be done?

965
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,325
Nothing, ma'am.
I was just suggesting-

966
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:56,242
There's nothing to suggest.

967
01:08:56,291 --> 01:08:57,748
Who do you think you are?

968
01:08:57,791 --> 01:08:59,698
You have no idea
what has to be done.

969
01:09:04,417 --> 01:09:06,040
Or do you?

970
01:09:09,459 --> 01:09:11,912
What are these?

971
01:09:14,001 --> 01:09:17,829
The tablets for
your migraine, ma'am.

972
01:09:17,876 --> 01:09:19,666
The ones you always take.

973
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:23,290
Please, I need to be on my own.

974
01:09:23,336 --> 01:09:25,871
Yes, ma'am.

975
01:09:49,421 --> 01:09:51,329
Come, child.

976
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,411
Anne told me everything.

977
01:10:22,508 --> 01:10:25,755
I wish I had an explanation,
but I haven't.

978
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:28,169
At first, I thought there
was someone else in the house.

979
01:10:28,216 --> 01:10:29,709
Even thought there were ghosts.

980
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:32,626
I'm not talking about the ghosts.

981
01:10:32,675 --> 01:10:35,709
I'm talking about
what happened that day.

982
01:10:42,843 --> 01:10:44,632
I don't know what
you're talking about.

983
01:10:44,676 --> 01:10:46,632
Tell me it's not true.

984
01:10:46,676 --> 01:10:49,544
Tell me what happened.

985
01:10:49,593 --> 01:10:53,539
Happened?

986
01:10:56,886 --> 01:11:00,334
I don't know what
came over me that day.

987
01:11:00,386 --> 01:11:04,131
The servants had left
during the night.

988
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:07,840
Hadn't the courage
to tell me to my face.

989
01:11:09,637 --> 01:11:15,883
They knew that I couldn't
leave the house.

990
01:11:15,929 --> 01:11:20,385
They knew.

991
01:11:20,429 --> 01:11:23,214
Anne.

992
01:11:23,263 --> 01:11:26,344
Anne, what happened?

993
01:11:28,139 --> 01:11:30,425
She hit me.

994
01:11:30,472 --> 01:11:33,920
She went mad like she did that day.

995
01:11:33,973 --> 01:11:37,385
Do you remember?

996
01:11:37,431 --> 01:11:39,635
No.

997
01:11:39,681 --> 01:11:44,884
You must forgive me, Charles.

998
01:11:44,932 --> 01:11:48,629
Not me. The children.

999
01:11:48,682 --> 01:11:52,214
They know that I love them.

1000
01:11:52,265 --> 01:11:54,671
They know I'd never hurt them.

1001
01:11:54,724 --> 01:11:56,929
I'd die first.

1002
01:12:00,391 --> 01:12:03,141
What are you going to do?

1003
01:12:03,184 --> 01:12:06,098
Are you angry with me?

1004
01:12:08,934 --> 01:12:11,174
I just came back to say good-bye...

1005
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:12,884
to my wife and children.

1006
01:12:12,934 --> 01:12:15,258
Now I must go.

1007
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:17,099
Go where?

1008
01:12:17,143 --> 01:12:19,928
To the front.

1009
01:12:19,977 --> 01:12:21,433
No. The war's over.

1010
01:12:21,476 --> 01:12:24,310
The war is not over.

1011
01:12:24,352 --> 01:12:27,718
What are you talking about?

1012
01:12:27,769 --> 01:12:29,843
You're not going, do you hear me?

1013
01:12:29,894 --> 01:12:32,181
You left us once already.
You can't go!

1014
01:12:32,228 --> 01:12:35,226
Why?

1015
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:38,102
Why did you have to go
to that stupid war...

1016
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:40,633
that had nothing to do with us?

1017
01:12:40,686 --> 01:12:43,638
Why couldn't you have
stayed here like the others?

1018
01:12:43,687 --> 01:12:44,884
The others surrendered.

1019
01:12:44,937 --> 01:12:46,844
We all surrendered!

1020
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:50,262
The whole island was occupied!

1021
01:12:50,313 --> 01:12:52,883
What did you expect?

1022
01:12:57,272 --> 01:13:00,637
What were you trying to prove
by going to war?

1023
01:13:00,688 --> 01:13:03,391
Your place was here with us.

1024
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:07,054
With your family.

1025
01:13:11,773 --> 01:13:15,814
I loved you.

1026
01:13:15,856 --> 01:13:18,689
That was enough for me.

1027
01:13:18,731 --> 01:13:23,224
Living in this darkness...

1028
01:13:23,274 --> 01:13:25,679
...in this prison.

1029
01:13:28,024 --> 01:13:31,272
But not for you.

1030
01:13:31,316 --> 01:13:34,812
I wasn't enough for you.

1031
01:13:34,858 --> 01:13:37,561
That's why you left.

1032
01:13:39,317 --> 01:13:41,604
It wasn't just the war.

1033
01:13:44,526 --> 01:13:48,022
You want to leave me, don't you?

1034
01:13:58,818 --> 01:14:00,360
Oh.

1035
01:15:54,162 --> 01:15:55,988
Anne!

1036
01:15:56,038 --> 01:15:58,443
Nicholas!

1037
01:16:08,164 --> 01:16:10,617
What is it? What-

1038
01:16:10,664 --> 01:16:13,496
Oh! Oh!

1039
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:18,196
Oh, my God!

1040
01:16:18,248 --> 01:16:21,696
Here! Oh, my God!

1041
01:16:22,623 --> 01:16:25,325
Oh! Oh!

1042
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:29,361
Here!

1043
01:16:32,916 --> 01:16:34,196
Oh!

1044
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:36,999
Aah!

1045
01:16:40,375 --> 01:16:42,283
Where are the curtains?

1046
01:16:47,001 --> 01:16:49,536
Mrs Mills!

1047
01:17:04,253 --> 01:17:07,085
Let me see. Let me see.

1048
01:17:07,128 --> 01:17:10,375
Oh, you're all right!
You're all right!

1049
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:13,999
I want my daddy!

1050
01:17:17,795 --> 01:17:19,288
Daddy's gone.

1051
01:17:19,337 --> 01:17:21,493
It's not true!

1052
01:17:21,545 --> 01:17:24,543
Yes, it is.

1053
01:17:24,587 --> 01:17:27,041
It is true.

1054
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:30,833
I love you, Mummy.

1055
01:17:37,922 --> 01:17:40,790
Find the curtains.

1056
01:17:43,339 --> 01:17:45,414
Who was it?

1057
01:17:45,465 --> 01:17:46,708
Who did this?

1058
01:17:46,756 --> 01:17:50,123
Tell me!

1059
01:17:52,173 --> 01:17:53,417
You know what's happening here!

1060
01:17:53,465 --> 01:17:55,751
You know because
it happened to you, too!

1061
01:17:55,798 --> 01:17:57,955
You'll tell me.

1062
01:17:58,007 --> 01:17:59,500
You write it down.

1063
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:02,548
Write it down! Please!

1064
01:18:02,591 --> 01:18:05,293
That attitude won't
solve anything, ma'am.

1065
01:18:05,341 --> 01:18:08,090
Anyway, she can't write.

1066
01:18:08,133 --> 01:18:10,373
- Where are they?
- What?

1067
01:18:10,425 --> 01:18:11,799
The curtains!

1068
01:18:11,841 --> 01:18:14,709
The curtains my children's
lives depend on!

1069
01:18:14,758 --> 01:18:16,252
Someone has taken the curtains!

1070
01:18:16,301 --> 01:18:17,580
I have noticed, ma'am.

1071
01:18:17,634 --> 01:18:20,668
There's no need for you
to raise your voice.

1072
01:18:20,717 --> 01:18:24,083
Oh, Mr Tuttle. I was just
on the point of calling you.

1073
01:18:24,134 --> 01:18:28,129
Did you know that someone
has taken all the curtains?

1074
01:18:28,176 --> 01:18:31,424
The curtains?

1075
01:18:31,469 --> 01:18:34,004
Oh, dear.

1076
01:18:34,052 --> 01:18:37,584
Why should anyone want
to take all the curtains?

1077
01:18:37,636 --> 01:18:41,547
To let some daylight
into this house, I imagine.

1078
01:18:41,595 --> 01:18:44,794
Daylight. of course.

1079
01:18:44,844 --> 01:18:47,131
Someone wants to kill
my children.

1080
01:18:47,178 --> 01:18:50,093
Why do you think that
the daylight would kill them?

1081
01:18:50,137 --> 01:18:53,669
Are you mad?

1082
01:18:53,721 --> 01:18:56,174
I told you.

1083
01:18:56,221 --> 01:18:57,843
I already told you!

1084
01:18:57,887 --> 01:19:01,253
The children are photosensitive!
The light will kill them!

1085
01:19:01,304 --> 01:19:03,794
Yes, but that was before.

1086
01:19:03,847 --> 01:19:06,762
The condition could have
cleared up by itself.

1087
01:19:06,805 --> 01:19:09,424
If you never expose
them to daylight...

1088
01:19:09,472 --> 01:19:11,214
...how do you know
they're not cured?

1089
01:19:11,264 --> 01:19:16,051
My sister-in-law had terrible
attacks of rheumatism...

1090
01:19:16,097 --> 01:19:18,302
in her legs and back.

1091
01:19:18,348 --> 01:19:21,180
Then one fine day...

1092
01:19:22,473 --> 01:19:24,464
they disappeared.

1093
01:19:25,932 --> 01:19:27,757
I am going to
find those curtains...

1094
01:19:27,807 --> 01:19:30,011
and when you have finished
helping me hang them...

1095
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:32,094
you will leave this house!

1096
01:19:45,392 --> 01:19:47,383
And what about the master,
ma'am?

1097
01:19:47,434 --> 01:19:50,385
What has he got to say
about all of this?

1098
01:19:50,434 --> 01:19:52,674
Give me your keys.

1099
01:19:52,726 --> 01:19:54,633
I want your keys now!

1100
01:19:59,101 --> 01:20:01,306
I know what you want.

1101
01:20:01,351 --> 01:20:02,975
You want to frighten us.

1102
01:20:03,019 --> 01:20:05,139
You want to get us out,
me and my children.

1103
01:20:05,185 --> 01:20:06,382
You've wanted to
take over this house...

1104
01:20:06,435 --> 01:20:08,391
ever since the first day
you arrived.

1105
01:20:08,435 --> 01:20:12,430
Now, you give me those keys.
I will not ask again.

1106
01:20:12,478 --> 01:20:14,184
You should try
and calm down, ma'am.

1107
01:20:14,227 --> 01:20:17,309
Give me the keys.

1108
01:20:18,436 --> 01:20:19,894
Give them to me.

1109
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:28,261
And now get out of here.

1110
01:20:44,897 --> 01:20:48,938
You know something, Mr Tuttle?

1111
01:20:48,981 --> 01:20:52,098
I think I've reached
the end of my tether.

1112
01:20:52,148 --> 01:20:54,304
What about you?

1113
01:20:54,356 --> 01:20:59,098
Oh, yes. Definitely.

1114
01:20:59,149 --> 01:21:02,680
We'd better go and uncover
the gravestones.

1115
01:21:41,361 --> 01:21:43,019
What's Mummy doing?

1116
01:21:43,069 --> 01:21:45,309
I've already told you.
She's gone mad.

1117
01:21:45,361 --> 01:21:46,735
Liar.

1118
01:21:46,778 --> 01:21:51,980
- She's gone mad!
- Liar, liar!

1119
01:21:57,237 --> 01:21:59,228
Night-time.

1120
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:01,814
Where are you going?

1121
01:22:01,862 --> 01:22:04,896
I've had enough.

1122
01:22:04,946 --> 01:22:07,186
I'm going into the woods
to look for Daddy.

1123
01:22:07,238 --> 01:22:09,905
Are you going to run away?

1124
01:22:11,696 --> 01:22:15,027
If I hang onto the pipe,
I can climb down to the ground.

1125
01:22:15,072 --> 01:22:16,979
It's very easy.

1126
01:22:30,282 --> 01:22:33,648
If Mummy finds out,
you're in for it.

1127
01:22:33,698 --> 01:22:35,938
Yes, yes, yes.

1128
01:22:45,283 --> 01:22:47,239
Anne, wait!

1129
01:22:47,283 --> 01:22:49,523
I want to come and look
for Daddy, too.

1130
01:22:49,576 --> 01:22:52,905
Liar. You just don't want
to be left on your own.

1131
01:22:52,950 --> 01:22:54,492
Scaredy-pants, scaredy-pants!

1132
01:22:54,534 --> 01:22:55,777
Be quiet!

1133
01:23:49,414 --> 01:23:51,820
Anne, I think we got lost.

1134
01:23:51,873 --> 01:23:54,989
We still haven't left
the garden yet, silly.

1135
01:23:55,039 --> 01:23:58,985
- I'm scared.
- Shouldn't have come, then.

1136
01:24:02,081 --> 01:24:05,163
- Say something.
- What shall I say?

1137
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:07,613
I don't know. Anything.

1138
01:24:07,666 --> 01:24:10,949
Let's see.
My name is Anne and I'm walking.

1139
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,037
I'm walking and my name is Anne.

1140
01:24:39,961 --> 01:24:42,449
What's that over there?

1141
01:24:43,502 --> 01:24:45,956
I think they're graves.

1142
01:24:46,961 --> 01:24:48,584
Don't go near!

1143
01:24:48,628 --> 01:24:50,250
Why not?

1144
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:52,665
What if a ghost jumps out?

1145
01:24:52,711 --> 01:24:55,829
Graves don't have ghosts.
only skeletons.

1146
01:25:13,005 --> 01:25:14,379
There's something written here.

1147
01:25:14,421 --> 01:25:15,879
Let's go!

1148
01:25:15,922 --> 01:25:18,291
Wait!

1149
01:25:36,799 --> 01:25:38,126
Oh!

1150
01:25:40,341 --> 01:25:43,374
Anne! What does it say?

1151
01:25:51,134 --> 01:25:53,420
You must be
strong now, children.

1152
01:25:53,467 --> 01:25:55,837
Nicholas, come here!

1153
01:25:55,884 --> 01:25:59,332
Mrs Mills, please don't
tell Mummy we've run away.

1154
01:25:59,385 --> 01:26:00,628
Don't speak to them!

1155
01:26:00,676 --> 01:26:02,666
Why?

1156
01:26:02,718 --> 01:26:05,041
- They're dead!
- What?

1157
01:26:05,093 --> 01:26:07,084
They're ghosts!
Please come here!

1158
01:26:07,135 --> 01:26:09,422
Children!

1159
01:26:09,468 --> 01:26:11,341
Nicholas!

1160
01:26:11,386 --> 01:26:13,044
They're ghosts?

1161
01:26:13,094 --> 01:26:15,499
Why aren't they wearing sheets
and clanking chains?

1162
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:17,010
You said that-

1163
01:26:17,053 --> 01:26:19,376
I don't care what I said!
Get away from them!

1164
01:26:19,428 --> 01:26:22,426
You're always teasing me
and telling lies...

1165
01:26:22,470 --> 01:26:23,927
and I'm sick of it!

1166
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:26,044
I'm not teasing you!
I'm telling the truth!

1167
01:26:26,095 --> 01:26:28,418
Come here!

1168
01:26:30,304 --> 01:26:32,045
Quick!

1169
01:26:32,096 --> 01:26:35,627
Aah! Mum! Mum!

1170
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:38,382
Children!

1171
01:26:43,721 --> 01:26:46,971
Run!

1172
01:26:47,013 --> 01:26:50,427
Go! Into the house!

1173
01:26:51,805 --> 01:26:54,555
Don't come any closer!

1174
01:26:54,598 --> 01:26:57,549
Don't move!

1175
01:27:01,307 --> 01:27:03,013
Don't trouble yourself, ma'am.

1176
01:27:03,057 --> 01:27:05,971
Tuberculosis finished us off...

1177
01:27:06,015 --> 01:27:08,717
more than half a century ago.

1178
01:27:28,809 --> 01:27:30,218
Go away!

1179
01:27:36,768 --> 01:27:38,309
Open the door, ma'am. Please.

1180
01:27:38,352 --> 01:27:39,631
What do you want?

1181
01:27:39,685 --> 01:27:42,352
Mummy, don't open the door.
Don't.

1182
01:27:42,394 --> 01:27:44,550
We've seen their graves.

1183
01:27:44,602 --> 01:27:46,474
Go upstairs and hide.

1184
01:27:46,519 --> 01:27:48,474
- Go on.
- I'm scared.

1185
01:27:48,519 --> 01:27:51,352
Oh!

1186
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:57,846
Don't separate! Oh!

1187
01:27:58,978 --> 01:28:00,555
Oh!

1188
01:28:03,813 --> 01:28:07,260
Whatever you do, don't separate.

1189
01:28:07,312 --> 01:28:11,520
Go hide. Go. Go.

1190
01:28:11,563 --> 01:28:14,312
We've been trying
to make you understand.

1191
01:28:16,855 --> 01:28:18,597
Understand what?

1192
01:28:18,647 --> 01:28:20,139
About the house.

1193
01:28:20,188 --> 01:28:22,891
About the new situation.

1194
01:28:22,939 --> 01:28:25,095
What situation?

1195
01:28:25,147 --> 01:28:29,473
We must all learn
to live together...

1196
01:28:29,523 --> 01:28:30,767
the living and the dead.

1197
01:28:30,815 --> 01:28:32,272
Oh!

1198
01:28:32,315 --> 01:28:36,309
If you're dead,
leave us in peace!

1199
01:28:36,357 --> 01:28:38,893
Oh. Leave us in peace!

1200
01:28:38,941 --> 01:28:42,187
Leave us in peace!

1201
01:28:47,149 --> 01:28:49,852
In here. Get inside.

1202
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:57,186
And suppose we do leave you.

1203
01:28:57,233 --> 01:28:59,438
Do you think they will?

1204
01:28:59,484 --> 01:29:00,942
Who?

1205
01:29:00,984 --> 01:29:03,059
The intruders.

1206
01:29:03,110 --> 01:29:05,313
There are no intruders.

1207
01:29:05,359 --> 01:29:06,687
They took the curtains down.

1208
01:29:06,735 --> 01:29:08,109
There are no intruders.

1209
01:29:08,151 --> 01:29:10,818
Oh, yes,
I assure you it was them.

1210
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:14,901
And now they're in there
with you and the children.

1211
01:29:14,944 --> 01:29:17,313
- Waiting for you.
- No!

1212
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:21,769
Yes. And believe me,
sooner or later...

1213
01:29:21,819 --> 01:29:24,272
...they'll find you.

1214
01:29:24,361 --> 01:29:26,233
Listen, wait here, and
I'll be back in a minute.

1215
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:29,229
No, no, no. Mummy said
we shouldn't separate.

1216
01:29:29,278 --> 01:29:31,233
We can't leave her on her own.

1217
01:29:35,529 --> 01:29:38,361
Stop breathing like that.

1218
01:29:45,321 --> 01:29:48,237
Nicholas,
stop breathing like that.

1219
01:29:51,114 --> 01:29:52,855
Stop breathing!

1220
01:29:54,822 --> 01:29:59,610
Can't you hear it?
There's someone there.

1221
01:30:02,073 --> 01:30:04,822
Come with us, children.

1222
01:30:04,865 --> 01:30:07,898
Come with us.

1223
01:30:09,241 --> 01:30:10,519
Aah!

1224
01:30:14,199 --> 01:30:15,857
Nicholas?

1225
01:30:18,033 --> 01:30:19,312
Anne?

1226
01:30:21,866 --> 01:30:23,857
Where are you?

1227
01:30:26,742 --> 01:30:28,732
Answer me!

1228
01:30:28,783 --> 01:30:30,193
The intruders have found them.

1229
01:30:30,242 --> 01:30:32,813
There's nothing we can do now.

1230
01:30:32,867 --> 01:30:38,105
You'll have to go
upstairs and talk to them.

1231
01:30:55,370 --> 01:30:58,154
Our Father, who art in Heaven...

1232
01:30:58,203 --> 01:31:00,360
Hallowed be Thy name.

1233
01:31:00,412 --> 01:31:02,284
Thy kingdom come...

1234
01:31:02,329 --> 01:31:04,485
Thy will be done on earth...

1235
01:31:04,537 --> 01:31:07,204
As it is in Heaven.

1236
01:31:07,246 --> 01:31:09,650
Give us this day our daily bread...

1237
01:31:09,704 --> 01:31:11,363
And forgive us our trespasses...

1238
01:31:14,746 --> 01:31:17,531
Why are you afraid, children?

1239
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:20,614
Why don't you want us
to be your friends?

1240
01:31:22,622 --> 01:31:26,367
Come on. Speak to us.

1241
01:31:26,414 --> 01:31:28,783
Speak to us.

1242
01:31:32,872 --> 01:31:36,453
Tell me what happened.

1243
01:31:37,789 --> 01:31:40,953
Don't tell her!
Don't tell her!

1244
01:31:40,998 --> 01:31:44,743
"Don't tell her."

1245
01:31:44,790 --> 01:31:49,365
If I tell her,
they'll leave us in peace.

1246
01:31:50,375 --> 01:31:51,783
Mummy!

1247
01:31:53,708 --> 01:31:55,284
"Mummy."

1248
01:31:55,333 --> 01:31:58,746
Why are you crying, children?

1249
01:31:58,791 --> 01:32:02,158
What happened in this room?

1250
01:32:02,209 --> 01:32:06,748
What did your mother do to you?

1251
01:32:17,502 --> 01:32:19,789
Something about a pillow.

1252
01:32:19,836 --> 01:32:23,415
Is that how she killed you?

1253
01:32:24,753 --> 01:32:26,293
With a pillow?

1254
01:32:26,336 --> 01:32:27,663
She didn't kill us!

1255
01:32:27,711 --> 01:32:29,252
Children, if you're dead...

1256
01:32:29,294 --> 01:32:31,913
why do you remain in this house?

1257
01:32:31,961 --> 01:32:33,916
We're not dead!

1258
01:32:35,253 --> 01:32:36,995
Why do you remain in this house?

1259
01:32:37,045 --> 01:32:42,586
We're not dead!

1260
01:32:42,629 --> 01:32:45,711
Why do you remain in this house?

1261
01:32:45,755 --> 01:32:49,500
"We're not dead. We're not dead."

1262
01:32:49,546 --> 01:32:54,038
- We're not dead!
- We're not dead!

1263
01:32:55,088 --> 01:32:56,961
We're not dead!

1264
01:32:59,964 --> 01:33:01,671
Oh!

1265
01:33:13,173 --> 01:33:14,667
Are you all right?

1266
01:33:14,716 --> 01:33:20,583
Yes. Just a bit dizzy,
that's all.

1267
01:33:20,633 --> 01:33:22,458
What happened?

1268
01:33:22,508 --> 01:33:25,625
They made contact.

1269
01:33:25,675 --> 01:33:27,251
All three?

1270
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:30,298
Apparently, yes.

1271
01:33:30,342 --> 01:33:34,087
The mother and
the two children.

1272
01:33:34,134 --> 01:33:35,840
Quite interesting,
don't you think?

1273
01:33:35,884 --> 01:33:37,840
Interesting?

1274
01:33:37,884 --> 01:33:39,626
I was scared out of my wits!

1275
01:33:39,676 --> 01:33:41,168
Darling, calm down.

1276
01:33:41,217 --> 01:33:44,170
No. So far, we have handled
this matter your way...

1277
01:33:44,218 --> 01:33:45,877
but now you listen to me.

1278
01:33:45,927 --> 01:33:48,332
We can't possibly stay
in this house any longer.

1279
01:33:48,385 --> 01:33:51,833
It is quite clear these beings
do not want us to live here.

1280
01:33:51,886 --> 01:33:53,426
We don't know anything
about them yet.

1281
01:33:53,469 --> 01:33:55,341
Yes, we do!

1282
01:33:55,385 --> 01:33:57,093
We know the woman went mad...

1283
01:33:57,136 --> 01:33:59,969
smothered her two children,
and then shot herself.

1284
01:34:00,011 --> 01:34:03,212
That's quite enough.
Think of our son.

1285
01:34:03,261 --> 01:34:05,051
There's nothing wrong
with Victor.

1286
01:34:05,095 --> 01:34:07,880
Yes, there is!
He has nightmares.

1287
01:34:07,929 --> 01:34:09,801
He says he has seen that girl...

1288
01:34:09,845 --> 01:34:12,216
and even this lady
has been possessed by her.

1289
01:34:12,263 --> 01:34:15,261
Please, let us leave this house.

1290
01:34:15,304 --> 01:34:16,583
All right.

1291
01:34:16,638 --> 01:34:19,920
We will leave tomorrow morning.

1292
01:34:19,971 --> 01:34:22,424
Oh, thank God for that.

1293
01:34:23,847 --> 01:34:26,170
I'll just go
and check on Victor.

1294
01:34:29,223 --> 01:34:31,297
Once again,
thank you so much for coming.

1295
01:34:31,348 --> 01:34:32,591
A pleasure.

1296
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:34,511
I hope we've been of some help.

1297
01:34:34,556 --> 01:34:37,554
Oh, yes, of course.
Though I must admit...

1298
01:34:41,140 --> 01:34:44,552
At first, I couldn't understand...

1299
01:34:44,598 --> 01:34:48,592
...what the pillow
was doing in my hands...

1300
01:34:51,350 --> 01:34:54,217
or why you didn't move.

1301
01:34:58,016 --> 01:35:00,257
But then I knew.

1302
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:05,091
It had happened.

1303
01:35:08,851 --> 01:35:11,470
I had killed my children.

1304
01:35:17,477 --> 01:35:21,719
I got the rifle.

1305
01:35:21,768 --> 01:35:24,008
I put it to my forehead.

1306
01:35:28,186 --> 01:35:30,426
Then I pulled the trigger.

1307
01:35:34,186 --> 01:35:36,426
Nothing.

1308
01:35:43,146 --> 01:35:48,017
Then I heard your laughter
in the bedroom.

1309
01:35:48,063 --> 01:35:51,061
Ahh.

1310
01:35:51,105 --> 01:35:52,514
You were playing
with the pillows...

1311
01:35:52,563 --> 01:35:54,968
as if nothing had happened.

1312
01:35:56,564 --> 01:36:03,722
And I thought
the Lord in His great mercy...

1313
01:36:03,772 --> 01:36:09,687
was giving me another chance...

1314
01:36:09,731 --> 01:36:14,223
telling me, "Don't give up."

1315
01:36:17,357 --> 01:36:19,015
"Be strong."

1316
01:36:20,815 --> 01:36:22,522
"Be a good mother."

1317
01:36:24,941 --> 01:36:26,315
"For them."

1318
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:35,472
But now...

1319
01:36:35,525 --> 01:36:37,101
now...

1320
01:36:40,526 --> 01:36:42,517
what does all this mean?

1321
01:36:47,068 --> 01:36:48,478
Where are we?

1322
01:36:50,402 --> 01:36:52,972
Young Lydia said
the very same thing...

1323
01:36:53,027 --> 01:36:56,642
...when she realized
the three of us were dead.

1324
01:36:57,944 --> 01:37:01,061
And that was the last time
she ever spoke.

1325
01:37:03,111 --> 01:37:06,062
But I couldn't tell you
that before now.

1326
01:37:10,487 --> 01:37:13,982
Shall I make us
a nice cup of tea, ma'am?

1327
01:37:17,905 --> 01:37:19,979
The intruders are leaving...

1328
01:37:20,029 --> 01:37:22,352
but others will come.

1329
01:37:22,404 --> 01:37:24,442
Now, sometimes we'll sense them.

1330
01:37:24,488 --> 01:37:28,067
Other times, we won't.

1331
01:37:28,113 --> 01:37:31,444
But that's the way
it's always been.

1332
01:37:33,447 --> 01:37:34,727
Ma'am.

1333
01:37:39,032 --> 01:37:41,698
Mummy...

1334
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:44,063
Daddy died in the war,
didn't he?

1335
01:37:44,114 --> 01:37:45,608
Yes.

1336
01:37:45,657 --> 01:37:47,398
Will we ever see him again?

1337
01:37:47,448 --> 01:37:50,400
I don't know.

1338
01:37:50,449 --> 01:37:55,236
If we're dead, where's limbo?

1339
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:02,197
I don't know if
there even is a limbo.

1340
01:38:04,366 --> 01:38:07,234
I'm no wiser than you are.

1341
01:38:09,409 --> 01:38:13,568
But I do know that I love you.

1342
01:38:13,617 --> 01:38:16,402
I've always loved you.

1343
01:38:19,202 --> 01:38:22,200
And this house is ours.

1344
01:38:23,827 --> 01:38:26,991
You say it with me.

1345
01:38:27,036 --> 01:38:32,067
This house is ours.

1346
01:38:52,621 --> 01:38:56,236
Mummy, look.
It doesn't hurt any more.

1347
01:39:07,081 --> 01:39:10,032
No one can make us
leave this house.

1348
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:37,742
Come along, Victor.
