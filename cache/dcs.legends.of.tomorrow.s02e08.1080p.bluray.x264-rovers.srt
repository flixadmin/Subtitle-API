1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,424
SARA: <i>Time travel is real</i>

2
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:05,931
<i>and all of history is vulnerable
to attack,</i>

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,807
<i>which is why we must travel through time</i>

4
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:10,810
<i>to stop the spread of these so-called
Time Aberrations</i>

5
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,188
<i>and erase their damage to history.</i>

6
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,645
<i>We are a team of outcasts and misfits,</i>

7
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:18,777
<i>so please don't call us heroes,
we're something else.</i>

8
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:19,937
<i>We're legends.</i>

9
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,149
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>Previously,
on</i> Legends of Tomorrow...

10
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:25,659
You're back.
I love you, Dad.

11
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:29,697
When I last left 2016,
that young woman did not exist.

12
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,161
I do not want to lose my daughter.

13
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:35,453
This amulet looks a lot
like the one we recovered off the Nazis.

14
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:36,791
There's got to be a connection.

15
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:38,627
And we know that Damien Darhk
and this speedster

16
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,831
<i>are willing to kill for it.</i>

17
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:00,940
Mr. Capone,

18
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:04,277
it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

19
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,866
I canceled tickets to the opera,

20
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,993
'cause I heard
there was new players in town.

21
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,538
No one told me it was Halloween.

22
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:15,292
Well, it's more like... Christmas.

23
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,835
I like that. That's very good.

24
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,834
See, my associate and I
have come with a proposition.

25
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,671
<i>We've seen how you run your empire
and we're impressed.</i>

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,345
- But there's room for improvement.
- We'd like to offer our services.

27
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,846
I got a better idea.

28
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,724
How about I show you how business
is done in my town?

29
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:36,388
You or me?

30
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,604
Oh, I've got...

31
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,018
This.

32
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,525
By now you've probably surmised,

33
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,652
that my friend and I aren't
from around here.

34
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,733
- What do you freaks want?
- To help.

35
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,198
I thought...
Did I not make that perfectly clear?

36
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,035
New enemies are coming to Chicago
and they will endanger your enterprises.

37
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,541
And you're saying,
you two can help me out?

38
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,829
Actually, there's three of us.

39
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,713
Pleasure to meet you.

40
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,546
My name is Malcolm Merlyn.

41
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,277
Okay.

42
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,569
New suit's good but I think it needs
those modifications Cisco mentioned.

43
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,575
It's a poor hero to blame his super-suit.

44
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:31,906
Exo-skeleton.

45
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,079
Let's do this, I want to get the
kinks worked out before our next mission.

46
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,239
What's the rush?

47
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,704
I think I'm doing a pretty good job
picking up your slack.

48
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,744
We scientists have a name
for that phenomenon.

49
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,375
It's called beginner's luck.

50
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,081
SARA: <i>Hey!</i>

51
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,341
What do you think you're doing?

52
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,924
- Sparring.
- He's helping me calibrate the new suit.

53
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:53,057
Last time y'all decided to spar,
you wrecked my cargo bay.

54
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,348
- Yeah...
- SARA: <i>Hey!</i>

55
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,102
Don't make me come down here again.

56
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,070
- "Don't you make me come down here again."
- "Don't you make me come down here again."

57
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:07,525
Come down, I'm watching you.

58
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:08,905
Hey!

59
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,283
What is going on with them?

60
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,285
You don't have any brothers or sisters,
do you?

61
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,913
- Nope.
- Sibling rivalry.

62
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,369
Nothing to be too worried about.

63
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,129
This is why I'm glad I'm an only child.

64
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,100
Oh, Jefferson, I was just catching up
on some reading.

65
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,222
<i>- "The Fundamentals of Motorcycle Repair"?</i>
- It's a fascinating subject.

66
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,812
Of course, I'm also researching
the amulet.

67
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,943
Ms. Lance stole from Damien Darhk.

68
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,613
You know, you might be a genius
when it comes to nuclear physics,

69
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,900
but when it comes to lying,
you kind of suck at it, bro.

70
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,325
You were thinking about her again,
weren't you?

71
00:03:58,822 --> 00:03:59,823
I can't help it.

72
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,080
Every day, I recover new memories of her,

73
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,249
each one, a gift.

74
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,002
But then I find myself worrying,

75
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,835
what if there's a car accident, or a fire,

76
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,423
<i>or she could be struck by lightning...</i>

77
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,304
Yeah, I'd be more worried about
what happens

78
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,262
when Sara finds out you have
a daughter who's a Time Aberration.

79
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,389
She is not an Aberration.

80
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,519
The only reason Lily exists

81
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,648
is because you convinced your younger self
to pay more attention to your wife

82
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,942
and less attention to putting on a condom.

83
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,027
You changed history.

84
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,689
And one of these days,
either Nate or Gideon

85
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,699
or anybody reviewing the historical
timeline is gonna figure that out.

86
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:35,859
Not necessarily.

87
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,120
According to my calculations,

88
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,828
if Lily's impact on history remains
small enough,

89
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,367
she may be able to go undetected.

90
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:50,086
GIDEON: <i>Excuse me, but Dr. Heywood's
seismograph has detected an Aberration.</i>

91
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,333
You were saying?

92
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,094
- Who installed the alarms?
- That'd be me.

93
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,004
- I'm gonna kill him.
- We got another one?

94
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,219
Yeah, and judging by these readings,
it's a major one.

95
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,429
Is there really cause for all this alarm?

96
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:03,095
Perhaps the Aberration isn't as large
as we think.

97
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,640
GIDEON: <i>The temporal tremors originate
from Union Station in Chicago, Illinois,</i>

98
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,481
<i>October 17th, in the year 1927.</i>

99
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,020
That's fantastic.

100
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,856
I mean, I've always wanted to visit

101
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,024
the Roaring Twenties,
right in the middle of Prohibition.

102
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,569
That means no drinking, that's no good.

103
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,454
Well, actually, under Al Capone,
Chicago was a hotbed of vice.

104
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,832
There was illegal drinking,
gambling, prostitution...

105
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,243
Well then, let's fire up the tub
and get there.

106
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,663
Grab your fedoras.
We're going to the 1920s.

107
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,892
I can't believe we're here.

108
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,552
What are you so happy about?

109
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:49,271
When I was younger, I'd read my mother's
magazines and I'd see photos of Chicago.

110
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,981
I never thought I'd see it
with my own eyes.

111
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,864
Well, keep those eyes focused on
whatever's causing those temporal tremors.

112
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:57,732
DR. HEYWOOD: Copy that.

113
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,786
That's Eliot Ness!

114
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,165
He doesn't look like Kevin Costner.

115
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:13,669
What if somebody tipped off Capone
that Ness is a future threat?

116
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,717
Then his life's in danger.

117
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,628
Don't worry. I'm on it.

118
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:19,713
Here you go.

119
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,466
RAY: Oh!

120
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,302
Mr. Ness! Mr. Ness!

121
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,768
Hi, uh, you don't know me,
my name's Ray Palmer.

122
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,604
I have reason to believe that your life
may be in danger.

123
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,063
It'd be best if you came with me.

124
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,854
Mr. Ness,
I'm Sergeant Jones with Chicago PD.

125
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,240
We're your security detail on the way
to the Bureau.

126
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,529
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Palmer,
but it looks like I'm in good hands.

127
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,281
Okay.

128
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,043
- What just happened?
- Well, it's the strangest thing.

129
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:54,415
Uh, two cops just escorted
Eliot Ness to the Bureau.

130
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,586
They're not escorting him to the Bureau,
they're gonna throw him in the river.

131
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,672
- What?
- Ray,

132
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,893
1920s Chicago PD was the most
corrupt police force in history.

133
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,224
Almost all of them were on
Capone's payroll.

134
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,565
Did you or did you not see
<i>The Untouchables?</i>

135
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,108
Jax, Stein,

136
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,268
<i>I need you to intercept Eliot Ness.</i>

137
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,938
<i>He's being escorted
by two police officers.</i>

138
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,242
Grey! Didn't you hear Sara?

139
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,452
- No.
- Oh!

140
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,549
Oh, hey! Hey! Hey!

141
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,712
SARA: <i>What the hell happened back there?</i>

142
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,175
How come you didn't stop him?

143
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:46,012
- I'm sorry, I got distracted.
<i>- By what?</i>

144
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,844
- Tell her, Grey.
- It's not the Professor's fault.

145
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,933
Ray let Ness walk right
into Capone's hands.

146
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,229
They were police officers.

147
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,063
And who's to say they didn't take him
to the FBI like they said they would?

148
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,812
Gideon, pull up the Chicago Chronicle,
October 24th, 1931.

149
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,574
<i>Ah, yes, the day Al Capone originally
went down for tax evasion.</i>

150
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:03,949
<i>Only in this version of history,</i>

151
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,077
<i>he becomes something
far worse than a criminal,</i>

152
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,613
<i>he becomes a politician.</i>

153
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,873
Al Capone becomes mayor?

154
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,834
Okay. I take it back.
Ness probably is screwed.

155
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,462
Well, let's find out where they took him
so we can un-screw him

156
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,248
before this happens.

157
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,257
Special Agent Ness,
you're having a hell of a first day.

158
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,183
How do you know who I am

159
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,469
and when I was coming to town?

160
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,933
Some new friends of mine,

161
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,439
they whispered in my ear.

162
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,601
So me and the boys decided
we would get you a nice welcome present.

163
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,144
Cement galoshes,

164
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,108
very popular in Chicago these days.

165
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,482
<i>I have a feeling these will be
just your size.</i>

166
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,280
<i>Oh, come on, try them on.</i>

167
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,446
Any luck finding Ness?

168
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,453
By the time you find Ness,
he'll be swimming with the fishes.

169
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,877
Mick, you beautiful genius, that's it.

170
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,788
About time someone noticed.

171
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:01,504
Gideon, set the course to
shipping harbor, Dock 39.

172
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,213
What makes you so sure he'll be there?

173
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,550
In the 20s, Dock 39 is where Capone
brought all of his enemies and

174
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,136
tied cinder blocks to their feet
and tossed them in the harbor.

175
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,301
It became known as "Cadaver's Cove."

176
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,481
This isn't personal. I'm a businessman

177
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,487
and the Feds,
well, they're bad for business.

178
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,399
The Bureau of Investigation will
never stop fighting,

179
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,151
not until the fight is done.

180
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,829
Poetic.

181
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,660
I hope you wrote that down somewhere.

182
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,324
Welcome to Chicago, Mr. Ness.

183
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,047
HEAT WAVE: All this for some booze?

184
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,671
- I like it!
- CAPONE: Nice get-ups!

185
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,508
Seems our new friends have
got some friends of their own.

186
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,009
Get 'em boys.

187
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,906
I'm going after Capone!

188
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,370
Let 'em go, we've got Ness.

189
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,365
HEAT WAVE: Is he dead?

190
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,746
Unconscious, he took in a lot of water.

191
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,379
Merlyn was right, they took the bait.

192
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,723
GIDEON: <i>Special Agent Ness has suffered
severe hypoxia.</i>

193
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,388
<i>It will take some time
to reverse his brain damage.</i>

194
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,561
You can undo brain damage?

195
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,267
Why haven't you helped Rory out?

196
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,605
GIDEON: <i>Who says I haven't?</i>

197
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,736
All right, let's get serious.

198
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:50,613
Obviously, Capone somehow knew that Ness
would be the one to take him down.

199
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:53,616
When we were at the docks, Capone said
something about having "new friends."

200
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:57,078
We have a bigger problem.
I mean another problem.

201
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,334
This week, Ness and his team are
supposed to obtain.

202
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,960
Capone's ledger from his bookkeeper.

203
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,292
Now, the IRS' case against Capone

204
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,253
for tax evasion is completely
dependent on that ledger.

205
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,920
Which Ness can't grab while
he's lying here with brain damage.

206
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:13,465
Exactly, which means one of us has
to take his place.

207
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,141
RORY: That's a stupid idea.

208
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,599
It's pre-internet.
Nobody knows what Ness looks like.

209
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,263
Nate's right. I got this.

210
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,144
Actually, I was thinking I got this.

211
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:25,607
Well, yeah, I mean, if the mission was
impersonating Brad Pitt, you'd be the man.

212
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,988
But I think we can all agree, if anyone
here looks like a G-man here, it's me.

213
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:32,617
Well, we're in this situation because you
learned history from a movie.

214
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,277
All right, enough.

215
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:38,456
Ray, I'm sorry but Nate knows
more about this era than any of us.

216
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,075
What's the plan?

217
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,494
Okay, so if Capone's ledger is anywhere,

218
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,664
it's probably at his primary speakeasy,
The Chelsea Club.

219
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,674
So, Ray and I will go to the Bureau,
assemble Ness' team,

220
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,461
lead them to bust the place up,
grab the ledger.

221
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,130
Great, take Rory with you.

222
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,424
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

223
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,181
Does this face look like a cop to you?

224
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,936
If this were a JSA mission,

225
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,142
we'd probably also send someone
undercover at the club.

226
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,684
Well, I'm not doing that either.
I'm done playing dress-up.

227
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,851
SARA: Fine.

228
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,816
I'll go to the club with Jax and Stein,

229
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,653
and you can stay here, drink your beers
and watch over Ness.

230
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,364
- AMAYA: <i>What about me?</i>
- You can watch over him.

231
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,153
What?

232
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,830
SARA: Sorry!

233
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:23,868
Beer?

234
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,170
There he is.

235
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,965
- Special Agent Cole Bennett?
- Yes and you are?

236
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:36,306
Special Agent Eliot Ness,
this is my associate, Bob De Niro.

237
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,309
Well, I've assembled the team
your telegram specified, Mr. Ness.

238
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,849
I hope they're ready for some action
because they're going to get it.

239
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,855
Tonight, we're going to take down
The Chelsea Club.

240
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,517
Our files say Capone's got nothing
to do with that place.

241
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,812
Well, your files are
embarrassingly outdated.

242
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,026
We've learned Capone
has a stake in the club,

243
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:55,192
and furthermore, he hides a sizeable
amount of Canadian whiskey in there.

244
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:58,532
You fellas sure do know an impressive
amount about Capone's organization.

245
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,039
Well, let's just say we have
people on the inside.

246
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,542
This place is quite lively,

247
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,879
considering we haven't seen
a single bottle of alcohol.

248
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,219
But Nate said it was a speakeasy?

249
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,221
Yeah, that's why it's
called a "speakeasy."

250
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,553
You gotta know how to ask
for the good stuff.

251
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,263
Ah...

252
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:25,727
Excuse me, I'd like a club soda please.

253
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,224
One club soda coming up.

254
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,230
Here's what I wanna know,

255
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,814
why would somebody from the future
be interested in helping Al Capone?

256
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,403
Well, we're here to find out.

257
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,154
This is just a club soda.

258
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,044
You feeling all right?

259
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,662
Fine.

260
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,255
I guess I'm just surprised

261
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,758
you'd rather stay here on the ship
than be out there.

262
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,337
1920s Chicago seems
like your kind of town.

263
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,930
You know, when I was younger,

264
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,433
I always wanted to be a police officer.

265
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,683
I didn't care that I was a girl.
I just really wanted to wear a badge.

266
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:09,729
Cute. The bad guys
have all the fun, you know.

267
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,115
It doesn't look like you're having
much fun right now.

268
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,036
MAN: <i>Oh, how the mighty have fallen.</i>

269
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:32,960
RORY: <i>Leonard?</i>

270
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,714
- I must be losing my mind.
- SNART: <i>Of course you are.</i>

271
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,090
Why else would you still be here,
taking orders like a well-trained puppy?

272
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,802
You're not right in the head, Mick.
That's why I'm here.

273
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,804
To set you straight.

274
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,152
Ray, Nate, what's your status?

275
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,034
DR. HEYWOOD: <i>Be careful, we're coming in.
Don't get caught in our net.</i>

276
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,454
What are squares like you
doing in a place like this?

277
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,744
- You!
- Jefferson?

278
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,288
What the hell!

279
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,718
Jefferson, the speedster is here! Run!

280
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,261
Nobody move. Federal officers!

281
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,641
You're all under arrest for violations
of the Volstead Act!

282
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:34,063
- Man!
- Hey, take it easy, that's our inside guy.

283
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,319
Considering this club's
as dry as the Sahara,

284
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,071
I'd say you need a new inside guy,
Special Agent Ness.

285
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,231
Yeah.

286
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,117
What the hell is happening here?

287
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:47,076
Damien Darhk showed up, with
the speedster. They took Grey and Sara.

288
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,957
This whole Capone Aberration
was a distraction,

289
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,798
Darhk and his speedster pal knew
it would attract our attention.

290
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:04,347
But why kidnap Sara and Stein?
I mean, what could he want with them?

291
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,928
- Still trying to work that one out.
- Are you all right, Jax?

292
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,809
- I'm pissed.
- RORY: <i>Let it go, kid.</i>

293
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,354
There's nothing you can do
about the speedsters.

294
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,764
We'll see about that.

295
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:17,026
Long story short, Rip had a secret armory.

296
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,814
Me and Grey found it alongside future
Barry's message about the oncoming war.

297
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,904
This speedster killed Rex and
kidnapped our friends,

298
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,535
- we need him in the brig before dawn.
- Yeah.

299
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,822
If this weapon does what I think it does,

300
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,114
we'll stop him dead in his tracks.

301
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,624
Yeah. Well, that's all well and good,

302
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:35,002
but we still need to get Capone's ledger
back, otherwise history is screwed.

303
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,046
Since your last plan was a total bust,

304
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:39,583
I suggest somebody else
do the strategic thinking.

305
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:43,094
Let me guess, that's you. All right,
so let's hear your brilliant idea.

306
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,718
Well, I don't have one but it's going
to be better than yours.

307
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:47,882
RORY: Enough!

308
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,928
If you want to nail
Capone and Rex's killer,

309
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,937
you can't do it by playing a Boy Scout
or a historian or a policeman.

310
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,691
We do this my way.

311
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,940
Like a criminal.

312
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,448
Yes.

313
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,786
The Ritz Carlton, it is definitely not.

314
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,294
How did we get here?

315
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,876
It appears our speedster friend
got the better of us.

316
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,417
- And he wasn't working alone.
- Yes.

317
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,673
Damien Darhk, a rather

318
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,588
predictable bedfellow for Al Capone.

319
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,810
And don't forget about me.
It's been a long time, Sara.

320
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,685
You look good for someone
who's come back from the dead.

321
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:41,102
Why am I not surprised that you
and Damien Darhk would find each other?

322
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,521
What do you want with us?

323
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,197
You have something we need.

324
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,530
And while my partners think
I'm a fool for trying,

325
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,657
I would like to broker a deal with you.

326
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,622
You have in your possession an amulet.

327
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:55,992
Give it to me

328
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,454
and I will give you nine years
of your life back.

329
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,130
What are you talking about?

330
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,007
Oh, maybe Oliver didn't tell you,

331
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,712
but I was the one who arranged to
blow up the Queen's Gambit.

332
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,680
That was the day everything
changed for you, Sara,

333
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,765
hundreds of dominoes toppling.

334
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,687
<i>Dr. Ivo,</i>

335
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,190
Slade Wilson, the League of Assassins.

336
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,943
Losing your sister.

337
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,812
And you losing your son.

338
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,196
We both get clean slates.

339
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,825
Why don't you just ask your
speedster-friend to take you back in time?

340
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,495
Because Malcolm's just his errand boy,

341
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,618
sent to retrieve the amulet.

342
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,292
- Why is it so important?
- What does it matter?

343
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,706
I'm giving you and your sister a chance
to live normal lives.

344
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,216
To go back, maybe go to college,

345
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:49,299
meet a nice boy or a girl and settle down.

346
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,213
No, thank you.

347
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,549
I was never meant for those things.

348
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,726
And I know that now.

349
00:18:56,552 --> 00:19:00,227
And besides, you can't just go back
and change things like that.

350
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,767
What? Why not?

351
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,732
Because time is sacred

352
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,981
and it can't be changed to suit
any one person's desire

353
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,446
without harming the lives
of countless others.

354
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,071
But you wouldn't remember any of this,
would you?

355
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:19,083
You would be blissfully unaware
of time travel,

356
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:23,083
of loss, of heartbreak.

357
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:27,967
You'd be happy. And isn't that what
matters most in the end?

358
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,343
SARA: <i>Hey, Malcolm!</i>

359
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:38,512
I'll take a nightmare that's real
over a dream that's a lie.

360
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,439
That was remarkably selfless.

361
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,446
Well, I had a good teacher.

362
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,445
Yes. Captain Hunter.

363
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:53,984
No.

364
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,121
I was talking about you.

365
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,467
What the hell?

366
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,467
Shoot her!

367
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,475
MAN: Come on. Let's get out of here.

368
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,647
Hi, I'm Clyde, that's Bonnie.

369
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,981
Get out of the truck!

370
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,322
Do you have any idea
who you're stealing from?

371
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,782
Yes, where's the truck headed?

372
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,705
Uh, 31st and Fort Dearborn Drive.

373
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:40,990
Much obliged.

374
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,709
Hold that.

375
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,544
Aren't you forgetting something?

376
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:49,958
Nate and Ray?

377
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,501
Those idiots have done nothing
but get in the way.

378
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,636
Uh, guys, we're standing right here.

379
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,515
Whoa. Get in the back.

380
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,681
I can't believe Malcolm thought
I would actually take that deal.

381
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,728
You really weren't tempted?

382
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,483
Of course.

383
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:11,028
But we can't let a man like that
change history.

384
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,397
Imagine the havoc that it would cause.

385
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:18,495
Ah, yes, when it comes to time travel,
even the best of us can wreak havoc.

386
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,492
What do you mean?

387
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:22,990
Martin?

388
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:27,670
You have been acting weird
ever since we fought the Dominators.

389
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,747
<i>What's going on?</i>

390
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,417
It was an innocent mistake.

391
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,717
I was just trying to give myself
a bit of marital advice.

392
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,632
Never did I imagine
it would ever have an effect.

393
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,893
You caused an Aberration?

394
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,930
I have a daughter.

395
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:47,894
A what?

396
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,106
A full-grown,

397
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,396
human progeny

398
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,739
who I never even knew I had!

399
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,741
This beautiful, brilliant...

400
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,072
And not real.

401
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,579
At first, no, but

402
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,406
then I remembered.

403
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,917
I remembered the countless nights I spent,

404
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:10,998
pacing the neighborhood with her
stroller trying to get her to sleep.

405
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,090
The way my heart

406
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:16,423
melted the first time she smiled at me.

407
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,763
The distress she caused
her kindergarten teacher,

408
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:24,602
when she insisted on singing the
periodic table instead of the alphabet.

409
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,767
I remembered all of it.

410
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,267
- But none of that happened to you.
- But the memories

411
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,395
are real.

412
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:36,113
They're a part of me now.

413
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:39,776
She is a part of me now.

414
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,117
And I love her.

415
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,286
Martin, you were the one who talked me
into not killing Damien Darhk.

416
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:53,456
And to not bringing my sister back because
of the damage it would do to history.

417
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:57,961
I'm sorry
but my ears were burning.

418
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,052
I understand Malcolm tried to play nice

419
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,805
and offer you a deal.

420
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,513
Since you didn't bite, we're gonna have
to be a little rougher.

421
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,981
Do your worst.

422
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:14,026
You didn't think that I meant you?

423
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:18,364
Oh, I fear with your League training,
torture, while fun,

424
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,900
would be a waste of time.

425
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,240
Sara,

426
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,161
whatever you do, don't give them anything!

427
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,045
- No!
- Martin!

428
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,665
<i>Martin!</i>

429
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,012
Professor Stein. Am I right?

430
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,851
Do I know you?

431
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:55,185
Let's just say it's complicated.

432
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:01,032
I'm not going to lie to you,
this, um, little toy

433
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,911
usually leaves the subject,
well, dead, but

434
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:08,949
I've adjusted it so that
you should only feel a little pain.

435
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:11,959
In theory.

436
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,103
You're not the regular driver.
What happened to Vinny?

437
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:34,269
Vinny, he's, uh,
hanging out with your mother.

438
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:35,607
- What?
- What?

439
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,145
So, here's the plan...

440
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,740
Is for us to rescue the people
that got caught because of you.

441
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,866
- She's talking about you.
- No, I think she's talking about you.

442
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,032
Shut up! You're supposed to be partners!

443
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,035
- Partners have each others' backs.
- All right, Mick's right.

444
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,950
We can all agree
that we need to get Capone's ledger. Fair?

445
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,368
Agreed.

446
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,801
AMAYA: <i>Sara?</i>

447
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,684
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, we need to find Stein.

448
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,568
You know,
for a homicidal gangster,

449
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,199
Capone was very organized

450
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,034
and he had exquisite penmanship.

451
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,334
- Check it out.
- Is that it?

452
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,414
Bingo! Let's go.

453
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,798
- Watch where you point that thing.
- Snart!

454
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:52,639
You shouldn't be here, Mick.
Capone's men might be from 1927,

455
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,895
but their bullets work just fine.

456
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,933
Do you really wanna risk your life
for a skirt and a geezer?

457
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,269
- AMAYA: <i>Any sign of the Professor?</i>
- Not yet.

458
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:05,527
Oh, sounds like a sweet little angel
whispering in your ear.

459
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:08,359
Problem is, angels always want you
to do the right thing.

460
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,074
And doing the right thing gets you killed.

461
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:12,738
I should know.

462
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,825
You want to stay alive,
best listen to the devil.

463
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,751
Get out now.

464
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,380
Too late.

465
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,254
Hey, you found them!

466
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,793
- You guys okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

467
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,340
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.

468
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,012
Oh. On!

469
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,642
Oh, my God. You're Al Capone.

470
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,849
- That's Scarface.
- I don't think he likes that nickname.

471
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,515
I don't like when people try and steal
what's mine.

472
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,019
How do you think it makes me feel seeing
all you thieves on my property?

473
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,237
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say,
"Not good."

474
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,856
See, the doctor used to
give me these pills,

475
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,741
said it would help calm me down.

476
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:54,155
Then one day, I realized the only thing
that makes me feel any better is killing.

477
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,698
Time for some therapy.

478
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,047
Oh.

479
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:09,503
- Thanks, buddy.
- Yeah.

480
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,260
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

481
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,491
How'd I do?

482
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,698
You totally sold it, Al.

483
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:35,575
<i>I thought so.</i>

484
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:38,495
You sure Mr. Thawne ain't gonna be
mad 'cause we let 'em go?

485
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:39,908
Oh.

486
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,369
Quite the opposite.

487
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:54,219
Hey, Grey, Grey,
you're safe now, it's okay.

488
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,553
- Grey.
- What?

489
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:56,888
- Grey?
- Oh...

490
00:27:57,176 --> 00:28:01,306
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
I'm a little discombobulated.

491
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,856
Whoo! Well, that was close!

492
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,393
But a win's a win
and we got the team back together.

493
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,812
Well, technically you and Rory
got the team back together.

494
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,322
And we got the ledger. Bro hug?

495
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:11,690
Do it!

496
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,825
Okay, I think this is all
a little premature.

497
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,486
We still don't have an ID
on the speedster.

498
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:19,247
Who has now added Malcolm Merlyn
to his team of time-traveling psychos.

499
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,330
And he wanted the amulet that
I took off of Darhk in 1987.

500
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,587
What would someone with a speedster's
powers want with ancient artifacts?

501
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:29,046
Perhaps I should take
a look at the amulet.

502
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,093
I may be able to unlock
some of its mysteries.

503
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,754
All right.

504
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:48,485
Uh, so you didn't get a chance to kill
your boyfriend's killer, huh?

505
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,152
It's not vengeance I'm after, Mick.

506
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,150
Jfsjusfice.
- Right!

507
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:58,654
Right, well, for what it's worth,
you looked good tonight.

508
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,663
Being a bad guy suits you.

509
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,168
Thank you.

510
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:13,344
Um, I'm hungry.

511
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:21,014
What's next, Mick? Long walks
on the beach, just the two of you?

512
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,678
For a figment of my imagination,

513
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,938
you're really beginning
to be a pain in my ass.

514
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:28,522
Look, I get it. She's easy on the eyes,
tough in a fight.

515
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,312
She's just a friend,
the one friend I have.

516
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,947
Since my last friend blew himself up.

517
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:37,280
- Care for a little advice?
- From a dead guy? No.

518
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,159
Don't let the new girl rope you
into her death wish.

519
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:46,164
This whole "sacrificing yourself for your
friends" thing isn't as fun as it sounds.

520
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:48,708
<i>Trust me.</i>

521
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:06,684
What the hell?

522
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:12,061
Sara, stay out of the library.

523
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,326
<i>How you feeling?</i>

524
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:22,245
I'm all right.

525
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,248
Look, I know you've
been through a lot, but

526
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:28,373
we really need to talk
about the Aberration that you caused.

527
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,210
Perhaps another time.

528
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,086
<i>What were you doing in here anyways?</i>

529
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:40,552
- Righty tighty, lefty loosy.
- I speak six languages, why would I...

530
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:42,091
Stein's about to kill Sara in the library!

531
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:45,060
- With the rope or the candlestick?
- Guys, I'm serious.

532
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,220
Somehow the speedster's
disguised himself <i>as</i> Stein

533
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,559
and he's turning over the whole ship!

534
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:50,770
- I'll suit up.
- And I'll get Sara away from fake Stein.

535
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,934
- What about that speedster gun?
- I'm already on it!

536
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:57,774
Martin, you've been acting pretty
different ever since Darhk tortured you.

537
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,780
Did they offer you a deal,
like they did me?

538
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:04,121
"Help us and we won't hurt your daughter"?

539
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,451
My daughter?

540
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:10,252
Sara, uh, Jax and I were just
on the bridge and, um...

541
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:13,122
He wants to talk to you about ship stuff.

542
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,382
- "Ship stuff"?
- Yeah.

543
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:17,834
Okay.

544
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:21,764
I'm sure there's no need to rush off.
Jax can wait.

545
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:23,841
Since when do you call him "Jax"?

546
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,601
Actually, it's pretty urgent
and we should go now.

547
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,303
Okay.

548
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,336
A speedster weapon. Impressive.

549
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,178
Unfortunately, for you,
the effects are only temporary.

550
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,805
What did you do with Stein?

551
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,675
Oh, I wouldn't waste my energy
worrying about him right now.

552
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,644
Whatever you're gonna do, do it now.

553
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,396
In a rush to die, are we?

554
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,640
I wasn't talking to you.

555
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,398
He's headed towards the bridge,
come on.

556
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:23,742
No, no, no, no, no.

557
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,196
What the hell is he doing in there?

558
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:29,202
GIDEON: <i>Cloaking shield disengaged.</i>

559
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,365
That's not good.

560
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,375
<i>Cargo bay door now opening.</i>

561
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,419
That is definitely not good.

562
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,209
Tear the ship apart,
kill anyone you find.

563
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,145
The speedster just locked himself
inside the bridge.

564
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,563
Great, so we've got him trapped.

565
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:55,315
Call me an optimist.

566
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,230
And by the sound of it,
he's letting his buddies onto the ship.

567
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,407
Guys! Could use a little help here.

568
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,460
Okay, Nate and I
will help Sara hold them off.

569
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,587
- I'll guard Ness.
- What about the speedster?

570
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:20,757
Well, he's after the amulet so all we have
to do is just keep him in the bridge...

571
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,802
What are you doing?
Capone's men are taking over the ship!

572
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,265
We got bigger fish to fry, honey.

573
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,438
Rex's killer.

574
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,269
He's tossing the ship.
He is looking for the amulet.

575
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,821
It's only going to be a matter of time
before he finds it.

576
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,652
Then how do we stop him?

577
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,617
- What would a criminal do?
- Run.

578
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,663
Steel up!

579
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,003
Isn't that just like a thug?

580
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,510
Who brings a Tommy gun to
an ion-blaster fight?

581
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:10,515
Ah, yeah.

582
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,975
Hey, I stole that fair and square!

583
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:19,558
This belongs to me.

584
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,147
Surprise!

585
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,745
The League taught you well.

586
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,170
But unless you hand over the amulet,

587
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,502
I'm going to have to teach you
a few new lessons.

588
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:46,168
Those who cannot do, teach.

589
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,273
I remember you.

590
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:13,491
You're here because I killed
that moronic leader of the JSA.

591
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,619
Mr. Rex Tyler, was it?

592
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:38,595
Don't worry.
You'll be joining Mr. Tyler soon enough.

593
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:43,975
Lucky girl!

594
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,025
I gave you an out.

595
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,528
Not just a chance to survive,
but to live a better life.

596
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:58,832
I've already found a better life,
one without you in it.

597
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:11,470
- What about your friend, Martin Stein?
- Where is he?

598
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,015
My dear, that information comes at a cost.

599
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,943
Don't look so glum, Professor.

600
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:30,606
You'll be in good company at the bottom
of this here river.

601
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:33,943
Thieves, snitches, do-gooder cops. They've

602
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:37,119
all run afoul of my organization, but you!

603
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,364
I've never had to whack
a professor before.

604
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,200
Guess I'm moving up
in the world, eh, boys?

605
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,131
The speedster,
how did you manage to defeat him?

606
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:57,974
I didn't, I made him a counter-offer.

607
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,312
I gave him the amulet.

608
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,644
I still don't understand. The last thing
I remember was getting off the train.

609
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,187
Everything else is a blur.

610
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,980
I wouldn't worry about that, Mr. Ness.

611
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:15,822
After our investigation, we concluded
you were kidnapped by an imposter.

612
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:19,909
Some idiot posing as you,
trying to bring down Capone.

613
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:23,200
The gentleman who was impersonating you
was trying to do the right thing.

614
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,915
Luckily, he found some useful information.

615
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,078
What's this?

616
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,247
Everything you need to know
to take down Capone.

617
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:33,093
If you look closely, you'll find some
discrepancies in his bookkeeping.

618
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:38,014
You expect me to believe that Al Capone
is gonna be taken down by tax evasion?

619
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,679
Sounds screwy.

620
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,561
Actually, it'll make
a pretty good movie one day.

621
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,564
You know, if this is the week
the Feds get Capone's ledger,

622
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,903
why does it take four more years
for them to take him down?

623
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,027
Because it's the federal government.

624
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:06,121
Now, that's the Mick Rory I remember,
always thinking with his stomach.

625
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,410
Shut up!

626
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,624
Who are you talking to?

627
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,414
Nobody.

628
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,046
Anyway, I thought I'd find you in here.

629
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,390
- That speedster hit you pretty hard, huh?
- I got a thick head.

630
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:24,265
- What's that?
- A little present.

631
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:28,853
For keeping me alive and for helping me
almost get Rex's killer.

632
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,142
Open it.

633
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:37,407
I lifted it back at Capone's warehouse.

634
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:39,859
You stole it, huh?

635
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,660
You were right.
The bad guys really do have more fun.

636
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:48,206
Not that you're a bad guy.

637
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,712
I hope it was worth it.

638
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:55,884
All this for a kiss on the cheek
and a cheap bottle of booze.

639
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,799
That speedster could have
killed you, Mick.

640
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:00,880
What then?

641
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:04,555
I'd be dead like you.

642
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:13,102
My evil doppelgänger left
quite a mess.

643
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:15,521
It will take me weeks
to reorganize my notes.

644
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,190
It's good to have you back. The real you.

645
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,154
Well, thanks to your efforts.

646
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,620
Though I have to say I am a bit puzzled.

647
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,663
Professor Stein, puzzled?

648
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:28,826
Protecting history is our
team's raison d'être.

649
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:32,166
Yet you traded the amulet to our enemies.

650
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,798
A choice which will no doubt
have countless repercussions on history.

651
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,501
I'm starting to think that

652
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:40,462
maybe some things are
more important than history.

653
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,011
You know, you, me and this team,

654
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,054
we're a family.

655
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:49,187
A messed up one but still a family.

656
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:54,609
I might not be able to save Laurel
but I can protect this family.

657
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,562
And that includes yours.

658
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,610
What's her name?

659
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:03,784
Lily.

660
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,904
Lily.

661
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:07,997
It's a beautiful name.

662
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,409
We should leave soon.

663
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:14,455
You're certainly in a hurry
to get out of 1927.

664
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:17,966
Not your concern, Malcolm, particularly
now that we have what we came for.

665
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,467
Well, now that we have the matching set,

666
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,503
do you care to tell us why we went through
so much trouble?

667
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:26,140
They are not a matching set.
In fact, they are not a "they."

668
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,801
They are an "it."

669
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,514
It's an amulet, in two pieces.

670
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,472
I knew that you were more than
just a pretty face, Malcolm.

671
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:40,234
Wow. It's a portable planetarium.

672
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,402
It's a compass.

673
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:44,777
Compasses generally find things.

674
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:45,944
Indeed.

675
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,489
Have either of you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

676
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:53,286
Yes, It was the spear that was reportedly
used to penetrate the side of Christ,

677
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,703
after he died on the cross.

678
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:58,749
And now it can be used to rewrite
reality itself.

679
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:02,336
- So how do we find it?
- Well, it's complicated.

680
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:06,840
But the first step is with the person
that Mr. Darhk met briefly in New York.

681
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,008
You remember Captain Rip Hunter?

682
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,897
Rip Hunter, stop where you are!

683
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,441
RIP: Cut!

684
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:31,699
I told you idiots to move
these garbage cans.

685
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,038
Can we try

686
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,587
to get this right, people?

687
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,123
I don't wanna be here all night.

688
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,972
Am I talking to myself? Today!
