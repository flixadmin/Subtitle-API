1
00:00:16,034 --> 00:00:17,642
Well, I'm...
I'm conflicted about this.

2
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:19,385
I'm not gonna lie to you.

3
00:00:19,462 --> 00:00:21,721
I'm a police officer, duly sworn.

4
00:00:21,798 --> 00:00:25,317
I don't condone vigilantes or vigilantism.

5
00:00:27,846 --> 00:00:30,396
Once people start taking the law
into their own hands,

6
00:00:30,473 --> 00:00:32,365
you're on the road to anarchy.

7
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:37,654
But there's worse things
out there than anarchy,

8
00:00:37,664 --> 00:00:41,407
and sometimes, as much
as I hate to admit it,

9
00:00:41,484 --> 00:00:43,919
the police aren't enough
to deal with it all.

10
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:57,430
<font color="#00FFFF">Synced & corrected by</font> <font color="#D81D1D">MaxPayne</font>

11
00:01:02,505 --> 00:01:08,101
"Emerald Archer:
The hood and the rise of vigilantism."

12
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:42,343
Look, Star City is
a very dangerous place.

13
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,056
If it wasn't, my brother Tommy
would still be alive,

14
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:49,526
my mother would still be alive.

15
00:01:51,905 --> 00:01:55,690
If the police can't protect the people,

16
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:58,618
then the people need to learn
how to protect themselves.

17
00:02:01,898 --> 00:02:04,490
Vigilantes?

18
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:06,701
No, they're... they're hypocrites.

19
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:11,089
They think that they're upholding the law,
but they're breaking the law.

20
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,875
They're not heroes.
They're criminals.

21
00:02:13,952 --> 00:02:18,430
The only difference between me and them
is that I'm smart enough to realize

22
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:22,517
that the only person worth
looking out for is yourself.

23
00:02:26,589 --> 00:02:31,234
I've lost a lot, most recently, my dad.

24
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,615
The world needs a protector,
someone to keep it safe.

25
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:39,451
And it doesn't matter
if someone's wearing a mask.

26
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:44,831
All that matters is no one should have
to lose their family or anyone they love.

27
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:50,787
Villains or vigilantes?

28
00:02:50,863 --> 00:02:53,798
Criminals or heroes?

29
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:57,251
From Star City to Central City
to Gotham City,

30
00:02:57,328 --> 00:02:59,545
Americans have debated this question.

31
00:02:59,556 --> 00:03:02,131
Do the ends justify the means?

32
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:07,145
Does the law have to be broken
to uphold it?

33
00:03:07,222 --> 00:03:10,765
Hyah! Uh! Hyah...

34
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:12,934
- Whoa. Did you get that?
- Go! Go! Go...

35
00:03:13,011 --> 00:03:14,936
Hey! Hey, you're
not supposed to be here!

36
00:03:15,013 --> 00:03:18,356
In December 2018,
the Star City police department

37
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:22,777
answered that question definitively when
they officially deputized Oliver Queen,

38
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:24,904
the vigilante known as
the Green Arrow.

39
00:03:24,981 --> 00:03:26,948
Drop the gun, Max!

40
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:34,122
Sin, voice-over: I knew
them back in the day.

41
00:03:34,198 --> 00:03:37,583
Canary, the arrow,
the whole crew.

42
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,587
Honestly, I don't know where
I'd be right now without them.

43
00:03:41,664 --> 00:03:44,966
They helped me out of
a couple pretty tight spots.

44
00:03:45,043 --> 00:03:47,969
I owe them a lot.

45
00:03:48,046 --> 00:03:50,522
But I, uh, I saw the toll
that it took on them.

46
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:53,692
Like, people like to debate
about the legalities,

47
00:03:53,768 --> 00:03:55,601
but for the people wearing the masks,

48
00:03:55,678 --> 00:04:00,314
it's... it's not philosophical, it's real.

49
00:04:03,853 --> 00:04:06,195
And it takes everything from them.

50
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:08,373
It absolutely takes a toll.

51
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,949
I have been doing this in Star City

52
00:04:10,026 --> 00:04:11,617
for a really long time, you know?

53
00:04:11,694 --> 00:04:14,203
Nearly... nearly 7 years,
but before that,

54
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,456
I... I was running
all around the world

55
00:04:16,532 --> 00:04:20,218
with a hood on, trying to make
things right, and...

56
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,131
Now my life has...
It's never been better.

57
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,008
I'm... I'm...

58
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:29,635
I don't have to wear
a mask anymore.

59
00:04:29,712 --> 00:04:32,430
And that really makes
all the difference.

60
00:04:32,507 --> 00:04:36,067
I'm... I'm doing what I think
I'm supposed to be doing

61
00:04:36,144 --> 00:04:38,227
in the light of day.

62
00:04:38,238 --> 00:04:41,230
And if I could've, I would've
done it this way from the start.

63
00:04:42,484 --> 00:04:44,233
Surprise.

64
00:04:44,244 --> 00:04:47,746
Hey. One minute, please?

65
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:50,907
Hey. Hey. Come here.

66
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:52,700
Hey, buddy. Hey.

67
00:04:52,777 --> 00:04:54,419
Kiddo, how are you?

68
00:04:54,496 --> 00:04:56,871
I think I've grown out of "kiddo."

69
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:58,664
Yeah. Ok.
All right.

70
00:04:58,741 --> 00:05:00,416
Well, who gave you
permission to grow so tall?

71
00:05:00,427 --> 00:05:01,876
My god.

72
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:03,586
You must be so excited to be done...
midterms.

73
00:05:03,597 --> 00:05:06,598
You finally come home
and relax, you know...

74
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:08,257
What's this?

75
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:12,011
Oh, right. Uh, Ms. Pedowitz is
doing a documentary on vigilantes,

76
00:05:12,088 --> 00:05:15,681
and the SCPD and I thought
it might be a way to, uh,

77
00:05:15,758 --> 00:05:17,892
improve public opinion
on the work I'm doing.

78
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:21,062
I've been collecting
interviews for years and, frankly,

79
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:24,190
I couldn't get the funding I needed to
finish it until your dad went public.

80
00:05:24,267 --> 00:05:25,775
Well, the timing is perfect.

81
00:05:25,786 --> 00:05:27,276
I mean, what with
you working with the SCPD

82
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:29,737
and, you know, um, heh,
full transparency.

83
00:05:29,814 --> 00:05:31,280
But this isn't gonna
be in the film, right?

84
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,615
We can...

85
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:34,459
We need all of this edited out.

86
00:05:34,536 --> 00:05:36,461
I don't want my son on camera.

87
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:39,080
Oh, uh, ok.
Guys, cut, please.

88
00:05:39,157 --> 00:05:40,215
Ok. Mark.

89
00:05:46,807 --> 00:05:48,756
You know, I kind of
hate the word "vigilante."

90
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:50,934
It just feels like

91
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,719
such a... disrespectful term.

92
00:05:53,796 --> 00:05:57,932
Call them what they are... heroes.

93
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:01,102
What? Oliver Queen?
No, that's ridiculous.

94
00:06:01,179 --> 00:06:04,105
Look, first of all, Oliver Queen
doesn't even know Adam hunt.

95
00:06:04,182 --> 00:06:05,815
And even if he did, what do you
think he did...

96
00:06:05,826 --> 00:06:07,316
Slip out of his own
welcome home party

97
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:08,943
to become Robin hood?

98
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:11,830
I missed Tequila!

99
00:06:13,024 --> 00:06:17,326
Ha ha! No, look, you don't
become successful in my line of work

100
00:06:17,337 --> 00:06:19,745
without being really good
at sizing people up.

101
00:06:19,822 --> 00:06:23,133
Trust me.
Oliver Queen is no one's hero.

102
00:06:27,347 --> 00:06:30,682
Obviously, this particular
comment didn't age too well.

103
00:06:36,422 --> 00:06:40,850
Truth is, Oliver is not
the same man he was 7 years ago.

104
00:06:40,861 --> 00:06:47,857
He's changed, grown not just
as a hero but as a person.

105
00:06:47,868 --> 00:06:49,442
You really expect me
to believe you're the arrow?

106
00:06:49,518 --> 00:06:51,194
I am the arrow.

107
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:53,538
Oliver Queen isn't the arrow.

108
00:06:53,615 --> 00:06:57,158
Quentin, voice-over: Heh! Ok, I'll bite.
Why?

109
00:06:57,235 --> 00:06:58,868
Because starling city needs

110
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,545
what you can't give it...

111
00:07:00,622 --> 00:07:02,714
Hope.

112
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,125
Well, he fights for justice,
and he cares about the city,

113
00:07:06,202 --> 00:07:08,553
which is no different than
any other officer here,

114
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,379
as far as I'm concerned.

115
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:16,010
He just dresses in green leather and
runs around with a bow and arrow.

116
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:18,387
Which sounded a lot better in my head.

117
00:07:18,398 --> 00:07:21,566
Can we, uh, can we...
Can we do that again?

118
00:07:21,643 --> 00:07:23,392
There have been two murders in the
past week that strike me as odd.

119
00:07:23,403 --> 00:07:24,736
Throats slit on both of them.

120
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:27,730
We should cross-reference the
victimology with any open cases.

121
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:29,199
Way ahead of you.

122
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:35,821
Uh, working for the police is different.

123
00:07:35,898 --> 00:07:37,582
I always thought I was
gonna work on my own,

124
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:42,411
or that was the plan...
"My crusade is my crusade."

125
00:07:42,422 --> 00:07:44,872
But, you know, life doesn't
work out that way.

126
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:46,841
Next thing I know, I'm leading a team.

127
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:53,047
I'm not...
I'm not entirely sure

128
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:54,724
I'm meant to be a leader.

129
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,603
Made a lot of mistakes.

130
00:08:00,965 --> 00:08:02,014
Here they come.
Rolling.

131
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:03,516
Shots fired at the parking garage

132
00:08:03,592 --> 00:08:05,059
on nutter and winter.

133
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:07,061
Possible vigilante sighting.

134
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:11,565
And vigilantes are still
illegal in Star City.

135
00:08:15,455 --> 00:08:17,238
Captain Drake, are we clear?

136
00:08:17,315 --> 00:08:19,073
Clear. Establish a perimeter.

137
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,574
Is this a false report?

138
00:08:20,651 --> 00:08:22,868
I think it's more that we're just too late.

139
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:27,873
Go.

140
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,875
Rene...

141
00:08:29,952 --> 00:08:31,252
I need a bus at nutter and winter!

142
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:32,637
Officer down!

143
00:08:32,714 --> 00:08:34,213
They respond faster that way.

144
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,465
Medics are on the way, buddy.
It's gonna be ok.

145
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:38,134
I'm fine.
I got a vest on.

146
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:39,885
Just got the wind knocked out of me.
But they took...

147
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:43,222
Who'd they take?

148
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:45,558
The new Green Arrow.

149
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:47,268
Who's he talking about?

150
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:48,894
I don't know.
Just stay on them.

151
00:08:48,971 --> 00:08:50,280
Hey, turn that off...

152
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,740
I told you to turn those cameras off.

153
00:08:57,817 --> 00:09:00,785
You promised me full access.

154
00:09:00,862 --> 00:09:03,788
Hey! Keep rolling.
Follow him.

155
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,790
What do you think
you were doing out there?

156
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:07,333
Same thing you do.

157
00:09:07,344 --> 00:09:08,510
I'm doing good, by the way.

158
00:09:08,586 --> 00:09:09,961
Thank you for asking.

159
00:09:10,037 --> 00:09:11,420
I'm glad you're ok.

160
00:09:11,497 --> 00:09:13,181
I'm glad the FBI made
your immunity permanent,

161
00:09:13,258 --> 00:09:15,007
but being a vigilante
is illegal in Star City.

162
00:09:15,018 --> 00:09:16,801
Well, that's easy for you to say.

163
00:09:16,878 --> 00:09:19,428
I mean, you have a cute, shiny new badge.

164
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:21,764
Thought about giving one to anyone else?

165
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:23,766
First step would probably
be not being so reckless.

166
00:09:23,777 --> 00:09:25,434
- You or me?
- Try to guess.

167
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:28,020
I nearly lost my job
giving Oliver a badge,

168
00:09:28,031 --> 00:09:30,356
and Pollard is still looking
for ways to take it from him.

169
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,983
You said they took
the new Green Arrow.

170
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:33,985
What happened out there?

171
00:09:34,061 --> 00:09:36,279
We were handling a routine drug bust.

172
00:09:36,355 --> 00:09:37,705
I'm sorry, Rene.

173
00:09:37,782 --> 00:09:39,282
Are you still working with
the new Green Arrow?

174
00:09:39,358 --> 00:09:40,491
Because I'm pretty sure
we've been over this.

175
00:09:40,568 --> 00:09:42,210
Not for nothing, but crime stats

176
00:09:42,287 --> 00:09:44,212
have skyrocketed ever since

177
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:45,830
we've hung up our masks,

178
00:09:45,907 --> 00:09:47,832
and they've gone down
ever since nga showed up.

179
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:49,458
Oh, we need to come up with

180
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:51,043
a better name immediately.

181
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,300
Ok. Who was it who attacked you guys?

182
00:09:57,376 --> 00:09:59,051
Another mask, some sort of exosuit.

183
00:09:59,128 --> 00:10:00,720
Looked military.

184
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,065
All right, we need a full
forensics sweep of the abduction point.

185
00:10:04,142 --> 00:10:06,058
I need to know
where they could've gone.

186
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:07,694
On it.

187
00:10:09,856 --> 00:10:11,314
What is this circus?

188
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,982
Public relations. Oliver thought...

189
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:14,859
I don't mean them. I mean
what I've been hearing

190
00:10:14,936 --> 00:10:16,694
about a vigilante being abducted tonight.

191
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:18,487
I thought you didn't care about vigilantes.

192
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:20,531
Believe me, captain Drake,
I'm anything but sanguine,

193
00:10:20,608 --> 00:10:22,250
but your little stunt of
deputizing Oliver Queen

194
00:10:22,327 --> 00:10:24,493
has set off a firestorm.

195
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,254
That's funny. I think that's
actually a different superhero.

196
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:27,830
You're doing your damage control.

197
00:10:27,907 --> 00:10:29,206
I'm doing mine.

198
00:10:29,283 --> 00:10:30,750
I'm holding a town hall on vigilantism.

199
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,086
In the hope that firestorm will
burn Oliver, get him to resign?

200
00:10:34,097 --> 00:10:35,880
Your friend Oliver,

201
00:10:35,957 --> 00:10:37,882
he's gonna have to stand in
front of the city he lied to,

202
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:39,884
a city that's afraid of him, and justify

203
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:41,936
his continued existence
as the Green Arrow.

204
00:10:42,013 --> 00:10:43,930
You can't force him to.

205
00:10:44,006 --> 00:10:46,065
Oh, I'm the mayor.
I'm pretty sure I can.

206
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,157
You guys get all that?

207
00:11:00,365 --> 00:11:01,864
Take it off.

208
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:02,865
What?

209
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:04,742
The worm or virus

210
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:06,285
or trojan horse you put on my tablet.

211
00:11:06,296 --> 00:11:07,536
Take it off right now.

212
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:08,913
I didn't put anything on your...

213
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,748
I found a firewall breach

214
00:11:10,825 --> 00:11:12,124
with a Bluetooth incursion.

215
00:11:12,135 --> 00:11:13,918
It had to be you.

216
00:11:13,995 --> 00:11:16,304
Ok! Whoa.

217
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:18,306
I programmed a virus

218
00:11:18,383 --> 00:11:20,475
so that it would infect anything
that tried to log on to our WiFi

219
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:22,134
for security purposes.

220
00:11:22,145 --> 00:11:23,645
It wasn't personal.

221
00:11:23,721 --> 00:11:25,647
Take it off right now.

222
00:11:25,723 --> 00:11:28,766
Ok. Whoa.
What is going on with you?

223
00:11:28,843 --> 00:11:30,559
I haven't seen anybody
this unhappy to be home

224
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:33,988
since I had to go back to Vegas
after my first year of MIT.

225
00:11:34,065 --> 00:11:35,490
I'm just pissed about my tablet.

226
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:37,775
You were pissed a long time

227
00:11:37,852 --> 00:11:39,944
before you found my virus, which
is for your protection, by the way.

228
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:42,863
Really good job on finding it.
I mean...

229
00:11:42,874 --> 00:11:44,407
Do you want to talk?

230
00:11:44,483 --> 00:11:45,658
No.

231
00:11:45,669 --> 00:11:47,368
That wasn't so much a suggestion

232
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:49,337
as it was more one of those
"mom" things where

233
00:11:49,414 --> 00:11:51,923
if you don't talk now,
you're grounded. So...

234
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,345
Why didn't you let me come
home for Christmas break?

235
00:11:57,422 --> 00:12:00,798
Oh, well...

236
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,592
Trust me, things here were
very complicated.

237
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:08,806
I was the only kid left at school,
and then when I come back here,

238
00:12:08,883 --> 00:12:11,100
dad's in the middle
of making some movie.

239
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:12,735
It's a documentary. It's...

240
00:12:15,481 --> 00:12:17,606
I'm sorry. I thought
you'd be happy to be home.

241
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:19,650
We're so happy that you're home.

242
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:21,736
We missed you.

243
00:12:21,812 --> 00:12:23,612
Then you shouldn't have sent me away.

244
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:25,656
That is not fair.

245
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:29,127
Yeah. Neither is getting shipped off
to boarding school.

246
00:12:36,627 --> 00:12:37,835
John.

247
00:12:37,912 --> 00:12:39,628
Hey.

248
00:12:39,705 --> 00:12:42,390
Felicity's having trouble
locating the new Green Arrow

249
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:44,842
using surveillance and
keyhole satellite technology,

250
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:47,011
but I think we both know

251
00:12:47,088 --> 00:12:48,896
A.R.G.U.S. has satellites off the books.

252
00:12:48,973 --> 00:12:50,848
Oliver, you come in
here with guns blazing,

253
00:12:50,925 --> 00:12:52,641
asking for satellite access
you shouldn't even know about!

254
00:12:52,718 --> 00:12:54,727
I'm simply asking if I can
have your help on this one.

255
00:12:54,738 --> 00:12:57,238
Well, Oliver, yes, but, look,
I need a little bit more information.

256
00:12:57,315 --> 00:12:59,482
I'm quite sure you're
not this animated

257
00:12:59,558 --> 00:13:01,484
because this missing
Green Arrow copied your hood.

258
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,077
She was abducted, John,
and I need to find her.

259
00:13:03,154 --> 00:13:04,579
How do you know he's a her?

260
00:13:07,108 --> 00:13:09,250
Because she's my sister.

261
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:13,871
Thea?

262
00:13:13,948 --> 00:13:16,540
I have another sister.

263
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:18,259
My mother wasn't the only
one who had an affair.

264
00:13:18,336 --> 00:13:20,428
Who'd have known
that wearing a hood

265
00:13:20,505 --> 00:13:22,472
and carrying a bow and arrow
runs in a gene pool?

266
00:13:24,342 --> 00:13:27,259
Look, will you... will you
please help me find her?

267
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,437
Of course I will.

268
00:13:29,514 --> 00:13:31,055
But I have to ask...

269
00:13:31,132 --> 00:13:32,598
How long have you
known about this?

270
00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:33,649
- A month.
- A month.

271
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:35,059
I didn't keep it from you.

272
00:13:35,136 --> 00:13:37,236
I don't do that anymore.

273
00:13:37,313 --> 00:13:39,271
I mean, you have to admit, we
haven't exactly been running

274
00:13:39,282 --> 00:13:41,282
in the same circles lately.

275
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:44,693
Lately. Lately's been
nearly a year, Oliver.

276
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,278
But I get it.

277
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:48,956
We have not been looped in.

278
00:13:50,985 --> 00:13:52,910
But, look,
you should know something.

279
00:13:52,987 --> 00:13:54,703
You rang, boss?

280
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:58,466
I did. Oliver needs access to
the black watch satellites.

281
00:13:58,543 --> 00:14:01,010
Is he supposed to know about those?
You know about those?

282
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:06,641
You've met my wife,
right, Curtis?

283
00:14:06,717 --> 00:14:07,925
Great point.

284
00:14:08,002 --> 00:14:09,426
Uh, what are we looking for?

285
00:14:09,503 --> 00:14:11,646
Not what. Who.

286
00:14:16,635 --> 00:14:18,727
Area's clear.

287
00:14:18,804 --> 00:14:20,312
You sure this is the place?

288
00:14:20,323 --> 00:14:22,314
It's been closed over a year.

289
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:24,158
Curtis saw movement off
the black watch satellites

290
00:14:24,235 --> 00:14:27,444
at the new Green Arrow's
last location.

291
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:30,164
Her name is Emiko.

292
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:32,324
Sounds like you two
have had a conversation.

293
00:14:32,335 --> 00:14:34,118
It's not going too well so far.

294
00:14:34,195 --> 00:14:36,504
My father abandoned her.

295
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:38,664
My mother didn't help any.

296
00:14:38,675 --> 00:14:40,124
Still, shows a lot of respect

297
00:14:40,201 --> 00:14:42,126
for her to put on your hood and quiver.

298
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:44,920
Not quite sure why she's done that.

299
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:48,015
Looks like someone's
been fixing up the place.

300
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:09,537
Oliver.

301
00:15:15,194 --> 00:15:18,829
Looks like Rory Regan's...

302
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:20,715
And Rene's.

303
00:15:24,795 --> 00:15:26,846
John, that's Helena's.

304
00:15:32,711 --> 00:15:35,387
And this is Emiko's.

305
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:38,515
What the hell is this guy doing?

306
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:40,860
He's hunting vigilantes.

307
00:15:44,953 --> 00:15:47,328
I've been on more than
one side of the law.

308
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,072
I was a vigilante, and now
I'm the District Attorney.

309
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,157
So, I think it's pretty safe to say

310
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:56,161
that I'm qualified to talk about
whether vigilantes can operate

311
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:58,914
within the bounds of the law.

312
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,166
They can't.
They shouldn't.

313
00:16:01,177 --> 00:16:04,962
I know that. And guess what.
They know it, too.

314
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,590
Because if what they were
doing was right,

315
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:11,343
they wouldn't hide behind a mask.

316
00:16:11,354 --> 00:16:15,189
Yeah, and I stopped
hiding behind a mask.

317
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:21,270
But I didn't stop doing good because
people need help.

318
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:22,989
It's just that simple.

319
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,984
Is that all?

320
00:16:27,061 --> 00:16:30,279
I keep going out there
because I love my city

321
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:33,449
and I'd do anything to help it.

322
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:38,620
To me, I'm risking more sitting
on my hands doing nothing,

323
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,956
just letting the world get worse.

324
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,207
Yeah, the mayor, the politicians.

325
00:16:42,284 --> 00:16:44,176
They might care about the city,

326
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,463
but they don't seem to give a
crap about the people in it.

327
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:51,633
So, are you really so surprised when
people decide to do something about it?

328
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:56,138
Um, Oliver's a complicated person.

329
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,975
You know, we haven't always
seen eye to eye.

330
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:02,644
He's no Saint.

331
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:08,442
But he doesn't have to be for
what he does, for what he is.

332
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:10,861
That's a hero.

333
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:12,863
So it looks like I'm the director, right?

334
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,415
That's awesome.

335
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:17,659
I didn't just... I...
I messed it up? Sorry.

336
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:22,423
Oliver is an interesting guy. Um...

337
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,925
Unbelievably damaged.

338
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,045
I hope he won't mind me
saying that.

339
00:17:28,122 --> 00:17:31,048
I don't mean... well, all I meant
by that was just that he's...

340
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,675
He's lived through
a lot of darkness.

341
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,261
And all he really cares
about is trying to make sure

342
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:40,099
nobody else has to go
through what he's gone through.

343
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:42,443
No, no, no. I didn't know
he was the Green Arrow

344
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,269
until he turned himself in.
I mean, and...

345
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:46,897
You know.

346
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:49,950
Whoa, obviously, big surprise.

347
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,611
I mean, you think you know a guy.

348
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,032
And bingo was his name-o.

349
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,793
I found chimera.

350
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,285
Chimera?

351
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:01,796
Yeah. Chimera.
We gotta call him something.

352
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,580
I thought "chimera" sounded cool.

353
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:07,468
Ok, do I look like Cisco?

354
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,253
Uh, who are they?

355
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:10,971
Curtis!

356
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,549
I need you to focus.
How'd you find our target?

357
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,059
What?
Oh, yeah, uh, sorry.

358
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,802
I managed to track it
using the security footage

359
00:18:16,813 --> 00:18:18,479
from that abandoned athletic club.

360
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,930
After that, I was able
to pinpoint the trajectory

361
00:18:20,007 --> 00:18:21,723
using the black watch satellites,

362
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,726
which I never said,
because they don't exist.

363
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:26,904
Ok. Where was
he headed, Curtis?

364
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,148
101 federal street. It's an abandoned
building. Probably a secondary lair.

365
00:18:29,158 --> 00:18:30,941
101 federal?

366
00:18:31,018 --> 00:18:32,568
Yeah. Why?

367
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,070
It used to be Adam hunt's building.

368
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,738
Who's Adam hunt?

369
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:40,159
You know, either way, suit up!

370
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:42,119
They're already suited up, though.

371
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,882
Hurry up.
Get this, get this.

372
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,668
Ok, yeah. Huh!
Not anymore.

373
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,962
It's a big building.
He could be anywhere.

374
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:54,339
Let's start from
the top, work our way down.

375
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,133
You really shouldn't
be in here with us.

376
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,676
He's right.

377
00:18:57,687 --> 00:18:59,428
The guy we're going
after is dangerous.

378
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:01,021
We knew what we were
getting ourselves into

379
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,639
when we agreed to this.

380
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:04,308
- Suit yourself.
- Oliver!

381
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,769
What the hell is that?

382
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,530
Get them out of here!

383
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,356
Keep looking for her!

384
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:13,358
Go, go, go! Get down,
get down, get down, get down!

385
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,152
Ok, just go.

386
00:19:15,163 --> 00:19:17,288
Aah! Uh!

387
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:48,185
Get out of here now!

388
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,818
You all right?

389
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,404
Yeah. I knew you had my back.

390
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:00,956
Oliver!

391
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:04,585
Look...

392
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,411
She's hurt bad.

393
00:20:06,422 --> 00:20:09,206
It's ok.
You're gonna be ok.

394
00:20:09,283 --> 00:20:11,416
He's... he's coming.

395
00:20:11,427 --> 00:20:13,594
He's coming for you, Oliver.

396
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:21,929
Hey, hey. You hungry?

397
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,099
We've still got half a pizza
left, and somebody's gotta eat it.

398
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,601
- Thanks, dad.
- Of course.

399
00:20:27,854 --> 00:20:29,103
Who's that?

400
00:20:29,114 --> 00:20:33,357
It's probably your aunt Dinah coming
here to lecture me about something.

401
00:20:33,434 --> 00:20:36,444
I swear, she treats me
like a kid or something.

402
00:20:36,455 --> 00:20:38,154
Well, if you just listen to her.

403
00:20:38,231 --> 00:20:40,832
If you take her side,
I take back that pizza.

404
00:20:43,295 --> 00:20:44,952
Hi. Is Zoe home?

405
00:20:44,963 --> 00:20:47,371
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

406
00:20:47,448 --> 00:20:49,874
I didn't know you
were back in town.

407
00:20:49,951 --> 00:20:51,584
Just for a few days.

408
00:20:51,661 --> 00:20:53,711
Your folks know you're here?

409
00:20:53,788 --> 00:20:55,379
I'm not 7.

410
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:58,758
Hey, will. Dad,
I totally forgot.

411
00:20:58,835 --> 00:21:00,593
I texted will about
my geography homework.

412
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,228
He said he'd come over to help.

413
00:21:02,305 --> 00:21:03,971
Is it ok if we work
in the living room?

414
00:21:03,982 --> 00:21:06,149
I didn't realize
that you two were...

415
00:21:06,226 --> 00:21:07,650
Ahem... you know.

416
00:21:07,727 --> 00:21:08,684
Friends?

417
00:21:08,761 --> 00:21:09,977
Yeah.

418
00:21:09,988 --> 00:21:11,479
Felicity set up
an encryption scheme

419
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,980
so I could text Zoe
while I was away.

420
00:21:12,991 --> 00:21:14,440
I didn't know that.
Why didn't I know that?

421
00:21:14,517 --> 00:21:15,650
How come you didn't tell me?

422
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,068
It's just texting, dad.

423
00:21:17,144 --> 00:21:19,612
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, sure, yeah.

424
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:22,165
Um, you guys can have
the living room.

425
00:21:22,242 --> 00:21:24,784
I'll be in the next room...

426
00:21:24,861 --> 00:21:27,337
Cleaning my gun.

427
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:32,717
Don't worry about him.
How's it being back home?

428
00:21:32,794 --> 00:21:34,669
Sucks.

429
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:37,755
Guys with cameras are following
my dad and Felicity everywhere.

430
00:21:37,832 --> 00:21:40,424
And that's what's bothering you?

431
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:42,426
We've only got about 3 minutes

432
00:21:42,503 --> 00:21:44,178
before my dad finds
an excuse to check on us.

433
00:21:44,189 --> 00:21:45,847
What's wrong?

434
00:21:45,857 --> 00:21:48,975
You tell some girl you have a crush on her
and she didn't like you back?

435
00:21:49,051 --> 00:21:50,434
Sort of.

436
00:21:50,511 --> 00:21:52,270
Cool. What's her name?

437
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:54,021
It's not that.

438
00:21:54,032 --> 00:21:56,440
Then what is it?

439
00:21:56,517 --> 00:21:58,609
I don't know.

440
00:21:58,686 --> 00:22:00,444
I think you do know.

441
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:02,205
You just don't want to tell me.

442
00:22:02,282 --> 00:22:04,707
Maybe it's not the worst thing.

443
00:22:04,784 --> 00:22:07,210
My dad and aunt Dinah
fight instead of talk.

444
00:22:07,287 --> 00:22:09,662
Promise me we'll
never be like that.

445
00:22:09,739 --> 00:22:12,039
You got it.

446
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,041
Mind if I hang here
for a few hours?

447
00:22:14,052 --> 00:22:16,127
I really do not
want to go back home.

448
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:18,004
Ok. We should probably
open that geography book.

449
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,798
Yeah.

450
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,642
Get up. Go.

451
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:24,677
What's that mean,
"he's coming for you"?

452
00:22:24,754 --> 00:22:26,178
Well, this chimera...

453
00:22:26,255 --> 00:22:27,680
I'm really glad that
name's catching on.

454
00:22:27,757 --> 00:22:29,682
Hey, he's hunting vigilantes.

455
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:33,561
So he's like
an anti-vigilante vigilante.

456
00:22:33,572 --> 00:22:35,238
More like a predator
or a lion trying

457
00:22:35,315 --> 00:22:36,981
to take down the biggest
in the jungle.

458
00:22:37,058 --> 00:22:38,858
That's quite a leap.

459
00:22:38,935 --> 00:22:40,693
Tell that to Rene, who
was nearly cut in half,

460
00:22:40,704 --> 00:22:42,653
had it not been for the
kevlar, or Rory or Helena,

461
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,697
neither of which we can
get in contact with.

462
00:22:44,774 --> 00:22:47,250
Oliver and I came across
this collection of masks

463
00:22:47,327 --> 00:22:49,535
in chimera's underground lair.

464
00:22:49,612 --> 00:22:51,704
He had them all on display,

465
00:22:51,781 --> 00:22:53,497
almost like trophies.

466
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:55,258
Any word?

467
00:22:55,335 --> 00:22:57,877
Best guess is that
she has a concussion

468
00:22:57,954 --> 00:22:59,545
and a couple of broken ribs.

469
00:22:59,622 --> 00:23:03,007
They're having Dr. Schwartz
examine her discreetly.

470
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:05,092
Did she give you
any intel on chimera?

471
00:23:05,103 --> 00:23:07,437
Is that what we're calling it?

472
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:09,722
I can only hope. I mean,
it'd be nice. Heh! Ahem.

473
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:12,233
No, she was in too much pain to speak.

474
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,559
- Meanwhile.
- Meanwhile...

475
00:23:13,636 --> 00:23:15,102
You're next on chimera's list.

476
00:23:15,113 --> 00:23:16,896
So I can't think of a worse idea

477
00:23:16,973 --> 00:23:18,781
than going out as Green Arrow
during Pollard's town hall.

478
00:23:18,858 --> 00:23:20,733
Except maybe showing up
in the first place.

479
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,619
Maybe you should tell Pollard
that you're not coming.

480
00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:24,904
I think that's Dinah's job.

481
00:23:24,981 --> 00:23:27,114
Great.

482
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:29,292
Excuse me.
Uh, where is she?

483
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:30,910
What?

484
00:23:30,987 --> 00:23:32,870
Your green-hooded friend.
She's not in her room.

485
00:23:32,947 --> 00:23:34,455
Oh, for god's sakes.

486
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:36,707
Well, did we really expect
her to stick around?

487
00:23:36,784 --> 00:23:39,802
No.

488
00:23:55,845 --> 00:23:56,852
It's just me.

489
00:23:56,929 --> 00:23:58,771
What are you doing here?

490
00:23:58,848 --> 00:24:00,940
Captain Drake told me you
bailed at the hospital.

491
00:24:01,017 --> 00:24:02,775
I just came to check up on you.

492
00:24:02,852 --> 00:24:04,276
Let me help you with that.

493
00:24:04,353 --> 00:24:06,329
I can manage on my own.

494
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:08,572
You are so stubborn.

495
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:11,501
You sure you and
Oliver aren't related?

496
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,916
Actually, we are.

497
00:24:18,993 --> 00:24:20,918
He's my half-brother.

498
00:24:20,995 --> 00:24:22,920
Ha ha! That's funny.

499
00:24:22,997 --> 00:24:25,139
I'm not joking.

500
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:30,144
Robert Queen was my father.

501
00:24:32,765 --> 00:24:35,808
So when you told me
about your mother,

502
00:24:35,885 --> 00:24:38,978
you kind of left out a
pretty important detail.

503
00:24:39,055 --> 00:24:42,982
Robert was out of
the picture long before.

504
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:45,192
I didn't want to tell you

505
00:24:45,203 --> 00:24:48,195
because I didn't want
to risk changing things.

506
00:24:48,206 --> 00:24:50,948
Changing what things?

507
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:55,202
You and me working together.

508
00:24:55,213 --> 00:24:57,621
Why would it?

509
00:24:57,698 --> 00:25:00,207
Oliver's got his thing,
and we've got our thing.

510
00:25:00,218 --> 00:25:02,635
Right?

511
00:25:04,222 --> 00:25:07,557
Yeah, we do.

512
00:25:15,233 --> 00:25:17,641
All right. All right.
Thank you, Ms. Mayor...

513
00:25:17,718 --> 00:25:18,976
For nothing.

514
00:25:20,429 --> 00:25:21,979
We have a new problem.

515
00:25:22,056 --> 00:25:23,856
Don't we always?

516
00:25:23,933 --> 00:25:25,900
Dinah, before we get to that,

517
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:28,861
there's something that
I need to speak with you about,

518
00:25:28,938 --> 00:25:31,363
something I've been
keeping from you.

519
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,658
Well, that is par for
the course with you, Oliver.

520
00:25:34,735 --> 00:25:36,419
That's a fair point.

521
00:25:36,496 --> 00:25:38,245
In this instance,

522
00:25:38,256 --> 00:25:42,249
I just... I needed some time
to process the information

523
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,001
before I shared it
with everyone.

524
00:25:44,078 --> 00:25:46,012
What information?

525
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:48,255
The new Green Arrow
is my half-sister.

526
00:25:48,266 --> 00:25:52,676
She's the product of an
affair that my father had.

527
00:25:52,753 --> 00:25:54,887
Wow.

528
00:25:54,964 --> 00:25:56,680
Ha ha!
I wasn't expecting that.

529
00:25:56,757 --> 00:25:59,892
I really hope you can appreciate
why I needed some time with this.

530
00:25:59,969 --> 00:26:01,560
Sure. Yeah.

531
00:26:01,637 --> 00:26:03,187
I have lots of questions.

532
00:26:03,264 --> 00:26:04,855
I have a lot of questions, too.

533
00:26:04,932 --> 00:26:07,274
I have been trying to connect with her,

534
00:26:07,285 --> 00:26:11,946
but she is not very trusting
at the moment.

535
00:26:11,956 --> 00:26:14,281
Sounds like your sister, all right.

536
00:26:14,292 --> 00:26:16,575
Ok, what's our new problem?

537
00:26:16,652 --> 00:26:18,911
Right. Pollard is insisting you
go to the town hall tonight.

538
00:26:18,988 --> 00:26:21,038
What?
You explained to her...

539
00:26:21,115 --> 00:26:22,540
Yeah, of course I did.

540
00:26:22,616 --> 00:26:24,133
But she actually thinks
that we made up chimera

541
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,377
as an excuse to get you
to not face the city.

542
00:26:26,453 --> 00:26:29,296
If I had a problem being
scrutinized, Dinah,

543
00:26:29,307 --> 00:26:31,298
I wouldn't let a camera
crew follow me around.

544
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:33,092
I know. I explained that to her.

545
00:26:33,103 --> 00:26:35,302
But if you ask me,
she sees this town hall

546
00:26:35,313 --> 00:26:36,929
as a chance to publicly crucify you,

547
00:26:37,006 --> 00:26:38,481
and she's not gonna miss that.

548
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:39,974
I'm not exposing hundreds of people

549
00:26:39,984 --> 00:26:42,101
to what could potentially
become a war zone.

550
00:26:42,178 --> 00:26:44,061
Pollard cannot force me to.

551
00:26:44,138 --> 00:26:45,312
I will tell her.

552
00:26:45,323 --> 00:26:46,897
Thank you.

553
00:26:46,974 --> 00:26:48,566
Mm-hmm. This should be fun.

554
00:26:48,642 --> 00:26:51,110
Hey. You got a minute?

555
00:26:51,187 --> 00:26:53,154
Of course.

556
00:26:53,164 --> 00:26:55,322
I know you don't plan on doing this
town hall meeting thing, do you?

557
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:57,324
I just told Dinah to
tell Pollard that.

558
00:26:57,335 --> 00:26:58,826
I'm thinking maybe you should.

559
00:26:58,837 --> 00:27:00,244
It might be our only shot
at catching chimera.

560
00:27:00,321 --> 00:27:01,745
Curtis will find him again.

561
00:27:01,822 --> 00:27:03,330
Yeah, well, the trail's
gone cold.

562
00:27:03,341 --> 00:27:06,083
But, Oliver, I have a plan.

563
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,960
I'm all ears.

564
00:27:08,037 --> 00:27:09,753
So are they.

565
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:14,341
Sorry, guys.
Private party.

566
00:27:14,418 --> 00:27:16,302
Ugh. Damn it.

567
00:27:16,378 --> 00:27:17,803
I enjoyed that.

568
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,638
You know I know what
you're gonna say, right?

569
00:27:19,715 --> 00:27:21,140
I do.

570
00:27:21,217 --> 00:27:23,100
Best way to stop chimera
is by drawing him out?

571
00:27:23,177 --> 00:27:25,144
Exactly.

572
00:27:25,221 --> 00:27:29,532
Not with hundreds of
people there, John.

573
00:27:29,609 --> 00:27:31,701
This guy's taken down 4 vigilantes.

574
00:27:31,777 --> 00:27:33,986
He is out of the SCPD's league.

575
00:27:34,063 --> 00:27:35,496
Yes, he is...

576
00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:39,158
But not Team Arrow's.

577
00:27:39,235 --> 00:27:40,701
What? No. No.

578
00:27:40,778 --> 00:27:44,714
There's no world in which Pollard
will allow Dinah to deputize all of you.

579
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,549
And I'm certainly not going
to risk you going to prison

580
00:27:46,626 --> 00:27:48,542
for violating the anti-vigilante law.

581
00:27:48,553 --> 00:27:53,005
Come on. Even if I was
willing to take that risk,

582
00:27:53,082 --> 00:27:54,798
there is no Team Arrow anymore.

583
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:56,383
But there is.

584
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,135
Oliver, there is.

585
00:27:58,212 --> 00:27:59,979
It's just changed.

586
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:05,234
We may not have been Team Arrow
when you were in Slabside,

587
00:28:05,311 --> 00:28:08,020
but we had each other's backs.

588
00:28:08,097 --> 00:28:10,072
Just give us a chance,
man, to have yours.

589
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:12,149
You could go to prison.

590
00:28:12,226 --> 00:28:13,817
So?

591
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:16,028
You did it for us,

592
00:28:16,105 --> 00:28:18,530
which never really
sat right with me.

593
00:28:18,607 --> 00:28:21,533
And the reason why is because
it wasn't right, Oliver.

594
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,827
We have fights,
disagreements, recriminations,

595
00:28:23,904 --> 00:28:26,839
but it doesn't matter
because we are a team.

596
00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:30,551
And nothing's going
to change that.

597
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:35,714
John, I made a lot of mistakes.

598
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:38,342
We all did.

599
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:42,846
That's why they're called mistakes, Oliver.

600
00:28:42,923 --> 00:28:45,942
You learn from them.
You move forward.

601
00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:51,030
We... we get better.

602
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,467
Ladies and gentlemen,

603
00:29:08,543 --> 00:29:11,753
welcome to our town hall
discussion on vigilantism.

604
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,590
We're about to get started.
Please take your seats.

605
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:17,091
Thank you for coming.

606
00:29:17,168 --> 00:29:19,144
You made it pretty clear
I didn't have a choice.

607
00:29:19,221 --> 00:29:20,645
Well, it's my hope

608
00:29:20,722 --> 00:29:22,388
that once the Pittson Pavilion opens,

609
00:29:22,465 --> 00:29:24,599
your services will no longer be required.

610
00:29:24,676 --> 00:29:26,768
The police can keep this
event and the city safe.

611
00:29:26,845 --> 00:29:28,436
The SCPD is gonna rebuild

612
00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:29,988
into a remarkable police force,

613
00:29:30,065 --> 00:29:33,158
but if they were enough, the city
wouldn't need me, now, would they?

614
00:29:33,235 --> 00:29:34,984
It doesn't need you.

615
00:29:34,995 --> 00:29:37,779
That's exactly the message
I intend to convey tonight.

616
00:29:39,407 --> 00:29:41,658
Mayor Pollard.

617
00:29:41,668 --> 00:29:43,493
All right, buckle up, kiddies, because
overwatch is back in the house.

618
00:29:43,504 --> 00:29:45,745
Well, not actually in the house.

619
00:29:45,822 --> 00:29:47,622
I mean, I'm working at A.R.G.U.S.
remotely, but I'm on the comms, you know.

620
00:29:47,699 --> 00:29:49,415
We know what you meant, overwatch.

621
00:29:49,492 --> 00:29:51,176
Cool, cool, cool.
So I am tapped

622
00:29:51,253 --> 00:29:52,844
into the venue's CCTV, and
I am very proud of this one,

623
00:29:52,921 --> 00:29:54,462
the documentary crew's WiFi,

624
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:56,005
so everything they see, I see.

625
00:29:56,016 --> 00:29:58,049
Copy that. Standing by.

626
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,843
I swore I'd never wear this suit again.

627
00:29:59,853 --> 00:30:02,136
Come on. It's got to feel
good to be back in the saddle.

628
00:30:02,213 --> 00:30:03,847
I just wish Dinah was here with us.

629
00:30:03,857 --> 00:30:05,640
She's doing her thing with SCPD.

630
00:30:05,717 --> 00:30:07,809
That anti-vigilante law's crap, man.

631
00:30:07,886 --> 00:30:09,811
No argument from me.

632
00:30:09,888 --> 00:30:11,688
Let's do this!

633
00:30:11,698 --> 00:30:13,314
Over the past 7 years,
Star City has suffered

634
00:30:13,391 --> 00:30:15,817
through a weapon
of mass destruction,

635
00:30:15,894 --> 00:30:19,204
an actual army of soldiers,
and nuclear weapons...

636
00:30:19,281 --> 00:30:21,206
What happened 7 years ago, I wonder.

637
00:30:21,283 --> 00:30:23,658
Now, mayor Pollard,
I fail to see your point.

638
00:30:23,735 --> 00:30:25,285
7 years ago,

639
00:30:25,361 --> 00:30:27,212
you started zip-lining through the city.

640
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:30,456
Your activities as the hood
and then the Green Arrow

641
00:30:30,533 --> 00:30:33,718
prompted the very same dangers that
you claim to have saved us from.

642
00:30:36,849 --> 00:30:40,049
Everyone clear out of here!

643
00:30:41,836 --> 00:30:42,802
All units,
all units, report to...

644
00:30:42,813 --> 00:30:44,095
Come on! Let's go!

645
00:30:44,106 --> 00:30:45,647
Let's go. Let's go.

646
00:30:59,913 --> 00:31:03,415
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah...

647
00:31:31,353 --> 00:31:33,519
Too bad you don't wear
the mask anymore,

648
00:31:33,596 --> 00:31:35,563
but I'll settle for the hood.

649
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,857
You want a mask?

650
00:31:37,934 --> 00:31:39,192
Here's 3.

651
00:31:52,507 --> 00:31:54,624
Ok, I'm analyzing the armor.

652
00:31:54,635 --> 00:31:56,542
It's Wayne enterprises, military grade.

653
00:31:56,619 --> 00:31:58,720
I'm just figuring out
how to disable it.

654
00:32:19,851 --> 00:32:22,151
Get as many of these people
out of here as you can.

655
00:32:22,162 --> 00:32:23,778
What about you?

656
00:32:23,855 --> 00:32:25,571
He wants a vigilante?

657
00:32:25,648 --> 00:32:28,282
I'm gonna give him one.

658
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:29,951
Ok, good news, bad news
time, guys.

659
00:32:30,028 --> 00:32:32,161
The suit is powered by
an exolithium cell.

660
00:32:32,172 --> 00:32:34,673
He can't move without it.
The only problem is...

661
00:32:34,749 --> 00:32:36,416
It's electromagnetic shielded,

662
00:32:36,492 --> 00:32:39,460
which means you can't
disable it remotely.

663
00:32:39,537 --> 00:32:40,795
All good.

664
00:32:40,872 --> 00:32:42,681
Oliver, Dinah, team's in position.

665
00:32:42,757 --> 00:32:43,923
We've got this.

666
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,091
On your call.

667
00:32:45,168 --> 00:32:46,267
Now!

668
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,788
Uh!

669
00:33:28,211 --> 00:33:29,394
Dinah!

670
00:33:39,722 --> 00:33:41,364
Whoo!

671
00:33:43,243 --> 00:33:45,076
Please tell me you got this.

672
00:33:45,153 --> 00:33:46,986
SCPD! Don't move!
Freeze!

673
00:33:47,063 --> 00:33:48,654
What the hell is this?

674
00:33:48,731 --> 00:33:50,031
Maybe you all were too
busy being unconscious,

675
00:33:50,108 --> 00:33:51,916
but we just saved everyone in here.

676
00:33:51,993 --> 00:33:53,993
Illegally.

677
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,995
The anti-vigilante law stands.

678
00:33:56,072 --> 00:33:57,830
My hands are tied.

679
00:33:57,907 --> 00:33:59,248
Your honor...

680
00:33:59,259 --> 00:34:01,542
I'm sorry.
The law is the law.

681
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:04,045
The mayor can't make exceptions.

682
00:34:04,122 --> 00:34:06,097
Take them into custody.

683
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,780
His name's Kevin Meltzer,

684
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:21,023
recently released from
roth psychiatric hospital.

685
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,608
Imagine that.

686
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:24,693
Apparently, the hood saved
his life 7 years ago,

687
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,695
and he's been obsessed
with vigilantes ever since.

688
00:34:26,772 --> 00:34:28,289
So he just attacks them.

689
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,282
Says he just wanted the masks.

690
00:34:30,293 --> 00:34:32,284
Fans have a strange way of
showing their affection.

691
00:34:32,295 --> 00:34:34,120
Where are the others?

692
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,705
Interrogation room.

693
00:34:36,782 --> 00:34:38,290
We're not all on board with this.

694
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:39,917
Yeah, that's cute.

695
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:42,053
Hey, get that camera out of my face

696
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:44,255
before I give you an enema with it.

697
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:47,091
Well, this is another fine mess

698
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,717
you all have managed
to get yourselves into.

699
00:34:48,794 --> 00:34:50,052
We were aware of the risk.

700
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,646
All of us.

701
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:53,055
I think I know the answer to this,

702
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,473
but is there any way for us to avoid

703
00:34:54,484 --> 00:34:55,817
sharing Oliver's old cell?

704
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:56,976
As the District Attorney,

705
00:34:56,986 --> 00:34:58,144
I can decline to press charges.

706
00:34:58,154 --> 00:34:59,270
Great.

707
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,488
But by going out tonight,

708
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:02,064
we violated the avl.

709
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,816
Not so great.

710
00:35:03,827 --> 00:35:06,068
We don't have a lot
of good options here.

711
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,870
I'm sorry.

712
00:35:09,523 --> 00:35:12,500
I'm sorry.

713
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:15,837
I never should have let all of
you go out there with me tonight.

714
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:17,505
You didn't let us do anything.

715
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,290
It was the right thing to do.

716
00:35:19,366 --> 00:35:21,125
In more ways than one, Oliver.

717
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,918
It felt good.

718
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:26,088
It felt right,
like being heroes.

719
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:28,757
Being a team...

720
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:31,644
Even if it was
for the last time.

721
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,349
Disarmed.

722
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,527
Hey, kiddo, what's up?

723
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:41,529
I saw what happened on the news.

724
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:42,938
Where's dad?

725
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:46,150
Oh, he just came across
a very unexpected...

726
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,986
Completely expected setback.

727
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,654
But he will be fine.

728
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:54,116
It's actually... you
I'm worried about.

729
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,794
- I told you...
- That you've been lying to me.

730
00:35:58,381 --> 00:36:00,289
I went to go check your
midterm results online,

731
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:03,375
and I came across
a very convincing

732
00:36:03,386 --> 00:36:06,212
and very fake version
of your school's website.

733
00:36:06,222 --> 00:36:07,630
Felicity...

734
00:36:07,706 --> 00:36:11,142
And I didn't come across any test results
because you didn't take the exams.

735
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,061
Why?

736
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:19,275
Because I got expelled.

737
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,248
What's this?

738
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,158
My resignation.

739
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:39,086
I won't captain a department
that arrests my friends.

740
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:42,590
I made you captain because
I believe in you, Dinah.

741
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:46,802
And yesterday I learned you've
been lying to me all along.

742
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,598
Oh, it's a party.

743
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:53,425
To what do I owe the pleasure, Mr. Queen?

744
00:36:53,436 --> 00:36:56,428
After speaking with my family,
I'm here to turn myself in.

745
00:36:56,439 --> 00:36:58,222
If you're gonna send my friends to prison,

746
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,682
you're gonna have to send me, too.

747
00:36:59,758 --> 00:37:05,437
That's funny because captain Drake
just stopped by to offer her resignation.

748
00:37:05,448 --> 00:37:08,232
Your team really sticks together, huh?

749
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,992
Yes, we do.

750
00:37:13,957 --> 00:37:16,457
I had no idea you were one of them.

751
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:18,459
Black Canary, huh?

752
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:20,127
That's right.

753
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:22,454
And I suppose because
you saved my life,

754
00:37:22,465 --> 00:37:24,632
it's supposed to melt my cold heart,

755
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:27,251
but I wouldn't go that far, exactly.

756
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,753
Well, how far would you go?

757
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:33,641
The anti-vigilante law is still in effect,

758
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:37,761
but the District Attorney's office will
not be pressing charges on your friends.

759
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:42,650
And tomorrow, you will issue
one of these to each of them.

760
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:46,895
They'll each be deputized
like Mr. Queen.

761
00:37:46,972 --> 00:37:48,823
So you're changing your mind?

762
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,774
I am absolutely not.

763
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:53,569
Like I said, I believe in you.

764
00:37:53,645 --> 00:37:56,113
I respect results.

765
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:00,001
And as much as it pains me to admit it,

766
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:01,502
we couldn't have made it
through yesterday

767
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:04,413
without the help of vigilantes.

768
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,466
Consider this your
chance to prove me right.

769
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,137
Just watch your step, please, guys.

770
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:23,107
There's still glass on the ground.

771
00:38:23,184 --> 00:38:25,067
That was awesome.

772
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,441
What happened here?

773
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:35,494
Ricardo Diaz and his crew
happened here.

774
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,665
They couldn't stop us.

775
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,085
We're coming back here.

776
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:48,332
We'll rebuild.

777
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:51,344
Gonna do it better this time.

778
00:38:54,057 --> 00:38:58,342
Sounds like you have
regrets about how you did it before.

779
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,553
Too many to name.

780
00:39:01,564 --> 00:39:05,316
A friend of mine recently told me
that's why they're called mistakes.

781
00:39:07,403 --> 00:39:17,569
You learn from them, move forward...
Be better.

782
00:39:19,606 --> 00:39:21,073
Where did you get that?

783
00:39:21,084 --> 00:39:22,574
I stole it.

784
00:39:22,585 --> 00:39:24,076
Yeah, Mia, that much I figured,

785
00:39:24,087 --> 00:39:26,078
but wasn't this
documentary banned?

786
00:39:26,089 --> 00:39:28,589
I thought every copy
was destroyed years ago.

787
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,541
Not this one.

788
00:39:30,617 --> 00:39:33,761
It's total pro-vigilante garbage,

789
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,879
but even garbage can be useful.

790
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,381
Useful for what?
A break-in?

791
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,007
You know what?

792
00:39:39,084 --> 00:39:40,768
Actually, the less I know
about that, the better.

793
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:44,313
Trust me, Connor. You are
going to want to come with.

794
00:39:47,693 --> 00:39:50,277
So you found this place
by watching that documentary?

795
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:53,781
Oliver told them not
to reveal the location,

796
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,449
but there's always clues.

797
00:39:56,768 --> 00:39:58,610
God. It's dusty down here.

798
00:39:58,621 --> 00:40:01,947
Yeah, well, that's what happens
