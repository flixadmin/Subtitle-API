1
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,018
Whoa!

2
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:44,662
All the food's gonna go bad.

3
00:01:47,022 --> 00:01:48,682
Yeah, I drew up a list.

4
00:01:48,707 --> 00:01:51,972
I'll hit the store
before it gets all bought out.

5
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,203
Fuck.

6
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:56,714
Can you save it?

7
00:01:56,738 --> 00:02:00,462
No. No way.
No, I gotta start over from scratch.

8
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,937
I'll call the studio
when the phones get back up,

9
00:02:02,962 --> 00:02:04,904
see if they can extend my deadline.

10
00:02:05,806 --> 00:02:07,467
What choice do they have?

11
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:11,598
You kiddin'?

12
00:02:11,623 --> 00:02:14,161
They could whip up some bad
Photoshop poster in an afternoon.

13
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,403
They do it all the time. Two big heads.

14
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,817
I should have brought it downstairs
with me last night.

15
00:02:18,842 --> 00:02:20,034
Just stupid, I guess.

16
00:02:20,059 --> 00:02:21,475
Well, sweetie,

17
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,186
you couldn't exactly know that a tree
was gonna come flying through the window.

18
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:27,164
Yeah, I'll hit the hardware store too,
get some plastic sheeting and duct tape

19
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,350
and seal this up
before it gets dark, you know.

20
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,211
Order in some new glass.

21
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,598
Oh, you know what? That was your
grandfather's tree, the one he planted.

22
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,578
Used to play in that tree.
It's just stuff, though.

23
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:43,118
You know, we're safe.
That's all that counts.

24
00:02:43,428 --> 00:02:44,405
Yeah.

25
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,021
Mom, Dad, you gotta come see!

26
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:47,775
Hey, Billy, take it easy, all right?

27
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,770
I really don't want you running
all over the place.

28
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,381
But you gotta come look.
The boathouse is all bashed!

29
00:02:52,412 --> 00:02:53,815
Holy crap!

30
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:54,951
Billy.

31
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:58,053
Sorry, Mom, but you just gotta come!
Come on!

32
00:02:58,475 --> 00:02:59,404
Whoa!

33
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:01,434
Whoa.

34
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:03,124
- Whoa.
- Come on.

35
00:03:03,428 --> 00:03:05,576
Having spoken, the Doomsayer departs.

36
00:03:05,601 --> 00:03:06,451
Come on!

37
00:03:08,015 --> 00:03:10,147
How do you two always manage
to make me laugh?

38
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:13,668
- You have incredibly low standards.
- Mm-hmm.

39
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,860
Let's go, uh, see the damage.

40
00:03:16,885 --> 00:03:17,874
No.

41
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,975
- Norton's tree.
- Yeah.

42
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:29,476
You mean the dead one I've been
asking him to take down for three years

43
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,718
before it finally blew over?
That tree?

44
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,702
Really got smooshed.

45
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:36,257
You ain't kiddin'.

46
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,561
Look at that.

47
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,569
What is it, Daddy?

48
00:03:43,752 --> 00:03:44,741
Mist.

49
00:03:45,902 --> 00:03:48,803
- On the lake?
- We've had mist on the lake before.

50
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,240
Coming off the mountain like that?

51
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:53,265
Two fronts meeting,

52
00:03:53,447 --> 00:03:55,677
left over from the storm,
something like that.

53
00:03:56,311 --> 00:03:57,245
You sure?

54
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:58,905
Honey, I'm not the weatherman.

55
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,338
Why don't you take Billy, get him dressed.
I'll take him to town with me.

56
00:04:02,363 --> 00:04:03,851
Okay. Where you going?

57
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,021
I'm gonna go have a little chat
with our neighbor about his tree.

58
00:04:07,311 --> 00:04:08,242
Hon.

59
00:04:08,267 --> 00:04:10,303
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
punch him in the nose.

60
00:04:10,328 --> 00:04:11,659
You know what he's gonna say.

61
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,710
He's gonna say, "Sue me,"
which, I don't know, maybe we should.

62
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,132
Honey, one property dispute with
this guy is enough to last me a lifetime.

63
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,568
I'm gonna ask for
his insurance information.

64
00:04:22,427 --> 00:04:23,405
Okay.

65
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,974
- That's all.
- Yeah.

66
00:04:28,132 --> 00:04:30,702
Ohh! Motherfucker!

67
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:34,999
Aw, shit!

68
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,030
Ohh, you motherfucker!

69
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,046
Cock sucker!

70
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,170
"Turn on.

71
00:04:43,671 --> 00:04:45,257
"Full choke.

72
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,991
Pull five... choke."

73
00:04:52,538 --> 00:04:54,028
I guess you've seen the...

74
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,474
...boathouse.

75
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:57,749
Yeah, and...?

76
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,046
Nothin'.

77
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:02,744
Just think we should trade
insurance info, you know?

78
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,046
That's all.

79
00:05:06,776 --> 00:05:09,267
Oh, my insurance guy's gonna love me.

80
00:05:11,856 --> 00:05:13,015
Oh.

81
00:05:13,491 --> 00:05:15,649
Shit. The 1980.

82
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:17,390
I was gonna bring the station wagon, but...

83
00:05:18,697 --> 00:05:21,546
I don't know, the weather was so beautiful 
coming out of New York, I just...

84
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:22,878
You know, top down.

85
00:05:22,903 --> 00:05:24,686
I'm sorry, man. I mean it.

86
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:26,639
Sincerely.

87
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,138
That's nice of you to say.

88
00:05:29,168 --> 00:05:32,405
No, that car was cherry.
I hate to see it like that.

89
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:36,837
Okay, I'll tell you what,

90
00:05:36,862 --> 00:05:39,578
I'll find my insurance guy's number,
I'll bring it by later.

91
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,466
- That okay?
- No problem.

92
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,812
So, uh, David,

93
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:54,066
you're not heading into town today
by any chance, are you?

94
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,601
Well, CMP's out in force.

95
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,054
Maybe we'll get our power back.

96
00:06:13,425 --> 00:06:14,949
I know. Some storm, huh?

97
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,476
One for the books, yeah.

98
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:20,560
For a moment there last night, I thought
we were gonna take off and head for Oz.

99
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,987
WZON is off the air,
but Portland's still broadcasting.

100
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:26,341
Daddy, look.

101
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:27,962
Ah.

102
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,718
Guys from the base.

103
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,826
- From up the mountain?
- Uh-huh.

104
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:33,437
The Arrowhead Project?

105
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,893
Well, you're a local.
Any idea what they do up there?

106
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:41,640
Missile defense research. You know, 
I'm sure you've heard the stories.

107
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,877
Oh, sure. The woman at
the Laundromat says that, uh,

108
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:48,049
they have a crashed flying saucer
up there with frozen alien bodies.

109
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,837
Right. Miss Edna. Yeah.

110
00:06:50,054 --> 00:06:51,437
Miss Tabloid.

111
00:06:52,781 --> 00:06:55,359
"I Had Bigfoot's Baby."

112
00:06:56,664 --> 00:06:59,008
"Satan's Face Appears in Oil Well Fire."

113
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:00,781
You know, real reliable stuff.

114
00:07:05,153 --> 00:07:06,643
Well, they're in a hurry.

115
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:08,906
Maybe their power's out too.

116
00:07:17,835 --> 00:07:18,894
Huh. Still no signal.

117
00:07:19,534 --> 00:07:21,984
Why don't you go ahead?
I'm gonna try Steph on a pay phone.

118
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:23,704
Can I go with Mr. Norton, Daddy?

119
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,654
Sure, if you promise
to hold his hand, I guess.

120
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:27,776
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

121
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:29,390
Here's a list.

122
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:30,840
- Sure.
- Okay?

123
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:32,527
Meet you guys in there.

124
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,075
Hold hands.

125
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,189
I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was your sister.

126
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,473
That looks so freaky!

127
00:07:47,643 --> 00:07:48,632
Hmm.

128
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,518
- Sally, hey.
- Hey, Mr. Drayton.

129
00:07:58,543 --> 00:08:00,088
You guys look jammed up.

130
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:03,124
Yeah, well, half the staff
didn't show, plus the power's out.

131
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,902
Oh, no. What, no backup generator?

132
00:08:05,965 --> 00:08:07,094
Only to keep the food cold.

133
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,846
Everything else, welcome to the
Dark Ages, and bring your checkbook.

134
00:08:09,871 --> 00:08:13,563
Hey, Thursday night, Steph and I 
want a date night. Baby-sit?

135
00:08:13,587 --> 00:08:15,277
Heck, yeah. I'm there.

136
00:08:16,513 --> 00:08:17,781
Oh, my God.

137
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:22,586
The storm. Everybody's stockin' up. 
Been like this since we opened.

138
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,828
Crappy day, huh?

139
00:08:23,853 --> 00:08:26,344
Eh, everyone's a little pissed off 
this morning.

140
00:08:26,742 --> 00:08:28,573
'Morning, Mrs. Carmody.

141
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:31,786
With lines like these,
I don't know how good it is,

142
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:34,306
but I guess we'll have to make do.

143
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,603
Keep your head down, pal.

144
00:08:36,628 --> 00:08:37,767
I know it.

145
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,309
Hey, champ.

146
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,234
Your wife should be a doctor.

147
00:08:45,236 --> 00:08:47,265
She could make a fortune in Manhattan
with this handwriting.

148
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,971
Yeah, it takes some getting used to.

149
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,315
Why don't you get your stuff?
I'll meet you at the checkout.

150
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,423
Okay, done.

151
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:59,130
Hey, David,
thanks for helping me out today.

152
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,395
Are you and Mr. Norton
gonna be friends now, Daddy?

153
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,944
Oh, I don't know.

154
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:10,219
"Friends" might be stretching it a little.

155
00:09:11,121 --> 00:09:13,361
I guess you're not mad
at each other anymore.

156
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,375
I guess not.

157
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:18,020
And that's a start, huh?

158
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,884
I'm sorry, ma'am, the registers are down.
The power outage got us too.

159
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:25,442
Hopefully we'll have power up pretty soon.

160
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,203
- The bus leaves in 30 minutes.
- We'll make it, okay?

161
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,235
You guys get the goodies.
I'll wait in line.

162
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,585
I need some change on register five.

163
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,851
Good morning, Ms. Reppler.

164
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,586
Hello, Ms. Reppler.

165
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:57,556
Well, hello to you, Billy Drayton.
How'd you hold up in the storm?

166
00:09:57,581 --> 00:10:01,085
We had a tree come through the picture
window last night, right in my studio.

167
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,300
And the boathouse got all smooshed.
Mr. Norton's tree fell on it.

168
00:10:04,325 --> 00:10:05,280
Ouch.

169
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,796
- Yeah.
- Sorry to hear that.

170
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,300
How'd you guys make out?

171
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:15,387
Oh, we're fine.
It's the listings I'm worried about.

172
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,339
At the very least, I'll bet every one
of our "For Sale" signs fell over.

173
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,025
We had damage at the school,
wouldn't you know?

174
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,050
That's what we get for not fixing
that roof when we should've,

175
00:10:24,075 --> 00:10:27,141
but with funds being cut every year...

176
00:10:27,564 --> 00:10:31,534
You'd think educating children would
be more of a priority in this country,

177
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:33,444
but you'd be wrong.

178
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,720
Government's got better things
to spend our money on,

179
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:40,520
like corporate handouts
and building bombs.

180
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,834
Daddy, is there a fire? Is Mommy all right?

181
00:10:55,859 --> 00:10:58,419
I'm sure she's fine. Don't worry, okay?

182
00:10:59,734 --> 00:11:01,437
Mind what you're doing, Sally.

183
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,687
Oh, come on, we got 10 days' leave.
Check our papers.

184
00:11:04,712 --> 00:11:07,875
Look, I told you, all leaves are cancelled.
I don't know why.

185
00:11:08,242 --> 00:11:09,944
I gotta go check the pharmacy out.

186
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,437
Three men meet me
back at the Jeep in five minutes.

187
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:13,945
That's an order.

188
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,875
Shit, man! Another half an hour,
and we'd have been gone.

189
00:11:52,774 --> 00:11:54,366
Oh, my God!

190
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:03,769
Something in the mist!

191
00:12:05,128 --> 00:12:07,580
Something in the mist took John Lee!

192
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:09,158
Dan, catch your breath.

193
00:12:09,183 --> 00:12:10,871
Something in the mist took John Lee.

194
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,659
I could hear him screaming.

195
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:15,710
Shut the doors! Shut the doors!
My God!

196
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,480
Daddy, I'm scared. Can we go home?

197
00:12:21,961 --> 00:12:23,229
Don't go out there.

198
00:12:23,254 --> 00:12:25,604
There's something in the mist.
It took John Lee.

199
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:27,822
Screw that! I'm gettin' in my car.

200
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,129
Mister, no!

201
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:03,910
Please hold me. Please.

202
00:13:03,944 --> 00:13:05,335
It's okay, it's okay.

203
00:13:05,428 --> 00:13:09,430
It's a pollution cloud.
The mills down in Rumford.

204
00:13:10,007 --> 00:13:12,549
Some kind of chemical explosion.
Has to be.

205
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:15,780
What is it?

206
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:18,624
What's going on?

207
00:13:21,522 --> 00:13:22,905
It's death.

208
00:13:57,991 --> 00:13:59,335
Stay down!

209
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,066
Daddy!

210
00:14:09,618 --> 00:14:10,846
You okay?

211
00:14:21,564 --> 00:14:23,150
That was an earthquake.

212
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:26,281
I tell you, the goddamn mills blew up!

213
00:14:26,306 --> 00:14:29,643
Is everyone okay? Is anyone hurt?

214
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,967
Everybody just stay put, okay?
Just stay inside the store.

215
00:14:33,275 --> 00:14:36,078
I can't. I can't stay here.
I gotta get home to my kids.

216
00:14:36,103 --> 00:14:39,119
No. No, don't go out there.

217
00:14:39,191 --> 00:14:41,989
It's death out there.
It's the end of days.

218
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,250
Stop it, okay? Stop it.

219
00:14:44,275 --> 00:14:47,476
Please, everybody,
everybody just relax, okay?

220
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:50,487
He's right. Let's just stay cool.
Let's just try to figure out what happened.

221
00:14:50,512 --> 00:14:54,881
I'm sorry, I... I can't just stay here.
I have to get home to my kids.

222
00:14:54,906 --> 00:14:56,806
Ma'am, no, you can't go out there.

223
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,706
Could be a poisonous gas cloud.

224
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,304
Didn't you hear that man screaming?

225
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:02,970
I agree. Let's stay here
until we figure it out.

226
00:15:02,995 --> 00:15:04,564
You're not listening!

227
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,056
I can't stay here.

228
00:15:07,905 --> 00:15:11,739
Wanda's looking after little Victor.
She's only 8.

229
00:15:11,764 --> 00:15:15,632
Sometimes she forgets
she's supposed to be watching him.

230
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,212
I told them I'd only be gone
a few minutes.

231
00:15:23,154 --> 00:15:25,142
She's only 8.

232
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:27,781
For their sakes,

233
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:29,781
don't.

234
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:37,024
Well, isn't anybody gonna help me?

235
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,503
Shh. It's okay, pal.

236
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,462
Won't somebody here see a lady home?

237
00:15:50,244 --> 00:15:51,290
You?

238
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:00,102
You?

239
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,202
It's okay, buddy.

240
00:16:11,225 --> 00:16:11,845
You?

241
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,532
Ma'am, please,
I got my own boy to worry about.

242
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,855
I hope you all rot in hell.

243
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,681
Ma'am, please, wait until-

244
00:16:59,423 --> 00:17:01,744
Okay, let's start cleaning up, okay?

245
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,816
Get the spilled bottles, broken glass,
stuff like that.

246
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,962
Aisle three has medical supplies.

247
00:17:08,204 --> 00:17:10,125
It's okay. It's okay.

248
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,040
All right, easy, champ. Come on.

249
00:17:13,204 --> 00:17:17,603
Come on. All right, hey, hey, hey.
Can't keep crying like this, pal.

250
00:17:17,814 --> 00:17:18,879
Come on!

251
00:17:19,181 --> 00:17:20,948
Come on, you're gonna hurt yourself.

252
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:23,350
- Come on, are you all right?
- I want Mommy!

253
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,212
All right, I know you want Mommy.

254
00:17:25,322 --> 00:17:29,083
All right, just try to breathe.
Just try to breathe, okay?

255
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,150
Just try to breathe, pal. That's okay.
It's all right.

256
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:39,937
I haven't seen him suck his thumb
like this since he was 2 years old.

257
00:17:39,962 --> 00:17:41,407
He's in shock.

258
00:17:41,782 --> 00:17:43,303
I think we all are.

259
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,087
You haven't met.

260
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:49,111
Amanda Dunfrey.
She's new in town as of this semester.

261
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:54,825
Teaches third grade and the special ed
kids, now that Mosher's retired.

262
00:17:54,829 --> 00:17:56,868
She's wonderful. The kids love her.

263
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:02,728
And David's an artist.
He does movie posters and such.

264
00:18:02,753 --> 00:18:04,010
And me...

265
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:09,432
Lord, I'm babbling away
like some old biddy at a tea party!

266
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,079
My nerves are jangled, I guess.

267
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:12,332
Boy settle down?

268
00:18:12,494 --> 00:18:13,901
How is he?

269
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,095
Still hot.

270
00:18:15,113 --> 00:18:16,603
Why don't I get him some aspirin.

271
00:18:16,822 --> 00:18:18,135
- Aisle three.
- Okay.

272
00:18:18,674 --> 00:18:19,924
Thanks.

273
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,860
How's Dan?

274
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:26,299
His nose stopped bleedin'. He's calmer
now. Somebody gave him a Valium.

275
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:31,351
Can't believe the way he ran in here.
Never seen him like that.

276
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:35,172
I need something to cover my boy up.
Got any blankets?

277
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,658
Furniture pads. Loadin' dock.

278
00:18:38,165 --> 00:18:40,991
Gonna keep checkin' on people.
If you need anything, just holler.

279
00:18:41,016 --> 00:18:41,845
You bet.

280
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,131
Sally, you mind?

281
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,614
Oh, I'd love to. I really should
help him clean up.

282
00:18:45,639 --> 00:18:46,857
I'll take him.

283
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:47,804
Okay.

284
00:18:48,178 --> 00:18:48,951
Daddy, don't go.

285
00:18:48,976 --> 00:18:52,398
No, I'll be gone two seconds, Big Bill.
Come on, I'm gonna get your blanket.

286
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:56,029
Mrs. Reppler's here, and so is Mrs. Turman.

287
00:18:57,222 --> 00:18:58,712
I'll be close by, okay?

288
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,331
- Okay.
- Don't worry, I'm not far. Okay?

289
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,656
Let me look at you.

290
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,267
Hmm?

291
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,190
Wanna lie down?

292
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,204
Yeah.

293
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,546
There you go.

294
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:17,298
Soon as it blows away,
we can walk out of here safe and free,

295
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,881
but we have to be smart about it.

296
00:19:18,906 --> 00:19:21,568
First thing we need to do
is keep our wits about us

297
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,151
and find out what's happened.

298
00:19:23,176 --> 00:19:27,390
Well, Howe gonna do that, my man?
We've got no phone signal, got no radio.

299
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:29,975
I'm sure they're working
on those problems as we speak.

300
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,393
It stands to reason that restoring
communications would be their top priority.

301
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,043
Oh, shit.

302
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,002
Shit!

303
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,512
God damn it!

304
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,500
Bitch!

305
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:30,084
It's obvious that we're... we're in
some kind of natural disaster here.

306
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:32,885
Ain't nothin' obvious
about this sombitch from where I sit.

307
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,242
There ain't nothin' natural
about it either.

308
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,359
That's right.

309
00:20:36,384 --> 00:20:39,046
It's Judgment Day,
and it's come round at last.

310
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,562
There is nothing more obvious
or natural than that.

311
00:20:41,587 --> 00:20:43,218
Ohh, fuck, now.

312
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:46,843
You've done that to yourself,
by a life of sin and dissolution.

313
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,295
Hey, whoa! David!

314
00:21:35,313 --> 00:21:37,337
Hey, you guys hear that?

315
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,467
The generator?
We're just gonna check it out.

316
00:21:39,492 --> 00:21:43,617
No, no, I turned the generator off.
It... it was backing up.

317
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:46,585
N-Nobody else heard that sound?

318
00:21:46,591 --> 00:21:47,688
What sound?

319
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:53,807
I don't know, like a... weird noise,
back there in the dark.

320
00:21:53,932 --> 00:21:56,922
Like something was, like,
pressing against the door.

321
00:21:57,102 --> 00:22:00,027
Did you hear it
before the lights went out, or after?

322
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,633
No, only after.

323
00:22:02,034 --> 00:22:04,298
After, but, look, I heard it, okay?

324
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,382
- Nobody's calling you a liar.
- That's what it sounds like.

325
00:22:06,407 --> 00:22:09,069
No, no, no, no.
Now, don't be that away, Mr. Drayton.

326
00:22:09,391 --> 00:22:11,305
You had a scare, no doubt.

327
00:22:11,461 --> 00:22:13,040
What say we all go check it out?

328
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,289
Here.

329
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:23,797
Man.

330
00:22:23,922 --> 00:22:25,719
It's pretty rank in here.

331
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,871
- Myron, go check it out.
- All right.

332
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,992
Go on, fire it up.

333
00:22:42,024 --> 00:22:43,170
All right!

334
00:22:43,312 --> 00:22:44,404
Shut it off!

335
00:22:45,285 --> 00:22:47,141
Holy crow, don't that stink!

336
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,121
Something's got the exhaust vent
plugged up from the outside.

337
00:22:51,146 --> 00:22:53,733
You get it running long enough
to raise that door a little,

338
00:22:53,758 --> 00:22:55,248
I'll go out and clear
whatever's blockin' it.

339
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,543
No, no, you can't do that.

340
00:22:56,561 --> 00:22:58,552
Why not? It's an electric door, right?

341
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:01,569
Well, yeah, but it may not be wise
to send him out there.

342
00:23:01,594 --> 00:23:03,023
Okay, I'll do it.

343
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,219
No, look, it's not about
who goes out there.

344
00:23:05,227 --> 00:23:07,060
What, don't you think I can do it?

345
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,713
Hey! I want to go! It was my idea.

346
00:23:09,738 --> 00:23:11,524
Well, wait, just stop, okay?

347
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:13,124
- J-Jim, right?
- Mm-hmm.

348
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:15,570
Myron? You guys are...

349
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:19,321
you, well, you don't seem to understand,
or you're tryin' real hard not to.

350
00:23:19,346 --> 00:23:21,656
This is no ordinary mist, okay?

351
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,742
You open that door,
and something gets in here.

352
00:23:24,767 --> 00:23:25,927
Like what?

353
00:23:26,882 --> 00:23:28,782
Well, like whatever
made that noise I heard.

354
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,396
Are you guys being wilfully dense?

355
00:23:30,421 --> 00:23:36,141
Mr. Drayton, you'll pardon me, but I'm
not convinced that you heard anything.

356
00:23:36,475 --> 00:23:39,594
I mean, we're not hearing
anything now, right? Anybody?

357
00:23:40,728 --> 00:23:41,717
See?

358
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,166
Now, I know, I know...
you're a big shot artist

359
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,682
with connections in New York
and Hollywood and all like that,

360
00:23:48,707 --> 00:23:51,149
but that don't make you better
than anybody else, not in my book.

361
00:23:51,174 --> 00:23:52,539
Hey, I didn't say that.

362
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,896
Nor do I like being talked down to
or called stupid

363
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:57,978
by a guy who went to college,
just 'cause he's got the jitters.

364
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:01,603
Fellas, it doesn't even matter about
the generator. The food'll keep without it.

365
00:24:01,628 --> 00:24:04,358
Kid, I'm gonna start the motor,
you raise the door,

366
00:24:04,383 --> 00:24:06,205
and you yell out
when you got enough room.

367
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,754
Yeah. Okay, good.

368
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:08,883
Wait.

369
00:24:10,072 --> 00:24:10,922
This is...

370
00:24:10,947 --> 00:24:14,428
You guys gonna let this kid risk his life
over a generator that doesn't even matter?

371
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,886
Would you just shut the fuck up already?

372
00:24:15,911 --> 00:24:16,900
Norm!

373
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,313
Listen, Mr. Drayton, I tell you what.

374
00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:22,838
The next time you got somethin' to say,
you count your teeth,

375
00:24:22,863 --> 00:24:27,281
because I'm sick to death of your bullshit.
All right?

376
00:24:27,619 --> 00:24:28,608
Come on, Myron.

377
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,294
- This is crazy!
- Leave 'em be.

378
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,890
What am I, impugning
their manhood or something?

379
00:24:33,207 --> 00:24:35,166
Listen, they've lost
their sense of proportion.

380
00:24:35,191 --> 00:24:36,367
What's going on here?

381
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,353
Out there in the market,
they were scared and confused.

382
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:42,399
In here, there's a problem they can
solve, so they're goddamn gonna solve it.

383
00:24:42,434 --> 00:24:43,924
- Ready, kid?
- Let's rock.

384
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,412
Norm, come on.

385
00:24:45,437 --> 00:24:46,555
Don't, man.

386
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:51,915
It's a mistake.

387
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:57,689
Pussy.

388
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,293
Go up!

389
00:25:25,702 --> 00:25:26,666
So...

390
00:25:27,113 --> 00:25:28,603
...any boogeymen?

391
00:25:31,149 --> 00:25:32,639
Pretty scary, ain't it, Norm?

392
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:34,601
Yeah, right.

393
00:25:38,187 --> 00:25:39,176
Norm.

394
00:25:40,189 --> 00:25:41,311
Norm!

395
00:25:42,226 --> 00:25:43,149
What the fuck!

396
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:44,775
Get it off! Get it off!

397
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,507
Get this friggin' thing off me!

398
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,655
Get it off! Help me!

399
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,375
Help me! Help me!

400
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,155
Jesus!

401
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:06,619
There's more! There's more!

402
00:26:07,538 --> 00:26:08,733
Somebody help me.

403
00:26:10,351 --> 00:26:12,007
Somebody help me.

404
00:26:12,284 --> 00:26:14,061
What the fuck are you waitin' for?

405
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,538
Hang on!

406
00:26:37,991 --> 00:26:40,592
Hold him still! Hold him still!

407
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,265
Oh, Jesus!

408
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,636
Shit! Oh, shit!

409
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,569
Oh, shit!

410
00:27:29,487 --> 00:27:31,069
David, it's no good!

411
00:27:33,243 --> 00:27:34,515
Start the generator.

412
00:28:43,727 --> 00:28:45,332
Hey, I'm sorry.

413
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:51,293
I mean, how the... how the hell was
I supposed to know what you meant?

414
00:28:52,807 --> 00:28:54,684
You said you heard something.

415
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,629
How was I supposed to know what you meant?
You should've said what you meant better.

416
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:01,567
I don't know, I thought maybe
it was a big bird or somethin-

417
00:29:02,715 --> 00:29:04,384
You got that kid killed!

418
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:06,747
Did you get a good look at it? Huh?

419
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:09,653
Did you get a good look at what you did?

420
00:29:09,903 --> 00:29:10,875
- Huh?
- David!

421
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,409
Don't hit him anymore!
Doesn't solve anything!

422
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,524
You two assholes, you got that kid killed!

423
00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:17,754
And I got his fuckin' blood on me!

424
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:39,519
Okay, I'm done.

425
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:42,235
Okay.

426
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,074
What's next?

427
00:29:47,678 --> 00:29:49,202
Kill the generator.

428
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:51,464
That's the first thing.

429
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,291
I'm sorry.

430
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:03,011
Jesus Christ! Oh, God!

431
00:30:03,527 --> 00:30:06,261
I'm... I'm sorry about the kid.

432
00:30:07,663 --> 00:30:10,027
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

433
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:12,956
We oughta get out of here.

434
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:18,660
Hey, we didn't twist his arm.

435
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,152
Yeah, he's a fuckin' kid.
He's supposed to be stupid.

436
00:30:22,896 --> 00:30:24,667
What's your excuse, huh?

437
00:30:28,025 --> 00:30:29,356
Get outta here.

438
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:32,511
Go back in the market. Stay by the door.

439
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:36,433
Don't say anything, to anybody.

440
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,027
Not yet.

441
00:30:40,526 --> 00:30:41,761
Not yet.

442
00:30:56,638 --> 00:30:57,627
Shit.

443
00:30:58,308 --> 00:31:01,378
David? Need a little light here.

444
00:31:11,988 --> 00:31:13,612
We have to tell 'em.

445
00:31:13,863 --> 00:31:16,808
The people in the market,
we have to stop 'em going outside.

446
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,402
They won't believe us.

447
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:21,400
They have to.

448
00:31:21,603 --> 00:31:24,089
I'm not sure I believe it. I was here.

449
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:28,928
Wh-What we saw was impossible.
You know that, don't you?

450
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:30,433
I mean...

451
00:31:31,622 --> 00:31:33,253
what do we say?

452
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,949
How do we convince them?

453
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:44,089
Ollie, what the hell were
those tentacles even attached to?

454
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,806
Oh, my God! Are... are you all right?

455
00:31:51,831 --> 00:31:54,322
Shh! Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's not my blood. I'm fine.

456
00:31:54,347 --> 00:31:55,822
Wh-What the hell happened?

457
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,847
I'll explain. Give me a minute, okay?

458
00:31:58,089 --> 00:32:00,080
I need to deal with something first.

459
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,113
Please, I've got to...

460
00:32:03,777 --> 00:32:06,065
I can't let Billy see me like this.
He's scared enough.

461
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:09,003
Just give me a minute.
Keep him distracted. Okay?

462
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:10,017
Okay.

463
00:32:15,811 --> 00:32:18,774
Hey, look, I'm sorry about Norm.

464
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,164
Me too.

465
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:22,589
I mean, I ain't makin' excuses,
I'm just sayin'.

466
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,423
Look, we need to tell people.

467
00:32:24,448 --> 00:32:26,587
No need to say how it went down
or anything like that,

468
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:30,957
but, uh, we're in the deep shit here.
People need to know.

469
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:32,639
What about the out-of-towners?

470
00:32:32,664 --> 00:32:35,428
We got plenty of them in the store.
Where do we even start?

471
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,683
- Brent Norton?
- That windbag?

472
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:42,838
He's an important attorney in New York.
That fellow could be on the bench one day.

473
00:32:42,847 --> 00:32:45,338
Counts a lot with people of this town,
or... or anywhere.

474
00:32:45,382 --> 00:32:46,985
- Yeah, that's right.
- Do it quick, David.

475
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:49,943
We've got to discuss how we're gonna
stop that thing getting in here.

476
00:32:50,163 --> 00:32:52,065
W-Wait. What do you mean getting in?

477
00:32:52,356 --> 00:32:53,880
You shut the loading door.

478
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:57,714
Yeah, but the entire front of the store
is plate glass.

479
00:33:01,628 --> 00:33:03,303
Jesus Christ.

480
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,762
I was wondering where you'd gotten to.

481
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:20,119
Um, listen... that guy that came in
here, the one with the bloody nose...

482
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:28,855
...they're... they're... We saw tentacles.

483
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,901
Ain't goin' very well, is it?

484
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:32,667
Unh-unh.

485
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:36,019
- You... what?
- Come here, you've got...

486
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,142
Come here.

487
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,370
Tell him.

488
00:33:43,732 --> 00:33:44,901
It's true.

489
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,763
- Tentacles. 
- Yeah.

490
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:04,628
Um, gentlemen, um...

491
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,764
I'm sorry, I... I'm just not that stupid.
I mean, what do you take me for?

492
00:34:09,789 --> 00:34:11,206
I'm shocked.

493
00:34:12,026 --> 00:34:13,386
I'm shocked.

494
00:34:13,713 --> 00:34:15,561
I'm shocked. It's pretty tasteless

495
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:17,577
using what's happening here
to try to make me look like an idiot.

496
00:34:17,602 --> 00:34:19,263
No, no, that's not what's going on here.

497
00:34:19,288 --> 00:34:22,468
Look, come back to the loading dock, okay? 
I'll show you.

498
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:26,088
Blood. A chunk of tentacle
on... on the floor.

499
00:34:26,113 --> 00:34:27,102
No.

500
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,713
No? What do you mean no?

501
00:34:28,738 --> 00:34:31,408
No. We've got real problems
to deal with here,

502
00:34:31,433 --> 00:34:36,185
and this pathetic attempt at a joke
has gone far enough.

503
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,487
Mr. Norton, what reason
could we possibly have-

504
00:34:39,512 --> 00:34:41,243
Oh, please! Please!

505
00:34:41,268 --> 00:34:43,759
This is payback for the lawsuit
that I filed against him last year,

506
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,978
and you guys are backing him up.

507
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:47,485
So winning wasn't enough, huh?

508
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,203
You wanted to humiliate me some more,
show me a rubber snake

509
00:34:51,228 --> 00:34:53,547
while these... these hicks stand
around laughing their asses off.

510
00:34:53,572 --> 00:34:54,834
- Watch who you callin' a hick!
- Myron! Myron!

511
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,724
- Hey, hey, fuck...!
- Mr. Norton...

512
00:34:56,749 --> 00:34:59,343
...I swear, you have got us all wrong.

513
00:34:59,752 --> 00:35:04,014
You're not too crazy about,
um, out-of-towners, are you?

514
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:06,959
I only spend my money,
and I pay my taxes here,

515
00:35:06,984 --> 00:35:10,852
and I have seen you
talking behind my back.

516
00:35:12,628 --> 00:35:14,263
Y'all stick together.

517
00:35:17,521 --> 00:35:18,891
Well, don't I feel foolish?

518
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:21,407
I actually thought you were
being kind to me today,

519
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,105
and, well, thanks for setting me straight.

520
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:26,224
And I'm glad that tree fell on
your boathouse, you know that? Glad.

521
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,878
Smashed it in pretty good, didn't it?
Fantastic.

522
00:35:27,896 --> 00:35:29,402
Now, all of y'all, just stay out of my way.

523
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:32,348
I know you're scared, man.
I'm scared too.

524
00:35:32,373 --> 00:35:34,173
- Lives are at stake around here.
- David...

525
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:36,530
Okay, my son's life. Now, I need you.

526
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:40,265
Brent, please,
get your head out of your ass.

527
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:42,394
All right, I'll drag you back there 
if I have to.

528
00:35:42,419 --> 00:35:43,334
Come here.

529
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:48,428
David, get your goddamn hands off of me!
I'll sue your ass again!

530
00:35:48,453 --> 00:35:50,834
Sue your ass,
and this time you'll go to jail!

531
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,528
This man assaulted me.

532
00:35:52,561 --> 00:35:55,094
He assaulted me. You were witness to it.

533
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,114
This man's crazy. He's crazy-

534
00:35:56,133 --> 00:35:57,248
No.

535
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,289
He isn't. I wish he was, but he isn't.

536
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:06,623
E-Everyone in the store,
you want to come back here?

537
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:10,717
There's something you need to hear.
It concerns you all.

538
00:36:11,037 --> 00:36:11,797
Okay.

539
00:36:11,822 --> 00:36:15,092
W-Wait. I don't know
what you people think you're doing.

540
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:18,311
You're drinking? For Christ's sake, Ollie.

541
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,709
Do you want me to report you?
You want to lose your job?

542
00:36:22,123 --> 00:36:24,023
Look, I'm gonna be taking down names,
starting with you.

543
00:36:24,303 --> 00:36:26,058
And I am prepared to file a police report.

544
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,426
- Fine, Bud, write down your names.
- I will.

545
00:36:28,451 --> 00:36:31,139
But in the meantime,
shut the fuck up and listen.

546
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,695
This is Mr. David Drayton.

547
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,567
You need to hear what he's got to say
if you're thinking about leaving.

548
00:36:37,592 --> 00:36:40,472
Go hang out with the ladies, all right?
Listen, don't be scared.

549
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:43,722
It's okay.

550
00:36:45,976 --> 00:36:46,965
Okay.

551
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,436
This is how it is.

552
00:36:49,725 --> 00:36:52,319
Now, I don't know what this mist is,

553
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,424
but there are things in it, 
and they're dangerous, like Dan said.

554
00:36:55,448 --> 00:36:56,522
That's right.

555
00:36:57,139 --> 00:36:58,717
That's exactly right.

556
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,625
What kind of things?

557
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:04,565
I never saw it. It happened too fast.
I got knocked down.

558
00:37:04,873 --> 00:37:06,959
Five of us went back in the loading dock.

559
00:37:07,436 --> 00:37:10,194
It was Jim, Myron, Ollie,

560
00:37:10,772 --> 00:37:13,791
me, Norm, the bag boy.

561
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,736
- We opened the door...
- Where's Norm?

562
00:37:15,761 --> 00:37:19,086
...so Norm could go out
and clear the vent for the generator.

563
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,353
Something come out of the mist
and took him.

564
00:37:22,378 --> 00:37:23,367
Took him?

565
00:37:23,392 --> 00:37:24,803
What do you mean?

566
00:37:26,393 --> 00:37:27,553
Just... killed him.

567
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,443
I mean dragged him off.

568
00:37:29,468 --> 00:37:34,030
Now, guys,
I don't know what these things are.

569
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:37,014
All we saw were tentacles.

570
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,580
Tentacles?

571
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,588
Tentacles, he says.

572
00:37:46,982 --> 00:37:49,075
Tentacles from Planet X.

573
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:53,732
It's a lie, you know. I mean, all these
people do is just lie each other up.

574
00:37:53,753 --> 00:37:54,981
It's a pile of shit.

575
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:57,772
Of course it's a lie. Of course it's a lie.
It's lunacy.

576
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,136
From the look of it, the tentacles
are coming out of the beer cans.

577
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:04,170
All right, Bud, don't take our word for it.
Go look.

578
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:11,710
Over there.

579
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,053
What the hell is that?

580
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:54,904
It appears we may have a problem
of some magnitude here.

581
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,631
Yeah, just keep 'em in line. Thanks.

582
00:39:23,902 --> 00:39:25,563
Let me...

583
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:30,598
...help these people.

584
00:39:31,053 --> 00:39:34,561
Let me... let me preach your word.

585
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:41,670
Let me shine your light,
'cause they're not all bad.

586
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:44,911
They can't all be bad.

587
00:39:47,961 --> 00:39:51,842
Some can be saved, can't they?

588
00:39:52,209 --> 00:39:53,412
Yes.

589
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:59,525
Some can be brought...
to heaven's holy gates through your grace.

590
00:39:59,645 --> 00:40:05,623
I have to believe that, though I know
most will swim in the lake of fire forever.

591
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,951
If I can save a few...

592
00:40:12,051 --> 00:40:14,042
...even one...

593
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:17,733
...then my life will have counted
for something.

594
00:40:18,494 --> 00:40:24,719
I will have pulled my weight. I will
have earned my place at your side.

595
00:40:24,744 --> 00:40:29,293
I will have served a purpose
here on this earth.

596
00:40:29,318 --> 00:40:30,412
Hello?

597
00:40:46,858 --> 00:40:48,120
What?

598
00:40:48,496 --> 00:40:50,375
I just need to use the bathroom.

599
00:40:50,822 --> 00:40:51,811
Oh.

600
00:40:52,798 --> 00:40:55,198
Okay. Well, then, have at it.

601
00:40:59,145 --> 00:41:00,373
Ma'am...

602
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:04,933
I... I just want you to know
that it's okay...

603
00:41:05,404 --> 00:41:08,105
...being scared, I mean and...

604
00:41:08,551 --> 00:41:12,445
well, if you need a friend,
you know, someone to talk to.

605
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:18,484
I have a friend...
God up above. I talk to him every day.

606
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,500
Don't you condescend to me.

607
00:41:20,722 --> 00:41:21,754
I'm sorry?

608
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:25,097
Not ever. You don't mock me.

609
00:41:25,122 --> 00:41:27,090
That's not what I was doing.

610
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:32,488
Well, I'll tell you what...
the day I need a friend like you,

611
00:41:32,513 --> 00:41:35,443
I'll just have myself a little squat
and shit one out.

612
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,761
Maybe you do believe this.

613
00:41:42,786 --> 00:41:46,019
Maybe they're not lies,
they're delusions. Whatever.

614
00:41:46,044 --> 00:41:50,017
Uh, the fact remains, the evidence here
is flimsy. It's bordering on ludicrous.

615
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,669
Hey, this isn't a courtroom.

616
00:41:52,196 --> 00:41:53,185
You're not arguing a case,

617
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,910
and you're doing nothing but damage,
talking the way you are.

618
00:41:54,935 --> 00:41:57,890
And you can throw as much cow's blood
around the loading dock as you want to.

619
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:59,442
You still haven't fooled anyone.

620
00:41:59,467 --> 00:42:00,525
Leave it alone, David.

621
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:04,310
You can't convince some people there's
a fire even when their hair is burning.

622
00:42:04,335 --> 00:42:05,931
Denial is a powerful thing.

623
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:10,808
Well, keep talking. I'll have no part
of it, nor would any thinking person.

624
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:13,172
Keep thinking, Mr. Lawyer.

625
00:42:13,474 --> 00:42:16,175
There's no defense against the will of God.

626
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,395
There's no court of appeals in hell.

627
00:42:19,013 --> 00:42:20,960
There's no defense here, either.

628
00:42:20,985 --> 00:42:23,215
Not even with all the fertilizer
in the world,

629
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,731
not even if you stack it
as high as you can.

630
00:42:25,756 --> 00:42:28,387
It's still just bags of shit, isn't it?

631
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,508
Those of you who want to discuss
this thing rationally

632
00:42:30,533 --> 00:42:34,326
to find a means of rescue
are welcome to join me.

633
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:37,247
Those who want to stack dog food,

634
00:42:37,676 --> 00:42:39,245
knock yourselves out.

635
00:42:42,818 --> 00:42:46,189
We got those windows taped up
as best we could. It should help.

636
00:42:46,214 --> 00:42:47,763
Yeah, think so?

637
00:42:49,632 --> 00:42:51,802
Duct tape and dog food bags.

638
00:42:53,716 --> 00:42:55,047
That bad?

639
00:42:55,141 --> 00:42:56,130
It's not good.

640
00:42:56,155 --> 00:42:59,318
There's none so blind
as those who will not see.

641
00:43:00,629 --> 00:43:04,510
Open your eyes.
Let the scales fall away.

642
00:43:04,683 --> 00:43:06,674
This has all been written.

643
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:11,463
Revelations, chapter 15:

644
00:43:11,759 --> 00:43:16,071
"And the temple was filled with smoke
from the glory of God

645
00:43:16,096 --> 00:43:19,494
"and from his power,
and no one could enter the temple

646
00:43:19,505 --> 00:43:23,583
until the seven plagues of the seven angels
were completed."

647
00:43:23,779 --> 00:43:25,579
Well, what are you saying?

648
00:43:25,648 --> 00:43:27,088
What are you proposing?

649
00:43:27,113 --> 00:43:29,052
That we all prepare...

650
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:31,862
...to meet our Maker.

651
00:43:31,878 --> 00:43:34,039
Oh, prepare to meet shit!

652
00:43:34,831 --> 00:43:39,281
Lady, your tongue must be hung in the
middle so that it can waggle at both ends.

653
00:43:39,306 --> 00:43:43,097
The end time has come,
not in flames, but in mist.

654
00:43:43,122 --> 00:43:44,063
Come here!

655
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,214
Easy! Back off!

656
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:49,435
How about if your ass prepares to meet
my size-10 work boot. How about that?

657
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,271
Hey, there's no call for that.

658
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:53,639
Myron, please, calm your friend down.

659
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:56,524
I'm trying to save your soul,
you stupid man.

660
00:43:56,549 --> 00:43:58,744
- Doubters will doubt till the end.
- It's okay.

661
00:43:58,769 --> 00:43:59,878
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

662
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:02,497
A monstrosity did pull that poor boy away.

663
00:44:03,118 --> 00:44:06,485
Things in the mist... do you doubt?

664
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,720
Do you?

665
00:44:09,122 --> 00:44:10,767
Then go out.

666
00:44:11,243 --> 00:44:13,492
Go out and say, "How do you do."

667
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:14,837
Shut up, lady.

668
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,640
For God's sakes.

669
00:44:17,665 --> 00:44:19,732
Look, you'll have to stop now.
You're scaring the children.

670
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,156
They should be scared.

671
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:24,259
Oh, yes, they should.

672
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:30,128
Their beautiful, pure little minds
have been corrupted with lies.

673
00:44:30,154 --> 00:44:31,143
Lies.

674
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:35,861
All this talk of a modern God,
or no God.

675
00:44:36,155 --> 00:44:37,816
There is one God.

676
00:44:38,064 --> 00:44:39,751
The God of the Israelites.

677
00:44:40,013 --> 00:44:45,091
And he is a stern and vengeful God,
and we have been mocking him far too long,

678
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:48,778
and now he demands retribution in blood.

679
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:52,109
It is time to declare yourselves.

680
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:55,254
Take sides...
the saved and the damned.

681
00:44:55,279 --> 00:44:58,771
Read the Good Book. It calls for expiation.

682
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:00,627
- Blood!
- What?

683
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,915
Blood.

684
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:07,741
Little Normie was first,
and now God calls the rest of us.

685
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:10,935
The bill is due. It must be paid.

686
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,467
As Abraham prepared to sacrifice 
his only son to prove his love for God, so-

687
00:45:15,492 --> 00:45:16,978
Enough.

688
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,932
Another down payment.
A few more pennies in the jar.

689
00:45:27,142 --> 00:45:30,164
Now, that's nice, see.
I can't smack her, but it's okay for you.

690
00:45:30,189 --> 00:45:31,437
I-I'm sorry everybody,

691
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:34,454
but this lady's perspective is
a little too Old Testament for my taste.

692
00:45:34,711 --> 00:45:36,353
They'll come for you.

693
00:45:37,196 --> 00:45:39,687
Maybe tonight, when darkness comes.

694
00:45:41,148 --> 00:45:44,618
They'll come tonight,
and they'll take someone else.

695
00:45:44,822 --> 00:45:46,118
See if they don't.

696
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:50,792
And when they do, you will cry to God,

697
00:45:50,812 --> 00:45:54,546
and you will beg Mother Carmody
to show you the way.

698
00:45:54,571 --> 00:45:55,902
That's fine.

699
00:45:56,892 --> 00:46:01,523
But until then, if you don't shut up,
I'll wrap this tape around your mouth.

700
00:46:01,548 --> 00:46:03,671
You just try it, Ollie Weeks.

701
00:46:03,696 --> 00:46:05,186
And you, bitch...

702
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:10,361
...you hit me again if you dare.

703
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:14,478
You'll be on your knees to me
before this is through.

704
00:46:20,864 --> 00:46:23,453
Those of you who aren't local
should know that Mrs. Carmody

705
00:46:23,462 --> 00:46:27,459
is known in town for being... unstable.

706
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:31,173
No shit. What was your first clue?

707
00:46:34,144 --> 00:46:35,204
Shh.

708
00:46:36,438 --> 00:46:37,712
Hi.

709
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,651
What's up, little dude?

710
00:46:39,676 --> 00:46:41,637
How come your friends don't come get us?

711
00:46:41,662 --> 00:46:45,885
They got tanks and stuff, right?
Why can't you just call 'em?

712
00:46:46,251 --> 00:46:47,516
Phones don't work.

713
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,072
But don't you got, like, a radio?

714
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,703
Hey, champ, what's going on?

715
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:52,771
I want their friends to come rescue us.

716
00:46:52,796 --> 00:46:54,945
They would if they could, pal.
They're stuck here just like us.

717
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:56,025
- But...
- Shh.

718
00:46:56,066 --> 00:46:57,904
Now, guys, we could use a hand over there.

719
00:46:57,923 --> 00:46:58,901
Yeah, sure thing.

720
00:46:58,926 --> 00:47:00,359
Troop, off your asses.

721
00:47:00,837 --> 00:47:03,495
- You all right?
- I don't like that scary lady.

722
00:47:03,814 --> 00:47:05,852
Oh, man, I don't either.

723
00:47:06,477 --> 00:47:07,944
But you know what?

724
00:47:08,337 --> 00:47:10,501
Maybe she's scared too.

725
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:12,423
You think?

726
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:15,126
You think Mommy's okay?

727
00:47:17,197 --> 00:47:18,376
Billy...

728
00:47:21,133 --> 00:47:23,139
I'm sorry about the times I was bad to her.

729
00:47:23,164 --> 00:47:24,283
Aw, hey.

730
00:47:25,293 --> 00:47:30,079
Mommy loves you very much.
And I'll bet she's fine.

731
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:33,792
And I promise you,

732
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:37,095
I'm gonna do everything I can
to get us back to her.

733
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,015
- Okay?
- 'Kay.

734
00:47:40,883 --> 00:47:42,316
- Yeah?
- 'Kay.

735
00:47:43,751 --> 00:47:47,694
So, we can use the charcoal fluid 
and the mops to make torches.

736
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,828
And we've got knives and stuff, God knows.

737
00:47:49,864 --> 00:47:55,079
This may be a silly question, Bud, but...
do you happen to have a gun in the store?

738
00:47:56,134 --> 00:47:59,570
Here? No. Please. 
This... this isn't Los Angeles.

739
00:47:59,595 --> 00:48:01,595
I've got a shotgun in my truck.

740
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:04,236
I could try for it if you want.

741
00:48:04,261 --> 00:48:06,525
Oh, God, I don't think 
that'd be a good idea, Mr. Cornell.

742
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,743
Hold on.

743
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,520
This gun, um...

744
00:48:11,947 --> 00:48:13,532
...my husband's idea.

745
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,650
He's away on business a lot.

746
00:48:15,675 --> 00:48:16,835
It's not even loaded.

747
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,487
Ain't much use unloaded, ma'am.

748
00:48:18,512 --> 00:48:19,501
Um...

749
00:48:23,092 --> 00:48:24,710
You know how to use that?

750
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:28,079
Well, I shot it once on a pistol range.
Hit the target a few times.

751
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:31,366
So, we got a gun.

752
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:35,165
Anybody know how to shoot it?
Well, I mean?

753
00:48:35,191 --> 00:48:36,251
I do.

754
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:39,708
You?

755
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:42,790
Ollie. Please.

756
00:48:48,415 --> 00:48:51,837
Some target shooting.
State champion in '94.

757
00:48:52,307 --> 00:48:54,509
- You're crazy if you go out there!
- Let us pass!

758
00:48:54,704 --> 00:48:56,131
Let us pass, please!

759
00:48:56,156 --> 00:48:57,242
Let's just talk this thing through.

760
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,428
We have, and we've made our decision.
We're leaving.

761
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:02,568
Hey, Mr. Mackey's gonna barbecue
some chicken on the gas grill.

762
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,983
- Why don't we just sit down and just...
- What, and let you keep on talking?

763
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:07,202
No, I've been in far too many
courtrooms to fall for that.

764
00:49:07,227 --> 00:49:09,354
You've already psyched out
half a dozen of my people already.

765
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:10,368
Your people?

766
00:49:10,393 --> 00:49:12,548
What kind of talk is that?
They're people, that's all.

767
00:49:12,573 --> 00:49:14,033
Now... now listen, everyone.

768
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:17,082
We are experiencing some kind of disaster.

769
00:49:17,118 --> 00:49:18,964
I don't know whether
it's man-made or natural,

770
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:23,839
but I do know that it's definitely
not supernatural or biblical,

771
00:49:23,853 --> 00:49:25,304
and, no offense, Mrs. Carmody,

772
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:29,001
but the only way we're gonna
help ourselves is to seek rescue.

773
00:49:30,762 --> 00:49:31,908
We're going out.

774
00:49:34,289 --> 00:49:36,348
- Brent, look.
- I'm not discussing this any further.

775
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:38,681
I know. I just want to ask a favor.

776
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:41,733
Tie this around your waist.

777
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,086
What for?

778
00:49:43,111 --> 00:49:45,415
It'll let us know 
you got at least 300 feet.

779
00:49:47,524 --> 00:49:48,720
I'll do it.

780
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,633
Are you throwing in with them?

781
00:49:51,658 --> 00:49:53,329
Me? No thanks.

782
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:56,523
I think your man there
is a little too tightly wound.

783
00:49:56,548 --> 00:49:58,290
Gonna get somebody killed.

784
00:49:58,541 --> 00:50:01,572
But I'm thinkin' we could use
that shotgun of yours.

785
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:04,076
I saw where you parked
when I pulled in.

786
00:50:04,322 --> 00:50:06,311
Red pickup, right? Far entrance?

787
00:50:06,555 --> 00:50:08,546
Son, you got brass balls.

788
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,149
The shells are in the glove compartment.

789
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,392
Drive it back.

790
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,701
All right. 
Just see they're paying out this line.

791
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:21,440
Line's up, I'll cut her loose,
just so you understand.

792
00:50:21,465 --> 00:50:22,493
Yeah.

793
00:50:30,171 --> 00:50:32,503
You sure there's no way
I can talk you out of this?

794
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:37,733
David, there's nothing out there. 
Nothing in the mist.

795
00:50:38,211 --> 00:50:39,923
What if you're wrong?

796
00:50:40,781 --> 00:50:42,587
Then, I guess...

797
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:47,681
...the joke would be on me after all.

798
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:54,400
We're gonna send back help.

799
00:50:55,206 --> 00:50:57,538
You'll die out there. All of you.

800
00:51:10,487 --> 00:51:13,456
Hey, crazy lady, I believe in God too.

801
00:51:13,481 --> 00:51:17,504
I just don't think he's the bloodthirsty
asshole you make him out to be.

802
00:51:17,529 --> 00:51:20,352
Well, you take that up with the devil
when you run into him.

803
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:22,048
You just chat it over at your leisure.

804
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,991
Well, let's strike out toward 
the center of town.

805
00:51:51,959 --> 00:51:53,272
Keep it loose.

806
00:52:09,129 --> 00:52:11,679
Nice and easy. Keep going.

807
00:52:29,726 --> 00:52:30,715
Look.

808
00:52:33,935 --> 00:52:35,072
It's going.

809
00:52:37,023 --> 00:52:38,183
They're doing good.

810
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:57,267
Put it down!

811
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:00,597
Pull!

812
00:53:02,323 --> 00:53:05,111
Oh, my God! I'm slippin'!

813
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:08,748
Pull! Back up! Back up!
Back up!

814
00:53:22,243 --> 00:53:23,232
Get it off!

815
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:33,757
Oh, my God.

816
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:41,750
- Aw, sh...
- Blood!

817
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:43,547
Awww, sh...

818
00:53:43,572 --> 00:53:45,233
Oh, my God!

819
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:48,991
Oh, my God!

820
00:54:03,702 --> 00:54:04,763
Cut the rope!

821
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:08,537
Shut the door!

822
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,357
Now do you see?

823
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,912
Now do you believe?

824
00:54:28,989 --> 00:54:31,331
About a half-hour of daylight left.

825
00:54:32,331 --> 00:54:34,148
Guys, how's it going
with these work lights?

826
00:54:34,173 --> 00:54:35,925
We're gettin' 'em rigged up all right.

827
00:54:36,329 --> 00:54:37,758
Yeah, check it out.

828
00:54:38,136 --> 00:54:40,308
All right, all right. Save it, save it.

829
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:42,448
These batteries ain't topped up.

830
00:54:42,589 --> 00:54:44,564
You turn the lights on,
it's gonna drain 'em quick.

831
00:54:44,589 --> 00:54:45,547
How quick?

832
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:47,774
- Five minutes, maybe ten.
- Yeah, if that.

833
00:54:47,799 --> 00:54:49,948
Okay, emergencies only.

834
00:54:50,677 --> 00:54:52,550
If something gets in the store.

835
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,585
Holy Jesus, you scared the shit outta me.

836
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:04,261
Oh, Sally, I'm sorry, really.

837
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:08,503
I thought I'd come in and say hi
and see how you were holding up.

838
00:55:09,082 --> 00:55:10,572
- Hi.
- Hi.

839
00:55:11,176 --> 00:55:12,691
Barely. How about you?

840
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:16,863
I'm worried about my folks, I guess.
You know, they live up on Shorm Road.

841
00:55:16,888 --> 00:55:18,913
That's less than five miles from here.

842
00:55:19,262 --> 00:55:20,866
How 'bout yours?

843
00:55:20,891 --> 00:55:25,840
Well, they're out of town right now.
They're at my aunt's in Boston, so...

844
00:55:25,865 --> 00:55:28,629
That's lucky. That means they're okay.

845
00:55:29,088 --> 00:55:30,418
I hope so.

846
00:55:32,474 --> 00:55:35,913
So... how soon you shipping out?

847
00:55:36,255 --> 00:55:38,152
Uh, couple weeks.

848
00:55:39,388 --> 00:55:41,254
Scared about going over there?

849
00:55:42,229 --> 00:55:43,199
Yeah.

850
00:55:48,657 --> 00:55:50,215
- Hey, Wayne?
- Hmm?

851
00:55:51,171 --> 00:55:53,074
How come you never asked me out?

852
00:55:53,966 --> 00:55:56,738
We flirted all through high school.
I know you like me.

853
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,199
So how come?

854
00:56:04,677 --> 00:56:06,621
I'm stupid, I guess.

855
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,181
Oh, shit! I'm sorry.

856
00:56:25,206 --> 00:56:26,548
Don't be. I just...

857
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:29,806
I just didn't really want it
to happen like this, you know?

858
00:56:29,831 --> 00:56:32,026
Some shitty locker room at work.

859
00:56:33,054 --> 00:56:35,072
Can we just stay in here a while, then?

860
00:56:35,987 --> 00:56:37,876
I mean, just... just you and me.

861
00:56:49,788 --> 00:56:52,073
The parking lot lamps turned on.

862
00:56:52,452 --> 00:56:53,435
They're on a timer.

863
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,444
Must be a different one that's live.

864
00:56:55,741 --> 00:57:00,210
Maybe we could tie into them somehow,
get some electricity in here.

865
00:57:01,153 --> 00:57:03,187
That'd mean walking out the door.

866
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:15,760
God!

867
00:57:16,222 --> 00:57:17,689
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

868
00:57:17,882 --> 00:57:19,679
David! David!

869
00:57:23,407 --> 00:57:24,499
Look!

870
00:57:47,895 --> 00:57:49,106
My God.

871
00:58:04,538 --> 00:58:06,291
Are those bugs?

872
00:58:07,941 --> 00:58:09,580
Not like any I've ever seen.

873
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:14,688
"They came out of the smoke,
locusts upon the earth,

874
00:58:14,713 --> 00:58:21,214
"and unto them was given power even
as the scorpions of the earth have power."

875
00:58:21,752 --> 00:58:22,791
Wow.

876
00:58:24,385 --> 00:58:26,471
Look at those stingers.

877
00:58:29,796 --> 00:58:31,619
Dear God.

878
00:59:10,868 --> 00:59:12,358
Holy shit!

879
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:30,057
Myron, get the ones in the back!

880
00:59:31,405 --> 00:59:33,236
God, I think they're attracted
to the light.

881
00:59:33,916 --> 00:59:35,491
Look out, look out, look out!

882
00:59:35,562 --> 00:59:37,096
The light! Douse the light!

883
00:59:38,331 --> 00:59:39,662
Look out! Look out!

884
00:59:44,668 --> 00:59:45,930
Move! Move!

885
00:59:47,822 --> 00:59:49,885
Light, light, light, light, light!

886
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:55,219
"And there came a voice from the temple 
saying to the seven angels,

887
00:59:55,244 --> 01:00:01,748
"'Go your ways and pour out the vials
of the wrath of God upon the earth."'

888
01:00:10,663 --> 01:00:13,244
Ollie, the glass is gonna give!

889
01:00:20,907 --> 01:00:21,799
Shit!

890
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:23,707
Oh, my God, they turned on all the lights!

891
01:00:23,713 --> 01:00:25,518
- Jim! Myron!
- Fire!

892
01:00:25,543 --> 01:00:27,109
- Fire! Lighter!
- Douse the lights!

893
01:00:27,299 --> 01:00:28,752
Come on, come on!

894
01:00:32,685 --> 01:00:33,674
Whoa!

895
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:42,854
Sally, look out!

896
01:00:44,691 --> 01:00:45,680
No!

897
01:00:54,195 --> 01:00:56,284
Let me see, let me see.
Let me see, sweetheart, let me see.

898
01:00:56,309 --> 01:00:58,340
No, you're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

899
01:00:58,363 --> 01:00:59,660
Let me see. Let me see.

900
01:00:59,664 --> 01:01:01,122
You're fine. You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

901
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,913
Give me the lighter! Put it on fire!

902
01:01:02,939 --> 01:01:03,928
Come on!

903
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:12,882
Goddamn childproofing sons of bitches!

904
01:01:14,794 --> 01:01:17,058
Oh, shoot it! Shoot it!

905
01:01:18,945 --> 01:01:20,408
Shoot it! Shoot it!

906
01:01:20,433 --> 01:01:22,060
I can't! I'll smash the window!

907
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:24,142
God!

908
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:25,945
Oh, God! Ohh!

909
01:01:28,647 --> 01:01:29,851
Go! Go!

910
01:01:31,892 --> 01:01:33,351
Get down!

911
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,255
Shit!

912
01:01:51,074 --> 01:01:53,091
- Ollie, you want these lights on or off?
- Leave 'em on.

913
01:01:59,272 --> 01:02:00,364
Oh, God!

914
01:02:02,184 --> 01:02:03,270
Kill it!

915
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:14,318
Bring torches!
Bring something to keep 'em out!

916
01:02:14,323 --> 01:02:15,252
Come on.

917
01:02:17,182 --> 01:02:18,342
Sally!

918
01:02:30,071 --> 01:02:32,301
Where are the goddamn extinguishers?

919
01:02:42,849 --> 01:02:44,180
Get it! Get it! Get it!

920
01:02:49,823 --> 01:02:52,567
Bring torches.
We need torches at the window!

921
01:02:52,787 --> 01:02:54,143
Plug that hole!

922
01:03:01,734 --> 01:03:02,455
Dad!

923
01:03:08,782 --> 01:03:10,477
Down! Down! Lay down!

924
01:03:27,121 --> 01:03:28,110
My life...

925
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:32,538
My life for you, your will be done.

926
01:03:46,526 --> 01:03:47,620
Daddy!

927
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:49,651
Daddy!

928
01:04:05,594 --> 01:04:07,709
- No! Billy!
- Daddy!

929
01:04:07,906 --> 01:04:09,570
- Billy!
- Daddy!

930
01:04:23,094 --> 01:04:24,000
Billy!

931
01:04:24,695 --> 01:04:26,445
- Dad!
- Billy, come back here.

932
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:30,461
- Dad!
- Billy, please!

933
01:04:36,872 --> 01:04:38,008
Billy!

934
01:05:07,157 --> 01:05:10,419
- Come on, let's move it!
- Somebody please come over here and help.

935
01:05:10,733 --> 01:05:12,394
Here's some tape!

936
01:05:14,108 --> 01:05:16,269
I'm right here.
I'm right here. Don't worry.

937
01:05:17,251 --> 01:05:19,185
Hurry up with the blankets!

938
01:05:19,472 --> 01:05:22,216
It hurts so bad! Please!

939
01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:31,687
It hurts so bad!

940
01:05:32,051 --> 01:05:33,443
Block it up here.

941
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,883
Get me some more bags!

942
01:05:36,989 --> 01:05:39,763
Did we get 'em? Did we get 'em all?

943
01:05:40,526 --> 01:05:42,060
She was right.

944
01:05:42,576 --> 01:05:47,208
She said that it would happen like this.
She said that they would come at night.

945
01:05:47,945 --> 01:05:50,169
She told us someone would die.

946
01:06:14,883 --> 01:06:16,357
Mommy.

947
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:22,201
Oh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay.
It's okay, it was just a dream.

948
01:06:23,114 --> 01:06:24,669
It's just a bad dream.

949
01:06:25,304 --> 01:06:27,067
I want my mommy.

950
01:06:27,446 --> 01:06:31,130
I know. I know. Of course you do.

951
01:06:31,143 --> 01:06:33,703
- Shh.
- I wanna go home.

952
01:06:33,982 --> 01:06:35,472
Just sleep.

953
01:06:36,734 --> 01:06:38,849
Everything'll be better in the morning.

954
01:06:45,233 --> 01:06:46,865
Think he likes you.

955
01:06:49,051 --> 01:06:51,154
Well, I hate that I had to lie to him.

956
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:54,431
You have kids?

957
01:06:54,458 --> 01:06:55,476
No.

958
01:06:55,993 --> 01:07:00,802
I always wanted to, but...
things haven't been working out.

959
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:05,841
Right now I'm thinking
maybe that's for the best.

960
01:07:07,388 --> 01:07:12,444
I saw creatures fly into the store tonight 
that... they shouldn't exist.

961
01:07:13,953 --> 01:07:16,444
I keep thinking 
I'm gonna wake up in a rubber room.

962
01:07:18,253 --> 01:07:19,810
You're not alone in that.

963
01:07:20,192 --> 01:07:22,122
We're all right there with you.

964
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:24,927
This isn't gonna end, is it?

965
01:07:27,763 --> 01:07:28,752
David.

966
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,110
It's Joe. He's getting worse.

967
01:07:51,122 --> 01:07:52,326
Joe.

968
01:07:53,799 --> 01:07:55,841
How you holdin' up, partner?

969
01:07:56,454 --> 01:07:59,747
David... is that you?

970
01:08:00,213 --> 01:08:01,966
Yeah, pal, how you doin'?

971
01:08:02,927 --> 01:08:05,246
It's bad. He's bad.

972
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:08,242
Didn't know anything could hurt like this.

973
01:08:08,681 --> 01:08:11,232
If you guys can't help me...

974
01:08:12,757 --> 01:08:15,055
...y-you gotta end it, okay?

975
01:08:17,283 --> 01:08:19,683
Ollie's got that gun, right?

976
01:08:21,294 --> 01:08:23,364
- Right?
- No. No way.

977
01:08:23,389 --> 01:08:28,002
You can't fuck with me on this, bro.
Not with me like this.

978
01:08:28,442 --> 01:08:32,397
I'll do it. Just give me the gun.

979
01:08:32,431 --> 01:08:33,833
Hey, hey. Shh.

980
01:08:34,023 --> 01:08:37,117
- We're not there yet, okay?
- Oh, please!

981
01:08:37,521 --> 01:08:38,958
Joe, now, listen.

982
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:43,399
Pal... we're gonna work something out.

983
01:08:43,424 --> 01:08:46,202
I just need you to hang in a little longer,
okay? Can we do that?

984
01:08:50,355 --> 01:08:52,372
Stay with him. I'll be back.

985
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:59,380
Hattie, I need to go to the bathroom.
Will you watch Billy?

986
01:09:01,327 --> 01:09:02,544
Hattie.

987
01:09:19,234 --> 01:09:20,607
See anything?

988
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:24,154
The last of those bugs
went away about four.

989
01:09:24,282 --> 01:09:25,677
Dawn's coming.

990
01:09:26,502 --> 01:09:27,833
What's on your mind?

991
01:09:27,858 --> 01:09:29,013
It's Joe.

992
01:09:30,712 --> 01:09:33,631
We don't get him on some serious
antibiotics, he's gonna die of infection.

993
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:36,176
Plus he needs painkillers in the worst way.

994
01:09:36,185 --> 01:09:39,774
All... all... all we got here
is liquor and aspirin.

995
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:42,724
You... You thinkin' about goin'
to that pharmacy next door?

996
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:46,584
Irene Reppler says they've got Silvadene...
you know, the stuff they use in burn wards.

997
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:47,771
She knows where they keep it.

998
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:50,649
Slow down. You can't actually 
be thinkin' of doin' this.

999
01:09:50,675 --> 01:09:52,575
I'm also thinkin' beyond that.

1000
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:56,580
We have to get out of here.
I mean permanently.

1001
01:09:56,605 --> 01:09:58,971
Why? We got plenty to eat!

1002
01:09:58,996 --> 01:10:01,829
What happens when one of those things
decides to break through this window?

1003
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:04,830
I'm talkin' one of the big ones,
like the one that killed Norm.

1004
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:07,568
Yeah, and that flaming torch idea
didn't work so well, did it?

1005
01:10:07,593 --> 01:10:10,061
We almost burned the goddamn store down.

1006
01:10:16,095 --> 01:10:17,426
It's Hattie.

1007
01:10:24,169 --> 01:10:25,329
Here?

1008
01:10:25,413 --> 01:10:27,672
All right, gently, now. Gently.

1009
01:10:27,697 --> 01:10:29,811
One... two... three.

1010
01:10:39,318 --> 01:10:43,493
I don't know how long she was there
like that, lying there next to us.

1011
01:10:43,512 --> 01:10:45,173
I thought she was sleeping.

1012
01:10:46,145 --> 01:10:49,459
I got my 4-wheel drive. It's out there.

1013
01:10:49,722 --> 01:10:51,629
Y-You're talking about leaving?

1014
01:10:52,538 --> 01:10:56,060
Well, we... should hit the pharmacy first.

1015
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,337
We gotta bring back supplies 
for the injured.

1016
01:10:58,362 --> 01:11:01,418
I mean, if we don't, Joe Eagleton's
gonna die, and we can't let that happen.

1017
01:11:02,165 --> 01:11:03,325
But after that...

1018
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:05,893
Look, my Land Cruiser
can hold eight people.

1019
01:11:05,918 --> 01:11:07,948
I say we drive south
as far as the fuel takes us

1020
01:11:07,973 --> 01:11:09,777
and try to get clear of this mist.

1021
01:11:10,606 --> 01:11:11,934
That's it?

1022
01:11:12,436 --> 01:11:13,767
That's the plan?

1023
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:14,930
That's what I got.

1024
01:11:14,954 --> 01:11:17,805
No, you can't mean it. Not after 
what happened to Norton and his group.

1025
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:20,298
No, no, no. Amanda, think.

1026
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:24,034
Norton got over 200 feet from this store.
That's how much rope played out.

1027
01:11:24,055 --> 01:11:26,580
I'm parked half that distance
from here.

1028
01:11:26,605 --> 01:11:30,217
But who knows how far this mist has spread?
It could be the entire eastern seaboard.

1029
01:11:30,242 --> 01:11:32,815
Yeah, it could be the whole world,
for all we know.

1030
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:35,823
Wouldn't make us any less dead,
now, would it?

1031
01:11:35,941 --> 01:11:37,725
We have one gun.

1032
01:11:38,004 --> 01:11:39,793
- How many rounds?
- We got ten left.

1033
01:11:39,818 --> 01:11:41,098
Ten rounds. Jesus.

1034
01:11:41,123 --> 01:11:42,957
Okay, so ten.

1035
01:11:43,742 --> 01:11:47,504
Want another reason to get the hell
out of here? I'll give you the best one.

1036
01:11:48,093 --> 01:11:49,082
Her.

1037
01:11:50,018 --> 01:11:54,334
Mrs. Carmody. She's our very own Jim Jones.

1038
01:11:54,562 --> 01:11:57,078
I'd like to leave before 
people start drinking the Kool-Aid.

1039
01:11:57,103 --> 01:12:00,548
He's right. Flakier people get, 
the better she's gonna look.

1040
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:03,407
No, I don't buy that. 
It's obvious she's nuts.

1041
01:12:03,426 --> 01:12:04,852
Look, a few people maybe, but-

1042
01:12:04,877 --> 01:12:07,175
No, I count four.
She's preachin' to 'em right now.

1043
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,839
By noon, she'll have four more.

1044
01:12:08,878 --> 01:12:12,720
By tomorrow night, when those things
come back, she'll have a congregation,

1045
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:16,331
and then we can start worryin'
about who she's gonna sacrifice

1046
01:12:16,356 --> 01:12:18,079
to make it all better.

1047
01:12:18,104 --> 01:12:19,275
Hmm?

1048
01:12:19,782 --> 01:12:22,922
You, Amanda? My little boy?

1049
01:12:23,275 --> 01:12:24,638
He's right.

1050
01:12:24,881 --> 01:12:27,423
You don't have much faith in humanity,
do you?

1051
01:12:28,219 --> 01:12:29,349
None whatsoever.

1052
01:12:29,354 --> 01:12:30,972
I can't accept that.

1053
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,661
People are basically good, decent.

1054
01:12:33,686 --> 01:12:35,998
My God, David, we're a civilized society.

1055
01:12:36,023 --> 01:12:38,817
Sure, as long as the machines
are workin' and you can dial 9-1-1,

1056
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:42,229
but you take those things away,
you throw people in the dark,

1057
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:45,991
you scare the shit out of them,
no more rules,

1058
01:12:46,016 --> 01:12:47,843
you'll see how primitive they get.

1059
01:12:47,868 --> 01:12:52,875
You scare people badly enough,
you can get 'em to do anything.

1060
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:58,158
They'll turn to whoever
promises a solution, or whatever.

1061
01:12:58,183 --> 01:13:00,343
Ollie, please, back me up here.

1062
01:13:00,368 --> 01:13:01,942
I wish I could.

1063
01:13:02,184 --> 01:13:04,765
As a species, we're fundamentally insane.

1064
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:07,154
Put more than two of us in a room,

1065
01:13:07,179 --> 01:13:10,306
we pick sides and start dreaming up reasons
to kill one another.

1066
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:13,913
Why do you think we invented
politics and religion?

1067
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:17,606
Oh, Jesus, that's just... wrong.

1068
01:13:17,631 --> 01:13:20,108
Look, nobody has to decide anything now,
okay?

1069
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,822
First things first,

1070
01:13:22,424 --> 01:13:23,571
the pharmacy.

1071
01:13:24,823 --> 01:13:27,547
That'll be our test run. Okay?

1072
01:13:37,968 --> 01:13:41,382
It's all right, Big Bill. I'm gonna
bring you back some comic books.

1073
01:13:41,407 --> 01:13:42,738
I don't want them.

1074
01:13:43,124 --> 01:13:44,780
I want you to stay here.

1075
01:13:45,066 --> 01:13:49,312
I won't be gone long.
Just... Just next door.

1076
01:13:49,822 --> 01:13:52,155
Hey, you'll be safe.

1077
01:13:53,405 --> 01:13:54,341
Daddy...

1078
01:13:54,366 --> 01:13:57,960
Daddy, there are things out there.
Things...

1079
01:13:58,657 --> 01:14:01,991
Yeah. There's a lot less of 'em 
in the daytime.

1080
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:04,343
They'll wait.

1081
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:06,060
They'll wait in the mist
where you can't see 'em,

1082
01:14:06,085 --> 01:14:09,957
and then when you go and can't get back in,
they'll come and eat you up!

1083
01:14:09,982 --> 01:14:11,210
Shh.

1084
01:14:11,235 --> 01:14:12,530
Daddy, don't go!

1085
01:14:21,889 --> 01:14:23,218
I'll be back.

1086
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,758
Big Bill... I promise.

1087
01:14:27,366 --> 01:14:31,624
I'll be back, and then 
I'm gonna take you home. All right?

1088
01:14:32,034 --> 01:14:34,327
Together, we're going home.

1089
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:38,228
If something happens,
anything at all, you cut and run.

1090
01:14:38,421 --> 01:14:41,194
You get your ass back in here,
for your boy's sake.

1091
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:46,007
If something happens to me, I want you
to take care of Billy best as you can,

1092
01:14:46,032 --> 01:14:47,593
and long as you can.

1093
01:14:48,064 --> 01:14:49,913
Land Cruiser's yours now.

1094
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:52,034
You... You get him out of here.

1095
01:14:52,044 --> 01:14:53,546
You just keep drivin'.

1096
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,302
Where do you think you're going,
Mr. David Drayton?

1097
01:15:02,327 --> 01:15:05,099
Are you so anxious to make your boy 
an orphan?

1098
01:15:05,124 --> 01:15:07,217
My boy is no concern of yours.

1099
01:15:07,507 --> 01:15:08,602
Listen up.

1100
01:15:09,059 --> 01:15:10,833
We're going to the pharmacy.

1101
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:12,894
We're gonna bring back some supplies.

1102
01:15:12,919 --> 01:15:16,247
Also, there may be people
trapped over there who need help.

1103
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:18,581
Listen, folks, listen!

1104
01:15:18,606 --> 01:15:20,534
We're not gonna take any chances.

1105
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:24,191
If there's any trouble, we'll come
straight back here to the supermarket.

1106
01:15:24,223 --> 01:15:27,836
And bring the fiends of hell
down on our heads, thank you.

1107
01:15:27,861 --> 01:15:32,614
She's right. You'll make 'em notice us.
You'll make 'em come.

1108
01:15:33,232 --> 01:15:35,928
Why can't you just leave well enough alone?

1109
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:38,121
Lady, this what you call 'well enough"?

1110
01:15:38,146 --> 01:15:39,636
You wanna stop us?

1111
01:15:39,872 --> 01:15:40,934
You better explain to Bobby here

1112
01:15:40,959 --> 01:15:43,464
why we're not bringin' painkillers
and medicine back for his brother.

1113
01:15:43,489 --> 01:15:45,863
I'm goin', even if I have to go alone.

1114
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:47,605
You'll die out there, young man.

1115
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:50,444
You'll walk out that door
and be torn to shreds,

1116
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:53,808
and then your hell-bound pride
will have them come get the rest of us.

1117
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:57,057
Yes, they'll come back for all of us,
just like this good lady said.

1118
01:15:57,067 --> 01:15:59,673
- Do you want that to happen, people?
- No!

1119
01:15:59,697 --> 01:16:02,204
No! No! No!

1120
01:16:02,229 --> 01:16:04,069
Well, it is this kind of hubris

1121
01:16:04,093 --> 01:16:06,527
that brought the wrath of God
in the first place.

1122
01:16:06,552 --> 01:16:08,442
This kind of pride and defiance of-

1123
01:16:09,724 --> 01:16:11,765
Shut up, you miserable buzzard!

1124
01:16:11,790 --> 01:16:13,208
You old bitch!

1125
01:16:17,246 --> 01:16:20,340
Stoning people who piss you off
is perfectly okay.

1126
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:22,487
They do it in the Bible, don't they?

1127
01:16:22,512 --> 01:16:23,977
And I got lots of peas.

1128
01:16:24,002 --> 01:16:26,596
David, please, if you want to go,
now's the time.

1129
01:16:27,067 --> 01:16:30,083
How 'bout it, Army?
Any help from the armed forces?

1130
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:31,520
I'll go.

1131
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:36,816
Jim Grondin. I had you in school, didn't I?

1132
01:16:36,841 --> 01:16:38,786
Yes, me and my sister Pauline.

1133
01:16:38,886 --> 01:16:40,758
Pair of underachievers.

1134
01:16:40,783 --> 01:16:42,011
After you, Jim.

1135
01:16:42,794 --> 01:16:44,130
Yes, ma'am.

1136
01:16:44,155 --> 01:16:45,486
Oh, shit.

1137
01:16:45,511 --> 01:16:49,570
That it? That's everybody?
Everybody that's goin'.

1138
01:16:49,595 --> 01:16:50,692
Yep.

1139
01:16:51,028 --> 01:16:52,005
Okay.

1140
01:16:52,012 --> 01:16:56,684
Single file, one by one, all right?
Let's get this thing over with.

1141
01:16:57,865 --> 01:16:58,854
Let's go.

1142
01:16:58,879 --> 01:17:00,981
- After you.
- Yes.

1143
01:17:03,829 --> 01:17:04,981
Stay together.

1144
01:17:08,362 --> 01:17:09,637
You know what?

1145
01:17:09,794 --> 01:17:11,453
Mrs. Carmody, you're not helping.

1146
01:17:11,462 --> 01:17:13,316
- Shut the hell up!
- You shut up!

1147
01:17:19,946 --> 01:17:21,489
Save the batteries.

1148
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:12,492
Shit. They left the doors propped open.

1149
01:18:13,729 --> 01:18:15,403
Think something got in?

1150
01:18:16,986 --> 01:18:21,161
Let's just... get what we need,
get the hell outta here.

1151
01:18:21,186 --> 01:18:22,862
Yeah. Let's do that.

1152
01:18:22,887 --> 01:18:27,248
The meds are over at the end there,
in the cubicle.

1153
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:51,091
- Will you not do that?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1154
01:18:51,272 --> 01:18:52,971
Oh, God.

1155
01:19:17,937 --> 01:19:19,151
Where's that Silvadene?

1156
01:19:19,511 --> 01:19:22,857
It's over behind David.
In the fridge. Check there.

1157
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,336
Silvadene. Got it.

1158
01:19:30,774 --> 01:19:32,833
- Good.
- Ollie, what are we lookin' for?

1159
01:19:32,858 --> 01:19:34,639
- Penicillin.
- Yeah.

1160
01:19:34,664 --> 01:19:37,258
- Any strong antibiotics.
- Yeah.

1161
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:41,198
Pain meds like Vicodin or OxyContin.

1162
01:19:41,233 --> 01:19:42,812
- Shh!
- OxyContin!

1163
01:19:44,515 --> 01:19:46,445
Hydrochloride?

1164
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:49,729
Penicillin.

1165
01:20:01,636 --> 01:20:02,625
Guys.

1166
01:20:06,056 --> 01:20:07,797
Hurry it up. I hear something.

1167
01:20:11,693 --> 01:20:12,695
What?

1168
01:20:14,898 --> 01:20:16,844
Somethin' fuckin' weird.

1169
01:20:26,117 --> 01:20:27,523
Oh, God.

1170
01:20:27,961 --> 01:20:29,148
Oh, God!

1171
01:20:29,625 --> 01:20:33,134
No. Oh, no.

1172
01:20:33,648 --> 01:20:35,022
Oh, no...

1173
01:20:35,047 --> 01:20:36,789
Oh, fuck.

1174
01:20:38,248 --> 01:20:40,494
Look. There's another one.

1175
01:20:40,519 --> 01:20:43,283
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, no.

1176
01:20:43,355 --> 01:20:45,721
Oh, no, no.

1177
01:20:46,314 --> 01:20:49,477
Guys, let's get out of here now.

1178
01:20:51,911 --> 01:20:53,461
Holy shit!

1179
01:20:56,368 --> 01:20:58,726
Shit! Shit! Oh, shit!

1180
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:03,655
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Help me!

1181
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:05,625
Good Lord! Help him!

1182
01:21:11,955 --> 01:21:14,982
Son of a bitch! 
This stuff ain't comin' off!

1183
01:21:15,571 --> 01:21:18,255
Oh, man!
He's glued to this fuckin' post!

1184
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:22,017
It's our fault. It's all our fault.

1185
01:21:22,273 --> 01:21:23,763
It's really stuck.

1186
01:21:27,971 --> 01:21:29,962
God, I can feel 'em!

1187
01:21:30,365 --> 01:21:31,962
I can feel 'em!

1188
01:21:33,818 --> 01:21:35,752
Oh, my God! Jesus!

1189
01:21:42,971 --> 01:21:44,358
Oh, my God.

1190
01:21:44,842 --> 01:21:46,682
Oh! I...

1191
01:21:57,164 --> 01:21:58,523
There's more!

1192
01:22:08,303 --> 01:22:09,633
There's another one! Hit it!

1193
01:22:11,563 --> 01:22:13,398
What the hell is that stuff?

1194
01:22:13,969 --> 01:22:15,543
Ollie! One over there!

1195
01:22:15,883 --> 01:22:17,257
Ollie, there!

1196
01:22:17,282 --> 01:22:18,328
Got it!

1197
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:21,281
There, there, there!
Shoot! Shoot!

1198
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:23,375
Shit!

1199
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:26,781
See 'em?

1200
01:22:30,078 --> 01:22:31,271
Bobby!

1201
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,539
Bobby!

1202
01:22:38,648 --> 01:22:40,514
Hold on, man! Hold on!

1203
01:22:40,953 --> 01:22:42,315
- Hold on, man!
- Cut the strand!

1204
01:22:42,785 --> 01:22:43,774
Help me!

1205
01:22:44,644 --> 01:22:45,883
Let's get out of here!

1206
01:22:48,655 --> 01:22:51,021
- A belt! Who's got a belt?
- I got a belt!

1207
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:57,625
- I got him, I got him.
- Hold on.

1208
01:22:58,323 --> 01:22:59,398
Pull it tight!

1209
01:23:01,481 --> 01:23:03,108
Look! Look!

1210
01:23:11,130 --> 01:23:12,138
Light!

1211
01:23:12,646 --> 01:23:13,447
Light!

1212
01:23:15,310 --> 01:23:16,115
God!

1213
01:23:19,396 --> 01:23:21,865
We gotta get outta here! Come on!

1214
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:24,818
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

1215
01:23:25,826 --> 01:23:27,240
Watch it, watch it, watch it!

1216
01:23:38,711 --> 01:23:40,144
Let's get out of here!

1217
01:23:40,738 --> 01:23:43,730
All right, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Come on!

1218
01:23:44,211 --> 01:23:45,371
Come on!

1219
01:23:52,454 --> 01:23:53,696
Oh, my God!

1220
01:23:55,907 --> 01:23:57,568
Ollie! Ollie!

1221
01:24:02,226 --> 01:24:03,758
Kill it! Kill it!

1222
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:15,639
Fuckers!

1223
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:16,807
Oh, no! Oh, God, he's dead!

1224
01:24:16,832 --> 01:24:19,686
He's dead! Get out of here!
Let's go, let's go!

1225
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:21,657
Drayton, come on, come on, come on!

1226
01:24:21,682 --> 01:24:24,189
Come on, Drayton, he's dead! Come on!

1227
01:24:55,393 --> 01:24:56,724
Open the door!

1228
01:24:58,459 --> 01:24:59,653
Where's Bobby?

1229
01:24:59,678 --> 01:25:00,774
Daddy!

1230
01:25:02,014 --> 01:25:04,104
- Close up the doors!
- Hurry up!

1231
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:06,106
What happened?

1232
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:08,870
They're dead! They're all dead!

1233
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:30,356
...because we have seen the earth
scourged with whips and scorpions.

1234
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:35,295
We have seen the earth vomit forth
from her lips obscenities

1235
01:25:35,297 --> 01:25:39,139
and profanities of 
such nightmare proportions.

1236
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:44,856
And for these evil, lurking spirits,
and for these evil people...

1237
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:46,396
How long was I out?

1238
01:25:46,416 --> 01:25:47,815
Most of the day.

1239
01:25:48,781 --> 01:25:51,455
You just came over here to lay down
and went to sleep.

1240
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:57,753
Just passed out, is more like it.
Just shut down for a while. Sorry.

1241
01:25:57,778 --> 01:25:59,066
How will it end?

1242
01:25:59,091 --> 01:26:00,080
Expiation!

1243
01:26:00,105 --> 01:26:02,733
Expiation!
Do you remember yesterday when...

1244
01:26:02,758 --> 01:26:04,217
How's Joe?

1245
01:26:04,693 --> 01:26:08,094
Dead. Joe died of his burns
while you were asleep.

1246
01:26:08,849 --> 01:26:10,423
We were just too late.

1247
01:26:10,448 --> 01:26:12,230
I told you this would come!

1248
01:26:12,255 --> 01:26:14,569
Oh, God,
I thought I was dreaming her voice.

1249
01:26:14,594 --> 01:26:15,695
No dream.

1250
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:18,180
She's getting people whipped up.

1251
01:26:18,679 --> 01:26:23,237
That poor girl is dead,
and that boy is burnt in the back room!

1252
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:27,366
She's got 'em believing she's a psychic,
she has a direct line with God.

1253
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:29,776
Why wouldn't they?
Woman never shuts up.

1254
01:26:30,152 --> 01:26:32,430
Like those speeches Castro used to make.

1255
01:26:35,641 --> 01:26:38,184
Ollie says you're thinking of leaving.

1256
01:26:38,534 --> 01:26:39,628
I'm in.

1257
01:26:39,653 --> 01:26:41,621
No. Sorry.

1258
01:26:41,961 --> 01:26:45,592
I mean, come on, you saw 
what happened to Bobby... Mike...

1259
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:49,376
I won't... do that again.
I won't be responsible.

1260
01:26:49,430 --> 01:26:50,897
You might want to reconsider that.

1261
01:26:50,922 --> 01:26:54,319
What will... What will keep these evil,
these abominations at bay?

1262
01:26:54,345 --> 01:26:55,935
What will keep them away?

1263
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:59,049
"The rock will not hide them.
The dead tree gives no shelter."

1264
01:26:59,089 --> 01:27:00,617
What will end it? Let me hear it.

1265
01:27:00,642 --> 01:27:02,542
- Expiation!
- What are we talking about?

1266
01:27:02,567 --> 01:27:05,157
- Expiation!
- Say it again like you mean it!

1267
01:27:05,182 --> 01:27:06,967
Expiation!

1268
01:27:07,192 --> 01:27:11,551
Welcome to Sesame Street.
Today's word is "expiation".

1269
01:27:11,576 --> 01:27:13,824
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

1270
01:27:13,849 --> 01:27:16,553
That boy hasn't been right 
since the pharmacy.

1271
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:19,459
His mind's just snapped. Gone.

1272
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:21,506
Hasn't even been two days.

1273
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:23,903
Not even two days.

1274
01:27:23,928 --> 01:27:26,678
I'm not spendin' the rest of my life here,
I'll tell you what.

1275
01:27:26,873 --> 01:27:29,262
I can quietly gather up
some bags of groceries

1276
01:27:29,287 --> 01:27:32,485
and hide them up at one of
the check stands by the door.

1277
01:27:32,510 --> 01:27:34,774
It was your idea. It's your vehicle.

1278
01:27:35,001 --> 01:27:36,491
It'll be your call.

1279
01:27:37,995 --> 01:27:40,670
I'd rather die out there trying
than in here waiting.

1280
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:48,421
Who will save them? No one.
The rocks will not hide them.

1281
01:27:48,764 --> 01:27:53,576
I want some idea of what we're up
against. I want to know what this mist is.

1282
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:57,301
- I want to talk to the soldiers.
- Soldiers? What's that gonna do?

1283
01:27:57,314 --> 01:27:59,559
You heard what that M.P. said
at the pharmacy.

1284
01:27:59,584 --> 01:28:03,503
David, I'm not even sure I knew 
he was talking. The situation was insane.

1285
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:07,621
He said he was sorry. Wasn't
that the word he used..."sorry"?

1286
01:28:07,646 --> 01:28:09,981
That's right.
He said it was their fault, right?

1287
01:28:10,006 --> 01:28:11,582
What did he mean by that?

1288
01:28:11,607 --> 01:28:13,660
That's what we're gonna find out.

1289
01:28:13,787 --> 01:28:15,448
Irene, stay with Billy, please.

1290
01:28:15,607 --> 01:28:16,816
Verse 17!

1291
01:28:17,172 --> 01:28:21,348
"...poured out his vial into the air,
and there came a great voice

1292
01:28:21,373 --> 01:28:24,639
"out of the temple of heaven
from the throne, saying,

1293
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:26,974
"'It is done! It is done! '

1294
01:28:26,982 --> 01:28:30,029
"And there were voices and lightning,

1295
01:28:30,054 --> 01:28:32,576
and thunders, and a great earthquake."

1296
01:28:33,412 --> 01:28:35,326
Yes! Come to me!

1297
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:37,137
What?

1298
01:28:37,389 --> 01:28:39,615
- Where's your friends?
- I ain't seen 'em.

1299
01:28:39,849 --> 01:28:41,775
Not that big a store. 
It's kinda hard to lose.

1300
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:44,920
I ain't seen 'em, I said.
I look like their keeper?

1301
01:28:48,114 --> 01:28:49,479
What do you want from me?

1302
01:28:49,503 --> 01:28:51,176
What do you know about this mist?

1303
01:28:51,201 --> 01:28:53,533
I don't know nothin'.
I got nothin' to do with it.

1304
01:28:53,558 --> 01:28:55,321
That's not what the M.P.
said in the pharmacy

1305
01:28:55,346 --> 01:28:57,646
before the spiders
came out of his skin.

1306
01:28:58,716 --> 01:29:00,479
They're not in the store.

1307
01:29:00,826 --> 01:29:03,753
The only place we haven't looked
is the loading dock.

1308
01:29:03,838 --> 01:29:07,215
...because you know.
You saw the good face of God tonight.

1309
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:08,652
Yes? Tell us.

1310
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:10,642
Here is an old man who has seen!

1311
01:29:10,818 --> 01:29:12,939
Yes, he has seen!

1312
01:29:12,964 --> 01:29:13,953
Amen.

1313
01:29:14,185 --> 01:29:20,631
And I want to say, do I want to walk
with you into my Father's hands?

1314
01:29:21,336 --> 01:29:22,451
Morales.

1315
01:29:23,238 --> 01:29:24,474
Donaldson.

1316
01:29:27,056 --> 01:29:28,240
Guys...

1317
01:29:30,252 --> 01:29:32,029
It's the only place they can be.

1318
01:29:32,771 --> 01:29:33,660
What?

1319
01:29:33,685 --> 01:29:35,162
Couldn't just disappear.

1320
01:29:35,187 --> 01:29:38,179
Look, I told you, okay, 
I don't know where they are...

1321
01:29:45,367 --> 01:29:49,498
I didn't think they'd do it.
They said they would do it, and I just...

1322
01:29:49,598 --> 01:29:52,885
I told them what the M.P. said at 
the pharmacy, and they swore they'd do it.

1323
01:29:52,910 --> 01:29:55,715
I just... I didn't think they would.
Oh, Jesus.

1324
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:59,024
It's the Arrowhead Project, isn't it?

1325
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:02,655
This mist, it's some kind of, what,
military fuckup?

1326
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:04,267
What were you guys
messin' with up there, huh?

1327
01:30:04,292 --> 01:30:07,159
We got you now, you sorry son of a bitch!

1328
01:30:07,184 --> 01:30:08,280
Get in there!

1329
01:30:08,305 --> 01:30:11,297
It was them!
It was them what done it to us!

1330
01:30:11,322 --> 01:30:14,951
It was them what brung down
the final wrath upon us!

1331
01:30:15,131 --> 01:30:17,676
Those two peckerwoods that
he's been with this whole time,

1332
01:30:17,701 --> 01:30:21,421
they hung themselves in the back
because they knew! They knew it all along!

1333
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:23,421
- He's crazy. He doesn't know-
- Get on your knees!

1334
01:30:23,446 --> 01:30:24,777
Stay out of it, Drayton!

1335
01:30:24,794 --> 01:30:26,969
They heard it too, didn't you? All of ya!

1336
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:30,564
All about the Arrowhead Project and
all that secret shit up on the mountain.

1337
01:30:30,589 --> 01:30:34,395
That's what brung it down on us.
That's what brung down the wrath of God!

1338
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:35,409
Oh!

1339
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:38,948
Private Jessup.

1340
01:30:40,899 --> 01:30:45,899
It wasn't me. I'm just... I'm stationed
up there. I'm not responsible...

1341
01:30:45,899 --> 01:30:48,048
- Bullshit!
- Hell, I'm a local!

1342
01:30:48,073 --> 01:30:50,003
Most of you people know me.

1343
01:30:50,028 --> 01:30:55,122
You stop your chicken shit whining
or I will cut your puling tongue out.

1344
01:30:55,163 --> 01:30:56,795
Now you tell us!

1345
01:30:58,823 --> 01:30:59,920
Tell us.

1346
01:31:00,246 --> 01:31:04,256
Look, look. Okay, okay.
I heard stuff.

1347
01:31:04,269 --> 01:31:05,418
Stuff?

1348
01:31:05,443 --> 01:31:07,654
Yes, we all heard stuff.

1349
01:31:09,263 --> 01:31:15,025
Like how they, um, how they thought
that there were other dimensions,

1350
01:31:15,050 --> 01:31:17,664
you know, other...
other worlds all around us,

1351
01:31:17,689 --> 01:31:22,277
and how they wanted to try and make, um,
a window,

1352
01:31:22,302 --> 01:31:24,896
you know, so they could look through
and see what's on the other side.

1353
01:31:26,734 --> 01:31:29,464
Well, maybe your window
turned out to be a door. Didn't it?

1354
01:31:29,489 --> 01:31:31,354
Not mine! Those scientists!

1355
01:31:31,369 --> 01:31:33,894
Oh, the scientists! Yes, the scientists!

1356
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:36,195
They must have ripped
a hole open by accident.

1357
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:38,303
This other world
came spilling through to ours.

1358
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:41,593
That's what Donaldson was saying to me
right before he killed himself.

1359
01:31:41,618 --> 01:31:43,609
I didn't understand the half of it.

1360
01:31:45,722 --> 01:31:47,123
It ain't my fault!

1361
01:31:47,148 --> 01:31:48,206
Oh.

1362
01:31:49,162 --> 01:31:52,771
Ain't. His. Fault.

1363
01:31:53,448 --> 01:31:54,842
No, no, no.

1364
01:31:55,599 --> 01:31:59,420
Ain't nothin' ever anybody's fault.

1365
01:31:59,698 --> 01:32:01,896
But he denies it.

1366
01:32:02,181 --> 01:32:07,456
He points the finger,
this Judas in our midst.

1367
01:32:07,777 --> 01:32:08,770
Judas!

1368
01:32:08,795 --> 01:32:09,979
David!

1369
01:32:10,306 --> 01:32:12,536
You! You!

1370
01:32:13,042 --> 01:32:14,886
Don't you know by now?

1371
01:32:15,144 --> 01:32:16,856
Don't you know the truth?

1372
01:32:17,246 --> 01:32:19,452
We are being punished.

1373
01:32:19,477 --> 01:32:23,322
For what? 
For going against the will of God!

1374
01:32:23,347 --> 01:32:27,452
For going against
his forbidden rules of old!

1375
01:32:27,477 --> 01:32:29,333
Walking on the moon!

1376
01:32:29,358 --> 01:32:30,927
Yes! Yes!

1377
01:32:30,952 --> 01:32:33,606
- Or... or splitting his atoms!
- Amen!

1378
01:32:33,631 --> 01:32:38,364
Or... or... or stem cells and abortions!

1379
01:32:38,642 --> 01:32:44,491
And destroying the secrets of life
that only God above has any right to!

1380
01:32:44,517 --> 01:32:46,358
Amen! Amen!

1381
01:32:46,592 --> 01:32:48,988
Yes, I know! It is true!

1382
01:32:49,319 --> 01:32:54,627
And now we are being punished.
The judgment is being brought down upon us.

1383
01:32:54,652 --> 01:33:01,208
The fiends of hell, you see they are
let loose, and star Wormwood blazes!

1384
01:33:01,233 --> 01:33:02,435
And it is his fault!

1385
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:05,793
No! No! It is not my fault! No!

1386
01:33:05,818 --> 01:33:08,908
They did it! 
They spit in the eye of the Almighty!

1387
01:33:08,933 --> 01:33:09,922
No!

1388
01:33:11,403 --> 01:33:12,601
Get over there!

1389
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:14,208
No!

1390
01:33:14,412 --> 01:33:15,565
Judas!

1391
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,122
Jim!

1392
01:33:18,147 --> 01:33:20,410
Kill him! String him up!

1393
01:33:23,481 --> 01:33:25,142
Stand up, you coward!

1394
01:33:30,227 --> 01:33:31,387
Jesus!

1395
01:33:34,381 --> 01:33:35,301
No!

1396
01:33:36,614 --> 01:33:38,356
Expiation!

1397
01:33:39,363 --> 01:33:40,455
- No!
- Stab him!

1398
01:33:43,083 --> 01:33:44,333
Expiation!

1399
01:33:44,825 --> 01:33:47,042
Feed him to the beast!

1400
01:33:47,067 --> 01:33:48,772
Expiation!

1401
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:52,799
Let the abominations smell his blood!

1402
01:33:54,312 --> 01:33:55,973
No, no! No!

1403
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:00,571
Jesus! Wait!

1404
01:34:00,596 --> 01:34:02,154
No, David!

1405
01:34:59,005 --> 01:35:00,309
Please.

1406
01:35:10,755 --> 01:35:13,565
The beast will leave us alone tonight.

1407
01:35:15,199 --> 01:35:16,188
Tomorrow...

1408
01:35:17,467 --> 01:35:20,291
Tomorrow, we'll just have to wait and see.

1409
01:35:29,466 --> 01:35:30,626
Daddy.

1410
01:35:32,114 --> 01:35:33,274
Daddy.

1411
01:35:44,916 --> 01:35:46,747
Sorry I left you, pal.

1412
01:35:49,385 --> 01:35:51,241
I'll never leave you again.

1413
01:35:52,449 --> 01:35:53,609
Promise?

1414
01:35:54,747 --> 01:35:58,444
But you have to give me
your best promise, okay?

1415
01:35:58,469 --> 01:36:01,905
Your very best promise,
and can never break it.

1416
01:36:02,144 --> 01:36:03,468
Tell me.

1417
01:36:05,409 --> 01:36:07,952
Promise you won't let the monsters get me.

1418
01:36:11,555 --> 01:36:13,913
Ever. No matter what.

1419
01:36:15,831 --> 01:36:17,304
I promise.

1420
01:36:20,749 --> 01:36:22,335
I love you, Daddy.

1421
01:36:22,485 --> 01:36:24,069
I love you, Billy.

1422
01:36:25,207 --> 01:36:26,538
More than anything.

1423
01:36:55,918 --> 01:36:57,460
It's dawn.

1424
01:37:02,561 --> 01:37:05,278
Hey, pal, you ready to go home?

1425
01:37:05,935 --> 01:37:07,300
Come on.

1426
01:37:09,327 --> 01:37:12,318
Okay, I got the groceries
hidden at check stand number two.

1427
01:37:12,343 --> 01:37:14,687
Five bags. We can grab 'em
and get out the door.

1428
01:37:15,156 --> 01:37:16,103
Okay.

1429
01:37:16,671 --> 01:37:19,859
My car's parked in the center lane
of the parking lot, far end.

1430
01:37:20,085 --> 01:37:22,794
Whoever gets there first,
open up both doors,

1431
01:37:22,819 --> 01:37:24,864
and we'll all pile in as
fast as we can, okay?

1432
01:37:24,889 --> 01:37:26,049
Let's go.

1433
01:37:49,681 --> 01:37:51,876
Stealing food now?

1434
01:37:56,482 --> 01:37:58,473
Going out now, Mrs. Carmody.

1435
01:37:59,974 --> 01:38:01,635
Please stand aside.

1436
01:38:02,513 --> 01:38:05,052
You can't go out. I won't allow it.

1437
01:38:05,170 --> 01:38:06,305
Won't allow it?

1438
01:38:06,330 --> 01:38:11,193
It's against God's will.
Don't you know that by now?

1439
01:38:11,566 --> 01:38:15,881
Haven't I proven myself
again and again and again?

1440
01:38:16,577 --> 01:38:20,647
Haven't I shown that I am his vessel?

1441
01:38:25,249 --> 01:38:27,140
What's the matter with you?

1442
01:38:30,290 --> 01:38:31,999
Don't you believe in God?

1443
01:38:32,405 --> 01:38:34,132
No one's interfered with you.

1444
01:38:34,812 --> 01:38:36,890
All we're asking for
is the same privilege.

1445
01:38:37,124 --> 01:38:38,455
You heard him.

1446
01:38:40,037 --> 01:38:44,303
It is these people
who brought this upon us.

1447
01:38:45,328 --> 01:38:50,082
They... people who refused
to bend to the will of God,

1448
01:38:50,107 --> 01:38:52,701
and claim it privilege.

1449
01:38:53,060 --> 01:38:55,821
Sinners in pride.

1450
01:38:56,318 --> 01:38:58,058
Yes, haughty.

1451
01:38:58,329 --> 01:38:59,956
Privileged!

1452
01:39:00,184 --> 01:39:04,184
They mock us. They mock our...
our God, our faith,

1453
01:39:04,209 --> 01:39:07,542
our values, our very lifestyle.

1454
01:39:07,567 --> 01:39:14,758
They mock our humility and our
piousness. They piss on us and laugh.

1455
01:39:18,083 --> 01:39:23,306
It's from them the blood of
human sacrifice must come.

1456
01:39:23,884 --> 01:39:25,351
From them...

1457
01:39:25,955 --> 01:39:28,020
- Come on.
...the blood of expiation.

1458
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:29,034
Come on.

1459
01:39:29,790 --> 01:39:30,821
You try it.

1460
01:39:31,001 --> 01:39:32,415
Fuckin' try it!

1461
01:39:32,610 --> 01:39:33,659
Come on!

1462
01:39:34,218 --> 01:39:35,976
We want the boy.

1463
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:37,396
- We want the boy!
- You get back!

1464
01:39:38,395 --> 01:39:39,562
You get back!

1465
01:39:39,590 --> 01:39:40,734
The boy!

1466
01:39:42,092 --> 01:39:43,957
Grab that boy! Grab him!

1467
01:39:47,998 --> 01:39:49,329
Grab him!

1468
01:39:51,187 --> 01:39:52,845
And get the whore too!

1469
01:39:53,046 --> 01:39:54,280
Grab her!

1470
01:39:54,624 --> 01:39:56,839
Kill 'em! Kill 'em all!

1471
01:40:12,304 --> 01:40:13,749
Stay down! Stay down! Stay down!

1472
01:40:20,732 --> 01:40:22,747
I... I killed her.

1473
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:25,919
Thank you, Ollie.

1474
01:40:27,802 --> 01:40:29,052
Let's go.

1475
01:40:30,388 --> 01:40:33,247
Get that ice machine
out of the way, please.

1476
01:40:35,655 --> 01:40:37,621
You killed her!

1477
01:40:37,646 --> 01:40:39,978
You murdered her!

1478
01:40:43,537 --> 01:40:46,797
I wouldn't have shot her, Dave,
not if there'd been any other way.

1479
01:40:46,827 --> 01:40:48,396
That's why I said thank you.

1480
01:40:48,465 --> 01:40:49,577
Okay.

1481
01:40:49,602 --> 01:40:51,934
Okay, then... let's go!

1482
01:40:53,697 --> 01:40:54,788
Get up, Myron!

1483
01:40:54,813 --> 01:40:56,075
Come on! We gotta go!

1484
01:40:56,100 --> 01:40:57,263
My ankle!

1485
01:41:05,717 --> 01:41:08,049
Okay. All the way down!

1486
01:41:09,159 --> 01:41:10,422
Where are they?

1487
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:12,376
Bud! Myron!

1488
01:41:12,401 --> 01:41:13,425
Ambrose!

1489
01:41:13,450 --> 01:41:15,042
I think I broke it!

1490
01:41:15,171 --> 01:41:16,729
Come on! Come on!

1491
01:41:16,754 --> 01:41:18,297
We gotta go! Come on, come on!

1492
01:41:18,322 --> 01:41:19,550
They're lost!

1493
01:41:27,862 --> 01:41:28,941
- Oh, Jesus.
- Ollie!

1494
01:41:29,659 --> 01:41:30,893
Ollie!

1495
01:42:11,275 --> 01:42:12,877
All that screaming!

1496
01:42:13,831 --> 01:42:16,010
Are they out there? Can they see us?

1497
01:42:26,182 --> 01:42:28,690
Let me... let me in! Let me in!

1498
01:42:42,993 --> 01:42:44,483
Are we going?

1499
01:42:51,521 --> 01:42:52,458
- No.
- Yeah.

1500
01:42:52,483 --> 01:42:54,576
- No! No!
- Yeah!

1501
01:42:54,857 --> 01:42:56,162
- Daddy.
- David.

1502
01:42:56,404 --> 01:42:58,030
- David, no.
- Daddy, no.

1503
01:42:58,443 --> 01:42:59,818
- David!
- Daddy!

1504
01:42:59,890 --> 01:43:01,380
Get back in the car!

1505
01:43:01,405 --> 01:43:03,138
- Daddy!
- David!

1506
01:43:13,737 --> 01:43:15,245
Oh, my God!

1507
01:43:18,037 --> 01:43:19,581
Oh, my God!

1508
01:43:40,301 --> 01:43:41,532
We gotta go.

1509
01:45:40,383 --> 01:45:42,524
I told her I'd fix it.

1510
01:45:46,066 --> 01:45:49,235
Front window... broken open.

1511
01:45:53,014 --> 01:45:54,174
Tree.

1512
01:45:56,336 --> 01:45:59,774
My... grandfather's tree.

1513
01:46:15,407 --> 01:46:18,128
I'm sorry, David, I'm just so sorry.

1514
01:46:33,003 --> 01:46:34,391
Let's, uh...

1515
01:46:36,340 --> 01:46:37,907
...see how far this...

1516
01:46:39,476 --> 01:46:41,485
...fuel takes us, huh?

1517
01:46:44,696 --> 01:46:46,790
Maybe we'll get clear of the mist.

1518
01:50:03,062 --> 01:50:04,222
Well...

1519
01:50:06,098 --> 01:50:08,089
...we gave it a good shot.

1520
01:50:08,886 --> 01:50:10,811
Nobody can say we didn't.

1521
01:50:12,389 --> 01:50:13,756
Nope.

1522
01:50:14,526 --> 01:50:16,357
Nobody can say that.

1523
01:51:45,168 --> 01:51:46,496
Well...

1524
01:51:48,377 --> 01:51:49,901
We got, uh...

1525
01:51:54,289 --> 01:51:55,589
...four.

1526
01:52:00,149 --> 01:52:01,394
Four bullets.

1527
01:52:05,802 --> 01:52:07,292
But there's five of us.

1528
01:52:17,892 --> 01:52:19,655
I'll figure something out.

1529
01:54:18,275 --> 01:54:19,765
Come on!

1530
01:54:25,753 --> 01:54:27,084
Come on!

1531
01:54:28,194 --> 01:54:30,160
Come on!

1532
01:54:33,207 --> 01:54:35,652
Come on. Come on.

1533
01:54:35,938 --> 01:54:37,207
Come on.

1534
01:54:46,463 --> 01:54:47,760
Come on.

1535
01:54:47,931 --> 01:54:49,626
Come on.

1536
01:54:49,799 --> 01:54:51,008
Come on.

1537
01:54:52,402 --> 01:54:54,165
Come on, come on!

1538
01:54:54,867 --> 01:54:57,695
Come on! Come on!

1539
01:56:34,537 --> 01:56:37,028
They're... they're dead.

1540
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:39,190
For what?
