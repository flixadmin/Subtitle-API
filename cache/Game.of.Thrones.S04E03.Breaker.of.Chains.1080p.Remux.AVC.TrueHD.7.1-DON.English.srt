I know. But you must admit,
it looks suspicious.

The King who executed your father,

who tormented you for years,

Why did you kill him?

40

and I don't trust drunk fools.

Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders.
Every one of them.

Less than you would have been

63
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:31,976
if Joffrey had done you the courtesy
of consummating the marriage before dying.

64
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:36,939
This would not be
an opportune moment to press the issue.

65
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:40,776
Clawing at his own throat,
looking to his mother to make it stop...

when he died.

70
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:53,205
Made me look at it.

71
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,748
What was it like?

72
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:57,960
They took me to the Great Hall. There he was.

73
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:02,673
The man I'd married
and suffered to father my children.

74
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:08,887
A great doughy lump I'd sat next to
at endless dinners and tedious gatherings.

75
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:10,514
There he was,

76
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,018
lying on a table.

77
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,107
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

78
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,109
and was stabbed through the heart.

79
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,361
Another was happiest torturing animals

80
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,780
and was poisoned at our wedding feast.

81
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,574
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

82
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,493
Your circumstances have improved markedly.

83
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,248
You may not have enjoyed watching him die,

84
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:38,125
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

85
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,169
being married to him, I can promise you that.

86
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,296
But I would have been the queen.

87
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,381
Our alliance with the Lannisters

88
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:47,926
remains every bit as necessary to them
as it is unpleasant for us.

89
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,306
You did wonderful work on Joffrey.

90
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,725

92
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,991
Do you know what that means?

93
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:16,413
I'm not trying to trick you.

94
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,292
It means I'll become king.

95
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:23,545
Yes, you will become king.

96
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,839
What kind of king do you think you'll be?

97
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,343
- A good king?
- TYWIN: Mmm.

98
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,470
I think so as well.

99
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:35,683
You've got the right temperament for it.

100
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:39,144
But what makes a good king? Hmm?

101
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:43,023
What is a good king's
single most important quality?

102
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:45,067
This is hardly the place or the time.

103
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,112
- Holiness?
- Hmm.

104
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,658
Baelor the Blessed was holy.

105
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,868
And pious.

106
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,620
He built this Sept.

107
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:00,749
He also named a 6-year-old boy High Septon

108
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,961
because he thought
the boy could work miracles.

109
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,132
He ended up
fasting himself into an early grave

110
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:12,469
because food was of this world
and this world was sinful.

111
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:13,595
Hmm.

112
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,266
- Justice.
- Mmm.

113
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,477
A good king must be just.

114
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:24,481
Orys I was just.

115
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,025
Everyone applauded his reforms,

116
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:29,111
nobles and commoners alike.

117
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,363
But he wasn't just for long.

118
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:35,659
He was murdered in his sleep
after less than a year by his own brother.

119
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,871
Was that truly just of him?

120
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:43,459
To abandon his subjects to an evil that
he was too gullible to recognise?

121
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,794
- No.
- No.

122
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,966
- What about strength?
- Yes.

123
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,260
Strength.

124
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,138
King Robert was strong.

125
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,265
He won the rebellion

126
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:01,143
and crushed the Targaryen dynasty.

127
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:06,607
And he attended three Small Council
meetings in 17 years.

128
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:10,986
He spent his time whoring and hunting
and drinking

129
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,363
until the last two killed him.

130
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:18,035
So, we have a man
who starves himself to death,

131
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:21,622
a man who lets his own brother murder him,

132
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:25,167
and a man who thinks that winning and ruling
are the same thing.

133
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:30,130
What do they all lack?

134
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,512
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

135
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:39,264
- Wisdom is what makes a good king.
- Yes.

136
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,227
But what is wisdom? Hmm?

137
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:49,775
A house with great wealth and fertile lands
asks you for your protection

138
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:55,155
against another house with a strong navy
that could one day oppose you.

139
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:58,659
How do you know
which choice is wise and which isn't?

140
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:02,621
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

141
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,374
or shipyards and soldiers?

142
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:07,876
- No.
- TYWIN: Of course not.

143
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:11,296
A wise king knows what he knows
and what he doesn't.

144
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,131
You're young.

145
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:19,888
A wise young king listens to his counsellors
and heeds their advice until he comes of age.

146
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:22,182
And the wisest kings

147
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:25,310
continue to listen to them long afterwards.

148
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,772
Your brother was not a wise king.

149
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:31,316
Your brother was not a good king.

150
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,443
If he had been,

151
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:36,113
perhaps he'd still be alive.

152
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,157
Now, as the king, you will have to marry.

153
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:41,660
Do you understand why?

154
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,287
TOMMEN: A king needs a queen.

155
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,205
TYWIN: Yes, but why?

156
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,959
To further the family line.

157
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,211
- Do you know how that happens?
- TOMMEN: Yes.

158
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,966
TYWIN: But has anyone
explained the details to you?

159
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,593
TOMMEN: I don't think so.

160
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:00,429
It's all relatively straightforward.

161
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:03,640
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

162
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,517
You are. You will be.

163
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,603
I'll see to that.

164

00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,071
and it delights me.

484
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,158
When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne.

485
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:15,870
When it comes to love, I don't choose sides.

486
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:18,164
I hope I have as much stamina
when I'm your age.

487
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:19,957
What are you, 25?

488

Someday, if you're lucky,
you will wake up and realise you are old.

491
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,675
That pretty ass of yours will sag,

492
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:32,970
your belly will grow soft,
and your back will ache in the night,

493
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:35,931
and grey hairs will sprout from your ears.

494
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:39,393
No one will want you any more.

495
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,563
Make sure you've fucked your fill
before that day.

496
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,649
Did you?

497
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:49,403
He is a prince of Dorne.

498
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:54,783
Girls and boys will line up to fuck him
till the day he dies.

499
00:33:57,453 --> 00:34:00,539
They will all have to line up behind you.

May we have the room?

Call my name if you need me, lover.

504

Would you like to sit?

No, thank you.

I'm sorry about your grandson.

00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:39,787
Are you?

510
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:43,499
I don't believe that a child is responsible
for the sins of his father.

511
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,961
Or his grandfather.

512
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:48,587
An awful way to die.

513
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,839
Which way is that?

514
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:54,093
Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?

515
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:55,636
Some believe the King choked.

516
00:34:56,095 --> 00:35:00,641
Some believe the sky is blue because
we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant.

517
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,853
The King was poisoned.

518
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,982
I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.

519
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:10,401
I did. This is why I know.

520
00:35:10,484 --> 00:35:13,362
Your hatred for my family
is rather well-known.

521
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:16,824
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

522
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:20,703
some days later
my grandson dies of poisoning.

523
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:22,204
Rather suspicious.

524
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:24,039
Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?

525
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:27,793
You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel
on the day that you arrived.

526
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:32,172
- What did you discuss?
- You think we conspired together?

527
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:33,590
What did you discuss?

528
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:36,593
The death of my sister.

529
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:38,721
For which you blame me.

530
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:41,181
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

531
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:43,726
The Mountain follows your orders.

532
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,269
Of course I blame you.

533
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:48,314
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.

534
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:49,565
Should I be concerned?

535
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:53,068
You are unarmed and unguarded
because you know me better than that.

536
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,696
I am a man of reason.

537
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:59,408
If I cut your throat today,
I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow.

538
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:03,245
Men at war commit all kinds of crimes
without their superiors' knowledge.

539
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:05,789
So you deny involvement in Elia's murder?

540
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,584
Categorically.

541
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:20,054
I would like to speak with the Mountain.

542
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:22,598
I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.

543
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,601
He might not enjoy it
as much as he thinks he would.

544
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,522
I could arrange for this meeting.

545
00:36:31,065 --> 00:36:34,401
But you want something in return.

546
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:39,073
There will be a trial for my son
and, as custom dictates,

547
00:36:39,156 --> 00:36:41,950
three judges will render a verdict.

548
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:43,452
I will preside.

549
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,622
Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge.

550
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,832
I would like you to be the third.

551
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:50,751
Why?

552
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:54,630
Not long ago,
the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon.

553
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,383
Declared themselves enemies of the throne.

554
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:59,551
Now they are our strongest allies.

555
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:02,137
Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen.

556
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:05,432
Asking me to judge at your son's trial
isn't quite as tempting.

557
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:09,353
I would also invite you
to sit on the Small Council

558
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:12,940
to serve as one of
the new king's principal advisors.

559
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:23,450
I never realised
you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

560

We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

561
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:30,916
The King is dead.
The Greyjoys are in open rebellion.

562
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:34,044
A wildling army marches on the Wall.

563
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:38,382
And in the east,
a Targaryen girl has three dragons.

564
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:43,762
Before long,
she will turn her eyes to Westeros.

565
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:49,476
Only the Dornish managed to resist
Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.

566
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:52,187
You're saying you need us?

567
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,442
That must be hard for you to admit.

568
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:59,570
We need each other.

569
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:03,198
You help me serve justice to
the King's assassins,

570
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:06,034
and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.

Apologies for the stench.

574
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:32,269
I brought you some wine, my lord,
but they took it from me.

575
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:33,896
A noble effort.

576
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:36,231
They didn't find the candles, though.

577
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,775
A quill, some parchment,

578
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:41,528
duck sausage, almonds,

579
00:38:42,488 --> 00:38:44,656
and some hard cheese.

You're a good lad.

Any word of Shae?

582
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:50,245
I've heard nothing, my lord.

583
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:52,748
I suppose that's a good thing.

What are they saying about me out there?

585

You're to stand trial in a fortnight
for murdering the King.

00:39:02,883 --> 00:39:05,761
- Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?
- No, my lord.

You didn't?

00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:10,432
Gods, no.

589
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:14,770
The world is a better place without him,
but I had nothing to do with it.

590
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:19,566
I would like to think
if I were arranging a royal assassination,

591
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,693
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there,

Mace Tyrell.

Who will vote exactly
as my father tells him to vote.

He never fails to take advantage
of a family tragedy.

Anyone who might testify on your behalf.

604
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:00,232
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?

605
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,651
How generous of them.

Very well, my wife. Sansa.

My lord, she's gone.

608

- Gone?
- No one's seen her since the wedding.

609
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:15,414
You don't think she...

610
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:22,170
No one had more cause to kill Joffrey
than Sansa,

611
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:24,256
but the girl is no assassin.

612
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:27,426
Whoever killed the King
wanted me to lose my head for it.

613
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:31,013
And with my wife's disappearance,
it makes me seem that much more guilty.

00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,932
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

615

- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

616
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:38,270
I don't know. They. The ominous they.

617
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:41,356
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

618
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,901
Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him.

619
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:47,738
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

620
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:53,035
Whenever something bad happens to me,
I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it.

621
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,495
But say what you will of Cersei,

622
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:57,205
she loves her children.

623
00:40:57,331 --> 00:41:01,209
She is the only one I'm certain
had nothing to do with this murder.

624
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:05,964
Which makes it unique
as King's Landing murders go.

625
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,091
Any other witnesses, my lord?

626
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:10,802
Varys could vouch for me, if he dared.

627
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:12,888
He's already been called
as a witness for the Queen.

628
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,891
Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.

629
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,643
I've already asked, my lord.
They won't let him see you.

630
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:18,769
Why not?

631
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:21,396
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

632
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,981
He's under investigation himself.

633
00:41:23,065 --> 00:41:26,318
And my brother?
Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?

634
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,486
I'll ask, my lord.

635
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:45,337
There's something else, my lord.

636
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,674
A man, I didn't know his face,

637
00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:50,592
he came to ask if I'd testify against you.

638
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:54,179
Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne

639
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:57,599
if I told the judges
you'd bought a poison called the strangler.

640
00:41:57,933 --> 00:41:59,976

Your enemy steals and murders your children.

802
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:12,625
Your enemy has nothing for you
but chains and suffering

803
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,877
and commands.

804
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:18,840
I did not bring you commands.

805
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:21,634
I bring you a choice.

806
00:54:22,844 --> 00:54:26,013
And I bring your enemies what they deserve.

807
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:30,643
Forward!

808
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,364
Fire!

809
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:58,588
