My new security consultant.

Recommended by Victor,
who is off visiting his bubby.

100
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,600
You wanna know why I carry two pistols?

101
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,840
Overcompensation?

102
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,319
See, I always shoot twice.

103
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,316
The first one does the job every time,
but the second one, well,

104
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,192
that's just my signature. Hmm.

105
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
He has a signature.

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,277
- C0lorful, isn't he? But effective.
- Mmm.

107
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,838
Mr. Headhunter and my men
will help the GCPD

108
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,877
until this Pyg situation is resolved.

109
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,759
We don't want your help
or that of your idiot hitman.

110
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,512
Pyg's actions threaten the both of us.

111
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,875
He's killing my cops, my employees.

112
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
Allegedly.

113
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,278
Get this through you head, Oswald.

114
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,231
We don't work for you,
and <i>we</i> don't work with you, ever.

(LAUGHS)

116
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,149
Well, your captain says otherwise.

117
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,239
Excited to work with you, Jim.

118
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,416
- Are you out of your freakin' mind?
- Jim, listen...

119
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,999
You are legitimizing him, Harvey.

120
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,675
He's been legitimized for years,
he was the freakin' mayor.

121
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,936
GORDON:
Is it about the money. is that it?

122
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,960
It's not about that.

123
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,995
How can I know that?

124
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,472
- How can you even know that?
- Take a look out there, okay?

125
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,914
Half the precinct skipped town

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,389
because they didn't want to wear
bacon flavored death masks.

127
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
We need the help.

128
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,836
You are dangerously overreacting.

129
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,992
I'm overreacting because every cop
in this precinct got a death threat.

130
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,679
Except, of course, for you.

131
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,840
S0 Penguin's guys are gonna

132
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,718
beat and torture their way
through the city,

133
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,996
- then execute Pyg if they find him?
- And?

134
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,149
And the people need to know

135
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,151
they don't need gangsters
to keep them safe.

136
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,399
I'II tell you what,
I'm gonna find Pyg, alive.

137
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,879
And I'II bring him tojustice.

138
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,960
Good for you.

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,195
Three cops just went missing.

140
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,680
Where?

141
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,597
It's gonna be tough. It's The Narrows.

142
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,069
So that's it. We're shutting up shop.

143
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,551
So long, farewell. Toodledoo.

144
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,517
- I can't believe this.
- I can.

145
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,438
AII this was so I could be
Ra's eyes and ears in Gotham.

146
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,431
He was bankrolling us,
and now, he's gone.

147
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
S0 I'm pulling the plug.

148
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,509
Help yourself to whatever.

149
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:06,036
So, all of this, being partners,
building something together... Lies.

150
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,269
A sales pitch. I couldn't do it alone.

151
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,590
We can still spy on thejerks
who come in here,

152
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,040
and get intel on jobs.

153
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,953
- We can make it work.
- What,

154
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,879
and the three of us stay together.
Like a plucky little family?

155
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,313
Well, how about a little
parting lesson from big sis?

156
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,230
In this life, you're on your own.

157
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Always.

158
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,235
Ugh!

159
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,598
Bonus lesson:
Never make bellinis from a can.

160
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,234
I followed a buyer
from The Street Demonz.

161
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,072

No, they're not.
They've no record of Fazoli.

516

The guy in the ambulance was The Pyg
in disguise.

521
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,036
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Pyg called me.

522
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,190
He warned me off.

523
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,351
He used the same phrase he used
in the ambulance.

524
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,477
He fed us the clue to get us here.

525
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,360
It has to be a trap.

526
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,556
So, the insane serial killer
who hates cops

527
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,632
warned you to save your life,
because why now?

528
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,518
Because I'm against dirty cops.

529

Except, all of the times you are one.

530

Call it off.

532

I have another interpretation, Jim.

533
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,192
The Pyg is not trying to save you,

534
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,794
he's trying to save himself
by stopping the raid.

You are being played, and not
for the first time I might add.

536
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,517
We called Gotham General.
They can't locate Fazoli

537
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,034
or the ambulance.

538
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,589
Jim, it's Gotham General.
It's a madhouse down there.

539
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,320
If I'm correct, The Pyg
isn't even in the courthouse.

540
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,791
I came directly from the ambulance.
There is no way he beat me here.

541
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,194
You're wrong. Pyg is in there, Jim.

542
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,280
He's right.

543
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,829
We got a spotter across the street
that got a visual

544
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,274
on Pyg, in there,

tied to a chair. I swear.

Look, I can't explain it.
AII I know is this is a trap.

547
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,236
Now you asked me to trust you,
I am asking you to trust me.

I'm with Penguin on this one.
