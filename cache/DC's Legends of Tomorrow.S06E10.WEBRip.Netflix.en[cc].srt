like a Catholic.

1049
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:55,792
- What, just because I'm like

1050
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,336
full of guilt

1051
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,336
and self-loathing.

1052
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:01,339
- You know,

1053
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:01,339
my mama used to say--

1054
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,008
never mind.

1055
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,261
- No, no, no, no, no.

1056
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:06,261
What about your mama? Tell me.

1057
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,475
- She used to say,

1058
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:15,937
"Somos salvodos

1059
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:15,937
solo po la fe."

1060
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:19,899
We're saved by faith alone.

1061
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,819
It's funny, I've--

1062
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,819
I've forgotten her face,

1063
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,738
but I can still remember

1064
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,738
the sound of her voice.

1065
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:30,243
We were both abducted,

1066
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:30,243
and only I returned.

1067
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:33,454
I should have been more like

1068
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:33,454
Fernando and--and refused

1069
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:37,416
to give up on her,

1070
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:37,416
but I lost faith.

1071
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,462
- Spoons,

1072
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,756
you live on a time ship.

1073
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,508
It's never too late, love.

1076
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,516
of Crowley snoring?

1077
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,852
- [laughs]

1078
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,852
- Shh.

00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:04,777
Wakey, wakey, Crowley.

John.

1083
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,546
- To have magic back, Spooner,

1084
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,546
it's worth it.

1085
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,715
It's worth the risk.

1086
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:28,385
- Don't do it.

1087
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:28,385
I'll tell Zari.

1088
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:33,265
- No, you won't.

1089
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:33,265
Praeterita obliviscere.

1090
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,684
You'll go upstairs

1091
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,684
and you'll sleep it off.

1092
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,353
Tomorrow you'll return

1093
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,353
to the Legends.

1094
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:40,230
You'll tell them

1095
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:40,230
we were successful.

1096
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:43,108
You'll tell them

1097
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,693
I drank from

1098
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,693
the Fountain of Imperium.

1099
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:47,946
- Yes, John.

1100
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:55,494
- My stars. I take it

1101
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:55,494
you didn't find the fountain.

1102
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:59,207
Are you--are you juicing, John?

1103
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,500
- Jokes on you, dickweed.

1104
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,962
- Is that so?

1105
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,381
- Bonsoir, gentlemen.

1106
00:41:06,423 --> 00:41:08,383
- You brought what I asked for?

1107
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,309
- Oh, and you can take him.

1108
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,309
He's yours.

00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,185
- John, what have you done?

1110
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,687
No.

00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,687
Please, John.

You don't know who

1113
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,232
she'll trade my soul to.

1114
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:28,069
- And what a lucrative trade

1115
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:28,069
it will be.

00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,283

00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:38,579
- No.

Damn you, John!
