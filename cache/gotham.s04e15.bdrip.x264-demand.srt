Lee.

655
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,311
She kept you alive
till the medics got there.

656
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,716
Even one-handed,
she's a damn good doctor.

- In a coma.

When I get out of here,
I'm going to confess.

661
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,796
My connection to Sofia,
my role with the Pyg. AII of it.

662
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,035
I gotta come clean.

No.

What do you mean?

665

Who would benefit from that? You.

So, Sofia wins after all?

It's what the city needs.

Where's Lee?

674
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,753
She went back to The Narrows.

675
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,913
