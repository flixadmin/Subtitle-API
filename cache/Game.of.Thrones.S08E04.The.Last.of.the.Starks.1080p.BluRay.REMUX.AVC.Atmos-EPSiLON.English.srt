00:29:58,422 --> 00:29:59,799
but I'm begging you.

328
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:03,719
Don't do this. Please.

329
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,936
You are my queen.

330
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,106
Nothing will change that.

331
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:19,777
And they are my family.

332
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,364
We can live together.

333
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,496
We can.

334
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,208
I've just told you how.

335
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,030
(SIGHS SOFTLY)

336
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:11,620
Half are gone.

337
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:16,959
The Northmen as well.

338
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:27,428
And the Golden Company
has arrived in King's Landing,

339
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,305
courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet.

340
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:32,516
The balance has grown
distressingly even.

341
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,436
When the people find out
what we have done for them,

342
00:31:36,312 --> 00:31:37,396
that we saved them...

343
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,482
Cersei will make sure
they don't believe it.

344
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:42,818
We will hit her hard.

345
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,488
We will rip her out root and stem.

346
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:49,617
The objective here is to remove Cersei

347
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,702
without destroying King's Landing.

348
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,876
VARYS: Thankfully,
she is losing allies by the day.

349
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,631
Yara Greyjoy has retaken
the Iron Islands in her queen's name.

350
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:06,467
The new Prince of Dorne
pledges his support.

351
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,761
No matter how many lords
turn against her,

352
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,387
as long as she sits
on the Iron Throne,

353
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:13,224
she can call herself
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

354
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:16,519
We need the capital.

355
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:19,355
I watched the people
of King's Landing

356
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,398
rebel against their king
when they were hungry,

357
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:23,484
and that was before winter began.

358
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:27,279
Give them the opportunity
and they will cast Cersei aside.

359
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:30,783
JON: We'll surround the city.

360
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,786
If the Iron Fleet
tries to ferry in more food,

361
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,496
the dragons will destroy them.

362
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,541
If the Lannisters
and the Golden Company attack,

363
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,209
we'll defeat them in the field.

364
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,129
Once the people see
that Cersei is our only enemy,

365
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:45,422
her reign is over.

366
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:52,221
All right.

367
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,974
SANSA: The men we have left
are exhausted.

368
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:57,434
Many of them are wounded.

369
00:32:57,518 --> 00:33:00,604
They'll fight better if they have
time to rest and recuperate.

370
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,107
How long do you suggest?

371
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:07,695
I can't say for certain,
not without talking to the officers.

372
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:14,034
I came north to fight alongside you

373
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:16,745
at great cost to my armies and myself.

374
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:22,209
Now that the time has come
to reciprocate, you want to postpone.

375
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:25,212
It's not just our people. It's yours.

376
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:29,049
You want to throw them into a war
they're not ready to fight?

377
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:32,344
The longer I leave my enemies alone,
the stronger they become.

378
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:38,893
The Northern forces
will honor their promises

379
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,314
and their allegiance
to the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

380
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,571
What you command, we will obey.

381
00:33:55,326 --> 00:33:56,368
TYRION: So...

382
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:59,288
if all are in agreement...

383
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:03,167
Jon and Ser Davos
will ride down the Kingsroad

384
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,293
with the Northern troops

385
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:07,087
and the bulk of the remaining
Dothraki and Unsullied.

386
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:10,049
A smaller group of us
will ride to White Harbor,

387
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,550
and sail from there to Dragonstone

388
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:15,221
with our queen and her dragons
accompanying us from above.

389
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:20,267
Ser Jaime has chosen to remain here,
as a guest of the Lady of Winterfell.

390
00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:25,231
We have won the Great War.

391
00:34:26,232 --> 00:34:27,942
Now we will win the Last War.

392
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:31,278
In all Seven Kingdoms,

393
00:34:31,362 --> 00:34:34,114
men will live without fear and cruelty

394
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,825
under their rightful queen.

395
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:51,257
We need a word.

396
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:58,097
You understand we'd all be dead
if not for her.

397
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,849
We'd be corpses
marching down to King's Landing.

398
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:02,393
Arya's the one
that killed the Night King.

399
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:04,478
Her men gave their lives
defending Winterfell...

400
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:05,813
And we will never forget them.

401
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:07,940
That doesn't mean
that I want to kneel to someone who...

402
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,693
I swore myself and the North
to her cause.

403
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:11,986
I respect that.

404
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:16,198
You respect it?

405
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:18,575
We needed her.

406
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:23,122
We needed her army, her dragons.

407
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:26,333
You did the right thing.

408
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:29,295
And we're doing the right thing
telling you

409
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:30,796
we don't trust your queen.

410
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,259
- You don't know her yet.
- I'll never know her.

411
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,593
She's not one of us.

412
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:38,554
If you only trust the people
you grew up with,

413
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:39,847
you won't make many allies.

414
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,015
That's all right.

415
00:35:41,724 --> 00:35:43,142
I don't need many allies.

416
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:46,020
- JON: (SIGHS) Arya...
- We're family.

417
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:48,522
The four of us.

418
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,275
The last of the Starks.

419
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:56,989
I've never been a Stark.

420
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,949
SANSA: You are.

421
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:02,286
You're just as much Ned Stark's child
as any of us.

422
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:04,121
You're my brother.

423
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:07,207
Not my half-brother
or my bastard brother.

424
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,335
My brother.

425
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:18,344
It's your choice.

426
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:27,561
I need to tell you something.

427
00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:33,192
But you have to swear
you'll never tell another soul.

428
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:37,488
What is it?

429
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:41,825
You have to swear it,
before I tell you.

430
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:45,454
How can I promise to keep a secret
if I don't even know what it is?

431
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:46,955
Because we're family.

432
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:53,379
Swear it.

433
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:55,631
I swear it.

434
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:01,762
I swear it.

435
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,021
Tell them.

436
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,575
So she's going to stay here with you?

437
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,289
She's sworn to protect
the Stark girls, so...

438
00:37:33,127 --> 00:37:34,753
Say something snide.

439
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:36,880
I'm happy.

440
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:38,632
I'm happy that you're happy.

441
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:44,888
I'm happy that you'll finally
have to climb for it.

442
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:47,057
(LAUGHS)

443
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:50,227
Do you know how long I've waited
to tell tall-person jokes?

444
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:52,980
To climbing mountains.

445
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,315
To climbing mountains.

446
00:37:57,985 --> 00:38:00,154
- What's she like down there?
- What?

447
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,948
That's not your concern.

448
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,701
I haven't been with a woman for years.

449
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,244
- Give me a morsel.
- You're a dog.

450
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,413
I am the Imp, and I demand to know.

451
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:11,623
- BRONN: I knew you were fucking her.
- (DOOR THUDS)

452
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:15,002
A pair of tall, blond toffs.

453
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:16,795
Must be like looking in the mirror.

454
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,422
TYRION: Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

455
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,300
Where's your drink?

456
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:24,094
What are you...
What are you doing up North?

457
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:25,512
What are you doing with that?

458
00:38:25,596 --> 00:38:26,680
Oh, this?

459
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:28,891
This is for you.

460
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,018
For both of you.

461
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:33,228
TYRION: You're supposed to be south.

462
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:35,522
You boys are a pair
of gold-plated cunts.

463
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:36,815
- Do you know that?
- That's a bit rude.

464
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:39,026
Year after year,
I've shoveled Lannister shit,

465
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:40,235
and what do I have to show?

466
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:41,904
You're a knight, thanks to me.

467
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:43,780
Thanks to me.
And that title's worth as much

468
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:45,741
as a blond hair
from your brother's ballsack.

469
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,534
Power resides where men believe...

470
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:49,244
BRONN: Shut your mouth.

471
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,914
- TYRION: I'm just trying...
- I've never hit a dwarf before,

472
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:54,124
but say another word
and I will belt you.

473
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,751
See, I don't believe you'd do that.

474
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,002
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

475
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,171
You couldn't do it on your best day,
you one-handed fuck.

476
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,631
And your best days are long gone.

477
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:02,925
(GROANS) You broke my nose!

478
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:04,843
- BRONN: I did not break your nose.
- How do you know?

479
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:07,179
Because I've been breaking noses
since I was your size,

480
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:09,306
and I know what it sounds like.
Now listen.

481
00:39:10,307 --> 00:39:12,601
Your sister offered me Riverrun.

482
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,811
Nice big castle, good lands,

483
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:16,313
plenty of peasants
who do what they're told.

484
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:17,773
And you trust Cersei...

485
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,484
I knew your sister was dead
the second I saw those dragons.

Now, your army may be torn to shit,

487
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:25,113
but I'd still bet
on your Dragon Queen to win.

488

And it just so happens
I'm a betting man.

If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up.

And that's good.
Of course, the odds change

00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:38,544
if the Dragon Queen's Hand
turns up dead.

Maybe a few of her top generals
get picked off one by one.

- Highgarden? Are you mad?
- It's better than being dead.

They were fucking cutthroats.

started, isn't it?

With a hard bastard
who was good at killing people.

513

Kill a few hundred people,
they make you a lord.

Kill a few thousand,
they make you king.

And then all your cocksucking

No, but Jon grew up in Winterfell.

Is marrying your aunt
common in the North?

she wants to share the throne?

She does not like to have
her authority questioned.

with every monarch who ever lived.

will not prevent a slaughter.

that Daenerys Stormborn made
every effort to avoid bloodshed,

749

Perhaps that's the problem.

757
00:59:27,648 --> 00:59:30,651
Her life has convinced her that
she was sent here to save us all.

And how do you know she wasn't?

Then there's the problem of Jon Snow.

You know them both.

01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:04,143
Have you considered the best ruler

01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:05,936
might be someone
who doesn't want to rule?

767

We're discussing treason.

Don't pretend
you haven't thought about it.

769
01:00:11,859 --> 01:00:14,695
Of course I've thought about it.
Thoughts aren't treason.

770
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:19,658
He's temperate and measured.

771
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:23,913
He's a man, which makes him more
appealing to the lords of Westeros,

772
01:00:23,996 --> 01:00:25,456
whose support we are going to need.

773
01:00:26,624 --> 01:00:28,209
Joffrey was a man.

774
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:30,252
I don't think a cock
is a true qualification,

775
01:00:30,336 --> 01:00:31,420
as I'm sure you'd agree.

776
01:00:31,504 --> 01:00:33,589
And he's the heir to the throne.

777
01:00:33,672 --> 01:00:37,468
Yes, because he's a man.
Cocks are important, I'm afraid.

778
01:00:40,429 --> 01:00:42,640
What about my earlier proposal?

779
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:45,726
They could rule together
as king and queen.

780
01:00:47,436 --> 01:00:49,063
She's too strong for him.

781
01:00:49,897 --> 01:00:53,400
She'd bend him to her will,
as she already has.

782
01:00:53,484 --> 01:00:56,070
He could temper her worst impulses.

783
01:00:56,737 --> 01:00:57,947
As you have?

784
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,202
You're drinking quite a lot.

785
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:09,208
A Targaryen father and a Stark mother.

786
01:01:10,209 --> 01:01:11,752
Jon's the one man alive

787
01:01:11,836 --> 01:01:14,880
who might actually be able to keep
the North in the Seven Kingdoms.

have you served?

Five? Six? I've lost count.

790
01:01:17,842 --> 01:01:20,010
- You've always known my reasons.
- At a certain point,

791
01:01:20,094 --> 01:01:22,638
you choose a person you believe in,
and you fight for that person.

792
01:01:22,721 --> 01:01:25,182
Even if you know it's a mistake?

793
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:28,811
I believe in our queen.

794
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:32,857
She'll make the right choice.

795
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:37,945
With the help of her loyal advisors.

796
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,076
You know where my loyalty stands.

797
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:46,495
You know I will never
betray the realm.

798
01:01:46,579 --> 01:01:48,080
What is the realm?

799
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:49,999
A vast continent,
home to millions of people,

800
01:01:50,082 --> 01:01:52,209
most of whom don't care
who sits on the Iron Throne.

801
01:01:52,293 --> 01:01:54,128
Millions of people,
many of whom will die

802
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:56,422
if the wrong person
sits on that throne.

803
01:01:57,172 --> 01:02:00,134
We don't know their names,
but they're just as real as you and I.

804
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:01,510
They deserve to live.

805
01:02:01,594 --> 01:02:03,429
They deserve food for their children.

806
