00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,250
You do look like me.

662
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,170
But fatter. And older.

663
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:25,006
And there's that funny smell.

664
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:29,552
But the resemblance is uncanny.

665
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,096
It's as if...

666

[both] ...we're two characters in a movie

667

being played by the same actor.

669

670
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,859
But I could field a couple of queries.

671
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:48,154
Name the most elegant formula
in mathematics.

672
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,697
Euler's Identity.

673
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,158
E to the I times pi plus one equals zilch.

674
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:55,620
European capitals arranged alphabetically
by the fourth letter.

675
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,497
Riga, Monaco, Sarajevo, Tirana.

676
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,457
The speed of light divided by
the speed of sound,

677
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,709
divided by the speed of the bus
in the movie Speed.

And, for all the marbles...

682
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:14,597
Good. I lost mine.

683
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,808
A rare lung disease,

684
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,978
and the longest word
in the English dictionary.

685
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:21,854

Where have you been... my entire life?

695
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:57,181
Locked in a top-secret prison
for the last 50 years.

696
00:41:57,265 --> 00:42:00,643
Made it kind of hard
to send Christmas cards.

697
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:02,061
Now...

698
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:06,024
you're probably wondering
why I brought you here.

699
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,567
You didn't bring me here!

700
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:11,029
I used my unparalleled intellect
to track you down.

701
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:15,199
Per the plan I concocted with
my unparalleled intellect.

702
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,118
You'll see.

703
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,787
I have the answer to everything.

704
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:23,041
Come on, kiddo.

Oh, no. Oh, no, no.

707

Someone tell me this is some kind of
concussion-induced nightmare.

708
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,480
There's two Eggmen now?

709
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,648
Double your villains, double your fun!

710
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:50,651
Two Robotniks are way worse than one.

711
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:51,819
Chest bump?

712
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:52,737
No.

713
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,990
Stone, why are you tied up?

714
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,743
Do that on your own time. You sicken me.

715
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,287
You must be the long-lost grandson.

716
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,332
And you must be another stinking hedgehog.

717
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,542
So you're the one behind all this.

718
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,961
-The Shadow breakout.
-The attack on Walters.

719
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:10,338
That musty old-man smell.

720
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:14,300
How dare you insult me
with your unsolicited exposition!

721
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,552
Shadow, get the key.

722
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:17,720
Where is it?

723
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:19,972
Ha! Good one, Hot Topic.

724
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:22,225
Do you really think we'd be that stupid

725
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:24,435
to bring the key right to you?

726
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:26,062
Yep, we're that stupid.

727
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,397
GUN took everything from us.

728
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:31,526
And now we are going
to take everything from them.

729
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,944
[Gerald] With this.

730
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:36,781
My masterpiece of malevolence...

731
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,450
The Eclipse Cannon.

732
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:42,703
In exchange for my freedom,

733
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:45,039
I gave GUN the most powerful weapon

734
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,708
mankind has ever seen,

735
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50,503
capable of delivering a precision strike

736
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,963
anywhere on Earth.

737
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:54,632
Our first target:

738
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,176
GUN Headquarters.

739
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,470
But firing a weapon that powerful

740
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:01,597
could threaten millions of innocent lives!

741
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:04,016
-Yeah, tera-bite me.
-[cackles]

742
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:09,105
This is one of two keys required
to launch the Eclipse Cannon.

743
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,607
The other is locked
inside GUN headquarters.

744
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,609
Once we have both,

745
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:16,654
I will take rightful control of my weapon.

746
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,489
I'm in.

747
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,039
Holy crab!

Thank you so much
for inspiring this little adventure.

750
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:35,089
It really worked out for me.

751
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:38,134
And you wonder why I have trust issues!

752

Shadow, wait! Don't do this.

I know you're hurting,

but don't let that change
who you are inside.

Yes. It was getting so boring
without you guys here.

826
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,923
-No offense.
-So... boring. No, none taken.

827
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:29,592
I mean, whatever crazy plan
you're cooking up,

828
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,051
-the answer's yes.
-Yes.

829
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:34,221
Great. But first things first:
What is that?

830
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:35,848
Oh! This is...

831
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,475
[in puppet voice] ...Li'I Tom!

832
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,059
[normal voice] Isn't he great?

833
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:42,897
I told you to get rid of that.
It's very creepy.

834
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,273
[puppet voice]
I told him to get rid of you.

835
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,691
[normal voice] Okay, that's, mmm...

836
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:48,152
-crossing a line there.
-You are in so much trouble.

837
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:53,073
Okay, this is it. The belly of the beast.

838
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:55,451
GUN Headquarters in London.

839
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,621
[gasps] Tom, we're finally gonna
get to see London together.

840
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,748
Hey, I told you we'd
get there someday, baby.

841
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,625
Okay. So here's the plan.

842
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,835
I run in super fast,

843
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:07,004
fly over that water, no problem,

844
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,380
and right when I get to the--

845
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:11,509
[shrieks] What just happened?

846
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:12,801
Congratulations.

847
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:15,179
You just got incinerated
by their energy shield.

848
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:18,015
We'll need to shut it down
by planting a USB drive

849
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:18,974
in their server room

850
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:21,393
that will give me full control over it.

851
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:23,145
That's what we need you two for.

852
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,064
Couple of badass spies,
that's what we are.

853
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,732
Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

854
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,567
[Tails] Once we disable the shield,

855
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:30,611
you'll face the laser hall.

856
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:31,695
[grunts]

857
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,699
These high-density bad boys
will cut you into tiny pieces.

858
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,787
And cut those pieces
into even tinier pieces!

859
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,039
Once again... [shrieks]

860
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,416
-Can't we just get Tom Cruise to do this?
-[Tails] Nope.

861
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,254
Because not even he
could break into... the vault.

862
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:49,838
[Sonic] Why is it empty in there?

863
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:52,800
[Tails] Because we have no idea
what's on the other side of that door.

864
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,719
To prevent the vault from ever
being accessed by a ring,

865
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:58,889
all images and schematics have
been wiped from GUN's database.

866
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:01,016
So for the last leg of this heist...

867
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:04,270
[in puppet voice] ...we're going in blind.

868
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,109
Sorry.

869
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,610
[Maddie] Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

870
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:14,280
It sounds like this plan would
work a heck of a lot better

871
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:19,201
if Sonic used the Master Emerald
to go Golden God mode to get the key.

872
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:21,620
No way, Maddie.

873
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:24,373
The Master Emerald
is too powerful to ever use again.

874
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,834
We made a promise to each other
to keep it hidden.

875
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,169
In a location only Knuckles knows.

876
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:31,463
As guardian of the Master Emerald,

877
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:34,550
anyone who tries to take it away
for any reason...

878
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,635
will become a sworn enemy.

879
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:38,929
Okay, okay! Sheesh!

880
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,723
No need to get all growly on me, buddy.

881
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:44,018
You guys are always telling us
to make good choices.

882
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,978
Well, this is the right choice.

883
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,062
Okay.

884
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,107
I guess we're going to...

885
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,694
["London Town" by Mr Eazi playing]

886
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,499
London, baby!

887
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:13,339
GUN Headquarters is right there.

888
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:17,509
Let me go in, get the key
and destroy anyone in my way!

889
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:19,261
I want revenge.

890
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:20,763
[Gerald] Patience, Shadow.

891
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:23,098
Just let us handle this...

892
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:27,519
and I promise you'll have revenge

893
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:31,440
on a scale you couldn't possibly imagine.

894
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:34,610
Come on, Granddaddy-O, we've got...

895
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:35,861
dirt to do!

896
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:37,821
Suits.

897
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:38,864
Right here, sir.

898
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:41,867
Stone, babysit the hedgehog.

899
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:44,411
Keep the crab on a low boil.

900
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:47,873
It's time for more family bonding.

901
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:53,879
Come on, Shadow.

902
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:57,841
Got fresh avocados in the crab.
We'll make guac.

903
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,804
Revenge guac!

904
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:13,774
Guys, are you ready for me yet?
I've been waiting here all day.

905
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:19,488
Sonic, we literally just started.

906
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,865
Tom, Maddie,
are you in position and ready?

907
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:24,159
-We were born ready.
-Let's do this.

908
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:25,494
[Tails] Knuckles, how about you?

909
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,871
I have taken my perch
atop the giant clock.

910
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:30,708
Now, where is this glass
I'm supposed to break?

911
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:34,878
Actually, Knucks, your job
is to "Break Glass in Case of Emergency.”

912
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:36,213
Understood.

913
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:39,925
I will shatter this glass
like the jaw of a vile foe.

914
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:42,010
In case of emergency.

915
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:44,888
I will pulverize it like
the skull of a loathsome rival!

916
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:48,183
Just to be clear,
the "emergency" is the important part.

917
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:52,479
The glass will beg for mercy
under the shadow of my mighty fist!

918
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:54,106
Guys, remember, we're a team.

919
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:55,357
-Let's focus.
-Please.

920
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:56,942
[Sonic] You know what? Let's move on.

921
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,944
All right, everyone knows what to do.

922
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,196
Tom and Maddie,
you guys plant the USB drive.

923
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,907
I'll disable the traps.
Sonic will snag the launch key.

924
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:05,826
And Knuckles, you stand by to--

925
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,370
Break glass in case of emergency.

926
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:09,747
See? He gets it.

927
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,290
Then we're all set.

928
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:12,916
Hologram time.

929
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,419
You go first.

930
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:19,298
Tom, it's me, Rachel!

931
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,300
Can you believe it?
We're both in London together.

932
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,302
Have you met your sister? Try again.

933
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,428
Unless...

934
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,263
you're not up for this mission.

935
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,849
Yeah, maybe you want to be back
in Green Hills, baking sourdough.

936
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,684
-Thomas Michael Wachowski!
-Gah!

937
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:32,102
You brought aliens to my wedding,

938
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:34,271
punched out my husband
and buried me in an avalanche.

939
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,398
Your day of reckoning is at hand!

940
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:37,566
Yeah, that's perfect.

941
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:40,068
Okay, now for her better half.

942
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:46,742
Ho-ho, my name is Randall,
and I am too much to handle!

943
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,535
Welcome to the gun show!

944
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:51,789
Baby, would you describe me
as jacked, juiced,

945
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:54,166
or shredded?

946
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:57,294
I would describe your head as swollen.
Let's get to work.

947
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:02,633
Agent Randall Handel.

948
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:05,469
I'm here to have lunch
with my lovely wife, Rachel.

949
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:06,970
[desk guard] I'm sorry, Agent Handel,

950
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:09,431
this facility's currently locked down.

951
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:11,225
Command-level clearance only.

952
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,851
One minute.

953
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:16,563
Tails... we have a problem here.

954
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:19,650
Wow, they must have tightened security
after Shadow's escape.

955
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,193
I got this.

956
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:23,862
You must be new here.

957
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:26,698
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Rachel.

958
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:28,158
Rachel Gonna get you fired.

959
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:31,161
Do you know what GUN stands for?

960
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:33,747
-Well, 'course. Guardian Units--
-[mimics buzzer]

961
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:36,500
Getting. Ultra. Nasty.

962
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:39,169
Do you want me...

963
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,129
to get ultra nasty?

964
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:43,382
Nasty nasty?

965
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,092
-No, ma'am.
-Okay, then.

966
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,927
Then go ahead
and take those little sad fingers

967
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,554
and start tippity type-type-typing!

968
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:51,390
Mm-hmm. That's right, go on.

969
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,142
Sorry for the inconvenience, ma'am.

970
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:55,352
Mm-hmm.

971
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:58,063
That's what I thought!

972
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:03,735
My God, I love being Rachel!

973
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,123
-Did it work?
-Oh, yeah.

974
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,458
Oh! Ouch!

975
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:22,212
Director Rockwell seeking
access to the server room.

976
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:23,505
Just one moment, ma'am.

977
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,759
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
It's her. It's the real her!

978
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:29,595
-The incident in Colorado?
-We're still assessing.

979
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:31,013
What do you mean, we're still assessing?

980
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:33,098
-What do we do?
-Quick, change faces!

981
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,391
Okay. Did it work?

982
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,518
Who am |7 What's going on?

983
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:39,021
Why are you looking at me like that?

Professor, is this really
what Maria would have wanted?

1320

The question isn't
what Maria would have wanted.

1321
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:33,631
It's what do they deserve.

1322

Remember what she meant to us.

1323

-Hmm?

By combining our genius,
we can rule humanity.

Together!

1351
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:18,587
Humanity is a failed experiment.

If anyone should know that, it's you.

1353
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:26,011
All your life,
you've been rejected by this world.

1354

You have nothing down there.

1355

No one who cares about you.

1356
01:19:33,978 --> 01:19:35,521
But I have you now.

We're family.

We have each other.

Oh, Ivo...

you're no Maria.

The moment I lost her,
my family was gone forever!

1362
01:19:57,376 --> 01:19:59,211
The only way to give Maria's life meaning

1363
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:01,547
is to destroy the world
that took her from me.

01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:04,550
So I'm burning it all down!

It's done.

1366

Good work, Shadow.

You will have justice.

Impossible. It's moving too fast.

And you've made the same choice I did.

No.

even more powerful than pain.

01:39:54,989 --> 01:39:56,866
We're stronger than ever.

1638
01:39:56,949 --> 01:39:59,452
And nothing is gonna stand in our way.

1639
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:04,540
Except that one piece
of unfinished business.

1640
01:40:13,591 --> 01:40:16,719
And way out in front,
to the surprise of absolutely no one,

1641
01:40:16,802 --> 01:40:18,095
it's the Blue Blur!

1642
01:40:18,179 --> 01:40:20,014
Often imitated, never duplicated,

1643
01:40:20,097 --> 01:40:21,390
the one, the only...

1644
01:40:21,474 --> 01:40:22,308
[yells]

1645
01:40:22,391 --> 01:40:23,976
Let's do this!

1646
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:26,312
Yeah! [laughs]

1647
01:40:26,395 --> 01:40:29,482
-[yells]
-All right, boys, try and keep up.

1648
01:40:30,191 --> 01:40:32,068
[all cheering, whooping]

1649
01:40:36,572 --> 01:40:39,575
["Run It" by Jelly Roll playing]

1650
01:42:25,890 --> 01:42:29,435
Sonic the Hedgehog
is Family Champion once again!

1651
01:42:30,102 --> 01:42:31,145
Tails?

1652
01:42:31,729 --> 01:42:33,230
Knuckles?

1653
01:42:34,857 --> 01:42:37,818
Okay. Yeah, I overshot the finish line.

1654
01:42:41,739 --> 01:42:43,240
[electronic whirring]

1655
01:42:46,744 --> 01:42:49,747
[Sonic] Okay, so how do I get back?

1656
01:42:52,291 --> 01:42:54,001
[weapon powering up]

1657
01:42:54,835 --> 01:42:56,796
[beeping]

1658
01:43:01,175 --> 01:43:02,343
[Sonic] Pro tip:

1659
01:43:02,426 --> 01:43:05,930
If you're gonna take a shot
at the fastest creature in the universe...

1660
01:43:08,307 --> 01:43:09,892
you'd better not miss.

1661
01:43:13,729 --> 01:43:18,025
Um... I'm flattered by the cosplay,
but you got a few details wrong.

1662
01:43:18,109 --> 01:43:21,278
I can't blame you, though.
It's hard to copy perfection.

1663
01:43:31,372 --> 01:43:33,374
That's a neat trick.

1664
01:43:42,007 --> 01:43:43,217
[Sonic yelps]

1665
01:43:45,302 --> 01:43:47,179
What? Who are you?

1666
01:50:02,262 --> 01:50:03,263
English (US) - SDH
