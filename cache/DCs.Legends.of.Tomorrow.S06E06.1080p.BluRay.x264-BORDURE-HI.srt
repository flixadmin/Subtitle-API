1
00:00:05,507 --> 00:00:06,633
But I just killed you.

2
00:00:06,716 --> 00:00:09,969
It's a delicious little mystery for you
to turn over in that pretty little head,

3
00:00:10,053 --> 00:00:11,137
isn't it, Sara Lance?

4
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:12,137
No, you're dead.

5
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:14,266
You're not the only one
who has flirted with death.

6
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:16,059
How?

7
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,354
[singing] <i>You'll never guess
In a billion years</i>

8
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:20,772
You're a clone.

9
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:23,441
Okay, yes, you got it.

10
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:25,151
Just like the Avas.

11
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:28,488
No, no, not like the Avas. Different.

12
00:00:28,571 --> 00:00:31,783
There's only one of me, one at a time.

13
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:36,663
We're all just coding, Sara.

14
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:39,749
DNA can be mapped and cloned,
and each and every data point

15
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:42,544
in our brain can be mapped, and cloned.

16
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:46,214
You can recreate yourself,
body, and mind?

17
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:49,676
Mind is just impulses,
synapses and memory.

18
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,177
No different from any computer.

19
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:55,807
Look, science has evolved quite a bit
beyond your comprehension.

20
00:00:57,225 --> 00:01:02,355
You're like a caveman to me,
like a monkey, like a cave monkey.

21
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:04,566
Imagine what you could have done,

22
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:08,027
if you'd used that knowledge for good,
instead of this.

23
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:10,280
I am using it for good.

24
00:01:10,363 --> 00:01:13,116
I am restarting the doomed human race,

25
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:16,786
and you will see that... eventually.

26
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:20,248
You will see it my way in time.

27
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:22,417
[singing] <i>And you've got
Nothing but time</i>

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,171
<i>Because no one's coming to save you</i>

29
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:38,433
You drank all the booze.

30
00:01:39,309 --> 00:01:40,852
Not my fault you couldn't keep up.

31
00:01:41,686 --> 00:01:43,730
I can only hold two glasses at a time,

32
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:48,610
unlike you, who can hold eight
with your... tentacle things.

33
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,238
- Or you're just a lightweight.
- Oxygen mask.

34
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,243
Atmosphere is Earth-like.
Bishop's terraforming the place.

35
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:00,872
As long as you don't go past his
electrostatic barrier, you'll be fine.

36
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:05,627
- [Mick] What if Sara's past the barrier?
- [Kayla] Then she's already dead.

37
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,670
The air out there
would kill most creatures

38
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:10,590
and you don't want to meet
the native ones who could survive it.

39
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:13,384
You seem scared.

40
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:15,637
I'm not scared. I'm smart.

41
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:17,221
Let's go find my ship.

42
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:19,515
Then we find Sara.

43
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:26,439
[creature snarling]

44
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:41,119
[doorbell ringing]

45
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:42,622
What the hell?

46
00:02:44,207 --> 00:02:45,249
That's me!

47
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:51,464
Hello there,
twelve pizzas for a Beh... Bernard...

48
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,926
- Twelve pizzas, really?
- No fabricator.

49
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,469
You got to plan ahead, right?

50
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,891
Really don't think Gideon's
gonna appreciate being installed

51
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,644
on a cathode ray tube from 1974, John.

52
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:08,022
TV rots your brains, love.
Oh, cripes, I'm hungover.

53
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:10,983
At least she can track down aliens
so we can do our job,

54
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:12,902
until Rory returns with Sara. Ow!

55
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:14,112
[electricity crackling]

56
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:17,031
Um, is anything in this room,
by chance, flammable?

57
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:18,866
I need some bloody tea.

58
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,620
[exclaims]

59
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:28,042
- What the hell is this, eh?
- Ah, the anti-alien security system.

60
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:31,170
You know those greenies are gonna try
to make a move on us here.

61
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:33,464
- We'll be ready.
- That's what took my tea?

62
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:36,217
Zari said they'd make
a good skincare treatment.

63
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,886
You know, I got these roadside
caffeine pills, though.

64
00:03:41,806 --> 00:03:46,728
Stay off the black tiles, unless
you like pumiliotoxin-tipped darts.

65
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,062
Great.

66
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:54,318
Zari!

67
00:03:56,237 --> 00:04:00,074
See, names and nomenclature imply
we aren't all the same organism,

68
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:01,951
living and breathing as one.

69
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:05,496
So I'm also Behrad Tarazi.

70
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,374
Everyone is, and they aren't.

71
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:10,001
Ah, bro...

72
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:12,879
Johnny! This guitar is sick.

73
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:14,338
Can I pluck a little "Stairway"?

74
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:16,507
Oh, yeah, sure, mate.
You and your Legend cohorts

75
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:19,135
- can do anything you like, apparently.
- Ah, thanks, gorg.

76
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:25,099
Grant me the flame of knowledge.

77
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:26,934
[exclaims]

78
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:29,145
- Ooh!
- Making progress.

79
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:31,814
That's great, love. That's really great.

80
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:33,858
You carry on, go on.

81
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:37,779
- Oh, my head!
- [Zari] Oh, John, John!

82
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:41,365
They've turned this place
into a bloody insane asylum.

83
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:44,202
I know. Let's go out
and find you some breakfast.

84
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,956
Black pudding, baked beans
and bubble and squeak.

85
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,125
- I love bubble and squeak.
- I know.

86
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:58,508
[Kayla sighs] The thing's
in rough shape,

87
00:04:58,591 --> 00:04:59,991
and it needs a whole new fuel cell.

88
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:01,968
Damn it.

89
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:04,806
My mother got me that ship
for my 300th rotation.

90
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:06,516
Where's Sara?

91
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:10,978
Judging by the presence of that trooper,
she's already captured.

92
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:15,149
Time for a chat. Here.

93
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:19,444
[gun powering up]

94
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:20,447
Drop it.

95
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,115
Where's Sara?

96
00:05:24,617 --> 00:05:25,827
I need backup.

97
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:27,619
Ava.

98
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:31,165
Clones.

99
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,670
[grunts]

100
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,673
Little help here!

101
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:41,175
Scared, huh?

102
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,759
Not scared.

103
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:44,637
Smart.

104
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,768
Hey! I was going to steal that.

105
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,610
[discordant guitar notes playing]

106
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:01,153
Thank you, Captain Sharpe.

107
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:04,991
It's good to be back.
What is that noise?

108
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:07,660
It's just the sound of everybody
trying to get comfortable here.

109
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:11,289
So, any time anomalies?
What do you got for me, Gideon?

110
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:12,707
[archaic modem noise]

111
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:17,044
Yes. It seems there was a massacre
by a patient of the alien variety

112
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:20,047
at Endless Meadows Asylum
in 1956.

113
00:06:20,131 --> 00:06:23,092
Perfect. Anything to keep my mind off
Sara's rescue mission.

114
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:24,259
Um...

115
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:29,307
"Um"? What's "um"?
Gideon, you don't "um."

116
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,811
When admitted to the hospital,
the patient gave the name Sara Lance.

117
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,354
[banging and clattering]

118
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:38,274
[Nate] I'm okay! Don't tell John.

119
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,818
[theme music playing]

120
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:55,917
According to records,
the patient flew into a manic episode

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,169
during a procedure,
causing the massacre.

122
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:01,589
Victims were found
with sting marks and exploded hearts.

123
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:02,924
We never meet the chill aliens.

124
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:06,510
Okay, so we need to find out what it
knows and why it's using Sara's name.

125
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:07,929
We should probably also make sure

126
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:09,680
this thing doesn't kill
a bunch of people.

127
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:10,764
Right.

128
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:13,143
You could, and please,
believe me,

129
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,478
I am not trying
to get you all massacred,

130
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:17,145
bring it back here.

131
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,899
Mmm. Speaking purely as a house guest,

132
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:22,360
is bringing a rampaging alien
back to John's house

133
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:23,945
something we should run by him first?

134
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,113
No, definitely not.

135
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,994
[Spooner] You know, sanitariums,
not really my thing.

136
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:35,748
[sighs] Keep that
antenna going, Spooner.

137
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:37,458
Let me know if you get any weird vibes.

138
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,087
Oh, I got weird vibes.

139
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:45,715
Welcome.

140
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:48,844
Checking in your wife?
Hysteria or the blues?

141
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:51,138
Oh, no. We're here to pick up my sister.

142
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:53,933
Yes, she used the name Sara Lance.

143
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:55,810
Oh, yes, of course.

144
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,271
She was in a frenzy when she arrived
and had to be sedated.

145
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:01,941
But don't worry.
She's scheduled for a very effective

146
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:03,693
electric shock treatment later today.

147
00:08:03,776 --> 00:08:04,776
Fantastic.

148
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:08,322
That must be what set her off to kill.

149
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:10,908
I'm getting some weird alien vibes
behind those doors.

150
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:16,747
We are just glad we have someone here
to give us the real story.

151
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:19,583
She said that she flew here
in a spaceship.

152
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,002
Could you imagine?

153
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:24,422
Sara, your brother is here.

154
00:08:26,382 --> 00:08:27,383
Don't be alarmed.

155
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,802
Sometimes she goes by
different names in the moment.

156
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:32,346
Mary Pickford, uh, Marion Davies.

157
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,849
Her favorite, though, is Amelia Earhart.

158
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:37,435
Yes?

159
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:43,232
Are we going somewhere?

160
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,111
Could you imagine
if it was the real Amelia?

161
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,155
She'd be 60 by now.

162
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:51,574
What's her secret, am I right?

163
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:53,909
Yeah. What is her secret?

164
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,669
[Constantine] Oh, nice one, love.

165
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:08,299
You know, I thought I was gonna go batty
in this madhouse.

166
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:12,178
What in the bloody blazes
has happened now?

167
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:14,013
Astra!

168
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:15,305
[all] Shh!

169
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,811
Who is that woman on my telly?

170
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,897
Is that Amelia Earhart?

171
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,902
It's an alien shaped like Amelia Earhart
that also uses the name Sara Lance.

172
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:32,698
And she's also totally knocked out
on some pretty gnarly '50s 'ludes.

173
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:34,784
We're waiting to see
if she's gonna freak out

174
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,660
and try to murder us when she detoxes.

175
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,663
Did you guys eat all
the gluten-free mushroom?

176
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:42,708
For the record, Captain,
this plan is stupid.

177
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:46,003
Look, I say we go right in there
and talk to it.

178
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,632
Yeah, that's right, turned a new leaf.

179
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:52,802
Maybe I'm not a shoot first,
ask questions kind of girl.

180
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:54,177
Huh.

181
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:55,680
- Hmm. Nice.
- That's great, Spooner.

182
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:57,556
You're working on yourself.
I am impressed.

183
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,225
Yeah. Why just splat them

184
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:02,520
when you can find out
their deepest fears and exploit them?

185
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:06,148
Mmm. Spooner... now I'm impressed.

186
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:08,192
That was dark.

187
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,736
B, why don't you and Spooner

188
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,030
go and play a little bad cop,
Behrad cop,

189
00:10:13,114 --> 00:10:14,824
and see if we get this Amelia talking.

190
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:17,701
- I like your style, chief.
- What?

191
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:19,787
It's gonna be fine, trust me.

192
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,497
Well, I'm off.

193
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,791
Something about watching
a prisoner interrogated

194
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:26,460
makes me nostalgic
for the good old days back in hell.

195
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:28,378
[sighs]

196
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:32,925
Please just...
Please, please, tell us where Sara is.

197
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:45,104
<i>Are you spying on me?</i>

198
00:10:57,283 --> 00:11:00,077
[sighs] There! Finally alone.

199
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,622
What the...

200
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:15,008
Ugh.

201
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,310
[grunting]

202
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,733
I finally found you.

203
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:33,986
I searched through
every sewage pipe in the facility.

204
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:36,154
Ugh!

205
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:39,450
- You were in the pipes?
- Yeah.

206
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:42,286
You ever see an octopus
squeeze through a hole?

207
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:43,913
My body's like that.

208
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,540
Necrians take great pride
in our scrunching.

209
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:48,292
Too bad you can't ride the pipes with me

210
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,878
because I discovered
where the fuel cells are kept.

211
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,172
We can fly Kayla's ship out of here.

212
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:57,009
Gary, get back in that toilet
and get the fuel cell to the ship.

213
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:58,302
I'll find my own way out.

214
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,179
Can I count on you?

215
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,096
I'm your man.

216
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,475
Alien man.

217
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:09,312
Happy trails.

218
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:14,234
[toilet flushing]

219
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:22,785
[Spooner] Rise and shine, Mia.

220
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:24,787
Baby steps.

221
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:28,207
Maybe we can get you
those easy-wake lamps.

222
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:34,421
For now, there's tea.
We're taking this nice and easy.

223
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,425
Where am I?

224
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,469
You're at Shady Acres.

225
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,138
It's the chillest sanitarium there is.

226
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:45,766
Spooner, you picking up
any alien brainwaves?

227
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,351
No.

228
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:50,312
There's something going on,
but it's still too quiet.

229
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,315
<i>I'm thinking she's still feeling
the Quaaludes.</i>

230
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:59,321
Oh, don't mind her. We're just here
to ask you a few questions.

231
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:03,325
- What kind of questions?
- Easy ones.

232
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:06,287
Do you ever get the urge
to freak out and attack people?

233
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:11,250
What she meant to ask is,
why do you use the name Sara Lance?

234
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:13,836
Sara Lance.

235
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:16,672
Doesn't ring a bell.

236
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,260
I don't think I like you very much.

237
00:13:24,013 --> 00:13:25,597
You're not very nice.

238
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:29,643
May I have some more?

239
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:43,449
[Behrad] Say, how did you end up
at Endless Meadows?

240
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:45,993
[Amelia] Wish I had an answer for you.

241
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:48,746
Last thing I remember,
I was soaring over the Pacific.

242
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:52,541
Me and my navigator, Fred,
almost done our flight around the globe.

243
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,461
That does sound like something
the actual Amelia Earhart would say.

244
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:57,755
Or she's just a very good shapeshifter.

245
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:01,174
[sniffing]

246
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:05,429
Well, the important thing is
you're back in one piece, right?

247
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:09,808
Don't know if I can say that
about my plane back.

248
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:11,727
She's got to be talking about the pod.

249
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,853
- Right?
- Yeah.

250
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:14,772
Hey, find out where its pod is.

251
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:17,608
Do you remember where you landed it?

252
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:19,526
Landed it right by my old house.

253
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,237
37 Locust Street, Rye, New York.

254
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,239
I love when aliens give

255
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:25,574
- exact addresses.
- Yeah.

256
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,994
Okay, keep it calm and friendly.
We're gonna go check out the pod.

257
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,503
[Kayla] All right, there are the cells.

258
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:40,089
Now all I need is a distraction.

259
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:49,139
Idiot. Biggest in the galaxy.

260
00:14:57,106 --> 00:14:58,857
Intruder by the cells!

261
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,066
[gasps]

262
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,047
- [Ava clone shouts indistinctly]
- Whoa.

263
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:05,511
[Ava clone] Hey, stay where you are.

264
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:08,951
Hey, you're the freak that ate D squad.
Put it back.

265
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,828
I have regrets about that.

266
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:14,331
I just need one little battery.

267
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:15,749
And then I'll be...

268
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:19,420
[chuckles] Damn, those clones are handy.

269
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:25,968
[Nate] Getting a radiation reading,
but I don't see a crash site.

270
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,051
[Geiger counter clicking]

271
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,430
Gotta be here somewhere.

272
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:31,098
If it can help Amelia to talk,

273
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:34,351
maybe we can get an idea of when
Rory and Sara are coming back, right?

274
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:36,019
Then do I hear wedding bells?

275
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:42,483
No.

276
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:43,568
[key fob chirps]

277
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:52,119
Amelia Earhart was talking about
the <i>Waverider?</i>

278
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,370
It's impossible.

279
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,083
Sara, are you there?

280
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,460
Rory?

281
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:02,879
Sara?

282
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,092
Hey, Bishop.

283
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:09,261
[clears throat] Yoo-hoo!

What you doing out there?</i>

<i>Want to come check
If you dare</i>

286
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,398
I love it.

287
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:24,568
Oh, it thrills me to see
you're in a good mood.

288
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:25,818
I am.

289
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,197
And you know what,
I have been thinking.

290
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:30,449
Oh... About what?

291
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:32,158
You.

292
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:38,081
I can't deny the fact that what
you've done here, it is astonishing.

293
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,334
And I didn't want to admit it at first.

294
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:41,919
But it's true.

295
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:45,130
You are humanity's best hope.

296
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:52,513
Can I just say, "Thank you,
for seeing me"?

297
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:56,767
I do, and I want to be a part of it.

298
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:04,358
So I'm hoping that we could
just put the past behind us.

299
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:09,863
Put the past behind us.
I am listening. I am interested.

300
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:13,784
Well, I can forget about the fact
that you imprisoned me,

301
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,286
if you forget about me
snapping your neck?

302

Bygones.

304

I couldn't have said it better myself.
I love this new turn of events.

Tonight,

308
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,178
we'll make a fresh start.

309

Dinner at 8:00.

310
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,474
Choose something groovy
from the wardrobe.

311
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:39,309
Of course. Oh! But it...

312
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:43,689
It might be kind of hard
to get dressed with these.

313
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:45,649
Oh... Yeah, of course.

314
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:50,944
Aw!

[both laughing]

316
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:02,124
Oh, you.

317
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:08,422
Me and my navigator, Fred,
almost done our flight around the globe.

318
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:09,965
I thought the tea was herbal.

319
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:12,134
I may have snuck

His name's Mick Rory.
He seems to know Sara Lance.

then you'll do irreparable damage

Yeah. No offense, Astra.

He saved my life.

I'm so sorry about D squad,
no matter how delicious they were,

knowingly eaten an Ava.

You're the most remarkable women
I've ever met.

The Ava I know, she's a great leader,
has amazing hair just like you,

and still has time for her
one true pairing, Sara.

She must be a great leader
to have a great servant like you.

493

Well, I wouldn't say
I'm the best assistant, but, um... yeah.

Is Astra okay?
Seemed like a lot for a beginner.

495

She'll recover.

Okay, enough.

You're not gonna tell her? Fine.

511

I will.

512
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:08,558
John owed me and I was tired of playing
second fiddle, so, I took the lead.

513
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:10,435
Right.

Now, what good would John Constantine be
without magic, eh?

You know, I'd still find use for you.

Well, that is good.
That is more than good. That is great.

Ava, bring on the appes.

She's probably just putting
final touches on the appes.

I had to drop the artificial atmosphere,

No.

Honestly, I don't see why it matters.
We're putting our pasts behind us.

00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,409
I'm so sorry.

643
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:12,328
He killed her.

644
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:31,430
Avas...

645
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:35,351
Still holding on to all that anger.

646
00:40:35,726 --> 00:40:37,227
Not healthy.

647
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:39,355
How are we going to start fresh?

648
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:40,940
I don't start fresh.

649
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:45,277
Now, see, this is
what you got wrong about me.

650
00:40:45,945 --> 00:40:51,700
Every scar on my body is a memory,
a lesson that I learned in blood.

651
00:40:52,368 --> 00:40:54,370
And it's what makes me who I am.

652
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:58,082
And I don't forget any of it.

653
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:02,044
Now, we've both faced death.
We've both died before.

654
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:04,672
The difference is,
I learned from my scars.

655
00:41:04,755 --> 00:41:08,676
And you...
You've just forgotten yours.

656
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:12,888
But, Sara, I don't see any scars on you.

657
00:41:44,712 --> 00:41:47,798
Oh, there are those scars,

658
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,552
on the dead body of the real Sara Lance.

659
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:02,479
