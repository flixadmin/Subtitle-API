[Adam] I know when wars begin and end...

what discoveries science makes
in the next few years...

00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,338
what shares to invest in.

But I don't know
what my counterpart will do...

as long as I haven't seen his future.

But you know my future.
You know what I'm going to do.

I am your future.

181
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:14,546
There must be a way to change everything.

00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,588
So that things happen differently.

183

A loophole.

184
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:24,505
It took me 66 years
to discover a way out of all this.

185
00:17:25,255 --> 00:17:27,880
A way to finally leave this hell.

186
00:17:33,421 --> 00:17:35,588
[Clausen] I've been here about a week,

187
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,130
and I get the impression
no one here is telling the truth.

188
00:17:40,713 --> 00:17:42,671
Everyone's hiding something.

189
00:17:44,255 --> 00:17:47,380
What I don't know is
whether everyone is hiding the same thing,

190
00:17:47,463 --> 00:17:51,671
or if they all have their own skeletons
in the closet respectively.

Is he paying you?

00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,171
Aleksander Tiedemann.

00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,796
I don't quite follow.

194
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:14,046
You worked for him as a physiotherapist.
You've stopped now, correct?

195
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,130
Mm-hmm.

196
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:20,713
And yet he still wires you
the same amount every month.

197
00:18:21,755 --> 00:18:26,421
One would normally require a service
in return. What exactly is the service?

198
00:18:35,421 --> 00:18:38,630
What you don't understand
is that we support each other.

That's all.

It's quite remarkable

that Mrs. Nielsen is
also so understanding.

Uh, maybe that's how it is
in small towns like this.

00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:07,380
He's Adam's puppet.

215
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:10,505
He killed the children.

He's not my real grandfather.

[Claudia] The incident last summer...

265
00:24:38,005 --> 00:24:42,588
You said it was the result of a reaction
in the volume control system.

266
00:24:43,963 --> 00:24:47,088
I checked the data.
Everything was normal.

00:24:48,546 --> 00:24:49,755
So?

00:24:51,546 --> 00:24:53,421
What really happened?

I knew you'd always refuse to let this go.

270
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:09,463
After the incident,
I had a sample taken and analyzed.

271
00:25:09,546 --> 00:25:12,171
What you see there are the results.

272
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,046
These values... They don't make sense.

273
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,213
I thought so too, initially.

274
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:28,088
So I had them run the tests another time.
The results were always the same.

275
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,921
If the data is correct, then...

276
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,296
- is this what I think it is?
- It's possible.

277
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,171
It corresponds in several ways
with the calculations

278
00:25:37,255 --> 00:25:38,963
of Englert, Brout and Higgs.

that gives all things the mass they have.

This is just sensational.

284
00:25:57,755 --> 00:26:01,380
If this data is correct,
we have to make it available to everyone.

than you could with your own fate.

333
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,713
God...

334
00:30:49,296 --> 00:30:50,755
is time.

335
00:30:52,755 --> 00:30:54,755
And time is not compassionate.

336
00:30:56,005 --> 00:30:59,880
The instant we're born
our lives start to trickle away,

337
00:30:59,963 --> 00:31:02,213
like the sand in this hourglass.

338
00:31:02,296 --> 00:31:04,546
Death is always inevitable.

339
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,796
Our destiny

340
00:31:06,588 --> 00:31:10,130
is nothing but the connection
of cause and effect.

341

347

Charlotte.

348
00:32:23,963 --> 00:32:25,796
What do you want from me?

349
00:32:32,005 --> 00:32:34,463
- I am Noah.
- I know who you are.

350
00:32:39,088 --> 00:32:41,213
You've been killing the children.

351
00:32:47,046 --> 00:32:49,921
I can't make you
change your mind about me.

352
00:32:51,005 --> 00:32:52,255
But...

353
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,130
perhaps one day you will understand

354
00:32:56,213 --> 00:33:00,755
that I only did all this to finally put
a stop to everything once and for all.

355
00:33:05,546 --> 00:33:08,005
So you won't be taken from me again.

356
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,880
Just like your mother was.

[ominous music]

They didn't think you had much of a chance
when you were born.

359
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,588
You were premature, tiny.

360
00:33:30,296 --> 00:33:32,796
But you wanted to live.
You were so strong.

361
00:33:35,338 --> 00:33:38,505
Your little hand grabbed my finger
and wouldn't let go of it.

362
00:33:38,588 --> 00:33:39,963
Stop it!

363
00:33:42,046 --> 00:33:43,755
This isn't possible.

364
00:33:51,171 --> 00:33:53,463
Your mother took this picture.

365
00:33:56,546 --> 00:33:59,213
I promised her I'd bring you back.

366
00:34:01,338 --> 00:34:03,296
I kept searching for you.

367
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,421
But you were here all along.

368
00:34:10,463 --> 00:34:13,130
- [gasps softly]
- Adam knew it was you.

369
00:34:15,588 --> 00:34:17,338
He knew it the whole time.

370
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,088
He is preparing for what's to come.

371
00:34:22,546 --> 00:34:25,005
I've read all of the last notes.

372
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:27,963
The nuclear plant, Jonas.

373
00:34:28,046 --> 00:34:30,963
It's all going to happen again,
the apocalypse.

374
00:34:31,046 --> 00:34:32,505
In two days.

375
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:34,630
But I know now...

376
00:34:36,005 --> 00:34:37,671
what I have to do.

377
00:34:42,005 --> 00:34:45,296
I have to end Adam
so that everyone else can live.

378
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:49,921
Not just those in the bunker.

379
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:57,838
[Charlotte] Who is my mother?

380
00:35:07,588 --> 00:35:09,338
She loved you very much.

381
00:35:13,213 --> 00:35:14,963
She still loves you.

[Franziska] The chair is gone.

388
00:36:07,005 --> 00:36:11,296
- [Magnus] What's going on?
- [Bartosz] I didn't believe it at first.

389
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,546
But then he told me about things
that were going to happen.

390
00:36:15,671 --> 00:36:17,671
And they all eventually did.

391
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,546
That...

392
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,796
you and Jonas would kiss each other.

393
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,088
He told me about it before you did it.

394
00:36:29,005 --> 00:36:31,296
That my mother would get cancer.

395
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,380
That Jonas would vanish.

396
00:36:35,255 --> 00:36:36,880
Who told you this stuff?

397
00:36:39,713 --> 00:36:41,713
- Noah.
- Noah?

398
00:36:42,546 --> 00:36:44,380
The priest? Tall, blue eyes?

399
00:36:45,046 --> 00:36:47,880
- You know him?
- I don't, but Elisabeth does.

400
00:36:48,755 --> 00:36:50,588
Okay, what is all this?

401
00:36:51,338 --> 00:36:53,130
Noah said it's about a war.

402
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,296
About controlling time.

403
00:36:57,296 --> 00:36:59,421
That my grandmother is involved.

404
00:36:59,505 --> 00:37:02,463
- That Jonas would return and that...
- [Martha] Jonas?

405
00:37:04,463 --> 00:37:06,046
Jonas will return?

406
00:37:06,713 --> 00:37:09,296
Yes, he's a part of this war.

407

[scoffs]

408
00:37:13,046 --> 00:37:14,630
[Magnus] I'm going home.

409
00:37:19,088 --> 00:37:21,005
Do you trust me?

410
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:30,213

Michael!

414
00:37:58,713 --> 00:38:00,963
Egon, it's Ines.

415
00:38:01,046 --> 00:38:06,588
I know this sounds strange, but I got home
and Michael isn't here and...

416
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,380
The man who broke out
of the psychiatric clinic. I...

417
00:38:11,463 --> 00:38:13,880
What man broke out of the clinic?

418
00:38:13,963 --> 00:38:15,963
It was all over the radio.

419

Do you remember

420
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:22,338
the kids from the construction site
in 1953?

421
00:38:22,421 --> 00:38:25,088
That man, that's who broke out.

422
00:38:25,171 --> 00:38:29,463
I'll get in touch with the station.
I might know where they're headed.

I promise.

It's all your fault.
It always has been.

I swear, next time I will kill you!

[oppressive music]

444

[Adam] Mikkel,

445
00:39:43,421 --> 00:39:46,005
Michael, our father,

446
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:49,338
is just a small part of a knot

447
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:52,671
that is infinitely greater
and more convoluted.

448
00:39:54,046 --> 00:39:57,838
The entire universe
is nothing but a giant knot

449
00:39:57,921 --> 00:40:00,421
from which there is no escape.

450
00:40:01,046 --> 00:40:02,630
If that's the case,

451
00:40:03,546 --> 00:40:06,463
if everything is tied forever
in this knot,

452
00:40:06,546 --> 00:40:11,838
if nothing can change... then haven't you
already had this conversation?

453
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:14,421
And asked that very question.

454
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,921
All my life I was convinced that...

455
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:21,421
this moment here

456
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,546
could never be repeated this way.

457
00:40:25,671 --> 00:40:27,755
I would never be able to say the words

458
00:40:28,546 --> 00:40:31,463
that my older self said to me back then.

459
00:40:34,671 --> 00:40:36,671
Because I couldn't understand

460
00:40:37,421 --> 00:40:39,630
how I could ever want

461
00:40:40,255 --> 00:40:42,005
what he wanted.

462
00:40:45,546 --> 00:40:46,838
Now,

463
00:40:47,796 --> 00:40:50,463
66 years later, I understand.

464
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,505
There are moments that change us forever.

465
00:41:01,671 --> 00:41:03,880
There is pain you never forget.

466
00:41:09,338 --> 00:41:11,671
But there is also a way...

467
00:41:13,005 --> 00:41:17,630
that leads out of all this gruesome,
senseless futility.

468
00:41:19,796 --> 00:41:23,005
But if that's correct,
if there is an escape,

469
00:41:23,713 --> 00:41:27,755
why is everything happening again,
why have you changed nothing?

470
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,505
Every development
is built on its predecessor.

471
00:41:50,588 --> 00:41:53,171
First there is the wheel,
then the automobile.

472
00:41:53,588 --> 00:41:56,796
I cannot be me
without having been you first.

473
00:41:58,255 --> 00:42:00,463
You have seen the passage yourself,

474

the thing in the future.

478
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:10,588
But that's not the end of the chain.

479
00:42:17,046 --> 00:42:19,630
Thank you for taking the time.

480
00:42:23,921 --> 00:42:25,671
I'd like you...

481
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:29,380

If it's what I think it is,
