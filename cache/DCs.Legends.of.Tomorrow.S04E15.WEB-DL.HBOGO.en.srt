1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,560
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,120
<i>It's a dragon egg.</i>

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,200
<i>You're possessed.</i>

4
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,960
Ray's gone. I've taken over his body.

5
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,960
If Neron wanted John dead,
he would have killed him on the spot.

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,760
I need you to open up
a doorway to hell.

7
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,120
It's to bring someone here
from the other side.

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,400
- Tabitha.
- I'm sorry. It wasn't me.

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,560
It was my nipple.

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,480
Save me.

11
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,880
As you wish.

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,440
I'm not leaving Mona behind.

13
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,360
Do you really think that everyone
in hell deserves to be there?

14
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,680
This is your opportunity
to make things right.

15
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,280
I'm going to save Ray.

16
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,720
Honey, time to go.

17
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,080
Come on, honey, let's go.
We're going to be late.

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,840
Zari? You better not be
eating the Halva.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,400
No, Mommy.

20
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,320
Zari Jaan.

21
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,480
Dessert's not for after breakfast.

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,960
What?

23
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,440
It's only a kick.

24
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,480
Behrad must be anxious to meet you.

25
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,040
Now go put your shoes on,
so I can take you to school.

26
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,320
<i>You might
just want to soak it all in.</i>

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,040
<i>Violent people
are pouring into our country,</i>

28
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,440
<i>illegal immigrants, terrorists,
meta-humans.</i>

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,560
<i>Politicians promise to keep you safe,
but they've been hiding the truth.</i>

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,880
<i>There's a dangerous new threat
already within our borders.</i>

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,160
<i>Hi, I'm Ray Palmer.</i>

32
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,120
<i>Yes, that Ray Palmer,
former CEO of PalmerTech.</i>

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,600
<i>And I am here to warn you</i>

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,680
<i>that creatures once thought only
in legends and fairy tales are real.</i>

35
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,960
<i>Yes, folks, monsters are real
and they walk amongst us.</i>

36
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,400
<i>And they will stop at nothing
until they destroy humankind.</i>

37
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,240
<i>Interested in learning more?</i>

38
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,200
<i>Then join me at PalmerX 2019,</i>

39
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,440
<i>where the power is in the Palmer
of your hands.</i>

40
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,360
I don't care if Neron's
wearing my best friend's face.

41
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,440
- I want to punch him.
- Get in line.

42
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,080
Ogres are big softies
that one wouldn't even hurt a fly.

43
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,160
Neron's been a step ahead of us
for too long.

44
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,600
We need to play offense.

45
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,880
- Agreed.
- Sorry, what are we agreeing to?

46
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,640
Look, it's time for us to fight back.

47
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,240
We're retaking the Bureau.

48
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,320
Gideon, pull up the blueprints
at the Bureau

49
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,040
and start fabricating an arsenal.

50
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,120
<i>Right away, Captain.</i>

51
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,920
{\an5}<i>Look, Gary has bonded
with the Fairy Godmother</i>

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,480
{\an5}and while he might be an idiot,
she is not to be underestimated.

53
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,480
Mick, Nate,
you think you can handle Tabitha?

54
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,600
Granny's dead.

55
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,640
Good. Ava and I will handle Neron.

56
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,920
Yeah, I want a crack at him.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's my bureau
he's running his operation from.

58
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,200
Not to be a buzzkill,

59
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,320
but even John and Nora
couldn't out-magic Neron.

60
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,440
I just felt a kick.

61
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,640
Oh, I want to feel.

62
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,920
Right now the smart play
would be just to bide our time.

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,600
{\an5}Wait for John-o to return
with Ray's soul.

64
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,880
Shockingly, I agree with Charlie.

65
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,640
- I love you, little Wicksty...
- Oh, I felt it.

66
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,960
{\an5}- I told you, it's kicking.
- Okay, can you guys stop

67
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,040
being dragon baby crazy right now?

68
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,080
{\an5}Look, this commercial is proof
that Neron is up to something big

69
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,920
{\an5}and we need to stop him
before it's too late.

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,200
{\an5}<i>Captain, I have an incoming
communication from Nora Darhk.</i>

71
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,200
- Put her on.
<i>- Sara?</i>

72
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,960
<i>Talk to me. What's your status?</i>

73
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,160
{\an5}I'm tired of skulking around
air ducts.

74
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,600
I'm going after Mona.

75
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,160
We're gearing up for an assault.

76
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,880
- Hold your position.
- Hey.

77
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,080
- Too late.
- Wait, where's Gary?

78
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,000
In Ava's office
getting real comfortable.

79
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,280
Oh, Fairy Godmother?

80
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,640
Yes, my pet?

81
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,560
I want to dig deeper on my next wish.

82
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,720
Excellent idea.

83
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,320
What do you have in mind?

84
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,760
Well...

85
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,920
we've already redecorated my office.

86
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,240
I now have three nipples

87
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,280
because a spare never hurts and...

88
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,080
{\an5}Perhaps you could make a wish
regarding the Legends?

89
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,800
You want me to wish something
for them?

90
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,240
I'm talking about revenge.

91
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,880
They lied to you, Gary.

92
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,840
{\an5}Promised
you could be an interim Legend.

93
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,000
{\an5}One wish and you can send them all
to hell with John Constantine.

94
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,880
Speaking of John,
you think he's all right?

95
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,360
{\an5}That warlock sent thousands
of demons to rot in the pits.

96
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,280
{\an5}I think he's well
and truly screwed, dearie.

97
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,400
Does this mean we're straight?

98
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,320
I got a more important collection
to make.

99
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,560
Who is that guy?

100
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,920
That, my friend,
is John Constantine...

101
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,000
in the flesh.

102
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,800
Congratulations, Mona.

103
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,920
{\an5}I have selected you
for a very special assignment.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,520
That's okay, Ne-Ray.

105
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,080
Can I call you that?

106
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,400
I'm okay here.

107
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,520
{\an5}You see, before Nate's father decided
he wanted to be P.T. Barnum,

108
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,280
{\an5}we were working together,
training monsters to do our bidding.

109
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,720
{\an5}Actually, I worked extensively
with your dear friend Konane...

110
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
I mean...

111
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Your dead friend Konane.

112
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,880
I found Mona.

113
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
Hurry.

114
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,880
Copy that.

115
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,520
This seems like overkill.

116
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,560
{\an5}The Legends never included me
in their pizza parties...

117
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,680
or asked me to play
Dungeons and Dragons.

118
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,880
Make them suffer, Gary.

119
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,680
I can make them do whatever you want.

120
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,840
I just wanted to be part of the team.

121
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,200
{\an5}As soon as Ava opens the portal,
we go in firing.

122
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,320
Time to burn some freaks.

123
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,760
I wish...

124
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,200
Opening a portal in three, two, one.

125
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
No.

126
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,920
Welcome to book club.

127
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,240
Why, you little...

128
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,840
I'd be careful
how you speak to my charge.

129
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,200
Gary, why are you doing this?

130
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,800
Because I would like to discuss...

131
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,560
"The Collector."

132
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,280
Forget the book, Gary.

133
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,720
You helped a demon
take control of the Bureau.

134
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,840
What happened to the Bureau creed?

135
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,360
Oh, I could ask the same about you.

136
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,800
Article 27?

137
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,800
A supervisor
must never show favoritism?

138
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,000
You started a book club
with another employee.

139
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,720
Gary, Mona is being tortured
right now.

140
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,200
Neron said he's trying
to protect humans from monsters.

141
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,000
You saw Mona gnaw off my nip.

142
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,120
She did you a favor.

143
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Okay.

144
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,680
Maybe we should just reschedule
until after we've read the book?

145
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,360
Oh, Fairy Godmother?

146
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,560
Oh, no.

147
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,640
Wait.

148
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,760
Book was terrible.

149
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,480
Oh, my head.

150
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,200
That's the spirit.

151
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,560
<i>Sara, Ava, come in.
Where are you guys?</i>

152
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,160
Hey, Nate. Can't talk right now.

153
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,960
Are you talking to Nate on comms?

154
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,600
Tell him I say hi.

155
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,120
Gary says hi.

156
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,160
And we are at book club.

157
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,920
Move on to plan B.

158
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,280
What's plan B?

159
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,880
I only listen for my name.

160
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,000
I assume it's like plan A,
but, you know, with less people.

161
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,680
Well, without the Captain
and the clone,

162
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,680
the Bureau's a suicide mission.

163
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,800
Mick's right.

164
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,680
We need to sneak into PalmerX,

165
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,000
do some recon,
find out what Neron is up to.

166
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,400
Now that sounds like a plan Z.

167
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Hey, baby.

168
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,800
Hey, you looking
for a good time, handsome?

169
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,360
I'm always looking
for a good time, love,

170
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,720
but, regrettably,
my time here is limited.

171
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,120
Maybe you can help me.

172
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,360
I'm looking for a broker
in the soul trade.

173
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,120
He goes by the name of Masher.

174
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,840
I might know something.

175
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,440
Well, this here is holy water.

176
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,480
Now, you can use this
to burn the skin off any demon tosser

177
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,560
who messes with you.

178
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,160
Masher likes to hang out
at the strip club

179
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,920
after trading is done...

180
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
John.

181
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,480
How do you know my name?

182
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,360
Oh, I know who you are.

183
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,080
Half of demon kind is searching
for John Constantine.

184
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,800
The holy water?

185
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,880
Oh, this?

186
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,880
No, this is just whisky, love.

187
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,760
Sure, our protagonist
was keeping people hostage, but,

188
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,200
that's only because he never
received love as a child.

189
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,680
They don't want you
in their book club, Gary.

190
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,720
Doesn't that make you angry?

191
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,960
Make a wish and they will pay.

192
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
You're right.

193
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,280
They don't want to spend time
with Gary Green,

194
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,120
lowly Time Bureau agent.

195
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,800
But they would love to spend time
with Gary Green...

196
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,680
Captain of the Waverider.

197
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,160
<i>Welcome aboard, Captain Green.</i>

198
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,520
Thanks.

199
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,200
I have no quarrel with you, dear.

200
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,000
You didn't send me to hell

201
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,800
like John Constantine
and the Legends.

202
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,960
Yes.

203
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,200
I was in hell for 327 years.

204
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,960
And what was my crime?

205
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,200
I sprinkled a little magic
over Salem,

206
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,640
trying to help a girl whose mother
was accused of witchcraft.

207
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,080
Okay, well, you're out now.

208
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,440
Why help Neron?

209
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,280
Neron rescued me in hell.

210
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,560
What can I say?

211
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
True love bloomed.

212
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,400
I know what you're thinking,
he's so much older than me.

213
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,240
Sometimes you have to look past age.

214
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,360
You know, in another life,

215
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,800
I think you and I
could have been friends.

216
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,240
- Toodles.
- Wait, what...

217
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Ray?

218
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,080
Without all
of the idiotic tendencies.

219
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,840
Make a move on me and Mona dies.

220
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,720
Ray is good and strong.

221
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
He can fight his way back from hell.

222
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,360
Who do you think
is having a worse time in hell?

223
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,120
Ray, or your father?

224
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,000
Turns out Daddy dearest
isn't so tough.

225
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,160
I hear Damien Darhk

226
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,480
is going stark raving mad
in the pits.

227
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,800
Why am I here?

228
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,360
Well, you and John tried to kill me,
nearly did.

229
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,440
If the doofus in the skin suit
I'm wearing hadn't have interrupted,

230
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,000
I'd have been obliterated.

231
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,680
I spent many nights

232
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,600
just dreaming about how
I was going to get my revenge.

233
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,760
And then it came to me,

234
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,400
what better punishment
than making you sit front row

235
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,600
to all of the fear and rage
I'm about to unleash on the Earth,

236
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,680
all while in the body of the man
you love.

237
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
Now...

238
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,600
smile for the cameras.

239
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,760
Mr. Palmer.

240
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,960
Are monsters real?

241
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,360
What's tonight all about?

242
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,800
Now, all of your questions
will be answered soon.

243
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,560
- Excuse me.
- What's wrong with you?

244
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,440
Well, you know, a room full of people
fearful of magical creatures

245
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,280
just makes me a little bit fearful,
all right?

246
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,520
The worst part is,
Ray loves tech events.

247
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,360
Good evening, D.C.
and welcome to PalmerX 2019.

248
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,160
Now, you're all probably wondering,

249
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,080
what in the heck is Ray Palmer
doing back in the public eye?

250
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,560
Well, folks, for the past two years

251
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,320
I have been hunting
magical creatures.

252
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,360
Hang with me here.

253
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,080
I have created an exosuit
capable of combating

254
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,640
the most ferocious of their kind.

255
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,840
What a douche.

256
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,240
But I can't do it alone.

257
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,760
I need your help.

258
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,080
I need you to help me
find these creatures...

259
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,600
creatures that may be hiding
right here amongst us.

260
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,480
Now, everyone take out
your smartphones.

261
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,600
Better be PalmerTech.

262
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,240
I have created a small, simple app,
that will change the world.

263
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,560
And I want you all to download it
right now.

264
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,480
The app is called Eyes.

265
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,200
Now, on Eyes, you will be able
to share real-time,

266
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,440
life-saving monster sightings.

267
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,040
Share them
and I will be there to save you.

268
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,000
Remember, the power
is in the Palmer of your hands.

269
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You really expect us
to believe monsters exist?

270
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,280
I thought you were going
to offer us proof.

271
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,640
Thank you, Cindy.
You are absolutely right.

272
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,400
Here is your proof.

273
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,480
Now, this may
look like a helpless hipster

274
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,080
who should be working at a bookstore,

275
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,400
but believe me,

276
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,880
she is something altogether
more dangerous.

277
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
Masher.

278
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,920
- John?
- Yeah, yeah, all right,

279
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,680
keep your hair on. No need
to tell the whole bloody club.

280
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,440
Oh, buddy, now I know
you're out of your mind.

281
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,520
What are you doing in hell?

282
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,120
I'm here to save a friend.

283
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,160
His soul belongs to Neron.

284
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,240
Cheers, love. He's paying.

285
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,040
Nobody gets into Neron's soul vault
without his say-so.

286
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,600
Except the Triumvirate

287
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,880
and I have a plan to deal with them,

288
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,120
but first, there's a hunch
I need to confirm.

289
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,440
What's Neron trading at?

290
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,600
He's steady,

291
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,280
but I'll let you in on
a little secret.

292
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,200
His stock is about to rise.

293
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm talking a massive soul collection
on Earth.

294
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,080
You know what that means?

295
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,000
Neron is finally making his play
for the throne of hell.

296
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,480
Oh, cheers, Masher. I can use that.

297
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,680
Be careful, John.

298
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,800
Not every demon you've sent to hell
is as forgiving as I am.

299
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,800
Yeah, don't I know it.

300
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,680
You're dead, demon hunter.

301
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,920
I was going to be
a demon proctologist,

302
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,560
but the pay wasn't as good.

303
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,280
Hold him.

304
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,160
Oh, Calibraxis.

305
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,600
Hey, looking good, mate.

306
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,080
- You grow your beard?
- John Constantine.

307
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,200
I'm really going to enjoy
watching you breathe your last.

308
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,240
I invoke a parlay.

309
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,680
I demand to speak to the Triumvirate.

310
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,600
I'm a demon, not a pirate, John.

311
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,320
I thought you understood the rules.

312
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,600
Well, you little maggot,

313
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,840
as long as I'm alive,

314
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,840
then the Triumvirate
can pass me around

315
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,120
like a little sparrow
amongst the cats.

316
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,440
But as soon as I die,
you dim-witted dick,

317
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,560
then my soul belongs to Neron

318
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,080
and then the Triumvirate lose out

319
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,720
on all the tasty little bits
of torture

320
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,920
that they've got planned for me.

321
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,320
So you've got two choices.

322
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,680
You can either kill me

323
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,400
and royally piss off the old bags
that run this place,

324
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,240
or take me to speak
with the Triumvirate.

325
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,840
<i>I'm detecting
a fugitive alert stop it...</i>

326
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,520
<i>at the Inquisition, Captain Green.</i>

327
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,880
Oh, I don't do torture.

328
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,960
Could've fooled me.

329
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,520
Hey. Play nice.

330
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,640
We have to distract Gary
while the B team is plan B...ing.

331
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,040
<i>Would a fairy at the Great British
Bakeoff suit your fancy?</i>

332
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,360
Shall we...

333
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,160
keep calm and pastry on?

334
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,600
<i>I'll plot a course, Captain.</i>

335
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,560
Get it?

336
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,080
"Keep calm and pastry on"?

337
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,400
Good one, Cap.

338
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,520
- Hilarious.
- Thanks, guys.

339
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,160
Thanks. Yeah.

340
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,560
Take a good, long look at her...

341
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
Mona Wu.

342
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,200
You saw her on the street,
you wouldn't think twice.

343
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,880
Come on, Mona.
Don't give him what he wants.

344
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,040
But she has a strange
and violent condition...

345
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,840
brought about when she fell in love
with a repulsive creature.

346
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,440
I feel like a bridge scene
should have more people.

347
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,960
Oh, no, we love
three people bridge scenes.

348
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,960
Yeah, otherwise we just end up
standing around all day.

349
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,960
Oh, that's why Mick's always grumpy.

350
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,600
Come on, Mona.

351
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,880
I promised these fine people a show.

352
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,600
Let's not keep them waiting.

353
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,160
Shift now or end up dead like Konane.

354
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,680
Folks, proof of the world's
very first werewolf.

355
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,680
That's what we're missing the boys.

356
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,600
- No.
- Yeah.

357
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,840
Fairy Godmother?

358
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,040
- Z.
- B.

359
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,160
She made him disappear.

360
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,600
Well, well, well...

361
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,080
what do we have here?

362
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,240
More magic in the audience?

363
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,600
She's one of them.

364
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,320
He's right. I am.

365
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,480
She's a witch.

366
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,960
Witch. Witch.

367
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,760
Witch, witch, witch.

368
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,000
Witch, witch, witch...

369
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,720
Don't worry, folks.
The witch won't get far.

370
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,680
Not as long as everyone
downloads the Eyes app.

371
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,200
Share your sightings.

372
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,520
We'll find the witch.

373
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,160
It's only a matter of time.

374
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,240
Sara, you guys okay?

375
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,880
Yeah, we're fine, as long
as we keep placating Gary.

376
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,560
I guess Charlie and Z
are our last hope.

377
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,520
Great, we're toast.

378
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Welcome to hell.

379
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,720
Good evening,
this is your captain speaking.

380
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,880
Just...

381
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,320
What?

382
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,560
We'll be cruising at a high altitude

383
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,400
on our way
to save a bakeoff in Britain.

384
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,240
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

385
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,280
Gary, is that the Kid Steel costume?

386
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,000
You like-y?

387
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,440
Why would anyone wish
to be a sidekick?

388
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,440
- Close your legs.
- Oh, he's such an idiot.

389
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,760
What?

390
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,360
Nothing, they're just teasing you.

391
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,240
You're my Gar-bear.

392
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,000
We're going to have so much fun.

393
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
Okay?

394
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,160
#EyesApp is trending on Twitter
below Kanye's surprise album

395
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,240
and a cat getting a bath.

396
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,840
How many downloads?

397
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,920
Only 2,000, Mr. Palmer.

398
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,200
News cycle is so fast these days,

399
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,800
it's hard to cut
through all the noise.

400
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,760
But a monster attack on the capital

401
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,520
will dominate the headlines
for weeks.

402
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,720
And then what?

403
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,160
More people will download some app?

404
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,120
That's your big plan?

405
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,280
Why, yes, it is.

406
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,560
My love.

407
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,760
Would you please escort
our guest to a cell?

408
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,320
Let's go, dearie.

409
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,640
Neron didn't say
which containment cell to put you in.

410
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,640
Why are you helping me?

411
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,800
Because you're a fellow witch

412
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,240
and I think we can help each other.

413
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,120
Mona?

414
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,120
How do you feel?

415
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,920
I've been better.

416
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,880
Remember, I'm just
a "Fairy Godmother" away.

417
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,760
Trust me, we'll be safe here.

418
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,000
Where are we?

419
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,120
My childhood home.

420
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,760
I thought you grew up
in a dystopian city, Z.

421
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,040
You had a pool?

422
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,600
In a couple years, A.R.G.U.S.
will use people's growing fear

423
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,760
of meta-humans to seize control.

424
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,040
Of course, it didn't help
that we're Muslim.

425
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,720
We were forced to move
to a ghetto district in 2021.

426
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,840
Humans are so easy to manipulate.

427
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,800
I mean, you just show them
a scary ogre

428
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,200
or a dangerous meta,
they just go barmy.

429
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,920
Haven't even been able
to get into the Eyes app yet

430
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,600
because the terms of service
are so long.

431
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,120
No one bothers reading those.

432
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,120
It's a demon app.
I'm going to read the fine print.

433
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,680
I can't believe it's just us left.

434
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,160
I mean, you and I
both knew from the start

435
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,160
that it was madness
to storm the Bureau.

436
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,080
Oh, my God.

437
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,160
What?

438
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,600
Z?

439
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,920
In New Orleans,

440
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,200
John said Neron needed
more souls to take over hell.

441
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,040
Here it says in exchange
for the service,

442
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,440
the user agrees to forfeit their
eternal soul to the demon Neron.

443
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,520
What, you're saying that anyone

444
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,520
who downloads the app
is going to hell?

445
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
Yeah.

446
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,360
Oh, that is mental.

447
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,480
This little fairy was causing
quite the fray around the soufflé.

448
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,640
I think I know
just the place for you, Madame.

449
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,840
I can't take it anymore.

450
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm going to kill him.

451
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,000
Hey, Z, Charlie,
please tell me you have something.

452
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,840
Well, we figured out Neron's app
is a way to collect souls.

453
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,280
That's crazy.

454
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,680
Yeah, it gets crazier.

455
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,960
To drum up fear
and increase downloads of his app,

456
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,080
we think he may be planning
a monster attack.

457
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,320
Okay, well, we'll stall Gary,

458
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,160
but you got to get every single one
of those monsters

459
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,600
out of the Time Bureau.

460
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,640
I was afraid
you were going to say that.

461
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,760
Who are you talking to, Sara?

462
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,840
What?

463
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,400
Gary. Baby, bubby, bubelah.

464
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,680
There's a whole big world
of problems.

465
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,640
You know, Neron
and your Fairy Godmother,

466
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,920
they're not really
your friends, but...

467
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,960
Do you know who your friends are?

468
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,240
These guys.

469
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,320
Are you trying to schmooze me?

470
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,520
Feels good, right?

471
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,760
Actually, it feels a little false.

472
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,880
Gary.

473
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,360
You are our friend.

474
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,440
I mean, would we lie
to an interim Legend?

475
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,840
You see, that's just it,
because I'm not an interim Legend.

476
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,240
You just promised me
that to use me as bait.

477
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,640
You know what, Gary?
It's a little hard

478
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,920
to feel sorry for you
when you're holding us all hostage.

479
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,160
You're not getting it.

480
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,880
This whole time, Tabitha has been
trying to use me to hurt you.

481
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,480
All I wished was for us to hang out.

482
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,160
I was trying to protect you.

483
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,800
I get it. I'm not cool.

484
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,800
But I don't deserve to be treated
like a joke.

485
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,400
So, now...

486
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,040
now the joke's on you.

487
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,280
- What's he talking about?
- Oh, Fairy Godmother.

488
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,840
Yes, my pet?

489
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,240
Mick thinks he's a tough guy,

490
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,040
but I think he's a big baby.

491
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,560
And Nate, who's never been
bullied a day in his life,

492
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,160
welcome to my high-school years.

493
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,640
And Sara and Ava,

494
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,360
the cool girl
and the class president,

495
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,080
you know what I want you to do
for me?

496
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,120
Dance.

497
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,480
Five, six, seven, eight.

498
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,280
Faster.

499
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,240
Gary, stop it!

500
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,200
Faster.

501
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,960
Charlie, I get that you're scared,

502
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,080
- but the team is counting on us.
- I'm not scared.

503
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,440
It's just, breaking the monsters
out of the prison

504
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,960
is a multiple-person job.

505
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,560
You can be multiple people.

506
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,840
Look, Z, yeah, I can, for a second
and you know what?

507
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,960
It takes its toll.

508
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,040
Now, I could end up back in prison
or even worse, dead.

509
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,800
When A.R.G.U.S. came for my family,

510
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,760
my brother, Behrad, told me to run.

511
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,280
And I did.

512
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,320
I've never forgiven myself.

513
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,080
You won't either.

514
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,000
We can't change my family's future,

515
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,000
but we can save their present.

516
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,400
Zari Jaan, make sure you take
your shoes off before you go in.

517
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,080
- I know.
- Charlie?

518
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,960
If I die, I'm going to come back
and haunt you.

519
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,520
I would love a ghost friend.

520
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,560
Come on.

521
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,120
Cool.

522
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,280
Greetings, Satan,
first of the fallen.

523
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,280
It's been a long time, John.

524
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,880
- Belial.
- We've been looking forward

525
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,000
to hearing the bunk you're peddling.

526
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,240
And Beelzebub.

527
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,240
Not as popular, but you
were always my personal favorite.

528
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,480
This is a waste of our time.

529
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,360
I take it you've noticed
a certain demon's

530
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,280
stock has been on the rise.

531
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,240
Neron's been doing very well
for himself.

532
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,680
Neron is trying to take control
of hell.

533
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,240
And let me assure you,

534
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,400
his method for collecting souls,

535
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,480
it won't be to sign
on the dotted line in blood.

536
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,120
He's young,

537
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,840
by your standards at least.

538
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,840
And let's just say,
he means to disrupt the system.

539
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,560
If we interfere with Neron,
we'll look weak.

540
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,680
Well, that's precisely
where I come in, Bubby.

541
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,520
And what do you want in exchange?

542
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,760
Not your own soul, I hope.

543
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,120
I'm here for the soul
of Raymond Palmer.

544
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,560
You let us two leave hell

545
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,800
and I pledge to you that I will
dedicate all of my crafty,

546
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,920
wicked ways to thwarting Neron
and securing your reign.

547
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,200
Are you really here
for Raymond Palmer?

548
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,600
We thought there was another...

549
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,440
A young girl
whose life you destroyed.

550
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,720
Astra.

551
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,040
Yeah, well, you know,
I didn't want to be too greedy.

552
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,960
But, yeah, I'll take them both.

553
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,240
Both of them?

554
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,320
That is greedy.

555
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,960
But if you were to choose,

556
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,680
well, then that's a different matter.

557
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,720
John, help me.

558
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,800
John, you're here.

559
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,640
You got to get me back to Earth.

560
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,240
Please, John. They're hurting me.

561
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,480
Make up your mind, John.

562
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,160
This offer won't last.

563
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,600
John?

564
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,200
- Astra?
- It's following me.

565
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,680
Make it go away.

566
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,280
Come here, I've got you.

567
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,400
You can't have her.

568
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,960
You can't save her.

569
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,960
You can't have her.
You can't have her.

570
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,840
John, get me out of here.

571
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,320
I'm sorry.

572
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,760
I choose...

573
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,120
Astra Logue.

574
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,440
Stick to the plan, Charlie.

575
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,840
You mean the plan where I need
to rely on my shoddy shape-shifting

576
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,840
to portal creatures one by one
out of their cells

577
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,000
and on to the Waverider,

578
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,080
where Gary may or may not
wish them to Kingdom Come?

579
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,880
Yup, that plan.

580
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,200
This isn't you, Gary.

581
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,480
Why are you being so cruel?

582
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,040
Please.

583
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,880
Stop. You're killing them.

584
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,800
I don't do mime, dearie.

585
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,880
Just stop.

586
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
Everything.

587
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,040
As you wish...

588
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,200
Mona? Hey, wake up.

589
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,440
Hey, Nora.

590
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,600
Hey.

591
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,360
Oh, you're still here.

592
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,480
I'm book club forever.

593
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,520
Book club forever.

594
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,360
Oh, Fairy Godmother.

595
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,080
I have to pop off for a second, Gary.

596
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,600
I thought we were going to play
Settlers of Catan later.

597
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,040
Don't be silly.

598
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,000
We're not friends.

599
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,440
I am so sorry, Gary.
I took you for granted.

600
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,800
I never, ever should have
let you do my dry cleaning

601
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,680
or work overtime without pay.

602
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,960
I mean, that's illegal anyway.

603
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,160
I'm so sorry.

604
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,760
I still want to kill you.

605
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,160
Gary, when Rip first
recruited the Legends,

606
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,400
he picked the people
that were insignificant to history,

607
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,880
the original losers.

608
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,880
You don't have to be cool
to be a Legend.

609
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,000
And maybe we forgot that
somewhere along the way, but...

610
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,680
you are one of us.

611
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,080
Now, come on, Gary.

612
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,760
Ray and Constantine
are both stuck in hell

613
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,920
and you can help them.

614
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,360
Just use your Fairy Godmother
powers for good.

615
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,760
Save her.

616
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,720
Sadly, my hands are tied.

617
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,880
But if you become
Mona's Fairy Godmother,

618
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,320
she could wish to be healed.

619
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,280
How do I do that?

620
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,280
If another witch takes the wand...

621
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,960
You'll take my curse...

622
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,200
but with it, all of my power.

623
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,360
Nora.

624
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,080
Nora, no.

625
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,440
No.

626
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,320
Oh, it worked.

627
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,560
Quick, Mona. Make a wish.

628
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,520
Fairy God-Nora,

629
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,160
I wish to be safe on the Waverider.

630
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,520
Oh, how I've missed me.

631
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,200
Sadly for you,

632
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,720
when you took on the wand's power
and responsibility,

633
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,560
you also took on its charge.

634
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,440
- Gary?
- I'm afraid so.

635
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,360
Fairy Godmothers are prisoners.

636
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,920
Their magic is dependent
on whiny humans

637
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,800
and their petty demands.

638
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,400
You lied.

639
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,600
Obviously.

640
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,960
Toodles.

641
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,760
Excuse me.

642
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,960
- Marilyn Monroe?
- Why, yes.

643
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,720
I seem to have gotten a little lost.

644
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,840
Can you help me get back home?

645
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,560
Of course, ma'am.

646
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,480
Let me just program in a year.

647
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,360
Yeah.

648
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,000
- Thank you, sir.
- Oh, my love.

649
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,080
My love.

650
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,240
Still no luck with Nora?

651
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,800
No.

652
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,920
Well, she'll take your curse soon.

653
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,280
After all, you are very convincing.

654
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,360
Well, I better head back.

655
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,120
Evil deeds to do and all that.

656
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,520
No.

657
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,360
Well, that was bloody close.

658
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,200
<i>I'm at the first cell.</i>

659
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,560
<i>Anytime now, Z.</i>

660
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,720
Okay, just give me one second.

661
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,960
The public doesn't always know
what's best for them.

662
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,680
So tonight we will release
the Minotaur

663
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,840
and scare them
into accepting our protection.

664
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,760
It is done, mon amour.

665
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,160
How do I look?

666
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,480
But you were just...

667
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,800
Oh, the shape-shifter.

668
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,840
Can someone sound the alarm?

669
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,600
Charlie, Tabitha
and Neron are onto you.

670
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,120
Yeah, I figured.

671
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,760
You need to get out now.

672
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,120
Open all the doors,
turn off the force fields.

673
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,640
I'm not leaving.

674
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,800
Are you waiting for an invitation?

675
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,200
It's a bloody jailbreak.

676
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,360
I mean, there are pros to trusting
your apologies are sincere and cons.

677
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,200
Maybe I'll make a list.

678
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,200
Gary...Gary, just go with your heart.

679
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,600
Oh, Fairy Godmother.

680
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,640
Nora.

681
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,240
Go find John and help him
rescue Ray from hell.

682
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,600
Oh, fiddlesticks.

683
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,680
Wait, wait.

684
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,800
- Gary.
- Gary, you dick.

685
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,680
Come on, you lot. Get a move on.

686
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,360
You don't have to tell me twice.

687
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,120
Faster, sassy.

688
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,280
You're all right, little one.

689
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,280
Oi, ogre. Catch.

690
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,680
Charlie, you're out of time.

691
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,560
Z, get out of here.

692
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,200
See you on the other side.

693
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,640
I'm going after Mona.

694
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,480
Mona.

695
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,040
Come on, love.
Let's get you out of here.

696
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,560
I hate shape-shifters.
Break her neck.

697
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,640
Patience, mon amour.

698
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,000
Get Mona.

699
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,720
No.

700
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,840
Looks like things ain't going
so well for you, Neron.

701
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,560
You wanted a monster to attack D.C.

702
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,960
Now we have every single monster...

703
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,720
in one.

704
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,520
You promised me
you'd take me to see Astra.

705
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,200
Patience, John.

706
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,760
I made a pledge to you

707
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,560
and I expect you to keep
your end of the bargain.

708
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,720
What the hell are you playing at?

709
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,800
<i>John?</i>

710
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,520
<i>John, is it really you?</i>

711
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,800
Yes.

712
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,360
Yes, Astra, love. It's me.
It's me. This is Johnny.

713
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,000
Thank God.

714
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,920
God?

715
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,920
You know better than to thank him.

716
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,120
Astra?

717
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,280
John is here to take you back
to Earth.

718
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,120
You're welcome to go.

719
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,920
Yeah.

720
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,760
It's all right, love. It's me.

721
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,640
No.

722
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
Wait.

723
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,200
Hold on. What...

724
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,560
What do you mean no?

725
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,520
Looks like the deal is null and void.

726
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,960
Neron is a thorn in our side, John,

727
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,120
but torturing you...

728
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,560
is too much fun.

729
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
<i>John?</i>

730
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,640
<i>It's following me.</i>

731
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,800
<i>Make it go away.</i>

732
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,160
<i>Please.</i>

733
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,080
<i>John, get me out of here.</i>

734
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,960
Astra, love.

735
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,760
- This isn't you.
- Oh, of course it is.

736
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,880
Or would you rather I stayed
that terrified little girl,

737
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,320
crying and waiting for you to come
and rescue me?

738
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,000
I would have been waiting
a long time.

739
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,800
I am so, so sorry, love,
but...

740
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,520
this place, it's twisted you.

741
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,240
If anything...

742
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,760
it's made me more like you.

743
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,480
Right, John?

744
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,160
You're not like me.

745
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,360
You're not.

746
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,560
You chose wrong.

747
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,400
You should have saved your friend.

748
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,520
Hey, watch it.

749
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,920
Back off, freak.

750
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,880
It's like a demented Noah's Ark.

751
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,320
What about Charlie?

752
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,360
It's my fault. I'm the one that
convinced her to risk everything.

753
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,200
Hey, don't go down that road.

754
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,560
We'll do what we always do.

755
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,960
Yeah, forming stupid Beebos.

756
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,160
Hey, where are you going?

757
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,960
Well, after everything,

758
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,440
I just figured you wouldn't want
to have me around anymore.

759
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,200
It's all hands on deck, Gary.

760
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,560
Yeah.

761
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,880
We're going to need
all our friends to defeat Neron.

762
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,080
You all right?

763
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,320
Not really.

764
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,760
I'm glad you and Wicksty are okay.

765
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,440
What happened?

766
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,960
Oh, my God.

767
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,880
Hi.

768
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,000
My name is Zari.
