To the contrary.

641
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,244
Heard you telling that girl stories.

642
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,803
A lie with a heart of truth
is a powerful thing.

643
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,968
Go on. It's late.

644
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,203
[PHONE RINGING]

645
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,730
Hey, it's me. I'm coming home soon.

646
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,289
Everything's gonna be better.
I promise. I love you.

647
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,401
Hey, Gordon. You got a minute?

648
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,443
Can it wait? I'm on my way out of here.

649
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,530
Some uni's brought in a perp.
Claims to know you.

650
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,202
- Oh, yeah? What's the charge?
- B & E. Some fancy store uptown.

651
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,051
Pretty professional job.
Kid didn't even trip the alarm.

652
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,451
Kid? A boy or a girl?

653
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,962
Girl. Said to ask
if you'd been down any sewers lately.

654
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,323
Hey, detective.

655
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,320
Miss me?

656
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,523
I enjoyed it.

657
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,768
I enjoyed hurting him.

658
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,928
Of course you did.

659
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,324
He deserved it.

660
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,727
I'm so angry all the time.

661
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,325
Will it ever go away?

662
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,400
That I don't know.

663
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,324
Alfred...

664
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,167
...can you teach me how to fight?

665
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,649
Yes...

666
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,804
...Master Bruce.

667
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,246
Yes, I can.
