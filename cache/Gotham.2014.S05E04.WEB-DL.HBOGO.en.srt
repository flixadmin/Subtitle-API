1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,160
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,560
Shut up and die!

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,800
Say hello to Butch.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,600
No!

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,360
She's paralyzed and has lost
the will to live.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,720
If Selina ingests this,
it'll find its way to her wound.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,600
I'm better. So, now I have to find
the freak who shot me.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,120
Welcome to the Church of Jeremiah.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,200
Selina!

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,520
This time, woke up on a rooftop,

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,080
no idea how I got there or what
happened during the preceding hours.

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,560
- Who the hell are you?
- You don't remember?

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,920
What is happening to me?

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,280
Gonna need people I can trust
watching over this place.

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,440
You could be my deputy

16
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,920
- here in Haven.
- Thanks.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,560
Well, if it isn't my old friend,
Mr. Penn.

18
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,120
You shouldn't have come here, Oswald.

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,080
Perhaps you shouldn't
have stolen my people.

20
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,320
- Hi, Pengy.
- Jim!

21
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,400
Barbara, no.

22
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
Over here!

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,240
Over here! Over here!

24
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,600
This woman needs medical attention.

25
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,680
Find a doctor. Go. Hey, hey!

26
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,640
You! Hey, listen up.

27
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,000
Pair up. I need teams going in
looking for survivors.

28
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,240
Go. Get those people back!

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,520
Hey, you.

30
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,440
Set up a triage over here.

31
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,760
Hey. Hey, come on. Snap to.

32
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,680
Focus.
There's gonna be a lot of wounded.

33
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,000
Look at me. Look at me.

34
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,920
All right. Find all the
medical supplies you can. Go.

35
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,200
You did this.
You brought the gangs here!

36
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,200
No! I would never allow that.

37
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,360
None of them had explosives,
that I know of.

38
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,440
Jim!

39
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,800
We need to get these fires out,
Harvey.

40
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,160
We got nothing to put hoses on.

41
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,680
Use the drinking water. Do it.

42
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,880
Hey. Hey!

43
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,800
Get those hoses over here now!

44
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,080
Jim.

45
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,120
Harvey, flames are dying.

46
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,200
We can get more teams inside.

47
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,680
- There have to be survivors.
- I know.

48
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,680
It's just, an officer
just found this.

49
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,320
It's yours.

50
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,080
As of now, the death toll stands
at 311.

51
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
49 injured.

52
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,040
{\an5}More than two dozen unaccounted for.

53
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,880
{\an5}<i>I'm so terribly sorry, Captain.</i>

54
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,600
{\an5}<i>Do you have any idea
who's responsible?</i>

55
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,680
{\an5}There was an incursion
by several of the gangs.

56
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,000
{\an5}Any one of them could've done it.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,720
{\an5}Right now, it's impossible
to rule anyone out.

58
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,520
{\an5}<i>I'm working on getting you help.</i>

59
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,280
{\an5}You've been promising me help
for weeks.

60
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,920
{\an5}I have bodies lined up
in the streets.

61
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,320
{\an5}<i>You have every right to be upset,
Captain.</i>

62
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,080
{\an5}<i>- But I'm doing everything I can...</i>
- Yeah.

63
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,480
{\an5}<i>to make sure that you and your...</i>

64
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
{\an5}Let them through.

65
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,960
{\an5}- There he is!
- Let them through!

66
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,000
{\an5}Let them through. It's okay.
It's all right.

67
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,480
{\an5}When are you gonna find out
who did this?

68
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,000
My family was in there.

69
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,640
{\an5}- How do we know we're safe here?
- I know...

70
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,520
{\an5}I know each one of you
lost someone you care for.

71
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
{\an5}I share your grief.

72
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,960
{\an5}I share your anger.

73
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,600
{\an5}But whoever destroyed that building
can't destroy the hope we've built.

74
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,000
{\an5}Not unless we let them.

75
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
{\an5}I swear...

76
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,400
{\an5}I promise I won't stop
until I find those responsible.

77
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,440
{\an5}Justice will be done.

78
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,760
{\an5}How are you gonna stop it
from happening again?

79
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
It was a nice try.

80
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,280
Can you blame them? They're angry.

81
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,840
It's gonna take more than words.

82
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,320
Someone has to pay for this, soon.

83
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,120
Well, the department's not exactly
firing on all cylinders.

84
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,600
We got more men than bullets,
and we ain't got that many men.

85
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,440
Lucius, I need something.

86
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,360
Comb through every piece
of evidence you can find.

87
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,920
I need to know who did this, and how.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,680
It's not gonna be easy.
The size of the crime scene alone...

89
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,680
Do whatever you have to do.
The clock is ticking.

90
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
More than you know.

91
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,800
When Barbara and I showed up,
that's when the building blew.

92
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,720
She vanished right after.

93
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,960
This doesn't make sense.
Not even for her.

94
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,320
Nothing makes sense anymore.

95
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,520
You're in charge, Harvey.

96
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,440
Selina!

97
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,640
Hey.

98
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,680
I was afraid you didn't get
my signal.

99
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,280
Lucius said the range
was only a couple miles.

100
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,120
Oh, you know me, Master Bruce,
I managed to muddle through.

101
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,320
So go on, then.

102
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
How did that happen?

103
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,240
I let my guard down.

104
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,720
You're telling me
that your captors shackle you,

105
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,360
they leave a radio transponder
in your pocket

106
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,800
and, all your weapons?

107
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,880
Really?

108
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,120
I think you're telling porkies.

109
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
It was Selina.

110
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,560
She's gone after Jeremiah, alone.

111
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
You want to follow her, do you?

112
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,080
She's not herself, Alfred.
She's desperate for revenge.

113
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,080
She's gonna get herself hurt
or killed.

114
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,160
Seems to be a little bit
of a recurring theme

115
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,280
with madam, isn't it?

116
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,080
You know, one of these days
you're gonna realize

117
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,720
you can't save her from herself.

118
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,160
Until that day comes...

119
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,720
I think we should go and find her,
don't you?

120
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
Let him in.

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,600
You're either here for information...

122
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,400
or you somehow think
I might've had something to do

123
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,640
with that atrocity.

124
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,000
Penguin murdered Tabitha.

125
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
You knew he was at Haven.

126
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,800
You would've done anything
for revenge.

127
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,400
And I could've killed him
then and there.

128
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
So, why didn't you?

129
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,280
Because the person who blew up
Haven has to be stopped.

130
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,800
That's all that matters now.

131
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,360
You're worried Sirens could be next.

132
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,520
I've been putting out feelers.

133
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
Is that what that was?

134
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,920
He heard people talking
about a shady guy

135
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,560
lurking around Haven before it blew.

136
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,840
This is Gotham. You're gonna have
to do better than "shady guy."

137
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,480
How about a location?

138
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,000
A building in the northeast
corner of Harlow Park.

139
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,320
He says the guy's holed up there.

140
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,800
How much is this gonna cost me?

141
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,400
Just do your job.

142
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,720
Get the bastard.

143
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,840
Did you really think I could've
murdered all those people?

144
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,840
I don't know.

145
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
I guess I deserve that.

146
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,680
<i>Jim.</i>

147
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
<i>Jim.</i>

148
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,560
<i>- Jim, you read me?</i>
- Yeah.

149
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
<i>We got a problem.</i>

150
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,840
On my way.

151
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,920
Oswald?

152
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
What are you doing here?

153
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,600
Jim, it has become woefully apparent

154
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,720
that you are outmanned,
outgunned and out of options.

155
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
So, I'm here to help.

156
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,120
That's generous of you.

157
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,400
I'm just getting started.

158
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,320
Well...

159
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,800
Ain't you just Saint Nick
on a Christmas morning?

160
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,720
Don't be shy.
Go. Take all you can carry.

161
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,680
I'm guessing there are strings
attached?

162
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,000
No strings.

163
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,160
Save for the one that we will cinch
around the neck of the Haven bomber.

164
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,000
I lost people, too, Jim.

165
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,800
People you lured with promises
of safety and security,

166
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,480
only to have them incinerated.

167
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,160
But let's just hold that
in abeyance for the moment.

168
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,920
I would rather we put aside
our considerable differences,

169
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,560
and go get the people some justice.

170
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,480
What do you say, partner?

171
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
Apparently...

172
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,480
I've been on a trip,
or I'm going on one.

173
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,600
I've also left myself a message.

174
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,960
<i>"In A-T number 1215 knows."</i>

175
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,480
Innate?

176
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,000
Ingrate? Inflate?

177
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,840
Inmate?

178
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,360
<i>"Inmate number 1215 knows."</i>

179
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,840
Inmate number 1215 knows!

180
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
Knows what?

181
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,920
Okay.

182
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,240
Okay, think.

183
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,120
Prison records.
Where do I get prison records?

184
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,040
Right.

185
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,400
To hell with Penguin.
Haven wasn't your fault.

186
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,840
I told the people it was safe.

187
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,120
- I made them into a target.
- Jim, you gave 'em...

188
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,800
Don't tell me I gave 'em hope.
They're dead.

189
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,920
All right, fan out.

190
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,920
We go building to building,
door to door.

191
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,880
Our source said this is
where we'll find the bomber.

192
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,920
He's here somewhere.

193
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,360
Alvarez, take a squad,
grab the north side of the street.

194
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,200
The rest of you, cover the south.

195
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,120
To the vile miscreant

196
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,520
who murdered those innocent
Havenites,

197
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,240
you have nowhere to run!

198
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,760
There goes the element of surprise.

199
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,760
We will root you out
like the vermin you are!

200
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,920
Two forces united in one purpose!

201
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,720
- Get back! Get back!
- Get down!

202
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,360
Elevated position, back to the sun.

203
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,200
Looks like we found our guy, huh?

204
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
- We're sitting ducks out here.
- And one Penguin.

205
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,520
Hey, Oswald,
why don't you crawl out there,

206
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,560
grab that bullhorn
and tell him to come down quietly?

207
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,160
Put your weapons down!
We have the building surrounded.

208
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,680
And we have more ammo than you!

209
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,680
Come out now with your hands
in the air.

210
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
Pretty cozy up here.

211
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
Thanks, guys.

212
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
I know that voice.

213
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Zsasz?

214
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,240
Oh, hey, guys. What's up?

215
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,200
It's impolite to sneak up on people.

216
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,440
So is breaking and entering.

217
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,400
Heard you were dead, Ed.

218
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,720
Now what are you looking for?

219
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,720
I am given, and I am taken.

220
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,240
I was there from your first breath,

221
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,120
and I will follow you
until your death.

222
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,880
A name.

223
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
So...

224
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,400
you're looking for the name
of a prisoner at Blackgate.

225
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
Call it a personal matter.

226
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,760
- This folder's quite valuable.
- Right.

227
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,600
What is the going rate
on dust bunnies?

228
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,280
What I mean to say is, this folder
seems to be quite valuable to you.

229
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,760
Well...

230
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,400
I'm guessing you don't want money,
because, it's worthless.

231
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,680
I don't tend to carry snacks on me.

232
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,320
And if I had any bullets, I would
just shoot you and take the folder.

233
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,760
So what is it that you would like?

234
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,760
Your expertise.

235
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,800
Surely you've noticed
the giant plume of smoke in the sky?

236
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,840
Someone blew up a building
we were using to house refugees.

237
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,000
We need to figure out
how they did it,

238
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,920
so we can prevent them
from doing it again.

239
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,840
So, the second smartest man
in Gotham, needs my help.

240
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,320
Explosives are not my expertise.

241
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Didn't realize you had one.

242
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,760
Just...

243
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
Why?

244
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,760
Do we have a deal or not?

245
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
Fine.

246
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,840
I did not make
that building go boom, Jim.

247
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,920
Oh, please!

248
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,480
You gave up any shred
of honor long ago!

249
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,560
Why should we believe a snake
like you?

250
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,480
Because I would never take credit
for somebody else's work.

251
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,440
Oh, no, you'd just betray anyone
and everyone for the right price!

252
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,960
Is this about Sofia Falcone?

253
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,280
Because you should
really move past that.

254
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,360
It's not healthy.

255
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,040
Oswald, concentrate.

256
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,280
Do you and your men have enough ammo
to keep Zsasz pinned down

257
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,360
for a couple of minutes?

258
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,960
For you, Jim, let's say,
two and a half.

259
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,680
Concentrate all your fire
on that window up there.

260
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,440
Give me everything you got,
then abruptly cease fire.

261
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,240
You can count on me. Spread the word.

262
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,120
All right, guys, gather around,
we got new orders.

263
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,440
All right.

264
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,040
- Ready?
- Yeah.

265
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,560
Now!

266
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,520
Fire!

267
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,280
Keep it coming!

268
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,960
Cease fire!

269
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,440
Cease fire!

270
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,520
Cease fire!

271
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,480
Glad to see you're still with us.

272
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,320
Thank you. Thank you. You were great.

273
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,640
Glad there's no hard feelings.

274
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,120
Day's not over yet. Come on.

275
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,480
Well done, Jim.

276
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,440
We make a hell of a team.

277
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,160
That man is a menace.
Allow me to deal with him.

278
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,240
This is about more than
just your vendetta against Zsasz.

279
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,960
If he did this, I need to know
if it was a part of something larger.

280
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,200
My point exactly.

281
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,960
One of the areas in which I excel
is the loosening of tongues.

282
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,280
No. He's mine.

283
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,160
You're pushing my men way too hard.

284
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,680
We're not gonna break through
for at least a couple more days.

285
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,360
There is absolutely
no way to make it on schedule.

286
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,520
Well, not with that attitude,
you're not.

287
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,640
Now, everyone...

288
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,440
let's reach inside and dig
a little deeper, shall we?

289
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,200
'Cause that's the only way you're all
making it out of this hole.

290
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,080
Come on, put this on.

291
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,720
Now work.

292
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,000
Come on, yes, come on.

293
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,200
Are these all the recruits?

294
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,240
Well, I thought you would want
quality over quantity.

295
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,440
Not everybody can pass
a .38 caliber test of faith.

296
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,160
Yes.

297
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,280
You certainly have set
a very high bar for devotion.

298
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,840
Almost forgot.

299
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,240
Bruce Wayne
and his sidekick, Curls...

300
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,800
Or is he the sidekick?

301
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,320
Anyway, they tried to infiltrate
our little operation here.

302
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,600
- Oh?
- Oh.

303
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,960
And Curls can walk, really well,
especially for a paraplegic.

304
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,840
And she wants to kill you.

305
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,200
A lot, FYI.

306
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,400
If I see her, I'll give you a shout.

307
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,040
And kill her.

308
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,120
Okay, recruits,

309
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,600
let's do like my daddy did before
my sixth birthday and move out.

310
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,440
Ed?

311
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,200
The building's superstructure
is largely intact,

312
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,920
which would rule out C-4 and Symtex.

313
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,560
Evidence of deflagration
would suggest something

314
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,400
with a slower burn rate,
like gunpowder or nitroglycerin.

315
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,280
But for this level of destruction,
that would require a bomb that's...

316
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,240
Twenty cubic feet
of explosive material.

317
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,360
There's no way you could
sneak something

318
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,560
that size into the building.
All the entrances were guarded.

319
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,000
Which suggests maybe
that this was an inside job.

320
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,440
Or...

321
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,480
a classic locked-room mystery.

322
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,240
Man walks into a room, alone,
and is later found murdered.

323
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:28,040
There are no windows, and one door,
which is locked from the inside.

324
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,560
The killer was already inside
the room.

325
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,000
So, the bomb was already
inside the building?

326
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,960
No.

327
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,160
The bomb was the building.

328
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,760
You don't need to smuggle
in explosives

329
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,160
when you can detonate 250 gallons
of highly pressurized heating oil

330
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,560
that's coursing through
all the floors.

331
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,880
True, but that doesn't explain this.

332
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,640
- Glass?
- Presumably from there.

333
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,080
No, there's no way that that
would blast in with that explosion.

334
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,400
That would make all of that glass
go out onto the street.

335
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,680
Unless whatever ignited
those heating oil tanks...

336
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,120
Smashed through that window.

337
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,240
This is a really nice table.

338
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,880
We got a dozen witnesses that saw you

339
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,080
walk out of that building
before it went kabooey.

340
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,920
Yeah. I heard some gangs
had taken over.

341
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,240
Figured, with you guys occupied,

342
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,320
I might help myself
to some of your supplies.

343
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,600
Hey, do you guys have
any canned peaches?

344
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,160
Man, I'd trade an arm
and a leg for that right now.

345
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,720
Not mine, somebody else's.

346
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,040
If you're innocent, why shoot up
a city block full of cops?

347
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,960
Because it was full of cops,

348
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,440
who were also trying to shoot me.

349
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,320
And, guys, those were warning shots.

350
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,160
I mean, if I really wanted
to kill you...

351
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,280
you'd be dead.

352
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,360
You got a pen?

353
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,040
I want to write this guy
a thank you letter.

354
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,320
Do the math.

355
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,880
If I blew up a building
full of people,

356
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,360
I would have covered
every inch of my body

357
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,920
in sweet, sweet scars.

358
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,960
You guys want to do a strip search?

359
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,840
Got Lucius on the horn for you, Cap.

360
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,880
Stay on him.

361
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,880
I'd let Alvarez do it.

362
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
He's handsome.

363
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,880
Lucius, talk to me.

364
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,240
<i>Haven wasn't destroyed by a bomb.</i>

365
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,400
<i>It was an RPG, like the one
that took down the chopper.</i>

366
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,320
You sure?

367
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,200
I'm holding what's left
of it in my hand right now.

368
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,120
We found pieces of it in the rubble.

369
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,640
<i>It was fired through
the basement window,</i>

370
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,520
<i>detonated the fuel oil tank.</i>

371
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,640
And we're still trying to figure out

372
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,800
exactly which rooftop
it was fired from.

373
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,560
- Rooftop?
- Yes.

374
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,800
The only angle you could hit
this tank from is above.

375
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,480
Our only suspect was on the ground.

376
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,800
Zsasz was seen leaving the building
moments before it blew.

377
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,560
Looks like you need a new suspect.

378
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,400
Jim!

379
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,000
I know the wheels of justice
turn slowly, so I'm here to provide

380
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,320
a modicum of grease.

381
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,960
Oswald, you need to leave right now.

382
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,320
Still claiming he's innocent, is he?

383
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,880
Yes. And as much as I hate
to admit it,

384
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,600
the evidence is backing him up.

385
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,680
What the hell's going on?

386
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,880
Harvey, according to Lucius,
Zsasz couldn't have done it.

387
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,520
I did not expect you to go soft, Jim.

388
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,800
Actually, I did.
Which is why I didn't come alone.

389
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,480
Bring me Victor Zsasz.

390
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,560
Torturing...

391
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,520
Torturing Zsasz into confessing
won't give the people justice.

392
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,480
As misguided as he is,

393
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,320
my old friend, Jim, is correct
in this instance.

394
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,800
Despite our enflamed passions,
we cannot rush to judgment.

395
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,320
- There will be a trial.
- Yeah!

396
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,880
And we will let the people decide.

397
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,440
Yeah!

398
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,040
Good to know who's really
in charge here, Jim.

399
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,760
This is it, the exact place
where the RPG was fired.

400
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,520
Impressive.

401
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,880
Calculated the angle of incident

402
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,640
followed the trajectory
through the window,

403
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,840
into the fuel oil tanks.

404
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,560
Yep.

405
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,480
That, and the RPG case
is right over there.

406
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,120
So, now we know how it was done;

407
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,440
hopefully this holds some clues
as to who.

408
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,080
I should get this back to the lab.

409
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,240
Doubtful that someone
who could pull off

410
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,320
such an intricate plot
would forget to wear gloves.

411
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,480
True, but it's all I've got to go on.

412
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,280
Well...

413
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,080
maybe I'm wrong.

414
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,680
I hope so.

415
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,160
I truly hope that
you find whoever did this...

416
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,840
and you make them pay.

417
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,560
As promised.

418
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,440
I appreciate your help, Ed.

419
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,280
Couldn't have done it without you.

420
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,440
And if you tell anyone
I said that, I will deny it.

421
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,160
"Inmate number 1215. Frank McCann."

422
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,480
Frank McCann.

423
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,520
Deceased? No!

424
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
No!

425
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,120
No, you can't be dead!

426
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,040
No!

427
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,240
Lucius! Hey!

428
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,840
Did you see
who blew up this building?

429
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,040
Hey!

430
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,120
Deaf old bat.

431
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,320
Hopefully she's not blind, too.

432
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,880
There he is.

433
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,760
I got no love for Zsasz,

434
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,560
but are we really gonna let this
happen?

435
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,320
Look at them, Harvey.

436
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,160
If we try to stop it,

437
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,640
they'll turn that anger against us.

438
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,040
- We've got to do something.
- Yeah?

439
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Like what?

440
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,640
I make another speech?

441
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,840
Maybe this is what the people need.

442
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,240
Order in the court!

443
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,120
So, will I be appointed a lawyer?

444
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,360
I feel like my rights
are being violated.

445
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,200
Not your right
to remain silent. Bailiff.

446
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,240
No, no, no, no, no...

447
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,120
And where exactly
did you see the defendant

448
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,200
minutes before the explosion?

449
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,360
Coming out of the building.

450
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,800
The very building that
mere moments later

451
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,840
was engulfed in flames
that would claim

452
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,000
so many beloved souls?

453
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,080
Are there any other witnesses
who can back up this man's claim?

454
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,320
- Here.
- Yep. Here.

455
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,840
Captain Gordon
would have this court believe

456
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,840
that all of you fine citizens
are mistaken.

457
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,880
He claims that Mr. Zsasz
is not responsible for the bombing.

458
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,560
Captain Gordon, if you would like
to say something, now is the time.

459
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
It wasn't a bomb.

460
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,680
It wasn't a bomb.

461
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,600
A rocket-propelled grenade,
fired from a rooftop.

462
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,800
If Zsasz was on the ground,
as your witnesses claim...

463
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,480
he couldn't have done it.

464
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,040
I know you all want justice.

465
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
So do I.

466
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,800
You're angry.

467
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,920
You're scared.

468
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,560
For months now, you've been
hearing me say help is coming.

469
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,040
Truth is, we may be on our own.

470
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,880
And if that's true...

471
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,440
what we do now
is more important than ever.

472
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
This...

473
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,080
This is not justice.

474
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,360
This is not justice.

475
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,160
It's not who we are.

476
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,040
I'll consider that
your closing argument.

477
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,640
Now that the defense has rested,

478
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,840
let's put it to the crowd.

479
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,680
What do you say, jury?

480
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,480
Guilty!

481
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,440
Guilty!

482
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,040
By the power vested in me

483
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,880
by, well, me,

484
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,000
I sentence you, Victor Zsasz,

485
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
to die.

486
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,760
Any last words?

487
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,840
Well said.

488
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,760
Get him out of there.

489
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,960
Overruled!

490
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,760
What the hell are you doing?

491
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,240
Trying to keep you all
from making a terrible mistake.

492
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,320
See?

493
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:30,560
Jim Gordon cares more about
protecting a murderer

494
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,520
than he does about protecting you!

495
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,440
You've lost them, Jim.

496
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,040
They don't believe in you anymore.

497
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,960
They're mine now.

498
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,800
I got to be honest, Jim, I don't know
how safe Zsasz will be at the GCPD.

499
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,320
There's more than a few cops
that want to see him on a slab.

500
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,720
That's why we're not taking him
there.

501
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,720
Wait.

502
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,160
Tell me this is not a catch
and release.

503
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,720
What choice do I have?

504
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,320
Either I let him go or he's dead
for something he didn't do.

505
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,960
Thank you, Jim.

506
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,320
- I'm not doing this for you.
- Of course not.

507
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,520
This city will never be
what you want it to be, Jim.

508
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,000
It's always gonna belong
to the bad guys, like me.

509
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,280
Give him your gun, Harvey.

510
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,400
- What?
- Yeah. What?

511
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,480
Give him your gun.

512
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,880
- Jim.
- Do it!

513
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,680
You got a death wish, Jim?

514
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,120
'Cause I'll kill you.

515
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,120
Harvey, too.

516
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,880
Maybe.

517
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,680
Maybe I'm just tired
of listening to you, Victor.

518
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,840
Do it.

519
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,640
You know what? You seem tired.

520
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,920
Maybe we should do this
another day, yeah?

521
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,240
People like you are always trying
to own this city.

522
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,280
But you never will.

523
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,240
Now get the hell out of my face.

524
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,000
See you around, Jim.

525
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,640
A shoot out?

526
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,880
- Are you serious?
- What? I could've taken him.

527
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,960
That's not the point.

528
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,840
Never, ever ask me to do
anything like that again.

529
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,560
Pull yourself together.

530
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:45,360
You see, a river cuts through rock
not because of its power,

531
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,040
but because of its persistence.

532
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,680
So what do we do
when we feel like giving up?

533
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,320
Dig a little deeper.

534
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,080
And what do we do when we can't
possibly go on any longer?

535
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,120
Dig a little deeper.

536
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,560
And what do we...

537
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,920
Deep enough?

538
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,520
Well, Selina,

539
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,120
I must say...

540
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,360
Don't say anything.

541
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,000
Selina! Selina!

542
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,320
- Let me go!
- It's done! It's over.

543
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,040
Jeremiah!

544
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,240
We need to get out of here, now.

545
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,360
I hate stairs.

546
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,440
Oh, God.

547
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,800
Oh, no! Go away!

548
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,600
No, hey, wait.
I need to know what you know.

549
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,640
Oh, please.
Oh, oh, please don't hurt me.

550
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,520
Listen, lady, I'm not gonna hurt you.

551
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,560
I just want to know what you saw.

552
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,840
The... the roof.
You... you were on the roof.

553
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:58,040
And you had some kind of a,
you had some kind of a, of a rocket.

554
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,600
That's... that's not possible.

555
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,680
And... and you shot it at,
at that building.

556
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,520
Oh, I'm sorry.

557
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,400
I promise,

558
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,280
I won't tell anybody.

559
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,960
I know you won't.

560
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,400
You said you wouldn't hurt me.

561
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,040
I'm really very sorry.

562
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,920
Oh, no! Oh, no!

563
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,600
Spotlight's off.

564
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,840
You forget to pay the electric bill?

565
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,200
What do you want, Barbara?

566
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,240
Same as you.

567
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,440
To protect my people.

568
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,280
Your tip didn't pan out.

569
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,560
Well, I've got another one.

570
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,960
A lead on a guy selling RPGs.

571
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,240
He moves about, but...

572
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,520
That all?

573
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,160
I heard some of your people
went over to Penguin.

574
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,520
Yeah.

575
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,000
Well, you can't win them all.

576
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,400
Poor Jim.

577
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,920
All alone again.

578
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,600
Get out of here, Barbara.

579
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,440
No one knows
what it's like to be him.

580
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,400
To carry the weight.

581
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,440
I told you to leave.

582
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,040
I heard you.
