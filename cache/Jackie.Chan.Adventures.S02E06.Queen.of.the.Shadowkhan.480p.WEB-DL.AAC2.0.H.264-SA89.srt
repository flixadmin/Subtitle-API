1
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:14,013
Ahh. Finally.

2
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:16,515
Uncle said this book
could help put an end

3
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,817
to all of this
"demon portal" business.

4
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:21,253
I hope
uncle is right.

5
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,622
Aah! Oh!

6
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:26,825
Uhh...Uhh...Oh!

7
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,360
Shadowkhan!

8
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:25,384
Uhh!

9
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:30,923
Let go! Leggo, leggo!

10
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:51,677
Chan at 12 o'clock.

11
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,682
Grab the ladder.
- We're showing chan the door.

12
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,824
Enforcers: Heave, ho!

13
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:09,828
Aaah!

14
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,677
Whew. I guess
it's curtains for me.

15
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,049
Uh...
Oopsy?

16
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,385
Heh heh. Ha.

17
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:34,887
Boy: Oh, wow!

18
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:37,923
Girl: Drew got a tattoo?!

19
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,027
Yeah, been thinkin' I
might get one of those.

20
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,096
Oh, yeah, sure, Jade.

21
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:46,298
Like your dig-in-the-dirt-
with-tiny-brushes

22
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,301
uncle Jackie would ever
let you get a tattoo.

23
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:50,903
He would
so let me, drew!

24
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:52,938
By tomorrow, I'm gonna
have the gnarliest tattoo

25
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,475
in the history of...Gnarl!

26
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:58,644
Uncle: <i> The archive</i>
à <i> of demon magic</i>

27
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:01,113
is an encyclopedia
of spells,

28
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:04,883
written by the demon
sorcerers themselves.

29
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:08,887
But it may hold clues
which will help defeat

30
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,490
the demons who created it.

31
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:15,093
Both of you, clear room
for my new research project.

32
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:16,895
Both: Yes, uncle.

33
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:24,836
(Humming)

34
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,004
Hey, Jackie,
how was your trip?

35
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,839
Have you lost weight?
Can I get a tattoo?

36
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,841
Ha, my trip was--

37
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,510
a tattoo?!

38
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:32,778
Please, Jackie?

39
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,912
All the kids
at school are--

40
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:34,980
no.
But--

41
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:36,048
no.
But--

42
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,115
no.
But--

43
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:40,419
no tattoos
for Jade. Period.

44
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:42,221
Aw!

45
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:43,956
(Sighs) Drew was right.

46
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,958
What am I gonna--

47
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,328
Jade: Whoa.

48
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,164
My tattoo doesn't
have to be real.

49
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,299
It just has to be gnarly.

50
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,874
A little ink...

51
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,511
A little water...

52
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,347
A little squeeze...

53
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:11,516
And I'm bad to the bone.

54
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:14,319
I will put up
with a lot, shendu,

55
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:17,022
but I draw the line
at wearing a dress!

56
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,591
Shendu:
This is a sorcerer's robe!

57
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,692
Finn: Whoa!

58
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:22,127
Shendu-dette.

59
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,195
Pretty dress.

60
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:24,930
Very becoming.

61
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:28,934
Grr! Where is my archive?!

62
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,168
Uh, chan's got it?

63
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,970
But it wasn't
our fault!

64
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,839
Yeah, that's right.
The shadowkhan
were there, too.

65
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:36,808
The shadowkhan
are my puppets.

66
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,978
They do only
what I command.

67
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,948
Are you suggesting
this is my fault?

68
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,049
Uh-uh.

69
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:45,851
Then redeem yourselves.

70
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:48,020
No doubt
- chan has brought my book

71
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:49,354
to his uncle's shop.

72
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:51,189
Oh, but every time
we go there,

73
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,958
we get our butts kicked.

74
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,193
You have never
been there...

75
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,129
With me.

76
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:58,597
Boy: Wow.

77
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,399
Girl: It's even gnarlier
than drew's tattoo.

78
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,434
And I didn't scream once
while they were doing it.

79
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,336
(Scoffs) That
looks about as real

80
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:07,472
as those magic ninjas
Jade's always talking about.

81
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,740
The ninjas are real,

82
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,275
and so's my tattoo!

83
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:11,410
Unlike yours.

84
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:13,679
Hey, where's
your tattoo?

85
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:16,682
Uh...Well,
I thought you knew.

86
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:17,983
They peel right off.

87
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,484
Like this!

88
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,621
Hey, watch it, drew!
Cut it out!

89
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:24,222
Whoa!

90
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:25,290
Uh...

91
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,859
Told you
it was real.

92
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,429
Come on, off!

93
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:31,663
Off!

94
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,598
I'm in trouble.

95
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,139
Hey.

96
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,511
Jade...

97
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,313
Why are you wearing
snow boots?

98
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:49,681
Heard it might snow?

99
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,917
It's 72 degrees out.

100
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:53,985
Avalanche!

101
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,723
Heh. False alarm.

102
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,930
Oh! Jade,
wash this off
right now!

103
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:06,798
Er, tried that.

104
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,633
What?
It's a real tattoo?

105
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,001
By accident!

106
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,704
How can you get a tattoo
by acci--ohh!

107
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,239
(Uncle gasps)

108
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,212
This is a symbol
of great evil.

109
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:23,315
We must find a spell
to remove it immediately.

110
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:29,287
Who knows what catastrophe
such a tattoo will bring?

111
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,957
Hand over the--

112
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,992
yaaaah!

113
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:38,029
Angry crow takes flight!

114
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,206
Yah!
Uhh!

115
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,313
Mad monkey kung fu!

116
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,616
Mantis boxing style!

117
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,251
Rabbit punch!

118
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,390
Swish!

119
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,242
I got it!

120
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:27,446
Aah!

121
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,019
Lion stalks its prey!

122
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:38,256
Run like cheetah,
leap like gazelle!

123
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,630
Uhh...Uhh!

124
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,767
Uh-oh.

125
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,203
Yaaaah!

126
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:54,940
Black tiger
corners little lamb.

127
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:56,241
Help!

128
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:57,576
Anybody!

129
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,554
(Gasps) Shadowkhan.

130
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,623
Oh, no, oh, no
oh, no, oh, no.

131
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,303
Bunny flees
from vicious jackals.

132
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,105
Aaaah!

133
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:34,279
I'm...Still alive?

134
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,849
Weird.

135
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,325
I am telling you

136
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,828
it was the shadowkhan
who did this to me!

137
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,830
Finn: Chan kicked
our butts, too.

138
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:54,032
Yeah, you don't
hear us lying
about it.

139
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,800
Need I remind you,

140
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:59,371
the shadowkhan do
only what I command.

141
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,474
Come, minions!

142
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:07,946
Minions?

143
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:13,084
Valmont:
It would seem you have
lost your touch, shendu.

144
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:16,221
Shendu: I have not
lost my touch!

145
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,890
Chan is obviously
using the power

146
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,426
of my archive
against me!

147
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,728
I don't care
how you do it,

148
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,032
but get my book!

149
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,199
Jackie: Jade?

150
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,501
Jade?!

151
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:31,570
Wake up,
you're going
to be late.

152
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:32,837
I am going
to uncle's

153
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,440
to help him find
a tattoo-removing
spell,

154
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,609
so I will see you
there after school.

155
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,247
(Yawns) Mmm.

156
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,783
Jackie: Oh,
and don't forget
to eat breakfast.

157
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:52,090
(Scoffs) I wish
I had time for breakfast.

158
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,998
Aah!

159
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,409
Breakfast?

160
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,881
The tattoo.

161
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:18,917
That's what happened
last night!

162
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,786
I called for help
and you guys came!

163
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,189
Jade: <i> Tres chique.</i>

164
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:25,890
Mmm.

165
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:28,693
Now this has to be
our little secret.

166
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,862
If Jackie won't
let me have a tattoo,

167
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,698
there's no way
he'd let me have
my own ninjas.

168
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:39,004
Oh, forgot my wallet.
Are you ready for--

169
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:41,539
under control.

170
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,808
Why are you
wearing black?

171
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,744
I'm in a dark mood.

172
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,752
Jade: Get ready, guys.

173
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:56,187
Time to prove
my magic ninjas
are for real.

174
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,922
Ha ha! Oh, yeah?

175
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:00,725
Being dumb enough to get
a real tattoo is one thing,

176
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,961
but ninjas? Come on!

177
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,229
Ha ha ha!

178
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:08,233
(Kids laugh)

179
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,168
Let me show you.

180
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:22,747
Heh heh.
Later, ninja girl.

181
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,916
Ohh.

182
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,652
Finn to ratso:
I'm in position.

183
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,525
Uncle: Too busy!
Come back later!

184
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:36,928
But I am a wealthy
art collector.

185
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,865
Welcome to
uncle's rare finds.

186
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,373
Were you looking
for something
in particular?

187
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,409
Oh, just some
priceless artifacts

188
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,479
for the many,
many museums I own.

189
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:56,247
Jackie! Tohru!

190
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,782
Uncle: Bring tea!

191
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:03,955
Uncle: This one dates back
to the han dynasty.

192
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:07,125
It is a very good
piece.

193
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,896
Uh, I'll let you know.

194
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:17,135
You are both
very bad salesmen!

195
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,572
Having ninja tutors
is gonna make homework

196
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,474
way more fun!

197
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:25,477
Can you believe
they bought
my disguise?

198
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:28,213
Ho ho ho!
What a plan.

199
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:30,281
We're geniuses!

200
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,863
They're here.

201
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,399
Give 'em a spanking.

202
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:51,102
You were too slow
with the tea.

203
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,804
Good salesmen
must always--

204
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:53,905
wha--wha--wha--

205
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:56,941
where is the archive?!

206
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,910
Uhh!

207
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,302
Jade! Jade!

208
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,883
It's ok.
He's one of us.

209
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,087
Jade: See, Jackie?
Total control.

210
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,489
They do what I tell 'em,

211
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,257
and I only tell 'em
to do good.

212
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:47,725
So can I keep 'em?

213
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:48,893
Jackie: No, Jade.

214
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,328
Aw, why not?

215
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,530
Because
- you're turning blue.

216
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,098
Blue's my favorite color.

217
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,467
Besides,
we gave tohru a chance.

218
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:57,802
Tohru is human.

219
00:13:57,804 --> 00:14:00,071
Now I want you
to make them go away

220
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,706
until uncle
can find a--

221
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,074
hot chaaaa!

222
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:04,876
I have found a potion

223
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:07,812
that will make
Jade's tattoo vanish.

224
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:11,015
But I like my tattoo.
You can't do this to me.

225
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,951
Jackie:
It's for your own
safety, Jade.

226
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:17,121
Now sit still
while I apply the potion.

227
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,625
Ohh!

228
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:21,793
Jade: Do not touch me!

229
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,095
I am and shall remain

230
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:27,498
queen of the shadowkhan.

231
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,670
Jade!

232
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:33,872
I...Uh...

233
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,139
You're grounded!

234
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:37,609
(Scoffs) You're not giving
me orders anymore.

235
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,720
I must find her.

236
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,822
I will take
the potion.

237
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:55,360
Run a background check
and--whoa!

238
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:58,496
Jade, you--
what happened to you?

239
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,331
I've become queen...

240
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,902
(Gasps)

241
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:07,305
And every queen
needs a palace.

242
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:10,241
Jade!

243
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,243
Jaaade!

244
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,444
Jade?
Black.

245
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,779
Jade's gone ninja.

246
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:17,382
And they've taken
section 13.

247
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:22,453
Jade: Fo...Shee...Kwong...

248
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:25,256
Shoo...Wee--

249
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:28,459
grr! How can I know
the secrets of the archive

250
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:29,861
if I can't understand

251
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,829
a single,
stupid word of it?!

252
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,798
Bring me someone who can.

253
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,633
Shendu: So are
you telling me

254
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:38,269
I still don't
have my book back,

255
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:41,906
and the child
controls my minions?!

256
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,310
Valmont:
What? Aah! Help!

257
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,379
Shendu: No.

258
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:54,018
This could work
to my advantage.

259
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:03,061
Valmont: (Gasps)
We're in section 13.

260
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,862
The talismans!

261
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,331
Shendu: Quiet, you fool!

262
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,666
Take the talismans
if you desire them.

263
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:11,536
I am interested
in far greater powers.

264
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:14,072
Valmont: Smashing!
I'll just--uhh!

265
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:17,976
Shendu:
I require no talismans,
your majesty.

266
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:21,412
I only wish
to pay my respects.

267
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:33,491
Ow!

268
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,859
Uh...Uh...

269
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,629
(Gasps)

270
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,709
Jade: Now read me
a story, demon.

271
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,178
Forgive me,
your highness.

272
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,583
I could easily translate
this entire volume for you,

273
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:03,321
but true power does
not reside in textbooks.

274
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:06,724
I could teach you,
dark queen.

275
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:09,527
And why should
I trust you?

276
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,896
Beware!

277
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,503
Oh! Uhh! I--oh!

278
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:20,938
You!

279
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,075
Do you
trust me now?

280
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,045
Take the potion from him!

281
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,149
Ooh...

282
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:32,984
Gaaa!

283
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:34,218
Oh!

284
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,267
Haa...Uhh...

285
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:50,334
Ooof!

286
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,940
Your skill far exceeds
your years, majesty.

287
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,245
Uhh!

288
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,654
Oh. Bwooo!

289
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,895
(Gasps)

290
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,904
No!

291
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,242
Hear this, my queen:

292
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:34,879
Your first
and most valuable
lesson:

293
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:38,182
Always destroy
your enemies.

294
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:40,384
Don't listen
to him, Jade.

295
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:43,020
He's a demon.
I'm your uncle,

296
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:44,122
your friend!

297
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,723
(Scoffs) You were.

298
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,125
But things
are different now.

299
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,060
I have new friends.

300
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:51,395
Oh? If shendu
is your friend,

301
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,264
why is he stealing
your book?

302
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,768
Hiss! Traitor!

303
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:00,771
After him!

304
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,052
Nooo!

305
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,625
No!

306
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:24,028
Destroy chan!

307
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:28,499
No, destroy...

308
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,001
The book!

309
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,239
Nooo!

310
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:36,674
Ohh!

311
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:40,811
Hyaaaaah!

312
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,413
Uhh!

313
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,318
Ooof!

314
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,320
Valmont: You could've
at least let me grab

315
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:51,489
the talismans, shendu.

316
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:01,832
Very important
rule of magic.

317
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:06,270
Always make extra.
Just in case.

318
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:09,173
Ohh...I have
a weird feeling

319
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:11,108
I did something bad.

320
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,977
If you mean
getting a tattoo

321
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,212
when I told you
not to,

322
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,580
yes, you did.

323
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,381
But if you mean
destroying

324
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,083
the demon archive...

325
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,754
We can live with that.

326
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,860
Hey, Jackie, what kinds
of books do you like to read?

327
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:32,930
I like mystery,
comedy, everything.

328
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:36,133
All can helping me
for the location scout.

329
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:37,401
Different pictures, wow.

330
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:41,872
I like good magazines
and education magazines.

331
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,874
I can really learn
a lot of things.

332
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,443
It really helps me.
