1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,350
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,696
<i>Word of the chemical spill</i>

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,880
- reached the mainland.
- Reunification isn't happening.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,394
No action until the government

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,994
can determine if Gotham's safe.

6
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,756
I sentence you,
Victor Zsasz, to die.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,600
Get him out of there!

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,792
What the hell are you doing?!

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,191
Trying to keep you all
from making a terrible mistake.

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,312
- Her name is Ivy.
- She's a witch.

11
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,718
I'm feeding the earth
with these wretched creatures.

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,115
It consumes them,

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,590
and then it flourishes.

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,056
We wouldn't have escaped
without you.

15
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,080
You saved me

16
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,120
<i>and my friends.</i>

17
00:00:35,121 --> 00:00:36,121
I wanted to help.

18
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,639
- Come with us.
- Are you telling me

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,000
you found a way out of Gotham?

20
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,190
It's a submarine.

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,555
I've been giving you space,

22
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,296
but we have to talk
about how this is gonna work.

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,536
I'm gonna be a part
of this kid's life.

24
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,870
- Oh, you seem pretty confident about that.
- I am.

25
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,872
You're having a baby
with Barbara.

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,958
Can't change the past, so...

27
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,560
I guess we just have
to live with it.

28
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,999
Come on, people!

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,480
Time's a-wastin'!

30
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,000
The filtration system that
Lucius designed is working.

31
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,880
What you're doing is both
unnecessary and it's reckless.

32
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,839
Our supplies of drinking water
are at critical levels.

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,759
Every day, the gangs
grow more aggressive.

34
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,151
If I can get a cease-fire,
even a temporary one,

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,317
then when reunification
does happen,

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,200
at least there will be people
left to save.

37
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,595
They deserve that much.

38
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,399
And does your child
deserve a father?

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,560
You have no problem taking
care of the entire city.

40
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,432
What about focusing
on just one life?

41
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,960
<i>Why are you
always so ready</i>

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,434
<i>to put yourself
in the crosshairs?</i>

43
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,599
It's like you won't be satisfied
until you sacrifice yourself.

44
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,440
You really believe that?

45
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:43,399
<i>I do.</i>

46
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,880
And it scares me.

47
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,880
How is this gonna work?

48
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,794
Am I supposed
to just stay at home

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,434
and raise this child
with Barbara

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,910
while you go cowboying off
all the time?

51
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,560
It won't always be like this.

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
After reunification...

53
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,355
Nothing will be different.

54
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,875
Unless you stop being...

55
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
Me?

56
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,240
<i>Hey, Jim.</i>

57
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,350
I have to go.

58
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,791
- We'll talk after.
- If there is an after.

59
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,839
Oh, yeah?! Oh-ho!

60
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,557
Oswald, where
the hell is Nygma?

61
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,393
Shouldn't we have left the city
already?

62
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
Ms. Kean,

63
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,513
this may come as a surprise,

64
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,871
but building a submarine
from scratch

65
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,952
by yourself takes time.

66
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,753
- Patience.
- Easy for you to say.

67
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,593
You're not
a walking egg timer.

68
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,400
Tell him to get
a move on.

69
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,000
And why, exactly,

70
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,117
are you hosting Gordon's
gangland get-together?

71
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,919
Keep your friends close and
your enemies closer, my dear.

72
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,880
If we're really going
to leave Gotham,

73
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,314
we need to keep Gordon happy.

74
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,352
You know all about
that, don't you?

75
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,399
It was a momentary slip.

76
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,320
The world was on fire.

77
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,679
<i>Jim,</i>

78
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,750
it's your show.

79
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,953
<i>Mi casa, su casa.</i>

80
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,113
I'll make this short.

81
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,434
Gotham is running dry.

82
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,115
Our supply of clean water

83
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,237
will only last
a few more months.

84
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,074
So you have a choice.

85
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,914
You can keep killing each other,

86
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,390
<i>fighting over
what little water is left,</i>

87
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,631
<i>maybe eke out a few
more months, then die.</i>

88
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,280
Or...

89
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,271
we can all agree right now

90
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,760
to an immediate cease-fire.

91
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,875
The government
will not annex a war zone.

92
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,711
If we can show them that we
deserve to rejoin the mainland,

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,514
supply chain will be restored

94
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,673
and we will all survive
until reunification.

95
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,869
<i>That's the choice.</i>

96
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
Life or death.

97
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,599
Your call.

98
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,390
Weapons down!

99
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,789
Get back!

100
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,159
Jim, you see
where the shooter was?

101
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Jim.

102
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
Oh, my God.

103
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,840
<i>Get back!</i>

104
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,995
You're gonna be all right.

105
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,879
It's bad.
We got to move him. Now.

106
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,872
Clinic's too far.
M.E.'s office.

107
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Alvarez, come on. Help.

108
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,160
On it.

109
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,316
Take my gun.

110
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,358
One, two, three.

111
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,795
All right.
Get back.

112
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,395
Back! Get back!

113
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,639
Well,

114
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,835
I did not see that coming.

115
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,713
What made you choose this,

116
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,240
of all places,

117
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,993
for a scavenging mission?

118
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,000
Just trust me, okay?

119
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,639
What the hell?

120
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,760
Sit.

121
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,196
<i>Wow.</i>

122
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,716
<i>Candles.</i>

123
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,160
If I didn't know
any better,

124
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,351
I'd say this was
a... date.

125
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,990
Maybe it is.

126
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,080
That okay with you?

127
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,750
Maybe.

128
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,316
Good.

129
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,230
So let's eat.

130
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,360
Lee!

131
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
<i>It's Jim.
He's lost</i>

132
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,200
a lot of blood.
Can you save him?

133
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
Come with me!

134
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,232
Doc says he's gonna be okay.

135
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,520
He's gonna pull through.

136
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,870
But until then,
I'm acting captain.

137
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,352
Now, the gangs of this city

138
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,913
think this is their time
that they can run wild!

139
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,999
They are dead wrong!

140
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,760
I want us to take
to the streets.

141
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,151
It is show-of-force time!

142
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,993
We ain't gonna give 'em an inch!

143
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,160
Harper,

144
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,799
I want you to organize
patrol teams.

145
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,160
What are you gonna do?

146
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,036
I'm gonna find out
who shot my partner.

147
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,512
The bullet
shattered against a rib.

148
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,352
I have to get
all the fragments out.

149
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,109
I haven't done general surgery
since med school.

150
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,080
There.

151
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,056
All right,
there's an exit wound,

152
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,560
so the rest
must've gone through.

153
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
I need to sew him up.

154
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Can you get my kit?

155
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,076
<i>Right away.</i>

156
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,276
Come on, Jim.

157
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,600
You can do this,
but you have to fight.

158
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,076
You hear me?

159
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,069
You have to fight.

160
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,593
<i>Order in the court.</i>

161
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,915
<i>James Gordon,</i>

162
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,720
<i>you have been brought here</i>

163
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,395
to be judged
for your many crimes,

164
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,314
and your very life hangs
in the balance.

165
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,230
Do you understand?

166
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,680
No, I...

167
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,071
The defendant understands

168
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,356
and waives his right

169
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,795
<i>to appeal.</i>

170
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,790
The trial of James Gordon

171
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,920
will now begin.

172
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
No! Wait!

173
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
That...

174
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,995
was the best canned meal
I've ever had.

175
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,116
<i>And if this
was a date,</i>

176
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,376
<i>I don't know how
you're gonna top it</i>

177
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,039
when everything gets back
to normal.

178
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,391
I don't think
things are ever gonna be normal.

179
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,360
<i>For me, anyways.</i>

180
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,720
What do you mean?

181
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,154
Wayne Manor's gone.

182
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,520
And I know that a lot of people
lost a lot more,

183
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,353
but part of me wonders
if it wasn't fate.

184
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,029
It wasn't.

185
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,192
It was Jeremiah
blowing up your house.

186
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,237
Maybe it's time to move on.

187
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,915
You mean, like, leave Gotham?

188
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,194
<i>Bruce, forget
Wayne Manor.</i>

189
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,033
This city is your home.

190
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,240
And how many terrible things
have happened to it

191
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,515
because of me?

192
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,155
Galavan.

193
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,675
Ra's al Ghul.

194
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,157
If this city really is my home,

195
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,760
then maybe
the best thing

196
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,593
I can do for it is leave.

197
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,835
I have to say...

198
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,917
...kind of agree with you
on that one,

199
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,353
billionaire boy.

200
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,635
<i>Jim Gordon's blood on my floor.</i>

201
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,474
Olga!

202
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,753
Why is the help never around
when you need them?

203
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,280
This could be good for us.

204
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,440
You especially.

205
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,274
Are you serious?

206
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,554
Your baby daddy is
the top cop in Gotham.

207
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,152
A dead Jim Gordon is
the only way

208
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,118
you can hold on
to your little...

209
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
bundle of joy.

210
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,194
Harvey, how is our dear...

211
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,070
Who the hell did it?!
If I find out it was you,

212
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,595
I swear to God...

213
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,195
It wasn't me!
I merely supplied the venue!

214
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,073
At your boss's request!

215
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,674
That doesn't mean squat!

216
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,395
Fine. You want to know
who's to blame?

217
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,914
James Gordon!

218
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,436
He invited
every criminal in Gotham!

219
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,319
What did he think
was gonna happen?

220
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,113
How about you, huh?

221
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,154
When did you two become so...
buddy-buddy?

222
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,880
Maybe when you
hatched up a plan

223
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,356
so you could keep that baby
for yourself.

224
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,553
Harvey, whatever
you think of me,

225
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,554
I did not plot to kill
my child's father.

226
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,989
Well, someone here did!

227
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,436
Someone in this room
shot Jim Gordon,

228
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,831
and I'm not leaving
till I find out who it was!

229
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,118
Wrong! The shooter was not here!

230
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,873
Look at the window, stupid!

231
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,713
The shot came
from outside.

232
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,918
If the shooter was there...

233
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,115
and the trajectory was here...

234
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,790
Jim was...

235
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,556
then the bullet...

236
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
Uh-huh.

237
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,631
I'm gonna find out who this was,

238
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,630
and when I do,
there's gonna be hell to pay.

239
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,355
Harvey.

240
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,033
Is there anything I can do?

241
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,751
Yeah. You can keep the gangs
from tearing the city apart.

242
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,029
What do you want?

243
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,429
You...

244
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,239
I will deal with later.

245
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
I'm here...

246
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,436
...for you.

247
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,195
I need you to come with me.

248
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,874
Why would I do that?

249
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,073
Because you love me so much.

250
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,433
Well, not yet, but you will.

251
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,955
Don't mess with him, Ivy.

252
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,554
Protecting
your boyfriend?

253
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
That's cute.

254
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,710
But I thought
that might happen, so...

255
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,760
I brought a friend.

256
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,440
<i>I stumbled across
this charming man</i>

257
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,636
<i>on the way over here,</i>

258
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,918
and apparently,
you two know each other.

259
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,790
Leave her out of this!

260
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,839
You know, I heard you talking
about the future of Gotham...

261
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,752
but Gotham will be
what <i>I</i> decide.

262
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,713
A green world.

263
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,637
Won't that be beautiful?

264
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,950
Gorgeous.

265
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,033
Bruce and I have to go.

266
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,874
You always did think
you were better than me.

267
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,832
But without my plants,

268
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,435
you never would
have left your bed.

269
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,037
I made you strong again.

270
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,789
Think about that

271
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,959
while my friend
is cutting out your heart.

272
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,719
There are so many things
I wish I could say to you.

273
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,516
So many things
I wish we could do.

274
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,513
This can't be the end.

275
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,150
Come on, Jim.

276
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,236
Talk to me.

277
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,753
Say something.

278
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,120
Speak.

279
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,755
No.

280
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,760
This isn't right.
I shouldn't be here.

281
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,936
<i>- Silence! Silence!</i>
- You have to listen to me.

282
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,237
The prosecution will now give
its opening remarks.

283
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,596
Your Honor, Jim Gordon's crimes
are a matter of public record.

284
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,117
<i>He's failed Gotham
at every turn.</i>

285
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,076
He failed to clean up
the city...

286
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,079
failed to stop the bridges
from being destroyed,

287
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,076
failed to protect
those poor, innocent souls

288
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,039
in the refuge
he himself created...

289
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920
Haven.

290
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,996
I tried.

291
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,714
- I did the best...
<i>- Silence!</i>

292
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,200
One more outburst and you
will be held in contempt.

293
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,916
I'm hurt.

294
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,596
I need help. Please.

295
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,709
Continue.

296
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,038
The issue here is not
how many people have died

297
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,799
because of Jim Gordon,

298
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,912
<i>but how many more must die</i>

299
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,430
<i>in order to satisfy
his need to be a hero.</i>

300
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,395
Therefore we pose

301
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,517
one simple question:

302
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,715
Are the people
in Jim Gordon's life

303
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,000
better off with him alive

304
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,949
<i>or dead?</i>

305
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,834
I think I'm dying.

306
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,056
<i>The prosecution
would like to call</i>

307
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,833
<i>its first witness,
Your Honor.</i>

308
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,073
Dr. Lee Thompkins.

309
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,629
Come on, Jim.

310
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,990
Hold on.

311
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,116
How is he?

312
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,396
Touch and go.

313
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,277
He's
stable for now.

314
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,416
I removed all the
bullet fragments,

315
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,432
but something keeps
pulling him down.

316
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,750
Where are the fragments?

317
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,556
What is it?

318
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,350
"V.Z."

319
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,836
Victor Zsasz.

320
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,520
Okey-dokey.

321
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
Time to boogie.

322
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,879
Hey!

323
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,439
I'm only here for Gordon.

324
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,039
So all of you stay down.

325
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,034
<i>'Cause I see anyone...</i>

326
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,159
and, you know...

327
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,960
bang.

328
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,036
Oi, oi!

329
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,636
Now, I heard you were looking
for Jim Gordon.

330
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

331
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,550
Listen, I know we have history.

332
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,592
Let's just let bygones
be bygones.

333
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,796
Yeah, right.

334
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,437
You did this to my face.

335
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,600
<i>Whatever.</i>

336
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,155
It's not like you were much
of a looker before, anyway.

337
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,435
Ivy says you
hurt her feelings.

338
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,000
Why would you do that!?

339
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,955
She's so sweet!

340
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,914
Ivy didn't make me strong.

341
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
I made me strong.

342
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,279
Tell me where she took Bruce.

343
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,236
<i>The only reason I'm not
ending you right now</i>

344
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,680
is the thought of
the look on your face

345
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,559
when Jim Gordon walks
through that door.

346
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,871
Because he's alive,
you son of a bitch!

347
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,635
Ugh. What did you eat?

348
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,314
You smell like a butcher.

349
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,279
You know, I'm vegan now.

350
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,036
Why kill Jim now?

351
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,839
Makes no sense.

352
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,559
He saved your
miserable ass.

353
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,236
He prevented Penguin
from executing you.

354
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,320
If anyone, you should be
going after Cobblepot.

355
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,234
Yeah, that's a good point.

356
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,233
Maybe I'll do him next.

357
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,800
It's kind of not up to me.

358
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,720
You're working for someone?

359
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,030
Oh.

360
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,160
Sorry.

361
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,396
I want a name!

362
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,757
Ah, what's in a name?

363
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,671
A rose by any other name
would smell as sweet.

364
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,553
You know,
I'm really taking the time

365
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,552
to stop and smell the roses
these days.

366
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,393
Like, actual roses.

367
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,309
They're great.

368
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,755
Are you high?

369
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,920
On love.

370
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,390
But like I said...

371
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,760
my lips are sealed.

372
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,113
Ivy Pepper.

373
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,550
You said it, not me.

374
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,712
Uh, I'm technically
not allowed to say it.

375
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,434
Her name. Which is
such a bummer,

376
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,751
because it's the most beautiful
name in the world.

377
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,120
You watch him.

378
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,276
I could say it all day.

379
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,954
Hey, I <i>will</i> say it all day.

380
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,120
Ivy.

381
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,516
Ivy Pepper.

382
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,196
Mrs...

383
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,476
Ivy Pepper Zsasz.

384
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
Oh, that sounds good.

385
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,319
Here you are,
Miss Thompkins.

386
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,152
Careful, it's...
a little bit hot.

387
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,599
Forgive me, but I...

388
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,435
heard on the grapevine
that you and Captain Gordon

389
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,398
had a rather heated exchange
this morning.

390
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,710
<i>Oh, God.</i>

391
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,390
Was it that bad?

392
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,879
Apparently,
it was like a session

393
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,030
of the Italian parliament.

394
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,955
You have misgivings

395
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,629
about the arrival
of this child, don't you?

396
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,991
What am I getting
myself into, Alfred?

397
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,036
How am I supposed
to raise a child

398
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,590
alongside a psychopath
like Barbara Kean?

399
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,956
I mean, how the hell
is this gonna work?

400
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,040
But... but that's
not all of it.

401
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,319
If Jim and I are gonna do this,
then we have to do it together.

402
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,675
You know how he is.

403
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,079
I don't know
what's going on

404
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,639
inside that man's
head sometimes.

405
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,593
I think you'll find
that he needs you

406
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,240
a lot more than
he's letting on.

407
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,272
Well, I need to
hear it from him.

408
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,472
I never thought that this was
how my life was going to be.

409
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,357
I have no interest
in being a father myself.

410
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,079
I always presumed that
I was unfit to be one.

411
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,598
And then I found myself...

412
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,791
one night staring
down an alley at this little boy

413
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,919
quite literally
shaking with fear.

414
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,160
I don't know, it's funny,
isn't it, what life throws you?

415
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,118
I'm keenly aware that I am not
Master Bruce's flesh and blood.

416
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,960
But it's the moments.

417
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,473
The little things, like...

418
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,236
like when he uses a skill
that I once taught him,

419
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,313
or we laugh at a joke
that only he and I share.

420
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,274
Those have been some of the most
ecstatic moments of my life.

421
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,753
Nothing can possibly
prepare you for that joy.

422
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,715
The hows and the whats...

423
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,199
you'll figure that stuff out.

424
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,112
What matters is this:

425
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,915
you'll be an exquisite mother,

426
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,275
and that child, he or she
will be extraordinary...

427
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,275
...because of you.

428
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,840
Thank you, Alfred.

429
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,992
Jim, can you hear me?

430
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,520
I'm right here,
right next to you.

431
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,799
<i>Can you feel me?</i>

432
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,795
Lee?

433
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,680
Dr. Lee Thompkins.

434
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,675
<i>You've suffered at this man's hands
more than anyone.</i>

435
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,029
Broken heart,

436
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,549
broken engagement.

437
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,355
A lost child.

438
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,753
And yet, you're still with him.

439
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,156
I love him.

440
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,710
<i>After all the pain
he's caused you,</i>

441
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,190
would your life be better,

442
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,875
could it not still <i>be</i> better,

443
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,029
without Jim Gordon?

444
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,794
Answer the question.

445
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,920
- Lee?
<i>- I'll ask it a different way.</i>

446
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,510
Would you, Dr. Lee Thompkins,

447
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,918
be better off
if Jim Gordon were dead?

448
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,880
I'm sorry.

449
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,632
Everything he touches dies.

450
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,520
Prosecution rests, Your Honor.

451
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,396
You made her say that.

452
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,632
<i>I didn't make her
say anything.</i>

453
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,069
Ask them.

454
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,550
<i>Who are they?</i>

455
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,155
<i>More people who trusted
you, who believed you</i>

456
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,552
when you said you
would protect them.

457
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,116
They're from Haven.

458
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,480
I think I'm dying.

459
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,112
And isn't it about time?

460
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,196
The verdict's in.

461
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
You're guilty.

462
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,874
Hey, Jeff, listen to me.

463
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,256
One day, you're
gonna meet someone

464
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,720
who's gonna totally
change your life,

465
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,439
and that's gonna
make you happy,

466
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,518
and you deserve it.

467
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,709
Or not.

468
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,156
Is she here?

469
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,595
She's here, isn't she?

470
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,389
Sweetie.

471
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,873
All I asked of you

472
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,553
was to kill Jim Gordon.

473
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,436
You're not angry, are you?

474
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,313
'Cause I'll do it.
I'll do it right now.

475
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,276
I'll do it.

476
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,794
You keep the cops busy.

477
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,477
Luckily, the other part of my
plan is coming together nicely.

478
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,110
Lucius!

479
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,720
Bruce.

480
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,998
I had no idea
you were stopping by.

481
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,520
I wanted to check
on your progress.

482
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,038
Well, the toxicity levels
in this river continue to drop.

483
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,510
At this point, we'll be under
the threshold mandated

484
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,518
by the government
sooner than expected.

485
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,512
It's not glamorous work,
but we are helping

486
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,672
to save the lives
of thousands of people.

487
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,832
People. Ugh.

488
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,316
I'm sorry. Did you just say
"People. Ugh"?

489
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,551
Lucius,
what if I were to tell you

490
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,155
I have in my possession
the most intoxicating perfume

491
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,470
you'll ever smell?

492
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,680
I would tell you that's
an abrupt change of topic.

493
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,196
Can we go back to the part
where you said "People. Ugh"?

494
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,036
Mmm.

495
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,996
Oh, my... goodness.

496
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,275
<i>Lucius,</i>

497
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,511
Ivy sent me here to get you
to shut down the plant.

498
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,279
<i>Can you do
that for her?</i>

499
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,360
For Ivy? Anything.

500
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,478
She is so great.

501
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,714
♪ They say, they say
she's got to grow up ♪

502

she's got to get a job ♪

503
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,990

504
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,675
♪ Of the bunch. Oh! ♪

505
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,634
Raise your glasses.

506
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,354
I called you all here today

507
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,240
because Jim Gordon is
at death's door.

508
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,676
Yeah!

509
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,672
For years, he has hounded us,

510
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,071
beaten us, shot us.

511
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,435
<i>And today, he got his due.</i>

512
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,480
To Jim Gordon.
May he rot in hell!

513
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,677
Yeah!

514
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,720
What exactly are you doing?

515
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,350
I'm trying to keep this city
from ripping itself apart.

516
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,437
So this has nothing to do
with your feelings for Jim?

517
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,150
What if Ed fails,
and we are stuck here?

518
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,957
<i>This will put us in
Gordon's good graces.</i>

519
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,993
Consider it a backup plan.

520
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,190
<i>Listen up!</i>

521
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,269
Now to the real reason
I brought you all here.

522
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,679
<i>I want you</i>

523
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,559
to agree to an immediate truce.

524
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,552
Get out of here.

525
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,270
And what if, instead,
we shoot you and take your club?

526
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,920
I don't think so.

527
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,159
See, those drinks
I just gave you...

528
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,840
they're poisoned.

529
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,597
<i>And you had two shots
before everyone got here.</i>

530
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,117
So that should be taking effect
around...

531
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,593
...now.

532
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,395
The rest of you have 48 hours
before you'll need

533
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,552
<i>the antidote, which
I will deliver to you,</i>

534
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,757
<i>provided you go back
to your territories,</i>

535
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,992
play nice,
and send me all your guns. Deal?

536
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,560
I said, "Deal?"

537
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,120
- Now get out of here!
<i>- All right.</i>

538
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,197
- Yeah. Out.
- Come on.

539
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,040
Hmm.

540
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,637
Jim will be so pleased.

541
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,517
Keep your friends close,
and your enemies closer.

542
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,391
Isn't that right... Pengy?

543
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,799
Once I reverse the system,

544
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,475
all the toxin we pulled from
the river will be rereleased,

545
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,597
and the overload should
destroy the filters.

546
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,474
In a matter of minutes,

547
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,474
the entire facility
will be inoperable.

548
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,639
There.

549
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,871
Perfect.

550
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,111
Ivy's gonna be so happy.

551
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,636
You think so?

552
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,550
<i>Security breach. Zone 1.</i>

553
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,470
That's odd.

554
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,470
Selina.

555
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,790
I'll take care of it.

556
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,356
Okay.

557
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,679
All right, listen up!

558
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,756
I know you're probably familiar
with Ivy Pepper.

559
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,136
In fact, you were probably here

560
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,278
when she hypnotized the whole
frigging precinct, okay?

561
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,840
She is on the loose,

562
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,430
and we've got to find her
and take her down.

563
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,835
Actually, fellas,

564
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,390
she's already here!

565
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,560
That's right.
Ivy came and freed me.

566
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,871
That is true love for you.

567
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,559
She really understands
what makes me tick.

568
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,080
Don't worry, though.

569
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,469
I'm just a distraction

570
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,360
so she can finish off Jim
once and for all.

571
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,438
You know,
that's how great couples work.

572
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,800
Maybe I shouldn't have
told you that.

573
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,270
Oh, well.

574
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,278
- I'm sorry, Miss Thompkins.
- I know. Go.

575
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,675
Thank you, Alfred.

576
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,036
Come on, Jim.

577
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,636
Can you hear me?

578
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,076
Stay with me.

579
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,989
Stay with me, Jim.

580
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,919
Jim!

581
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,037
Want a drink?

582
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,431
Alvarez makes
a hell of a Mai Tai.

583
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,594
I can barely feel my face.

584
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,480
Harvey, what is this?

585
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,360
It's your wake.

586
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,240
Pretty nice turn-out, huh?

587
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,550
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

588
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,376

592
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,874
Wake?

593
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,555
I'm not dead yet.

594
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,952
Well, be a little bit
of a bummer

595
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,192
to have it after you died,
don't you think?

596
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,959
I'm gonna have a kid, Harvey.

597
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,199
How do I protect that child
when everything around me dies?

598
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,240
<i>Harvey?</i>

599
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,359
<i>That's
a good question.</i>

600
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,116
Will.

601
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,877
You said I'd be
safe in Haven.

602
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,596
I trusted you.

603
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,196
<i>I know.</i>

604
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,915
I did my best.

605
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,391
Your best never seems
good enough.

606
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,474
It's time to go.

607
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,856
<i>No, no, no.</i>

608
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,760
No, no, no, no. Jim.

609
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,856
Where's my adrenaline?

610
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,234
Oh...

611
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,589
Oh, looks like
Victor succeeded after all.

612
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,037
I guess I'll have
to settle for killing you.

613
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,919
I can tell you one thing.

614
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,992
I am sick and tired of getting
shot at in my own precinct.

615
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,873
Hey, what the bloody
hell's going on?

616
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,576
I thought you had this
lunatic locked up.

617
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,432
Ivy broke him out
and gave him an arsenal.

618
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,360
But I have an idea. I got to get
to the storeroom. Give me cover.

619
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,920
Alvarez, go!

620
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,040
Why are you doing this?

621
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,959
What has Jim ever done to you?

622
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,831
Gotham has a chance
to be born anew.

623
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,079
To return to
what it was

624
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,836
before people ripped down the
trees and paved over the earth.

625
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,680
He's trying to reunify
with the mainland

626
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,910
to save all these people.

627
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,275
A return to filth.

628
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,440
Pollution.

629
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,156
He's fighting for
death, while I...

630
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,950
promise life...

631
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,000
in its purest form.

632
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,360
Is that your plan?

633
00:33:00,361 --> 00:33:02,477
To have the plants take over
Gotham by killing Jim?

634
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,998
Oh, killing Gordon's
just the first part.

635
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,629
Bruce Wayne is taking
care of the rest.

636
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,714
- For what it's worth, I am sorry.
- For what?

637
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,434
This pain is nothing

638
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,350
compared to what you
are about to feel.

639
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,637
Say good-bye...
to Jim Gordon for me.

640
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,639
No!

641
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,835
<i>No, no, no,
no, no!</i>

642
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,400
No!

643
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,556
Jim.

644
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,840
Selina, you're wasting

645
00:33:40,841 --> 00:33:41,719
your time.

646
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,518
Bruce, you have
to snap out of Ivy's spell.

647
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,353
- This is not you.
- You're wrong.

648
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,795
Ivy's given me a purpose.

649
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,995
Stop! Stop! I don't
want to fight you!

650
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,200
What are you gonna do?
Kill everything in Gotham?

651
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,233
The toxins will only kill
all the people.

652
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,240
The plants will adapt;
they always do.

653
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,472
- Can you hear what that sounds like?
- Yeah.

654
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,040
It sounds great!

655
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,437
I guess I shouldn't
be surprised.

656
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,071
You don't care about Gotham.
You're gonna leave anyway.

657
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,560
What about the
rest of us, huh?

658
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,076
The ones who
are gonna be

659
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,594
stuck here without you?!

660
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,960
Selina...

661
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,473
<i>Selina...
I'm okay.</i>

662
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,597
- Bruce, I'm so sorry.
- We got to stop Lucius.

663
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,240
- Come on.
- Okay.

664
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,790
Lucius! You have
to stop the shutdown.

665
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,873
Oh, no, I can't do that.

666
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,713
Ivy will be so mad.

667
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,918
Listen to me, I-I used
Ivy's perfume to hypnotize you.

668
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,160
She's using you.

669
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,835
No.

670
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,553
Ivy would never do that.

671
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,397
We're perfectly bonded,
like... carbon and oxygen

672
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,560
or hydrogen

673
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,280
<i>- and oxygen...</i>
- We do not have time for this.

674
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
I'm sorry.

675
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,639
There.

676
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,240
Oh, you kicked me
in the head.

677
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,993
I didn't have
a choice, Lucius.

678
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,720
Bruce, where's Ivy?

679
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,399
She was headed to the GCPD.

680
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,038
I wonder what Ivy's doing
right now.

681
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,679
<i>Hey, lover boy.</i>

682
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,354
Are you serious right now?

683
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,874
As a heart attack.

684
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,960
What an idiot.

685
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,080
Oh, my...

686
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,869
Ah, that felt good.

687
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,270
Come on, Jim.

688
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,280
You fight for everyone else.
You never give up.

689
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,079
Fight for yourself, Jim.
Come on!

690
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,995
It's time.

691
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
<i>Jim.</i>

692
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,320
<i>Lee.</i>

693
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,520
<i>Is that...?</i>

694
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,070
Yes.

695
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,993
Do you want to...?

696
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,310
I don't know.

697
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,920
I don't know that I can.

698
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,236
Oh, I see.

699
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,039
- No!
- Good-bye, Jim.

700
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,600
<i>No!</i>

701
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:20,080
I want to live!

702
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,596
<i>I want to live!</i>

703
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,029
It's too late.

704
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,674
No! I want to live!

705
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,592
Lee.

706
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,798
Don't move.
Don't move.

707
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,035
How do you feel?

708
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,959
Like I almost died.

709
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,589
Well, you didn't.

710
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,113
You fought.
You came back to me.

711
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,634
Because I need you.

712
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,160
<i>Lee...</i>

713
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,638
- this child...
- It's okay.

714
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,473
It's okay to be scared.

715
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,240
The only thing scarier
than doing this

716
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,078
is doing it without you.

717
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,193
Can I ask you something?

718
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,274
He seems nervous.

719
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,516
I know.

720
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,280
He should be thrilled.

721
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,673
Marrying a woman who's smarter
<i>and</i> better-looking than him.

722
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,112
Selina, while we
were fighting,

723
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,296
when I was hypnotized,
you talked about me leaving...

724
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,320
Quiet.

725
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,269
Here she comes.

726
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,160
You may sit.

727
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,576
<i>I'm just gonna say,</i>

728
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,800
this isn't gonna be some
long, drawn-out, tearful affair

729
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,176
like you all are used to, okay?

730
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,456
This is gonna be
a short wedding.

731
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,040
I'm gonna try and make it quick
so we can all get to the bar.

732
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,277
<i>Okay?</i>

733
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,072
<i>I first met a young Jim Gordon</i>

734
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,439
when he was a, uh...

735
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,512
pain-in-the-ass, moralistic

736
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,751
<i>rookie detective.</i>

737
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,637
In the years since, he's evolved
into a pain-in-the-ass,

738
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,393
moralistic captain.

739
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,354
<i>I'd say he's my best friend,</i>

740
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,513
but in truth,
he's my <i>only</i> friend.

741
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,553
So we'll skip that.

742
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,191
Uh, on to Lee.

743
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,878
<i>Lee's always had his back.</i>

744
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,198
Except for the time
when she was infected

745
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,558
with the crazy-making virus
and she tried to kill him,

746
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,836
<i>but that's love.</i>

747
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,554
<i>But I will say,</i>

748
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,111
if there's one beautiful thing
that's happened

749
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,313
<i>over these last few crazy years,</i>

750
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,837
it's that these two people
met each other.

751
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,800
<i>And that truly is...</i>

752
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,954
<i>a beautiful thing.</i>

753
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,872
Jim, will you please
take Lee's hand?

754
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,516
<i>Do you, Jim Gordon,
take Lee Thompkins to be</i>

755
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,474
<i>your lawfully wedded wife,</i>

756
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,199
to have and to hold,

757
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,194
from this day forward,

758
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,160
<i>for better, for worse,</i>

759
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,592
<i>for richer, for poorer,</i>

760
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,070
in sickness and in health,

761
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,160
to love and cherish

762
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,034
<i>till death do you part?</i>

763
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,309
I do.

764
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,837
And you, Lee Thompkins,
do you do the same?

765
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,475
Sure, Harvey.

766
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,835
I do.

767
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,592
By the power vested in me...

768
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,756
by absolutely no one...

769
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,839
...I now pronounce you

770
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,075
husband and wife.

771
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,236
What?

772
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,910
And now Jim Gordon
and Lee Thompkins

773
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,589
are man and wife.

774
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,751
<i>Thank God you held the
city together so that</i>

775
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,515
this blessed event
could take place.

776
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,794
<i>It was never
gonna work.</i>

777
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,719
What?

778
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,440
<i>Controlling the gangs
was not a backup plan.</i>

779
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,157
You... saw a chance

780
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,199
to convince James Gordon
that you had changed.

781
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,437
But he will never see you

782
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,115
<i>as anything but
a dangerous woman</i>

783
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,112
<i>keeping his
child from him.</i>

784
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,360
Then I'd best be long gone

785
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,591
before he
can do anything about it.

786
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,358
He will hunt you
till the ends of the earth.

787
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,596
Let him.
