It could have been a burglary.

in South America.

171

Speaking of friends, how's Hollis Mason?

180

about the Comedian in it.

Good evening, Rorschach.

321

RORSCHACH:
Dr. Manhattan, you know why I'm here.

322

JON:
Yes...

...but you're going to leave disappointed.

324

Rorschach. You shouldn't be here.
You're a wanted man.

RORSCHACH:
Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.

JON:
The Comedian is dead.

331
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,901
Rorschach wants me
to look into my future...

332
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,695
...see if the killer is ever
publicly identified.

333
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,990
Already warned Dreiberg.
Came to warn you too.

Even if I wanted to help...

335
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:58,542
...my future is blocked
by some kind of temporal interference.

336

- I cannot see it clearly.
- Interference? Caused by what?

337

In all likelihood, nuclear holocaust.

If the United States and Soviet Union
engage in all-out war...

339
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:15,600
...the resulting blast wave would produce
a sudden burst of tachyons...

340
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:20,730
...particles which travel backward
through what you perceive as time...

341
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:24,693
...therefore obscuring my vision
of the present.

342

I must return to my work.

343

RORSCHACH:
Wait a minute.

someone wants us out of the way?

345

Goodbye, Rorschach.

If that's true,
then how can you change the future?

Yeah, he tried that on me once.

dropped him down an elevator shaft.

03:22:54,454 --> 03:22:57,082
Nothing ever ends.

2322
03:23:44,421 --> 03:23:48,174
Seymour, we got nothing
to write about anymore.

2323
03:23:48,341 --> 03:23:49,718
Everyone in the country...

2324
03:23:49,884 --> 03:23:52,137
...every country in the world
are holding hands...

2325
03:23:52,303 --> 03:23:55,598
...and singing songs
about peace and love.

2326
03:23:56,099 --> 03:23:58,977
It's like living in a goddamn
global hippie commune.

2327
03:23:59,144 --> 03:24:03,064
Well, Ronald Reagan says he's gonna
be running for president in '88.

2328
03:24:03,231 --> 03:24:05,066
We could run a piece on that.

2329
03:24:05,233 --> 03:24:08,403
Seymour, we don't dignify absurdities
with coverage.

2330
03:24:08,570 --> 03:24:12,407
This is still America, damn it.
Who wants a cowboy in the White House?

2331
03:24:13,158 --> 03:24:17,370
Okay. I could look for something
in the crank file.

2332
03:24:17,537 --> 03:24:19,164
Crank file.

2333
03:24:19,330 --> 03:24:21,332
Whatever. Take some initiative.

2334
03:24:21,499 --> 03:24:24,127
Run whatever you like.
I leave it entirely in your hands.

2335
03:24:30,633 --> 03:24:35,346
<i>Rorschach's journal, October 12th, 1985.</i>

2336
03:24:35,513 --> 03:24:39,976
<i>Tonight, a comedian died in New York.</i>

2337
