1
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,240
(Gulls cawing)

2
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,920
Your pardon, Your Grace.

3
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,160
l would rise, but...

4
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,160
(Cersei)
Do you know what your wife has done?

5
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,480
- She did nothing l did not command.
- Who'd have thought she had it in her?

6
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,120
By what right dare you lay hands
on my blood?

7
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,960
- l am the King's Hand...
- You were the King's Hand!

8
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,800
You shall now be held accountable.

9
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:41,760
Oh, will both of you shut your mouths?

10
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,240
Catelyn will release Tyrion
and you'll make your peace with Jaime.

11
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,440
He butchered my men.

12
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,320
Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel
when his men attacked Jaime.

13
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,760
- Quiet, woman.
- Jaime has fled the city.

14
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,480
Give me leave to bring him back to justice.

15
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,200
l took you for a king.

16
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,600
Hold your tongue.

17
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,560
He's attacked one of my brothers
and abducted the other.

18
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,840
l should wear the armour
and you the gown.

19
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,320
l shall wear this like a badge of honour.

20
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,440
Wear it in silence or l'll honour you again.

21
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,520
(Door slams)

22
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,040
See what she does to me?

23
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,880
My loving wife.

24
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,680
l should not have hit her.

25
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,640
That was not...

26
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,840
That was not kingly.

27
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,040
lf we don't act...

28
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,360
there will be a war.

29
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:12,440
So tell your wife to return
that little shit of an Imp to King's Landing.

30
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,000
She's had her fun, now put an end to it.

31
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,200
You hear me?
Send a raven and put an end to it.

32
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,840
And what about Jaime Lannister?

33
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,560
What about Jaime?

34
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,320
l'm half a kingdom in debt
to his bloody father.

35
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:33,080
l don't know what happened
between you and those yellow-haired shits.

36
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,760
l don't want to know.
This is what matters -

37
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:39,320
l can't rule the Kingdoms
if the Starks and the Lannisters

38
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,800
are at each other's throats, so enough.

39
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,040
As you command, Your Grace.

40
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,720
With your leave...

41
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,400
l will return to Winterfell
and set matters straight.

42
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:55,880
Piss on that. Send a raven.
l want you to stay.

43
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,200
l'm the king. l get what l want.

44
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,880
l never loved my brothers.

45
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,240
A sad thing for a man to admit, but it's true.

46
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,880
You were the brother l chose.

47
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,360
We'll talk when l return from the hunt.

48
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,160
The hunt?

49
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:31,520
Killing things clears my head.

50
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:34,760
You'll have to sit on the throne
while l'm away. (Chuckles)

51
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,760
You'll hate it more than l do.

52
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,480
- The Targaryen girl...
- Seven hells!

53
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,360
Don't start with her again!

54
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,720
The girl will die and l'll hear no more of it.

55
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:47,680
Put on the badge.
And if you ever take it om again,

56
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,560
l swear to the mother l'll pin the damned thing
on Jaime Lannister.

57
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,480
(Door slams)

58
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,520
(Horse whinnies, distant)

59
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:11,680
Khaleesi?

60
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,880
Oh, Khaleesi!

61
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,280
You're hurt.

62
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,600
(Raven caws)

63
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:36,400
(Caws)

64
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,880
(Caws)

65
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,480
(Pounding footsteps, door slams)

66
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,000
(Bran whooping joyously)

67
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,920
- Not too fast.
- Come on, Dancer.

68
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,720
When are you gonna tell him?

69
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,800
Not now.

70
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,480
- Blood for blood.
- (Bran) Come on!

71
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,080
You need to make the Lannisters pay
for Jory and the others.

72
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,560
- (Robb) You're talking about war.
- l'm talking about justice.

73
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,240
Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in
the bannermen and raise an army.

74
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,960
A Lannister put his spear
through your father's leg.

75
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,360
The Kingslayer rides for Casterly Rock
where no one can touch him...

76
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,280
You want me to march on Casterly Rock?

77
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,440
- You're not a boy anymore.
- (Bran) Come on.

78
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,320
They attacked your father.
They've already started the war.

79
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,400
lt's your duty to represent your House
when your father can't.

80
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,760
And it's not your duty,
because it's not your House.

81
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,240
(Birds chirping)

82
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,040
Where's Bran?

83
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,600
l don't know.

84
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,480
lt's not my House.

85
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,560
(Horse nickering)

86
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,520
(Whinnies)

87
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:46,600
Robb?

88
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,240
All alone in the deep, dark woods.

89
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,200
l'm not alone.
My brother is with me.

90
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,840
l don't see him.

91
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,760
Got him hidden under your cloak?

92
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,960
Ooh, that's a pretty pin.

93
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,600
Silver.

94
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,560
We'll take the pin and the horse.
Get down.

95
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,560
Be quick about it.

96
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,920
l can't.

97
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,880
The saddle... The straps.

98
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,240
What's wrong with you?
You some kind of cripple?

99
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,960
l'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.

100
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,400
lf you don't let me be, l'll have you all killed!

101
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,240
Cut his little cock om
and stum it in his mouth.

102
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,840
The boy's worth nothing dead.

103
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,160
Benjen Stark's own blood?

104
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:33,320
Think what Mance would give us.

105
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,600
Piss on Mance Rayder
and piss on the North.

106
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,640
We're going as far south as south goes.

107
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,000
There ain't no white walkers down in Dorne.

108
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,520
(Robb) Drop the knife!

109
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,440
Let him go and l'll let you live.

110
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,000
(Hisses)

111
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,240
(Yells)

112
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,480
(Grunting)

113
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,240
Robb.

114
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,920
- Robb.
- Shut up.

115
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,320
Drop the blade!

116
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,280
- No, don't.
- Do it.

117
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,520
(Arrow thuds)

118
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,200
Are you all right?

119
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,640
Yes. It doesn't hurt.

120
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,040
Tough little lad.

121
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,680
ln the Iron Islands, you're not a man
until you've killed your first enemy.

122
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,800
Well done.

123
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,320
Have you lost your mind?

124
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,080
What if you'd missed?

125
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,520
He would have killed you
and cut Bran's throat.

126
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,960
- You don't have the right...
- To save your brother's life?

127
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,640
lt was the only thing to do, so l did it.

128
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:21,240
What about her?

129
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,720
(Gasping) Give me my life, my lord,
and l'm yours.

130
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,400
We'll keep her alive.

131
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,120
(Sigh of relief)

132
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:39,760
(Wind blowing)

133
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,000
Mord!

134
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
Turnkey! Mord!

135
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,440
Mord!

136
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,640
(Jangling)

137
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,120
Dwarf man making noise!

138
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,400
How would you like to be rich?

139
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,600
Dwarf man still making noise.

140
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:19,120
My family is rich.

141
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,000
We have gold, lots of gold.

142
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,200
l'm prepared to give you lots of gold in...

143
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,720
No gold!

144
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,720
Well, l don't have it here.

145
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,960
No gold! (Grunts)

146
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,640
Fuck om.

147
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,760
(Door slams)

148
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,680
l don't want to practice today.

149
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,280
No?

150
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,320
They killed Jory.

151
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,280
My father is hurt.

152
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,480
l don't care about stupid wooden swords.

153
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,360
You are troubled.

154
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,960
- Yes.
- Good!

155
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,200
Trouble is the perfect time for training.

156
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,400
When you are dancing in the meadow
with your dolls and kittens,

157
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,320
this is not when fighting happens.

158
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,400
l don't like dolls and k...

159
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,280
You're not here.

160
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,200
You're with your trouble.

161
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,040
lf you are with your trouble
when fighting happens...

162
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,680
(Gasps)

163
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,560
..more trouble for you.

164
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,600
(Tuts) Just so.

165
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,480
How can you be quick as a snake...

166
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,400
..or as quiet as a shadow...

167
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,520
..when you are somewhere else?

168
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:00,680
You are fearing for your father, hmm?

169
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,960
That is right.

170
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,040
- Do you pray to the gods?
- The old and the new.

171
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,520
There is only one god...

172
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,120
and his name is death.

173
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,960
And there is only one thing we say to death -

174
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,960
''Not today.''

175
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,240
(Dothraki chanting)

176
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,800
(Priestess chants)
(Dothraki chanting)

177
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,120
(Chanting continues)

178
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,320
She has to eat the whole heart?

179
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,040
l hope that wasn't my horse.

180
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,840
She's doing well.

181
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,880
She'll never keep it down.

182
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,880
(Chanting continues)

183
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:11,360
(Chanting intensifies)

184
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,200
(Chants in Dothraki)

185
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,040
Tell me what she's saying.

186
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:20,560
''The prince is riding.

187
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,440
''l have heard the thunder
of his hooves.

188
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:25,680
''Swift as the wind he rides.

189
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,920
''His enemies will cower before him...

190
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,600
''..and their wives will weep tears of blood.''

191
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,200
She's going to have a boy.

192
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:45,480
He won't be a real Targaryen.

193
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,680
He won't be a true dragon.

194
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,880
(Retches)

195
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,600
(Chanting stops)
(Daenerys sobs)

196
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:09,080
(Sobs)

197
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,040
(Gulps)

198
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:38,960
(Speaks Dothraki)

199
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,960
''The stallion who mounts the world.''

200
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:44,880
The stallion is the khal of khals.

201
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,960
He shall unite the people
into a single khalasar.

202
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,160
All the people of the world will be his herd.

203
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,320
(Speaks Dothraki)

204
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,440
A prince rides inside me!

205
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:03,240
And he shall be called Rhaego!

206
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:05,640
(Chanting) Rhaego! Rhaego!

207
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:07,760
Rhaego! Rhaego!

208
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,400
Rhaego! Rhaego...

209
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,760
They love her.

210
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,120
Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego! Rhaego...

211
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,640
(Chanting continues)

212
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,760
She truly is a queen today.

213
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,640
(Sighs)

214
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:15,280
Don't let them see you carrying a sword
in Vaes Dothrak.

215
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,360
You know the law.

216
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,320
lt's not my law.

217
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,200
They don't belong to you.

218
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:23,480
Whatever is hers is also mine.

219
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,080
Once, perhaps.

220
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:30,640
lf l sell one egg,
l'll have enough to buy a ship.

221
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,800
Two eggs - a ship and an army.

222
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,920
- And you have all three.
- l need a large army.

223
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,320
l'm the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont.

224
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:42,040
The greatest dynasty
this world has ever seen

225
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,520
on my shoulders
since l was five years old,

226
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:49,200
and no one has ever given me
what they gave to her in that tent. Never.

227
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:50,720
Not a piece of it.

228
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,640
How can l carry
what l need to carry without it? Hmm?

229
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,920
Who can rule without wealth or fear or love?

230
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,840
Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honour.

231
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,280
You don't think l see you
Iooking at my little sister, hmm?

232
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:14,640
Don't think l know what you want?

233
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,720
l don't care. You can have her.

234
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,840
She can be queen of the savages
and dine on the finest bloody horseparts,

235
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,400
and you can dine
on whichever parts of her you like.

236
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,080
But let me go.

237
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,520
You can go.

238
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,360
You can't have the eggs.

239
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,160
You swore an oath to me.

240
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,480
Does loyalty mean nothing to you?

241
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:41,600
lt means everything to me.

242
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,520
And yet here you stand.

243
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,560
And yet here l stand.

244
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,440
- (Wind roaring)
- Mord!

245
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,880
Mord!

246
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,680
Mord!

247
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:15,160
Mord!

248
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,880
Mord!

249
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:20,760
Noise again!

250
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,800
- About the gold...
- No gold!

251
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,240
- No gold.
- Listen to me! Listen to me.

252
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,280
Sometimes possession...

253
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,320
is an abstract concept...

254
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,440
(Groans)

255
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,640
When they captured me, they took my purse,
but the gold is still mine.

256
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,400
Where?

257
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:45,680
Where? l don't know where,
but when they free me...

258
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,000
You want free?

259
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:50,160
Go be free.

260
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,480
Have you ever heard the phrase...

261
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:55,320
''Rich as a Lannister''?

262
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,760
Of course you have!

263
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,640
You're a smart man.

264
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:05,400
You know who the Lannisters are.

265
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,120
l am a Lannister.

266
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,720
Tyrion, son of Tywin!

267
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:17,120
And of course,
you have also heard the phrase,

268
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,800
''a Lannister always pays his debts.''

269
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,640
lf you deliver a message from me...

270
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,280
to Lady Arryn, l will be in your debt.

271
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,240
l will owe you gold.

272
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,120
lf you deliver the message...

273
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:39,240
and l live,
which l very much intend to do.

274
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,480
What message?

275
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:52,680
Tell her l wish to confess my crimes.

276
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,240
(Metal tapping, courtiers murmuring)

277
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,480
You wish to confess your crimes?

278
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,960
Yes, my lady. l do, my lady.

279
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,840
The sky cells always break them.

280
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,080
Speak, Imp.

281
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,280
Meet your gods as an honest man.

282
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:20,360
Where do l begin, my lords and ladies?

283
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:25,400
l'm a vile man, l confess it.

284
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,440
My crimes and sins are beyond counting.

285
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,280
l have lied and cheated...

286
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,560
gambled and whored.

287
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,040
l'm not particularly good at violence, but...

288
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,800
l'm good at convincing others
to do violence for me.

289
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:45,960
You want specifics, l suppose.

290
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,720
When l was seven, l saw a servant girl...
bathing in the river.

291
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,600
l stole her robe.

292
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,720
She was forced to return to the castle
naked and in tears.

293
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,680
lf l close my eyes,
l can still see her tits bouncing.

294
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,040
(Gasps)

295
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,400
When l was 10,
l stumed my uncle's boots with goatshit.

296
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,960
When confronted with my crime,
l blamed a squire.

297
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:17,360
Poor boy was flogged and...
l escaped justice.

298
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:21,960
When l was 12 l milked my eel
into a pot of turtle stew.

299
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:24,800
- (Gasps)
- l flogged the one-eyed snake.

300
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,720
l skinned my sausage.

301
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,880
l made the bald man cry
into the turtle stew,

302
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,800
which l do believe my sister ate.

303
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,720
At least l hope she did.

304
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:38,920
l once brought a jackass
and a honeycomb into a brothel...

305
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,000
Silence!

306
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,560
What happened next?

307
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,560
What do you think you're doing?

308
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:47,360
Confessing my crimes.

309
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:53,280
Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man
to slay my son Bran in his bed,

310
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,960
and of conspiring to murder
my sister's husband -

311
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:59,640
Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.

312
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:01,840
Oh, l'm very sorry.

313
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,800
l don't know anything about all that.

314
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,120
You've had your little joke.

315
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:10,360
l trust you enjoyed it.

316
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,240
Mord, take him back to the dungeon.

317
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:16,560
But this time find a smaller cell...
with a steeper floor.

318
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,520
ls this how justice is done in the Vale?

319
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:24,600
You accuse me of crimes,

320
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,880
l deny them,

321
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,200
so you throw me into a cell
to freeze and starve?

322
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,320
Where is the king's justice?

323
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,520
l am accused and demand a trial!

324
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,120
(Courtiers murmuring)

325
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,400
lf you're tried and found guilty, then by the
king's own laws you will pay with your life.

326
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,840
l understand the law.

327
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,520
We have no executioner in the Eyrie.

328
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,680
Life is more elegant here.

329
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,080
Open the Moon Door.

330
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,040
(Wind howling)

331
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,320
(Robin giggling)

332
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,800
(Lysa) You want a trial, my Lord Lannister.

333
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,800
Very well.

334
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,280
My son will listen
to whatever you have to say,

335
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,040
and you will hear his judgment.

336
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,120
Then you will leave...

337
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,040
by one door or the other.

338
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,400
(Tyrion) No need to bother Lord Robin.

339
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,400
- l demand a trial by combat.
- (Laughter)

340
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,600
You have that right.

341
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:45,520
My lady, l beg the honour.

342
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,440
Let me be your champion.

343
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:49,760
The honour should be mine.

344
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,200
For the love l bore your lord husband...

345
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,840
let me avenge his death.

346
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,280
- l'll fight for you, my lady.
- It'll be my honour.

347
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,280
- The honour should be mine.
- Make the bad man fly!

348
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,360
Ser Vardis...

349
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,960
you're quiet.

350
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:07,080
Don't you want to avenge my husband?

351
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,640
With all my heart, my lady.

352
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:13,960
But the Imp is half my size.

353
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:17,280
lt would be shameful to slaughter such a man
and call it justice.

354
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,520
Agreed.

355
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,880
You demanded a trial by combat.

356
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,520
Now l demand a champion.
l have that right, same as you.

357
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,200
My lady,

358
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:29,120
l will gladly fight the Imp's champion for you.

359
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:32,240
l wouldn't be too glad, ser.

360
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,800
l name my brother, Jaime Lannister.

361
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,280
(Whispering)

362
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,800
The Kingslayer
is hundreds of miles from here.

363
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,280
Send a raven for him. l'm happy to wait.

364
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:44,200
The trial will be today.

365
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:49,520
Do l have a volunteer?

366
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,560
(Laughter)

367
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:58,920
- Anyone?
- (Giggling)

368
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,360
Anyone?

369
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:06,560
l think we can assume that no one is willing...

370
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,360
l'll stand for the dwarf.

371
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:21,480
(Lancel) More wine, Your Grace?

372
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,880
- What was l saying?
- (Renly) Simpler time.

373
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
lt was! It was.
You're too young to remember.

374
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,760
Wasn't it simpler, Selmy?

375
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,120
- It was, Your Grace.
- The enemy was right there in the open,

376
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,120
vicious as you like,
all but sending you a bloody invitation.

377
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,960
Nothing like today.

378
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:42,800
- It sounds exhilarating.
- Exhilarating, yes.

379
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:47,440
Not as exhilarating as those balls
and masquerades you like to throw.

380
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,480
(Laughing)

381
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:54,560
You ever fuck a Riverlands girl?

382
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,160
Once. l think.

383
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:59,800
You think? l think you'd remember.

384
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,680
Back in our day, you weren't a real man

385
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:05,680
until you'd fucked one girl
from each of the Seven Kingdoms

386
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:07,360
and the Riverlands.

387
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,520
- We used to call it ''making the eight.''
- Those were some lucky girls.

388
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,520
You ever make the eight, Barristan?

389
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,400
l don't believe so, Your Grace.

390
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,160
(Laughs) Those were the days.

391
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:17,960
Which days, exactly?

392
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:21,400
The ones where half of Westeros
fought the other half and millions died?

393
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,440
Or before that, when the Mad King
slaughtered women and babies

394
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,360
because the voices in his head
told him they deserved it?

395
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,680
Or way before that, when dragons burned
whole cities to the ground?

396
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,720
Easy, boy.

397
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:35,720
You might be my brother,
but you're speaking to the king.

398
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:37,240
l suppose it was all rather heroic.

399
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,960
lf you were drunk enough
and had some poor Riverlands whore

400
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:42,480
to shove your prick inside
and make the eight.

401
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,240
More wine, Your Grace?

402
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,840
(Man) They burned most everything
in the Riverlands -

403
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,360
our fields, our granaries,

404
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,800
our homes.

405
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,680
They took our women,
then they took 'em again.

406
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:21,960
When they was done, they butchered them
as if they was animals.

407
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:25,160
They covered our children in pitch...

408
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,640
and lit them on fire.

409
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,760
Brigands, most likely.

410
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,640
They weren't thieves.
They didn't steal nothing.

411
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:38,880
They even left something behind, Your Grace.

412
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,120
lt's the King's Hand you're addressing,
not the king.

413
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,000
The king is hunting.

414
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,080
(Squelches)

415
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,280
(Groans)

416
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:53,800
Fish. The sigil of House Tully.

417
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:58,440
(Whispers) Isn't that your wife's House - Tully -
my Lord Hand?

418
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,240
These men, were they flying a sigil?

419
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:10,920
- A banner?
- None, your... Hand.

420
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:13,320
The one who was leading them...

421
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,720
Taller by a foot
than any man l've ever met,

422
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:19,920
saw him cut the blacksmith in two,

423
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:24,680
saw him take the head om a horse
with a single swing of his sword.

424
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,160
That sounds like someone we know.

425
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,200
The Mountain.

426
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:32,240
You're describing Ser Gregor Clegane.

427
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:35,040
Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand?

428
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,160
The man is an anointed knight.

429
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,200
l've heard him called
Tywin Lannister's mad dog.

430
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:42,360
l'm sure you have as well.

431
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,080
(Hushed) Can you think of any reason
the Lannisters might possibly have

432
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,760
for being angry with your wife?

433
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:54,640
lf the Lannisters were to order attacks
on villages under the king's protection,

434
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:57,320
- it would be...
- That would be almost as brazen

435
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,400
as attacking the Hand of the King
in the streets of the capital.

436
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,040
Well...

437
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,240
l cannot give you back your homes
or restore your dead to life,

438
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:15,760
but perhaps l can give you justice
in the name of our king, Robert.

439
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,920
Lord Beric Dondarrion.

440
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,840
You shall have the command.

441
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,080
Assemble 100 men
and ride to Ser Gregor's keep.

442
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,920
As you command.

443
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:39,800
ln the name of Robert of the House Baratheon,
the First of his Name,

444
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,720
King of the Andals and the First Men,

445
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:45,920
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm,

446
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:49,880
l charge you to bring the king's justice
to the false knight Gregor Clegane

447
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,240
and all those who shared in his crimes.

448
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:54,920
l denounce him and attaint him.

449
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,040
(Murmuring)

450
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:59,320
l strip him of all ranks and titles...

451
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,320
of all lands and holdings...

452
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,480
and sentence him to death.

453
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:08,840
My lord...
This... This is a drastic action.

454
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,560
lt would be better to wait
for King Robert's return.

455
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,960
- Grand Maester Pycelle.
- My lord.

456
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:16,240
Send a raven to Casterly Rock.

457
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:19,520
lnform Tywin Lannister
that he has been summoned to court

458
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,560
to answer for the crimes of his bannermen.

459
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,560
He will arrive within the fortnight,
or be branded an enemy of the Crown

460
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,520
and a traitor to the realm.

461
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,480
(Softly) A bold move, my lord, and admirable.

462
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,880
But is it wise to yank the lion's tail?

463
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,280
Tywin Lannister is the richest man
in all the Seven Kingdoms.

464
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:54,160
Gold wins wars, not soldiers.

465
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:58,280
Then how come Robert is king
and not Tywin Lannister?

466
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,960
(Clanking)

467
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,720
(Wind howling)

468
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,280
Fight!

469
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,280
- (Crowd shouting)
- (Man) Hold!

470
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,520
- Attack! Attack!
- Come on, Ser Vardis!

471
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,080
- Attack!
- (Roaring)

472
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:43,760
(Lysa) Stand and fight, coward!

473
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,960
(Giggling)

474
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:44,240
- (Gasps)
- Yes!

475
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:49,760
- (Panting)
- Enough, Ser Vardis! Finish him.

476
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,160
(Yells)

477
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,240
(Woman) What are you doing? Get up!

478
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,120
Get up, get up, get up!

479
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,200
Raise your sword. Raise it!

480
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,560
(Roars)

481
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,040
Get up, man!

482
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:26,080
- On your feet!
- Get up! Get up and fight, Ser Vardis!

483
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,560
(Crowd shouting)

484
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:42,160
(Woman) No! Have mercy!

485
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,560
(Groans and gasps)

486
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,920
ls it over?

487
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,720
You don't fight with honour!

488
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:18,760
No.

489
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,600
He did.

490
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,280
(Crowd muttering)

491
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:37,760
Can l make the little man fly now?

492
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,720
Not this little man.

493
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,960
This little man is going home.

494
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,840
l believe you have something of mine.

495
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,200
(Coins jingle)

496
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,720
A Lannister always pays his debts.

497
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,560
You wear your hair like
a real southern lady now.

498
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,600
Well, why shouldn't l?
We're in the South.

499
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:34,840
lt's important to remember
where you come from.

500
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,040
l'm not sure your mother
would like these new styles.

501
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:40,440
My mother isn't from the North.

502
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,600
l'm aware of that.

503
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:47,120
Why do you care?
Do you even have hair under there?

504
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:50,320
Yes. l have hair.

505
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,000
l've never seen it.

506
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:54,240
Would you like to?

507
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,120
No.

508
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,440
Where are you from anyway?
The North or the South?

509
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,000
- l come from a very small village in...
- Oh, wait.

510
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:08,360
l just realized... l don't care.

511
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:10,600
- Sansa...
- Septa.

512
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:13,800
- (Door closes)
- Now you are being rude.

513
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,880
(Septa) My prince.

514
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:25,440
My prince.

515
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:27,040
My lady.

516
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,920
l fear l have behaved monstrously
the past few weeks.

517
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,200
With your permission?

518
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:50,880
lt's beautiful,

519
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,720
like the one your mother wears.

520
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,720
You'll be queen someday.

521
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,320
lt's only fitting you should look the part.

522
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,400
Will you forgive me for my rudeness?

523
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,080
There's nothing to forgive.

524
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:11,360
You're my lady.

525
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,360
One day we'll be married
in the throne room.

526
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,240
Lords and ladies from all over
the Seven Kingdoms will come,

527
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,440
from the last hearth in the North

528
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,280
to the salt shore in the South.

529
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,360
And you will be queen over all of them.

530
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,840
l'll never disrespect you again.

531
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,920
l'll never be cruel to you again.

532
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,120
Do you understand me?

533
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,520
You're my lady now...

534
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,280
from this day...

535
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:48,120
until my last day.

536
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:11,800
Stop.

537
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,760
- Stop!
- Whoa.

538
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,600
- What are you doing?
- Going to King's Landing.

539
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:19,680
ln a turnip cart?

540
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,480
l'll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.

541
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:25,280
And you can amord that?

542
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,960
Some of my friends
are more generous than others.

543
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,520
There's a thousand girls like you
in King's Landing.

544
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:32,720
So l'll have lots of company.

545
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,400
Yes, you'll be very popular...

546
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:37,920
until some fat lord comes to visit
with a big belly and a little prick

547
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:40,800
and he can't get it up
so he knocks all your teeth out.

548
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,040
And what will happen to me if l stay here?

549
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:46,960
Will l become Lady Greyjoy,
Mistress of the Iron Islands?

550
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:48,040
Don't be a fool.

551
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,840
l hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark
in the streets of King's Landing.

552
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:55,520
Every man for a hundred miles
will be marching om to war soon

553
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,400
and most of them will never come back.

554
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:59,320
There's nothing left for me here.

555
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:02,560
Let's go, Stemon.

556
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:04,000
Giddy up.

557
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:06,200
Let me see it one more time!

558
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,400
See what?

559
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,920
(Coin clinks)

560
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,720
(Laughs)

561
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,440
l'm going to miss you!

562
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:23,160
l know.

563
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,400
l'm sending you both back to Winterfell.

564
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:39,800
- What?
- Listen...

565
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,680
- What about Joffrey?
- Are you dying because of your leg?

566
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,560
- Is that why you're sending us home?
- What? No.

567
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:46,880
- Please, Father. Please don't.
- You can't.

568
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,760
l've got my lessons with Syrio.
l'm finally getting good.

569
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:54,440
This isn't a punishment. l want you back
in Winterfell for your own safety.

570
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:55,880
Can we take Syrio back with us?

571
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,880
Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher?
l can't go.

572
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,800
l'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey.
l love him and l'm meant to be his queen

573
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,840
- and have his babies.
- Seven hells.

574
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,080
When you're old enough, l'll make you a match
with someone who's worthy of you,

575
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:11,720
someone who's brave
and gentle and strong...

576
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,880
l don't want someone brave
and gentle and strong. l want him!

577
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,600
He'll be the greatest king that ever was,
a golden lion,

578
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:20,360
and l'll give him sons
with beautiful blond hair.

579
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,840
(Arya) The lion's not his sigil, idiot.

580
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,600
He's a stag, like his father.

581
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:27,320
He is not.
He's nothing like that old drunk king.

582
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:33,160
Go on, girls.
Get your septa and start packing your things.

583
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,560
- Wait!
- Come on.

584
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:36,200
But it's not fair!

585
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,800
(Door slams)

586
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,080
''Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair.''

587
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,760
''Axel Baratheon, black of hair.''

588
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:20,520
''Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair.''

589
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,480
''Stemon Baratheon, black of hair.''

590
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,200
''Robert Baratheon, black of hair.''

591
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:36,240
''Joffrey Baratheon...

592
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,320
''golden-haired.''

593
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:53,560
(Drums playing, laughter)

594
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,480
Daenerys!

595
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,480
(Drunkenly) Where's my sister?

596
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:16,800
Stop him.

597
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,000
(High-pitched) Where is she? Hmm?

598
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:25,200
Where is she?
l'm here for the feast.

599
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,720
The whore's feast?

600
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,200
- Come.
- Get your hands om me!

601
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,520
No one touches the dragon!

602
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,480
(Speaks Dothraki)

603
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,120
(Speaks Dothraki)
(Laughing)

604
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,000
Khal Drogo!

605
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,360
l'm here for the feast.

606
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:50,000
(Speaks Dothraki)

607
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:52,360
Khal Drogo says there is a place for you.

608
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,440
Back there.

609
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,760
That is no place for a king.

610
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,360
You are no king.

611
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,640
- Keep away from me!
- (Drumming stops)

612
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,600
Viserys, please.

613
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:09,560
(Dothraki hissing)

614
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:11,360
There she is.

615
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,360
Put the sword down. They'll kill us all.

616
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,840
They can't kill us. (Chuckles)

617
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,720
They can't shed blood in their sacred city.

618
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,000
(Gasps)

619
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:32,880
But l can.

620
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,600
l want what l came for.

621
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,840
l want the crown he promised me.

622
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,600
- He bought you.
- (lrri translating)

623
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:51,640
But he never paid for you.

624
00:46:56,679 --> 00:47:00,600
Tell him l want what was bargained for
or l'm taking you back.

625
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:03,160
He can keep the baby.

626
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:05,360
l'll cut it out and leave it for him.

627
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,600
(Speaks Dothraki)

628
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:16,280
(Speaks Dothraki)

629
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,120
What's he saying?

630
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:24,160
He says yes.

631
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:28,320
You shall have a golden crown...

632
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,400
..that men shall tremble to behold.

633
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:45,200
That was all l wanted.

634
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:49,440
W-What was promised.

635
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,000
(Chuckles)

636
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:07,160
(Speaks Dothraki)

637
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,440
- (Bone cracks)
- (Screams) No!

638
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,000
No! You cannot touch me.

639
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:15,280
l am the dragon.
l am the dragon!

640
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,000
l want my crown! Ahh!

641
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:20,960
(Viserys screams)
(Speaks Dothraki)

642
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:31,880
- Look away, Khaleesi.
- No.

643
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,880
(Viserys) No, Dany.

644
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,200
Dany, tell them.

645
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,680
Make them!

646
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,280
Dany, make them...

647
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,920
No, you can't!
