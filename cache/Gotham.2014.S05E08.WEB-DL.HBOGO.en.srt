1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,480
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,480
Alfred! The manor...

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,560
It's my fault.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,880
Mr. Cobblepot.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,280
Penn!

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,600
This never would have happened
if you had stayed with me.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,880
You're having a baby with Barbara.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,400
- Don't think I'm fit to be a mother?
- What do you think?

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,000
You're leaving Gotham.

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,960
I believe the time has come
for a change of scenery.

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,400
- You found a way out of Gotham?
- It's a submarine.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,040
Reunification with the mainland
hangs on by a thread.

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,640
Toxic chemicals
rain down onto the city,

14
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,120
and the government cuts us
adrift for good.

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,200
Gotham's golden rule.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,760
- No heroes.
- No heroes.

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,920
Watch out for him.

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,560
He thinks he's a white knight.

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,600
He's a loose cannon.

20
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,120
You two here to pick up
your grandchildren?

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,440
Come on, Babs.

22
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,360
You got the only full bar in Gotham.

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,880
And if you two dinosaurs
wanna keep coming here,

24
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,320
you better up your intel.

25
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,320
We got a lead on some black market
heating oil.

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,160
One drink. To share.

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,360
Then you go wheeze to death
somewhere else.

28
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,440
Would you look at that?

29
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,960
Dix!

30
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Look at you, up and walking around,
you old son of a bitch.

31
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,160
I've been looking for you two
for a while now.

32
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,240
Well, you found us.

33
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,880
You two ever think about the past?

34
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,880
What we did?

35
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,240
What're you talking about, Dix?

36
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,600
About her?

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,440
About what we did to the girl?

38
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,000
Who is that?
It is like The Living Dead in here.

39
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,080
Enough of this.

40
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,680
Hey, Gramps.

41
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,800
Oh. What...

42
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,160
{\an5}Can you please repeat your story
for Mr. Wayne, madam?

43
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,320
{\an5}We live in the shelter on West End.

44
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,440
{\an5}There're so many of us
crammed in there.

45
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,000
{\an5}So much uncertainty. Fear.

46
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,760
And with the river poisoned,
it should've been awful,

47
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,880
but people came together.

48
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,680
Made it a home.

49
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,240
{\an5}- What happened?
- Couple of weeks ago,

50
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,320
{\an5}we heard rumors about something
underneath the building,

51
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,640
{\an5}where it connects to the sewer.

52
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,240
{\an5}And people started going missing.

53
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,440
Hank, my husband,...

54
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,280
wanted to look for them.

55
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,600
{\an5}Said we were a family.

56
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,280
{\an5}So the two of you went
searching for them?

57
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
{\an5}It was so dark.

58
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,520
{\an5}I didn't see what attacked us.

59
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,640
I hit my head, and when I woke up,
Hank was gone.

60
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,760
Please, Mr. Wayne.

61
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
{\an5}We have a daughter.

62
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,160
{\an5}We'll do everything we can.

63
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
{\an5}Should we tell Gordon?

64
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,400
{\an5}Well, he's stretched thin as it is.

65
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,760
{\an5}Alfred, we don't know who,
or what, is down there.

66
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,400
{\an5}We know there's a man down there,
in danger.

67
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,680
{\an5}And we know this lady sent for us.

68
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,320
{\an5}So go on then,
what do you think we should do?

69
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,560
{\an5}Let's go find him.

70
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,200
Under normal circumstances,

71
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,640
I wouldn't call you
for a couple of stiffs.

72
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,200
What do you normally do when a couple
of your patrons get stabbed?

73
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,280
Bury the bodies.

74
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,080
Find out who did it,
and then bury those bodies.

75
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,200
See that's not something
you should be telling a cop.

76
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,960
We're living in a different world,
Harvey.

77
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,280
- So why did you call us?
- Take a look.

78
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,760
Boggs and Lewis.

79
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,440
You know them?

80
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,840
They were cops.
They were gone before you joined.

81
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,360
- What happened?
- They came around,

82
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,640
peddling third-rate intel.

83
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,000
It was closing time so I let them in.

84
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,400
And then some other fossil
knifed them.

85
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,160
- You saw him?
- Yeah, he must've snuck in.

86
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,320
Looked like a cop, too.
These two knew him.

87
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,960
Bartender said they called him
Micks? Hicks?

88
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,440
- Dix?
- Maybe.

89
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
No way.

90
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,640
- Dix was Harvey's old partner.
- Well, there we go. Case closed.

91
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,520
So you're telling me this guy
rolled in here in a wheelchair,

92
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
stabbed these two, and rolled on out?

93
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,960
- He wasn't in a wheelchair.
- Then, it couldn't be Dix.

94
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,920
He's been paralyzed
for the last 15 years.

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Harvey, you're confusing me
with someone who cares.

96
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,360
I called you as a courtesy
and now I'm wishing

97
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,440
I just dumped these
two corpses in an alley.

98
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,280
Do we even know if Dix is still in
Gotham after the bridges blew?

99
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,600
Heard he moved into an apartment
about a year ago.

100
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,480
I meant to check up on him,
but it can't be him.

101
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,560
I hear what you're saying,
but we should still talk to him.

102
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,640
And maybe he knows something.

103
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Fine.

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,880
- How are you feeling?
- I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

105
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,800
Look, I've been giving you space,

106
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,400
but we have to talk about
how this is gonna work.

107
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,760
I'm gonna be a part
of this kid's life.

108
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,680
Oh, you seem pretty confident
about that.

109
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,040
I am.

110
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,680
Reunification is gonna happen.

111
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,960
You should think about what kinda
person you wanna be when it does.

112
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,320
It's a chance for you to start anew.

113
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,680
I like who I am.

114
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,200
- You were due hours ago.
- Yes, I was.

115
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,880
But I had to get us lunch.

116
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,240
- And I met Dale.
- I see that.

117
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
Do you see this?

118
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,720
Our secret plan
to get off this island?

119
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,760
Relax.
Dale is completely trustworthy.

120
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,600
How do you know we can trust him
if you just met him?

121
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,160
Because he's mute and dumb as a post.

122
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,280
Look, I know you're paranoid
about people watching us.

123
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,040
Someone is watching us!

124
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,760
Why do you think
I installed this alarm system?

125
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,720
And as safe as I feel with your
jingle bell contraption in place,

126
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,000
I went out and procured us
some muscle.

127
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
You're welcome.

128
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
At least you're doing something.

129
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,280
How's my SS Gertrude coming along?

130
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,480
Our submarine is coming along
just fine, thank you.

131
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,000
I've been working on the sonar,

132
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
which turns out is

133
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,680
far more complex than I anticipated.

134
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,960
Well, I am confident
you will figure it out.

135
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,360
Of course, I will figure it out,

136
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,240
because I figure everything out.

137
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,360
The navigation system.

138
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,360
The oxygen exchange.

139
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,680
I will figure everything out
because I'm the only one working!

140
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,720
This was supposed to be
a partnership!

141
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,080
It is!

142
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,160
I already did my part by stealing
everything valuable in Gotham,

143
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,480
all of which you get half.

144
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,560
No!

145
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,880
Your goons stole it,
and then you kill 'em.

146
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Are you expecting someone?

147
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,680
Who would I be expecting, Oswald?

148
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,160
I told you someone's watching us.

149
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,520
Dale, go do what I pay you for.

150
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,640
Protect us.

151
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
Wait.

152
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Penn?

153
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,720
Hello, Mr. Cobblepot.

154
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,760
Are you, are you really,
I... I don't believe it.

155
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,440
- You're alive.
- Indeed, sir. I... I am.

156
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,040
But, you were shot. I... I was there.

157
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,520
This whole time, I thought you were
dead but you're alive!

158
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,360
And you're only coming to me now?

159
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,200
I... I'm so terribly sorry,
Mr. Cobblepot.

160
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,360
I wanted to come see you, but...

161
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,080
he wouldn't let me.

162
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,840
"He?" "He" who?

163
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
Mr. Cobblepot...

164
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,360
this is...

165
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,880
Mr. Scarface.

166
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,640
Wonderful.

167
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,000
Look, I'm sure Dix is in the clear,
but we do have to ask.

168
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
That's not it.

169
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,800
I just, I feel bad.

170
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,760
I should've been by before.
I'm all he's got.

171
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,480
Well, look, we came to him, right?

172
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
Dix!

173
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,680
- What the hell?
- Bullock?

174
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,240
- That you?
- Yeah.

175
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,240
Don't shoot.

176
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,320
Okay.

177
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,720
Come in.

178
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,040
Is that the way
you always answer a door?

179
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,760
Nowadays, you can't be too careful,

180
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,160
specially someone like me.

181
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,280
A kid comes in, he'd cut my throat
for a cup of soup.

182
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,320
Anyway, I wasn't expecting you.

183
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,240
Figured you forgot about me.

184
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,280
Look, Martin,
when the bridges came down,

185
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,080
- I got busy, and...
- Oh, sure, sure. You forgot me.

186
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,160
Everybody forgets.

187
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,960
I didn't forget.

188
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,600
Planning on taking a trip?

189
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,760
Maybe. I like to keep a bag
packed just in case.

190
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,120
Yeah? Where were you last night?

191
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,520
Where was I?

192
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
I was right here.

193
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,760
Anybody else here with you?
Anybody that can back up your story?

194
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,400
You're asking me if was I out there
killing Boggs and Lewis?

195
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,000
Does I look like I was out there
killing Boggs and Lewis?

196
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,160
So, you heard about that.

197
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,240
I'm gonna tell you something.

198
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,640
If it meant that I can get out of
this son of a bitch wheelchair,

199
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,080
I would confess right here and now.
To Boggs. To Lewis.

200
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,960
To anybody you want me to confess to.

201
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,080
All right, fine.

202
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,800
But you were a detective.
What would you say if you were us?

203
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,480
We come in here
and you're packing a suitcase.

204
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,240
I would say either I did it,
which I didn't,

205
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,320
or I'd be very worried
that I'd be next.

206
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,840
What do you mean you being be next?

207
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,320
What's your connection
to Boggs and Lewis?

208
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
Come on. What?

209
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,080
Nothing.

210
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,360
I just worked with them. That's it.

211
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,880
We, we worked a case together.

212
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,720
- Four of you?
- Yeah.

213
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,360
Dix wasn't my partner then.
I was a rookie cop.

214
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,840
Wet behind the ears.

215
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,280
- So what was the case?
- Woman killed her husband.

216
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,560
As far as I can remember,
it was pretty open and shut.

217
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,280
But at least we can agree

218
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,560
that Dix didn't walk into The Sirens
and stabbed those two guys.

219
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,640
So who did?

220
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,840
Barbara said Boggs and Lewis
recognized the killer.

221
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,600
They called him Dix.

222
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,640
We come in here,
he's packing a suitcase.

223
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,360
He shoots at us. This stinks, Harvey.

224
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,480
Hey.

225
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
You all right?

226
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,520
What the hell?

227
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,440
These basements run along
Gotham's sewers.

228
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,240
The river is right next to it.

229
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,040
You mean the river
filled with Jeremiah's toxins?

230
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,000
Who knows what kind of damage
these chemicals could do?

231
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
Yeah, you're right.

232
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,240
Just don't you touch anything.

233
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,160
Hold on.

234
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,680
Bite marks.

235
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,320
Animal?

236
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,680
Well, it's no human I've ever seen.

237
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
Whatever it was...

238
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,040
he dragged it that way.

239
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,280
Seems like human skin.

240
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,920
Here's the file you asked for.
Victoria Cartwright.

241
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,040
- How'd you...
- I had Harper run

242
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,600
every case the four of you worked,

243
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,040
cross-referenced with any woman
that killed her husband.

244
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,640
Do I need to read it
or you're gonna tell me what's in it?

245
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,480
Victoria Cartwright was a banker.

246
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,240
She led a very boring life...

247
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,480
Until she snapped

248
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,640
and put 238 caliber
slugs into her husband.

249
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,520
End of story.

250
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
You guys rehearse that?

251
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,560
Says there was no physical evidence.

252
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,600
She was convicted on the statement
of her seven-year-old daughter, Jane.

253
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,480
This was 20 years ago.

254
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,440
- Where's Jane now?
- What's the point?

255
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,560
The killer is a man, a man that can,
imitate friggin' faces.

256
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,400
What was the name of the guy
that Strange got to imitate you,

257
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,560
Basil something?

258
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,240
That's who we should be looking for.

259
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,640
That was different, and you know it.

260
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,400
- We have an address for this Jane?
- No.

261
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,280
But the family's old home
is in the Green Zone.

262
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,000
- Just east of the clinic.
- Jim, it's a dead end.

263
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,200
Is there anything else
you wanna tell me?

264
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,680
You know what?
Why don't you hang back?

265
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

266
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,720
- Are you benching me?
- Killer's still out there.

267
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,800
Keep an eye on your partner.

268
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,560
- Penn, Arnold...
- It's Arthur.

269
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,080
- You're holding a doll.
- It's not a doll.

270
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,480
It's a dummy.

271
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,920
Oh, this is great.

272
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,520
I'm going back to work. Excuse me.

273
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,280
You're saying he made you come here?

274
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,480
Mr. Scarface is very persuasive.

275
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
Persuasive?

276
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,360
He made me tell him about your...

277
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
treasure.

278
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
Penn...

279
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,840
I think you need a rest.

280
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,880
And, perhaps, a psychiatrist.

281
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,160
Then, we can discuss you
resuming your former duties.

282
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,200
Obviously, I won't pay you
for the time you were gone...

283
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,640
Shut your pie hole!

284
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,640
This the one you were tellin' me
about?

285
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,280
- Punk who thinks he's in charge?
- Yes, sir.

286
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,240
That's Mr. Cobblepot.

287
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,440
Oswald, if you don't make him leave,
I will.

288
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,720
- Yeah.
- No one's going anywheres.

289
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,760
Penn, show these dewdroppers
we're serious.

290
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,080
Forgive me.

291
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,360
Now, let's talk turkey, turkeys.

292
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,080
What a mess, huh?

293
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,800
Boggs and Lewis were idiots.
Complete idiots.

294
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,640
They should've known when they see
a guy walking that it ain't me.

295
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,520
You think the Cartwright girl
said something?

296
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,240
How would I know?

297
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,440
So, how've you been
since the bridges came down?

298
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,000
You getting enough food? Medicine?

299
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
What if I said no?

300
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,960
I'd feel like crap.

301
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,840
Then no.

302
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,920
The Cartwright girl is dead.

303
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,040
A buddy of mine was a screw over
at Arkham.

304
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,920
He said she was an inmate there
and she died a couple of years ago.

305
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,040
So this has nothing to do with her.

306
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,120
GCPD. Coming in.

307
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
Check upstairs.

308
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,200
Looks like this place has been
abandoned

309
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,960
since before the bridges came down.

310
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Yeah.

311
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,560
What the hell?

312
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,160
The hell was that?

313
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,120
Someone's been living here.

314
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
What's that smell?

315
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,360
Everything all right?

316
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,280
All good. No one's here.

317
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,360
Hey.

318
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,280
Don't look at me.

319
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,680
Don't you look at me!

320
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,320
We found your handiwork.

321
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,840
Nothing to say?

322
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,080
You're gonna have to take
that mask off.

323
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,520
The only way you're gonna get
that mask on is if you talk.

324
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,800
Otherwise, I'm gonna reach over
this table

325
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,440
and I'm gonna rip it off your face.

326
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,200
- Who are you?
- Nobody.

327
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,440
You're not Jane Cartwright?

328
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,400
Because you were in her
childhood home.

329
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,520
You're about the right age.

330
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,560
Talk to me, Jane.

331
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,840
I know after your mother
was convicted,

332
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,200
you ended up a ward of the state.

333
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,520
In and out of institutions
until you ended up in Arkham.

334
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,520
Then you vanished.

335
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,840
Some say died.

336
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,000
- What happened to you?
- Me?

337
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,560
Nothing happened to me.

338
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,040
Okay.

339
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,720
What happened to Jane?

340
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,440
Oh.

341
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,720
Lots happened to Jane.

342
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,520
She was taken from Arkham.

343
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,200
Down, down, down.

344
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,200
The doctor did things to her,
experiments on her and others.

345
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,840
You're talking about Hugo Strange?

346
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,040
You were taken to Indian Hill?

347
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,160
Professor was obsessed
with the power to change.

348
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,360
The way a chameleon
would change its skin.

349
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,400
He wanted humans to have that power.

350
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,800
He made it so Jane
could change her skin,

351
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,440
her bones, her hair,
the color of her eyes.

352
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,840
All it takes is a single touch
and her body becomes a mirror.

353
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,160
And when it's done,
she sheds her skin and starts anew.

354
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,400
It remembers everyone it touched.

355
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,520
It's touched you, Detective.

356
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,720
We can help you, Ms. Cartwright.

357
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,720
Jane Cartwright is dead.

358
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,160
She died in Arkham.

359
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,440
That's when Jane Doe was born.

360
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,360
So why kill all these cops?

361
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,880
You wanna know why they died?

362
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,240
Ask your friend.

363
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,360
What is that?

364
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
We should head out.

365
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,240
My battery's dying.

366
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,240
He's coming! He's coming!

367
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,360
- Who's coming? What happened?
- He's going to kill me.

368
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,600
I barely got away.

369
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,600
- Are you Hank?
- Yes.

370
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,640
Your wife sent us.

371
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,200
Is anyone else left alone down here?

372
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,280
They're all dead.

373
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,360
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

374
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,640
Oh, God. Oh, God.

375
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,320
Hank! Hank!

376
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
Hold on, Hank!

377
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,320
Hand over the heaters.

378
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,640
If you don't mind.

379
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,760
Mr. Penn, can't we just talk this
through.

380
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,200
Get back!

381
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,280
I'm so sorry.

382
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,680
At least, tell me what happened
after Haven.

383
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,000
Help me to understand this.

384
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,960
Go on.

385
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,000
Sing your song.

386
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,120
After I was shot...

387
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,040
I woke up in the GCPD morgue.

388
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,960
I was alone.

389
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,040
I patched my wounds
as best I could and crawled out.

390
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,880
I hid in a store,
an abandoned magic shop.

391
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,040
That's where Mr. Scarface found me.

392
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,640
And he told me all about you.

393
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,320
How you used him.

394
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,920
Chewed him up and spat him out.

395
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,960
- Treated him like a palooka!
- That's a lie!

396
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,640
Oh, please, Oswald. It's what you do.

397
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
Arnold...

398
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,240
- Arthur, what do you want?
- I don't want anything.

399
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,920
But Mr. Scarface, well...

400
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,840
he wants your treasure,

401
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,240
and to be boss.

402
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,800
Really?

403
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:28,520
The dummy wants to be
boss of Gotham.

404
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,600
Bingo!

405
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,920
Now, give me the key
to your treasure room.

406
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,840
Why would I do that? You're obviously
gonna kill me anyway.

407
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
What am I doing?

408
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,960
- I'm talking to a doll.
- Dummy.

409
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,920
- Seriously?
- You know what, Oswald?

410
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,160
Honestly, you deserve this.

411
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,440
- Nobody asked you.
- You are opportunistic.

412
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,800
Your loyalty is shaky at best.

413
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,760
And you will hurt anyone,
anyone to get what you want.

414
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,520
I hardly think
you're one to throw stones.

415
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,720
- Listen, Penn.
- Eyes down here, pal.

416
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,480
Sorry. Mr. Scarface.
I got a question for you.

417
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,560
Shoot.

418
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,040
After you get your

419
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,000
tiny wooden hands on that treasure,

420
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,760
what are you gonna do?
Where are you gonna go?

421
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,680
People are gonna come after you
eventually.

422
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,120
Then I'll... I'll take 'em all on.

423
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,400
Yeah. Show 'em who's boss.

424
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,640
You wouldn't have to do that

425
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,000
if you could get off this island now,
would you?

426
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,960
- What are you doing?
- Shut it.

427
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,320
Let the smart one talk.

428
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,520
How do you feel about submarines?

429
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,560
What we're doing here?

430
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,720
Just wanted to takes us,
some place quiet.

431
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,880
Where we could talk.

432
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,960
- We did a bad thing.
- Oh, come on. Not that again.

433
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,920
We put a killer in jail. All right?

434
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,200
What do you keep moping about?
She was guilty.

435
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,200
She got what she deserved. Drop it.

436
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,760
Did you get what you deserved?

437
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,080
What?

438
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,160
You made that girl into a murderer.

439
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,040
Oh, come on.

440
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,240
You.

441
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Your friends.

442
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,480
- The kid.
- Come on. You...

443
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,520
I'm gonna make sure
you never do that again.

444
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,480
- Harper, where's Dix?
- I saw Bullock take him in the back.

445
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,920
Barbara, what're you doing here?

446
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,840
Seems my bartender overheard
the killer say something

447
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,720
before he icepicked Harvey's pals.

448
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,280
I thought I'd be a good citizen.

449
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,240
Okay.

450
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,120
"The kid's guilty, too."

451
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,160
"The kid."

452
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,360
Listen.

453
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,000
What you said before,
about me being a known criminal.

454
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,880
I was on some list
your army buddy had.

455
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,960
When the government rolls
in am I gonna be arrested?

456
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,360
Honestly, I don't know.

457
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,560
But that would work out for you,
right?

458
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,160
I go to jail, you get the baby.

459
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,840
I don't want that.

460
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,360
Is that a promise?

461
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,640
I go straight, I'm clear?

462
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,640
Stay right here. Hey, Harvey.

463
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,360
Where'd you take Dix?

464
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,240
I didn't take Dix anywhere.

465
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,000
Oh, God. Oh...

466
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,920
She got into your locker.
Must've taken your clothes.

467
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,520
We have to lock down the GCPD.

468
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,040
Hey, Harvey.

469
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,040
We'll find her.

470
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,040
Come on.

471
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,520
Hey, look at the size of him.

472
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,240
Living down here, the toxins
in the river must've driven him mad.

473
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,320
Get outta here, now!

474
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,320
Alfred!

475
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,280
Alfred!

476
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,560
- Alfred! Stop.
- Stop.

477
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
Stop.

478
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,040
All right, everybody listen up.

479
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,600
GCPD is now in lockdown.

480
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,520
Nobody goes in or out
unless I say so.

481
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,800
She could look like anybody by now.
How are we supposed to find her?

482
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
Jim.

483
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,200
Barbara?

484
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,600
What happened?

485
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,080
What do you mean what happened?
I've been attacked.

486
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,600
- Where'd she go?
- Wait a minute.

487
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,480
- How do we know it's really you?
- Seriously?

488
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,680
This isn't proof enough?

489
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,800
- What the hell?
- That's her.

490
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,880
She's the imposter. Shoot her!

491
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,600
It's me, you idiot.

492
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,680
That sounds like Barbara.

493
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,280
Barbara.

494
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,720
Tell me where we first met.

495
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,280
Don't shoot.

496
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,040
I'm leaving here.

497
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,880
Anyone tries to follow me, she dies.

498
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,000
- Shoot her!
- Can't risk it.

499
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,760
Stay back!

500
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Bullock, wait!

501
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,680
- I'm fine.
- All right. Take her to my office.

502
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,880
- Don't let her out of your sight.
- Okay.

503
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,640
I cannot believe that you told him
about the sub.

504
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,120
And that you're playing along
with his psychosis.

505
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,400
Obviously he was gonna kill you.

506
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,360
I bought us time.

507
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,200
I have an idea.

508
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,240
If you can just keep him busy
and wait for the signal.

509
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,080
- Wait, what's the signal?
- Quit your jawing.

510
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,360
So, Mr. Scarface and I,

511
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,960
have discussed our options

512
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,200
and the submarine
sounds like a good plan.

513
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,800
And since we'll need the smart one
to build this hayburner,

514
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,480
he can keep sucking air.

515
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,000
But Penguin ain't so lucky.

516
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,240
Do it, Penn, ventilate that mook!

517
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,560
I'm so sorry, Mr. Cobblepot.

518
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,240
I wish things would have turned out
differently.

519
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,280
Arthur, I want you to listen to
what I'm saying.

520
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,400
You accuse me of manipulating you,
but what about him?

521
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,520
I never asked you to kill anybody.

522
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,240
- That is true.
- Hey...

523
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,280
Think of everything
that we went through together.

524
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,680
Sofia Falcone.

525
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,320
Getting cut off from the mainland.
Starving.

526
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,440
You mean Penn was starving!

527
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,880
Fighting for scraps
while your dog ate steak!

528
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,720
I welcomed you into my home.

529
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:48,240
And, yes, I was not a good friend,
to you or to anyone.

530
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,960
It's why I'm alone.

531
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,640
But I saw you for what you are
and I valued that.

532
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,080
That must be worth something!

533
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,520
Applesauce!

534
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,880
You're a liar and a thief!

535
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,080
All you do is take, take...

536
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,960
Take!

537
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,280
And you never give anything.

538
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,040
You worked me to the bone!

539
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,640
Forced me to be your puppet.

540
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,240
Well, no more.

541
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,320
You hear me?

542
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,160
No more.

543
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,080
Take that! And that!

544
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,440
No!

545
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,200
Mr . Cobblepot.

546
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,280
You freed me.

547
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,000
- Yeah.
- How can I ever thank you?

548
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,440
Why did you do that?

549
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,280
He wasn't the threat.
The dummy was the threat...

550
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,360
Oswald.

551
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,120
I accept you for the person
that you are.

552
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,280
Just as you accept me
for the cold logician that I am.

553
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,840
That's why this friendship's great.

554
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,240
And as friends,

555
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,600
I think we can both agree
that that lunatic had to be stopped.

556
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,440
Perhaps, Edward,

557
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,200
we really are meant for each other.

558
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,640
Jane?

559
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I know you're up here.

560
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,000
Jane. I knew you'd be here.

561
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,480
I'm sorry.

562
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,720
It was my job to protect you,
and I let you down.

563
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,800
You made Jane into a killer.

564
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,360
You and your friends.
There have to be consequences.

565
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,200
You killed three men already.
When is it enough?

566
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,720
When you're dead.

567
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,520
Put the gun down.

568
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,120
Shoot me.

569
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,440
You killed Jane years ago
and didn't even know it.

570
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,760
Just shoot me.

571
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,040
Let me see your face.

572
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,400
Your real face.

573
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,840
Why? So you can see
what a monster she is?

574
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,120
Hugo Strange only destroyed her face.
You destroyed her soul.

575
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,600
Let me see it.

576
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,040
Do you see?

577
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,200
Do you see what they did?

578
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,600
Jane.

579
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,280
We can work this out,
just put the gun down.

580
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,520
The only way this ends is
with one of us dead.

581
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,560
<i>Oh, my God. You're alive!</i>

582
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,400
The nurse thinks the man
that attacked us will never recover.

583
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,600
The toxins, the river have done
irreparable damage to his brain.

584
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,600
I just think it's a shame we couldn't
save the rest of the people

585
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,680
that went missing, Master Bruce.

586
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,880
We should've went to Gordon
from the start.

587
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,680
- We were reckless.
- Nah, that's nonsense.

588
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,680
We took decisive action,
we saved a man's life.

589
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,000
The people in this city
have suffered, Master Bruce.

590
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,240
They need someone to protect them.

591
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,920
I agree.

592
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,760
But there are better ways
to find absolution.

593
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,760
I... I don't follow.

594
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,960
What happened to Wayne Manor
wasn't your fault.

595
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,960
I know you've been blaming yourself.

596
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,800
You didn't destroy our home, Alfred.

597
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,880
I feel like I did.

598
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,280
It feels like I wasn't strong enough
to fight Tetch

599
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,680
or that bastard, Valeska.

600
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,640
I feel like, because of my weakness,
you lost your last tie to the past.

601
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,240
You lost your home, Master Bruce.

602
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,640
I must never be that weak again.

603
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,520
Part of being a family is that
we can be strong for each other.

604
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,680
And when did you get so smart?

605
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,240
I had a good teacher.

606
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,000
Victoria Cartwright
killed her husband.

607
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,920
After we arrested her,
she admitted it.

608
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,160
Later she recanted.

609
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,520
But the physical evidence
wasn't there.

610
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,120
I was a new cop.

611
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,800
- I wanted to make detective...
- So you leaned on Jane.

612
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,280
Coerced a statement out of her
to put her mother away.

613
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,680
The woman was guilty.

614
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,240
Later I found out the husband...

615
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,240
beat the mother and Jane.

616
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,040
I didn't know till after.

617
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,480
Bartender overheard Jane
say something about

618
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,640
"the kid's guilty, too."

619
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,920
She meant the young cop.

620
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,600
She meant you.

621
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,520
I knew something was wrong.

622
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,040
I felt it.

623
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,680
I said something and they told me
to keep my trap shut.

624
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,480
Just close the case, put a bow on it.

625
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,360
And after a while,
I stopped feeling it.

626
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,480
And I went down that path for a long
time until I met you.

627
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,600
However much I've changed...

628
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,800
I can't change the past.

629
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,400
I made that girl a killer.

630
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
What do you want from me, Harvey?

631
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,640
Forgiveness?

632
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,680
I can't give that to you.

633
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,320
I just needed you to know.
