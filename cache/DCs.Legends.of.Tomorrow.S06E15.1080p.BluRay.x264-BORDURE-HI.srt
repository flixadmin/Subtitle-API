to put the eggs into.

Guys, hurry up.

5
00:00:11,471 --> 00:00:12,555
- It's a bomb.
- Yeah.

6
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:15,183
[gasps] Egg!

00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,101
[timer continues beeping]

00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:19,687

- [timer beeping rapidly]

00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:27,987
[gasps] Mick, you okay?

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,657
Charred. Nothing new.

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,534
At least this little guy's unharmed.

12
00:00:32,617 --> 00:00:33,617
Give me that.

13
00:00:34,327 --> 00:00:35,411
[Mick grunts]

14
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:39,332
You guys... saved them. Why?

15
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:41,251
Those are Mick's kids
you're talking about.

16
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:42,377
That makes them family.

17
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,379
Look, I get why Bishop
would brick the ship

18
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:46,673
but why make
such an elaborate prank out of it?

19
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:48,758
He's stalling. And mission accomplished.

20
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:50,802
And now the bomb obliterated
Gideon's mainframe

21
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:53,221
which means we are... stranded.

22
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:55,473
You're stranded. I still got my ship.

23
00:00:55,557 --> 00:00:56,558
[device beeping]

24

That gyrating bastard.

25
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,150
Let me guess, Bishop stole your ship.

26
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:07,402
I'm gonna kill him.

27
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:08,443

Oh, hey, guys.

32
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:17,662
What happened to my couch?

33
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:20,415
[theme music playing]

34
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:34,178
I knew something was up with John.

35
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:36,615
I shouldn't have gone home.
I should have been here.

36
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:38,808
What could you have done?
We were all fooled.

37
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:41,102
I know a thing or two about addiction.

38
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:43,855
When we get John back on board,
he's not leaving my sight.

39
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,149
It's too late, B. John is gone.

40
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:49,527
Gone? What do you mean, gone?
Like, he escaped?

41
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:50,611
He's dead.

42
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:55,992
Well, that's not possible. [sputters]
He's John Constantine. He can't be dead.

43
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,911
How?

44
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:02,081
He tried to control
the Fountain of Imperium which...

45
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:05,501
turns out, is an ancient fungal network
that's been keeping Earth safe

46
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:07,211
from invasive aliens for eons.

47
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:10,048
Bishop tricked John
into poisoning himself,

48
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:11,966
to kill the Fountain.

49
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,678
And I watched John... die.

50
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:19,807
He decomposed into the ground and

51
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:22,435
all that was left was this.

52
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:25,063
Whoa. May I?

53
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:30,610
Wait a second, where's Spooner?

54
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:34,322
Yeah, about that...

55
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:41,412
So, you're the time travelers
who found my Esperanza in the future.

56
00:02:41,788 --> 00:02:44,916
It's nice to meet you,
despite the circumstances.

57
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,585
I'm so grateful
that she's here with me now.

58
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:52,215
[sighs] But I don't know how much longer
she will stay.

59
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:55,301
Is she... dying?

60
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,512
Nothing I've tried
is helping to stop it.

61
00:02:58,137 --> 00:02:59,514
I'm a healer.

62
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:03,851
And I can't help my own daughter.

63
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,021

[electrical buzzing]

How's it look, smartass?

68
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,865
The CPU was obliterated.

69
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,326
Found some replacement parts

70
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,287
but the wiring needs to be
completely rerouted and...

71

[timer ringing]

72
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:26,666
[Mick] What's the timer for?

73
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:30,044
The eggs, dummy. They need to be
rotated every 12 minutes.

74
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:31,796
Oh. I got 'em.

75
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,879
[timer stops]

76
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:34,841
Just a quarter turn only.

77
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:37,969
- No, that's too much...
- I got it. I got it. Relax.

78
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:43,516
Shouldn't you be strategizing
with your loser human friends?

79
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:47,729
Coming up with some zany hijinks
to save your doomed planet or something?

80
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,565
Nope. I'm staying with my kids.

81
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:52,650
Your kids?

82
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:55,862
In Necrian culture,
the mother raises the children, alone.

83
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:59,157
Look, I wasn't around
for my daughter, Lita.

84
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:02,577
I was lucky she allowed me
back into her life.

85
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:05,747
But I'm never making that mistake again.

86
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:12,628
Ever.

87
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:20,214
We should take her back to the ship.
The MedBay is...

88
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,305
Scratch that. Totally broken.

89
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:23,765
It wouldn't help anyway.

90
00:04:23,848 --> 00:04:25,743
Spooner's like this because of
what's happened to the Fountain.

91
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:26,934
The two of them are linked.

- Slim to none.
- [exhales]

96

That's it?

97
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:50,583
So much for an invasion.

98
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:54,045
It's a scout. They're watching us.

Earth is ours.

103
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:09,310
[breathing heavily] Send the beacon.

104
00:05:09,644 --> 00:05:11,729

Well, then, shoot us both!

There's more coming.

123
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:19,839
We are so screwed.

124
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,345
Zagurons know the Fountain's dead
and they're coming.

125
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:28,264
The Fountain isn't dead. It's dying.

126
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:30,907
Those things are here to finish it off
and take over what's left.

127
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:32,560
Spooner translated the Zag's thoughts.

128
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,979
The power's still inside her
but it is fading fast.

129
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,498
Well, that means there's still hope.

130
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:40,276
You know, we just have to
save the Fountain/Spooner

131
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,695
before the armada of carrion lizards
overwhelms our planet

132
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:43,988
and kills everyone in sight.

133
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:45,907
- Easy-peasy.
- Guys, let's brainstorm.

134
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,909
Let's figure out a way
to heal this Fountain.

135
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:51,913
- We are gonna figure it out, babe.
- Hmm.

136
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,459
What is it?

137
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:59,545
I think this is Bishop's plan.

138
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:02,632
For me to watch you
and everyone I love die.

139
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:03,757
[softly] What?

140
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:05,718
For me and him to be the only two left.

141
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:09,096
Well, it won't happen. We won't let it.

142
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
What, B?

143
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:28,258
I know you want to be alone right now,
but I need you to look at the mushroom.

144
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,242
- I'm good.
- I don't think John's dead.

145
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,412
I think he's inside this little guy.

146
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,958
Just look. And listen.

147
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:39,710
And clear your mind.

148
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:42,672
Are you high right now?

149
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:46,467
Did you come to me,
after John died, stoned?

150
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,260
No, John isn't dead.

151
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:50,012
And that means he can still help us.

152
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:51,615
He'll know what the Fountain
needs to heal.

153
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,642
Stop. Even if he were somehow alive,

154
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,602
he is the last person
we should ask for help.

155
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:57,686
Lest you forget,

156
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:01,023
he screwed all of us over
for his pathetic ego trip.

157
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:02,607
[beeps]

158
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:05,861
The Zagurons are coming to Earth?

159
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,197
I got to fix this thing faster.

160
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,384
They almost killed me once.
I am not facing them again.

161
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:11,784
You won't be alone this time.

162
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:14,120
There is no beating them,
there's only escaping.

163
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:15,788
You want to take the ship and run.

164
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,500
It's the smart thing to do.
Don't worry, I'll keep the kids safe.

165
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:25,881
You could, um, you could come too,
if you want.

166
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:33,305
[Gideon] Ah, I'm back.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

167
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:37,518
<i>I'm back. Hello, Legends.</i>

168
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,145
<i>Did you miss me?</i>

169
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:44,316
<i>By the time you see this recording,
I expect John will be dead.</i>

170
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46,944
<i>The Fountain will also be dead.</i>

171
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:51,365
<i>And my Zaguron friends
should be on their way to destroy you.</i>

172
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:54,744
<i>I hope I've got that right,
otherwise possible egg on my face.</i>

173
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:59,081
<i>And because I can
literally think Sara's thoughts,</i>

174
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:03,919
<i>about now is the time that
Sara Lance has figured out my plan</i>

175
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:07,757
<i>for us to live forever together,
after everyone else has died,</i>

176
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,885
<i>as the new Adam and Eve.</i>

177
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:15,723
<i>Sara, your mind must be racing,</i>

178
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:20,227
<i>realizing that the only one
who can save the Fountain is me.</i>

179
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,104
<i>And spoiler alert...</i>

180
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:24,190
[in sing-song voice] <i>I'm not gonna.</i>

181
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,193
[Nate] So, his message gave me an idea.

182
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:30,071
He said he's the only one
who can save the Fountain,

183
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:31,864
so maybe he should.

184
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,616
Yeah, he's not gonna do that.

185
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:36,494
Not that guy,
but a younger version of him.

186
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,746
[gasps] Time-napping.

187
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:39,997
I love it.

188
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:42,921
Gang, he wasn't always a supervillain,
but he's always been super-smart.

189
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,127
We got the stuff he poisoned John with.

190
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:46,754
Maybe, just maybe,

191
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:49,882
the younger version of him
can reverse-schmience it

192
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,217
and get us an antidote.

193
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,427
It goes against every instinct you have,

194
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:56,180
which means Bishop
would never expect it.

195
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,140
If we only ever do
what makes sense to you,

196
00:09:58,224 --> 00:09:59,809
he will always be one step ahead.

197
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:02,436
There is only one way
to wage a war against yourself.

198
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,732
And that is to have
a "what would Sara never do" day.

199
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:10,778
It is a really bad idea.

200
00:10:14,824 --> 00:10:16,951
- [digital beeping]
- [keyboard clacking]

201
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:22,832
All right, now for the moment of truth.

202
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,751
Come to life,

203
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:27,837
- Ava Prime.
- [chimes]

204
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:33,342
I'm alive.

205
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,514
Hello, I'm...

206
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:40,599
I'm...

207
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:41,850
dying.

208
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:44,103
Oh... Aw.

209
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:45,437
[sighs]

210
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:49,608
The neural network
is still overloading. [groans]

211
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:53,320
I am never gonna get this right.

212
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:56,407
[gasps]

213
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:58,367
Oh.

214
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,163
You're a working Ava.

215
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:04,748
Well, I work, but I don't
let my work define me, you know.

216
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:07,459
How are you...
Was that a chrono-dimensional portal?

217
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:08,836
The less you know, the better.

218
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,338
Headline, we're time travelers
and we need your help.

219
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:13,883
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

220
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,635
I must become wildly famous
for my genius

221
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:18,429
if time travelers
come looking for my help.

222
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,848
I must become a really big deal.

223
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:23,893
- The ego on this dude.
- [softly] We already know.

224
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,616
[in normal voice] All right,
smarty-pants.

225
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,730
Wanna help us save the world?

226
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,110
[Bishop] Wow.

227
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:38,574
Whoever made this is a certified genius.

228
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:41,952
An evil genius, but a genius.

229
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:44,705
Yes, an evil genius
who is not like anyone in this room.

230
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,148
[Bishop] There's some
bio-engineering in this poison that...

231
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:48,768
I'm the only one I've ever met

232
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,270
that could think of anything
this diabolical.

233
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:52,504
Exactly why we came to you.
Now can you please help us?

234
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:54,256
Of course, I can.

235
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,926
I just need some space to work,
and no distractions.

236
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,887
I spoke to John. He is in the mushroom.

237
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:01,764
He wants to talk to us.

238
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,683
And we all got to eat him.

239
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:14,693
So, you ate a strange mushroom
and you thought you heard John's voice?

240
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:15,945
I know I did.

241
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:19,240
It's proof that John's alive,
inside the mushroom.

242
00:12:20,074 --> 00:12:22,409
John wants us to eat the mushroom
and talk to him.

243
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,036
He wants to help us heal the Fountain.

244
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,623
John thinking about someone
other than himself? Not a chance.

245
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,917
We have a plan. That plan is crazy,

246
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,628
but it still makes more sense
than talking to a mushroom.

247
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,923
Zari, wait. Just consider it.

248
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,260
So...

249
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:42,972
are we gonna do this?

250
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:45,891
Communing with a spirit
while in an altered state,

251
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:47,977
it's pretty on-brand for us.

252
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:51,563
Guys, I'm sorry, but no.

253
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:52,898
No, definitely not.

254
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:55,359
The last thing we need to be doing
is tripping on mushrooms.

255
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:57,278
Hmm. Yeah, well,

256
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,197
isn't it "what would Sara never do" day?
Just saying.

257
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:01,615
We already played that game

258
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:04,285
and now it's time to prepare
for an alien invasion.

259
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,205
So, please, everyone,
just go make yourself useful, okay?

260
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:09,790
You're right.

261
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,087
[sighs]

262
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,716
[Constantine whispering]
<i>Sara.</i>

263
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,551
<i>Sara.</i>

264
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,596
<i>Eat me.</i>

265
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:28,434
John?

266
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,020
[Constantine]
<i>Eat the mushroom, love.</i>

267
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,870
John?

268
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:49,996
[Constantine] <i>Sara.</i>

269
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:52,416
<i>Join me.</i>

270
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:57,378
Sara.

271
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,216
John.

272
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:03,594
Hello, Sara.

273
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:05,928
Are you...

274
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,224
Are you alive?

275
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:10,684
Not exactly.

276
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:12,394
I'm...

277
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
present.

278
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:20,235
What I did was unforgivable.

279
00:14:20,486 --> 00:14:21,402
It's okay.

280
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:24,949
We're creating an antidote for
the poison that you gave the Fountain

281
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:27,076
and we can still stop the Zagurons
from coming.

282
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,619
That won't be enough.

283
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,080
Even if we heal
the physical side of the Fountain,

284
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,956
the spiritual side will remain ill.

285
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,793
John, I need your help.

286
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,669
I need you and the Fountain to help.

287
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:39,588
The Fountain has a mind of its own.

288
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:42,674
It no longer deems human beings
worthy of its protection.

289
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:45,302
Damn it, John, you did this,
you need to fix this.

290
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:47,721
I cannot separate myself
from the Fountain.

291
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,058
My life force is the only thing
keeping the Fountain and Spooner alive.

292
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:52,643
If I leave, they both perish.

293
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:55,521
I must stay as long as I can,

294
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:58,774
and let the remnants
of my soul be drained.

295
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,193
Mushrooms feed off death.

296
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,987
So I'm going to feed it,
I owe it that much.

297
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,448
Sorry it had to be this way.

298
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,243
Do you remember
all those years ago when I said

299
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:12,079
that stable relationships
weren't right for you and me?

300
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:14,832
I was wrong.

301
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:19,169
Loving and being loved,
that is the point.

302
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,088
I had that.

303
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,550
It should have been enough
but I wanted more and now,

304
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:28,679
the whole world, especially Zari,
is suffering because of my mistake.

305
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:31,306
I think I understand.

306
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,810
There's one last thing
I need to tell you.

307
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:39,273
It's the greatest thing I've learned
since bonding with the Fountain.

308
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,693
It's the secret to all life.

309
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:48,740
[imperceptible]

310
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,496
Gideon, run a diagnostic.

311
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,039
[Gideon] All systems functioning.

312
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:58,542
And may I add,
nice job on the repairs, Kayla.

313
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,502
Excellent. Then let's get out of here.

314
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,296
Set a course for the Temporal Zone.

315
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:03,922
[Gideon] Jump coordinates plotted.

316
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:04,964
Do it.

317
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:05,965
[Gideon] Executing.

00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:09,470
No, you don't.

320
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:14,475
We can't stay here. Do you understand?

321
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,602
I am trying to protect our children.

322
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,353
I'm not leaving without my kids.

323
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:21,815
I'm not abandoning my friends
or this planet.

324
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,526
You know, I could just snap
your head off

325
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,361
and take that stupid button of yours.

326
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:27,612
Yeah.

327
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,949
But you won't.
There's a part of you that cares.

328
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,037
Astounding.

329
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,682
How long until the antidote is ready?

330
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:38,986
We're kind of on the clock here.

331
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,918
[Bishop] It's done.

332
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,169
[Sara] Guys!

333
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:44,379
I know the answer!

334
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,590
I know the answer to
all of our questions.

335
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:49,051
It's the meaning of life.

336
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:50,886
You ate the mushroom, didn't you?

337
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,305
Yes, and I saw John.

338
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:54,973
- What?
- [Sara] Yeah.

339
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:59,019
He told me what this is about.
He told me what everything is about.

340
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:00,729
He said...

341
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:07,819
"We are all connected."

342
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,536
I think I saw that
on a bumper sticker once.

343
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:20,249
It was really profound in the moment.

344
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:26,171
[gasps]

345
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:30,216
Oh.

346
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:33,345
That's some strong juju.

347
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:37,182
Spooner, good to have you back.

348
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,810
Wait, since Spooner and the Fountain
are connected,

349
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,573
does this mean the Fountain is restored
and we stopped the invasion?

350
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,815
- [rumbling]
- [pods whistling through air]

351
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:49,069
[pods thudding]

352
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:03,142
[Agent Sharpe] Ugh.
There are thousands of these

353
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,209
scattered around the area.

354
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:07,054
I mean, even if we could destroy
the pods, there are too many of them.

355
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,398
You know, they're too spread out.

356
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:10,299
This is classic
Zaguron perimeter technique.

357
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,426
They land, wait for dark

358
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,529
and then they eat anyone
who isn't smart enough

359
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:15,738
- to get out of their way.
- What?

360
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,348
- Which is something we should be doing.
- No, we're not running.

361
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:20,183
It's 1925.

362
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,853
They'll destroy the entire human race
before we're ever born.

363
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:24,688
We gotta hold the line.

364
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,651
- [device beeping]
- Heart rate, normal.

365
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,236
Blood pressure, good.

366
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,363
I think you're finally back with us,
Ms. Cruz.

367
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:36,199
- How do you feel?
- Mmm. Like I just ran a marathon.

368
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,868
Sweaty, starving.

369
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,038
Here, darling, try this.

370
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:42,748
<i>Gracias, Mami.</i>

371
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,031
- So, Spooner?
- [Spooner] Hmm?

372
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,710
Glad you're feeling better
and not to be a buzzkill, but

373
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,046
can you hear
what the Zagurons are thinking?

374
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:51,131
Find out what they're doing out there?

375
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:52,256
I got nothing.

376
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,760
The only thoughts in my head
right now are my own.

377
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:56,887
I don't feel aliens or mushrooms
or anything.

378
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,847
Sorry, I'm confused.

379
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,807
I thought you and the Fountain
were linked.

380
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:04,811
If you're fine, then shouldn't
the Fountain wake up or whatever?

381
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,396
Scare the Zags away?

382
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,524
The one thing I learned
while being connected to the Fountain,

383
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:11,026
it doesn't want to help us.

384
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,904
Then we'd better have
a damn good plan B.

385
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,536
All right, we have about
four more hours left of daylight.

386
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:23,747
So got to gear up, hydrate and

387
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,707
[exhales] prepare
for the fight of our lives.

388
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,085
Ava, will you marry me?

389
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,544
What?

390
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,129
We already did the proposal thing.

391
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:34,257
No, I mean marry me now,
today, before the apocalypse.

392
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:36,103
What are you talking about?
We can't just...

393
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,134
Why not?

394
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:39,304
We're gonna have to
fight those things anyway.

395
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:43,892
We're ready as we're ever gonna be,
and four hours is totally doable.

396
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,436
Ooh! We can get the whole team on board.

397
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:49,106
We've produced much crazier
miracles in far less time.

398
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:52,442
No, I would rather save the miracles
for the actual fight.

399
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:54,111
You guys, we may not survive the night.

400
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,446
Then let's go out on our own terms,

401
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:59,032
do things our way,
do what we've always wanted to do.

402
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:00,325
We've got our friends,

403
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:02,369
we've got our vows
and we've got four hours.

404
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:03,453
What else do we need?

405
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:05,747
I don't know,
maybe for the world not to be ending.

406
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,373
Hey.

407
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,459
John told me
the most important thing in life

408
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,962
is loving someone and being loved.

409
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:15,465
And if getting married is the last thing
that we do together then,

410
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:18,385
damn, I will be just fine with that.

411
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:22,723
You have really gone to town with this
"what would Sara Lance never do" thing.

412
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:23,806
- Um...
- Mmm-hmm.

413
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:27,227
Okay, let's do it.
Let's get married.

414
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,710
- Come here.
- [Agent Sharpe laughs]

415
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:30,063
Wedding before war!

416
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:31,063
[Agent Sharpe] Yes.

417
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,150
[all laughing]

418
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:35,277
[upbeat music playing]

419
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:39,322
<i>Ready for a celebration</i>

420
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,409
<i>I've been waiting my whole life</i>

421
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:46,955
<i>Who ever knew it would feel so good</i>

422
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:49,750
<i>I feel like I'm right on time</i>

423
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:54,546
<i>You make me a believer</i>

424
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,132
<i>You're one of a kind</i>

425
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,927
<i>You make me a believer</i>

426
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:07,142
<i>Believer, believer, believer</i>

427
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,855
<i>No doubt in my mind</i>

428
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:20,906
Last time I used this tablecloth
was for my wedding to your <i>papi.</i>

429
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:25,368
I thought I would keep it locked away
until I used it for yours.

430
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:28,872
Not sure that's ever gonna happen.

431
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:32,584
[both speaking Spanish]

432
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,466
[in English] Stopping aliens
is what my friends and I do.

433
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:44,513
But I can't protect a planet
if I'm too busy protecting you.

434
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,515
You're too important to me, <i>Mami.</i>

435
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,225
I need you to be safe.

436
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,477
[in English] But this is my home.

437
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:54,689
I built it with my own two hands
for you, for us.

438
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:57,567
I spent my whole life
thinking aliens killed you.

439
00:21:57,776 --> 00:22:00,654
I never thought I'd see you again.
I thought I'd lost you forever.

440
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:04,324
This, this has been a gift.

441
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,369
I've never been happier
to be wrong about anything.

442
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:09,663
But if you stay...

443
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,666
then that horrible story

444
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,835
I had to live with for 20 years
will be true.

445
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:18,129
[speaking Spanish]

446
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:39,693
[in English] I'll go pack my things.

447
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,423
[exhales]

448
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:05,677
- [mumbles]
- Here's your gown.

449
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:06,970
Thank you, Gary.

450
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,306
- What are you writing?
- [slams pen] Nothing.

451
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:11,868
I'm writing nothing because
every time I write something down,

452
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:13,268
it's stupid and meaningless,

453
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:15,037
and wedding vows
are supposed to be perfect.

454
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,564
You waited until right now
to write your vows?

455
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:20,942
Sorry, it's just very unlike you.

456
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:23,194
I waited until now because before I was

457
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:26,114
focused on every tiny detail
of my dream wedding.

458
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:29,910
And now, we're throwing it all away
and racing into this slap-dash ceremony,

459
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:33,455
and I have no time and I feel like
I'm gonna just screw it all up...

460
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:34,789
Hey, hey, hey.

461
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:36,708
Deep breaths.

462
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,126
- [exhales heavily]
- Huh?

463
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:39,753
- It's gonna be fine.
- How?

464
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,796
Sara already wrote her vows, Gary.

465
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,757
Sara, the person who
never plans anything,

466
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,842
already did the one thing
that every wedding needs.

467
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:47,344
Okay. Here's what's gonna happen.

468
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:49,822
- You're gonna walk down that aisle...
- Mmm-hmm.

469
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:50,846
To the love of your life.

470
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,058
She's gonna say
some very beautiful things to you.

471
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:55,023
- You're not helping.
- No, no, no. And then...

472
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,810
You...

473
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:01,441
You're gonna look deep
into those gorgeous blue eyes of hers,

474
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:03,777
and say what you feel.

475
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,362
I feel sick.

476
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:06,613
- Don't say that.
- I don't...

477
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:07,947
What are you...

478
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:10,408
You want me to improvise? Me?

479
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:11,743
- Yeah, you.
- I can't...

480
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:15,664
Because I know what you say
in that moment will be perfect.

481
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,624
Because it's true.

482
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:20,502
Because it's you.

483
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:26,383
- Gary?
- Mmm-hmm?

484
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:29,844
Will you please walk me down the aisle?

485
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:37,227
It would be my greatest honor,
Director Sharpe.

It's not like you gave me much choice.

494
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:15,598
You brought the kids.

495
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:18,005
Last time they were left on the ship,
they almost blew up.

Yes. Yes, they did.

We're gathered here today,
on what may very well be our last,

507
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:05,273
to celebrate the union
of these two amazing people.

508
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:08,151
I fondly remember the moment they met.

509
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:10,403
- She had a gun.
- [chuckles]

She had a glare.

Destiny was at work.

512
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:16,503
We've all been through a lot
since that day.

513
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:18,554
And on that journey,
you've challenged each other

514
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:20,418
to be the best versions
of yourselves possible.

515
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,580
This moment,

00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:22,831
this wedding,

517
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,293
this is exactly what the world needs.

518
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:27,879
We're facing insurmountable odds,

519
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:31,508
but even during the darkest of times,
when hope seems lost...

520
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:33,133
love...

521
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:35,845
love is what matters most.

What could a mess like me ever have
to offer someone as special as you?

524
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:49,067
Can't exactly say it was love
at first sight... [chuckles]

525
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:52,487
But you did look really good
in that pantsuit."

526
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:55,907
- Mmm-hmm.
- "But the more that I got to know you,

527
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:59,911
and I got to feel your kindness
and your honesty,

528
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:03,414
this heart once so cold
and guarded, it just...

529

It just melted.

530
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:09,254
And, Ava, it's because of you

531
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:11,714
that I get to know
what true love feels like.

532
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:13,966
And so,

533
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:16,886
today, here,
in front of all of our friends...

534
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:21,015
I wanna make these vows to you.

535
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:26,396
I will always be your champion,
your lover.

536
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:28,648
I will always be your family.

537
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:33,153
And I will listen to you
even when the words are hard to hear.

538
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:36,322
And I will let you in
even when I'm afraid.

539
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:38,575
And I will support you.

540
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:40,493
I will fight for you.

541
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,287
And above all,

542
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:44,873
Ava Sharpe, I will love you."

Oh... Oh, man.

I, uh...

547
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:57,551
Okay.

548
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:00,180
Sara, I...

549
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:05,226
My life before you
was a perfect fabrication.

550
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:08,646
And then you came into my world and

551
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:11,900
everything just became a whirlwind,
you know.

552
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,736
You brought chaos into my tidy,

553
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:17,322
predictable existence and, um...

554
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,575
You pretty much brought me to life.

555
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:25,580
So I vow to you
to live this life together.

556
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:29,500
Co-captains forever, baby. [chuckles]

Wow. That's embarrassing.</i>

I'm not losing you too.

At least we got to get married
before the end, right?

643
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:32,386
Wait, you're not married.

644
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,763
We didn't do the "I do's."

645
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:36,057
I'll buy you some time.

646
00:33:36,516 --> 00:33:37,934
Everyone, huddle up!

647
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:40,657
We're getting these two hitched,
even if it's the last thing we do.

648
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:43,773
Get married, quick,
before I change my mind.

649
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:46,567
[screeches]

650
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:03,960
Sara, do you take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife

651
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:06,170
- till death do you part?
- I do.

652
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:11,008
[Nate] Do you, Ava, take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife

653
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:14,595
- till death do you part?
- I do.

654
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:15,762
[sighs]

655
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:21,894
[roaring]

656
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:25,815
By the power vested in me
by the world wide web,

657
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,734
I pronounce you wife and wife.

658
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,706
[growling]

659
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:10,776
So, that was the Fountain of Imperium.

660
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,111
And it saved us.

661
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:14,363
It decided we were worth it after all.

662
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:16,049
I guess getting hitched
at the end of the world

663
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:17,283
wasn't such a bad idea.

664
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:19,201
Damn right... wifey.

665
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:20,620
[Agent Sharpe] Mmm!

666
00:35:23,706 --> 00:35:25,291
The Fountain loves love.

667
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:27,918
Stupid zags and their stupid
mushroom allergy.

668
00:35:28,002 --> 00:35:31,464
Well, if you want something done right,
you gotta do it your damn self.

669
00:35:32,048 --> 00:35:34,133
Give it up, Bishop. You lost.

670
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:35,593
Never!

671
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:36,844
- [egg cracks]
- Ooh!

672
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:40,306
[eggs cracking]

673
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:41,641
It's time.

674
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,563
I'll give you one last chance
to leave and never come back.

675
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,958
I found your younger self once
and I'll do it again.

676
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:53,861
End you before you become the sad,
little deranged man you are now.

677
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:59,450
I will blast each and every human
on this stupid planet to bits,

678
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:02,161
starting with all of you.

679
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:04,121
I don't care how long it takes.

680
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:07,208
You and I will be the only two left.

681
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:08,626
[eggs rustling]

682
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:12,253
What the...

683
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,426
Wait, are those...

684
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:19,679
Aw!

685
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:25,017
No! Let go of me!

686
00:36:25,643 --> 00:36:28,270
Get off me! Aah! Stop! Stop!

687
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:29,730
[screaming]

688
00:36:36,028 --> 00:36:37,071
[chuckles softly]

689
00:36:37,822 --> 00:36:40,491
- [chittering]
- [burps]

690
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:45,579
Oh.

691
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:47,039
[Gary] Oh, yeah.

692
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:50,501
Necrian babies wake up very hungry.

693
00:36:50,668 --> 00:36:53,068
They'll typically devour
the first thing they see. [sniffles]

694
00:36:53,963 --> 00:36:55,065
Did I not mention that before?

695
00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:56,089
- No.
- No.

696
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:57,508
[Gary] Oh.

697
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:01,052
[chittering]

698
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,853
Hey, little guy or girl.

699
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:13,232
Either way, I love you.

700
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:17,278
- [Sara] Aw.
- Oh!

701
00:37:17,528 --> 00:37:18,863
Guys, you got married.

702
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:20,239
You became parents.

703
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:22,867
- Mazel tov, everybody!
- [all cheering]

704
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,243
Let's party!

705
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,540
I think I understand now.

706
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,625
You brought me here as a warning,

707
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:34,128
to show me what I'll become
if I don't change my ways.

708
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:36,046
Well, I got the message.

709
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:39,717
And I swear, I will never become that.

710
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:41,802
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

711
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:43,864
- That's a very sweet sentiment.
- [Agent Sharpe] It is.

712
00:37:43,888 --> 00:37:45,598
But unfortunately...

713
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:47,433
you're gonna have to
live out that destiny.

714
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:49,310
It's how the timeline works. Sorry.

715
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,063
- Ava Prime?
- Here we go.

716
00:37:53,147 --> 00:37:54,398
Is this a dream?

717
00:37:54,482 --> 00:37:56,734
Click your heels, Dorothy.
You're going home.

718
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:06,535
[wind blowing]

719
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:16,921
I really did love you.

720
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,635
I wish that could have been enough.

721
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,519
What's the hurry, love?

722
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:38,566
You!

723
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:40,569
You bastard!

724
00:38:40,653 --> 00:38:42,253
What, have you been sneaking around here

725
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:43,321
- this whole time?
- No, no.

726
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:44,908
I just got here. Honestly. Really.

727
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,827
You know, after the Fountain healed
and could survive without me,

728
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:52,248
it saw the purity of my sacrifice and
it saw fit to give me another chance.

729
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:53,582
Your "purity"?

730
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:57,086
- Don't lie to me.
- Okay, all right. I was joking.

731
00:38:57,795 --> 00:38:59,964
Yeah, the Fountain
didn't think too highly of me.

732
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:03,300
Even less after I contacted
an old associate in Hell.

733
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:04,677
Long story short,

734
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:08,556
the chit to my soul
now belongs to a demon once again.

735
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:11,600
And the Fountain is very happy
that I'm no longer bound to it.

736
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:13,894
Wow. You haven't changed at all,
have you?

737
00:39:14,103 --> 00:39:15,103
[chuckles softly]

738
00:39:15,688 --> 00:39:18,899
You know, people can change
and not change at the same time.

739
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,694
I'm still a bastard, I know that.

740
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:26,115
But, I guess, now I know what
I'm missing by being a bastard.

741
00:39:28,868 --> 00:39:30,202
We mucked it up.

742
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:33,956
We mucked it up just like...
you said we would.

743
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:37,751
I'd do it all over again
in a heartbeat, love.

744
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:41,547
Me too.

745
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:47,386
Listen... I have to walk
a different path now.

746
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:50,014
- Away from the Legends.
- [sighs]

747
00:39:50,264 --> 00:39:51,307
But here.

748
00:39:52,141 --> 00:39:53,183
Take this.

749
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,230
An old key? What is this for?

750
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:01,525
You'll find out.

751
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:11,159
[Mick exhales]

752
00:40:13,037 --> 00:40:14,413
Life's crazy, isn't it?

753
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:22,046
Imagine if our first day on the
<i>Waverider,</i> we traveled to this moment,

754
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,048
to this house,

755
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:27,259
and we saw me, a captain with a wife,

756
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,304
and you with 48 kids.

757
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:33,098
Forty-nine, and a grandbaby on the way.

758
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,102
I don't think we would
have recognized ourselves.

759
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:38,937
No.

760
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:43,025
Gotta move forward, I guess,
to the next job,

761
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:45,778
with a new partner.

762
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:49,615
Yeah.

763
00:40:50,908 --> 00:40:52,451
I had a feeling that was coming.

764
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:56,080
You know you'll always have a home
on the <i>Waverider.</i>

765
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,043
And I guess you'll be busy
taking care of 48 punks.

766
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:05,881
Well, I've learned a thing or two
about handling punks.

767
00:41:06,924 --> 00:41:08,550
Watched you do it for six years.

768
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:13,304
There you go.

769
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:14,349
What's this?

770
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,808
It's a bridal bouquet.

771
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:17,685
That means you're next.

772
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:20,396
[Mick] Ugh.

773
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:28,904
Well, that's that.

774
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,031
Yeah, I'm kind of nervous.

775
00:41:31,115 --> 00:41:33,242
Things rarely wrap up
in a neat little bow for us.

776
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:37,204
Oh, come on, babe, don't be paranoid.
Life, it's gonna start going our way.

777
00:41:48,382 --> 00:41:49,508
[all gasping]

778
00:41:55,973 --> 00:41:57,057
What the hell?

779
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:58,892
[sighs wearily]

780
00:42:01,729 --> 00:42:03,355
[theme music playing]
