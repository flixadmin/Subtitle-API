1
00:01:18,591 --> 00:01:28,125
Junk car!

2
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,579
Get out of here, kid.

3
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:04,400
I told you to get out of here.

4
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:30,027
Go home, kid.

5
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:33,328
Little brat.

6
00:02:35,134 --> 00:02:36,897
What the hell are they doing?

7
00:02:38,137 --> 00:02:39,229
Hey you!

8
00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:41,137
Put that back!

9
00:02:44,444 --> 00:02:48,210
Hey, leave it there. Go away.

10
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:49,212
Hey you!

11
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:51,679
That's important, don't touch!

12
00:02:54,787 --> 00:02:56,414
Those kids.

13
00:03:34,627 --> 00:03:39,326
MEMORIES OF MURDER

14
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:40,662
What?

15
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:44,793
You dated the dead girl, and
she dumped you last August?

16
00:03:44,904 --> 00:03:45,836
Is that right?

17
00:03:47,306 --> 00:03:48,671
That's correct.

18
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:52,541
That's correct? Take off
your hat, you damn punk.

19
00:03:54,681 --> 00:03:57,241
Do women like guys like you?

20
00:03:58,317 --> 00:04:05,553
After watching Body Heat...

21
00:04:05,658 --> 00:04:08,525
Body Heat?
That an action movie?

22
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:11,696
A, c, t...

23
00:04:18,571 --> 00:04:20,402
Damn punk...

24
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:25,000
...since it's a rape
and murder case and all...

25
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:28,342
well...

26
00:04:28,448 --> 00:04:32,885
...if she was sexy,
or pretty, that sort of thing.

27
00:04:32,985 --> 00:04:34,475
Your impressions?

28
00:04:35,188 --> 00:04:37,315
Well,

29
00:04:37,423 --> 00:04:40,790
she didn't seem
like a country girl...

30
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:43,090
Don't blink.

31
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:46,828
You blinked, didn't you?

32
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:50,425
Hey, look at me.

33
00:04:51,704 --> 00:04:54,104
Don't look at the ceiling,
look at me!

34
00:04:55,441 --> 00:04:58,604
Was he born that way?
One, two...

35
00:05:11,357 --> 00:05:14,520
Didn't you want to go
to the Military Academy?

36
00:05:14,627 --> 00:05:16,925
Did you take the exam?

37
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:19,930
You need to study hard
to get in there.

38
00:05:22,568 --> 00:05:25,469
- Receipt!
- You didn't ask for one.

39
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:28,665
What? I told you to bring one.

40
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:31,107
- I told you.
- No you didn't.

41
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,542
That's what you said last time...

42
00:05:33,646 --> 00:05:36,376
Here's one, here.

43
00:05:37,383 --> 00:05:41,820
You answered the phone,
you lying bastard...

44
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:46,824
I need a receipt from the restaurant.
Not from a bicycle shop.

45
00:05:57,637 --> 00:05:59,764
Why didn't you rope
the place off?

46
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:03,467
At least get some sticks
to drive them in, morons.

47
00:06:03,576 --> 00:06:05,703
Inspector Park, over here!

48
00:06:07,313 --> 00:06:09,406
- What is this?
- It's a footprint.

49
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:12,843
- When did you find it?
- This morning, sir!

50
00:06:12,952 --> 00:06:15,147
Go help those jerks over there.

51
00:06:15,254 --> 00:06:17,313
You called the forensics team?

52
00:06:17,423 --> 00:06:19,584
Yes, they're on their way.

53
00:06:20,693 --> 00:06:24,390
But, where's the
person who reported this?

54
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:29,761
No forensics team,
this is total chaos!

55
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:31,803
Jesus, look at him!

56
00:06:33,606 --> 00:06:34,334
Hey!

57
00:06:34,774 --> 00:06:35,798
Get out of here!

58
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:41,144
Who received the call on this?

59
00:06:41,447 --> 00:06:42,846
Did you find out
who reported it?

60
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:45,543
The phone... The crime
site is getting ruined.

61
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:49,018
Damn forensics team's
not here, this is a mess.

62
00:06:49,121 --> 00:06:51,487
What are you talking about?

63
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:55,789
Take pictures when I tell you!

64
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:58,991
Why'd you bring
so many reporters?

65
00:06:59,098 --> 00:07:02,329
They were all here when I arrived.

66
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:05,495
Reporter Park's not here.
Must be on vacation.

67
00:07:05,605 --> 00:07:07,095
I don't see him.

68
00:07:07,206 --> 00:07:08,673
Feels great with
that shithead gone.

69
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:12,175
Why does this have
to happen to me?

70
00:07:12,278 --> 00:07:14,838
How can I investigate like this?

71
00:07:14,947 --> 00:07:19,316
Hey, tractor!

72
00:07:19,418 --> 00:07:21,886
Tractor!

73
00:07:21,988 --> 00:07:26,948
Tractor, stay away! Detour!

74
00:07:30,363 --> 00:07:32,331
If someone waves,
shouldn't you look?

75
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:35,229
Shit, is he deaf?

76
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:37,894
Shit! Look at this.

77
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:41,098
Now those bastards show up.

78
00:07:43,576 --> 00:07:47,171
What the hell took you so long?

79
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,181
The crime scene's ruined!

80
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:54,219
Jesus, look at these sliding fools!

81
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,220
What's going on?

82
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:06,295
How can you look at
those photos while eating?

83
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:10,765
If I keep staring at them,

84
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,236
one moment it'll hit me.

85
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:14,431
Instinctively.

86
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,905
Are you a fortune teller?

87
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:18,103
Open up a shop then.

88
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:25,246
Chief, I may know nothing else,
but my eyes can read people.

89
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:27,414
It's how I survive as a detective.

90
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,719
There's a reason people
say I have shaman's eyes.

91
00:08:32,825 --> 00:08:34,986
OK, then.

92
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:37,661
You see those two guys there?

93
00:08:39,732 --> 00:08:45,034
One of them's a rapist, and the
other is the victim's brother.

94
00:08:45,137 --> 00:08:53,573
He caught the guy doing this to
his sister, and dragged him in.

95
00:08:55,414 --> 00:09:01,546
So tell me,
which one's the rapist?

96
00:09:13,245 --> 00:09:16,373
I'll give this to you
especially today.

97
00:09:16,481 --> 00:09:18,506
I'm so grateful.

98
00:09:20,051 --> 00:09:22,815
It's just a flu shot.

99
00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:24,548
Know how much this costs?

100
00:09:27,492 --> 00:09:29,858
- Kwak Sul-young?
- Yeah?

101
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:34,728
You must be earning more
now than at the hospital.

102
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:39,698
I hear everyone in
town comes to you.

103
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:42,898
Shh. I got something to tell you.

104
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:46,444
I heard this from the
old woman at the mill.

105
00:09:46,778 --> 00:09:50,475
You know the Baek family
meat restaurant?

106
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:52,410
The Baek family?

107
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:56,409
You know what people call them?

108
00:09:56,788 --> 00:09:57,812
What?

109
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,925
The Baek Lady Killers.

110
00:10:02,193 --> 00:10:05,219
- Ladies?
- Yeah.

111
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:10,632
But the son's a little
bit retarded. Kwang-ho.

112
00:10:11,836 --> 00:10:16,705
Kwang-ho used to follow
Hyang-sook around all the time.

113
00:10:16,808 --> 00:10:19,777
Hyang-sook?
The one who was killed?

114
00:10:19,878 --> 00:10:21,402
Yeah.

115
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,883
She was found with
a girdle over her head?

116
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:28,179
Right.

117
00:10:29,354 --> 00:10:31,379
Even more important,

118
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:34,458
the night she was killed...

119
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,292
that old woman saw
Kwang-ho following her.

120
00:10:40,498 --> 00:10:43,467
- Really?
- That's what I'm saying.

121
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:47,061
I heard that old hag
went senile last year.

122
00:10:47,172 --> 00:10:48,799
No, she's fine.

123
00:10:53,979 --> 00:10:57,642
That kid... Wait.

124
00:10:58,016 --> 00:11:00,951
Kwang-ho? What's he look like?

125
00:11:01,252 --> 00:11:06,781
This side of his face is a bit...
you know.

126
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:10,122
Tell me in detail.

127
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:12,696
Anyways, he's a poor little kid.

128
00:11:37,188 --> 00:11:38,120
Kwang-ho.

129
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,618
Let's talk man to man.

130
00:11:41,726 --> 00:11:45,594
You see a pretty girl,
you want to do her.

131
00:11:45,697 --> 00:11:51,431
When I was your age, I'd go
out with friends, I understand.

132
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:57,600
You never intended to kill
Hyang-sook at first, huh?

133
00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:00,610
"How about just
touching her breast..."

134
00:12:00,712 --> 00:12:01,701
I couldn't touch it.

135
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:04,680
So you killed her?
Kill her, then you can touch it.

136
00:12:04,783 --> 00:12:06,250
No, I didn't.

137
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:13,648
That guy coming down now,
he's had a hard life, like you.

138
00:12:13,758 --> 00:12:15,783
He's nice.

139
00:12:15,894 --> 00:12:18,294
He's really sweet.

140
00:12:18,396 --> 00:12:20,694
He never beats anyone.

141
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:23,666
But sometimes,
you know,

142
00:12:23,768 --> 00:12:26,999
if he gets worked up
about something...

143
00:12:30,675 --> 00:12:34,634
God, what an ugly face.

144
00:12:34,746 --> 00:12:39,683
Just looking at this face
makes me angry.

145
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:42,886
Shit.

146
00:12:53,765 --> 00:12:55,357
Pretty?

147
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:59,735
This is so it won't
leave scratches, you punk.

148
00:12:59,838 --> 00:13:01,135
Hey, hey...

149
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:03,839
What's with the army boots?

150
00:13:03,942 --> 00:13:05,967
Doing this to the kid...

151
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,238
Kwang-ho, get up.

152
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:15,715
Are you really innocent? Huh?

153
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,219
Look in my eyes.

154
00:13:19,824 --> 00:13:21,348
Where the hell's he looking?

155
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:23,120
Look in my eyes!

156
00:14:01,099 --> 00:14:03,624
Excuse me, miss...

157
00:14:04,202 --> 00:14:05,567
Hello?

158
00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:08,671
Oh, miss?

159
00:14:09,274 --> 00:14:10,536
Are you all right?

160
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:12,738
Why are you following me?

161
00:14:12,844 --> 00:14:15,972
To ask directions.

162
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,173
Let me help you.

163
00:14:20,952 --> 00:14:22,749
Let go!

164
00:14:22,854 --> 00:14:24,116
What's wrong?

165
00:14:24,222 --> 00:14:28,420
Rolling in the fields, huh?
Is this town rapist's paradise?

166
00:14:28,526 --> 00:14:31,259
You shithead.

167
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:38,326
What the hell?

168
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:40,802
Who are you?

169
00:14:40,905 --> 00:14:43,271
Get over here.

170
00:14:43,608 --> 00:14:47,169
Hey miss, the victim
needs to file a report!

171
00:14:49,581 --> 00:14:50,605
Miss!

172
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:02,691
Where is she going?

173
00:15:02,794 --> 00:15:04,159
Are you a detective?

174
00:15:07,632 --> 00:15:10,499
You should have told me.

175
00:15:10,602 --> 00:15:11,762
My mistake.

176
00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:16,106
How can a detective
be such a bad fighter?

177
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:22,971
How can a detective have
such a bad eye for criminals?

178
00:15:27,252 --> 00:15:29,049
What's that smell?

179
00:15:29,354 --> 00:15:30,878
Oh, sneakers.

180
00:15:31,155 --> 00:15:32,349
They smell bad?

181
00:15:32,457 --> 00:15:37,156
But these here are
evidence item #28.

182
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,178
Develop these quickly, huh?

183
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,624
- Uh, chief.
- What?

184
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,285
This guy here... from Seoul.

185
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:15,992
Nice to meet you!
I got the call...

186
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,795
But...

187
00:16:17,902 --> 00:16:19,995
your face...

188
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,039
Did anything happen?

189
00:16:23,141 --> 00:16:25,041
- No, nothing.
- A desk, you need...

190
00:16:25,143 --> 00:16:28,840
Oh, I prepared a desk
over there with lots of sunlight.

191
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,913
I think... I like that corner.

192
00:16:35,253 --> 00:16:37,949
Okay, okay! As you wish.

193
00:16:40,224 --> 00:16:42,749
Inspector Jo, say hello.

194
00:16:43,828 --> 00:16:45,887
From Seoul,

195
00:16:45,997 --> 00:16:48,761
Suh Tae...yoon, senior officer.

196
00:16:48,866 --> 00:16:51,061
Jo Yong-gu. Nice to meet you.

197
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:55,337
He volunteered to assist
with this investigation.

198
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,230
Quite an uncommon thing.

199
00:16:57,342 --> 00:17:00,778
Well, go arrange your desk.

200
00:17:00,878 --> 00:17:02,277
Yes, sit down.

201
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,281
Inspector Chief

202
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:20,965
The song is great.
The opening song.

203
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:23,761
I always watch
Inspector Chief with Dad.

204
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:25,995
What was my phone number?

205
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,305
Just eat.

206
00:17:28,406 --> 00:17:30,499
Right, I need to call Dad!

207
00:17:30,608 --> 00:17:34,009
I should call. Oh, it's Dad!

208
00:17:43,621 --> 00:17:45,088
Hey, Kwang-ho.

209
00:17:47,392 --> 00:17:48,916
Listen.

210
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:53,054
This footprint was found at the
site of Hyang-sook's murder.

211
00:17:53,164 --> 00:17:54,188
Look.

212
00:17:55,099 --> 00:17:57,761
And these are sneakers
we found at your house.

213
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,837
You wear these? Right?

214
00:18:00,938 --> 00:18:02,667
Now, look closely.

215
00:18:02,774 --> 00:18:08,576
The footprint in this photo,
and the sole of your shoe.

216
00:18:08,846 --> 00:18:10,507
The same, right?

217
00:18:10,615 --> 00:18:12,708
This pattern?

218
00:18:12,817 --> 00:18:18,153
The circle, this indentation?
Exactly the same.

219
00:18:18,256 --> 00:18:19,985
Am I right?

220
00:18:20,691 --> 00:18:23,159
This part was smudged,

221
00:18:23,261 --> 00:18:25,195
don't worry about that.

222
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:32,833
You killed all
those women, right?

223
00:18:32,937 --> 00:18:33,904
Okay.

224
00:18:35,273 --> 00:18:37,707
You didn't kill them all, right?

225
00:18:41,512 --> 00:18:45,312
So you didn't not kill only
Hyang-sook, correct?

226
00:18:47,185 --> 00:18:48,516
I didn't kill anyone.

227
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:52,419
We've got the
evidence here!

228
00:18:52,523 --> 00:18:56,084
- Where's our shovel?
- Shovel?

229
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,997
Look at you...

230
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:05,625
Hey, bastard. Give me that.

231
00:19:05,736 --> 00:19:08,762
Can't you even shovel right?
Watch me.

232
00:19:08,873 --> 00:19:12,104
Loosen the dirt first.
Then push with your foot.

233
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,041
- Kwang-ho!
- Yes?

234
00:19:14,145 --> 00:19:18,081
You punk.

235
00:19:18,182 --> 00:19:22,141
Did you come here to play?

236
00:19:22,253 --> 00:19:23,686
You know where this is?

237
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,445
We came here to bury you.

238
00:19:25,556 --> 00:19:29,515
What? Why?
Why?

239
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,891
Because you won't
listen, you bastard.

240
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:35,261
- I'm a good boy.
- Then tell me!

241
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:39,364
Out here in the fresh air.
With that face.

242
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,131
Hey, come here.

243
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:45,073
Women hate this
face, don't they?

244
00:19:45,176 --> 00:19:47,576
They grimace and all
fucking run away.

245
00:19:47,678 --> 00:19:49,339
It's true.

246
00:19:49,447 --> 00:19:51,244
I'll kill them all.

247
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:58,147
Everyone who
grimaces at my face.

248
00:19:58,256 --> 00:20:00,121
I'll kill them all.

249
00:20:01,893 --> 00:20:06,626
Those women who grimace,
they're all in my head.

250
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:11,193
- Hyang-sook too?
- Hyang-sook?

251
00:20:11,302 --> 00:20:14,169
Hyang-sook. You always
followed her around.

252
00:20:14,272 --> 00:20:17,673
- Hyang-sook is pretty.
- Oh yeah, she's pretty.

253
00:20:17,775 --> 00:20:20,972
But Hyang-sook
grimaced too, huh?

254
00:20:21,078 --> 00:20:22,909
She said, "Fuck, get away!"
Didn't she?

255
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,778
Because you liked her.

256
00:20:25,883 --> 00:20:27,510
So you killed her, huh?

257
00:20:36,093 --> 00:20:37,958
By the train tracks.

258
00:20:38,062 --> 00:20:39,791
In that rice paddy.

259
00:20:39,897 --> 00:20:42,457
The train tracks? Right.

260
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:46,264
Her throat. Hyang-sook's throat...

261
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,862
...strangled it tightly.

262
00:20:50,508 --> 00:20:52,408
- With what?
- Her brassiere.

263
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,071
With her white brassiere,

264
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,707
strangled her tightly.

265
00:20:59,817 --> 00:21:01,444
- And then?
- Her stocking.

266
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:04,419
- Her stocking?
- Pulled off her leg.

267
00:21:04,522 --> 00:21:05,955
Then it was the stocking.

268
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:09,515
This guy's smart, huh?

269
00:21:09,627 --> 00:21:10,685
And then?

270
00:21:10,795 --> 00:21:12,695
What?

271
00:21:12,797 --> 00:21:15,766
What was it?

272
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:18,494
Something with a strap?

273
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,302
A handbag strap?

274
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,701
Right, a bag strap.

275
00:21:21,806 --> 00:21:30,145
Strangling Hyang-sook's
throat with it tightly.

276
00:21:31,048 --> 00:21:32,572
And?

277
00:21:32,984 --> 00:21:39,355
Then, Hyang-sook's
body shook a bit.

278
00:21:39,457 --> 00:21:41,687
She looked completely dead.

279
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:43,992
And then?

280
00:21:45,229 --> 00:21:50,223
Her head was covered up.

281
00:21:50,334 --> 00:21:51,665
With what?

282
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:59,699
Her panties. Covered her
head with her panties.

283
00:22:00,378 --> 00:22:03,245
Do you mean a girdle?
That women wear?

284
00:22:03,347 --> 00:22:05,406
Right, girdle!

285
00:22:05,516 --> 00:22:10,852
Looked like it covered
her head right up.

286
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,888
And then?

287
00:22:13,824 --> 00:22:16,884
Um... had to dress her again.

288
00:22:16,994 --> 00:22:18,894
And why was that?

289
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,728
I don't know.
Put the clothes back on.

290
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:24,698
Why was that?

291
00:22:29,707 --> 00:22:31,504
How would I know?

292
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:33,167
You were doing well!

293
00:22:33,277 --> 00:22:35,541
Bastard! What did you do next?

294
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,011
- Then... running!
- Where?

295
00:22:37,114 --> 00:22:39,048
- It was raining!
- Where did you run?

296
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:43,109
- Kept running.
- Oh, you little shit!

297
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,654
The lightning struck!

298
00:22:45,756 --> 00:22:48,156
Where the hell were you
running, you bastard!

299
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:50,921
Yong-gu, start digging.

300
00:22:51,028 --> 00:22:52,655
Huh? Digging?

301
00:22:52,763 --> 00:22:54,355
Lightning!

302
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,319
Citizens, this is a
civil defence drill.

303
00:23:19,423 --> 00:23:22,290
The air raid siren
has begun to sound.

304
00:23:22,393 --> 00:23:24,827
This is only a drill.

305
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:29,457
The entire country is now
under a civil defence drill.

306
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:37,269
A blackout is called for
in all buildings and houses.

307
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:42,108
Follow the instructions
you hear in this broadcast.

308
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:48,550
Please move all flammable
materials to a safe place.

309
00:23:48,652 --> 00:23:53,919
Unplug all cords, then hurry
to an underground area...

310
00:24:01,699 --> 00:24:04,361
Shut off the lights!

311
00:24:20,385 --> 00:24:22,410
Hey, you!

312
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,420
Come here.

313
00:24:26,891 --> 00:24:28,791
Put this on.
Everyone ready?

314
00:24:28,893 --> 00:24:31,487
Get in the car.

315
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:33,188
Turn around.

316
00:24:33,297 --> 00:24:35,697
"Lee Hyang-sook"

317
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,961
Take off your pants.

318
00:24:40,171 --> 00:24:41,229
What'll the headline be?

319
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:44,797
"Crime-Fighting Trio" or
"Smiles of the Unstoppable."

320
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:46,934
Inspector Park, in the back.

321
00:24:47,045 --> 00:24:49,980
Make a straight line now.

322
00:24:50,882 --> 00:24:54,181
Miss Kwon, big party tonight!
Reserve a room.

323
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:55,650
Smile!

324
00:24:56,087 --> 00:25:00,080
This time, hold up your fist.
Tight!

325
00:25:01,192 --> 00:25:05,128
- Come take a picture!
- That's okay.

326
00:25:05,229 --> 00:25:07,060
Come on!

327
00:25:11,702 --> 00:25:13,363
Wait a second.

328
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:23,713
With these webbed fingers,

329
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:27,080
you can't even hold
chopsticks, right?

330
00:25:27,185 --> 00:25:30,177
They've always been this way?
Go on.

331
00:25:38,729 --> 00:25:41,357
Kwang-ho, this is the spot, right?

332
00:25:41,466 --> 00:25:42,398
I don't know.

333
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,196
What's he talking about?
It was here.

334
00:25:46,637 --> 00:25:49,663
For the re-enactment,
you have to act well.

335
00:25:49,774 --> 00:25:52,607
There are a lot of reporters here.

336
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,678
How's this?

337
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:56,303
A bit lower.

338
00:25:56,614 --> 00:25:58,912
- What do we start with?
- Wait.

339
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:04,181
It's best to write down
the correct order.

340
00:26:04,288 --> 00:26:06,882
Then why didn't you do it?
I'm fucking busy.

341
00:26:07,258 --> 00:26:08,190
Chief.

342
00:26:09,093 --> 00:26:13,120
The re-enactment
isn't going to work anyway.

343
00:26:13,231 --> 00:26:16,291
Becomes an embarrassment.

344
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,064
Hey, I told you to stay away.
Why'd you come back here?

345
00:26:21,172 --> 00:26:24,164
Just give them some excuse.
The suspect is sick, or...

346
00:26:24,275 --> 00:26:25,742
Inspector Suh!

347
00:26:26,577 --> 00:26:29,842
You're dumping shit
on cooked rice here!

348
00:26:29,947 --> 00:26:33,075
I told you before,
Kwang-ho isn't guilty.

349
00:26:33,184 --> 00:26:34,651
Just shut up!

350
00:26:34,986 --> 00:26:36,385
Chief...

351
00:26:36,487 --> 00:26:40,924
The cords around their necks
were tied with three tight knots.

352
00:26:41,025 --> 00:26:44,290
Look at Kwang-ho's hands.
Could he do that?

353
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:46,226
- Get out!
- Even a child can see that.

354
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,991
Get the hell out!

355
00:26:50,868 --> 00:26:51,664
Grab the brassiere strap...

356
00:26:51,769 --> 00:26:53,293
Hey, concentrate!

357
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,770
Dad!

358
00:26:55,873 --> 00:26:57,135
Kwang-ho! It's me!

359
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,869
Dad!

360
00:26:59,977 --> 00:27:03,743
Hey, you're innocent!

361
00:27:04,282 --> 00:27:09,618
I know! I didn't do it!

362
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:24,266
Mr. Baek Kwang-ho!
Are you denying a crime?

363
00:27:24,368 --> 00:27:27,565
He didn't kill anyone!
My son's innocent!

364
00:27:27,672 --> 00:27:33,076
You were tortured, weren't you?

365
00:27:33,177 --> 00:27:34,337
My team never tortures suspects.

366
00:27:37,014 --> 00:27:38,811
It's all gone to hell.

367
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:41,316
Don't bring it up.

368
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:47,289
Hey, did you see the look on
prosecutor Choi's face back there?

369
00:27:47,391 --> 00:27:50,758
Fuck, how can he
revoke the warrant?

370
00:27:51,028 --> 00:27:52,427
We even had evidence.

371
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:55,556
Evidence? That footprint?

372
00:27:57,735 --> 00:28:00,101
How can they set him free?

373
00:28:00,204 --> 00:28:02,604
What can we do?

374
00:28:02,707 --> 00:28:05,904
All we had was a confession.

375
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:09,969
It was no ordinary confession.
You heard the tape.

376
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:15,144
All the details of the crime
came pouring out his mouth.

377
00:28:15,253 --> 00:28:19,383
Things he'd never know
if he weren't the killer.

378
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,118
Like how she was strangled.

379
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,994
You heard it too.

380
00:28:25,096 --> 00:28:28,259
Be honest, didn't you
rehearse that in advance?

381
00:28:28,366 --> 00:28:29,458
What?

382
00:28:29,567 --> 00:28:31,535
Quiet. Eat something.

383
00:28:31,636 --> 00:28:33,570
Jesus...

384
00:28:35,273 --> 00:28:43,180
What? I said to separate
the noodles and bean sauce.

385
00:28:43,981 --> 00:28:46,449
What the fuck!

386
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:51,648
Investigative Team Reshuffled

387
00:28:51,756 --> 00:28:56,420
Murder Case Shrouded
In Mystery Once Again

388
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:18,170
The location of
the first homicide,

389
00:29:18,282 --> 00:29:20,375
and the second homicide.

390
00:29:20,484 --> 00:29:24,944
Now, a distance of...

391
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:26,455
approximately 1000 meters.

392
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:30,152
A length of not more
than... one kilometer.

393
00:29:38,436 --> 00:29:43,806
The victim, on the
12th and the 16th,

394
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:48,607
both days at twelve o'clock...

395
00:29:48,713 --> 00:29:52,149
Ah, December 16th.

396
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,080
On December 16th,

397
00:29:54,185 --> 00:29:56,779
at twelve o'clock,

398
00:29:57,355 --> 00:30:01,052
Location: Yangji Teahouse,

399
00:30:01,158 --> 00:30:04,025
Han Sung-geun

400
00:30:04,128 --> 00:30:07,723
a 32-year old office worker.

401
00:30:08,499 --> 00:30:12,868
An arranged date, maybe?

402
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:17,304
Anyway, at the crime site

403
00:30:17,408 --> 00:30:21,970
...were found a footprint,
two drops of blood,

404
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:26,345
...and a drop of semen.
Semen? They found semen?

405
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,441
What? Yes.

406
00:30:31,989 --> 00:30:34,116
The two dead women...

407
00:30:34,225 --> 00:30:36,557
Did they have
anything in common?

408
00:30:38,696 --> 00:30:40,254
In common...

409
00:30:40,364 --> 00:30:42,229
Well, first...

410
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:46,360
Both of them were single.

411
00:30:47,538 --> 00:30:50,837
They were both
extremely beautiful.

412
00:30:50,941 --> 00:30:52,169
And?

413
00:30:54,245 --> 00:30:57,214
The murders all
took place in the rain.

414
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:58,576
Rain?

415
00:30:59,216 --> 00:31:01,377
He murdered them
on rainy nights.

416
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,819
Really?

417
00:31:04,221 --> 00:31:05,984
And red clothes.

418
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:08,820
They all wore red clothes.

419
00:31:08,926 --> 00:31:10,951
Both of them?

420
00:31:11,061 --> 00:31:13,825
No, all three of them.

421
00:31:14,298 --> 00:31:16,095
Three of them?

422
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,667
What are you talking about?

423
00:31:17,768 --> 00:31:21,431
Three were murdered.
We just haven't found the third body.

424
00:31:25,576 --> 00:31:28,875
This is a missing person form.
The name is quite unusual.

425
00:31:28,979 --> 00:31:33,006
Dokko Hyun-soon, age 27.
It was two months ago, July 18.

426
00:31:33,117 --> 00:31:37,144
Oh, her? Dokko Hyun-soon?
I know that girl.

427
00:31:37,254 --> 00:31:40,690
Everyone in this town knows her.

428
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:43,658
A pretty girl,
that Hyun-soon.

429
00:31:43,761 --> 00:31:47,288
Even a Miss Korea
is no match for her.

430
00:31:47,565 --> 00:31:50,762
Did you process the missing
person form, Yong-gu?

431
00:31:50,868 --> 00:31:52,301
Oh, shut up.

432
00:31:52,403 --> 00:31:55,566
This is no ordinary incident, Chief.

433
00:31:55,673 --> 00:31:59,507
If you look in detail.
Documents never lie.

434
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:03,637
It says she was
wearing a red shirt.

435
00:32:03,747 --> 00:32:05,612
It's right here in writing.

436
00:32:05,983 --> 00:32:07,143
What's that?

437
00:32:07,518 --> 00:32:11,648
Marked here is the weather
on the day she vanished.

438
00:32:11,755 --> 00:32:14,053
It rained on that day too.

439
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:18,455
Rain, red clothes...

440
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:21,395
She was murdered.
By the same person.

441
00:32:21,499 --> 00:32:25,196
You don't know this town,
that's why you talk nonsense.

442
00:32:25,302 --> 00:32:29,636
She always said she'd
go to Seoul one day...

443
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,004
I have an idea where the body is.

444
00:32:32,109 --> 00:32:33,542
Look at the map.

445
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:37,575
Right here...

446
00:32:37,681 --> 00:32:41,139
I marked where the victim went,
and where the body might be.

447
00:32:43,354 --> 00:32:47,518
Give me two squadrons of
cops. I'll find her in two days.

448
00:32:50,528 --> 00:32:51,825
You sure of this?

449
00:33:11,749 --> 00:33:12,875
You know...

450
00:33:12,983 --> 00:33:16,817
...university students,
when they go on orientation...

451
00:33:16,921 --> 00:33:19,719
people say they
guys all get laid,

452
00:33:19,823 --> 00:33:24,817
a big group, guys and girls,
in one room going at it...

453
00:33:24,929 --> 00:33:26,726
Is that true?

454
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,355
I don't know. Hurry up.

455
00:33:30,701 --> 00:33:34,137
You went to a 2-year
school, didn't you?

456
00:33:34,238 --> 00:33:38,698
Student trips, orientation...
Did you go on those?

457
00:33:40,544 --> 00:33:44,503
Go ask Suh, he went
to a 4-year university.

458
00:33:44,615 --> 00:33:46,276
Whether he had group sex...

459
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:49,648
Shit, four years.

460
00:33:50,087 --> 00:33:52,612
I spent 4 years in high school.

461
00:33:56,293 --> 00:33:58,853
Shit, put that away.

462
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:05,835
You know, I miss
Dokko Hyun-soon.

463
00:34:05,936 --> 00:34:06,903
You too?

464
00:34:07,871 --> 00:34:11,807
She was just
too good for this town.

465
00:34:13,143 --> 00:34:16,135
I'm telling you, she
went to Seoul.

466
00:34:17,715 --> 00:34:20,115
What is it?

467
00:34:20,618 --> 00:34:21,880
Lot of snakes down there.

468
00:34:27,658 --> 00:34:30,525
Each part of a corpse
decays at a different speed.

469
00:34:30,628 --> 00:34:32,653
Look. It's old,

470
00:34:32,763 --> 00:34:35,789
but the inner thigh is still firm.

471
00:34:36,734 --> 00:34:38,531
There's evidence of rape?

472
00:34:38,936 --> 00:34:40,665
A bit of semen was found.

473
00:34:42,006 --> 00:34:45,407
But it's so old, we can't
determine the blood type.

474
00:34:45,509 --> 00:34:47,841
Oh, Hyun-soon...

475
00:34:48,278 --> 00:34:52,374
This time too he used
items belonging to her.

476
00:34:52,483 --> 00:34:55,577
Right, that's her stocking
around the throat?

477
00:34:55,686 --> 00:34:56,846
Yes.

478
00:34:57,154 --> 00:35:00,089
The victim's panties
on her face,

479
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,317
as with Hyang-sook.

480
00:35:02,426 --> 00:35:04,826
Her hands were bound
the same way too.

481
00:35:04,928 --> 00:35:09,661
His methods of killing
are quite professional.

482
00:35:10,034 --> 00:35:12,002
He's thorough.

483
00:35:12,102 --> 00:35:13,797
And polished.

484
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:21,808
So there hasn't been
a single witness yet.

485
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,916
Would you like
a bit more tenderloin?

486
00:35:27,017 --> 00:35:29,451
That's okay. We're fine.

487
00:35:29,553 --> 00:35:32,954
Where did Kwang-ho go?
I don't see him.

488
00:35:33,057 --> 00:35:35,992
Is anything...?

489
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:40,530
I bought your son something,
give it to him later.

490
00:35:40,631 --> 00:35:42,189
What's this?

491
00:35:42,299 --> 00:35:46,099
Oh, last time, taking a
look at his sneakers,

492
00:35:46,203 --> 00:35:49,434
they smelled so awful,
I felt bad for him.

493
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:53,271
I thought, I'll have to buy
him new shoes.

494
00:35:53,377 --> 00:35:55,174
So I picked up some Nikes.

495
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:57,577
You didn't have to...

496
00:35:58,415 --> 00:36:01,748
That punk, he's always sleeping
in the strangest places!

497
00:36:05,022 --> 00:36:06,284
Kwang-ho!

498
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:10,622
This here...
your shoe size is 250mm, right?

499
00:36:10,728 --> 00:36:13,424
Here, Nike. Try them on.

500
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:17,793
Give me that sneaker.

501
00:36:17,901 --> 00:36:22,031
These are "Nice", not Nike.
N, I, C, E.

502
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:25,540
Nice or Nike. Who cares?

503
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:31,808
If you buy him sneakers,
you should get the real thing.

504
00:36:31,915 --> 00:36:33,883
Cool, huh?

505
00:36:38,789 --> 00:36:39,778
Have a drink.

506
00:36:41,058 --> 00:36:43,526
I beat you because
I care for you.

507
00:36:43,627 --> 00:36:47,563
So if you see me on the
street, don't run away.

508
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:52,431
Yong-gu feels bad about...

509
00:36:53,337 --> 00:36:54,304
Punk.

510
00:36:59,943 --> 00:37:02,810
Hey, where are you going again?

511
00:37:03,614 --> 00:37:05,844
You see, Chief.

512
00:37:05,949 --> 00:37:10,648
That boy is the exact opposite
of the type we're looking for.

513
00:37:10,754 --> 00:37:14,918
Dragging in suspects like that
is a waste of time, so...

514
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:15,855
Inspector Suh!

515
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:20,291
Have some meat
before you speak.

516
00:37:25,102 --> 00:37:27,161
I don't eat burnt meat.

517
00:37:31,508 --> 00:37:34,534
"You said you'd come back to me"

518
00:37:34,611 --> 00:37:40,914
"Like the singing swallows"

519
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:48,218
"On the hills, singing birds
and blooming flowers"

520
00:37:48,292 --> 00:37:54,026
"Alone on the hill"

521
00:37:58,101 --> 00:37:58,897
Sir?

522
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:09,769
Hey, Seoul city bumpkin.

523
00:38:12,816 --> 00:38:14,078
What?

524
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:16,886
Why did you come here?

525
00:38:16,987 --> 00:38:21,083
Out to the boondocks?

526
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,984
To catch the killer.

527
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,434
Is Seoul that big?

528
00:38:33,637 --> 00:38:34,968
Huh? Is it big?

529
00:38:37,374 --> 00:38:38,841
Bigger than America?

530
00:38:41,144 --> 00:38:43,977
Give me a banana.

531
00:38:47,484 --> 00:38:50,453
Let me tell you about America.

532
00:38:51,688 --> 00:38:54,316
They've got the F.B.I.!

533
00:38:55,225 --> 00:38:58,524
If you watch how they
investigate... You know how?

534
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:04,199
Their heads are
spinning like a top.

535
00:39:04,902 --> 00:39:07,393
Analyzing things...

536
00:39:07,504 --> 00:39:09,597
You know why?

537
00:39:10,774 --> 00:39:14,266
It's 'cause they got so
much fucking land!

538
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:21,877
If you don't use your brain,
it's too much ground to cover.

539
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:26,820
So they have no choice,
those F.B.I. Bastards.

540
00:39:27,357 --> 00:39:31,760
But our Republic of Korea...

541
00:39:32,262 --> 00:39:37,598
using just your two legs,
you can run all over it.

542
00:39:37,701 --> 00:39:39,134
You know why?

543
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:43,530
'Cause our land's
the size of my dick.

544
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:49,545
So it's said, Korean detectives
investigate with their feet.

545
00:39:49,646 --> 00:39:53,742
That's folk wisdom,
you bastard.

546
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:57,411
So brainy geeks like you
can go the hell to America.

547
00:39:57,521 --> 00:40:01,150
- Go there and...
- Shut your fucking mouth!

548
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:06,325
You bastard!

549
00:40:07,264 --> 00:40:09,960
- Let go of me!
- What? You f...

550
00:40:18,275 --> 00:40:19,242
Give him this.

551
00:40:23,647 --> 00:40:26,013
Take it away! Take it!

552
00:40:34,091 --> 00:40:37,492
Everything's clearer now.
That's much better.

553
00:40:40,864 --> 00:40:44,925
I've got it now.
About the killer.

554
00:40:45,035 --> 00:40:47,629
That bastard,

555
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:50,707
he'll do it again.

556
00:40:50,807 --> 00:40:53,435
The next night it rains.

557
00:40:53,543 --> 00:40:58,310
So we need to keep
one step ahead of him.

558
00:40:58,415 --> 00:41:01,680
Pre-emptive!
Okay?

559
00:41:03,487 --> 00:41:08,049
And if you two ever start
fighting in front of me again,

560
00:41:08,158 --> 00:41:11,650
I'll kill you both! Understood?

561
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:28,543
Ladies and gentlemen!

562
00:41:28,645 --> 00:41:29,634
In just a moment,

563
00:41:29,746 --> 00:41:31,839
our President will be

564
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:34,508
driving past. Wait a minute...

565
00:41:54,071 --> 00:41:56,130
It's raining nice.

566
00:41:57,808 --> 00:41:59,070
You ready?

567
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:38,947
Ooh, Gui-ok's looking nice!

568
00:42:39,049 --> 00:42:40,038
Shut up.

569
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:45,813
What if he grabs her for real?

570
00:42:45,922 --> 00:42:51,883
Inspector Suh should be
following close behind her.

571
00:42:51,995 --> 00:42:58,457
Shit, do we have to do
this every time when it rains?

572
00:42:59,102 --> 00:43:00,797
But thanks to this,

573
00:43:00,904 --> 00:43:03,304
Gui-ok puts on that red skirt.

574
00:43:03,406 --> 00:43:07,274
With makeup, she looks
like a different person.

575
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:09,273
- So what?
- Was she always that pretty?

576
00:43:09,379 --> 00:43:10,505
You getting hard?

577
00:43:10,614 --> 00:43:12,582
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Let's check.

578
00:43:12,682 --> 00:43:14,912
- We're on duty now...
- Oh, Yong-gu!

579
00:43:23,593 --> 00:43:24,890
Hey.

580
00:43:25,962 --> 00:43:27,725
So do you really
keep watch here?

581
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:32,033
These days, nobody
ever goes outside.

582
00:43:34,204 --> 00:43:35,466
Someone's coming.

583
00:43:36,973 --> 00:43:39,373
Hey, kids!

584
00:43:41,044 --> 00:43:41,908
Over here.

585
00:43:45,682 --> 00:43:46,979
That's cold.

586
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,414
You're so wet!

587
00:43:51,588 --> 00:43:55,524
Hey, stay here
until the rain stops.

588
00:43:55,992 --> 00:43:57,619
That umbrella's useless.

589
00:43:57,727 --> 00:43:59,695
And we just picked it up
in front of the school.

590
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:02,321
Someone threw it away.

591
00:44:03,567 --> 00:44:05,125
Miss, are you going
that way too?

592
00:44:05,235 --> 00:44:06,896
Hey, she's a detective.

593
00:44:07,003 --> 00:44:08,766
No way!

594
00:44:08,872 --> 00:44:11,170
She's in the
Violent Crimes Division.

595
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:13,242
- Really?
- Sure.

596
00:44:13,343 --> 00:44:15,709
Wait a minute.
We'll give you a ride.

597
00:44:15,812 --> 00:44:18,007
Wow, in a police car!

598
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:23,108
Hey, you two. What are
you doing out so late?

599
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,415
We always stay together,
so it's okay.

600
00:44:25,522 --> 00:44:29,151
You'll be fine
even if you go alone.

601
00:44:31,595 --> 00:44:35,793
Nam-ju, tell them about
what you heard at school.

602
00:44:35,899 --> 00:44:36,923
What?

603
00:44:37,033 --> 00:44:39,593
You know, during cleaning
time, about the murderer.

604
00:44:39,703 --> 00:44:43,799
Right! You know why they
can't catch the murderer?

605
00:44:43,907 --> 00:44:46,899
This is the truth. We go to
Ansong Girls Middle School.

606
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:48,841
Behind our school,
there's an outhouse.

607
00:44:48,945 --> 00:44:52,972
They say a crazy man lives
under there, the murderer!

608
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:54,516
He stays there all day,

609
00:44:54,618 --> 00:44:57,678
and when night comes,
he sneaks out and kills women.

610
00:44:57,787 --> 00:45:01,484
So when he comes out at night,

611
00:45:01,591 --> 00:45:05,049
you must be able to smell
the shit from miles away.

612
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:08,221
That's not the story.

613
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:11,767
Yoo-jin said a crazy woman
fell in there and died.

614
00:45:12,035 --> 00:45:16,267
Then I'll meet you in front of
the factory with an umbrella.

615
00:45:16,373 --> 00:45:19,968
It's okay.

616
00:45:20,076 --> 00:45:21,600
Okay.

617
00:45:21,711 --> 00:45:25,340
I'll see you soon.

618
00:45:34,791 --> 00:45:41,890
Don't leave me.

619
00:45:41,998 --> 00:45:47,994
"I still love you.
Walking by myself..."

620
00:47:41,584 --> 00:47:42,573
Hello?

621
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:48,590
Everyone stay where you are!

622
00:47:48,691 --> 00:47:53,321
Don't touch anything near you.
Don't move one step!

623
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:54,954
Hey, you!

624
00:47:55,064 --> 00:47:56,292
I'm talking to you!

625
00:47:56,399 --> 00:47:58,799
Wait for the forensics team.

626
00:48:11,047 --> 00:48:12,605
Look!

627
00:48:12,715 --> 00:48:15,183
These are genuine footprints.

628
00:48:16,252 --> 00:48:19,813
You see the
Remicon factory there?

629
00:48:19,923 --> 00:48:23,916
He caught her near the factory,

630
00:48:24,027 --> 00:48:28,088
and quietly pulled her
over 400 meters to here.

631
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:34,327
The footprints look
like a bride and groom's.

632
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:41,776
But you didn't find anything,
aside from the footprints?

633
00:48:41,878 --> 00:48:46,281
I hoped to find fingerprints on
the umbrella, but no luck.

634
00:48:47,183 --> 00:48:49,708
Not only that, due to the rain,

635
00:48:49,819 --> 00:48:52,049
the footprints are all smudged.

636
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:57,792
Even after such a thorough
investigation, nothing.

637
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:05,563
Therefore, Chief, I think
this could be a hint. Hint!

638
00:49:05,668 --> 00:49:07,192
What?

639
00:49:07,303 --> 00:49:12,331
The fact that we found
nothing at the scene.

640
00:49:13,943 --> 00:49:16,104
Always in rape cases,

641
00:49:16,212 --> 00:49:18,942
at the crime scene,

642
00:49:19,048 --> 00:49:23,678
there's one or two of
those hairs left behind.

643
00:49:23,786 --> 00:49:25,310
So?

644
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:31,549
I'm saying the criminal must not
have any hair down there.

645
00:49:31,661 --> 00:49:33,424
You mean hairless?

646
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:37,864
That's right, hairless.
A total baldie.

647
00:49:39,469 --> 00:49:44,907
He can't leave hair behind,
because he doesn't have any?

648
00:49:48,098 --> 00:49:52,000
Hey Gui-ok, you've got
the radio on over there.

649
00:49:54,404 --> 00:49:56,668
How would you like your coffee?

650
00:49:56,773 --> 00:49:58,798
Lots of sugar for me.

651
00:49:59,442 --> 00:50:02,070
- Inspector Suh!
- Yes, sir?

652
00:50:02,178 --> 00:50:05,944
Do you have any more ideas?

653
00:50:06,216 --> 00:50:08,980
I don't know.
As you saw today,

654
00:50:09,085 --> 00:50:11,485
this criminal is flawless.

655
00:50:11,588 --> 00:50:13,522
- So?
- Therefore,

656
00:50:13,623 --> 00:50:17,184
our standard procedures
aren't going to help.

657
00:50:17,294 --> 00:50:20,229
So what are we going to do?

658
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,833
Excuse me, but I've
got something to show you.

659
00:50:30,307 --> 00:50:33,037
What will she show us today?

660
00:50:35,979 --> 00:50:36,968
What's this?

661
00:50:37,681 --> 00:50:40,616
These are documents
from an FM radio station.

662
00:50:40,717 --> 00:50:43,618
Looks like a
broadcast schedule.

663
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:48,123
Yes, it's an evening music
program I listen to.

664
00:50:48,224 --> 00:50:53,389
There's someone who keeps
requesting the song, "Sad Letter".

665
00:50:53,797 --> 00:50:56,698
If you look, it lists the dates
this song was broadcast.

666
00:50:57,634 --> 00:51:01,968
Actually, this isn't a very
popular song. It's quite rare.

667
00:51:02,072 --> 00:51:03,630
A song? What letter?

668
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:07,403
"Sad Letter"
The singer is Yu Jae-ha.

669
00:51:08,712 --> 00:51:10,077
Jo Young-pil's band.

670
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,648
- Sure, I heard it.
- So?

671
00:51:14,751 --> 00:51:20,383
The song was broadcast on the
same days of the murders here.

672
00:51:22,926 --> 00:51:23,893
Look.

673
00:51:24,928 --> 00:51:27,556
October 20.
That's Park Bo-hee's murder.

674
00:51:28,131 --> 00:51:33,262
December 19
was Lee Hyang-sook.

675
00:51:33,703 --> 00:51:34,829
So...

676
00:51:34,938 --> 00:51:39,307
...on last night's murder too,
this song was broadcast?

677
00:51:39,409 --> 00:51:43,038
Yes. I listened to it myself.

678
00:51:43,413 --> 00:51:47,679
Containing the request.

679
00:51:47,784 --> 00:51:51,379
"Sent by a lonely man
from Terung District."

680
00:51:51,488 --> 00:51:53,718
"Please broadcast it
on a rainy day."

681
00:51:57,427 --> 00:52:00,191
Miss Kwon, nice! Good idea!

682
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:03,863
You read too many mystery
novels as a student?

683
00:52:04,534 --> 00:52:06,968
That was a nice story.

684
00:52:08,238 --> 00:52:11,332
Chief, this can't
be a coincidence.

685
00:52:11,441 --> 00:52:13,306
Look at this.
Documents never lie.

686
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:16,311
Christ, here we go again.

687
00:52:16,413 --> 00:52:20,247
It seems he's a real psycho.

688
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:24,252
As soon as he hears the song,
he goes crazy.

689
00:52:24,354 --> 00:52:27,653
Oh Chief, now you're doing
it too. This makes no sense!

690
00:52:27,757 --> 00:52:30,419
It does make sense, sir!
It's quite simple.

691
00:52:30,527 --> 00:52:35,123
Assemblies start with the
National Anthem. It's the same.

692
00:52:35,231 --> 00:52:36,892
Did you get the postcard?

693
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,730
I requested it,

694
00:52:39,836 --> 00:52:42,464
but the radio station's
a bit disorganized.

695
00:52:44,674 --> 00:52:47,609
Find it quickly.
Check the postmark,

696
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:49,075
fingerprints and handwriting.

697
00:52:49,179 --> 00:52:50,237
Yes, sir!

698
00:52:50,647 --> 00:52:54,447
Officer Kwon, call the station
and follow up on this.

699
00:53:00,323 --> 00:53:01,517
Baldies!

700
00:53:02,258 --> 00:53:04,692
- What about that?
- Huh?

701
00:53:04,794 --> 00:53:06,887
What we mentioned before...

702
00:53:06,996 --> 00:53:08,759
Hairless, sir!

703
00:53:08,865 --> 00:53:10,696
How do you investigate?

704
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,826
Pull the pants off passing men?

705
00:53:26,416 --> 00:53:31,080
The postcard from yesterday.
I asked you to keep it!

706
00:53:31,187 --> 00:53:32,984
What postcard?

707
00:53:33,089 --> 00:53:37,423
You read it on the air yesterday!
Look how many we get here!

708
00:53:39,696 --> 00:53:40,788
Hey, mister!

709
00:53:42,232 --> 00:53:44,097
Nothing. Get dressed.

710
00:53:44,667 --> 00:53:47,500
Inspector.

711
00:53:47,604 --> 00:53:50,971
They've already
carted off yesterday's trash.

712
00:53:51,074 --> 00:53:53,235
It's no use.

713
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:09,951
You're not going to shower?

714
00:54:12,228 --> 00:54:15,459
Enough showers, for god's sake.

715
00:54:15,565 --> 00:54:19,331
My skin feels like it'll burst.

716
00:54:19,969 --> 00:54:22,233
You couldn't find
any hairless men?

717
00:54:25,008 --> 00:54:29,035
Like looking for dog's horns.
Just paid sauna fees.

718
00:54:29,145 --> 00:54:31,511
Shit, can't even get reimbursed.

719
00:54:31,948 --> 00:54:34,382
At least your face is clean.

720
00:54:37,487 --> 00:54:40,650
How many times in a day...
dressing, undressing, dressing...

721
00:54:40,757 --> 00:54:42,315
I'll lose my hair there too.

722
00:54:48,331 --> 00:54:51,061
I asked the workers
at the sauna there,

723
00:54:51,167 --> 00:54:53,226
to call me if they saw anyone,

724
00:54:53,336 --> 00:54:58,968
Bastards just smirked at me.

725
00:55:00,543 --> 00:55:04,502
Don't do it all yourself,
have someone else do it.

726
00:55:07,684 --> 00:55:11,552
What's that guy from Seoul
doing these days?

727
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:17,223
- Researching pop songs.
- What?

728
00:55:18,561 --> 00:55:20,688
Shit, it's nothing
you've heard of.

729
00:55:21,064 --> 00:55:23,396
Is he still talking nonsense?

730
00:55:24,701 --> 00:55:26,828
Driving me crazy.

731
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:32,403
If you feel that way,
go see a shaman.

732
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:33,807
A shaman?

733
00:55:34,544 --> 00:55:38,036
Sure, one that
tells fortunes well.

734
00:55:38,615 --> 00:55:42,779
Ask her where the
murderer is hiding.

735
00:55:50,593 --> 00:55:52,891
A problem at the main gate
of the police station.

736
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:58,192
It should be moved about
10m to the southwest.

737
00:56:00,336 --> 00:56:04,932
A face just passed by me.
I think he's the one.

738
00:56:11,948 --> 00:56:16,009
Is his face among
these pictures here?

739
00:56:16,919 --> 00:56:19,649
Take those dirty photos away.

740
00:56:20,423 --> 00:56:22,891
- Hey, just look...
- Put them away!

741
00:56:24,761 --> 00:56:26,456
It's bad fortune.

742
00:56:29,165 --> 00:56:34,660
- Take this, and do what I say.
- Don't try to sell that charm.

743
00:56:53,523 --> 00:56:55,991
Wait, wait a minute.

744
00:56:59,562 --> 00:57:02,725
You have to mix in dirt
from the crime scene.

745
00:57:03,566 --> 00:57:04,555
Stir.

746
00:57:06,035 --> 00:57:08,060
She said that
was most important.

747
00:57:09,205 --> 00:57:10,297
Now pour it.

748
00:57:15,411 --> 00:57:16,639
Stop.

749
00:57:19,015 --> 00:57:20,312
Good.

750
00:57:28,057 --> 00:57:29,991
Once this dries,

751
00:57:30,093 --> 00:57:35,121
this stain will form the
shape of the murderer's face.

752
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:36,926
That's ridiculous.

753
00:57:37,033 --> 00:57:39,092
Quiet, you'll break the charm.

754
00:57:39,202 --> 00:57:40,829
Know how much this costs?

755
00:57:41,537 --> 00:57:43,232
So shut up!

756
00:57:50,046 --> 00:57:51,138
Who's that?

757
00:57:53,716 --> 00:57:55,013
Don't you know?

758
00:57:55,518 --> 00:57:58,078
Criminals always return
to the crime scene.

759
00:58:33,288 --> 00:58:34,516
Wait a sec.

760
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,123
What's he doing here?

761
00:58:40,228 --> 00:58:41,923
Why'd he come?

762
00:58:57,512 --> 00:59:00,640
What the fuck...

763
00:59:00,749 --> 00:59:05,652
We need science here!

764
00:59:05,988 --> 00:59:07,512
What the hell's that?

765
00:59:14,596 --> 00:59:16,461
Still, he's got style.

766
01:01:36,296 --> 01:01:37,285
Stop there!

767
01:01:39,265 --> 01:01:40,254
Hey, you!

768
01:02:02,355 --> 01:02:03,686
It's getting narrow!

769
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:05,155
Single file!

770
01:02:29,682 --> 01:02:32,378
Miss, did a strange man
just run past here?

771
01:02:32,485 --> 01:02:35,283
No.

772
01:02:35,388 --> 01:02:37,822
- It's that policeman.
- What?

773
01:02:37,924 --> 01:02:40,859
- At the guard post.
- You know him?

774
01:02:41,561 --> 01:02:45,429
Damn, he's a
fast little bastard.

775
01:02:46,866 --> 01:02:48,265
He's not there?

776
01:02:52,305 --> 01:02:55,468
Did you check the
alleys properly?

777
01:02:55,575 --> 01:02:57,634
You think you
know this village?

778
01:02:58,644 --> 01:03:00,271
You stepped on a
stick back there.

779
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:02,871
A stick or a shit pile, who cares?

780
01:03:02,965 --> 01:03:04,956
He stepped on it.

781
01:03:11,674 --> 01:03:13,301
What?

782
01:03:13,743 --> 01:03:15,404
Over there... Hey, you!

783
01:03:26,555 --> 01:03:29,890
Stop!

784
01:03:35,297 --> 01:03:38,391
Jesus, not again.

785
01:03:40,035 --> 01:03:42,026
Hey, over there.

786
01:04:09,799 --> 01:04:12,461
Black clothes, black clothes...

787
01:04:12,968 --> 01:04:14,936
Everyone's in black except you.

788
01:04:26,482 --> 01:04:28,245
Everybody stop!

789
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:33,850
Don't move an inch!

790
01:04:57,847 --> 01:04:59,610
- Inspector Jo!
- Yes?

791
01:05:01,584 --> 01:05:02,573
Gather them together.

792
01:05:06,321 --> 01:05:07,948
Hey, stop.

793
01:05:08,057 --> 01:05:09,888
Gather together.

794
01:05:11,093 --> 01:05:12,117
Lift up your heads.

795
01:05:13,028 --> 01:05:14,325
Everyone stand in line.

796
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:34,781
Look in my eyes.

797
01:05:36,452 --> 01:05:37,646
Give me that.

798
01:05:50,299 --> 01:05:52,392
What is it?

799
01:05:55,337 --> 01:05:56,770
You bastard!

800
01:05:56,872 --> 01:05:58,897
- Give me your hands!
- What are you doing?

801
01:05:59,007 --> 01:06:03,376
You ran away from us?

802
01:06:25,501 --> 01:06:27,093
But...

803
01:06:27,203 --> 01:06:31,003
Is jerking off a crime?

804
01:06:31,106 --> 01:06:33,438
It's not a crime.

805
01:06:33,542 --> 01:06:35,942
Why'd you run away?

806
01:06:36,045 --> 01:06:40,038
Someone jumped out
of the woods and ran at me,

807
01:06:40,149 --> 01:06:42,140
so I panicked.

808
01:06:42,251 --> 01:06:46,745
Sure, but why'd you go
all the way out there to do it?

809
01:06:46,856 --> 01:06:50,314
There are kids at home,

810
01:06:50,426 --> 01:06:53,918
and the air's nice in the woods.

811
01:06:54,029 --> 01:06:58,591
Or did you go back to
fantasize about the dead girls?

812
01:06:59,802 --> 01:07:05,968
Your husband likes
to go out at night, huh?

813
01:07:08,611 --> 01:07:09,771
What's this?

814
01:07:10,846 --> 01:07:11,778
Gimme that.

815
01:07:16,151 --> 01:07:17,914
What did you make these with?

816
01:07:33,669 --> 01:07:36,229
These days, you know,

817
01:07:36,338 --> 01:07:42,106
real events in our town are
stronger than the magazines.

818
01:07:42,211 --> 01:07:45,009
When I read the newspaper,

819
01:07:45,114 --> 01:07:47,412
I start fantasizing.

820
01:07:47,516 --> 01:07:49,643
I ask myself why I do this,

821
01:07:49,752 --> 01:07:56,316
but when will this
chance come again?

822
01:07:56,425 --> 01:07:58,950
According to neighbors,

823
01:07:59,061 --> 01:08:01,859
he looks diligently
after his sick wife,

824
01:08:01,964 --> 01:08:04,057
never misses a week at church,

825
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:07,067
that he's honest.

826
01:08:08,504 --> 01:08:10,597
All perverts are like that.

827
01:08:10,706 --> 01:08:12,674
Nice on the outside.

828
01:08:12,775 --> 01:08:15,767
But my eyes can't be fooled.

829
01:08:15,878 --> 01:08:17,709
One look, and I know.

830
01:08:21,584 --> 01:08:22,414
Honey,

831
01:08:22,518 --> 01:08:25,453
I put socks in here.
Change them after dinner.

832
01:08:25,554 --> 01:08:27,112
Don't forget, or they'll smell.

833
01:08:27,222 --> 01:08:30,214
I'll take care of it.
Go feed the kids.

834
01:08:31,126 --> 01:08:33,185
Watch out for protesters.

835
01:08:35,297 --> 01:08:38,824
Release Jo Byung-soon!

836
01:08:38,934 --> 01:08:39,696
What now?

837
01:08:39,802 --> 01:08:41,827
I heard Byung-soon
confessed last night.

838
01:08:41,937 --> 01:08:43,199
Who says so?

839
01:08:43,305 --> 01:08:45,500
Oh, Chief!

840
01:08:49,612 --> 01:08:51,546
When will you make
an announcement?

841
01:08:51,647 --> 01:08:54,707
We know nothing.
Just wait a bit more.

842
01:08:54,817 --> 01:08:57,377
You've held him 4 days
without a warrant.

843
01:08:57,486 --> 01:09:00,353
People are saying he's
detained illegally.

844
01:09:00,623 --> 01:09:05,651
This time be realistic,
like in a movie.

845
01:09:06,729 --> 01:09:07,718
Go!

846
01:09:08,764 --> 01:09:10,459
You did a good job just now.

847
01:09:10,566 --> 01:09:11,590
Yong-ku?

848
01:09:15,904 --> 01:09:19,806
So, you were hiding
behind the outhouse,

849
01:09:19,908 --> 01:09:21,535
and you saw
Park Myung-ja

850
01:09:21,644 --> 01:09:25,307
coming towards you
with a flashlight, right?

851
01:09:25,414 --> 01:09:29,145
Yes, yes, yes. It seems so.

852
01:09:30,586 --> 01:09:33,146
Not it seems,
you bastard, be precise!

853
01:09:39,094 --> 01:09:40,618
I think I dreamed it that way.

854
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:46,290
Anyway, I snuck up behind her,

855
01:09:46,402 --> 01:09:54,673
and I must have chopped
the back of her neck?

856
01:09:54,777 --> 01:09:56,608
With my hand like this.

857
01:09:56,712 --> 01:09:57,610
Next?

858
01:09:58,414 --> 01:10:03,579
Myung-ja cried out, and I
guess she collapsed?

859
01:10:03,686 --> 01:10:10,387
So I laid her on the ground,
and was about to take her,

860
01:10:10,492 --> 01:10:13,757
Hey, it didn't
happen there, it was...

861
01:10:13,862 --> 01:10:18,925
The pine grove!
I took her there.

862
01:10:19,034 --> 01:10:21,764
It was from the rice paddies
to the pine grove.

863
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:25,806
According to the news, more
than 200 meters, right?

864
01:10:25,908 --> 01:10:27,535
That's so far!

865
01:10:27,643 --> 01:10:31,841
So the rain was pouring, and I
dragged her through the mud.

866
01:10:31,947 --> 01:10:33,346
And then?

867
01:10:33,449 --> 01:10:37,180
So I threw her down
in the pine grove.

868
01:10:37,286 --> 01:10:39,811
Then I strangled her.

869
01:10:39,922 --> 01:10:42,254
- With what?
- The bag strap.

870
01:10:42,357 --> 01:10:43,790
Really?

871
01:10:43,892 --> 01:10:45,860
Her stocking!

872
01:10:47,563 --> 01:10:49,861
Right.

873
01:10:49,965 --> 01:10:53,731
Brassiere. A Venus brassiere.

874
01:10:53,836 --> 01:11:01,242
I wrapped it around
her throat like this,

875
01:11:01,343 --> 01:11:03,038
So the woman,

876
01:11:03,145 --> 01:11:08,378
she took a rock and
clocked me in the head.

877
01:11:08,484 --> 01:11:10,111
Where'd she hit you?

878
01:11:10,219 --> 01:11:15,054
Right here, next to my eye.

879
01:11:15,157 --> 01:11:19,924
It still hurts, even if
it was just a dream.

880
01:11:31,106 --> 01:11:35,440
Byung-soon, are you gonna
keep saying it was a dream?

881
01:11:35,544 --> 01:11:38,240
That's enough.
Turn your head.

882
01:11:40,415 --> 01:11:42,076
So this bruise is from the rock?

883
01:11:42,184 --> 01:11:44,744
- No, this guy here...
- Shut up! Look here.

884
01:11:49,024 --> 01:11:53,358
You've done well,
now let's finish this.

885
01:11:55,898 --> 01:11:57,365
So...

886
01:11:57,466 --> 01:12:01,027
Since she hit me
like this with the rock,

887
01:12:01,136 --> 01:12:03,866
I must have lost consciousness?

888
01:12:03,972 --> 01:12:09,274
And after lying there a while,
I woke up, and looking around...

889
01:12:09,378 --> 01:12:10,675
And?

890
01:12:10,779 --> 01:12:15,773
I was in the bottom
of an outhouse! A shithouse!

891
01:12:15,884 --> 01:12:20,321
And maggots were
creeping all over the place!

892
01:12:20,422 --> 01:12:24,017
Not the outhouse again.
So after brushing them off,

893
01:12:24,126 --> 01:12:28,563
I grabbed some straw,
and pulled myself up.

894
01:12:28,664 --> 01:12:31,861
Even in a dream, it's hard.

895
01:12:31,967 --> 01:12:33,628
But then I saw,

896
01:12:33,735 --> 01:12:38,434
this wasn't someone's home,
it was a school toilet.

897
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:41,031
Walking to the playground,

898
01:12:41,143 --> 01:12:44,738
I saw huge swarms of girls,

899
01:12:44,847 --> 01:12:48,681
so many, and the smell...

900
01:12:48,784 --> 01:12:50,012
Wait! Over here.

901
01:12:53,355 --> 01:12:56,290
Where did you hear about
that school outhouse?

902
01:12:57,292 --> 01:13:00,728
Everyone knows that story.

903
01:13:00,829 --> 01:13:03,457
I saw it in a dream.

904
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:09,269
From below the gas attack,
run in a direction...

905
01:13:09,371 --> 01:13:11,805
...perpendicular to the wind.

906
01:13:11,907 --> 01:13:14,171
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

907
01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:16,405
Put it down. Hey!

908
01:13:27,155 --> 01:13:28,053
Pretend you're dead!

909
01:13:32,194 --> 01:13:36,392
Last time, who told you that
story about the outhouse?

910
01:13:36,498 --> 01:13:38,329
You came because of that?

911
01:13:43,705 --> 01:13:44,433
What's wrong?

912
01:13:44,539 --> 01:13:46,666
I hurt myself in the chute.

913
01:13:46,775 --> 01:13:48,743
There was a pebble in there.

914
01:13:50,545 --> 01:13:52,513
Where's the nurse?

915
01:13:54,216 --> 01:13:55,478
I'll put it on for you.

916
01:13:56,418 --> 01:13:57,715
I'll do it.

917
01:13:59,021 --> 01:14:01,046
Shy? You're just a kid.

918
01:14:01,156 --> 01:14:02,054
Sit down.

919
01:14:06,962 --> 01:14:07,758
Give it to me.

920
01:14:10,632 --> 01:14:11,997
Lift up your shirt.

921
01:14:13,001 --> 01:14:16,767
Think about what I asked you.

922
01:14:19,174 --> 01:14:23,770
The murderer in the outhouse,
coming out at night...

923
01:14:23,879 --> 01:14:27,645
Who might have
told that story first...

924
01:14:27,749 --> 01:14:29,080
How would I know?

925
01:14:29,184 --> 01:14:36,056
It's like asking who
made up the elephant jokes.

926
01:14:36,158 --> 01:14:38,956
Why don't you go to
the outhouse yourself?

927
01:14:39,461 --> 01:14:42,259
Do I look like
I have time for that?

928
01:15:33,281 --> 01:15:35,010
Even still...

929
01:15:35,117 --> 01:15:38,177
Some kids talk, so you
snoop around the outhouse?

930
01:15:38,286 --> 01:15:39,651
You got that much time?

931
01:15:40,255 --> 01:15:41,449
Giving me a heart attack.

932
01:15:41,556 --> 01:15:42,887
Investigating...

933
01:15:42,991 --> 01:15:46,859
Is investigating such a dirty job?

934
01:15:49,164 --> 01:15:53,396
Ah! Is that why they
made up the rumor?

935
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:58,033
I saw her myself
once or twice.

936
01:15:58,140 --> 01:15:59,129
That woman.

937
01:15:59,241 --> 01:16:00,674
Who?

938
01:16:01,376 --> 01:16:02,638
A crying woman.

939
01:16:04,012 --> 01:16:05,104
When was it?

940
01:16:06,114 --> 01:16:09,845
I was in the outhouse then too,

941
01:16:09,951 --> 01:16:12,579
when I heard a woman crying.

942
01:16:13,188 --> 01:16:15,452
When I came out,

943
01:16:15,557 --> 01:16:19,118
there was a woman
working on that hill,

944
01:16:19,227 --> 01:16:21,092
who kept crying.

945
01:16:22,864 --> 01:16:25,025
A woman was crying?

946
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:26,164
Yes.

947
01:16:27,335 --> 01:16:29,235
She kept crying on that hill.

948
01:16:30,439 --> 01:16:32,100
It just seemed strange.

949
01:16:52,461 --> 01:16:53,189
Hello?

950
01:16:56,398 --> 01:16:57,228
Excuse me.

951
01:17:00,035 --> 01:17:01,832
Are you the person
who lives here?

952
01:17:04,406 --> 01:17:05,373
Who are you?

953
01:17:07,642 --> 01:17:10,338
I'd like to ask something.
I heard that...

954
01:17:13,949 --> 01:17:14,938
Wait!

955
01:17:16,351 --> 01:17:17,545
Look here.

956
01:17:18,019 --> 01:17:20,647
- I'm a policeman.
- Really?

957
01:17:21,690 --> 01:17:25,353
You can't stay there.
Someone might see.

958
01:17:27,295 --> 01:17:28,728
There's no one here.

959
01:17:33,735 --> 01:17:34,667
Go, please.

960
01:17:35,470 --> 01:17:36,459
I beg you.

961
01:17:48,583 --> 01:17:52,417
Be assured this will
remain a secret.

962
01:17:53,455 --> 01:17:56,788
As we're both women,

963
01:17:56,892 --> 01:18:00,555
tell me everything
comfortably and in detail.

964
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:06,197
That night,

965
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,372
a light rain was falling.

966
01:18:15,343 --> 01:18:16,469
When was it?

967
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:20,638
It was...

968
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:26,353
last September.

969
01:18:36,431 --> 01:18:40,595
I had read all the articles...

970
01:18:40,702 --> 01:18:42,897
...about the women killed.

971
01:18:45,774 --> 01:18:50,336
The methods he used
were exactly the same.

972
01:18:51,846 --> 01:18:57,910
It was the same with me.

973
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:05,592
You saw his face?

974
01:19:06,394 --> 01:19:08,988
I tried not to on purpose,

975
01:19:09,097 --> 01:19:11,190
keeping my chin down.

976
01:19:13,134 --> 01:19:14,692
My panties covered my head,

977
01:19:15,904 --> 01:19:17,838
but I closed my eyes tight.

978
01:19:19,474 --> 01:19:22,773
If I saw him,
he'd have killed me.

979
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:29,739
I don't know about the rest,
but one thing I remember.

980
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:32,687
His hands were very soft.

981
01:19:33,855 --> 01:19:36,187
The hand over my mouth,

982
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:38,623
was delicate,

983
01:19:38,727 --> 01:19:40,058
just like a woman's.

984
01:20:14,095 --> 01:20:17,121
We're done. Let's get
ourselves some sleep.

985
01:20:18,033 --> 01:20:20,365
Once we get
your seal, it's done.

986
01:20:21,970 --> 01:20:23,870
It's all as you said.

987
01:20:25,206 --> 01:20:26,434
Sound good?

988
01:20:27,575 --> 01:20:29,736
Yes, of course.

989
01:20:30,645 --> 01:20:33,079
Oh, it's finally over, right?

990
01:20:33,415 --> 01:20:34,575
Please let me down. Please.

991
01:20:41,423 --> 01:20:42,890
Let him go.
He's not the murderer.

992
01:20:43,525 --> 01:20:44,321
What?

993
01:20:45,593 --> 01:20:47,891
Byung-soon, are
you the murderer?

994
01:20:47,996 --> 01:20:49,987
Yes, sir, yes...

995
01:20:50,565 --> 01:20:52,294
Shut up.
No you're not.

996
01:20:52,701 --> 01:20:54,259
I think I am...

997
01:20:54,369 --> 01:20:55,666
Let him go!

998
01:20:57,439 --> 01:20:59,964
Write down everything she said...

999
01:21:00,075 --> 01:21:00,905
Hey!

1000
01:21:01,009 --> 01:21:02,943
You toying with me?

1001
01:21:03,411 --> 01:21:05,072
Are you having fun?

1002
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:08,180
I caught the murderer, OK?

1003
01:21:08,283 --> 01:21:10,513
What do you mean,
you caught him?

1004
01:21:14,656 --> 01:21:17,216
Did you hang him
from the ceiling?

1005
01:21:17,325 --> 01:21:19,020
Well, he kept lying, and...

1006
01:21:19,127 --> 01:21:21,891
Get hold of yourself.
Those journalists...

1007
01:21:21,996 --> 01:21:23,827
- Chief!
- Those goddamned bastards!

1008
01:21:29,504 --> 01:21:31,131
Stop!

1009
01:21:33,141 --> 01:21:34,039
Listen.

1010
01:21:37,145 --> 01:21:37,907
What is that?

1011
01:21:39,581 --> 01:21:42,072
- Is it live?
- It's being broadcast now?

1012
01:21:42,183 --> 01:21:43,582
Yes, it's live.

1013
01:21:53,194 --> 01:21:56,686
First, declare a
state of emergency.

1014
01:21:56,798 --> 01:22:00,097
And send me two
garrisons of men.

1015
01:22:00,535 --> 01:22:03,595
Because our
intelligence says so!

1016
01:22:03,972 --> 01:22:07,373
Tonight. There'll
be a murder tonight.

1017
01:22:07,876 --> 01:22:10,276
Hello, I need to
speak to producer Im...

1018
01:22:11,045 --> 01:22:12,171
What? He quit?

1019
01:22:13,214 --> 01:22:14,511
Get me the A.D. Now.

1020
01:22:15,116 --> 01:22:18,950
The song that was just
played, "Sad Letter".

1021
01:22:19,287 --> 01:22:21,482
Read the name and
address of the requester.

1022
01:22:21,956 --> 01:22:23,753
You must have the postcard.

1023
01:22:24,893 --> 01:22:26,087
What? Prank call?

1024
01:22:26,728 --> 01:22:29,561
It's the police, bastard!
Hello?

1025
01:22:29,998 --> 01:22:30,896
I'll go myself.

1026
01:22:31,699 --> 01:22:33,860
Are the garrisons coming?

1027
01:22:34,269 --> 01:22:36,362
They don't even have
one man available.

1028
01:22:37,872 --> 01:22:42,070
They went to suppress
a demonstration in Suwon city.

1029
01:23:14,542 --> 01:23:17,978
Name: Ahn Mi-seon, age 28.

1030
01:23:19,447 --> 01:23:25,079
Estimated time of death, last
night between 7:30 and 8:00.

1031
01:23:26,421 --> 01:23:32,326
When the two of you were
fighting like madmen. Right?

1032
01:23:35,063 --> 01:23:37,190
Wait a minute.

1033
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:40,695
There's something
in the vagina.

1034
01:23:53,548 --> 01:23:55,880
Looks like a peach.

1035
01:24:11,844 --> 01:24:13,243
Nine pieces.

1036
01:24:20,553 --> 01:24:25,388
Do you see this kind of
thing in Seoul often?

1037
01:24:27,827 --> 01:24:29,727
Never.

1038
01:24:32,698 --> 01:24:34,188
You were right.

1039
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:36,996
What?

1040
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:43,365
These guys were a waste
of time from the start.

1041
01:24:45,811 --> 01:24:46,835
Hey!

1042
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:49,338
A call from the radio station.

1043
01:24:49,915 --> 01:24:52,679
I think she found the postcard.

1044
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:57,084
I've got the postcard.
It has an address.

1045
01:24:57,790 --> 01:24:59,189
Can you write it down?

1046
01:25:00,226 --> 01:25:02,251
Jinan 1-ri, Terung District

1047
01:25:02,361 --> 01:25:05,023
#32. Park Hyun-gyu.

1048
01:25:39,999 --> 01:25:40,761
Who are you?

1049
01:25:42,835 --> 01:25:45,895
We're policemen.
Where has Park Hyun-gyu gone?

1050
01:25:46,505 --> 01:25:50,771
He works at the
factory at this time.

1051
01:26:16,168 --> 01:26:16,930
Hey, Hyun-gyu.

1052
01:26:17,403 --> 01:26:19,268
Park Hyun-gyu!

1053
01:26:21,974 --> 01:26:23,340
Park Hyun-gyu!

1054
01:26:52,338 --> 01:26:53,305
Show me your hands.

1055
01:27:03,182 --> 01:27:04,979
They're quite smooth.

1056
01:27:07,486 --> 01:27:09,681
How long have you
worked in the factory office?

1057
01:27:13,626 --> 01:27:15,218
From September last year.

1058
01:27:16,895 --> 01:27:21,355
A little before the first murder.

1059
01:27:25,504 --> 01:27:30,339
So after doing your military
service, you came to this town,

1060
01:27:30,442 --> 01:27:33,878
and the murders all
began taking place.

1061
01:27:33,979 --> 01:27:35,446
Right?

1062
01:27:36,915 --> 01:27:38,439
Park Hyun-gyu.

1063
01:27:39,485 --> 01:27:42,010
You sent this postcard
to the station.

1064
01:27:42,121 --> 01:27:42,985
Yes.

1065
01:27:43,555 --> 01:27:45,455
You sent several others too.

1066
01:27:45,557 --> 01:27:46,421
Yes.

1067
01:27:47,626 --> 01:27:50,618
You asked it to be
played on rainy days.

1068
01:27:50,729 --> 01:27:51,457
Yes.

1069
01:27:53,866 --> 01:27:57,927
"Sad Letter" You know that
each time this song played,

1070
01:27:58,037 --> 01:28:00,267
a woman was murdered?

1071
01:28:03,108 --> 01:28:04,040
No.

1072
01:28:06,812 --> 01:28:09,076
Look at the broadcast records.

1073
01:28:12,051 --> 01:28:12,949
Okay.

1074
01:28:14,453 --> 01:28:18,787
The song played yesterday?
"Sad Letter".

1075
01:28:19,124 --> 01:28:19,852
Yes.

1076
01:28:20,192 --> 01:28:22,726
You listened to the program?
- Yes.

1077
01:28:22,928 --> 01:28:26,955
Your song played at 7:08, and
the program finished at 8pm.

1078
01:28:27,066 --> 01:28:28,465
- You listened to the end?
- Yes.

1079
01:28:28,567 --> 01:28:30,398
- Continuously?
- Yes.

1080
01:28:30,502 --> 01:28:33,369
- What was the final song?
- I don't know.

1081
01:28:33,472 --> 01:28:35,463
- It was yesterday!
- I don't remember.

1082
01:28:35,574 --> 01:28:37,201
Because you went out!

1083
01:28:37,309 --> 01:28:38,401
I was home!

1084
01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:41,968
She was killed
between 7:30 and 8pm.

1085
01:28:42,081 --> 01:28:44,242
You weren't listening,
you went out!

1086
01:28:44,683 --> 01:28:45,513
Don't make me laugh.

1087
01:28:46,085 --> 01:28:49,350
You motherfucker.
Are you joking?

1088
01:28:49,455 --> 01:28:51,423
- Let go of him now!
- Hey!

1089
01:28:55,327 --> 01:28:56,316
Get back here!

1090
01:29:01,433 --> 01:29:07,133
Even kids in this town know
you torture innocent people.

1091
01:29:07,239 --> 01:29:08,763
Shut up, you!

1092
01:29:08,874 --> 01:29:09,898
Get back here!

1093
01:29:13,879 --> 01:29:15,471
Anyway, I won't be one of them.

1094
01:29:17,516 --> 01:29:18,949
Never.

1095
01:29:22,054 --> 01:29:24,386
Okay. Park Hyun-gyu.

1096
01:29:24,490 --> 01:29:28,950
You say you listened
at home to the end?

1097
01:29:29,695 --> 01:29:33,426
But you couldn't have
forgotten the last song.

1098
01:29:33,532 --> 01:29:37,559
Because the DJ introduced it

1099
01:29:37,669 --> 01:29:39,637
with some very striking words.

1100
01:29:40,272 --> 01:29:44,572
She mentioned you, and
the many postcards you sent.

1101
01:29:44,676 --> 01:29:48,976
If you heard it,
you couldn't have forgotten.

1102
01:29:49,081 --> 01:29:52,175
Tell me! If you really
listened to the end.

1103
01:29:53,485 --> 01:29:55,316
I don't remember.

1104
01:29:55,420 --> 01:29:56,978
You don't remember?

1105
01:29:57,990 --> 01:29:59,719
Should I explain it for you?

1106
01:30:03,695 --> 01:30:05,959
This is the recording of
yesterday's program.

1107
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,492
Last night, you sat
listening to this song.

1108
01:30:12,704 --> 01:30:16,902
Outside the rain was
pelting down, you listened,

1109
01:30:19,077 --> 01:30:21,739
and soon you started
itching with excitement.

1110
01:30:22,748 --> 01:30:26,707
There's something you always
do when you hear this song.

1111
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:33,224
You heard a TV program playing
in the room of your landlady,

1112
01:30:33,325 --> 01:30:38,228
you left the lights on in your
own room and crept outside.

1113
01:30:39,064 --> 01:30:44,832
And in the pitch dark,
you wandered here and there.

1114
01:30:44,937 --> 01:30:48,395
Who will it be today?

1115
01:30:49,541 --> 01:30:50,439
Right?

1116
01:30:52,477 --> 01:30:56,675
You hid in a reed field,
waiting for a woman to pass.

1117
01:30:56,915 --> 01:30:58,507
The rain drenching you.

1118
01:30:58,617 --> 01:31:01,245
But you find all this pleasurable.

1119
01:31:01,353 --> 01:31:02,843
Stimulating, right?

1120
01:31:03,488 --> 01:31:06,753
So yesterday you stuffed
this in that woman's body!

1121
01:31:09,194 --> 01:31:13,221
You remember how
many pieces it was?

1122
01:31:13,332 --> 01:31:15,163
One piece,

1123
01:31:15,234 --> 01:31:15,996
two...

1124
01:31:16,101 --> 01:31:17,898
- Three pieces...
- Shut up!

1125
01:31:18,003 --> 01:31:19,527
Four, five...

1126
01:31:19,638 --> 01:31:20,798
six, seven, eight...

1127
01:31:20,906 --> 01:31:22,396
Shut the fuck up!

1128
01:31:24,009 --> 01:31:28,469
Yong-gu!

1129
01:31:29,915 --> 01:31:32,645
I told you not to hit him.

1130
01:31:32,751 --> 01:31:36,278
Didn't I?

1131
01:31:36,755 --> 01:31:38,450
I warned you.

1132
01:31:38,557 --> 01:31:41,355
You know why
journalists snoop around here.

1133
01:31:41,793 --> 01:31:43,090
You stupid bastard.

1134
01:31:46,331 --> 01:31:50,825
Don't even think about coming
into the interrogation room again.

1135
01:32:04,816 --> 01:32:06,408
I'm going crazy.

1136
01:32:09,988 --> 01:32:12,821
No eyewitnesses,

1137
01:32:12,925 --> 01:32:14,790
not one piece of evidence.

1138
01:32:16,295 --> 01:32:18,729
We need something, shit.

1139
01:32:19,531 --> 01:32:23,297
Shit, we don't need
any damn witnesses.

1140
01:32:23,402 --> 01:32:25,233
Just a confession will do.

1141
01:32:25,971 --> 01:32:29,099
Just need to beat that
bastard to an inch of his life.

1142
01:32:32,044 --> 01:32:33,671
You've changed.

1143
01:32:36,281 --> 01:32:41,309
Try it and, you'll be disgraced.
Like with Kwang-ho.

1144
01:32:45,157 --> 01:32:47,591
Retarded Kwang-ho...

1145
01:32:51,163 --> 01:32:53,654
I always wanted to ask you.

1146
01:32:54,232 --> 01:32:56,996
When you dragged
him up the mountain,

1147
01:32:57,102 --> 01:33:03,507
he talked about Hyang-sook's
death in so much detail.

1148
01:33:04,309 --> 01:33:05,173
So?

1149
01:33:05,911 --> 01:33:10,746
Did you really not rehearse
that dialogue with him?

1150
01:33:10,849 --> 01:33:13,716
I told you I didn't!

1151
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:18,986
But how did he know the
way she was strangled...

1152
01:33:19,091 --> 01:33:20,319
That's my point!

1153
01:33:23,762 --> 01:33:26,856
The tape... Where's the tape
from the mountain?

1154
01:33:26,965 --> 01:33:28,899
Miss Kwon? Gui-ok.

1155
01:33:29,868 --> 01:33:33,736
Then, Hyang-sook's body shook a bit.

1156
01:33:33,839 --> 01:33:36,501
She looked completely dead.

1157
01:33:36,608 --> 01:33:38,542
Listen to how he speaks here.

1158
01:33:38,643 --> 01:33:43,546
Covered up Hyang-sook's head.

1159
01:33:43,648 --> 01:33:46,039
With what?
- Her panties.

1160
01:33:46,718 --> 01:33:51,314
Her head was covered
with her panties.

1161
01:33:51,423 --> 01:33:54,324
He's talking like
it was someone else.

1162
01:33:54,426 --> 01:33:55,654
And then?

1163
01:33:55,761 --> 01:34:00,755
He's describing what he saw.

1164
01:34:03,635 --> 01:34:05,296
Kwang-ho is the witness.

1165
01:34:17,616 --> 01:34:18,708
Where did Kwang-ho go?

1166
01:34:20,318 --> 01:34:21,808
Kwang-ho...

1167
01:34:23,121 --> 01:34:24,486
No, no. We came for a drink.

1168
01:34:25,123 --> 01:34:26,818
Some meat, please.

1169
01:34:29,094 --> 01:34:30,925
What are you doing here?

1170
01:34:40,038 --> 01:34:41,471
Control yourself, huh?

1171
01:34:42,707 --> 01:34:45,198
He's not in his room.
I'll check outside.

1172
01:34:46,078 --> 01:34:47,841
Try the game arcade.

1173
01:34:50,182 --> 01:34:52,013
How long have you been here?

1174
01:34:52,951 --> 01:34:57,047
Have you seen Kwang-ho?

1175
01:35:07,566 --> 01:35:10,501
It is now 23 months since
the incident first surfaced.

1176
01:35:10,602 --> 01:35:13,935
Before interrogating
Detective Moon...

1177
01:35:14,773 --> 01:35:17,640
They should cut off
all detective's dicks!

1178
01:35:17,742 --> 01:35:19,471
Nah, it's not worth it.

1179
01:35:19,578 --> 01:35:22,445
They are stupid bastards.

1180
01:35:22,547 --> 01:35:23,377
Be quiet.

1181
01:35:36,328 --> 01:35:39,229
The trial of detective Moon,
suspected of police torture

1182
01:35:39,331 --> 01:35:43,427
and sexual assault,
opened today.

1183
01:36:04,289 --> 01:36:06,416
You fucked your professor,
didn't you, bitch!

1184
01:36:06,525 --> 01:36:09,426
Your parents pay good money...

1185
01:36:12,464 --> 01:36:13,396
Hey, Yong-gu!

1186
01:36:48,099 --> 01:36:49,828
Kwang-ho!

1187
01:36:50,835 --> 01:36:54,327
Kwang-ho!
Don't run away!

1188
01:36:54,439 --> 01:36:55,428
Hey, Kwang-ho!

1189
01:36:56,241 --> 01:36:58,903
Kwang-ho!

1190
01:37:04,417 --> 01:37:06,510
Kwang-ho!

1191
01:37:08,321 --> 01:37:09,219
I'm sorry...

1192
01:37:09,322 --> 01:37:10,516
What's wrong with you?

1193
01:37:10,623 --> 01:37:12,750
We're not here to catch you.

1194
01:37:12,859 --> 01:37:14,087
Come down.

1195
01:37:15,361 --> 01:37:17,829
You're gonna kill me?

1196
01:37:17,931 --> 01:37:21,662
We'll forget that any of
that happened.

1197
01:37:21,768 --> 01:37:24,066
If a fight breaks out,
that can happen.

1198
01:37:24,170 --> 01:37:26,502
It's okay,

1199
01:37:26,606 --> 01:37:28,301
just come down, huh?

1200
01:37:28,408 --> 01:37:30,808
If I do, you'll kill me?

1201
01:37:30,910 --> 01:37:32,138
I know it.

1202
01:37:32,245 --> 01:37:35,112
We won't kill you,
just come down.

1203
01:37:35,214 --> 01:37:38,581
Okay, just stay there for now.
We've something to ask you.

1204
01:37:38,685 --> 01:37:41,620
You...

1205
01:37:41,721 --> 01:37:43,018
You remember Hyang-sook?

1206
01:37:43,122 --> 01:37:45,716
The girl that died.

1207
01:37:45,825 --> 01:37:48,623
Hyang-sook is pretty.

1208
01:37:49,562 --> 01:37:52,531
That's right. You used
to follow after her.

1209
01:37:52,632 --> 01:37:55,260
But that night,

1210
01:37:55,368 --> 01:37:59,498
when it rained,
you saw her killed, huh?

1211
01:38:00,206 --> 01:38:02,970
That? I told you already.

1212
01:38:03,076 --> 01:38:07,274
In the forest.
I told you already...

1213
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:11,282
You saw when Hyang-sook was
murdered, didn't you? Here?

1214
01:38:11,384 --> 01:38:13,716
Yeah, here.

1215
01:38:14,554 --> 01:38:17,546
The paddy next to
the train tracks.

1216
01:38:20,893 --> 01:38:22,292
That night,

1217
01:38:22,395 --> 01:38:25,455
did you see the killer's face?

1218
01:38:25,565 --> 01:38:28,227
- Yeah.
- Really?

1219
01:38:29,235 --> 01:38:30,896
Lightning, ka-rang!

1220
01:38:34,173 --> 01:38:37,404
I saw everything
from inside here.

1221
01:38:37,510 --> 01:38:41,571
So you saw his face?

1222
01:38:41,681 --> 01:38:43,410
Three times.

1223
01:38:44,751 --> 01:38:47,618
Do you remember him in detail?

1224
01:38:48,488 --> 01:38:49,853
He was handsome.

1225
01:38:50,990 --> 01:38:53,117
More than me.

1226
01:38:58,598 --> 01:39:00,896
Was this the face you saw?

1227
01:39:03,703 --> 01:39:04,965
Look at the picture.

1228
01:39:14,881 --> 01:39:17,315
You know how hot
that fire was?

1229
01:39:17,417 --> 01:39:19,248
Look at the photo!

1230
01:39:19,886 --> 01:39:21,945
It was so hot!

1231
01:39:22,055 --> 01:39:24,114
Snap out of it!

1232
01:39:24,557 --> 01:39:26,957
Here, look closely.

1233
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:29,620
Hot hot hot hot!

1234
01:39:29,729 --> 01:39:31,822
Look at the photo!

1235
01:39:31,931 --> 01:39:33,694
Hey. Kwang-ho.

1236
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:35,700
When I was young,

1237
01:39:35,802 --> 01:39:39,260
he threw me in the fire.
That man.

1238
01:39:39,072 --> 01:39:40,937
- Kwang-ho!
- You bastards!

1239
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:42,064
What the hell!

1240
01:39:42,175 --> 01:39:46,168
Please forgive him.

1241
01:39:46,246 --> 01:39:51,809
What are you students doing?

1242
01:39:51,918 --> 01:39:53,442
We're police!

1243
01:39:53,553 --> 01:39:55,521
Bullshit!
Then we're the F.B.I.!

1244
01:40:10,870 --> 01:40:12,030
Hey, Kwang-ho!

1245
01:40:12,772 --> 01:40:15,036
We're looking for you.

1246
01:40:16,109 --> 01:40:16,905
Hey!

1247
01:40:17,811 --> 01:40:20,006
A train's coming!
Come here!

1248
01:40:26,486 --> 01:40:28,181
Out of the way, quick!

1249
01:40:29,589 --> 01:40:30,954
It's dangerous there.

1250
01:40:31,391 --> 01:40:33,859
Out of the way! You idiot!

1251
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:36,758
Stay away. Go...

1252
01:41:15,569 --> 01:41:19,096
It's okay for you to be here?
They'll be looking for you.

1253
01:41:55,275 --> 01:41:56,765
Yes, yes.

1254
01:41:56,877 --> 01:42:00,574
Journalists tend
to be like that.

1255
01:42:01,048 --> 01:42:04,575
Sir, as I said last time...

1256
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:06,552
Hello?

1257
01:42:06,854 --> 01:42:07,786
Hello?

1258
01:42:08,522 --> 01:42:10,752
Assholes!

1259
01:42:10,858 --> 01:42:12,883
High-ranking bastards...

1260
01:42:13,494 --> 01:42:15,325
- Chief!
- What?

1261
01:42:15,829 --> 01:42:19,458
It's Investigative Crimes.
They found semen.

1262
01:42:19,733 --> 01:42:20,757
They found what?

1263
01:42:20,868 --> 01:42:22,358
Take a look.

1264
01:42:22,469 --> 01:42:25,370
The semen was found
on the victim's clothing.

1265
01:42:25,472 --> 01:42:29,738
Maybe he masturbated
on the corpse,

1266
01:42:29,843 --> 01:42:31,708
and semen fell on her clothes.

1267
01:42:31,812 --> 01:42:33,143
Wait.

1268
01:42:33,247 --> 01:42:34,942
So...

1269
01:42:35,049 --> 01:42:38,177
...if the DNA in this semen

1270
01:42:38,285 --> 01:42:41,083
is confirmed to match
that of Park Hyun-gyu,

1271
01:42:41,188 --> 01:42:47,320
then the game's over, isn't it?

1272
01:42:47,428 --> 01:42:50,761
Yes, that would be quite
strong evidence.

1273
01:42:51,131 --> 01:42:55,932
The problem is, we don't have
the technology in Korea

1274
01:42:56,036 --> 01:42:58,163
to carry out such tests.

1275
01:42:58,472 --> 01:43:00,497
It must be sent to America.

1276
01:43:00,607 --> 01:43:02,700
There's no other way.

1277
01:43:03,944 --> 01:43:07,573
Once the test's complete,
the results will be released.

1278
01:43:07,681 --> 01:43:11,117
So we just have to wait for
the documents from America?

1279
01:43:11,218 --> 01:43:12,185
That's right.

1280
01:43:13,587 --> 01:43:16,852
You sent people to
watch over Park Hyun-gyu?

1281
01:43:16,957 --> 01:43:20,916
Yes! They're watching
him 24 hours a day.

1282
01:43:21,662 --> 01:43:23,823
Once the result
comes in from America,

1283
01:43:23,931 --> 01:43:27,389
wait until we get our
hands on that bastard.

1284
01:43:43,650 --> 01:43:47,313
What's wrong with your leg?

1285
01:43:47,421 --> 01:43:48,615
Why?

1286
01:43:48,922 --> 01:43:50,048
Did you go to the hospital?

1287
01:43:50,157 --> 01:43:52,819
For this little scratch?
Come here.

1288
01:43:52,926 --> 01:43:55,360
It's okay.
I put on some medicine.

1289
01:43:56,130 --> 01:44:02,262
- What is that?
- Oh, that night...

1290
01:44:02,369 --> 01:44:03,734
It keeps swelling.

1291
01:44:04,004 --> 01:44:05,801
Come on, let's go.

1292
01:44:05,906 --> 01:44:06,838
Just get in.

1293
01:44:07,908 --> 01:44:11,036
So, you have to amputate?

1294
01:44:11,145 --> 01:44:13,511
Should I explain it again?

1295
01:44:13,614 --> 01:44:16,412
It was pierced, but why
cut off a healthy leg?

1296
01:44:16,517 --> 01:44:19,509
If you don't, he'll die.

1297
01:44:19,786 --> 01:44:23,278
Tetanus is a brutal thing.

1298
01:44:23,390 --> 01:44:26,416
For rusty nails, you need
to see a doctor fast.

1299
01:44:26,527 --> 01:44:28,995
Bunch of dim-witted boneheads.

1300
01:44:29,963 --> 01:44:34,525
Be grateful it's under the knee.

1301
01:44:35,869 --> 01:44:37,427
Crazy bastards.

1302
01:44:37,538 --> 01:44:38,436
Let's go.

1303
01:44:41,975 --> 01:44:42,873
Are you family?

1304
01:44:42,976 --> 01:44:45,570
He doesn't have any,
but I'm like his brother...

1305
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:47,476
Anyway, you came together, right?

1306
01:44:47,581 --> 01:44:51,608
The authorization for surgery.
Read it, then sign.

1307
01:45:09,603 --> 01:45:11,434
You fucker...

1308
01:45:26,653 --> 01:45:27,745
Hello, post office?

1309
01:45:28,789 --> 01:45:30,814
It's Suh Tae-yoon,
Investigative Crimes.

1310
01:45:32,326 --> 01:45:34,487
Have the documents
from America arrived?

1311
01:45:37,531 --> 01:45:39,089
Have you checked 100%?

1312
01:45:41,067 --> 01:45:44,059
I keep calling because
it's important!

1313
01:45:45,038 --> 01:45:49,634
Since it's so important, please
call as soon as it comes.

1314
01:45:53,346 --> 01:45:54,313
Hello?

1315
01:45:58,051 --> 01:45:59,040
Uh, now?

1316
01:46:00,820 --> 01:46:02,845
Why'd you call me out?

1317
01:46:02,956 --> 01:46:05,618
Why?
Can't I do that sometimes?

1318
01:46:06,626 --> 01:46:08,594
Your face looks worn,

1319
01:46:08,695 --> 01:46:09,753
Are you sleeping well?

1320
01:46:12,265 --> 01:46:14,233
What kind of
detective sleeps well?

1321
01:46:16,636 --> 01:46:17,967
What's wrong with you?

1322
01:46:18,071 --> 01:46:20,562
Fishing? Damn free-riders.

1323
01:46:25,178 --> 01:46:27,237
Why'd you call out a busy man?

1324
01:46:31,985 --> 01:46:34,215
You look like a corpse.

1325
01:46:37,690 --> 01:46:40,591
It may be no use asking,

1326
01:46:40,693 --> 01:46:42,217
but can you do anything else?

1327
01:46:44,531 --> 01:46:46,226
Can you quit your job?

1328
01:48:07,947 --> 01:48:09,041
Violent Crimes Dept!

1329
01:48:09,682 --> 01:48:10,649
Violent Crimes!

1330
01:48:11,251 --> 01:48:13,617
How many visits in one night?

1331
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:15,813
Is money that important?

1332
01:48:18,358 --> 01:48:21,452
Bo-kyung's grandmother
collapsed again. I have to go.

1333
01:48:21,995 --> 01:48:25,431
You deserve a medal.

1334
01:48:25,531 --> 01:48:27,829
Get one from
the Health Ministry.

1335
01:48:37,877 --> 01:48:39,037
Chief!

1336
01:48:39,145 --> 01:48:41,306
Park Hyun-gyu hasn't
come home for 2 hours.

1337
01:48:41,414 --> 01:48:44,747
It's only six stops from
there to his house.

1338
01:48:45,084 --> 01:48:47,075
So he must have gotten off.

1339
01:48:47,186 --> 01:48:49,711
Would a man under
investigation act so wild?

1340
01:48:49,822 --> 01:48:52,848
He's capable of it.

1341
01:48:52,959 --> 01:48:57,328
- He's instinctively crazy.
- You seem like the crazy one!

1342
01:48:57,430 --> 01:49:03,426
Once the DNA tests arrive,
he's through. Stop it.

1343
01:49:03,836 --> 01:49:06,361
I let him go...

1344
01:49:06,472 --> 01:49:09,202
Don't get so upset!

1345
01:50:50,343 --> 01:50:51,742
Citizens,

1346
01:50:51,844 --> 01:50:54,938
this is a civil defense drill.

1347
01:50:55,048 --> 01:51:01,954
A blackout is called for
in all buildings and houses...

1348
01:52:11,593 --> 01:52:15,256
Will you make any special
investigation into this incident?

1349
01:52:30,712 --> 01:52:33,510
A razor wound in the breast...

1350
01:52:36,351 --> 01:52:37,579
What the hell?

1351
01:52:39,387 --> 01:52:41,719
Something is stuck
inside of the vagina.

1352
01:52:43,091 --> 01:52:46,583
Huh?
Looks like a ball point pen,

1353
01:52:47,062 --> 01:52:48,393
and a spoon.

1354
01:52:50,198 --> 01:52:51,187
Jesus...

1355
01:52:54,536 --> 01:52:57,130
Look inside, closely.

1356
01:53:04,646 --> 01:53:06,671
Wait, what's that?

1357
01:53:07,616 --> 01:53:08,674
An old band-aid.

1358
01:53:23,332 --> 01:53:25,527
What are you doing?

1359
01:53:27,336 --> 01:53:29,600
Why are you touching a corpse?

1360
01:53:54,930 --> 01:53:55,924
What?

1361
01:53:59,468 --> 01:54:00,526
Get up, you bastard!

1362
01:54:08,276 --> 01:54:10,210
You fucker!

1363
01:54:13,949 --> 01:54:15,177
Get up, you fucker.

1364
01:54:20,355 --> 01:54:21,253
Are you human?

1365
01:54:34,369 --> 01:54:38,430
Nobody will care if I kill you.

1366
01:54:48,883 --> 01:54:50,043
Tell me!

1367
01:54:51,686 --> 01:54:53,244
Tell me you killed them!

1368
01:54:56,057 --> 01:54:57,285
Tell me!

1369
01:54:58,193 --> 01:55:01,026
You killed all those women!

1370
01:55:21,082 --> 01:55:22,845
Yeah.

1371
01:55:22,951 --> 01:55:26,478
I killed them.

1372
01:55:26,588 --> 01:55:28,215
I killed them all.

1373
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:34,425
That's what you want
to hear, right?

1374
01:55:35,797 --> 01:55:36,957
Right?

1375
01:55:38,399 --> 01:55:40,867
You feel better?

1376
01:55:45,173 --> 01:55:47,698
Inspector Suh!

1377
01:55:48,943 --> 01:55:51,036
The papers from America!

1378
01:55:51,813 --> 01:55:52,677
Read them!

1379
01:55:54,382 --> 01:55:55,713
You asshole.

1380
01:55:58,086 --> 01:55:58,882
You fucker!

1381
01:56:00,588 --> 01:56:01,748
You mocked us, didn't you!

1382
01:56:01,856 --> 01:56:03,517
You bastard!

1383
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:06,791
You mocked us!

1384
01:56:24,312 --> 01:56:25,142
What's wrong?

1385
01:56:57,612 --> 01:57:01,013
There's a mistake.

1386
01:57:09,924 --> 01:57:12,484
This document is a lie.
I don't need it.

1387
01:57:26,474 --> 01:57:28,806
What does it say, huh?

1388
01:57:37,085 --> 01:57:38,347
It really wasn't you?

1389
01:57:46,894 --> 01:57:48,088
Look in my eyes.

1390
01:58:19,894 --> 01:58:21,191
Look in my eyes!

1391
01:58:36,210 --> 01:58:37,768
Fuck, I don't know.

1392
01:58:45,286 --> 01:58:47,015
Do you get up each morning too?

1393
01:58:51,626 --> 01:58:52,558
Go!

1394
01:58:55,363 --> 01:58:57,297
Just go, fucker!

1395
01:59:01,202 --> 01:59:02,794
Bastard.

1396
02:00:12,373 --> 02:00:13,931
That's enough.

1397
02:00:54,682 --> 02:00:57,048
Chi-hyuk.

1398
02:00:57,151 --> 02:00:59,312
You played computer
games all night, right?

1399
02:01:00,855 --> 02:01:03,688
Did you or didn't you?

1400
02:01:08,496 --> 02:01:10,123
Look in my eyes, son.

1401
02:01:11,299 --> 02:01:12,789
Eyes all bloodshot.

1402
02:01:14,001 --> 02:01:15,662
Do you play well?

1403
02:01:15,770 --> 02:01:16,634
Yeah!

1404
02:01:16,938 --> 02:01:19,998
You don't study, might as
well be good at games.

1405
02:01:21,542 --> 02:01:25,603
If you won't study,
go get some exercise.

1406
02:01:25,713 --> 02:01:28,273
Sitting in front
of the computer...

1407
02:01:28,382 --> 02:01:29,906
I really didn't!

1408
02:01:30,184 --> 02:01:31,981
What do you mean you didn't?

1409
02:01:32,086 --> 02:01:34,213
Think you can fool my eyes?

1410
02:01:35,556 --> 02:01:38,252
He said he didn't.
Believe him.

1411
02:01:38,359 --> 02:01:44,628
No, two days ago Manager Oh
called my company.

1412
02:01:44,732 --> 02:01:48,998
He kept saying you can't do
this to people, it's not fair.

1413
02:01:49,470 --> 02:01:52,837
You can't believe him.

1414
02:01:53,508 --> 02:01:56,773
Did I do anything wrong?

1415
02:01:56,878 --> 02:02:01,247
I'm on the road now
with our product.

1416
02:02:02,917 --> 02:02:07,854
Sure, let's have dinner
with Manager Oh.

1417
02:02:08,623 --> 02:02:10,386
It's been a while.

1418
02:02:13,694 --> 02:02:16,356
Chul-yong!
Pull over a minute!

1419
02:03:54,662 --> 02:03:56,186
Is something in there?

1420
02:03:58,065 --> 02:03:59,498
Is anything in there?

1421
02:04:01,002 --> 02:04:02,367
No...

1422
02:04:03,704 --> 02:04:05,331
Then why are you looking?

1423
02:04:07,642 --> 02:04:09,303
I'm just looking.

1424
02:04:10,177 --> 02:04:12,111
That's so weird.

1425
02:04:13,848 --> 02:04:14,872
What is?

1426
02:04:16,717 --> 02:04:18,275
A while back,

1427
02:04:18,386 --> 02:04:22,516
a man was here
looking into that hole.

1428
02:04:26,327 --> 02:04:29,319
I asked him the same question.

1429
02:04:29,864 --> 02:04:31,889
Why he was looking there.

1430
02:04:31,999 --> 02:04:33,193
What did he say?

1431
02:04:34,502 --> 02:04:36,265
What was it?

1432
02:04:36,370 --> 02:04:38,031
Right...

1433
02:04:38,139 --> 02:04:42,405
He remembered doing
something here long ago,

1434
02:04:42,510 --> 02:04:46,207
so he came back
to take a look.

1435
02:05:00,127 --> 02:05:01,958
Did you see his face?

1436
02:05:07,334 --> 02:05:08,801
What did he look like?

1437
02:05:10,755 --> 02:05:11,915
Well...

1438
02:05:13,891 --> 02:05:15,358
Kind of plain.

1439
02:05:17,862 --> 02:05:18,760
In what way?

1440
02:05:22,033 --> 02:05:23,295
Just...

1441
02:05:25,603 --> 02:05:27,366
ordinary.

1442
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Subbed by PiGO
