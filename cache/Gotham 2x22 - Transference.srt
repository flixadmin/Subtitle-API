1
00:00:01,256 --> 00:00:02,255
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:02,291 --> 00:00:04,925
We're onto you, Professor Strange.

3
00:00:04,926 --> 00:00:05,803
Bad guys come in.

4
00:00:05,804 --> 00:00:06,836
Monsters come out.

5
00:00:06,872 --> 00:00:09,205
I am Firefly.

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,107
Selina.

7
00:00:11,142 --> 00:00:12,542
Hugo Strange has Selina.

8
00:00:14,312 --> 00:00:16,379
You remember your name?

9
00:00:16,414 --> 00:00:18,114
My name is Fish Mooney.

10
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:21,685
Make me a grilled cheese sandwich.

11
00:00:24,056 --> 00:00:25,922
You made me a sandwich.

12
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,857
- Why?
- I don't know.

13
00:00:27,893 --> 00:00:29,425
And how exactly do you plan
on getting into Arkham?

14
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:30,860
- I'll ask for a tour.
- From the man

15
00:00:30,896 --> 00:00:32,495
that ordered the assassination
of your father?

16
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,863
He'll want to find out what we know.

17
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,765
And we won't see me and
Lucius as a threat.

18
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:38,568
I call Bullock, he comes busting
in with a hundred cops.

19
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:41,304
Take them.

20
00:00:42,608 --> 00:00:45,875
Move everything you can
to the facility upstate.

21
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:48,878
You have an explosive device, use it.

22
00:00:48,914 --> 00:00:50,413
Destroy Indian Hill.

23
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:52,415
Basil is a chameleon of sorts.

24
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,683
Would you like to see?

25
00:01:01,192 --> 00:01:02,358
You son of a bitch!

26
00:01:02,393 --> 00:01:03,793
I'm Jim Gordon.

27
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:07,697
Right, go get our guys.

28
00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:14,804
No sign of Gordon.

29
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,239
How long do you want us to wait?

30
00:01:16,274 --> 00:01:17,874
Give him ten seconds.

31
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,244
If you don't see Jim, bust
that joint open and find him.

32
00:01:21,279 --> 00:01:22,712
Ready, entry team. We go on one.

33
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:23,813
Go.

34
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:24,881
Cover me.

35
00:01:37,796 --> 00:01:39,562
Go! Go!

36
00:01:39,597 --> 00:01:41,564
Four, three,

37
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,565
two...

38
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,501
Stand down!

39
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:48,237
- Stand down, Officers.
- Hold!

40
00:01:48,273 --> 00:01:49,572
Hold!

41
00:01:49,607 --> 00:01:51,007
Stand down.

42
00:01:51,043 --> 00:01:53,677
- All clear.
- Stand down! Stand down!

43
00:01:53,712 --> 00:01:55,244
"All clear"?

44
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,813
Sorry to waste your time, hoss.

45
00:01:56,848 --> 00:01:58,381
How about a ride to HQ?

46
00:01:58,416 --> 00:01:59,482
Sure thing, Jim.

47
00:01:59,517 --> 00:02:01,384
You okay?

48
00:02:01,419 --> 00:02:02,752
You look kind of hinky.

49
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:04,788
Never better.

50
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:09,592
Strange! Strange!

51
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:10,927
Strange!

52
00:02:10,962 --> 00:02:12,328
Strange, you son of a bitch!

53
00:02:12,363 --> 00:02:14,230
Come back here!

54
00:02:21,907 --> 00:02:23,439
So...

55
00:02:23,474 --> 00:02:25,175
you're really doing this?

56
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,409
Not my call.

57
00:02:26,444 --> 00:02:27,643
Prepare the patients for transport

58
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:29,779
to the upstate facility.

59
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:32,148
If even one of your patients
were to escape... They won't.

60
00:02:32,184 --> 00:02:34,217
The police won't be delayed much longer.

61
00:02:34,252 --> 00:02:35,685
Prepare the patients and move fast.

62
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:37,187
As soon as we're done
with Gordon and Wayne,

63
00:02:37,222 --> 00:02:38,554
we will detonate the bomb.

64
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,889
Yes, sir.

65
00:02:40,216 --> 00:02:43,130

67
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:54,704
Okay...

68
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,439
quiz kids,

69
00:02:56,474 --> 00:02:58,274
who's ready to play

70
00:02:58,309 --> 00:03:00,110
Life or Death?

71
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:01,444
Sir, Mr. Nygma.

72
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,812
You are Nygma, aren't you?

73
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:04,447
This is absurd.

74
00:03:04,482 --> 00:03:06,216
The police know we're here.
You can't kill us!

75
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:07,717
Are you ready to play?!

76
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,255
Yes.

77
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,723
Good.

78
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,091
You have one guess.

79
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:16,826
Five minutes to talk it over.

80
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:20,463
Who runs Indian Hill?

81
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:25,301
Who runs Indian Hill?

82
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:27,937
You have one guess.

83
00:03:27,973 --> 00:03:30,106
Think carefully, fellas.

84
00:03:30,142 --> 00:03:33,309
Answer correctly...

85
00:03:33,344 --> 00:03:35,011
or die.

86
00:03:36,285 --> 00:03:37,792
Strange!

87
00:03:37,828 --> 00:03:40,428
Strange?

88
00:03:40,464 --> 00:03:42,464
Hi.

89
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:48,370
What is that?

90
00:03:48,405 --> 00:03:50,071
Honesty serum.

91
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:51,973
I need to know what you know.

92
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:53,274
Wait.

93
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:55,343
Wait!

94
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,253
So, how do you feel now?

95
00:04:06,923 --> 00:04:08,890
Not good.

96
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:11,459
Can you be more specific?

97
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:15,096
I feel vulnerable.

98
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:16,598
Naked.

99
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:17,732
Your feelings are

100
00:04:17,768 --> 00:04:20,368
entirely natural and normal.

101
00:04:20,404 --> 00:04:23,471
There is nothing to be ashamed of.

102
00:04:23,507 --> 00:04:25,206
You are in a helpless situation.

103
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:26,741
There is nothing

104
00:04:26,777 --> 00:04:29,010
you can do.

105
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:31,212
Do you understand that?

106
00:04:31,247 --> 00:04:33,114
Yes.

107
00:04:34,217 --> 00:04:35,750
No.

108
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:36,951
No?

109
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:38,185
What can you do?

110
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:42,857
James, what can you do?

111
00:04:42,893 --> 00:04:44,793
Made a plan.

112
00:04:44,828 --> 00:04:46,594
Tell me your plan.

113
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,531
If I don't check in
with the GCPD by noon,

114
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:52,133
tell them I'm safe,

115
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:55,136
they'll come after you.

116
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:57,004
Yes.

117
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,773
Yes, I know.

118
00:04:58,809 --> 00:05:02,510
You did check in with the GCPD.

119
00:05:02,546 --> 00:05:04,879
Nobody's coming.

120
00:05:06,382 --> 00:05:09,484
You can relax.

121
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,792
Jim?

122
00:05:17,828 --> 00:05:19,461
Jim?

123
00:05:20,464 --> 00:05:22,697
Harv.

124
00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:23,765
Strange is clean?

125
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,833
What the hell happened?

126
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:26,634
Dead end.

127
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,169
"Dead end"?

128
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:30,004
What are you talking about, "dead end"?

129
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:32,106
He's connected.

130
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:34,075
So is my mechanic. Who isn't?

131
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,544
Connected to people we can't cross.

132
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,712
What people?

133
00:05:37,747 --> 00:05:39,714
You don't want to know.

134
00:05:41,017 --> 00:05:42,650
Trust me.

135
00:05:42,686 --> 00:05:44,519
You feeling all right?

136
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:46,087
You look like a sack of fish.

137
00:05:46,122 --> 00:05:47,555
A little flu, maybe.

138
00:05:48,336 --> 00:05:49,457
Well, then keep your distance.

139
00:05:49,493 --> 00:05:51,993
I'm getting laid this
weekend, fingers crossed.

140
00:05:54,664 --> 00:05:57,298
You have 60 seconds left.

141
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:00,034
Who runs Indian Hill?

142
00:06:02,873 --> 00:06:04,772
I say Hugo Strange.

143
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:06,374
Wayne Enterprises.

144
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:08,209
Wayne Enterprises runs Indian Hill.

145
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:09,377
- That's surmise.
- Why would he ask that question

146
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:10,745
if the answer was obvious?

147
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,380
He wants to know what we know.

148
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:13,349
What we think we know.

149
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,016
Which is Wayne Enterprises.

150
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:16,951
Is that your answer?
Running out of time here.

151
00:06:16,987 --> 00:06:18,019
Yes.

152
00:06:21,096 --> 00:06:22,557
Correct!

153
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:26,293
Wayne Enterprises runs Indian Hill.

154
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:28,396
Bravo, Brucie.

155
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:30,031
You're almost safe.

156
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:31,499
Just one more question.

157
00:06:31,535 --> 00:06:33,334
- You ready?
- Yes.

158
00:06:33,369 --> 00:06:34,602
You have five minutes, quiz kids.

159
00:06:34,638 --> 00:06:37,238
Answer correctly or die.

160
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:40,942
Wayne Enterprises runs
Indian Hill, but who runs

161
00:06:40,977 --> 00:06:43,511
Wayne Enterprises?

162
00:06:53,823 --> 00:06:56,257
Move 'em out in order
of security grades.

163
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:58,259
Lowest risk first.

164
00:06:58,294 --> 00:07:00,962
Tranq 'em, immobilize them,
and put them on the bus.

165
00:07:00,997 --> 00:07:02,430
And do it fast but very,

166
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:03,965
very carefully.

167
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,733
Security is our number one

168
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:06,901
priority.

169
00:07:06,937 --> 00:07:07,802
Yes, ma'am.

170
00:07:09,338 --> 00:07:10,471
Hey, lady.

171
00:07:10,506 --> 00:07:11,739
Busy day, busy day.

172
00:07:11,775 --> 00:07:14,275
We'll get to you, Number 13.

173
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,243
Your mama may be Number 13,

174
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,813
but I'm a human being.

175
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:21,816
Fish Mooney, bitch.

176
00:07:26,756 --> 00:07:31,325
Here you're Re-Animant
Test Case Number 13,

177
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,462
and I'm Ms. Peabody.

178
00:07:36,132 --> 00:07:39,634
And you'd best not talk about my mama.

179
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:42,637
Ms. Peabody,

180
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:45,239
I apologize.

181
00:07:45,274 --> 00:07:47,108
I'm a bit stressed.

182
00:07:47,143 --> 00:07:49,777
I don't like being locked up.

183
00:07:49,813 --> 00:07:52,279
It's against my nature.

184
00:07:52,315 --> 00:07:54,281
I understand. I do.

185
00:07:54,317 --> 00:07:56,417
But you are a priceless

186
00:07:56,452 --> 00:07:57,952
scientific miracle.

187
00:07:57,988 --> 00:08:00,655
You are history.

188
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,523
Seclusion is regrettable

189
00:08:02,558 --> 00:08:04,291
but inevitable.

190
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:06,961
Look, I've been here before.

191
00:08:06,997 --> 00:08:10,865
All you mad scientists say
the same kind of stuff.

192
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,900
I don't care.

193
00:08:12,936 --> 00:08:15,703
Let me go.

194
00:08:18,074 --> 00:08:20,508
Sorry, 13.

195
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:21,809
Let's go.

196
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:26,447
You're messing with the wrong woman!

197
00:08:26,482 --> 00:08:27,715
You hear me?

198
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:29,517
The wrong woman!

199
00:09:02,802 --> 00:09:03,968
Here?

200
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:06,434
A little too central, maybe.

201
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:09,437
You don't want one piece
to overpower the room.

202
00:09:09,472 --> 00:09:10,906
Try over there.

203
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:20,916
You're absolutely right.

204
00:09:20,951 --> 00:09:22,583
See? I told you she'd be useful.

205
00:09:22,619 --> 00:09:24,085
Isn't that better?

206
00:09:25,322 --> 00:09:27,222
Interior design ain't my thing.

207
00:09:27,257 --> 00:09:29,291
News on the hour with WTGC.

208
00:09:29,326 --> 00:09:32,093
Police sources say that
reports of an impending raid

209
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:34,629
on Arkham Insane Asylum and
its controversial chief,

210
00:09:34,664 --> 00:09:36,965
Professor Hugo Strange, are inaccurate.

211
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,967
Despite the disclaimers, flurries

212
00:09:39,002 --> 00:09:40,969
of police activity around
the troubled facility

213
00:09:41,004 --> 00:09:44,039
- have fueled rumors that
arrests are imminent... - Hugo

214
00:09:44,074 --> 00:09:45,707
Strange.

215
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:52,347
How interesting.

216
00:09:55,385 --> 00:09:57,118
Answer quickly, please, Jim.

217
00:09:57,154 --> 00:09:58,353
Without thinking. Who did

218
00:09:58,388 --> 00:09:59,955
you love more, your
mother or your father?

219
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,788
Mother.

220
00:10:00,824 --> 00:10:01,756
Why?

221
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,992
I resented my father's strength.

222
00:10:04,027 --> 00:10:05,626
I see. Yes.

223
00:10:05,662 --> 00:10:06,627
And when he died...

224
00:10:06,663 --> 00:10:07,295
Yes.

225
00:10:07,331 --> 00:10:08,596
...how did you feel?

226
00:10:08,631 --> 00:10:09,364
Guilty.

227
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,365
For a car crash? Why?

228
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,133
It was not your fault.

229
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:14,602
I imagined he was gone. And then he was.

230
00:10:14,637 --> 00:10:16,604
You lost a child recently.

231
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,772
Yes.

232
00:10:17,807 --> 00:10:19,607
How does that make you feel?

233
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:22,563
Guilty.

234
00:10:22,564 --> 00:10:24,012
Guilt again.

235
00:10:24,047 --> 00:10:25,146
You blame yourself?

236
00:10:25,182 --> 00:10:26,447
It was my fault.

237
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:28,449
Oh. Oh, I see. I didn't know that.

238
00:10:28,485 --> 00:10:30,785
And what happened to the mother?

239
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,154
- Lee, was it?
- She's...

240
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,156
down south somewhere.

241
00:10:35,192 --> 00:10:36,758
You still love her?

242
00:10:36,793 --> 00:10:37,759
Yes.

243
00:10:37,794 --> 00:10:38,960
You want to be with her?

244
00:10:38,996 --> 00:10:39,961
Yes.

245
00:10:39,997 --> 00:10:42,163
Why aren't you with her?

246
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:44,799
I've put her through enough pain.

247
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:48,803
Jim, I need you to relax.

248
00:10:49,296 --> 00:10:51,839
Close your eyes.

249
00:10:52,842 --> 00:10:56,111
Imagine that I am God.

250
00:10:57,806 --> 00:10:59,981
All-powerful.

251
00:11:00,017 --> 00:11:01,783
I am God,

252
00:11:01,818 --> 00:11:03,952
and I absolve you

253
00:11:03,987 --> 00:11:06,421
of all of your guilt.

254
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:08,790
I put that guilt on you,

255
00:11:08,825 --> 00:11:11,326
and now...

256
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:14,129
I take it away.

257
00:11:14,164 --> 00:11:15,563
It's gone.

258
00:11:15,598 --> 00:11:17,999
Your burdens are gone.

259
00:11:22,906 --> 00:11:25,974
So how do you feel?

260
00:11:26,009 --> 00:11:27,108
Good.

261
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,109
Better.

262
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,245
Good.

263
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,280
Good, good.

264
00:11:34,384 --> 00:11:36,451
Jim...

265
00:11:36,486 --> 00:11:39,020
now that we're relaxed

266
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:41,423
and speaking honestly, tell me:

267
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:45,226
what do you know about our
work here at Indian Hill?

268
00:11:45,262 --> 00:11:48,096
You're building monsters
for military use.

269
00:11:48,131 --> 00:11:50,598
Oh, we're doing much more
than that, but for who?

270
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:53,734
Who owns Indian Hill?

271
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,736
Wayne Enterprises.

272
00:11:55,772 --> 00:11:57,738
And who controls Wayne Enterprises

273
00:11:57,774 --> 00:11:59,374
behind the scenes?

274
00:12:00,006 --> 00:12:00,875
Who controls

275
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,311
everything in Gotham...

276
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,880
behind the scenes?

277
00:12:05,915 --> 00:12:08,383
I don't know.

278
00:12:08,418 --> 00:12:10,118
The rich?

279
00:12:10,153 --> 00:12:12,220
Oh, they are rich, I'm sure.

280
00:12:12,255 --> 00:12:14,489
But can you be more specific?

281
00:12:16,593 --> 00:12:20,061
Who controls Gotham, Jim?

282
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:25,967
You've never heard of a...

283
00:12:28,305 --> 00:12:31,072
...secret council?

284
00:12:31,598 --> 00:12:33,308
Secret council?

285
00:12:34,677 --> 00:12:36,944
No.

286
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,980
Excellent.

287
00:12:39,016 --> 00:12:40,548
Excellent.

288
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,916
Thank you.

289
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:44,219
That's what I needed to know.

290
00:12:44,254 --> 00:12:46,154
Professor Strange?

291
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:47,455
Yes, Jim?

292
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:49,090
What you said about Lee.

293
00:12:50,038 --> 00:12:52,127
I should have gone after her.

294
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:54,129
Oh, no doubt.

295
00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:55,763
Guilt has compelled you

296
00:12:55,798 --> 00:12:57,565
to sacrifice your heart
to your conscience.

297
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,766
But guilt

298
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:00,635
is useless.

299
00:13:01,971 --> 00:13:03,838
Love, Jim.

300
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:07,642
Love is our guide.

301
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,580
Time's up, I'm afraid.

302
00:13:12,615 --> 00:13:14,615
In the spirit of intimacy and honesty,

303
00:13:14,651 --> 00:13:17,452
I have been speaking about your life

304
00:13:17,487 --> 00:13:19,521
as if it had a future.

305
00:13:19,556 --> 00:13:21,022
And...

306
00:13:21,058 --> 00:13:23,024
that is not so.

307
00:13:25,695 --> 00:13:28,363
You have a few hours.

308
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,200
You have

309
00:13:32,235 --> 00:13:33,701
30 seconds left.

310
00:13:33,736 --> 00:13:35,770
Who runs Wayne Enterprises?

311
00:13:35,805 --> 00:13:37,305
Oh, the devil, maybe.

312
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,174
Is that the deal? Communists? Witches?

313
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:40,808
No. There's some truth
behind this question.

314
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:42,110
Some big secret.

315
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:43,945
I've worked for Wayne
Enterprises for ten years...

316
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,046
there is no big secret.

317
00:13:45,082 --> 00:13:47,348
The board of directors
runs Wayne Enterprises.

318
00:13:47,384 --> 00:13:48,316
15 seconds.

319
00:13:48,351 --> 00:13:49,884
That can't be the answer, Lucius.

320
00:13:50,987 --> 00:13:52,387
Ten seconds.

321
00:13:52,422 --> 00:13:53,754
Give us more time!

322
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,190
Five seconds!

323
00:13:55,225 --> 00:13:56,224
The board of directors.

324
00:14:01,331 --> 00:14:03,131
Incorrect.

325
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,900
Oh, what a shame.

326
00:14:05,935 --> 00:14:08,069
The correct answer is...

327
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:14,909
Sorry, fellas. You lose.

328
00:14:14,944 --> 00:14:17,979
And what happens to losers?

329
00:14:18,014 --> 00:14:19,080
Yowzah!

330
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,218
Death by poison gas!

331
00:15:38,802 --> 00:15:40,334
Jim.

332
00:15:40,394 --> 00:15:41,860
Jim.

333
00:15:41,896 --> 00:15:43,295
Hi.

334
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,363
Hi.

335
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:47,499
Are we alive?

336
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:49,101
So far, so good.

337
00:15:49,136 --> 00:15:51,670
Had to be sure... I
thought we were dead.

338
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,875
That was unpleasant.

339
00:15:56,911 --> 00:15:58,978
How are things going for you?

340
00:15:59,013 --> 00:16:00,846
We've had a hell of a time.

341
00:16:00,881 --> 00:16:02,280
The same.

342
00:16:02,316 --> 00:16:03,882
You okay?

343
00:16:03,918 --> 00:16:05,250
I'm a little groggy.

344
00:16:05,285 --> 00:16:06,685
He drugged me.

345
00:16:06,721 --> 00:16:08,220
Made me talk.

346
00:16:08,255 --> 00:16:10,055
About Wayne Enterprises, right?

347
00:16:10,091 --> 00:16:11,223
About everything.

348
00:16:12,093 --> 00:16:12,758
Bruce...

349
00:16:13,728 --> 00:16:16,495
I never should have
made that oath to you.

350
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,032
- That's not really...
- I was arrogant and naive...

351
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:20,432
and I'm sorry.

352
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:23,268
I've tried to do the right thing, but...

353
00:16:23,303 --> 00:16:26,639
what a fool I've been.

354
00:16:29,747 --> 00:16:32,711
What kind of drugs did they give you?

355
00:16:32,747 --> 00:16:35,147
Well done, Ed. I'm impressed.

356
00:16:35,182 --> 00:16:37,549
You are a shaman of sorts.

357
00:16:37,584 --> 00:16:39,952
- A witch doctor.
- So, just between us,

358
00:16:39,987 --> 00:16:41,854
who does run Wayne Enterprises?

359
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:43,889
I could tell you, but then...

360
00:16:43,924 --> 00:16:45,691
I would have to lobotomize you.

361
00:16:47,161 --> 00:16:48,493
Gotcha.

362
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:50,129
So, moving forward, sir, I
would be more than happy

363
00:16:50,164 --> 00:16:51,630
to help you with any
of your other cases.

364
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:54,432
You would be a wonderful
addition to my staff, Ed,

365
00:16:54,468 --> 00:16:57,202
a wonderful addition,
if you were only sane.

366
00:16:57,992 --> 00:17:00,405
- No, seriously...
- Yes, seriously.

367
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,275
You have been very useful,
and we arrogant physicians

368
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,878
have much to learn from a madman

369
00:17:05,913 --> 00:17:06,979
like you.

370
00:17:07,014 --> 00:17:08,947
But not that much.

371
00:17:08,983 --> 00:17:10,315
No! No, no, no, no!

372
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,350
You will not treat me
like a crazy person!

373
00:17:12,386 --> 00:17:13,552
No!

374
00:17:13,587 --> 00:17:16,488
Madam, I bring good news.

375
00:17:16,523 --> 00:17:20,225
Gordon and Wayne and Fox know
nothing but mundanities.

376
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,061
They have told no one the truth,

377
00:17:22,096 --> 00:17:24,129
because they have none of the truth.

378
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:32,037
Our secret is safe.

379
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:35,674
Kill them all, then continue

380
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,643
with the evacuation of
your test subjects.

381
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:40,245
Yes, madam.

382
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,148
The destruction of Indian Hill
may proceed as scheduled.

383
00:17:43,184 --> 00:17:46,418
Releasing Galavan was a
grave error on your part.

384
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:49,287
No more of your patients
will see the light of day

385
00:17:49,323 --> 00:17:51,590
under any circumstances,

386
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,658
at any cost.

387
00:17:55,062 --> 00:17:57,495
I understand, madam.

388
00:17:57,496 --> 00:18:04,894
T*U*S*U*B*T*I*T*U*L*O*.*C*O*M*

389
00:18:04,895 --> 00:18:07,128
These people to whom
Strange is connected,

390
00:18:07,164 --> 00:18:09,898
they must be pretty heavy...
to make you back off.

391
00:18:09,933 --> 00:18:12,267
Oh, they're heavy.

392
00:18:12,303 --> 00:18:14,202
I don't want anything dangerous..

393
00:18:14,237 --> 00:18:16,505
I just like being titillated.

394
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,873
Seriously, you don't wanna know.

395
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:20,442
Remember the time you called
me from the hospital

396
00:18:20,477 --> 00:18:22,444
when you had Falcone on the gurney,

397
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:24,646
and the whole town and their uncle

398
00:18:24,682 --> 00:18:26,748
were looking to kill you both?

399
00:18:28,385 --> 00:18:31,052
- How could I forget?
- Remember what I said

400
00:18:31,087 --> 00:18:32,454
to you on the phone?

401
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:34,088
Remember what I said?

402
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:36,891
I forget.

403
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,193
That's funny.

404
00:18:38,228 --> 00:18:41,296
Gordon, you're back. What happened?

405
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:43,231
Where's Master Bruce? Where's Lucius?

406
00:18:43,266 --> 00:18:44,700
Where are they?!

407
00:18:44,735 --> 00:18:45,767
Have you seen them?

408
00:18:45,803 --> 00:18:46,901
Hey, Alfred, take it easy.

409
00:18:46,937 --> 00:18:48,470
- Where are they?
- Alfred...

410
00:18:48,505 --> 00:18:49,304
Alfred...

411
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,206
relax.

412
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:53,208
Master Bruce and Lucius are...

413
00:18:53,243 --> 00:18:54,743
headed back to Wayne Manor.

414
00:18:54,778 --> 00:18:56,845
Yeah, well, that's a load of hot
tosh for starters, isn't it?

415
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,246
- I've just come back from there.
- What can I tell ya?

416
00:18:58,281 --> 00:19:00,549
Maybe they... stopped to get a snack.

417
00:19:00,584 --> 00:19:02,451
So, what about Strange?

418
00:19:02,486 --> 00:19:03,819
It's complicated.

419
00:19:03,854 --> 00:19:05,821
Well, go on, then! What?!

420
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,758
Complicated police business!

421
00:19:12,363 --> 00:19:14,162
He's got a touch of the flu.

422
00:19:24,323 --> 00:19:25,150
You.

423
00:19:33,348 --> 00:19:34,595
How you doing?

424
00:19:34,596 --> 00:19:36,895
Middling. What's your deal?

425
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:38,596
Chillin'.

426
00:19:38,632 --> 00:19:40,899
They're gonna blow this dump sky-high

427
00:19:40,935 --> 00:19:43,368
and the whole circus is moving upstate.

428
00:19:43,403 --> 00:19:44,436
When?

429
00:19:44,471 --> 00:19:46,438
Soon. Like, an hour.

430
00:19:46,473 --> 00:19:48,340
- Can you escape?
- 'Course.

431
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:52,110
Firefly thinks I'm her sidekick,
so I got trusty status.

432
00:19:52,146 --> 00:19:53,979
Then please do so. Get out
of here and call the police.

433
00:19:54,014 --> 00:19:55,314
- I'll do what I like.
- I led you

434
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:57,082
into this mess... I was self-righteous

435
00:19:57,117 --> 00:19:58,951
and arrogant and manipulative.

436
00:19:58,986 --> 00:20:01,653
- I used you, and I'm sorry.
- Like you can use me.

437
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:03,856
I got you wrapped around my pinky.

438
00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:06,791
Always have.

439
00:20:06,827 --> 00:20:09,394
Be that as it may...

440
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:11,796
if you can escape, do it.

441
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,000
Manipulative.

442
00:20:15,035 --> 00:20:16,835
As if.

443
00:20:19,506 --> 00:20:20,772
What'd she say?

444
00:20:20,807 --> 00:20:22,774
She'll do what she likes.

445
00:20:26,112 --> 00:20:26,979
And there's a bomb.

446
00:21:04,885 --> 00:21:07,485
Hello, number 13.

447
00:21:07,521 --> 00:21:09,121
Stay calm.

448
00:21:11,058 --> 00:21:13,525
No one's going to hurt you.

449
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,961
It's time to go on a trip.

450
00:21:15,996 --> 00:21:17,862
Give me your right arm.

451
00:21:28,242 --> 00:21:30,742
Say my name.

452
00:21:30,777 --> 00:21:32,510
Fish Mooney.

453
00:21:32,546 --> 00:21:34,279
That's right.

454
00:21:37,084 --> 00:21:39,384
What's your name?

455
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,053
Ethel Peabody.

456
00:21:42,077 --> 00:21:43,765
Ethel...

457
00:21:43,766 --> 00:21:46,050
you seem sad

458
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:47,225
and anxious.

459
00:21:47,261 --> 00:21:51,469
- You got that right.
- You let me out of here...

460
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,565
and I'll be your friend.

461
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:18,551
Oh, no, no,

462
00:22:18,586 --> 00:22:19,652
no, no, no,

463
00:22:19,687 --> 00:22:22,455
no, no, no.

464
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,861
Interesting. Ms. Peabody,

465
00:22:28,897 --> 00:22:31,197
what are you doing?

466
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:32,632
What she says.

467
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,367
Why?

468
00:22:34,403 --> 00:22:36,336
I don't know.

469
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:38,038
Miss Mooney,

470
00:22:38,073 --> 00:22:40,706
you have special talents.

471
00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:41,942
Some form of psychotropic

472
00:22:41,977 --> 00:22:44,077
chemical agent on your skin, I imagine.

473
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,545
You're marvelous.

474
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,814
Yes, truly marvelous.

475
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:49,149
Always was.

476
00:22:49,184 --> 00:22:50,550
Indeed.

477
00:22:50,585 --> 00:22:53,320
Would love to chat about me,
but we have a bus to catch.

478
00:22:53,355 --> 00:22:54,921
Ah, no, Miss Mooney,

479
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,223
if you and the others on that bus

480
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:58,758
were to appear in public,

481
00:22:58,793 --> 00:23:01,761
it would cause a
revolution, an apocalypse.

482
00:23:01,796 --> 00:23:04,397
I simply can't allow you
to just walk out of here.

483
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:06,166
Watch me.

484
00:23:06,201 --> 00:23:07,367
Oh, please, don't go.

485
00:23:07,402 --> 00:23:09,102
Please, you're breaking my heart.

486
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,337
I love you like my own daughter.

487
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:12,639
No one could love you more,

488
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,740
but I will have to kill
you before I let you go.

489
00:23:14,776 --> 00:23:16,542
Please, choose

490
00:23:16,578 --> 00:23:17,910
life.

491
00:23:17,946 --> 00:23:20,947
You would have made a great pimp.

492
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:22,915
No, no, no, no.

493
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:24,417
No, no, no!

494
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:26,719
Bring him back.

495
00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:35,595
Hugo...

496
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,230
I order you

497
00:23:37,265 --> 00:23:38,298
to stop...

498
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,199
now.

499
00:23:41,136 --> 00:23:42,202
Stop...

500
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:43,036
now!

501
00:23:43,071 --> 00:23:44,570
You hear me?

502
00:23:50,155 --> 00:23:51,227
DESTRUCTION PROTOCOL READY

503
00:23:51,228 --> 00:23:52,650
ARMED

504
00:24:13,801 --> 00:24:16,269
Security systems activated.

505
00:24:16,304 --> 00:24:18,838
Security systems activated.

506
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:23,343
No!

507
00:24:30,485 --> 00:24:33,586
Tried calling about a thousand times.

508
00:24:33,621 --> 00:24:35,321
Still no answer.

509
00:24:35,357 --> 00:24:36,989
Strange has him, I'm positive.

510
00:24:37,025 --> 00:24:38,158
Holy crap,

511
00:24:38,193 --> 00:24:39,992
are you still here? I told you

512
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:40,993
a thousand times

513
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:43,396
Strange is clean.

514
00:24:43,432 --> 00:24:44,764
You in charge of that, are you?

515
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,332
It's strange, though, isn't it?

516
00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:47,200
I mean,

517
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,668
strange they're MIA.

518
00:24:48,703 --> 00:24:49,936
That's funny.

519
00:24:50,905 --> 00:24:52,338
- Strange.
- Funny?

520
00:24:52,374 --> 00:24:53,339
You know, maybe I should send

521
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:54,774
the strike force back into Arkham,

522
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:56,042
- have a little look see.
- No, no, no.

523
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,110
You don't want to do that.

524
00:24:57,145 --> 00:24:58,111
Bad idea. Trust me.

525
00:24:58,146 --> 00:25:00,046
That's a terrible idea.

526
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,315
How long you known me?

527
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,783
All right,

528
00:25:03,818 --> 00:25:05,985
if you're good, I guess I'm good.

529
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,787
I don't know who's
got to you, Gordon,

530
00:25:07,822 --> 00:25:08,888
but you're just, just...

531
00:25:10,492 --> 00:25:12,125
...weird.

532
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,393
Hey, Alfred.

533
00:25:14,258 --> 00:25:15,495
Miss Kean.

534
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,896
How's the butling business?

535
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,499
To what do we owe the...

536
00:25:19,534 --> 00:25:20,866
Jimmy, my love,

537
00:25:20,902 --> 00:25:22,535
I'm sure you're ever so busy,

538
00:25:22,571 --> 00:25:24,003
but could we have a word in private?

539
00:25:26,674 --> 00:25:29,041
You bet.

540
00:25:32,547 --> 00:25:34,046
Well, you look terrible.

541
00:25:34,082 --> 00:25:35,448
Gee, thanks, Barbara.

542
00:25:35,484 --> 00:25:36,483
You look pretty good.

543
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:37,850
Shucks.

544
00:25:37,885 --> 00:25:40,420
Question: what the hell is
going on down at Arkham?

545
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,222
Two questions back at you, gorgeous.

546
00:25:42,257 --> 00:25:45,125
Why you asking, and...
what's in it for me?

547
00:25:45,473 --> 00:25:47,794
I'm asking because a dear friend of mine

548
00:25:47,795 --> 00:25:50,062
wants to know the answer,

549
00:25:50,098 --> 00:25:52,398
and what would you like
to be in it for you?

550
00:25:52,434 --> 00:25:54,734
Hey, spring is here, baby.

551
00:25:54,769 --> 00:25:56,836
So, now you like me again?

552
00:25:56,871 --> 00:25:58,771
What's not to like?

553
00:25:58,806 --> 00:26:01,107
So, you've forgotten about Lee.

554
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,008
Lee?

555
00:26:03,445 --> 00:26:05,778
Lee Thompkins.

556
00:26:05,813 --> 00:26:07,046
Nah, screw that ho.

557
00:26:07,081 --> 00:26:08,781
Water under the bridge.

558
00:26:08,816 --> 00:26:10,416
You're not Jim.

559
00:26:10,452 --> 00:26:12,352
Say what now?

560
00:26:12,387 --> 00:26:13,786
You're not Jim!

561
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:16,389
Hold on there, woman.

562
00:26:18,926 --> 00:26:21,093
Holy mother of saints.

563
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:33,706
Kill the captives. We have to go.

564
00:26:34,388 --> 00:26:35,775
Where are we going?
What's the hurry?

565
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,809
Silence.

566
00:26:36,844 --> 00:26:38,344
Freeze, get it done.

567
00:26:39,314 --> 00:26:40,647
Jeez, relax.

568
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,648
What's with him?

569
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:42,448
Quiet!

570
00:26:42,484 --> 00:26:43,783
Quiet yourself.

571
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,952
Why do you have to kill them?

572
00:26:45,953 --> 00:26:47,220
Why are you so mean?

573
00:26:47,255 --> 00:26:48,888
I knew I shouldn't have spared you.

574
00:26:48,923 --> 00:26:51,157
Freeze, kill her.

575
00:26:52,627 --> 00:26:53,993
Wait a minute!

576
00:26:54,028 --> 00:26:55,261
I'm sorry, Firefly.

577
00:26:55,297 --> 00:26:57,463
I told you she was an experiment.

578
00:26:57,499 --> 00:26:59,399
But she's my friend. I need her.

579
00:27:02,437 --> 00:27:04,103
We don't have time for this.

580
00:27:04,138 --> 00:27:05,805
Please, don't let him hurt me.

581
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,972
Firefly...

582
00:27:07,942 --> 00:27:09,742
...please, help me.

583
00:27:09,777 --> 00:27:10,810
Don't you dare.

584
00:27:14,449 --> 00:27:16,249
Out of the way, sparky.

585
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,752
Make me.

586
00:27:19,787 --> 00:27:21,688
Firefly, no.

587
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,089
No!

588
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,473
What now?

589
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,310
Sounds like warfare.

590
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:48,615
What's going on?

591
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,516
Simple psychology.

592
00:27:50,552 --> 00:27:53,052
Been waiting for the right moment.

593
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:56,856
You coming or what?

594
00:28:16,033 --> 00:28:18,844
15 minutes to detonation.

595
00:28:19,379 --> 00:28:22,649
15 minutes to detonation.

596
00:28:33,653 --> 00:28:34,560
Strange.

597
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:37,163
Strange!

598
00:28:43,131 --> 00:28:43,836
Wake up.

599
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,971
Strange.

600
00:28:46,007 --> 00:28:47,206
Strange!

601
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,790
Alpha and Charlie squads to Arkham.

602
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:00,591
Bravo and Delta to Indian Hill.

603
00:29:00,627 --> 00:29:01,925
Move!

604
00:29:01,961 --> 00:29:08,185
Hey, Penguin, so it turns out our Mr.
Strange is a very bad man.

605
00:29:08,385 --> 00:29:09,600
The police are on to him now.

606
00:29:09,636 --> 00:29:12,370
They figure he's planning
to run, but he won't.

607
00:29:12,405 --> 00:29:13,638
Thanks to me.

608
00:29:13,673 --> 00:29:14,639
Thank you, Barbara.

609
00:29:14,674 --> 00:29:17,040
You have pleased me.

610
00:29:19,345 --> 00:29:21,312
Saddle up, Butch,

611
00:29:21,347 --> 00:29:23,414
we've got an old friend to catch.

612
00:29:28,087 --> 00:29:29,052
Wake up, Strange.

613
00:29:29,088 --> 00:29:30,954
I know you're in there.

614
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:31,689
Wake up!

615
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,893
Oh, Gordon.

616
00:29:35,928 --> 00:29:38,896
I surmise my plan must have gone awry.

617
00:29:38,931 --> 00:29:41,131
You could say. I'm gonna
stand you up now,

618
00:29:41,167 --> 00:29:43,000
and you're gonna give us a
tour of your secret lab.

619
00:29:43,035 --> 00:29:44,168
No.

620
00:29:44,203 --> 00:29:45,403
You don't have a choice.

621
00:29:47,507 --> 00:29:48,506
It's this way, right?

622
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:50,240
No, we can't go down there.
I set a bomb.

623
00:29:50,276 --> 00:29:51,542
The lab is going to blow up.

624
00:29:51,577 --> 00:29:52,643
We have to get out of here!

625
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:54,144
In ten minutes,

626
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,580
everything within a quarter
mile radius will be dust.

627
00:29:56,616 --> 00:29:57,981
That's madness.

628
00:29:58,017 --> 00:29:59,383
If you want to live...

629
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:01,519
which I do, frankly...
we had better leave.

630
00:30:01,554 --> 00:30:03,689
We detected a radioactive
material down there.

631
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,222
You got it out first, right?

632
00:30:05,257 --> 00:30:06,390
There wasn't enough time.

633
00:30:06,735 --> 00:30:08,307
They forced my hand,

634
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:12,330
but I calculated the chances of
a radioactive cloud is fairly low.

635
00:30:12,365 --> 00:30:14,097
If you're wrong, thousands
of people could die.

636
00:30:14,133 --> 00:30:15,399
Yes, yes, yes,

637
00:30:15,435 --> 00:30:18,268
but paying that price will be better

638
00:30:18,304 --> 00:30:20,838
than releasing what's down there.

639
00:30:20,873 --> 00:30:22,784
How do we shut it down?

640
00:30:22,785 --> 00:30:24,342
The security walls
are up. The lab is sealed.

641
00:30:24,377 --> 00:30:25,343
There must be some way in.

642
00:30:25,378 --> 00:30:26,944
We have to go!

643
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:28,379
We have to leave now!

644
00:30:28,414 --> 00:30:30,548
Tell me how to get that
bomb and shut it off

645
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:32,450
or I'll batter you to death right here!

646
00:30:32,485 --> 00:30:33,851
In which case,

647
00:30:33,886 --> 00:30:35,052
young man,

648
00:30:35,087 --> 00:30:39,690
I suppose I will just have to die.

649
00:30:40,993 --> 00:30:43,594
Wait, Nygma knows a way down there.

650
00:30:47,734 --> 00:30:49,099
Could use some help.

651
00:30:49,134 --> 00:30:50,300
Yeah.

652
00:30:50,336 --> 00:30:51,535
You two,

653
00:30:51,571 --> 00:30:52,936
you've got nine minutes.

654
00:30:52,972 --> 00:30:54,126
Get as far away from here as you can.

655
00:30:54,127 --> 00:30:54,473
No.

656
00:30:54,474 --> 00:30:55,809
Go, go!

657
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,608
Lucius, this way.

658
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,647
Yes, of course, I know how,

659
00:31:03,683 --> 00:31:04,815
but what is with all the hoo-ha?

660
00:31:04,851 --> 00:31:05,816
What is the rush here?

661
00:31:05,852 --> 00:31:07,050
Just do it.

662
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:15,158
What do I get if I do it?

663
00:31:15,194 --> 00:31:16,894
You get to live.

664
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:20,130
Fair enough.

665
00:31:23,477 --> 00:31:25,335
Security system is deactivated.

666
00:31:28,374 --> 00:31:30,040
Security system is deactivated.

667
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,553
You any good at defusing bombs?

668
00:31:42,588 --> 00:31:44,522
I don't know yet.

669
00:31:44,557 --> 00:31:46,023
You?

670
00:31:49,695 --> 00:31:53,964
Two minutes to detonation.

671
00:31:54,645 --> 00:31:57,064
Two minutes to detonation.

672
00:32:19,058 --> 00:32:21,325
Oh, my.

673
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:23,193
Got any ideas?

674
00:32:24,355 --> 00:32:26,972
You got a knife?

675
00:32:26,973 --> 00:32:27,965
No.

676
00:32:30,485 --> 00:32:32,039
ARMED

677
00:32:32,338 --> 00:32:34,738
We're on a rush to Arkham
for patient evacuation.

678
00:32:34,774 --> 00:32:36,874
We got bomb squad in set.

679
00:32:51,457 --> 00:32:53,491
What now?

680
00:32:53,526 --> 00:32:55,258
You're asking me?

681
00:32:56,696 --> 00:32:58,328
How about if we just...

682
00:32:58,364 --> 00:32:59,563
pull all this stuff off.

683
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:00,931
See what happens.

684
00:33:00,967 --> 00:33:02,900
There's no cutoff program, maybe,

685
00:33:02,935 --> 00:33:05,335
maybe there's no
tamper-proofing program.

686
00:33:05,371 --> 00:33:06,871
Yeah.

687
00:33:06,906 --> 00:33:08,806
Yeah.

688
00:33:13,012 --> 00:33:14,177
No.

689
00:33:15,715 --> 00:33:17,114
Water.

690
00:33:18,818 --> 00:33:19,917
Need water.

691
00:33:19,952 --> 00:33:20,784
Water.

692
00:33:24,056 --> 00:33:27,925
What's going on? Hello?

693
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,959
45 seconds.

694
00:33:40,873 --> 00:33:42,606
15 seconds.

695
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:11,035
Please.

696
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,704
I need water.

697
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:16,787
Water.

698
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,976
I need water.

699
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,799
Hello!

700
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:52,401
Hello!

701
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:58,240
Hello! Guys!

702
00:34:58,275 --> 00:35:00,708
What's going on?

703
00:35:01,845 --> 00:35:04,379
Hello!

704
00:35:05,258 --> 00:35:06,848
Where are my people?

705
00:35:06,883 --> 00:35:08,483
Where are my people?

706
00:35:08,518 --> 00:35:09,784
Y-you don't understand.

707
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,120
We have to find my people.

708
00:35:12,156 --> 00:35:13,322
There will be...

709
00:35:13,357 --> 00:35:14,990
There will be consequences.

710
00:35:18,095 --> 00:35:19,894
You heroic son of a bitch.

711
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:22,264
A nuclear bomb?

712
00:35:22,299 --> 00:35:23,865
You'll never guess what took us so long.

713
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,566
Problem.

714
00:35:24,601 --> 00:35:26,401
Whatever was down there,

715
00:35:26,437 --> 00:35:29,004
Whoever was down there at Indian Hill,

716
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:30,339
they're not there anymore.

717
00:35:30,374 --> 00:35:32,607
Couple of squad cars are
in pursuit of a bus

718
00:35:32,642 --> 00:35:34,276
that left the Indian Hills compound.

719
00:35:34,311 --> 00:35:35,844
That's got to be them.

720
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:38,313
That bus cannot get away.

721
00:35:45,155 --> 00:35:46,254
This is Unit 12.

722
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,289
In pursuit of Arkham bus

723
00:35:47,324 --> 00:35:49,224
heading south along the D Line.

724
00:35:50,827 --> 00:35:52,861
...Unit 12.

725
00:35:54,231 --> 00:35:56,564
We'll pick 'em up at the next block.

726
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,233
Get ready.

727
00:35:58,268 --> 00:35:59,734
Don't have much space here.

728
00:36:06,076 --> 00:36:07,642
It's in civilian traffic ahead.
He's blocked in.

729
00:36:23,864 --> 00:36:25,627
We'll do at the cross street.

730
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:30,832
Nothing. I'll check up ahead.

731
00:36:30,867 --> 00:36:33,101
Car 32 to Captain Bullock.
Heading east toward Pettsburg.

732
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:34,536
Damn, damn, damn.

733
00:36:34,571 --> 00:36:35,570
What's on that bus, Jim?

734
00:36:35,605 --> 00:36:36,804
Tell me what's on the bus?

735
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,006
Monsters.

736
00:36:38,042 --> 00:36:39,908
Come on. Monsters?

737
00:36:39,943 --> 00:36:41,109
Hugo Strange would rather destroy

738
00:36:41,145 --> 00:36:42,977
half the city than let them out.

739
00:36:43,013 --> 00:36:44,346
And now they're out.

740
00:36:45,144 --> 00:36:46,281
Code Red.

741
00:36:46,316 --> 00:36:49,117
Code Red. All units Pettsburg Highway.

742
00:36:49,153 --> 00:36:50,485
All units be on the lookout

743
00:36:50,521 --> 00:36:52,820
for the Indian Hill bus
on Pettsburg Highway.

744
00:36:52,856 --> 00:36:54,622
Captain Bullock, I've
got eyes on the bus.

745
00:36:54,658 --> 00:36:56,458
Under the South Burnside Expressway.

746
00:36:56,493 --> 00:36:57,792
Well, then stop the damn thing.

747
00:36:57,827 --> 00:36:59,361
Don't let it get away.

748
00:37:11,275 --> 00:37:14,109
Come to mama.

749
00:38:04,294 --> 00:38:06,728
Professor Strange!

750
00:38:06,763 --> 00:38:08,597
Professor Strange.

751
00:38:09,535 --> 00:38:10,832
Come out.

752
00:38:12,536 --> 00:38:14,302
Strange. We need to talk.

753
00:38:14,338 --> 00:38:18,573
You did a very bad thing to me.

754
00:38:18,609 --> 00:38:22,511
And now you're going to pay.

755
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,586
Impossible.

756
00:38:34,758 --> 00:38:36,291
Nothing...

757
00:38:36,326 --> 00:38:38,627
is impossible.

758
00:38:46,069 --> 00:38:48,903
Holy...

759
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,874
No.

760
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:02,317
This city's in deep trouble
if we don't find that bus.

761
00:39:02,352 --> 00:39:03,518
So let's find it.

762
00:39:03,554 --> 00:39:04,686
Yes, sir.

763
00:39:04,721 --> 00:39:07,822
I want squadrons of 20
in these quadrants here.

764
00:39:07,857 --> 00:39:10,024
I want choppers in the air,

765
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,460
and I want tac units on all
the East Side bridges.

766
00:39:12,496 --> 00:39:14,262
Bruce.

767
00:39:19,769 --> 00:39:21,936
I have to go.

768
00:39:21,971 --> 00:39:23,405
I might not see you for a while,

769
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,240
but I'll try to stay in touch.

770
00:39:25,275 --> 00:39:27,309
Where are you going?

771
00:39:27,344 --> 00:39:29,344
I have to find Lee.

772
00:39:29,379 --> 00:39:31,313
Right move, mate.

773
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:34,249
Do me a favor.

774
00:39:34,284 --> 00:39:36,251
Say good-bye to Bullock for me.

775
00:39:36,286 --> 00:39:38,520
I don't really want the
whole Celtic farewell.

776
00:39:38,555 --> 00:39:40,855
He's gonna have his hands full,

777
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:43,124
but I think he can handle it.

778
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,660
Will do.

779
00:39:57,274 --> 00:39:59,374
Chocolates.

780
00:39:59,409 --> 00:40:02,009
Girls like chocolates.

781
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:05,247
I'll keep that in mind.

782
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,750
Well, there's a man who's got
his priorities straight.

783
00:40:11,121 --> 00:40:12,820
The love of a good woman and all that.

784
00:40:14,258 --> 00:40:15,490
Well,

785
00:40:15,525 --> 00:40:18,226
I hope you learned your
lesson, Master Bruce.

786
00:40:18,262 --> 00:40:21,496
And that's the end of your
adventures with the police?

787
00:40:24,033 --> 00:40:26,067
There's a secret council, Alfred.

788
00:40:26,102 --> 00:40:28,303
A secret council that runs
everything in Gotham.

789
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:30,071
Oh, bloody hell.

790
00:40:30,106 --> 00:40:32,340
It's them that wanted me dead.

791
00:40:32,376 --> 00:40:35,010
We're so close, Alfred, we're so
close to the ultimate truth.

792
00:40:35,011 --> 00:40:37,011
Oh, bloody hell.

793
00:40:37,046 --> 00:40:38,580
Hey, don't look at me.

794
00:40:43,553 --> 00:40:45,520
Right.

795
00:40:45,555 --> 00:40:46,888
Right.

796
00:40:48,057 --> 00:40:49,924
Jim! Hey.

797
00:40:49,959 --> 00:40:51,926
Hey. Where you going?

798
00:40:51,961 --> 00:40:53,161
Hey.

799
00:40:53,196 --> 00:40:54,962
We got monsters to find.

800
00:40:54,998 --> 00:40:56,998
And you'll find them. I have to go.

801
00:40:57,033 --> 00:40:58,833
But this city's in danger.

802
00:40:58,868 --> 00:41:00,935
You got this. I know you do.

803
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,804
And I have more important things to do.

804
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:03,738
- But...
- And Harvey,

805
00:41:03,774 --> 00:41:04,939
Yeah?

806
00:41:04,974 --> 00:41:06,908
You're the boss now.

807
00:41:06,943 --> 00:41:09,411
Maybe get a haircut?

808
00:41:16,886 --> 00:41:19,354
That's my car.

809
00:41:19,389 --> 00:41:21,255
That's-that's my car!

810
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:22,957
Hey! Jim!

811
00:41:36,005 --> 00:41:39,407
Help. Help.

812
00:41:41,545 --> 00:41:44,946
Oh, those poor souls.

813
00:41:46,983 --> 00:41:48,650
H-hello?

814
00:41:48,685 --> 00:41:50,084
Hello?

815
00:42:48,678 --> 00:42:50,678
Thank you.

816
