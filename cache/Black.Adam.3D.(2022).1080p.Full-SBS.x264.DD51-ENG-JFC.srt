1
00:00:36,545 --> 00:00:40,250
<i>Before Rome, before Babylon,</i>

2
00:00:40,317 --> 00:00:43,419
<i>before the pyramids,
there was Kahndaq.</i>

3
00:00:50,726 --> 00:00:52,795
<i>The first self-governing people
on Earth,</i>

4
00:00:52,862 --> 00:00:55,798
<i>Kahndaq was a center of power
and enlightenment.</i>

5
00:00:55,865 --> 00:00:57,800
<i>For centuries, they thrived.</i>

6
00:01:03,506 --> 00:01:06,109
<i>But then...</i>

7
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:12,015
<i>...came King Ahk-Ton.</i>

8
00:01:12,082 --> 00:01:15,919
<i>Using the army to seize power,
Ahk-Ton became a tyrant.</i>

9
00:01:15,986 --> 00:01:17,888
<i>But he had
even darker ambitions.</i>

10
00:01:26,263 --> 00:01:27,863
<i>Obsessed with dark magic,</i>

11
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:31,567
<i>Ahk-Ton's real goal was
to forge the Crown of Sabbac.</i>

12
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:37,941
<i>If infused with the powers
of the six demons</i>

13
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:40,177
<i>of the ancient world...</i>

14
00:01:40,243 --> 00:01:43,113
<i>...it would make
Ahk-Ton invincible.</i>

15
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,148
<i>To make the crown,
he needed Eternium.</i>

16
00:01:45,215 --> 00:01:46,849
<i>A rare mineral
of magic properties,</i>

17
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:49,552
<i>found only in Kahndaq.</i>

18
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:51,554
<i>So he enslaved his own people...</i>

19
00:01:52,788 --> 00:01:54,191
<i>and forced them to dig.</i>

20
00:02:25,554 --> 00:02:27,623
<i>Kahndaq
was teetering on the brink.</i>

21
00:02:29,592 --> 00:02:31,128
<i>What they needed...</i>

22
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:37,767
<i>...was a hero.</i>

23
00:03:04,327 --> 00:03:05,295
Hmm.

24
00:03:57,481 --> 00:03:59,849
<i>Someone to hold
the hopes of the people,</i>

25
00:04:02,685 --> 00:04:04,955
<i>even when all hope seems lost.</i>

26
00:04:39,755 --> 00:04:41,591
<i>King Ahk-Ton
knew that this spark</i>

27
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:43,260
<i>could quickly ignite a fire.</i>

28
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:46,229
<i>And so, he ordered
that it be snuffed out.</i>

29
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,834
<i>They thought they were
getting a martyr.</i>

30
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:55,238
<i>Instead...</i>

31
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:57,274
<i>...they got a miracle.</i>

32
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,851
<i>The Council of Wizards,</i>

33
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:11,254
<i>the magical guardians
of the earth...</i>

34
00:05:12,923 --> 00:05:14,958
<i>...sought to
restore the balance.</i>

35
00:05:15,025 --> 00:05:17,760
<i>They empowered him with
the gifts of the ancient gods.</i>

36
00:05:17,826 --> 00:05:19,062
<i>And turned a boy...</i>

37
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:22,765
<i>...into a champion.</i>

38
00:05:22,831 --> 00:05:23,866
Shazam!

39
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:30,273
<i>But the crown
had already been completed.</i>

40
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,011
<i>And when the Champion
arrived at the palace</i>

41
00:05:35,078 --> 00:05:37,113
<i>to challenge him...</i>

42
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,316
<i>King Ahk-Ton summoned
its demonic power.</i>

43
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,790
<i>In the ensuing battle,
the palace was destroyed,</i>

44
00:05:47,856 --> 00:05:50,493
<i>but the Champion was victorious.</i>

45
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,462
<i>The wizards hid
the Crown of Sabbac</i>

46
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:55,465
<i>so that it would never again
fall into the hands of man.</i>

47
00:05:55,532 --> 00:05:58,668
<i>And the Champion
was never heard from again.</i>

48
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:06,643
<i>Today, Kahndaq is occupied
by international mercenaries,</i>

49
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,180
<i>the Intergang, the latest in
a series of foreign invaders.</i>

50
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:15,385
<i>But legend says, whenever
Kahndaq needs him most,</i>

51
00:06:15,452 --> 00:06:19,422
<i>the Champion will return to
restore freedom to the people.</i>

52
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:21,891
<i>It has been a long, long wait.</i>

53
00:06:28,365 --> 00:06:29,466
Hey!

54
00:06:35,804 --> 00:06:37,073
Show me your papers.

55
00:06:41,177 --> 00:06:42,646
Move it along!

56
00:06:42,712 --> 00:06:44,447
Have your documentation ready.

57
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:48,817
It's all our
three documents, yeah?

58
00:06:48,885 --> 00:06:50,086
Don't judge the picture,

59
00:06:50,153 --> 00:06:51,454
it's after my girlfriend
broke up with me.

60
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,063
Open the back.
Need a look inside.

61
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,901
Yeah, it's unlocked, man.

62
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:09,139
It's just a bunch of old TVs.
I'm an electrician.

63
00:07:16,112 --> 00:07:17,914
Hey!

64
00:07:18,615 --> 00:07:19,815
Watch where you're going.

65
00:07:19,883 --> 00:07:21,484
You know the drill,
back of the line.

66
00:07:21,551 --> 00:07:23,819
Come on, man,
you see me every day.

67
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:25,121
And every day I tell ya,

68
00:07:25,188 --> 00:07:27,090
if it's got wheels,
it's a vehicle.

69
00:07:27,157 --> 00:07:28,758
Back of the line, mate.

70
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:30,994
You're not my mate.

71
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:33,997
I'm heartbroken.
Now, go on, piss off.

72
00:07:34,064 --> 00:07:37,300
No, what you are is a
neo-imperialist enforcer,

73
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:39,135
from halfway around the world,

74
00:07:39,202 --> 00:07:41,604
sent here to steal my
country's natural resources,

75
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:44,174
strip-mine our sacred lands,
pollute our water,

76
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,709
oppress our heritage,

77
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:47,510
and make us wait in lines
all day.

78
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:53,216
Hey, boss man. Can I go?

79
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:55,452
Hey!

80
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:00,490
Go on, get out of here.

81
00:08:00,557 --> 00:08:02,359
Yeah, yeah.

82
00:08:11,101 --> 00:08:12,535
Adrianna, we're clear.

83
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:22,345
Kahndaq isn't safe
for us anymore.

84
00:08:22,412 --> 00:08:23,747
Let's just move the crown first,

85
00:08:23,813 --> 00:08:25,148
and then we can
worry about safe.

86
00:08:25,215 --> 00:08:26,783
I got Intergang
watching my house.

87
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,652
I gave up my job at the
university and moved four times.

88
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:31,554
It doesn't mean I'm gonna
abandon my country.

89
00:08:31,621 --> 00:08:34,290
I'm just saying, no one stays
a step ahead of them forever.

90
00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:36,426
We can't wait for things
to cool down this time.

91
00:08:36,493 --> 00:08:39,729
If I'm right, they're days
away from finding it.

92
00:08:44,634 --> 00:08:45,568
What are you doing?

93
00:08:45,635 --> 00:08:46,870
I want to come with you.

94
00:08:46,936 --> 00:08:48,171
You know it's too dangerous.

95
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:49,672
You shouldn't have
gotten involved.

96
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:52,542
Come on, I want to help you
beat those bastards.

97
00:08:52,609 --> 00:08:54,344
Adrianna,
keep your head down, please.

98
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:56,212
- You want to be a hero, huh?
- I do, yeah.

99
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,314
Go home, do your homework.

100
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:02,051
Your time will come one day,
but not today, son.

101
00:09:02,852 --> 00:09:03,987
Go!

102
00:09:04,053 --> 00:09:05,488
Go, little man.
You did good.

103
00:09:35,585 --> 00:09:38,154
That would get you a fortune
on the black market.

104
00:09:38,988 --> 00:09:40,590
Is that real Eternium?

105
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:43,593
Show us a little magic.

106
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,528
It doesn't work like that,
it's unrefined.

107
00:09:45,595 --> 00:09:47,197
You guys should get some rest.

108
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,566
I thought Intergang
seized all the old relics.

109
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:50,533
Hey, come on. Stop it.

110
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,202
I'm just curious how she got it.

111
00:09:52,268 --> 00:09:53,870
My grandmother gave it to me.

112
00:09:53,938 --> 00:09:54,838
How did she get it?

113
00:09:54,905 --> 00:09:57,407
It's not a museum piece.

114
00:09:57,474 --> 00:09:59,375
It's a family heirloom,
going all the way back

115
00:09:59,442 --> 00:10:01,511
to the days
when Kahndaq was free.

116
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:03,813
You happy now?

117
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:05,114
Cool story.

118
00:10:09,085 --> 00:10:10,753
And all I inherited
was a sweater.

119
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,523
That's not true. Baba left you
his van and his bald spot.

120
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,492
You know, some women
like a bald spot.

121
00:10:15,558 --> 00:10:18,561
Curly on the outside, smooth
on the inside. You know?

122
00:10:43,086 --> 00:10:44,587
Are you sure about this?

123
00:10:44,654 --> 00:10:46,623
The inscriptions
we found are clear.

124
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:49,359
And I'm positive
about that translation.

125
00:10:49,425 --> 00:10:51,327
There is something
inside that mountain.

126
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:57,333
What if it really
is the crown? Then what?

127
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,569
It's a source of great power.
Who gets to keep it?

128
00:10:59,636 --> 00:11:02,539
No one. We hide it
again someplace else.

129
00:11:02,605 --> 00:11:04,340
Get it out of the country
if we have to.

130
00:11:04,407 --> 00:11:06,609
It is too dangerous
for anyone to have.

131
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:09,612
This is it?

132
00:11:10,146 --> 00:11:11,314
Not yet.

133
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,352
- Are you coming?
- Eh, bad knee. I'll keep watch.

134
00:11:35,305 --> 00:11:38,508
This way.
Almost there.

135
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:47,717
"Men were given the gift
of magic,

136
00:11:47,784 --> 00:11:51,187
but their hearts
were too easily corrupted."

137
00:11:55,658 --> 00:11:56,927
Keep reading.

138
00:11:56,994 --> 00:11:59,696
"The ultimate power
was banished from the earth

139
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:02,131
and hidden... here."

140
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,568
Until now.

141
00:12:05,635 --> 00:12:08,338
This mountain has kept the Crown
of Sabbac safe for 5,000 years.

142
00:12:08,404 --> 00:12:12,042
We're 100 percent,
totally, like, no take-backs

143
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:14,210
certain that we want to move it?

144
00:12:14,277 --> 00:12:15,712
We don't have a choice.

145
00:12:16,981 --> 00:12:18,648
What happened to Ishmael?

146
00:12:20,283 --> 00:12:23,286
Great.
Don't worry, I'll find him.

147
00:12:28,025 --> 00:12:29,692

Samir?

153
00:12:49,947 --> 00:12:51,447
Samir, what happened?

154
00:12:51,514 --> 00:12:53,583
What?

155
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,818
I can't hear you.
What are you saying?

156
00:12:58,088 --> 00:13:00,657
Don't move! Unless you
want to join your mate.

157
00:13:00,723 --> 00:13:03,793
Stay where you are!

158
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,362
Oh, hey. Oh, hey. Hey...

159
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:11,868
"Turn back."

160
00:13:13,971 --> 00:13:16,140
That's what it says, no?

161
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:17,774
Yes.

162
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,909
Where is Samir?

163
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:23,680
Claustrophobic.
Needed some air.

164
00:13:23,746 --> 00:13:25,848
- Is this the way to the crown?
- I think so.

165
00:13:40,296 --> 00:13:41,798
It's a tomb.

166
00:13:47,537 --> 00:13:49,605
"Speak not his power,

167
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:52,275
so he may suffer
a dreamless sleep

168
00:13:52,341 --> 00:13:54,111
for all eternity."
Teth Adam.

169
00:13:54,178 --> 00:13:57,246
The slave who became champion
and defeated the king.

170
00:13:57,313 --> 00:13:58,681
The legend was true.

171
00:13:58,748 --> 00:14:02,719
Kahndaq...
really did have a hero once.

172
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:05,855
If he was such a hero, why'd
they bury him down here?

173
00:14:30,713 --> 00:14:31,814
The crown.

174
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:17,961
It's over.

175
00:15:18,028 --> 00:15:20,329
Now, give me the crown.

176
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:21,731
Run, Addy! Run!

177
00:15:25,002 --> 00:15:26,636
Hold fire!

178
00:15:26,702 --> 00:15:29,505
Don't hit the crown!
Get her!

179
00:15:31,741 --> 00:15:33,776
- Go! Move.
- Circle around!

180
00:15:33,843 --> 00:15:35,812
Get down!

181
00:15:40,918 --> 00:15:44,154
Say goodbye to your brother.

182
00:15:44,221 --> 00:15:45,521
In five...

183
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:47,857
four...

184
00:15:47,925 --> 00:15:48,926
...three...

185
00:15:49,692 --> 00:15:50,726
two...

186
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,361
one...

187
00:15:52,428 --> 00:15:54,597
I'm over here.

188
00:15:54,664 --> 00:15:57,500
One? You let them
get to one?

189
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,852
Any last words?

190
00:16:18,588 --> 00:16:20,523
Please tell my son...

191
00:16:24,393 --> 00:16:25,963
"Mightiest of mortals...

192
00:16:27,064 --> 00:16:28,431
God of gods,

193
00:16:28,497 --> 00:16:30,300
Six Immortal Elders by name..."

194
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:31,500
What?

195
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:33,836
"Shazam!"

196
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,649
Who the hell is that?

197
00:16:46,716 --> 00:16:49,152
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

198
00:17:07,004 --> 00:17:08,372
Check him out.

199
00:17:08,437 --> 00:17:09,973
Boss say you go.

200
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,474
Chief say your turn.

201
00:17:23,954 --> 00:17:26,555
Hey, <i>amigo.</i>
Let me see your hands.

202
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,815
Open fire!

203
00:18:06,964 --> 00:18:08,098
Go. Go.

204
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,028
We need immediate backup!
Send everything you've got!

205
00:18:50,606 --> 00:18:51,908
Ishmael!

206
00:19:01,184 --> 00:19:02,518
Ishmael!

207
00:19:28,178 --> 00:19:29,179
Let's go!

208
00:19:29,246 --> 00:19:30,846
This is as fast as I can go.

209
00:19:59,976 --> 00:20:02,345
Samir! What happened?

210
00:20:02,412 --> 00:20:04,347
What didn't happen!

211
00:20:04,414 --> 00:20:06,249
Samir fell off of a cliff.

212
00:20:06,316 --> 00:20:08,885
I had a gun to my head.

213
00:20:08,952 --> 00:20:10,954
Ishmael is buried
under a mountain.

214
00:20:12,189 --> 00:20:14,424
And you summoned
some flying magic man.

215
00:20:14,491 --> 00:20:16,326
All for what? Nothing!

216
00:20:17,827 --> 00:20:19,662
- Oh.
- Not for nothing.

217
00:20:37,847 --> 00:20:39,015
Light him up.

218
00:20:51,261 --> 00:20:53,696
Shit! Where the hell
did he come from?

219
00:20:53,762 --> 00:20:55,132
Rotor out! Go! Go!

220
00:20:56,866 --> 00:20:58,502
I can't maintain altitude!

221
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,358
Oh, shit.

222
00:22:34,564 --> 00:22:35,932
Stop! Stop the van!

223
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:14,037
Behind you!

224
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,908
Did he just catch a rocket?

225
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:56,346
God willing,
we won't see him again.

226
00:24:09,092 --> 00:24:11,995
Wait. Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

227
00:24:12,062 --> 00:24:13,862
Don't touch him,
he's made of lightning.

228
00:24:14,731 --> 00:24:15,965
Good point.

229
00:24:16,032 --> 00:24:17,500
You get him,
you're the electrician.

230
00:24:25,442 --> 00:24:26,910
Raptor team, come in.

231
00:24:26,976 --> 00:24:28,111
<i>What's your status?</i>

232
00:24:31,648 --> 00:24:33,316
Help me.

233
00:24:33,383 --> 00:24:36,920
I told you to make it look
real, not punch me in the face.

234
00:24:40,156 --> 00:24:41,624
<i>Raptor team, come in.</i>

235
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:42,926
<i>What's your status?</i>

236
00:24:42,992 --> 00:24:44,994
Status is that everyone is dead.

237
00:24:45,061 --> 00:24:47,297
<i>Ishmael, is that you?
What happened?</i>

238
00:24:47,364 --> 00:24:51,801
The crown wasn't the only thing
waiting for us down here.

239
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:53,903
<i>- Do you have it?</i>
- No.

240
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,572
But I know who does.

241
00:24:55,638 --> 00:24:57,240
<i>Copy that. We're en
route to your location.</i>

242
00:24:59,476 --> 00:25:01,010
<i>We need immediate backup.</i>

243
00:25:01,077 --> 00:25:02,479
<i>Send everything you've got!</i>

244
00:25:02,545 --> 00:25:03,947
<i>This rare, magical mineral</i>

245
00:25:04,013 --> 00:25:05,582
<i>has been mined for centuries...</i>

246
00:25:05,648 --> 00:25:06,950
<i>...reports
of an Eternium blast.</i>

247
00:25:07,016 --> 00:25:08,718
<i>It is unknown who or why...</i>

248
00:25:08,785 --> 00:25:10,353
<i>...decimated
a number of troops.</i>

249
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,055
<i>...an unidentified male.</i>

250
00:25:12,122 --> 00:25:13,890
<i>This being is
somehow able to harness...</i>

251
00:25:13,957 --> 00:25:15,358
<i>What do you think?</i>

252
00:25:15,425 --> 00:25:18,027
I think this loose cannon
needs to be locked down

253
00:25:18,094 --> 00:25:20,230
before innocent people
start getting hurt.

254
00:25:20,296 --> 00:25:22,065
Oh, and good morning
to you, too.

255
00:25:22,132 --> 00:25:23,967
<i>Shove it up your ass, Carter.</i>

256
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:26,369
<i>He's been asleep
for 5,000 years.</i>

257
00:25:26,436 --> 00:25:29,806
<i>He'll be disoriented at first.
The longer he has to adapt,</i>

258
00:25:29,873 --> 00:25:32,175
<i>the harder it will be
to take him down.</i>

259
00:25:33,543 --> 00:25:34,879
Wheels up in 30.

260
00:25:34,944 --> 00:25:36,713
<i>Who's on the team?</i>

261
00:25:46,156 --> 00:25:47,624
<i>Welcome.</i>

262
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,526
<i>Please state your name
for identification.</i>

263
00:25:49,592 --> 00:25:53,296
Uh, hi. I'm Maxine Hunkel.
I'm here to see Mr. Hall.

264
00:25:53,363 --> 00:25:54,998
<i>Confirmed. Welcome, Maxine.</i>

265
00:25:55,064 --> 00:25:56,399
Thanks!

266
00:25:56,466 --> 00:25:58,468
<i>Maxine Hunkel, aka Cyclone.</i>

267
00:25:58,535 --> 00:26:02,338
<i>Wind manipulation powers,
computer skills, smart as hell.</i>

268
00:26:02,405 --> 00:26:06,376
<i>Basically a tornado
with a 167 IQ.</i>

269
00:26:06,443 --> 00:26:08,111
<i>Sounds delightful.</i>

270
00:26:08,178 --> 00:26:10,180
<i>But please tell me
you found someone</i>

271
00:26:10,246 --> 00:26:11,848
<i>who can pack a punch.</i>

272
00:26:11,916 --> 00:26:13,850
That's where Atom Smasher
comes in.

273
00:26:13,918 --> 00:26:16,786
Al Rothstein, nephew
to the original Atom Smasher.

274
00:26:16,853 --> 00:26:18,955
He inherited his uncle's powers.

275
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,559
<i>- How's my suit? Does it fit?</i>
- No, yeah. It's perfect.

276
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:24,327
Thank you again
for letting me borrow it.

277
00:26:24,394 --> 00:26:26,162
You know, I used to watch you
all the time as a kid?

278
00:26:26,229 --> 00:26:28,698
This is literally the only thing
that I'd ever wanted in my...

279
00:26:28,765 --> 00:26:31,100
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't
let anything happen to it.</i>

280
00:26:31,167 --> 00:26:32,535
<i>It's vintage.</i>

281
00:26:32,602 --> 00:26:34,337
<i>And don't let anything
happen to you, either.</i>

282
00:26:34,404 --> 00:26:35,738
<i>Don't do anything crazy.
You listen to Carter.</i>

283
00:26:35,805 --> 00:26:38,107
I'm gonna make you proud,
Uncle Al. I promise.

284
00:26:40,844 --> 00:26:42,045
<i>They seem green.</i>

285
00:26:42,111 --> 00:26:43,446
That's why I called in Kent.

286
00:26:46,015 --> 00:26:48,051
<i>Kent's been out of
action for a little while,</i>

287
00:26:48,117 --> 00:26:49,954
<i>but I can't do this without him.</i>

288
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:52,388
<i>Takes magic to fight magic
and the man's got</i>

289
00:26:52,455 --> 00:26:54,257
<i>nearly God-level powers.</i>

290
00:26:59,729 --> 00:27:02,198
<i>It might take
a lot more than that.</i>

291
00:27:02,265 --> 00:27:04,200
<i>Are you sure they can take him?</i>

292
00:27:04,267 --> 00:27:07,403
Waller, you find us a cell
that can hold him...

293
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,172
we'll take care of the rest.

294
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:10,473
<i>Good luck.</i>

295
00:27:16,045 --> 00:27:17,514
This is gonna be fun.

296
00:27:33,696 --> 00:27:36,766
- We're here, sir.
- Hmm? Oh, right.

297
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,572
Was I staring again?

298
00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:45,441
- Only half an hour or so, sir.
- Hmm.

299
00:27:45,508 --> 00:27:47,110
Maybe next time, honk the horn?

300
00:27:47,176 --> 00:27:48,411
Of course, sir.

301
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,828
So what's the op?

302
00:28:05,896 --> 00:28:07,363
We're headed to Kahndaq
to apprehend and contain

303
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,265
a Class-A rogue metahuman.

304
00:28:09,332 --> 00:28:10,733
I didn't bring a passport.

305
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:15,204
We don't need passports.
We're the Justice Society.

306
00:28:22,445 --> 00:28:25,015
Is this entirely made
out of Nth metal?

307
00:28:25,081 --> 00:28:27,350
Everything down to the screws.

308
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:29,752
Completely indestructible.

309
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:31,754
I'll be in the cockpit
if you need me.

310
00:28:34,223 --> 00:28:36,092
It's pretty cool.
You got any snacks?

311
00:28:38,695 --> 00:28:40,697
It takes a lot of energy
to smash atoms.

312
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,545
Here.

313
00:28:56,245 --> 00:28:57,513
Oh! Thanks.

314
00:28:59,282 --> 00:29:00,918
I'm Al, by the way.

315
00:29:00,985 --> 00:29:02,285
Maxine.

316
00:29:08,124 --> 00:29:09,225
What do you do?

317
00:29:09,292 --> 00:29:11,127
Wind. You?

318
00:29:11,194 --> 00:29:12,462
I grow.

319
00:29:13,063 --> 00:29:14,197
Cool.

320
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:43,760
Whoa!

321
00:29:58,808 --> 00:30:00,911
Don't worry about that.
I can get another one.

322
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,382
Uh, my mom's
not much of a doctor,

323
00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:08,317
but you should probably
leave th...

324
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,521
Or do that.

325
00:30:15,692 --> 00:30:17,293
I know you have a lot
to catch up on.

326
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,595
But I was thinking
we could help each other.

327
00:30:19,662 --> 00:30:22,032
- Move.
- I'm Amon, by the way.

328
00:30:22,099 --> 00:30:23,299
I didn't ask for your name.

329
00:30:23,366 --> 00:30:24,600
You're Teth Adam, right?

330
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:26,402
Everyone in Kahndaq
knows your story.

331
00:30:26,469 --> 00:30:28,005
- I said move.
- My mom said you took out

332
00:30:28,072 --> 00:30:29,839
a bunch of Intergang soldiers
in the desert.

333
00:30:29,907 --> 00:30:31,474
Because they wouldn't move
out of my way.

334
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:32,943
So you can really fly
and stop bullets,

335
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,878
'cause that's really crucial
to my plan.

336
00:30:34,945 --> 00:30:36,479
And is it really you stopping
the bullets, or is it the suit?

337
00:30:36,546 --> 00:30:38,115
Wait, what's your top speed?

338
00:30:38,182 --> 00:30:39,849
I'm sure you're fast, but
how fast? Like Flash fast?

339
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:48,992
Wait, did you really not
have mirrors back then?

340
00:30:50,693 --> 00:30:53,197
Wow, I guess a lot does
change in 5,000 years.

341
00:30:55,933 --> 00:30:57,333
Five thousand years?

342
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,969
Yeah, that's how long
you were in the tomb.

343
00:30:59,036 --> 00:31:00,770
Until my mom woke you up.

344
00:31:00,837 --> 00:31:03,372
So you've got stopping bullets,
check. Flying, check.

345
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:05,408
And lightning thing,
that's a big check.

346
00:31:11,414 --> 00:31:12,815
I don't know this place.

347
00:31:12,883 --> 00:31:14,383
This is your home.

348
00:31:17,955 --> 00:31:19,422
Then my home is gone.

349
00:31:35,271 --> 00:31:36,672
What happened to the crown?

350
00:31:37,406 --> 00:31:39,042
Too much?

351
00:31:42,578 --> 00:31:44,882
You know it's
cursed with demons, right?

352
00:31:54,892 --> 00:31:59,428
"Life is the...
only path to death."

353
00:32:00,863 --> 00:32:02,032
No shit.

354
00:32:05,635 --> 00:32:08,939
"Teth Adam was a Bronze Age
Kahndaqi demi-God.

355
00:32:09,006 --> 00:32:13,177
He defeated King Ahk-Ton
in approximately 2,600 BC."

356
00:32:13,243 --> 00:32:14,744
There. That's you. See?

357
00:32:14,811 --> 00:32:16,213
That's the statue
they built of you.

358
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,847
And now you're back.

359
00:32:17,915 --> 00:32:19,348
Our country's been oppressed
by one invader after another

360
00:32:19,415 --> 00:32:21,584
ever since you left.

361
00:32:21,651 --> 00:32:24,453
My point is,
Kahndaq still isn't free.

362
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,789
We could really use a superhero
right about now.

363
00:32:27,824 --> 00:32:29,492
I'm no hero.

364
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:31,962
What?
Superman, Batman, Aquaman...

365
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:33,897
You're way more stacked
than any of them.

366
00:32:33,964 --> 00:32:36,365
And they're not coming
to Kahndaq to save us.

367
00:32:36,432 --> 00:32:38,534
But you could stop Intergang
all by yourself,

368
00:32:38,601 --> 00:32:40,037
just like you did King Ahk-Ton.

369
00:32:40,103 --> 00:32:41,470
You're our only hope.

370
00:33:06,163 --> 00:33:08,131
Wizards.

371
00:33:08,198 --> 00:33:09,799
I can fix it. Don't worry.

372
00:33:11,734 --> 00:33:13,904
I'm not a wizard.

373
00:33:15,072 --> 00:33:18,008
Hey, Mom.
He's awake.

374
00:33:18,075 --> 00:33:19,943
I told you
not to go in your room.

375
00:33:20,776 --> 00:33:22,145
It was you who spoke.

376
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,083
You woke me.

377
00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:28,551
I didn't have a choice. I'd
be dead if it hadn't worked.

378
00:33:28,618 --> 00:33:30,220
The men in my tomb,
they were your enemies?

379
00:33:30,287 --> 00:33:32,622
- Yes.
- Then your enemies are vanquished,

380
00:33:32,688 --> 00:33:34,423
condemned to the eternal
sleep of the damned.

381
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:37,327
Actually, we still have a lot of
enemies that need vanquishing.

382
00:33:37,393 --> 00:33:38,996
Then destroy them.

383
00:33:39,062 --> 00:33:41,331
Intergang have guns and
flybikes and Eternium rockets.

384
00:33:41,397 --> 00:33:42,665
We have my mom.

385
00:33:44,134 --> 00:33:45,468
Prove your strength.

386
00:33:45,534 --> 00:33:47,204
Destroy your enemy
and all he cares about.

387
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:48,504
Make him beg for mercy,

388
00:33:48,571 --> 00:33:50,941
but deny it
until his final breath.

389
00:33:51,008 --> 00:33:52,376
Interesting, okay?

390
00:33:52,441 --> 00:33:53,876
I appreciate
what you did for me,

391
00:33:53,944 --> 00:33:57,446
but I do not want you
teaching my son violence.

392
00:33:58,481 --> 00:34:00,750
I understand.
You want his father

393
00:34:00,816 --> 00:34:02,185
to teach him violence.

394
00:34:02,252 --> 00:34:04,021
- Gross, that's my brother.
- That's my sister.

395
00:34:04,087 --> 00:34:06,156
- His father's dead.
- I'm sorry.

396
00:34:07,823 --> 00:34:09,592
Who do you want
to teach him violence then?

397
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:12,296
Yeah, Mom. Who do you want
to teach me violence?

398
00:34:12,362 --> 00:34:13,829
No one.

399
00:34:13,897 --> 00:34:18,001
I want a champion to help
free Kahndaq from Intergang.

400
00:34:19,236 --> 00:34:20,736
Please, help us.

401
00:34:39,089 --> 00:34:40,190
Wait! Wait.

402
00:34:41,657 --> 00:34:44,493
- Where are you going?
- I shouldn't be here.

403
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,662
You don't feel any loyalty
to us at all?

404
00:34:46,729 --> 00:34:48,098
Not really, no.

405
00:34:48,165 --> 00:34:49,699
You're not seeing
the full possibilities here.

406
00:34:49,765 --> 00:34:51,500
I don't know what it was like
in ancient times,

407
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:53,803
but having superpowers is
kind of a big deal in our world.

408
00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:55,471
Maybe clean up your outfit
a little bit,

409
00:34:55,538 --> 00:34:56,739
get a cape, change your name.

410
00:34:56,806 --> 00:34:58,574
Teth Adam is a very strong name.

411
00:34:58,641 --> 00:34:59,910
It's a little outdated.

412
00:34:59,977 --> 00:35:01,510
And you definitely
need a catchphrase.

413
00:35:01,577 --> 00:35:02,980
Something blackout
bad-ass to say

414
00:35:03,046 --> 00:35:05,449
right before you absolutely
cook some dude.

415
00:35:05,514 --> 00:35:06,849
I don't waste words on the dead.

416
00:35:06,917 --> 00:35:08,718
Well, yeah, kind of like that,
but more catchy.

417
00:35:08,784 --> 00:35:10,053
I was thinking, like,

418
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,356
"Tell them the Man in Black
sent you."

419
00:35:12,422 --> 00:35:13,823
- Them?
- You know, gods, demons...

420
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,725
Whoever's waiting for us
in the afterlife.

421
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:17,760
And you wear a lot of black, so
we should really lean into that.

422
00:35:17,827 --> 00:35:20,563
My point is,
you could be famous.

423
00:35:20,629 --> 00:35:22,366
Magazines, lunch boxes,
video games.

424
00:35:22,432 --> 00:35:25,568
And the superhero industrial
complex is worth a lot of money.

425
00:35:25,634 --> 00:35:27,603
I don't need a box for my lunch.

426
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,638
Anyone you've ever known
is dead.

427
00:35:32,442 --> 00:35:33,910
What else are you gonna do?

428
00:35:38,848 --> 00:35:40,850
Wait! Where are you going?

429
00:35:56,299 --> 00:35:59,036
Waller's file needs a bit
to be desired.

430
00:35:59,102 --> 00:36:00,904
Most of this was
considered a myth

431
00:36:00,971 --> 00:36:02,805
until yesterday afternoon.

432
00:36:02,872 --> 00:36:06,076
He's a bad man, Kent.
What else do you need to know?

433
00:36:06,143 --> 00:36:08,178
When you've seen as many
different futures as I have,

434
00:36:08,245 --> 00:36:10,646
you cease to believe
in absolutes.

435
00:36:12,581 --> 00:36:14,418
What are you laughing at?

436
00:36:14,484 --> 00:36:17,087
I'm not laughing.
That was a smirk.

437
00:36:17,154 --> 00:36:19,588
I know.
That's how you laugh.

438
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:20,924
I've missed having you around

439
00:36:20,991 --> 00:36:23,927
to spout old cryptic shit
like that.

440
00:36:23,994 --> 00:36:25,962
Almost as much as I've missed
having you around

441
00:36:26,029 --> 00:36:28,664
to ignore all my advice.
Carter...

442
00:36:30,067 --> 00:36:31,902
This is not a very good plan.

443
00:36:36,106 --> 00:36:37,908
Yeah, well...

444
00:36:37,974 --> 00:36:40,277
A bad plan is better than
no plan at all.

445
00:36:42,611 --> 00:36:44,247
If only there were
a third option.

446
00:36:47,884 --> 00:36:50,087
I wouldn't touch that
if I was you.

447
00:36:50,954 --> 00:36:52,089
Why not?

448
00:36:52,155 --> 00:36:53,756
'Cause that helmet
is from another planet.

449
00:36:53,823 --> 00:36:55,058
It's millions of years old.

450
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:57,060
It chooses who it lets touch it.

451
00:36:58,295 --> 00:36:59,829
- Like Kent?
- Yeah.

452
00:36:59,896 --> 00:37:03,533
Like, Kent is literally
possessed when he puts it on.

453
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,968
What happens
if I touch it anyway?

454
00:37:05,035 --> 00:37:08,171
Soul crushing terror?
Or... something.

455
00:37:08,238 --> 00:37:11,308
So we should probably
put a towel on it, right?

456
00:37:11,374 --> 00:37:12,675
Coming up on it.

457
00:37:12,741 --> 00:37:14,844
Ready stations in five.

458
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:17,447
Hey, why is this Adam dude
so pissed off?

459
00:37:17,514 --> 00:37:18,714
He's not some dude.

460
00:37:18,781 --> 00:37:21,817
He's a weapon
of mass destruction.

461
00:37:21,885 --> 00:37:23,686
You don't have to
raise your hand.

462
00:37:23,752 --> 00:37:26,356
Question, if he's so powerful,
how are we supposed to stop him?

463
00:37:26,423 --> 00:37:29,526
If we can get him
to say the word, "Shazam,"

464
00:37:29,593 --> 00:37:31,694
Teth Adam will lose his power.

465
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,063
And we're hoping since he's had

466
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,432
a few thousand years
to sleep it off,

467
00:37:35,499 --> 00:37:38,734
we can peacefully negotiate
the terms of his existence.

468
00:37:38,801 --> 00:37:40,937
From the footage you showed us,
he doesn't really seem like

469
00:37:41,004 --> 00:37:43,173
a "peacefully negotiate"
kind of guy.

470
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,474
Correct.

471
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:45,808
Look alive.

472
00:37:48,345 --> 00:37:49,246
We're here.

473
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:48,071
This is a message

474
00:38:48,138 --> 00:38:49,506
- for all Intergang soldiers.
- Hey! Stop!

475
00:38:49,573 --> 00:38:51,074
Kahndaq has its own
official superhero now.

476
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:16,799
Teth Adam!

477
00:39:18,867 --> 00:39:20,769
Please.

478
00:39:20,836 --> 00:39:23,872
There he is! Move!

479
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,610
- Teth Adam!
- Move!

480
00:39:26,676 --> 00:39:28,744
Teth Adam...!

481
00:39:28,811 --> 00:39:31,747
Get up! Who's gonna
save you now, mate?

482
00:39:34,985 --> 00:39:36,319
The statue?

483
00:39:37,954 --> 00:39:39,389
That's my son.

484
00:39:39,456 --> 00:39:42,058
He's just a boy. He doesn't
know what he's doing.

485
00:39:42,926 --> 00:39:44,793
What are you doing?

486
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,731
Hang on. I recognize you.

487
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,299
Where is the crown?

488
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:52,035
Let's go!

489
00:40:06,483 --> 00:40:07,884
You could've showed up
a bit sooner.

490
00:40:07,951 --> 00:40:09,219
But that was dope.

491
00:40:14,758 --> 00:40:16,026
We need backup down here.

492
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,234
Tell them
the Man in Black sent you.

493
00:40:58,301 --> 00:41:01,237
Well, yes, but not to me.
Say it to the bad guys.

494
00:41:02,605 --> 00:41:03,807
But before you zap them.

495
00:41:03,872 --> 00:41:05,575
- Catchphrase, then kill.
- Yes.

496
00:41:28,465 --> 00:41:29,566
He's here.

497
00:41:29,632 --> 00:41:30,700
You sense his presence?

498
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:32,736
No.

499
00:41:32,802 --> 00:41:36,139
I assume he's the only person
in Kahndaq that can do that.

500
00:41:47,016 --> 00:41:49,919
Fate and I'll take the lead.
Listen...

501
00:41:49,986 --> 00:41:51,955
Now, you two hang back
'til we call you.

502
00:41:52,021 --> 00:41:53,623
We're the anvil,
you're the hammer.

503
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:55,225
You're ready.

504
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:56,993
Uh, he just dropped the, um...

505
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,995
Shit!

506
00:42:04,968 --> 00:42:06,269
Be prepared.

507
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:15,211
Um...

508
00:42:27,157 --> 00:42:28,391
Behind you!

509
00:42:41,971 --> 00:42:43,306
Let us be!

510
00:42:44,574 --> 00:42:46,976
I don't know their crimes,
but whatever they are,

511
00:42:47,043 --> 00:42:49,179
these men should face
due process.

512
00:42:53,249 --> 00:42:54,951
Then let the gods
make their judgment.

513
00:42:55,018 --> 00:42:56,453
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

514
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:58,721
You don't look like
an Intergang.

515
00:42:58,788 --> 00:43:01,157
We're the Justice Society.

516
00:43:01,224 --> 00:43:04,427
Our mission is to protect
global stability.

517
00:43:04,494 --> 00:43:08,031
We're here to restore
peace to Kahndaq.

518
00:43:08,097 --> 00:43:11,134
And we will use force
if necessary.

519
00:43:13,203 --> 00:43:15,004
Force is always necessary.

520
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,506
Teth Adam.

521
00:43:16,573 --> 00:43:20,243
We know who you are
and what you are capable of.

522
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:23,112
There's no place for you
in the world of man.

523
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,582
You have two choices.

524
00:43:26,249 --> 00:43:28,151
Kneel or die.

525
00:43:29,285 --> 00:43:31,154
I was a slave until I died.

526
00:43:32,957 --> 00:43:34,457
Then I was reborn a God.

527
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:38,261
I kneel before no one.

528
00:43:45,802 --> 00:43:47,570
Fate, give me a distraction.

529
00:44:40,356 --> 00:44:43,226
Just say, "Shazam."
We all go home.

530
00:44:45,795 --> 00:44:47,096
I don't have a home.

531
00:45:19,997 --> 00:45:21,097
Whoo!

532
00:45:21,164 --> 00:45:22,465
Look at that suit.
It's cool.

533
00:45:22,532 --> 00:45:24,334
- Thanks. You, too.
- Thank you.

534
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,269
It was a hand-me-down.
It was from my uncle.

535
00:45:32,775 --> 00:45:34,877
Hawkman just
does not give up, does he?

536
00:45:34,945 --> 00:45:36,179
Nope.

537
00:45:48,758 --> 00:45:51,127
Amon, where are you going?
Wait!

538
00:45:51,194 --> 00:45:52,462
To help him!

539
00:46:13,249 --> 00:46:15,852
Cyclone, Smasher,
now is your time.

540
00:46:15,919 --> 00:46:17,420
Let's roll!

541
00:46:17,487 --> 00:46:19,188
What are you doing?
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

542
00:47:01,065 --> 00:47:01,932
No!

543
00:47:07,804 --> 00:47:08,838
I'll be right there!

544
00:47:18,347 --> 00:47:20,216
You have the Crown of Sabbac.

545
00:48:03,459 --> 00:48:04,962
I can't hold him much longer.

546
00:48:10,968 --> 00:48:12,035
Move!

547
00:48:32,923 --> 00:48:35,125
I'm coming! I'm zeroing
in on your location!

548
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:10,294
I got him! Guys, I got him.

549
00:49:10,359 --> 00:49:13,696
It's, uh... it's me, Al. In
case you didn't recognize me.

550
00:49:13,763 --> 00:49:15,299
There's something different
about you.

551
00:49:15,398 --> 00:49:16,900
Can't quite put my finger on it.

552
00:49:16,967 --> 00:49:18,701
You know, it's probably because
I'm six stories tall now.

553
00:49:18,768 --> 00:49:20,369
But you... You're like a tornado.

554
00:49:20,436 --> 00:49:22,872
I thought the two of you
did great work.

555
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,908
First time out... Bravo.

556
00:49:24,975 --> 00:49:27,443
Thanks. I mean, I got a little
turned around back there,

557
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:29,012
but, uh,
it all worked out, right?

558
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:30,546
You're damn right it did.

559
00:49:30,613 --> 00:49:32,448
Let's hope Waller has
that cell ready for him.

560
00:49:38,088 --> 00:49:41,158
You want me
to keep my hand here, right?

561
00:49:41,225 --> 00:49:42,425
You'd better not let him up.

562
00:49:43,961 --> 00:49:46,997
Uh... What do I...
What do I do? Guys?

563
00:49:51,034 --> 00:49:52,002
Whoo-hoo!

564
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:06,149
Long live the Champion!

565
00:50:06,216 --> 00:50:08,584
Long live the Champion!

566
00:50:08,651 --> 00:50:10,753
Long live the Champion!

567
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,990
Long live the Champion!

568
00:50:20,563 --> 00:50:23,699
Yeah, he's definitely
still breathing.

569
00:50:23,766 --> 00:50:28,404
Long live the Champion!
Long live the Champion!

570
00:50:46,589 --> 00:50:48,524
Where are you going?
We need to go after him.

571
00:50:48,591 --> 00:50:50,093
We're not strong enough.

572
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,728
Oh, well, maybe next time
use your powers of prediction

573
00:50:52,795 --> 00:50:55,265
to figure that out before
we get our asses kicked.

574
00:50:55,332 --> 00:50:57,000
I'm working on it.

575
00:50:57,067 --> 00:50:58,201
Miss?

576
00:50:58,268 --> 00:51:00,103
Excuse me, you mind
if I look in your bag?

577
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:01,405
Yes, I do mind.

578
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:02,805
Where are you going
with this, Kent?

579
00:51:02,872 --> 00:51:04,374
She's got the Crown of Sabbac.

580
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,009
One catastrophe at a time.

581
00:51:06,076 --> 00:51:07,743
We can't give him
a chance to regroup.

582
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:09,578
He's been spotted
entering the palace.

583
00:51:09,645 --> 00:51:11,614
It's safe to say he's not
going there to surrender.

584
00:51:11,681 --> 00:51:13,183
Why do you want
Teth Adam to surrender?

585
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:15,551
He's the Champion of Kahndaq.
Who are you?

586
00:51:15,618 --> 00:51:17,553
The Justice Society?

587
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:19,822
We have been living
under military occupation

588
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:22,392
for 27 years,
and never seen you before.

589
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:25,162
You didn't come when
Intergang invaded our country,

590
00:51:25,228 --> 00:51:27,898
when they stole our resources
and killed my husband.

591
00:51:27,965 --> 00:51:30,367
But now, we finally
have our own hero

592
00:51:30,434 --> 00:51:33,669
and you decide to fly
down here and save us?

593
00:51:33,736 --> 00:51:36,239
Thank you, but...
we're covered.

594
00:51:36,306 --> 00:51:40,077
Go and protect international
stability someplace else.

595
00:51:40,143 --> 00:51:42,611
Oh, and second,
I don't have the crown.

596
00:51:42,678 --> 00:51:44,647
Let me spell it out for you.

597
00:51:44,714 --> 00:51:46,649
Teth Adam can't be
Kahndaq's champion,

598
00:51:46,716 --> 00:51:48,418
because he is not a hero.

599
00:51:48,484 --> 00:51:50,486
Tell that...

600
00:51:50,553 --> 00:51:53,556
to all the people
he just liberated.

601
00:51:54,724 --> 00:51:56,893
I know what this looks like.
I... I do.

602
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,362
But I can assure you that my t...

603
00:52:01,797 --> 00:52:04,134
I am so sorry.
Was that expensive?

604
00:52:05,902 --> 00:52:08,338
Me and you. When we
get back to the ship...

605
00:52:08,405 --> 00:52:10,040
- Yes, sir.
- Me and you.

606
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,641
I...

607
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:14,677
Can we please
just see the crown?

608
00:52:15,212 --> 00:52:16,512
I don't have it.

609
00:52:34,864 --> 00:52:36,433
We don't have time for this.

610
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,435
Teth Adam first, then the crown.

611
00:52:38,502 --> 00:52:40,803
You don't have
any authority here.

612
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:42,039
Teth Adam has done nothing...

613
00:52:42,105 --> 00:52:44,874
Teth Adam is not
who you think he is.

614
00:52:44,941 --> 00:52:46,510
And how would you know?

615
00:52:46,575 --> 00:52:47,978
We have access to ancient texts

616
00:52:48,045 --> 00:52:50,047
that have been kept secret
for centuries.

617
00:52:50,113 --> 00:52:52,782
And what exactly do these
supposed ancient texts say?

618
00:52:52,848 --> 00:52:55,952
They say that his rage
nearly destroyed Kahndaq.

619
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,522
And we flew
all the way over here

620
00:52:58,587 --> 00:53:00,756
to stop it from happening again.

621
00:53:03,927 --> 00:53:05,429
You want to go in there alone?

622
00:53:05,495 --> 00:53:07,130
Are you sure?

623
00:53:07,197 --> 00:53:09,865
You want to go in and fight
Teth Adam again, be my guest.

624
00:53:09,933 --> 00:53:12,235
But if you actually want
to resolve things peacefully,

625
00:53:12,302 --> 00:53:14,570
without destroying
the rest of my city,

626
00:53:14,637 --> 00:53:15,939
I'm your only shot.

627
00:53:38,761 --> 00:53:40,596
You brought
the invaders with you.

628
00:53:40,663 --> 00:53:42,832
They only want to talk.

629
00:53:42,899 --> 00:53:46,169
They can talk.
I won't listen.

630
00:53:48,038 --> 00:53:50,606
When I was a little girl, my
grandmother told me the story

631
00:53:50,673 --> 00:53:53,642
of how the Champion came
to this exact spot

632
00:53:53,709 --> 00:53:55,479
to free the enslaved people
of Kahndaq

633
00:53:55,545 --> 00:53:57,613
by defeating King Ahk-Ton
in battle.

634
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,648
But according
to the Justice Society,

635
00:53:59,715 --> 00:54:01,351
that's not really what happened.

636
00:54:01,418 --> 00:54:04,354
They say that you didn't
come here to seek justice.

637
00:54:13,163 --> 00:54:15,731
<i>That you came to exact revenge.</i>

638
00:54:31,348 --> 00:54:32,715
<i>And in your anger...</i>

639
00:54:41,391 --> 00:54:44,827
<i>...your power grew,
until it became uncontrollable.</i>

640
00:54:52,169 --> 00:54:55,071
And the Council of Wizards
was forced to deem you unworthy

641
00:54:55,138 --> 00:54:56,907
of the gifts that
you were granted.

642
00:55:25,035 --> 00:55:27,736
It wasn't your tomb
that I opened, was it?

643
00:55:30,806 --> 00:55:32,309
It was your prison.

644
00:55:33,776 --> 00:55:36,279
And, now, there's
a statue of you.

645
00:55:36,346 --> 00:55:40,116
Out of the hope that someday
Kahndaq's champion would return.

646
00:55:40,183 --> 00:55:41,885
But it's built on a lie,
isn't it?

647
00:55:41,952 --> 00:55:43,954
I never said I was a hero.

648
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,156
I never claimed to be anything.

649
00:55:46,223 --> 00:55:48,625
You may not have been a hero.

650
00:55:48,692 --> 00:55:51,727
But that doesn't mean
that you can't be one now.

651
00:55:58,902 --> 00:56:00,337
I will hear them out.

652
00:56:00,403 --> 00:56:02,906
But if they choose to fight,
they choose to die.

653
00:56:08,678 --> 00:56:10,280
Uncle Karim!

654
00:56:10,347 --> 00:56:11,715
I can't believe you're
sitting around watching TV

655
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,049
when the most epic day ever is...

656
00:56:13,116 --> 00:56:15,751
In here, little man.

657
00:56:17,287 --> 00:56:19,589
Ishmael! My mom said
you got buried in the tomb.

658
00:56:19,656 --> 00:56:21,024
Funny story, he didn't.

659
00:56:21,091 --> 00:56:23,093
Where's Adrianna?

660
00:56:23,159 --> 00:56:24,327
She's back at the square...

661
00:56:24,394 --> 00:56:25,729
We should go bail her out
right now.

662
00:56:25,794 --> 00:56:26,862
But she's the one
who sent me home

663
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:28,064
to make sure the crown's safe.

664
00:56:28,131 --> 00:56:29,865
It is safe, okay?
Somewhere else.

665
00:56:29,933 --> 00:56:32,235
- Definitely not here. Let...
- Okay...

666
00:56:32,302 --> 00:56:33,802
- Put the bag down.
- What are you doing?

667
00:56:33,869 --> 00:56:36,473
Back away.
Put the bag down, now.

668
00:56:39,943 --> 00:56:41,278
Give him the bag.
Give him the bag.

669
00:56:43,179 --> 00:56:44,481
Very good. Back away.

670
00:56:45,715 --> 00:56:47,450
- Back away.
- Okay, I'm...

671
00:56:57,227 --> 00:56:59,362
It's all going
to be okay, little man.

672
00:56:59,429 --> 00:57:01,797
Let me teach you some
history that you've never learned

673
00:57:01,864 --> 00:57:03,099
in one of your mother's classes.

674
00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:04,734
When we had a powerful king,

675
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,571
Kahndaq used to be something
much better than free.

676
00:57:08,638 --> 00:57:09,906
It used to be great.

677
00:57:09,973 --> 00:57:11,608
Run, Amon, run!

678
00:57:30,427 --> 00:57:31,361
Crash the building.

679
00:57:31,428 --> 00:57:33,096
I lost the kid.
He has the crown.

680
00:57:49,245 --> 00:57:51,214
We're here
to negotiate the terms

681
00:57:51,281 --> 00:57:53,783
of your peaceful surrender.

682
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:57,220
I'm not peaceful.
Nor do I surrender.

683
00:57:57,287 --> 00:57:59,589
What have your powers
ever given to you?

684
00:57:59,656 --> 00:58:01,624
Nothing but heartache.

685
00:58:01,691 --> 00:58:03,059
You have no idea.

686
00:58:03,126 --> 00:58:04,627
Then why are you
making this hard on us?

687
00:58:04,694 --> 00:58:07,097
We both know you're
not supposed to be here.

688
00:58:07,163 --> 00:58:09,532
It is you who is not
supposed to be here.

689
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:12,235
I want you all to leave
Kahndaq and never return.

690
00:58:12,302 --> 00:58:16,172
Gladly,
with you as our prisoner.

691
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:18,874
How 'bout I rip your
little wings off instead?

692
00:58:18,942 --> 00:58:20,377
I'd like to see you try.

693
00:58:20,443 --> 00:58:22,145
Okay, more fighting
won't solve this.

694
00:58:22,212 --> 00:58:23,480
- I disagree.
- Me, too.

695
00:58:23,546 --> 00:58:25,181
Looks like we found
common ground.

696
00:58:25,248 --> 00:58:26,983
This can only end one way.

697
00:58:28,752 --> 00:58:30,086
- <i>Mom?</i>
- Amon.

698
00:58:30,153 --> 00:58:31,988
I got home and Ishmael
was in the kitchen.

699
00:58:32,055 --> 00:58:33,390
Ishmael's dead.

700
00:58:33,456 --> 00:58:35,458
No, he shot Uncle Karim,
and he's after the crown.

701
00:58:36,893 --> 00:58:38,361
Ground forces...

702
00:58:38,428 --> 00:58:40,530
I'm hiding in our building,
and Intergang's here.

703
00:58:40,597 --> 00:58:42,232
They're coming!

704
00:58:42,298 --> 00:58:44,434
Intergang are after my son.

705
00:58:44,501 --> 00:58:47,670
They don't want him, they
want the Crown of Sabbac.

706
00:58:47,737 --> 00:58:48,938
I know you're not a hero.

707
00:58:49,005 --> 00:58:50,173
But you're not a monster,
either.

708
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,808
I don't care what anyone says.

709
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:53,676
You saved me in that cave.

710
00:58:53,743 --> 00:58:56,846
You didn't know me and your
first instinct was to save me.

711
00:58:56,913 --> 00:58:59,649
I'm begging you.
Please, save my son.

712
00:59:04,053 --> 00:59:05,355
Check the whole place clean.

713
00:59:05,422 --> 00:59:07,424
Cover all access points!

714
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:10,226
Keep looking!

715
00:59:17,634 --> 00:59:19,102
Area's clear.

716
00:59:19,869 --> 00:59:21,337
There! Take him!

717
00:59:21,404 --> 00:59:22,972
Right there, right there!

718
00:59:25,842 --> 00:59:27,076
Move, move!

719
00:59:27,143 --> 00:59:28,711
Don't shoot him, I need him!

720
00:59:38,188 --> 00:59:40,223
He's going down,
he's going down!

721
00:59:47,297 --> 00:59:48,731
End of the road, kid!

722
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,041
Release the child.

723
00:59:58,107 --> 00:59:59,442
Whatever you say.

724
01:00:02,745 --> 01:00:04,414
Yes! Thank you!

725
01:00:04,481 --> 01:00:07,150
But maybe be more careful
with your word choice next time.

726
01:00:10,453 --> 01:00:12,455
Oh! And remember
your catchphrase!

727
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:19,062
Time to go, Amon.

728
01:00:26,536 --> 01:00:28,271
- Where's the crown?
- What crown?

729
01:00:28,338 --> 01:00:30,941
- You want to be brave, eh?
- I want you to go to hell.

730
01:00:31,007 --> 01:00:32,308
That's the plan, little man.

731
01:00:32,375 --> 01:00:34,177
We're gonna go for a ride.
Come on.

732
01:00:49,025 --> 01:00:50,860
Put me down! Put me down!

733
01:00:50,928 --> 01:00:52,963
You should really be more careful
with your word choice next time.

734
01:00:53,029 --> 01:00:54,899
And tell them that
the Man in Black...

735
01:01:01,371 --> 01:01:03,673
He's right behind me.
Where the hell is everybody?

736
01:01:14,117 --> 01:01:15,318
Mom?

737
01:01:15,385 --> 01:01:18,221
Amon, where are you?
No, no, no. What?

738
01:01:18,288 --> 01:01:20,024
I'm in one of their bikes.

739
01:01:20,089 --> 01:01:21,391
What bikes?

740
01:01:40,476 --> 01:01:41,611
Amon!

741
01:01:41,678 --> 01:01:42,545
Can you hear me?

742
01:01:42,612 --> 01:01:43,746
<i>Mom, I'm okay.</i>

743
01:01:50,787 --> 01:01:51,788
Shit!

744
01:01:57,962 --> 01:01:59,362
Activate infrared.

745
01:02:05,201 --> 01:02:06,636
What are you doing?

746
01:02:06,703 --> 01:02:07,770
Searching for the child.

747
01:02:07,837 --> 01:02:09,105
No, you're murdering people.

748
01:02:09,172 --> 01:02:10,673
How else do I find the child?

749
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:13,077
I can help you, but no more
extrajudicial killings.

750
01:02:13,142 --> 01:02:14,744
I don't need any help.

751
01:02:16,981 --> 01:02:18,514
<i>Smasher, Cyclone!</i>

752
01:02:18,581 --> 01:02:20,050
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

753
01:02:20,116 --> 01:02:22,052
- Come on, let's go!
- Uh, okay.

754
01:02:22,118 --> 01:02:24,587
Okay. I got this. I got this.
On the count of three.

755
01:02:24,654 --> 01:02:26,155
One, two...

756
01:02:26,222 --> 01:02:28,524
This feels a lot higher
than last time.

757
01:02:28,591 --> 01:02:30,393
Whoa!

758
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,161
Ah! That was not cool!

759
01:02:40,536 --> 01:02:42,238
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

760
01:02:42,305 --> 01:02:44,140
Hey, guys. Slow down.

761
01:02:47,543 --> 01:02:49,746
I got you! I got you!

762
01:03:08,531 --> 01:03:11,367
Hey, careful, dude!
I almost hit you.

763
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,775
I am so sorry. I just...

764
01:03:18,841 --> 01:03:20,243
I don't really have
peripheral vision in the mask.

765
01:03:20,309 --> 01:03:21,644
It's my uncle's.
I'll get it tailored.

766
01:03:22,178 --> 01:03:23,813
Me and you.

767
01:03:23,881 --> 01:03:24,747
Roger that.

768
01:04:09,459 --> 01:04:11,561
- Who are you?
- Call me Dr. Fate.

769
01:04:11,627 --> 01:04:15,132
How bad is it, Doc?
Am I dying?

770
01:04:15,199 --> 01:04:16,566
I'm not that kind of doctor.

771
01:04:16,632 --> 01:04:18,468
But don't worry,
I can see the future.

772
01:04:18,534 --> 01:04:20,837
This isn't how you're
going to die.

773
01:04:20,904 --> 01:04:22,039
How do I die, then?

774
01:04:22,106 --> 01:04:23,706
Just stay away from electricity.

775
01:04:23,773 --> 01:04:26,709
Wait, what?
I'm an electrician.

776
01:04:26,776 --> 01:04:28,444
How the hell
am I supposed to do that?

777
01:05:36,113 --> 01:05:38,282
Oh, God.

778
01:05:38,347 --> 01:05:40,583
The Champion's coming for you.
You know that, right?

779
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:41,885
I'm counting on it.

780
01:05:53,362 --> 01:05:55,132
Please don't.

781
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:57,100
<i>Teth Adam. Where are you?</i>

782
01:05:57,167 --> 01:05:58,168
You followed me?

783
01:05:58,235 --> 01:05:59,635
<i>My mind and body can exist</i>

784
01:05:59,702 --> 01:06:01,737
<i>in different places
at the same time.</i>

785
01:06:01,804 --> 01:06:03,273
<i>Did you find the boy?</i>

786
01:06:03,339 --> 01:06:04,942
Caught one of the bikes,
but he didn't have the child.

787
01:06:05,008 --> 01:06:07,877
<i>Bring me the prisoner.
I'll break his mind.</i>

788
01:06:07,945 --> 01:06:08,979
Uh...

789
01:06:10,413 --> 01:06:11,814
<i>You killed him, didn't you?</i>

790
01:06:19,223 --> 01:06:20,623
He didn't make it.

791
01:06:23,327 --> 01:06:24,493
The bullet's extracted.

792
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,296
The tissue damage
has been repaired.

793
01:06:26,362 --> 01:06:30,901
Blood pressure, 120 over 81.
Heart rate's at 74 bpm.

794
01:06:30,968 --> 01:06:32,702
He'll be back on his feet
in no time.

795
01:06:34,938 --> 01:06:36,839
That is insane.

796
01:06:36,907 --> 01:06:39,009
The nanobots did
most of the work.

797
01:06:39,076 --> 01:06:41,444
No, no, no. I'm not gonna
let you downplay this.

798
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:43,446
I literally just witnessed
a miracle.

799
01:06:43,512 --> 01:06:44,814
Mm-mm.

800
01:06:44,882 --> 01:06:46,616
What? I say something stupid?

801
01:06:46,682 --> 01:06:49,652
No, it's just you can transform
your molecular structure,

802
01:06:49,719 --> 01:06:51,288
grow a hundred times
your own size.

803
01:06:51,355 --> 01:06:53,656
You're an impossibility
and the world still amazes you.

804
01:06:53,723 --> 01:06:55,524
I don't know, it's...

805
01:06:56,293 --> 01:06:57,560
It's cool.

806
01:06:58,561 --> 01:07:00,429
Thank you.

807
01:07:00,496 --> 01:07:02,065
But it's not as cool
as nanobots.

808
01:07:04,301 --> 01:07:06,236
That's how you do
your wind thing.

809
01:07:06,303 --> 01:07:08,906
Well, the "wind thing"
is called aerokinesis.

810
01:07:08,972 --> 01:07:10,941
And the nanobots were injected
into my bloodstream

811
01:07:11,008 --> 01:07:12,508
by this really
messed-up scientist

812
01:07:12,575 --> 01:07:14,177
who kidnapped me when I was 15.

813
01:07:18,382 --> 01:07:19,917
I'm... so sorry.

814
01:07:21,018 --> 01:07:22,352
No, you're good.

815
01:07:22,418 --> 01:07:24,388
It seems like you
really turned it around.

816
01:07:24,453 --> 01:07:25,788
Found your calling.

817
01:07:27,024 --> 01:07:28,158
Hoping this is mine.

818
01:07:34,264 --> 01:07:36,699
There's no point
in dwelling in the past.

819
01:07:39,102 --> 01:07:41,038
It's already moved on from you.

820
01:07:45,242 --> 01:07:46,609
Why did you say that?

821
01:07:46,676 --> 01:07:49,079
You were blaming yourself
for trusting Ishmael.

822
01:07:49,146 --> 01:07:52,448
Your thoughts are better spent
on the things you can change,

823
01:07:52,515 --> 01:07:53,884
not those you can't.

824
01:07:54,918 --> 01:07:56,752
You see the future?

825
01:07:56,819 --> 01:07:58,922
Tell me how I get my son back.

826
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:01,457
By trusting us.

827
01:08:01,524 --> 01:08:04,094
Karim will live.
We will save Amon.

828
01:08:04,928 --> 01:08:05,996
It's what we do.

829
01:08:11,034 --> 01:08:13,836
I suppose they didn't
have doors in your day.

830
01:08:13,904 --> 01:08:16,739
Well, of course we did.
That's how we entered rooms.

831
01:08:16,806 --> 01:08:19,276
What I did there
is called sarcasm.

832
01:08:19,343 --> 01:08:21,345
Where is Amon?
Did you find him?

833
01:08:21,411 --> 01:08:22,578
Not yet, but I will.

834
01:08:22,645 --> 01:08:23,679
The men who took him
will suffer.

835
01:08:25,614 --> 01:08:27,017
Maybe these guys can help.

836
01:08:28,851 --> 01:08:31,355
There's an upside
to keeping prisoners.

837
01:08:31,421 --> 01:08:33,290
They can answer our questions.

838
01:08:33,357 --> 01:08:34,724
What did you do with my son?

839
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,868
Adrianna. Adrianna.

840
01:08:45,936 --> 01:08:47,636
I've learned that
in this modern world,

841
01:08:47,703 --> 01:08:49,039
we shouldn't hurt our prisoners.

842
01:08:49,106 --> 01:08:50,907
We should treat them
with dignity, respect.

843
01:08:52,275 --> 01:08:54,077
No.

844
01:08:54,144 --> 01:08:56,579
Let's start with just
one simple question.

845
01:08:56,645 --> 01:08:59,149
Can either of you fly?

846
01:08:59,216 --> 01:09:00,616
Shit.

847
01:09:02,585 --> 01:09:03,987
I think I'll sit this one out.

848
01:09:11,028 --> 01:09:12,595
Tell me what you did with Amon.

849
01:09:14,164 --> 01:09:16,233
You'd better not drop
those prisoners.

850
01:09:16,299 --> 01:09:17,934
I'm not going to drop them.

851
01:09:19,668 --> 01:09:21,104
I'm going to drop one of them.

852
01:09:21,171 --> 01:09:23,672
Whoever answers first lives.
Where is he?

853
01:09:23,739 --> 01:09:24,707
I don't know.

854
01:09:31,714 --> 01:09:33,450
He's at our mine in the desert.

855
01:09:33,517 --> 01:09:35,052
I can show...

856
01:09:40,589 --> 01:09:42,225
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

857
01:09:44,361 --> 01:09:46,396
You said you wouldn't
hurt the prisoners.

858
01:09:46,463 --> 01:09:48,098
That was sarcasm.

859
01:09:48,165 --> 01:09:50,233
No, technically,
it was just a lie.

860
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:51,801
Intergang have a mine
in the desert.

861
01:09:51,867 --> 01:09:53,103
- Amon is there.
- I know it.

862
01:09:53,170 --> 01:09:55,405
It's near
the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

863
01:09:55,472 --> 01:09:56,473
Let's go.

864
01:09:58,008 --> 01:10:00,410
I told you, stop killing people!

865
01:10:00,477 --> 01:10:01,644
They look alive to me.

866
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:03,180
Because I saved them.

867
01:10:03,246 --> 01:10:04,915
Well, that's why I waited
until you were there.

868
01:10:04,981 --> 01:10:07,250
I got the information I needed,
no one died.

869
01:10:08,251 --> 01:10:09,252
I did it your way.

870
01:10:09,319 --> 01:10:10,786
He does have a point.

871
01:10:11,988 --> 01:10:13,890
I know it got lost
in all the confusion,

872
01:10:13,957 --> 01:10:16,226
but we still have some issues
to settle here.

873
01:10:16,293 --> 01:10:18,428
We know where Amon is.
We have to go.

874
01:10:18,495 --> 01:10:19,996
There is no "we" here.

875
01:10:20,063 --> 01:10:23,300
There are only heroes
and there are villains.

876
01:10:24,401 --> 01:10:25,902
You think yourself a hero,

877
01:10:25,969 --> 01:10:27,736
but you would let these
criminals go free,

878
01:10:27,803 --> 01:10:29,705
knowing that many more
will suffer at their hands

879
01:10:29,772 --> 01:10:31,274
unless we end them now.

880
01:10:31,341 --> 01:10:33,376
Heroes don't kill people.

881
01:10:37,481 --> 01:10:38,681
Well, I do.

882
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:41,384
Here we go.

883
01:11:42,279 --> 01:11:44,047
Is that what I think it is?

884
01:11:45,549 --> 01:11:47,284
Twenty-three pounds
of pure Eternium,

885
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:50,153
much denser than typical
artifacts of the period.

886
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:51,787
King must have had
a really strong neck.

887
01:11:51,854 --> 01:11:53,924
No, it snapped
when I killed him.

888
01:11:55,824 --> 01:11:57,160
What's that?

889
01:11:57,227 --> 01:11:58,962
There's writing on the inside
of the rim.

890
01:11:59,029 --> 01:12:01,231
"Life is the only path
to death."

891
01:12:02,065 --> 01:12:03,233
That's what it says.

892
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:06,369
Life is the only path to death.

893
01:12:06,436 --> 01:12:09,772
Well, that's
surprisingly obvious.

894
01:12:09,838 --> 01:12:11,541
Could it have another meaning?

895
01:12:11,608 --> 01:12:13,610
What if it means, like, um...

896
01:12:13,677 --> 01:12:15,778
"Life is short.

897
01:12:15,844 --> 01:12:17,347
You gotta hold on
to what you love."

898
01:12:19,449 --> 01:12:20,716
Stop.

899
01:12:20,783 --> 01:12:21,885
Deep.

900
01:12:21,952 --> 01:12:23,420
It doesn't matter what it means.

901
01:12:23,486 --> 01:12:25,455
It should be buried
under the ocean for eternity.

902
01:12:25,522 --> 01:12:28,692
That's not far from what we had
in mind for you when this is over.

903
01:12:28,757 --> 01:12:30,193
Or I could bury you with it.

904
01:12:31,995 --> 01:12:33,496
We can't get rid of it now.

905
01:12:33,563 --> 01:12:35,864
It's the one thing
that Intergang wants.

906
01:12:35,932 --> 01:12:38,001
Believe me,
I know more than anyone

907
01:12:38,068 --> 01:12:39,469
what this crown is capable of.

908
01:12:39,536 --> 01:12:42,871
But we have to keep it
until my son is safe.

909
01:12:42,939 --> 01:12:44,107
Adrianna...

910
01:12:44,174 --> 01:12:46,142
Trust me,
we will get your son back.

911
01:12:46,209 --> 01:12:48,777
They don't care about him.
They just want to defeat me.

912
01:12:48,844 --> 01:12:50,113
Hand it over.

913
01:12:51,715 --> 01:12:55,352
We can't risk letting the crown
fall into the wrong hands.

914
01:12:56,785 --> 01:12:58,787
We'll find another way.

915
01:12:59,822 --> 01:13:01,458
No.

916
01:13:01,524 --> 01:13:04,227
You like to split the world
into good and bad,

917
01:13:04,294 --> 01:13:07,697
but that's easy to do when
you're the one drawing the line.

918
01:13:07,763 --> 01:13:09,599
All I care about is Amon.

919
01:13:09,666 --> 01:13:13,970
And until he is safe,
we're all on the same side.

920
01:13:14,037 --> 01:13:17,474
And you...
you will work together.

921
01:13:24,447 --> 01:13:27,384
Set a course
for the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

922
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:29,019
We'll go in at dawn.

923
01:13:30,253 --> 01:13:32,522
I hope you can be a team player.

924
01:13:32,589 --> 01:13:34,457
I love teams.

925
01:13:34,524 --> 01:13:35,858
That was sarcasm again, yes?

926
01:13:35,925 --> 01:13:37,460
Very much so.

927
01:13:37,527 --> 01:13:39,462
Good. Just checking.

928
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:52,175
A wise man
once told me a bad plan

929
01:13:52,242 --> 01:13:53,777
is better than no plan at all.

930
01:13:53,842 --> 01:13:56,880
That was before we had
a very bad plan.

931
01:13:57,447 --> 01:13:59,149
Let it go.

932
01:13:59,215 --> 01:14:01,785
I'd rather be fighting with him
than against him.

933
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:03,453
He's a murderer, Kent.

934
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:07,057
If he turns on us,
that kid is as good as dead.

935
01:14:07,123 --> 01:14:10,060
You don't get to decide
who lives or dies.

936
01:14:11,494 --> 01:14:13,363
That's... up to Fate.

937
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:15,231
What's the helmet telling you?

938
01:14:16,099 --> 01:14:18,535
Somebody's gonna die.

939
01:14:18,601 --> 01:14:21,538
Who is it? Atom Smasher?
It's Atom Smasher.

940
01:14:21,604 --> 01:14:23,006
Surprisingly, no.

941
01:14:23,973 --> 01:14:25,175
Is it me?

942
01:14:31,214 --> 01:14:34,951
When it's time for you and I
to say goodbye, you'll know.

943
01:14:37,587 --> 01:14:39,155
All I can tell you is...

944
01:14:41,157 --> 01:14:43,593
there's still time
to change the future.

945
01:14:44,761 --> 01:14:46,196
Let's use it.

946
01:14:46,763 --> 01:14:47,997
Hmm.

947
01:14:51,368 --> 01:14:54,270
Well, I guess we're sticking
with the very bad plan.

948
01:15:06,549 --> 01:15:08,017
<i>The Al Hadidiyah Mine</i>

949
01:15:08,084 --> 01:15:10,420
<i>is Intergang's
most valued asset.</i>

950
01:15:11,788 --> 01:15:13,056
I'm gonna land us right here,

951
01:15:13,123 --> 01:15:15,291
cut off their access
to reinforcements.

952
01:15:15,358 --> 01:15:18,361
But the perimeter of the mine
creates a natural fortress.

953
01:15:18,428 --> 01:15:20,530
There's only one way in,
one way out.

954
01:15:20,597 --> 01:15:22,932
We'll be an easy target
for their flybike patrol.

955
01:15:22,999 --> 01:15:24,367
Communication is key.

956
01:15:24,434 --> 01:15:27,003
We keep in step,
or we get outflanked.

957
01:15:27,070 --> 01:15:29,072
We move through the mine,
inch by inch,

958
01:15:29,139 --> 01:15:30,540
until we find Amon.

959
01:15:30,607 --> 01:15:32,842
This is where you come in.
Are you ready... Damn it.

960
01:15:50,593 --> 01:15:51,961
Or we could just do that.

961
01:16:05,542 --> 01:16:07,844
Pure Eternium shield.

962
01:16:07,912 --> 01:16:10,313
Unbreakable,
even with your powers.

963
01:16:17,854 --> 01:16:19,122
Amon!

964
01:16:19,189 --> 01:16:20,925
You hurt him,
I will kill all of you.

965
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:24,093
Nobody has to die.
We just want the crown.

966
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:25,695
We don't have it.

967
01:16:25,762 --> 01:16:29,699
Believe me, nothing good
will come from that crown.

968
01:16:31,701 --> 01:16:34,537
No crown, no negotiation.

969
01:16:35,972 --> 01:16:37,207
I have it.

970
01:16:38,943 --> 01:16:40,977
It's right here.

971
01:16:41,044 --> 01:16:44,047
Release my son, you can have it.

972
01:16:46,616 --> 01:16:48,418
What do you think you're doing?

973
01:16:49,887 --> 01:16:52,255
Intergang killed my husband.

974
01:16:52,322 --> 01:16:54,324
I'm not letting them
take my son, too.

975
01:16:59,897 --> 01:17:02,499
Not your son.
Not your country.

976
01:17:03,968 --> 01:17:05,468
Not your decision to make.

977
01:17:06,769 --> 01:17:08,137
Stop there!

978
01:17:08,204 --> 01:17:11,074
It's okay. Nothing is
gonna happen to you.

979
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:12,475
Hand it over, now.

980
01:17:13,643 --> 01:17:14,711
I'm sorry, Mom.

981
01:17:14,777 --> 01:17:15,712
No.

982
01:17:21,751 --> 01:17:23,119
Now, let Amon go.

983
01:17:29,192 --> 01:17:30,895
I thank you.
And I thank your friends

984
01:17:30,961 --> 01:17:34,932
for returning the crown
to its rightful owner.

985
01:17:34,999 --> 01:17:39,102
What kind of Champion of
Kahndaq sides with foreign invaders?

986
01:17:39,168 --> 01:17:40,470
You have what you want.

987
01:17:41,604 --> 01:17:42,438
Let him go.

988
01:17:42,505 --> 01:17:44,173
Ishmael, what are you doing?

989
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:46,676
Taking back what's mine.

990
01:17:46,743 --> 01:17:49,579
I'm the last living descendant
of King Ahk-Ton the Great.

991
01:17:49,646 --> 01:17:52,315
And you have just given me
everything I need

992
01:17:52,382 --> 01:17:56,152
to become the next...
king of Kahndaq.

993
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,622
My family passed the
knowledge on, you know,

994
01:17:59,689 --> 01:18:01,324
one to the next.

995
01:18:01,391 --> 01:18:04,627
The crown,
crafted by our ancestors,

996
01:18:04,694 --> 01:18:07,397
stolen by the wizards
and hidden away.

997
01:18:07,463 --> 01:18:09,332
But still a source
of great power,

998
01:18:09,399 --> 01:18:11,768
if only we can wield it.

999
01:18:16,907 --> 01:18:21,778
They say when Hurut died,
you wept like a baby.

1000
01:18:22,913 --> 01:18:24,714
I wonder if you'll
do the same for them.

1001
01:18:24,781 --> 01:18:25,983
Please, Ishmael.

1002
01:18:26,050 --> 01:18:27,283
Sorry, Amon.

1003
01:18:29,686 --> 01:18:31,055
Fate, get ready.

1004
01:18:39,128 --> 01:18:40,430
Amon!

1005
01:19:46,796 --> 01:19:47,965
Amon!

1006
01:19:51,035 --> 01:19:52,669
He's alive.

1007
01:19:52,735 --> 01:19:54,470
But we need to get him
to the medical bay.

1008
01:19:54,537 --> 01:19:56,372
- Where is he shot?
- It wasn't a bullet.

1009
01:19:56,439 --> 01:19:57,774
It was me.

1010
01:20:06,984 --> 01:20:07,850
Come.

1011
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,962
We're going with you.

1012
01:20:19,029 --> 01:20:21,698
Just find the crown.
Get it on the cruiser.

1013
01:20:34,243 --> 01:20:37,513
I found the crown.
But, um... it's not alone.

1014
01:20:48,758 --> 01:20:50,894
How long we gonna
keep doing this?

1015
01:20:54,131 --> 01:20:57,834
There's no point in fighting. We
both know no one can stop me.

1016
01:20:59,402 --> 01:21:00,636
You're right.

1017
01:21:01,838 --> 01:21:03,873
Only you can.

1018
01:21:03,941 --> 01:21:06,776
Ishmael said you cried
when Hurut died.

1019
01:21:11,781 --> 01:21:12,916
Who's Hurut?

1020
01:21:18,321 --> 01:21:20,456
Hurut was a true Champion
of Kahndaq.

1021
01:21:26,262 --> 01:21:28,031
<i>And he was also my son.</i>

1022
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:52,122
<i>I tried to protect him.</i>

1023
01:21:59,595 --> 01:22:01,364
<i>But I wasn't strong enough.</i>

1024
01:22:06,203 --> 01:22:09,006
Shazam!

1025
01:22:09,072 --> 01:22:12,875
<i>The wizards decided that
he would be their champion.</i>

1026
01:22:12,943 --> 01:22:15,179
<i>But after the Champion's
many victories,</i>

1027
01:22:15,245 --> 01:22:17,981
<i>the king went after
what Hurut loved the most.</i>

1028
01:22:20,483 --> 01:22:22,552
Our family.

1029
01:23:01,591 --> 01:23:02,993
- Shazam.
- Shazam.

1030
01:23:15,538 --> 01:23:18,841
<i>Instead of battling the king...</i>

1031
01:23:18,909 --> 01:23:21,044
<i>Instead of saving Kahndaq...</i>

1032
01:23:22,378 --> 01:23:26,515
<i>Hurut chose to save... me.</i>

1033
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,568
<i>But he couldn't save himself</i>

1034
01:23:45,635 --> 01:23:48,005
<i>from the king's assassins.</i>

1035
01:23:50,374 --> 01:23:53,243
<i>The powers were not a gift
from the wizards...</i>

1036
01:23:54,644 --> 01:23:55,411
<i>...but a curse.</i>

1037
01:24:05,454 --> 01:24:08,025
<i>Born... out of rage.</i>

1038
01:24:10,894 --> 01:24:13,063
The statue of the Champion
isn't you.

1039
01:24:16,233 --> 01:24:17,600
It's Hurut.

1040
01:24:20,503 --> 01:24:22,605
My son dreamt of a better world.

1041
01:24:23,773 --> 01:24:25,441
That's why he saved me.

1042
01:24:30,013 --> 01:24:32,515
But the world was only
a better place with him in it.

1043
01:24:48,564 --> 01:24:50,100
Kahndaq needed a hero.

1044
01:24:51,634 --> 01:24:53,536
Instead, it got me.

1045
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:58,976
All this power...

1046
01:24:59,042 --> 01:25:01,510
And the only thing I can
do with it is hurt people.

1047
01:25:02,712 --> 01:25:05,315
I will speak the word
my son gave me,

1048
01:25:05,382 --> 01:25:06,950
and I will give up my power.

1049
01:25:09,353 --> 01:25:13,522
And when I do, you must
ensure I never speak it again.

1050
01:25:19,262 --> 01:25:20,197
Shazam.

1051
01:26:17,187 --> 01:26:18,288
Hey!

1052
01:26:36,705 --> 01:26:38,707
So beautiful.

1053
01:27:04,968 --> 01:27:06,503
Surprised to see us?

1054
01:27:06,570 --> 01:27:09,638
Surprise is a dirty word
in this business.

1055
01:27:09,705 --> 01:27:11,274
Are you sure you can handle him?

1056
01:27:12,641 --> 01:27:14,010
You're the one who can
see the future,

1057
01:27:14,077 --> 01:27:15,479
you'll tell me if we can't.

1058
01:27:15,545 --> 01:27:17,881
Just be careful with this one.

1059
01:27:17,948 --> 01:27:20,383
You know,
they say the gods created us,

1060
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:23,120
but we're the ones who
always wind up burying them.

1061
01:27:24,854 --> 01:27:26,622
Waller sends her regards.

1062
01:27:33,296 --> 01:27:35,031
<i>They'll know
how to deal with him.</i>

1063
01:27:35,098 --> 01:27:38,001
<i>To keep him
from regaining his powers,</i>

1064
01:27:38,068 --> 01:27:40,270
<i>they'll keep him
in suspended animation.</i>

1065
01:27:47,511 --> 01:27:51,148
<i>As long as he's submerged,
he won't be able to speak.</i>

1066
01:27:55,919 --> 01:27:57,853
<i>He'll never say
another word again.</i>

1067
01:28:17,274 --> 01:28:19,409
Hey! There he is.

1068
01:28:19,476 --> 01:28:23,246
Not all heroes wear capes,
but I think you earned this.

1069
01:28:23,313 --> 01:28:24,981
Well, statistically,

1070
01:28:25,048 --> 01:28:27,284
most heroes don't wear capes.
But yeah, try it on.

1071
01:28:30,853 --> 01:28:32,788
Yeah, looks pretty good.

1072
01:28:35,659 --> 01:28:37,360
That's a nice touch.

1073
01:29:17,701 --> 01:29:18,867
Kent.

1074
01:29:20,437 --> 01:29:21,905
Kent!

1075
01:29:24,807 --> 01:29:26,076
Mission accomplished?

1076
01:29:26,142 --> 01:29:28,211
My vision hasn't changed.

1077
01:29:28,278 --> 01:29:30,413
But Teth Adam's
out of the equation.

1078
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:33,316
Kent, if this isn't over, I
need to know what's coming.

1079
01:29:33,383 --> 01:29:35,218
What is the helmet telling you?

1080
01:29:36,486 --> 01:29:39,923
My vision has always
shown me a great calamity.

1081
01:29:39,990 --> 01:29:42,225
The world in flames.

1082
01:29:42,292 --> 01:29:43,460
We can stop it...

1083
01:29:45,395 --> 01:29:46,795
but you die.

1084
01:29:48,797 --> 01:29:50,233
You should've told me sooner.

1085
01:29:53,503 --> 01:29:55,205
I have no fear of death.

1086
01:29:55,272 --> 01:29:57,407
That's precisely
why I didn't tell you.

1087
01:29:57,474 --> 01:29:59,775
The world needs
the Justice Society.

1088
01:29:59,842 --> 01:30:01,544
The world needs you.

1089
01:30:01,611 --> 01:30:04,080
But you can't choose
who lives and dies.

1090
01:30:04,780 --> 01:30:06,016
That's Fate, right?

1091
01:30:09,085 --> 01:30:10,887
That sounds familiar.

1092
01:30:13,356 --> 01:30:15,492
I remember seeing
my first airplane.

1093
01:30:17,193 --> 01:30:22,065
It was an RAF deployment,
headed to the Western Front.

1094
01:30:22,132 --> 01:30:24,534
Everyone on my street
came out to see them off.

1095
01:30:25,201 --> 01:30:26,770
Mm.

1096
01:30:26,835 --> 01:30:28,238
But I didn't cheer.

1097
01:30:29,939 --> 01:30:32,442
Even though I was only a boy.

1098
01:30:32,509 --> 01:30:37,147
I knew where they were headed,
and what awaited them.

1099
01:30:37,213 --> 01:30:38,814
Thanks to this,
I've lived longer

1100
01:30:38,882 --> 01:30:40,984
than I could've
ever have hoped for.

1101
01:30:41,051 --> 01:30:42,752
I've seen the world change

1102
01:30:42,818 --> 01:30:44,921
in more ways
than I could've imagined.

1103
01:30:48,058 --> 01:30:49,926
I'm still a sentimental fool.

1104
01:30:51,328 --> 01:30:53,263
And I don't want
my friend to die.

1105
01:31:01,304 --> 01:31:06,109
Ishmael said, "Death
is the only path to life."

1106
01:31:06,176 --> 01:31:08,445
But that's not
what the inscription says.

1107
01:31:08,511 --> 01:31:11,147
Right. "Life is the only
path to death."

1108
01:31:12,015 --> 01:31:13,350
Maybe he got it backwards,

1109
01:31:13,416 --> 01:31:15,819
like he read it in a mirror
or something.

1110
01:31:15,885 --> 01:31:17,287
That's it.

1111
01:31:17,354 --> 01:31:19,756
In Kahndaqi mythology,
the souls of the damned

1112
01:31:19,823 --> 01:31:21,857
are sent
to the Rock of Finality.

1113
01:31:21,925 --> 01:31:23,960
The underworld
is a mirror to our own.

1114
01:31:24,027 --> 01:31:26,062
Here, turn the crown around.

1115
01:31:27,163 --> 01:31:28,898
Now mirror the letters.

1116
01:31:28,965 --> 01:31:32,001
See? That's what I missed.

1117
01:31:32,068 --> 01:31:35,871
"Death is the only
path to life."

1118
01:31:39,743 --> 01:31:42,278
<i>He kidnapped Amon on purpose,</i>

1119
01:31:42,345 --> 01:31:44,881
<i>because he knew
that Teth Adam would kill him.</i>

1120
01:31:44,948 --> 01:31:46,950
<i>And he believed
the Champion's magic</i>

1121
01:31:47,016 --> 01:31:48,885
<i>would send him
to the Rock of Finality.</i>

1122
01:31:48,952 --> 01:31:52,589
As life is the path to death.

1123
01:31:52,655 --> 01:31:56,326
Now your death
is a path to life.

1124
01:31:56,393 --> 01:31:58,595
The wizards have their champion,

1125
01:31:58,661 --> 01:32:00,597
now we have ours.

1126
01:32:00,663 --> 01:32:03,666
You will take
the throne of Kahndaq

1127
01:32:03,733 --> 01:32:07,737
and unleash hell on Earth!

1128
01:32:07,804 --> 01:32:09,906
Speak our name.

1129
01:32:10,573 --> 01:32:11,908
"Sabbac."

1130
01:32:33,029 --> 01:32:34,697
What the bloody hell is that?

1131
01:32:34,764 --> 01:32:36,866
Readout says
it's the demon, Sabbac.

1132
01:32:36,933 --> 01:32:38,701
Get me closer.
Now, right now!

1133
01:32:38,768 --> 01:32:40,637
We're 100 miles out,
give me 20 seconds!

1134
01:32:56,453 --> 01:32:57,720
Brace yourselves!

1135
01:33:03,626 --> 01:33:04,961
Hold on!

1136
01:33:41,498 --> 01:33:43,600
Now prepare to die.

1137
01:33:49,105 --> 01:33:50,573
Wait, wait, where's Uncle Karim?

1138
01:34:07,156 --> 01:34:10,527
No matter what happens,
he does not sit on that throne.

1139
01:34:13,596 --> 01:34:15,498
- Copy that.
- We're on it!

1140
01:34:15,565 --> 01:34:16,599
Heads up!

1141
01:35:01,277 --> 01:35:02,378
Activate infrared.

1142
01:35:06,249 --> 01:35:08,184
Sabbac, show yourself!

1143
01:35:10,386 --> 01:35:13,523
Adrianna! Amon!

1144
01:35:17,493 --> 01:35:19,128
That's for my cruiser.

1145
01:35:57,533 --> 01:35:58,902
This is it.

1146
01:36:00,136 --> 01:36:01,671
We can't win, Carter.

1147
01:36:01,738 --> 01:36:05,141
Yeah, but the world burns
if we don't. Right?

1148
01:36:07,343 --> 01:36:09,646
Bad plan is better than
no plan at all.

1149
01:36:36,406 --> 01:36:38,441
No, no, no.
What are you doing?

1150
01:36:38,508 --> 01:36:40,243
Giving us a third option.

1151
01:36:40,309 --> 01:36:41,644
It's supposed to be me.

1152
01:36:41,711 --> 01:36:44,247
I didn't tell you
my whole vision, old friend.

1153
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:46,416
I did see your death.

1154
01:36:46,482 --> 01:36:48,818
But I also found a way
to prevent it.

1155
01:36:48,886 --> 01:36:51,088
It has been
an extraordinary life,

1156
01:36:51,155 --> 01:36:53,589
but always with one foot
in the future.

1157
01:36:53,656 --> 01:36:56,927
Carter, for the first time
in 100 years,

1158
01:36:56,994 --> 01:36:58,361
when I look ahead...

1159
01:37:00,797 --> 01:37:02,066
I see nothing.

1160
01:37:02,132 --> 01:37:03,033
No, Kent.

1161
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:04,233
And...

1162
01:37:05,102 --> 01:37:06,335
it's...

1163
01:37:07,071 --> 01:37:08,105
beautiful.

1164
01:37:08,172 --> 01:37:09,205
Wait, Kent!

1165
01:37:09,272 --> 01:37:10,273
Goodbye...

1166
01:37:10,339 --> 01:37:12,042
Kent!

1167
01:37:12,109 --> 01:37:13,177
My dear friend.

1168
01:37:13,242 --> 01:37:14,677
Kent!

1169
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:18,548
Hit it from every side.

1170
01:37:20,249 --> 01:37:22,852
Kent!

1171
01:37:25,321 --> 01:37:26,622
No!

1172
01:37:46,076 --> 01:37:51,280
I am Dr. Fate, sorcerer,
agent of the Lords of Order,

1173
01:37:51,347 --> 01:37:54,417
defender against darkness
and chaos,

1174
01:37:54,484 --> 01:37:57,420
but even my powers
cannot defeat you.

1175
01:38:06,997 --> 01:38:09,365
There's no one
that can defeat me.

1176
01:38:13,870 --> 01:38:17,807
There is one... There is one...

1177
01:38:18,307 --> 01:38:19,609
Teth Adam.

1178
01:38:20,944 --> 01:38:22,545
I know you can hear me.

1179
01:38:24,148 --> 01:38:28,185
<i>The battle your son
was meant to fight is upon us.</i>

1180
01:38:28,252 --> 01:38:30,520
<i>Now you are the only one</i>

1181
01:38:30,586 --> 01:38:32,956
<i>who can defeat
the Demon Champion.</i>

1182
01:38:58,815 --> 01:39:00,349
<i>You have the power</i>

1183
01:39:00,416 --> 01:39:02,752
<i>to be the destroyer
of this world.</i>

1184
01:39:05,655 --> 01:39:08,691
But you can also be its savior.

1185
01:39:25,275 --> 01:39:28,145
<i>You believe you are
not a worthy champion,</i>

1186
01:39:28,212 --> 01:39:30,880
<i>because the wizards
did not choose you.</i>

1187
01:39:30,948 --> 01:39:34,918
<i>But Fate does not make
mistakes. Neither did your son.</i>

1188
01:39:38,855 --> 01:39:40,556
<i>We were wrong about you.</i>

1189
01:39:40,623 --> 01:39:43,793
<i>The world doesn't always need
a white knight.</i>

1190
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:46,096
Sometimes it needs
something darker.

1191
01:40:02,012 --> 01:40:05,148
<i>Don't you dare
give up on us now.</i>

1192
01:40:05,215 --> 01:40:06,849
The world needs you.

1193
01:41:13,582 --> 01:41:15,185
Kent!

1194
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:25,228
No!

1195
01:42:29,825 --> 01:42:32,195
Mom? What's happening?

1196
01:42:34,563 --> 01:42:36,166
It's Sabbac.

1197
01:42:36,233 --> 01:42:38,502
He commands the Legions of Hell.

1198
01:42:38,567 --> 01:42:39,936
Whatever happens...

1199
01:42:41,438 --> 01:42:42,906
you stay behind me.

1200
01:42:53,649 --> 01:42:55,218
<i>♪ Baby, come back ♪</i>

1201
01:42:57,187 --> 01:42:59,622
Don't worry,
I die by electricity!

1202
01:43:01,525 --> 01:43:04,161
You want some Kahndaq?
Come and get it!

1203
01:43:04,227 --> 01:43:06,096
Come and get it!

1204
01:43:06,163 --> 01:43:07,330
No, no. No.

1205
01:43:07,397 --> 01:43:09,732
- Don't send me home, I can help.
- I know.

1206
01:43:09,799 --> 01:43:12,002
But you can do better
than swinging a stick.

1207
01:44:01,952 --> 01:44:03,619
Hey!

1208
01:44:03,686 --> 01:44:05,222
What are you all
standing around for?

1209
01:44:06,389 --> 01:44:07,823
This is our chance.

1210
01:44:10,927 --> 01:44:14,131
With these hands,
we built Kahndaq.

1211
01:44:14,197 --> 01:44:16,199
And with these hands,
we will set it free!

1212
01:44:34,351 --> 01:44:35,886
What are we waiting for?

1213
01:45:02,179 --> 01:45:03,346
Shazam.

1214
01:45:13,924 --> 01:45:16,759
The people of Kahndaq
rise up against you!

1215
01:45:45,589 --> 01:45:46,923
Yes!

1216
01:45:49,593 --> 01:45:52,062
I got this.

1217
01:45:53,663 --> 01:45:54,863
Go get him.

1218
01:46:12,515 --> 01:46:14,150
You know what I have to do.

1219
01:46:15,784 --> 01:46:17,187
Beat his ass!

1220
01:46:17,254 --> 01:46:19,689
Let the fate of Kahndaq
be decided

1221
01:46:19,755 --> 01:46:22,459
by a true battle of champions.

1222
01:46:23,426 --> 01:46:24,494
Let's end this.

1223
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:52,322
It's a lot of them.

1224
01:46:53,923 --> 01:46:55,992
- It's a bit more than I thought.
- Yeah.

1225
01:46:56,559 --> 01:46:57,927
Just a bit.

1226
01:47:05,468 --> 01:47:06,536
Hey, Mom!

1227
01:47:14,077 --> 01:47:17,080
These are our streets!
Our city!

1228
01:47:18,882 --> 01:47:21,251
Free Kahndaq!

1229
01:47:28,925 --> 01:47:31,594
The wizards' powers
were wasted on you.

1230
01:47:31,661 --> 01:47:33,463
You are not a hero.

1231
01:47:35,932 --> 01:47:38,568
No. I'm not.

1232
01:47:39,903 --> 01:47:42,339
But he is.

1233
01:47:53,750 --> 01:47:55,819
You cannot stand against me.

1234
01:47:55,885 --> 01:47:58,421
I am Kahndaq's true champion.

1235
01:48:08,131 --> 01:48:10,433
I learned this trick
from an old friend.

1236
01:48:49,973 --> 01:48:51,374
You can control it!

1237
01:48:55,612 --> 01:48:56,679
You have to!

1238
01:49:07,924 --> 01:49:10,093
Tell them
the Man in Black sent you.

1239
01:49:35,318 --> 01:49:37,220
- Yes!
- Yes!

1240
01:49:59,944 --> 01:50:02,579
I never thought I'd
be happy to see you.

1241
01:50:05,950 --> 01:50:07,550
I'm only here because of him.

1242
01:50:10,921 --> 01:50:12,589
That makes two of us.

1243
01:50:29,839 --> 01:50:31,674
See you around, old friend.

1244
01:50:46,789 --> 01:50:48,358
Think you can keep him
out of trouble?

1245
01:50:48,424 --> 01:50:50,360
As long as no one
comes looking for it.

1246
01:50:50,426 --> 01:50:52,028
Fair enough.

1247
01:50:53,663 --> 01:50:55,131
Just be careful.

1248
01:50:55,198 --> 01:50:58,368
The kind of justice you dish
out can darken your soul.

1249
01:50:58,434 --> 01:51:01,037
It's his darkness
that lets him do

1250
01:51:01,104 --> 01:51:03,740
what heroes like you cannot.

1251
01:51:05,441 --> 01:51:07,477
I guess we'll find out,
won't we?

1252
01:51:15,652 --> 01:51:17,554
I thought we made
a pretty good team back there.

1253
01:51:18,121 --> 01:51:19,422
Just saying.

1254
01:51:20,991 --> 01:51:22,392
We made a great team.

1255
01:51:28,331 --> 01:51:30,366
- Maybe we could...
- Don't push it.

1256
01:51:30,433 --> 01:51:32,135
Smasher, let's go.

1257
01:51:43,047 --> 01:51:45,983
Long live the Champion!

1258
01:51:46,050 --> 01:51:51,421
Long live the Champion!
Long live the Champion!

1259
01:51:53,958 --> 01:51:55,059
You could lead them.

1260
01:52:29,059 --> 01:52:30,360
How does it feel?

1261
01:52:32,161 --> 01:52:33,563
Wrong.

1262
01:52:44,807 --> 01:52:46,709
So... what now?

1263
01:52:46,776 --> 01:52:49,212
Does this mean you're finally
gonna be our hero?

1264
01:52:49,278 --> 01:52:51,280
Kahndaq has always had heroes.

1265
01:52:52,382 --> 01:52:54,617
And it still does.

1266
01:52:54,684 --> 01:52:57,387
What it needs now
is a protector.

1267
01:52:57,453 --> 01:52:59,188
Thank you, Teth Adam.

1268
01:52:59,255 --> 01:53:02,225
Perhaps that name is a little...

1269
01:53:02,291 --> 01:53:03,559
old-fashioned.

1270
01:53:04,594 --> 01:53:06,429
So what should we call you?

1271
01:56:01,637 --> 01:56:03,706
<i>Okay, "Black Adam."</i>

1272
01:56:04,607 --> 01:56:06,676
<i>My name is Amanda Waller.</i>

1273
01:56:06,742 --> 01:56:09,478
<i>Congratulations,
you have my attention.</i>

1274
01:56:09,545 --> 01:56:13,317
<i>This is gonna be
your only warning.</i>

1275
01:56:13,382 --> 01:56:16,419
<i>You don't want to stay
in my prison, that's fine.</i>

1276
01:56:16,485 --> 01:56:18,989
<i>Kahndaq is your prison now.</i>

1277
01:56:19,056 --> 01:56:22,960
<i>You step one foot outside of
it, you will not live to regret it.</i>

1278
01:56:25,028 --> 01:56:27,064
There's no one on this planet
that can stop me.

1279
01:56:27,130 --> 01:56:28,966
<i>I can call in a favor
and send people</i>

1280
01:56:29,032 --> 01:56:30,934
<i>who aren't from this planet.</i>

1281
01:56:33,170 --> 01:56:34,503
Send them all.

1282
01:56:36,206 --> 01:56:37,506
<i>As you wish.</i>

1283
01:56:52,189 --> 01:56:55,893
It's been a while since anyone's
made the world this nervous.

1284
01:57:01,932 --> 01:57:03,066
Black Adam.

1285
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:05,668
We should talk.
