On the way back.

00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,360
He said you stopped
at a crossroads to throw up.

6
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,840
You're not even a soldier any more, Tommy.

7
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,800
You didn't check your weapon.

8
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,840
You're not a soldier, you're a coward.

9
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,520
I heard you pull the trigger.

10
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,960
Leaving your family behind
without a goodbye.

11
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,920
If you still need a way out,

They let you pass through.

18
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,320
They wouldn't let me pass.

19
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,560
As if there were to be
another consequence.

Hello.

24
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,960
[Laura] <i>Mr Shelby,
I imagine you are curious</i>

25
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,080
<i>as to who it was who prevented
the assassination last night.</i>

26
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,320
If you look out your window,
you'll see a flag of truce.

27
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,720
<i>It's a unit of volunteers</i>

28
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,320
<i>bringing the bodies of your dead to you
to send to heaven in your own way.</i>

29
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,960
<i>Last night's operation
was carried out by soldiers</i>

30
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,960
from three Dublin brigades
of the Irish Republican Army.

31
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,800
<i>We need to keep Mr Mosley alive.</i>

32
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,240
That's all you need to know.

33
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,680
<i>Also, you should know
that saving Mosley's life</i>

34
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,040
<i>wasn't our only intervention last night.</i>

35
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,880
We've made some changes
to the structure of your organisation.

38
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,720
Ever since you began to build your empire,

39
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,120
you've had a crutch to lean on.

40
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,000
Last night we kicked away that crutch.

41
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,080
<i>From now on,
it will be us that you lean on.</i>

42
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,040
Please be aware, Mr Shelby,
that the deaths of your people

43
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,480
<i>are your own responsibility,</i>

44
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,160
because you consistently fail
to understand your own limitations.

It was the ambitions and strategies
of one man that caused this.

[in French] The island of Miquelon.

[Tommy in French] The commissioner said
to give us two hours. Someone may die.

My name is Thomas Shelby.
I have the meeting room booked.

00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,560
Uh...

67
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,560
Last night, some drunks broke my windows.

68
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,480
Pigeons got inside the big room.
My wife is clearing them out.

69
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,720
I'm early. I'll wait.

70
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,040
[in English] You want a drink?

71
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,720
I'll have a glass of water, please.

72
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,160
Windows got broke because
a lot of people here are drunk and angry.

73
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,360
You know...

74
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,920
Half the men on this island
made their living bootlegging until today.

75
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,880
The other half fixed their boats.

76
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,440
Maybe you should
take your water into the hall.

You work for the whiskey company, right?

80
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,480
I'm here on private business.

81
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,360
Where did you learn French?

82
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,720
[Tommy] In France.

83
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,720
[in English] Yeah,
I learned a lot of things in France.

-Now we have fucking nothing.
-[cork thuds]

And you sit in front of us

00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,120
Is that meant to be a joke?

93
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,840
No.

94
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,920
I ordered water
because I no longer drink alcohol

95
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,000
of any kind.

96
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,360
[in French] Jean-Claude, please.
Leave it alone.

97
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,360
[in English] You, my friend,

98
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,920
are going to drink a toast.

99
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,720
You will raise your glass
to the poor people of Miquelon

100
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,400
whose lives you bastards have destroyed.

101
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,400
Drink it.

102
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,880
Hey...

103
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,040
Drink.

104
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,320
You're not leaving this bar

105
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,200
until you have raised a toast
to the people of Miquelon.

106
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,800
Okay.

107

[inhales]

110
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,040
I understand that today,
of all days, you would be angry.

111
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,160
But if you had read my card
instead of burning it,

112
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,599
you would realise
that this is a misunderstanding.

113
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,839
Now, I've been very patient,
given the circumstances,

114
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,640
but you need to sit down

115
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,000
and let me read my newspaper.

116
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,000

[both grunting]

00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,160
[Tommy in English] Before this goes
any further, let me explain.

120
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,840
I will not drink your toast
because four years ago I forswore alcohol.

121
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,840
[in French] Fuck!

122
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,200
[in English] No. Don't.

[gunshot fires]

124
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,400
Since I forswore alcohol, I've become
a calmer and more peaceful person.

125
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,840
[in French] What happened?

126
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,400
[in English] Get in.

[sighs]

128
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,560
Sometimes, in moments
of personal conflict,

129
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,320
I can resort to my old ways.

130
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,120
If this were to happen now,
it would indeed

131
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,440
be a black day in Miquelon.

132
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,800
Now, my guests will be arriving shortly.

133
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,680
I need to prepare the room.

134
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,920
Can you show me where?

[spits]

138
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,160
[Connor in English] They think
we're distillery men

139
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,760
here to take our whiskey back.

140
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,320
We're late.

141
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,160
He's always early. Let's go.

[footsteps approaching]

00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,160
Hello, Tommy.

150
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,480
There's a man out there
having his face stitched back up.

151
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,320
That was a misunderstanding.
Hello, Michael.

152
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,440
I wasn't sure what I'd think
when I saw you again, Tom.

153
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,480
Oh, yeah? What do you think?

154
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,600
Since my mother
passed away four years ago,

155
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,160
Tommy and I haven't even spoken.

156
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,560
[Tommy] Well, we've both been very busy.

157
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,920
You've been too busy
to punish the people who killed her.

158
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,280
You know, Michael, when you're dealing
with a very powerful enemy,

159
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,200
taking revenge sometimes requires time.

160
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,320
You have to pick your moment.

161
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,920
That moment will come.

162
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,400
But now we have
a business interest in common.

163
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,600
And any bad blood will be diluted
by time and a practical self-interest.

164
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,360
Well, Tommy, we're all keen
to hear what you have to say.

165
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,960
I'm looking forward to working with
you again, Michael. You look very well.

166
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,720
You too.

167
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,960
How is the family?

168
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,800
[children chattering]

169
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,080
This projector is a gift
from Charlie-fucking-Chaplin.

170
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,960
And he sent it all the way from Hollywood.
Now sit down and watch the film!

171
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,640
Oh, God. No, Elizabeth, don't do that.
You're gonna hurt yourself.

172
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,120
Yes, hi. Is that the Bell Tavern?

173
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,360
If there's a Gypsy in there
called Johnny Dogs,

174
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,400
can you tell him to come
and round up his fucking kids?

175
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,680
It's Christmas. A time for family.

176
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,880
[receiver thuds]

177
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,440
Mum, I was watching that.

178
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,280
Okay, everyone. Okay.

179
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,680
[girl] When's he coming?

180
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,600
We're having this Christmas party early

181
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,560
because tomorrow, me and Charles and Ruby
are going on a big ship to Canada.

182
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,560
-[boy whispers] Canada.
-To be with their daddy.

183
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,920
But we told
Father Christmas about the party

184
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,520
and he brought you all presents.

185
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,720
[children] Yes!

186
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,680
[Ada laughs]

187
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
[boy] Race you!

188
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,800
Ada, where the fuck is Father Christmas?

189
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,800
I don't know.
He was supposed to be here by now.

190
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,360
-Yeah.
-Where the fuck are you, Santa?

191
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,240
[imitates gunshots]

192
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,240
[imitates gasping]

193
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,680
[exclaims]

194
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,640
You've got me.

195
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,280
But I've got a gun. You better run!

196
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,440
You'd better run!

197
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,840
[Tommy] Gentlemen, today is
the last day of Prohibition.

198
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,600
But rather than see it
as the end of something,

199
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,280
I believe that,
for men like us, it can present

200
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,880
a new beginning, a new opportunity.

201
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,880
An opportunity I would like to share
with people I know I can trust.

202
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,040
For the last twelve years,
the men of this island

203
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,600
have been making their living
from bootlegging whiskey,

204
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,480
from navigating the waters
and avoiding American border patrols.

205
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,680
But now that whiskey
is about to become legal,

206
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,000
the trade will fall back into the hands
of capitalists from New York,

207
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,840
Boston and Toronto.

208
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,760
But...

209
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,040
when one door closes...

210
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,280
...another one opens.

211
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,000
We can take advantage of the systems
that are in place on Miquelon Island

212
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,360
and offer selected boat crews
the opportunity to carry on working.

213
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,320
But this time with a different cargo.

214
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,160
-You want me to pour?
-No.

215
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,520
Now it's all over the fucking island.

216
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,040
This is an island
with no morals and no opinions.

217
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,440
Just a load of fucking boats
with nothing to carry and nowhere to go

218
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,400
Reason why Miquelon was used
to run whiskey in the first place

219
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,800
is 'cause it sits outside
the territorial waters of both America

220
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,840
and Canada.

221
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,960
Technically, it's French territory.

222
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,080
The FBI, the RCMP have no jurisdiction.

223
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,720
Where do you get this stuff?

224
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,000
I've established a supply chain

225
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,760
over the last four years
with associates in Belfast.

226
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,800
We decided it was time
to break into the American market.

227
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,160
That, my friend,
is the finest opium in the world.

228
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,640
Delivered to my warehouse
in Liverpool directly from Shanghai.

229
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,640
Michael, when it comes to this shit,
you're the expert.

230
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,080
I trust him.

231
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,120
What about the French police?

232
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,640
I've been in communication
with the Miquelon Prefect de Gendarme.

233
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,040
We fought in
two of the same battles in France.

234
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,160
We consider each other comrades.

235
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,760
I have offered my comrade
twelve million francs

236
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,800
if the boats between
Miquelon and Boston keep running.

237
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,080
We will have to take your proposal
to Uncle Jack in Boston.

238
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,840
Perhaps we can meet after
you've spoken with Uncle Jack, Michael.

239
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,840
Who I believe is your wife's uncle?

240
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,160
-Jack Nelson.
-[Connor] Hey! [chuckles]

241
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,400
The guy knows things
that can get him killed,

242
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,440
and he says them out loud.

243
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,160
I have a high regard for Mr Nelson.

244
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,320
He has a history not unlike my own.

245
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,520
Jack Nelson's past is forgotten.

246
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,880
[Connor] Not forgotten.

247
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,200
Fucking gone.

248
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,200
[Tommy] No, not gone.

249
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,680
Just erased from the records like my own.

250
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,920
Give him my regards, will you?

251
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,560
You haven't touched your drink, Tom.

252
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,840
You know, since we last met, Michael...

253
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,680
Well, I've become a better man.

254
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,480
I now realise that whiskey is just fuel
for the loud engines inside your head.

255
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,880
[men laughing]

256
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,320
Catch yourself on.

257
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,360
What is this guy, a fucking poet? Huh?

258
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,400
Oh, I do read poetry,
but I don't yet write it.

259
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,480
They say the fog is going to get worse.

260
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,720
Better get off this island
before it traps us here.

261
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,720
Just understand,
Uncle Jack decides everything. Okay?

262
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,120
And I decide when the meeting is over.

263
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,440
So sit down till I say.

264
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,840
[scoffs]

265
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,400
[clears throat]

[in French] My brother.

268
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,600
[in English] Put some fucking hair
on your chest? Huh?

269
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,280
Good boy.

270
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,240
[men chuckle]

271
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,880
Now, give us all a poem before we go.

272
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:17,120
Want to hear a poem? Want to hear a poem?

273
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,440
What about you?

274
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,520
Brainbox?

275
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,440
[sighs]

276
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,080
<i>I was angry with my friend</i>

277
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,920
<i>I told my wrath, my wrath did end</i>

278
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,880
<i>I was angry with my foe</i>

279
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,400
<i>I told it not</i>

280
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,000
<i>My wrath did grow</i>

281
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,760
It's from <i>The Poison Tree</i>

282
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,720
by William Blake.
You won't have heard of him.

283
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,560
Meeting over.

284
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,200
Oh, and by the way,

285
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,320
my friend, the police commissioner,

286
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,520
told me that he'd spoken
to his FBI liaison officer,

287
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,720
and he told him that there is an informant
in your organisation in South Boston.

288
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,160
I tell you this
in the spirit of corporate hygiene.

289
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,400
Here you are, Michael.

290
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,880
Beware the man
with a bleeding-heart tattoo

291
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,800
with "Maria" written in red.

292
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,120
Have a good day, gentlemen.

293
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,400
[man] Don't bother.

294
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,440
This time, don't burn it.

295
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,200
[in French] Every catastrophe
is also an opportunity.

296
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,400
[Ada] Arthur.

297
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,840
[clicks tongue]

298
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,120
Come on. Come on.

299
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,720
God.

300
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,120
God. If Polly was still here,
she'd never have let it get this bad.

301
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,120
Come on.

302
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,920
Come on, Arthur.

303
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,920
Arthur!

304
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,640
I'm not Polly,
but I am still your fucking sister.

305
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,480
You swore to me you would stop using.

306
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,040
[Arthur sniffs]

307
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,000
It's Christmas Day, Ada. Christmas Day.

308
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,800
Yes, it's Christmas.

309
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,000
So where the fuck
are the fucking presents?

310
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,520
I'll be all right in a bit...

311
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,320
[Ada sighs]

312
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,160
Great.

313
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,840
My brother off his face on junk.

314
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,960
[Arthur groans]

315
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,360
Every day is a question without an answer.

316
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,680
A leak without a bucket.

317
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,760
Me without a clue what to do.

318
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:42,960
Fuck!

319
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,000
[Arthur] I love you, Ada.

320
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,280
[children chattering]

321
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,680
[man] Children, Father Christmas has been.

322
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,200
[children] Father Christmas!

323
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,920
[boy] Go. Go on.

324
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,440
[girl] What did you ask for?

325
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,320
[man] What have we got?

326
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,600
Father Christmas got
stuck up the chimney again, did he?

327
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,520
[Ada] Mmm.

328
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,840
What ship are you on tomorrow?

329
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,280
[sighs]

330
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,160
Oh, the best, most expensive one.

331
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,040
And then we'll get there.
And Tommy will say,

332
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,840
"Hello, Lizzie. Hello, children."

333
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,000
In that dead voice.

334
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,320
Come on, Lizzie.

335
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,760
He'll be on holiday.

336
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,320
Being away might change him.

337
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,680
Even on holiday, Ada.

338
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,080
Even on top of a rocky mountain,

339
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,600
he'll be the same way
he's been since Polly died.

340
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,880
No more Polly,
no more whiskey, no more Tommy.

341
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,080
[Tommy sighs]

342
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,440
[bird chirping]

343
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,240
[in French] Put me through
to Detective Lawrence

344
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,000
at St John's Harbour Marine Police.

345
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,520
[in English] Yeah, I'm calling from
Miquelon Island. From the police station.

346
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,280
There is a boat leaving the island
now, heading across the border.

347
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,040
When it docks at St John's,

348
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,920
a man named Michael Gray
will board a ferry to Boston.

349
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,680
Listen very carefully.

350
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,520
He's wearing a dark coat, a blue suit
and carrying a black briefcase.

351
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,200
Inside the briefcase
is five pound of pure, refined opium.

352
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,160
A concerned citizen.

353
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,800
Yeah, my name is Mr Jones.

354
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,560
[receiver thuds]

355
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,440
[sighs]

356
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,440
[commissioner in French] You want a drink?

357
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,400
-[rubs hands]
-[in English] Yes, I do.

358
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,400
But I don't drink any more.

359
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,040
[commissioner in French] Why?

360
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,320
[Tommy sighs]

361
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,840
I have business.

362
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,040
I need to get off this island.

363
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,000
[telephone rings]

364
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,560
[Ada] You shouldn't be in here, Karl.

365
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,600
[telephone ringing]

366
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,080
Are you gonna answer it?

367
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,440
No, I don't work for him any more.

368
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,000
It might be important.

369
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,960
[Ada] That's why
I don't want to answer it.

370
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,000
[ringing continues]

371
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,679
-Can I answer it?
-No.

372
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,480
[Ada sighs]

373
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,679
Hello.

374
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,480
Mmm-hmm.

375
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,920
Fuck!

376
00:34:58,639 --> 00:34:59,719
[indistinct chattering]

377
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,520
Do you know who this man is?

378
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,720
[sighs]

379
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,600
All right. Come on, Arthur.

380
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,760
Ada...

381
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,960
[Arthur groans]

382
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,800
Hey, that tickles.

383
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,480
His brother, Thomas Shelby,
says don't serve him opium ever again.

384
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,280
Or someone will write Arthur Shelby's name
on your chest with a bayonet.

385
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,760
So... What the fuck?

386
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,680
I can't talk about anything in here.

387
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,240
I just wanted to see your face
and smell your perfume.

388
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,240
Tommy Shelby steps back into your life
and right away, this is what happens?

389
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,360
-No names in here.
-Sorry.

390
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,200
-Let's just call him the Devil.
-Take a seat.

391
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,280
[sighs] How is Laurence?

392
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,080
Oh, you know, missing his father.

393
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,560
What the fuck happened, Michael?

394
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,560
-It's in hand.
-Whose hand?

395
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,440
No, really.

396
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,720
Whose fucking hand, Michael?

397
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,680
Huh?

398
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,920
Like everything else in this city,
it's in the hand of your Uncle Jack.

399
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,000
I need him to get the charges lifted
and get me out of here.

400
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,560
I already talked to him.

401
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,160
He told me what the Devil proposed.

402
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,360
Tommy Shelby wants
to do business with Jack Nelson?

403
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,000
He wants to take on Boston?

404
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,440
No one is taking on anyone.

405
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,000
It's in hand. There are deals
being made at a high level,

406
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,560
but there are some people at the middle
and lower levels who cannot be trusted.

407
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,200
-Michael, this sounds fucking...
-Shut up and listen.

408
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,800
It was Tommy himself
who warned us of the informant.

409
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,640
We're guessing that the informant
tipped off the police about me.

410
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,600
Then the Devil's plan has already begun.

411
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,320
What's the point of ships and planes
if you can't get away?

412
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,840
Gina, in today's paper,
you'll read about a man

413
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,720
being fished out of the Boston Harbour
with a bleeding-heart tattoo

414
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,560
and the name "Maria" written on his arm.

415
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,280
Single shot to the head.

416
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,320
Yeah, I know. I read it already.

417
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,000
His death will lead to others.

418
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,920
For this business to work,
we must only use men we trust.

419
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,600
And while the clean-up
is being carried out,

420
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,880
you must keep things to yourself.

421
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,520
You talk loose to anyone,
it'll be me in the harbour

422
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,640
and you'll be the Maria
with the bleeding heart. Understand?

423
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,920
Michael, I just want the truth.

424
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,080
No, fuck that. I need the truth.
Why are you doing business with him again?

425
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,400
Gina, tell me what you're thinking
of getting Laurence for Christmas.

426
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,640
There are plenty of men
who can supply powder all over the world.

427
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,880
I don't understand why it needs to be him.

428
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,320
[Michael sighs]

429
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,480
Some of my business
with Tommy Shelby is unfinished.

430
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,760
This is my opportunity to finish it.

431
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,400
So speak to your uncle
and get me the fuck out of here.

432
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,760
[upbeat music playing]

433
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,800
[telephone ringing]

434
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,000
Hello?

435
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,880
Who?

436
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,080
Sure.

437
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,280
Why the hell not?

438
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,720
[chuckling]

439
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,080
[music continues]

440
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,760
I heard you were in town,
and I thought, "Well, hey..."

441
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,960
"Little man hitting the big time."

442
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,640
-You like jazz?
-[Tommy] No.

443
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,400
[jazz music plays louder]

444
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,760
[music stops]

445
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,520
What do you want, whiskey?

446
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,800
Water.

447
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,160
I don't have any water.
What else do you want?

448
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,880
I have a message for your Uncle Jack.

449
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,720
[Gina] Tommy, relax.

450
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,520
Have a fucking drink.

451
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,480
You know, my uncle is planning on buying
the United States import licence

452
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,680
to all the best Scotch
and Irish whiskey distilleries?

453
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,120
[glass thuds]

454
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,800
He's on his way to London
right now to make those deals.

455
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,520
Every drop in every state
will be another dime for Uncle Jack.

456
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:39,160
Yep. He's a very powerful,
very impressive man.

457
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,680
I've only seen photographs
when he was young.

458
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,960
Police mug shots.

459
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,920
And more recently
in high society magazines.

460
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,680
I think this represents progress.

461
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,240
[Gina] Yeah.

462
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,600
And before you tell me
what you want me to tell him,

463
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,080
I have a message from him to you.

464
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,840
No deal.

465
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,960
Hmm.

466
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:12,000
In England, when someone gets this close
to Tommy Shelby, it's, "Oh, the horror."

467
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,000
"Oh, the desire."

468
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:21,560
To fall on your knees,
open your mouth and say, "Yes, sir."

469
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,360
"Please, sir."

470
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,240
So it's Uncle Jack
you fall on your knees for, eh?

471
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,440
Not Michael?

472
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,080
He says no deal, Mr Shelby.

473
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,440
You smell of jail, Gina.

474
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,000
-And you drink too much.
-[chuckles]

475
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,040
Yes, but booze is legal.

476
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,760
Your white powder is not.

477
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:57,080
Jack has friends in the government now.
You have any idea of how far he's risen?

478
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,720
All the way to the fucking top.

479
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,680
Can't have white powder
on his shiny, black boots

480
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,400
when he's meeting
the president of the United States.

481
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,920
'Cause, yeah, that's where he goes now.

482
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,480
So he can't really be taking
such a big risk on such a little deal.

483
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,320
Go home, boy.

484
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,480
Bye-bye, Mr Shelby.

485
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,440
Yeah, you have another whiskey, Gina.
Another dime for Uncle Jack.

486
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,400
You mind if I smoke?

487
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,600
If it's legal, it's okay.

488
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,360
Before I go,

489
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,800
you should know...

490
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,400
that it was me

491
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:51,000
who tipped off the border police
about the contents of Michael's suitcase.

492
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,440
I'm the reason he's in jail.

493
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,520
I wanted to give your uncle a dilemma.

494
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,040
His favourite niece's husband

495
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,120
banged up in Boston for smuggling opium.

496
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,120
What does he do?

497
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,600
If he intervenes, has him released,
how'll that play in the Oval Office?

498
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,120
If he does nothing,

499
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,800
how does that play in South Boston?

500
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,920
Oh, fuck you.

501
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,640
Fine.

502
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,520
Stay here.

503
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,840
Deal here, die here,
for all I fucking care.

504
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,880
[music starts]

505
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,680
Die at whose hand, Gina?

506
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,880
[music stops abruptly]

507
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,960
My message to your uncle is this.

508
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,480
If he doesn't want to buy my opium,
I will sell to the East Boston Jews.

509
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,920
[Gina] Oh, baby.

510
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,920
Do you want to start a fucking war?

511
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,040
With that amount of opium,

512
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,360
the balance of power

513
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,840
between the Irish,
the Jewish and the Italians

514
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,120
would shift heavily in favour of the East.

515
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:25,320
I have excellent contacts
with the family that runs East Boston.

516
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,880
The Solomons family.
Maybe you've heard of 'em?

517
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:35,920
Once you people have accepted
that you must treat us as equals...

518
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,520
then I think our families
will work together very well.

519
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,600
Have a good day, Gina.

520
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,760
[kicks speaker and music resumes]

521
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,560
[telephone ringing]

522
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,200
[sighs] Yep?

523
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,080
Yes, I'll accept the call.

524
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,240
[Tommy] <i>Hello, Lizzie.</i>

525
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,960
Tommy...

526
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,320
It's Ruby, she's not well.

527
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,800
She's got a temperature of 101.

528
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,000
Doctor's just left.

529
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,080
What did he say?

530
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,680
<i>He says he thinks it's flu.</i>

531
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,400
But he's gonna come later to check on her.

532
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,640
She's been coughing, and...

533
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,440
[sighs]

534
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,680
Tommy, he said it's...
not a good idea for us to travel.

535
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,480
<i>We can't board that ship to Boston today.</i>

536
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,320
That's all right, Lizzie, don't worry.

537
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,480
Don't worry, you just stay there
for now and get her better and...

538
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,320
[clears throat] Can I speak to her?

539
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,320
<i>She's sleeping.</i>

540
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,720
Yeah. Well, let her sleep.

541
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,120
Let her sleep.

542
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,000
Lizzie, I've a bit more
business to do here.

543
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,160
Look, you just book a new passage
when Ruby's feeling better.

544
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,960
Doesn't matter if you're not here
for Christmas. Just get here.

545
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,320
<i>And then I'll get this business done.</i>

546
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,240
You get here with the children,
and then no more.

547
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,680
And it'll just be us
and the clean air out in the West.

548
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,320
<i>I found a place in the mountains.</i>

549
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,680
<i>There'll be snow.</i>

550
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,560
Tell Ruby I'll build her a snowman.

551
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,520
[Lizzie chuckles]

552
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,160
[Tommy sighs]

553
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,400
<i>How long has she been coughing?</i>

554
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,760
A few days. She's been out
running wild with Johnny Dogs' kids

555
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,480
out in the cold by the river.

556
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,400
[sighs]

557
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,800
Are you okay, Tommy?

558
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,480
Your voice, it sounds different.

559
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,280
<i>It's just cold.</i>

560
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,320
I'll get this business done in Boston.

561
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,600
That'll be the end of it.

562
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,040
Then I just want to...

563
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,280
I just want to pick Ruby up
and hold her in my arms, you know?

564
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,640
I miss the weight of carrying her.

565
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,280
<i>I gave her her presents early.</i>

566
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,200
She loves them.

567
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:34,320
Last night she was burning up.
She was delirious. She kept talking.

568
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,120
Johnny's kids have been
teaching her to speak Gypsy.

569
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,040
[chuckles]

570
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,840
Teaching her to rob and steal, more like.

571
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,960
[chuckles] Yeah.

572
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,960
When she was delirious,
she kept saying these Gypsy words...

573
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:55,720
<i>"Tickner Maura, Tickner Maura,
O Beng, O Beng."</i> Over and over again.

574
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,800
What? Lizzie, what...

575
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,160
What did you say? What did Ruby say?

576
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,480
<i>Tickner. Tickner Maura...</i>
Something like that.

577
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,560
Did she say any other words
that you didn't understand?

578
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,960
<i>O Beng.</i> I don't know...

579
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,640
No, Lizzie, did she say any other words
in Romany? Fucking listen to me.

580
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,840
I don't know Romany words, Tommy.

581
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:19,800
<i>I don't think so.</i>

582
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,200
Just <i>"Tickner Maura"</i> and <i>"O Beng"?</i>

583
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,160
Yes.

584
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,280
She see anything when she was burning up?

585
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,680
<i>-What could she see?</i>
-Fuck.

586
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,920
Please just answer the fucking question!

587
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,160
She said she could see a man.

588
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,840
A man with green eyes.

589
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,000
<i>She was delirious. She was burning up.</i>

590
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,000
What the fuck is the matter?

591
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,240
All right, listen, Lizzie,
I'm coming home.

592
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,840
It's just a fever, love.

593
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,760
I'm coming home on the next steamer.

594
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,680
You keep her out of school,
and you keep her away from...

595
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,600
-Tommy...
<i>-Keep her away from the river.</i>

596
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,800
<i>Don't let her ride a horse
or go near a horse.</i>

597
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:55,680
Tell Johnny Dogs and his wives
the words that Ruby has been saying.

598
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,920
Do you hear me? Tell Johnny's eldest wife
to put a Black Madonna around her neck.

599
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
You listen to Esmeralda
the same way you listen to a doctor.

600
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,360
<i>-You hear me?</i>
-Fucking Gypsy stuff.

601
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,080
Yes, it is Gypsy fucking stuff, Lizzie!
Yes, it fucking is!

602
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,800
-[scoffs]
<i>-And you get Curly there.</i>

603
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,480
<i>Tell him to stay in the stable
with Ruby's horses.</i>

604
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,480
And you do everything that Johnny Dogs
and his wives fucking tell you.

605
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,720
Do you understand me?

606
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,320
I'm sorry, Lizzie. Do you understand?

607
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,360
<i>Okay.</i>

608
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,720
I'll do it.

609
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,160
All right, I'm coming home.

610
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,720
[receiver bangs]

611
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,160
[sighs]

612
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,280
[sighs]

613
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,760
Polly?

614
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,080
Polly?

615
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,320
They know I'm trying to get out.

616
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,280
Pol, they're coming for me.

617
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,680
[footsteps echo]

618
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,440
-You son of a fucking bitch.
-[Tommy] You sound American, Michael.

619
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,720
I have to go back to England early.
Let's make this quick, eh?

620
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,320
-You just fuck people up and you run away.
-No, this business will continue.

621
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,600
Jack Nelson is also travelling to England.

622
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,960
To London and to Edinburgh
to buy import licences.

623
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,080
How do you know
where Jack Nelson is going?

624
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,040
Well, I have copies of his itinerary.

625
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,960
Of his personal correspondence.

626
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,680
Letters from the president of
the United States and his many mistresses.

627
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,600
I have contacts in his organisation.

628
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,360
An Irishman with a mortgage
is a powerful resource, Michael.

629
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,800
You're dead, Tommy.

630
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,600
You're out of your fucking depth.

631
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,680
You're dead already.

632
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,240
You threatened to sell to the Jews.

633
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:22,480
I have contacts in this prison. These boys
will look after you during your stay.

634
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,560
I don't need your people to look after me.

635
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,920
-Jack Nelson's getting me out of here.
-[Tommy] Yeah?

636
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:28,960
Is he?

637
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,080
This is a letter...
Here, give him this letter, will you?

638
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,840
This is a letter
from the president's personal secretary,

639
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,880
suggesting Jack Nelson
keep you in here for a while longer.

640
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,160
Just until the press
lose interest, Michael.

641
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,880
Fuck you.

642
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,720
[Tommy] You'll be released eventually.

643
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,160
And then you can execute
your business with me as before.

644
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,880
Our business being five million dollars
for a shipment of powder.

645
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,120
And when the exchange is done,
we can shake hands

646
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,560
and go our separate ways once more, eh?

647
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,520
So, you didn't learn.

648
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,120
When my mother died
at the hands of your ambition,

649
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,960
you didn't learn your limitations.

650
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,800
I have no limitations.

651
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,200
Oh, and by the way, Michael,

652
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,120
according to
Jack Nelson's personal accounts,

653
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:33,120
he bought passage for five people
from Boston to Liverpool.

654
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,360
Five people. His wife, his mistress,

655
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,440
President Roosevelt's son, himself,

656
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,640
and Gina Gray.

657
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,760
Gina's coming to London, Michael.

658
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,440
Where I'll be happy
to show her the sights.

659
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,640
Fuck! You fucking bastard, Tommy!

660
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,640
-Spirits, Boston-Irish, Uncle Jack.
-[Michael] You're the Devil!

661
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,080
-The fucking Devil!
-I'm ready for the conversation.
