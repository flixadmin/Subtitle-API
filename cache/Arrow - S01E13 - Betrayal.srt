1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,044
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,371
For five years, I was stranded
on an island with only one goal...

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,686
...survive.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,446
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,080
Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,209
To use the list of names he left me...

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,806
...and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,607
To do this,
I must become someone else.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,883
I must become something else.

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,405
Previously on Arrow:

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,928
Next time your daughter calls
the vigilante, we'll be able to listen.

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,765
I know you swore to bring
this guy down, detective...

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,447
...but using your own daughter as bait,
that's stone-cold.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,364
- Where'd you get it?
- From your stepfather.

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,211
- And where did he get it?
- Belongs to your mother.

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,126
Ready for transfer, sir.

17
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,805
Hi, George.

18
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,122
- Vanch.
- Surprised to see me?

19
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,409
I imagine you would be,
seeing as how you botched my trial.

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,888
And from what Viv here tells me,
protecting my interests.

21
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,211
There were contingencies
that couldn't be anticipated.

22
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,483
Yes, Vivian told me. The head
of the Triad getting ventilated...

23
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,611
...Bertinelli getting collared,
and, uh, this archer.

24
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,526
Exactly. What am I supposed to do
in the face of something like that?

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,523
Absolutely nothing, Georgie.

26
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,730
Tell you what.
All is forgiven. Give us a hug.

27
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,410
Come on.

28
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,088
You know, I could use a place to stay...

29
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,925
...while I'm getting my sea legs
back under me, George.

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,450
And you got a nice place here.
What do you say?

31
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,009
George? George?

32
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,890
I hope George has been
food shopping.

33
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,804
I'm famished.

34
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,727
So this book contains a list of the names
of the guys you've been hunting.

35
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,090
And this book, your mother's,
has the same list of names.

36
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,961
It's identical.

37
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,282
So where'd your mother get her copy,
Oliver?

38
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,046
For that matter, who gave it to you?

39
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,610
Felicity Smoak. She said
that Walter found it in their bedroom.

40
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,728
And now he's missing.

41
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,250
She's my mother, Diggle. She's not
the kind of person who would...

42
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,084
Have her husband disappeared?

43
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,169
Because that's really the question.

44
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,682
I understand why you would believe
your mother over your stepfather...

45
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,684
...but I tend to believe the innocent
party is whoever's missing...

46
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,842
...and presumed dead.

47
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,402
Twitch and I will open your throat.

48
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,086
- How many more are with you?
- What?

49
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,931
You have 10 seconds
to tell me something I believe...

50
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,361
...before I cut out your voice box.

51
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,568
Wait, wait, wait.
Yao Fei sent me here...

52
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,564
...and I'm pretty sure
it wasn't so you could kill me.

53
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,529
What?

54
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,525
Yao Fei.
He gave me directions to your...

55
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,603
...plane.

56
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,721
Frank, you gotta be kidding me. You
can't throw me another assignment now.

57
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,884
It's "lieutenant," and I'm pretty sure
that's what gives me the authority.

58
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,408
I'm drawing in on the Hood investigation.
I am gonna get this bastard.

59
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,245
Have you considered the possibility
no one wants you to?

60
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,290
- What?
- He saved the Christmas hostages...

61
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,011
...he took down an arsonist
and armored car thieves.

62
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,841
And just last week he busted the Vertigo
drug ring when we couldn't.

63
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,891
What was urban legend
is becoming heroic.

64
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,971
If this man's a hero, I don't know
what my life in this city as a cop means.

65
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,804
Then I suggest you find
meaning in following orders.

66
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,691
Frank, listen to me. I'm close.

67
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,683
If my lead comes to something more...

68
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,525
Come to me with something real,
Quentin, and we'll talk.

69
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,251
In the meantime,
I'm assigning you another case.

70
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,127
Hey.

71
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,042
- Heading out?
- Mm, yes.

72
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,163
A meeting with the financial planners.

73
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,283
Are you all right?

74
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,887
There was something that
I wanted to talk to you about.

75
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,887
I wanna talk to you about Walter.

76
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,886
Right around Christmas,
when he disappeared...

77
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,008
...he gave me this.

78
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,204
This is your father's notebook.

79
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,770
He kept a list of all the people
in Starling City who owed him favors.

80
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,686
I had no idea
there were so many of them.

81
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,765
I've been researching
some of those names online...

82
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,441
...and they're not good people.

83
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,282
Oliver, I have no idea what your father
was involved in or with whom.

84
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,241
And you and your sister both now know
that he wasn't exactly honest with me.

85
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,971
- Then we need to find out...
- No.

86
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,569
If what you say is true
and this list is filled with bad people...

87
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,081
...and Walter was looking into it
and now he...

88
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,050
The only way to keep this family safe...

89
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,363
...is for everyone in it
to stop asking questions.

90
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,491
Including you, Oliver. Promise me.

91
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,930
So this is really happening.

92
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,090
Four hundred and ninety-eight hours
of community service to go.

93
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,925
Four hundred and ninety-nine.
This orientation doesn't count.

94
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,765
Tell me how this is not cruel
and unusual punishment.

95
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,442
Anastasia, I'd like you to meet
our new intern, Thea Queen.

96
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,127
Interns get school credit.
I'm more like a court-ordered slave.

97
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,361
I can relate.

98
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,683
Anastasia is on a one-year
pro bono sabbatical from her law firm.

99
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,081
And apparently
from my six-figure salary.

100
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,686
The experience of helping others
is its own reward.

101
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,049
I have yet to see evidence of that.
And speaking of lack of evidence...

102
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,407
...Cyrus Vanch was released
from Iron Heights.

103
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,882
We represent a victims' advocacy group
who's trying to keep Vanch locked up.

104
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,760
- I'm calling Kate Spencer.
- I already did.

105
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,367
She said there's nothing the DA's Office
can do without further evidence.

106
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,806
Well, then I'm going to her.

107
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,122
She also said
not to show up at her office.

108
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,965
Vanch is connected
to human trafficking, drug running...

109
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,726
...racketeering
and at least 52 different homicides.

110
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,160
Okay. So, what's the play?

111
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,926
Unless you have access
to some private police force...

112
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,651
...Vanch will stay free
to roam the streets.

113
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,807
I have to get this.

114
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,084
- Hello?
- How does a night with me...

115
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,924
...and a dozen famous chefs sound?

116
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,123
Like an episode of The Bachelor.

117
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,170
I'm auditioning potential chefs
for the club tomorrow night.

118
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,762
I've arranged a tasting and I could use
an extra set of taste buds.

119
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,084
I'm trying to figure out how to get
a vicious criminal back in jail. I can't.

120
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,409
- Perfect, it sounds like hungry work.
- Tomorrow night?

121
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,130
Maybe we could do it early?

122
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,169
Look, I gotta go.

123
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,449
- There's someone I have to call.
- I'll see you later. Bye.

124
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,250
You don't find that a little convenient,
her just so happening to burn the book?

125
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,006
- She did it out of concern for my safety, Diggle.
- Or her own.

126
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,840
Oliver, you said it yourself.
Whoever compiled that list...

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,289
...is involved in something very dangerous,
and if your mother is lying to you...

128
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,568
And she didn't know any
of the names on the list.

129
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,769
She said she didn't.
You don't have to take her word for it.

130
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,864
Oliver, if this were anybody
else, you'd be hodded up

131
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:28,869
right now on your way to an
arrow-side chat with them.

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,482
This isn't anybody else.
This is my mother. And I know her.

133
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,245
What's that?

134
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,404
That is the phone I gave to Lance
so that he could contact the Hood.

135
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,801
Is he asking you to turn yourself in?

136
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,609
He gave it to Laurel.

137
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,040
- Hello?
- I need your help.

138
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,645
That's why you have the phone.

139
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,845
Cyrus Vanch was just released
from prison on a technicality...

140
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,322
...living large in his lawyer's house.

141
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,764
There's no evidence of foul play...

142
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,529
...but I know he's just Vanch's first
victim and he won't be his last.

143
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,527
- What about the police?
- They can't move on him...

144
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,762
...without evidence
of new criminal activity.

145
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,321
Laurel, obtaining evidence isn't what I do.

146
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,562
Vanch is dangerous.

147
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,884
Hold onto the phone. I'll call.

148
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,160
Laurel needs my help.

149
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,321
Oliver, are you running to help her...

150
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,642
...or away from the truth
about your mother?

151
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,362
I have work to do.

152
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,970
- Hey, detective?
- I'm busy, Kelton.

153
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,771
- I'm pretty sure you're gonna wanna hear this.
- Yup?

154
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,003
The bug I put in that phone
from the vigilante just lit up.

155
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,891
Your daughter's playing Maid Marian
to Robin Hood again.

156
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,490
- Where you going?
- Lieutenant Pike's office.

157
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,244
If she's meeting with the Hood...

158
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,091
...there's gonna be a task force there
when she does.

159
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,322
See, we gotta look at all this
as an opportunity.

160
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,483
The Triad and the Bertinelli organization
are leaderless.

161
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,648
The giant sucking sound
you're hearing...

162
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,326
...is the current power vacuum
in Starling City.

163
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,965
One that I plan on filling.

164
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,849
How are you going to convince
the Triad and Bertinelli's crew...

165
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,809
...that they should sign up with you?

166
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,930
Well...

167
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,725
...that's an excellent question.

168
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,081
I need to do something.

169
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,691
Something spectacular to get their
attention and earn their respect.

170
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,321
You know what I learned in prison?

171
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,970
If you want to be respected...

172
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,888
...you find the biggest guy
and put him down permanent.

173
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,966
I think I just found the biggest guy.

174
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,324
This is gonna be fun.
I even wore my fat pants.

175
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,563
- I don't wanna know what those are, do I?
- Nope.

176
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,283
- This is work. It'll just be a second.
- Okay.

177
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,285
- Hello?
- It's me. I have something.

178
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,487
Can you meet?

179
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,207
Uh, yeah. Where?

180
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,727
Rooftop, Winick Building, 30 minutes.

181
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,087
Good work, Kelton.

182
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,880
Okay, everybody.

183
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,243
Rubber bullets. This is my daughter here.
She cannot come to any harm.

184
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,041
But outside of that,
you do whatever needs doing...

185
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,921
...to bring that archer down.

186
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,090
You got it, sir.

187
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,401
You sure about this?

188
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,470
Look, she knows I'd do
anything to catch this bastard

189
00:12:28,495 --> 00:12:30,475
and this the best, this is
is the only option I've got.

190
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,325
Look, I wanna get this guy
just as badly as you do.

191
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,000
I just don't wanna see anything
come between you two.

192
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,051
I warned her. I said stay away
from this lunatic, she didn't.

193
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,965
You don't think
that turns a knife in my back?

194
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,600
I hope she sees it that way.

195
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,522
Mm, put those puppy-dog eyes away.

196
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,684
- Something's come up at work.
- That can't wait until tomorrow?

197
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,684
It'll only be an hour.
I can meet you at the club.

198
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,929
One hour.

199
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,410
- An hour and a half, tops.
- Mm.

200
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,131
Ricky has been driving me
for six years now...

201
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,841
...and I can't remember the last time
he missed a day.

202
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,049
Thank you for offering to fill in,
Mr. Diggle.

203
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,483
It's my pleasure, Mrs. Queen.
Believe me.

204
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,007
Are you sure my son won't miss you?

205
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,043
He said he was staying in for the evening.

206
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,486
And you believed him?

207
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,086
It's been my experience
when your son wants some alone time...

208
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,607
...there's not much
I can do to stop him.

209
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,245
Much to my chagrin.

210
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,087
You can stop just up ahead.

211
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,929
No need to escort me inside.
I'm fine on my own, Mr. Diggle.

212
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,405
Of course, Mrs. Queen.

213
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,162
Were you surprised? You were? Ha, ha.

214
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,923
Look who just came in.

215
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,130
Mr. Diggle.

216
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,683
Mrs. Queen,
I was just, uh, looking for the restroom.

217
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,643
Excuse me, ladies. Happy birthday.

218
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,568
Hello, Laurel.

219
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,769
- Thank you for helping.
- I couldn't do much.

220
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,801
Vanch's position is too heavily fortified.
But I did get this.

221
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,007
Evidence he's trying
to take over the positions...

222
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,640
...vacated by Frank Bertinelli and...

223
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,086
And the Triad.

224
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,047
What's wrong?

225
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,568
- We're not alone.
- What?

226
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,121
S.C.P.D. Get down!

227
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,970
- Hands where we can see them!
- Dad.

228
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,321
Do it now!

229
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,768
You so much as leave a bruise on her
and I will drag you down to hell myself.

230
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,490
Laurel, I'm sorry.

231
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,330
Quentin, don't!

232
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,970
I don't know what's worse.

233
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,203
The fact that you lied to me
or nearly got me killed.

234
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,091
You were completely safe.

235
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,046
I was on a rooftop with an army of men
pointing their guns in my face.

236
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,866
You shouldn't have been on
that roof in the first place...

237
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:25,891
No.

238
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,963
You wanted me on that roof.

239
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,122
Wasn't that the whole point
of your little trap?

240
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,851
- I'm trying to catch a killer.
- You manipulated me.

241
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,207
Manipulated?
You practically ran to this guy.

242
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,885
I told you. I said stay away...

243
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,963
- Before you gave me the phone.
- What?

244
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,805
That's before you realized
you could use me as bait.

245
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,280
- Your own daughter.
- But you wouldn't listen to me.

246
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,040
You are so blinded by your hate
for him that you don't realize...

247
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,045
...the damage that it's doing
in your own life, to your family.

248
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,486
So, what happens when you catch him?
What happens then, Dad?

249
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,723
You're gonna find another criminal?

250
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,089
Somebody else to blame
for Mom leaving?

251
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,890
For Sara dying? For your drinking?

252
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,923
- That's enough, Laurel.
- Yeah, you're damn right, it is.

253
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,961
Laurel.

254
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,649
The phone.

255
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,762
Give me the phone.

256
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,126
- Laurel could've been hurt or worse.
- And I suppose that was Lance's fault.

257
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,891
What's your point, Dig?

258
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,886
Just that you don't really see straight
when it comes to Laurel or your mother.

259
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,845
This is not the time
to bring this up again.

260
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,405
Okay.

261
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,451
Okay. But there's something I should tell you
and it's better I tell you now than later.

262
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,888
I'll be driving your mother
around for a few days.

263
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,480
- You're spying on her?
- Just doing my due diligence, Oliver.

264
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,887
See if she meets with anyone
we might be interested in.

265
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,010
She's not a suspect. She's my mother.

266
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:06,200
Which is exactly why someone needs
to take a close, objective look at her.

267
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,443
Oliver, something's going on in this city,
you know it.

268
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,609
That doesn't mean she's involved.

269
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,922
Then there's no harm in me driving her
around for a few days, is there?

270
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,165
I still can't believe it.
He used me as bait.

271
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,322
- Who?
- My father.

272
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,482
He was trying to catch the vigilante.

273
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,423
He eavesdropped on my
phone conversation with

274
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:42,208
him and then lied in
wait with his jackboots.

275
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,084
- This was tonight?
- Yes.

276
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,969
While you were working?

277
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,611
This was work.

278
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,206
So you met up with the Hood guy?
Knowingly?

279
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,887
He's contacted me before.

280
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,726
He helped me with the Declan case
and Joanna's arson investigation.

281
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,844
- The Declan case was months ago.
- I know.

282
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,163
- Tommy, I've been wanting to tell you.
- Laurel, he's a murderer.

283
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,287
- You sound like my father.
- Well, I hate to break it to you but he's right.

284
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,364
Are you seriously taking his side?

285
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,522
He's been lying to me for weeks.

286
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,531
Yeah, it feels like crap, doesn't it?

287
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,323
Tommy.

288
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,409
A sting operation to catch
the notorious Starling City Vigilante...

289
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,045
...wreaked havoc last night...

290
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,363
...despite the police's failed attempt
to apprehend the vigilante.

291
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,804
Police have continued to insist
that their warnings remain.

292
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,645
This archer is to be considered
armed and dangerous.

293
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,327
Should you find yourself in harm's way,
as always, call 911.

294
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,809
Interesting.

295
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,522
Using deception and intimidation
to make a name for himself.

296
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,081
Ha, ha. This guy stole my move.

297
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,240
I have news...

298
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,803
...from my friend
in the police department.

299
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,924
I think I've figured out a way
to get the Hood out and into the open.

300
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,127
Huh.

301
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,246
Astonish me.

302
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,127
Remember that attorney, Laurel Lance?

303
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,848
Hey, what's wrong with this picture?
You look like you're working.

304
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,526
Heh. I'm going over résumés
for the chef's position at the nightclub.

305
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,967
This guy looks pretty good.
He won Top Chef season six.

306
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,562
At this point, it is basically a culinary
prerequisite to be on that show.

307
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,051
Oh.

308
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,921
Can I talk to you about something?

309
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,126
Tommy, every time you wanna talk about
something and that something is Laurel...

310
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,762
...you look like you're about to tell me
you have a terminal disease.

311
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,966
- She's been working with the Hood guy.
- What?

312
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,408
You're letting her work
with that crazy person?

313
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,649
- She could get hurt, Tommy.
- I'm not letting her do anything.

314
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,484
I only just found out about it...

315
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,361
...because she accidentally slipped up
on one of her many lies.

316
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,643
Wait, she's lying to you?
That doesn't sound like Laurel.

317
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,406
Lying, keeping secrets about
who she's spending time with.

318
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,449
Does that remind you
of anybody we know?

319
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,410
Me, in every relationship
that I've been in.

320
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,450
Me too. Except this one.

321
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,806
There's some sort of infatuation thing
going on here.

322
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,008
We both know that she has
a pretty strong track record...

323
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,562
...of being attracted to guys
who are dangerous, who break the rules.

324
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,805
Show me a more dangerous rule breaker
than the Hood.

325
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,088
I just think you need to have
an honest chat with her.

326
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,927
Find out the real reason
she's keeping secrets.

327
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,243
I can't believe that Laurel,
of all people, would lie to my face.

328
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,206
I guess that's the way that it is
with the people that you're closest to.

329
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,443
I know.

330
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,484
But talk to her anyway and fix this...

331
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,691
...before it becomes something
that's unfixable.

332
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,126
- It's Chinese. It means...
- "Survive."

333
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,723
What do you think he meant,
besides not getting killed?

334
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,527
There's an airfield 10 clicks from here.

335
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,489
It's key off this island.

336
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,086
Yao Fei and I had been observing it
for months...

337
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,647
...familiarizing ourselves
with their operations.

338
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,167
We were supposed
to get off this island together.

339
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:36,087
But then Yao Fei was compromised,
and we were separated.

340
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,323
What's this for?

341
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,331
I think Yao Fei sent you here because he
knows I cannot take the airstrip alone.

342
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,005
Sounds like Yao Fei.

343
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,401
He is a softer judge of character
than I am.

344
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,246
If you're going to have my back...

345
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,284
...I need to know you can cover it.

346
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,810
What are you doing? Fight back.

347
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,242
Keep your blade up.
Always stay behind your sword.

348
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,201
You have no skill, no strength,
no training.

349
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,887
To say you fight like a girl
would be a compliment.

350
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,123
I told you, I'm not a soldier.
I was shipwrecked here.

351
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,443
I killed the guy that was wearing
this uniform by accident.

352
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,730
Where was Yao Fei?

353
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,081
He told me to run...

354
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,447
...and I did.

355
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,161
Hey, it's Tommy. Hit me on the beep.

356
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,920
Hey, it's me again.

357
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,522
Please call me back.

358
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,204
I think we should talk.

359
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,890
I was just leaving you a message.

360
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,442
I love a girl
who can take care of herself.

361
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,121
But can't block a Taser.

362
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,048
No need to get out of the car,
Mr. Diggle.

363
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,329
It's just my accountant.
The only threat is boredom.

364
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,807
It's no problem at all, Mrs. Queen.
It's my job.

365
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,522
Yes. Well, then, take the night off.
I'm quite all right.

366
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,530
What do you want?

367
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,483
It's taken care of. I've taken care of it.

368
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,160
Carl Ballard
will not be a problem anymore.

369
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,322
Given your propensity
for squeamishness...

370
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,330
...I'm assuming that
Mr. Ballard remains in good health.

371
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,162
I made it clear to him, persuasively,
that his plans endanger the undertaking.

372
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,762
- I didn't have to make the usual threats.
- Excellent.

373
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,849
Now, one more matter to attend to.

374
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,365
I need you to have
the contents of this address...

375
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,602
...removed and disposed off
thoroughly.

376
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,968
The warehouse where you're storing
the remains of the Queen's Gambit.

377
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,522
I already told you,
I knew Robert's yacht was sabotaged.

378
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,123
And I don't think it serves for anyone
to find evidence of that.

379
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,722
What the hell are you doing?

380
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,004
Nothing. Just hanging.

381
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,011
I work for Mrs. Queen.

382
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,728
And I work security
for the man she's meeting with.

383
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,321
- Guess we're on the same team.
- I don't think so.

384
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,370
And I'm gonna need to see what
you put in your pocket just then.

385
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,203
- What are you, man, the police?
- Show it to me.

386
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,203
Do it now.

387
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,921
Right.

388
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,367
Just thought I could come in here
and ruin my lungs a little bit.

389
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,926
I know it's a filthy habit.

390
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,850
Laurel, it's me. Can we talk?

391
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,244
Laurel?

392
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,731
Laurel?

393
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,924
Make sure this message finds
its way to the vigilante.

394
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,641
Do it fast, because at sunrise
I'm gonna leave pieces of this girl...

395
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,730
...all over Starling City
unless he pays me a little visit.

396
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,646
You know, give us a chance
to get to know each other better.

397
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,041
What do we do? Can your CSls...?

398
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,124
I don't know. Can they track this
or trace it or something?

399
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,927
- How did he know about Laurel?
- What?

400
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,927
How does this guy know
Laurel is connected to the Hood?

401
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,326
No idea.

402
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,802
I only found out about it myself
last night.

403
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,324
- She said you knew.
- Well, just me and...

404
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,680
Mr. Lance, that maniac has got Laurel.

405
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,248
You've gotta call in posse
or something.

406
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,323
- I don't know, SWAT teams.
- I can't.

407
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,562
Detective Lance.

408
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,207
I gotta go make a call.

409
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,287
Thanks for coming. It didn't seem like a
good idea to talk about this at your house.

410
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,125
Would've been awkward
for you to explain to my mother...

411
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,647
- ...that you're spying on her.
- No, man.

412
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,283
- The awkward part's coming up.
- You bugged my mother?

413
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,249
Just listen.

414
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,644
It's taken care of. I've taken care of it.

415
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,280
Carl Ballard
will not be a problem anymore.

416
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,482
Given your propensity for squeamishness...

417
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,610
...I'm assuming that Mr. Ballard remains
in good health.

418
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,002
I made it clear to him, persuasively...

419
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,367
...that his plans endanger the undertaking.

420
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,285
I didn't have to make the usual threats.

421
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,204
Excellent.

422
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,408
Now, one more matter to attend to.

423
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,724
I need you to have the contents
of this address...

424
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,048
...removed and disposed off
thoroughly.

425
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,522
The warehouse where you're storing
the remains of the Queen's Gambit.

426
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,761
I already told you...

427
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,810
...I knew Robert's yacht was sabotaged.

428
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,325
- I'm sorry, man.
- The yacht was sabotaged?

429
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,842
- Somebody tried to kill my father.
- Your mother was involved somehow.

430
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,731
You do not know
that she was involved, Diggle.

431
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,645
What I do know, Oliver,
and so do you...

432
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,087
...is that she kept this a secret.

433
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,966
Why would she do that
if she didn't have something to hide?

434
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,203
- Isn't that...?
- Yeah.

435
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,527
You have three seconds before I have
this line permanently disconnected.

436
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,126
It's Laurel. She's been kidnapped.

437
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,611
Listen, whoever this is,
he's gonna kill my daughter.

438
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,406
Please believe me.

439
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,841
Sorry.

440
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,449
It's nothing personal.

441
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,209
The airstrip is
a very heavily fortified position.

442
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,082
I've been there.

443
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,568
- And I cannot take it on my own.
- So what?

444
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,245
Huh? You're just gonna kill me?

445
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:38,088
- Ah.
- Like I said, it's nothing personal.

446
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,840
If you're alive, they will find you.
If they find you, they will torture you...

447
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:47,329
...until you give up my location,
and I cannot allow for that to happen.

448
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,848
Hey, no, wait.
No, please don't do this.

449
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,809
I'm not gonna say anything to them.

450
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,409
Don't make it more difficult
upon yourself.

451
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,884
I can do this in a way
that you will not feel it at all.

452
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,089
- Slade Wilson.
- Oliver Queen.

453
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,208
Well, Oliver Queen...

454
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,930
...there might be a fighter
inside of you after all.

455
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:49,162
Detective, if this is another trick,
you will not like the consequences.

456
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,002
I'm not particularly happy right now.

457
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,528
I hate you.
I hate everything you stand for.

458
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,843
But this lunatic has my little girl.

459
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,367
He left this behind
as some kind of ransom note.

460
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,010
His name is Cyrus Vanch.

461
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,571
Jeez.

462
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,083
- He'll kill her if he doesn't get you.
- He'll kill her anyway...

463
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,844
...so why come to me?

464
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,009
It's a pretty tight circle that knows about
you and my daughter working together.

465
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,642
If Vanch knows it's because
someone at the precinct talked.

466
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,081
- There isn't anybody else I can trust.
- Vanch is holed up in a mansion.

467
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,165
It's a heavily fortified position.
I was there. I can't take it by myself.

468
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,526
I need your help.

469
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,168
Then I need yours.

470
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,564
Time's running out
and still no visit from your friend.

471
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,361
I might have overestimated
his fondness for you.

472
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:59,648
Assault with intent and kidnapping.

473
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,561
You're gonna rot in prison
for life this time.

474
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,924
That's assuming
your hooded BFF saves you.

475
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,880
And his chances of survival
are not so great.

476
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,882
He's going up against trained men
with their fingers on the trigger...

477
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,010
...of guns that fire
up to 600 rounds per minute.

478
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,921
Now, I'm no Einstein,
but that is a lot of bullets.

479
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,731
And even if he were to take them out...

480
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,281
...I have two sharpshooters
on the roof.

481
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,248
And even if he were to get by them...

482
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,611
...what's he gonna do
against the veritable army

483
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:57,628
of sons of bitches I've
got waiting for him?

484
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:15,370
Now, as I said, I'm no Einstein,
but I can count to 24.

485
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,842
In case you're wondering, I was,
so I studied up on my news footage...

486
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,925
...24 is the exact number of arrows
he carries in his quiver...

487
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,731
...and fléchettes around his forearm.

488
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,091
Lose the bow, Merida.

489
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,686
Ventilate him.

490
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,485
My daughter. My little girl!

491
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,084
I'm the vigilante, you're the cop.

492
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,210
Doesn't mean I have to read
the bastard his rights, though.

493
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,084
Laurel, are you okay?

494
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,766
Yeah. Yeah.

495
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,251
I'm okay.

496
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,641
All right, you're good to go.
I'll take you home now.

497
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,760
I can take a cab.

498
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,282
Laurel, you had a trauma.
I'll drive you home.

499
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,602
- No.
- What?

500
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,366
I'm gonna need you
to keep your distance for a while.

501
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,769
- Laurel.
- Dad, I love you.

502
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,321
I'll always love you.

503
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,366
But what I can't do right now
is trust you.

504
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,689
I was just doing my job.
I thought you'd understand at least that.

505
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,683
That part I do understand.

506
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,800
But lying to me, using me?

507
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,840
It's gonna take longer.

508
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,806
Are you all right?

509
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,886
What would you think
if I said I didn't know?

510
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,008
That you were being honest.

511
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,050
My father has the phone now.

512
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,321
I don't think he'll be
giving it back anytime soon.

513
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,483
Maybe that's good.

514
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,326
I didn't see
how it would put you in danger.

515
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,608
I'm a big girl.

516
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,766
- I knew the risks.
- Now I know them.

517
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,121
And I'm not willing
to take them with you.

518
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,170
- What does that mean?
- It means goodbye.

519
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,084
Laurel?

520
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,881
Laurel.

521
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,365
Oh, my God, Laurel.

522
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,370
- Laurel, tell me you are okay, please.
- No, no, I'm fine.

523
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,887
I'm so sorry.

524
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:13,085
No, no, it doesn't matter,
just as long as you're okay.

525
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,008
You know, this does not change
anything between you and I.

526
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,007
It takes two men to take the airfield.

527
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,966
And if you compromise my getting
off this island, I will kill you.

528
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,049
You've had your second chance.

529
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,131
You need me
just as much as I need you.

530
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,445
So, what's our next step?

531
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,446
Turning you into something
that won't get us both killed.

532
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,840
Choose a weapon.

533
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,611
We're starting now?

534
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,888
That's mine.

535
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,404
You're the lunatic who tortured me.

536
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,449
- No, that was another guy.
- Bull.

537
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,690
This mask, it's my operational
equivalent to a balaclava.

538
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,370
My partner and I wore them...

539
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,251
...to keep our identities classified
during our missions.

540
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,004
You're lying.

541
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,290
Fyers told me that this nutcase
is a prisoner on the island.

542
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,091
And Fyers is such
a trustworthy individual?

543
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,370
He lied to you.

544
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,282
My partner and I came here to free
Yao Fei and get him off this island.

545
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,246
We're ASIS.

546
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,010
Australian Intelligence.

547
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:53,324
Now, you're going to find
your silver weapon.

548
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,849
Have you considered a sword?
I like swords.

549
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,689
I made it clear to him, persuasively...

550
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,047
...that his plans endanger the undertaking.

551
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,921
I didn't have to make the usual threats.

552
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,124
I've listened to this 15 times.

553
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,563
It's definitely her voice, Diggle.
I just...

554
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,970
I can't believe it's her.

555
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,211
We all have blind spots
when it comes to family.

556
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,603
Yeah. Laurel's almost got her killed
tonight. Vanch never would've known...

557
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,570
...about her connection to me
if Lance hadn't lied to her.

558
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,726
Guess the lesson here
is blind trust can be dangerous.

559
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,168
I made it clear to him, persuasively...

560
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,971
...that his plans endanger the undertaking.

561
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,642
- I didn't have to make the usual threats.
- Excellent.

562
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,644
- What's the undertaking?
- I don't know.

563
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,441
But with all this talk about threats,
it can't be good.

564
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,042
You warned me that if she was lying...

565
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,687
...it would be to cover up her
involvement in something dangerous.

566
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,402
I need to know
what the undertaking is.

567
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,242
What are you gonna do?

568
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,888
I need to have another chat
with my mom.

569
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,484
I'll need the Unidac merger finalized
by the end of the week.

570
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,449
We're on something of a clock here.

571
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:40,407
Moira Queen, you have failed this city.
