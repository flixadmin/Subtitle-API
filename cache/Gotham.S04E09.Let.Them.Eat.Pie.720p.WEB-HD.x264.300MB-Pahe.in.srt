1
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:03,604
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:06,640
Taking a life will
lead you down a darker path

3
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:08,376
than you can ever imagine.

4
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:10,311
I know. I've been down it.

5
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,513
I'm not the hero Gotham needs.

6
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:15,483
And it's gonna be a
long, bumpy journey back.

7
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:20,788
You've met Martin, I see.

8
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:22,790
You and I, we're
more than friends.

9
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:24,792
We're conspirators.

10
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:27,428
Got him!

11
00:00:28,296 --> 00:00:30,298
Oh, oh, no.

12
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:35,469
You are relieved
of duty, Harvey Bullock.

13
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:38,139
As of this moment, I'm assuming
the captaincy of Gotham Central.

14
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:40,040
What did you have to do
to get it?

15
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,279
Gotham finds
itself in the hands

16
00:00:45,313 --> 00:00:49,283
of a ritualistic cop killer,
being called Professor Pyg.

17
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:52,620
It doesn't stop until
I've butchered every single

18
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:55,623
swine on Penguin's payroll.

19
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,159
I'm gonna find you.

20
00:00:58,192 --> 00:00:59,293
I hope you do.

21
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:01,061
It's a spectacle.

22
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:06,400
And you're my muse,
Jimmy Gordon.

23
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,838
My poor lost lambs.

24
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:14,442
I come to you today
with an offer for this evening.

25
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:18,612
Fresh biscuits
and a hearty bowl of soup.

26
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:19,880
Wait. Mm.

27
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:23,417
I have place settings for six.

28
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,621
Nobody wants some
fresh pumpkin pie?

29
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:29,423
Smile.

30
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,239
My children,

31
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:47,508
there are two Gothams:

32
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:53,381
The Haves and the Have Nots.

33
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:58,919
I know what it is
to feel like a Have Not.

34
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,521
But...

35
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:03,324
I say, enough.

36
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:08,296
Here's to giving the Haves...

37
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:13,301
...a taste of
what it is like to be...

38
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:16,170
a Have Not.

39
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:37,291
Let's begin.

40
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:39,193
Shall we?

41
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:03,451
I'll be out of your way
in just a second, Captain.

42
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:06,887
Harvey, this isn't how
I wanted things to go down.

43
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,724
And yet, here we are.

44
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:13,727
You know what I was
thinking about today?

45
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:15,629
Our first case.

46
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:18,366
When I told you to walk Penguin
to the end of the pier,

47
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,767
put a bullet in his head,

48
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,336
and dump him in the water,
and you wouldn't.

49
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,471
You thought it was wrong.

50
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:24,872
It was.

51
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,474
Well, maybe if
you would've done it,

52
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,676
Falcone would still be
running things,

53
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,246
and a lot of people who are dead
would be alive today.

54
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,883
If I could go back,
I'd do the same thing.

55
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,285
Because you still
don't understand

56
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:38,619
how this city works, Jim.

57
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,388
You want to be a hero.

58
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:41,622
And Gotham doesn't need heroes.

59
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:45,759
It needs people who will
do what is necessary.

60
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,395
You're wrong.

61
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:50,398
If you show 'em the way,
the people will follow.

62
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:52,232
Guess we'll just have to wait
and see, huh?

63
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,270
When your leave is up,

64
00:03:56,304 --> 00:03:58,606
there'll be a desk here
waiting for you.

65
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,941
Sit around and
watch you all day?

66
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,576
No, thanks.

67
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,586
Right there is perfect.
Thank you.

68
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:18,859
Beautiful.

69
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,830
I predict this evening's
fundraiser will be

70
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,298
a smashing success.

71
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:25,699
If I want Gotham's

72
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,568
wealthiest families
to support the orphanage,

73
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,437
things have to be perfect.

74
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,440
I appreciate you
taking part, Oswald.

75
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:34,475
Yes.

76
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,577
Sadly, a situation has arisen.

77
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,379
No.

78
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,314
That thing in the Narrows,

79
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:41,715
with your former chief of staff?

80
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:44,585
No, no.
This is far more serious.

81
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:48,522
It has to do with Mayor Burke
promoting James Gordon

82
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:50,524
to captain of the GCPD.

83
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:52,460
You're not really worried
about James Gordon?

84
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:53,561
Please.

85
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:58,499
The issue is the person
who ordered his appointment.

86
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,468
I see. Do you?

87
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:04,004
Oswald, we both know
the mayor is a weasel.

88
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,739
Someone must have paid him off.

89
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:09,610
But I don't see why that means
you can't attend my dinner.

90
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,746
Because, my dear,
the mayor has vanished.

91
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,748
But I will find him,

92
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:17,485
I will learn the name
of my enemy,

93
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,787
and there will be a reckoning.

94
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:25,559
And that is why I might not
be able to make it this evening.

95
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:27,561
Very well.

96
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:29,763
But a few of the children
are doing a song.

97
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:31,365
Martin is taking part.

98
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,934
It would mean the world
to him if you could come.

99
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,669
Of course.

100
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:39,873
Now, don't let me keep you.

101
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:51,519
If you think she's the one,
we could have Victor...

102
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:54,388
talk to her?

103
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:58,859
You do realize she is...
literally my only friend.

104
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:02,796
I need the mayor. I need proof.

105
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,567
But, sir, what if Ms. Falcone...
Not to say it is her...

106
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,739
Has seen to it that the mayor
is missing, well, permanently?

107
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:18,979
I could be chasing a ghost while
she prepares her next move.

108
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:22,516
I wish I had a spy,

109
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,885
close to her, someone quiet.

110
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,726
Bring me Martin.

111
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,127
Who?

112
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:36,864
The boy with the pad
around his neck.

113
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,799
The one who can't talk.

114
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:52,746
I thought I was clear.
We're done.

115
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,147
Penguin suspects something.

116
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:55,883
What are you talking about?

117
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,751
He was just here,
saying that he couldn't come

118
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,820
to the party I'm having tonight
for the orphanage.

119
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:02,022
He knows someone paid the mayor
to make you captain.

120
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,625
I think he suspects me.

121
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:05,926
Have you warned the mayor?

122
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,495
I'm not a fool, Jim.

123
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:09,162
I had him leave town
after your appointment.

124
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:11,899
Sounds like you have
your bases covered, as usual.

125
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,901
Thanks for the heads-up
about Penguin.

126
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,169
Don't call me again.

127
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,209
This is Harper.

128
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,711
Gordon, line one.

129
00:07:23,744 --> 00:07:24,945
Says it's private.

130
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,783
Sofia.

131
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:31,919
Wrong. Try again.

132
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,187
You son of a bitch.

133
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,656
Yeah, attaboy, Jim.

134
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,057
Or should I say Captain?

135
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,792
Congratulations, by the way.

136
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:41,795
So, do you remember
when you said

137
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:44,532
the rot in Gotham
went from high to low?

138
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:46,800
You've hit the nail on the head.

139
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:49,803
Police were low.

140
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:54,542
Now it's time for Gotham's elite
to feel the pain.

141
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:57,477
Enter Phase Two.

142
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,682
I won't spoil the reveal.

143
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:06,554
Hurry outside for a little taste
of what's to come.

144
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:07,888
Ciao, mon ami.

145
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:12,125
He's outside. Let's go.

146
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,096
GCPD.

147
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,966
GCPD! Make way.

148
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,768
GCPD. Excuse me. Back up.

149
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,245
Are they dead?
Get forensics here.

150
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,748
And I want this whole area
closed off. No press.

151
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:38,251
That pig's eating that guy.

152
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:45,993
Now, Harper.

153
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,294
Excuse me.

154
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:57,805
Where's breakfast?

155
00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:00,307
Breakfast was produced
and consumed by yours truly

156
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,909
at breakfast time.

157
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:05,946
It is now fast approaching
luncheon, Master Bruce.

158
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,948
Whatever, just give me a coffee.

159
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:12,219
Enjoying the benefits

160
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:14,655
of another night out
on the tiles with Tommy Elliot

161
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,256
and his band of miscreants,
are we?

162
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,160
How absolutely delightful.

163
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,598
I know what you're going
through, you know, Master Bruce.

164
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:25,666
Yeah.

165
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,601
I went out with my friends.

166
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:29,136
I'm hungover.

167
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,071
Doesn't take a genius
to figure it out.

168
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,840
You're lost is what you are.

169
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:35,375
I've seen that
countless times... young men,

170
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,344
going off to war
with a clear purpose,

171
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:40,347
only to return home to a normal
life, unable to assimilate.

172
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,082
Confused, angry.

173
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:44,151
And they make
a complete tosh of it.

174
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,854
I don't really care.

175
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:52,125
You killed Ra's al Ghul.

176
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,227
Vengeance for
your parents' death

177
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,163
has been your driving force
for so long.

178
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,831
You are completely lost
without it.

179
00:09:57,865 --> 00:09:59,032
I need to call Tommy.

180
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,972
Have you forgotten
what day it is today?

181
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:07,007
Give me my phone.
You have, ain't you?

182
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,876
Today is the day
my father took me camping

183
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,978
and we put a rock on
top of Mount Bristol.

184
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:12,112
We did it every year.

185
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,047
Now give me my phone.

186
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:26,727
You are Bruce Wayne,
son of Thomas Wayne.

187
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,762
And the sooner you start
remembering that, the better.

188
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,000
So, you drink your coffee.

189
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:35,836
You go upstairs, you put
your kit on, 'cause you and I...

190
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,906
...are going for a walk.

191
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,148
According to
the medical examiner,

192
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:51,018
both victims had been
living outdoors for some time.

193
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,753
Most likely homeless.

194
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:54,054
Now, see these incisions?

195
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,758
He removed their organs.

196
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,760
Any idea why? Not yet.

197
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:02,763
Pyg all but announced
that his next victims

198
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:06,066
would be the rich and powerful,
the high in Gotham.

199
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:07,901
So why is he killing
the homeless?

200
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:10,303
You're asking for logic
from a psychopath.

201
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,039
From him, yeah.

202
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:14,174
Everything he's done has been
thought through carefully.

203
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,777
There was a card
on the table in French,

204
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,780
said, "Long Live
the Revolution."

205
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,481
Maybe he's using them
to make a statement.

206
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,951
He wants the city's attention.

207
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:26,086
For what?

208
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:29,356
He said this was just
a taste of what's to come.

209
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,224
There's a piece
that's still missing.

210
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,827
The homeless are densest
in the Narrows.

211
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,095
I'm gonna start there.

212
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,964
Hell of a first day
to be captain.

213
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:38,098
Yeah.

214
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:39,767
Call me, you find anything else.

215
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,235
We checked all buildings

216
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,838
in a three-block radius,
Captain. Nothing.

217
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,974
All right, widen it out
a couple of blocks.

218
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:50,510
Focus on buildings with
protected loading docks.

219
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,280
Captain, that was Lucius Fox.

220
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:54,882
Final tox came back.

221
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,516
Both victims had sodium sulfide

222
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,118
and chlorine residue
on their skin.

223
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:01,789
He says it's common in
paper manufacturing.

224
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,991
There's an old paper plant
few blocks from here

225
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:06,526
that closed down a while back.
Let's check that out.

226
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,471
Backup's still incoming.
Should we wait?

227
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:20,040
No.

228
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,376
Over here.

229
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:29,316
What is he doing to them?

230
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,785
Taking their organs.

231
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:41,161
A smoker oven?

232
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,964
He's cooking them.

233
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,125
Harper?

234
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,332
Drop the gun,

235
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:21,334
Captain.

236
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:22,402
Shoot this bastard.

237
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:23,871
Drop it!

238
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:31,611
Thank you.

239
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:36,950
You found me too soon, James.

240
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,385
The table's not yet set,

241
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:42,155
and no meal should be served
before its time.

242
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:43,957
You want a hostage, take me.

243
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:46,159
No, no, no, no, no.
That won't do at all.

244
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:48,561
You must see my final act.

245
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,365
Along with all of Gotham.

246
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,885
Right, well,
it's a lovely day for it.

247
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,853
Best foot forward.

248
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,292
Very distinguished.

249
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,161
Sofia tells me
you're taking part

250
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,430
in a performance this evening.

251
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:28,035
Oh. She's quite a lady,
isn't she?

252
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:29,970
She's been a friend
to both of us.

253
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,206
Or has she?

254
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,376
Martin,

255
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,912
I worry Sofia is only

256
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:41,314
pretending to be my friend.

257
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:43,516
And worse,

258
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,618
I fear she may be using you.

259
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:57,097
Now... I've been
running this over in my mind,

260
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,333
and there are two ways
this might have gone.

261
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:04,337
One, Sofia chose a
specific orphan... you...

262
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,006
To place in my path.

263
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,607
She groomed you.

264
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,542
She told you how to act.

265
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,611
Or...

266
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:15,482
Sofia simply collected
a group of children,

267
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:18,618
hoping one would gain my trust

268
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,521
and make me easier
to manipulate.

269
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:27,560
In this version,
you are innocent.

270
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:35,035
Martin...

271
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:38,371
this is the version
I very badly want to believe.

272
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:41,374
But I need proof.

273
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,110
Of our friendship.

274
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:46,046
I need to know
if my suspicions are correct.

275
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,515
And if so,
what Sofia is planning

276
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,383
and who she is planning it with.

277
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:54,187
I need you to be my
eyes and my ears.

278
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:57,190
Do you think you can do that?

279
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:08,401
Don't let me down, Martin.

280
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:09,602
Please.

281
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,348
I want a city-wide BOLO
on that van.

282
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:25,318
I want every cop in Gotham on
the streets, looking for Harper.

283
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,454
She will not be
the Pyg's next victim.

284
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,588
Go.

285
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,592
Captain Gordon! Captain Gordon!

286
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,464
Is it true that the serial
killer known as the Pyg is back?

287
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,066
That he's responsible
for the scene

288
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,101
outside the GCPD this morning?

289
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:42,369
We believe so, yes.

290
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:43,603
We've also heard he's kidnapped

291
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:45,138
a GCPD detective.

292
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,074
How can you keep the
people of Gotham safe

293
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:48,541
when you can't protect
your own officers?

294
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:53,546
We remain hopeful for
Detective Harper's safe return.

295
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,348
Let me be clear.

296
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:58,618
The GCPD will stop this monster;
That's a promise.

297
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,287
And if you fail, will you be

298
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,089
pushed aside like
Harvey Bullock was?

299
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:04,757
We're done here. Thank you.

300
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:10,397
What about the rumor that the
Pyg is now cooking his victims?

301
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:14,234
Who told you that?

302
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,169
Is it true?

303
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:19,706
As I said, the GCPD will
bring the Pyg to justice.

304
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,374
That's all.

305
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,544
Captain Gordon!

306
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:33,120
Someone leaked to the press that
the Pyg is cooking his victims.

307
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:36,123
Maybe it was the Pyg.

308
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:38,691
We know he wants attention.

309
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:42,862
Look, Jim, everyone in
the department is on your side.

310
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,664
Yeah.

311
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,301
There's something
you need to see.

312
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:55,142
"I grant this food
will be somewhat dear,

313
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:58,411
"and therefore very proper
for landlords, who,

314
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:02,415
"as they have already
devoured most of the parents,

315
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:06,553
seem to have the best title
to the children."

316
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,888
It's Jonathan Swift,
"A Modest Proposal."

317
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,423
He made an argument

318
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:13,426
for cannibalism,
about the rich eating the poor.

319
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,862
The poor are the homeless.

320
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:16,929
Who are the rich?

321
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,834
Swift didn't just talk about
the rich eating the poor.

322
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:25,438
He specifically
mentioned the orphans.

323
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:27,440
I know where he's going.

324
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,442
He left this for me.

325
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:32,745
He's doing exactly what he did
with Harvey. It could be a trap.

326
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,781
And I won't lead more officers
to their deaths.

327
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:35,848
You're going alone?

328
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,650
I'm sorry, Lucius.

329
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:42,455
Where's Chef Louis?

330
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:46,259
Ici, mademoiselle.

331
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:52,399
Such a pleasure
to meet you in person.

332
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,934
Hmm. I was
expecting you earlier.

333
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,238
Apologies.
I was detained.

334
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:00,440
But I've made a small change

335
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,641
in the menu.

336
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:04,444
I have steered us
away from haute cuisine

337
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:08,515
to something
a bit more... mundane.

338
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:10,149
Et voilà.

339
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:21,594
I am calling them
Gotham Meat Pies.

340
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:25,565
Your guests will die for them.

341
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:34,341
I've made us a delicious
brown English stew

342
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:37,810
with herb dumplings,
Master Bruce.

343
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:41,748
Your father used to love it
when I made stew.

344
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:45,718
Did I ever tell you
how I met your old man?

345
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:50,623
In London. He was doing
postgrad work there.

346
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:52,592
He told me.

347
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:57,964
Yeah, but no details.

348
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:00,833
Well, I was just out
the army, two months.

349
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,702
Don't remember any of it.

350
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:06,706
All a bit of a blur, really...
Booze, drugs, brawling.

351
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:08,941
A sucking great black cloud.

352
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,980
One day, I wake up and
I'm lying in this alley,

353
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:16,849
and I'm covered in
blood... don't know how.

354
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:17,950
So I picked myself up,

355
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:20,320
I took myself straight down
to the police station,

356
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:21,854
turned myself in,
hoping that they would

357
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,857
chuck me into the big house
and throw away the key.

358
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,727
And they told me to shut up,
sit down and wait.

359
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,396
And there was this

360
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:31,798
really annoying Yank
wandering about,

361
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,666
dressed like he was
ready for a game of tennis,

362
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,001
and it was your dad.

363
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:38,738
Anyway, he bowls up to me,
asks me what I done.

364
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,340
Asking me questions.

365
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:41,874
Eventually, you know,
I found myself

366
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:46,012
telling him stuff that I was too
frightened even to think about.

367
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:48,748
But I guess it'd
just been building.

368
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:50,950
Anyway, that point, the desk
sergeant called him over,

369
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,420
and your dad turned
around to me and he said,

370
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:57,424
"Alfred, last night, I was
being attacked in that alley,

371
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:58,825
"and you started
fighting this geezer.

372
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:01,761
I headed on my toes,
and I ran away."

373
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,763
And I said, "Yeah, but
that's not what happened,

374
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,031
is it, Thomas?"

375
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:08,701
And he says, "It is now."

376
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:13,306
Your father saved my life.

377
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:19,446
His friendship saved me.

378
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:21,948
You see, I know what it's
all like, being lonely.

379
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:25,318
Hoping that the world
will punish you.

380
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:29,556
I can help you.

381
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:34,594
Bruce...

382
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,963
Alfred, I hear you.

383
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:39,499
I just don't want to talk
about this right now.

384
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:44,504
All right.

385
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:46,473
Well, this looks lovely.

386
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:50,743
The rocks are gone.

387
00:21:50,777 --> 00:21:52,712
They must've
fell out in the car.

388
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:55,682
Oh, the keys are in
the bag, just there.

389
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:25,945
Beautiful.
So nice to see you, dear.

390
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:27,647
Thanks. Yes.

391
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,520
Oswald, you came!

392
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:35,488
Look at you two.

393
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:36,889
So handsome.

394
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:39,492
I know how important
tonight's party is to you.

395
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:42,094
And I wouldn't have
forgiven myself

396
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:44,163
if I missed Martin's
performance.

397
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,833
Why don't you go find
the other children.

398
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,972
Did you locate the mayor?

399
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:55,708
Unfortunately, no.

400
00:22:55,742 --> 00:22:56,976
Hmm.

401
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:59,078
But I have not given up hope.

402
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,847
Well, I, for one, am happy.

403
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,049
This way, you get to
come to my dinner.

404
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:04,917
I need to go check on the chef.

405
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:06,919
He seems a bit odd.

406
00:23:06,953 --> 00:23:08,855
Please try and enjoy yourself.

407
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,832
Let's go. Straight ahead,
down to the left.

408
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:50,563
Hello, Martin.

409
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,899
What are you writing?

410
00:23:58,037 --> 00:23:59,639
Don't make a noise.

411
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:01,874
Shh.

412
00:24:01,908 --> 00:24:04,010
I'm a cop.

413
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:05,478
Who are you?

414
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:07,480
A-A waiter.

415
00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:10,483
I'm looking for a man,
Caucasian, about five-foot-ten.

416
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:12,652
He would've brought the food.
Maybe the chef.

417
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,687
Uh, the chef's in the kitchen.

418
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:16,489
Look, I just got hired tonight.

419
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:18,090
Whatever the dude's into, I
have no idea. I'm just here...

420
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:19,759
You're okay, you're okay.

421
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,928
Do me a favor, find
Ms. Falcone, bring her to me.

422
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:25,064
Can you do that for me?
Yeah. All right.

423
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:28,067
What's that in your jacket?

424
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:39,045
Jim Gordon really is
an impressive policeman.

425
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:40,713
Is he alone?

426
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:42,114
Seems so.

427
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:45,518
But, man, whatever
it is you're into,

428
00:24:45,552 --> 00:24:46,953
my partner and I?

429
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,721
Our rates just doubled.

430
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:12,745
Harper.

431
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:14,747
My friends,
the Falcone orphanage

432
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:17,550
is the realization
of a long cherished dream,

433
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:21,821
and one that would not have been
possible without your support.

434
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,591
- So thank you. Cheers.
- Cheers.

435
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:26,693
Now, if you could please take
your seats in the next room,

436
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:28,961
a few of the children
have prepared a song.

437
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,765
Where's Martin?

438
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,601
I wanted to wish him luck.

439
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:36,302
Ah. Off getting ready, no doubt.

440
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,840
Oswald, I've been thinking.

441
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,175
Maybe things happen
for a reason.

442
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,177
Licensing crime was a bold move,

443
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,580
but it would've destroyed you.

444
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:50,850
Whoever had Jim Gordon
appointed captain

445
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,919
may actually have saved you.

446
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:57,189
By attempting to destroy
everything I ever created?

447
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,058
Oswald... Enough.

448
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:02,194
If you're going to confess,
confess.

449
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,330
And face the consequences.

450
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:08,901
So sorry to interrupt.

451
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,272
The servers are
getting everyone seated.

452
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:16,142
We don't want the food
to get cold.

453
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:19,612
Shall we go in to dinner?

454
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:21,213
Chop, chop.

455
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,659
All right.
I stopped the bleeding, I think.

456
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:36,929
That's the best I can do
until I can get you out of here.

457
00:26:36,963 --> 00:26:38,364
Got to get that door open.

458
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:40,733
Gordon. Maybe I can
get the hinges off.

459
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,735
Gordon.

460
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,270
Idiots forgot to search me.

461
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,224
Was this another
one of your plans?

462
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:06,759
No.

463
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:12,431
Ladies and gentlemen,
as you by now have surmised,

464
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,702
there's been a change
in the program.

465
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:19,305
Tonight, we are proud to present

466
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:22,875
the six merry Gothamites
of Squatter's Row,

467
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:24,844
and Martin,

468
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:27,847
from the Falcone
Home and School for Orphans,

469
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,249
in our rendition of...

470
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:35,121
the "Meat Pie Tango."

471
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:13,492
Enough! Where are
the other children?

472
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,194
If you hurt them, I swear...

473
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:20,767
Rude.

474
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,068
I'm not finished.

475
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:24,070
Sit down.

476
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:28,775
Pull it out,
and the next one's in her eye.

477
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:29,809
Oswald, no.

478
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:38,050
Now, to answer your
question, my dear,

479
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:39,852
the other children
and your staff

480
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:42,321
are safely locked
in the kitchen.

481
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:45,792
Despite appearances,
I'm not an animal.

482
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:49,461
Martin.

483
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:50,997
May we continue?

484
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:58,070
You have all fed upon
the poor of Gotham for years.

485
00:28:58,104 --> 00:29:01,473
Now you're going to know
what they taste like.

486
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:06,112
Please, open your envelopes and
look at the photographs inside.

487
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:09,415
Oh, come on.

488
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:10,783
Open them!

489
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:21,894
Who is Trish?

490
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:24,864
Well, I thought you should
see who you're eating.

491
00:29:26,232 --> 00:29:28,534
Bob, Fricks,

492
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:31,137
Trish, Nunuh, Cyrano and Vincent

493
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:34,273
all deserve our gratitude.

494
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:36,575
So these pies are...

495
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,310
People. Yep.

496
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:39,912
They're people pies.

497
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:42,414
People.

498
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:45,084
And you're all
going to eat them.

499
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,285
Oh, no.

500
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:50,356
Absolutely not.

501
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:52,324
Okay.

502
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:58,030
Let's try this again.

503
00:29:58,064 --> 00:29:59,365
No!

504
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:02,301
Eat, or I kill the boy.

505
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:04,403
But he's just an orphan.

506
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:08,574
What did you say?

507
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:10,342
Well, these are made of people.

508
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:12,912
For God's sake,
you can't expect us...

509
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:13,612
I mean,

510
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,381
so they kill some urchin, hmm?

511
00:30:22,121 --> 00:30:24,090
What a waste of a good pie.

512
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:27,593
But I do applaud the sentiment.

513
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:29,929
Especially as you,
Mr. Cobblepot,

514
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:31,463
are the reason I'm here.

515
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:34,133
Me? Why?

516
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:38,004
Oh, I could've chosen any
gathering of wealthy Gothamites

517
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:39,872
who've gotten fat upon the poor.

518
00:30:39,906 --> 00:30:41,073
But you,

519
00:30:41,107 --> 00:30:43,509
with your Pax Penguina,

520
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:45,544
you are the biggest
glutton of them all.

521
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:49,081
You have gorged yourself
on this city's heart,

522
00:30:49,115 --> 00:30:52,084
its lungs, its liver.

523
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:54,086
Why should today
be any different?

524
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,422
Now eat, little Penguin.

525
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:58,124
Eat.

526
00:30:58,157 --> 00:31:00,459
Eat the pies, or the boy dies.

527
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:29,655
If you don't eat,

528
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:33,592
I will hunt you down
and kill you all!

529
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:42,234
Now, that's what I like to see.

530
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:55,381
And as Mother
always used to say,

531
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:59,118
"Nobody leaves until
every plate is clean."

532
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:03,255
It's a compliment to the chef,
and I love compliments.

533
00:32:04,991 --> 00:32:06,292
And, Ms. Falcone...

534
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:13,365
...mangia, signorina.

535
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:17,536
Only if you don't hurt him.

536
00:32:31,017 --> 00:32:32,985
Can you help me?

537
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:41,160
Yes.

538
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:10,389
No!

539
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:12,658
He'll kill the kid!

540
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:15,061
Get off of me!

541
00:33:15,094 --> 00:33:16,362
Martin!

542
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:19,198
Jim!

543
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:32,478
Get out of here!

544
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,680
Go!

545
00:34:16,322 --> 00:34:18,357
Come on, Jim.

546
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,526
Don't give up.
You'll ruin everything.

547
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:36,542
Should be good.

548
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:46,418
How is your hand?

549
00:34:46,452 --> 00:34:48,120
I'll be fine.

550
00:34:48,154 --> 00:34:49,388
How's Martin?

551
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,557
He is stronger than he looks.

552
00:34:56,295 --> 00:34:58,630
You paid off the mayor
to make Jim Gordon captain.

553
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:01,867
Yes.

554
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:05,437
And you want me to believe

555
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:07,306
that you did this
out of friendship.

556
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:12,144
To save me.

557
00:35:12,178 --> 00:35:14,446
I tried to talk you
out of the license program.

558
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,548
You wouldn't listen.

559
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:18,850
There seemed no other way.

560
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:24,290
Of course,
it's equally plausible

561
00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:26,825
that you are my enemy,

562
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,361
intent upon my destruction.

563
00:35:31,197 --> 00:35:33,165
You could choose
to see it that way.

564
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,201
Choice is yours, Oswald.

565
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:39,238
Well, whatever
your actual reasoning...

566
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:43,509
...you went behind my back.

567
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,379
I would be justified
in killing you.

568
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:57,556
But what you were
going to do for Martin...

569
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:02,428
...that was real.

570
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,867
Don't ever betray me again.

571
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,669
Never.

572
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:15,874
I will abandon the licenses,

573
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:18,477
but Jim Gordon
cannot be captain.

574
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,479
Pick someone else, then.

575
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,549
Gordon's less than nothing
to me.

576
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:45,937
♪♪ Bye-bye, Piggy, bye-bye... ♪♪

577
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:48,340
Captain Gordon!

578
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:49,808
Captain Gordon! Captain Gordon!

579
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:50,809
Captain Gordon?

580
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:56,615
Is that the Pyg?
Did you really catch him?

581
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:59,418
The suspect known as
the Pyg is in custody.

582
00:36:59,451 --> 00:37:02,688
Detective Vanessa Harper is
on her way to Gotham General,

583
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:06,292
and is expected to make
a full recovery.

584
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:09,227
The GCPD kept its promise.

585
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:13,699
Captain Gordon?

586
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:15,567
Yes?

587
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:17,569
Thank you.

588
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:19,004
Thank you.

589
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:48,500
Oh.

590
00:37:52,538 --> 00:37:53,939
Hey, hey, Alfred!

591
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:58,043
How was your walk?

592
00:37:58,076 --> 00:38:00,412
Everybody out now.

593
00:38:00,446 --> 00:38:03,349
Nobody move.

594
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:05,617
This is not your house.

595
00:38:05,651 --> 00:38:07,819
If I want my friends to stay,
they're staying.

596
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:13,759
Like hell they are.

597
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,495
Dude, your butler is
a little out of line.

598
00:38:16,528 --> 00:38:18,497
Have you been hitting

599
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,765
the sherry, Jeeves?

600
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,900
You have no idea
what extreme danger

601
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:23,369
you are now in, son.

602
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:26,037
If I was you, I would walk away.

603
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:28,840
Yeah, whatever.

604
00:38:28,874 --> 00:38:30,909
Meet us at the club.

605
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:32,578
Come on.

606
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:34,045
Driver will take us.

607
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:46,324
Well...

608
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:51,530
...you've certainly shown
a new side of yourself today,

609
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:53,532
haven't you, Master Bruce?
Save it, Alfred.

610
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:56,735
You tell me a story
about you and my dad,

611
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,737
and I'm supposed to get
all weepy?

612
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:03,509
You don't know
what I'm going through.

613
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:07,413
You and I are nothing alike.

614
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:10,882
Then talk to me.

615
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:13,619
Let me know
h-how I can help you.

616
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:15,987
You can't.

617
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:19,124
Like you said, I did what I did.

618
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:22,461
I killed Ra's.

619
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:24,930
I avenged my parents' death,
and guess what.

620
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,934
Nothing changed.

621
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,740
It made no difference.

622
00:39:34,773 --> 00:39:36,975
So then what did I do it for?

623
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,882
How can you help that?

624
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:46,818
I can help with the way
that you're feeling.

625
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,122
But you need to talk to me.

626
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:55,494
You have to face up
to who you really are.

627
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:57,095
Stop telling me who I am.

628
00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:00,699
I know who I am.

629
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:05,637
And if you really
want to help me,

630
00:40:05,671 --> 00:40:07,906
you can stop trying
to be my father,

631
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:10,642
and you can be my butler.

632
00:40:10,676 --> 00:40:12,544
Clean this place up.

633
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,181
Tommy!

634
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:41,139
You're the hero of the day.

635
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,808
I was just doing my job.

636
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:45,010
I know you hate me

637
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:47,546
for what I did,
but you deserve to be captain.

638
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,014
I went to your father for help.

639
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:51,149
I knew what I was getting into.

640
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:53,151
Doesn't mean I have to like it.

641
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,153
But you accept it.

642
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:00,559
Because I do deserve it.

643
00:41:00,592 --> 00:41:03,729
Just like Gotham deserves
law and order.

644
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:06,164
And I'm gonna make sure
it gets it.

645
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:10,035
You don't think
I want that, too?

646
00:41:12,738 --> 00:41:14,172
I'm not your enemy, Jim.

647
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,608
I never will be.

648
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,212
Did you find anything out?

649
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:01,587
"I saw Sofia

650
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,822
kissing the policeman."

651
00:42:08,694 --> 00:42:09,995
Is this true?

652
00:42:39,124 --> 00:42:41,627
Martin, you are a good friend.

653
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:49,968
As for Sofia...

654
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:52,771
she will answer
for what she's done.

655
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,174
I swear it.
