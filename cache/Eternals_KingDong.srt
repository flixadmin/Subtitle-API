1
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:48,277
It is time.

2
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,690
It's beautiful, isn't it?

3
00:02:26,665 --> 00:02:28,248
I'm Ikaris.

4
00:02:29,288 --> 00:02:30,624
I'm Sersi.

5
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,140
Thank you, Ajak.

6
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,995
Shit.

7
00:07:37,636 --> 00:07:39,926
Excuse me. Excuse me.

8
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,885
I know I'm late, Charlie.

9
00:08:06,184 --> 00:08:08,216
"In this broad Earth of ours,

10
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:11,700
"Amid the measureless grossness 
and the slag,

11
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:15,098
"Enclosed and safe
 within its central heart,

12
00:08:15,123 --> 00:08:17,708
"Nestles the seed Perfection."

13
00:08:18,425 --> 00:08:21,494
The poet's hope and optimism
in humanity

14
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:26,234
echoes our recent universal victory,
the return of half our population...

15
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:27,682
And, thank God, there she is.

16
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,032
Our brilliant museum scientist, Miss Sersi,

17
00:08:31,057 --> 00:08:32,198
the person who will be

18
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,891
and was always supposed to be
giving you your presentation today.

19
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,170
Thank you, Mr. Whitman.

20
00:08:37,194 --> 00:08:38,775
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

21
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,787
Today, we'll be learning about
the importance of apex predators

22
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:43,621
in a balanced ecosystem.

23
00:08:45,253 --> 00:08:46,254
Poetry?

24
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:49,765
I completely ran out of things to say,
and these kids make me nervous.

25
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:52,169
Well, I thought 
you were very charming, Professor.

26
00:08:52,785 --> 00:08:53,970
See you tonight.

27
00:08:53,995 --> 00:08:55,908
Ooh! "See you tonight."

28
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:58,463
All right, settle down.

29
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:04,752
So... who can tell me
what an apex predator is?

30
00:09:05,214 --> 00:09:07,066
Animals that hunt their prey for food.

31
00:09:07,091 --> 00:09:08,259
Very good.

32
00:09:08,284 --> 00:09:12,096
Apex predators do hunt their prey
for food, like all predators.

33
00:09:12,213 --> 00:09:14,240
But one thing that sets them apart

34
00:09:14,265 --> 00:09:18,760
is that there are no other animals in
their habitat strong enough to hunt them.

35
00:09:20,146 --> 00:09:21,623
Who can give me an example?

36
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:22,790
Lions.

37
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:24,479
- Wolves.
- Correct.

38
00:09:27,195 --> 00:09:28,404
Earthquake.

39
00:09:32,992 --> 00:09:35,662
It's an earthquake, everyone.
Get down! Under the tables!

40
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,119
Let me help you. 
Don't worry, it'll pass soon.

41
00:09:48,049 --> 00:09:49,967
It's all right. Come here.

42
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,002
You're all right. You're all right.

43
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,472
I like this song.

44
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:39,759
Me, too.

45
00:10:40,935 --> 00:10:42,415
Do you wanna dance?

46
00:10:43,229 --> 00:10:44,501
Wait, what the hell?

47
00:10:45,356 --> 00:10:46,610
Your hand!

48
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:49,227
You've had too much to drink.

49
00:10:49,841 --> 00:10:51,153
I gotta go.

50
00:10:56,284 --> 00:11:00,706
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

51
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:05,876
♪ Happy birthday, dear Dane ♪

52
00:11:06,043 --> 00:11:10,006
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

53
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,131
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

54
00:11:19,265 --> 00:11:20,767
Is this from the Middle Ages?

55
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:22,162
It has your family crest.

56
00:11:22,272 --> 00:11:24,524
It must have cost a fortune.

57
00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:26,665
I'm a good eBay bidder.

58
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,866
Thank you.

59
00:11:28,357 --> 00:11:29,694
Happy birthday.

60
00:11:33,284 --> 00:11:37,756
So, have you given any more thought
to us moving in together?

61
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,108
Yeah, I... I thought about it.

62
00:11:41,412 --> 00:11:43,556
I can't move in with you.

63
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:45,455
Yeah. Mm-hmm. Thought you'd say that.

64
00:11:45,477 --> 00:11:46,553
I'm sorry.

65
00:11:46,578 --> 00:11:49,077
And I think I know why.

66
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:52,465
Are you a wizard?

67
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:54,045
What?

68
00:11:54,318 --> 00:11:56,111
Yeah, like Doctor Strange.

69
00:11:56,136 --> 00:11:57,280
No. I'm...

70
00:11:57,305 --> 00:11:59,741
I've noticed some unusual things happen
when I'm around you.

71
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:02,858
Like our water always turns to coffee
whenever the waiter ignores us.

72
00:12:02,883 --> 00:12:04,162
That's your caffeine addiction talking.

73
00:12:04,187 --> 00:12:06,202
And Sprite says things...

74
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:09,993
...like you and your ex-boyfriend
broke up a century ago.

75
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:11,917
She said that?

76
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:13,152
And he can fly.

77
00:12:13,473 --> 00:12:15,057
He's a pilot.

78
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:17,975
Get a room, you two.

79
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,461
Can we go now? It's past my bedtime.

80
00:12:24,696 --> 00:12:26,740
Are you really in love?

81
00:12:27,056 --> 00:12:28,428
What if I am?

82
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:30,631
You better tell him the truth, then.

83
00:12:30,732 --> 00:12:32,358
I'm working on it.

84
00:12:44,133 --> 00:12:45,635
You guys wanna get pizza?

85
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,911
No, thank you!

86
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,045
He won't live forever, you know.

87
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,202
Move in with him.

88
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,295
I live with you.

89
00:12:56,411 --> 00:12:57,538
Dane.

90
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:02,243
Shit! Is that a Deviant?

91
00:13:02,268 --> 00:13:03,975
Dane, run!

92
00:13:15,506 --> 00:13:16,803
- Sersi?
- Let's go.

93
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:20,459
- What is that thing?
- A Deviant!

94
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,406
- You said you killed them all!
- You told him that?

95
00:13:23,431 --> 00:13:25,015
- You believed me?
- I do now!

96
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:33,234
What are you doing?

97
00:13:33,363 --> 00:13:34,626
Keep Dane safe!

98
00:13:34,651 --> 00:13:36,426
Sersi, wait! What?

99
00:13:44,962 --> 00:13:46,262
You're fine, dude.

100
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,506
Sprite!

101
00:13:52,556 --> 00:13:54,269
No. Stairs.

102
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,019
Run! Go! Go!

103
00:14:34,394 --> 00:14:35,771
- Go!
- Come on!

104
00:14:43,312 --> 00:14:44,946
It knows where we are!

105
00:14:45,215 --> 00:14:46,129
How?

106
00:14:46,154 --> 00:14:47,582
I don't know!

107
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:50,410
Sprite!

108
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,285
Sprite!

109
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,545
Ikaris!

110
00:15:19,116 --> 00:15:20,577
Evening, ladies.

111
00:15:22,403 --> 00:15:23,363
Watch out!

112
00:15:39,561 --> 00:15:40,854
Wizard.

113
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:45,696
Sorry.

114
00:16:07,057 --> 00:16:08,769
Did it just heal itself?

115
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:29,429
Ikaris.

116
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,587
It's good to see you.

117
00:16:33,473 --> 00:16:35,307
It's good to see you, too, Sprite.

118
00:16:41,645 --> 00:16:43,087
I'm Dane.

119
00:16:43,444 --> 00:16:44,861
Hello, Dane.

120
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,603
Well, I guess you must be the pilot.

121
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:04,377
We're Eternals,
from a planet called Olympia.

122
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:09,530
We came here 7,000 years ago on the Domo,
our starship,

123
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,760
to protect humans from the Deviants.

124
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:16,956
We thought we killed them all 
five centuries ago, but now they're back.

125
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,625
Look, if you don't want to move in with me,
you could just say.

126
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,068
Dane, this is serious.

127
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:26,256
Oh, I know. I'm just still getting
over the fact you're not a wizard.

128
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,494
I was hoping 
you could change me into a giraffe.

129
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,235
I always wanted to be a giraffe 
when I was a kid.

130
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,554
It's too bad 
I can't change sentient beings.

131
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:34,049
You would have made
a very cute giraffe.

132
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,223
Why didn't you guys help fight Thanos?

133
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:44,428
Or any war? Or all the other
terrible things throughout history?

134
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:47,403
We were instructed
not to interfere in any human conflicts

135
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:48,744
unless Deviants were involved.

136
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:49,978
Why?

137
00:17:50,214 --> 00:17:55,369
If we'd protected humanity from everything
for 7,000 years,

138
00:17:55,394 --> 00:17:59,556
you'd never have had the chance to
develop in the way you were meant to.

139
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:03,795
But if the Deviants were
eradicated a long time ago,

140
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,396
why are you still here?

141
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,776
We've been waiting,
to be told we can go home.

142
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,119
So...

143
00:18:12,785 --> 00:18:14,151
Ikaris.

144
00:18:14,688 --> 00:18:16,901
The boy who flew too close to the sun.

145
00:18:17,293 --> 00:18:19,721
Sprite made that story up
when we lived in Athens.

146
00:18:19,746 --> 00:18:22,205
In the fifth century BC?

147
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,893
How long were you two together?

148
00:18:23,918 --> 00:18:24,961
5,000 years.

149
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:28,739
I guess you can call that long-term.

150
00:18:29,977 --> 00:18:31,311
What happened?

151
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,979
He left.

152
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:39,260
I always thought he'd come back, but...
he never did.

153
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:41,885
So, I moved on.

154
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,463
I'm glad you did.

155
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,461
I'm sorry.

156
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,267
I have to go.

157
00:18:57,483 --> 00:18:58,655
This morning,

158
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,319
an unprecedented global earthquake
swept nation-states across the world,

159
00:19:02,344 --> 00:19:04,205
causing damage and panic.

160
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,922
Many have speculated
its connection with the Blip.

161
00:19:07,274 --> 00:19:09,235
The UN has called
for an emergency meeting...

162
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,387
That Deviant healed itself.

163
00:19:12,396 --> 00:19:14,440
They could never do that before.

164
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,694
And it was coming after us
instead of humans.

165
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:19,888
What's going on?

166
00:19:19,913 --> 00:19:22,766
I came to check on you
because of the earthquake.

167
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,586
That Deviant is news to me.

168
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,601
Something's happening to Earth.

169
00:19:30,715 --> 00:19:32,509
Can't be a coincidence.

170
00:19:34,229 --> 00:19:35,981
We need to find the others.

171
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,740
I haven't seen some of them for centuries.

172
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:40,586
I doubt much has changed.

173
00:19:50,699 --> 00:19:53,169
I'm sorry I hurt you, Sersi.

174
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:00,938
But we need to stick together.

175
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,701
And once I know you're safe,
I'll leave you alone.

176
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:07,849
Let's go to Ajak first.

177
00:20:08,803 --> 00:20:10,576
She'll know what to do.

178
00:20:14,532 --> 00:20:16,154
You hear that, Sprite?

179
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:18,826
Family reunion.

180
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,623
It's about time.

181
00:20:32,986 --> 00:20:34,248
Hey, that one was mine!

182
00:20:34,273 --> 00:20:35,537
Oh, never mind.

183
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:11,716
Ajak.

184
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:13,826
Arishem.

185
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:17,873
We continue to keep Babylon safe 
from the Deviants.

186
00:22:17,898 --> 00:22:23,528
More people have come to seek refuge.
It is now the largest city on Earth.

187
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:28,640
The Eternals serving their missions across
the galaxies will learn from your success.

188
00:22:28,665 --> 00:22:29,904
Thank you.

189
00:22:32,855 --> 00:22:36,067
I respect your grand design, Arishem.

190
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:40,732
But I have noticed something special 
about this planet.

191
00:22:43,133 --> 00:22:46,427
And I fear that maybe this time
the cost may-

192
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:49,305
Do not become attached to this planet.

193
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:53,302
You must focus on 
the true purpose of your mission.

194
00:22:54,584 --> 00:22:56,087
I understand.

195
00:22:57,241 --> 00:22:59,077
I will not let you down.

196
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:25,049
Phastos.

197
00:23:25,074 --> 00:23:27,994
Did you go to the party last night 
like I told you to?

198
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:29,303
The party, yeah.

199
00:23:29,328 --> 00:23:30,990
He worked all night.

200
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,371
Who was talking to you?

201
00:23:32,415 --> 00:23:33,599
Get a life.

202
00:23:33,764 --> 00:23:35,893
- And where is Sersi?
- Late as usual.

203
00:23:35,918 --> 00:23:38,982
I'm sorry, but I have something
very exciting to show you, okay?

204
00:23:39,922 --> 00:23:41,758
Wait till you see this.

205
00:23:45,552 --> 00:23:46,696
What is it?

206
00:23:46,721 --> 00:23:48,264
It's an engine.

207
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:51,617
It moves steam from high pressure 
to low pressure.

208
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:55,018
Uh, it'll help them till their fields
at an incredibly fast rate.

209
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,520
It's gonna freak them out.

210
00:23:56,545 --> 00:23:59,341
I mean, they only have had
the wheel 1,000 years, so...

211
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:04,287
You know, we could do that thing
where you use your mind to control them

212
00:24:04,312 --> 00:24:05,531
and then they could do it quicker.

213
00:24:05,556 --> 00:24:07,029
Ajak, you listening to this?

214
00:24:07,054 --> 00:24:09,890
Phastos, this steam...

215
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,044
- Engine. It's a steam engine.
- It's too soon.

216
00:24:12,705 --> 00:24:13,880
And there she is.

217
00:24:14,123 --> 00:24:15,582
What did I miss?

218
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:19,955
Nothing. Just the screams
of my deep disappointment.

219
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,915
I am sure you have something simpler.

220
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,982
Simple.

221
00:24:23,007 --> 00:24:25,740
Okay, let's see. Uh...

222
00:24:25,927 --> 00:24:28,888
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you...

223
00:24:30,223 --> 00:24:31,557
...the plow.

224
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:34,519
'Cause that's what it does.

225
00:24:34,827 --> 00:24:36,120
Plows dirt.

226
00:24:36,145 --> 00:24:37,480
I met another group of settlers

227
00:24:37,505 --> 00:24:39,591
who are building their homes
in the northern fields.

228
00:24:39,616 --> 00:24:40,993
They'll need to plant their own crops.

229
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:42,441
Thanks, Sersi.

230
00:24:42,464 --> 00:24:47,281
Listen, humanity may be coming along 
slower than some of us want.

231
00:24:48,037 --> 00:24:52,654
But there is no telling what wonders
they will discover as they advance.

232
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,252
I just saw that.

233
00:25:24,277 --> 00:25:26,154
There's so many other chairs, man.

234
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,488
You know, I could use my powers...

235
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:29,255
Come and have a drink with me.

236
00:25:29,699 --> 00:25:30,842
No.

237
00:25:30,867 --> 00:25:32,618
I can't let you go and fight Deviants 
on your own.

238
00:25:32,643 --> 00:25:34,692
- We need to guard the city.
- Get out of my way.

239
00:25:35,658 --> 00:25:38,747
I didn't come to this planet
to cower behind walls.

240
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:42,325
We need to trust Arishem's design 
for this planet.

241
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:44,970
Hmm.

242
00:25:44,994 --> 00:25:45,950
Thena.

243
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:50,520
It's an honor to fight alongside you.

244
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,402
And you.

245
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,911
My beautiful Makkari.

246
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,419
You're late.

247
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:59,141
Well, she also says
that stealing is very, very bad.

248
00:27:06,254 --> 00:27:07,338
Deal.

249
00:27:18,849 --> 00:27:21,922
I promise I won't let my feelings for Sersi
distract me from my mission.

250
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:25,231
Humans are far from being able
to protect themselves from the Deviants.

251
00:27:25,773 --> 00:27:27,469
We still have much to do.

252
00:27:28,945 --> 00:27:31,008
Your faith in Arishem is strong.

253
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,072
I can feel it.

254
00:27:34,871 --> 00:27:37,593
But you are allowed to live a life, 
you know?

255
00:27:37,742 --> 00:27:40,266
Go tell Sersi how you feel.

256
00:28:06,347 --> 00:28:07,557
Try.

257
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,400
Sorry. I'm making a mess.

258
00:28:14,656 --> 00:28:16,073
Well, not bad.

259
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:51,455
It matches your eyes.

260
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:56,279
You're learning their language now?

261
00:28:56,304 --> 00:29:00,099
If I want to spend more time with you,
I need to get to know them.

262
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:08,162
Wait, what did I say?

263
00:29:08,187 --> 00:29:11,271
You said, "I am very beautiful."

264
00:29:14,449 --> 00:29:15,493
You...

265
00:29:18,168 --> 00:29:20,576
You are very beautiful, Sersi.

266
00:29:32,895 --> 00:29:34,584
I'm yours, Sersi,

267
00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:36,904
if you'll have me.

268
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,144
I love you, Ikaris.

269
00:30:25,997 --> 00:30:27,722
I love you, Sersi.

270
00:31:34,937 --> 00:31:36,230
Hello?

271
00:31:39,906 --> 00:31:41,191
Ajak?

272
00:32:05,832 --> 00:32:07,370
Ajak!

273
00:32:33,566 --> 00:32:35,233
It was a Deviant.

274
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:01,354
It was the last time I saw her.

275
00:33:03,055 --> 00:33:07,406
Ajak asked me to check on Sersi,
so I went to London.

276
00:33:09,675 --> 00:33:12,862
Turned out, both of us were lonely
and we needed each other.

277
00:33:14,831 --> 00:33:17,011
I guess, in her way,

278
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,807
Ajak never stopped trying 
to take care of us.

279
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,757
Bye, Ajak.

280
00:33:34,432 --> 00:33:37,120
It's the first time in 7,000 years
one of us has died.

281
00:33:37,607 --> 00:33:40,150
I think the Deviant
that attacked us in London

282
00:33:40,175 --> 00:33:42,034
killed Ajak and absorbed her power.

283
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:43,964
Deviants have never done that in the past.

284
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:46,104
It healed itself just like Ajak.

285
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:49,159
I swear, I almost heard it speak.

286
00:34:16,175 --> 00:34:17,082
Arishem.

287
00:34:17,106 --> 00:34:20,063
Sersi. It is almost time.

288
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,274
Sersi! Sersi! Are you okay?

289
00:34:24,515 --> 00:34:26,055
What happened, Sersi?

290
00:34:29,438 --> 00:34:32,008
The sphere that Ajak used
to talk with Arishem,

291
00:34:32,033 --> 00:34:34,535
it came out of her body
and went inside me.

292
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,297
Did you talk with Arishem?

293
00:34:36,835 --> 00:34:38,462
Yes. He said...

294
00:34:39,248 --> 00:34:40,938
...it's almost time.

295
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:43,969
Can you try talking to him again?

296
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,155
I don't know how.

297
00:34:46,415 --> 00:34:48,375
But she chose you to replace her.

298
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,257
And she gave you the sphere.

299
00:34:50,284 --> 00:34:51,368
Hold on, Sprite.

300
00:34:53,048 --> 00:34:54,766
Are you sure you talked with Arishem?

301
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,084
What else would it be?

302
00:34:57,294 --> 00:34:58,545
Mahd Wy'ry.

303
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,500
Where are the others?

304
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,767
There were more Deviants than you said.

305
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:43,563
Well, I'm sure 
that was a lot of fun for you.

306
00:35:43,588 --> 00:35:44,798
It was.

307
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,031
Once the others kill these last Deviants,

308
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:51,953
we will have eliminated them all 
from the planet.

309
00:36:10,141 --> 00:36:11,477
Don't.

310
00:36:12,821 --> 00:36:15,102
We don't interfere in their wars.

311
00:36:16,548 --> 00:36:18,092
This isn't war.

312
00:36:18,117 --> 00:36:19,661
It's genocide.

313
00:36:20,225 --> 00:36:22,320
Their weapons have become too deadly.

314
00:36:23,645 --> 00:36:27,000
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
helping them advance, Phastos.

315
00:36:27,122 --> 00:36:30,633
Technology is a part of 
their evolutionary process, Druig.

316
00:36:30,658 --> 00:36:32,419
It's not exactly something that I can stop.

317
00:36:32,444 --> 00:36:34,571
No, you can't. But I can.

318
00:36:36,532 --> 00:36:38,201
It's too late.

319
00:36:38,398 --> 00:36:40,805
- Thena?
- Everyone is going to die.

320
00:36:42,038 --> 00:36:43,172
Are you okay?

321
00:36:44,456 --> 00:36:45,457
Thena?

322
00:36:48,422 --> 00:36:49,297
Thena?

323
00:36:49,322 --> 00:36:50,977
- Thena, no!
- Thena!

324
00:37:19,742 --> 00:37:21,945
Don't listen to your head, Thena.

325
00:37:23,037 --> 00:37:24,998
Listen to my voice.

326
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:28,320
You are safe.

327
00:37:29,501 --> 00:37:31,508
You are loved.

328
00:37:32,904 --> 00:37:34,875
You're our Thena.

329
00:37:42,098 --> 00:37:43,407
Hey, Thena!

330
00:37:43,432 --> 00:37:45,568
Hey! Stop, stop, stop!

331
00:38:03,953 --> 00:38:05,537
- Is she okay?
- Yeah.

332
00:38:06,831 --> 00:38:07,957
Sersi.

333
00:38:07,982 --> 00:38:09,269
Thena, please.

334
00:38:09,594 --> 00:38:11,175
Come back to us.

335
00:38:11,878 --> 00:38:12,921
Okay.

336
00:38:29,572 --> 00:38:31,699
I thought Mahd Wy'ry was a myth.

337
00:38:35,142 --> 00:38:36,811
There is no cure...

338
00:38:37,718 --> 00:38:39,360
...so no one really talks about it.

339
00:38:43,985 --> 00:38:45,126
What happened?

340
00:38:45,151 --> 00:38:46,194
Thena.

341
00:38:46,307 --> 00:38:47,851
You attacked everyone.

342
00:38:48,307 --> 00:38:50,975
Wounded Sersi, Phastos,

343
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,961
you nearly killed Makkari.

344
00:38:55,345 --> 00:38:57,079
I don't remember.

345
00:38:57,261 --> 00:38:59,346
You have Mahd Wy'ry.

346
00:38:59,775 --> 00:39:03,805
Your mind is fracturing
under the weight of your memories.

347
00:39:03,953 --> 00:39:08,305
And all I can do is erase them
so that you can start over.

348
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:12,783
I will have to inform Arishem
and take you back to the ship

349
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,555
where we have the technology
to help you.

350
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,466
What if it happens again?

351
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,969
She could've killed you.
She could have killed all of us.

352
00:39:21,994 --> 00:39:22,995
Please.

353
00:39:24,476 --> 00:39:27,063
Please, I... I want to remember.

354
00:39:27,925 --> 00:39:29,954
I want to remember my life.

355
00:39:30,505 --> 00:39:32,180
Thena, I love you.

356
00:39:32,276 --> 00:39:33,902
But listen to me.

357
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:37,446
It's not important if you remember or not.

358
00:39:38,096 --> 00:39:40,141
Your spirit will remain.

359
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:42,960
You will always be Thena deep inside.

360
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:44,626
Trust me.

361
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:46,024
Why should she trust you?

362
00:39:47,591 --> 00:39:50,376
You're asking her
to let you erase who she is.

363
00:39:50,401 --> 00:39:52,237
Druig, I know you're upset, but-

364
00:39:52,262 --> 00:39:53,501
Upset?

365
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,883
We've trusted you for 7,000 years,
and look where you've gotten us.

366
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,258
I've watched humans destroy each other
when I could stop it all in a heartbeat.

367
00:40:07,021 --> 00:40:09,732
Do you know what that does to someone 
after centuries?

368
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,212
Could our mission have been a mistake?

369
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:17,180
Are we really helping these people
build a better world, huh?

370
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:28,545
We're just like the soldiers down there.

371
00:40:29,252 --> 00:40:31,420
Pawns to their leaders.

372
00:40:32,126 --> 00:40:34,211
Blinded by loyalty.

373
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,920
It ends now.

374
00:40:56,893 --> 00:40:57,894
Let them go.

375
00:40:57,919 --> 00:40:59,545
You're gonna have to make me.

376
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:00,571
Stop.

377
00:41:07,176 --> 00:41:08,719
If you wanna stop me,

378
00:41:09,763 --> 00:41:11,640
you're gonna have to kill me.

379
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:37,254
I'll watch over Thena.

380
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:39,261
Let her keep her memories.

381
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:42,461
One day, when she attacks you,

382
00:41:42,826 --> 00:41:44,869
you might have to kill her.

383
00:41:51,156 --> 00:41:52,908
We'll take that chance.

384
00:42:02,859 --> 00:42:04,026
You may all go.

385
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,970
The Deviants are gone.

386
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:11,585
There is no reason
for you to stay with me.

387
00:42:12,153 --> 00:42:13,928
Shouldn't you ask Arishem first?

388
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,888
We're a team, we should stay together.

389
00:42:15,913 --> 00:42:18,303
I didn't ask you for your advice, Ikaris.

390
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,155
Do not forget your place.

391
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,712
This is where we say goodbye.

392
00:42:27,807 --> 00:42:29,553
You are free to go.

393
00:42:30,738 --> 00:42:35,741
I want you to go out there.
And live a life for yourselves.

394
00:42:35,947 --> 00:42:41,163
Not as soldiers.
Not with the purpose you were given.

395
00:42:41,673 --> 00:42:44,585
Find your own purpose.

396
00:42:45,445 --> 00:42:49,686
And one day,
when we see each other again,

397
00:42:52,061 --> 00:42:55,077
I want you to tell me what you found.

398
00:44:05,187 --> 00:44:07,302
I am Karun Patel.

399
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:09,371
Kingo's valet.

400
00:44:10,157 --> 00:44:13,731
It's truly an honor to be in the presence
of the great Eternals.

401
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:32,518
Cut!

402
00:44:32,543 --> 00:44:36,904
Okay, everyone, that was good.
But we could do 10% better.

403
00:44:36,929 --> 00:44:39,156
That was beautiful. Very, very good.

404
00:44:39,181 --> 00:44:40,933
Really, so good.

405
00:44:41,267 --> 00:44:43,352
My friends from college are here.

406
00:44:43,894 --> 00:44:44,995
Hello, boss!

407
00:44:45,604 --> 00:44:46,897
Perfect timing!

408
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:48,135
Welcome to the set of...

409
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:52,665
I'm playing you!

410
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,380
- You like the costume?
- We need to talk.

411
00:44:54,405 --> 00:44:55,881
Tell the director 
I have some notes for him-

412
00:44:55,906 --> 00:44:57,354
We need to talk to you in private.

413
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:01,262
Oh, Karun, he's worked with me
for 50 years. I trust him completely.

414
00:45:01,287 --> 00:45:03,707
Actually, when we first met,
he thought I was a vampire,

415
00:45:03,732 --> 00:45:05,526
and he tried to stake me
through the heart.

416
00:45:05,551 --> 00:45:07,560
I have apologized so many times.

417
00:45:07,585 --> 00:45:10,302
Not quite enough times.
Very close, though. I'll let you know.

418
00:45:10,327 --> 00:45:11,746
Oh, I have to get ready for the next scene.

419
00:45:11,771 --> 00:45:13,482
Come to my tent, we'll talk there.

420
00:45:13,507 --> 00:45:16,632
You guys are gonna love the next scene.
I come in on a wire 'cause, you know,

421
00:45:16,656 --> 00:45:17,903
I can't fly.

422
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:19,797
Wait, are we getting back together?

423
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,881
We need to talk.

424
00:45:20,906 --> 00:45:22,116
I've been waiting for the day

425
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,452
the world learns the true identity
of the Shadow Warrior.

426
00:45:24,477 --> 00:45:25,846
Ajak's dead.

427
00:45:31,025 --> 00:45:32,401
She was killed.

428
00:45:32,975 --> 00:45:34,471
It was a Deviant.

429
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,727
The Deviants are back.

430
00:45:41,035 --> 00:45:42,674
We don't know how many there are.

431
00:45:46,321 --> 00:45:47,877
You need to come with us.

432
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:06,452
I can't just go. I mean,
all these people depend on me.

433
00:46:06,477 --> 00:46:09,088
We just started shooting this movie.
It's the first of a trilogy.

434
00:46:09,468 --> 00:46:11,470
We just got BTS to do a cameo...

435
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,487
Sir, may I say something?

436
00:46:15,492 --> 00:46:16,921
Please don't say anything.

437
00:46:16,946 --> 00:46:17,988
I think you should go.

438
00:46:18,013 --> 00:46:19,507
I just said don't say anything.

439
00:46:19,532 --> 00:46:23,787
"Life affords no greater duty
than to protect one's family!"

440
00:46:24,565 --> 00:46:31,054
Remember? It's your favorite line
from The Shadow Warrior 2: Voyage of Time.

441
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:33,776
Your family needs you.

442
00:46:44,758 --> 00:46:46,776
Seven thousand years.

443
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:52,396
That's how long the battle between
Eternals and Deviants has raged for.

444
00:46:52,971 --> 00:46:54,815
You think I'm a movie star.

445
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,776
Well, I am. But I am also...

446
00:46:58,917 --> 00:47:00,502
...an Eternal.

447
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,241
Kingo, what are you doing?

448
00:47:02,913 --> 00:47:05,729
I think we should be remembered, so...

449
00:47:06,182 --> 00:47:10,229
I am making a documentary about us.

450
00:47:10,628 --> 00:47:13,706
You are about to meet 
my fellow Eternal, Sprite.

451
00:47:13,836 --> 00:47:16,047
Sprite, tell them about yourself.

452
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:17,526
Oh, wait.

453
00:47:21,536 --> 00:47:24,038
Okay, well, we'll circle back to her.

454
00:47:24,614 --> 00:47:26,824
This is Sersi.

455
00:47:27,516 --> 00:47:28,517
Sersi,

456
00:47:28,542 --> 00:47:30,376
tell them about yourself.

457
00:47:32,213 --> 00:47:33,748
- Uh...
- We're rolling.

458
00:47:33,773 --> 00:47:34,774
Well, uh...

459
00:47:36,317 --> 00:47:40,963
I can change a rock into water.

460
00:47:41,345 --> 00:47:44,190
Uh, I could turn a rock into wood.

461
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,720
Or a rock into metal.

462
00:47:46,745 --> 00:47:48,969
Actually, one time, 
I turned a rock into air.

463
00:47:48,994 --> 00:47:49,995
Cut.

464
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:52,458
Um, you know what?
Why don't you think about it,

465
00:47:52,483 --> 00:47:54,226
and we'll get back to you, okay?

466
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:55,292
Let's go.

467
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:00,407
Sprite says you're addicted to this thing.

468
00:48:02,761 --> 00:48:03,929
Oh, this?

469
00:48:04,804 --> 00:48:06,049
Look at this.

470
00:48:08,388 --> 00:48:10,812
- Whoa.
- You know, seeing as we don't age.

471
00:48:11,629 --> 00:48:13,463
I think you look quite good.

472
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:16,284
Don't you?

473
00:48:20,212 --> 00:48:24,026
Nobody ever wonders how you managed
to be the leading man for over 100 years?

474
00:48:24,351 --> 00:48:25,896
Oh, I don't know what you're talking about.

475
00:48:25,921 --> 00:48:28,338
That is my great-great-grandfather,

476
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:30,784
that is my great-grandfather,

477
00:48:30,809 --> 00:48:31,987
grandfather,

478
00:48:32,012 --> 00:48:34,172
father, and me.

479
00:48:34,197 --> 00:48:37,377
I'm part of the greatest dynasty
in the history of Bollywood.

480
00:48:37,557 --> 00:48:38,822
Pretty impressive, right?

481
00:48:38,847 --> 00:48:40,891
You abandoned me in Macedonia.

482
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,320
Okay, I got sick of moving 
every five years.

483
00:48:46,345 --> 00:48:49,306
People freak out 
when they notice that you don't...

484
00:48:51,665 --> 00:48:52,752
...age.

485
00:48:53,629 --> 00:48:55,057
I thought we were friends.

486
00:49:02,024 --> 00:49:03,902
Do you know why I love movies?

487
00:49:04,825 --> 00:49:06,252
Because of you.

488
00:49:06,572 --> 00:49:08,260
I missed sitting in the audience,

489
00:49:08,285 --> 00:49:10,417
listening to your stories,
watching your illusions.

490
00:49:15,373 --> 00:49:17,557
We should've all stayed together.

491
00:49:19,783 --> 00:49:21,667
Ajak would still be alive.

492
00:49:23,319 --> 00:49:25,113
She should have never let us go.

493
00:49:35,976 --> 00:49:37,909
This is the Deviant you fought in London?

494
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:39,639
It's different.

495
00:49:40,391 --> 00:49:42,565
There must be more out there
than we thought.

496
00:49:42,803 --> 00:49:43,888
Oh.

497
00:49:44,048 --> 00:49:46,255
Is... Is this a Deviant, sir?

498
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,424
Yep.

499
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,951
It's a beautiful creature.

500
00:49:49,976 --> 00:49:53,722
What? This? This? No. It's hideous.

501
00:49:53,747 --> 00:49:55,698
You've never had one
try to bite your head off.

502
00:49:55,723 --> 00:49:56,948
- Roll.
- Oh.

503
00:49:57,915 --> 00:50:01,346
You're about to meet two of the
greatest warriors the world has ever known.

504
00:50:01,611 --> 00:50:05,151
Thena, legendary, deadly, fashionable.

505
00:50:05,403 --> 00:50:06,947
And her trusty friend...

506
00:50:07,176 --> 00:50:08,260
Door.

507
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:11,014
...a mighty powerhouse of strength,

508
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:14,001
the fearsome Gilgamesh!

509
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,603
Gilgamesh!

510
00:50:20,606 --> 00:50:22,191
What took you so long?

511
00:50:25,335 --> 00:50:27,254
You look younger today, Sprite.

512
00:50:27,279 --> 00:50:28,901
I have the same apron.

513
00:50:29,281 --> 00:50:30,574
Who the hell are you?

514
00:50:30,921 --> 00:50:33,432
I'm Karun. Kingo's valet.

515
00:50:33,703 --> 00:50:36,393
Oh, valet. Like Alfred in Batman.

516
00:50:36,634 --> 00:50:39,308
Gilgamesh. The Deviants are back.

517
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:41,920
No shit. I could have used some help.

518
00:50:42,188 --> 00:50:44,647
We were attacked by a Deviant 
in London, too.

519
00:50:44,672 --> 00:50:46,423
Even Ikaris couldn't kill it.

520
00:50:47,466 --> 00:50:48,467
You couldn't?

521
00:50:48,492 --> 00:50:50,393
I was distracted.

522
00:50:50,418 --> 00:50:51,823
Sure, man.

523
00:50:52,763 --> 00:50:55,143
Hey, you guys wanna try my pie?

524
00:50:57,667 --> 00:50:59,251
I'm sorry, Gil.

525
00:50:59,927 --> 00:51:01,510
Ajak's dead.

526
00:51:04,124 --> 00:51:05,432
It's true, buddy.

527
00:51:05,982 --> 00:51:07,275
We lost her.

528
00:51:39,476 --> 00:51:40,645
Sersi.

529
00:51:42,008 --> 00:51:45,955
The attack triggered her.
She's no fun to be around right now.

530
00:51:47,414 --> 00:51:48,875
Hey, Thena.

531
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:51,066
Look who's here.

532
00:51:52,129 --> 00:51:53,297
Give me your hand.

533
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,316
Thena.

534
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:00,293
Everyone in Centuri-6 is going to die.

535
00:52:01,082 --> 00:52:02,266
Give me your hand.

536
00:52:02,291 --> 00:52:04,501
It's too late. We can't save them.

537
00:52:04,753 --> 00:52:05,863
Thena.

538
00:52:12,427 --> 00:52:13,527
Thena.

539
00:52:14,379 --> 00:52:16,691
We came to Earth together on our ship.

540
00:52:19,454 --> 00:52:21,163
You're an Eternal.

541
00:52:21,928 --> 00:52:24,441
The greatest warrior of Olympia.

542
00:52:24,762 --> 00:52:26,895
The legendary protector of Athens.

543
00:52:28,473 --> 00:52:30,349
The goddess of war.

544
00:52:32,453 --> 00:52:34,645
Remember who you are.

545
00:52:42,762 --> 00:52:44,221
Remember.

546
00:53:00,264 --> 00:53:01,830
- Thena.
- Hi.

547
00:53:03,384 --> 00:53:04,385
Hello.

548
00:53:04,485 --> 00:53:06,445
Hey, who's your gardener?

549
00:53:08,011 --> 00:53:10,412
This is just what you guys eat every day?

550
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,109
- Yeah, this is amazing.
- Every day.

551
00:53:12,134 --> 00:53:14,220
- Thank you for this.
- Oh, you're welcome.

552
00:53:14,404 --> 00:53:15,572
Help yourself.

553
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:19,032
This one is a trio of wine, beer, and mead.

554
00:53:19,057 --> 00:53:21,517
Made for all the soldiers
in the battle of Troy.

555
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:23,618
That's so thoughtful.

556
00:53:30,587 --> 00:53:32,173
Should she be drinking?

557
00:53:33,227 --> 00:53:36,649
No, hers is non-alcoholic. For kids.

558
00:53:38,703 --> 00:53:41,009
I gave you the same thing, Sprite.

559
00:53:43,726 --> 00:53:44,727
For kids.

560
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:48,281
I was just kidding.

561
00:53:48,306 --> 00:53:49,982
Yours is a secret brew

562
00:53:50,006 --> 00:53:54,861
Odin taught me as a thank-you after 
we helped defeat Laufey's army in Tonsberg.

563
00:53:55,185 --> 00:53:56,228
What?

564
00:53:56,334 --> 00:53:58,752
Oh. I'm a big baby.

565
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,736
Very mature. Can you stop?

566
00:54:01,661 --> 00:54:02,996
- Stop.
- Speaking of Odin,

567
00:54:03,021 --> 00:54:05,548
Thor used to follow me around
when he was a little kid.

568
00:54:05,573 --> 00:54:08,200
Now he's a famous Avenger
and won't return my calls.

569
00:54:08,437 --> 00:54:11,187
So, now that Captain Rogers
and Iron Man are both gone,

570
00:54:11,212 --> 00:54:13,033
who do you think
is gonna lead the Avengers?

571
00:54:13,644 --> 00:54:15,145
I could lead them.

572
00:54:15,381 --> 00:54:17,642
- I figure I'd be good at that. 
- Yeah, you would.

573
00:54:17,895 --> 00:54:20,274
Ajak didn't even choose you to lead us.

574
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:21,248
Whoa.

575
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,222
- Ouch, Gil. Ouch.
- Harsh.

576
00:54:23,252 --> 00:54:25,084
I'm gonna let that one slide
because, you know,

577
00:54:25,109 --> 00:54:26,758
you've always been bitter
that I can fly and you can't.

578
00:54:26,783 --> 00:54:29,814
Oh, so what, you can fly.
I'm better-looking, everybody knows that.

579
00:54:29,981 --> 00:54:31,127
Where you going?

580
00:54:32,882 --> 00:54:34,550
I'm just gonna get some air.

581
00:54:39,112 --> 00:54:42,010
Mmm. This is really good, Gil.

582
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:45,554
You know, I could sell this.
Put my face on it, move some units.

583
00:54:45,579 --> 00:54:46,873
I made it from corn.

584
00:54:46,906 --> 00:54:50,618
I chew each kernel myself
and ferment it in my spit.

585
00:55:04,669 --> 00:55:07,505
Is this the Centuri-6 
Thena was talking about?

586
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:09,640
Yeah, it's a planet.

587
00:55:10,526 --> 00:55:13,952
She thinks she used to live there
until it was destroyed.

588
00:55:14,328 --> 00:55:17,958
Always talks about massive quakes 
ripping it apart.

589
00:55:18,242 --> 00:55:20,160
Everyone died, including herself.

590
00:55:20,445 --> 00:55:23,366
We had an unprecedented 
global earthquake three days ago.

591
00:55:23,859 --> 00:55:27,608
Oh, that's what that was.
I thought I was drunk.

592
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:30,535
Ajak chose me to lead us, but...

593
00:55:31,238 --> 00:55:33,783
...I can't even figure out
how to speak to Arishem.

594
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:35,867
I've tried so many times.

595
00:55:37,114 --> 00:55:39,343
Maybe you're trying too hard.

596
00:55:40,145 --> 00:55:42,731
Sometimes, you just have to listen.

597
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:31,264
Sersi.

598
00:56:32,241 --> 00:56:33,473
Arishem.

599
00:56:33,894 --> 00:56:38,106
Ajak was killed by a Deviant.
We think it absorbed her power.

600
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,083
And something unusual
is happening to Earth.

601
00:56:41,417 --> 00:56:44,420
It is a side effect of the emergence.

602
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,346
The emergence?

603
00:56:48,168 --> 00:56:52,051
It is time for you to learn
the true purpose of your mission.

604
00:56:52,512 --> 00:56:57,177
You were sent to Earth
to bring forth the Celestial Tiamut.

605
00:56:59,117 --> 00:57:03,864
Every billion years,
new Celestials must be born.

606
00:57:04,356 --> 00:57:08,763
I plant Celestial seeds into host planets
across the universe.

607
00:57:10,981 --> 00:57:15,005
The planet Earth was chosen
to host the Celestial Tiamut.

608
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:25,907
In order to grow, Tiamut needs vast
amounts of energy from intelligent life.

609
00:57:26,814 --> 00:57:30,449
The Deviants prevented this
by consuming humans

610
00:57:30,474 --> 00:57:33,247
until the Eternals eliminated them.

611
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:39,740
Now, the human population of this planet
has reached the required amount.

612
00:57:39,884 --> 00:57:43,013
It is time for the emergence to begin.

613
00:58:02,849 --> 00:58:04,028
But...

614
00:58:05,027 --> 00:58:06,974
...everyone on Earth will die.

615
00:58:08,607 --> 00:58:11,694
The end of one life, Sersi,

616
00:58:13,071 --> 00:58:15,411
is the beginning of another.

617
00:58:28,782 --> 00:58:32,661
Our universe is a constant
exchange of energy.

618
00:58:33,795 --> 00:58:37,698
An infinite cycle of creation
and destruction.

619
00:58:38,539 --> 00:58:44,362
Celestials use energy
gathered from host planets to create suns,

620
00:58:44,673 --> 00:58:50,768
generating gravity, heat, and light
for new galaxies to form.

621
00:58:55,739 --> 00:59:00,698
Without us, 
our universe will fall into darkness.

622
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,503
All life will die.

623
00:59:06,494 --> 00:59:08,246
Ajak knew the truth?

624
00:59:08,646 --> 00:59:13,526
She has helped many Celestials
to emerge over millions of years.

625
00:59:13,551 --> 00:59:15,261
So have you.

626
00:59:17,945 --> 00:59:20,221
Earth was my first mission.

627
00:59:21,731 --> 00:59:25,182
I was home, on Olympia.

628
00:59:26,651 --> 00:59:29,221
There is no Olympia.

629
00:59:47,141 --> 00:59:50,234
This is your true home, Sersi.

630
00:59:51,189 --> 00:59:53,039
The World Forge.

631
00:59:55,752 --> 01:00:00,006
It is here that I built
and programmed the Eternals.

632
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:38,177
Everything dies except us...

633
01:00:39,433 --> 01:00:41,477
...because we were never alive.

634
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:47,461
Why don't I remember any of this?

635
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:02,726
Because your memories are erased
and reset after each emergence.

636
01:01:03,529 --> 01:01:05,195
They are stored here.

637
01:01:07,744 --> 01:01:09,371
Why do you keep them?

638
01:01:10,055 --> 01:01:13,475
I keep them in order
to study the Deviants.

639
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:20,531
I created the Deviants, Sersi,
for the same purpose I created you.

640
01:01:21,412 --> 01:01:25,375
Every Celestial host planet
has its own predators.

641
01:01:29,001 --> 01:01:34,910
I first sent the Deviants to exterminate
them so intelligent life could grow.

642
01:01:40,356 --> 01:01:43,082
But there was a flaw in their design.

643
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:48,004
They evolved. Became predators themselves.

644
01:01:49,553 --> 01:01:51,863
And I lost control of them.

645
01:01:54,122 --> 01:01:57,125
I built and programmed you, Eternals,

646
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:03,415
to be synthetic beings and incapable
of evolution, to correct my mistake.

647
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:12,073
Sersi, Ajak has chosen you to
take her place as the Prime Eternal.

648
01:02:12,711 --> 01:02:14,667
Do not fail me.

649
01:02:33,214 --> 01:02:35,842
So, you're saying
we're basically fancy robots?

650
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:41,628
And our past memories are stored somewhere
in space?

651
01:02:41,889 --> 01:02:44,225
And Arishem made the Deviants.

652
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:47,813
I'm sorry, Thena.

653
01:02:48,246 --> 01:02:49,664
You tried to warn us.

654
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:52,022
The last time Arishem reset your memories,

655
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:53,693
something must have gone wrong.

656
01:02:54,326 --> 01:02:55,586
What do you mean?

657
01:02:55,611 --> 01:02:59,089
Well, that's what Mahd Wy'ry is, isn't it?

658
01:02:59,115 --> 01:03:02,561
All this time, Thena was remembering
all the other planets we were sent to

659
01:03:02,586 --> 01:03:04,808
and everyone dying during the emergence.

660
01:03:05,274 --> 01:03:06,917
I thought we were heroes.

661
01:03:07,597 --> 01:03:08,933
Turns out we're the bad guys.

662
01:03:08,958 --> 01:03:11,252
We're not the bad guys, okay?

663
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:14,438
We've helped the Celestials
expand life across the universe.

664
01:03:14,463 --> 01:03:17,776
That's not what bad guys do.
That's what good guys do.

665
01:03:17,801 --> 01:03:20,720
Every time innocent lives
have been sacrificed for the greater good,

666
01:03:20,745 --> 01:03:22,788
it turns out to be a mistake.

667
01:03:23,556 --> 01:03:25,366
We have to stop the emergence.

668
01:03:25,385 --> 01:03:29,142
Sersi, we have no right to
stop the birth of a Celestial.

669
01:03:29,167 --> 01:03:32,136
There has to be a way Tiamut can emerge
without destroying the Earth.

670
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:36,250
We just have to delay it
until we figure out how.

671
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:41,783
Could Druig control its mind?
Maybe put it to sleep?

672
01:03:41,808 --> 01:03:43,058
"Put it to sleep"?

673
01:03:43,534 --> 01:03:44,661
Are you serious?

674
01:03:44,686 --> 01:03:47,323
Gilgamesh asked Druig
to put me to sleep once.

675
01:03:48,384 --> 01:03:50,516
So I could take a vacation to Fiji, 
you know?

676
01:03:50,541 --> 01:03:52,168
We're talking about a Celestial, okay?

677
01:03:52,193 --> 01:03:53,194
We have to try.

678
01:03:53,219 --> 01:03:56,556
Come on, we're not gonna let
everyone on Earth die, right?

679
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:58,194
Right.

680
01:04:00,152 --> 01:04:03,280
I'm human. I'm a little biased.

681
01:04:07,472 --> 01:04:08,848
And do what?

682
01:04:09,516 --> 01:04:11,142
Watch TV?

683
01:04:11,410 --> 01:04:14,915
When I could be with 
the Earth's original superheroes

684
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:17,151
as they try to save the world?

685
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:22,056
Fine. If you want to, stay.

686
01:04:22,364 --> 01:04:24,019
Thank you very much, sir.

687
01:04:25,908 --> 01:04:28,828
Gilgamesh, could you please
get rid of the saliva beer?

688
01:04:28,853 --> 01:04:30,253
I thought you like it, man.

689
01:04:30,278 --> 01:04:32,280
We need to go. Now.

690
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:34,506
Find the others.

691
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,312
Once we're all together,

692
01:04:36,337 --> 01:04:38,683
we'll decide what to do 
about the emergence.

693
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:14,809
It's very nice here, sir.

694
01:05:14,834 --> 01:05:16,126
Don't be fooled.

695
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:18,995
Ignorance is bliss.

696
01:05:35,185 --> 01:05:36,457
Hello, Sprite.

697
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:46,057
I missed all of you.

698
01:05:49,003 --> 01:05:52,924
Please, make yourselves at home.

699
01:05:57,853 --> 01:06:00,856
You've given me a lot of bad news
in one go, my lady.

700
01:06:01,631 --> 01:06:02,799
Will you help us?

701
01:06:03,463 --> 01:06:04,301
I am glad that-

702
01:06:11,453 --> 01:06:14,426
Hey, what's your service?
I'm not getting any bars.

703
01:06:16,107 --> 01:06:19,444
Do you all remember this forest? Beautiful.

704
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:22,603
It was the last place 
we all lived together.

705
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:27,298
I've protected these people
for 20 generations now

706
01:06:27,323 --> 01:06:30,082
from the outside world
and from themselves.

707
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:32,257
Your kind, my friend,

708
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,204
you will be responsible
for your own extinction one day.

709
01:06:35,749 --> 01:06:37,168
Don't you think?

710
01:06:37,723 --> 01:06:40,920
I think we must learn from
our mistakes and do better, sir.

711
01:06:40,945 --> 01:06:42,887
You must not give up hope.

712
01:06:45,884 --> 01:06:47,223
Oh, no, you didn't.

713
01:06:47,248 --> 01:06:49,730
Okay, new rule, 
no more possessing people's valets.

714
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:51,906
Oh, where is your sense of humor, Kingo?

715
01:06:51,931 --> 01:06:52,932
I'm sorry, sir.

716
01:06:52,957 --> 01:06:55,167
Don't apologize, it's not your fault.

717
01:06:55,909 --> 01:06:58,537
You are not a god. You know that, right?

718
01:06:58,562 --> 01:07:01,996
How ironic. Kingo, the movie star.

719
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:04,335
I've directed some things, too.

720
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,737
Oh, yeah? Like what?

721
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:07,845
Some Internet content.

722
01:07:08,698 --> 01:07:09,841
How many views?

723
01:07:09,866 --> 01:07:11,785
I don't do it for the views.

724
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:13,887
Let's go. He's wasting our time.

725
01:07:13,912 --> 01:07:15,785
- We need him.
- Ikaris.

726
01:07:17,106 --> 01:07:18,191
I missed you.

727
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:21,458
Are you gonna charm me or threaten me?

728
01:07:21,483 --> 01:07:23,727
I mean, there's a third option, 
if you prefer that.

729
01:07:23,752 --> 01:07:26,556
It must be heartbreaking to find out
that you're not Mother's favorite.

730
01:07:26,581 --> 01:07:28,435
And I'm sure she'd be real proud
of what you've been up to.

731
01:07:28,459 --> 01:07:29,593
Druig, this is serious.

732
01:07:29,618 --> 01:07:31,291
I'll tell you what's serious.

733
01:07:32,361 --> 01:07:34,781
I've just been told 
I've been sent on a suicide mission

734
01:07:34,806 --> 01:07:36,575
for the past 7,000 years,

735
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:39,918
and that my entire existence is a lie.

736
01:07:43,108 --> 01:07:46,443
So, excuse me for not giving a shit
about your plan right now.

737
01:07:51,221 --> 01:07:52,640
Druig sucks.

738
01:07:52,846 --> 01:07:54,223
He does, sir.

739
01:08:14,951 --> 01:08:16,703
I don't like this place.

740
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:21,810
Druig needs to think, and Sersi
wants us to wait, so we wait.

741
01:08:21,816 --> 01:08:23,012
Mm.

742
01:08:23,522 --> 01:08:26,855
I couldn't recognize myself
in Sprite's illusions.

743
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:30,605
Those were the good old days.

744
01:08:32,602 --> 01:08:34,973
What if I can't fight anymore?

745
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:38,465
- Of course you can.
- Mm.

746
01:08:38,861 --> 01:08:40,905
What if I hurt you again?

747
01:08:41,271 --> 01:08:43,933
Come on. You know who you are.

748
01:08:44,125 --> 01:08:46,426
You're Thena, goddess of war.

749
01:08:51,315 --> 01:08:52,734
Thank you.

750
01:08:54,303 --> 01:08:55,496
For what?

751
01:08:57,344 --> 01:08:59,453
For always taking care of me.

752
01:08:59,557 --> 01:09:00,479
Oh.

753
01:09:01,876 --> 01:09:03,401
I'd do it again.

754
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:07,924
On any planet.

755
01:09:27,771 --> 01:09:29,230
I like watching him, too.

756
01:09:29,255 --> 01:09:30,422
Jeez.

757
01:09:31,618 --> 01:09:33,312
I don't think it's creepy at all.

758
01:09:35,735 --> 01:09:37,571
Have you read Peter Pan?

759
01:09:37,917 --> 01:09:41,242
Okay, so, to me, Ikaris is Peter,

760
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:42,359
Sersi is Wendy,

761
01:09:42,384 --> 01:09:45,023
you are Tinker Bell, for obvious reasons,

762
01:09:46,643 --> 01:09:49,254
and the rest of us are the Lost Boys.

763
01:09:49,604 --> 01:09:51,176
What's your point?

764
01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:53,984
Tinker Bell's always been in love 
with Peter.

765
01:09:57,503 --> 01:10:00,554
And it's hard for her
'cause she can never be with him.

766
01:10:03,503 --> 01:10:05,005
I'm sorry, Sprite.

767
01:10:06,923 --> 01:10:08,174
Kingo...

768
01:10:10,737 --> 01:10:12,922
...why did Arishem make me this way?

769
01:10:15,285 --> 01:10:16,745
I don't know.

770
01:10:24,567 --> 01:10:26,079
I thought you broke it.

771
01:10:26,104 --> 01:10:27,724
Always bring backups.

772
01:10:32,925 --> 01:10:34,817
You have a very angry family, sir.

773
01:10:35,415 --> 01:10:37,291
Yeah, it's a big issue.

774
01:10:37,504 --> 01:10:41,283
What about King Midas? Everything
he touched turned to gold. Was that you?

775
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,618
- Dane.
- Confucius? Aristotle?

776
01:10:42,643 --> 01:10:43,907
Call your uncle.

777
01:10:43,932 --> 01:10:45,647
What? My uncle? No.

778
01:10:45,672 --> 01:10:47,763
You've always wanted to
make amends with him, right?

779
01:10:47,788 --> 01:10:50,165
Now is the time. Trust me.

780
01:10:50,554 --> 01:10:52,139
Sersi, you're so weird.

781
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:53,185
Dane?

782
01:10:53,907 --> 01:10:54,778
Dane?

783
01:10:55,942 --> 01:10:57,294
You're breaking up.

784
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:58,622
You're breaking up?

785
01:11:01,205 --> 01:11:02,833
How did he take the news?

786
01:11:03,472 --> 01:11:06,087
Couldn't bring myself to tell him
it was the end of the world.

787
01:11:06,112 --> 01:11:07,997
There's nothing he could do.

788
01:11:08,646 --> 01:11:09,647
Sersi.

789
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:14,478
I'm worried about you.

790
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:18,450
If Arishem finds out
you're trying to stop the emergence...

791
01:11:20,627 --> 01:11:23,052
...I'm not powerful enough
to protect you from him.

792
01:11:28,843 --> 01:11:30,345
I'm not afraid.

793
01:11:31,769 --> 01:11:33,942
This violent cycle has to end.

794
01:11:38,676 --> 01:11:40,512
Hey, stop worrying about me.

795
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:42,915
Old habit.

796
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,732
Why did you leave?

797
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:58,005
I told myself
something must have happened to you.

798
01:11:58,153 --> 01:11:59,497
So, I waited.

799
01:12:00,259 --> 01:12:02,388
Days became years,

800
01:12:03,076 --> 01:12:04,903
and you never came back.

801
01:12:06,912 --> 01:12:08,341
Sersi,

802
01:12:09,310 --> 01:12:11,146
oh, I've missed you.

803
01:12:13,838 --> 01:12:15,607
I didn't want to leave.

804
01:12:19,006 --> 01:12:19,841
There's something I have to tell-

805
01:12:20,692 --> 01:12:21,989
Ikaris!

806
01:12:22,621 --> 01:12:23,831
Ikaris!

807
01:12:33,106 --> 01:12:34,396
Watch out!

808
01:12:34,774 --> 01:12:36,255
Clear the camp!

809
01:12:39,474 --> 01:12:40,528
Get behind me!

810
01:12:40,803 --> 01:12:42,048
One of them took Ikaris.

811
01:12:42,073 --> 01:12:43,241
It's an ambush!

812
01:12:52,667 --> 01:12:54,518
Very nice, sir!

813
01:12:54,543 --> 01:12:56,229
Are you mental? Hide!

814
01:12:56,254 --> 01:12:58,489
We need action sequences.

815
01:12:59,257 --> 01:13:00,333
Sir!

816
01:13:00,987 --> 01:13:02,872
Sprite, get Karun out of here.

817
01:13:05,096 --> 01:13:07,974
How many cameras did you bring, young man?

818
01:13:15,915 --> 01:13:17,333
Kingo!

819
01:13:17,358 --> 01:13:18,776
Come on!

820
01:13:25,491 --> 01:13:26,701
This way!

821
01:13:26,868 --> 01:13:28,036
Quickly! Come on!

822
01:13:33,166 --> 01:13:34,810
Get in! Get in!

823
01:14:12,877 --> 01:14:13,713
Ikaris!

824
01:14:29,263 --> 01:14:33,059
I've fought that one before.
It's stronger than the others.

825
01:14:36,145 --> 01:14:37,355
No.

826
01:14:39,503 --> 01:14:40,792
Terrible timing, Thena.

827
01:14:41,588 --> 01:14:42,568
Thena!

828
01:14:51,077 --> 01:14:52,190
Stop, Thena!

829
01:15:27,738 --> 01:15:29,006
Let them go.

830
01:15:29,172 --> 01:15:30,716
Now is not the time, Sersi.

831
01:15:30,741 --> 01:15:33,674
Please. I know you're better than this.

832
01:15:43,293 --> 01:15:44,475
Druig.

833
01:15:45,372 --> 01:15:47,374
Go! Get to the river!

834
01:16:05,252 --> 01:16:06,670
Gilgamesh.

835
01:16:07,253 --> 01:16:08,963
A little help here?

836
01:16:09,269 --> 01:16:10,395
Stay here.

837
01:16:11,109 --> 01:16:12,110
Say it.

838
01:16:13,563 --> 01:16:14,514
Stay here.

839
01:16:14,539 --> 01:16:16,688
Good. You're okay.

840
01:16:28,482 --> 01:16:29,959
They're headed for the camp.

841
01:16:29,984 --> 01:16:31,742
Go. They need you.

842
01:16:32,031 --> 01:16:33,449
Go, Ikaris.

843
01:16:41,258 --> 01:16:43,297
Sprite, buy me some time!

844
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:51,380
Whoa. Whoa!

845
01:16:52,609 --> 01:16:54,403
Can you hurry up?

846
01:16:56,631 --> 01:16:57,632
Now!

847
01:17:02,365 --> 01:17:03,443
Dishoom.

848
01:17:12,826 --> 01:17:15,090
Karun! Did you get that?

849
01:17:15,115 --> 01:17:16,682
I did, sir!

850
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,630
- Kingo!
- Just go.

851
01:17:53,635 --> 01:17:55,094
I'm not leaving you.

852
01:17:55,701 --> 01:17:56,646
Sprite!

853
01:18:31,388 --> 01:18:32,503
Ikaris!

854
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:17,488
Sersi! Are you all right?

855
01:19:27,944 --> 01:19:29,654
How did you do that?

856
01:19:30,583 --> 01:19:31,862
I don't know.

857
01:19:49,724 --> 01:19:50,597
Thena.

858
01:20:33,217 --> 01:20:35,421
No. Gilgamesh.

859
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:37,112
Stay back.

860
01:20:45,301 --> 01:20:46,983
Ajak...

861
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,928
Her memories...

862
01:20:51,893 --> 01:20:53,895
I understand now.

863
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:57,244
I can see what she saw.

864
01:20:58,246 --> 01:21:00,290
So many planets.

865
01:21:01,315 --> 01:21:06,975
So much life destroyed
every time a Celestial is born.

866
01:21:07,565 --> 01:21:14,378
Arishem used us and left us to die 
with each emergence.

867
01:21:14,403 --> 01:21:16,042
We just wanted to survive.

868
01:21:18,461 --> 01:21:20,589
And then he sent you.

869
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:26,280
I will kill you all
for what you have done to my kind.

870
01:21:26,305 --> 01:21:29,214
You are not saviors, Eternals.

871
01:21:29,556 --> 01:21:31,223
You are murderers.

872
01:21:34,814 --> 01:21:35,815
Ikaris!

873
01:21:50,825 --> 01:21:52,117
Thena.

874
01:21:55,211 --> 01:21:56,461
Hey.

875
01:21:58,391 --> 01:21:59,934
Remember.

876
01:22:08,156 --> 01:22:09,617
No.

877
01:22:11,525 --> 01:22:12,817
No.

878
01:22:16,352 --> 01:22:17,844
I'll remember.

879
01:22:18,067 --> 01:22:19,611
I'll remember.

880
01:22:42,431 --> 01:22:44,201
I'll remember.

881
01:23:26,982 --> 01:23:28,568
When I left,

882
01:23:29,051 --> 01:23:34,164
I thought about taking over the minds
of every human on this planet.

883
01:23:34,848 --> 01:23:38,435
Violence, fear, greed,

884
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:40,005
all gone.

885
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:41,446
Why didn't you?

886
01:23:41,471 --> 01:23:44,057
Because without their flaws,

887
01:23:44,538 --> 01:23:46,456
they wouldn't be human.

888
01:23:49,513 --> 01:23:52,516
Please, Druig. You can't stay here anymore.

889
01:23:53,204 --> 01:23:56,420
These Deviants are trying to keep us
from killing their own kind.

890
01:23:56,904 --> 01:23:59,834
They have a conscience now.
That makes them more dangerous.

891
01:23:59,859 --> 01:24:01,778
No, Sersi.

892
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,232
That makes them us.

893
01:24:06,132 --> 01:24:08,093
Eternals and Deviants.

894
01:24:09,153 --> 01:24:10,781
Arishem's children.

895
01:24:11,976 --> 01:24:15,779
But you are asking me to take control
of a mind of a Celestial.

896
01:24:15,988 --> 01:24:18,865
I do not have that kind of power.

897
01:24:19,279 --> 01:24:20,990
We'll need Phastos.

898
01:24:23,637 --> 01:24:25,055
Well, good luck.

899
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:28,795
He gave up on humans a long time ago.

900
01:25:01,393 --> 01:25:02,779
I did this.

901
01:25:04,678 --> 01:25:07,162
If my technology hadn't
helped them advance...

902
01:25:12,269 --> 01:25:14,146
Druig was right.

903
01:25:15,078 --> 01:25:17,163
Our mission was a mistake.

904
01:25:17,867 --> 01:25:19,295
These people...

905
01:25:21,331 --> 01:25:22,726
...they're not worth saving.

906
01:25:22,751 --> 01:25:24,420
Oh, Phastos.

907
01:25:24,445 --> 01:25:26,212
They're not worth saving.

908
01:25:38,348 --> 01:25:40,101
- Thanks.
- Give me a good one.

909
01:25:40,126 --> 01:25:41,786
- All right.
- Over here.

910
01:25:41,811 --> 01:25:42,888
And...

911
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:44,122
Oh, that's great, man!

912
01:25:44,147 --> 01:25:45,231
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

913
01:25:45,256 --> 01:25:46,455
- Oh, yeah!
- Nice.

914
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:47,976
All right, ready? Throw!

915
01:25:48,193 --> 01:25:49,500
Oh, so close.

916
01:25:49,525 --> 01:25:50,981
- Daddy, Daddy, watch this.
- Yeah, okay.

917
01:25:51,006 --> 01:25:52,966
- Watch this. 
- Let me see. Let me see it.

918
01:25:54,084 --> 01:25:55,732
Dad. I'm only a starter.

919
01:25:55,757 --> 01:25:56,758
Hi.

920
01:25:57,118 --> 01:25:59,495
- Hello. Can we help you?
- Throw it again.

921
01:25:59,662 --> 01:26:01,291
Hey, Jack.

922
01:26:01,315 --> 01:26:02,749
Ben.

923
01:26:03,407 --> 01:26:06,787
Hey, guys. 
These are my friends from college.

924
01:26:08,934 --> 01:26:14,045
Uh, this is Sylvia and, uh, Isaac. 
That's Isaac.

925
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:15,348
Isaac.

926
01:26:15,372 --> 01:26:16,905
Dad, that's Superman.

927
01:26:16,930 --> 01:26:18,014
Dad, that's Superman!

928
01:26:18,039 --> 01:26:19,281
Jack... That's really funny, Jack.

929
01:26:19,306 --> 01:26:21,558
- That is definitely not Superman.
- No, no! He is Superman.

930
01:26:21,583 --> 01:26:22,869
I saw him on TV.

931
01:26:22,894 --> 01:26:25,412
He was in London, fighting a monster.

932
01:26:25,437 --> 01:26:29,474
And you were with a cape and you were
shooting laser beams out of your eyes.

933
01:26:30,375 --> 01:26:31,878
- I don't wear a cape.
- Oh, sorry.

934
01:26:31,903 --> 01:26:33,738
Okay, well, 
we should just go inside, right?

935
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:36,405
Can I call you Clark? Is that what
you go by now? Because, you know...

936
01:26:36,431 --> 01:26:38,059
You've called me worse.

937
01:26:38,367 --> 01:26:40,053
- You got it, Jack?
- Mm-hmm.

938
01:26:40,078 --> 01:26:42,038
- Way to go.
- Yes.

939
01:26:42,063 --> 01:26:43,545
All right. Show me how it's done.

940
01:26:43,748 --> 01:26:46,107
Round and round and round
and round and round.

941
01:26:49,838 --> 01:26:51,547
- Yep, you got it. Keep going.
- Come on.

942
01:27:00,218 --> 01:27:03,179
Yeah. Incredibly natural, guys.

943
01:27:05,979 --> 01:27:08,064
So, after all these years,

944
01:27:08,089 --> 01:27:10,457
even you fell for Ajak's lies.

945
01:27:10,482 --> 01:27:12,652
- No need to rub it in.
- Mm.

946
01:27:13,987 --> 01:27:18,032
It all makes sense why she wouldn't
let us interfere with human conflicts.

947
01:27:18,574 --> 01:27:20,243
Conflicts lead to war,

948
01:27:20,268 --> 01:27:24,798
and war actually leads to advancement
in lifesaving technology and medicine.

949
01:27:24,995 --> 01:27:30,169
So our mission was never to
make a peaceful or harmonious world,

950
01:27:30,194 --> 01:27:33,638
but to increase the population 
at all costs.

951
01:27:34,257 --> 01:27:37,260
Just farming humans as food
for the Celestials, right?

952
01:27:37,285 --> 01:27:38,156
That's bleak.

953
01:27:38,175 --> 01:27:40,148
Well, so is telling your husband 
and your child

954
01:27:40,173 --> 01:27:41,844
that they could be dead within a few days.

955
01:27:41,869 --> 01:27:43,834
Thought you'd given up on humans.

956
01:27:44,671 --> 01:27:46,631
I got lucky. Okay?

957
01:27:48,829 --> 01:27:50,873
I have a family now.

958
01:27:51,219 --> 01:27:53,498
They give me faith again.

959
01:27:54,467 --> 01:27:58,904
And I see the good in humanity in them
every single day.

960
01:27:58,929 --> 01:28:00,615
So, look, I cannot help you.

961
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:01,998
- I am never leaving them.
- Phastos...

962
01:28:02,023 --> 01:28:03,107
I'm sorry, Sersi.

963
01:28:03,132 --> 01:28:04,639
It was wrong for me to use my powers

964
01:28:04,664 --> 01:28:06,959
without thinking about the consequences
in the first place.

965
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:11,542
So, now, I choose to use my hands
to fix my child's bicycle, okay?

966
01:28:12,086 --> 01:28:13,295
Do you?

967
01:28:14,189 --> 01:28:15,815
I don't use my powers anymore.

968
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:16,966
You sure?

969
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:18,176
What are you...

970
01:28:21,674 --> 01:28:25,144
What the hell is wrong with you?
My child is right down the hallway!

971
01:28:25,169 --> 01:28:26,986
That looks like someone's
been using his powers.

972
01:28:27,011 --> 01:28:27,678
Oh, my God.

973
01:28:27,703 --> 01:28:29,779
I bet you've built the perfect safe house.

974
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:31,353
What is this even made of? Vibranium?

975
01:28:31,376 --> 01:28:32,393
Don't!

976
01:28:36,563 --> 01:28:38,065
Fall collection.

977
01:28:38,185 --> 01:28:39,435
IKEA.

978
01:28:39,697 --> 01:28:40,698
Ass.

979
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:43,699
How did you even deal with this guy
for over 5,000 years?

980
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:46,326
If you stay here, you might as well 
invite the Deviants to dinner.

981
01:28:46,351 --> 01:28:48,039
Never mind waiting
for the end of the world.

982
01:28:48,064 --> 01:28:49,314
He has a point.

983
01:28:49,339 --> 01:28:52,710
No, I'm sorry. You can't just show up
in my life and expect me to go with you.

984
01:28:52,735 --> 01:28:54,737
- I'm not gonna...
- You should go, habibi.

985
01:28:55,507 --> 01:28:56,800
You want me to go?

986
01:28:56,951 --> 01:28:59,842
You know what my mom
would say to you right now, right?

987
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:05,554
He's a chronic procrastinator.

988
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:07,698
I'm not leaving you two. No way.

989
01:29:07,723 --> 01:29:09,701
I'm not happy about it,

990
01:29:10,232 --> 01:29:13,482
but if there's a chance for us to watch
Jack grow up to live a life of his own,

991
01:29:13,515 --> 01:29:15,178
we should take it.

992
01:30:43,696 --> 01:30:45,322
The Domo.

993
01:30:46,597 --> 01:30:48,099
Wow.

994
01:30:57,918 --> 01:31:01,004
A foreboding atmosphere fills the air.

995
01:31:01,964 --> 01:31:04,842
An eerie stillness chokes our lungs.

996
01:31:04,867 --> 01:31:07,494
What are you doing? You know you're
creeping us out. You know that, right?

997
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:08,763
Oh! Oh, God!

998
01:31:08,788 --> 01:31:10,408
Stay calm, T, please!

999
01:31:14,388 --> 01:31:16,766
Chips. It's just chips.

1000
01:31:17,230 --> 01:31:21,542
As you can see, being an Eternal does not
preclude you from having human emotions

1001
01:31:21,567 --> 01:31:23,361
such as cowardice.

1002
01:31:25,863 --> 01:31:27,448
What has she done?

1003
01:31:27,949 --> 01:31:31,285
Is that... a sarcophagus in my lab?

1004
01:31:32,578 --> 01:31:35,973
This is Makkari. 
Or should I say Miss Havisham?

1005
01:31:35,998 --> 01:31:37,931
None of us have seen her for centuries.

1006
01:31:42,547 --> 01:31:43,994
Hmm.

1007
01:32:01,558 --> 01:32:02,648
Is that the Ebony Blade?

1008
01:32:02,673 --> 01:32:03,924
Excalibur.

1009
01:32:05,712 --> 01:32:07,363
Arthur always did have a crush on you.

1010
01:32:18,330 --> 01:32:19,500
That.

1011
01:32:30,801 --> 01:32:33,963
DVD? It's all about streaming now.

1012
01:32:34,155 --> 01:32:38,321
You know, what you need is a Kindle.
Do you know what that is? It's like a...

1013
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:41,814
You know, I just realized that 
if you don't know what an iPad is,

1014
01:32:41,839 --> 01:32:43,966
there's almost no way to explain it.

1015
01:32:48,211 --> 01:32:52,800
So, how did you end up
scoring this Emerald Tablet,

1016
01:32:52,825 --> 01:32:55,745
my beautiful, beautiful Makkari?

1017
01:33:01,417 --> 01:33:04,126
I'm sorry, what are we watching?
Because this... Is this new?

1018
01:33:04,153 --> 01:33:05,353
Because I hate it.

1019
01:33:05,378 --> 01:33:08,282
Phastos, I need to control 
the mind of a Celestial.

1020
01:33:13,221 --> 01:33:14,347
Bracelets?

1021
01:33:14,847 --> 01:33:16,073
You made us bracelets?

1022
01:33:16,098 --> 01:33:18,193
So, here's a little Celestial 101.

1023
01:33:18,218 --> 01:33:21,977
Celestials are the most powerful
energy generators in the universe.

1024
01:33:22,021 --> 01:33:23,397
When Arishem made us,

1025
01:33:23,429 --> 01:33:26,980
he imbued us with infinite cosmic energy 
to keep our bodies regenerating.

1026
01:33:27,005 --> 01:33:28,736
The bracelets, in theory,

1027
01:33:28,761 --> 01:33:30,963
shut down our regeneration process.

1028
01:33:30,988 --> 01:33:34,075
And once that happens,
our bodies accumulate extra cosmic energy.

1029
01:33:34,408 --> 01:33:35,551
What for?

1030
01:33:35,576 --> 01:33:37,845
Well, if the Deviants 
can absorb our energy,

1031
01:33:38,913 --> 01:33:42,208
what if we can absorb
each other's energy as well?

1032
01:33:42,265 --> 01:33:45,019
If I can find a way to connect us all,

1033
01:33:45,044 --> 01:33:47,056
one of us could become immensely powerful,

1034
01:33:47,081 --> 01:33:49,830
pulling the accumulated energy
from the rest,

1035
01:33:49,855 --> 01:33:51,217
forming...

1036
01:33:54,762 --> 01:33:56,138
...a Uni-Mind.

1037
01:33:59,782 --> 01:34:01,869
"Uni" meaning "one", "mind" meaning "mind".

1038
01:34:01,886 --> 01:34:03,143
Oh, no, we heard you the first time.

1039
01:34:03,168 --> 01:34:04,461
- Terrible name.
- We'll brainstorm...

1040
01:34:05,139 --> 01:34:06,855
"Brainstorm"! That's a way better name!

1041
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:08,985
No, I invented it, 
so I'm calling it whatever I want.

1042
01:34:14,947 --> 01:34:17,366
We find humans a new home 
on another planet.

1043
01:34:17,594 --> 01:34:20,371
Are we building a big ship, too?
Take a pair of each animal?

1044
01:34:20,396 --> 01:34:22,915
Well, you know what's never
saved the planet? Your sarcasm.

1045
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:25,059
Space colonization could take decades.

1046
01:34:25,084 --> 01:34:26,603
It can happen quickly with our help.

1047
01:34:26,628 --> 01:34:29,046
What if we end up 
accidentally killing Tiamut?

1048
01:34:29,071 --> 01:34:31,157
We could be responsible
for billions of lives

1049
01:34:31,182 --> 01:34:33,085
not being created across the universe.

1050
01:34:33,110 --> 01:34:34,403
Boss, am I right?

1051
01:34:35,938 --> 01:34:37,690
Say something, Ikaris.

1052
01:34:37,951 --> 01:34:39,620
You don't think we should be doing this.

1053
01:34:46,298 --> 01:34:48,494
Ajak chose Sersi to lead us.

1054
01:34:50,198 --> 01:34:52,075
Sersi should decide.

1055
01:34:54,749 --> 01:34:56,717
Forget who Ajak chose.

1056
01:34:56,742 --> 01:34:59,853
You're the strongest.
You should be making this decision.

1057
01:35:00,995 --> 01:35:03,431
Fine. Just keep lying to yourself.

1058
01:35:03,456 --> 01:35:04,832
Sprite.

1059
01:35:13,888 --> 01:35:15,343
Okay, this is not...

1060
01:35:15,368 --> 01:35:16,750
- Ikaris.
- Don't run after him.

1061
01:35:16,758 --> 01:35:17,725
Kingo, I...

1062
01:35:17,749 --> 01:35:18,884
You guys.

1063
01:35:19,088 --> 01:35:21,691
Hey. Don't sweat it.
Sprite's always cranky.

1064
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:23,849
I used to hear her complaining
even when she wasn't there.

1065
01:35:23,874 --> 01:35:25,400
I'm okay, Kingo.

1066
01:35:25,428 --> 01:35:27,292
If you think we should do this, 
I trust you.

1067
01:35:27,317 --> 01:35:29,986
I will follow you to the end, 
like I always have.

1068
01:35:31,817 --> 01:35:33,319
What did you say?

1069
01:35:33,695 --> 01:35:36,155
I will follow you to the end,
like I always have.

1070
01:35:37,797 --> 01:35:39,720
I'm not who you think I am.

1071
01:36:18,948 --> 01:36:20,576
How long do we have?

1072
01:36:21,125 --> 01:36:22,711
Seven days.

1073
01:36:23,134 --> 01:36:24,428
Good.

1074
01:36:26,121 --> 01:36:28,103
We completed our mission.

1075
01:36:30,905 --> 01:36:32,449
Where is she?

1076
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:33,788
London.

1077
01:36:34,529 --> 01:36:36,357
She has a good life there.

1078
01:36:36,382 --> 01:36:38,467
I'm sure she's missed you.

1079
01:36:38,492 --> 01:36:41,854
If I'd gone back to her,
I would only have told her the truth.

1080
01:36:43,627 --> 01:36:45,510
She would've suffered,

1081
01:36:45,535 --> 01:36:48,244
knowing this world she loves
would end one day.

1082
01:36:48,269 --> 01:36:49,437
Ikaris.

1083
01:36:50,354 --> 01:36:52,023
We have to tell them the truth.

1084
01:36:52,205 --> 01:36:53,252
What?

1085
01:36:53,803 --> 01:36:54,775
Why?

1086
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,811
Because together 
we might be able to stop the emergence.

1087
01:36:58,569 --> 01:37:00,373
"Stop the emergence"?

1088
01:37:00,398 --> 01:37:01,399
Listen...

1089
01:37:01,424 --> 01:37:02,826
Ajak, I know it's hard at the end...

1090
01:37:02,851 --> 01:37:03,852
Listen to me, Ikaris.

1091
01:37:03,877 --> 01:37:06,822
I have followed Arishem 
for millions of years.

1092
01:37:06,847 --> 01:37:09,353
And I have never doubted him.

1093
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:11,248
- Until now.
- Why now?

1094
01:37:12,019 --> 01:37:13,396
Why now?

1095
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:22,970
Five years ago, Thanos erased
half of the population of the universe.

1096
01:37:24,381 --> 01:37:26,216
Delayed the emergence.

1097
01:37:28,426 --> 01:37:33,627
But the people of this planet brought
everyone back with the snap of a finger.

1098
01:37:34,927 --> 01:37:38,197
You know, after I let you all go,

1099
01:37:38,425 --> 01:37:41,095
I traveled the world, living among them.

1100
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:44,963
I have seen them fight and lie and kill,

1101
01:37:45,201 --> 01:37:50,181
but I have also seen them laugh and love.

1102
01:37:50,206 --> 01:37:54,033
I've seen them create and dream.

1103
01:37:57,169 --> 01:38:00,939
This planet and these people...

1104
01:38:02,379 --> 01:38:04,048
...have changed me.

1105
01:38:05,868 --> 01:38:09,650
The cost of Arishem's design,
it's not worth it.

1106
01:38:10,142 --> 01:38:11,486
Not this time.

1107
01:38:13,283 --> 01:38:14,993
I trust you, Ajak.

1108
01:38:19,233 --> 01:38:21,174
I'll follow you to the end,

1109
01:38:22,361 --> 01:38:23,862
as I always have.

1110
01:38:23,887 --> 01:38:25,265
Thank you.

1111
01:38:27,299 --> 01:38:29,260
We have to bring everyone back together.

1112
01:38:31,724 --> 01:38:33,892
There's something
I have to show you first.

1113
01:38:44,727 --> 01:38:46,395
It's just up ahead.

1114
01:38:53,894 --> 01:38:56,563
They must have been trapped
in the ice for centuries

1115
01:38:56,588 --> 01:38:59,533
and broke free last week
when the glacier started to melt

1116
01:38:59,558 --> 01:39:02,323
as the Earth's core heats up
for the emergence.

1117
01:39:03,462 --> 01:39:06,066
They killed an entire company
of oil workers.

1118
01:39:06,608 --> 01:39:08,181
I tracked them here.

1119
01:39:11,894 --> 01:39:14,369
I suspected 
you might have changed your mind.

1120
01:39:15,405 --> 01:39:17,408
I can't let you betray Arishem.

1121
01:39:19,148 --> 01:39:21,430
Why don't you just kill me yourself?

1122
01:39:21,455 --> 01:39:24,377
When the others realize
something is happening to the Earth,

1123
01:39:25,159 --> 01:39:26,357
they'll come to you.

1124
01:39:27,092 --> 01:39:30,018
When they find your body,
they'll know the Deviants are back.

1125
01:39:30,353 --> 01:39:32,783
It'll keep them busy until the emergence.

1126
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:36,783
I've been loyal to you, Ajak.

1127
01:39:37,392 --> 01:39:39,517
Kept your secret for centuries,

1128
01:39:40,038 --> 01:39:42,572
lied to everyone I cared about,

1129
01:39:43,076 --> 01:39:47,824
but never have I doubted my purpose
to serve the Celestials.

1130
01:39:48,383 --> 01:39:50,244
Oh, Ikaris.

1131
01:39:55,206 --> 01:39:57,674
I've led you down the wrong path.

1132
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:00,377
It's the only path I know.

1133
01:42:54,017 --> 01:42:55,977
Thought I'd find you here.

1134
01:42:56,439 --> 01:42:58,655
I've thought about this place a lot.

1135
01:43:00,146 --> 01:43:02,480
Amazing how things change over time.

1136
01:43:03,089 --> 01:43:05,216
Maybe we're the ones who've changed.

1137
01:43:08,191 --> 01:43:10,202
I know you don't agree with our plan.

1138
01:43:10,937 --> 01:43:13,748
I've always thought of the Celestials
like the ocean.

1139
01:43:15,859 --> 01:43:18,999
They give life and they take life away 
without bias.

1140
01:43:19,918 --> 01:43:22,468
If they were gone, 
this universe would eventually end.

1141
01:43:23,114 --> 01:43:25,706
What you're trying to do
is free humanity from the natural order.

1142
01:43:25,731 --> 01:43:29,545
It's not natural to allow all life on
an entire planet to be destroyed.

1143
01:43:30,122 --> 01:43:32,148
Arishem's way is archaic and violent.

1144
01:43:32,173 --> 01:43:33,929
I don't want to fight, Sersi.

1145
01:43:34,726 --> 01:43:35,927
It'll all end soon.

1146
01:43:35,952 --> 01:43:38,359
Except there is no end, is there?

1147
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:41,664
We'd carry on without our memories

1148
01:43:41,689 --> 01:43:44,867
or free will for eternity.

1149
01:43:50,859 --> 01:43:52,235
You're afraid.

1150
01:43:52,495 --> 01:43:54,695
I wouldn't mind leaving this world.

1151
01:43:55,864 --> 01:43:57,824
I only wish that when we do,

1152
01:43:59,439 --> 01:44:01,468
I would be able to remember you.

1153
01:44:03,613 --> 01:44:05,741
I'm in love with you, Sersi.

1154
01:44:06,580 --> 01:44:09,116
I'm grateful for the life 
I've lived with you.

1155
01:44:15,601 --> 01:44:16,780
Ikaris.

1156
01:44:41,643 --> 01:44:42,936
Sersi?

1157
01:44:47,010 --> 01:44:48,637
It's started.

1158
01:44:51,961 --> 01:44:53,747
Oh, no. My God.

1159
01:44:54,163 --> 01:44:55,270
What about the Uni-Mind?

1160
01:44:55,673 --> 01:44:58,446
I haven't figured out a way
to connect us, but I'm close.

1161
01:44:58,471 --> 01:45:00,337
- I'm very, very close.
- How much longer?

1162
01:45:00,362 --> 01:45:01,805
I don't know, Sersi!

1163
01:45:05,642 --> 01:45:06,976
Find the point of emergence.

1164
01:45:30,687 --> 01:45:33,176
You always knew the end was coming.

1165
01:45:33,350 --> 01:45:35,715
It must be a relief.

1166
01:45:36,154 --> 01:45:38,247
That Deviant is still tracking us.

1167
01:45:38,959 --> 01:45:41,520
Revenge won't bring peace for you, Thena.

1168
01:45:42,136 --> 01:45:44,067
But killing it might.

1169
01:45:57,294 --> 01:45:58,712
Ikaris?

1170
01:46:00,145 --> 01:46:01,605
What are you doing?

1171
01:46:07,602 --> 01:46:10,090
I wanted you to leave this world in peace.

1172
01:46:11,708 --> 01:46:14,085
Without knowing about the emergence.

1173
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:16,045
But I failed.

1174
01:46:19,851 --> 01:46:21,560
I wish Ajak hadn't chosen you.

1175
01:46:28,753 --> 01:46:30,088
I'm close to figuring it out.

1176
01:46:34,545 --> 01:46:35,838
Boss, what are you doing?

1177
01:46:35,863 --> 01:46:37,637
I've let this go on long enough.

1178
01:46:37,662 --> 01:46:38,934
Don't hurt him!

1179
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:42,225
He lied to us.

1180
01:46:43,242 --> 01:46:45,059
He already knew about the emergence.

1181
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:46,974
No, he didn't.

1182
01:46:47,204 --> 01:46:49,755
Ajak told me everything
when we left Babylon.

1183
01:46:51,330 --> 01:46:52,331
What?

1184
01:46:53,222 --> 01:46:55,558
You were never gonna let us
stop the emergence.

1185
01:46:55,655 --> 01:46:56,656
No.

1186
01:46:58,058 --> 01:47:00,669
I only wanted to protect you
from the Deviants.

1187
01:47:00,694 --> 01:47:04,231
If Ajak wanted you to take her place,
why did she choose me?

1188
01:47:09,429 --> 01:47:10,680
What have you done?

1189
01:47:11,976 --> 01:47:13,465
He killed her.

1190
01:47:16,355 --> 01:47:17,497
I had to.

1191
01:47:18,775 --> 01:47:20,442
She loved you.

1192
01:47:23,446 --> 01:47:25,114
- Did she?
- She loved you.

1193
01:47:27,312 --> 01:47:29,755
Do you think 
it was easy to live with the truth?

1194
01:47:30,828 --> 01:47:32,830
To know that one day all this would end?

1195
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:36,872
To keep on lying to you?

1196
01:47:38,674 --> 01:47:41,022
If we gave humanity the choice,

1197
01:47:41,047 --> 01:47:46,076
how many of them would be willing to die 
so that billions more could be born?

1198
01:47:46,101 --> 01:47:48,356
We're not giving them a choice.

1199
01:47:49,417 --> 01:47:52,003
Is this why you're willing to kill?

1200
01:47:53,810 --> 01:47:56,479
You are so pathetic!

1201
01:47:56,864 --> 01:47:58,958
I'm an Eternal, Phastos.

1202
01:47:59,707 --> 01:48:02,528
I exist for Arishem.

1203
01:48:02,948 --> 01:48:04,199
As do you.

1204
01:48:04,779 --> 01:48:05,878
It's who you are.

1205
01:48:05,903 --> 01:48:12,887
I wouldn't change a single thing
about who I am. Born or made.

1206
01:48:12,912 --> 01:48:15,373
But I do not exist for Arishem,

1207
01:48:15,398 --> 01:48:17,358
I exist for my family!

1208
01:48:17,383 --> 01:48:19,802
Then you are making
the same mistake Ajak did.

1209
01:48:23,047 --> 01:48:24,257
- No!
- Makkari!

1210
01:48:26,490 --> 01:48:27,950
Get out of here!

1211
01:48:31,018 --> 01:48:32,394
Kingo.

1212
01:48:40,312 --> 01:48:42,807
You do not turn against your family.

1213
01:48:43,768 --> 01:48:46,096
Gilgamesh died because of you.

1214
01:48:48,126 --> 01:48:49,586
You won't succeed against me.

1215
01:48:50,462 --> 01:48:52,900
And I will kill every one of you 
if I have to.

1216
01:49:00,936 --> 01:49:02,062
Wait.

1217
01:49:03,045 --> 01:49:04,088
I'm going with you.

1218
01:49:04,223 --> 01:49:05,266
Sprite...

1219
01:49:07,091 --> 01:49:08,134
What is this?

1220
01:49:25,524 --> 01:49:27,358
Because she loves him.

1221
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:31,583
Oh, you guys didn't pick up on that?

1222
01:49:32,729 --> 01:49:34,817
He really fooled us, didn't he?

1223
01:49:35,906 --> 01:49:37,199
Karun, let's go.

1224
01:49:37,788 --> 01:49:39,140
Wait, where the hell are you going?

1225
01:49:39,165 --> 01:49:40,802
I can't help you guys.

1226
01:49:42,084 --> 01:49:43,677
I still think Ikaris is right.

1227
01:49:43,831 --> 01:49:46,333
So, that's it, huh? Just gonna follow him?

1228
01:49:47,683 --> 01:49:49,685
I love the people of this planet.

1229
01:49:50,190 --> 01:49:52,484
But if you stop this emergence,

1230
01:49:52,509 --> 01:49:56,544
you are preventing so many other worlds
like this one from being created.

1231
01:49:57,475 --> 01:49:59,310
I still have faith in Arishem.

1232
01:49:59,706 --> 01:50:02,708
But I refuse to hurt any of you 
for my beliefs.

1233
01:50:08,817 --> 01:50:11,403
Even with my help, we're no match.

1234
01:50:12,169 --> 01:50:13,677
It's Ikaris.

1235
01:50:17,286 --> 01:50:18,287
But...

1236
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:20,957
...I hope to see you on the next planet.

1237
01:50:48,649 --> 01:50:49,650
Look,

1238
01:50:50,333 --> 01:50:53,336
if I'm gonna get myself killed
going up against Ikaris,

1239
01:50:54,017 --> 01:50:55,894
we'll need to have a backup plan.

1240
01:50:56,259 --> 01:50:57,969
All of our powers,
even if they're amplified,

1241
01:50:57,994 --> 01:50:59,537
are not enough to kill a Celestial, so...

1242
01:50:59,562 --> 01:51:02,105
Well, Sersi did turn a Deviant into a tree.

1243
01:51:03,186 --> 01:51:04,349
I'm sorry, what?

1244
01:51:04,792 --> 01:51:06,145
You didn't wanna tell me that?

1245
01:51:08,397 --> 01:51:12,550
I don't know how it happened, okay?
And I'm pretty sure I couldn't do it again.

1246
01:51:12,575 --> 01:51:15,403
Well, now is the time to try, 
don't you think?

1247
01:51:15,428 --> 01:51:17,388
Phastos, that Deviant is dead.

1248
01:51:17,413 --> 01:51:20,625
Our plan is to put Tiamut to sleep, 
not to kill it.

1249
01:51:20,650 --> 01:51:22,451
I can't kill a Celestial.

1250
01:51:22,476 --> 01:51:24,103
Sersi. Sersi.

1251
01:51:24,128 --> 01:51:25,505
We can't!

1252
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:32,628
We can't.

1253
01:51:32,746 --> 01:51:34,290
It's okay, Sersi.

1254
01:51:35,641 --> 01:51:37,017
I got this.

1255
01:51:53,271 --> 01:51:54,897
There's no time for that.

1256
01:51:56,135 --> 01:51:58,575
I didn't see the lies right in front of me.

1257
01:52:00,084 --> 01:52:02,888
I'm not even sure
why Ajak chose me to lead.

1258
01:52:04,474 --> 01:52:08,700
I asked Gilgamesh once
why he chose to protect me.

1259
01:52:09,067 --> 01:52:10,486
He said,

1260
01:52:10,998 --> 01:52:14,427
"When you love something, you protect it.

1261
01:52:15,162 --> 01:52:19,692
"It is the most natural thing
in the world."

1262
01:52:22,429 --> 01:52:26,975
You have loved these people
since the day we arrived.

1263
01:52:28,391 --> 01:52:33,981
So, there is no one better
to lead us now than you.

1264
01:52:36,144 --> 01:52:37,438
Sersi.

1265
01:52:39,774 --> 01:52:41,109
Get up.

1266
01:52:49,073 --> 01:52:51,419
Ajak chose you for a reason.

1267
01:52:56,607 --> 01:52:57,857
Sersi!

1268
01:52:58,309 --> 01:52:59,352
Sersi!

1269
01:52:59,573 --> 01:53:01,300
Oh, Sersi. We need you!

1270
01:53:01,325 --> 01:53:02,869
I already gave that speech.

1271
01:53:02,894 --> 01:53:03,937
What?

1272
01:53:04,072 --> 01:53:05,323
You did... What...

1273
01:53:05,499 --> 01:53:08,502
Sersi, the sphere inside of you,

1274
01:53:08,527 --> 01:53:10,427
it creates a connection
between you and Arishem.

1275
01:53:10,624 --> 01:53:13,753
Maybe I can repurpose it

1276
01:53:13,778 --> 01:53:16,761
and create a connection between, uh,

1277
01:53:16,786 --> 01:53:17,787
well, all of us.

1278
01:53:17,866 --> 01:53:20,310
And that can activate the Uni-Mind.

1279
01:53:20,335 --> 01:53:22,004
- Great.
- Yeah.

1280
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:24,008
But, um...

1281
01:53:24,927 --> 01:53:26,895
...I have to take it out of you.

1282
01:53:29,896 --> 01:53:31,105
Okay.

1283
01:53:32,551 --> 01:53:33,637
Do it.

1284
01:53:35,317 --> 01:53:36,444
Okay.

1285
01:53:44,381 --> 01:53:45,833
Don't kill her.

1286
01:53:46,203 --> 01:53:47,413
Thena...

1287
01:53:48,665 --> 01:53:49,708
Do it.

1288
01:54:03,274 --> 01:54:04,568
Will it work?

1289
01:54:09,312 --> 01:54:10,815
It has to.

1290
01:55:02,488 --> 01:55:04,281
I'm glad you're here.

1291
01:55:08,490 --> 01:55:10,075
Thank you, Sprite.

1292
01:55:25,067 --> 01:55:26,736
Protect the emergence.

1293
01:55:26,930 --> 01:55:28,604
You're really gonna kill them?

1294
01:55:36,519 --> 01:55:38,062
Where's Druig?

1295
01:55:38,637 --> 01:55:39,846
He's busy.

1296
01:55:39,871 --> 01:55:42,104
Thena, play nice.

1297
01:55:45,949 --> 01:55:47,324
You've never had to fight me.

1298
01:55:47,349 --> 01:55:48,617
But I've always wanted to.

1299
01:55:56,925 --> 01:55:59,018
It's time to put a god to sleep.

1300
01:57:06,409 --> 01:57:08,455
I should've done this five centuries ago.

1301
01:57:55,664 --> 01:57:57,164
Druig's gone.

1302
01:57:58,153 --> 01:57:59,529
It's over.

1303
01:59:07,058 --> 01:59:08,059
Phastos.

1304
01:59:12,362 --> 01:59:14,157
I have to try and stop this.

1305
01:59:14,323 --> 01:59:16,034
I need to get closer to Tiamut.

1306
01:59:16,201 --> 01:59:18,161
- Keep Ikaris busy.
- We've got you.

1307
01:59:18,186 --> 01:59:19,330
Go.

1308
01:59:27,856 --> 01:59:28,908
Enough.

1309
01:59:59,244 --> 02:00:00,494
Thena, stop!

1310
02:00:32,609 --> 02:00:33,987
Why are you helping Ikaris?

1311
02:00:34,581 --> 02:00:36,230
We can't let it absorb our powers.

1312
02:00:37,573 --> 02:00:38,700
Too late.

1313
02:00:40,326 --> 02:00:42,464
Thena, he's trying to goad you. Don't...

1314
02:00:59,251 --> 02:01:00,331
Makkari!

1315
02:01:08,935 --> 02:01:10,238
Where's Sersi?

1316
02:01:10,457 --> 02:01:12,626
You always did underestimate her.

1317
02:01:14,235 --> 02:01:15,485
Oh, no.

1318
02:01:16,321 --> 02:01:17,706
Not so fast.

1319
02:01:22,211 --> 02:01:23,464
Boss.

1320
02:01:27,739 --> 02:01:30,800
I don't know about you,
but this is really satisfying, right?

1321
02:01:30,825 --> 02:01:33,437
Let me go, Phastos! 
I can't let her do this!

1322
02:01:33,462 --> 02:01:34,756
I don't think so.

1323
02:01:35,026 --> 02:01:38,579
I've been wanting to clip your wings
for a long time, Ikaris!

1324
02:01:52,088 --> 02:01:53,089
Thena.

1325
02:01:55,581 --> 02:01:58,191
Oh, you've changed.

1326
02:01:59,948 --> 02:02:01,573
You're broken.

1327
02:02:02,257 --> 02:02:03,758
Damaged.

1328
02:02:04,373 --> 02:02:06,089
Useless.

1329
02:02:08,522 --> 02:02:12,361
You can't protect any of them.

1330
02:02:26,317 --> 02:02:27,694
Sersi.

1331
02:02:32,439 --> 02:02:35,196
You're not powerful enough to do this.

1332
02:02:35,496 --> 02:02:37,219
And you won't.

1333
02:02:37,878 --> 02:02:39,630
You're not a killer.

1334
02:02:39,766 --> 02:02:41,350
Maybe I've changed.

1335
02:02:41,990 --> 02:02:44,415
And is this really who you are, Sprite?

1336
02:02:44,616 --> 02:02:47,245
Are you really willing to let
everyone on this planet die?

1337
02:02:55,771 --> 02:02:57,565
I'm sorry, Sersi.

1338
02:03:10,043 --> 02:03:12,048
I've always envied you, Sersi.

1339
02:03:14,502 --> 02:03:18,189
'Cause you get to live as one of them.
And I never could.

1340
02:03:19,518 --> 02:03:21,771
You know why I hated living with humans?

1341
02:03:22,293 --> 02:03:25,088
Because they reminded me of things
I didn't even know I wanted.

1342
02:03:25,465 --> 02:03:28,634
Because of them, now I wanna know
what it feels like to grow up.

1343
02:03:29,855 --> 02:03:31,565
To fall in love.

1344
02:03:32,395 --> 02:03:34,023
To have a family.

1345
02:03:35,362 --> 02:03:38,969
And to know, in the end, I've lived.

1346
02:03:46,387 --> 02:03:47,513
It's all over now.

1347
02:03:48,190 --> 02:03:50,526
We get to start over somewhere new.

1348
02:03:54,603 --> 02:03:56,372
Well, that was very moving.

1349
02:03:56,397 --> 02:03:57,648
Druig.

1350
02:04:03,283 --> 02:04:04,827
I can't do this.

1351
02:04:08,322 --> 02:04:10,199
This is your fight now.

1352
02:04:54,847 --> 02:04:56,056
Thena.

1353
02:04:57,542 --> 02:04:58,793
It's me.

1354
02:04:59,377 --> 02:05:00,545
Gilgamesh.

1355
02:05:01,892 --> 02:05:03,063
Look at me.

1356
02:05:04,001 --> 02:05:05,294
Gilgamesh?

1357
02:05:05,429 --> 02:05:06,972
Stay here.

1358
02:05:09,605 --> 02:05:10,856
Say it.

1359
02:05:11,556 --> 02:05:13,224
Stay here.

1360
02:05:14,100 --> 02:05:15,810
You'll be okay.

1361
02:05:17,809 --> 02:05:19,454
Give me your hand.

1362
02:05:32,748 --> 02:05:34,131
Ah, it's a shame.

1363
02:05:35,953 --> 02:05:37,580
You and I,

1364
02:05:38,306 --> 02:05:40,514
we're just tools of a god.

1365
02:05:41,711 --> 02:05:44,922
Built to kill.

1366
02:05:47,562 --> 02:05:48,814
Thena.

1367
02:05:52,400 --> 02:05:53,777
Remember.

1368
02:06:24,295 --> 02:06:25,787
I remember.

1369
02:07:55,303 --> 02:07:56,763
Come on, Sersi.

1370
02:07:57,805 --> 02:07:58,889
Come on.

1371
02:10:07,917 --> 02:10:09,669
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1372
02:12:38,799 --> 02:12:40,342
I'm sorry.

1373
02:12:41,935 --> 02:12:43,395
I know.

1374
02:13:59,291 --> 02:14:00,334
How?

1375
02:14:00,630 --> 02:14:02,005
How did you do it?

1376
02:14:03,295 --> 02:14:06,548
When I touched Tiamut's palm,
I felt energy surging into me.

1377
02:14:06,802 --> 02:14:09,358
Tiamut joined our Uni-Mind.

1378
02:14:09,383 --> 02:14:11,990
I always wondered how we survived
the destruction of other planets

1379
02:14:12,014 --> 02:14:13,424
that we were on.

1380
02:15:20,329 --> 02:15:21,538
Is he gone?

1381
02:15:31,092 --> 02:15:32,342
Sprite.

1382
02:15:34,801 --> 02:15:37,170
I still have energy from the Uni-Mind.

1383
02:15:37,889 --> 02:15:40,059
I think I can make you human.

1384
02:15:42,038 --> 02:15:44,958
All the things you said you wanted, 
you can have them.

1385
02:15:45,124 --> 02:15:47,960
But your time will be fleeting
and you'll die one day.

1386
02:15:47,985 --> 02:15:49,194
Are you ready for that?

1387
02:15:51,346 --> 02:15:52,765
I am.

1388
02:16:30,307 --> 02:16:34,214
The sudden appearance of an
enormous stone figure in the Indian Ocean

1389
02:16:34,239 --> 02:16:37,884
has left more questions than answers
for authorities.

1390
02:16:37,909 --> 02:16:41,411
U.S. and Australian naval ships
are maintaining defensive positions,

1391
02:16:41,436 --> 02:16:42,437
but at this...

1392
02:16:42,462 --> 02:16:44,128
You guys did that?

1393
02:16:45,235 --> 02:16:47,363
I love you so much.

1394
02:16:54,735 --> 02:16:56,111
Are you okay?

1395
02:16:57,154 --> 02:16:59,156
I get confused sometimes.

1396
02:16:59,387 --> 02:17:01,431
Yeah. Me, too.

1397
02:17:04,033 --> 02:17:06,438
So, Dad said you're the goddess Athena.

1398
02:17:06,603 --> 02:17:08,690
"Thena". Drop the "A".

1399
02:17:09,344 --> 02:17:11,016
- Oh.
- Hmm.

1400
02:17:11,450 --> 02:17:13,285
What's your superpower?

1401
02:17:16,737 --> 02:17:19,602
Um, can you just... Look... One second.

1402
02:17:20,253 --> 02:17:21,879
Okay. All right.

1403
02:17:22,458 --> 02:17:24,169
See, that thing is... Okay.

1404
02:17:24,194 --> 02:17:26,163
Almost gave you a shave and a haircut, 
didn't she?

1405
02:17:26,184 --> 02:17:27,642
Stand behind me, actually.

1406
02:17:27,667 --> 02:17:31,487
Um, you remember earmuffs? Remember how
we practiced earmuffs? Thank you so much.

1407
02:17:33,587 --> 02:17:36,254
You know that your babysitting privileges
are completely revoked, right?

1408
02:17:36,279 --> 02:17:37,511
Like, it's done.

1409
02:17:37,883 --> 02:17:38,785
Thank you.

1410
02:17:39,134 --> 02:17:41,994
Violence... Hey.
Violence is never the answer.

1411
02:17:42,015 --> 02:17:43,157
- Right, T?
- Hmm.

1412
02:17:43,182 --> 02:17:45,810
You gotta always use your brain, hmm?

1413
02:17:45,835 --> 02:17:47,693
Like you did fighting on the beach?

1414
02:17:47,718 --> 02:17:51,480
Your dad spoke calmly and firmly
to the bad guy

1415
02:17:51,505 --> 02:17:55,630
and he had no choice but to listen to me, 
so no violence.

1416
02:17:58,061 --> 02:18:00,250
When is that happening?
That's happening soon, right?

1417
02:18:00,664 --> 02:18:02,285
Ah, yes, there's Druig.

1418
02:18:02,310 --> 02:18:03,854
- Don't go anywhere near him.
- Oh!

1419
02:18:04,327 --> 02:18:05,453
Yeah!

1420
02:18:07,756 --> 02:18:09,474
Okay, that's far enough, Jack.

1421
02:18:09,499 --> 02:18:11,899
Wow, Dad, the Domo's so cool.

1422
02:18:11,924 --> 02:18:13,551
Your dad fixed that with his bare hands.

1423
02:18:13,640 --> 02:18:15,225
Can we go to space, too, one day?

1424
02:18:15,250 --> 02:18:17,860
Let's wait till 
you get your learner's permit, okay?

1425
02:18:18,746 --> 02:18:20,164
Hey, Phastos.

1426
02:18:20,858 --> 02:18:22,233
Take care.

1427
02:18:22,829 --> 02:18:24,412
This world is lucky to have you.

1428
02:18:25,139 --> 02:18:26,344
Thank you.

1429
02:18:26,947 --> 02:18:28,615
I know you're not a hugger, so...

1430
02:18:31,883 --> 02:18:33,008
Okay.

1431
02:18:35,914 --> 02:18:39,977
You think when we find
the other Eternals out there,

1432
02:18:40,074 --> 02:18:43,077
that they'll accept the truth
the way we did?

1433
02:19:00,924 --> 02:19:02,634
Told you that thing was addictive.

1434
02:19:03,937 --> 02:19:04,980
Please visit?

1435
02:19:05,473 --> 02:19:06,683
I'll try.

1436
02:19:07,227 --> 02:19:08,851
When I get time off from school.

1437
02:19:08,876 --> 02:19:11,722
Oh, wow. Listen, it's gonna be good
for you to be in a human environment.

1438
02:19:11,747 --> 02:19:13,541
You'll pick up some social skills.

1439
02:19:14,190 --> 02:19:15,524
Oh, you didn't think you needed those?

1440
02:19:16,690 --> 02:19:18,692
That explains so much.

1441
02:19:28,346 --> 02:19:29,890
Gonna miss you.

1442
02:19:30,558 --> 02:19:31,767
Me, too.

1443
02:19:35,366 --> 02:19:36,494
Madam.

1444
02:19:37,116 --> 02:19:38,409
Thanks, Karun.

1445
02:19:38,930 --> 02:19:41,250
Sometimes I wonder 
if we did the right thing.

1446
02:19:43,042 --> 02:19:44,274
Killing Tiamut.

1447
02:19:44,299 --> 02:19:46,016
It's too late for that.

1448
02:19:46,347 --> 02:19:48,307
But you followed your heart.

1449
02:19:48,332 --> 02:19:49,792
We all did.

1450
02:19:52,145 --> 02:19:53,266
Even Ikaris.

1451
02:20:00,632 --> 02:20:02,592
Looks like someone's waiting for you.

1452
02:20:03,564 --> 02:20:05,691
He's a lot cuter in person.

1453
02:20:08,228 --> 02:20:11,382
So, after all that, 
you still can't change me into a giraffe?

1454
02:20:12,079 --> 02:20:15,986
Well, I could 
next time I'm connected to a Celestial

1455
02:20:16,011 --> 02:20:18,438
during an emergence
whilst performing a Uni-Mind.

1456
02:20:18,463 --> 02:20:21,257
Yeah. That sounds like a "no" to me.

1457
02:20:25,149 --> 02:20:26,733
What'll you do now?

1458
02:20:26,758 --> 02:20:28,051
Not sure.

1459
02:20:28,264 --> 02:20:30,266
This planet's my home, but...

1460
02:20:31,971 --> 02:20:34,475
...I can't pretend to be human anymore.

1461
02:20:40,948 --> 02:20:42,533
I love you, Sersi.

1462
02:20:44,342 --> 02:20:45,592
I don't care what you are.

1463
02:20:59,271 --> 02:21:01,899
Remember when we talked about
no more secrets?

1464
02:21:02,038 --> 02:21:05,093
I have no more secrets, I promise.

1465
02:21:05,118 --> 02:21:08,999
Actually, I have one I want to tell you.

1466
02:21:10,255 --> 02:21:11,592
What is it?

1467
02:21:13,807 --> 02:21:16,377
It turns out my family history is...

1468
02:21:17,022 --> 02:21:18,607
...complicated.

1469
02:21:22,276 --> 02:21:23,653
Sersi?

1470
02:21:24,382 --> 02:21:25,884
Sersi, what's wrong?

1471
02:21:27,272 --> 02:21:28,607
Sersi?

1472
02:21:52,567 --> 02:21:53,944
Sersi?

1473
02:21:54,851 --> 02:21:56,102
Sersi?

1474
02:21:56,939 --> 02:21:58,827
Sersi!

1475
02:22:13,803 --> 02:22:19,815
You have chosen to sacrifice a Celestial
for the people of this planet.

1476
02:22:21,290 --> 02:22:23,084
I will spare them,

1477
02:22:23,109 --> 02:22:27,822
but your memories will show
if they are worthy to live.

1478
02:22:29,383 --> 02:22:33,595
And I will return for judgment.

1479
02:22:49,066 --> 02:22:50,639
You all right, Ted?

1480
02:22:52,867 --> 02:22:54,514
Did you see that?

1481
02:26:04,181 --> 02:26:05,516
Arishem.

1482
02:26:07,827 --> 02:26:09,538
We have to go back.

1483
02:26:22,363 --> 02:26:23,588
What?

1484
02:26:36,800 --> 02:26:38,067
Wow.

1485
02:26:38,092 --> 02:26:41,506
Aah! My ears. My eyes are numb.

1486
02:26:41,531 --> 02:26:44,367
No more drunk teleporting for you.

1487
02:26:44,493 --> 02:26:45,584
Um...

1488
02:26:45,609 --> 02:26:46,777
Hang on, hang on.

1489
02:26:52,774 --> 02:26:54,191
Behold,

1490
02:26:54,860 --> 02:26:57,586
the royal prince of Titan,

1491
02:26:57,611 --> 02:27:00,954
brother of Thanos, the Knave of Hearts,

1492
02:27:00,979 --> 02:27:04,074
defeater of Black Robert...

1493
02:27:04,099 --> 02:27:05,435
Roger.

1494
02:27:05,607 --> 02:27:06,688
Oh.

1495
02:27:07,219 --> 02:27:10,031
Defeater of Black Roger.

1496
02:27:10,374 --> 02:27:12,070
The great adventurer,

1497
02:27:12,095 --> 02:27:16,016
Starfox of Mystery Planet.

1498
02:27:16,699 --> 02:27:19,164
What a pleasure to make your acquaintance,

1499
02:27:19,467 --> 02:27:21,343
my fellow Eternals.

1500
02:27:22,444 --> 02:27:24,723
You know, you really don't have
to do the whole thing every time.

1501
02:27:24,753 --> 02:27:27,266
Everything you do is impressive.
What am I gonna leave off the list?

1502
02:27:27,291 --> 02:27:28,547
- No, I know it's impressive. 
- Who are you?

1503
02:27:30,767 --> 02:27:31,894
I'm Eros.

1504
02:27:32,271 --> 02:27:33,352
This is Pip.

1505
02:27:33,732 --> 02:27:37,063
And you are as beautiful
as legends say, Thena.

1506
02:27:37,291 --> 02:27:38,649
What do you want, lads?

1507
02:27:38,674 --> 02:27:40,609
Pip and I are here to help, aren't we?

1508
02:27:45,782 --> 02:27:47,867
Your friends are in big trouble.

1509
02:27:49,465 --> 02:27:51,551
And we know where to find them.

1510
02:34:43,036 --> 02:34:44,598
You can do this.

1511
02:34:45,735 --> 02:34:47,371
You can do this.

1512
02:35:11,856 --> 02:35:13,358
I'm sorry.

1513
02:35:15,470 --> 02:35:17,137
I have to try.

1514
02:35:31,250 --> 02:35:33,754
Sure you're ready for that, Mr. Whitman?
