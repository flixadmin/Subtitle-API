Stay back. Thank you.

312
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:00,599
- [HUGHIE] New bling?
- Mm-hm.

313
00:19:00,683 --> 00:19:02,268
Donna got it for me.

314
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,313
I'm pretty sure she got it at Duane Reade.

315
00:19:07,315 --> 00:19:14,280
Oh, gosh, moms.
The gift that keeps on giving. Forever.

316
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:18,409
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

317
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,953
Oh, no, it's fine.

318
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:24,832
No. No. I'm an asshole for bitching
about my mom when yours is...

319
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:29,045
My mom's not dead.

320
00:19:29,712 --> 00:19:33,090
She's not? Oh, it's just
you never mentioned her, so...

321
00:19:33,174 --> 00:19:35,259
She left when I was six.

322
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:37,845
Oh, wow, shit.

323
00:19:39,305 --> 00:19:40,556
I'm really sorry.

324
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:44,435
That's where Billy Joel comes from.

325
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:48,939
She and I, we used to have
these dance parties.

326
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:50,441
She was fun.

327
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:54,111
She made awesome
Seven costumes for Halloween.

328
00:19:55,363 --> 00:20:00,576
And then one day,
she just left and never called again.

329
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:01,869
Not even a card.

330
00:20:03,162 --> 00:20:06,207
You know, it was like some
silent alarm went off and she was, like,

331
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:10,127
"Well, fuck them, time to go."

332
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:13,130
No, I'm sure that that's not it.

333
00:20:13,214 --> 00:20:14,632
What would you call it?

334
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:21,764
I guess that's why I always
just kind of hang in there,

335
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:23,391
no matter how bad it gets.

336
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:29,021
'Cause I don't want to be like her.

337
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:35,611
That's kind of clingy and pathetic,
isn't it?

338
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:38,906
No. No. It isn't.

339
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,990
At all.

340
00:20:43,661 --> 00:20:44,661
What's up, shitbirds?

341
00:20:44,662 --> 00:20:46,038
[BOTH SCREAM]

342
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:52,002
What the fuck? What the fuck?

343
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:54,171
- How did you find us?
- Please.

344
00:20:54,255 --> 00:20:57,133
I can cover the boroughs in three hours.
I went looking, that's all.

345
00:20:57,216 --> 00:21:00,219
- I'm surprised your heart can take it.
- My heart is just fine.

346
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:03,848
- Take a step closer and I'll show you.
- Hey, I saved your life, asshole.

347
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:05,349
Now you're coming after us?

348
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:12,273
We're even now, bitch.

349
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:18,863
Holy shit!

350
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,488
Is this true?

351
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:22,491
Everything makes more sense now,
doesn't it?

352
00:21:22,575 --> 00:21:26,245
- Where did you get this?
- I didn't get it, okay? I was never here.

353
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,913
You got that shit on your own. Yeah?

354
00:21:27,997 --> 00:21:29,707
But why are you doing this?

355
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:33,544
'Cause I want back in, so I need her gone.

356
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:35,754
Fuck that Nazi bitch.

357
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:06,452
Would you ask Mario if he could whip up
some of those Gruyère puffs?

358
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:09,580
Would you like an order?
They're worth the cheat day.

359
00:22:10,623 --> 00:22:14,084
I assume you got a man out there,
with a clean shot?

360
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:15,586
More than one.

361
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:18,214
Then I'll skip the fucking hors d'oeuvres,
if you don't mind,

362
00:22:18,297 --> 00:22:20,007
and we'll just cut straight to it, yeah?

363
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:23,969
You mentioned on the phone
that you could help with Homelander's son.

364
00:22:24,053 --> 00:22:27,264
I must say, I'm not sure what you mean.

365
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:31,560
That boy is your only possible
contingency against Homelander.

366
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:37,983
Now, that contingency don't work
if they're off playing Ward and the Beav.

367
00:22:39,485 --> 00:22:40,485
I can fix that.

368
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:45,741
Thank you, Alvin.

369
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:50,829
Homelander's a friend.
Why would I betray him?

370
00:22:51,956 --> 00:22:53,541
Because you're a ruthless bastard.

371
00:22:56,669 --> 00:22:57,585
That's hurtful.

372
00:22:57,586 --> 00:23:01,048
You turned a racist piece of shite
into America's sweetheart.

373
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:02,925
Now, what word would you use?

374
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:14,228
Stormfront's good at making people angry.

375
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:19,483
Angry people want Compound V.
Compound V raises our stock price.

376
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:24,822
I'd have preferred V remained a secret,
but we play with the cards we're dealt.

377
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:29,326
It's not ruthless, it's prices per share.
That's all.

378
00:23:30,202 --> 00:23:33,038
Maybe you should
take a look in the mirror, mate.

379
00:23:33,122 --> 00:23:35,082
'Cause that bitch should bother you.

380
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:39,044
Of course she does, but it's not about me.

381
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:45,509
I can't lash out
like some raging, entitled maniac.

382
00:23:46,427 --> 00:23:48,345
That's a white man's luxury.

383
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:53,267
So it's just business then, eh?

384
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:58,606
When, Mr. Butcher, in history
has it ever been about anything different?

385
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:05,362
And what makes you think
that you can control that racist bitch?

386
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:09,033
Look, I've got to get across town...

387
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:11,910
I can get the boy away from Homelander,
all right?

388
00:24:11,994 --> 00:24:12,994
How?

389
00:24:14,163 --> 00:24:15,414
That's my business.

390
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:20,878
When I got him, I'll call your people,

391
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:24,548
they zero in on this cell signal,
and come and scoop him up.

392
00:24:24,632 --> 00:24:28,385
And then you do a better fucking job
hiding him this time, yeah?

393
00:24:30,429 --> 00:24:31,513
You have my word.

394
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:34,391
I will get Rebecca and Ryan
somewhere safe.

395
00:24:34,475 --> 00:24:37,811
No. Not Becca. Becca stays with me.

396
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:42,149
But that's the whole point,
that he's raised by his mother.

397
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:45,319
Find him a new fucking mum.
I'm taking my wife back.

398
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:46,695
That's the deal.

399
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:49,990
And what happens when Rebecca
shows up at my doorstep,

400
00:24:50,074 --> 00:24:52,826
begging to be reunited with her boy?

401
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,750
You say it's the only way
you can guarantee

402
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,335
Ryan's protection from Homelander.

403
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:03,295
'Cause as you know,

404
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,385
a mother will do anything
to protect her son.

405
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,889
And you call me a ruthless bastard.

406
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:15,683
You tell me where he is...

407
00:25:17,685 --> 00:25:19,269
and I'll do the rest.

408
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:37,538
- Where's Ryan?
- He's inside.

409
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:40,624
- He doesn't want to talk.
- So go in, anyway.

410
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:44,044
No, no, no. I've tried.
He wants to be left alone.

411
00:25:44,128 --> 00:25:48,507
You are the strongest man in the world,
and you're scared of a little boy.

412
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:50,384
He's your blood.

413
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:52,302
Just talk to him.

414
00:25:53,721 --> 00:25:55,556
Be the man I know you are.

415
00:25:57,307 --> 00:26:01,937
[RYAN] New York. North Carolina.
North Dakota.

416
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:06,734
Ohio. Oklahoma. Oregon.

417
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:12,406
I'm sorry.

418
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:17,411
No, no, no. Buddy, don't you be sorry.
I should've known better.

419
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:25,836
There were just so many people.

420
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,296
Yeah, there was.

421
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:40,768
You know, I remember
the first time I was in a crowd.

422
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:42,352
Probably didn't bother you.

423
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:44,188
I was terrified.

424
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:48,984
All these people staring at me
and reaching out, trying to grab me,

425
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:50,736
and egging me on to use my powers.

426
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:53,989
I just... I felt like I was drowning.

427
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:56,700
Well, what did you do?

428
00:26:56,784 --> 00:26:59,912
Well, I took off.

429
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:04,333
I flew away.

430
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:08,545
They found me 80 miles down the I-9,
crying my little eyes out.

431
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:14,218
You cry?

432
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:20,098
Yes.

433
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:27,147
But I'm a man, so not in a long while.

434
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:30,275
But who knows? Maybe, uh...

435
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:33,779
maybe next time, you'll fly away.

436
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:36,615
Maybe with me?

437
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:45,290
Look, I know you want me to be like you,

438
00:27:45,374 --> 00:27:46,959
but, Dad, I'm not.

439
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:52,965
Son...

440
00:27:55,551 --> 00:27:58,720
I didn't just wake up one day
and fly out the door.

441
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:01,598
That's not how it works. I had to learn.

442
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:06,979
Only I didn't have anyone to teach me
'cause the doctors that, um...

443
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:12,860
The people that raised me,
uh, were scared of me,

444
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:14,444
so they kept their distance.

445
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:18,115
And I had to figure it all out
by myself, see?

446
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:20,868
Well, you don't have to
go through any of that.

447
00:28:21,577 --> 00:28:22,870
I'll teach you.

448
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:24,745
Really?

449
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:27,875
I love you.

450
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:51,023
Hey, did you find anything?

451
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:54,192
They got him in a cabin up in Rochester.

452
00:28:54,276 --> 00:28:55,736
- What?
- I mean...

453
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:58,322
Becca. She's great.

454
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:02,784
We talked earlier, and she's really great.
You're really... You're great.

455
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:04,119
Easy, tiger.

456
00:29:04,202 --> 00:29:06,038
How'd you get on?
I guess you got fuck all?

457
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:09,249
No witnesses.
But we definitely found fuck all.

458
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,960
I'm not sure
I'm using that term properly, but...

459
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,920
Here.

460
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:17,089
Fuck me.

461
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:19,968
This is a jackpot.

462
00:29:20,469 --> 00:29:21,762
Well done, you two.

463
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:24,890
This'll do nicely.

464
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:26,516
All right, listen up, you lot.

465
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:30,312
Getting the kid back ain't your fight.
I ain't gonna ask you to come along.

466
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:33,857
Lick my big Black balls, Butcher.
