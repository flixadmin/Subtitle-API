1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,421
<i>In 2166,</i>

2
00:00:03,588 --> 00:00:05,924
<i>an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:08,426
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:08,593 --> 00:00:09,928
<i>I have assembled an elite team</i>

5
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:12,764
<i>to hunt him throughout time
and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:13,223 --> 00:00:15,517
<i>Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed by the body</i>

7
00:00:15,684 --> 00:00:17,102
<i>I had sworn my allegiance to,</i>

8
00:00:17,352 --> 00:00:18,603
<i>the Time Masters.</i>

9
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,897
<i>In the future,
my friends may not be heroes,</i>

10
00:00:21,106 --> 00:00:22,440
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

11
00:00:22,941 --> 00:00:25,610
<i>they will be remembered
as legends.</i>

12
00:00:28,113 --> 00:00:29,873
<i>Previously, on</i>
Legends of Tomorrow...

13
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:31,408
Hold on to something!

14
00:00:36,538 --> 00:00:37,831
<i>I wanna marry you, Ray.</i>

15
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:40,917
<i>Tragedy or heartbreak,
that's how it always ends</i>

16
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:42,085
if the man's not Carter.

17
00:00:45,422 --> 00:00:46,423
It's Carter.

18
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:48,091
He doesn't even remember
who he was.

19
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:49,926
Kendra, what are you
waiting for?

20
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:52,429
<i>If I kill Savage,
his mind will be lost.</i>

21
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:54,681
<i>I'm so sorry, Rip.</i>

22
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:59,185
Who are you, Gareeb?

23
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:16,703
Ramesses' men inform me
that you still refuse to speak.

24
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:19,789
To reveal your name
or why you tried to kill me.

25
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:22,292
<i>Who are you?</i>

26
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:26,254
<i>The man who's trying
to save the world from you.</i>

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,757
And how are
your efforts proceeding?

28
00:01:29,382 --> 00:01:32,510
You can't even stand
for lack of food and water.

29
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:40,351
I will always rise up
against you.

30
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:44,856
I will never give up.

31
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:47,358
Soon, the sky rocks
will lay waste to this kingdom

32
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:49,903
and you along with it.

33
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,198
<i>This cell will be your tomb.</i>

34
00:01:55,492 --> 00:02:00,038
What do you know of the future
that I don't, Gareeb?

35
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:08,171
Mission almost accomplished.

36
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:09,778
That bottle of Scotch
was given to me

37
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:12,091
by Rob Roy MacGregor in 1689.

38
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,885
It's not half-bad.

39
00:02:14,177 --> 00:02:16,721
We should be toasting
to Savage's death.

40
00:02:16,888 --> 00:02:18,556
<i>Apart from celebrating murder,</i>

41
00:02:18,723 --> 00:02:20,350
Savage still has
Carter brainwashed.

42
00:02:20,517 --> 00:02:22,203
I don't know if you've been
paying attention, Professor,

43
00:02:22,227 --> 00:02:25,021
but murdering Savage
was always the plan.

44
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,398
Besides, Carter reincarnates,

45
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:29,567
which is more
than I can say about us.

46
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:31,378
As long as he is on board
and breathing,

47
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:34,906
Savage is a threat
to everyone on this ship.

48
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:36,574
So, what, we just kill Savage

49
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:38,409
and leave Carter
a brainless drone?

50
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:39,869
Yes.

51
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,038
<i>Sorry we're late,</i>

52
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:43,414
but we found something.

53
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:45,309
We've been running diagnostics
on Ray's suit

54
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:48,086
after his battle with Savage's
Rock'em Sock'em Robot.

55
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:49,420
The telemetry data

56
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:51,482
<i>included a comprehensive scan
of the robot's tech.</i>

57
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:52,715
Amazing.

58
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:55,385
This neuromorphic profile
is astonishingly futuristic.

59
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:57,345
Yeah, it's from 2166.

60
00:02:57,512 --> 00:02:59,264
Well, that's the thing.
It's not.

61
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:01,033
<i>This technology
is light years more advanced</i>

62
00:03:01,057 --> 00:03:02,392
than anything from 2166.

63
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:03,935
Who cares?

64
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,270
The Time Masters.

65
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,039
They refuse to take action
against Savage

66
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:08,943
because he didn't pose
a threat to the timeline.

67
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,943
But if he comes into possession
of future technology...

68
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,190
It means he's been engaging

69
00:03:13,278 --> 00:03:14,838
in exactly the same
manipulation of time

70
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:17,323
that the Time Council
were designed to prevent.

71
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,130
So now they'll finally
sign off on undoing

72
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:20,803
all the damage Savage
has done to the world.

73
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:21,870
Last time I checked,

74
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,931
the Time Council
was at the edge of the timeline.

75
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:25,999
And this bucket of bolts

76
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,917
can barely
hold it together as it is.

77
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:30,587
Gideon, what's the status
of the Time Drive?

78
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:31,754
Stable, Captain.

79
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:34,424
Plot a course
for the Vanishing Point.

80
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:39,012
Tonight, Vandal Savage faces
justice for his crimes.

81
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,859
Quite the reversal of fortune.

82
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:55,153
Isn't it, Gareeb?

83
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,823
Four thousand years ago,
it was you who was the prisoner.

84
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,325
Ever since I met you again,

85
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:03,494
I've always wondered
how you managed to escape.

86
00:04:03,703 --> 00:04:04,913
Another time, perhaps.

87
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:06,841
For the moment,
I'm more interested in this.

88
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:10,001
The brains
to your robot super-weapon.

89
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:11,669
At least a century

90
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:14,505
more advanced than
anything to be found in 2166.

91
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:17,884
Do you have something to ask me?

92
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:22,013
How did you obtain the ability
to travel through time?

93
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,475
From you.

94
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:28,353
When I saw you again in 1975,

95
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:32,357
I realized that time travel
was the only explanation.

96
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:35,652
You showed a caveman fire.

97
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:38,863
And I had almost 200 years

98
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,074
to figure out
how to strike a flame.

99
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:42,325
All this time,

100
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:43,677
I've been wondering
why it was so difficult

101
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,370
to locate you
throughout history.

102
00:04:45,662 --> 00:04:49,040
Because you've been
moving through history.

103
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,376
Well, you'll come to learn

104
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,378
that this is just
one of many things

105
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:55,546
we have in common, Gareeb.

106
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:59,550
We are both doing what we must
to save the world.

107
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,720
Subjugating the world
to your rule is not saving it.

108
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:05,932
You would create a wasteland
and call it peace.

109
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:09,560
Do not misquote Tacitus to me.

110
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:11,938
I knew him well.

111
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,107
I have lived long enough

112
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:17,026
to watch civilizations
rise and fall.

113
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:19,362
You weep for your son...

114
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:23,241
I have held dozens
of my children

115
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:26,411
as they perish from old age.

116
00:05:27,412 --> 00:05:29,080
You might be a Time Master,

117
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:32,041
but I am a master of time.

118
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:35,169
And I play a far deeper game

119
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:37,755
that you could ever hope
to comprehend.

120
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,593
Gideon, go to maximum
on the Time Drive.

121
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:43,962
<i>Inadvisable, Captain.</i>

122
00:05:44,012 --> 00:05:46,514
<i>When Dr. Palmer siphoned power
from the auxiliary Time Drive,</i>

123
00:05:46,723 --> 00:05:47,803
<i>- he reduced the...</i>
- Gideon!

124
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,933
Take us to maximum.

125
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,285
We need to get
to the Vanishing Point

126
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:51,352
as fast as possible.

127
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:55,648
Where am I?

128
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:57,734
Somewhere safe.

129
00:05:58,026 --> 00:05:59,861
Safe as long
as those cuffs hold.

130
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,613
Do you know who you are?

131
00:06:04,574 --> 00:06:06,325
I'm Cythian Torgo.

132
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:08,161
Adjunct to Lord Savage.

133
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,290
And you will release me, or
I will kill you where you stand.

134
00:06:13,249 --> 00:06:15,626
Your name is Carter Hall.

135
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:19,547
You used to be Prince Khufu
of the Middle Kingdom.

136
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:21,507
- And I am...
- Kendra Saunders.

137
00:06:23,051 --> 00:06:24,802
Oh, you seem surprised.

138
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:28,556
You didn't think Lord Savage
would warn me of my enemies?

139
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:31,768
Let me go and I promise you
I will show mercy.

140
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:34,687
I will kill you
without making you suffer first.

141
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:43,821
Not to sound like a 6-year-old,

142
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,490
but are we there yet?

143
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:47,283
No, the <i>Waverider</i>
was severely damaged

144
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,160
in Savage's last attack.

145
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:52,121
Yeah, I can tell
by the way she's flying.

146
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,391
You sure you're not pushing her
too hard?

147
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,878
The longer Savage
is on board this ship,

148
00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:01,339
the greater
the danger to all of us.

149
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:04,967
To us or your family?

150
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,512
I checked with Gideon.

151
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:10,431
Bringing Savage on board
didn't change the timeline.

152
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,100
And your family still dies.

153
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,143
The timeline is always in flux.

154
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,496
Once we get
to the Vanishing Point,

155
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,521
all will be well.

156
00:07:16,771 --> 00:07:19,190
Is that why you're pushing
the ship beyond its limits?

157
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,026
This has been my ship
for the last 13 years.

158
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:24,862
No one knows its limits better
than I do. Not even Gideon.

159
00:07:25,113 --> 00:07:26,256
The <i>Waverider</i>
will hold together,

160
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,365
I promise you.

161
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:44,382
Bollocks. Gideon!

162
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:46,968
<i>Time Drive failure, Captain.
The mains are offline.</i>

163
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:48,862
- What happened?
<i>- It appears the Time Drive</i>

164
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,721
is in need of some repair.

165
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:53,224
Uh, Ms. Lance, if you wouldn't mind

166
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:54,535
going and checking
on our guests.

167
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:55,726
On it.

168
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:57,704
Mr. Jackson. I'm going to need
your assistance

169
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:58,896
in fixing the Time Drive.

170
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:00,874
What if Jefferson can't get
the ship moving again?

171
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,378
Oh, thanks for
the vote of confidence.

172
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:04,944
No, what I mean is,
if the ship can't be repaired,

173
00:08:05,153 --> 00:08:06,529
we're marooned
in the Time Stream.

174
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:08,156
There really
is no need to worry.

175
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:10,533
The Jumpship is equipped
with an auxiliary Time Drive

176
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,411
capable of a one-time jump
back to 2016.

177
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:15,454
Which will not be necessary,

178
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,373
considering you
are gonna fix the <i>Waverider.</i>

179
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:20,001
- I'll do my best.
- That's the spirit.

180
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:24,882
You look concerned, Martin.

181
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:26,757
I'm remembering
what Mr. Snart said

182
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:29,218
about Savage's
presence on this ship

183
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:31,429
being a danger to us all.

184
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,768
Have you spoken with
your sister, Laurel, lately?

185
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:42,398
How do you know
so much about us?

186
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:45,943
Oh, I've only had 191 years
to research my enemies.

187
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:48,946
Well, then you'd know
I don't scare that easily.

188
00:08:49,447 --> 00:08:51,282
You should be scared.

189
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:52,617
Of Captain Hunter.

190
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:56,370
His obsession to save his family
will be the death of you all.

191
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:59,665
Thanks for the tip.
Enjoy being incarcerated.

192
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:02,251
Captain Hunter
lied to you so often,

193
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:04,503
and still you persist
in believing him.

194
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:07,256
You do know
why he selected all of you

195
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:10,134
for this endeavor, don't you?

196
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:11,677
Great bone structure?

197
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:14,347
He chose people
he could manipulate.

198
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,766
People that would
believe his lies.

199
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:20,645
Well, the lies
I don't believe are yours.

200
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:24,982
Do you blame him for putting
his family's lives first?

201
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,237
I'd tell you to go to hell,

202
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,489
but you'd probably
just feel at home there.

203
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,121
<i>Okay, I've got eyes
on the Time Drive.</i>

204
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:42,250
<i>There seems to be
a large crack in it.</i>

205
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,703
Well, if the housing's intact,
we should be all right.

206
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:46,170
I am going
to need you to reroute

207
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:47,817
the power
from the secondary manifold.

208
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:49,257
<i>Okay, I'm on it.</i>

209
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:51,109
Gideon, what is the level
of contamination

210
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,176
in the engine room?

211
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,428
<i>Levels at 3%
above maximum, Captain.</i>

212
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:55,739
We have to get him out of there.

213
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:57,323
Don't worry.
He should be able to finish

214
00:09:57,348 --> 00:10:00,268
before the radiation
has any adverse effect.

215
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,531
<i>Jefferson?</i>

216
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:16,867
Mom? What are you doing here?

217
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,160
Good question.

218
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,367
I'm supposed to be meeting

219
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:20,617
- my son at Jitters.
- Oh...

220
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,749
But clearly, he misses his old
job more than his mother.

221
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,794
I am so sorry,
I must've lost track of time.

222
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:28,963
Well, this should help.

223
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:33,301
I know it's not much,
but it belonged to your father.

224
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:34,927
At least, it was going to.

225
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:37,138
I bought it for him
as a birthday present

226
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:39,140
before he passed.

227
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:40,808
It's awesome. Thanks.

228
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:42,351
Maybe you could use it tonight.

229
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:45,521
Dinner at your Grandma Louise's?

230
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:47,606
Yes, I will be there.

231
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,317
And I won't be late.

232
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:51,205
I just got to stop by
the university first.

233
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:52,486
The university?

234
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,864
I gotta say goodbye
to a friend who's leaving town.

235
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,158
- But I will be there.
- 6:00.

236
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:59,577
- Okay. And I love you.
- I love you, too, baby.

237
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,750
<i>Jefferson! Jefferson!</i>

238
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,085
I did it. I got it working.

239
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:09,438
You said he wouldn't be harmed.

240
00:11:09,462 --> 00:11:10,462
Must've been a surge

241
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:11,773
when he brought the Time Drive
back online.

242
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:12,798
Gideon?

243
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:14,276
<i>Mr. Jackson has suffered
an extreme amount</i>

244
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,760
<i>of temporal radiation exposure.</i>

245
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:17,237
- That sounds ominous.
<i>- Oh, it is,</i>

246
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,239
<i>and there is nothing I can
do to reverse the side effects.</i>

247
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:20,264
What side effects?

248
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:21,682
<i>Mr. Jackson's internal organs</i>

249
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,434
<i>are aging
at an accelerated rate.</i>

250
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:26,270
<i>The rest of his body
will soon follow.</i>

251
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:34,403
Why are all the snacks
in the future sugar-free?

252
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,447
So much for progress.

253
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,116
You remember Alexa?

254
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:42,411
Yeah. The security deposit job.
What about it?

255
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:44,288
I just had a feeling
about that one.

256
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:47,291
A sixth sense
things would end badly.

257
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:49,770
And they would have if you
hadn't pulled us out of there.

258
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:50,795
<i>So what?</i>

259
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,130
I'm getting
the same feeling now.

260
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:00,197
Gideon, how effective
were Mr. Jackson's attempts

261
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:01,722
to bring
the Time Drive back online?

262
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,450
<i>The Drive's functions
have been restored,</i>

263
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:05,893
<i>but the entire system
will require a master reboot</i>

264
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,980
<i>before we can continue on
to the Vanishing Point.</i>

265
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,814
Yes, please begin.

266
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,708
And in the meantime,
could you check the timeline

267
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:14,151
for any variation
in my family's future?

268
00:12:14,402 --> 00:12:16,322
<i>I believe Ms. Lance already
told you the results.</i>

269
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:17,488
Please.

270
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:20,157
<i>The timeline remains unchanged.</i>

271
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:22,076
Were you expecting
something different?

272
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:23,619
Hope springs eternal, Ms. Lance.

273
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:24,870
If it didn't,

274
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:27,415
I would have surrendered
to despair a long time ago.

275
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:31,252
I assume Mr. Savage
is still secure in his cell?

276
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,506
He wasn't exactly short
on opinions on you, though.

277
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:37,800
I'd imagine not.

278
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:39,802
<i>Among them being</i>

279
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:43,722
that you would sell us out
to save your family.

280
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:48,144
He's not wrong.

281
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:54,459
Mr. Jackson
is currently in the MedBay,

282
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:58,070
facing death due to temporal
radiation exposure.

283
00:12:58,529 --> 00:12:59,530
Wait, what?

284
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,574
I sent him to fix
the Time Drive.

285
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:03,868
I could have gone myself.

286
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:06,120
And I'm left to wonder if,

287
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,498
in some way,

288
00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:12,251
I didn't because of the risk.

289
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:16,881
So you sent Jax
on a suicide mission

290
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:20,468
so that you could stay alive
to save your family?

291
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:23,053
I don't know, Sara.

292
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,807
That's what vexes me.

293
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:29,393
You know what vexes me?

294
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:32,146
Thinking that we've thrown in
with a captain

295
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:35,649
who cares more about himself
than he does his crew.

296
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,620
<i>Kendra, are you sure about this?</i>

297
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,498
Do you remember him?

298
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,959
He was our son,

299
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:55,669
Aldus.

300
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:58,464
You really expect me
to believe that?

301
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:01,425
I expect you
to remember your feelings.

302
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:04,386
We were together.

303
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,555
And we were happy.

304
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,600
We were a family.

305
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,564
Stay back!

306
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:25,282
Oops.

307
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:27,993
You okay?

308
00:14:28,244 --> 00:14:30,746
- I should have known better.
- But are you okay?

309
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,331
Yeah, I'm fine.

310
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,334
Stay away from him.
I'll be right back.

311
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:37,086
- Where are you going?
- To end this.

312
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:49,431
Dr. Palmer, to what do I owe
the pleasure of this visit?

313
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,600
You're going to tell me
how to free Carter's mind.

314
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:55,145
Well, all you had to do was ask.

315
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:58,816
Are you sure you want me to?

316
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:00,484
Of course I'm sure.

317
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,653
Because the moment
I release him,

318
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,863
you will lose her forever.

319
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,366
You don't know Kendra.

320
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:09,159
I know Chay-Ara.

321
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:12,496
And I know the man who stands
between you and your love

322
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:15,666
<i>has stood between me
and mine for millennia.</i>

323
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,335
We're actually quite alike,
you and I.

324
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:21,672
We're nothing alike.
You're insane.

325
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:25,467
But yet Chay-Ara once loved me
as she professes to love you.

326
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:28,846
Oh, you didn't know that, did you?

327
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:32,683
I don't even think
Chay-Ara remembers.

328
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:34,518
But 4,000 years ago,

329
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:37,354
I discovered that my Chay-Ara
had been reborn.

330
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:40,357
But with no memory
of what had happened.

331
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:42,776
Like you murdering
her and Carter.

332
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:44,028
True.

333
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:49,325
She had no recollection
of my crime of passion.

334
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:53,871
And she fell in love with me.
Very deeply.

335
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,959
And I with her.

336
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:01,337
That is perverse.

337
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:04,965
No, that is fact.
That is history.

338
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:08,218
We were happy, Dr. Palmer.
Very happy.

339
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:13,390
None of us blinded
by our cursed past.

340
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:16,226
Until he came.

341
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:19,730
He took her away from me.
He poisoned her against me.

342
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:24,276
He stole the happiness
that we shared, Dr. Palmer.

343
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,364
No.

344
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,408
No, Carter is a good man.

345
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:35,746
And you are my only enemy.

346
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:38,374
Am I?

347
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,542
Or am I just a man

348
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,879
experiencing the same things
as you are right now?

349
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:47,549
We have the same enemy.

350
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:52,721
If Carter is freed,
you lose her.

351
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:57,893
But then, she would hardly be
the first woman you've lost,

352
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,395
now, would she?

353
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:13,200
I am really gonna have to beef
up our security around here.

354
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,452
It was pretty easy
to bypass the system,

355
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,787
considering I designed it.

356
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,163
You like my ride?

357
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,474
<i>Those are some
pretty hot wheels.</i>

358
00:17:19,498 --> 00:17:20,499
Yeah.

359
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,292
Maybe that's your new name.

360
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,795
- How you feeling?
- I'm okay.

361
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:26,981
<i>- What are you doing here?</i>
- I came to drop off a note.

362
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,132
Let me guess. It says,

363
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,801
"Hey, Felicity,
I hope you're well."

364
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:33,512
"I'm off to travel through time
and fight an immortal bad guy."

365
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:35,139
- Was that me?
- Yeah.

366
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:36,849
- That was pretty good.
- Thank you.

367
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,350
So, obviously, Oliver told you.

368
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:39,837
Don't let his broodiness
fool you.

369
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:41,603
He can be
quite chatty sometimes.

370
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:43,856
He also happened to mention

371
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,816
that you're going
on this suicide mission

372
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,485
because you think
there's nothing for you here.

373
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:49,932
You think
it's a suicide mission?

374
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,148
I don't think going after
Vandal Savage is a vacation.

375
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:54,992
But don't change the subject.
You have a life here, Ray.

376
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,035
Actually, everybody thinks
I'm dead.

377
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:59,204
Nothing puts things
in perspective more

378
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:00,771
than seeing yourself
become a ghost.

379
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:02,583
You're not a ghost.

380
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,501
You just need to come back
to the world.

381
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,629
And I will.
After we take out Savage.

382
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,673
Look, I became the Atom

383
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,800
to make the world
a better place.

384
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:14,928
And I'm pretty sure
that saving it counts.

385
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,974
- I'm pretty sure it does, too.
- Hmm.

386
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:23,437
See you soon.

387
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,290
You know,
I would've stayed for you.

388
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:26,315
I do.

389
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:29,151
But who knows? Maybe the future
Mrs. Palmer is out there

390
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:33,238
somewhere in the past
or the future.

391
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:35,657
- In some parallel universe.
- Oh, yeah.

392
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:39,703
I'm off to save the world,
not fall in love.

393
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,502
<i>"And though my soul
departs the Earth,"</i>

394
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,338
<i>"I count the days
till my rebirth"</i>

395
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:54,259
"I will wait across eternity
For my love to come back to me."

396
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:56,428
<i>Please.</i>

397
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:58,806
Come back.

398
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,894
Ray.

399
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:05,729
<i>Ray.</i>

400
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:16,406
Ray. Ray, stop!

401
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:19,785
Please. Just give me a chance
to explain.

402
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,221
What you saw back there, it...

403
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:22,871
What? It wasn't
what it looked like?

404
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,623
You reciting a love poem

405
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,083
to your
brainwashed ex-boyfriend.

406
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,962
I am just trying to help Carter
remember who he really is.

407
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:31,255
Your soul mate.

408
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:32,923
Yeah, that's the part

409
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,484
in the conversation
where you're supposed to say,

410
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:35,926
"No, Ray, you're my soul mate."

411
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:38,345
Ray, you know that I love you.

412
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,764
Yeah, I know.

413
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:44,309
Just not enough.

414
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:47,312
I can't believe I'm saying it,
but Savage was right.

415
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:49,398
Loving you is like a curse.

416
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:51,733
Oh, Ray.

417
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,986
You have to know,
whatever he said,

418
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,196
he's just trying
to get inside your head.

419
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:59,449
I know that. But he's right.

420
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:03,370
Kendra, I don't think
I can do this anymore.

421
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,664
What are you saying?

422
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,292
What, you want to end things?

423
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,562
Unless you can tell me
that I'll ever be anything more

424
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:12,462
than just Carter's placeholder.

425
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:17,759
Ray.

426
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:23,181
Are you certain
these results are accurate?

427
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,559
Jefferson's blood chemistry
is akin to that of a...

428
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:26,935
<i>A 63-year-old man.</i>

429
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,313
Actually, I don't feel
a day over 60.

430
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,480
This isn't funny.

431
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,482
No, and it's all Rip's fault.

432
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:35,736
<i>I'm afraid he's also suffering
from early stage osteoarthritis.</i>

433
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:37,779
Your exposure
to the temporal radiation

434
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,241
has led to an accelerated rate
of intracellular degeneration.

435
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:44,369
This is what happens
when Rip goes with "Plan B."

436
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:47,748
And "Plan A" being taking
Savage's head in with that mace.

437
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:50,083
We're endeavoring to resolve
this without bloodshed.

438
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,836
And how's that working out
for you, Gandhi?

439
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:54,763
Look, there's nothing
we can do about it now.

440
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:56,506
We can talk to Hunter.

441
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,759
Even if Kendra
was to kill Savage,

442
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:00,928
my situation's still the same.

443
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:03,513
We're talking about
our situation, Pops.

444
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,350
We're not waiting around
for the other shoe to drop.

445
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:10,020
You deserve better.

446
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:15,359
Alexa.

447
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,027
<i>You bet your ass.</i>

448
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:22,199
- We need to talk.
- We saw what you did to Jax.

449
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,117
And we're worried
it's just the beginning.

450
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,536
- The beginning of what?
- It's like I said, Rip,

451
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:29,456
as long as Savage is alive
and on this ship,

452
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:31,124
he is dangerous.

453
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,491
The Time Drive is rebooting.
We will soon be on our way.

454
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:35,686
I'm asking for
a little faith, gentlemen.

455
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:37,547
Sorry. Fresh out.

456
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:41,136
I take it you and Mr. Snart
are of the same mind?

457
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:42,219
Yes.

458
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:44,388
And what of you, Ms. Lance?

459
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:46,306
You're the one who said

460
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,475
you'd sell us out
for your family.

461
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:50,578
Well, if that's how
you all feel,

462
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,789
none of you is obliged to
continue on this voyage with me.

463
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:54,272
<i>As I told Martin,</i>

464
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:57,150
the Jumpship can make a one-time
voyage back to 2016.

465
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,777
You saying it's ours?

466
00:21:58,944 --> 00:22:00,153
I'm saying that this mission

467
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,322
has always been
a voluntary enterprise.

468
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:04,574
And the mission
was to kill Savage.

469
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:07,119
Which doesn't seem
to be on the table anymore.

470
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,191
Very well.
Leave if that's what...

471
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:10,580
It's been a blast, Rip.

472
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,347
Good luck getting
to the Vanishing Point.

473
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:15,293
Tell your pals Chronos says,
"Kiss my ass."

474
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:22,634
What about you, Sara?

475
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:27,264
Never been one
to run from a fight.

476
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:43,196
Hi.

477
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:46,283
Impossible.

478
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,951
When I saw you last...

479
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:49,703
I know.

480
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,127
A miracle.

481
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:00,172
When I'd thought there were
none left to be had.

482
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:05,260
I needed to see you.

483
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:07,637
Look, I don't know how,

484
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:10,098
but I'm gonna get you
out of here.

485
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:13,143
This isn't your fight anymore,
Ta-er al-Sahfer.

486
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:15,187
Look, I'm not gonna
let you rot here.

487
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:17,522
Not when you're in here
because of me.

488
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:20,650
I am in here
because of my choices, beloved.

489
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:24,988
I made them. I'm ready
to accept my punishment.

490
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:27,324
I won't leave you in here.

491
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:29,493
If you love me, you will.

492
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,289
If you love me, you will
leave this place far behind,

493
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:37,000
and live a life unburdened
by your past.

494
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:38,835
It's easier said than done.

495
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:41,505
Anything worth doing always is.

496
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:54,518
<i>Oh, finally, an intellect
approximate to my own.</i>

497
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:57,354
My imprisonment was starting
to get dreary, Professor.

498
00:23:57,646 --> 00:24:00,190
I'm not here
to play mind games with you.

499
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:01,691
I'm here to ask you

500
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:04,319
if you remember a night
in October 1975,

501
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,154
a place called
the Greyhill Building.

502
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:08,532
That night,
you and your acolytes...

503
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:09,741
Were celebrating

504
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:12,869
the acquisition of your friend
Carter Hall's body.

505
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,246
Yes.

506
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:16,331
It's my understanding
this ritual

507
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:19,084
involved you sharing your
immortality with your followers.

508
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:22,838
And you wish for me
to do the same for someone else?

509
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,173
Someone dear to you.

510
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:29,219
Your nuclear
counterpart, perhaps?

511
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:30,554
Yes.

512
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:36,726
And as impertinent as this
may sound, I need your help.

513
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:39,938
Well, clearly, your friends

514
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:43,024
didn't give you
the full account of the ritual.

515
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:47,237
You see, it was Carter's blood
that worked the magic.

516
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:49,739
Perhaps you should talk to him.

517
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,408
Or better yet, Dr. Palmer.

518
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:52,742
I'm sure that he would be

519
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:55,453
more than happy
to help you spill some.

520
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:58,248
And I'm certain
you would enjoy that.

521
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:02,752
Pitting me and Raymond
against Carter. Against Kendra.

522
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,921
<i>Having us all
at each other's throats</i>

523
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:07,757
<i>while being stranded
in the Time Stream.</i>

524
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:13,221
But we're not stranded.
Not entirely.

525
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:17,350
Thank you, Mr. Savage.

526
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:21,438
As I'd hoped, you've provided me
with a solution to my problem.

527
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:27,861
I don't get it, Grey.

528
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:29,388
What's in here
that's gonna fix me?

529
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,615
Well, nothing inside
the Jumpship, Jefferson.

530
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:33,450
But rather the craft itself.

531
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:37,120
You see, this ship is
preprogrammed to return to 2016.

532
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:39,122
I've made some
additional adjustments

533
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:41,958
according to the theory
of Quantum Retro-Causality.

534
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,419
And if my math is correct,

535
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:47,797
the trip through the Time Stream
should reverse your condition.

536
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:49,299
No. No.

537
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:51,718
I'm not leaving you or the team.

538
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:53,568
Which is why
I'm not giving you a choice.

539
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:57,265
What did you do?

540
00:25:57,557 --> 00:26:00,435
I administered a mild sedative.

541
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:03,146
You roofied me again?

542
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:06,274
When I tricked you
onto this ship the first time,

543
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:09,069
I was only thinking of myself.

544
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:11,112
Now, I'm thinking of you.

545
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:21,289
You can't do this!

546
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:23,667
If we're separated, you'll die.

547
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,835
<i>I've already lived
my life, Jefferson.</i>

548
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:27,504
<i>Now, you must live yours.</i>

549
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:29,631
<i>Give my love to Clarissa.</i>

550
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:33,260
<i>Tell her I'm sorry.
She deserved a proper goodbye.</i>

551
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:39,182
<i>Grey! Grey, no! No!</i>

552
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:52,862
- Knock, knock.
- Oh, hello.

553
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:54,030
I hope you don't mind,

554
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:57,325
but I thought I'd see if I could
interest you in a lunch date.

555
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:59,734
Oh, my darling, I'm right in
the middle of some research

556
00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:01,329
that simply cannot wait.

557
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:04,165
What's the topic?

558
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:09,004
As a matter of fact,
time itself.

559
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,505
The irony. Oh!

560
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:12,757
Again. I completely forgot,

561
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:15,218
I promised I'd meet
with some fellow academics

562
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:17,220
to help resolve
an experiment of theirs.

563
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:18,722
Does this experiment

564
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:20,328
have anything
to do with time travel?

565
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:22,183
Almost certainly.

566
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:24,686
But it won't take long.

567
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,023
In fact, I'll be home
before you even know it.

568
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:38,325
Clarissa, you know
that I love you.

569
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:44,372
There's nothing I do that isn't
driven by that very thought.

570
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:50,392
<i>Now let's get
the hell out of here.</i>

571
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:55,967
What did you do, Poindexter?

572
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:58,595
- What do you mean?
- The Jumpship. Where is it?

573
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:01,348
Well, it's really more a question
of when, but...

574
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:05,101
Oh, yes. You both wanted
to return to 2016.

575
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:07,771
Got it in one.

576
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:10,982
I did what I had to do
to save Jefferson's life.

577
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:12,192
Now, we must do

578
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,194
whatever is necessary
to repair the <i>Waverider</i>

579
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:16,780
and deliver Savage
to the Vanishing Point.

580
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:24,371
Back so soon? With a stench
of defeat written all over you.

581
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:26,831
Can't say I didn't warn you.

582
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,292
Trying to get under my skin,
is that it?

583
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:31,169
I've got your
little game figured out.

584
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:32,962
And for all your intelligence,

585
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:35,840
you still didn't manage
to make Chay-Ara yours.

586
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:39,177
I wouldn't expect a psychopath
like you to understand.

587
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:41,513
Kendra is free to do
what she wants.

588
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:44,682
You know what I see
when I look at you?

589
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:49,104
I see weakness
masquerading as goodness.

590
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:50,855
I'm not the one trapped
in a cage.

591
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:52,607
Well, if it weren't
for this cage,

592
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:56,069
you wouldn't have
that arrogant look on your face.

593
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:58,071
You think I'm afraid of you?

594
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:00,782
No, I know you are.

595
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:04,786
At least Carter had the courage
to face me like a man.

596
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,623
No wonder she didn't choose you.

597
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:13,044
Oh.

598
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:20,051
You feel better now, Dr. Palmer?

599
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:21,761
Not even close.

600
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:37,360
And I thought
you were nothing like me.

601
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:04,012
I'll leave you
to contemplate on that.

602
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:24,884
<i>Time Drive re-initialization
complete, Captain.</i>

603
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:27,368
<i>The primary systems
are back online and stable.</i>

604
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:28,578
Begin ignition sequence

605
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:30,914
and resume our route
to the Vanishing Point.

606
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:32,499
You're a fool, Professor.

607
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,751
I'm trying
to save Jefferson's life.

608
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:36,753
Savage has escaped.

609
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,713
- What?
- I'm sorry.

610
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:40,687
Pull up all the surveillance
monitors now!

611
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:43,237
<i>I'm afraid Vandal Savage
has already freed Carter Hall,</i>

612
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:45,424
<i>and is preparing to disengage...</i>

613
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,596
That can't be good.

614
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:48,604
Gideon's entire operational
matrix is offline,

615
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:49,724
and without her help...

616
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:52,769
We'll have to make our
approach the old-fashioned way.

617
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:54,103
Shouldn't we be more worried

618
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,105
about Savage
and his brainwashed crony?

619
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:57,941
Yes. Which is why I need you

620
00:30:58,107 --> 00:30:59,943
and Dr. Palmer
to go and recapture him.

621
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:02,276
In the meantime, if the rest
of us can't figure out

622
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:03,802
how to pilot the ship
without Gideon,

623
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:06,734
we're never going to be able
to leave the Time Stream.

624
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:09,244
If we live through this,
you bumbling idiot,

625
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:11,037
I might just kill you.

626
00:31:11,746 --> 00:31:14,249
Exactly how old-fashioned
are you talking?

627
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:17,919
So, if the Time Stream
is like this vast river,

628
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:21,464
these maps plot the safest
course along that river's path.

629
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:25,635
Exactly. I keep these here,
just in case of emergency.

630
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:27,428
This certainly qualifies.

631
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,763
What's Jurgens Ridge?

632
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,974
Pray you need never find out.

633
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:33,059
Martin, you're gonna be
our engineer.

634
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:34,936
I need you to adjust
our energy output

635
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:36,813
to avoid overtaxing
the <i>Waverider.</i>

636
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:40,441
And you, Ms. Lance, you're going
to be our navigator.

637
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,652
I was in the League
of Assassins, not NASA.

638
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:44,339
I need someone
who can make tough calls

639
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:45,613
under extreme pressure.

640
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,824
No one fits that description
better than you.

641
00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:52,745
Come to join the party?

642
00:31:53,496 --> 00:31:56,499
<i>You should have
left me back in 2166.</i>

643
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:58,418
Yeah, yeah,
we know that, mullethead.

644
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,212
Who are you
to stand up against me,

645
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:04,048
Vandal Savage,
destroyer of empires?

646
00:32:04,382 --> 00:32:06,718
Leonard Snart, robber of ATMs.

647
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:10,698
We need more power
to the Time Drive, Martin.

648
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:12,181
How much farther can we push it?

649
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:14,309
25%, and only for a brief burst,

650
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:15,637
but it might be all we need.

651
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:24,193
It's still two against four.

652
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,197
Come on!

653
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,850
<i>What's our trajectory
looking like, Ms. Lance?</i>

654
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:39,208
Just give me a second here.

655
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:40,376
Oddly enough,

656
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:42,229
as the Vanishing Point
is at the very end of time...

657
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:43,480
Yeah, and we're never
going to make it there

658
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:46,507
if you don't lower the ship
negative 12 degrees, on my mark.

659
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:49,510
Three, two, one, now!

660
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:58,353
Did it work?

661
00:32:58,728 --> 00:32:59,854
Well, we're not dead.

662
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:02,899
I got this. Handle Savage.

663
00:33:08,237 --> 00:33:09,322
<i>Haircut,</i>

664
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,741
move your fat head
so I can get a clean shot!

665
00:33:19,582 --> 00:33:20,822
They seem to be getting closer.

666
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:22,251
<i>- I'll go help them.</i>
- No!

667
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:23,419
I'm not going to place

668
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:24,730
another one of you in jeopardy.
I'll go.

669
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:26,089
But who's gonna pilot the ship?

670
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:01,290
Gareeb. I was wondering
where you were hiding.

671
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:06,796
Bring her to me.

672
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,136
Chay-Ara. My love.

673
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:15,763
I'm sorry that it has to end
like this again.

674
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:18,975
Carter.

675
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,853
<i>I will wait...</i>

676
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:23,813
<i>For eternity.</i>

677
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:26,149
Come back to me.

678
00:34:50,173 --> 00:34:51,340
Kendra.

679
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:10,109
He's alive.

680
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:13,571
You saved him.

681
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:17,408
You saved us all.

682
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:29,670
Is that...

683
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:31,714
Welcome to the Vanishing Point.

684
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:33,883
I can't believe we made it.

685
00:35:36,427 --> 00:35:38,054
And what did you do
to your shoulder?

686
00:35:38,346 --> 00:35:40,073
Hmm? Oh, I might have jumped
in front of a laser blast

687
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:41,599
intended for Ms. Saunders.

688
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:43,893
What?

689
00:35:44,227 --> 00:35:45,787
I couldn't have my team
thinking I cared

690
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:47,563
more about myself than them,
now, could I?

691
00:35:47,772 --> 00:35:49,398
Really?

692
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:52,044
Uh, I think I just lost control
of the ship.

693
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:53,545
Yeah, that might have something
to do with us

694
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:55,905
being the most wanted time
criminals in all of history.

695
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,829
<i>Timeship</i> Waverider,

696
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:04,914
<i>we've taken control
of your guidance systems.</i>

697
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:07,792
<i>Disable your weapons
and prepare to be boarded.</i>

698
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:09,418
Oh, it's good to be home.

699
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:12,672
<i>Captain Hunter.
This is unexpected.</i>

700
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:14,762
Well, I have a reputation
to maintain, don't I?

701
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:16,926
And I hereby request
an immediate assembly

702
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:18,445
of the Time Council
in accordance with

703
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:19,637
General Order 52.

704
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:22,014
<i>So you've returned
to answer for your crimes?</i>

705
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:24,433
No, I'm here to justify them.

706
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:28,271
If this truly is goodbye,

707
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:30,773
would you mind answering
just one final question?

708
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:32,692
It seems only sporting.

709
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:35,945
How did you manage to escape
my prison, all those years ago?

710
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:40,700
There were no signs of damage,
no clues to your tricks.

711
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:43,661
It left me puzzled
for centuries.

712
00:36:44,495 --> 00:36:46,831
The best magic tricks
have the simplest solutions.

713
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,542
I bribed your guard
with a novelty pen.

714
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,019
It had a picture
of a woman on it,

715
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,521
turn it upside down,
her top comes off.

716
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:55,631
I won it from a drunk G.I.
in a Philippines bar in 1944.

717
00:36:55,798 --> 00:37:00,386
It's a tacky souvenir,
but in this case, a lifesaver.

718
00:37:01,304 --> 00:37:03,347
Now, unfortunate for you,

719
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:05,016
the guards
in the Vanishing Point

720
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:07,810
won't be quite so easily swayed.

721
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:13,733
- Hey.
- Hey.

722
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:15,985
Uh...

723
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:18,487
I was making sure he was okay.

724
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:21,991
I think most guys
would be more inclined

725
00:37:22,158 --> 00:37:24,452
to smother him with a pillow.

726
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:28,122
Just because he stole my girl and tried
to take over the ship?

727
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:31,667
But seriously.
Carter saved your life.

728
00:37:33,127 --> 00:37:35,338
He's a part of this team.
Always has been.

729
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:38,341
I wish things
could be different.

730
00:37:38,507 --> 00:37:39,842
Yeah. Me too.

731
00:37:40,468 --> 00:37:43,429
I need you to know
that what we had was real.

732
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:46,682
In a way,

733
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,020
a broken heart is just
what the doctor ordered.

734
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:52,730
It is?

735
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:54,023
Yeah.

736
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:57,026
When I lost Anna, I thought that...

737
00:37:57,735 --> 00:37:59,528
I could never find anybody

738
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:01,781
who I could spend
the rest of my life with.

739
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:04,784
And you proved me wrong.

740
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:08,454
Thank you for showing me
that it's possible.

741
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,216
<i>Rip Hunter.</i>

742
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:23,761
On behalf of the Time Council,
you are hereby ordered...

743
00:38:23,928 --> 00:38:24,929
Yeah, before you do that,

744
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:27,306
there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

745
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:31,811
You remember Mr. Savage?

746
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:36,649
Of course.

747
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:38,901
<i>And we remember
how you pled for us</i>

748
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:42,571
to remove him from the timeline
once before.

749
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:45,282
Well, as the first Time Master
was so fond of saying,

750
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:47,618
"That was then. This is now."

751
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:51,038
Incontrovertible proof
that Vandal Savage

752
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:53,749
has been engaged
in the manipulation of time.

753
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:55,626
Including a confession.

754
00:38:56,085 --> 00:38:58,254
<i>When I saw you again in 1975,</i>

755
00:38:58,421 --> 00:39:01,590
<i>I realized that time travel
was the only explanation.</i>

756
00:39:01,924 --> 00:39:04,051
<i>You showed a caveman fire.</i>

757
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:06,262
<i>And I had almost 200 years</i>

758
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:08,723
<i>to figure out
how to strike a flame.</i>

759
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,144
<i>Impressive, Captain Hunter.</i>

760
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,770
You and your team
have accomplished

761
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:18,649
what none of us here in the
Time Council believed you would.

762
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:21,068
If the prisoner
would step forward.

763
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:29,285
Vandal Savage,
by the power of this chamber,

764
00:39:29,744 --> 00:39:31,120
<i>it is my duty</i>

765
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:34,373
to return you
to Earth immediately.

766
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:36,959
What?

767
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:41,881
This man you've brought before
us is needed back in 2166.

768
00:39:43,132 --> 00:39:44,550
You're in league with him?

769
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,636
I wouldn't expect you
to understand our reasons.

770
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:48,929
<i>For all your wisdom,</i>

771
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:52,141
you were never able to
take the long view of history.

772
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:54,143
Take him away.

773
00:39:55,728 --> 00:39:57,897
Search their ship
for the others.

774
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:07,323
Did you hear that?

775
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,325
Don't try to distract me.

776
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:20,002
We need to find
somewhere to hide.

777
00:40:20,294 --> 00:40:22,004
Why do we need to find
somewhere to hide?

778
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:23,506
Alexa.

779
00:40:33,974 --> 00:40:35,101
Damn.

780
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,561
Ah.

781
00:40:38,521 --> 00:40:40,773
If you're here for Savage,
you're too late.

782
00:40:41,023 --> 00:40:43,526
- Mick, what's going on?
- You're under arrest.

783
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:44,902
Oh.

784
00:40:47,196 --> 00:40:50,199
If I had a nickel
for every time I heard that.

785
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:56,080
Druce's men
have taken your ship.

786
00:40:56,372 --> 00:40:57,915
Your friends are under arrest,

787
00:40:58,082 --> 00:41:01,127
and you are
once again my prisoner.

788
00:41:02,253 --> 00:41:04,046
This time,
I don't plan to lose you.

789
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:09,718
Oh, and yes, I do remember
the guard very well.

790
00:41:10,386 --> 00:41:11,637
<i>He died.</i>
