It's just water.

00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:25,669
It's a lot of water.

00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:27,963

-Yeah, I'm fine, I just…

00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,540
I just can't-- can't stomach the water.

-You're my new partner.
-That's right.

00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,259
Not the best way to meet,
with my head halfway down the toilet.

14
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,680
Doesn't exactly square with Teddy Daniels,
the man of the legend, I'll give you that.

15
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:19,765
The legend?

16
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,851
What the hell you boys smoking
over there in Portland, anyway?

18
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,146
I came from the office in Seattle.

19
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,734
How long you been with the Marshals?

20
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,486
Four years.

21
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,864
So you know how small it is.

22
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,283
Sure.

23
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,662
What about you? You got a girl? Married?

24
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,164
I was.

25
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,594
She died.

26
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,264
-Jesus. I don't--
-Don't worry about it.

27
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,519
There was a fire at the apartment building
while I was at work.

28
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,646
Four people died.

29
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,190
It was the smoke that got her,
not the fire.

30
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,026
-See, that's-- that's important.
-I'm sorry, boss.

31
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,738
Where are my goddamn cigarettes?

32
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,824
Here, have one of mine.

33
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:22,703
I could've sworn they were
in my jacket before I got on.

34
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,913
Government employees will rob you blind.

35
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:28,959
Thanks.

36
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,838
They give you a briefing
about the institution before you left?

37
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,923
All I know is it's a mental hospital.

38
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,510
-For the criminally insane.
-[scoffs]

39
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,805
Well, if it was just folks running
around hearing voices

40
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,224
and chasing after butterflies,
they wouldn't need us.

41
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,237
-Is that where we're headed?
-Yep.

42
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,781
The other side
of the island is rock bluffs.

43
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,242
All the way down to the edge of the water.

44
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,413
The dock, it's the only way on, or off.

45
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,000
We'll be casting off as soon
as you two are ashore.

46
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,586
I'd appreciate it if you'd hurry up
about it.

47
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,380
-Why?
-Storm's coming.

48
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,992
Never seen a Marshal's badge before.

49
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,748
I'm Deputy Warden McPherson, gentlemen.
Welcome to Shutter Island.

50
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,374
I'll be the one taking you
up to Ashecliffe.

51
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,682
Your boys seem a little on edge,
Mr. McPherson.

52
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,976
Right now, Marshal, we all are.

53
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,189
Electrified perimeter.

54
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,776
How can you tell?

55
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,612
I've seen something like it before.

56
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:32,976
[McPherson] All right.

57
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,353
You gentlemen will be accorded
all the help we can give.

58
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,648
But during your stay,
you will obey protocol.

59
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:39,983
Is that understood?

60
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,359
Absolutely.

61
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,155
The red brick building on your right
is Ward A, the male ward.

62
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,366
Ward B, the female ward,
is the one on your left.

63
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,786
Ward C, is that building on the bluffs.

64
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,371
An old Civil War fort.

65
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,832
The most dangerous patients
are housed there.

66
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,168
Admittance to Ward C is forbidden,

67
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,670
without the written consent
and physical presence

68
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,631
of both myself and Dr. Cawley.

69
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,841
Is that understood?

70
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,428
You act like insanity is catching.

71
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,142
You are hereby required
to surrender your firearms.

72
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,856
Mr. McPherson,
we are duly appointed federal marshals.

73
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,525
We are required to carry our firearms
with us at all times.

74
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,946
Executive order 319 of the Federal Code
of Penitentiaries states that

75
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,656
when inside a penitentiary,

76
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,533
the officers of that institution
have final authority.

77
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,456
Gentlemen, you will not get
through this gate with your firearms.

78
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,313
Okay, now that the official stuff's done,
come on, boys.

79
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,565
What do you say we go find Dr. Cawley?

When did she escape? This prisoner?

83
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,250
I'm afraid Dr. Cawley will have
to fill you in on the situation.

84
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:21,918
Protocol.

85
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,045
Correctional officers
at a mental institution,

86
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,256
that's a weird sight,
if you don't mind me saying.

87
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,508
[McPherson] It's the only facility
of its kind in the U.S.,

88
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,759
even the world.

89
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,137
We take only the most dangerous,
damaged patients,

90
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,139
ones no other hospital can manage.

91
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,057
And it's all due to Dr. Cawley.

92
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,018
He's created something really unique here.

93
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,854
It's a hospital for people
our society normally considers

94
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:41,980
beyond treatment.

95
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,631

Show your badges, gentlemen.

98
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:21,227
Dr. Cawley's been consulted numerous times
by Scotland Yard,

99
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,980
-MI5, the OSS.
-Why?

100
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,066
What do you mean?

101
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,488
What do intelligence agencies want
to consult a psychiatrist about?

102
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,073
I guess you'll have to ask him.

Yes, sir. Pleasure, gentlemen.

He had a lot to say about you.

109
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,641
McPherson's a good man.
He believes in the work we do here.

110
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,893
And what would that be, exactly?

111
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,772
A moral fusion between law and order
and clinical care.

[Chuck] Pardon me, Doc.
A what between what and what?

Those paintings are quite accurate.

114

Used to be the kind of patients
we deal with here were shackled

115

and left in their own filth.

116
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:25,875
They were beaten,

117
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,419
as if whipping them bloody would drive
the psychosis out.

118
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,630
We drove screws into their brains,

119
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,967
we submerged them in icy water
until they lost consciousness or…

120
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,344
even drowned.

121
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,805

-[Dr. Cawley] We treat them.

Try to heal, try to cure.

123
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,350
And if that fails,

124
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,894
at least we provide them
with a measure of comfort in their lives.

125
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,062
Calm.

126
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:50,191
These are all violent offenders, right?
I mean…

127
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,068
they've hurt people.

128
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,655
-Murdered them in some cases.
-In almost all cases, yes.

129
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:00,243
Then, personally, Doctor, I'd have to say,
screw their sense of calm.

130
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,873
It's my job to treat my patients,
not their victims.

131
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,124
I'm not here to judge.

Excuse me, patient,

00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,382
one Rachel Solando,

135
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,010
escaped sometime in the last 24 hours.

Last night, between ten and midnight.

137
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,889
Is she considered dangerous?

138
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,309
You could say that.
She killed all three of her children.

139
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,645
She drowned them in the lake
behind her house.

140
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,357
She took them out one by one,
held their heads under till they died,

141
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,568
then she brought them back inside
and arranged them

142
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,986
around the kitchen table.

143
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,946
She ate a meal there
before a neighbor dropped by.

144
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:43,953
-And what about the husband?
-He died on the beaches of Normandy.

145
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,413
She's a war widow.

146
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,124
She starved herself
when she first came here.

147
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,084
She insisted the children weren't dead.

to have an aspirin, do you?

Sometimes, but today,
I'm a little more prone to seasickness.

-Yeah.

In that case, you're quite right.

161
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,836
She believes we're all deliverymen,
milkmen, postal workers.

162
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,673
To sustain the delusion
that her children never died,

163
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,050
she's created
an elaborate fictional structure,

164
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,552
and she gives us all parts to play
in that fiction.

165
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,139
So have you--
have you searched the grounds yet?

166
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,600
The warden and his men scoured the island.

167
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,143
Not a trace.

168
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,981
And what's more disturbing is,
we don't know how she got out of her room.

169
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:58,236
It was locked from the outside,
and the only window is barred.

170
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,825
It's as if she evaporated straight
through the walls.

171
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,788
[lock opening]

172
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,793
I brought her right back here
after group therapy, locked her in,

173
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,005
came back for a midnight round,
she was gone.

174
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:28,308
Seriously, doctor, how is it possible
that the truth never gets through to her?

175
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,227
I mean, she's in a mental institution,
right?

176
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,730
Seems like something you'd notice
from time to time.

177
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,982
How many pairs of shoes
are the patients given?

178
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,066
Two pairs.

179
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:41,279
Sanity's not a choice, Marshal.
You can't just choose to get over it.

180
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:45,450
So, she left here barefoot?

181
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:49,037
Come on, Doc, she couldn't get ten yards
in that terrain.

182
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,664
[Dr. Cawley] Marshal?

183
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,810
This is definitely Rachel's handwriting.

184
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:15,855
I have no idea what
the law of four is, though.

185
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,316
-It's not a psychiatric term?
-I'm afraid not.

186
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,068
"Who is 67?"

187
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,695
Fuck if I know.

188
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,239
I have to say that's quite close
to my clinical conclusion.

189
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,201
Think it's just random scribblings?

190
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,871
Oh, no, not at all. Rachel's smart.
Brilliant, in fact.

191
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,873
This paper could be important.

192
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,751
Excuse me, Doctor,
but we're gonna have to hold on to this.

193
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,960
Of course.

194
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:39,837
[man grunting]

195
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,923
[Chuck]
And you say she had to come through here?

196
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:46,427
[Dr. Cawley] After lights out,
the orderlies play cards in here.

197
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,972
Last night, there were seven men sitting
at the base

198
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,891
of those stairs playing stud poker.

199
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,061
Yet somehow, Rachel managed
to slip past them.

200
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:59,482
-Why?
-How? She turns invisible?

201
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,608
[chuckles softly]

202
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,026
Doctor, we're gonna need access

203
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,070
to the personnel files
of all the medical staff.

204
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,073
The nurses, the guards, the orderlies,
anyone who was working then.

205
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,117
We'll take your request
under consideration.

206
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:12,203
-[chuckles]
-This is not a request, Doctor.

207
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,123
This is a federal facility
and a dangerous prisoner--

208
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,958
-Patient.
-Patient…

209
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,752
has escaped.
Now, you will comply

210
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,671
-or--
-All I can say is, I'll see what I can do.

211
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,049
Doctor, we're gonna need
to speak with the staff.

212
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,134
Do you understand?

213
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,512
I'll assemble them in the common room
after dinner.

214
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,307
<i>If you have any further questions,</i>
<i>feel free to join the deputy warden</i>

215
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:34,475
<i>in the search.</i>

216
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,198
[McPherson] It's 11 miles
to the nearest land

217
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,366
and the water's freezing.

218
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,411
Current was strong last night,
tide pushing in.

219
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:55,872
She'd have drowned
or been crushed on the rocks,

220
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,707
and her body would have washed back
up on shore.

221
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,213
What about those caves down there?
Have you checked them?

222
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,632
No way she could get there.

223
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,219
The bases of those cliffs are covered
in poison ivy,

224
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:14,432
live oak, sumac, a thousand plants
with thorns as big as my dick.

225
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,685
You said yourself, Marshal,
she's got no shoes.

226
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,522
[water lapping]

227
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,569
All right, let's check the other side.

228
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,031
[eagles screeching]

229
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,744
-What's that tower?
-It's an old lighthouse.

230
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,497
The guards already searched inside it.

231
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,876
What's in there? More patients?

232
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,128
Sewage treatment facility.

233
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:48,549
It's getting dark soon.
I'm calling this off for tonight.

234
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,343
Let's go, boys!

235

[Teddy]
<i>You were on watch on the landing, huh?</i>

236
00:16:56,724 --> 00:17:00,144
Yeah, couldn't nobody get in or out
of their room on that corridor

237
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,395
without me seeing.

238
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,566
Okay, Rachel Solando,
who else does she have to pass

239
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,776
to get down here?

240
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,660
Me. Glen Miga.

241
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,079
Sir, I didn't see nothing.

242
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,206
Yeah, and you were at your post all night?

243
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,583
Yeah, but I didn't see a thing.

244
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:26,337
Glen.

245
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,340
Glen.

246
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,302
Tell me the truth.

247
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,138
I…

248
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,518
I maybe went to the bathroom.

249
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:45,147
-What? You breached protocol. Christ.
-I wasn't gone more than a minute.

250
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:49,193
All right, look. Let's back up here.
Let's all just back up.

251
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,196
Miss Solando was put in her room
for lights out.

252
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,657
Does anyone here know
what she did before that?

253
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,451
Anyone?

254
00:17:58,641 --> 00:18:00,541
-Come on, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone.
-[Teddy snapping fingers]

255
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,374
She was in a group therapy session.

256
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,167
Huh.

257
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,044
Anything unusual occur?

258
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,589
Define unusual.

259
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,342
-Excuse me?
-This is a mental institution, Marshal,

260
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,219
for the criminally insane.

261
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,306
-Usual isn't a big part of our day.
-[all laugh]

I will rephrase.

263
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:25,229
Did anything happen last night
during group therapy that was more,

264
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,107
let's say, I don't know, memorable than--

-Exactly.

No. Sorry.

Did Miss Solando say anything
during group therapy?

268
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,409
She was worried about the rain.

269
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,537
And she hated the food here.

So you were there.
Was there a doctor present?

Yes, Dr. Sheehan led the discussion.

00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,676
Dr. Sheehan?

275
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,347
Yes, he was running the session.

276
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:04,143
He's Rachel's primary, the psychiatrist
who directly oversees her care.

277
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,686
Huh.

278
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,981
We're gonna need to speak
with Dr. Sheehan.

279
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:13,694
I'm afraid that won't be possible.
He left on the ferry this morning.

280
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,114
His vacation was already planned.
He'd been putting it off too long.

281
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:22,286
You're in a state of lockdown,
a dangerous patient has escaped,

282
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,499
and you let her primary doctor
leave on vacation?

283
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,918
Well, of course. He's a doctor.

[all laughing]

285
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,300
Do you have the phone number
for where he's gone?

I'm sorry, sir, but it's all down.

an important call.

I have evening rounds in the wards,

Good. We can talk then, right?

You don't indulge in alcohol?
I'm surprised.

Isn't it common for men
in your profession to imbibe?

320
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:52,311
Common enough. And, in yours?

You have outstanding defense mechanisms.

You must be quite adept at interrogations.

Men like you are my specialty,

Men of violence.

334

Now that's a hell of an assumption
to make.

No assumption. No, not at all.

You misunderstand me.
I said you are men of violence.

I'm not accusing you of being violent men.

It's not much of a stretch, Doc.

No, no, not because you enjoy it,

but because retreat isn't something
you consider an option.

you just might reach him.

00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:54,181
-Well, why was that a big deal?
-It was obvious.

475
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:58,935
She wanted me to pull out my thing
so that she could laugh at it.

476
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,105
Mr. Breene…

477
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,234
we need to ask you some questions, okay?

478
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:10,238
When I cut her, she screamed.

479
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,702
But… she scared me.

480
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:19,623
-What did she expect?
-[Teddy] Interesting.

481
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:24,586
But we're here
to talk about Rachel Solando, okay?

482
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:26,379
Rachel Solando. Do you--

483
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,715
you know that she drowned her own kids?

484
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,009
She drowned her kids!

485
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:34,554
This is-- this is a sick fucking world
we live in, I'll tell you that.

486
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:36,056
But you know what?
They should be gassed.

487
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:40,644
All of them, the-- the retards,
the killers, the niggers.

488
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,355
You kill your own kid, gas the bitch.

489
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,193
Could you… stop that?

490
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,489
-That nurse…
-[Peter] Please, stop that.

491
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,908
That nurse, maybe,
maybe she had kids, huh?

492
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:58,495
A husband.

493
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:02,165
Just trying to make ends meet.

494
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,044
Lead a-- a normal life.

495
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,630
And it says in your file that…

496
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,009
you tore her face off, didn't you?

497
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,177
[pencil scribbling]

498
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:17,931
Congratulations. No more normal for her.
Not ever again. No.

499
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,811
Do you know what she was afraid of?

500
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:28,650
-You.
-Could you stop that, please?

501
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,028
Stop that!

502
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,698
Please! Stop!

503
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,449
Do you know a patient named
Andrew Laeddis?

504
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,076
-Do you?
-No! No.

505
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,370
-Boss. What's up?
-Fine.

506
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,956
-I wanna go back. I wanna go.
-Peter! Come on!

507
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:46,084
-I got him. Peter! Peter!
-Hey, Peter!

508
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,252
Go back.

509
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,418
-[Peter] I wanna go back.
-[guard] Come on, Peter.

510
00:34:49,493 --> 00:34:51,329
[Peter] I don't wanna see him.
I don't wanna see him anymore.

511
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:52,610
[guard] It's okay. It's all right.

512
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,218
[thunder rumbling]

513
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:02,976
I'll never get out of here.
I'm not sure that I should.

514
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,355
Excuse me for saying this, Miss Kearns.

515
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:10,066
-Mrs.
-Mrs. Kearns.

516
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,654
But you seem quite… quite normal.

517
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,032
I mean, in-- in comparison
to the other patients here.

518
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,703
Well, I have my dark days.
I suppose everybody does.

519
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:26,166
The difference is most people don't kill
their husbands with an axe.

520
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,376
Ah.

521
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:31,296
Although, personally,
I think if a man beats you

522
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:36,092
and fucks half the women he sees,
and no one will help you,

523
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,638
axing him isn't the least
understandable thing you could do.

524
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:44,142
-Maybe you shouldn't get out.
-[Bridget chuckles]

525
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,811
What would I do if I did?

526
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,230
[inhales] I don't know the world anymore.

527
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:54,069
They say there are bombs
that can reduce whole cities to ash.

528
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:59,741
And what do you call them? "Televisions",
voices and faces coming from a box.

529
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,535
I hear enough voices already.

530
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,747
What can you tell us about Rachel?

531
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,833
Umm…

532
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,087
Not much. She-- she keeps to herself.

533
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:15,632
She believed her kids were alive.

534
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,885
She thought she was still living
in the Berkshires,

535
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:23,306
and we were all her neighbors,
the-- the milkmen,

536
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,100
-postmen--
-Deliverymen.

537
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,103
And Dr. Sheehan was there that night?

538
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,982
Yes. Umm… he talked about anger.

539
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,488
Tell me about him. What's he like?

540
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,242
Ah… he's…

541
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,037
okay. Nice.

542
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,583
Not hard on the eyes,
as my mother would say.

543
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:52,502
[Bridget chuckling]

544
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,046
Did he ever make a pass at you?

545
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,298
No.

546
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:00,093
No, Dr. Sheehan's a good doctor,
he would never…

547
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:03,722
Umm.

548
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,641
Could I-- could I have a glass of water,
please?

549
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:07,934
No problem.

550
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,784
-Thank you, Marshal.
-[Chuck] Sure.

551
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,125
[Teddy] I just have one more question
for you, Mrs. Kearns.

552
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,256
Did you ever meet a patient
named Andrew Laeddis?

553
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:43,428
No.

554
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,097
[voice breaks] Never heard of him.

555
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,563
[Teddy]<i> She was coached.</i>

556
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,858
She used practically the same words
as Cawley and the nurse,

557
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,736
-like she'd been told exactly what to say.
-[Chuck] Who's Andrew Laeddis?

558
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:08,036
You asked every one of those patients
back there about him. Who is he?

559
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,960
What the hell, boss?
I'm your partner, for Christ's sake.

560
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:17,796
We just met, Chuck.

561
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:22,550
You've been on the beat for a long time.
You've got a duty. You've got a career.

562
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:23,635
What I'm doing…

563
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,013
it's not exactly by the book.

564
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:31,267
I don't-- I don't give a damn
about by-the-book, boss.

565
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:33,353
I just wanna know
what the hell's going on.

566
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,443
When this case came over the wires,

567
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,572
I requested it specifically,
you understand?

568
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:46,366
Why?

569
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,994
Andrew Laeddis…

570
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,706
he was the maintenance man
in the apartment building

571
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,083
where my wife and I lived.

572
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:57,877
Okay.

573
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:01,548
He was also a firebug.

574
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,678
Andrew Laeddis lit the match…

575
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,559
that caused the fire that killed my wife.

576
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,277
[guard] Let them out!

577
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:28,241
-[Chuck] What happened to Laeddis?
-[Teddy] He got away with it.

578
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,202
Laeddis got away with it
and then he disappeared.

579
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,080
About a year ago,
I open up the paper and there he is.

580
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,040
Ugly-looking son of a bitch.

581
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:39,002
Huge scar from his right temple
down to his left lip.

582
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:42,297
Eyes different colors.
Not the type of face you'd forget.

583
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:45,466
He burned down a schoolhouse,
killed two people,

584
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,427
said voices told him to do it.

585
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:50,221
First, he went to prison,
then he got transferred here.

586
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,140
-Then what?
-Then nothing.

587
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,102
He vanished like he never existed.
No record whatsoever.

588
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,979
Pretty sure he's not in Ward B.

589
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,148
-That leaves Ward C.
-Or he could be dead.

590
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,567
So could Rachel Solando, for that matter.

591
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,069
Lot of places to hide a body here.

592
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,865
Only one place no one would really notice.

593
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:25,006
That patient, Bridget Kearns,
when she sent me for water,

594
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,175
she said something to you back there,
didn't she?

595
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:29,052
No.

596
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,138
Come on, boss.

597
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:37,310
She wrote it.

598
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,780
[thunder rumbling]

599
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,995
Boss! We gotta get indoors.

600
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,289
It's turning into a fucking Kansas
out here.

601
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,333
-[Teddy] Hold on.
-[Chuck] No, let's go!

602
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,462
Watch out!

603
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:08,049
Jesus!

604
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,011
-Come on! Up there!
-[Teddy] Let's go!

605
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:16,808
[Chuck] Get in there! Let's go!

606
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:21,729
Boss!

607
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,863
-[Teddy] God!
-Jesus Christ!

608
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,158
[Teddy] Damn it. God!

609
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:46,129
-You okay, boss?
-Yeah, I'm all right.

610
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:57,390
So if Laeddis is here,
what are you gonna do about it?

611
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:01,936
I'm not here to kill Laeddis.

612
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,822
If it was my wife, I'd kill him. Twice.

613
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,629
[Teddy]<i> When we got through the gates</i>
<i>at Dachau, the SS guards surrendered.</i>

614
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,808
The Kommandant tried to kill himself
before we got there, but…

615
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,812
<i>he-- he botched it.</i>

616
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,357
Took him an hour to die.

617
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:57,492
When I went outside, I saw all the bodies
on the ground.

618
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:03,247
<i>Too many to count.</i>

619
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,026
Too many to imagine.

620
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,155
So, yeah, the…

621
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,994
the guards surrendered.
We took their guns and we lined them up.

[indistinct shouting]

[man choking, groaning]

624
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,958
It wasn't warfare. It was…

625
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:32,295
it was murder.

626
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,759
Yeah, and I've--
I've had enough of killing.

627
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,847
That's not why I'm here.

628
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,267
So what is this all about?

629
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,271
After Laeddis vanished…

630
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,567
I started doing some checking
on Ashecliffe.

631
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:59,697
A lot of people know about this place,
but no one wants to talk, you know?

632
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,867
It's like… it's like they're scared
or something.

633
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:07,872
You know, this place is funded
by a special grant…

634
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,667
from The House Un-American
Activities Committee?

635
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:15,463
HUAC? And how exactly
are we fighting the communists

636
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:17,256
from an island in Boston Harbor?

637
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:20,927
By conducting experiments on the mind.

638
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,806
-At least, that's my guess.
-And you think that's going on here?

639
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,850
Like I said, no one would talk, right?

640
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,686
Till I found somebody
who used to be a patient here.

641
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:35,233
Guy's name is George Noyce.
Nice college kid. Socialist.

642
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,735
He gets offered some money
to do a psych study.

643
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,238
-Guess what they were testing?
-Toothpaste.

644
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,698
So, he starts seeing dragons everywhere.

645
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:47,870
He almost beats his professor to death.
Ends up here in Ashecliffe, Ward C.

646
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:51,958
They release him after one year, right?
And what does he do?

647
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,835
Two weeks on the mainland,
he walks into a bar…

648
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:57,004
-[claps hands together]
-…stabs three men to death.

649
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,050
His lawyer pleads insanity.
But Noyce-- Noyce, he stands up

650
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:04,720
in the courtroom and he--
he begs the judge for the electric chair.

651
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:06,555
Anywhere but a mental hospital.

652
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,850
Judge gives him life in Dedham Prison.

653
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,354
-And you found him.
-Yeah, I found him.

654
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:16,607
Well, he's… he's a mess.

655
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,278
But it's pretty clear
from what he tells me.

656
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:23,572
-What?
-They're experimenting on people here.

657
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:25,616
I don't know, boss.

658
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:30,621
-How do you believe a crazy guy?
-That's the beauty of it, isn't it?

659
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,623
Crazy people,
they're the perfect subjects.

660
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,667
They talk, nobody listens.

661
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:36,919
I stood at Dachau.

662
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:41,549
We-- we saw what human beings
are capable of doing to each other, right?

663
00:46:42,425 --> 00:46:45,011
For Christ's sakes, we fought
a goddamn war to stop them,

664
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:47,346
and now-- now I find out
it may be happening here?

665
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,307
On our soil? No.

666
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:53,060
So, what are you really here to do, Ted?

667
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,940
I'm gonna get the proof,
I'm gonna go back,

668
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:01,902
and I'm gonna blow the lid off this place.
That's it.

669
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:04,447
Wait a minute.

670
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:07,825
You started asking around
about Ashecliffe,

671
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,661
waiting for a chance to get out here,
and then, suddenly,

672
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:11,912
they need a U.S. Marshal?

673
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:13,581
Yeah.

674
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:15,499
I got lucky. There was a patient escape.

675
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:17,501
-It was the perfect excuse.
-No, no, no, boss.

676
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:18,961
Luck doesn't work that way.

677
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,339
The world doesn't work that way.

678
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:24,550
They got an electrified fence
around a septic facility.

679
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,470
Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?

680
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:31,766
A Chief of Staff with ties to the OSS?
Funding from HUAC?

681
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,225
I mean, Jesus Christ.

682
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:36,354
Everything about this place stinks
of government ops.

683
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:37,772
What if they wanted you here?

684
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:39,774
-Bullshit.
-You were asking questions.

685
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:40,858
-Bullshit! Bullshit!
-Bullshit.

686
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,276
We came here for Rachel Solando.

687
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,653
Where-- where's one shred of evidence
she even existed?

688
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:47,656
There's no way they could've known
I'd be assigned to this case.

689
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,450
-There's no way.
-What if while you were looking into them,

690
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,743
they were looking into you?

691
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:54,580
All they had to do was fake an escape
to get you here and now they have you.

692
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,582
Now they have us both. Here! Now!

693
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:02,421
[McPherson on megaphone]
<i>Marshals, are you out here?</i>

694
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:04,757
<i>This is Deputy Warden McPherson.</i>

695
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:09,303
-<i>Marshals!</i>
-How about that? They found us, huh?

696
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,972
It's an island, boss.
They're always gonna find us.

697
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:14,683
[McPherson]<i> I know you're in there.</i>

698
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:20,022
We're getting off this goddamn island.
You and me. Come on!

699
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,611
-Come on!
-Go, go!

700
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:38,999
[McPherson] Get dried off.
Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you, now.

701
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:42,837
And hurry up! This thing is turning
into a goddamn hurricane!

702
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:52,012
I dropped those suits off to be cleaned.
They should be ready by tomorrow.

703
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,473
That is if we all don't wash away first.

704
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:59,812
You know, speaking of which, I'm afraid
your smokes are pretty much done for.

705
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:01,689
So…

706
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:04,900
This is our only choice, huh?

707
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:08,571
Got something really nice in a prison gray
if that don't work for you.

708
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,198
Now that you mention it,
these are just fine.

709
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:15,661
That's why I must repeat my insistence
that all Ward C patients

710
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,204
be placed in manual restraints.

711
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:21,208
If the facility floods,
they'll drown. You know that.

712
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:23,043
That would take a lot of flooding.

713
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:25,045
[Dr. Cawley] We're on an island
in the middle of the ocean

714
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:28,549
during a hurricane. A lot of flooding
seems like a distinct possibility.

715
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,051
[doctor] It's a gamble, Stephen.
Say the power fails.

716
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:32,344
There's a backup generator.

717
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:35,139
And if that goes,
the cell doors will open.

718
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:37,850
Where are they going to go?

719
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:42,062
They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over
to the mainland and wreak havoc.

720
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,230
[Dr. Naehring] You're quite right.

721
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:46,233
They're far more likely
to wreak havoc right here on us.

722
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,069
If they're manacled to the floor,
they'll die.

723
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:51,989
This is 24 human beings.

724
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,450
And you can live with that, can you?

725
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,243
[Dr. Naehring]
Well, frankly, if it were up to me,

726
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:59,955
I'd put all 42 in Wards A and B
in manual restraints as well.

727
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,666
-Excuse me! Excuse me.
-[Dr. Cawley] Marshal.

728
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,586
I-- I'm sorry, doctor.
I just have one quick question.

729
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,963
-Yes, I'll be with you in a moment.
-When we spoke this morning

730
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:09,798
about Rachel Solando's note…

731
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,717
"The law of four." I love that.

732
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,554
You said you had no idea what that
second line could refer to, correct?

733
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:19,808
"Who is 67?"
Yes, I'm afraid I still don't.

734
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,310
-None of us do.
-[Teddy] Uh-huh.

735
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,354
Nothing comes to mind?

736
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,191
Nothing?

737
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:36,075
Because I believe I just heard you say
there are 24 patients in Ward C,

738
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:39,036
and 42 patients in Wards A and B,

739
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,540
which means there's a total of, what,
66 patients at this facility?

740
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,292
That is correct, yes.

741
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:51,006
Well, it seems to me
Rachel Solando was suggesting

742
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:55,010
that you have a 67th patient, doctor.

743
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:57,680
But I'm afraid we don't.

744
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:00,516
This is ridiculous.
What are they doing here?

745
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:02,351
We're doing our goddamn job.

746
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:05,271
Didn't McPherson tell you the good news?

747
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,357
No. What's the good news, doctor?

748
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,568
Rachel's been found.

749
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:13,237
She's here.

750
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,781
Safe and sound.

751
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,253
There's not a mark on her.

752
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:34,592
Who are these men?

753
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:39,763
Why are they in my house?

754
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:44,435
Police officers, Rachel.
They… have a few questions.

755
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:49,148
Ma'am…

756
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:55,404
there has been a sighting
of a known communist…

757
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:58,907
subversive in this area,
passing out literature.

758
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:02,077
Here?

759
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:05,497
In this neighborhood?

760
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,541
Yes, I'm afraid so.

761
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:12,379
Now if you could tell us
what you did yesterday, where you were,

762
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,132
it would really help us narrow
down our search.

763
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:17,760
Yes. Um…

764
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:21,889
Well, I…

765
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,102
I made breakfast for Jim and the children.

766
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:30,522
And then, I…

767
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:34,777
packed Jim's lunch and he left.

768
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:40,741
Then, I sent the children off to school.

769
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:46,747
And then…

770
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,256
I decided to take a long swim in the lake.

771
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:04,515
I see.

772
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:09,603
And after that?

773
00:53:14,483 --> 00:53:16,151
[inhales deeply] Um…

774
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,029
After that…

775
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:30,249
I thought of you.

776
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,801
I'm-- I'm sorry, ma'am. I--
I don't know what you're talking about.

777
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:46,432
Don't you know how lonely I've been, Jim?

778
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:53,647
You're gone.

779
00:53:57,985 --> 00:53:58,986
You're dead.

780
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,076
I cry every night.

781
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:08,662
[sobs]

782
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:14,251
How am I supposed to survive?

783
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:17,796
-God.
-[Rachel crying]

784
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:30,768
Rachel, it'll be all right.

785
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:35,814
I'm so sorry, but every…

786
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,569
everything's gonna be all right. Okay?

787
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:43,822
I buried you.

788
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:49,411
I buried an empty casket.
Your body rained down lumps

789
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:52,790
of flesh splashing into the sea,
eaten by sharks.

790
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,254
My Jim's dead, so who the fuck are you?

791
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:04,635
Who the fuck are you?

792
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,553
-Who are you?
-[guard] Hey, hey, hey, hey.

793
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:08,013
-Who are you?
-It's okay. Rachel. It is okay.

794
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:11,683
-[guard] It's all right.
-[Rachel] Let me go! No! Get off!

795
00:55:12,518 --> 00:55:14,394
-[guard] Rachel, it's okay.
-[Dr. Cawley] Look at me, look at me.

796
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:16,313
-[Rachel crying]
-[Dr. Cawley] Shh.

797
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:17,815
-[lightning strikes]
-[thunder rumbling]

798
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:20,859
I'm sorry about that.
I-- I didn't want to interrupt.

799
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:22,903
I thought she might tell you something.
But,

800
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,949
we found her down by the lighthouse,
skipping stones.

801
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,660
We've no idea how she got out, but,

802
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:32,120
I'm gonna have to ask you
to go down into the basement.

803
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:33,997
There's food, water, and cots.

804
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:37,209
It's the safest place to be,
when the hurricane hits.

805
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,173
Are you all right? You look pale.

806
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:45,342
I'm fine. It's just…

807
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:48,762
[Chuck] Boss, are you okay?

808
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:52,182
It's just so, so goddamn bright, isn't it?

809
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,643
Photosensitivity, headaches, sometimes.

810
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:57,771
-Marshal, are you having a migraine?
-[Teddy] I'll be all right.

811
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:01,567
-[Teddy] Ah.
-[thunder rumbling]

812
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,277
[Chuck] Come on, come on, I got you.

813
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:05,737
-[coughs]
-[Chuck] What's wrong with him?

814
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:08,031
Take these, Marshal.
Couple of hours,

815
00:56:08,172 --> 00:56:09,972
-you'll be as clear as a bell.
-[Chuck] What's wrong with him?

816
00:56:10,056 --> 00:56:10,993
He's having a migraine.

817
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,287
Imagine someone sawed open your head,
filled it with razors,

818
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,914
and shook it as hard as they could.
Take the pills, Marshal.

819
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:18,292
-I don't-- I don't want the pills.
-It'll stop the pain.

820
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,085
Marshal, take the pills.

821
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,632
He's going to need to lie down.

822

There's broken glass all over the floor.

825

-Make sure the meds are locked up.
-Watch your back.

826
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,519
[nurse]
Make sure everything's okay in Ward B.

[indistinct clamor]

828
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:47,404
-[Chuck] Over here. All right, boss.
-Yeah, that's it.

829
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,488
-[guard] You have him?
-[Chuck] Yes.

830
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:49,865
[guard] Careful. All right.

831
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:54,202
Could be worse right now.
He'll be all right.

832
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:01,752
Who is that?

833
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:04,671
[guard] Him? That's the warden.

834
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:09,092
Don't you worry about him, all right?

835
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,678
Come on. Lay back. Lay back.

836
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:19,186
He looks like an ex-military prick, huh?

837
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,313
Well, you know what?
I ain't gonna argue with you on that one.

Yeah.

857

No hard feelings.

858

A little something for later.

859
01:00:15,654 --> 01:00:17,864

Why didn't you save me?

[Teddy]
The guy I told you about, George Noyce?

912

He told me this is where they keep
the worst ones.

Guys even the other inmates are scared of.

914
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:26,297
Did Noyce give you anything
on the layout?

915
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:27,674
Not really.

916
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:30,510
All he remembered was people screaming
day and night,

917

-Trust me, son, you haven't heard shit.

We got most of the bugsies locked
down now,

926
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,341
but some of them are still loose.

927

And if you see one, don't try
to restrain him yourselves.

These fuckers will kill you. Clear?

all right?

942
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,821
I mean, why would anybody want to?

943
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:40,700
We hear things here
about the outside world.

944
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:44,329
-About atolls, about H-bomb tests.
-[Chuck] Teddy, where are you?

945
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:46,581
You know how a hydrogen bomb works?

946
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:49,834
-I know. With hydrogen! With hydrogen.
-That's funny.

947
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:52,837
-Boss!
-Other bombs explode, right?

948
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:55,214
-But not the hydrogen bomb.
-[pants]

949
01:08:55,381 --> 01:09:00,678
It implodes, creating an explosion
to the thousandth, the millionth degree!

950
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:02,889
-Do you get it?
-Yeah! Yeah.

951
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:04,515
-Do you?
-I get it, I get it!

952
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:05,600
[Chuck] Let him go!

953
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:06,934
-[Teddy groans]
-screams]

954
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,521
[Chuck] No!

955
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:18,821
-[Teddy groaning]
-[inmate choking]

956
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:21,783
[Chuck] No! No!

957
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:24,243
What are you doing?

958
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:27,872
Jesus Christ, Teddy. Jesus!

959
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:31,918
You got Billings?
What the fuck's the matter with you guys?

960
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:33,378
Catch them, not kill them!

961
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:35,963
-He jumped us.
-[guard] You, give me a hand with him.

962
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:38,675
We've gotta get him to the infirmary.
Goddamn it.

963
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:42,553
No, no! Not you, not you.
Take a walk. Come on.

964
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:45,181
Cawley's gonna have
my goddamn balls for this.

965
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:18,798
[man whispers] Laeddis.

966
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:36,399
[loud footsteps running]

967
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:40,236
[man whispers] Laeddis.

968
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:45,241
[groaning]

969
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:49,620
[indistinct chanting]

970
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:53,958
[man] Stop me, please,

971
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:55,835
before I kill more.

972
01:10:58,004 --> 01:11:00,339
Stop me before I kill more.

973
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,550
[man whispers] Laeddis.

974
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:10,224
[man screaming]

975
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,685
[man 1] Please, please.

976
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:18,649
[man 2] I see you all.

977
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:22,820
[man whispers] Laeddis.

978
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:34,665
You told me I'd be free of this place.
You promised.

979
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:38,127
You lied.

980
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:39,754
Laeddis.

981
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:47,011
-Laeddis?
-[man laughs]

982
01:11:48,763 --> 01:11:50,181
[man] That's pretty damn funny.

983
01:11:52,517 --> 01:11:54,811
-Your voice.
-Don't you recognize it?

984
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,855
After all the talks we had?

985
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:01,025
After all the lies you told me?

986
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:02,735
Let me see your face.

987
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,029
They say I'm theirs now.

988
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:08,324
They say I'll never leave here.

989
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:11,953
Your match is about to go out.

990
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:17,458
-Let me see your goddamn face! Now!
-Why?

991
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,794
So you can lie to me more?

992
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,713
-This isn't about the truth.
-Yes, it is.

993
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:25,341
-It's about exposing the truth.
-It's about you!

994
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:28,135
And Laeddis.

995
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:30,930
That's all it's ever been about.

996
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:34,350
I was incidental.

997
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:36,602
A way in.

998
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:40,773
George…

999
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:42,608
George Noyce.

1000
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:44,527
No.

1001
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:48,155
-It's not possible. You can't be here.
-You like it?

1002
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:51,826
Who did this to you, George?

1003
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:53,286
You did.

1004
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,121
What the hell do you mean?

1005
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:59,250
All your talk. All your fucking talk.
And I'm back in here because of you.

1006
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:02,128
George, how did-- how did they get you
out of Dedham, huh?

1007
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:04,922
However this happened,
I-- I'm gonna find a way to fix this,

1008
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:06,591
-you understand me?
-I'll never get out now.

1009
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:09,594
I got out once. Not twice, never twice.

1010
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:11,470
Just tell me how they got you here.

1011
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,265
They knew! Don't you get it?

1012
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:17,685
Everything you were up to.
Your whole plan.

1013
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:22,189
This is a game. All of this, is for you.

1014
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:24,609
You're not investigating anything.

1015
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:27,445
You're a fucking rat in a maze.

1016
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:32,325
Georgie, George, you're wrong.
You're wrong.

1017
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:34,368
Really?

1018
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:36,412
Been alone much since you got here?

1019
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:40,207
I mean, I've been with my partner.

1020
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,418
You never worked with him before,
have you?

1021
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,506
He's a-- he's a U.S. Marshal. He's--

1022
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:49,759
You never worked with him before,
have you?

1023
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:57,058
George, look, I-- I know people.
I-- I trust this man.

1024
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:03,522
Then, they've already won.

1025
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:08,027
Fuck.

1026
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:15,952
And they're gonna take me
to the lighthouse.

1027
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:19,455
They're gonna cut into my brain.

1028
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:24,168
And I'm only here because of you!

1029
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:27,421
George, I'm…
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1030
01:14:27,505 --> 01:14:29,924
You're not going to the lighthouse.
You're not.

1031
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:32,802
You can't dig out the truth
and kill Laeddis at the same time.

1032
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:35,680
You gotta make a choice.
You understand that, don't you?

1033
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:39,433
-I'm not here to kill anyone.
-Liar!

1034
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:42,687
I'm not gonna kill him, I swear to you!
I swear.

1035
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:44,230
She's dead.

1036
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:46,816
She-- let her go.

1037
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:49,735
Let her go.

1038
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,823
[Dolores] Tell him, Teddy. Tell him why.

1039
01:14:57,118 --> 01:14:58,786
[George]
You gotta do it. There's no other way.

1040
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:01,872
-Let her go.
-Tell him about the day

1041
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:04,542
-you brought me my locket.
-[George] You gotta do it!

1042
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:08,587
How I told you my heart
was breaking and you asked me why.

1043
01:15:08,713 --> 01:15:11,382
She's fucking with your head.

1044
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:13,342
And I told you it was from happiness.

1045
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:15,803
She's gonna kill you.
She's gonna kill you.

1046
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:22,143
You wanna uncover the truth?
You gotta let her go.

1047
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,063
-I can't.
-You have to let her go!

1048
01:15:26,147 --> 01:15:28,024
I can't! I can't.

1049
01:15:34,905 --> 01:15:36,741
Then, you'll never leave this island.

1050
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:44,206
Dolores.

1051
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,757
He's not in this ward.

1052
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:58,220
He was transferred… out of here.

1053
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:01,974
If he's not in Ward A,

1054
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:05,019
there's only one place he can be.

1055
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:12,193
The lighthouse.

1056
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:20,993
[George] Hey…

1057
01:16:23,496 --> 01:16:24,497
God help you.

1058
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:36,759
[Chuck] Boss, we got problems.
McPherson and Cawley are in the building.

1059
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:39,678
They heard an orderly went batshit
on a patient.

1060
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:42,431
They're looking all over the place for him
and they're on their way to the roof.

1061
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:44,433
Let's get the hell out of here. This way.

1062
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,355
Just keep going. We belong here.

1063
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:55,444
[Teddy grunts]

1064
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:00,783
What happened to you?

1065
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:03,119
-What do you mean?
-I mean,

1066
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:04,703
where were you?

1067
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:09,458
After we got that guy to the infirmary,
I took a little detour to patient records.

1068
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:11,627
Did you ever find Laeddis?

1069
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:14,547
No. No, I never found him.

1070
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,133
Well, I got the next best thing.
His intake form.

1071
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,802
It was the only thing in his files.
There's no session notes,

1072
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:23,055
no incident reports, no photographs,
just this. It was weird.

1073
01:17:23,681 --> 01:17:24,974
Here. Take a look.

1074
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:27,268
I'll look at it later.

1075
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,521
What's the matter, boss?

1076
01:17:31,522 --> 01:17:32,815
I'll look it over later, that's all.

1077
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:39,280
-Ashecliffe's that way.
-I'm not going to Ashecliffe.

1078
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,324
I'm going to that lighthouse.

1079
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:45,327
I'm gonna find out
what the fuck is happening on this island.

1080
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:00,509
There it is.

1081
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:05,472
Damn. We're too far south.
We're gonna have to double back.

1082
01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:07,600
There's no way we could cross
those rocks.

1083
01:18:08,142 --> 01:18:09,894
There could be a way
behind those trees.

1084
01:18:09,977 --> 01:18:12,479
Maybe, maybe a path that goes
around the rocks and leads over

1085
01:18:12,563 --> 01:18:14,481
-to the lighthouse, come on.
-Boss, wait, wait, what are we doing?

1086
01:18:14,565 --> 01:18:16,066
We got the intake form.

1087
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:19,486
It's proof there's a 67th patient,
which they said, repeatedly,

1088
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:20,571
doesn't exist.

1089
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:24,992
I'm getting to that lighthouse.
You understand?

1090
01:18:27,328 --> 01:18:29,079
What the hell can I say to you
to stop you?

1091
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:31,123
Why-- why would you want to, Chuck? Why?

1092
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,417
Because climbing down there when it's dark

1093
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:36,128
is a thin step short of suicide,
that's why.

1094
01:18:36,795 --> 01:18:37,796
Okay.

1095
01:18:38,589 --> 01:18:40,174
Maybe you better sit this one out then.

1096
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,510
You brought me into this, boss,

1097
01:18:44,011 --> 01:18:46,055
and now we're trapped here on this rock,

1098
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:48,849
on this island, with no one
to rely on but each other.

1099
01:18:48,933 --> 01:18:50,893
And now you're, you're acting like--

1100
01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:52,353
Like what? Like what?

1101
01:18:52,937 --> 01:18:53,979
How am I acting?

1102
01:18:58,609 --> 01:19:00,986
What the hell happened back there
in those cells, Ted?

1103
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:08,953
What do you think the weather's like
in Portland, Chuck?

1104
01:19:10,329 --> 01:19:11,455
I'm from Seattle.

1105
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:15,584
Seattle.

1106
01:19:18,963 --> 01:19:21,757
I'm going on… alone.

1107
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:27,471
-I'm going with you, boss.
-I said alone.

1108
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:30,266
Fine.

1109
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:37,731
[Teddy gasping]

1110
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:58,043
Damn it!

1111
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:00,379
Damn it.

1112
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:09,638
I knew it wouldn't take long,
but I couldn't get to it. The tide was up.

1113
01:20:18,605 --> 01:20:19,606
Chuck!

1114
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:23,319
Chuck!

1115
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:26,131
Come on!

1116
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:42,731
[waves crashing]

1117
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:02,751
Chuck!

1118
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:05,254
Where are you, Chuck?

1119
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:07,589
[rat squeaking]

1120
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:13,429
[rats squeaking]

1121
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:30,904
Chuck!

1122
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:33,824
Chuck!

1123
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:42,332
[rats squeaking]

1124
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:08,275
[fire crackling]

1125
01:23:17,618 --> 01:23:19,286
[pants] Who are you?

1126
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:24,791
I'm Teddy Daniels. I'm a cop.

1127
01:23:26,251 --> 01:23:27,252
You're the Marshal.

1128
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:30,005
That's right.

1129
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:36,637
Would you mind taking your hand
from behind your back, please?

1130
01:23:36,762 --> 01:23:39,056
Why? Why? [panting]

1131
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:42,059
I wanna make sure
that what you're holding won't hurt me.

1132
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:51,818
I'm gonna keep this…

1133
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:54,947
if you don't mind.

1134
01:23:56,281 --> 01:23:57,282
[Teddy] Fine by me.

1135
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:07,834
You're…

1136
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:10,963
you're Rachel Solando.

1137
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:13,882
The real one.

1138
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,596
Did you kill your children?

1139
01:24:21,682 --> 01:24:22,891
I never had children.

1140
01:24:24,268 --> 01:24:25,435
I was never married.

1141
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:30,691
And before I was a patient
at Ashecliffe, I worked here.

1142
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:34,111
You-- you were a nurse?

1143
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:38,156
I was a doctor, Marshal.

1144
01:24:42,035 --> 01:24:43,036
You think I'm crazy.

1145
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:46,748
-No. No, no, I never--
-And if I say I'm not crazy?

1146
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:49,876
Well, that hardly helps, does it?

1147
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,672
That's the Kafkaesque genius of it.

1148
01:24:57,634 --> 01:24:59,595
People tell the world you're crazy,

1149
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:03,056
and all your protests to the contrary
just confirm what they're saying.

1150
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,686
I'm-- I'm not following you. I'm sorry.

1151
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:09,855
Once you're declared insane,

1152
01:25:10,397 --> 01:25:13,775
then anything you do
is called part of that insanity.

1153
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:16,194
Reasonable protests are denial.

1154
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:19,656
Valid fears, paranoia.

1155
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:23,493
Survival instincts
are defense mechanisms.

1156
01:25:24,077 --> 01:25:26,788
You're smarter than you look, Marshal.
That's probably not a good thing.

1157
01:25:28,707 --> 01:25:30,834
-Tell me something.
-Yeah.

1158
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,879
What happened to you?

1159
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,840
I started asking
about these large shipments

1160
01:25:36,923 --> 01:25:40,218
of sodium amytal
and opium-based hallucinogens.

1161
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:41,845
Psychotropic drugs.

1162
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:45,015
I asked about the surgeries, too.

1163
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:49,895
You ever heard of a transorbital lobotomy?

1164
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:53,440
They zap the patient with electroshock,

1165
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:56,943
then go through the eye with an ice pick.

1166
01:25:59,488 --> 01:26:00,864
Pull out some nerve fibers.

1167
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:03,158
Huh.

1168
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:05,619
Makes the patients much more obedient.

1169
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:07,579
Tractable.

1170
01:26:09,373 --> 01:26:10,374
It's barbaric.

1171
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:12,751
Unconscionable.

1172
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:18,048
Do you know how pain enters the body,
Marshal? Do you?

1173
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:21,259
-Depends on where you're hurt?
-No.

1174
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:26,014
It has nothing to do with the flesh.
The brain controls pain.

1175
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:30,894
The brain controls fear, empathy, sleep,
hunger, anger, everything.

1176
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:34,690
What if you could control it?

1177
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:38,819
-You mean, the brain?
-Recreate a man,

1178
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:41,279
so he doesn't feel pain,

1179
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:44,032
or love or-- or sympathy.

1180
01:26:45,492 --> 01:26:49,621
A man who can't be interrogated,
because he has no memories to confess.

1181
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:55,085
You can never take away
all a man's memories.

1182
01:26:55,669 --> 01:26:56,670
-Never.
-Marshal,

1183
01:26:56,753 --> 01:26:59,798
the North Koreans used American POWs,

1184
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:02,050
during their brainwashing experiments.

1185
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:05,470
They turned soldiers into traitors.
That's what they're doing here.

1186
01:27:05,595 --> 01:27:07,723
They're creating ghosts
to go out in the world

1187
01:27:07,806 --> 01:27:09,808
and do things sane men--

1188
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:12,644
-sane men never would.
-To have that kind of ability,

1189
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:13,729
that kind of knowledge,

1190
01:27:13,812 --> 01:27:16,940
-that-- that would take years.
-Years. Years of research.

1191
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:19,568
Hundreds of patients to experiment on.

1192
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:23,697
Fifty years from now,
people will look back

1193
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:26,908
and say, here, this place,
is where it all began.

1194
01:27:27,784 --> 01:27:30,078
The Nazis used the Jews,
Soviets used prisoners

1195
01:27:30,203 --> 01:27:32,247
in their own Gulags, and we…

1196
01:27:33,457 --> 01:27:36,793
we tested patients… on Shutter Island.

1197
01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:39,713
No, they won't.

1198
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:42,299
No.

1199
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:45,886
You do understand…

1200
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:51,016
that they can't let you leave.

1201
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:55,270
I am a federal Marshal.
They can't stop me.

1202
01:27:56,563 --> 01:27:58,732
I was an esteemed psychiatrist,

1203
01:28:00,066 --> 01:28:01,735
from a respected family.

1204
01:28:03,862 --> 01:28:04,905
Didn't matter.

1205
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,242
Let me ask you.

1206
01:28:09,826 --> 01:28:11,453
Any past traumas in your life?

1207
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:14,581
Yes.

1208
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:17,709
But why-- why would that matter?

1209
01:28:18,043 --> 01:28:20,462
Because they're gonna point
to some event in your past

1210
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:22,547
and say it's the reason
you lost your sanity.

1211
01:28:23,089 --> 01:28:28,303
So that when they commit you here,
your friends and colleagues will say,

1212
01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:29,721
"Of course, he cracked."

1213
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:32,891
"Who wouldn't after
what he'd been through?"

1214
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:35,393
They can say that about anyone,
anyone at all.

1215
01:28:35,477 --> 01:28:37,437
The point is they're gonna say it
about you.

1216
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:42,692
How's your head?

1217
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:45,153
My-- my head?

1218
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:48,740
Any funny dreams lately?
Trouble sleeping?

1219
01:28:51,076 --> 01:28:52,911
-Headaches?
-I--

1220
01:28:53,912 --> 01:28:56,498
-I am prone to migraines, yes.
-Jesus.

1221
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:02,671
You haven't taken any pills, have you?
I mean, even aspirin?

1222
01:29:02,796 --> 01:29:04,714
-The-- the aspirin?
-Jesus.

1223
01:29:05,549 --> 01:29:07,509
And you-- you ate the food
in the cafeteria,

1224
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:09,010
and drunk the coffee they gave you?

1225
01:29:09,219 --> 01:29:12,013
You tell me, at least, that
you've been smoking your own cigarettes.

1226
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:15,559
No.

1227
01:29:16,726 --> 01:29:17,727
No.

1228
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,021
No, I haven't.

1229
01:29:20,230 --> 01:29:23,191
It takes 36 to 48 hours
for neuroleptic narcotics

1230
01:29:23,316 --> 01:29:25,694
to reach workable levels
in the bloodstream.

1231
01:29:27,571 --> 01:29:28,697
Palsy comes first…

1232
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:32,367
first the fingertips,
then eventually the whole hand.

1233
01:29:34,828 --> 01:29:38,874
Seen any walking nightmares lately,
Marshal, huh?

1234
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:43,420
Tell me what goes on in that lighthouse.

1235
01:29:45,338 --> 01:29:46,339
Tell me.

1236
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:48,884
Brain surgery.

1237
01:29:50,093 --> 01:29:52,888
The "Let's open the skull and see
what happens if we pull on this" kind.

1238
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:56,850
The learned it from the Nazis kind.

1239
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:01,605
That's where they create the ghosts.

1240
01:30:03,857 --> 01:30:07,611
Who knows about this?
On the island, I mean. Who?

1241
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:11,281
Everyone.

1242
01:30:11,448 --> 01:30:15,035
Come on. The-- the nurses?
The-- the orderlies?

1243
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:18,246
-They-- they couldn't possibly know.
-Everyone.

1244
01:30:38,016 --> 01:30:39,100
You can't stay here.

1245
01:30:40,185 --> 01:30:41,436
They think I'm dead, that I drowned.

1246
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:43,730
I'm afraid if they come looking for you,
they might find me.

1247
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:46,274
I'm sorry, but you have to go.

1248
01:30:53,573 --> 01:30:54,741
I'm gonna come back for you.

1249
01:30:55,283 --> 01:30:57,994
I won't be here. I move during the day.
New places every night.

1250
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:00,664
But I could come get you--
get you off this island.

1251
01:31:00,747 --> 01:31:02,499
Haven't you heard a word I've said?

1252
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:06,753
The only way off the island is the ferry,
and they control it.

1253
01:31:07,837 --> 01:31:08,964
You'll never leave here.

1254
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,183
I had a friend.

1255
01:31:21,059 --> 01:31:23,436
I was with him yesterday,
but we got separated.

1256
01:31:24,646 --> 01:31:25,647
Have you seen him?

1257
01:31:27,524 --> 01:31:28,525
Marshal…

1258
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:31,611
you have no friends.

1259
01:31:36,449 --> 01:31:37,534
[Teddy groans]

1260
01:31:51,214 --> 01:31:53,675
[birds chirping]

1261
01:32:04,811 --> 01:32:05,979
There you are.

1262
01:32:09,315 --> 01:32:10,942
We were wondering when you'd show up.

1263
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:14,487
Have a seat.

1264
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:16,573
Come on.

1265
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:29,627
Taking a leisurely stroll, were we?

1266
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:34,132
I was just-- just looking around.

1267
01:32:37,302 --> 01:32:39,012
Did you enjoy God's latest gift?

1268
01:32:41,264 --> 01:32:42,515
-What?
-God's gift.

1269
01:32:44,768 --> 01:32:45,769
The violence.

1270
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:53,276
When I came downstairs in my home
and I saw that tree in my living room,

1271
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:57,197
it reached out for me, like a divine hand.

1272
01:32:59,449 --> 01:33:00,867
God loves violence.

1273
01:33:04,037 --> 01:33:06,748
-I-- I hadn't noticed.
-[chuckles] Sure, you have.

1274
01:33:07,916 --> 01:33:09,501
Why else would there be so much of it?

1275
01:33:10,543 --> 01:33:13,004
It's in us. It's what we are.

1276
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:17,550
We wage war, we burn sacrifices,

1277
01:33:17,634 --> 01:33:20,095
and pillage and plunder and tear
at the flesh of our brothers.

1278
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:22,806
And why?
Because God gave us violence

1279
01:33:22,889 --> 01:33:24,182
to wage in his honor.

1280
01:33:27,393 --> 01:33:29,354
I thought God gave us moral order.

1281
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:32,065
There's no moral order
as pure as this storm.

1282
01:33:33,483 --> 01:33:34,943
There's no moral order at all.

1283
01:33:36,069 --> 01:33:39,364
There's just this,
can my violence conquer yours?

1284
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:46,996
-I'm not violent.
-Yes, you are.

1285
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:50,333
You're as violent as they come.

1286
01:33:51,835 --> 01:33:54,254
I know this because I'm as violent
as they come.

1287
01:33:55,588 --> 01:33:57,674
If the constraints of society were lifted,

1288
01:33:57,799 --> 01:34:00,468
and I was all that stood
between you and a meal,

1289
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:03,680
you would crack my skull with a rock
and eat my meaty parts.

1290
01:34:05,849 --> 01:34:06,850
Wouldn't you?

1291
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:12,647
Cawley thinks you're harmless,
that you can be controlled,

1292
01:34:12,772 --> 01:34:13,815
but I know different.

1293
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:17,235
-You don't know me.
-Oh, but I do.

1294
01:34:17,318 --> 01:34:19,279
-No, you don't. You don't know me at all.
-I know you.

1295
01:34:20,238 --> 01:34:21,948
We've known each other for centuries.

1296
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:35,378
If I was to sink my teeth
into your eye right now,

1297
01:34:35,461 --> 01:34:38,089
would you be able to stop me
before I blinded you?

1298
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:43,803
Give it a try.

1299
01:34:46,014 --> 01:34:47,223
That's the spirit.

1300
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:22,133
[indistinct chatter]

1301
01:35:22,467 --> 01:35:25,094
[Dr. Cawley] Don't worry because we're
gonna get you back to your room.

1302
01:35:26,763 --> 01:35:28,306
-Not really.
-Something I've seen.

1303
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:29,474
Okay.

1304
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:35,897
Where have you been?

1305
01:35:37,148 --> 01:35:39,484
Just wandering.
Just looking at your island.

1306
01:35:39,609 --> 01:35:42,111
Oh, I forgot you're leaving,
now that Rachel's been found.

1307
01:35:44,489 --> 01:35:46,032
-[man] Stop looking at him.
-For sure. Yeah.

1308
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:48,243
Stop looking at him.

1309
01:35:48,952 --> 01:35:50,787
-Big meeting?
-Oh, yes.

1310
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:52,538
-It's okay. I'm--
-I don't like that.

1311
01:35:52,664 --> 01:35:56,209
Apparently, there was an unidentified man
in Ward C yesterday.

1312
01:35:56,334 --> 01:35:59,379
He subdued a highly dangerous patient
quite handily.

1313
01:36:00,463 --> 01:36:02,382
-Is that so?
-It seems he had a long conversation

1314
01:36:02,465 --> 01:36:04,759
with a paranoid schizophrenic,
George Noyce.

1315
01:36:05,343 --> 01:36:07,303
[Bridget] Well, I don't remember
what I'm supposed to remember.

1316
01:36:08,054 --> 01:36:09,639
We're gated down. We're fine.

1317
01:36:09,806 --> 01:36:13,601
This-- this Noyce, you said
his name was, he's delusional?

1318
01:36:13,977 --> 01:36:16,145
Extremely. He can be quite upsetting.

1319
01:36:16,688 --> 01:36:18,231
As a matter of fact, two weeks ago,

1320
01:36:18,398 --> 01:36:21,150
a patient got so wound up
by one of Noyce's stories

1321
01:36:21,276 --> 01:36:22,318
that he beat him up.

1322
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:25,238
-Hmm.
-Cigarette?

1323
01:36:26,114 --> 01:36:27,115
Oh.

1324
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:28,574
No, thanks. I quit.

1325
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:34,122
-So you're taking the ferry?
-Yes, absolutely. I…

1326
01:36:34,956 --> 01:36:37,041
I think we've gotten
all we came here for, so…

1327
01:36:37,959 --> 01:36:39,127
"We," Marshal?

1328
01:36:41,379 --> 01:36:42,714
Speaking of which, have you--

1329
01:36:43,673 --> 01:36:45,591
-have you seen him, Doctor?
-Who?

1330
01:36:46,968 --> 01:36:48,177
My partner, Chuck.

1331
01:36:51,055 --> 01:36:53,182
You don't have a partner, Marshal.
You came here alone.

1332
01:36:56,227 --> 01:36:58,521
You know, I've built
something valuable here,

1333
01:36:58,604 --> 01:37:01,774
and valuable things have a way
of being misunderstood in their own time.

1334
01:37:01,858 --> 01:37:03,943
Everyone wants a quick fix.
They always have.

1335
01:37:04,027 --> 01:37:07,739
I'm trying to do something that people,
yourself included, don't understand.

1336
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:09,907
And I'm not going to give up
without a fight.

1337
01:37:12,535 --> 01:37:13,536
I can see that.

1338
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:17,081
Hmm.

1339
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:19,751
So, tell me again about your partner.

1340
01:37:22,587 --> 01:37:23,588
What partner?

1341
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:26,424
-[indistinct]
-[laughs]

1342
01:37:27,133 --> 01:37:28,134
It's fine.

1343
01:37:31,554 --> 01:37:32,555
[scoffs]

1344
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:43,232
[music playing faintly]

1345
01:38:16,349 --> 01:38:19,811
[man] She made a mess. I cleaned it up.
She made a mess again.

1346
01:38:29,487 --> 01:38:30,488
Marshal.

1347
01:38:32,115 --> 01:38:33,157
Going somewhere?

1348
01:38:34,033 --> 01:38:35,326
I'm just-- just

1349
01:38:35,868 --> 01:38:37,620
-heading out to the ferry, so…
-Ah.

1350
01:38:38,037 --> 01:38:40,790
Well, I'm afraid,
I'm afraid it's the other way.

1351
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:43,167
Oh.

1352
01:38:44,252 --> 01:38:45,962
If you'll wait a moment, I'll…

1353
01:38:46,838 --> 01:38:49,006
find you someone
who can take you to the dock.

1354
01:38:53,553 --> 01:38:57,390
-What's this, Doctor, huh? What's this?
-It's-- it's just a sedative.

1355
01:38:57,682 --> 01:39:00,351
-A precaution.
-Oh, precaution.

1356
01:39:03,813 --> 01:39:07,150
What are you going to do?
Kill me? Marshal.

1357
01:39:08,067 --> 01:39:09,527
You think you deserve it?

1358
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:12,697
For what, hmm? Provoking you?

1359
01:39:13,364 --> 01:39:16,200
Well, forgive me.
What doesn't provoke you?

1360
01:39:16,742 --> 01:39:19,787
-Remarks? Words?
-Nazis?

1361
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:21,330
Well, that, too.

1362
01:39:22,331 --> 01:39:24,333
And, of course, memories and dreams.

1363
01:39:25,376 --> 01:39:29,755
Did you know that the word trauma comes
from the Greek "for wound"?

1364
01:39:30,381 --> 01:39:32,383
And what is the German word for dream?

1365
01:39:33,217 --> 01:39:35,344
[speaking German]

1366
01:39:36,804 --> 01:39:39,724
Wounds can create monsters, and you,

1367
01:39:40,349 --> 01:39:42,727
you are wounded, Marshal.

1368
01:39:43,769 --> 01:39:46,606
And wouldn't you agree,
when you see a monster,

1369
01:39:47,648 --> 01:39:48,816
you must stop it?

1370
01:39:50,109 --> 01:39:51,110
Yeah.

1371
01:39:52,361 --> 01:39:53,529
-I agree.
-Yes.

1372
01:39:55,031 --> 01:39:56,032
Yeah.

1373
01:39:56,282 --> 01:39:57,283
[muffled screams]

1374
01:40:13,299 --> 01:40:15,301
[guard] I told him that we'd take
about an hour to do it.

1375
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:16,332
Yeah.

1376
01:40:16,432 --> 01:40:18,304
[guard 1] Did they say
we're going to do the first floor?

1377
01:40:18,804 --> 01:40:20,056
[guard] How long you been on the clock?

1378
01:40:20,223 --> 01:40:23,768
-I've been on for 18 hours straight.
-[guard] Nice paycheck.

1379
01:40:40,952 --> 01:40:42,286
[Dolores] What are you doing, baby?

1380
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:50,086
-You gotta get to the ferry.
-No.

1381
01:40:51,337 --> 01:40:52,338
No, no.

1382
01:40:53,673 --> 01:40:54,674
Yeah.

1383
01:40:55,967 --> 01:41:00,012
If the world thinks that Chuck is dead,
then he's perfect for their experiments.

1384
01:41:01,931 --> 01:41:03,474
There's only one place they'd take him.

1385
01:41:06,978 --> 01:41:08,020
You go there, and you'll die.

1386
01:41:08,354 --> 01:41:10,189
He's my partner.
If they are hurting him,

1387
01:41:10,273 --> 01:41:12,650
if they're holding him against his will,
I've gotta bring him out.

1388
01:41:13,526 --> 01:41:14,652
I can't lose anyone else.

1389
01:41:15,695 --> 01:41:16,821
Don't go, Teddy, please.

1390
01:41:17,446 --> 01:41:19,240
-[echoes] Please, don't do this. Don't go.
-I'm sorry, honey.

1391
01:41:24,036 --> 01:41:25,037
I'm sorry, honey.

1392
01:41:26,831 --> 01:41:28,958
I love this thing
because you gave it to me.

1393
01:41:32,503 --> 01:41:33,504
The truth is…

1394
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:37,550
it's one fucking ugly tie.

1395
01:42:18,215 --> 01:42:19,216
No.

1396
01:43:40,381 --> 01:43:41,382
[grunts]

1397
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:42,591
Don't move! Stay where you are!

1398
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:46,011
Are you gonna kill me?

1399
01:43:47,722 --> 01:43:49,932
No, I'm not gonna kill you.

1400
01:43:52,017 --> 01:43:53,185
-[loud thud]
-[guard grunts]

1401
01:45:42,878 --> 01:45:44,338
Why are you all wet, baby?

1402
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:49,218
-What did you say?
-You know exactly what I said.

1403
01:46:03,274 --> 01:46:04,900
The rifle's empty, by the way.

1404
01:46:12,074 --> 01:46:13,075
Have a seat.

1405
01:46:20,082 --> 01:46:22,459
For God's sake, dry off.
You'll catch a cold.

1406
01:46:24,086 --> 01:46:25,087
All right.

1407
01:46:28,841 --> 01:46:30,551
How badly did you hurt the guard?

1408
01:46:32,469 --> 01:46:34,972
I-- I don't know
what you're talking about.

1409
01:46:38,434 --> 01:46:39,560
Yes, he's here.

1410
01:46:40,477 --> 01:46:43,397
Have Dr. Sheehan take a look at your man
before you send him up.

1411
01:46:44,690 --> 01:46:45,691
So…

1412
01:46:46,692 --> 01:46:49,320
Dr. Sheehan came in
on the ferry this morning, huh?

1413
01:46:50,446 --> 01:46:51,447
Not exactly.

1414
01:46:53,073 --> 01:46:55,326
You blew up my car.
I really loved that car.

1415
01:46:56,911 --> 01:46:58,245
Sorry to hear about that.

1416
01:47:02,291 --> 01:47:03,375
Tremors are getting pretty bad.

1417
01:47:05,252 --> 01:47:06,462
How are the hallucinations?

1418
01:47:07,838 --> 01:47:08,923
[Dolores] Get out of here, Teddy.

1419
01:47:10,132 --> 01:47:11,884
This place is gonna be the end of you.

1420
01:47:15,846 --> 01:47:17,723
-Not bad.
-They'll get worse.

1421
01:47:18,807 --> 01:47:19,808
I know.

1422
01:47:20,225 --> 01:47:21,644
Dr. Solando…

1423
01:47:22,895 --> 01:47:24,647
she told me about the neuroleptics.

1424
01:47:25,230 --> 01:47:27,608
Did she, now? And when was this?

1425
01:47:27,816 --> 01:47:30,235
I found her, Doctor, in a cave…

1426
01:47:30,736 --> 01:47:33,614
out by the cliffs.
But, you'll never get to her.

1427
01:47:33,906 --> 01:47:34,907
I don't doubt it…

1428
01:47:36,116 --> 01:47:37,576
considering she's not real.

1429
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:41,956
Your delusions are more severe
than I thought.

1430
01:47:44,166 --> 01:47:45,459
You're not on neuroleptics.

1431
01:47:46,710 --> 01:47:48,504
You're not on anything,
as a matter of fact.

1432
01:47:48,629 --> 01:47:51,256
Then what the fuck is this?
Huh? What the fuck is this?

1433
01:47:51,423 --> 01:47:52,424
Withdrawal.

1434
01:47:52,967 --> 01:47:54,134
With-- withdrawal?

1435
01:47:54,677 --> 01:47:56,261
From, from what?
I haven't had a goddamn drink

1436
01:47:56,345 --> 01:47:57,721
since I've been on this island.

1437
01:47:57,846 --> 01:47:58,847
Chlorpromazine.

1438
01:48:00,391 --> 01:48:03,394
I'm not a fan of pharmacology,
but I have to say, in your case…

1439
01:48:04,019 --> 01:48:06,689
-Chlo-- chloraproma what?
-Chlorpromazine.

1440
01:48:07,398 --> 01:48:11,235
The same thing we've been giving you
for the past 24 months.

1441
01:48:13,153 --> 01:48:14,613
So for the past two years, you--

1442
01:48:14,697 --> 01:48:18,033
you've had somebody slipping me drugs
in Boston, is that it?

1443
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:19,284
Not Boston.

1444
01:48:20,244 --> 01:48:21,245
Here.

1445
01:48:22,246 --> 01:48:26,375
You've been here for two years.
A patient of this institution.

1446
01:48:30,045 --> 01:48:31,880
After everything I've seen here, doctor,

1447
01:48:32,881 --> 01:48:36,385
you-- you really think
you're gonna convince me I'm crazy, huh?

1448
01:48:37,136 --> 01:48:39,263
Do you know the kind of people
that I deal with every day?

1449
01:48:39,346 --> 01:48:41,140
I'm a U.S. Marshal, for God's sakes.

1450
01:48:41,223 --> 01:48:43,142
You were a U.S. Marshal.

1451
01:48:43,225 --> 01:48:47,062
Here's a copy of the intake form.
You broke into Ward C-4.

1452
01:48:47,187 --> 01:48:49,857
Proof of the 67th patient.
If you'd gotten it to the mainland,

1453
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:51,564
you could have blown
the lid off this place.

1454
01:48:51,650 --> 01:48:53,014
-Wait. Where did-- Where did you--
-Yet somehow,

1455
01:48:53,235 --> 01:48:55,946
you couldn't find time to look at it.
Well, read it now.

1456
01:48:56,905 --> 01:48:57,906
Go ahead.

1457
01:49:02,161 --> 01:49:05,456
"Patient is highly intelligent,
highly delusional decorated Army veteran."

1458
01:49:05,998 --> 01:49:08,792
"Present for the liber--
Liberation of Dachau."

1459
01:49:09,918 --> 01:49:12,629
"F-- Former U.S. Marshal."
"Known proclivity for violence."

1460
01:49:12,713 --> 01:49:13,922
"Shows no remorse for his crime

1461
01:49:14,006 --> 01:49:16,759
because he denies the crime ever,
ever took place."

1462
01:49:16,925 --> 01:49:18,969
"Highly developed
and fantastical narratives,

1463
01:49:19,053 --> 01:49:21,472
which preclude facing the truth
of his actions."

1464
01:49:21,722 --> 01:49:24,099
I've had enough of this bullshit!
Where's-- where's my partner, huh?

1465
01:49:24,308 --> 01:49:25,642
Where's Chuck? Where is he?

1466
01:49:26,643 --> 01:49:28,062
Let's try this another way.

1467
01:49:28,395 --> 01:49:30,647
Your wife's maiden name was Chanal,
am I correct?

1468
01:49:30,856 --> 01:49:32,274
Don't you even talk about her.

1469
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:33,609
-Don't you--
-I'm afraid I have to.

1470
01:49:36,445 --> 01:49:38,489
{\an8}Notice anything these four names
have in common?

1471
01:49:38,947 --> 01:49:40,199
{\an8}It's your rule of four.

1472
01:49:40,824 --> 01:49:41,825
Andrew, what do you see?

1473
01:49:41,909 --> 01:49:44,828
If you've done anything to my partner,
Doctor, that is a violation of--

1474
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:46,997
Focus, Andrew! What do you see?

1475
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:50,793
The names have the same letters.

1476
01:49:52,086 --> 01:49:55,297
{\an8}Edward Daniels has exactly
the same 13 letters as Andrew Laeddis.

1477
01:49:55,506 --> 01:49:57,716
{\an8}The same as Rachel Solando
and Dolores Chanal.

1478
01:49:57,800 --> 01:49:59,551
{\an8}The names are anagrams
for each other.

1479
01:49:59,843 --> 01:50:01,178
Your tactics,

1480
01:50:01,512 --> 01:50:03,889
-they're-- they're not gonna work on me.
-You came here for the truth.

1481
01:50:04,264 --> 01:50:05,265
Here it is.

1482
01:50:05,432 --> 01:50:07,309
Your name is Andrew Laeddis.

1483
01:50:07,518 --> 01:50:10,521
The 67th patient at Ashecliffe
is you, Andrew.

1484
01:50:13,232 --> 01:50:14,608
-Bullshit.
-You were committed here

1485
01:50:14,691 --> 01:50:16,235
by court order 24 months ago.

1486
01:50:16,318 --> 01:50:19,613
Your crime is terrible,
one you can't forgive yourself for,

1487
01:50:19,696 --> 01:50:21,532
so you invented another self.

1488
01:50:24,243 --> 01:50:25,244
All right.

1489
01:50:26,745 --> 01:50:28,497
Let's-- let's get down to the facts,

1490
01:50:28,580 --> 01:50:30,457
-all right?
-You've created a story

1491
01:50:30,541 --> 01:50:31,750
in which you're not a murderer.

1492
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:33,794
You're a hero, still a U.S. Marshal,

1493
01:50:33,961 --> 01:50:35,879
only here at Ashecliffe
because of a case,

1494
01:50:36,004 --> 01:50:39,216
and you've uncovered a conspiracy
so that anything we tell you

1495
01:50:39,299 --> 01:50:40,926
about who you are, what you've done,

1496
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:43,220
you can dismiss as lies, Andrew.

1497
01:50:43,387 --> 01:50:44,888
My name is Edward Daniels.

1498
01:50:45,013 --> 01:50:48,642
I've been hearing this fantasy
for two years now. I know every detail.

1499
01:50:49,017 --> 01:50:50,894
Patient 67, the storm,

1500
01:50:51,061 --> 01:50:54,231
Rachel Solando, your missing partner,
the dreams you have every night.

1501
01:50:54,356 --> 01:50:56,817
You were at Dachau,
but you may not have killed any guards.

1502
01:50:58,569 --> 01:50:59,570
[sighs]

1503
01:51:00,821 --> 01:51:03,740
I wish I could let you just live
in your fantasy world.

1504
01:51:04,366 --> 01:51:05,367
I really do.

1505
01:51:07,077 --> 01:51:08,495
But you're violent, trained,

1506
01:51:08,745 --> 01:51:10,747
dangerous. You're the most dangerous
patient we have.

1507
01:51:11,582 --> 01:51:13,834
You've injured orderlies, guards,
other patients.

1508
01:51:13,959 --> 01:51:15,878
Two weeks ago,
you attacked George Noyce.

1509
01:51:16,003 --> 01:51:18,005
No, no. I am fucking on to you, Doctor.

1510
01:51:18,297 --> 01:51:20,132
-You had Noyce beaten.
-Of course I didn't!

1511
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:22,134
Give me one reason
why I would even touch him!

1512
01:51:22,384 --> 01:51:24,011
Because he called you Laeddis,

1513
01:51:24,845 --> 01:51:27,055
and you'd do anything not to be him.

1514
01:51:28,015 --> 01:51:31,560
I have a transcript of the conversation
you had with Noyce yesterday.

1515
01:51:31,685 --> 01:51:35,480
"This is about you, and Laeddis,
that's all it's ever been about."

1516
01:51:37,649 --> 01:51:40,235
No, no.
He's saying this is about me and Laeddis.

1517
01:51:40,319 --> 01:51:42,154
When you asked him
what happened to his face,

1518
01:51:42,237 --> 01:51:45,115
he said, now here I'm quoting again,
"You did this."

1519
01:51:45,699 --> 01:51:49,286
-No, no, he meant that it was my fault.
-You almost killed him.

1520
01:51:51,538 --> 01:51:54,333
The warden and the Board of Overseers
are determined something be done.

1521
01:51:54,416 --> 01:51:55,417
It's been decided,

1522
01:51:56,168 --> 01:52:00,047
that unless we can bring you back
to sanity now, right now,

1523
01:52:00,923 --> 01:52:04,259
permanent measures will be taken to ensure
you can't hurt anyone ever again.

1524
01:52:07,804 --> 01:52:09,223
They'll lobotomize you, Andrew.

1525
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:11,141
Do you understand?

1526
01:52:15,479 --> 01:52:16,563
Yeah, I understand.

1527
01:52:18,273 --> 01:52:19,650
I-- I understand just fine.

1528
01:52:21,068 --> 01:52:24,571
If I-- if I don't play along
with your little game here,

1529
01:52:25,113 --> 01:52:27,783
Dr. Naehring's gonna turn me
into one of his ghosts.

1530
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:29,993
But what about my partner?

1531
01:52:30,244 --> 01:52:32,162
You-- you're gonna tell
the U.S. Marshal's office

1532
01:52:32,329 --> 01:52:33,914
that he's a defense mechanism?

1533
01:52:36,583 --> 01:52:37,584
Hello, boss.

1534
01:52:54,977 --> 01:52:57,521
What-- what the fuck is going on here?

1535
01:52:59,106 --> 01:53:00,107
Huh?

1536
01:53:02,859 --> 01:53:04,194
You-- are you working for him?

1537
01:53:05,028 --> 01:53:06,613
I'm sorry. There wasn't any other way.

1538
01:53:06,738 --> 01:53:08,782
Someone had to stick with you,
keep you safe.

1539
01:53:12,494 --> 01:53:13,704
You been watching me, huh?

1540
01:53:15,539 --> 01:53:16,707
Watching me every minute.

1541
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:19,710
Who, who are you?

1542
01:53:20,544 --> 01:53:21,628
Who are you? Tell me.

1543
01:53:22,254 --> 01:53:23,922
Don't you recognize me, Andrew?

1544
01:53:25,716 --> 01:53:28,510
I've been your primary psychiatrist
for the last two years.

1545
01:53:30,012 --> 01:53:31,221
I'm Lester Sheehan.

1546
01:53:38,395 --> 01:53:40,022
I told you-- I told you about my wife,

1547
01:53:40,105 --> 01:53:41,106
-I--
-I know.

1548
01:53:41,189 --> 01:53:44,276
I climbed down a cliff to get you.
I-- I trusted you.

1549
01:53:44,359 --> 01:53:47,195
I-- I risked everything
to come in here after you.

1550
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:48,947
-Everything!
-I know, boss.

1551
01:53:49,281 --> 01:53:50,741
We're running out of time here, Andrew.

1552
01:53:52,367 --> 01:53:54,077
I swore before the Board of Overseers

1553
01:53:54,161 --> 01:53:58,707
that I could construct the most radical,
cutting-edge role-play ever attempted

1554
01:53:58,790 --> 01:54:00,375
in psychiatry,
and it would bring you back.

1555
01:54:00,459 --> 01:54:02,669
I thought that if we let you play
this out,

1556
01:54:03,545 --> 01:54:06,548
we could get you to see how untrue,
how impossible it is.

1557
01:54:08,216 --> 01:54:10,010
You've had the run of the place
for two days.

1558
01:54:10,802 --> 01:54:13,472
Tell me, where are the Nazi experiments?

1559
01:54:14,264 --> 01:54:15,557
The satanic ORs?

1560
01:54:29,613 --> 01:54:31,281
