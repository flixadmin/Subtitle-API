1
00:00:28,184 --> 00:00:31,587
<i>The Tesseract has awakened.</i>

2
00:00:33,038 --> 00:00:35,315
<i>It is on a little world,</i>

3
00:00:35,532 --> 00:00:37,713
<i>a human world.</i>

4
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:41,626
<i>They would wield its power,</i>

5
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:47,832
<i>but our ally knows its
workings as they never will.</i>

6
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:52,067
<i>He is ready to lead,</i>

7
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:54,564
<i>and our force,</i>

8
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:57,046
<i>our Chitauri,</i>

9
00:00:57,048 --> 00:00:58,395
<i>will follow.</i>

10
00:00:59,978 --> 00:01:02,081
<i>A world will be his.</i>

11
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:04,980
<i>The universe yours.</i>

12
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,234
<i>And the humans,</i>

13
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:09,057
<i>what can they do?</i>

14
00:01:09,616 --> 00:01:11,155
<i>But burn!</i>

15
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:29,340
<i>All personnel.
The evacuation order has been confirmed.</i>

16
00:01:29,526 --> 00:01:33,247
<i>Proceed your dedicated vehicle
for faster evacuation.</i>

17
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,390
<i>Is not a drill!</i>

18
00:01:35,815 --> 00:01:37,366
<i>Emergency personnel.</i>

19
00:01:37,368 --> 00:01:40,335
<i>Proceed your dedicated
vehicle for faster evacuation.</i>

20
00:02:01,386 --> 00:02:02,529
How bad is it?

21
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,376
That's the problem, sir.

22
00:02:04,534 --> 00:02:05,616
We don't know.

23
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,967
Dr. Selvig read an energy surge
from the Tesseract four hours ago.

24
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:14,971
NASA didn't authorize Selvig
to go to test phase.

25
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:17,164
He wasn't testing it.
He wasn't even in the room.

26
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:18,556
Spontaneous event.

27
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,941
It just turned itself on?

28
00:02:19,943 --> 00:02:21,207
Where are the energy levels now?

29
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:23,592
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down,
we ordered evac.

30
00:02:23,646 --> 00:02:24,806
How long to get everyone out?

31
00:02:24,808 --> 00:02:26,419
Campus should be clear
in the next half-hour.

32
00:02:26,585 --> 00:02:27,438
Do better.

33
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:30,937
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

34
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,399
We should tell them to go back to sleep?

35
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:34,864
If we can't control the Tesseract's energy,

36
00:02:34,914 --> 00:02:37,291
there may not be a minimum safe distance.

37
00:02:37,492 --> 00:02:40,370
I need you to make sure the Phase 2
prototypes are shipped out.

38
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:42,745
Sir, is that really a priority right now?

39
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,499
Until such time as the world ends,

40
00:02:44,501 --> 00:02:46,704
we will act as though it intends to spin on.

41
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:49,003
Clear out the tech below.

42
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,631
Every piece of Phase 2
on a truck and gone.

43
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:52,640
Yes, sir.

44
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,260
With me.

45
00:02:57,607 --> 00:02:58,812
Talk to me, Doctor.

46
00:03:00,438 --> 00:03:01,556
Director.

47
00:03:01,906 --> 00:03:03,626
Is there anything we know for certain?

48
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,701
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

49
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:08,787
Is that supposed to be funny?
No, it's not funny at all.

50
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:11,418
The Tesseract is not only active, she's...

51
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:12,876
behaving.

52
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:14,088
I assume you pulled the plug.

53
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,626
She's an energy source.

54
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:18,504
We turn off the power,
she turns it back on.

55
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,648
If she reaches peak level...

56
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,223
We prepared for this, Doctor.

57
00:03:22,441 --> 00:03:24,229
Harnessing energy from space.

58
00:03:24,316 --> 00:03:25,734
But we don't have the harness.

59
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,551
My calculations are far from complete.

60
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:29,828
And she's throwing off
interference, radiation.

61
00:03:30,118 --> 00:03:32,251
Nothing harmful,
low levels of gamma radiation.

62
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:34,674
That can be harmful.

63
00:03:35,016 --> 00:03:36,255
Where's Agent Barton?

64
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:37,869
The Hawk?

65
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:40,972
Up in his nest, as usual.

66
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:44,342
<i>Agent Barton, report.</i>

67
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:46,686
I gave you this detail

68
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:48,409
so you could keep
a close eye on things.

69
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:49,829
Well, I see better from a distance.

70
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:52,228
Have you seen anything
that might set this thing off?

71
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:54,287
Doctor, it's spiking again.

72
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,050
No one's come or gone.

73
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:57,783
And Selvig's clean.

74
00:03:58,306 --> 00:03:59,938
No contacts, no IMs.

75
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:03,278
If there was any tampering,
sir, it wasn't at this end.

76
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:05,912
At this end?

77
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:09,610
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway
to the other end of space, right?

78
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,296
Doors open from both sides.

79
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,256
Not yet.

80
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:26,452
Sir, please put down the spear.

81
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:07,008
You have heart.

82
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:38,806
Please don't.

83
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:41,987
I still need that.

84
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,821
This doesn't have to get any messier.

85
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,072
Of course it does.

86
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:47,116
I've come too far for anything else.

87
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:50,245
I am Loki,

88
00:06:51,004 --> 00:06:52,118
of Asgard.

89
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:55,166
And I am burdened
with glorious purpose.

90
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,322
Loki,

91
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:58,408
brother of Thor.

92
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,963
We have no quarrel with your people.

93
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:04,133
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

94
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:06,713
Are you planning to step on us?

95
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:09,160
I come with glad tidings,

96
00:07:11,286 --> 00:07:12,954
of a world made free.

97
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:14,602
Free from what?

98
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:15,711
Freedom.

99
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,957
Freedom is life's great lie.

100
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:21,118
Once you accept that,

101
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:22,991
in your heart,

102
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:29,075
you will know peace.

103
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:31,393
Yeah, you say peace,

104
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,205
I kind of think you mean the other thing.

105
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:36,345
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.

106
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,363
This place is about to blow,

107
00:07:38,682 --> 00:07:40,561
and drop a hundred feet of rock on us.

108
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:42,713
He means to bury us.

109
00:07:42,793 --> 00:07:44,088
Like the pharaohs of old.

110
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,413
He's right.
The portal is collapsing in on itself.

111
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,712
We've got maybe two minutes
before this goes critical.

112
00:07:49,097 --> 00:07:50,098
Well, then.

113
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:06,865
I need these vehicles.

114
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:11,805
Who's that?

115
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:13,215
They didn't tell me.

116
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,146
<i>Hill!</i>

117
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,119
Do you copy?

118
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:21,285
<i>Barton has turned.</i>

119
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:36,687
They have the Tesseract!
Shut them down!

120
00:09:13,437 --> 00:09:15,854
Let's go. No, no, no, leave it.
Leave it. Go!

121
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:34,200
We're clear upstairs, sir.
<i>You need to go.</i>

122
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:07,468
<i>Director?</i>

123
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:09,420
Director Fury, do you copy?

124
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,943
The Tesseract is with a hostile force.

125
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:13,332
I have men down.

126
00:11:13,576 --> 00:11:14,355
Hill?

127
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:16,383
A lot of men still under.

128
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:18,519
I don't know how many survivors.

129
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,306
<i>Sound a general call.</i>

130
00:11:20,316 --> 00:11:21,299
<i>I want every living soul</i>

131
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:23,265
not working rescue
looking for that briefcase.

132
00:11:23,484 --> 00:11:24,358
Roger that.

133
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,932
Coulson, get back to base.

134
00:11:26,257 --> 00:11:27,777
<i>This is a Level Seven.</i>

135
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,274
<i>As of right now,</i>

136
00:11:30,644 --> 00:11:32,200
we are at war.

137
00:11:34,048 --> 00:11:34,953
What do we do?

138
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,935
This is not how
I wanted this evening to go.

139
00:12:15,532 --> 00:12:17,455
I know how you wanted this evening to go.

140
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,990
Believe me this is better.

141
00:12:21,103 --> 00:12:22,813
Who are you working for?

142
00:12:23,332 --> 00:12:24,750
Lermentov, yes?

143
00:12:26,596 --> 00:12:28,097
Does he think,

144
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,334
we have to go through him,

145
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,336
to move our cargo?

146
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:38,234
I thought General Solohob
is in charge of the export business.

147
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:39,961
Solohob?

148
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,013
A bagman, a front.

149
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:49,645
Your outdated information betrays you.

150
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,816
The famous Black Widow,

151
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:59,822
and she turns out to be
simply another pretty face.

152
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,585
You really think I'm pretty?

153
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:08,676
Tell Lermentov we don't need him,

154
00:13:08,948 --> 00:13:12,260
to move the tanks.

155
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,985
Tell him he is out.

156
00:13:16,445 --> 00:13:17,613
Well...

157
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,803
you may have to write it down.

158
00:13:31,817 --> 00:13:32,886
It's for her.

159
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,181
You listen carefully.

160
00:13:38,183 --> 00:13:40,597
<i>You're at 1-14 Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor.</i>

161
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,236
<i>We have an F-22 exactly eight miles out.</i>

162
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:46,056
<i>Put the woman on the phone,
or I will blow up the block</i>

163
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,565
<i>before you can make the lobby.</i>

164
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:56,993
<i>We need you to come in.</i>
Are you kidding, I'm working.

165
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,255
<i>This takes precedence.</i>

166
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,257
I'm in the middle of an interrogation.

167
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:02,013
This moron is giving me everything.

168
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:05,054
I don't give everything.

169
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:07,972
Look, you can't pull me
out of this right now.

170
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:08,974
<i>Natasha...</i>

171
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:12,061
Barton's been compromised.

172
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:16,702
Let me put you on hold.

173
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,127
Where is Barton now?

174
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:01,798
<i>We don't know.</i>
But he's alive?

175
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:02,697
We think so.

176
00:15:02,995 --> 00:15:04,681
I'll brief you on everything
when you get back.

177
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,905
But first, we need you
to talk to the big guy.

178
00:15:07,162 --> 00:15:09,998
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me
about as far as he can throw me.

179
00:15:10,937 --> 00:15:12,052
I've got Stark.

180
00:15:12,605 --> 00:15:13,841
You get the big guy.

181
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:39,757
Who are you?

182
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,053
Get out!

183
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,944
There is sickness here!

184
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:44,852
You're a doctor.

185
00:15:44,854 --> 00:15:46,189
My father did not wake up!

186
00:15:46,766 --> 00:15:47,916
He has a fever

187
00:15:47,918 --> 00:15:49,899
and he's moaning
but his eyes won't open.

188
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,366
He has a big fever.

189
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,260
Slow down.

190
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:54,663
My father...

191
00:15:57,152 --> 00:15:58,153
Like them?

192
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:03,187
Please.

193
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,692
You should've got paid up front, Banner.

194
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:36,143
You know, for a man who's supposed
to be avoiding stress,

195
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:38,471
you picked a hell of a place to settle.

196
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,081
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

197
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:45,409
Then what is it?
Yoga?

198
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:48,854
You brought me to the edge of the city.

199
00:16:48,856 --> 00:16:49,674
Smart.

200
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,790
I assume the whole place is surrounded.

201
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:56,703
Just you and me.

202
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,876
And your actress buddy?

203
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,237
Is she a spy, too?
They start that young?

204
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:03,671
I did.

205
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:05,222
Who are you?

206
00:17:05,364 --> 00:17:06,493
Natasha Romanoff.

207
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,611
Are you here to kill me, Ms. Romanoff?

208
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,998
Because that's not going
to work out for everyone.

209
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:16,577
No, of course not.
I'm here on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.

210
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:19,740
S.H.I.E.L.D.

211
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:22,760
How did they find me?

212
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,545
We never lost you, Doctor.

213
00:17:24,547 --> 00:17:25,840
We've kept our distance.

214
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,766
Even helped keep some other
interested parties off your scent.

215
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:30,524
Why?

216
00:17:30,754 --> 00:17:32,673
Nick Fury seems to trust you.

217
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:34,721
But now we need you to come in.

218
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:37,118
What if I say no?

219
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:39,396
I'll persuade you.

220
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:43,511
And what if...

221
00:17:44,216 --> 00:17:45,821
the other guy says no?

222
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,127
You've been more than
a year without an incident.

223
00:17:49,129 --> 00:17:51,023
I don't think you want
to break that streak.

224
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:56,160
Well, I don't every time get what I want.

225
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,045
Doctor, we're facing a potential
global catastrophe.

226
00:18:01,606 --> 00:18:03,944
Well, those I actively try to avoid.

227
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:05,253
This...

228
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,682
is the Tesseract.

229
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:11,136
It has the potential energy
to wipe out the planet.

230
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,513
What does Fury want me
to do, swallow it?

231
00:18:16,952 --> 00:18:18,159
He wants you to find it.

232
00:18:18,716 --> 00:18:19,622
It's been taken.

233
00:18:20,254 --> 00:18:23,731
It emits a gamma signature
that's too weak for us to trace.

234
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:27,026
There's no one that knows
gamma radiation like you do.

235
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:28,719
If there was,

236
00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:30,509
that's where I'd be.

237
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,155
So, Fury isn't after the monster?

238
00:18:33,463 --> 00:18:34,756
Not that he's told me.

239
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:36,508
And he tells you everything?

240
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:39,494
Talk to Fury.
He needs you on this.

241
00:18:39,499 --> 00:18:40,667
He needs me in a cage?

242
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:41,707
No one's going to put you in a...

243
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:42,664
Stop lying to me!

244
00:18:46,855 --> 00:18:48,585
I'm sorry.
That was mean.

245
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:51,992
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

246
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:54,600
Why don't we...

247
00:18:55,512 --> 00:18:57,052
do this the easy way

248
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:58,347
where you don't use that

249
00:18:58,464 --> 00:19:02,146
and the other guy
doesn't make a mess.

250
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:03,798
Ok?

251
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:06,077
Natasha?

252
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:13,612
Stand down.

253
00:19:14,427 --> 00:19:15,612
<i>We're good here.</i>

254
00:19:17,845 --> 00:19:18,980
Just you and me.

255
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,891
<i>This is out of line, Director.</i>

256
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,583
<i>You're dealing with forces
you can't control.</i>

257
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,019
You ever been in a war, Councilman?

258
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,278
In a firefight?

259
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:33,335
Did you feel an overabundance of control?

260
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:37,344
<i>You're saying that this Asgard
is declaring war on our planet?</i>

261
00:19:37,346 --> 00:19:39,516
Not Asgard.
Loki.

262
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,482
<i>He can't be working alone.
What about the other one?</i>

263
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,185
<i>His brother.</i>

264
00:19:44,187 --> 00:19:46,372
<i>Our intelligence says
Thor is not a hostile.</i>

265
00:19:46,475 --> 00:19:47,542
But he's worlds away.

266
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,606
We can't depend on him to help, either.

267
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,691
It's up to us.

268
00:19:50,693 --> 00:19:53,362
<i>Which is why you should be
focusing on Phase 2.</i>

269
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,900
<i>It was designed for exactly this...</i>

270
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,731
Phase 2 isn't ready.

271
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:57,891
Our enemy is.

272
00:19:58,462 --> 00:20:00,047
We need a response team.

273
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:02,675
<i>The Avengers Initiative
was shut down.</i>

274
00:20:02,677 --> 00:20:04,512
This isn't about the Avengers.

275
00:20:04,514 --> 00:20:05,682
<i>We've seen the list.</i>

276
00:20:05,896 --> 00:20:08,288
<i>You're running the world's greatest
covert security network</i>

277
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,139
<i>and you're going to leave
the fate of the human race</i>

278
00:20:10,141 --> 00:20:11,434
<i>to a handful of freaks.</i>

279
00:20:11,487 --> 00:20:13,577
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.

280
00:20:13,622 --> 00:20:15,541
We need a response team.

281
00:20:16,153 --> 00:20:18,906
These people may be isolated,
unbalanced even,

282
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:20,702
but I believe with the right push

283
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:22,997
they can be exactly what we need.

284
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:24,545
<i>You believe?</i>

285
00:20:25,032 --> 00:20:28,368
<i>War isn't won by sentiment, Director.</i>

286
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:32,340
No, it's won by soldiers.

287
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:53,568
<i>There's not enough time.</i>

288
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,672
<i>I got to put her in the water!</i>

289
00:21:01,278 --> 00:21:02,363
<i>You won't be alone.</i>

290
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,014
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

291
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,973
<i>This guy is still alive!</i>

292
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:31,818
Trouble sleeping?

293
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,402
I slept for 70 years, sir.

294
00:21:35,508 --> 00:21:36,380
I think I've had my fill.

295
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,365
Then you should be out,

296
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:40,386
celebrating,

297
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,941
seeing the world.

298
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,158
When I went under,
the world was at war.

299
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:52,354
I wake up, they say we won.

300
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,731
They didn't say what we lost.

301
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:57,692
We've made some
mistakes along the way.

302
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,736
Some, very recently.

303
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:02,892
Are you here with a mission, sir?

304
00:22:02,894 --> 00:22:03,638
I am.

305
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,450
Trying to get me back in the world?

306
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:07,376
Trying to save it.

307
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:13,967
HYDRA'S secret weapon.

308
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:18,096
Howard Stark fished that out of
the ocean when he was looking for you.

309
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,230
He thought what we think.

310
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:24,386
The Tesseract could be the key
to unlimited sustainable energy.

311
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:27,721
That's something the world sorely needs.

312
00:22:30,385 --> 00:22:31,685
Who took it from you?

313
00:22:31,696 --> 00:22:33,055
He's called Loki.

314
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,603
He's not from around here.

315
00:22:36,504 --> 00:22:39,574
There's a lot we'll have to bring you up
to speed on if you're in.

316
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:44,335
The world has gotten even stranger
than you already know.

317
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:46,688
At this point, I doubt anything
would surprise me.

318
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:49,286
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

319
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:54,257
There's a debriefing packet waiting
for you back at your apartment.

320
00:22:57,377 --> 00:23:00,554
Is there anything you can tell us about
the Tesseract that we ought to know now?

321
00:23:01,068 --> 00:23:02,703
You should have left it in the ocean.

322
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,468
Good to go on this end.

323
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,745
The rest is up to you.

324
00:23:39,081 --> 00:23:40,639
<i>You disconnected
the transmission lines?</i>

325
00:23:40,641 --> 00:23:41,726
<i>Are we off the grid?</i>

326
00:23:41,728 --> 00:23:45,467
Stark Tower is about to become a beacon
of self-sustaining clean energy.

327
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:48,936
<i>Well, assuming the arc reactor takes
over and it actually works.</i>

328
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:50,271
I assume.

329
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:51,968
Light her up.

330
00:23:57,854 --> 00:23:58,855
<i>How does it look?</i>

331
00:23:58,857 --> 00:24:01,555
Like Christmas, but with more me.

332
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:03,485
<i>We've got to go wider on
the public awareness campaign.</i>

333
00:24:03,513 --> 00:24:04,675
<i>You need to do some press.</i>

334
00:24:05,206 --> 00:24:06,402
<i>I'm in DC tomorrow,</i>

335
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:07,987
<i>I'm working on the zoning
for the next three buildings.</i>

336
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:10,144
Pepper, you're killing me.
The moment, remember?

337
00:24:10,573 --> 00:24:11,653
Enjoy the moment.

338
00:24:11,794 --> 00:24:13,192
<i>Get in here and I will.</i>

339
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:19,561
<i>Sir, Agent Coulson of
S.H.I.E.L.D. is on the line.</i>

340
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:20,674
<i>I'm not in.</i>

341
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,627
I'm actually out.

342
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:32,226
<i>Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.</i>

343
00:24:32,923 --> 00:24:34,173
Grow aspine, Jarvis.

344
00:24:34,455 --> 00:24:35,238
I got a date.

345
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:41,768
Levels are holding steady,

346
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:43,423
I think.

347
00:24:43,425 --> 00:24:45,742
Of course they are.
I was directly involved.

348
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,092
Which brings me to my next question.

349
00:24:47,094 --> 00:24:49,038
How does it feel to be a genius?

350
00:24:49,172 --> 00:24:51,658
Well, I really wouldn't know, now would I?

351
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,384
What do you mean? All this...

352
00:24:54,504 --> 00:24:55,794
came from you.

353
00:24:56,303 --> 00:24:59,014
No all this, came from that.

354
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:01,511
Give yourself some credit.

355
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:02,441
Please.

356
00:25:02,642 --> 00:25:04,648
Stark Tower is your baby.

357
00:25:04,675 --> 00:25:06,970
Give yourself 12% of the credit.

358
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:08,802
12%?

359
00:25:08,804 --> 00:25:10,044
An argument can be made for 15.

360
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:12,203
12% for my baby?
Well I...

361
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:13,761
did do all the heavy lifting.

362
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:15,665
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.

363
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:18,035
And sorry, but the security snafu?

364
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:19,369
That was on you.

365
00:25:19,814 --> 00:25:21,774
My private elevator...
You mean our elevator?

366
00:25:21,776 --> 00:25:23,997
It was teeming with sweaty workmen.

367
00:25:24,884 --> 00:25:27,555
I'm going to pay for that
comment about percentages

368
00:25:27,557 --> 00:25:29,351
in some subtle way later, aren't I?

369
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,309
It's not going to be that subtle.

370
00:25:31,385 --> 00:25:32,349
I'll tell you what.

371
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:35,201
The next building is gonna say
Potts on the tower.

372
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:36,565
On the lease.

373
00:25:37,771 --> 00:25:39,288
Call your mom can you bunk over?

374
00:25:40,143 --> 00:25:41,436
<i>Sir, the telephone.</i>

375
00:25:41,556 --> 00:25:44,017
<i>I'm afraid my protocols
are being overridden.</i>

376
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:45,515
<i>Mr. Stark, we need to talk.</i>

377
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:49,047
You have reached the life
model decoy of Tony Stark.

378
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,067
Please leave a message.
<i>This is urgent.</i>

379
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,738
Then leave it urgently.

380
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:55,805
Security breach.
It's on you.

381
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:56,608
Mr. Stark.

382
00:25:56,785 --> 00:25:58,547
Phil! Come in.

383
00:25:58,683 --> 00:25:59,479
Phil?

384
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:00,648
I can't stay.

385
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:02,437
His first name is Agent.

386
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:04,189
Come on in.
We're celebrating.

387
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:05,616
Which is why he can't stay.

388
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,618
We need you to look this over
as soon as possible.

389
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,732
I don't like being handed things.

390
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,214
That's fine, because I love
to be handed things.

391
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:12,697
So, let's trade.

392
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,384
Thank you.

393
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:20,121
Official consulting hours are between
8 and 5 every other Thursday.

394
00:26:20,123 --> 00:26:21,385
This isn't a consultation.

395
00:26:21,387 --> 00:26:22,687
Is this about the Avengers?

396
00:26:23,163 --> 00:26:24,862
Which I know nothing about.

397
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:27,143
The Avengers Initiative was scrapped,

398
00:26:27,568 --> 00:26:29,297
I thought and I didn't even qualify.

399
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:30,608
I didn't know that either.

400
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,328
Yeah apparently I'm volatile,

401
00:26:32,742 --> 00:26:33,759
self-obsessed,

402
00:26:33,984 --> 00:26:35,176
don't play well with others.

403
00:26:35,413 --> 00:26:36,291
That I did know.

404
00:26:36,293 --> 00:26:38,114
This isn't about personality
profiles anymore.

405
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:40,565
Whatever, Ms. Potts, got a second?

406
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:41,851
Half a moment.

407
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:49,575
You know, I thought we were
having a moment.

408
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:51,389
I was having 12% of a moment.

409
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:55,148
This seems serious.
Phil's pretty shaken.

410
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,124
How would you know if it's...
Why is he Phil?

411
00:26:57,126 --> 00:26:58,520
What is all this?

412
00:26:59,181 --> 00:26:59,962
This is...

413
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:02,455
This.

414
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:11,671
I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.

415
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:12,418
Tomorrow.

416
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,050
You have homework.
You have a lot of homework.

417
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,461
Well, what if I didn't?

418
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:18,763
If you didn't?
Yeah.

419
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,341
You mean when you've finished?

420
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:23,225
Well...

421
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:25,416
Then...

422
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:31,811
Square deal. Fly safe.

423
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:37,365
Work hard.

424
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:42,109
So, any chance
you're driving by LaGuardia?

425
00:27:42,111 --> 00:27:44,205
I can drop you.
Fantastic.

426
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,917
I want to hear about the cellist.
Is that still a thing?

427
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,261
She moved back to Portland.

428
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:50,419
What?

429
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:02,512
We're about 40 minutes
out from home base, sir.

430
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:10,106
So, this Dr. Banner was trying
to replicate the serum they used on me?

431
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:11,661
A lot of people were.

432
00:28:12,217 --> 00:28:13,797
You were the world's first superhero.

433
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:18,648
Banner thought gamma radiation might hold
the key to unlocking Erskine's original formula.

434
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:21,364
Didn't really go his way, did it?

435
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:22,524
Not so much.

436
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:26,010
When he's not that thing, though,
the guy's like a Stephen Hawking.

437
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,460
He's like a smart person.

438
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,791
I got to say...

439
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,404
it's an honor to meet you,

440
00:28:35,764 --> 00:28:36,996
officially.

441
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,941
I've sort of met you, I mean,

442
00:28:39,101 --> 00:28:40,756
I watched you while
you were sleeping.

443
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:45,215
I mean, I was, I was present,

444
00:28:45,318 --> 00:28:46,963
while you were unconscious,

445
00:28:47,413 --> 00:28:48,543
from the ice.

446
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:49,896
You know, it's really just a,

447
00:28:49,898 --> 00:28:52,005
just a huge honor
to have you on board.

448
00:28:52,007 --> 00:28:52,628
This...

449
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:55,143
I hope I'm the man for the job.

450
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:56,496
Oh, you are.

451
00:28:56,796 --> 00:28:57,852
Absolutely.

452
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:00,839
We made some modifications
to the uniform.

453
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,326
I had a little design input.

454
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:04,443
The uniform?

455
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:06,518
Aren't the stars and stripes a little...

456
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:09,544
old-fashioned?

457
00:29:10,698 --> 00:29:11,995
With everything that's happening...

458
00:29:13,181 --> 00:29:14,753
and the things that are about
to come to light,

459
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:16,708
people might just...

460
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,571
need a little old-fashioned.

461
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:54,711
The Chitauri grow restless.

462
00:29:54,713 --> 00:29:56,052
Let them gird themselves.

463
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:58,381
I will lead them in the glorious battle.

464
00:29:58,464 --> 00:29:59,549
Battle?

465
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:03,803
Against the meager might of Earth?

466
00:30:03,883 --> 00:30:06,167
Glorious, not lengthy.

467
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:10,599
If your force is
as formidable as you claim.

468
00:30:10,973 --> 00:30:12,599
You question us?

469
00:30:13,651 --> 00:30:15,188
You question him,

470
00:30:15,805 --> 00:30:18,039
he who put the scepter in your hand?

471
00:30:18,473 --> 00:30:21,482
Who gave you ancient knowledge
and new purpose

472
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:24,877
when you were cast out, defeated?

473
00:30:24,879 --> 00:30:25,972
I was a king!

474
00:30:26,883 --> 00:30:28,303
The rightful king of Asgard,

475
00:30:29,538 --> 00:30:30,437
betrayed.

476
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:33,804
Your ambition is little,

477
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:36,360
and born of childish need.

478
00:30:37,092 --> 00:30:42,713
We look beyond the Earth to the greater
worlds the Tesseract will unveil.

479
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,216
You don't have the Tesseract yet.

480
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:47,905
I don't threaten.

481
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:51,585
But until I open the doors,

482
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:55,125
until your force is mine to command,

483
00:30:56,731 --> 00:30:57,963
you are but words.

484
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:02,123
You will have your war, Asgardian.

485
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:06,011
If you fail,

486
00:31:07,492 --> 00:31:11,040
if the Tesseract is kept from us,

487
00:31:12,033 --> 00:31:13,635
there will be no realm,

488
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,983
no barren moon,

489
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:19,465
no crevice where he cannot find you.

490
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:24,086
You think you know pain?

491
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:26,242
He will make you long,

492
00:31:26,855 --> 00:31:29,932
for something sweet as pain.

493
00:31:59,377 --> 00:32:00,845
Stow the captain's gear.
Yes, sir.

494
00:32:03,018 --> 00:32:03,982
Agent Romanoff,

495
00:32:04,648 --> 00:32:05,866
Captain Rogers.

496
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:07,721
Ma'am.
Hi.

497
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:10,246
They need you on the bridge.
They're starting the face-trace.

498
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:11,748
See you there.

499
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:16,860
It was quite the buzz around here,
finding you in the ice.

500
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:19,906
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.

501
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:23,693
Did he ask you to sign
his Captain America trading cards yet?

502
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,841
Trading cards?

503
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:27,280
They're vintage.
He's very proud.

504
00:32:29,026 --> 00:32:30,361
Dr. Banner.

505
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:33,536
Yeah, hi.

506
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:35,357
They told me you would be coming.

507
00:32:35,471 --> 00:32:36,906
Word is, you can find the Cube.

508
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:39,749
Is that the only word on me?

509
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:41,452
Only word I care about.

510
00:32:44,051 --> 00:32:46,387
It must be strange for you, all of this.

511
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:49,769
Well, this is actually kind of familiar.

512
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:52,526
Gentlemen, you might want
to step inside in a minute.

513
00:32:53,034 --> 00:32:54,940
It's going to get a little hard to breathe.

514
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:58,491
<i>Flight crew, secure the deck.</i>

515
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:04,775
Is this a submarine?

516
00:33:05,318 --> 00:33:06,319
Really?

517
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:09,509
They want me in a submerged,
pressurized, metal container?

518
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:38,443
No, no, this is much worse.

519
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:11,509
Hover power check complete.
Position cyclic.

520
00:34:11,676 --> 00:34:13,605
Increase collective to 8%.

521
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:21,319
Preparing for maximum
performance takeoff.

522
00:34:21,386 --> 00:34:22,951
Increase output to capacity.

523
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,229
Power plant performing at capacity.

524
00:34:25,494 --> 00:34:27,049
We are clear.

525
00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:28,654
All engines operating.

526
00:34:28,857 --> 00:34:33,056
S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency
Protocol 193.6 in effect.

527
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:34,861
We are at level, sir.

528
00:34:35,097 --> 00:34:35,849
Good.

529
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:37,827
Let's vanish.

530
00:34:37,994 --> 00:34:40,095
Engage retro-reflection panels.

531
00:34:56,012 --> 00:34:57,532
Reflection panels engaged.

532
00:34:57,792 --> 00:34:58,948
Gentlemen.

533
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,828
Doctor, thank you for coming.

534
00:35:14,676 --> 00:35:16,353
Thanks for asking nicely.

535
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:19,368
So, how long am I staying?

536
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:21,406
Once we get our hands
on the Tesseract,

537
00:35:21,509 --> 00:35:22,554
you're in the wind.

538
00:35:22,747 --> 00:35:23,927
Where are you with that?

539
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,920
We're sweeping every wirelessly
accessible camera on the planet.

540
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:30,212
Cell phones, laptops.

541
00:35:30,801 --> 00:35:32,372
If it's connected to a satellite,

542
00:35:32,374 --> 00:35:33,646
it's eyes and ears for us.

543
00:35:33,988 --> 00:35:35,433
That's still not gonna find them in time.

544
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:36,594
You have to narrow your field.

545
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,763
How many spectrometers
do you have access to?

546
00:35:39,133 --> 00:35:40,890
How many are there?
Call every lab you know.

547
00:35:40,892 --> 00:35:44,183
Tell them to put the spectrometers on
the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays.

548
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:47,629
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm,
basic cluster recognition.

549
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:49,862
At least we could rule out a few places.

550
00:35:50,636 --> 00:35:51,871
Do you have somewhere
for me to work?

551
00:35:52,589 --> 00:35:53,712
Agent Romanoff,

552
00:35:53,714 --> 00:35:55,843
could you show Dr. Banner
to his laboratory, please?

553
00:35:57,323 --> 00:35:59,492
You're gonna love it, Doc.
We got all the toys.

554
00:36:00,187 --> 00:36:01,381
Put it over there.

555
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:05,974
Where did you find all these people?

556
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:08,873
S.H.I.E.L.D. has no shortage
of enemies, Doctor.

557
00:36:09,752 --> 00:36:10,920
Is this the stuff you need?

558
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:12,088
Yeah, iridium.

559
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:14,840
It's found in meteorites.
It forms anti-protons.

560
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,393
It's very hard to get hold of.

561
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,602
Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D.
knows you need it.

562
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:19,811
Well, I didn't know.

563
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,048
Hey!

564
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:23,724
The Tesseract has shown me
so much it's...

565
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,185
more than knowledge, it's truth.

566
00:36:26,492 --> 00:36:27,388
I know.

567
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,806
What did it show you, Agent Barton?

568
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:32,198
My next target.

569
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:33,646
Tell me what you need.

570
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:38,312
I need a distraction.

571
00:36:39,824 --> 00:36:40,915
And an eyeball.

572
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:50,543
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

573
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:51,862
No, no. It's fine.

574
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:56,188
It's a vintage set.

575
00:36:56,799 --> 00:36:58,767
It took me a couple of years
to collect them all.

576
00:37:01,637 --> 00:37:02,722
Near mint.

577
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,490
Slight foxing around the edges, but...

578
00:37:04,551 --> 00:37:06,970
We got a hit, a 67% match.

579
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:09,313
Wait.
Cross match, 79%.

580
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:11,313
Location?

581
00:37:11,427 --> 00:37:14,263
Stuttgart, Germany.
28 Königstrasse.

582
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:15,818
He's not exactly hiding.

583
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:16,901
Captain,

584
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:18,653
you're up.

585
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:55,269
Kneel before me.

586
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,025
I said,

587
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:04,987
Kneel

588
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:17,187
Is not this simpler?

589
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,974
Is this not your natural state?

590
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:27,576
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,

591
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:30,804
that you crave subjugation.

592
00:40:31,347 --> 00:40:33,353
The bright lure of freedom,

593
00:40:33,355 --> 00:40:37,879
diminishes your life's joy
in a mad scramble for power,

594
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,019
for identity.

595
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:44,337
You were made...

596
00:40:44,745 --> 00:40:46,196
to be ruled.

597
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:47,748
In the end,

598
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:50,173
you will always kneel.

599
00:40:58,332 --> 00:40:59,924
Not to men like you.

600
00:41:01,335 --> 00:41:03,003
There are no men like me.

601
00:41:04,088 --> 00:41:06,562
There are always men like you.

602
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:09,818
Look to your elder, people.

603
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:13,802
Let him be an example.

604
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:22,922
You know, the last time
I was in Germany,

605
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:25,983
and saw a man standing
above everybody else,

606
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:28,237
we ended up disagreeing.

607
00:41:28,404 --> 00:41:29,547
The soldier.

608
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:33,646
The man out of time.

609
00:41:34,252 --> 00:41:35,613
I'm not the one who's out of time.

610
00:41:38,956 --> 00:41:41,650
<i>Loki, drop the weapon
and stand down.</i>

611
00:42:01,778 --> 00:42:02,972
Kneel.

612
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:04,700
Not today!

613
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:08,373
The guy's all over the place.

614
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:14,015
<i>Agent Romanoff.
You miss me?</i>

615
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:32,729
<i>Make your move,
Reindeer Games.</i>

616
00:42:40,981 --> 00:42:41,982
<i>Good move.</i>

617
00:42:43,896 --> 00:42:45,015
Mr. Stark.

618
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:46,991
<i>Captain.</i>

619
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:55,615
<i>Is he saying anything?</i>

620
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,201
Not a word.

621
00:42:57,743 --> 00:42:59,633
<i>Just get him here.
We're low on time.</i>

622
00:43:02,682 --> 00:43:03,883
I don't like it.

623
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:06,101
What, Rock of Ages
giving up so easily?

624
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:07,836
I don't remember it being that easy.

625
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:09,453
This guy packs a wallop.

626
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:12,803
Still, you are pretty spry
for an older fellow.

627
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:15,656
What's your thing, Pilates?

628
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:17,012
What?

629
00:43:17,221 --> 00:43:18,263
It's like calisthenics.

630
00:43:18,347 --> 00:43:20,349
You might have missed
a couple of things, you know.

631
00:43:20,713 --> 00:43:22,217
Doing time as a Capsicle.

632
00:43:24,228 --> 00:43:25,868
Fury didn't tell me
he was calling you in.

633
00:43:25,966 --> 00:43:28,377
Yeah, there is a lot of things Fury
doesn't tell you.

634
00:43:28,816 --> 00:43:30,434
Where's this coming from?

635
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:35,979
What's the matter?

636
00:43:36,004 --> 00:43:37,306
Are you scared of a little lightning?

637
00:43:37,737 --> 00:43:40,073
I'm not overly fond of what follows.

638
00:43:57,845 --> 00:43:59,054
What are you doing?

639
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:13,560
<i>And now there is that guy.</i>

640
00:44:13,655 --> 00:44:15,048
Another Asgardian?

641
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:17,699
That guy's a friendly?
<i>Doesn't matter.</i>

642
00:44:17,745 --> 00:44:20,372
<i>If he frees Loki or kills him,
the Tesseract's lost.</i>

643
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:22,415
Stark, we need a plan of attack!

644
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:24,830
<i>I have a plan. Attack.</i>

645
00:44:30,961 --> 00:44:32,405
I'd sit this one out, Cap.

646
00:44:32,963 --> 00:44:34,006
I don't see how I can.

647
00:44:34,103 --> 00:44:36,675
These guys come from legend.
They're basically gods.

648
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:38,594
There's only one God, ma'am.

649
00:44:38,789 --> 00:44:40,743
And I'm pretty sure
he doesn't dress like that.

650
00:44:56,528 --> 00:44:57,779
Where is the Tesseract?

651
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,628
I missed you, too.

652
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,356
Do I look to be in a gaming mood?

653
00:45:01,742 --> 00:45:03,205
You should thank me.

654
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:06,120
With the Bifrost gone,
how much dark energy

655
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:08,754
did the Allfather have
to muster to conjure you here,

656
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:10,373
to your precious Earth?

657
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:15,714
I thought you dead.

658
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:18,459
Did you mourn?

659
00:45:19,343 --> 00:45:20,386
We all did.

660
00:45:20,661 --> 00:45:21,543
Our father...

661
00:45:21,545 --> 00:45:23,730
Your father.

662
00:45:26,308 --> 00:45:28,586
He did tell you my true parentage,
did he not?

663
00:45:31,688 --> 00:45:33,469
We were raised together.

664
00:45:34,149 --> 00:45:36,718
We played together,
we fought together.

665
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:38,589
Do you remember none of that?

666
00:45:38,695 --> 00:45:40,197
I remember a shadow.

667
00:45:42,141 --> 00:45:44,735
Living in the shade of your greatness.

668
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:48,643
I remember you tossing me
into an abyss.

669
00:45:48,664 --> 00:45:50,839
I was and should be king!

670
00:45:50,841 --> 00:45:53,144
So you take the world
I love as a recompense

671
00:45:53,193 --> 00:45:54,711
for your imagined slights?

672
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:55,835
No.

673
00:45:55,978 --> 00:45:58,122
The Earth is under my protection, Loki.

674
00:45:59,675 --> 00:46:02,970
And you're doing
a marvelous job with that.

675
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:07,360
The humans slaughter each other
in droves while you idly fret.

676
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:10,101
I mean to rule them,
as why should I not?

677
00:46:10,102 --> 00:46:11,682
You think yourself above them?

678
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:13,772
Well, yes.

679
00:46:13,774 --> 00:46:16,276
Then you miss the truth
of ruling, brother.

680
00:46:17,317 --> 00:46:18,910
A throne would suit you ill.

681
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:26,266
I've seen worlds
you've never known about!

682
00:46:26,702 --> 00:46:27,838
I have grown,

683
00:46:28,056 --> 00:46:30,747
Odinson, in my exile.

684
00:46:31,373 --> 00:46:33,640
I have seen the true power
of the Tesseract,

685
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:34,705
and when I Wield it...

686
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,123
Who showed you this power?

687
00:46:37,629 --> 00:46:39,047
Who controls the would-be king?

688
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,829
I am a king!
Not here!

689
00:46:41,216 --> 00:46:42,414
You give up the Tesseract!

690
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:44,213
You give up this poisonous dream!

691
00:46:48,017 --> 00:46:49,057
Come home.

692
00:46:54,081 --> 00:46:55,249
I don't have it.

693
00:46:57,457 --> 00:46:59,424
You need the Cube to bring me home.

694
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:01,319
But I've sent it off, I know not where.

695
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:04,232
Listen well brother.

696
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:07,534
I'm listening.

697
00:47:16,918 --> 00:47:18,378
Do not touch me again.

698
00:47:18,747 --> 00:47:20,172
Then don't take my stuff.

699
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,891
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

700
00:47:24,468 --> 00:47:25,769
Shakespeare in the Park?

701
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:28,367
Doth Mother know,

702
00:47:28,418 --> 00:47:30,067
you weareth her drapes?

703
00:47:30,474 --> 00:47:32,793
This is beyond you, metal man.

704
00:47:33,435 --> 00:47:35,728
Loki will face Asgardian justice.

705
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:37,481
He gives up the Cube,
he's all yours.

706
00:47:37,842 --> 00:47:38,612
Until then,

707
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:40,525
<i>stay out of the way.</i>

708
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:43,312
Tourist.

709
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:50,202
Ok.

710
00:48:20,148 --> 00:48:22,690
<i>Power at 400% capacity.</i>

711
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:24,338
How about that?

712
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:25,555
Hey!

713
00:49:28,884 --> 00:49:29,913
That's enough.

714
00:49:33,847 --> 00:49:35,515
Now, I don't know
what you plan on doing here.

715
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,143
I've come here to put an end
to Loki's schemes.

716
00:49:38,226 --> 00:49:39,222
Then prove it.

717
00:49:39,774 --> 00:49:40,873
Put that hammer down.

718
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:41,971
Yeah. No.

719
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:43,482
<i>Bad call. He loves his...</i>

720
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,117
You want me to put the hammer down?

721
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:16,009
Are we done, here?

722
00:51:04,521 --> 00:51:06,343
In case it's unclear,

723
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:09,643
if you try to escape,

724
00:51:11,111 --> 00:51:13,196
if you so much as scratch that glass,

725
00:51:22,998 --> 00:51:26,910
it's 30,000 feet straight down
in a steel trap.

726
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:28,891
You get how that works?

727
00:51:31,673 --> 00:51:33,942
Ant, boot.

728
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:39,180
It's an impressive cage.

729
00:51:40,174 --> 00:51:42,047
Not built, I think, for me.

730
00:51:43,268 --> 00:51:45,686
Built for something
a lot stronger than you.

731
00:51:45,793 --> 00:51:47,012
Oh, I've heard.

732
00:51:48,671 --> 00:51:50,019
<i>A mindless beast.</i>

733
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:52,660
<i>Makes play he's still a man.</i>

734
00:51:53,695 --> 00:51:55,686
<i>How desperate are you,</i>

735
00:51:56,114 --> 00:51:59,084
<i>that you call on such
lost creatures to defend you?</i>

736
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:01,189
<i>How desperate am I?</i>

737
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:03,830
You threaten my world with war.

738
00:52:03,997 --> 00:52:06,166
You steal a force
you can't hope to control.

739
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:09,494
You talk about peace,
and you kill because it's fun.

740
00:52:10,337 --> 00:52:12,985
You have made me very desperate.

741
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:15,300
You might not be glad that you did.

742
00:52:18,853 --> 00:52:21,300
It burns you to have come so close.

743
00:52:23,433 --> 00:52:24,724
To have the Tesseract,

744
00:52:24,904 --> 00:52:25,972
to have power,

745
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:28,498
unlimited power.

746
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:30,438
And for what?

747
00:52:32,984 --> 00:52:35,459
<i>A warm light for all mankind to share.</i>

748
00:52:37,072 --> 00:52:39,941
And then to be reminded
what real power is.

749
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:48,449
Well, let me know if real power
wants a magazine or something.

750
00:52:56,966 --> 00:52:58,468
He really grows on you, doesn't he?

751
00:52:58,677 --> 00:53:00,199
Loki's gonna drag this out.

752
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:01,644
So...

753
00:53:02,586 --> 00:53:04,076
Thor, what's his play?

754
00:53:04,432 --> 00:53:06,611
He has an army called the Chitauri.

755
00:53:07,227 --> 00:53:09,371
They're not of Asgard,
nor any world known.

756
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:12,445
He means to lead them
against your people.

757
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:14,222
They will win him the Earth,

758
00:53:14,756 --> 00:53:16,403
in return I suspect for the Tesseract.

759
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:17,339
An army?

760
00:53:18,488 --> 00:53:19,772
From outer space.

761
00:53:20,407 --> 00:53:21,926
So, he's building another portal.

762
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:24,868
That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.

763
00:53:24,874 --> 00:53:25,492
Selvig?

764
00:53:25,836 --> 00:53:26,998
He's an astrophysicist.

765
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,008
He's a friend.

766
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:30,256
Loki has him under some kind of spell,

767
00:53:31,158 --> 00:53:32,158
along with one of ours.

768
00:53:32,168 --> 00:53:33,837
I want to know why Loki let us take him.

769
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,520
He's not leading an army from here.

770
00:53:35,522 --> 00:53:36,995
I don't think we should be
focusing on Loki.

771
00:53:37,298 --> 00:53:39,175
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.

772
00:53:39,259 --> 00:53:40,759
You could smell crazy on him.

773
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,429
Have care how you speak.

774
00:53:43,054 --> 00:53:45,223
Loki is beyond reason,
but he is of Asgard.

775
00:53:45,558 --> 00:53:46,784
And he is my brother.

776
00:53:46,945 --> 00:53:48,839
He killed 80 people in two days.

777
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:50,645
He's adopted.

778
00:53:50,854 --> 00:53:52,523
I think it's about the mechanics.

779
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:55,482
Iridium. What do they need
the iridium for?

780
00:53:55,483 --> 00:53:56,484
It's a stabilizing agent.

781
00:53:56,693 --> 00:53:58,027
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.

782
00:53:58,029 --> 00:53:59,276
I'll fly you to Portland.

783
00:53:59,706 --> 00:54:00,703
Keep love alive.

784
00:54:01,656 --> 00:54:03,575
It means the portal
won't collapse on itself

785
00:54:03,577 --> 00:54:04,696
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

786
00:54:05,744 --> 00:54:07,288
No hard feelings, Point Break.

787
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:08,466
You've got a mean swing.

788
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:11,551
Also, it means the portal
can open as wide

789
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:13,869
and stay open as long,
as Loki wants.

790
00:54:15,178 --> 00:54:17,252
Raise the mizzenmast.
Jib the topsails.

791
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:19,989
That man is playing Galaga.

792
00:54:21,009 --> 00:54:22,151
He thought we wouldn't notice,

793
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:23,870
but we did.

794
00:54:26,258 --> 00:54:27,634
How does Fury even see these?

795
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:28,851
He turns.

796
00:54:29,184 --> 00:54:30,292
Sounds exhausting.

797
00:54:31,853 --> 00:54:33,269
The rest of the raw materials,

798
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:35,594
Agent Barton can get his hands
on pretty easily.

799
00:54:36,232 --> 00:54:39,105
The only major component
he still needs is a power source,

800
00:54:39,602 --> 00:54:41,233
of high-energy density.

801
00:54:41,529 --> 00:54:42,374
Something...

802
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:44,589
to kick-start the Cube.

803
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:47,721
When did you become an expert
in thermonuclear astrophysics?

804
00:54:48,171 --> 00:54:48,979
Last night.

805
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:51,296
The packet, Selvig's notes,

806
00:54:51,446 --> 00:54:52,855
the extraction theory papers.

807
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:54,333
Am I the only one who did the reading?

808
00:54:54,342 --> 00:54:56,347
Does Loki need any particular
kind of power source?

809
00:54:57,253 --> 00:55:00,122
He would have to heat the Cube
to 120-million Kelvin

810
00:55:00,184 --> 00:55:01,824
just to break through
the Coulomb barrier.

811
00:55:01,826 --> 00:55:04,330
Unless Selvig has figured out
how to stabilize

812
00:55:04,332 --> 00:55:05,581
the quantum tunneling effect.

813
00:55:05,595 --> 00:55:06,543
Well, if he could do that,

814
00:55:06,545 --> 00:55:09,368
he could achieve heavy ion fusion
at any reactor on the planet.

815
00:55:09,432 --> 00:55:11,493
Finally, someone who speaks English.

816
00:55:12,005 --> 00:55:13,550
Is that what just happened?

817
00:55:14,229 --> 00:55:15,728
It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.

818
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:19,483
Your work on anti electron
collisions is unparalleled.

819
00:55:19,656 --> 00:55:21,734
And I'm a huge fan of the way
you lose control

820
00:55:21,736 --> 00:55:23,613
and turn into an enormous
green rage-monster.

821
00:55:25,323 --> 00:55:25,932
Thanks.

822
00:55:25,934 --> 00:55:28,867
Dr. Banner is only here
to track the Cube.

823
00:55:29,244 --> 00:55:30,578
I was hoping you might join him.

824
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:31,938
I would start with that stick of his.

825
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,623
It may be magical but it works
an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.

826
00:55:34,701 --> 00:55:37,653
I don't know about that,
but it is powered by the Cube.

827
00:55:37,961 --> 00:55:39,997
And I would like to know
how Loki used it

828
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,671
to turn two of the sharpest men I know

829
00:55:41,673 --> 00:55:43,524
into his personal flying monkeys.

830
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,712
Monkeys?

831
00:55:45,184 --> 00:55:46,386
I do not understand.
I do.

832
00:55:49,472 --> 00:55:51,099
I understood that reference.

833
00:55:52,267 --> 00:55:53,378
Shall we play, Doctor?

834
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:54,837
This way, sir.

835
00:56:09,564 --> 00:56:11,284
The gamma readings
are definitely consistent

836
00:56:11,286 --> 00:56:13,079
with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.

837
00:56:13,538 --> 00:56:15,373
But it's going
to take weeks to process.

838
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,912
If we bypass their mainframe

839
00:56:16,914 --> 00:56:18,332
and direct route to the Homer cluster,

840
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:21,143
we can clock this
at around 600 teraflops.

841
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:24,395
All I packed was a toothbrush.

842
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:27,402
You know, you should come by
Stark Tower sometime.

843
00:56:27,436 --> 00:56:29,673
Top ten floors, all R&D.

844
00:56:29,764 --> 00:56:31,266
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

845
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:34,058
Thanks, but the last time
I was in New York I...

846
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:35,300
kind of broke...

847
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:36,812
Harlem.

848
00:56:36,978 --> 00:56:38,813
Well, I promise
a stress-free environment.

849
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,815
No tension, no surprises.

850
00:56:42,317 --> 00:56:43,858
Hey!
Nothing?

851
00:56:43,941 --> 00:56:44,984
Are you nuts?

852
00:56:44,986 --> 00:56:45,987
Jury's out.

853
00:56:46,195 --> 00:56:47,697
You really have got a lid on it,
haven't you?

854
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:48,866
What's your secret?
Mellow jazz?

855
00:56:48,868 --> 00:56:50,177
Bongo drums, huge bag of weed?

856
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:51,520
Is everything a joke to you?

857
00:56:51,618 --> 00:56:52,619
Funny things are.

858
00:56:52,717 --> 00:56:55,443
Threatening the safety of everyone
on this ship isn't funny.

859
00:56:55,984 --> 00:56:57,714
No offense, Doc.
It's alright,

860
00:56:57,716 --> 00:56:59,661
I wouldn't have come aboard
if I couldn't handle...

861
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:00,964
pointy things.

862
00:57:01,794 --> 00:57:03,092
You're tip-toeing, big man.

863
00:57:03,506 --> 00:57:04,501
You need to strut.

864
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:06,215
And you need to focus
on the problem, Mr. Stark.

865
00:57:06,236 --> 00:57:07,045
Do you think I'm not?

866
00:57:07,926 --> 00:57:10,517
Why did Fury call us in?
Why now? Why not before?

867
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:12,046
What isn't he telling us?

868
00:57:12,715 --> 00:57:14,583
I can't do the equation unless
I have all the variables.

869
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:16,456
You think Fury's hiding something?

870
00:57:16,476 --> 00:57:17,348
He's a spy.

871
00:57:17,644 --> 00:57:19,282
Captain, he's the spy.

872
00:57:19,729 --> 00:57:21,131
His secrets have secrets.

873
00:57:21,648 --> 00:57:22,970
It's bugging him, too.
Isn't it?

874
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,711
I just want to finish my work here, and...

875
00:57:27,728 --> 00:57:28,620
Doctor?

876
00:57:34,035 --> 00:57:36,254
A warm light for all mankind.

877
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:38,846
Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.

878
00:57:38,949 --> 00:57:39,843
I heard it.

879
00:57:39,911 --> 00:57:41,446
Well, I think that was meant for you.

880
00:57:43,336 --> 00:57:45,491
Even if Barton didn't tell Loki...

881
00:57:45,573 --> 00:57:47,662
about the tower,
it was still all over the news.

882
00:57:47,674 --> 00:57:48,734
The Stark Tower?

883
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:50,335
That big, ugly...

884
00:57:51,276 --> 00:57:52,511
building in New York?

885
00:57:52,563 --> 00:57:55,217
It's powered by an arc reactor,
a self-sustaining energy source.

886
00:57:56,265 --> 00:57:58,224
That building will run itself for,
what a year?

887
00:57:58,851 --> 00:58:00,187
It's just the prototype.

888
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:02,810
I'm kind of the only name
in clean energy right now.

889
00:58:03,242 --> 00:58:04,182
That's what he's getting at.

890
00:58:04,184 --> 00:58:07,135
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. bring
him in on the Tesseract project?

891
00:58:07,502 --> 00:58:10,371
What are they doing in the energy
business in the first place?

892
00:58:10,808 --> 00:58:13,811
I should probably look into that
once my decryption program

893
00:58:13,813 --> 00:58:16,074
finishes breaking into
all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

894
00:58:16,498 --> 00:58:17,152
I'm sorry, did you say...

895
00:58:17,153 --> 00:58:19,280
Jarvis has been running it
since I hit the bridge.

896
00:58:19,414 --> 00:58:22,516
In a few hours, I'll know every dirty
secret S.H.I.E.L.D. has ever tried to hide.

897
00:58:22,517 --> 00:58:23,209
Blueberry?

898
00:58:23,211 --> 00:58:25,261
Yet you're confused about why
they didn't want you around.

899
00:58:25,545 --> 00:58:28,605
An intelligence organization
that fears intelligence.

900
00:58:28,606 --> 00:58:30,187
Historically, not awesome.

901
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:32,010
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

902
00:58:32,647 --> 00:58:34,347
This is a man who means to start a war

903
00:58:34,349 --> 00:58:36,130
and if we don't stay focused,
he'll succeed.

904
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:38,172
We have orders.

905
00:58:38,683 --> 00:58:39,698
We should follow them.

906
00:58:40,101 --> 00:58:41,536
Following's not really my style.

907
00:58:43,312 --> 00:58:44,780
And you're all about style, aren't you?

908
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:46,818
Of the people in this room,

909
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,644
which one is, A, wearing a spangly outfit,

910
00:58:48,735 --> 00:58:50,070
and, B, not of use?

911
00:58:50,153 --> 00:58:54,282
Steve, tell me none of this smells
a little funky to you.

912
00:58:57,390 --> 00:58:58,474
Just find the Cube.

913
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:12,967
That's the guy my dad
never shut up about?

914
00:59:13,593 --> 00:59:15,487
I'm wondering if they shouldn't have
kept him on ice.

915
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:18,931
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

916
00:59:19,015 --> 00:59:20,482
He does have the jump on us.

917
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:23,542
What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.

918
00:59:24,063 --> 00:59:25,375
It's going to blow up in his face.

919
00:59:25,688 --> 00:59:27,531
And I'm going to be there when it does.

920
00:59:28,316 --> 00:59:30,085
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

921
00:59:32,487 --> 00:59:34,183
Or you'll be suiting up
with the rest of us.

922
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:36,406
You see,

923
00:59:36,765 --> 00:59:38,554
I don't get a suit of armor.

924
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,196
I'm exposed.

925
00:59:41,289 --> 00:59:42,581
Like a nerve.

926
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:43,891
It's a nightmare.

927
00:59:44,499 --> 00:59:46,492
You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel...

928
00:59:46,663 --> 00:59:48,974
trying every second
to crawl its way into my heart.

929
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:50,975
This stops it.

930
00:59:51,756 --> 00:59:53,220
This little circle of light,

931
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:54,190
it's part of me now,

932
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:56,186
not just armor.

933
00:59:57,637 --> 00:59:59,674
It's a terrible privilege.

934
01:00:00,431 --> 01:00:01,936
But you can control it.

935
01:00:01,938 --> 01:00:02,819
Because I learned how.

936
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:03,931
It's different.

937
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:04,949
Hey,

938
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:07,255
I read all about your accident.

939
01:00:07,688 --> 01:00:09,053
That much gamma exposure,

940
01:00:09,406 --> 01:00:10,494
should have killed you.

941
01:00:11,192 --> 01:00:13,021
So you're saying that the Hulk...

942
01:00:15,113 --> 01:00:17,281
The other guy saved my life?

943
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:18,810
That's nice.

944
01:00:19,863 --> 01:00:20,910
It's a nice sentiment.

945
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:22,324
Saved it for...

946
01:00:22,732 --> 01:00:23,440
what?

947
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:26,235
I guess we'll find out.

948
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:29,966
You may not enjoy that.

949
01:00:30,503 --> 01:00:31,745
And you just might.

950
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:34,449
As soon as Loki took the doctor,
we moved Jane Foster.

951
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:37,486
They've got an excellent
observatory in Tromsø.

952
01:01:37,507 --> 01:01:40,419
She was asked to consult there
very suddenly yesterday.

953
01:01:41,177 --> 01:01:43,113
Handsome fee, private plane,

954
01:01:43,372 --> 01:01:44,512
very remote.

955
01:01:45,786 --> 01:01:46,871
She'll be safe.

956
01:01:47,008 --> 01:01:47,888
Thank you.

957
01:01:50,249 --> 01:01:52,084
It's no accident,
Loki taking Erik Selvig.

958
01:01:53,294 --> 01:01:55,334
I dread what he plans
for him once he's done.

959
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,046
Erik is a good man.

960
01:01:57,313 --> 01:01:58,426
He talks about you a lot.

961
01:02:00,134 --> 01:02:01,436
You changed his life.

962
01:02:03,804 --> 01:02:05,427
You changed everything around here.

963
01:02:05,868 --> 01:02:07,355
They were better as they were.

964
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:11,277
We pretend on Asgard that we're
more advanced but we...

965
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:14,100
we come here, battling like bilge snipe.

966
01:02:14,607 --> 01:02:16,167
Like what?
Bilge snipe.

967
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:19,090
You know, huge, scaly, big antlers.

968
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:22,043
You don't have those?
I don't think so.

969
01:02:22,323 --> 01:02:23,842
Well, they are repulsive.

970
01:02:25,493 --> 01:02:27,370
And they trample everything
in their path.

971
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:36,995
When I first came to Earth,

972
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,080
Loki's rage followed me here,

973
01:02:39,082 --> 01:02:40,451
and your people paid the price.

974
01:02:41,342 --> 01:02:42,515
And now again.

975
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,483
In my youth, I courted war.

976
01:02:49,934 --> 01:02:51,429
War hasn't started yet.

977
01:02:53,062 --> 01:02:56,030
You think you could make Loki tell us
where the Tesseract is?

978
01:02:56,237 --> 01:02:57,469
I do not know.

979
01:02:57,994 --> 01:02:59,718
Loki's mind is far afield.

980
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:03,332
It's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance, upon me.

981
01:03:04,615 --> 01:03:06,750
There's no pain would praise
his need from him.

982
01:03:07,827 --> 01:03:09,364
A lot of guys think that,

983
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:11,738
until the pain starts.

984
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:15,459
What are you asking me to do?

985
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:19,046
I'm asking,
what are you prepared to do?

986
01:03:19,313 --> 01:03:20,448
Loki is a prisoner.

987
01:03:20,471 --> 01:03:24,267
Then why do I feel like he's the only person
on this boat that wants to be here?

988
01:03:37,064 --> 01:03:39,431
There's not many people
who can sneak up on me.

989
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:41,902
But you figured I'd come.

990
01:03:42,653 --> 01:03:43,771
After.

991
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:48,066
After whatever tortures Fury can concoct,

992
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:50,307
you would appear as a friend,

993
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:52,068
as a balm.

994
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:54,832
And I would cooperate.

995
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:56,962
I want to know what you've done
to Agent Barton.

996
01:03:57,309 --> 01:03:59,145
I would say I've expanded his mind.

997
01:04:01,756 --> 01:04:03,458
And once you've won,

998
01:04:04,258 --> 01:04:05,593
once you're king of the mountain,

999
01:04:08,012 --> 01:04:09,889
what happens to his mind?

1000
01:04:11,766 --> 01:04:13,488
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

1001
01:04:13,684 --> 01:04:16,312
Love is for children.
I owe him a debt.

1002
01:04:20,399 --> 01:04:21,427
Tell me.

1003
01:04:26,614 --> 01:04:29,815
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L.D. I have...

1004
01:04:32,286 --> 01:04:33,045
Well...

1005
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,398
I made a name for myself.

1006
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:38,632
I have a very specific skill set.

1007
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:41,325
I didn't care who I used it for,

1008
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:42,904
or on.

1009
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:46,511
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar
in a bad way.

1010
01:04:48,803 --> 01:04:50,709
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.

1011
01:04:52,765 --> 01:04:54,141
He made a different call.

1012
01:04:56,268 --> 01:04:58,758
And what will you do if
I vow to spare him?

1013
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:00,733
Not let you out.

1014
01:05:00,735 --> 01:05:02,375
No, but I like this.

1015
01:05:03,943 --> 01:05:07,196
Your world in the balance,
and you bargain for one man.

1016
01:05:07,488 --> 01:05:09,184
Regimes fall every day.

1017
01:05:09,657 --> 01:05:11,737
I tend not to weep over that.
I'm Russian.

1018
01:05:12,118 --> 01:05:13,160
Or I was.

1019
01:05:14,662 --> 01:05:15,912
And what are you now?

1020
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:18,750
It's really not that complicated.

1021
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:21,372
I got red in my ledger,

1022
01:05:21,878 --> 01:05:23,447
I'd like to wipe it out.

1023
01:05:24,886 --> 01:05:25,680
Can you?

1024
01:05:27,842 --> 01:05:30,672
Can you wipe out that much red?

1025
01:05:32,805 --> 01:05:34,247
Dreykov's daughter,

1026
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:37,155
São Paulo,

1027
01:05:38,894 --> 01:05:40,234
the hospital fire?

1028
01:05:42,231 --> 01:05:43,892
Barton told me everything.

1029
01:05:44,692 --> 01:05:46,337
Your ledger is dripping.

1030
01:05:46,686 --> 01:05:47,918
It's gushing red

1031
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,949
and you think saving a man no more virtuous
than yourself will change anything?

1032
01:05:52,032 --> 01:05:54,359
This is the basest sentimentality.

1033
01:05:54,869 --> 01:05:57,121
This is a child at prayer.

1034
01:05:57,204 --> 01:05:58,372
Pathetic!

1035
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:01,166
You lie and kill...

1036
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:05,129
in the service of liars and killers.

1037
01:06:08,174 --> 01:06:09,592
You pretend to be separate,

1038
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,219
to have your own code,

1039
01:06:11,469 --> 01:06:13,581
something that makes up
for the horrors.

1040
01:06:15,268 --> 01:06:16,719
But they are part of you.

1041
01:06:17,892 --> 01:06:20,637
And they will never go away.

1042
01:06:22,706 --> 01:06:23,879
I won't touch Barton,

1043
01:06:23,881 --> 01:06:25,627
not until I make him kill you.

1044
01:06:25,759 --> 01:06:28,011
Slowly, intimately,

1045
01:06:28,235 --> 01:06:30,419
in every way he knows you fear.

1046
01:06:30,779 --> 01:06:33,683
And then he'll wake just long
enough to see his good work

1047
01:06:33,858 --> 01:06:36,642
and when he screams,
I'll split his skull.

1048
01:06:37,575 --> 01:06:40,005
This is my bargain,
you mewling quim.

1049
01:06:42,249 --> 01:06:43,529
You're a monster.

1050
01:06:46,086 --> 01:06:47,288
Oh, no.

1051
01:06:48,464 --> 01:06:49,927
You brought the monster.

1052
01:06:53,052 --> 01:06:54,579
So, Banner.

1053
01:06:55,429 --> 01:06:56,648
That's your play.

1054
01:06:57,034 --> 01:06:58,035
What?

1055
01:06:58,692 --> 01:07:00,319
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.

1056
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:02,102
Keep Banner in the lab.
I'm on my way.

1057
01:07:02,186 --> 01:07:03,270
Send Thor as well.

1058
01:07:05,102 --> 01:07:06,020
Thank you,

1059
01:07:06,537 --> 01:07:08,113
for your cooperation.

1060
01:07:16,242 --> 01:07:17,701
What are you doing, Mr. Stark?

1061
01:07:18,309 --> 01:07:20,371
Kind of been wondering
the same thing about you.

1062
01:07:20,585 --> 01:07:22,301
You're supposed to be
locating the Tesseract.

1063
01:07:22,303 --> 01:07:23,775
We are.
The model's locked

1064
01:07:23,777 --> 01:07:25,495
and we're sweeping
for the signature now.

1065
01:07:25,497 --> 01:07:26,452
When we get a hit,

1066
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:28,443
we'll have the location
within half a mile.

1067
01:07:28,796 --> 01:07:31,950
Yeah, then you get your Cube back.
No muss, no fuss.

1068
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:34,307
What is Phase 2?

1069
01:07:36,512 --> 01:07:39,132
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. uses
the Cube to make weapons.

1070
01:07:39,363 --> 01:07:41,556
Sorry, computer was moving
a little slow for me.

1071
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:44,102
Rogers, we gathered everything
related to the Tesseract.

1072
01:07:44,104 --> 01:07:46,251
This does not mean that we're making...
I'm sorry, Nick.

1073
01:07:46,605 --> 01:07:47,983
What were you lying?

1074
01:07:49,066 --> 01:07:50,359
I was wrong, Director.

1075
01:07:50,515 --> 01:07:51,670
The world hasn't changed a bit.

1076
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:52,985
Did you know about this?

1077
01:07:52,987 --> 01:07:54,655
You want to think about
removing yourself

1078
01:07:54,657 --> 01:07:55,766
from this environment, Doctor?

1079
01:07:55,948 --> 01:07:58,116
I was in Calcutta.
I was pretty well removed.

1080
01:07:58,117 --> 01:07:59,451
Loki is manipulating you.

1081
01:07:59,503 --> 01:08:00,943
And you've been doing what, exactly?

1082
01:08:00,945 --> 01:08:02,955
You didn't come here because
I bat my eyelashes at you.

1083
01:08:02,957 --> 01:08:03,924
Yes, and I'm not leaving

1084
01:08:03,926 --> 01:08:05,478
because suddenly you get a little twitchy.

1085
01:08:05,551 --> 01:08:07,431
I'd like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.

1086
01:08:07,433 --> 01:08:10,620
is using the Tesseract
to build weapons of mass destruction.

1087
01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:12,965
Because of him.

1088
01:08:14,241 --> 01:08:15,126
Me?

1089
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:18,510
Last year, Earth had
a visitor from another planet

1090
01:08:18,512 --> 01:08:21,723
who had a grudge match
that leveled a small town.

1091
01:08:21,974 --> 01:08:24,101
We learned that not only
are we not alone

1092
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:27,938
but we are hopelessly,
hilariously, outgunned.

1093
01:08:28,022 --> 01:08:30,149
My people want nothing
but peace with your planet.

1094
01:08:30,151 --> 01:08:31,974
But you're not the only people
out there, are you?

1095
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:34,362
And you're not the only threat.

1096
01:08:34,528 --> 01:08:37,531
The world's filling up with people
who can't be matched,

1097
01:08:38,198 --> 01:08:39,533
that can't be controlled.

1098
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:40,886
Like you controlled the Cube?

1099
01:08:40,888 --> 01:08:43,740
Your work with the Tesseract
is what drew Loki to it,

1100
01:08:43,742 --> 01:08:44,851
and his allies.

1101
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:49,293
It is a signal to all the realms that the Earth
is ready for a higher form of war.

1102
01:08:49,376 --> 01:08:50,461
A higher form?

1103
01:08:50,544 --> 01:08:51,670
You forced our hand.

1104
01:08:51,754 --> 01:08:53,656
We had to come up with something.
A nuclear deterrent.

1105
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:55,882
Because that always calms
everything right down.

1106
01:08:56,091 --> 01:08:58,510
Remind me again how
you made your fortune, Stark.

1107
01:08:58,594 --> 01:09:00,874
I'm sure if he still made weapons,
Stark would be neck-deep...

1108
01:09:00,876 --> 01:09:02,676
Wait, wait. Hold on.
How is this now about me?

1109
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:03,974
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

1110
01:09:04,058 --> 01:09:06,018
I thought humans
were more evolved than this.

1111
01:09:06,101 --> 01:09:09,021
Excuse me, did we come to
your planet and blow stuff up?

1112
01:09:09,104 --> 01:09:10,981
You treat your champions
with such mistrust.

1113
01:09:10,990 --> 01:09:12,357
Are you boys really that naive?

1114
01:09:12,691 --> 01:09:14,610
S.H.I.E.L.D. monitors potential threats.

1115
01:09:14,693 --> 01:09:16,054
Captain America's on threat watch?

1116
01:09:16,056 --> 01:09:17,057
We all are.

1117
01:09:17,059 --> 01:09:18,560
Wait, you're on that list?

1118
01:09:18,562 --> 01:09:20,147
Are you above or below angry bees?

1119
01:09:20,449 --> 01:09:22,618
Stark, so help me God,
if you make one more wisecrack...

1120
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:23,994
Threat! Verbal threat.
I feel threatened.

1121
01:09:24,078 --> 01:09:25,732
Show some respect.
Respect what?

1122
01:09:33,921 --> 01:09:35,334
<i>Transport Six-Six-Bravo,</i>

1123
01:09:35,336 --> 01:09:36,827
<i>please relay confirm codes.</i>

1124
01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:39,176
<i>I've got you on the computer,
but not on the day log.</i>

1125
01:09:39,259 --> 01:09:40,941
<i>What is your haul?
Over.</i>

1126
01:09:41,428 --> 01:09:43,373
<i>Arms and ammunition.
Over.</i>

1127
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:54,692
You speak of control,
yet you court chaos.

1128
01:09:54,712 --> 01:09:56,036
That's his M.O., isn't it?

1129
01:09:56,532 --> 01:09:57,783
I mean, what are we, a team?

1130
01:09:57,867 --> 01:10:00,789
No, no, no, we're a chemical mixture
that makes chaos.

1131
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:02,844
We're... We're a time bomb.

1132
01:10:03,117 --> 01:10:05,035
You need to step away.

1133
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:06,995
Why shouldn't
the guy let off a little steam?

1134
01:10:06,997 --> 01:10:08,860
You know damn well why.
Back off!

1135
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:10,943
I'm starting to want you to make me.

1136
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:12,207
Yeah.

1137
01:10:12,505 --> 01:10:14,434
Big man in a suit of armor.

1138
01:10:15,421 --> 01:10:16,871
Take that off, what are you?

1139
01:10:17,105 --> 01:10:19,399
Genius, billionaire, playboy,
philanthropist.

1140
01:10:20,131 --> 01:10:22,530
I know guys with none
of that worth ten of you.

1141
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:24,519
I've seen the footage.

1142
01:10:24,638 --> 01:10:26,795
The only thing you really fight
for is yourself.

1143
01:10:28,126 --> 01:10:30,086
You're not the guy to make
the sacrifice play,

1144
01:10:30,394 --> 01:10:32,930
to lay down on a wire and let
the other guy crawl over you.

1145
01:10:32,933 --> 01:10:34,425
I think I would just cut the wire.

1146
01:10:37,697 --> 01:10:39,049
Always a way out.

1147
01:10:40,112 --> 01:10:41,405
You know you may not be a threat

1148
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:43,242
but you better stop pretending
to be a hero.

1149
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:45,410
A hero?
Like you?

1150
01:10:46,118 --> 01:10:48,078
You're a laboratory
experiment, Rogers.

1151
01:10:48,287 --> 01:10:51,114
Everything special about you
came out of a bottle.

1152
01:11:17,191 --> 01:11:19,195
Put on the suit.
Let's go a few rounds.

1153
01:11:21,028 --> 01:11:22,690
You people are so petty...

1154
01:11:23,614 --> 01:11:24,617
and tiny.

1155
01:11:24,674 --> 01:11:25,739
Yeah, this is a team.

1156
01:11:25,741 --> 01:11:27,204
Agent Romanoff, would you escort.

1157
01:11:27,206 --> 01:11:28,725
Dr. Banner back to his...
Where?

1158
01:11:29,148 --> 01:11:30,160
You rented my room.

1159
01:11:30,162 --> 01:11:32,032
The cell was just in case...

1160
01:11:32,039 --> 01:11:33,290
In case you needed to kill me.

1161
01:11:33,292 --> 01:11:35,558
But you can't.
I know, I tried.

1162
01:11:39,046 --> 01:11:40,058
I got low.

1163
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:41,989
I didn't see an end,

1164
01:11:42,135 --> 01:11:45,417
so I put a bullet in my mouth,
and the other guy spit it out.

1165
01:11:47,183 --> 01:11:48,354
So I moved on.

1166
01:11:48,356 --> 01:11:51,216
I focused on helping other people.
I was good.

1167
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:53,916
Until you dragged me back
into this freak show

1168
01:11:54,071 --> 01:11:55,392
and put everyone here at risk.

1169
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:57,397
You want to know my secret,
Agent Romanoff?

1170
01:11:57,399 --> 01:11:58,984
You want to know how I stay calm?

1171
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:03,314
Dr. Banner,

1172
01:12:04,939 --> 01:12:06,347
put down the scepter.

1173
01:12:15,165 --> 01:12:16,005
Got it.

1174
01:12:17,514 --> 01:12:20,320
Sorry kids, you don't get to see
my party trick after all.

1175
01:12:20,322 --> 01:12:22,112
You located the Tesseract?
I could get there fastest.

1176
01:12:22,114 --> 01:12:24,593
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard.
No human is a match for it.

1177
01:12:24,595 --> 01:12:26,061
You're not going alone.
You're gonna stop me?

1178
01:12:26,078 --> 01:12:27,150
Put on the suit, let's find out.

1179
01:12:27,152 --> 01:12:28,510
I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

1180
01:12:28,684 --> 01:12:29,685
Put on the suit.

1181
01:12:32,558 --> 01:12:33,634
Oh, my God.

1182
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:50,600
Put on the suit.

1183
01:12:50,602 --> 01:12:51,198
Yeah.

1184
01:12:54,872 --> 01:12:56,323
<i>All hands to stations.</i>

1185
01:13:00,752 --> 01:13:02,462
Hill!
<i>External detonation.</i>

1186
01:13:02,490 --> 01:13:04,546
Number three engine is down.

1187
01:13:05,132 --> 01:13:06,172
Can they get it running?

1188
01:13:07,166 --> 01:13:09,331
Talk to me.
Turbine looks mostly intact

1189
01:13:09,344 --> 01:13:12,325
but it's impossible to get out there
to make repairs while we're in the air.

1190
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:14,875
If we lose one more engine,
we won't be.

1191
01:13:15,559 --> 01:13:17,616
Somebody's got to get outside
and patch that engine.

1192
01:13:17,662 --> 01:13:19,410
Stark, you copy that?
<i>I'm on it.</i>

1193
01:13:19,521 --> 01:13:21,790
Coulson, initiate defensive lock down

1194
01:13:21,857 --> 01:13:24,013
in the detention section
then get to the armory.

1195
01:13:24,371 --> 01:13:25,414
Romanoff?

1196
01:13:28,822 --> 01:13:29,755
We're ok.

1197
01:13:32,618 --> 01:13:33,840
We're ok, right?

1198
01:13:46,715 --> 01:13:47,966
Keep that engine down!
Yes, sir.

1199
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:49,760
Detention, wait for cameras to go dark.

1200
01:13:49,796 --> 01:13:51,073
Got it.
Stay close.

1201
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:54,973
Let's go, Level 4.

1202
01:13:55,849 --> 01:13:57,777
Engine three.
I'll meet you there.

1203
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:07,819
Doctor?

1204
01:14:10,085 --> 01:14:11,086
Bruce?

1205
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:12,725
You got to fight it.

1206
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:14,742
This is just what Loki wants.

1207
01:14:16,523 --> 01:14:17,691
We're going to be ok.
Listen to me.

1208
01:14:18,507 --> 01:14:19,428
Are you hurt?

1209
01:14:22,336 --> 01:14:23,400
We're going to be ok.

1210
01:14:23,402 --> 01:14:24,170
Alright?

1211
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:26,267
I swear on my life,

1212
01:14:26,269 --> 01:14:27,410
I will get you out of this.

1213
01:14:27,412 --> 01:14:28,922
You will walk away and never ever...

1214
01:14:28,924 --> 01:14:30,164
Your life?

1215
01:14:47,444 --> 01:14:48,445
Bruce.

1216
01:15:25,292 --> 01:15:28,183
Bring the carrier about to a 1-8-0,
heading south!

1217
01:15:28,692 --> 01:15:30,559
Take us to the water!
We're flying blind.

1218
01:15:30,694 --> 01:15:32,734
Navigation's recalibrating
after the engine failure.

1219
01:15:32,736 --> 01:15:34,238
Is the sun coming up?

1220
01:15:35,323 --> 01:15:37,379
Yes, sir.
Then put it on the left.

1221
01:15:37,734 --> 01:15:39,236
Get us over water.

1222
01:15:39,453 --> 01:15:41,379
One more turbine goes down,
and we drop.

1223
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:49,239
Stark!

1224
01:15:52,299 --> 01:15:53,535
Stark, I'm here!

1225
01:15:54,092 --> 01:15:55,302
<i>Good.</i>

1226
01:15:56,803 --> 01:15:57,870
<i>Let's see what we've got.</i>

1227
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:01,725
I got to get this superconducting
coolant system back online

1228
01:16:01,808 --> 01:16:03,351
before I can access the rotors,

1229
01:16:03,435 --> 01:16:05,020
work on dislodging the debris.

1230
01:16:07,522 --> 01:16:09,615
<i>I need you to get to that
engine control panel</i>

1231
01:16:09,616 --> 01:16:11,572
<i>and tell me which relays
are in overload position.</i>

1232
01:16:25,363 --> 01:16:26,519
<i>What does it look like in there?</i>

1233
01:16:27,709 --> 01:16:29,932
It seems to run on some form
of electricity.

1234
01:16:30,337 --> 01:16:31,605
Well, you're not wrong.

1235
01:17:35,944 --> 01:17:38,434
We are not your enemies, Banner.

1236
01:17:38,738 --> 01:17:40,434
Try to think!

1237
01:17:50,041 --> 01:17:51,598
<i>Ok, the relays are intact.</i>

1238
01:17:52,043 --> 01:17:53,440
What's our next move?

1239
01:17:53,442 --> 01:17:54,665
<i>Even if I clear the rotors,</i>

1240
01:17:54,713 --> 01:17:56,651
<i>this thing won't re-engage
without a jump.</i>

1241
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:58,430
I'm going to have to get in there and push.

1242
01:17:58,514 --> 01:18:00,350
If that thing gets up to speed,
you'll get shredded.

1243
01:18:00,468 --> 01:18:02,594
That stator control unit
can reverse the polarity

1244
01:18:02,596 --> 01:18:04,091
long enough to disengage
Maglev and that could...

1245
01:18:04,097 --> 01:18:05,265
Speak English!

1246
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:08,170
You see that red lever?

1247
01:18:09,227 --> 01:18:11,390
<i>It will slow the rotors down
long enough for me to get out.</i>

1248
01:18:11,392 --> 01:18:13,380
Stand by it.
Wait for my word.

1249
01:19:05,773 --> 01:19:07,621
We need full evac
on the lower hangar bay.

1250
01:19:10,872 --> 01:19:11,957
Grenade!

1251
01:19:27,013 --> 01:19:28,431
<i>We've got a perimeter breach!</i>

1252
01:19:28,515 --> 01:19:30,600
<i>Hostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D. gear.</i>

1253
01:19:30,602 --> 01:19:31,932
<i>Call-outs at every junction.</i>

1254
01:19:39,932 --> 01:19:42,406
<i>We have the Hulk and Thor
on Research Level 4.</i>

1255
01:19:42,408 --> 01:19:43,972
<i>Levels 2 and 3 are dark.</i>

1256
01:19:44,072 --> 01:19:46,032
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!

1257
01:19:47,582 --> 01:19:48,533
Get his attention.

1258
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:52,308
Escort 6-0, proceed to Wishbone
and engage hostile.

1259
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:54,074
Don't get too close.

1260
01:19:54,249 --> 01:19:55,171
<i>Copy.</i>

1261
01:20:07,554 --> 01:20:08,621
<i>Target acquired.</i>

1262
01:20:13,143 --> 01:20:14,364
<i>Target engaged.</i>

1263
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:27,520
<i>Target angry, target angry!</i>

1264
01:21:35,809 --> 01:21:37,894
They're not getting through
here, so what the hell...

1265
01:21:56,413 --> 01:21:58,135
<i>Engine one is now in shut-down.</i>

1266
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:09,300
We are in an uncontrolled descent.

1267
01:22:09,336 --> 01:22:11,348
<i>Sir, we've lost all power
in engine one.</i>

1268
01:22:11,803 --> 01:22:13,680
<i>It's Barton.
He took out our systems.</i>

1269
01:22:13,763 --> 01:22:15,453
<i>He's headed for the detention level.</i>

1270
01:22:16,349 --> 01:22:17,662
<i>Does anybody copy?</i>

1271
01:22:19,519 --> 01:22:20,859
This is Agent Romanoff.

1272
01:22:21,771 --> 01:22:22,751
I copy.

1273
01:22:27,569 --> 01:22:28,969
<i>Stark, we're losing altitude.</i>

1274
01:22:28,987 --> 01:22:30,238
Yeah, I noticed.

1275
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:00,351
No!

1276
01:23:08,109 --> 01:23:10,268
Are you ever not going
to fall for that?

1277
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:55,680
The humans think us immortal.

1278
01:23:57,158 --> 01:23:58,369
Should we test that?

1279
01:24:01,371 --> 01:24:02,455
Move away, please.

1280
01:24:07,103 --> 01:24:08,073
You like this?

1281
01:24:09,629 --> 01:24:12,480
We started working on the prototype
after you sent the Destroyer.

1282
01:24:14,092 --> 01:24:15,821
Even I don't know what it does.

1283
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:18,344
Do you want to find out?

1284
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:21,641
No!

1285
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:32,292
Natasha?

1286
01:26:04,314 --> 01:26:05,482
You're going to lose.

1287
01:26:08,164 --> 01:26:09,118
Am I?

1288
01:26:10,667 --> 01:26:12,163
It's in your nature.

1289
01:26:15,338 --> 01:26:16,956
Your heroes are scattered.

1290
01:26:17,799 --> 01:26:20,501
Your floating fortress falls from the sky.

1291
01:26:21,636 --> 01:26:22,929
Where is my disadvantage?

1292
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:25,765
You lack conviction.

1293
01:26:26,856 --> 01:26:27,643
I don't think I'm...

1294
01:26:34,691 --> 01:26:36,113
So, that's what it does.

1295
01:26:38,486 --> 01:26:41,169
<i>All hands to crash
stations immediately.</i>

1296
01:27:08,933 --> 01:27:09,934
Cap, hit the lever.

1297
01:27:10,601 --> 01:27:12,170
I need a minute here!

1298
01:27:13,271 --> 01:27:14,397
Lever.

1299
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,481
Now!

1300
01:27:27,618 --> 01:27:28,786
<i>Help!</i>

1301
01:28:04,363 --> 01:28:05,521
Sorry, boss.

1302
01:28:05,865 --> 01:28:07,070
The god rabbited.

1303
01:28:07,963 --> 01:28:08,971
Just stay awake.

1304
01:28:09,285 --> 01:28:10,745
Eyes on me.

1305
01:28:11,037 --> 01:28:12,413
No, I'm clocking out here.

1306
01:28:12,705 --> 01:28:13,873
Not an option.

1307
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:16,552
It's ok, boss.

1308
01:28:19,086 --> 01:28:20,569
This was never gonna work,

1309
01:28:21,255 --> 01:28:22,603
if they didn't have something...

1310
01:28:23,883 --> 01:28:24,694
to...

1311
01:28:54,539 --> 01:28:56,154
<i>Agent Coulson is down.</i>

1312
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,502
<i>A medical team is on
its way to your location.</i>

1313
01:28:59,522 --> 01:29:00,275
<i>They're here.</i>

1314
01:29:04,257 --> 01:29:05,067
They called it.

1315
01:29:22,149 --> 01:29:24,518
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

1316
01:29:27,154 --> 01:29:29,323
I guess he never did get you to sign them.

1317
01:29:32,952 --> 01:29:34,493
We're dead in the air up here.

1318
01:29:34,745 --> 01:29:35,914
Our communications,

1319
01:29:35,916 --> 01:29:37,370
the location of the Cube,

1320
01:29:38,249 --> 01:29:40,173
Banner, Thor...

1321
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,182
I got nothing for you.

1322
01:29:43,713 --> 01:29:45,701
I lost my one good eye.

1323
01:29:49,635 --> 01:29:51,096
Maybe I had that coming.

1324
01:29:56,893 --> 01:29:57,920
Yes,

1325
01:29:59,312 --> 01:30:02,341
we were going to build
an arsenal with the Tesseract.

1326
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:06,233
I never put all my chips
on that number, though

1327
01:30:06,235 --> 01:30:08,405
because I was playing
something even riskier.

1328
01:30:13,159 --> 01:30:14,167
There was an idea,

1329
01:30:15,185 --> 01:30:16,979
Stark knows this,

1330
01:30:19,165 --> 01:30:21,733
called the Avengers Initiative.

1331
01:30:23,753 --> 01:30:25,922
The idea was to bring together a group

1332
01:30:25,924 --> 01:30:28,027
of remarkable people

1333
01:30:29,342 --> 01:30:31,381
to see if they could
become something more.

1334
01:30:33,512 --> 01:30:36,530
To see if they could work together
when we needed them to...

1335
01:30:37,573 --> 01:30:39,864
to fight the battles that we never could.

1336
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:47,923
Phil Coulson died still
believing in that idea.

1337
01:30:51,155 --> 01:30:52,365
In heroes.

1338
01:31:00,873 --> 01:31:01,803
Well...

1339
01:31:03,248 --> 01:31:05,057
it's an old-fashioned notion.

1340
01:31:26,273 --> 01:31:28,134
<i>You fell out of the sky.</i>

1341
01:31:42,761 --> 01:31:43,776
Did I hurt anybody?

1342
01:31:44,834 --> 01:31:46,716
There's nobody around here to get hurt.

1343
01:31:47,586 --> 01:31:50,224
You did scare the hell
out of some pigeons, though.

1344
01:31:51,757 --> 01:31:52,675
Lucky.

1345
01:31:52,866 --> 01:31:54,491
Or just good aim.

1346
01:31:54,746 --> 01:31:56,339
You were awake when you fell.

1347
01:31:58,305 --> 01:32:00,099
You saw?
The whole thing.

1348
01:32:00,266 --> 01:32:01,770
Right through the ceiling.

1349
01:32:02,268 --> 01:32:05,443
Big and green and buck-ass nude.

1350
01:32:06,313 --> 01:32:07,060
Here.

1351
01:32:08,816 --> 01:32:12,637
Didn't think those would fit you until
you shrunk down to a regular-size feller.

1352
01:32:15,906 --> 01:32:16,941
Thank you.

1353
01:32:18,354 --> 01:32:19,522
Are you an alien?

1354
01:32:19,925 --> 01:32:20,886
What?

1355
01:32:21,497 --> 01:32:23,073
From outer space, an alien.

1356
01:32:23,431 --> 01:32:24,245
No.

1357
01:32:24,874 --> 01:32:26,302
Well then, son,

1358
01:32:26,574 --> 01:32:28,000
you've got a condition.

1359
01:32:38,596 --> 01:32:39,384
Clint.

1360
01:32:40,071 --> 01:32:41,189
You're going to be alright.

1361
01:32:44,477 --> 01:32:45,603
You know that?

1362
01:32:47,438 --> 01:32:48,811
Is that what you know?

1363
01:32:51,776 --> 01:32:52,460
I've...

1364
01:32:53,198 --> 01:32:54,425
got no window.

1365
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:56,842
I have to flush him out.

1366
01:32:57,698 --> 01:32:59,575
You got to level out.
It's going to take time.

1367
01:32:59,658 --> 01:33:00,935
You don't understand.

1368
01:33:03,162 --> 01:33:05,773
Have you ever had someone
take your brain and play?

1369
01:33:07,208 --> 01:33:08,275
Pull you out...

1370
01:33:09,058 --> 01:33:10,580
and stuff something else in?

1371
01:33:14,548 --> 01:33:16,419
Do you know what it's like
to be unmade?

1372
01:33:18,511 --> 01:33:19,668
You know that I do.

1373
01:33:28,522 --> 01:33:29,599
Why am I back?

1374
01:33:30,453 --> 01:33:31,727
How did you get him out?

1375
01:33:32,149 --> 01:33:33,763
Cognitive recalibration.

1376
01:33:34,994 --> 01:33:36,538
I hit you really hard on the head.

1377
01:33:38,199 --> 01:33:39,146
Thanks.

1378
01:33:43,327 --> 01:33:44,198
Natasha...

1379
01:33:45,858 --> 01:33:47,616
How many agents did I...
Don't.

1380
01:33:48,541 --> 01:33:50,284
Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

1381
01:33:51,335 --> 01:33:52,548
This is Loki.

1382
01:33:53,114 --> 01:33:53,972
This is...

1383
01:33:54,371 --> 01:33:55,782
monsters and magic,

1384
01:33:55,784 --> 01:33:57,659
and nothing we were ever trained for.

1385
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:59,332
Loki, did he get away?

1386
01:33:59,551 --> 01:34:00,258
Yeah.

1387
01:34:00,678 --> 01:34:02,127
I don't suppose you know where.

1388
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:04,184
I didn't need to know.

1389
01:34:04,974 --> 01:34:06,000
I didn't ask.

1390
01:34:09,979 --> 01:34:11,670
He's going to make
his play soon, though.

1391
01:34:13,085 --> 01:34:13,897
Today.

1392
01:34:13,984 --> 01:34:15,110
We got to stop him.

1393
01:34:15,857 --> 01:34:17,192
Yeah?
Who's we?

1394
01:34:17,194 --> 01:34:19,029
I don't know.
Whoever's left.

1395
01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:21,177
Well...

1396
01:34:23,576 --> 01:34:25,744
if I put an arrow through
Loki's eye socket,

1397
01:34:25,870 --> 01:34:27,748
I would sleep better, I suppose.

1398
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:32,611
Now you sound like you.

1399
01:34:33,419 --> 01:34:34,609
But you don't.

1400
01:34:37,089 --> 01:34:38,063
You're a spy,

1401
01:34:38,228 --> 01:34:39,534
not a soldier.

1402
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:41,033
Now you want to...

1403
01:34:41,629 --> 01:34:43,094
wade into a war.

1404
01:34:43,423 --> 01:34:44,076
Why?

1405
01:34:46,479 --> 01:34:47,738
What did Loki do to you?

1406
01:34:49,268 --> 01:34:50,710
He didn't.
I just...

1407
01:34:55,441 --> 01:34:56,441
Natasha.

1408
01:34:59,006 --> 01:35:00,575
I've been compromised.

1409
01:35:04,116 --> 01:35:05,615
I got red in my ledger.

1410
01:35:08,229 --> 01:35:09,742
I would like to wipe it out.

1411
01:35:26,472 --> 01:35:27,501
Was he married?

1412
01:35:28,069 --> 01:35:28,705
No.

1413
01:35:29,642 --> 01:35:30,719
There was a...

1414
01:35:31,445 --> 01:35:33,561
cellist, I think.

1415
01:35:35,394 --> 01:35:36,229
I'm sorry.

1416
01:35:37,608 --> 01:35:38,943
He seemed like a good man.

1417
01:35:40,527 --> 01:35:41,574
He was an idiot.

1418
01:35:41,598 --> 01:35:43,683
Why?
For believing?

1419
01:35:43,867 --> 01:35:45,118
For taking on Loki alone.

1420
01:35:45,658 --> 01:35:47,018
He was doing his job.

1421
01:35:47,493 --> 01:35:48,524
He was out of his league.

1422
01:35:48,702 --> 01:35:49,829
He should have waited.

1423
01:35:50,208 --> 01:35:51,292
He should have...

1424
01:35:51,330 --> 01:35:52,895
Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

1425
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:54,901
Right, I've heard that before.

1426
01:35:55,334 --> 01:35:56,802
Is this the first time you lost a soldier?

1427
01:35:56,835 --> 01:35:58,526
We are not soldiers.

1428
01:36:03,175 --> 01:36:04,760
I'm not marching to Fury's fife.

1429
01:36:05,242 --> 01:36:06,262
Neither am I.

1430
01:36:06,264 --> 01:36:08,348
He's got the same blood
on his hands that Loki does.

1431
01:36:08,681 --> 01:36:11,338
But right now, we got to put
that behind us and get this done.

1432
01:36:12,283 --> 01:36:13,666
Loki needs a power source.

1433
01:36:13,777 --> 01:36:15,521
If we can put together a list...
He made it personal.

1434
01:36:15,854 --> 01:36:16,920
That's not the point.

1435
01:36:17,022 --> 01:36:19,441
That is the point.
That's Loki's point.

1436
01:36:19,650 --> 01:36:21,418
He hit us alright where we live.
Why?

1437
01:36:21,694 --> 01:36:22,521
To tear us apart.

1438
01:36:22,524 --> 01:36:23,715
Yeah, divide and conquer is...

1439
01:36:24,368 --> 01:36:25,097
great but...

1440
01:36:25,099 --> 01:36:27,284
he knows he has to take us
out to win, right?

1441
01:36:27,286 --> 01:36:28,642
That's what he wants.

1442
01:36:29,034 --> 01:36:31,046
He wants to beat us,
he wants to be seen doing it.

1443
01:36:31,453 --> 01:36:32,538
He wants an audience.

1444
01:36:33,539 --> 01:36:35,598
Alright. I caught his act in Stuttgart.
Yeah.

1445
01:36:35,992 --> 01:36:38,777
That was just previews.
This is opening night and...

1446
01:36:38,941 --> 01:36:40,964
Loki he's a full-tilt diva, right?

1447
01:36:41,046 --> 01:36:42,631
He wants flowers, he wants parades.

1448
01:36:42,715 --> 01:36:45,703
He wants a monument built to the skies
with his name plastered...

1449
01:36:48,262 --> 01:36:49,309
Son of a bitch.

1450
01:37:00,952 --> 01:37:01,925
Time to go.

1451
01:37:02,284 --> 01:37:03,804
Go where?
I'll tell you on the way.

1452
01:37:04,036 --> 01:37:05,236
Can you fly one of those jets?

1453
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:07,531
I can.

1454
01:37:11,332 --> 01:37:12,458
You got a suit?

1455
01:37:12,619 --> 01:37:13,620
Yeah.

1456
01:37:13,912 --> 01:37:14,952
Then suit up.

1457
01:37:43,018 --> 01:37:44,709
Hey, you guys aren't authorized
to be in here.

1458
01:37:44,713 --> 01:37:46,613
Son, just don't.

1459
01:37:48,947 --> 01:37:49,672
Sir.

1460
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:50,991
Agent Hill.

1461
01:37:51,742 --> 01:37:53,227
Those cards,

1462
01:37:55,454 --> 01:37:57,376
they were in Coulson's locker,

1463
01:37:57,717 --> 01:37:58,921
not in his jacket.

1464
01:38:03,915 --> 01:38:05,542
They needed the push.

1465
01:38:08,967 --> 01:38:11,407
<i>We have an unauthorized
departure from Bay 6.</i>

1466
01:38:11,887 --> 01:38:13,058
They found him.

1467
01:38:14,306 --> 01:38:16,750
Get our communications back up,
whatever you have to do.

1468
01:38:18,143 --> 01:38:19,974
I want eyes on everything.
Yes, sir.

1469
01:38:33,992 --> 01:38:35,744
<i>Sir, I've turned off the arc reactor</i>

1470
01:38:36,683 --> 01:38:39,173
<i>but the device is already self-sustaining.</i>

1471
01:38:39,790 --> 01:38:41,395
<i>Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.</i>

1472
01:38:42,666 --> 01:38:43,847
It's too late!

1473
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,315
She can't stop now.

1474
01:38:48,507 --> 01:38:50,250
She wants to show us something!

1475
01:38:51,194 --> 01:38:52,491
A new universe.

1476
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:54,113
<i>Ok.</i>

1477
01:39:01,812 --> 01:39:03,461
<i>The barrier is pure energy.</i>

1478
01:39:03,856 --> 01:39:05,482
<i>It's unbreachable.</i>

1479
01:39:05,816 --> 01:39:06,845
<i>Yeah, I got that.</i>

1480
01:39:08,527 --> 01:39:09,570
<i>Plan B.</i>

1481
01:39:10,988 --> 01:39:13,154
<i>Sir, the Mark 7 is not ready
for deployment.</i>

1482
01:39:13,156 --> 01:39:15,042
Then skip the spinning rims.
We're on the clock.

1483
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:37,825
Please tell me you're going
to appeal to my humanity.

1484
01:39:39,224 --> 01:39:40,966
Actually, I'm planning to threaten you.

1485
01:39:41,685 --> 01:39:43,405
You should have left
your armor on for that.

1486
01:39:43,437 --> 01:39:44,322
Yeah.

1487
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:46,945
It's seen a bit of mileage,
and you've got the...

1488
01:39:47,396 --> 01:39:48,851
glow stick of destiny.

1489
01:39:49,610 --> 01:39:50,720
Would you like a drink?

1490
01:39:51,917 --> 01:39:53,278
Stalling me won't change anything.

1491
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:54,491
No, no, no. Threatening.

1492
01:39:55,574 --> 01:39:56,658
No drink, are you sure?

1493
01:39:57,075 --> 01:39:58,180
I'm having one.

1494
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:00,863
The Chitauri are coming.

1495
01:40:01,824 --> 01:40:03,261
Nothing will change that.

1496
01:40:04,416 --> 01:40:05,673
What have I to fear?

1497
01:40:05,959 --> 01:40:06,849
The Avengers.

1498
01:40:09,653 --> 01:40:12,030
That's what we call ourselves.
We're sort of like a team.

1499
01:40:12,216 --> 01:40:13,930
Earth's mightiest heroes, type thing.

1500
01:40:13,967 --> 01:40:15,641
Yes, I've met them.

1501
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:16,739
Yeah.

1502
01:40:17,137 --> 01:40:19,340
It takes us a while to get any traction,
I'll give you that one.

1503
01:40:19,504 --> 01:40:21,324
But let's do a head count, here.

1504
01:40:21,829 --> 01:40:23,827
Your brother, the demigod,

1505
01:40:26,104 --> 01:40:29,525
a super soldier, a living legend
who kind of lives up to the legend.

1506
01:40:29,936 --> 01:40:33,028
A man with breathtaking
anger-management issues,

1507
01:40:33,111 --> 01:40:35,183
a couple of master assassins and you,

1508
01:40:35,381 --> 01:40:36,239
big fella,

1509
01:40:36,951 --> 01:40:39,440
you've managed to piss off
every single one of them.

1510
01:40:39,857 --> 01:40:40,900
That was the plan.

1511
01:40:41,136 --> 01:40:42,269
Not a great plan.

1512
01:40:43,053 --> 01:40:44,235
When they come,

1513
01:40:45,332 --> 01:40:46,421
and they will,

1514
01:40:46,917 --> 01:40:47,865
they'll come for you.

1515
01:40:48,317 --> 01:40:49,328
I have an army.

1516
01:40:49,330 --> 01:40:50,414
We have a Hulk.

1517
01:40:51,088 --> 01:40:52,568
I thought the beast had wandered off.

1518
01:40:52,570 --> 01:40:54,531
You're missing the point.
There is no throne.

1519
01:40:54,633 --> 01:40:57,762
There is no version of this
where you come out on top.

1520
01:40:58,702 --> 01:41:02,473
Maybe your army comes and maybe
it's too much for us, but it's all on you.

1521
01:41:04,017 --> 01:41:05,468
Because if we can't protect the Earth,

1522
01:41:05,469 --> 01:41:07,030
you can be damn
well sure we'll avenge it.

1523
01:41:10,482 --> 01:41:12,214
How will your friends have time for me

1524
01:41:13,610 --> 01:41:15,325
when they are so busy fighting you?

1525
01:41:23,004 --> 01:41:23,785
This usually works.

1526
01:41:23,787 --> 01:41:25,398
Well performance issues it's,

1527
01:41:25,919 --> 01:41:27,721
not uncommon.
One out of five...

1528
01:41:30,335 --> 01:41:32,527
Jarvis, anytime now.

1529
01:41:35,007 --> 01:41:37,596
You will all fall before me.

1530
01:41:37,884 --> 01:41:38,872
Deploy!

1531
01:41:39,386 --> 01:41:40,326
Deploy!

1532
01:42:07,847 --> 01:42:10,399
<i>And there is one other person
you pissed off.</i>

1533
01:42:11,877 --> 01:42:13,307
<i>His name was Phil.</i>

1534
01:42:37,110 --> 01:42:37,830
Right.

1535
01:42:38,737 --> 01:42:39,591
Army.

1536
01:43:52,227 --> 01:43:52,990
Loki!

1537
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:55,600
Turn off the Tesseract, or I'll destroy it.

1538
01:43:55,654 --> 01:43:56,659
You can't.

1539
01:43:56,827 --> 01:43:58,350
There is no stopping it.

1540
01:43:59,007 --> 01:44:00,144
There is only...

1541
01:44:00,828 --> 01:44:02,047
the war.

1542
01:44:02,052 --> 01:44:03,136
So be it.

1543
01:44:25,677 --> 01:44:27,513
<i>Stark, we're on your three,
headed northeast.</i>

1544
01:44:27,515 --> 01:44:28,817
What did you stop for drive-through?

1545
01:44:29,264 --> 01:44:31,184
Swing up Park.
I'm going to lay them out for you.

1546
01:44:49,409 --> 01:44:50,956
<i>Sir, we have more incoming.</i>

1547
01:44:50,958 --> 01:44:52,470
Fine.
Let's keep them occupied.

1548
01:44:59,503 --> 01:45:01,046
Nat?
I see him.

1549
01:45:45,673 --> 01:45:47,205
We got to get back up there.

1550
01:46:39,311 --> 01:46:40,729
Stark, are you seeing this?

1551
01:46:41,688 --> 01:46:43,857
<i>Seeing.
Still working on believing.</i>

1552
01:46:44,149 --> 01:46:45,549
Where's Banner?
Has he shown up yet?

1553
01:46:45,650 --> 01:46:46,550
Banner?

1554
01:46:46,818 --> 01:46:47,819
Just keep me posted.

1555
01:46:48,361 --> 01:46:50,225
Jarvis, find me a soft spot.

1556
01:46:53,158 --> 01:46:54,443
Look at this!

1557
01:46:54,826 --> 01:46:56,227
Look around you!

1558
01:46:57,162 --> 01:46:59,782
You think this madness
will end with your rule?

1559
01:47:01,009 --> 01:47:02,225
It's too late.

1560
01:47:04,169 --> 01:47:05,420
It's too late to stop it.

1561
01:47:05,422 --> 01:47:08,706
No. We can, together.

1562
01:47:16,014 --> 01:47:17,172
Sentiment.

1563
01:47:46,002 --> 01:47:47,554
We've got civilians still trapped up here.

1564
01:47:49,255 --> 01:47:50,256
Loki.

1565
01:48:01,851 --> 01:48:03,054
They're fish in a barrel down there.

1566
01:48:09,275 --> 01:48:10,821
We got this.
It's good. Go.

1567
01:48:11,361 --> 01:48:12,570
Do you think you can hold them off?

1568
01:48:12,954 --> 01:48:13,954
Captain,

1569
01:48:15,865 --> 01:48:17,282
it would be my genuine pleasure.

1570
01:48:45,562 --> 01:48:47,322
Just like Budapest all over again.

1571
01:48:47,897 --> 01:48:50,108
You and I remember Budapest
very differently.

1572
01:49:06,583 --> 01:49:07,584
It's going to be an hour

1573
01:49:07,586 --> 01:49:08,963
before they can
scramble the National Guard.

1574
01:49:09,127 --> 01:49:10,362
National Guard?

1575
01:49:11,838 --> 01:49:13,567
Does the army know
what's happening here?

1576
01:49:14,156 --> 01:49:14,684
Do we?

1577
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:17,080
You need men in these buildings.

1578
01:49:17,135 --> 01:49:19,818
There are people inside and they're going
to be running right into the line of fire.

1579
01:49:20,051 --> 01:49:21,970
You take them to the basements
or through the subway.

1580
01:49:22,022 --> 01:49:23,649
You keep them off the streets.

1581
01:49:23,850 --> 01:49:26,237
I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

1582
01:49:26,603 --> 01:49:28,283
Why the hell should
I take orders from you?

1583
01:49:42,327 --> 01:49:43,536
I need men in those buildings.

1584
01:49:43,581 --> 01:49:45,385
Lead the people down and away
from the streets.

1585
01:49:45,830 --> 01:49:48,430
We're going to set up a perimeter
all the way down to 39th Street.

1586
01:49:58,802 --> 01:50:00,478
Well, we got its attention.

1587
01:50:00,674 --> 01:50:01,830
<i>What the hell was step two?</i>

1588
01:50:31,918 --> 01:50:32,961
What's the story upstairs?

1589
01:50:33,044 --> 01:50:35,004
The power surrounding the Cube
is impenetrable.

1590
01:50:35,088 --> 01:50:37,113
<i>Thor's right.
We got to deal with these guys.</i>

1591
01:50:37,677 --> 01:50:39,345
How do we do this?
As a team.

1592
01:50:39,420 --> 01:50:41,041
I have unfinished business with Loki.

1593
01:50:41,448 --> 01:50:43,263
Yeah? Well, get in line.
Save it.

1594
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:46,266
Loki's going to keep this fight focused
on us, and that's what we need.

1595
01:50:46,279 --> 01:50:47,836
Without him, these things could run wild.

1596
01:50:47,963 --> 01:50:49,321
We got Stark up top.

1597
01:50:49,323 --> 01:50:50,436
He's going to need us to...

1598
01:50:58,444 --> 01:50:59,216
So...

1599
01:50:59,874 --> 01:51:02,032
this all seems horrible.

1600
01:51:02,571 --> 01:51:03,697
I've seen worse.

1601
01:51:04,409 --> 01:51:05,366
Sorry.

1602
01:51:05,368 --> 01:51:08,042
No, we could use a little worse.

1603
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:10,591
Stark, we got him.
Banner?

1604
01:51:10,771 --> 01:51:12,064
Just like you said.

1605
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:13,469
Then tell him to suit up.

1606
01:51:13,862 --> 01:51:15,325
I'm bringing the party to you.

1607
01:51:21,384 --> 01:51:23,393
I don't see how that's a party.

1608
01:51:31,527 --> 01:51:32,528
Dr. Banner.

1609
01:51:33,897 --> 01:51:35,977
Now might be a really good
time for you to get angry.

1610
01:51:36,700 --> 01:51:38,395
That's my secret, Cap.

1611
01:51:40,778 --> 01:51:42,113
I'm always angry.

1612
01:51:53,791 --> 01:51:54,999
<i>Hold on!</i>

1613
01:52:25,323 --> 01:52:26,699
Send the rest.

1614
01:52:33,456 --> 01:52:34,351
Guys.

1615
01:52:34,999 --> 01:52:36,153
<i>Call it, Captain.</i>

1616
01:52:36,279 --> 01:52:37,445
Alright, listen up.

1617
01:52:37,669 --> 01:52:39,919
Until we can close that portal,
our priority is containment.

1618
01:52:40,546 --> 01:52:41,874
Barton, I want you on that roof.

1619
01:52:41,876 --> 01:52:43,796
Eyes on everything.
Call out patterns and strays.

1620
01:52:44,008 --> 01:52:45,403
Stark, you got the perimeter.

1621
01:52:45,466 --> 01:52:47,021
Anything gets more
than three blocks out,

1622
01:52:47,023 --> 01:52:48,331
you turn it back or you turn it to ash.

1623
01:52:48,458 --> 01:52:49,254
Can you give me a lift?

1624
01:52:49,256 --> 01:52:51,009
<i>Right. Better clench up, Legolas.</i>

1625
01:52:54,453 --> 01:52:56,776
Thor, you got to try
and bottleneck that portal.

1626
01:52:57,144 --> 01:52:58,271
Slow them down.

1627
01:52:58,273 --> 01:53:00,149
You got the lightning.
Light the bastards up.

1628
01:53:02,750 --> 01:53:04,329
You and me,
we stay here on the ground.

1629
01:53:04,331 --> 01:53:05,207
We keep the fighting here.

1630
01:53:05,854 --> 01:53:06,633
And Hulk...

1631
01:53:09,275 --> 01:53:10,401
Smash.

1632
01:54:03,954 --> 01:54:04,822
Sir.

1633
01:54:06,152 --> 01:54:07,153
The Council is on.

1634
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:12,811
Stark,

1635
01:54:13,286 --> 01:54:15,142
you got a lot of strays sniffing your tail.

1636
01:54:17,021 --> 01:54:19,149
I'm just trying
to keep them off the streets.

1637
01:54:19,354 --> 01:54:20,962
Well, they can't bank worth a damn.

1638
01:54:21,397 --> 01:54:22,813
So find a tight corner.

1639
01:54:22,955 --> 01:54:24,373
I will roger that.

1640
01:54:47,090 --> 01:54:48,439
Oh, boy.

1641
01:54:55,515 --> 01:54:56,583
Nice call.

1642
01:54:57,266 --> 01:54:58,304
What else you got?

1643
01:54:58,601 --> 01:55:00,937
<i>Thor is taking on
a squadron down on Sixth.</i>

1644
01:55:01,521 --> 01:55:03,254
And he didn't invite me.

1645
01:55:43,229 --> 01:55:45,088
Captain, none of this is going
to mean a damn thing

1646
01:55:45,090 --> 01:55:46,182
if we don't close that portal.

1647
01:55:46,357 --> 01:55:47,657
Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

1648
01:55:47,984 --> 01:55:49,477
Well, maybe it's not about guns.

1649
01:55:52,321 --> 01:55:54,225
If you want to get up there,
you're going to need a ride.

1650
01:55:55,319 --> 01:55:56,445
I got a ride.

1651
01:55:57,489 --> 01:55:58,802
I could use a boost, though.

1652
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:02,392
Are you sure about this?

1653
01:56:02,707 --> 01:56:04,696
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

1654
01:56:32,236 --> 01:56:34,282
Ok, turn, turn. Turn!

1655
01:56:34,284 --> 01:56:35,911
Less! Less!

1656
01:57:58,656 --> 01:58:01,398
<i>Captain, the bank on 42nd
past Madison.</i>

1657
01:58:01,625 --> 01:58:03,346
<i>They've cornered
a lot of civilians in there.</i>

1658
01:58:03,613 --> 01:58:04,543
I'm on it.

1659
01:58:25,683 --> 01:58:26,812
Everyone! Clear out!

1660
01:58:57,381 --> 01:58:58,520
<i>Director Fury,</i>

1661
01:58:59,096 --> 01:59:00,639
<i>the Council has made a decision.</i>

1662
01:59:00,739 --> 01:59:03,623
I recognize the Council
has made a decision.

1663
01:59:03,842 --> 01:59:05,679
But given that it's a stupid-ass decision,

1664
01:59:05,681 --> 01:59:07,141
I have elected to ignore it.

1665
01:59:07,143 --> 01:59:10,392
<i>Director, you're closer
than any of our subs.</i>

1666
01:59:10,394 --> 01:59:11,561
<i>You scramble that jet...</i>

1667
01:59:11,562 --> 01:59:14,418
That is the island of Manhattan,
Councilman.

1668
01:59:14,879 --> 01:59:16,776
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,

1669
01:59:16,804 --> 01:59:18,942
I will not order a nuclear strike

1670
01:59:18,944 --> 01:59:20,528
against a civilian population.

1671
01:59:20,529 --> 01:59:22,740
<i>If we don't hold them here,
we lose everything.</i>

1672
01:59:23,074 --> 01:59:25,037
If I send that bird out,
we already have.

1673
01:59:29,580 --> 01:59:30,626
Oh, you.

1674
01:59:33,542 --> 01:59:34,414
Hawkeye!

1675
01:59:35,836 --> 01:59:37,103
Nat, what are you doing?

1676
01:59:38,086 --> 01:59:39,087
A little help?

1677
01:59:44,501 --> 01:59:45,502
I got him.

1678
02:00:11,664 --> 02:00:12,665
Enough!

1679
02:00:13,290 --> 02:00:15,401
You are, all of you, beneath me!

1680
02:00:15,835 --> 02:00:18,371
I am a god, you dull creature.

1681
02:00:18,754 --> 02:00:20,297
And I will not be bullied by...

1682
02:00:29,807 --> 02:00:31,526
Puny god.

1683
02:00:40,067 --> 02:00:41,210
The scepter...

1684
02:00:42,695 --> 02:00:43,988
Doctor.

1685
02:00:45,823 --> 02:00:46,951
Loki's scepter.

1686
02:00:47,367 --> 02:00:48,616
The energy.

1687
02:00:48,784 --> 02:00:50,453
The Tesseract can't fight,

1688
02:00:50,536 --> 02:00:52,427
but you can't protect against yourself.

1689
02:00:52,584 --> 02:00:53,627
It's not your fault.

1690
02:00:53,664 --> 02:00:55,104
You didn't know what you were doing.

1691
02:00:58,052 --> 02:00:59,559
Actually, I think I did.

1692
02:01:00,463 --> 02:01:02,880
I built in a safety
to cut their power source.

1693
02:01:04,592 --> 02:01:05,855
Loki's scepter.

1694
02:01:06,177 --> 02:01:08,222
It may be able to close the portal.

1695
02:01:10,848 --> 02:01:12,434
And I'm looking right at it.

1696
02:01:24,750 --> 02:01:27,836
<i>Sir, we will lose power
before we penetrate that shell.</i>

1697
02:01:35,456 --> 02:01:36,290
Jarvis,

1698
02:01:37,515 --> 02:01:38,917
you ever hear the tale of Jonah?

1699
02:01:38,976 --> 02:01:41,145
<i>I wouldn't consider him
a role model.</i>

1700
02:02:50,865 --> 02:02:52,700
<i>Director Fury is
no longer in command.</i>

1701
02:02:52,783 --> 02:02:54,869
<i>Override order 7-Alpha-1-1.</i>

1702
02:02:54,952 --> 02:02:57,544
<i>7-Alpha-1-1, confirmed.
We're go for takeoff.</i>

1703
02:02:58,455 --> 02:03:00,457
Sir, we have a bird in motion!

1704
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,021
Anyone on the deck,
we have a rogue bird.

1705
02:03:03,127 --> 02:03:04,461
We need to shut it down!

1706
02:03:04,545 --> 02:03:06,639
Repeat, takeoff is not authorized.

1707
02:03:37,328 --> 02:03:38,690
Stark, do you hear me?

1708
02:03:39,622 --> 02:03:41,692
You have a missile
headed straight for the city.

1709
02:03:42,127 --> 02:03:42,991
<i>How long?</i>

1710
02:03:43,792 --> 02:03:45,318
<i>Three minutes, max.</i>

1711
02:03:46,003 --> 02:03:47,463
<i>The payload will wipe out Midtown.</i>

1712
02:03:47,713 --> 02:03:49,711
Jarvis, put everything we got
into the thrusters.

1713
02:03:49,832 --> 02:03:50,893
<i>I just did.</i>

1714
02:04:04,313 --> 02:04:05,689
<i>Package is sent.</i>

1715
02:04:05,780 --> 02:04:08,741
<i>Detonation in 2 minutes,
30 seconds, mark.</i>

1716
02:04:31,799 --> 02:04:33,171
Are you ready for another bout?

1717
02:04:34,778 --> 02:04:36,138
What, are you getting sleepy?

1718
02:04:41,475 --> 02:04:42,768
Right at the crown!

1719
02:04:49,233 --> 02:04:50,501
I can close it.

1720
02:04:51,193 --> 02:04:52,408
Can anybody copy?

1721
02:04:53,028 --> 02:04:54,515
I can shut the portal down.

1722
02:04:54,816 --> 02:04:56,469
Do it!
<i>No, wait.</i>

1723
02:04:56,696 --> 02:04:57,990
Stark, these things are still coming.

1724
02:04:57,992 --> 02:04:59,123
I got a nuke coming in.

1725
02:04:59,125 --> 02:05:00,518
It's gonna blow in less than a minute.

1726
02:05:10,931 --> 02:05:12,599
And I know just where to put it.

1727
02:05:19,754 --> 02:05:22,132
<i>Stark, you know that's a one-way trip.</i>

1728
02:05:22,349 --> 02:05:23,767
Save the rest for the turn, J.

1729
02:05:23,769 --> 02:05:26,724
<i>Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?</i>

1730
02:05:28,105 --> 02:05:29,257
Might as well.

1731
02:05:32,067 --> 02:05:33,110
<i>The streets of New York City</i>

1732
02:05:33,112 --> 02:05:34,405
<i>have become a battleground.</i>

1733
02:05:34,570 --> 02:05:37,130
<i>The Army is here trying
to contain the violence</i>

1734
02:05:37,132 --> 02:05:38,825
<i>but clearly, it is outmatched.</i>

1735
02:05:38,886 --> 02:05:41,222
<i>And I have to say,
in all my years of reporting,</i>

1736
02:05:41,273 --> 02:05:43,761
<i>I have never seen anything like this.</i>

1737
02:05:44,455 --> 02:05:46,213
<i>We have limited
information on the team</i>

1738
02:05:46,219 --> 02:05:49,626
<i>but we do know that billionaire
Tony Stark's Iron Man...</i>

1739
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:04,620
Come on, Stark.

1740
02:07:11,416 --> 02:07:12,584
Close it.

1741
02:07:32,765 --> 02:07:33,865
Son of a gun.

1742
02:07:38,569 --> 02:07:39,994
He's not slowing down.

1743
02:07:58,255 --> 02:07:59,548
Is he breathing?

1744
02:08:27,618 --> 02:08:28,827
What the hell?

1745
02:08:31,692 --> 02:08:32,739
What just happened?

1746
02:08:33,798 --> 02:08:35,128
Please tell me nobody kissed me.

1747
02:08:40,547 --> 02:08:41,446
We won.

1748
02:08:44,551 --> 02:08:45,686
Alright, yay!

1749
02:08:45,969 --> 02:08:47,610
Hurray. Good job, guys.

1750
02:08:48,096 --> 02:08:49,564
Let's just not come in tomorrow.

1751
02:08:49,566 --> 02:08:51,275
Let's just take a day.

1752
02:08:52,215 --> 02:08:53,482
Have you ever tried shawarma?

1753
02:08:54,222 --> 02:08:56,349
There's a shawarma joint
about two blocks from here.

1754
02:08:56,581 --> 02:08:58,282
I don't know what it is, but I want to try it.

1755
02:08:58,649 --> 02:08:59,983
We're not finished yet.

1756
02:09:05,072 --> 02:09:06,391
And then shawarma after.

1757
02:09:28,845 --> 02:09:30,274
If it's all the same to you,

1758
02:09:34,260 --> 02:09:35,716
I'll have that drink now.

1759
02:09:43,986 --> 02:09:46,112
<i>Despite the devastation of
what has been confirmed</i>

1760
02:09:46,113 --> 02:09:47,906
<i>as an extraterrestrial attack,</i>

1761
02:09:47,908 --> 02:09:49,519
<i>the extraordinary heroics</i>

1762
02:09:49,521 --> 02:09:51,481
<i>of the group known as the Avengers</i>

1763
02:09:51,483 --> 02:09:53,368
<i>has been to many a cause
not only for comfort,</i>

1764
02:09:53,370 --> 02:09:54,494
<i>but for celebration.</i>

1765
02:09:54,496 --> 02:09:56,079
<i>It's just really great knowing
they're out there.</i>

1766
02:09:57,040 --> 02:09:58,655
<i>That someone is watching over us.</i>

1767
02:09:59,001 --> 02:10:00,252
<i>I love you, Thor!</i>

1768
02:10:00,335 --> 02:10:01,876
<i>And then these guys were like...</i>

1769
02:10:02,170 --> 02:10:03,368
<i>And then the air goes...</i>

1770
02:10:03,588 --> 02:10:05,007
<i>And this green guy walks up
and he goes...</i>

1771
02:10:05,090 --> 02:10:06,174
<i>I don't know.</i>

1772
02:10:06,258 --> 02:10:08,672
<i>I don't exactly feel safer
with those things out there.</i>

1773
02:10:08,885 --> 02:10:11,627
<i>It just seems that there is
a lot they're not telling us.</i>

1774
02:10:12,008 --> 02:10:15,416
<i>Superheroes in New York?
Give me a break.</i>

1775
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:17,561
<i>These so-called heroes</i>

1776
02:10:17,644 --> 02:10:20,828
<i>have to be held responsible
for the destruction done to this city.</i>

1777
02:10:21,273 --> 02:10:23,688
<i>This was their fight.
Where are they now?</i>

1778
02:10:23,690 --> 02:10:26,486
<i>Tough questions are being asked
about the Avengers themselves.</i>

1779
02:10:26,570 --> 02:10:29,156
<i>Their sudden appearance
and equally sudden disappearance...</i>

1780
02:10:29,239 --> 02:10:31,480
<i>What, this is all somehow their fault?</i>

1781
02:10:34,077 --> 02:10:36,533
<i>Captain America saved my life.</i>

1782
02:10:39,374 --> 02:10:40,795
<i>Wherever he is...</i>

1783
02:10:41,314 --> 02:10:43,990
<i>and wherever any of them are,
I would just...</i>

1784
02:10:45,255 --> 02:10:47,291
<i>I would want to say thank you.</i>

1785
02:10:50,052 --> 02:10:51,439
<i>Where are the Avengers?</i>

1786
02:10:51,654 --> 02:10:53,823
I'm not currently tracking
their whereabouts.

1787
02:10:54,181 --> 02:10:56,391
I'd say they've earned a leave of absence.

1788
02:10:56,405 --> 02:10:57,651
<i>And the Tesseract?</i>

1789
02:10:58,185 --> 02:11:00,017
The Tesseract is where it belongs.

1790
02:11:00,896 --> 02:11:02,698
Out of our reach.

1791
02:11:03,349 --> 02:11:04,767
<i>That's not your call.</i>

1792
02:11:04,983 --> 02:11:06,026
I didn't make it.

1793
02:11:06,151 --> 02:11:08,349
I just didn't argue with the god that did.

1794
02:11:08,528 --> 02:11:10,356
<i>So, you let him take it</i>

1795
02:11:10,447 --> 02:11:12,115
<i>and the war criminal, Loki,</i>

1796
02:11:12,117 --> 02:11:13,910
<i>who should be
answering for his crime.</i>

1797
02:11:13,935 --> 02:11:16,270
Oh, I think he will be.

1798
02:11:30,133 --> 02:11:32,613
<i>I don't think you understand
what you've started,</i>

1799
02:11:32,886 --> 02:11:35,180
<i>letting the Avengers
loose on this world.</i>

1800
02:11:35,597 --> 02:11:36,856
<i>They're dangerous.</i>

1801
02:11:37,015 --> 02:11:38,427
They surely are,

1802
02:11:38,429 --> 02:11:40,520
and the whole world knows it.

1803
02:11:41,228 --> 02:11:43,563
Every world knows it.

1804
02:11:44,231 --> 02:11:46,022
<i>Was that the point of all this?</i>

1805
02:11:46,483 --> 02:11:48,026
<i>A statement?</i>

1806
02:11:50,904 --> 02:11:52,215
<i>A promise.</i>

1807
02:12:00,973 --> 02:12:02,558
Sir, how does it work now?

1808
02:12:03,750 --> 02:12:05,444
They've gone their separate ways.

1809
02:12:05,783 --> 02:12:08,245
Some, pretty extremely far.

1810
02:12:09,548 --> 02:12:12,669
If we get into a situation like this again,
what happens then?

1811
02:12:13,199 --> 02:12:14,242
They'll come back.

1812
02:12:15,762 --> 02:12:17,033
Are you really sure about that?

1813
02:12:17,566 --> 02:12:18,567
I am.

1814
02:12:20,139 --> 02:12:21,261
Why?

1815
02:12:22,519 --> 02:12:24,296
Because we'll need them to.

1816
02:13:10,497 --> 02:13:13,329

1817
02:15:16,276 --> 02:15:18,404
Humans.

1818
02:15:20,030 --> 02:15:24,193
They are not the cowering
wretches we were promised.

1819
02:15:25,368 --> 02:15:27,137
They stand.

1820
02:15:28,371 --> 02:15:30,331
They are unruly,

1821
02:15:30,333 --> 02:15:33,586
and therefore cannot be ruled.

1822
02:15:41,801 --> 02:15:44,207
To challenge them...

1823
02:15:44,804 --> 02:15:48,183
is to court death.
