{\an8}I cannot thank you enough for
coming on board, Alex.

12
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:55,055
{\an8}Well, then it is a good thing
you're paying me also.

{\an8}-Sorry for the wait.
-Ollie, this is Alex Davis,

14
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,394
{\an8}the new political strategist
that Walter recommended.

15
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,063
{\an8}Old enough to vote, Alex?

16
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,773
{\an8}I owned a bar and I wasn't even
old enough to drink.

17

{\an8}I'm old enough to do both.

{\an8}Well, I'm glad that you're
joining the team,

19
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,323
but I don't entirely know why I need
a political strategist.

20
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:17,202
Well, I guess the question then is,
do you want to take office

21

with 10% of the vote or 90?

to be able to govern.

{\an8}No. We can spin that.

25
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:27,003
{\an8}No, I'm talking about the kind of
closet skeletons

{\an8}that could cripple you on your first day
in office. Your personal Chappaquiddick.

Wait, like that game from <i>Harry Potter?</i>

28
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:38,348
Um, Chappaquiddick was a scandal
involving a can't-lose candidate

29
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:41,184
{\an8}whose campaign fell apart
when he was caught having an affair

and the girl he was with drowned.

{\an8}Alex. All due respect,

38
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:03,623
{\an8}I don't think that people care about my
friendship with Laurel Lance

39
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,919
{\an8}and an eight-year-old scandal
when this city is disintegrating

40

{\an8}and there are masked,
armed men helping it.

{\an8}Not to mention there's a woman
in Pennytown

42

{\an8}that's just running around killing people.

{\an8}You're right. I'm sorry.

44
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,473
For a moment, I forgot how the electorate
always cares about the issues

45
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,350
and has zero appetite for scandal.

46
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,062
You want this city united?

47

You can't do it as the rich-kid playboy
from the tabloids.

{\an8}And like it or not, Laurel Lance
is a constant reminder of that.

49
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,363
So from this day forward,
when anyone brings up Ms. Lance,

50
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,073
you distance yourself from her.

Suddenly, two guys find landmines,

65
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,202
{\an8}and a bunch of drugs go missing.

66
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,874
{\an8}Yeah. Conklin, you got me. I didn't wash
up on shore here after a boating accident.

67
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,877
{\an8}I parachuted in on a secret spy mission.

68

{\an8}-You wanna die a liar, that's fine by me.
-That's enough.

{\an8}Enough! There are more pressing
matters at hand.

70

{\an8}Perhaps if you were focused more on
external threats rather than witch hunts,

71
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,306
{\an8}you would've caught this man spying on us
in the fields.

72
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,475
Oh, I wasn't spying, mate.

Any of you squabblers got a cigarette?

It sounded, I don't know, Middle Eastern.

{\an8}All right, um, we're gonna have you
sit down with a sketch artist, okay?

-Hey.

79
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,087
You tell me. These two bodies
dropped by a woman.

80
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,173
Probably the same woman
that's been linked to the murders

81

of three other skels in the past few days.
A blonde woman.

Dad, I...

83
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:22,720
I didn't know what to make of it
till tonight. And then,

84
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:23,888
this woman, here, she says her suspect

85
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,265
speaks some kind
of Middle Eastern language,

86
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,849
just like Sara.

87
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,726
Is she still at your place?

88
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,437
I've been looking for her.

89
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,480
Why didn't you tell me, huh?
Did you tell Queen?

90
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,983
No. Because he would just see this
the same way as you.

91
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,027
Yeah, and how is that, huh? How is that?

92
00:04:38,235 --> 00:04:42,449
That Sara is just a thing that
needs to be stopped.

93
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,866
This is my daughter.

94
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,869
Then why did I find you with
a gun pointed at her head?

95
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:50,081
I'm not proud of that, Laurel,
but people are dying.

96
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,336
And if I'd pulled that trigger,
maybe they wouldn't be.

97
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:58,005
I'm gonna go find Sara, and hopefully I do
before you or Oliver.

98
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,846
Curtis, I need you to do something for me.

99
00:05:05,012 --> 00:05:07,515
{\an8}Felicity, look at me.
Gym clothes, gym bag.

100
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,017
{\an8}Do either of those suggest anything
to you?

101
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,729
{\an8}Physical fitness. But then I remembered
you're a tech guy.

102
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,481
I'm also a bronze medal decathlete.

103

00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,611
Beijing. As in the Olympics?

106
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,407
Mr. Palmer's recording. Did you play it?

107
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,493
Yes, there's something off about it.

108
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,704
You sure it's not the fact that
it's a dying declaration from your ex?

109
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:33,750
I mean, that is some serious
Nicholas-Sparks-level stuff.

110
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,544
{\an8}Don't judge. Man can write emotion.

111
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,004
{\an8}No, not that. I mean, yes, there's that,

112
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,798
{\an8}but there's still some artifacts playing
that shouldn't be there.

113
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:45,512
{\an8}What about your workout?

114
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,514
{\an8}Didn't seem to concern you 20 seconds ago.

this is my fault. I, I got...</i>

116

You hear that?

117
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,609
Like there's more to the recording.
Something overlapping with it.

118
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,820
{\an8}I was hoping you could clean it up for me.
I mean, after your workout.

119
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,947
{\an8}It can wait.
I'm glad you changed your mind

120
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,866
{\an8}about hearing Mr. Palmer's final words.

121
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,200
Thank you, Curtis.

122
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,581
Oh, thank you for coming.

123
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,792
Well, I think we both know I didn't
have too much choice.

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,628
No. Well, certainly not since you
literally doubled the number of daughters

125
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,046
I have to hold over you.

126
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:22,381
Or did you take my advice
and return Sara to the grave?

127
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,468
You didn't take my advice. Pity.

128
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,928
What do you want?

129
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,138
Oh. A new beginning for the world,
a nice glass of merlot.

130
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:31,474
Not necessarily in that order. Oh!

131
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:35,227
And for you to do me a favor.

132
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,106
There's a federal server farm
30 miles outside of the city.

133
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,318
I want you to gain access and plug this
little baby into one of the computers.

134
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,072
How much this thing gonna do?

135
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:47,740
Oh, it's of no concern of yours.

136
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,578
But don't worry, it's not like it's gonna
destroy the city or anything.

137
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,250
Whatever that spa weekend did to
clear your head,

138
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,211
it also improved your technique.

139
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,505
You're effortless.

140
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:08,302
Yeah, well, you know how I love
my hot stone massages.

141
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:11,055
By the way, that political strategist
was a good call.

142
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:15,602
But his advice was a little harsh.
I mean, distancing yourself from Laurel?

143
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,604
I wasn't expecting that,
but he made a few good points.

144
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,355
What? Like kicking your friends
to the curb?

145
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,399
Well, my friendship with Laurel
is complicated.

146
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,277
We have been in each other's lives for,
like, forever.

147
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,448
I mean, you have been in love with
Laurel and Sara.

148
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:33,786
And Laurel, she... She took me in at CNRI
when I was completely lost.

149
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:37,790
Even Captain Lance, okay? He has been
there for us since Mom died.

My point is that pretending that you

that grief again.

00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,164
Malcolm...(CLEARS THROAT)

309
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:43,044
Malcolm served them up
on a platter for me and

310
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,588
helped keep my bloodlust at bay.

311
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,011
Oh, my God! Thank God you're all right.

312
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,387
Laurel, come with me.

313
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,725
Is Thea okay?

314
00:17:04,856 --> 00:17:06,067
No.

315
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,444
Not only is Thea hospitalized,

316
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:12,239
but she has Merlyn influencing her
to kill people.

317
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,615
What are you talking about?

318
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,993
Oh, just another thing that happened on
your secret trip to Nanda Parbat.

319
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,247
Hey, I didn't tell you that I took
my sister to Nanda Parbat

320
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,208
because I knew that you wouldn't approve.

321
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,543
Why didn't you tell me you took Thea?

322
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,214
-What does that have to do with anything?
-It's the hypocrisy that I can't stand.

323
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,468
What? It's okay for you to do whatever
you have to for your sister,

324
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,553
but it's not okay for me to do
the same to mine.

325
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,973
Sara was dead. Thea wasn't.

326
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,310
Then why didn't you tell me about Thea
seven months ago?

327
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,479
(HAND THUDS)

328
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,231
(SCOFFS)

329
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,359
Because you don't see me as an equal.

330
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,945
Oh, come on. Laurel, of course,
I see you as an equal.

331
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,740
No, you don't. You never have.

332
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:58,160
-You never told me you were the Arrow.
-Keep your voice down.

333
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,786
You never supported me becoming
the Black Canary.

334
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:03,832
And you never would've told me that
there's a way to save my sister.

335
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,086
My sister, she's out of her mind
right now

336
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:11,298
because of something that I did,
a decision that I made.

337
00:18:12,924 --> 00:18:15,802
Did you ever just stop and think
for one second

338
00:18:16,052 --> 00:18:17,471
about what I might be going through?

339
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:23,059
I'm sorry about what happened to Thea.

340
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,398
I really am. I love your family,
I always have.

341
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,444
I just wish that sometimes you would
give a damn about mine.

342
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,411
Get out.

343
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,999
You sure this is the place?

344
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,128
It's the place.
What's going on? Who are you?

345
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,714
How much do you know about what your boss
is really doing on this island, eh?

346
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:53,924
Making drugs.

347
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:58,470
(CHUCKLES) If only. Your friend Reiter,
he's the dangerous sort.

348
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,680
What's that supposed to mean?

349
00:18:59,846 --> 00:19:02,766
It means there are things on this island
that bad people shouldn't have access to.

350
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,101
Says the guy with a gun pointed
at my head.

351
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,270
Ah.

352
00:19:06,978 --> 00:19:10,982
I'm not a bad guy.
A little hardscrabble sure, but, uh,

353
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,236
I'm on the side of the angels, mate,

354
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:17,406
at least when they're not busy trying to
screw me over.

355
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,366
You're right. This is the spot.

Go on then, Alice.
Down the rabbit hole you go.

QUENTIN: Nice job getting us in.

362
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,038
You learn how to do that
before or after working with Queen?

363
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,665
I'll save that for another story.

364
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:09,958
Yeah, I bet.

365
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,338
-Is this the access point?
-Yeah. Yeah, it looks like it.

366
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,714
All right.
Keep an eye out for rent-a-cops.

367
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,633
This wouldn't do my career prospects
too much good.

00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,804
It working?

369
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:26,225
Yeah, I think so. Looks like the virus
is erasing files on people.

Both really good questions.

00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,781
What are you doing here?

Waiting for you to wake up.

377
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,578
Thea, I owe you an apology.

378
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:51,207
No, no. There's no need for you
to apologize for anything.

379
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:56,963
Yes, I do. I brought Sara back without any
idea of how to control her.

380
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,131
(SIGHS)

381
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:01,593
And I'm the one who killed her
in the first place.

382
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,349
That's why she's after me, you know.

383
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:10,101
This bloodlust she's consumed by.

384
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:15,023
It's the same pain I feel
when I think about Ra's.

I don't understand.

386
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:21,071
Because the person that I'm driven
to kill,

387
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,617
the one who killed me, is already dead.

388
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,619
Thea, what're you talking about?

389
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:31,373
She kills me, she'll be okay.

390
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:36,587
If the only way to save Sara is to
kill you, then that's no cure at all.

-Two minutes.

It brought Sara's body back,
but all this is happening...

433

Because it didn't restore her soul.

with Laurel,

and she knew exactly which hospital room
to look for you in.

Thea somehow?

of connection, a connection we can use.

One of those names,
Sergeant Andrew Diggle.

467
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,154
What is he to you?

468
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:17,618
He died six years ago. Why are you erasing
the record of a dead man?

469
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:19,786
You know what? I'm gonna tell you.

00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:23,123
And only because you completed your task
with such efficiency.

We hired an assassin to murder
Sergeant Diggle.

Why?

473
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:31,923
Afghanistan's an interesting place,
replete with opportunities

474
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,259
for an enterprising enlisted man
to engage in.

Your Sergeant Diggle was an eager beaver.

Unfortunately for him, our organization
weaved itself into that part of the world,

00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,311
and as you know, we don't play well
with others.

479
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:46,980

No, an exorcism is a removal of

Goons like Reiter, they're only interested
in the sparkly bits, anyway.

620
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:38,654
The real power is in the spell.
Here. Here. I'll show you.

621
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,869
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

622
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,628
Lift up your shirt, mate.

623
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,671
What?

624
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:00,426
(CONTINUES SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

625
00:37:05,931 --> 00:37:07,850
What the hell did you just do?

626
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:09,935
I gave you some insurance against Reiter.

627
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:15,024
And when the time comes,
you'll know how to use it.

628
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,777
Now, I believe that concludes
our business.

629
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,364
Uh...

630
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,534
I, I need you to punch me in the face.

631
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:29,289
Right. My escape attempt
left a bruise, right?

632
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,750
All right. I must warn you,
I've got a hell of a right hook.

633
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:34,752
(GRUNTS)

634
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,589
I'm... I'm fine. Thanks very much.

635
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:42,802
All right, so just stay on message.
Unity, united community.

636
00:37:42,968 --> 00:37:45,012
-United. Got it.
-All right.

637
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,764
Hey! Laurel.

638
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,559
Okay. Maybe we need to work on your
understanding

639
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,143
of the phrase "distance yourself."

640
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:54,480
Only if you insist on continuing to use it
when it relates to my friends.

641
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,482
(SIGHS) Okay.

642
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:57,942
(SCOFFS)

643
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:02,154
It's your campaign.
You pay me whether you win or lose.

644
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:11,456
I am gonna go keep him from quitting,
but I'm very proud of you right now.

645
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,629
How's Sara?

646
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,465
Resting.

647
00:38:21,131 --> 00:38:24,552
It turns out that getting your soul back
is exhausting.

648
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:25,803
Yeah.

649
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:30,683
Ollie, I don't know how I'm ever
gonna be able to thank you.

650
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:32,768
Just like that.

651
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:33,936
(CHUCKLES)

652
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,521
Well, thank you.

653
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:39,775
And thank you for inviting me
here tonight.

654
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,110
After what I said to you in the hospital,

655
00:38:41,276 --> 00:38:43,278
I thought that I'd be the last person
you'd wanna see.

656
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:47,533
Well, you were right. I haven't always
been the best friend for you.

657
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:52,997
But I'd be grateful for the opportunity
to try and start to be.

658
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:54,499
(LAUGHS)

659
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,669
How can I say no to the man that helped me
save my sister's soul?

660
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,129
Yeah.

661
00:39:04,049 --> 00:39:05,343
OLIVER: (ON TV) <i>I've made mistakes,</i>

662
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,844
<i>mistakes that have
hurt people close to me.</i>

663
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,846
<i>But I'm not here to run from the past</i>

664
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,849
<i>because the past has contributed
to making...</i>

665
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,103
I thought you'd be out celebrating
with Sara.

666
00:39:16,311 --> 00:39:17,897
Yeah. There's enough time for that.

667
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:20,858
-Please.
-I figured I owed you something.

668
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:27,782
I asked Darhk about your brother.
He, uh, gave me something.

669
00:39:29,074 --> 00:39:30,075
(SIGHS)

670
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,495
You don't have to read this.

671
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,540
You can remember your brother
how you knew him.

672
00:39:58,103 --> 00:40:00,105
Are you sure about this?

673
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,816
Yeah. It's legit.

674
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,109
I'm very sorry.

675
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,448
Thank you, Detective.

676
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:11,366
Gut punch doesn't deserve a thank you.

677
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,411
I wanted to know why

678
00:40:15,245 --> 00:40:18,040
HIVE had my brother killed,
and now I do, so...

679
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,295
(EXHALES)

680
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:31,887
(DOOR OPENS)

681
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:34,389
Felicity! Welcome back!
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

682
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,558
How many of these have you drank?

683
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:38,102
It's "drunk," actually, and many.
But worth it.

684
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,104
You cleared up the rest of Ray's message?

685
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,106
I think so. Uh, the playback was rendering
when you came in.

686
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:43,608
So, propitious timing. (CHUCKLES)

687
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,611
You're not even allowed to say "energy
drink" while on company time ever again.

688
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,279
That's okay. I think I might be having
a cardiac incident, anyway.

689
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,948
So, check out the message.
I was just about to call you.

690
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,492
Wait, where's my phone.
Wait, did I call you already?

691
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,326
-Curtis!
-Wait.

692
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,622
RAY: <i>I'm sorry, Felicity,
this is my fault.</i>

693
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:02,918
<i>I, I got myself into this mess screwing
around with my exosuit and nanotechnology.</i>

694
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,965
<i>But recriminations probably aren't the
best use of this limited bandwidth.</i>

695
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:13,929
<i>What I need you to know is
I'm alive and I'm in trouble.</i>
