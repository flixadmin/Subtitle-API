1
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:28,414
Lights out!

2
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,460
Cletus. Are you there?

3
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,962
My angel.

4
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,386
This is for you.

5
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,219
What did the doctor say?

6
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,187
He said the mutations are advancing.

7
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,515
My powers are too strong.

8
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,646
Cletus, I'm scared.

9
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,523
It's gonna be okay.

10
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,651
They're coming to take me away.

11
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:01,403
They're sending me to a place
where there are others like me.

12
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,078
They can't do that.

13
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,164
They can't take you from me.
You're my one bright light.

14
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,871
I will always love you!

15
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,835
Frances!

16
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,293
Get off!

17
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,177
Frances!

18
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,059
No!

19
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,395
No!

20
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,283
Any last words?

21
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,618
Welcome to your new home, Frances.

22
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,612
Your old boyfriend's
finally getting what he deserves.

23
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,908
And the world
will be a safer place without him.

24
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,026
<i>Detective Mulligan,
with all due respect,</i>

25
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,282
<i>I don't want anything
to do with Cletus Kasady.</i>

26
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:34,081
<i>Well, that's too bad,
because he only wants to see you.</i>

27
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,705
In my opinion, you had
your chance with Kasady and you blew it.

28
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,463
Right. Um, so, what does he want?

29
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,759
Maybe he wants to spill the beans
about where the missing bodies are buried.

30
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,429
So you're gonna have to do
the right thing for a change.

31
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,516
Hmm.

32
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:59,057
No!
Take your tiny hands off of me!

33
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,360
We should be out there,
protecting the city. Lethally!

34
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,158
What was that?

35
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,531
Unhand me!

36
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:17,242
Man should never consent to crawl
when he has the impulse to fly.

37
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,953
You are a bottom-feeder.

38
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,583
Be quiet.

39
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,257
How many times have I told you

40
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:30,212
that I want you to hide yourself
when I am working?

41
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:33,800
I am serious. It is important.
You have to show me respect.

42
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,760
- Respect? Respect?
- Yes! Yes.

43
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,060
- Okay.
- Okay.

44
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,559
- Kasady gonna give you the scoop, right?
- Right.

45
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,730
- Wrong.
- What do you mean?

46
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,649
Because you blow everything.

47
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,945
Ah, okay, I see.
You're talking about Anne again.

48
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,146
I miss her!

49
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,614
- I will do it.
- I don't like you.

50
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:54,705
<i>Let me eat him!</i>

51
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:59,033
You do not deserve nice things.

52
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,085
Hmm.

53
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,470
<i>Welcome back, Eddie Brock.</i>

54
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,975
I've been thinking about you.

55
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:23,224
What do you want, Cletus?
I mean, why am I here?

56
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:30,114
Do a man who's buried alive
a kindness, won't you?

57
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,692
Get a message out to all my...

58
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,870
fans.

59
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,617
And in return,

60
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,958
- I'll give you my life...
- What?

61
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,284
Story.

62
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,749
I heard the written word
hasn't been working out so well.

63
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:52,052
Piece like this, an exclusive...

64
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,967
would put you back on top.

65
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,471
Go on.

66
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,892
People love...

67
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,809
serial killers.

68
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,976
All my secrets

69
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,732
laid bare, Eddie.

70
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,903
So much carnage.

71
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
But why me?

72
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,196
I like you.

73
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,082
All right, it's a deal.

74
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,585
What's your message?

75
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,707
"That distant cathedral...

76
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,755
- is all I see...
- Mm-hm.

77
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,088
<i>Fractured angel...</i>

78
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,721
<i>the other part of me."</i>

79
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,058
Print that in your column.

80
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,108
Is that it? This, um...
Who's gonna read that?

81
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,731
Some random haiku?

82
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,729
Print it...

83
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,273
and what's mine...

84
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,446
is yours.

85
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,740
Wow, lucky me.

86
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,537
Goodbye, Eddie.

87
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,459
Thank you.

88
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,325
Thank you.

89
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,165
<i>What a dick.</i>

90
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,372
<i>Eddie, look.</i>

91
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,502
<i>Look.</i>

92
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,836
- What are you doing?
<i>- Your job for you.</i>

93
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,601
Eddie.

94
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,103
Don't forget me, Eddie.

95
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,530
What did you get?

96
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,739
<i>Uh, I got a headache
and probably got tuberculosis.</i>

97
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,243
What? A little louder.

98
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,200
He read me poetry, man.

99
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,744
Is this some kind
of joke to you, Eddie?

100
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,124
Because I'm not laughing.

101
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,172
<i>Yeah, you could do with a laugh.</i>

102
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:56,297
Come on, man. These things,
they just take a little time. All right?

103
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,616
- The second he gives you something...
- Of course.

104
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,553
Keep me ahead of the curve, Eddie.
Don't embarrass me!

105
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,120
Do you understand?

106
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:07,559
Trust me. The only scoop I'm
getting today is double chocolate chip.

107
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,357
<i>No! I get brain freeze.</i>

108
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,405
<i>Come here.</i>

109
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,398
<i>- Look.</i>
- I'm looking.

110
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,493
<i>Grab those.</i>

111
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,366
All right.

112
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,165
Whoa.

113
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:28,252
Okay.

114
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,213
<i>Now, what do you think?</i>

115
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,791
- I think I'm Pablo Picasso.
<i>- No!</i>

116
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,220
- Okay.
<i>- Come here. Look.</i>

117
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,555
<i>Well, say what you see.</i>

118
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,101
- Uh, it's a house.
<i>- Never mind.</i>

119
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,362
Oh, I know this one! It's a tree!

120
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,485
<i>Idiot! Sit down.</i>

121
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,161
<i>Now...</i>

122
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,236
<i>pay attention.</i>

123
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:28,802
<i>Bingo.</i>

124
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,763
Holy cow.

125
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,696
Would you say
your friendship with Cletus Kasady

126
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,365
is what allowed you
to solve this decades-old mystery?

127
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:45,615
You are the only person
from the outside world he's spoken with.

128
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,705
Seems he likes you.

129
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:50,373
Well, you know, he's a serial killer.
I don't see how he can like anyone.

130
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,624
<i>Brock was able to uncover
what the FBI and police could not.</i>

131
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,797
<i>Bowing to public outrage,</i>

132
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:01,002
<i>the governor of California
has overturned his moratorium</i>

133
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,257
<i>and reinstated
the death penalty for Kasady.</i>

134
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,305
<i>Brock's career's been given
a much-needed revival,</i>

135
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,184
<i>putting him back on top once more.</i>

136
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,246
<i>A harrowing story finally comes to an end.</i>

137
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:36,203
<i>Vindication for the victims
and closure for the families,</i>

138
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,789
<i>thanks to the diligence of one man.</i>

139
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,169
<i>Thank you, Eddie Brock.</i>

140
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,091
And Venom!

141
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,636
You know, this could be us, Eddie.

142
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,555
Going out there, solving cases.

143
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:51,351
Fighting bad guys. Maybe I eat them, hmm?

144
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,678
And then we save the day.

145
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,889
<i>But we saved the day. It's done.</i>

146
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:01,187
You said I could eat bad guys!

147
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,487
<i>This again?</i>

148
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,234
I need to be free!

149
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:08,865
Feeling the wind in my hair
and the sand between my toes.

150
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,195
<i>You don't have any hair.</i>

151
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,122
You are not listening to me.

152
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,664
<i>Oh, I'm listening.</i>

153
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,459
I cannot live like this anymore!

154
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,036
I'm starving!

155
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,246
<i>So eat those guys.</i>

156
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,922
I can't.

157
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,216
Sonny and Cher are best friends.

158
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,590
<i>Are you serious?
That's ridiculous. That's what...</i>

159
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,888
Man, that was abusive.

160
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,219
That was abuse.

161
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,438
And that's a $2000 TV.

162
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,516
You have got to get control
of your aggression.

163
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,021
That is why we have Snookie!

164
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:44,946
<i>I cannot live on chicken
and chocolate alone. I need brains!</i>

165
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,398
Chickens have brains.

166
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,608
<i>I most passionately disagree.</i>

167
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,704
<i>Look. Look at those poor idiots.</i>

168
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,161
<i>Small brains.</i>

169
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,584
Come on, man,
it's not their fault that you, uh...

170
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,912
You live on the old phenylethyla...
Laphenylethylan...

171
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,044
<i>- Phenylethylalanine.</i>
- Yeah, I just said that.

172
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,091
<i>I've told you a thousand times,</i>

173
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,385
<i>- because it is only found in brains...</i>
- Yeah?

174
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,949
<i>- And in chocolate.</i>
- And chocolate.

175
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,964
That's right.
All right. Well, how about this?

176
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:14,393
You live in my body, you live by my rules.

177
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,479
<i>I live in your body</i>

178
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,606
<i>because, unfortunately,
I don't have many options.</i>

179
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,770
Well, how about this, son?

180
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,727
The FBI is still investigating us

181
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,438
for all of that stuff
that "we were involved with."

182
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,990
So if one more head goes missing,

183
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:32,195
we will get hauled off into Area 51.

184
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:36,532
They will kill us both.
So somebody has to be responsible.

185
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,412
<i>Responsibility.</i>

186
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,877
<i>It's for the mediocre.</i>

187
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,298
<i>- Food!</i>
- Can you stop doing that?

188
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,343
<i>- Food!</i>
- Please just stop doing that.

189
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,046
Come on, stop doing that!
I have a deadline! Will you stop it?

190
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,006
Goddamn it! Fine!

191
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,362
- Good evening, Eddie.
- Hey, Mrs. Chen.

192
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,442
Good evening, Venom.

193
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,860
- He says hi. Oh.
- Chocolate hasn't arrived yet.

194
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:09,030
- <i>No!</i>
- Oh, no. We have a deal.

195
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,905
What's gonna happen?
You gonna stop protecting me?

196
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,109
I don't think so.

197
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:16,162
I've been keeping my mouth shut,
feeding your little secret.

198
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,249
Wow.

199
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,995
Little old Mrs. Chen
is a little old blackmailer, huh?

200
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,623
Less of the old. I am 39.

201
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,080
- <i>And I am Barry Manilow.</i>
- Right.

202
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,960
<i>I am happy to eat Mrs. Chen.</i>

203
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,713
No, no, you cannot eat Mrs. Chen.

204
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:30,919
What?

205
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,675
Well, I guess
it's gonna have to be plan B.

206
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,642
What's plan B?

207
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,935
Not this again!

208
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:43,185
I need human brains to survive.

209
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,610
<i>Uh-uh.
Now, pick up some chickens, man. Let's go.</i>

210
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,334
I'm done with this grossness.

211
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,633
Look at all the amazing things
that we can do!

212
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,010
We are wasting our talent.

213
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,395
Bad guy!

214
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,817
Hello, kitty!

215
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,820
<i>Leave him. Leave him be.
Leave him be! Leave him be!</i>

216
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,074
- I shall remove your head.
<i>- No, you won't.</i>

217
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,535
- I will use it for bowling!
<i>- No, you will not!</i>

218
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,370
I will take it to...

219
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,375
What is the one that we like, Eddie?

220
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,506
<i>It's Lucky Strike.</i>

221
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,836
- Yes!
<i>- Put him down.</i>

222
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,669
Lucky Strike.
I will take you to Lucky Strike.

223
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,175
- And I will score a 300-point game.
<i>- You won't.</i>

224
00:16:56,265 --> 00:17:00,509
The rest of your pudgy little boy body
will be left here,

225
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,935
rolling around in dumpster juice.

226
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,854
<i>Oh, God.</i>

227
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,356
<i>No! Put him down!</i>

228
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:11,778
<i>No, no, no! No! No!</i>

229
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,525
Fine!

230
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,279
<i>She didn't want our help.</i>

231
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,453
She did not know
she needed our help, Eddie.

232
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,871
There is a difference.

233
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,496
<i>It is Anne!
Anne is on the phone, Eddie!</i>

234
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,212
- Hey, Anne.
<i>- Hey, Eddie. Hi.</i>

235
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,343
- Hi.
<i>- Be nice to her.</i>

236
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,175
You sound out of breath.
I'm not catching you at a bad time, am I?

237
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,477
No, no, not at all. I'm just, uh...

238
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,430
- I'm just hanging around.
<i>- Okay.</i>

239
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:51,393
Uh, I'm sorry I haven't returned
your calls. I guess...

240
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,946
I just needed a little space
after the whole...

241
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,691
alien-biting-a-guy's-head-off thing, so...

242
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,776
<i>Ah, the good old days.</i>

243
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,363
<i>Anyway, so I have some news,
and I was wondering if we could meet?</i>

244
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,698
- <i>Yes!</i>
- Yeah, sure, that would be, uh...

245
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,625
<i>That would be fine. Great.</i>

246
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,125
- Okay, great. How's tomorrow night?
<i>- Tomorrow night?</i>

247
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,957
- Yeah. Great.
<i>- Eight o'clock?</i>

248
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,404
- L'Araignée?
<i>- Okay, great.</i>

249
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,544
- Looking forward to it.
- Okay, me too. Bye.

250
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,879
- Great.
<i>- It's over with the doctor!</i>

251
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:23,342
<i>That is the voice of a woman
who just got brutally dumped.</i>

252
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,437
♪ <i>All right</i> ♪

253
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,275
♪ <i>Yeah</i> ♪

254
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,316
Stop!

255
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,519
<i>Don't you want to look your best?</i>

256
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:37,356
Just leave me alone.
You are always nitpicking.

257
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,279
Wow.

258
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,784
Hey!

259
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:46,875
Hey.

260
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,792
- Okay. Hi.
- Yeah.

261
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,086
Wow.

262
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,716
<i>Awkward.</i>

263
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,591
So, uh, how's it going?
Uh, how's Mr. Belvedere?

264
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,762
Good, good.

265
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,682
You know, he's still wiping his ass on the carpet.
He learned that from you.

266
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,428
Yeah. How's, uh,
how's the legal aid work going?

267
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,513
You know how much I love an underdog.

268
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:14,226
Yeah, that said that's why
you put up with me for so long, huh?

269
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:15,737
You said it.

270
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:20,190
- So... So.
- <i>So?</i>

271
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:25,404
I don't know, I thought it would be
better to tell you in person that...

272
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:26,915
Mm-hm.

273
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,578
<i>No!</i>

274
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,208
Wow. Oh, Anne. Wow, that is, uh...

275
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,341
That is so much bigger
than the one that I got you.

276
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,792
<i>Ugh, it's gaudy.</i>

277
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,673
That's Dan, right? Dr. Dan.

278
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,220
Yeah, it's Dan.

279
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,139
Holy shit, Anne. Way to go.

280
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:46,226
Are you okay?

281
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,511
- Yeah, I'm okay. Yeah.
<i>- Well, I am not okay.</i>

282
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,889
You could just say,
"Congratulations, I'm happy for you."

283
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:56,021
You know, like two people who still
care enough about each other to lie

284
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,353
so that the other one
doesn't feel like complete shit.

285
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,154
Maybe we could do that version of this?

286
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,699
<i>No, I am... I am happy for you, Anne.</i>

287
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,185
- You know, I'm, uh...
<i>- No!</i>

288
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,245
Congratulations.

289
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,695
Thank you.

290
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,451
<i>That was going to be us, Eddie!</i>

291
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:13,786
<i>I, for one, would not be inconsolable
if Dan were to fall into traffic</i>

292
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,917
<i>and lose his head and his feet
and all of his teeth!</i>

293
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,543
- What?
- What was that?

294
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,420
What? Nothing.

295
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:22,846
Whoa.

296
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,348
If I ask you a question, do you
have the ability to tell me the truth?

297
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,928
You mean, as in being super happy
for you because of your engagement?

298
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,184
Because you just told me to lie,
so that's really confusing.

299
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,857
Is Venom with you?

300
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,105
He's dead.

301
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,981
<i>I am. I'm playing dead right now.</i>

302
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,312
Yeah, I mean, he...

303
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,194
- Right.
- Okay.

304
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,696
- Okay.
- Good.

305
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,403
Well, that's...

306
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,539
You just don't change, do you?

307
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,913
What are you talking about?
This is just a huge shock. Um, I'm in...

308
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,496
Anne, I'm in love with you.
This is a lot to process.

309
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,547
The truth is you don't love anybody.
You can't.

310
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,294
Commitment's just not your thing.

311
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,760
All right, then, fine.

312
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,425
Do not marry Dan.

313
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,051
Dan makes me feel safe.

314
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,142
Ugh.

315
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,218
And you made me feel
like I was on a roller coaster.

316
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,599
Sometimes you have to know
when to get off.

317
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,293
- Yeah, and not yak.
<i>- And not yak!</i>

318
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,773
You know? Not yak.

319
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,360
Yak.

320
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,240
Hey, Venom. Take care of him, all right?

321
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,739
Don't let him
keep messing everything up.

322
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,743
<i>I'm going
to make you cry now, Eddie.</i>

323
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,868
<i>She will love it.</i>

324
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,916
<i>Cry.</i>

325
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,539
<i>Cry.</i>

326
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,041
It's a lot to process.

327
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,798
Congratulations, Anne.

328
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,758
That's great news.

329
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,014
<i>Slow down, pal!</i>

330
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,975
Why? You don't believe in consequences.

331
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,481
No injuries. You fix them.

332
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,438
No hangovers. You mend them.

333
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,865
I couldn't even hurt myself if I tried!

334
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:20,583
<i>Eddie, I apologize
that I can't mend the heart.</i>

335
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,711
<i>Emotional pain, it hits much harder.</i>

336
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,168
<i>And it lasts longer.</i>

337
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:31,632
<i>You just need to pull up
your big-boy pants and take it.</i>

338
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,092
Yeah, well, that's easy for you to say.

339
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,186
<i>Why?</i>

340
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,183
Because I'm a real boy.

341
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,731
And you're just an amoeba.

342
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:46,021
<i>I will only take that
because we are hurting right now.</i>

343
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:53,911
<i>Don't worry, buddy.
I will get you through this.</i>

344
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:05,332
<i>Do you know what always
cheers me up in the morning, Eddie?</i>

<i>You are responsible</i>

371
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:23,873
<i>for bringing about
the end of Cletus Kasady.</i>

372
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:29,049
<i>It's only right that you hold the door
for me on my way out.</i>

373
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,216
<i>They'll stop my heart...</i>

374
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,091
<i>just like it stopped at my birth.</i>

375
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:37,765
<i>What if Cletus Kasady
had never been revived?</i>

376
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:42,728
<i>He would never have pushed
Grandma down a flight of stairs.</i>

377
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:48,810
<i>Bye-bye, Grandma,
you puckered old sphincter.</i>

378
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:53,530
<i>He would never have thrown
a hair dryer into Mother's bathtub.</i>

379
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:58,077
<i>Yes, Mama, I'm a bad, bad boy.</i>

380
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:03,033
<i>He would never have been beaten

<i>St. Estes Home for Unwanted Children.</i>

383

<i>That circus of hell...</i>

<i>with one bright light.</i>

385
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,569
<i>Oh, Eddie.</i>

386
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:36,240
<i>We are all born into this world
through blood and pain.</i>

<i>Every hero has an origin story.</i>

388
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,250
<i>Your friend...</i>

<i>"Cletus Kasady."</i>

390
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,585
Kiss, hug, kiss, hug.

391
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,458
Smiley face.

392
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,219
Ew.

393
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:58,306
<i>Nut job.</i>

394
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,089
You know, I should be there.

395
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:01,640
<i>Uh, no, it's a bad idea.</i>

396
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,309
I mean, I put him there.

397
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:08,105
<i>Actually, he put himself there
when he decided to be a complete lunatic.</i>

398
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,023
<i>Ta-da!</i>

399
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:13,353
You know, it would be nice just to have
your support, just like just for once.

400
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:14,687
- <i>Ketchup?</i>
- Excuse me...

401
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,116
<i>This place
is an all-you-can-eat buffet.</i>

402
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,695
<i>Who's going to care if I polish off
a couple of these idiots?</i>

403
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,349
You can't be sure
who is and who is not guilty.

404
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,489
<i>They're in prison!</i>

405
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,700
Yeah, you know but some people
take false confessions.

406
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:30,537
You know, they take pleas.
<i>We watched Making a Murderer.</i>

407
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:33,168
- You all right?
- Yeah, man, I'm just practicing.

408
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,124
<i>I am a predator, Eddie.</i>

409
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:37,381
- Mm-hm.
<i>- Lions do not eat salad.</i>

410
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:39,132
But you're not a lion, are you?

411
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:42,761
I see you more of a vexatious
little pig-dog-house-bat thing.

412
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,471
That's fine.

413
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,926
- <i>You suck.</i>
- You suck!

414
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,058
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, wow.

415
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:52,187
I don't have an explanation for that.
I think I'm having a panic attack, um...

416
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,477
Yeah, I'll sign here.

417
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:59,820
Stand two feet away from the bars.
No touching the condemned.

418
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,071
Understood.

419
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,361
Visitor's here!

420
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,288
This is a "me" thing, not a "we" thing.

421
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,124
<i>Everything is a "you" thing.</i>

422
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:19,711
Oh, happy day for you,
Eddie Brock.

423
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:22,721
Mm, what a scoop.

424
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:27,223
The end of the Magical Misery Tour.

425
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,180
I worry for your soul.

426
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:33,642
How will you live with the weight
of snuffing out a man's life?

427
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,857
I was, uh... I was hoping maybe
you could give me a couple pointers.

428
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,067
Funny little guy, aren't you?

429
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:47,079
<i>Don't need that.
My memory is outstanding.</i>

430
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,411
<i>Rude.</i>

431
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,867
Consequences.

432
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,834
Every decision you ever make.

433
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:02,087
Who do we leave behind,
and how do we leave them?

434
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:07,846
A connubial bed, empty.

435
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,849
Waiting in the darkness

436
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:14,022
for the rescuer who never comes.

437
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,224
Because of you.

438
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,026
<i>This guy makes zero sense.</i>

439
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:21,071
<i>You and I are the same.</i>

440
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:23,274
No. No, we're not.

441
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,781
Twisted insides, mean daddies.

442
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,614
You feel like home to me, Eddie.
Like family.

443
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:34,748
And really, truly, that is all
I ever wanted in this world.

444
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,249
Family.

445
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:40,254
Well, killing your grandmother and your mother
sure is a funny way of showing it.

446
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:47,090
Anything you wanna
unburden yourself with before...

447
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:51,977
um, this happens?

448
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,440
Yes.

449
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:59,356
I have wishes to bestow upon you.

450
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,902
<i>Oh, that is kind.</i>

451
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,152
I want to wish you...

452
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,859
this heartbreak.

453
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,991
<i>Uh-oh. Too late.</i>

454
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:12,745
I wish for you
to see out your days alone,

455
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,620
as you always have been.

456
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,826
<i>Watch it, pal!</i>

457
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,662
Where are you going with this?

458
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:22,626
You are a cancer to everyone
who ever loved you, Eddie.

459
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,092
Deceived your trusting fiancée.

460
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:31,551
And no wonder Daddy
could never look at you again

461
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:34,637
after you killed his wife, your mother,

462
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,347
just by being born.

463
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,602
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

464
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,192
No, no! No, no, don't! Don't!

465
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,566
<i>Speak to my friend again
like that! I dare you!</i>

466
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,777
Hey, hey!

467
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:50,362
No touching the inmate. Hey, back up!

468
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,329
Eddie?

469
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:57,994
You're done.

470
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:03,583
I have tasted blood before, my friend,
and that is not it.

471
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:07,295
Eddie Brock has a big secret!

472
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:08,971
Shut up, Kasady!

473
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,479
- <i>That may have been a mistake.</i>
- Shut up.

474
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,729
Hey, aren't you Eddie Brock?

475
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,564
I don't know anymore.

476
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:30,360
<i>Eddie!</i>

477
00:30:30,385 --> 00:30:32,227
I don't wanna hear another word
out of your mouth.

478
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:34,155
<i>- Eddie.</i>
- I don't wanna hear it.

479
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,739
<i>Eddie, I am sorry.</i>

480
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:39,035
<i>That was his last time
on record ever!</i>

481
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:42,747
There's no more any words for his victims.
You know, they're gone.

482
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:47,210
Any clues of outstanding bodies,
we've lost forever. And completely...

483
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:48,760
<i>I didn't mean to.</i>

484
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,607
- You didn't mean to?
<i>- And I said I'm sorry!</i>

485
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,928
You didn't mean to, but you did it.
You just decided, I don't know, "Blurgh!"

486
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,100
That's it. You did it.

487
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,428
You didn't even think
we might get caught, get killed?

488
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,230
You know you don't think about things like that.
You think about chickens, do you?

489
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:03,685
You think about you, you think about
what you want, and you think about you.

490
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:07,522
<i>Let me remind you of something, Eddie.
You were a loser before I came along.</i>

491
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:09,948
<i>You were nothing. I made you special!</i>

492
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,072
Oh, you made me special har?
Let me tell you something, right?

493
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:15,496
Before you came along, I had a life.
I didn't have chickens all right, but I had dreams.

494
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,700
Ya, I had dreams and a fiancée
and I had a really successful TV show!

495
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:22,003
<i>Ah, but you destroyed
all of those things by yourself.</i>

496
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:26,624
Yeah. But you know what? I rebuilt my life
and now I just wanna live it. Good night.

497
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,584
<i>And how did you build this new life?</i>

498
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:29,713
- Hmm?
- Excuse me?

499
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:34,094
Well, who found the clue on the wall
so you could be this big shiny hero?

500
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:36,926
Hmm? Who found the clue? Who?

501
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,761
- Wow.
- Yeah.

502
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:44,146
No, no, no. This is not
about being a hero for me, man.

503
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:49,231
This is about wanting to live in peace.
Do you understand what I'm talking about?

504
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:53,238
No, you don't understand
what I'm talking about.

505
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:56,241
Okay, this is about me
wanting to live without you

506
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:59,540
whining in my ear all the time
about eating bad guys

507
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,458
or like nagging me about Anne

508
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,912
or destroying my place
or destroying my life!

509
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:07,748
Do you know how lucky
you are that I chose you?

510
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:08,958
You chose me?

511
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,715
Buddy, I'm the only person
that took you in

512
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:14,012
when your friends kicked you off
the planet Ming Mong

513
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,180
because you are a reject!

514
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:18,760
You are a pariah! Lethal protection,
my ass. You couldn't protect anything.

515
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:21,846
You are useless. You couldn't
get a job down here cleaning toilets!

516
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,356
I'm sorry!

517
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,605
I don't know what came over me.
Please, let me fix it.

518
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,561
So I can break it again!

519
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,360
You son of a bitch!

520
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,589
Out! Get out. Take your stuff. Get out!

521
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,962
This is my house!

522
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,511
No!

523
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,636
Keep it down up there!

524
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,258
Get out!

525
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,728
Oh...

526
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,103
Sonny?

527
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,444
- You wouldn't dare!
- Yeah, absolutely. Mm-hm, mm-hm.

528
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,782
No, no, no!

529
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,408
- <i>Yeah!</i>
- No!

530
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:21,910
I'm calling the police!

531
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,786
I am so sorry.

532
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,995
Show yourself.

533
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,142
You can't win!

534
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:44,971
Take a look at me.
Look at the size of you.

535
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,100
Puny.

536
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,144
How dare you?

537
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,446
<i>I guess this is goodbye.</i>

538
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:01,871
Oh, yeah.
Finally something we agree on.

539
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,410
What in the world?

540
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,166
All this crazy shit.

541
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,840
Yeah!

542
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,021
Hmm?

543
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,691
No. No.

544
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,142
No, no, no.

545
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:36,192
No!

546
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:37,523
Yeah!

547
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,696
No!

548
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,403
- Yeah!
- No!

549
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,947
Oh, yeah!

550
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,328
No.

551
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,002
No, no, no.

552
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,833
I wish I never met you!

553
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:58,840
<i>Sayonara!</i>

554
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,610
Cletus Kasady,
you have been tried, convicted

555
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:17,984
and sentenced to death
by the state of California.

556
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:23,536
May your passing bring closure
to the victims' families.

557
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:27,411
And may you find peace
in the hereafter.

558
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,333
Soon come chaos.

559
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,912
Chaos soon come.

560
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,631
Are those your final words?

561
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:39,509
Enjoy the show.

562

Something wicked this way comes.

564
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:35,734
Let me out!

565
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,061
Don't move!

566
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,073
Hey!

567
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:20,999
Please.

568
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:24,176
I got a family.

569
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,534
Any last words, warden?

570
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:53,578
Don't! Please!

Yeah, sure. Come on in.

592
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:58,696
Uh, I was just seeing for myself
on the news.

593
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,789
Yeah, on a scale of one to ten,
it's 11 bad.

594
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:02,741
Yeah.

595
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:05,827
Reports coming from San Quentin
are, quite frankly, bananas.

596
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:06,753
Nice TV.

597
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,080
Uh, well, how did he do it?

598
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:12,588
Yeah, how did he, indeed?
That's the million-dollar question.

599
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,920
And yet again,
you were his special visitor.

600
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,504
So, what did he tell you?

601
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,806
Me? Nothing. Nothing at all.

602
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,475
Nothing about an escape plan?

603
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,098
Nothing about some kind
of elaborate breakout costume?

604
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:24,646
No.

605
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:28,100
Well, how come every time you seem
to be at the center of these things,

606
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,811
and then miraculously
you know nothing about it?

607
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,145
Maybe I'm lucky.

608
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,156
Yeah, right.

609
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,362
You said, um...

610
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:44,450
the reports coming out
of San Quentin are bananas.

611
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:45,875
What do you mean by "bananas"?

612
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,802
Remember when I asked you
a similar question...

613
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,621
- Uh-huh.
- The day you interviewed him?

614
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,207
Information is currency.

615
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,918
You of all people should know that.

616
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,253
Come on.

617
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,222
I thought he'd come to try to find
the man that nearly got him executed,

618
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,428
but I guess not.

619
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,597
I'd lay low if I was you.

620
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:09,641
I'll see myself out.

621
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:22,822
Okay, think. Think, think, think.

622
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,121
What would Venom do?

623
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:28,414
He would find you before you find me,
and he would eat your face! Damn.

624
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,419
All right.

I'm no use to anybody here.
I'm just wasting your time.

779
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,447
You know what I keep thinking?
I keep thinking:

780
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:16,996
"What else is Eddie Brock
not sharing about Cletus Kasady?

781
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:21,997
Why was it Eddie that Cletus wanted
to witness his execution?" Huh?

782
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,294

783

that bizarre outburst
at the lobster restaurant,

785
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:33,755
and only you at the Life Foundation
when that rocket exploded.

786
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,556
And now Clyde's found Bonnie

787
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:40,136
and there's a dead psychiatrist at a
facility I knew nothing about until today.

788
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,221
And people are talking
about seeing monsters.

789
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:43,806
Monsters?

790
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,938
Uh, what do you mean "monsters"?

791
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:49,737
Monsters, Eddie! Everywhere Cletus goes,
so goes this supposed monster.

792
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,154
Oh, God.

793
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,697
Talk to me, Eddie.

794
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,491
Talk to me.

795
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:58,325
How's he doing it?

796
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:03,417
<i>What's the secret?
How's he making people see things?</i>

797
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,619
All right. I, uh...

798
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:09,507
I can't answer any more of your questions
without making my phone call.

799
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,463
I'll get you your phone call.

800
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:19,258
But you know what secrets want, Eddie?

801
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:22,812
They want out.
That's why they're so hard to keep.

802
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,405
Eddie asked you to do this?

803
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:36,359
He has no one else that can help him?
We'll be late for the party.

804
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,739
He's in trouble, Dan.

805
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,695
Yeah, trouble is his thing.

806
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:44,332
- Are there gonna be aliens again?
- No, of course not.

807
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,541
I'd like to speak to him alone.

808
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:52,796
Your duty of honesty supersedes your duty
to the client if somebody gets harmed.

809
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,544
They teach you that at posh school?

810
00:57:57,182 --> 00:58:01,392
Oh, hey. Anne. Hey, Anne,
thank you so much for coming.

811
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,185
Boy, that little guy's a charmer, huh?

812
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,139
How much do I need
to worry about you right now?

813
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:08,349
I messed up.

814
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:09,774
Okay. How badly?

815
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:12,444
It couldn't be worse, and it's all on me.

816
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:15,698
Whatever you did,
you just need to tell the cops the truth.

817
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:19,743
No. No. No, I can't tell them
that they are chasing a serial killer

818
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:22,743
who's also got an alien inside of him

819
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,617
and he's capable of killing everybody.

820
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:31,706
Venom. Talk to me. What's happening?

821
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,713
No, he's not here. He's not here.

822
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:40,719
Is this an "I'm lying" "He's not here"
or is this a real "He's not here"?

823
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:41,890
He's not here.

824
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:43,809
Jesus Christ, Eddie.

825
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,855
<i>St. Estes fire. All units.</i>

826
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,020
What the actual f...?

827
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:47,972
Eddie, think.

828
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:51,400
I don't know. All I know is that he
can't go long without eating food, right?

829
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:54,103
So he's eating chicken
and he eats chocolate, and that's it.

830
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,359
And that is only
if he's still observing the rules.

831
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:01,996
We need to find him.

832
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,238
You mean I need to find him.

833
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:07,745
Yeah, you need to find him, please.
And then I will fix it.

834
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,161
- I'll try.
- Thank you.

835
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:14,502
Mrs. Chen.

836
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:16,083
- Who's asking?
- It's me.

837
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:19,299
What do you want?

838
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,629
Oh, she's a charmer.

839
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,326
- Okay, listen...
- You broke Eddie's heart.

840
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,682
I don't have time to explain
why that's off the mark.

841
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:27,307
- Do you know where Venom is?
- You wanna break his heart too?

842
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,513
I'm not gonna get
into who did what to who.

843
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:31,690
Eddie said
he might be here for the chocolate.

844
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:33,108
I need to speak with the alien.

845
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:35,687
- You said there wouldn't be any aliens.
- I meant more aliens.

846
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:38,342
- <i>Breaking news.
- The mayor has issued a curfew...</i>

847
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,572
Turn the volume up, please.

848
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:45,029
<i>Kasady and Barrison should be treated
as armed and extremely dangerous.</i>

849
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:47,706
<i>An all-out manhunt continues tonight.</i>

850
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:48,999
So?

851
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,621
Cletus has a symbiote.

852
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:53,704
Oh, my God! Any other information
you're pathologically lying about?

853
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:55,540
- Pussy.
- Excuse me?

854
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:57,841
- Eddie needs Venom.
- She just called me a pussy.

855
00:59:57,928 --> 01:00:01,011
He said he didn't need him,
that life was better without him.

856
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:03,135
Okay, I don't understand.
What do you care...?

857
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,307
Oh, wait a second.

858
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:10,221
You get out here right now.

859
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:15,435
Do you see that?
Seriously, do you see that?

860
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:16,769
Yeah, hon, I've seen it.

861
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:21,573
Eddie's going to have to fight
this battle all by his little bitch self.

862
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,401
Don't be a big baby. Go help your friend!

863
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:26,032
He said I couldn't
get a job fixing toilets!

864
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:30,325
Cletus will come for him.
He won't survive without you.

865
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:34,662
Of course he won't.
Because I am the hero of the two of us.

866
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:39,174
Yeah, you're the big sexy hero.

867
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:46,057
You're the coolest, you're the hottest,
and you're the bravest.

868
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:47,143
I am.

869
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,675
I'm still standing right here.

870
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,386
No one likes you, Dan!

871
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,225
I love seeing you in action.

872
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,028
Mm.

873
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,946
Let's go save that asshole.

874
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:10,080
I promised
we'd be free from here.

875
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:14,206
And we'd walk
to the cathedral on the hill.

876
01:01:16,548 --> 01:01:17,879
A wedding.

877
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:19,422
Three guests.

878
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,841
One for each of us.

879
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,636
The cop that took my eye.

880
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:26,305
Eddie Brock.

881
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:29,304
And Venom.

882
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:33,141
A red wedding.

883
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:37,818
You...

884
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:39,692
You didn't find him?

885
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:54,708
Oh, my Lord. What happened?

886
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:08,422
- Hey.
- Dan. All right, let's go.

887
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:10,550
<i>I'm not talking to him!</i>

888
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:11,930
He doesn't want to come out.

889
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:15,763
What do you mean? We have to leave now
"cause Cletus is gonna wipe the city out.

890
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:18,519
<i>We're not doing shit
until he apologizes.</i>

891
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,317
So he's looking for an apology.

892
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,144
I know that amends aren't your thing...

893
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:23,855
Like, as in right now, an apology?

894
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:26,486
<i>I need him to beg.</i>

895
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:29,576
<i>Fine, I will be the bigger of us.</i>

896
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:32,951
<i>I will always be the bigger of us.
But go on.</i>

897
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:36,124
- What is he saying?
- He said he's listening very sincerely.

898
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:37,701
All right, listen to this.

899
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:38,706
I am sorry.

900
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:40,162
<i>Not the right tone.</i>

901
01:02:41,383 --> 01:02:42,214
I'm sorry.

902
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,415
<i>Nope!</i>

903
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:45,251
I am sorry!

904
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:46,835
So weird.

905
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:47,840
I'm sorry!

906
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,491
I don't know why you're shouting at me.

907
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:53,180
Okay, well, fine.
I was a loser before I met you.

908
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:54,886
- <i>Yup. That's right.</i>
- And, uh...

909
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,721
And now I am someone.

910
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:01,229
All right? You made me special.

911
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:02,650
<i>Damn right!</i>

912
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:06,071
- Why don't you put a cherry on it?
- A cherry on that? Right. Um...

913
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:07,741
I'm

914
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:11,659
I am truly very sorry
for everything that I said...

915
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,027
- <i>Mm-hm. Mm-hm.</i>
- Everything that I did not say,

916
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:15,288
everything that I did,

917
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:18,163
and probably everything that I did not do.

918
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:20,164
- <i>Mm...</i>
- Yeah, he's thinking.

919
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:25,045
- Come on, come on.
<i>- Mmm...</i>

920
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:26,421
- <i>Okay!</i>
- Whoa.

921
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:27,511
Whoa!

922
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:30,963
- Oh, no.
<i>- Kiss her!</i>

923
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,923
Are you gonna kiss me now?

924
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:34,679
- No!
- No?

925
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:36,510
God, I'm never doing that again.

926
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:39,221
Well, maybe never.
I don't know. Honestly, it's really fun.

927
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:42,116
<i>If we save the day, can we
call ourselves the Lethal Protector?</i>

928
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:43,103
That is so '80s.

929
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:46,687
Dan. Pack quickly.
Don't stay. And if for any reason...

930
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:48,021
Fire and sound.

931
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:49,732
"Fire and Sound"? Is that a band?

932
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,612
- No, it's what kills them.
- Yeah.

933
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:53,410
Okay, look, man, I've got her.

934
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:58,073
- Ah! Ow!
<i>- Not sorry!</i>

935
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:00,205
God, I'm so sorry.

936
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:02,957
Those two need some
serious couples counseling.

937
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:09,001
I'm pulling up to Brock's now.

938
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:15,140
Shit. Oh, my God.

939
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:20,429
Kasady, place your hands on your head!

940
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:22,727
Which, um...

941
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:25,063
hands?

942
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:26,737
What the f...?

943
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,984
We found you.

944
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,946
Shriek will be so pleased.

945
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:43,202
Yoo-hoo!

946
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:46,880
Brockalicious!

947
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,602
Bling-a-ling.

948
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,528
Now, whose finger were you meant for?

949
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:15,821
Ah.

950
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:20,907
A nice shiny lure for a little fishy.

951
01:05:28,216 --> 01:05:30,753
Okay, here we go, buddy.

952
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:41,434
Hello, Anne.

953
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:43,933
I just incapacitated your boyfriend.

954
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:45,639
Now, he'll be okay,

955
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:48,441
with an answer about where Eddie Brock is.

956
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:52,066
Well, I'm sure as shit
not gonna tell you that.

957
01:05:52,157 --> 01:05:53,818
It's a shame to hurt you.

958
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:04,371
Tell Brock Cletus will make a swap.

959
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:06,828
Her head for his.

960
01:06:09,174 --> 01:06:10,335
He's gonna kill you both.

961
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:12,917
Peeps have tried that already.

962
01:06:13,011 --> 01:06:14,342
Botched it.

963
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:28,557
<i>They can't find him!</i>

964
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,267
They are hunting us too, buddy.

965
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:34,025
Come on, where are you?

966
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,615
Hey, Dan. What's going on?

967
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:43,697
- Eddie, they got her.
<i>- Huh?</i>

968
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:44,791
They've taken Anne!

969
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:47,083
- Calm down.
- They took her to their wedding.

970
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:48,786
- They took her where?
<i>- Their wedding.</i>

971
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,791
- Grace Cathedral. Hurry.
<i>- We're on our way.</i>

972
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:54,003
All right, it looks like
we are going to a wedding.

973
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:56,084
<i>Oh, will there be canapés?</i>

974
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:57,544
You bet your ass.

975
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:36,341
That distant cathedral...

976
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:38,843
is all I see.

977
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:44,300
Fractured angel...

978
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:47,264
the other part of me.

979
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:53,065
Dearly beloved... Gifts first.

980
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:54,984
Actually, traditionally...

981
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,108
Shut your mouth...

982
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:00,117
Father.

983
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:04,695
Baby, I got for you what you want most.

984
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:06,951
- The cop?
- The cop.

985
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,881
Continue, Father.

986
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:10,700
Dearly beloved,

987
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:13,002
if anyone objects to this marriage,

988
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:16,043
speak now or forever hold their...

989
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,085
Where is she?

990
01:08:23,558 --> 01:08:25,640
There you are.

991
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,343
Death to you, Father.

992
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:28,598
No!

993
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:30,144
Not you, Father.

994
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:33,019
You, Father.

995
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,224
Oh, shit!

996
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:37,485
Uh, where you going? What are you doing?

997
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:41,315
<i>This is much worse than I thought.
That is a red one. Wow. Uh...</i>

998
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:43,867
- Red one?
<i>- We should leave. Immediately.</i>

999
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:46,536
<i>Annie will get over it.
We never liked her anyway.</i>

1000
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:48,239
- <i>So let's go.</i>
- Now?

1001
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:51,451
<i>Congratulations
to the happy couple. We are leaving.</i>

1002
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,376
Eddie! Yoo-hoo!

1003
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:56,163
I'll be right with you. All right?

1004
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:57,964
You need to come out right now.

1005
01:08:58,051 --> 01:09:00,839
Because I am feeling
super, super vulnerable right here.

1006
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:02,714
Brock's just like you?

1007
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,466
Not for long.

1008
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:07,049
Eddie, over here!

1009
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:10,097
You need to come out right now.

1010
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:13,351
I will let you eat everybody!
You can eat them all!

1011
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:15,773
Apart from him in the robe.
You cannot eat him.

1012
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,567
- <i>Promise?</i>
- I promise!

1013
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:21,948
<i>Thank you.</i>

1014
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:37,663
Baby!

1015
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:39,714
Shut your mouth.

1016
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,047
Marriage trouble already?

1017
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:46,337
Time to die.

1018
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:48,048
<i>That's the spirit!</i>

1019
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:51,225
I mean us. We are going to die.

1020
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:34,769
I... I killed you.

1021
01:10:34,856 --> 01:10:36,847
Well, you can't kill a ghost.

1022
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:45,484
You. Kill him, but
keep your mouth shut.

1023
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:48,283
<i>Our wife knows what she's doing.</i>

1024
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:50,155
Just turn it down.

1025
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,863
Who do you think you're talking to?

1026
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:55,616
- Stop him!
- My cop!

1027
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:03,919
Honeymoon over?

1028
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:06,047
<i>Oh, God. No.</i>

1029
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:10,050
Power up.

1030
01:11:10,141 --> 01:11:11,222
<i>No!</i>

1031
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:30,989
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday!
Cletus Kasady...

1032
01:11:43,508 --> 01:11:48,001
What do they say
about an eye for an eye?

1033
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:59,521
Fire and sound!

1034
01:11:59,607 --> 01:12:00,768
Except without the sound.

1035
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:05,487
Baby!

1036
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:09,280
Cletus!

1037
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,221
Mano a mano, Brock.

1038
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:50,697
You know how I spent my endless days?

1039
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:06,580
I spent them thinking about
how you only told one side of the story.

1040
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:23,513
You didn't write about the part
where Cletus was abused

1041
01:13:23,608 --> 01:13:26,817
by Mommy, Daddy and Granny!

1042
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:04,687
You didn't tell the world
how he was a scared little boy

1043
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:07,348
that no one cared about

1044
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:10,856
and no one came to save!

1045
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:18,818
You never asked yourself... why!

1046
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,913
That's bad journalism.

1047
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:31,918
Oh, happy days.

1048
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:43,551
I'm not a crazy man,

1049
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,973
but I am a vengeful one.

1050
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:54,437
You're going to watch her die.

1051
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:01,663
Anne!

1052
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:03,289
Anne!

1053
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:20,015
Do something!

1054
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:25,594
Eddie, I'm afraid we cannot beat them.

1055
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:34,524
Baby, that's too much.

1056
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:37,318
You gotta stop him.

1057
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:39,194
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1058
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:41,196
I'll shut her up for good.

1059
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:45,121
No! Stop! You're hurting her!

1060
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:50,660
<i>Get up!</i>

1061
01:15:50,755 --> 01:15:52,245
I can't.

1062
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:55,457
<i>Look, look!</i>

1063
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:57,751
<i>They're not symbiotic.</i>

1064
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:00,837
- Get away from her!
- Shut up.

1065
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:03,218
<i>Take your hands off my wife!</i>

1066
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:06,884
<i>They're not a match.</i>

1067
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:09,095
We are.

1068
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:11,557
<i>That's right. We are.</i>

1069
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:15,397
Together we are...

1070
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:19,405
The Lethal Protector!

1071
01:17:36,277 --> 01:17:40,316
Let there be carnage!

1072
01:18:02,595 --> 01:18:04,211
I got you. You okay?

1073
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:38,161
Father, one of us must die.

1074
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:40,462
<i>We need fire.</i>

1075
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:45,842
Or sound.

1076
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:02,565
No!

1077
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:22,209
Holy mackerel!

1078
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:01,460
He did not taste good.

1079
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:18,349
I'm a killer
with or without the monster, Eddie.

1080
01:20:21,108 --> 01:20:22,644
<i>You know what I really wanted?</i>

1081
01:20:24,445 --> 01:20:25,901
No. What was it, Cletus?

1082
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:28,775
I told you, but you weren't listening.

1083
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:31,440
Well, I'm listening now.

1084
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:35,069
I wanted your friendship.

1085
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:39,457
I'm sorry, Cletus.

1086
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:43,707
Fuck this guy!

1087
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:07,814
You in there, get him out of here.

1088
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:09,986
They're gonna come for you both.

1089
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:11,574
I know.

1090
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:14,741
Hey, Anne.

1091
01:21:15,412 --> 01:21:16,573
Take care.

1092
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:22,328
Yeah. You too, champ.

1093
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:23,750
Dan!

1094
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:26,829
- You take care too.
- Thanks.

1095
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:28,380
I like you.

1096
01:21:28,926 --> 01:21:30,633
We totally didn't need him, though.

1097
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:33,882
<i>Honestly, I think he was
more of a hindrance than a help.</i>

1098
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:49,393
Monsters.

1099
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:04,409
That there is Don Quixote,
and the guy next to him is Sancho Panza.

1100
01:22:05,129 --> 01:22:08,667
They're two very different people who
have very different takes on the world.

1101
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:11,841
Different ways of doing things.

1102
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:15,546
Sometimes they didn't like each other
a whole lot, but ultimately...

1103
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:20,140
they worked together
to bring out the best in each other.

1104
01:22:21,228 --> 01:22:24,391
<i>Eddie, the time has come.</i>

1105
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:27,056
<i>I must go alone.</i>

1106
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:29,099
<i>It is me they want.</i>

1107
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:30,855
Yeah.

1108
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:34,902
Well, my dear Sancho,

1109
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:38,575
facts are the enemy of truth.

1110
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:40,865
<i>What does that even mean?</i>

1111
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,196
It means...

1112
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:45,495
It means that we...

1113
01:22:46,336 --> 01:22:49,328
- are Ve...
<i>- Fugitives!</i>

1114
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:51,710
Nom. Yeah. Yeah.

1115
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,337
<i>- On the run.</i>

Thank you for bringing me here.

You're welcome, buddy.

1118
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,358

- Mm-hm.

1119
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:18,865
I'm sorry
that we can't do anything about the old

wind-in-your-hair situation, but...

1121
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:25,452
Osho says, when you love someone,

1122
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:28,330
- you accept the whole person...
- Osho?

1123
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:30,752
With all of their defects.

1124
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:32,000
Defects. Hmm.

1125

Nobody is perfect.

1126
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,750
Just go back a minute. You telling me...?

1127
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:38,131
You just said that you love me.

1128
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:39,428
- Um...
- You did.

1129
01:23:42,184 --> 01:23:43,800
Where will we go?

1130
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:45,680
I don't know. I don't know.

1131
01:23:47,105 --> 01:23:49,312
Anywhere that needs
a Lethal Protector, I suppose.

1132
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:53,142
- Oh! You really meant it!
- Yeah.

1133
01:23:53,820 --> 01:23:56,312
We will need a cape. And a mask.

1134
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:01,158
No. No, I think you got that covered.
We're good.
