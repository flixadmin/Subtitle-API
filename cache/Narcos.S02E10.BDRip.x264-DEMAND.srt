1
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:24,384
Citizens of Colombia,

2
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:29,827
we present your new president,
Pablo Escobar!

3
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:39,633
Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!

4
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:42,200
Thank you.

5
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,137
How are you, sir?

6
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,419
Thank you.

7
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,354
Thank you.

8
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,196
Much appreciated.

9
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:09,901
Thank you.

10
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:12,396
Please come in, Mr. President.

11
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,360
- All yours.
- Thank you.

12
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:49,366
Happy birthday to you.

13
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,879
- Happy birthday to you.
- What's this?

14
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,141
Happy birthday, dear Pablo.

15
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,652
Happy birthday to you.

16
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,053
Bravo, Pablito.

17
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,560
I love you, son.
Don't eat the whole cake.

18
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,393
Don't forget to blow out
the candles, Dad.

19
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:14,901
Happy birthday, Daddy!

20
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,736
Pablo, we miss you so much.

21
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,898
We wish we could be there with you.

22
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,634
I know, my love.

23
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:25,673
Soon this will all be behind us.

24
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,347
I promise.

25
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,875
<i>Look up magical realism
in the dictionary,</i>

26
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:15,581
<i>and it'll describe a literary style</i>

27
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,748
<i>incorporating fantastic
or mythical elements</i>

28
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:20,054
<i>into otherwise realistic fiction.</i>

29
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:22,727
<i>Colombia is where it began.</i>

30
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,094
<i>And anyone who's spent real time here
knows why.</i>

31
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,396
<i>It's a place where the bizarre
shakes hands with the inexplicable</i>

32
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:30,527
<i>on a daily basis.</i>

33
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:35,136
<i>But just like in the novels
of Gabriel Garcia Márquez,</i>

34
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:39,372
<i>the weird shit usually pops off
at certain critical moments.</i>

35
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,443
<i>When the whole place is on edge.</i>

36
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,882
<i>When everything's about to change.</i>

37
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:53,787
<i>Of all the people who had
a vested interest in nailing Escobar,</i>

38
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:56,625
<i>Javier Peña deserved to be there
when it went down.</i>

39
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:01,428
<i>No American had given move
or done more.</i>

40
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,165
Well...

41
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,471
To...

42
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,401
the Drug Enforcement Administration?

43
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,503
I'll drink to that while I still can.

44
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,309
You're a fucking lifer, Javi.

45
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:24,955
Well, it doesn't take a genius
to figure out which long-term DEA agent

46
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:27,084
was linked to the Los Pepes death squad.

47
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,128
Well, the Board of Professional Conduct

48
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,528
has never been accused
of being geniuses, so...

49
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,362
Yeah, and who reads
the Miami Herald anyway, right?

50
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,205
Murphy, listen.

51
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:44,774
I meant what I said.

52
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,706
Anyone starts asking questions, just
tell them what they want to hear, okay?

53
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:53,548
- It was always on me.
- Fuck you, Javi.

54
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,815
And anybody who comes around asking.

55
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:03,326
Well, you do me a favor. You...

56
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,833
You get him.

57
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,004
Attention passengers.

58
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:18,409
We will now start boarding Flight 464
to Washington D.C. at Gate Two.

59
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,412
All right, well, I gotta...
I can't finish this. It's...

60
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:22,538
I gotta go.

61
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,385
Take care of yourself.

62
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,861
<i>All it took was the whiff
of a scandal</i>

63
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,097
<i>out of the mouth of an exiled
drug queen</i>

64
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:47,265
<i>and Peña was gone,
like fucking magic.</i>

65
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,114
Good morning, boss.

66
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,810
I made some eggs.

67
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,655
- There's leftover cake.
- Yes, sir.

68
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,315
Thanks.

69
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,991
I got everything we need, boss.

70
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,331
You went to a different store, correct?

71
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:50,927
Yes, sir.
I go to a different one every time.

72
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,936
So, the shopkeeper's mom,
she's a healer.

73
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,777
I paid her a visit.

74
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,776
I told you not to talk to anybody.

75
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,188
Yeah, boss, but...

76
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:16,259
only thing is, since I was a kid,
I've believed in these things.

77
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:18,858
Look...

78
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:23,467
I asked her for something
to protect you.

79
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,034
The sword of St. Michael
the archangel...

80
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,269
- the Virgin...
- and the Holy Child of Atocha.

81
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:39,448
You know my mother and I
built a church?

82
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:41,879
Yes, sir.

83
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,055
In Barrio Pablo Escobar.

84
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,717
That's where I grew up, boss.

85
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,459
Happy birthday, sir.

86
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,228
Thank you, Limón.

87
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,300
Pardon me.

88
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:04,633
Happy birthday to you.

89
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:08,648
Happy birthday dear Pablo.

90
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,581
Happy birthday...

91
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,881
This signal is coming from Medellín.

92
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,251
Casablanca neighborhood, to be exact.

93
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,257
- Pablo's come home.
- I think so.

94
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,191
Hopefully he will
speak to them again tomorrow.

95
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,855
If he does, we'll be listening.

96
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,451
This stays between us, understood?

97
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:52,052
We will setup a temporary base
in Casablanca.

98
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:56,255
We need to act as quickly as possible
as soon as Escobar appears, understood?

99
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,228
- Yes, Colonel.
- Good work.

100
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,697
Lieutenant Martinez?

101
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,542
How long since we heard anything
from Escobar? A month? A month and a half?

102
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:12,534
A month and a half, sir.

103
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:16,478
And that whole time you've been
in the van listening to static?

104
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,276
Yes. Waiting.

105
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:25,417
Stubbornness seems to run in my family.
It's in our blood.

106
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:29,822
Excuse me.

107
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,231
Six.

108
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:52,112
Can you imagine what would happen
if cocaine were legal?

109
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,644
It's your turn.

110
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:00,317
I think if coke was legal, boss,

111
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:05,159
you would be the boss of the world
and the cops couldn't touch you.

112
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,001
Yes, sir.

113
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:21,708
We're sure that the call came from
the Casablanca neighborhood in Medellín.

114
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,215
This is the best intel
we've received in months.

115
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:28,117
Don't underestimate him.
We've made that mistake in the past.

116
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,220
Gentlemen, I want to be loud and clear.

117
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,850
If your men are able to find Escobar...

118
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,455
I don't care about the consequences.

119
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,290
I want him dead.

120
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,901
Do you have a problem with that?

121
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:52,976
With all due respect, Mr. President,
if he resists, that's how it will go.

122
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,310
Otherwise, we're going to capture him.

123
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,148
Keep me informed.

124
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:02,985
Gentlemen.

125
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,019
Mrs. Escobar?

126
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,918
The attorney general called this morning.

127
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,726
He's decided to end
your protective custody.

128
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,896
So we have to leave by the weekend.

129
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:53,633
No. No, you can't do this to us.

130
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,040
They were waiting for your husband
to turn himself in, and he never did.

131
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,073
Ma'am? Ma'am.

132
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,879
May I give you some advice?

133
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:15,458
I think it's time for you to think
about you and your children's safety.

134
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,086
Forget about him.

135
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,943
The kids miss you.
Should I wake up Juan Pablo?

136
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,282
Probably not a good idea
right now, my love.

137
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:51,529
So, do you feel a year older or what?

138
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,831
More like four or five.

139
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,493
We've missed you very much, Pablo.

140
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,867
The days feel longer.

141
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,335
For me too.

142
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,879
I still don't understand
why you're in Medellín.

143
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,144
That place is too dangerous, my love.

144
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:19,686
That's exactly why.
No one would think I'd be here.

145
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,026
Pablo...

146
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,828
I think the time has come.
We don't have a choice.

147
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,828
Turning yourself in
isn't the end of the world, my love.

148
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,202
You can survive prison.

149
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,402
We both know that won't happen.

150
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,811
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

151
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,984
- Listen to me, Pablo...
- They're talking.

152
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,987
- You will always be Pablo Escobar.
- Boss.

153
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,320
You will always be that man
that's admired and followed.

154
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,917
My man.

155
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,421
My love, there's a lot of journalists
who want to speak with you.

156
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,362
The people love you and follow you.

157
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,399
Tata, Limón wants me off.

158
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:05,665
It's Escobar. Let's go west!
Fix the position, Morales.

159
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,739
My love, look at Nelson Mandela.

160
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,438
They put the man in jail,
but the people still believed in him.

161
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,447
They gave him the Nobel Prize.

162
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:21,453
They say he may even become president.
President, Pablo.

163
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,454
Of the same country that imprisoned him.

164
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:25,547
I need to hang up.
We'll talk about this later.

165
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,286
Alvaro, stop. Stop for a second.

166
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,192
All right, Pablo.
But think about what I'm saying.

167
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,129
It's very important.

168
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:35,257
It's our only way out really.

169
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,935
Alvaro, let's go slowly.

170
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,800
Colonel!
Colonel, this is Lieutenant Martinez.

171
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:43,808
Think about turning yourself in, my love.
Think of your family.

172
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,275
I'll think about it.

173
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:47,475
All right?

174
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,944
I love you very much.

175
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,446
Where are you going?

176
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,315
To Medellín.

177
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,948
What? No, no, no, Hermilda.
You can't leave.

178
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,825
My son needs me.

179
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,187
How so?

180
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,295
What you want...

181
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:44,164
for him to turn himself in
to those monsters...

182
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,998
I don't want them to kill him.

183
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,267
They're going to kill him either way,
and you know that.

184
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,934
They won't if he turns himself in.

185
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,876
- It's a trap! Tata, my God!
- Lower your voice.

186
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,811
No! No, ma'am.

187
00:16:54,881 --> 00:17:01,309
I will not stay quiet when...
when I see you betraying my son!

188
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:05,290
I have never betrayed Pablo.
Let's make that very clear.

189
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:09,121
We're locked in this hotel
as if it were a jail.

190
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,220
We can't even leave the country.

191
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:17,226
And the only shot I have at
getting my children out of this alive...

192
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,237
is for Pablo to turn himself in.

193
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,645
My son...

194
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:32,212
needs his mother.

195
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,054
Hermilda.

196
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,434
Please be very careful. Please.

197
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,204
Tell the children...

198
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:00,601
I'll tell them.

199
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,568
We have intel
that Escobar is in this building.

200
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:26,135
Listen up. I want you to do
what you can to get him alive.

201
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,773
Escobar must be brought to justice
before the people of Colombia

202
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,641
and answer for the atrocious crimes
he has committed against this nation.

203
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,907
Now, if he resists...

204
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,747
if a single one of our men
is in harm's way...

205
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,421
I want you to take his life.
Understood?

206
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,254
- Yes, Colonel!
- Let's go.

207
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,703
Everything all right, boss?

208
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,994
Tata wants me to surrender.

209
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:07,339
She said I can be like Nelson Mandela.

210
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:09,635
Nelson Mandela?

211
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,512
Who's that, boss?

212
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,294
Did you buy more rolling papers?

213
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,459
Sorry, no, boss.

214
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:48,264
I can't think with that
fucking smell of Chinese food in here.

215
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,118
He's not here.

216
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,771
Come inside.
You can't risk being seen, sir.

217
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,803
This is my city, Limón.

218
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,510
These are my people.

219
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:37,384
Medellín will never betray me.

220
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:44,161
Colonel.

221
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,688
- We fucked up again, sir.
- He's not here.

222
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,632
Looks like your little machine
is broken.

223
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,727
Go and fiddle with
the little knob. Go on.

224
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:54,628
Excuse me, Colonel.

225
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:02,974
Listen up! Take down
the staging area and head back to Holguín.

226
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:17,193
Son of a bitch wasn't talking
from this building, but he was close.

227
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:25,096
- A ghost.
- What's that?

228
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:29,671
That's what you call a signal that's been
reflected and appears somewhere else.

229
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,837
That's what happened with Escobar's
signal. It bounced off the water.

230
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:41,714
I'm going to get the rolling papers
and clear my head.

231
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:44,550
Give me the keys!

232
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,285
- If you want, I'll go.
- Where are the sunglasses?

233
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,674
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, how are you?

234
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,238
Can I have a strawberry with cream,
please?

235
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,510
- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

236
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,895
- Thank you. How much do I owe you?
- Just two thousand pesos.

237
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,805
- There you go. Thank you.
- Thank you.

238
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:01,381
- Hello. Give me a juice, please.
- Hello, how are you? My pleasure.

239
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:03,785
Sir.

240
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:06,982
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

241
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:07,543
- Kick it here!
- There you go.

242
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:10,714
Yeah!

243
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,815
You'd have to be really stupid
or have a lot of balls

244
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,086
to sit here as if nothing's happening.

245
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,860
They're offering seven million dollars
for you head,

246
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,194
and you're sitting here
like a fucking tourist.

247
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:00,001
You look just like Che Guevara.

248
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,006
What's beautiful is always beautiful.

249
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,875
You look like you ate Che Guevara.

250
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,011
What? You don't miss me or what?

251
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,283
Yesterday, I turned 44 years old.

252
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:25,559
Son of a bitch, you're old, Pablo.

253
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,097
Thank you, Gustavo.

254
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:35,138
Did you know that Julius Caesar
invaded Britain when he was 44?

255
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,301
He lost power many times,
but always got it back.

256
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:40,970
Never letting anything stop him.

257
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,573
Yeah, but that motherfucker
had a fucking army.

258
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:50,415
You remember when we used to talk about
going to the jungle if shit got too heavy?

259
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,786
Yeah, and joining the guerrillas.

260
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,493
Tata wants me to surrender.

261
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:05,095
Tata's a smart woman, Pablo.
She loves you very much.

262
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,102
Maybe it's a good idea.

263
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:13,841
You surrender, go to jail
and take the time to rest, think,

264
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:18,314
to restructure the business,
and escape whenever you want.

265
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:19,782
The legend grows.

266
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:22,944
- She said the same thing.
- Yeah.

267
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:29,088
We both know that things aren't
going to be as easy as before, cousin.

268
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,798
Let's cut the bullshit.

269
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:38,626
We are bandits, Pablo.

270
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:40,464
Right?

271
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,275
What do you think?

272
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,344
I think...

273
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:59,986
that everything started to fall apart
the day you left.

274
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,893
So you do miss me, you son of a bitch.

275
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:19,367
Every fucking day of my life, brother.

276
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,728
Boss? Don't do that again, sir.

277
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,492
- I was worried. It's dangerous.
- Look...

278
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,160
It worked perfectly.

279
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,568
You're a good man, Limón.

280
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,843
Thank you.

281
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:07,852
Thanks a lot.

282
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:11,753
- Are we going to eat the pasta or what?
- Yes, sir.

283
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:15,521
- Put salt on it, pussy.
- Yes, boss. Whatever you say.

284
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:16,924
I'm hungry.

285
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,466
Tata?

286
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:26,504
Pablo?

287
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:29,302
There's the love of my life.

288
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:34,040
- You sound different.
- I'm good, my love.

289
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,606
I feel good.

290
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,517
And ready to talk to those reporters.

291
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,115
Good, my love.

292
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,284
Does that mean you're turning
yourself in?

293
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:52,219
No, Tata.

294
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,356
I'll never surrender.

295
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:01,202
We won't be under protection, Pablo.

296
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,038
You have to.

297
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,404
I'll never surrender, my love.

298
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:26,564
I know, Pablo.

299
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,894
But what's your plan?

300
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,567
All right.

301
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,836
I know what we're going to do.

302
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:44,215
We will talk to all of those
foreign journalists.

303
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,250
That's what we are going to do.

304
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,723
- Foreign journalists...
- Alvaro, slow down!

305
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:57,626
So the world will know
what these bastards are doing...

306
00:34:57,729 --> 00:35:00,357
- It must be around here, Morales.
- You sure?

307
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:08,465
We will make the international press
put pressure on the Colombian government.

308
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:13,944
And listen, we will succeed, Tata.

309
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:17,777
We will succeed.
We will fight and we will succeed.

310
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:19,941
You have to believe me.

311
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:23,744
- We will succeed.
- Stop, stop, stop, stop!

312
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:30,252
As soon as we do that, I'll go
to the jungle, join the guerrillas...

313
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,422
Son of a bitch, it's Escobar.

314
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:35,762
We have to get you and the kids
out of the country.

315
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,662
And listen...

316
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:43,334
I will not rest until that happens.

317
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:46,809
Alvaro, drive slowly.
Park up ahead.

318
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:52,607
I only have one notebook.
Let me go get it.

319
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,314
The helicopters are triangulating
that area, correct?

320
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:00,858
Yes, Colonel, just in this area.

321
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:02,290
- Very well.
- Excuse me, Colonel.

322
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,022
Lieutenant Martinez is on channel four.

323
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:09,328
All right, excuse me. Thank you.

324
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:12,661
Go ahead, Lieutenant.

325
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:14,136
Colonel, I found him.

326
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,140
Who? Escobar?

327
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:18,673
Yes, Colonel.

328
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,336
He's in Los Olivos.

329
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,940
Son, are you sure? We can't afford
the luxury of making another mistake.

330
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,219
I'm sure. I saw him.

331
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,688
What do you mean you saw him?

332
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:37,894
Yes, he looked out a window.
He's got a beard now, but it's him.

333
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,823
And did he see you?

334
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:43,632
No, I don't think so.

335
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:47,472
Listen up, Lieutenant.

336
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:50,031
There's still some men
in the staging area.

337
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:53,702
I need you to wait until they get to you.
Understood?

338
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:55,971
Copy that, Colonel.

339
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,982
One more thing. Be safe.
Over and out.

340
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,581
- Fix the position.
- Right away.

341
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:06,855
Hello, Dad.

342
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:08,757
How's it going, son?

343
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,395
You wanted to ask me something or what?

344
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:13,726
Yes, sir.

345
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:16,233
What wish did you make
for your birthday?

346
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:19,770
If I tell you, it won't come true.
Right?

347
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,904
Tell me! Don't be like that!

348
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,408
Well, the only thing that I can tell you

349
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,911
is that it was a very good wish.

350
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:28,877
You know,

351
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:31,416
you deserve the best birthday
in the world.

352
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,063
Thank you, my love.

353
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:49,734
Captain.

354
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:52,429
- Captain, can you hear me?
- Yes, Colonel?

355
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:54,904
How many men are left
in the provisional base?

356
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:57,772
- Counting me, about 12.
- Listen up.

357
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,777
- Lieutenant Martinez found Escobar.
- Shit! Let's go!

358
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:05,373
Everybody to Los Olives!

359
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,077
Hello.

360
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:11,555
Hello, my little princess.
How's my little girl?

361
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:12,590
Good.

362
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:16,457
I've got your little rabbit here.
He's getting very fat.

363
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:28,571
Perez!

364
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,406
Attention! Two groups. Captain, Sergeant
in the back, and I'll take the front.

365
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:33,501
This is the house.

366
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:37,440
Get your mom on the phone, okay?

367
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,175
Pablo.

368
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:42,652
- Do you have the questions?
- Yes, my love, I've got them here.

369
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:45,752
The first one
is from a Spanish journalist.

370
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:50,359
How do you feel after
all these days on the run?

371
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,661
Write this down.

372
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,032
It's been very hard
being far from my family,

373
00:38:58,136 --> 00:39:01,037
who I love more than anything
in the world.

374
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:04,541
- Sergeant, go around.
- But I feel good.

375
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,167
I feel strong.

376
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:11,044
And I have the will to fight
all of these injustices.

377
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:15,780
The government has made a mockery
of our rights.

378
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:22,860
It's allowed our justice system
to become corrupted by murderers.

379
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:27,661
The people of Colombia deserve
much better than that.

380
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,965
The government
is holding my family hostage.

381
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,371
That's a crime against human rights
committed by a government

382
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:42,572
that calls itself democratic.

383
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,180
My little kids are innocent children

384
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:50,711
that have nothing to do
with their father's problems.

385
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:59,489
All we want from the government

386
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:02,499
is that they bring those killers,
Los Pepes, to justice.

387
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:08,700
But above else, that they allow my family
to leave the country immediately.

388
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:10,935
Without that...

389
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,504
One moment.

390
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,378
What happened, Pablo?

391
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:24,287
Something strange is happening here.
I'll call you back.

392
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:26,922
Pablo. Pablo.

393
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:30,120
Pablo. Pablo, don't hang up.

394
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,196
Pablo, what's going on?

395
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,524
What's wrong, Mom?

396
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,063
Go on. All right.

397
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,309
Go! Go!

398
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,740
Let's go!

399
00:40:57,155 --> 00:41:00,147
Let's go! Come on! Come on!

400
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:01,316
Come on!

401
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,325
Come on! Move, move, move!

402
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,270
Go, go, go!

403
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:22,841
Move!

404
00:41:23,448 --> 00:41:24,472
Go!

405
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:26,347
Keep going!

406
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:04,485
Nobody shoot! Nobody shoot!

407
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,478
Sergeant Sarmiento!

408
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:34,347
You just shot Pablo Escobar!

409
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,220
Is he alive?

410
00:42:36,821 --> 00:42:38,255
<i>All that time hunting him...</i>

411
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:42,891
<i>and just like that, I'm looking
down at Pablo fucking Escobar.</i>

412
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:47,521
<i>For years I'd been building
this son of a bitch up in my head.</i>

413
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:50,863
<i>What a monster he'd be.</i>

414
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:53,235
<i>But here's the thing.</i>

415
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:57,103
<i>When you lay eyes on him,
the devil's a real letdown.</i>

416
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,232
<i>Just a man.</i>

417
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,004
<i>Beard grows if he doesn't shave.</i>

418
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,847
<i>Fat and shoeless.</i>

419
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,782
<i>You take a good long look at evil,
and it reminds you of one...</i>

420
00:43:17,228 --> 00:43:18,855
Long live Colombia.

421
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,429
- Long live Colombia!
- Long live!

422
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:23,466
We killed Pablo Escobar!

423
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:26,401
- Long live! Long live!
- Long live Colombia!

424
00:43:26,471 --> 00:43:29,805
- Long live Colombia!
- Long live Colombia!

425
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,064
Go ahead.

426
00:44:00,238 --> 00:44:04,607
They killed Pablo Escobar!

427
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:34,028
My son! My son...

428
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:40,390
I pray to God that other mothers

429
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:44,560
don't have to experience
the pain that I'm feeling.

430
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,502
And I know my son wasn't as bad
as they made him out to be.

431
00:46:47,605 --> 00:46:50,631
I know that they blamed him
for anything bad that happened.

432
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:52,835
I want the good things he did
to be remembered,

433
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:55,241
because he didn't do the bad things
they say he did.

434
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:58,476
He built playing fields.
He built a neighborhood for the poor.

435
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:00,516
No one has paid attention to that.

436
00:47:00,618 --> 00:47:04,748
As a son,
there will never be anyone better.

437
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:08,452
He was the noblest of men.
Not just as a son...

438
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:40,453
Sit down, ma'am. Sit.

439
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,889
Thank you.

440
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:49,894
Talk to me.

441
00:47:52,837 --> 00:47:55,499
Before he died,
my husband told me to find you.

442
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,642
He told you that?

443
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:05,081
He told me that despite the fact
that you became enemies,

444
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:07,207
you were once associates and friends.

445
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:16,220
You were saying?

446
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:22,423
He told me that you were a decent man.
That you would understand the situation.

447
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:26,061
That you would forgive us.

448
00:48:27,538 --> 00:48:30,064
And that you might help us
get out of the country.

449
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:35,744
How much do you have left,
Mrs. Escobar?

450
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:38,406
In property? In cash?

451
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,449
I can find out.

452
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:49,617
That's good.

453
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:52,362
Because I want all of it.

454
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,895
Sir, do I need a lawyer?

455
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:37,271
You're the review board, right?

456
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:42,068
Professional conduct or some bullshit?

457
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,116
We're not the review board.

458
00:49:49,854 --> 00:49:51,015
So who are you?

459
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:55,247
We're from Operations.

460
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,520
What do you want from me?

461
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:04,966
All right, gentlemen!

462
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:06,628
Gentlemen!

463
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:12,768
In the history of every business,
there are decisive moments.

464
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,709
In 1992, do you know how much cocaine

465
00:50:14,812 --> 00:50:17,008
we estimated came into the US
from Colombia?

466
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:20,678
311 metric tons.

467
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:25,984
The first sale. The first million.
The first billion.

468
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:29,993
And when your rival no longer exists.

469
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:38,033
And in 1993, during the hunt for Escobar,
372 metric tons.

470
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:40,570
Now that piece of shit is on his last leg.

471
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:42,662
Every one of his labs has been shut down.

472
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,072
And cocaine production goes up.

473
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:48,236
The important thing in these moments
isn't how one reacts,

474
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:50,677
but how well one has prepared for them.

475
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:55,083
Gentlemen, I have to tell you
that we are ready.

476
00:50:55,853 --> 00:50:57,844
Can you imagine what happens next year?

477
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:02,992
And we won't be needing
kidnappings and bombs to succeed.

478
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,360
We will do it covertly.

479
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:09,229
And when they turn around
to see what happened,

480
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:10,664
we'll no longer be there.

481
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,498
No, sir!

482
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,902
