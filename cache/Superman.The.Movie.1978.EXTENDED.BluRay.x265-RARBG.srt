Well, not yet, thank goodness.

No, I don't, but if I did, Miss Lane,
you'd be the first to know about it.

Um, how old are you?

- Over 21.
- Oh, I get it.

You don't want anyone to
know how old... Okay.

How big are you? How tall are you?

Yes. Yes, I do. When I'm hungry.

You do. Of course you do.

Well. Well, then, is it true...

...that you can see through anything?

Yes, I can. Well, pretty much.

impervious to pain?

made of lead.

hard to explain, actually.
