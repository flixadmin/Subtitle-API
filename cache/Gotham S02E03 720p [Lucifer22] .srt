1
00:00:00,968 --> 00:00:02,668
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,237 --> 00:00:05,170
Monsters are coming, Mr. Mayor.

3
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:06,471
(man screaming)

4
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:08,207
ESSEN:
<i>Six criminally insane inmates</i>

5
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:10,075
<i>busted out of Arkham Asylum.</i>

6
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:11,777
(cheerleaders screaming)

7
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:13,619
GORDON:
<i>They want mass panic.</i>

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,650
(cheerleaders screaming)
BARBARA: Hello, Jim.

9
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:19,985
How do I look?

10
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:21,520
GORDON:
Barbara!

11
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,682
Yo, Commish.
Yeah.

12
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:25,724
(laughs)

13
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:28,160
GORDON: Don't move!
(Aaron yells)

14
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:29,995
BARBARA:<i> You should probably</i>
<i>get back to work.</i>

15
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:32,798
Who knows what went wrong
while you were gone? (gasps)

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,835
(weakly):
It's a new day, Jim.

17
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:42,007
(screaming)

18
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:46,245
(groans)

19
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:47,846
(coughs)

20
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,357
Jerome Valeska.

21
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:01,693
The attack on the GCPD.

22
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:03,695
Someone on the streets
is talking.

23
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,498
Somebody knows something.

24
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,467
Valeska has red hair,
crazy laugh.

25
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:10,168
Might be rolling
with a blonde number.

26
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,504
I-I don't know anything.

27
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:14,606
Honest!
You believe him?

28
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:15,240
Nope.

29
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:16,441
Me neither.

30
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,911
It's the truth!
But, hey,

31
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:23,081
I-I can help you guys, you know,
spread the word and stuff.

32
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,383
Valeska killed a friend of ours.

33
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:26,551
Anybody hides him,

34
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:27,686
anybody protects him,

35
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,721
they go down, too, you got it?

36
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,124
Now spread the word.

37
00:01:32,126 --> 00:01:33,126
No! No!

38
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,711
BARBARA:
Sneaking out?

39
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,247
Just like a guy.

40
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:58,216
There are loose ends
that need tying.

41
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,818
Need this?

42
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:11,430
Bring back bagels.

43
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:13,899
THEO:
No need for that.

44
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:16,101
I thought Ms. Kean and I
could have a little chat.

45
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:17,569
Good morning.

46
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,271
Jerome is waiting outside.

47
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:22,574
Try and keep
him focused.

48
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,919
(chuckles softly)

49
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,757
You be nice.

50
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:42,728
You two seem to be
getting along.

51
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,162
I'm so glad.

52
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,565
She needs a friend.

53
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:50,001
My sister is a very
special person.

54
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:54,106
She seems so strong,
but yet she's quite fragile.

55
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:55,307
Sugar?

56
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:57,209
Sure.

57
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:59,478
You acquitted
yourself very well

58
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,947
at the adventure
at the GCPD.

59
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:05,884
Jim Gordon escaped
the carnage unscathed.

60
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:07,152
Top marks.

61
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:08,954
Thank you.

62
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,924
Did you know
my family built this city?

63
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:17,028
We carved the bedrock
upon which it stands,

64
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,065
yet there is not a bridge,
an alley,

65
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:21,800
a ditch that carries our name.

66
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,037
My forefathers were betrayed,
their legacy erased,

67
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,107
and I am here to punish those
who wronged us

68
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,143
and reclaim what is ours.

69
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:35,080
Strawberry?

70
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,083
I didn't ask.

71
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:40,352
So you're gonna
take over Gotham by unleashing

72
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:42,421
a bunch of loonies.
Awesome plan.

73
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,423
That's only part one.

74
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:46,258
So what's
the second part?

75
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,526
Oh, you're gonna love it.

76
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:48,927
There's a starring
role for you.

77
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:51,430
You'll be famous
and powerful,

78
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,265
and your fondest dream
will come true.

79
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,767
You know my dreams, do you?

80
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:58,904
When Jim Gordon has outlived
his usefulness,

81
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,206
I'm gonna help you destroy him.

82
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:03,141
Not kill him.

83
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:05,544
Destroy him.

84
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,979
Body and soul.

85
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:12,117
(gunfire, people screaming)

86
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,185
Bang.

87
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:14,786
(cackling)

88
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,855
Shocking images. Gotham is
on high alert today after...

89
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,723
BULLOCK: Look, I'm just saying,
I'll chuck mopes out of windows

90
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,725
until the cows come home,
but at some point,

91
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,127
we got to go see Penguin.

92
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,062
Why would he break
Jerome out of Arkham

93
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,263
or attack the GCPD?

94
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,065
He wouldn't, but that weasel's
running things now.

95
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,267
If there's chatter,
he'd know it.
I'll think about it.

96
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,869
Jim...
I'll think about it!

97
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,205
Alvarez, where are you
with Jerome's circus contacts?

98
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:35,307
Circus is upstate.
I'm just waiting...
Follow up.

99
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:37,809
His father's probably with him.
He covered for him once before.

100
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,511
He might have
some information.

101
00:04:39,513 --> 00:04:41,346
Do it. Yo, Detective!

102
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,181
Which escapee
are you tracking?

103
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:44,216
Helzinger.

104
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:46,418
No one's seen him.
He's six-seven, 275,

105
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,719
with the mind
of a five-year-old.

106
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:48,987
Somebody's seen him.

107
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:51,723
Hey!

108
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:54,059
What are you doing?

109
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:56,761
That stays up until we have
her killer in custody.

110
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,964
You understand?
Yes, sir.

111
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:04,369
Sarah Essen
and nine of your brothers

112
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:07,205
were killed in this house.

113
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,908
In our house!

114
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,577
Their murderer stood right
there, and he laughed at us.

115
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:17,549
Never forget that.

116
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,220
What?!

117
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:24,556
THOMPKINS:
So how are you?

118
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:26,224
GORDON:
I'm fine.

119
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:27,959
Really?

120
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,596
Look, I know Essen
was your friend.

121
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,732
Lee, whatever
you're about to say,

122
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,367
I know it's coming
from a good place,

123
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:36,868
but I can't hear it right now.

124
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:44,543
So, the Gotham Children's
Hospital gala is tonight,

125
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,545
which I helped
organize.

126
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:47,879
I can't.

127
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:49,848
You can't go?
No.

128
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,250
Even though a few hours
away from all of this

129
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:53,418
might actually help?

130
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,819
Lee.

131
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,855
Okay. I just have
to tell you something,

132
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,790
because if I don't
and you find out,

133
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,225
you're gonna be pissed.

134
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:04,062
There's gonna be a magician.

135
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:10,135
(chuckling)

136
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,470
Yeah. Right.

137
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,039
Stop beating yourself up.

138
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,041
I'm trying.
I know you are.

139
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:18,443
I should have been here.
I wasn't.

140
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:19,911
Stop it.

141
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:20,979
Kiss me.

142
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,116
Kiss me.

143
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:29,154
(sighs)

144
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,124
Better?

145
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,766
(clears throat)

146
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,802
Not to interrupt your
weirdly timed make-out session,

147
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:46,237
but Alvarez got in touch
with the circus manager.

148
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,440
The blind fortune teller,
Jerome's dad,

149
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:50,208
bailed on him, stayed in town.

150
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,242
Got an address.

151
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:53,545
I'll call you.

152
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:55,013
Okay.

153
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,933
Who's there?

154
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,703
I know someone's there.

155
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:21,706
(grunting softly)

156
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,842
Hi-ya, Pops.

157
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:27,278
Long time... no see.

158
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,714
(laughing)

159
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,790
JEROME:
So, how you doing?

160
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,059
Ah, the silent
treatment, eh?

161
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,461
Here, I'll tell
you a story.

162
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,630
Hmm. Oh.

163
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,433
You remember
Kansas City, Dad?

164
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:51,469
The circus went through
town every spring

165
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,872
right around my birthday.

166
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,909
There was this guy.

167
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:01,913
Him and my mom used to
drink and fornicate

168
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,782
and beat the crap
out of me.

169
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:06,818
They'd make a whole
night out of it.

170
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,821
And I remember
one time--

171
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,990
it was my ninth
birthday--

172
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,592
him and my mom
had just finished

173
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,328
round one of boozing, boning,
beating up Jerome,

174
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,664
and were deciding
to take a little break.

175
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,032
Anyway...

176
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,535
Mm.

177
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:27,505
I was outside the trailer,
and you were there.

178
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,307
And you said,

179
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,443
"Why are you crying,

180
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:33,912
Jerome?"

181
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,014
"It's my birthday. (sobs softly)

182
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,650
And my mom and the snake guy
are beating me."

183
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,051
And then you said,

184
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:42,954
"This world doesn't care
about you

185
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,690
"or anyone else, Jerome.

186
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,460
Better to realize that now."

187
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,665
And that was it.

188
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,900
You see, there's this guy, Dad.

189
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,102
He believes in me.

190
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:59,070
He thinks I'm
gonna be a star.

191
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:04,275
And, tonight, all of Gotham
will see that, too.

192
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,010
Except for you.

193
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,579
'Cause you'll be,
you know, dead.

194
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,581
Jerome...
Is this the part
where you say

195
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,816
how sorry you are? Hmm?

196
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,384
How you should have
believed in me,

197
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,386
how it's not too late
to start again?

198
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,956
News flash, Dad:
it's too late.

199
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,125
You don't have to do this.

200
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,026
No.

201
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,828
I'm pretty sure I do.

202
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,298
I was a bad father,
but I did love you.

203
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,734
To kill me for that...

204
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,870
(cackling)

205
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:36,074
That's not why
I'm gonna kill you.

206
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,779
Plans to Arkham Asylum.

207
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,347
Look at these.

208
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,816
Ah.

209
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:47,685
Letters between you
and your troubled son.

210
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,888
Innocent at first glance,
but Detective Gordon--

211
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,422
you remember him, right?--

212
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:55,160
he'll feel little bumps.

213
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:57,695
A secret message
written in Braille

214
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:01,966
between you and your son,
discussing my escape.

215
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:08,206
Finally, the knockout gas
used to disable the orderlies.

216
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,909
'Cause, you see, Dad,

217
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:13,278
this guy I was
telling you about,

218
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,547
he's the one who
broke me out of Arkham.

219
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:17,916
He doesn't want anyone
to know about that.

220
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,484
Obviously. So...

221
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:23,621
the police will find
these letters, mmm,

222
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,391
and they'll think,

223
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:30,028
"The blind old fool
really loved his son.

224
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,463
What a wonderful
father." Oh.

225
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,233
There won't be a dry eye
in the house.

226
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,802
They'll never believe it.

227
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,471
Ah, sure, they will.
Cops are dumb.

228
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,073
There's nothing to eat
in this dump.

229
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,208
Finish up and let's go.

230
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,909
JEROME:
Sorry you're gonna miss

231
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:47,011
my big night, Dad.

232
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,948
But, hey,
you're psychic.

233
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,449
So, tell me,

234
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,151
do I kill?

235
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,086
You...

236
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:57,522
will be a curse upon Gotham.

237
00:10:57,524 --> 00:11:00,725
Children will wake
from sleeps screaming

238
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,560
at the thought of you.

239
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:03,895
Your legacy

240
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:08,333
will be death and madness.

241
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,738
Ha, ha, ha.

242
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,574
Well...

243
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,409
say hi to Mom for me.

244
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,711
(knocking)

245
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:21,946
GORDON:
GCPD!

246
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,988
GCPD!

247
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,290
Mr. Cicero,
it's Detective Gordon.

248
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:35,860
We need to speak with you
about your son.

249
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,463
Mr. Cicero?

250
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:39,898
(muffled scream)

251
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,432
Mr. Cicero?!

252
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,575
Harvey, window!

253
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,084
(gas hissing)

254
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:06,024
Harvey?

255
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:08,559
(coughing)

256
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:16,968
(ears ringing, heart beating)

257
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,170
(whistling a tune)

258
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:24,676
JEROME:
Detective Gordon.

259
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:25,743
Old pal.

260
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,625
That gas sure packs
a wallop, huh?
(grunts)

261
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,383
That's cute.

262
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:38,890
(choking)

263
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,792
I'm sensing anger.

264
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,660
You killed Sarah Essen.

265
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:45,430
Now I'm gonna kill you.

266
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,098
(chuckling)

267
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,367
Don't shoot him.

268
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,839
How about a little
flesh wound?

269
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:57,542
No, no.

270
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:59,077
My dibs.

271
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,582
("Dirty Boogie" by the
Brian Setzer Orchestra playing)

272
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,661
(lively chatter)

273
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,232
This is a waste
of time.

274
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:24,635
We had a deal,
didn't we, Master Bruce?

275
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,238
Part of which was you resume
your normal lifestyle.

276
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,907
Your parents were both patrons
to the Children's Hospital.

277
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,744
Therefore,
it makes you a patron.

278
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:36,114
Besides...

279
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,416
there's gonna
be a magician.

280
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:41,486
And you like
magicians, don't you?

281
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,454
No, I don't.

282
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:44,956
I hate magicians.

283
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,058
You know what I said
about being normal?

284
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,293
Excuse me.

285
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,695
I'm Lee Thompkins.

286
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:52,163
I work with
James Gordon.

287
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,165
He's mentioned you,
and I saw you and thought...

288
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,000
Of course. It's very
nice to meet you.

289
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,735
Nice to meet you.
This is my guardian,

290
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:58,936

It's an absolute pleasure.

292

Thank you.
How is Detective
Gordon doing

since the attack
on the precinct?

294
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:05,910

Besides, didn't I steal

320

00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:46,077
So you want
to share your plan?

333
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,179
Remember I told you
I could divine

334
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,381
the thing a person
truly wants?

335
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:53,885
What Gotham wants is a hero.

336
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:54,986
And tonight...

337
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:57,989
I'm going to give them one.

338
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:59,457
Shall we?

339
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,125
Jerome and Tabby
went on ahead.

340
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,327
Great cape.

341
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,398
Thank you for filling in
on such short notice.

342
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,468
But how did you hear
our magician dropped out, Mr...?

343
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,303
Rodolfo.

344
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,338
Well, you know, magic.

345
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,339
(both chuckle)

346
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:18,709
Oh, I won't be needing that.

347
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,245
(muffled grunting)

348
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,752
MAN: Come on.
I'm sorry, but really,

349
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,086
there is no mystery.

350
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:32,957
Tabitha, have you met
Deputy Mayor Kane?

351
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,593
Harrison,
this is my Tabitha.

352
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:36,594
Ah, nice to meet you.

353
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:39,263
Uh, and could you please
tell your brother

354
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,599
that when a handsome billionaire
appears out of nowhere,

355
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:42,667
people get curious.

356
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:43,935
Where'd he come from?

357
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:45,503
How'd he make his money?

358
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,637
Who's he dating?

359
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,839
My wife would kill me if
I don't get something--

360
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,741
a-a tidbit.

361
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:54,178
He's a monster in the sack.

362
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:59,884
Do you have any news
of Mayor James?

363
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:01,319
No.

364
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:02,687
No, it's a real mystery.

365
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,689
We don't know where he is.

366
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,557
How intriguing.

367
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,227
Harrison, would you mind?
A little family business.

368
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:11,229
Of course.
Ms. Galavant.

369
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:17,368
Everything's ready.

370
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,337
See you at home.

371
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:25,309
So, uh, how do you go from

372
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,811
being in the Royal Marines
to a butler?

373
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28,980
Well, it's a bit tedious,
really, after a while.

374
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:31,549
You know, parachuting into one
global hot spot after another.

375
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,819
Warlords putting ridiculous
bounties on your head.

376
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,754
Gets a bit boring, really.

377
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:38,322
You have amazing stories.

378
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,204
Yeah, well, you know,
one or two.

379
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:44,462
You know, I don't really
get nights off,

380
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,864
but if ever you'd like
to pop by Wayne Manor

381
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:47,932
for dinner one evening, I...

382
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:50,534
Oh, that's very kind of you,
Mr. Pennyworth, but...

383
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:51,535
No.

384
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,038
Alfred. Please. Alfred.

385
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,374
Alfred.
That's very kind of you, but...

386
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:58,376
Now, having said that,
I don't see why I can't

387
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:01,112
take a night off, and
I... I happen to know

388
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:03,648
the head chef at Chez Parnes.

389
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,182
Well, I-I'm afraid I...

390
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,918
Did you say Chez Parnes?

391
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,323
I've been trying to eat there
for quite some time.

392
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:14,525
You have the most
beautiful eyes.

393
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:15,926
Oh, wow.

394
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,295
Okay, well, thank you,

395
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:18,296
but, uh...

396
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:19,864
Alfred, I'd
like to leave.

397
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:22,233
Yeah, um...

398
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:23,668
What about Dr. Thompkins' water?

399
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,070
And, of course, you're gonna
miss the magician.

400
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:28,239
Sorry, I must have
forgotten your water.

401
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:29,373
Alfred, I still
want to leave.

402
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,042
Are you not
feeling well?

403
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:32,777
Oh, n-no, he's-he's
absolutely fine. He's fine.

404
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,679
Why don't you just
pop off to the bar,

405
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:35,980
Master Bruce, and...

406
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,481
(quietly):
Show's about to start.

407
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:38,382
Is it time?

408
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:42,119
I roped myself into
emcee duties for the night.

409
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,754
I hope you'll stay
for the show.

410
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:46,290
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

411
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,365
What?

412
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,766
(music ends, applause)

413
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,671
Good evening.

414
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,141
I'm Dr. Lee Thompkins.

415
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,077
For the past five years,

416
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,246
I've had the honor of being
part of the Children's Hospital.

417
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,915
Thank you for your support.

418
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,150
And thank you so much
for coming out tonight.

419
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,619
Over the years,
we've had magicians

420
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,388
come and entertain
our children.

421
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:21,292
And so tonight, we have one of
the magicians here for you.

422
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:22,660
Without further ado,

423
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,696
please allow me
to present to you

424
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,064
the Great Rodolfo.

425
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,333
(music playing, applause)

426
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,242
(gasps)

427
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,484
(yawns)

428
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:47,585
(laughter)

429
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,254
Ha!

430
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,498
Greetings, ladies and germs!

431
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,834
I am indeed the Great Rodolfo.

432
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:09,073
Please ogle my
lovely assistant.

433
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,775
Ooh!

434
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:13,778
(laughs)

435
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:21,118
(drumroll)

436
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:46,110
For my first act,
I'll require a volunteer.

437
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:47,778
Let me see.

438
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,581
Duck, duck,

439
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,883
duck, duck, duck, duck, duck...

440
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:54,885
goose!

441
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:03,761
Go on, Master Bruce.

442
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,830
Be a sport.

443
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,660
Don't keep the
lady waiting.

444
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,105
Fine.

445
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,208
(applause)

446
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,715
Hello, young man.

447
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:36,527
Does this

448
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,262
handsome gentleman have a name?

449
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:41,265
Bruce.
Bruce!

450
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:45,936
Well, Bruce, this
won't hurt a bit.

451
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:49,673
Is there a doctor in the house?

452
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,075
(laughter)

453
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:52,743
No, just... Excuse...

454
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:53,744
Just wait! Wait!

455
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:55,246
Wait one second!

456
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,686
Go home.

457
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,421
I'm fine.

458
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,690
You've been running this
since last night,

459
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:09,293
and you got a face
full of that gas. Go home.

460
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:11,262
You going home?

461
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:13,097
(sighs)

462
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,566
I didn't think so.

463
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,537
(groans):
Oh.

464
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:21,338
Maybe I will go
get some sleep.

465
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,573
Yeah? Good idea.

466
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:24,475
But we got somewhere, right?

467
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:26,810
At least now we know
who broke Jerome out of Arkham.

468
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:30,614
Yeah. Crazy old blind man
that lived alone.

469
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:33,617
The<i> clever</i> crazy
old blind man.

470
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:37,388
If his father broke him out,
why'd Jerome kill him, huh?

471
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,989
He was probably
playing this maniac shtick

472
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:40,190
since you sent him away.

473
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,526
He was just a kid.

474
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:46,964
Every evil bastard in the world
was just a kid once.

475
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,866
Yeah.

476
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,902
But I don't think it was
his father that broke him out.

477
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,005
(chuckles):
Well, cool.

478
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:56,473
Back to square one.

479
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,809
All right, I will go
and get some sleep.

480
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:00,444
For the record,

481
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:02,813
I knew Essen
a hell of a lot longer than you.

482
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:05,916
She saved my ass
hundreds of times.

483
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,952
You really should go home.

484
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:11,488
First thing tomorrow,
we'll go see Penguin.

485
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,358
You're right.

486
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,727
He's got his ears on the street.

487
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,996
Jim.

488
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:24,134
Never mind.

489
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,637
I'll see you tomorrow.

490
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:32,343
(fanfare plays,
laughter, applause)

491
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:36,880
Give 'em a wave.

492
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,449
(laughs)

493
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,789
(rim shot)

494
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:46,890
(applause)

495
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:54,164
Some people say
Bruce has a split personality.

496
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,799
(laughter)

497
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:01,472
Very good, Master Bruce.

498
00:24:01,474 --> 00:24:03,641
(blows kiss)

499
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:07,211
(microphone feedback hums)

500
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:08,746
For my next illusion,

501
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:13,217
I'd like to call to the stage
esteemed Deputy Mayor

502
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:15,386
Harrison Kane.

503
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:24,628
Is there something familiar
to you about those two?

504
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,074
Oh, my God.

505
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,983
(phone ringing)

506
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,286
Lee, I was just...

507
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:50,554
Jim, it's Barbara.

508
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,356
She's here.
And-and I think maybe Jerome...

509
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:53,791
(muffled groan)

510
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:10,107
By the way, nobody here...

511
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:12,976
is getting out alive.

512
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,845
(laughter)

513
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,249
(crowd gasps)

514
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,453
(groans)

515
00:25:22,455 --> 00:25:25,122
(crowd murmuring, screaming)

516
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:27,124
(Jerome cackling)

517
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:30,394
Right, Master Bruce,
time to leave.

518
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:32,596
Ta-da!

519
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:38,135
(screaming continues)

520
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,777
(laughing)

521
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:50,614
(laughing)

522
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:58,989
Selina!
Bruce!

523
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:01,825
(Jerome cackling)

524
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:04,027
(panicked chatter, screaming)

525
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:11,535
(Jerome continues cackling)

526
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:18,175
(tires screeching)

527
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:22,613
(sirens wailing)

528
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:26,917
You! What's going on?

529
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,051
Hostage situation.

530
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,133
The magician just killed
the deputy mayor.

531
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,689
It's Jerome Valeska,

532
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,558
the same man that killed
Commissioner Essen.

533
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,926
Who's in charge here?

534
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,561
I guess you are.

535
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:39,763
(phone ringing)

536
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:43,100
Lee.

537
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:44,701
Thank God.
I've been trying to...

538
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,137
JEROME: Sorry, Jimbo.
It's just little old me.

539
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:49,173
Jerome.

540
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:50,674
Are you outside?

541
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:52,409
(gasps)
You are, aren't you?

542
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:53,744
(laughs):
Oh, goody!

543
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:55,946
I swear to God,
if you've hurt her...

544
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,247
Breathe, James.

545
00:26:57,249 --> 00:27:00,417
I haven't touched a hair on
your girlfriend's pretty head.

546
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:01,985
See for yourself.

547
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,987
(over speakers): This is
live television after all.

548
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,824
(Jerome laughs)

549
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,633
(Jerome laughing)

550
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,901
The feed just came back.

551
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:21,572
(Jerome imitates explosion,
laughs)

552
00:27:21,574 --> 00:27:23,273
You son of a bitch.

553
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:24,975
True, but not the point.

554
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,877
Hey, let's talk
about what I want.

555
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:29,439
Excuse me.
(clears throat)

556
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:33,650
$47 million,
a helicopter, obviously,

557
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,752
the dry cleaning
I left at Mr. Chang's--

558
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,588
be careful, the man is a crook--

559
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:40,591
and, mm, I don't know, a pony.

560
00:27:40,593 --> 00:27:41,992
(laughs) Uh...

561
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,561
You got ten minutes,
or I start killing people.

562
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:46,096
Remember,
this is being broadcast

563
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:49,933
to every home in Gotham,
so, you know,

564
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:51,702
don't let people die. Bye.

565
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:54,638
(cackling)

566
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,641
(cackling continues)

567
00:27:58,611 --> 00:28:00,410
I think that went well.

568
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:01,745
THEO:
Enough!

569
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:04,848
You need to pack up

570
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,784
your pathetic little sideshow
and leave.

571
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,386
Is that right?

572
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:14,124
It may be presumptuous to speak
for all the citizens of Gotham.

573
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:16,793
But we are sick of you!

574
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,228
You're a small,

575
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,732
vicious man with a pathetic
need for attention.

576
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:24,835
Enough, man.

577
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:28,071
For God's sakes, enough.

578
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:32,209
I'm curious what your
leverage is here, Mr...?

579
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:35,479
Theo Galavan.

580
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:37,981
Well, Mr. Theo Galavan,

581
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:39,483
if you don't sit down,

582
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:42,185
uh, I'm going
to shoot you.

583
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:44,388
In the face.

584
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,291
I know there is some
human decency left in you.

585
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:50,227
If you need to take
a hostage, take me.

586
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:54,431
But let these people go
home to their families,

587
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:55,832
to their children.

588
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,734
(crowd gasps)

589
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,703
BARBARA:
Boring.

590
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:01,939
JEROME:
Right?

591
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:04,675
Get your men.
We're going in.

592
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,420
I used this
to sneak into the party.

593
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,388
We're lucky those dummies
didn't know about it.

594
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,123
Wait.
We're almost outside.

595
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,392
Wait. I have to go back.

596
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:24,895
Are you crazy?
That guy was killing people!

597
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:26,129
Yes, and Alfred's back there.

598
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:28,699
I'm not going back.

599
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:30,600
I don't expect you to.

600
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:34,071
Selina...

601
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,240
I miss you.

602
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:40,110
I just wanted
to say that.

603
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:50,354
(sirens wailing,
helicopter whirring)

604
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,260
You're refusing a direct order?
I could have your stripes.

605
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:58,328
That maniac killed
the commissioner.

606
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,198
Not my men.
We're not equipped for this.

607
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:05,335
Fine. I'll go it alone.

608
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:09,639
(sighs)

609
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,174
Oh.

610
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:14,177
Hold very still.

611
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,380
(breathes slowly)

612
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,619
Oh.

613
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:23,620
I can't look.

614
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:26,182
Someone tell me
how it turns out.

615
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:30,527
(toy gun squeaks, crowd gasps)

616
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:32,662
(laughs)

617
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,998
Damn!

618
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,400
Turn around.

619
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:42,139
(crowd gasps, Barbara whoops)

620
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,776
Well, clap!

621
00:30:45,778 --> 00:30:47,811
(applause)

622
00:30:47,813 --> 00:30:50,814
(laughs) Ooh!

623
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:53,383
So, Lee, how's Jim doing?

624
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:55,652
I hope he's not
blaming himself

625
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:57,954
for this whole
Essen being killed thing.

626
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,990
You are one crazy bitch.

627
00:30:59,992 --> 00:31:02,325
So rude.

628
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:05,062
You know, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna make a prediction.

629
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:06,630
(grunts):
Ow!

630
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:09,866
Within a year, Jim and I
will be back together.

631
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,134
(giggles)

632
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:12,536
Want to know why?

633
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:15,705
Because we're both the same.

634
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,475
We both have a dark side.

635
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:21,545
And one day, we will tell
our grandchildren

636
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:26,550
about how this man-eating harpy
almost tore us apart!

637
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,285
But in the end,

638
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:30,620
love conquered all. (giggles)

639
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:33,323
You...
I'm sorry. What's that?

640
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,661
(grunts)

641
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,696
Hasn't been ten minutes.
I need to buy you a watch.

642
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,466
(crowd gasps)

643
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,136
Well...

644
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:49,139
I think it's time for tonight's
first official victim,

645
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:53,810
you all know and love,
poor rich boy,

646
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:59,249
parents murdered in an alley,
and my favorite volunteer.

647
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:03,753
Where is... Bruce Wayne?!

648
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,395
You know I'm an orphan, too,
Bruce?

649
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:15,132
I killed my
parents though.

650
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:18,502
Where are you hiding?

651
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,205
Bruce!

652
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:24,641
Where are you, buddy?

653
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:26,510
Kill his butler.

654
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:31,081
MAN:
Come on, move it, butler.

655
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:32,649
(gun clicks)

656
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,953
JEROME:
All right.

657
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,256
Last chance, Bruce,
but it's about to get

658
00:32:39,258 --> 00:32:41,791
very butler brainy out here.

659
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:48,431
D-Detective Gordon.

660
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:51,935
He's going to kill Alfred.
I have to help him.

661
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:53,577
(singsongy):
Brucey!

662
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:58,341
No. It's you he wants.

663
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:01,545
Bruce, just wants you.

664
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:07,484
I will not let him hurt Alfred.

665
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:14,157
JEROME:
I'm bored.

666
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,792
Shoot the butler.

667
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:17,260
Stop!

668
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:19,329
(crowd gasps)

669
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,633
(laughs)

670
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:26,503
What the bloody hell
are you doing, Bruce?

671
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:27,671
There's a gun
in my jacket.

672
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:30,233
Detective Gordon's
behind the curtain.

673
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:33,610
(crowd gasps, gun clicks)

674
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,612
Let's get this
started, huh?

675
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:38,181
You, check behind the curtain;
make sure no one's

676
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:40,016
playing silly buggers. (laughs)

677
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:45,455
(crowd screaming)

678
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:54,030
Drop the knife!

679
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,533
(cackling)

680
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:01,238
I don't have a clean shot!

681
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,006
Stay calm, Bruce.

682
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:04,007
(laughs)

683
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:06,209
Seems like we got ourselves
a pickle.

684
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,711
What do you say, Brucey boy?

685
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:10,146
Want to boost
our ratings, huh?

686
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:11,581
(laughing)

687
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:14,384
Smile.
(laughing)

688
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:18,815
THEO:
I said, enough!

689
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:23,760
(crowd screaming)

690
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:29,032
I know, I know.

691
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:30,634
(gasping weakly)

692
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:35,438
This is not what
we rehearsed.

693
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,540
I'm so sorry, Jerome.

694
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,276
You have real talent.

695
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:41,311
But now, you see,

696
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:43,446
the plot thickens.

697
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:46,683
Enter the hero.

698
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:50,153
(straining):
You said...

699
00:34:50,155 --> 00:34:51,288
I was

700
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:54,491
gonna be...

701
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:03,466
(sighs)

702
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:12,375
Jim!

703
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:13,677
Stop her!

704
00:35:18,517 --> 00:35:19,949
(crowd gasps)

705
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,632
...a pony. (laughs) Uh...

706
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:39,369
See, someone like that has
no interest in building things.

707
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:41,304
He's not part of a tradition.

708
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,972
Hmm?

709
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,709
It's chaos for
chaos sake.

710
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:47,677
(Jerome cackling over TV)

711
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:51,448
Perhaps I could use a new laugh.

712
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,116
(door opens, closes)

713
00:35:53,118 --> 00:35:55,185
BULLOCK (chuckles):
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

714
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:57,354
Huh?

715
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,856
Wow.

716
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:01,591
Dude!

717
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:03,126
Color me impressed.

718
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:04,494
You know,
if I close my eyes,

719
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,896
I can still see you holding
Fish's umbrella.

720
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,065
"Yes, Ms. Mooney.

721
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:12,068
"No, Ms. Mooney.
Whatever you say, Ms. Mooney.

722
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,838
That wig looks great on you,
Ms. Mooney."

723
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,007
Seriously, the worm

724
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,577
has turned.

725
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,113
Detective Bullock.

726
00:36:23,115 --> 00:36:24,981
I heard you rejoined the force.

727
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:30,186
I am so happy.

728
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,055
But aren't you missing

729
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:33,056
all of the excitement?

730
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:34,257
Yeah, I got the word
too late.

731
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:36,593
Besides, I want
to talk to you.

732
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:38,661
Of course.

733
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:40,029
Always happy to help.

734
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,598
See, there's talk
on the street

735
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,633
that Jim Gordon
did a favor for you,

736
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:46,269
collected a debt,
and the guy ended up dead.

737
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:48,571
(laughs)

738
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:50,507
Rumors.

739
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:51,674
(scoffs)

740
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,810
(laughs):
Rumors.

741
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:56,396
Huh.

742
00:36:56,397 --> 00:36:58,981
Well, then again,
where there's smoke...

743
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:04,687
Jim shouldn't
worry about that.

744
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:06,556
He and I are
good friends.

745
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,558
Well, see, that's the problem,
Oswald; I think he is worried.

746
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,093
Because something
happened today,

747
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:11,661
and you were the obvious person
to come to.

748
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:13,897
And I sensed
Jim was a little reluctant

749
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:15,498
to come down here.

750
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,868
Like I said, he shouldn't worry.

751
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:22,038
As long as you two
remain friends.

752
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,873
Exactly.

753
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:26,075
Yeah.

754
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:31,147
I got half a mind to take you
outside and beat you senseless

755
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:32,549
with a garbage can.

756
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:34,684
(guns clicking)

757
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:39,155
Maybe some other time.

758
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:45,995
Call yourself
whatever you want, man!

759
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,397
The King of Gotham.

760
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:51,000
But, to me, you'll always be
that little umbrella boy.

761
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,268
And if you come after

762
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,738
Jim Gordon,
you got to come after me.

763
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,141
And I still owe you for Fish.

764
00:37:58,143 --> 00:38:01,244
But, seriously,

765
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:03,313
this place is amazing.

766
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:04,315
(kisses)

767
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,487
(door opens, closes)

768
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:15,525
Get me another drink!

769
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,607
You were very brave.

770
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:33,076
You helped save the lives
of everyone in here.

771
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:34,911
Your parents,

772
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,012
they would've been proud.

773
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,112
ALFRED:
That they would've been.

774
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:39,516
They also would've
given me the sack

775
00:38:39,518 --> 00:38:42,719
if I let you do
something so idiotic.

776
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:44,487
It was all of us.

777
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,155
We were a team.

778
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,658
Yeah. I guess we were.

779
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:51,394
Is he okay?

780
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:53,162
Fine. Though
I'd still like him

781
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,430
to get checked out
at the hospital.

782
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:55,798
Barbara gave him quite a knock.

783
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,635
Any word on her?

784
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:00,336
No, she went through a trapdoor
in the stage.

785
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,071
They must have
always been planning to use that

786
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,173
as their exit.

787
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,109
Don't worry. We'll find her.

788
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:11,047
Uh, Mr. Galavan, sir.

789
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:12,482
Alfred Pennyworth.

790
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:14,417
I'd just like to thank you
for saving

791
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:16,953
young Master Wayne's life.
Oh.

792
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:19,822
If there's anything
I can ever do for you, sir...

793
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,090
Or I.

794
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:23,092
I really just did

795
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,395
what any citizen of Gotham
would have done.

796
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:27,230
I wish that were true.

797
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,598
Jim Gordon.

798
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,300
Theo.

799
00:39:30,302 --> 00:39:32,135
Well, if you ever
need anything,

800
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:33,503
please, call.

801
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:35,772
We're all in this
together, right?

802
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,442
Thank you, sir.

803
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:43,146
Right, well, I suppose I better
be getting this young man home.

804
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:45,148
It's been much more
of an exciting evening

805
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,282
than originally planned.

806
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:47,984
I never did like magicians.

807
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:49,118
(chuckles)

808
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,320
Good night.

809
00:39:50,322 --> 00:39:51,955
It was very nice meeting you,

810
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:53,523
Dr. Thompkins.
And you, Bruce.

811
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:55,645
Good night's sleep,
you'll be right as roses.

812
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,997
I do hope we get to see you
again soon.

813
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:03,232
Thank you.

814
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,570
Alfred.

815
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,977
Sure you're okay?

816
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:16,179
I'm fine.

817
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:20,116
Kiss me?

818
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:21,784
Jim...

819
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,319
Kiss me.

820
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:31,694
Oh, bugger.
Alfred.

821
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:33,730
You knew, didn't you?
I didn't know, Alfred.

822
00:40:33,732 --> 00:40:36,065
You did. You let me make
a right mug of me-self.

823
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:38,101
BRUCE:
Alfred, I had no idea.

824
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:40,136
ALFRED: You did.
I didn't know.

825
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:42,698
ALFRED:
Well, I didn't know.

826
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:06,195
REPORTER:
<i>Despite the presence</i>

827
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,764
of the GCPD, it was

828
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:10,500
billionaire Theo Galavan--
newly arrived in Gotham

829
00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:12,468
but already
making his name--

830
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,604
who stood up
to the escaped lunatic.

831
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:17,640
Am I a hero?

832
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,642
Hmm. Apparently.

833
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,411
(chuckles)

834
00:41:21,413 --> 00:41:23,646
THEO: I think tonight,
the people of Gotham have said,

835
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,081
"Enough."

836
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:26,949
The reign of tyranny is over.

837
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:30,053
Now the real fun begins.

838
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:31,521
Poor Jerome.

839
00:41:31,523 --> 00:41:34,023
THEO:
Yes, very sad.

840
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:36,225
Such a compelling character.
But limited, you know?

841
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,493
He was never
gonna last long.

842
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,163
Hmm. I don't know
about that.

843
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:42,725
The kid had a
way about him.

844
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,170
Oh, poor baby,

845
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:49,372
did you get a bump?

846
00:42:00,285 --> 00:42:02,418
REPORTER: ...the killer,
Jerome Valeska, is dead,

847
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,320
his murderous escapades

848
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:06,622
left a deep impression
on Gotham.

849
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:09,692
JEROME: Nobody here
is getting out alive.

850
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:11,694
(cackling)

851
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,696
(cackling)

852
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,268
(parents arguing)

853
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,471
(cackling)

854
00:42:33,418 --> 00:42:36,352
Coming through.
(sighs)

855
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:39,589
Bang. (cackling)

856
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:43,493
(cackling)

857
00:42:46,464 --> 00:42:48,664
(cackling continues)

858
00:42:53,605 --> 00:42:55,471
(knife slices, man gasps)

859
00:42:55,473 --> 00:42:57,974
(cackling continues)

860
00:42:57,976 --> 00:43:02,779
CICERO:<i> You will be</i>
<i>a curse upon Gotham.</i>

861
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:06,415
<i>Children will wake</i>
<i>from sleep screaming</i>

862
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,384
<i>at the thought of you.</i>

863
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:13,523
<i>Your legacy will be</i>
<i>death and madness.</i>

864
00:43:16,294 --> 00:43:18,494
<i>(cackling echoes)</i>
