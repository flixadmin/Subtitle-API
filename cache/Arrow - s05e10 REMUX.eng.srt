1
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:03,254
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:06,549
Four years ago,
The Hood took down Justin Claybourne.

3
00:00:06,716 --> 00:00:08,152
You told me that Claybourne
didn't have any kids.

4
00:00:08,176 --> 00:00:10,529
There's no record of the kid's name.
He'd be about 30 today.

5
00:00:10,553 --> 00:00:12,638
Just old enough to put on
a hood and a mask.

6
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:16,434
Old enough to want revenge on the man
who murdered his father.

7
00:00:17,602 --> 00:00:19,103
Evelyn? Why?

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,857
You're a fraud.
This city needs to be saved from you.

9
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:24,066
Hey.

10
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:25,711
Johnny, I need you
to come to the Safe House.

11
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:27,945
- Something's wrong with J.J.
- Lyla?

12
00:00:28,446 --> 00:00:29,739
Did you find Billy?

13
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:33,117
I didn't know it was Billy,
I couldn't have known.

14
00:00:38,623 --> 00:00:39,624
Hi, Ollie.

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,756
I saw you die.

16
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:51,552
I was saved. I saw this white light and...

17
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:55,473
It's... It's just like they say.

18
00:00:55,806 --> 00:01:00,436
This angel, she reached out to me,
but she wasn't an angel.

19
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:04,065
She was my sister.

20
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:05,399
What?

21
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:09,862
Sara, she had me teleported
to the Waverider.

22
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:13,991
They have this technology
that fixed the embolism.

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,993
I was there.

24
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,038
Everyone was there.

25
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,833
Nobody saw a white light,
and you didn't go anywhere.

26
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:24,669
That's because she hadn't done it yet.

27
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:27,546
Ollie...

28
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:30,258
Ollie, I asked her.

29
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,426
I asked her to bring me to your present.

30
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,722
She gave me the same gift that I gave her.

31
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:42,979
She gave me a second chance.

32
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,689
It's a miracle.

33
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:54,740
Laurel?

34
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:56,534
Hi, Felicity.

35
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,203
Laurel? Oh, my God!

36
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:02,206
Oh, my God!

37
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,209
It's a miracle.

38
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,044
Oliver said the exact same thing.

39
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:18,055
I thought Sara and the Legends
were against changing history.

40
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:22,059
Sara said that they figured out a way
to bring me back without causing a, uh...

41
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,686
An Aberration?

42
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,229
Yes, that.

43
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:28,190
Are you okay?

44
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:29,900
Fine.

45
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,580
Yeah, I just wished the Legends
could bring back everybody we wanted.

46
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,742
What happened? What did I miss?

47
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,452
We'll talk about it later.

48
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:43,456
The important thing is
that you're back from the past.

49
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,791
Which they brought you back
from months later,

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,710
and they just dropped you here.

51
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,378
So weird.

52
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:52,882
Time travel, am I right? Wow.

53
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:55,551
Do you guys want coffee?

54
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,137
I am gonna get a decaf,
probably, 'cause...

55
00:02:58,763 --> 00:03:00,848
It's nice to see some things
haven't changed.

56
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:04,352
Ugh. I have to call my dad.

57
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:06,854
He's gonna kill me for coming here first.

58
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:08,898
Laurel, after you...

59
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:16,405
Your dad left with Donna
and it didn't go well.

60
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:19,617
- He's drinking again.
- He's in rehab.

61
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,371
But, he's getting better.
He's getting the help that he needs.

62
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:24,955
Wow. Nine months.

63
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:27,094
I guess I have a lot of catching up to do.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,400
Which is why I'm going to
tell everyone to come to the party.

65
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:32,546
What party?

66
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:34,608
The party that we're gonna throw
for Laurel tomorrow night.

67
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:35,800
That sounds great.

68
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:39,553
I mean, I would love to see everyone.
Thea and John...

69
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:41,347
Oh, my... John! Oh...

70
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,399
I came here to tell you
and I totally forgot.

71
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,685
What's going on with John?

72
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,604
I can't believe she's back.

73
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,982
I walked into the bunker,
and she was just there.

74
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:56,654
Like nothing had happened.
Like it was some kind of gift.

75
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,914
How much does she know
about what's happened?

76
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:01,450
We're easing her in.

77
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,078
There's a lot to process. The recruits...

78
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,371
Prometheus.

79
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,997
The fact that you killed his dad.

80
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,378
Felicity and Lyla are working on
finding his mother.

81
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:14,705
What happened with the dude
who trained the two of you?

82
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:19,176
Well, she doesn't stay
in one spot for very long.

83
00:04:19,427 --> 00:04:21,345
But, I'm working on finding her.

84
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:25,516
In the meantime, we need to work
on a way of getting you out of here.

85
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,352
Yeah, well, we did that, remember?

86
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,688
And here I am, right back on the inside.

87
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:33,065
- Well, John...
- No, man. No more running.

88
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:36,277
It's time I faced this head on,
and fight these trumped-up charges.

89
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:38,007
That's an improvement from last time.

90
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:39,155
Roger that.

91
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:42,575
I'm gonna show Walker that he picked
the wrong soldier to screw with.

92
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:44,201
We need to have some kind of plan.

93
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,370
I'm gonna need one hell of a lawyer.

94
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,038
I might know a guy.

95
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:02,261
My captains warned me
that you would be a risk.

96
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:04,430
An American Bratva?

97
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:08,392
But I thought that you could be useful.

98
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,228
I did what you asked me to do.

99
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:13,564
I tried to blow up Kovar's casino.

100
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:17,610
All that you were interested in
was killing Konstantin Kovar.

101
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:19,612
But not for the Bratva.

102
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,576
For yourself. For a woman.

103
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,411
Kovar told me everything.

104
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:30,456
Kovar is a government agent.

105
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:34,084
And the deal that you made with him
betrays the Bratva.

106
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,045
Your vendetta betrays the Bratva.

107
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,714
My deal with Kovar
benefits our brotherhood.

108
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,759
And, in any case, I am Pakhan.

109
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,178
My decisions are the law.

110
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:47,806
And I will get obedience from you,

111
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,601
even if I have to beat it into you.

112
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,071
Is this why you joined Bratva?

113
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,658
To get to Kovar?

114
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:09,954
Because you had some promise to her?

115
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,831
Hmm?

116
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:19,838
You don't have to drop everything
and fly home, Thea.

117
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:22,550
I'll still be here
when the conference is over.

118
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,802
And the way Oliver describes it,

119
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,097
you're the one that's doing all the
heavy lifting at the mayor's office.

120
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:32,142
I guess spontaneous resurrection
is as good as any reason for a party.

121
00:06:32,393 --> 00:06:33,394
But...

122
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:37,773
But we haven't even buried
Detective Malone yet.

123
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:40,234
It feels weird to be celebrating?

124
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,194
It doesn't feel weird to you?

125
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:44,071
Yes, weird, yeah.

126
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,242
Weirder. I guess.

127
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:51,787
After the past four years it's just
hard for me to accept good news.

128
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,837
It's weird, man. She was dead.
Now she's not.

129
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:01,463
Well, that's time travel for you.

130
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:04,508
Well, I don't mean Laurel being back
is what's weird.

131
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,636
It's how you all reacted to it.
Like it's happened before.

132
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,098
It's happened before?

133
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,852
The Lance sisters have a habit
of coming back to life.

134
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,814
Wait, what?

135
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:25,863
Yo, Curtis. Come back inside.
We're gonna make a toast.

136
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,409
It doesn't feel right
to be gathered around like this.

137
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,706
Detective Malone is dead.
Evelyn betrayed us.

138
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,043
And Prometheus is still out there.

139
00:07:39,335 --> 00:07:44,006
We should be trying to find him.
Making him pay for everything.

140
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:58,062
A little over a year ago,
I stood right here,

141
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:01,398
and I remarked that I wished
it wasn't just the dark times

142
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:02,816
that brought us together.

143
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:06,028
With all of the loss
that we have suffered,

144
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:11,200
I think it's important,
that we embrace the miracles, too.

145
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:15,829
And that we remember
they are still possible.

146
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:19,667
Welcome home, Laurel.

147
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,543
Cheers.

148
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:33,931
Hey.

149
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:35,933
- Sorry?
- God!

150
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,310
I wasn't expecting anyone here. It's late.

151
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,313
I don't sleep much. Or at all.

152
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,691
Side-effect of wearing haunted rags,
I guess.

153
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:46,276
So, I figured I'd train. What's that?

154
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:49,947
- It's nothing.
- It's my Qmail.

155
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,116
You know, my Face-Chat, Snapbook stuff.

156
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,761
All the kids are doing these
new, crazy social media things...

157
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,913
- You're running a DNA analysis.
- Yeah, I am. On Laurel's glass.

158
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,958
That... What, you took from the party?

159
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:04,294
Oh, if by "party" you mean
my brilliant ruse to collect her DNA,

160
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,921
then, yes, you are correct.

161
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:08,132
- Wow.
- Yeah.

162
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,860
You know, there's looking a gift horse
in the mouth and then there's...

163
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,153
Being driven by paranoid delusions

164
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,780
to run comparisons on genetic base pairs?

165
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,204
- Yes, I'm aware. Thank you.
- Yeah?

166
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,182
Yeah. Yeah.

167
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:19,643
- Well?
- DNA matches.

168
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:23,480
- Okay, so, we can relax, Shapeshifter.
- Yeah.

169
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,816
Ooh, what about an evil twin?

170
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:29,486
Oh. No.

171
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:30,696
Okay, I was joking.

172
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:34,032
No. No, no, no, no, no.
She actually has an evil twin.

173
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,136
- Seriously?
- Yeah. She's locked up in S.T.A.R. Labs.

174
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,280
I'll explain later.
Right now we have to call Cisco...

175
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,672
Finally!
It's about time someone figured it out.

176
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:53,844
You know, I am so sick and tired
of playing this weak, vulnerable Laurel.

177
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:56,221
She's such a pill. It's pathetic.

178
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:10,235
You know, the one problem with my ability

179
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:14,072
is that I can never hear
my poor little victims scream.

180
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,370
Laurel!

181
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,300
Hey, are you hurt?

182
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:34,927
I'm gonna be okay. But...

183
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,055
That's not our Laurel.

184
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:48,232
So, that Laurel's from
an alternate reality?

185
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,901
Technically, she's from
a parallel universe.

186
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,236
We're on Earth-1.

187
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,696
The lookalike Laurel
is from another Earth, Earth-2.

188
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,241
Over there, we all have doppelganger
versions of ourselves

189
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,327
who could be very similar
or incredibly different

190
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,929
based on an infinite amount of variables.

191
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:02,704
I'd love to see what I'm like
on Earth-2.

192
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,915
Oh, God! What if I'm straight?

193
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,167
Okay. One thing I don't get...

194
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,545
Well, you know,
there's a list of things I don't get,

195
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:12,464
but the top is, this fake Laurel
seemed to know, like, everything.

196
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,424
- How's that possible?
- Prometheus.

197
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:17,719
Cisco just sent this over.
It is from three days ago.

198
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:20,430
Nobody knew
because no alarms were tripped.

199
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,057
It's like he's a dybbuk.

200
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:23,535
Yeah, I don't know what that is.

201
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,310
- One question.
- Just one?

202
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,438
Prometheus breaks into S.T.A.R. Labs,
gets not-Laurel,

203
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,858
Henry-Higgins her into coming off
as real-Laurel.

204
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,485
That's a lot of hoops.
Why not just kill you?

205
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:34,838
He told me he doesn't want to.

206
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,947
He's proving to me
that I will destroy myself

207
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,323
and everyone close to me.

208
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:40,325
Well, he's gonna be disappointed,

209
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,911
because we are gonna put Black Siren
back in her cage.

210
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,289
"Black Siren"?

211
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,915
Every meta gets a nickname.

212
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:48,125
Let's hit the streets.

213
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:50,502
She is not leaving the city
until this is over.

214
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:51,795
What are you gonna do?

215
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:54,798
John needs my help as mayor.
I will be on my cell.

216
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,804
Let's see if I understand.

217
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,598
You carried this girl with you

218
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:06,268
through all of your trials
and tribulations on some island.

219
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,145
Lian Yu -Yes.

220
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,189
And yet, when you get off this island,

221
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,108
you do not return home.

222
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,818
No.

223
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:19,656
Instead, you come to a country
where you know just one person,

224
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:23,827
you join my organization,
pass all of our tests,

225
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:29,499
and all of this so you can avenge
the death of a different woman?

226
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,544
Woman in that photo's name is Laurel.

227
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,755
And I didn't return home

228
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:39,343
because after everything
I've been through,

229
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,263
everything I've done,

230
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,851
she wouldn't recognize me.

231
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,145
Now I see.

232
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,689
You think that you've been made
into a monster?

233
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,983
Better a monster than a sell-out.

234
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,988
How much did Kovar pay you
to betray your brothers?

235
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,717
Your failure is unacceptable.

236
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,248
You should have let me kill them

237
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:24,471
instead of some stupid role-playing idea.

238
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,185
It is not your place
to question my agenda.

239
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:34,064
Your freedom, your life is contingent
on following my orders.

240
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,983
Do you understand?

241
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:39,486
Hey, thanks for coming in.

242
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,614
No problem.
I wanted to talk with you as well.

243
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,741
Okay. Uh, the file that I sent you...

244
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:48,453
John Diggle is my former bodyguard.
And current friend.

245
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:52,165
And facing a court-martial
for espionage, murder,

246
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,794
escaping a federal prison,
and attempted theft of a WMD.

247
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,087
He's innocent.

248
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:58,773
So why did he escape a federal prison?

249
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,424
Because he's innocent.

250
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,443
The man who framed him
is a three-star General.

251
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:06,096
John did not think that he would
get a fair trial in the court system.

252
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,931
Which is where you come in.

253
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:11,476
Oliver, I'm a city prosecutor,
not a military defense attorney.

254
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,103
That's why I thought of you.

255
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,605
John needs someone outside
of the military infrastructure.

256
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,150
This is the only way
for justice to get done.

257
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,111
- He doesn't even know me.
- John Diggle is a good man.

258
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,531
He's better than the both of us
put together.

259
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,283
Getting the Judge Advocates

260
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,785
to even authorize me
to pro hac in would be a miracle.

261
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,495
Sounds like a "yes."

262
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,165
Eh, more like a, God, help me.
And your friend.

263
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:35,292
Hey, I will owe you one.

264
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,793
This is worth more than one.

265
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:43,300
Um, actually, hey... As if we don't have
enough on our plate,

266
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,385
have you heard about the circumstances

267
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,232
surrounding the death of Detective Malone?

268
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:49,556
No.

269
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:52,517
He was wearing Prometheus' outfit
when he was Killed.

270
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,729
His mouth was taped shut,
a sword taped into his hand.

271
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,776
There was a wireless speaker
found on the scene.

272
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,193
What are you saying?

273
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,320
That it looks like Malone was set up.

274
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:06,698
That it looks like the Green Arrow
was manipulated into killing him.

275
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,284
By Prometheus.

276
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:11,912
I made sure the cops who caught the scene
won't say anything,

277
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,432
and I'm handling the coroner.
I just wanted to let you know.

278
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:17,375
Yeah, that you're gonna cover this up?

279
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:18,835
If the city finds out

280
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,171
that a member of the Anti-Crime Unit
was Prometheus,

281
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,464
there's gonna be panic.

282
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,509
If the Green Arrow killed a member
of the Anti-Crime Unit,

283
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,177
there's gonna be panic.

284
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,262
- Either way.
- Gotta keep this quiet.

285
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,765
It's the only way to see justice done.

286
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:42,734
This is Mayor Queen.

287
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,570
Oliver, it's me. Laurel.

288
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,197
Don't you say her name.

289
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,991
I'm sorry. What I did was unforgivable.

290
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,494
But, but he made me do it. Prometheus.

291
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,163
What do you mean, he made you?

292
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:58,750
He threatened to kill me.
You have to help me. Please.

293
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:00,710
Can you meet?

294
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:02,379
Where?

295
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,881
The Black Canary statue.
I'll be there soon.

296
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:06,299
Wait...

297
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,180
Any sign of Black Siren?

298
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:15,809
Not yet. But everyone's
gonna stand down and do not engage...

299
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,018
Yeah, we get it.

300
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,465
Yeah, well, I say take her down.

301
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:19,563
Overwatch.

302
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,858
You heard the boss.
This is an eyes-only operation for you.

303
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,151
I have eyes on.

304
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,213
Boys, I just put you
on a separate channel.

305
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:28,238
Uh, why?

306
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,633
So, if Black Siren looks like
she's about to double-cross,

307
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,741
and trust me, she will,

308
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,628
you have it on my authority
to light her up.

309
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:36,121
Thank you for meeting me.

310
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:39,749
You don't believe me.
Prometheus threatened to kill me.

311
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,210
You're a very convincing liar.

312
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,670
I deserve that.

313
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,463
According to S.T.A.R. Labs,

314
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,425
you'd help Prometheus
even if he wasn't threatening anyone.

315
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,093
That's what they think.

316
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:51,303
What do you think?

317
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,514
I can help you track him.

318
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:56,766
Take her out.

319
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,337
I told you not to engage.

320
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:26,963
We know, it's just...

321
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,882
She, um, spooked us.

322
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:30,717
You guys are terrible liars.

323
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:32,969
I told them to move on her.

324
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,682
Since when are they taking orders
from you?

325
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:40,310
I don't know. But I kind of like it.

326
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:42,997
- She had something in her hand.
- She had her phone in her hand.

327
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,940
Well, it didn't look like her phone,

328
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:46,626
and I don't trust her,
so I told them to move.

329
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,010
I had the situation under control.

330
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,779
She told me that
Prometheus forced her to do this.

331
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,256
Now whether or not that is true,

332
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,966
she was going to give us
valuable intel on him.

333
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,367
She's playing you, Oliver.

334
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,255
I understand that you're
suspicious of her.

335
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,746
And I know this Laurel
is from another Earth,

336
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:03,416
that this is not our Laurel.
But we don't know why.

337
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,418
We don't.

338
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,845
I told you. Blinders.

339
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:20,475
Hey, you good?

340
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,103
Why wouldn't I be?

341
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,438
I just got my ass kicked
for the bazillionth time.

342
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:33,697
So, basically, I'm trading a cell
in Central City

343
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:36,199
for a cell in Starling City.

344
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,702
Actually, on this Earth,
we call it "Star City."

345
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,205
I'm sorry about the cell.

346
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:45,792
I told you
that Prometheus was going to kill me.

347
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,961
And that is why I did what I did.

348
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:51,673
Your history on Earth-2
would suggest you had other reasons.

349
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,050
- You don't trust me?
- Can you blame me?

350
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:58,138
No. Because on my world,
you've been dead for 10 years now.

351
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,807
I moved to Central City for a fresh start.

352
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:02,934
That's where this happened.

353
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:08,648
And from then,
it was just one bad choice after another.

354
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,401
And I guess
once you let the darkness inside,

355
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,819
it never comes out.

356
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,530
And now I am trapped
in a parallel dimension,

357
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,907
telling my sob story

358
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:21,244
to the doppelganger of the man that...
That I loved.

359
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,872
So stop running.

360
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:26,916
Face the darkness.

361
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:28,918
How does that work?

362
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,756
First, you need to tell me
everything that you know about Prometheus.

363
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,257
Everything.

364
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,343
And then we keep you safe.

365
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,012
And you're willing to do that, why?

366
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,349
Why, because I look like someone
you used to know?

367
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,642
Someone once told me that a circumstance

368
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:49,189
could make something poison or nectar.

369
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,279
What they meant was
that we get to choose what we are.

370
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:58,948
We get to choose who we are.

371
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,743
So tell me...

372
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:06,456
Who are you?

373
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:11,586
Hey, yo, hold up!

374
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,922
I'll walk with you. Hopping the L-line.

375
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,132
- You taking the subway?
- No, I'm just gonna walk.

376
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:17,842
By yourself?

377
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:20,553
You do have a tendency
to get your ass kicked.

378
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,366
Did you just come all the way
out here just to insult me?

379
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,590
I'm just going home,
but that was merely a product of...

380
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:26,810
I'll see you tomorrow, Rene.

381
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:28,812
Damn, you soft!

382
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,647
I thought you had some wit, man.

383
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,416
What, the Black Siren kicked that
out of you, too?

384
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,733
Not now, man. Not now.

385
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,194
What, did I hurt your feelings?

386
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,446
Just let me be, man.

387
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,408
What's your damage, hoss?

388
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:43,743
I mean, ever since the party,
you've been off.

389
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,995
You're supposed
to be the happy one, remember?

390
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,164
Like what? Like this?

391
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,861
What the hell's gotten into you?

392
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,210
I've been stabbed, shot at, put in a coma,

393
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:54,212
had magic powers used on me,

394
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,423
superpowers used against me, and for what?

395
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,551
What difference does it make?

396
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:03,847
All it's done is cost me my blood,
my sweat...

397
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,350
And my Paul.

398
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:09,686
It cost me Paul.

399
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,857
That's your husband, right?

400
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,277
Was. He left me.

401
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,696
'Cause of you being Mr. Terrific?

402
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,284
Because of me trying.

403
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:30,081
But I'm never gonna make it,
because I don't have what it takes.

404
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,209
So now I don't have anything.

405
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:48,850
Hey, keep your wrist straight.
Just so you don't jam it.

406
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,519
Mmm.

407
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:56,441
- I spoke to Laurel.
- When did she become Laurel?

408
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:04,491
She's not Laurel. Not Laurel Laurel.
She's not our Laurel, okay? Not...

409
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:09,204
Okay, Felicity, I can't pretend
to understand parallel worlds.

410
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,081
But if I'm gonna believe in them,

411
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:15,793
and I kind of have to now,
then I need to believe

412
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,755
that differences
are caused by circumstances.

413
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:23,218
So why can't we change
this Laurel's circumstances?

414
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:24,706
You think that you can save her.

415
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:30,141
- After she's thrown in with Prometheus...
- Under duress.

416
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:34,270
I just...

417
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,315
I think I can reach her.

418
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:40,276
When did you find the time
to get a PhD in psychology?

419
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:41,819
I'm a quick study.

420
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:46,950
My name's Adrian Chase,
Star City District Attorney.

421
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:52,121
John Diggle. Convict.
You here to add to my charges?

422
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,250
Not exactly. I'm representing you.

423
00:22:56,584 --> 00:23:00,797
Your friend Oliver's persuasive.
Plus, he's my boss.

424
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:05,051
General Walker,
the guy who wants you out of the picture,

425
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:09,472
- you know who his boss is?
- The President.

426
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,975
So you can imagine how difficult
this is about to be.

427
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:17,647
Mr. Chase, MP officers are here to remand
the prisoner into their custody.

428
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,191
Wait, I thought
I was supposed to stay here for now.

429
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,569
You're under their jurisdiction.
The trial...

430
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:26,072
The trial? Man, there won't be a trial.

431
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:27,361
As soon as I'm out of here,

432
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,810
Walker will concoct some reason
to put a bullet in my head.

433
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,247
Sergeant Diggle.

434
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,999
Good to see you again.

435
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:40,211
Have Sergeant Diggle cleared out of here
and ready for transport ASAP.

436
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,923
We got a long ride back
to Langham ahead of us.

437
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:15,079
So tell me,
what happened between you and Oliver?

438
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:20,835
Did he find someone else?
Or were you not tall enough?

439
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:27,050
Do you have a sister?
Because I hear he loves sisters.

440
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:33,890
Oliver seems to think that
because you look like Laurel,

441
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:35,391
that you could become her.

442
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:39,312
And what do you think?

443
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,440
I think...

444
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:46,486
You should get used to living in cages.

445
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,532
There's a part of him
that blames himself for Laurel's death.

446
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:54,535
It's who he is.

447
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,664
So when he looks at you,

448
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,292
he doesn't just see Laurel.

449
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,672
He sees his shot at redemption.

450
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:11,260
Wow, it must be really frustrating
that he doesn't listen to you.

451
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:12,679
No, I'm used to it.

452
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,413
How'd she escape?

453
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,873
The power went off
and the dampener along with it.

454
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:43,710
And Goldilocks huffed and puffed
and blew the door down.

455
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,795
That's not exactly how her power works.

456
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:47,964
Was there something wrong
with Cisco's specs?

457
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,526
Because didn't we just replicate
the Pipeline's security system?

458
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,594
We did. I let her go.

459
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:56,597
- What?
- Damn, blondie.

460
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:59,576
I'm sorry. But, everyone, just relax.
I put tracking nanites in her water,

461
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,454
- the same ones we used to find Malcolm.
- Well, that makes everything better.

462
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:04,981
Isn't that exactly how you used Anarky
to find Darhk last year?

463
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:11,320
- Could we have the room please?
- Seriously? This is getting good.

464
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:13,656
Rene, Rory, come on, guys.

465
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:24,834
You could've been hurt.

466
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:27,453
What ever happened to
"if we change her circumstances"?

467
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:33,009
You risked your life to get a line
on Prometheus because of Billy.

468
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:35,937
Well, now that you're killing again,
I thought why not put it to use?

469
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:38,055
You know,
we're gonna get justice for Billy.

470
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:41,058
But first,
we need to take care of your ex.

471
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,019
Who's not even your ex.

472
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:01,037
There's a part of him
that blames himself for Laurel's death.

473
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:03,539
It's who he is.

474
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:09,337
So when he looks at you,
he sees more than just Laurel.

475
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,173
He sees his shot at redemption.

476
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,930
It's like I said,
you know me better than almost anyone.

477
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:26,813
I failed Laurel before.

478
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:31,818
I can't fail her again.

479
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,779
I don't have to
remind you that this isn't her.

480
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:37,657
I know.

481
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:42,745
Our Laurel's gone.

482
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:46,123
She's the last chance that I have.

483
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:49,585
Okay?

484
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,257
Billy is my responsibility.

485
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,594
And we will get justice for him.

486
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:03,391
I'll let you know
when the trackers metabolize and go live.

487
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:17,697
You've been here for just few months
and already you think you know everything.

488
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:20,533
Did it not occur to you
that I could be playing Kovar?

489
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:24,537
- I don't believe that.
- Of course, you don't.

490
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:27,331
Because you don't understand

491
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:32,378
that circumstances are
what makes a thing poison or nectar.

492
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:36,716
You believe
your fool's errand to kill Kovar

493
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:41,554
because you think that you are responsible
for this darkness that's inside of you.

494
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:47,518
Like a baby blaming himself for being
left out in the cold by his mother.

495
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:49,228
If it weren't for that island,

496
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:55,067
you would be
that harmless American douchebag

497
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:57,570
that you pretended to be
in Kovar's casino.

498
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:06,203
So I guess I'm just supposed to
listen to you instead?

499
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,832
I can give you family.

500
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:14,086
One that does not see a monster,
but a brother.

501
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:19,884
All I'm asking in return
is your obedience.

502
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:26,390
- Or else?
- Hmm.

503
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,439
Or else...

504
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:38,194
You don't leave this room alive.

505
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,577
So Mom and Dad
are going 12 rounds upstairs.

506
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:48,204
They're just having a discussion.

507
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:53,918
Look, I know that I took the teasing
too far earlier.

508
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:58,089
I can be an acquired taste,

509
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:01,258
but I'm sorry to hear about Paul
and that I made you feel worse about it.

510
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:06,472
Thanks.

511
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:09,517
- That's really big of you.
- So what are you doing down here?

512
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:14,063
Well, since the Black Siren's cry works on
a more powerful frequency than Laurel's,

513
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,315
these are useless.

514
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:20,403
So, I was trying to see if there was a way
to make the dampener portable

515
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:23,572
- so the next time we go up against her...
- You can take her powers away.

516
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:25,282
That's awesome.

517
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:28,995
Yeah, well, ideas are one thing,
executing them is another.

518
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,872
- You don't get it, do you?
- Get what?

519
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:35,042
That maybe instead of beating yourself up
about what you can't do,

520
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:37,086
take a moment
and appreciate what you can do.

521
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:39,797
'Cause it's pretty bad-ass.

522
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,472
General Walker. Sorry, General,

523
00:30:48,681 --> 00:30:51,721
but I cannot let you take John Diggle
without the proper paperwork turned in.

524
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:54,770
- Excuse me?
- Forms I-55 and W-67.

525
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:57,898
And the completed transfer assignment
signed by the Langham warden.

526
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:01,610
Never seen a D.A. get involved in military
matters. And on the defense side.

527
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,822
I'm expanding my practice.

528
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:10,411
Anything else?

529
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:23,299
It's not common for someone of your rank

530
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:25,968
to personally supervise
a prisoner transfer.

531
00:31:26,177 --> 00:31:28,596
I make exceptions for traitors
and terrorists.

532
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:32,516
I'll need a district judge
to ratify the transfer papers.

533
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:35,478
That could take a few hours,
maybe even a few days.

534
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:39,940
Do you have the Attorney General
on speed dial? I do.

535
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:44,653
And she owes me a favor.
I can have you disbarred in 15 seconds.

536
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:50,701
I expect the prisoner to be
in my custody in 24 hours. Am I clear?

537
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:52,620
Mmm-hmm.

538
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:02,046
Tracker's live.

539
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:04,090
- Where is she?
- The nanites just metabolized.

540
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,193
I'm triangulating them
with a keyhole satellite feed.

541
00:32:06,217 --> 00:32:08,153
Remind me to upgrade our Internet
tomorrow. Got it.

542
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:10,763
1400 block, Brand Boulevard.
Pulling up keyhole now.

543
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:12,515
I think I have something that'll help.

544
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,975
A mobile version of the dampener
from S.T.A.R. Labs.

545
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:17,144
- "Think"?
- I might need some more time with it.

546
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:19,664
The circuitry is pretty complex
and I'm feeling a lot of pressure...

547
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,124
Felicity can come with and help you.

548
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:23,710
Hold up. I'm not getting a good enough
reading off the thermal imaging.

549
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:25,879
There's no way to tell if Black Siren
is actually with.

550
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:30,157
Prometheus, and the whole point of doing
this is to catch that son of a... bitch.

551
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:32,511
We need to wait until we get
visual confirmation of Prometheus.

552
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:34,971
We are not waiting for anything.
We're gonna bring her in right now.

553
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:36,872
Get on board with this. Suit up!

554
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:46,715
This is private property.
Ma'am, what are you doing here?

555
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:48,300
I'm just waiting for a friend.

556
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,721
She's here. Create a perimeter. Go!

557
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:01,188
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

558
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:03,917
Kidding. I think people in Florida
heard that. We need to hurry.

559
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:08,863
- She was crazy. She could scream.
- Run away and call the police.

560
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:24,044
Don't move, Trinity.

561
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:25,754
Oh.

562
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:29,008
I thought you'd be someone else.
Disappointing.

563
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:37,433
- This should do it.
- Are you sure?

564
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:38,934
No, but we're out of time.

565
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:48,110
Prometheus.

566
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:14,303
Diazepam. That should slow you down.

567
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:33,697
Diazepam.
You could say I have a tolerance.

568
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:36,408
But you shouldn't be worrying about me
right now.

569
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:39,703
Ah, Felicity.

570
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:45,000
I'm so sorry, but I think it's about time
that I kill you.

571
00:34:46,502 --> 00:34:48,045
Felicity or me!

572
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:57,346
Laurel!

573
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:03,894
Don't do this.

574
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:07,189
There's no coming back for you.

575
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:08,983
If you kill Felicity,

576
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:13,696
then you're killing that part of yourself
that existed before you lost your family.

577
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:21,829
If you end this now,
we can find that person again,

578
00:35:22,997 --> 00:35:24,039
together.

579
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:25,958
She was never there.

580
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:50,065
You really need to shut your damn mouth.

581
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,401
Hey, pumpkin.

582
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:02,536
Hey. Kept my wrist straight.

583
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,384
You turn me over, I'll be dead before you
get back to your office.

584
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:18,927
I believe you.

585
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:23,265
You know, when I woke up,
I didn't think that I'd be pissing off

586
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:25,192
one of the most powerful men
in the military.

587
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:28,896
Hit me.

588
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,272
What?

589
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:31,607
Hit me.

590
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:48,916
- What the hell is going on here?
- Your prisoner just decked me.

591
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:52,628
- Unsatisfied with your legal counsel?
- Who knows?

592
00:36:52,795 --> 00:36:56,298
But we are in Starling County,

593
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:59,134
and the County Code Section 47.15

594
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:03,305
specifically states
that the District Attorney, me,

595
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:06,225
can supersede transfers
to other jurisdictions

596
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:09,812
if the suspect commits a secondary crime
within my jurisdiction.

597
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:14,733
Attacking a city official
is a very serious offense, Mr. Diggle.

598
00:37:15,526 --> 00:37:17,569
I think I'm gonna have to
prosecute this one myself.

599
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,031
It could take a while.

600
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:24,493
Fine. I'll be back with a writ
signed by the President.

601
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:27,579
Can't wait.
I've always wanted her autograph.

602
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:46,932
You know how people say,
"Il hate to say I told you so"?

603
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:49,518
I don't hate it. I freakin' love it.

604
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,996
You really weren't kidding
about that acquired-taste thing.

605
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,780
It's like shooting fish
in a barrel with you.

606
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:55,774
It's cool. I can take it.

607
00:37:57,693 --> 00:38:00,028
You were right, Rene.
I need to start embracing

608
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,948
what I can do for the team,
instead of what I can't.

609
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:06,034
That's what I'm talking about.
More tinkering and less fighting.

610
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:09,204
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call it "tinkering".

611
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,999
- Oh, one more thing.
- Yeah, what's up?

612
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:15,087
You put your hands on me like that
one more time, and I'll kick your ass.

613
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,841
Oh. Good talk.

614
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:29,725
God! This is why I usually leave
the punching to you guys.

615
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:31,497
- It was a memorable punch.
- Mmm-hmm.

616
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:37,316
Yeah, well, typing is going to be a bit of
a challenge in the next couple of days.

617
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,614
Serves me right.
Because I let Black Siren go,

618
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:45,624
one of those guards could have
gotten killed.

619
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,034
We almost got Prometheus.

620
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,288
Your plan worked. He was there.

621
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:53,790
No, if it worked,
we'd be putting cuffs on him right now.

622
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,292
We'll get there.

623
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:57,961
We'll get him.

624
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:06,386
I'm sorry she wasn't her.

625
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:07,679
I know.

626
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:11,850
I'm sorry about Billy. He was a good man.

627
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:13,977
Like you.

628
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:20,025
So I'm guessing that Laurel is
on her way back to Central City then?

629
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:23,278
Secure lockup at A.R.G.U.S.
I'm keeping her close

630
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:28,116
because if there is anything left
of the real Laurel in there,

631
00:39:32,663 --> 00:39:33,789
I'm gonna find it.

632
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:35,249
You know what?

633
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,503
I could really get used to
this newfound optimism of yours.

634
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:52,099
I'm done asking. Follow me or die.

635
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:55,561
Find out what's happening.

636
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:36,310
Hello, Mr. Queen. My name is Talia.

637
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:38,645
I've been looking for you.

638
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:50,532
This doesn't feel right.
They're just taking it away like this.

639
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:54,745
We should build a new one.

640
00:40:55,037 --> 00:40:57,318
- I think we can do better.
- Yeah? What are you thinking?

641
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:00,000
I haven't kept my promise to Laurel.

642
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,502
You're gonna train a new Black Canary?

643
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:06,256
I think that somewhere out there, there is
a woman worthy of Laurel's legacy.

644
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:11,928
Now all we've gotta do is find her.

645
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:18,685
You boys want another round?

646
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,565
No. I was thinkin' of ordering
somethin' that's not on the menu, huh?

647
00:41:23,774 --> 00:41:25,400
Where you goin', baby?

648
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:28,111
Seriously, could you two be
any more of a cliché?

649
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:34,242
Don't worry, sweetheart.
There's plenty of me to go around.

650
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:38,538
I thought people like you
only existed in the movies.

651
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:42,751
You know, two guys trying to
overcompensate for their lack of manhood

652
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,753
by taking it out on a defenseless woman.

653
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,160
What are you gonna do about it?

654
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:55,806
That.

655
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,044
English - SDH
