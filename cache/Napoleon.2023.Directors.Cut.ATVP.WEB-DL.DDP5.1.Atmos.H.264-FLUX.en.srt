1
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,139
Get back, you lot.

2
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,825
{\an8}Get to the guillotine.

3
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,685
{\an8}The scourge of France!

4
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:18,340
Terror is nothing more than justice.

5
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,512
Prompt, severe, inflexible.

6
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:27,351
It is therefore an emanation of virtue.

7
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:32,523
Now, she was guilty of three charges
against you:

8
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,984
depletion of the national treasury,

9
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:41,740
conspiracy against the internal
and external security of state,

10
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:48,205
and high treason for acting
in the interests of the enemy.

11
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,669
Mercy for the villains?

12
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,214
No.

13
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,842
Mercy for the innocent.

14
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:03,637
Mercy for the unfortunate.

15
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,431
Mercy for humanity.

16
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:14,523
An inescapable outcome
of democracy's connection

17
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,776
{\an8}in relation to the nation's
immediate demands at this moment...

18
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:21,946
{\an8}The British navy have taken
the port of Toulon.

19
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,240
{\an8}Half the French fleet is trapped there.

20
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,619
If we lose those ships,
the Republic will fall.

21
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:32,124
Lucky for us, there are only
2,000 English troops in Toulon.

22
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,423
But we are short of artillery and led by
a general who was a court painter.

23
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,010
It is not necessary
to recapture Toulon itself.

24
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:47,222
The town is not a town.
The town is a port.

25
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,808
If the harbor's untenable
to the English fleet,

26
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,102
the town must surrender.

27
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:56,397
My brother, Captain Bonaparte,
as artillery officer,

28
00:05:56,398 --> 00:06:00,611
has organized heated shots
against English ships.

29
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:04,072
He has proven his commitment
to the Republic.

30
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:07,451
And how do you propose to take the harbor?

31
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,746
Capture the fort
that dominates the harbor,

32
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,789
and you have the city.

33
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:21,924
We must make an example,
or other cities will fall.

34
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,259
And I, for one,

35
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,431
will never let the royalists
or the English take my region.

36
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,237
{\an8}Morning, sir.

37
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:45,989
{\an8}General Carteaux?

38
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,408
He's over there.

39
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:58,502
<i>Lucien, my dear brother,
I am in Toulon already.</i>

40
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:05,592
<i>The troops are in a poor state, and your
conscripts untrained and undisciplined.</i>

41
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:10,013
<i>Without equipment and resources,
I see only failure.</i>

42
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:29,241
<i>We are collecting scrap iron to recast
small mortars more suitable for my plan.</i>

43
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,577
<i>If we do not succeed,</i>

44
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:37,081
<i>those in power will only see us as
Corsican ruffians unfit for higher office,</i>

45
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,668
<i>and our mother's ambitions
will be quashed.</i>

46
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:55,349
That's it, madam. Fine eye you have.

47
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,604
- There you go.
- I'll still be here next week.

48
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,108
<i>The British control the big guns</i>

49
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,236
<i>that point out at their fleet offshore.</i>

50
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:11,575
<i>Take those guns, and we can fire
onto them and end this blockade.</i>

51
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:28,926
<i>Surprise is my advantage,
but I will win by fire.</i>

52
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,595
<i>I cannot wait for your arrival.</i>

53
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,014
<i>Your brother, Napoleon.</i>

54
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,559
Oi, shit rag! Yes, you!

55
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:46,026
Move along now. Go on. Move!

56
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:50,864
Move them fucking goats!

57
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:55,369
Last chance! Fucking move them goats!

58
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,749
You better fucking move them now!

59
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,210
Do you understand?

60
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,687
<i>He sat himself down by the fire, my boys</i>

61
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:25,731
<i>To join in our jovial crew</i>

62
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,901
- Get in position.
- Quick!

63
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:33,155
<i>By the chimney corner was his own place</i>

64
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:36,742
<i>Where he could sit and dye his old face</i>

65
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,036
<i>When Jones's ale was new, my boys</i>

66
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,538
Quick, quick!

67
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:44,250
<i>When Jones's ale was new</i>

68
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:50,756
<i>Pints of beer and bottles of sherry
To help them over the hill so merry</i>

69
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:55,053
<i>When Jones's ale was new</i>

70
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,564
Fire!

71
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,653
We're under attack!

72
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:58,784
We're under attack! Grab your weapons!

73
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,205
Get those ladders up quick, men!

74
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:18,720
Fire! Hit your target!

75
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,975
Get the mortars up there!

76
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,194
Ready, boy?

77
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,032
Oh, God!

78
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,751
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

79
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,717
Get the mortars!

80
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,187
Protect the cannons!

81
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:54,650
Into position!

82
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,116
- <i>Vive la France!</i>
- <i>Vive la France!</i>

83
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,345
Ready the cannons!

84
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,931
Sir! Yes, sir.

85
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,891
Mortars!

86
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,520
Elevation 160.

87
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,025
- Fire!
- Firing!

88
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:42,405
Junot, heated shots!

89
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,324
Fire!

90
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,881
Junot, fire!

91
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:01,383
Fire!

92
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,609
- Reload!
- Reload.

93
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:26,617
Fire!

94
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:44,843
Shoulder, hold!

95
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:50,641
Captain Napoleon Bonaparte,
I award you the rank of brigadier general.

96
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:55,854
Long live the Republic!

97
00:14:56,438 --> 00:15:01,985
Long live the Republic!
Long live the Republic!

98
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:10,661
I promised you brilliant successes,
and I've kept my word.

99
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:21,004
Order, hold!

100
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,159
For Mother.

101
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:02,462
You know your father's under arrest?

102
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,298
He's a prisoner.

103
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,008
Do you know why?

104
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:08,510
'Cause he's a noble.

105
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:11,930
Are you a noble?

106
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:18,103
Hortense, it's all right.

107
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:22,315
Are you a noble?

108
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:23,524
Yes.

109
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:24,818
Yes?

110
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,657
What do your parents say about royalty?

111
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:33,076
Come now. Don't be shy.

112
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:37,539
What do they say when they speak
of Louis and Marie Antoinette?

113
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:42,335
My father is for the revolution. So am I.

114
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,253
Don't lie to me or I will hurt you.

115
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,631
Sir, she is five years old.

116
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:49,051
She's not lying.
My husband fought on your side.

117
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,276
Hands. Show me your hands.

118
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,196
Mouth. Open your mouth!

119
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,323
Look at those teeth.

120
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:13,700
Come on. Keep up!

121
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,702
- Keep her jewelry.
- Hands.

122
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:17,913
That way.

123
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:21,415
Joséphine.

124
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:24,920
Theresa?

125
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:36,098
Hey, stop it.

126
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:41,895
- Move it.
- Hurry up. Come on.

127
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:44,398
Move.

128
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:54,366
The <i>tombereau</i> comes every morning.

129
00:17:56,702 --> 00:18:00,289
We have a rule. No tears. No goodbyes.

130
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,500
We just wave like we're off to the café.

131
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:05,127
Follow me.

132
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:20,225
A pregnant woman gets
a stay of execution until the baby's born.

133
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:23,353
And men never need a reason to fuck,
do they?

134
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:30,235
Welcome home.

135
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:34,865
They say the blade of the guillotine
can get caught in your hair.

136
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:40,245
Got stuck in the king's neck.

137
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:43,957
His neck was fat.

138
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:48,712
You have the neck of a swan.
You won't feel a thing.

139
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:55,677
I'm not going to die.

140
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:58,764
I'll do what it takes.

141
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,184
And if that means
getting pregnant, so be it.

142
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:14,988
You can die like a lady,
or you can live. Like me.

143
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:24,498
This is the mark of a blade. Look.

144
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:54,188
The current leadership of France has
passed from enthusiasm

145
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:55,607
to reckless ambition.

146
00:21:57,317 --> 00:22:01,238
And the public perception
of the guillotine is lawless passion,

147
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:03,615
led by Robespierre.

148
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,201
He is unfit to rule.

149
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,751
Bonaparte.

150
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:18,546
<i>France!</i>

151
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:22,341
It has become increasingly clear,
Citizen Robespierre,

152
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:27,097
that your motivations are to use
this blade to your ultimate power!

153
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,058
Let me speak!

154
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:35,521
There is no man in this room
who has objected to my methods.

155
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:40,027
If you say I am guilty,
you are all guilty!

156
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:43,988
You are not a defender of freedom.

157
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:50,578
You have deemed yourself judge,
jury and executioner, have you not?

158
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:53,748
You're worse than Caesar!
Worse than Caesar!

159
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:57,043
You are, all of you, the traitors!

160
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:58,504
Arrest him!

161
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:16,355
Get him.

162
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:26,156
- Justice.
- He's still alive.

163
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:43,006
You missed.

164
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:47,678
The guillotine, my friend.

165
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:59,939
Knock off his head! Kill him!

166
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,108
No.

167
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:49,132
Hortense?

168
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:53,136
Eugène?

169
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:11,613
Lucille?

170
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:51,737
Madame?

171
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:56,241
Children, come.

172
00:26:58,035 --> 00:26:59,036
Come.

173
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:36,573
Look at that.

174
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:46,917
Leaves nothing to the imagination.

175
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,962
But then, I don't have much imagination.

176
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:52,297
You know who they are?

177
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:55,300
The new queens of Paris.

178
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:58,303
Yeah, let's go.

179
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:42,801
A seven, madame.

180
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:47,598
Deal again.

181
00:30:58,483 --> 00:30:59,484
Deal again.

182
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,035
Your bet.

183
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:20,005
Seven again.

184
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:24,510
No. No win.

185
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:29,556
I'll be out first. That's mine.

186
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:40,943
Why are you staring at me?

187
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:43,320
Am I?

188
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:45,739
- No, I was not.
- Yes.

189
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:47,574
You weren't?

190
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:49,826
I was.

191
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:53,872
I was staring at your face.

192
00:31:55,332 --> 00:31:57,251
What is this costume you have on?

193
00:31:57,876 --> 00:31:59,336
This is my uniform.

194
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:03,257
I led the French victory at Toulon.

195
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:11,723
Do not tell me your name.

196
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:57,811
You ran up a debt at cards tonight.

197
00:33:01,732 --> 00:33:03,066
I'll pay it this time.

198
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:09,363
I've made your reputation
in the salons, Paul.

199
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:11,700
I should really ask for more.

200
00:33:15,704 --> 00:33:16,705
More?

201
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:23,504
This will keep you afloat for now.

202
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,091
But you should
get to know Bonaparte better.

203
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:30,177
Why?

204
00:33:32,304 --> 00:33:33,305
Because.

205
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:48,027
General?

206
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:51,447
There is a very young man who wishes
to see you.

207
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:54,243
His name is Eugène Beauharnais.

208
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,461
Citizen.

209
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:14,346
General Bonaparte.

210
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:15,930
Yes?

211
00:34:15,931 --> 00:34:20,185
My name is Eugène Beauharnais,
son of Joséphine Beauharnais.

212
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:21,937
What do you want?

213
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:24,481
My father's saber.

214
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:29,527
It was taken from him before
he was arrested and executed.

215
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:31,779
Yes?

216
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:36,117
It would mean a great deal to me and
to my mother if it were returned to us.

217
00:34:36,118 --> 00:34:38,077
It's all we have of him.

218
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:39,621
The sword is a weapon.

219
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:44,251
I cannot allow citizens
to have weapons in their possession.

220
00:34:44,835 --> 00:34:48,422
The sword is a keepsake
for me to remember my dear late father.

221
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:51,007
Perhaps, but it is a weapon nevertheless.

222
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:56,388
Young man, why are you here?

223
00:34:57,264 --> 00:35:01,143
My mother said that you were the only man
of authority to retrieve the sword.

224
00:35:13,614 --> 00:35:16,283
All of these are
from officers who were sentenced to die.

225
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:21,288
Did no one think
to attach names to any of them?

226
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:26,335
No, there are no names.

227
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:52,110
General Bonaparte?

228
00:36:02,538 --> 00:36:03,622
Thank you.

229
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,381
Is there reason to introduce myself?

230
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:15,342
No, General.

231
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:17,261
Good.

232
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:21,807
My compliments to
the chef of this fine family.

233
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,538
Would you like to sit closer?

234
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:03,265
<i>Do I look like I'm in love?</i>

235
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:07,436
Do you find him without appeal?

236
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:13,816
No.

237
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:15,569
Then perhaps that is enough.

238
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:23,035
Do not underestimate your grace.

239
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:43,740
Sir.

240
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:08,640
When you look at me,
do you see an aristocrat?

241
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:13,854
No.

242
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:19,735
My husband had more than one lover.

243
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:24,907
And when his head was cut off,
all his mistresses watched.

244
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:35,375
When I was in prison, I was told the
only way to survive was to get pregnant.

245
00:39:37,127 --> 00:39:39,463
So, General...

246
00:39:45,928 --> 00:39:48,597
do I need warn you of my indiscretions?

247
00:39:50,474 --> 00:39:51,475
No, madame.

248
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:55,229
Does where I have been concern you?

249
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:01,527
No, madame.

250
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:21,171
If you look down, you'll see a surprise.

251
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:24,967
And once you see it,
you will always want it.

252
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:44,444
People of France, don't be fooled.
There are more of us!

253
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:47,447
We can occupy this Convention!

254
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:53,328
Long live the king! Long live the king!

255
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:07,383
No doubt you've seen
the chaos in the streets.

256
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:08,468
Yes.

257
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:11,095
There is a belief amongst the Committee

258
00:41:11,096 --> 00:41:14,057
that there is an attack
on the Council coming by this mob.

259
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:19,730
I have less than 4,000 troops
and very little in the way of weapons.

260
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:24,734
There are 40 cannons in Sablons.
I could have them here in three hours.

261
00:41:24,735 --> 00:41:26,737
This mob is 20,000 strong.

262
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:28,780
Yes.

263
00:41:32,826 --> 00:41:36,913
As my second-in-command,
what would you intend to do

264
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:39,708
if this assignment of defense
was transferred to you?

265
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:49,675
I accept, on the condition
that I command this as I see fit.

266
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:51,345
Without interruption.

267
00:41:52,888 --> 00:41:54,806
I will not lead as second-in-command.

268
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:04,775
{\an8}Come on!

269
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:27,965
Fire!

270
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:50,653
<i>We shall win or we shall perish</i>

271
00:42:50,654 --> 00:42:54,490
<i>The French must live for her</i>

272
00:42:54,491 --> 00:43:00,372
<i>And for her the French must die...</i>

273
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:07,087
To the savior of the Republic.

274
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:09,840
- To the savior of the Republic.
- Savior of the Republic.

275
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:12,467
I'm just a watchman for our laws.

276
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,469
For our Republic.

277
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:16,722
For the universe.

278
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:18,932
Nothing more.

279
00:43:20,434 --> 00:43:21,435
Liberty or death.

280
00:43:22,477 --> 00:43:24,229
- Liberty or death.
- Liberty or death.

281
00:43:25,814 --> 00:43:30,861
According to
the law of 20th September, 1792,

282
00:43:31,653 --> 00:43:34,655
Marie-Josèphe-Rose Tascher,

283
00:43:34,656 --> 00:43:39,786
born 23rd June, 1767, in Martinique,

284
00:43:40,412 --> 00:43:44,624
accepts as her husband Napoleon Bonaparte,

285
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:51,006
born February, 1768, in Ajaccio, Corsica.

286
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:54,091
Do you consent?

287
00:43:54,092 --> 00:43:55,177
- Yes.
- I do.

288
00:43:55,677 --> 00:43:57,095
Do you consent?

289
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,308
Yes. I do.

290
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,978
I declare you united in marriage.

291
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:18,759
As part of the Peace Treaty,

292
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:23,390
these masterpieces will be placed
under the care of your archbishops.

293
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:26,768
These works now belong
to the people of France.

294
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:37,945
To the savior of the Republic!

295
00:45:37,946 --> 00:45:39,697
And to Madam Bonaparte.

296
00:45:39,698 --> 00:45:41,241
To Madam Bonaparte.

297
00:45:59,468 --> 00:46:01,470
This guy right next to me?

298
00:46:13,857 --> 00:46:15,234
He wants my saber.

299
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:33,961
Let that good work make us a son.

300
00:46:51,019 --> 00:46:52,938
Is this what will happen from now on?

301
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:06,785
I marry you and you leave?

302
00:47:15,002 --> 00:47:18,172
Every time you leave,
I have no assurance of your return.

303
00:47:29,308 --> 00:47:31,435
My sweet Joséphine...

304
00:47:36,481 --> 00:47:39,401
The only thing you can depend on
in this world...

305
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,696
is that I shall always return to you.

306
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,215
<i>Dear Joséphine,</i>

307
00:48:02,174 --> 00:48:06,385
{\an8}<i>I follow in the footsteps
of Alexander the Great and Caesar,</i>

308
00:48:06,386 --> 00:48:08,472
{\an8}<i>as I have been sent to liberate Egypt.</i>

309
00:48:09,765 --> 00:48:12,016
<i>I have 40,000 men,</i>

310
00:48:12,017 --> 00:48:16,104
<i>and the sights are wondrous,
and the weather is stifling hot.</i>

311
00:48:17,773 --> 00:48:21,193
<i>I have already conquered Italy,
who surrendered without conflict.</i>

312
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:26,489
<i>The Directory has approved
my plan for attacking England</i>

313
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:28,075
<i>through their eastern empire.</i>

314
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:32,913
<i>But my achievements seem slight,
as they keep us apart.</i>

315
00:49:00,065 --> 00:49:01,066
Bad luck?

316
00:49:13,078 --> 00:49:15,163
You may bring those two out, if you wish.

317
00:49:17,082 --> 00:49:20,335
Thank you, madam.
Been a great pleasure playing with you.

318
00:49:22,754 --> 00:49:24,882
Perhaps something, if your fortune
might change later on?

319
00:49:25,674 --> 00:49:27,509
- I'll take it. Thank you.
- Sir.

320
00:49:38,604 --> 00:49:42,816
<i>My dear Joséphine,
Away from you there is no joy.</i>

321
00:49:45,569 --> 00:49:50,240
<i>You have robbed me of more than my soul.
You are the one part of my life.</i>

322
00:49:56,121 --> 00:49:57,288
You like it?

323
00:49:57,289 --> 00:49:58,956
I like it a lot.

324
00:49:58,957 --> 00:50:02,418
<i>I know not if you want money,
for you never speak to me of business.</i>

325
00:50:02,419 --> 00:50:04,879
<i>If you do, will you ask my brother for it?</i>

326
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,422
<i>He has 200 louis of mine.</i>

327
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:08,675
Ladies, do you like it?

328
00:50:11,094 --> 00:50:12,386
I love it.

329
00:50:12,387 --> 00:50:13,597
I'll take that now.

330
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:18,936
<i>Dear wife,</i>

331
00:50:19,895 --> 00:50:22,564
<i>This love I have for you
is a kind of death.</i>

332
00:50:23,482 --> 00:50:25,858
<i>There is no survival for me except in you.</i>

333
00:50:25,859 --> 00:50:27,360
Hello again.

334
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:28,695
<i>What are you doing?</i>

335
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:30,363
<i>No letters from you.</i>

336
00:50:30,364 --> 00:50:31,489
Good morning, Lucille.

337
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:33,951
<i>If you loved me,
you'd write me twice a day.</i>

338
00:50:34,826 --> 00:50:37,245
<i>Tell me there are no snakes in your bed,</i>

339
00:50:37,246 --> 00:50:40,624
<i>in your legs, inside what is mine.</i>

340
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:43,376
<i>You must write me and tell me</i>

341
00:50:43,377 --> 00:50:46,964
<i>that you realize that I love you
beyond the limits of imagination,</i>

342
00:50:47,756 --> 00:50:49,967
<i>that only you can please me.</i>

343
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:07,145
Thank you.

344
00:53:08,438 --> 00:53:10,481
- Absolutely. I like it.
- That's very ni...

345
00:53:10,482 --> 00:53:13,902
You know they have white, silky things.
Amazing.

346
00:53:59,573 --> 00:54:04,328
Are there limits to what I can tell you?

347
00:54:06,371 --> 00:54:07,414
There shouldn't be.

348
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:12,461
Should I tell you something
at the risk of giving you personal pain?

349
00:54:14,546 --> 00:54:15,547
Yes.

350
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:27,267
Your wife has taken
a lover named Hippolyte Charles.

351
00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:49,957
- You expect me to believe this?
- Yes.

352
00:54:52,209 --> 00:54:54,545
That my wife would do this to me?

353
00:54:55,671 --> 00:54:56,672
Yes.

354
00:55:07,057 --> 00:55:09,434
No dessert for you. You may leave.

355
00:55:13,146 --> 00:55:14,398
I would never lie to you.

356
00:55:30,998 --> 00:55:31,999
How do you know this?

357
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:41,842
Lucille is my lover. She writes to me.

358
00:55:43,385 --> 00:55:45,429
Joséphine's lady-in-waiting is your lover?

359
00:55:56,815 --> 00:56:00,569
Prepare two frigates and two
smaller vessels in the greatest secrecy.

360
00:56:02,029 --> 00:56:03,363
I'm returning home.

361
00:56:03,989 --> 00:56:05,656
Napoleon,

362
00:56:05,657 --> 00:56:07,743
this will be seen as desertion.

363
00:56:10,454 --> 00:56:14,041
General Kléber will be informed of
his succession to command after I've left.

364
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:27,721
Order arms!

365
00:56:39,107 --> 00:56:41,401
Napoleon the victorious!

366
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:16,436
Hyah!

367
00:57:31,952 --> 00:57:33,202
Where's my wife?

368
00:57:33,203 --> 00:57:35,038
She has left to greet you in Lyon.

369
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:38,165
Do not lie to me. Where is my wife?

370
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:40,001
She left earlier today, General.

371
00:57:40,002 --> 00:57:41,961
- Lyon?
- Yes, sir.

372
00:57:41,962 --> 00:57:45,174
The entire world knows of my arrival,
but not my wife?

373
00:58:09,656 --> 00:58:10,824
Forgive me for earlier.

374
00:58:11,408 --> 00:58:12,409
Yes, sir.

375
00:58:19,875 --> 00:58:20,876
Sit with me.

376
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,347
My wife has humiliated me,
and I need comfort, Lucille.

377
00:58:34,348 --> 00:58:36,808
Yes, I'm sure that you do, General.

378
00:58:39,478 --> 00:58:41,605
What do you suggest would give me comfort?

379
00:58:42,314 --> 00:58:44,858
I can draw you a hot bath, General.

380
00:58:48,111 --> 00:58:50,155
I can prepare you something sweet...

381
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:53,825
and console you.

382
00:59:41,456 --> 00:59:43,375
What kind of creature are you?

383
00:59:46,503 --> 00:59:51,008
How could you care so little
for me and my feelings?

384
00:59:52,384 --> 00:59:54,970
You are a selfish little pig.

385
00:59:57,431 --> 00:59:59,433
Do you think so lowly of me?

386
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:02,643
No. I don't.

387
01:00:02,644 --> 01:00:03,729
Then why?

388
01:00:06,481 --> 01:00:09,526
Because you're what? Say it.

389
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:14,781
I'm sorry.

390
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:16,950
That's not enough.

391
01:00:18,785 --> 01:00:21,704
- What do you want me to say?
- I want you to say

392
01:00:21,705 --> 01:00:25,083
that I am the most important thing
in the world!

393
01:00:26,251 --> 01:00:27,418
You are.

394
01:00:27,419 --> 01:00:29,962
- Say it!
- You're...

395
01:00:29,963 --> 01:00:34,717
You're the most important thing
in my life, in the world. You a...

396
01:00:34,718 --> 01:00:38,137
- And without me, you are nothing.
- I'm nothing.

397
01:00:38,138 --> 01:00:39,890
And you will do anything!

398
01:00:40,974 --> 01:00:42,309
I'll do anything.

399
01:00:45,854 --> 01:00:47,481
I'm not built like other men.

400
01:00:50,859 --> 01:00:53,195
And I'm not subject to petty insecurity.

401
01:00:58,867 --> 01:01:00,160
You're a beast.

402
01:01:04,915 --> 01:01:06,291
I feel sorry for you.

403
01:01:10,629 --> 01:01:11,922
You want to be great?

404
01:01:19,763 --> 01:01:22,182
You are nothing without me.

405
01:01:23,725 --> 01:01:24,726
Say it.

406
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:34,194
Say it.

407
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:45,789
You are just a brute
that is nothing without me.

408
01:01:47,165 --> 01:01:51,127
I am just a brute
that is nothing without you.

409
01:01:51,128 --> 01:01:52,087
Yes.

410
01:01:52,088 --> 01:01:58,844
You are nothing without me or your mother.

411
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:03,599
My mother...

412
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:19,698
Did you have affairs?

413
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:23,410
Of course I did.

414
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:32,211
And did you love them?

415
01:02:33,837 --> 01:02:35,881
No. No, I did not.

416
01:02:42,179 --> 01:02:43,305
Were they pretty?

417
01:02:45,516 --> 01:02:47,351
Yes, some of them.

418
01:02:50,354 --> 01:02:51,855
They served their purpose.

419
01:02:54,107 --> 01:02:55,108
More than I do?

420
01:02:56,068 --> 01:02:59,905
They cried less.
That made them more attractive.

421
01:03:03,325 --> 01:03:04,326
Don't...

422
01:03:05,661 --> 01:03:08,205
Don't leave me. Please, don't leave me.

423
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,502
Just don't leave me.

424
01:03:15,254 --> 01:03:18,340
You don't have to forgive me.
Just promise me you won't leave again.

425
01:03:24,096 --> 01:03:27,807
What is it that made you desert
your troops in Egypt?

426
01:03:27,808 --> 01:03:28,892
Shh!

427
01:03:31,311 --> 01:03:32,312
Citizens...

428
01:03:34,606 --> 01:03:35,858
what country are we in?

429
01:03:39,653 --> 01:03:42,656
Because she doesn't resemble
the France that I left.

430
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:49,246
Who should be responsible
for her governance while I'm away?

431
01:03:50,873 --> 01:03:53,000
Because it is not you, Citizen Gohier.

432
01:03:53,834 --> 01:03:54,834
It is not you.

433
01:03:54,835 --> 01:03:58,630
It certainly is not you.
Although you're very good at scowling.

434
01:04:01,466 --> 01:04:03,676
It is not you, Barras.

435
01:04:03,677 --> 01:04:04,803
Or you, Talleyrand.

436
01:04:06,221 --> 01:04:07,222
Or you, Sieyès.

437
01:04:08,265 --> 01:04:09,766
So, who?

438
01:04:11,268 --> 01:04:13,896
Who should be responsible?
Fouché, do you have any ideas?

439
01:04:15,272 --> 01:04:16,690
No?

440
01:04:18,483 --> 01:04:21,278
I have returned to France
to find her bankrupt.

441
01:04:22,696 --> 01:04:25,032
Printing money that is spent within hours,

442
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:29,244
the Austro-Russian overrun of Italy,

443
01:04:30,329 --> 01:04:32,581
the Anglo-Russian occupation of Holland,

444
01:04:33,332 --> 01:04:39,213
and what appears to be
the imminent invasion of France herself.

445
01:04:42,174 --> 01:04:45,677
And yet, you accuse me of desertion.

446
01:04:47,095 --> 01:04:50,474
Added to which the discovery
that my wife is a slut.

447
01:05:03,654 --> 01:05:08,825
The only thing that every French citizen
can agree on is that you are our Caesar.

448
01:05:12,412 --> 01:05:13,413
What do you want?

449
01:05:17,501 --> 01:05:18,502
Well...

450
01:05:20,963 --> 01:05:24,424
the people would accept my rule
if I have your support.

451
01:05:26,802 --> 01:05:31,431
Like you, though,
I believe that the Directory is corrupt.

452
01:05:33,058 --> 01:05:37,980
But together, we can save this country
from a restoration of the monarchy,

453
01:05:38,939 --> 01:05:41,191
and we can preserve
the ideals of the Revolution.

454
01:05:43,902 --> 01:05:47,656
And I think that
a seizure of power is possible

455
01:05:48,991 --> 01:05:50,825
with your help, at the right time.

456
01:05:50,826 --> 01:05:54,121
And I think this is the right time.

457
01:05:54,872 --> 01:05:57,541
So, you expect me to be your sword?

458
01:06:04,173 --> 01:06:09,011
I expect that a coup d'état,
well-timed, well-executed...

459
01:06:11,597 --> 01:06:14,558
could transfer power
into the hands of three consuls:

460
01:06:15,475 --> 01:06:16,768
myself, Ducos...

461
01:06:19,354 --> 01:06:20,397
and you.

462
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:24,902
I'm inviting you to the winning side.

463
01:06:29,198 --> 01:06:31,575
Myself and Ducos will resign first,

464
01:06:32,284 --> 01:06:35,746
followed by Barras, Gohier, and Moulin.

465
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:40,876
And this will create an opening
to transfer power.

466
01:06:42,002 --> 01:06:45,672
Yeah, I like Barras,
but he is corrupt and isolated.

467
01:06:46,507 --> 01:06:49,425
I think, given the proper threat,
he will quickly make the right decision.

468
01:06:49,426 --> 01:06:53,721
As for the others,
Gohier and Moulin, is it?

469
01:06:53,722 --> 01:06:55,056
I don't know.

470
01:06:55,057 --> 01:06:57,475
There are ways
to dissuade them from resistance.

471
01:06:57,476 --> 01:07:01,646
Yes, but this may not become
a military or a violent matter.

472
01:07:01,647 --> 01:07:03,731
It will be a police matter.

473
01:07:03,732 --> 01:07:04,691
Yes.

474
01:07:04,692 --> 01:07:06,235
Lucien...

475
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:09,987
As Governor of the Council of 500,

476
01:07:09,988 --> 01:07:14,326
you will persuade both Councils,
at an emergency session,

477
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:18,288
that a Jacobin coup is at hand,

478
01:07:19,206 --> 01:07:23,209
and that the only safe place
is out of Paris,

479
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:26,588
away from the Parisian mob,
at Saint-Cloud,

480
01:07:27,673 --> 01:07:32,553
where we'll then save them
from this threat.

481
01:07:38,016 --> 01:07:39,225
Can I be honest?

482
01:07:39,226 --> 01:07:41,894
There's only one problem
with Sieyès and Ducos's plan.

483
01:07:41,895 --> 01:07:44,731
And that's Sieyès and Ducos.

484
01:07:45,524 --> 01:07:47,525
They don't know you're...
You've got all the power.

485
01:07:47,526 --> 01:07:49,820
You're taking all the risks.
You're doing all the work.

486
01:07:52,072 --> 01:07:54,157
I don't know why
you're bringing them along with you.

487
01:07:56,785 --> 01:07:58,412
Well, I'll need ladies-in-waiting.

488
01:08:00,122 --> 01:08:02,916
Ladies-in-waiting, huh? Doing what?

489
01:08:03,417 --> 01:08:05,209
Well, tending to things.

490
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:06,752
- Tending?
- Yes.

491
01:08:06,753 --> 01:08:09,297
You think those fucking idiots could tend?

492
01:08:09,298 --> 01:08:11,925
They couldn't tend...
I wouldn't let them tend to my balls.

493
01:08:12,926 --> 01:08:14,677
- Precisely.
- Yeah.

494
01:08:14,678 --> 01:08:15,596
I'll need that.

495
01:08:15,597 --> 01:08:18,640
Tongue bath?
I wouldn't let them wipe my arse.

496
01:08:30,736 --> 01:08:33,947
From this moment on,
all friends that you've had,

497
01:08:34,781 --> 01:08:40,162
anyone from the society of the Directory,
cannot be trusted. That life is over.

498
01:08:43,207 --> 01:08:45,584
Well, what's the outcome of this
if you don't succeed?

499
01:08:54,801 --> 01:08:56,261
By this time tomorrow,

500
01:08:56,803 --> 01:08:59,263
you will be sleeping with
the First Consul of France

501
01:08:59,264 --> 01:09:01,892
and I will stick it to you.

502
01:09:04,603 --> 01:09:07,146
It's a simple letter of resignation
we would like you to...

503
01:09:07,147 --> 01:09:09,357
I am not signing anything.

504
01:09:09,358 --> 01:09:12,735
You can piss before I sign anything away!

505
01:09:12,736 --> 01:09:13,819
Gentlemen.

506
01:09:22,746 --> 01:09:24,206
Who's doing this?

507
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:26,707
Good morning, Paul.

508
01:09:29,877 --> 01:09:32,005
I'm going to make this very simple
for you.

509
01:09:33,006 --> 01:09:36,385
I have documents announcing
your resignation from the Council.

510
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:40,055
You must retire
before you have your breakfast, please.

511
01:09:41,305 --> 01:09:45,644
Tell them I return with joy
to the ranks of simple citizen.

512
01:09:47,604 --> 01:09:48,604
I shall.

513
01:09:53,861 --> 01:09:55,863
There are some gentlemen here to see you.

514
01:09:56,697 --> 01:10:00,617
Citizen Moulin, we have
a letter of resignation for you to sign.

515
01:10:01,493 --> 01:10:04,245
- No. I am eating my breakfast.
- No.

516
01:10:04,246 --> 01:10:06,998
I am enjoying a succulent breakfast.

517
01:10:06,999 --> 01:10:11,419
This is outrageous! I shall finish
my breakfast before you touch me!

518
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:14,339
- No!
- Enjoy your breakfast.

519
01:10:35,944 --> 01:10:37,237
Director!

520
01:10:38,071 --> 01:10:40,448
I believe the time has come
to demand an explanation.

521
01:10:40,449 --> 01:10:41,950
Hear, hear!

522
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:47,371
This emergency session
is to draw a list of nominations

523
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:51,960
for a new Directory
to deal with the threat...

524
01:10:52,669 --> 01:10:54,629
the threat of the royalists.

525
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:56,839
We are being asked to pass a resolution

526
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,760
forming a provisional government
to three councils:

527
01:11:00,886 --> 01:11:04,389
General Bonaparte and Citizen Sieyès
and Roger Ducos.

528
01:11:05,974 --> 01:11:08,101
Where are the five members
of the Directory?

529
01:11:10,312 --> 01:11:12,230
Have they magically disappeared?

530
01:11:12,231 --> 01:11:17,360
And we are here, surrounded by troops,
isolated far from Paris.

531
01:11:17,361 --> 01:11:19,028
Order!

532
01:11:19,029 --> 01:11:21,949
This is becoming increasingly clear:

533
01:11:22,866 --> 01:11:25,744
that your brother, Napoleon Bonaparte,

534
01:11:26,954 --> 01:11:30,832
with his show of military might,
is acting as an outlaw.

535
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:34,085
A vote will solve this matter.

536
01:11:34,086 --> 01:11:37,922
And that this is
a ridiculous and poorly executed takeover.

537
01:11:37,923 --> 01:11:39,633
A power-hungry upstart.

538
01:11:40,425 --> 01:11:42,677
Enough!

539
01:11:42,678 --> 01:11:46,681
If there is any question
of what is happening here, I will answer!

540
01:11:46,682 --> 01:11:48,057
How dare you!

541
01:11:48,058 --> 01:11:51,978
This is...
You have violated the constitution!

542
01:11:51,979 --> 01:11:54,106
- You have...
- Hold him!

543
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:56,400
Get him!

544
01:12:03,448 --> 01:12:05,659
- Arrest him!
- Stop him!

545
01:12:07,369 --> 01:12:08,662
Oh, fuck!

546
01:12:14,168 --> 01:12:15,544
Kill him!

547
01:12:22,759 --> 01:12:24,469
Let me through!

548
01:12:27,514 --> 01:12:28,764
Right.

549
01:12:28,765 --> 01:12:32,936
We are being terrorized
by deputies armed with daggers!

550
01:12:33,478 --> 01:12:36,939
And these madmen have outlawed themselves

551
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:39,650
by their attempt
on the liberty of this country!

552
01:12:39,651 --> 01:12:42,237
- They're trying to kill me!
- They're trying to kill him.

553
01:12:42,738 --> 01:12:44,406
Open these doors!

554
01:12:49,036 --> 01:12:50,703
Let us out of here!

555
01:12:50,704 --> 01:12:55,626
I will kill my brother if he betrays
the freedom of the French people!

556
01:12:57,085 --> 01:12:58,586
Get in there now!

557
01:12:58,587 --> 01:13:00,005
Fuck.

558
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,887
Move. Get back. Back.

559
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:09,556
Move it!

560
01:13:11,433 --> 01:13:14,561
- Back. Move back.
- Move back. Out of the way.

561
01:13:15,229 --> 01:13:17,314
Move. Backwards.

562
01:13:23,779 --> 01:13:25,113
Good luck, brother.

563
01:13:35,832 --> 01:13:36,834
Stand aside.

564
01:13:49,763 --> 01:13:51,014
Shall we vote?

565
01:13:54,518 --> 01:13:55,519
Where are we going?

566
01:13:58,313 --> 01:14:00,232
All our harsh words are behind us.

567
01:14:03,068 --> 01:14:05,612
I need you to be my most tender friend.

568
01:14:09,449 --> 01:14:12,619
Over this door is our destiny.

569
01:15:29,363 --> 01:15:31,365
Present arms!

570
01:15:43,919 --> 01:15:46,004
- First Consul.
- My lord.

571
01:15:47,005 --> 01:15:48,006
Milady.

572
01:15:50,926 --> 01:15:51,844
First Consul.

573
01:15:51,845 --> 01:15:53,803
- Citizen Bonaparte.
- Citizen Bonaparte.

574
01:15:53,804 --> 01:15:55,429
- First Consul.
- Citizen Bonaparte.

575
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:56,723
First Consul.

576
01:16:00,269 --> 01:16:01,562
Come, little one.

577
01:16:02,271 --> 01:16:05,190
You get into the bed of your master's.

578
01:16:10,362 --> 01:16:13,073
The decision of dress
is not just a matter of taste.

579
01:16:13,991 --> 01:16:16,910
It is policy that guards against
the return of a fatal regime.

580
01:16:17,494 --> 01:16:19,454
And so our uniforms must be rich.

581
01:16:20,581 --> 01:16:23,041
For staff, each a red coat.

582
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:27,087
For winter made in velvet,
and summer some other material.

583
01:16:27,671 --> 01:16:29,298
Both embroidered in gold.

584
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:51,235
Hello, madame!

585
01:16:51,236 --> 01:16:52,905
Hello, good evening.

586
01:16:58,452 --> 01:17:00,077
Mother, the Duke of Avignon.

587
01:17:00,078 --> 01:17:01,330
It's good to meet you.

588
01:17:12,466 --> 01:17:13,842
Could this be Joséphine?

589
01:17:15,052 --> 01:17:17,679
- Mother, Joséphine. Joséphine, Mother.
- Good to see you.

590
01:17:19,389 --> 01:17:20,474
It's Charles.

591
01:17:21,433 --> 01:17:22,434
This way.

592
01:17:43,038 --> 01:17:44,998
- Good evening. How are you?
- I'm very well.

593
01:17:46,792 --> 01:17:47,793
Mother.

594
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:50,920
Hello... It's a pleasure to...

595
01:17:50,921 --> 01:17:52,004
Her voice.

596
01:17:52,005 --> 01:17:55,675
- I hope you're having a wonderful night.
- Thank you very much.

597
01:17:55,676 --> 01:17:59,136
- Hello, sir. Hello, mademoiselle...
- Hello.

598
01:17:59,137 --> 01:18:00,889
So happy to see you.

599
01:18:06,395 --> 01:18:09,981
"Your Majesty, England
and France are wasting their prosperity."

600
01:18:09,982 --> 01:18:10,983
Let me try again.

601
01:18:13,485 --> 01:18:16,112
Your Royal Majesty, England and France

602
01:18:16,113 --> 01:18:18,991
- are wasting their prosperity...
- Your Majesty.

603
01:18:19,616 --> 01:18:20,784
What did I say?

604
01:18:22,369 --> 01:18:25,080
"Your Royal Majesty."

605
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:27,666
"Your Royal Ma"...

606
01:18:28,542 --> 01:18:32,337
Your Majesty, England
and France are wasting their prosperity.

607
01:18:34,715 --> 01:18:37,133
I am not ashamed to take the initiative.

608
01:18:37,134 --> 01:18:39,969
I have, I think,
sufficiently proven to the whole world

609
01:18:39,970 --> 01:18:42,890
that I do not fear the chances of war.

610
01:18:44,224 --> 01:18:48,520
But peace is my heartfelt wish
for England and France.

611
01:18:49,938 --> 01:18:50,939
Read it back to me.

612
01:18:51,857 --> 01:18:55,359
I have notified all foreign powers
of your accession to the Consul,

613
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:58,946
I have addressed letters
to all diplomatic agents abroad,

614
01:18:58,947 --> 01:19:02,950
{\an8}and I understand that you have made
friendly overtures of peace to England.

615
01:19:02,951 --> 01:19:04,328
{\an8}Caulaincourt.

616
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:08,164
What I need from you is
a better understanding

617
01:19:08,165 --> 01:19:10,042
of the Russian Tsar Alexander.

618
01:19:10,751 --> 01:19:13,587
Would you consider the tsar an ally
to England or France?

619
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:19,383
Well, I would think that his trade
with England is more beneficial to him

620
01:19:19,384 --> 01:19:20,886
than his trade with France.

621
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:25,598
And do you have a sense of
British influence in the Russian courts?

622
01:19:25,599 --> 01:19:28,185
I do not,
but I imagine it is quite robust.

623
01:19:29,478 --> 01:19:30,562
Robust?

624
01:19:35,651 --> 01:19:38,487
What kind of man is he? Describe him.

625
01:19:40,072 --> 01:19:41,907
Well, he's young.

626
01:19:43,575 --> 01:19:44,618
He's vain.

627
01:19:46,286 --> 01:19:48,287
He's popular, and he wishes to remain so.

628
01:19:48,288 --> 01:19:49,456
He's popular?

629
01:19:52,251 --> 01:19:53,251
Really?

630
01:19:53,252 --> 01:19:56,463
His greatest fear is to be killed
in his bed, like his father.

631
01:19:59,299 --> 01:20:03,595
This makes him dangerously fickle
to whoever last has his attention.

632
01:20:04,721 --> 01:20:07,808
So he needs an ally
that he can also call a friend.

633
01:20:14,773 --> 01:20:15,983
No more bets.

634
01:20:19,653 --> 01:20:21,029
What a surprise.

635
01:20:21,697 --> 01:20:23,073
How nice to see you out.

636
01:20:24,157 --> 01:20:25,409
Excuse me, gentlemen.

637
01:20:25,909 --> 01:20:28,412
Good evening.
I'm just trying to lose some money.

638
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:32,081
Well, after this hand,
why don't you come and join me?

639
01:20:32,082 --> 01:20:33,875
I'm at my usual table.

640
01:20:33,876 --> 01:20:35,127
That's a lovely idea.

641
01:20:37,171 --> 01:20:38,172
Good evening.

642
01:20:40,591 --> 01:20:41,758
Did you hear?

643
01:20:43,594 --> 01:20:48,515
Your Majesty received a letter of peace
from the First Consul today.

644
01:20:50,392 --> 01:20:53,978
Monsieur Talleyrand, if I may be honest?

645
01:20:53,979 --> 01:20:55,062
Of course.

646
01:20:55,063 --> 01:20:59,901
Austria's coalition with England is
in such a strong position against France,

647
01:20:59,902 --> 01:21:03,863
that these peace overtures are clearly

648
01:21:03,864 --> 01:21:06,325
only for your handling
of French public opinion.

649
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,328
Oh, my friend.

650
01:21:11,371 --> 01:21:13,040
You know me so well.

651
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:17,668
Yes, it is true.
It is public opinion Napoleon is after.

652
01:21:17,669 --> 01:21:20,713
But my warning to you
is that he's as hungry for it

653
01:21:20,714 --> 01:21:22,882
as any man in the history of the world.

654
01:21:22,883 --> 01:21:24,759
So my suggestion, with respect,

655
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:28,597
would be to take
this little offering of peace from him...

656
01:21:31,642 --> 01:21:37,356
or suffer the consequences
from a man bent on peace at any cost.

657
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:42,611
The English ambassador, Lord Whitworth,
has arrived, Consul.

658
01:21:51,495 --> 01:21:54,706
Do not look at me as if
you don't know what I'm about to say.

659
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:59,127
Are you aware of my letter of peace
to your king?

660
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:00,963
I am not.

661
01:22:02,422 --> 01:22:03,715
Shall I repeat it?

662
01:22:05,008 --> 01:22:06,844
No, you may not.

663
01:22:07,553 --> 01:22:09,929
Take this as a warning to your king.

664
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:12,682
I will keep you guessing and scared.

665
01:22:12,683 --> 01:22:14,892
You will watch your borders and your back,

666
01:22:14,893 --> 01:22:17,895
and your manners are bound,
sooner or later, to be French.

667
01:22:17,896 --> 01:22:20,356
I will offer no more letters of peace,

668
01:22:20,357 --> 01:22:24,861
and I will take the lack of a swift reply
as an act of disrespect!

669
01:22:24,862 --> 01:22:28,073
You think you're so great
because you have boats!

670
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:34,746
'Tis a shame such a great man
should have no manners.

671
01:22:38,041 --> 01:22:39,751
Stronger blue around Minorca.

672
01:22:45,674 --> 01:22:47,133
Take care. No.

673
01:22:47,134 --> 01:22:49,386
First Consul, don't walk there.
The paint's still wet.

674
01:22:49,970 --> 01:22:54,933
If you want to walk,
walk on Italy. Italy is dry.

675
01:23:00,564 --> 01:23:04,526
The Austrians have consolidated
their forces here, First Consul.

676
01:23:05,527 --> 01:23:08,197
To secure control
of the peninsula's northern half.

677
01:23:09,489 --> 01:23:13,368
South of Alessandria. In Marengo.

678
01:23:14,203 --> 01:23:16,245
Their cavalry reinforced, morale high.

679
01:23:16,246 --> 01:23:19,291
Their military
is very well provisioned for battle.

680
01:23:44,191 --> 01:23:47,276
We will be light. We will be swift.

681
01:23:47,277 --> 01:23:50,072
We will cross the great crest of the Alps.

682
01:23:50,864 --> 01:23:53,825
And we will restore what France lost
while I was away.

683
01:24:43,917 --> 01:24:44,918
Yes?

684
01:24:47,504 --> 01:24:48,505
Are you pleased?

685
01:24:51,175 --> 01:24:53,677
Are you about to tell me
something that will make me angry?

686
01:24:54,636 --> 01:24:56,012
Let's hope not.

687
01:24:56,013 --> 01:25:00,726
The European families think
nothing more of you than a Corsican thug.

688
01:25:01,476 --> 01:25:02,311
Therefore,

689
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:06,940
I'm going to suggest something
that's been a long time arriving.

690
01:25:07,983 --> 01:25:12,654
I suggest that you abandon
your role as First Consul of France

691
01:25:13,614 --> 01:25:18,035
in exchange for the title
"Victorious Consul."

692
01:25:20,078 --> 01:25:22,497
By another name, "king."

693
01:25:25,459 --> 01:25:26,460
What?

694
01:25:28,003 --> 01:25:28,921
"King."

695
01:25:31,507 --> 01:25:32,633
Yes, king.

696
01:25:35,219 --> 01:25:36,220
King?

697
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:58,116
My hair has been set.

698
01:25:59,117 --> 01:26:00,994
The way you like it.

699
01:26:04,915 --> 01:26:07,584
Oh, you filthy man.
My hair has been set now.

700
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:14,131
I have the most beautiful wife.

701
01:26:14,132 --> 01:26:16,134
I... All right, come on then.

702
01:26:19,179 --> 01:26:20,180
Hat off.

703
01:26:27,396 --> 01:26:29,189
Give me your hand.

704
01:26:30,274 --> 01:26:32,109
- You feel that?
- What?

705
01:26:33,735 --> 01:26:34,861
Can you feel that?

706
01:26:34,862 --> 01:26:36,822
That's yours.

707
01:26:37,406 --> 01:26:38,531
It's yours.

708
01:26:38,532 --> 01:26:39,616
Thank you.

709
01:28:06,036 --> 01:28:09,289
<i>This conspiracy of
royals against me is clear.</i>

710
01:28:10,332 --> 01:28:14,168
All exiled Bourbons whose single aim
is to overthrow my rule

711
01:28:14,169 --> 01:28:16,922
and reinstate their filthy
perfume-Monarchy.

712
01:28:17,589 --> 01:28:19,632
The Prince de Conde
is smuggling out plotters,

713
01:28:19,633 --> 01:28:21,717
and his grandson, Louis,
the Duke d'Enghien,

714
01:28:21,718 --> 01:28:23,928
is on the frontier
solely for that purpose.

715
01:28:23,929 --> 01:28:27,683
I want this man seized,
and I want him brought swiftly to justice.

716
01:28:29,601 --> 01:28:30,602
Where is he?

717
01:28:31,186 --> 01:28:32,186
He's in Baden.

718
01:28:32,187 --> 01:28:35,523
First Consul, I know this man.
He is not a conspirator against you.

719
01:28:35,524 --> 01:28:37,483
He is a brave and excellent officer,

720
01:28:37,484 --> 01:28:39,652
- much loved by the soldiery.
- He's a filthy Bourbon weasel

721
01:28:39,653 --> 01:28:43,574
who will be punished
for his part in this plot against me.

722
01:28:44,658 --> 01:28:46,200
If you proceed to Baden,

723
01:28:46,201 --> 01:28:49,287
you will be operating outside of France
and so far outside the law

724
01:28:49,288 --> 01:28:51,957
that it will be impossible
for anyone to ignore.

725
01:28:56,211 --> 01:28:57,212
I see.

726
01:28:59,131 --> 01:29:01,633
Well, I've always
profited from your judgment.

727
01:29:02,217 --> 01:29:05,344
And now it's time to profit
from watching you close your mouth.

728
01:29:05,345 --> 01:29:06,722
Seize the Duke.

729
01:29:18,275 --> 01:29:20,444
You're letting your hatred
make your decision.

730
01:29:22,988 --> 01:29:26,866
In a year's time, you will regard
this execution as an act of great policy,

731
01:29:26,867 --> 01:29:29,244
and you will kiss my mouth
with those words.

732
01:29:30,537 --> 01:29:31,538
Go to bed.

733
01:29:54,436 --> 01:29:55,646
You are Frenchmen.

734
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,107
At least you will do me the service
not to miss your aim.

735
01:30:00,984 --> 01:30:02,778
May I command the execution?

736
01:30:03,654 --> 01:30:05,989
You are charged
with bearing arms against France.

737
01:30:06,823 --> 01:30:09,535
Proceed to ready. Aim.

738
01:30:17,459 --> 01:30:18,836
You may command the execution.

739
01:30:23,257 --> 01:30:24,550
Aim for the heart.

740
01:30:25,759 --> 01:30:26,969
Fire.

741
01:30:46,113 --> 01:30:47,197
Stop.

742
01:30:48,031 --> 01:30:49,408
Why aren't you pregnant?

743
01:30:53,704 --> 01:30:56,999
Is that a question,
or is that an accusation?

744
01:31:01,211 --> 01:31:02,421
It was a question.

745
01:31:04,798 --> 01:31:06,008
Now it's an accusation.

746
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:12,723
Well, I've seen Dr. Corvisart,
and he has no answer.

747
01:31:17,102 --> 01:31:19,771
Only that I do
what Madame de Rémusat has done.

748
01:31:22,149 --> 01:31:23,150
Which is?

749
01:31:24,735 --> 01:31:25,944
Which is...

750
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:30,990
along with hopeful thinking
and a bit of red wine,

751
01:31:30,991 --> 01:31:33,911
he suggested I take the waters
at Aix-la-Chapelle.

752
01:31:37,372 --> 01:31:38,582
And why haven't you?

753
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:42,835
As wife of the First Consul,
I haven't found the time.

754
01:31:42,836 --> 01:31:45,839
I spend many hours cleaning up after you.

755
01:31:50,385 --> 01:31:51,845
Find the time.

756
01:31:54,181 --> 01:31:57,017
I don't need to explain
to you the importance of this, do I?

757
01:31:57,976 --> 01:31:59,269
What, you want an heir?

758
01:32:00,062 --> 01:32:01,813
I want one now.

759
01:32:19,498 --> 01:32:21,375
Oh, my God.

760
01:33:09,631 --> 01:33:12,342
May God affirm you on his throne,

761
01:33:13,677 --> 01:33:18,640
and Christ give you to rule with him
in his eternal kingdom.

762
01:33:44,708 --> 01:33:48,003
I found the crown of France in the gutter.

763
01:33:50,005 --> 01:33:54,343
I picked it up with the tip of my sword
and cleaned it...

764
01:33:56,428 --> 01:33:58,555
and place it atop my own head.

765
01:34:25,165 --> 01:34:30,461
The most glorious,
the most august Napoleon,

766
01:34:30,462 --> 01:34:33,089
emperor of the French,

767
01:34:33,090 --> 01:34:36,510
is crowned and enthroned!

768
01:34:37,344 --> 01:34:41,640
Long live the emperor!

769
01:34:42,224 --> 01:34:44,142
Long live the emperor!

770
01:35:20,679 --> 01:35:21,763
Fire!

771
01:35:25,684 --> 01:35:26,810
Fire!

772
01:35:27,895 --> 01:35:29,146
Captain Charles.

773
01:35:41,283 --> 01:35:42,743
Captain Charles.

774
01:35:48,874 --> 01:35:50,250
Captain Charles...

775
01:35:54,505 --> 01:35:57,424
I must confess something to you
in the greatest secrecy.

776
01:35:58,967 --> 01:36:00,385
It is indiscreet.

777
01:36:00,928 --> 01:36:02,513
And I hope you will not blush.

778
01:36:05,641 --> 01:36:06,934
Do you have children?

779
01:36:07,851 --> 01:36:10,062
Yes, Majesty. I have three sons.

780
01:36:12,105 --> 01:36:14,483
If you please,
may I ask you something personal?

781
01:36:15,734 --> 01:36:17,277
Of course, Majesty.

782
01:36:20,572 --> 01:36:25,619
Tell me, when you made your wife pregnant,
did you spend much time?

783
01:36:29,164 --> 01:36:31,041
I don't remember, Majesty.

784
01:36:32,042 --> 01:36:33,418
If you were to guess.

785
01:36:36,046 --> 01:36:38,799
We sometimes take 30 minutes.

786
01:36:40,133 --> 01:36:43,303
And do you think this is what
your secret is, then, to having a son?

787
01:36:45,097 --> 01:36:47,182
I cannot say for certain, Majesty.

788
01:36:50,477 --> 01:36:51,477
I love my wife.

789
01:36:51,478 --> 01:36:52,604
So do I.

790
01:36:53,814 --> 01:36:55,357
And I wanna see her happy.

791
01:36:56,483 --> 01:36:57,860
So tell me...

792
01:37:00,153 --> 01:37:01,863
do you think it important

793
01:37:01,864 --> 01:37:05,534
for a man to pleasure his lady
in anticipation of entering her?

794
01:37:13,125 --> 01:37:15,419
I don't know what you mean, Majesty.

795
01:37:15,961 --> 01:37:17,546
Don't be shy, Captain.

796
01:37:18,046 --> 01:37:19,047
Tell me.

797
01:37:20,299 --> 01:37:22,050
If I want to have a son,

798
01:37:23,135 --> 01:37:27,097
do you think I should spend time
with my mouth down between my wife's legs?

799
01:37:32,352 --> 01:37:34,313
I would assume, Your Highness,

800
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:37,065
that the more pleasure your wife gets...

801
01:37:37,566 --> 01:37:39,526
the more likely she is to conceive.

802
01:37:44,239 --> 01:37:47,033
Captain Charles, I should like
to thank you for your honesty

803
01:37:47,034 --> 01:37:50,454
in talking about such
uncomfortable matters.

804
01:37:53,123 --> 01:37:54,958
I sought out your advice.

805
01:37:56,251 --> 01:37:59,171
You're a man
of notable cocksmanship and stature.

806
01:37:59,671 --> 01:38:03,008
And you have a pretty face
and a hairdresser's elegance.

807
01:38:05,427 --> 01:38:06,428
Thank you.

808
01:38:08,805 --> 01:38:09,932
You're dismissed.

809
01:38:28,909 --> 01:38:30,701
I do not support this idea.

810
01:38:30,702 --> 01:38:33,454
You suggest divorce after years of debate.

811
01:38:33,455 --> 01:38:35,332
You can see that it has me divided.

812
01:38:39,545 --> 01:38:41,295
I am not ambitious.

813
01:38:41,296 --> 01:38:43,215
I've never declared war with anyone.

814
01:38:46,969 --> 01:38:47,970
No.

815
01:38:50,222 --> 01:38:54,559
You are the greatest leader
in the history of the world

816
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,603
and the world's only chance at peace.

817
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:05,571
The security of the empire and peace
in the world depends upon an heir.

818
01:39:13,245 --> 01:39:14,872
It was an option.

819
01:39:16,498 --> 01:39:18,000
And I said it at the time.

820
01:39:25,257 --> 01:39:26,884
Are you enjoying yourself?

821
01:39:28,844 --> 01:39:31,638
I'm going to war to defend our people,

822
01:39:32,389 --> 01:39:34,850
and my wife cannot provide me an heir.

823
01:39:38,562 --> 01:39:41,231
If you do not bear me a child tonight,

824
01:39:43,025 --> 01:39:44,568
there will be a divorce.

825
01:39:46,945 --> 01:39:50,324
Hasn't been enough lovemaking
in this home to bear a child.

826
01:39:51,408 --> 01:39:52,743
Yes, there has.

827
01:39:54,578 --> 01:39:57,581
There have been years of it. Years.

828
01:39:59,333 --> 01:40:00,751
And with more than just me.

829
01:40:02,169 --> 01:40:05,630
And still you are empty.

830
01:40:05,631 --> 01:40:07,216
And you're fat.

831
01:40:09,009 --> 01:40:12,262
I enjoy my meals. I do.

832
01:40:13,180 --> 01:40:14,931
Destiny has brought me here.

833
01:40:14,932 --> 01:40:17,476
Destiny has brought me this lamb chop.

834
01:40:42,918 --> 01:40:43,919
Joséphine.

835
01:40:48,465 --> 01:40:49,633
Come then.

836
01:40:50,968 --> 01:40:51,969
Come.

837
01:40:58,684 --> 01:41:02,563
I love your talents and your taste.

838
01:41:04,815 --> 01:41:07,484
And while I'm away,
I will miss your grace.

839
01:41:07,985 --> 01:41:09,528
And your dignity.

840
01:41:10,821 --> 01:41:12,614
And I will come back to you.

841
01:41:46,648 --> 01:41:48,275
To today's victory.

842
01:41:49,443 --> 01:41:51,528
Look, I'm always here for you, Francis.

843
01:41:52,487 --> 01:41:55,741
But I must admit, I'm overwhelmed
with the excitement of the battlefield.

844
01:41:56,283 --> 01:41:58,618
{\an8}I should not deceive you, Alexander.

845
01:41:58,619 --> 01:42:01,788
{\an8}This battle against him will be brutal
and terrifying.

846
01:42:27,439 --> 01:42:28,439
Come on!

847
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:30,400
Get in defensive position!

848
01:42:40,869 --> 01:42:42,663
<i>My good wife, Joséphine.</i>

849
01:42:43,455 --> 01:42:47,167
<i>My God, it's cold here.
I miss your warmth.</i>

850
01:42:48,585 --> 01:42:52,214
<i>On this day, we celebrate
the first anniversary of our coronation.</i>

851
01:42:54,049 --> 01:42:56,718
<i>My previous ally
has now joined with my enemy.</i>

852
01:42:57,845 --> 01:43:01,682
<i>The Russian Tsar Alexander
joined forces with the prince of Austria.</i>

853
01:43:02,766 --> 01:43:05,393
<i>I have heard that
he's been studying the art of war</i>

854
01:43:05,394 --> 01:43:07,228
<i>and trying to emulate my battle tactics.</i>

855
01:43:07,229 --> 01:43:08,229
More fires.

856
01:43:08,230 --> 01:43:09,731
<i>He tries to copy me,</i>

857
01:43:10,399 --> 01:43:13,151
<i>but he is a little boy
who will make a terrible mistake.</i>

858
01:43:14,319 --> 01:43:18,282
<i>I am certain I will bring the laurels of
another glorious victory to my army today.</i>

859
01:43:19,324 --> 01:43:21,493
<i>Yours, Napoleon.</i>

860
01:43:36,967 --> 01:43:39,802
Hey, tie it from the back.
Peg that corner to the ground.

861
01:43:39,803 --> 01:43:40,888
That's it.

862
01:44:21,261 --> 01:44:24,348
Harder. Like a horse.

863
01:44:31,146 --> 01:44:32,147
More.

864
01:44:51,333 --> 01:44:52,584
Fuck.

865
01:45:48,807 --> 01:45:50,100
Your Majesty.

866
01:45:51,059 --> 01:45:52,561
We are discovered.

867
01:45:54,146 --> 01:45:55,147
Good.

868
01:45:56,565 --> 01:45:57,733
Tell the men to rest.

869
01:46:28,180 --> 01:46:33,185
I-N-F-S.

870
01:46:35,020 --> 01:46:36,271
Infantry sighted.

871
01:46:50,410 --> 01:46:53,914
I-M-T.

872
01:46:56,458 --> 01:46:57,668
Imminent!

873
01:47:00,379 --> 01:47:02,421
Stand to!

874
01:47:02,422 --> 01:47:05,174
- Stand to!
- Stand to!

875
01:47:05,175 --> 01:47:06,926
- Stand to!
- Stand to.

876
01:47:06,927 --> 01:47:10,221
- Wake up, men. Get ready!
- Stand to!

877
01:47:10,222 --> 01:47:11,974
Come on, get up!

878
01:47:39,459 --> 01:47:40,669
Wait.

879
01:47:41,211 --> 01:47:42,211
Ready!

880
01:47:42,212 --> 01:47:45,883
Wait! Let them think
they have the higher ground.

881
01:48:31,929 --> 01:48:33,138
Fire!

882
01:48:36,433 --> 01:48:37,684
Fire away!

883
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:46,610
Fire at will!

884
01:48:53,116 --> 01:48:54,200
Send in the infantry.

885
01:48:54,201 --> 01:48:56,661
Take their position on the higher ground.
At the double.

886
01:48:56,662 --> 01:48:58,497
Take the ground!

887
01:49:31,488 --> 01:49:34,199
Cavalry from the west.
Pierce their flanks.

888
01:49:48,213 --> 01:49:51,299
Retreat! Withdraw!

889
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:52,885
Withdraw!

890
01:50:04,563 --> 01:50:06,023
It's a trap!

891
01:50:10,569 --> 01:50:12,237
Retreat!

892
01:50:50,526 --> 01:50:53,654
- Uncover the cannons.
- Cannons!

893
01:50:57,950 --> 01:51:00,202
- Fire!
- Fire!

894
01:51:04,081 --> 01:51:05,207
Reloading!

895
01:51:23,392 --> 01:51:25,102
Keep to the one side.

896
01:51:36,780 --> 01:51:38,490
Off the ice!

897
01:52:28,665 --> 01:52:31,376
Renounce, sir. We're pinned in.

898
01:52:33,962 --> 01:52:36,465
Off the ice! Withdraw!

899
01:52:43,347 --> 01:52:44,556
Cut off their retreat.

900
01:52:47,976 --> 01:52:49,853
Hyah, hyah, hyah!

901
01:52:55,567 --> 01:52:58,612
Hyah, hyah, hyah!

902
01:53:35,816 --> 01:53:38,610
Francis. So nice to finally meet you.

903
01:53:39,194 --> 01:53:40,779
Please come in where it's warm.

904
01:53:41,613 --> 01:53:44,031
- Thank you.
- You must forgive me.

905
01:53:44,032 --> 01:53:46,618
This has been my only palace
for the last two months.

906
01:53:47,828 --> 01:53:51,831
Seems very agreeable.
You make excellent use of it.

907
01:53:51,832 --> 01:53:53,876
Well, we do what we can
on the battlefield.

908
01:53:54,668 --> 01:53:56,545
Yes, we do, don't we?

909
01:53:57,045 --> 01:53:59,214
It's nice to finally meet another emperor.

910
01:54:00,507 --> 01:54:02,758
Where, may I ask, is Alexander?

911
01:54:02,759 --> 01:54:05,219
Are we waiting for his arrival
before we get started?

912
01:54:05,220 --> 01:54:09,015
I do not believe he will be joining us.

913
01:54:09,016 --> 01:54:11,602
He's beside himself with rage.

914
01:54:14,062 --> 01:54:18,275
I realize I must compliment you
for making me commit an enormous error.

915
01:54:19,359 --> 01:54:21,111
- An error?
- Yes.

916
01:54:22,237 --> 01:54:23,655
What error have you made?

917
01:54:25,657 --> 01:54:28,785
To be speaking with you here
and accepting this invitation for peace,

918
01:54:29,661 --> 01:54:31,371
I have not followed up my victory.

919
01:54:32,831 --> 01:54:36,084
I could have taken the whole Russian
and Austrian army prisoners.

920
01:54:39,004 --> 01:54:40,005
Yes.

921
01:54:40,714 --> 01:54:42,716
But after all, there will be less tears.

922
01:54:44,259 --> 01:54:48,597
And I know you will remember
this gesture of kindness. Yes?

923
01:54:50,015 --> 01:54:51,225
Thank you.

924
01:54:55,687 --> 01:54:56,688
Toast?

925
01:55:05,822 --> 01:55:12,287
To friendship, a glorious peace
and the best interest of Europe.

926
01:55:19,545 --> 01:55:20,504
Burgundy.

927
01:55:43,694 --> 01:55:45,821
Hold on. Hey, whoa!

928
01:55:46,697 --> 01:55:48,323
Whoa, we don't say woof. Okay.

929
01:55:50,784 --> 01:55:53,870
That's my boy. Attaboy.

930
01:55:53,871 --> 01:55:55,581
Come here. Sit.

931
01:56:11,180 --> 01:56:14,266
It is time to put this mystery to rest,
Emperor.

932
01:56:14,808 --> 01:56:17,603
I want to know if it's you or Joséphine.

933
01:56:18,187 --> 01:56:24,985
And to that end, we will conduct
a very practical experiment.

934
01:56:27,821 --> 01:56:30,991
At the end of the hallway... Take this...

935
01:56:31,867 --> 01:56:35,829
Waiting for you, undressed,
ready to receive,

936
01:56:36,788 --> 01:56:41,251
is 18-year-old
Eléonore Denuelle de La Plaigne.

937
01:56:44,421 --> 01:56:46,590
She's brunette with brown eyes.

938
01:56:47,174 --> 01:56:49,342
And the object of this, well,

939
01:56:49,343 --> 01:56:54,681
hardly unpleasant task is to see
if you can father a child.

940
01:56:56,058 --> 01:56:59,894
And then we will have an answer
to this nagging question

941
01:56:59,895 --> 01:57:05,025
of who is keeping who from an heir
to the throne of France.

942
01:57:10,531 --> 01:57:11,657
Shall we go?

943
01:57:12,282 --> 01:57:13,617
May I have another, please?

944
01:58:13,468 --> 01:58:15,094
The girl is pregnant.

945
01:58:15,095 --> 01:58:16,680
You made her pregnant.

946
01:58:30,444 --> 01:58:32,070
I know I didn't see her.

947
01:58:39,286 --> 01:58:41,455
When are you going to insist we divorce?

948
01:58:43,165 --> 01:58:44,958
Isn't that wonderful?

949
01:58:46,793 --> 01:58:50,838
From the only woman that I've ever loved
and given all that I've conquered.

950
01:58:50,839 --> 01:58:56,887
I'm just too tired to wait
for you to tell me what I know is coming.

951
01:58:59,306 --> 01:59:00,557
If you insist.

952
01:59:04,311 --> 01:59:06,021
I'll make it easy for you.

953
01:59:12,277 --> 01:59:14,988
I know you will have a bastard child.

954
01:59:20,202 --> 01:59:23,997
If I succeed in making the birth of a boy
that I shall call my own son,

955
01:59:24,915 --> 01:59:28,877
I want you as a witness
to pretend the confinement of the empress.

956
01:59:31,088 --> 01:59:32,296
Your Highness,

957
01:59:32,297 --> 01:59:35,843
you are asking me to lie about the status
of the mother of your heir.

958
01:59:37,553 --> 01:59:39,555
That is another way of putting it, yes.

959
01:59:41,807 --> 01:59:47,562
Emperor, it is my honor
and my duty, of course,

960
01:59:47,563 --> 01:59:49,564
to do as you require of me.

961
01:59:49,565 --> 01:59:53,527
But if asked, I cannot contain
that which I know to be the truth.

962
01:59:54,570 --> 01:59:56,571
And painful though it is,

963
01:59:56,572 --> 02:00:01,159
the truth is that the empress is
no longer capable of bearing you a child.

964
02:00:12,504 --> 02:00:14,590
My good Joséphine.

965
02:00:19,553 --> 02:00:21,180
You know how I've loved you.

966
02:00:24,141 --> 02:00:27,519
It is you, to you alone,

967
02:00:28,729 --> 02:00:32,316
that I owe the few moments
of happiness I have known in this world.

968
02:00:36,278 --> 02:00:40,032
My destiny is more powerful than my will.

969
02:00:42,117 --> 02:00:48,123
And my affections must yield
to the interests of my people.

970
02:01:08,769 --> 02:01:11,063
"Three million francs per year.

971
02:01:11,855 --> 02:01:13,982
Malmaison and its revenues.

972
02:01:14,691 --> 02:01:16,860
The Élysée Palace in Paris.

973
02:01:17,528 --> 02:01:19,195
The rank of empress.

974
02:01:19,196 --> 02:01:20,697
The title of "Majesty"

975
02:01:21,198 --> 02:01:23,741
and the right to use
the imperial coat of arms

976
02:01:23,742 --> 02:01:25,869
and to have your carriage drawn
by eight horses."

977
02:01:29,289 --> 02:01:32,375
"Your present debts of two million francs

978
02:01:32,376 --> 02:01:35,337
to be paid as an advance
against all future revenues."

979
02:01:40,300 --> 02:01:43,720
The imperial decree
for the dissolution of the marriage

980
02:01:44,888 --> 02:01:48,600
between the Emperor Napoleon
and the Empress Joséphine.

981
02:01:57,234 --> 02:02:02,531
"My people desire that this throne,
where providence has placed me,

982
02:02:03,073 --> 02:02:04,741
would be given to my children.

983
02:02:06,493 --> 02:02:10,663
However, I have lost hope
of having children from my marriage

984
02:02:10,664 --> 02:02:13,417
to my beloved wife, Empress Joséphine.

985
02:02:14,418 --> 02:02:18,504
I have then been led to listen
only to the good of the state

986
02:02:18,505 --> 02:02:22,009
and to want the dissolution
of years of my life."

987
02:02:29,057 --> 02:02:33,770
You have embellished my life for 15 years.

988
02:02:36,023 --> 02:02:41,445
The memories of which
will remain forever etched in my heart.

989
02:02:57,794 --> 02:03:01,590
"Our marriage has become an obstacle
for the prosperity of France.

990
02:03:04,301 --> 02:03:08,804
She has been deprived
of one day being governed

991
02:03:08,805 --> 02:03:12,725
by the descendants
of the man brought to us by providence

992
02:03:12,726 --> 02:03:15,270
to mend the evils of a terrible revolution

993
02:03:15,896 --> 02:03:19,274
and restore faith, the throne
and the social order."

994
02:03:25,239 --> 02:03:26,615
Sorry.

995
02:03:28,492 --> 02:03:31,077
- Emperor. Wait.
- Go. No, listen. All right?

996
02:03:31,078 --> 02:03:33,789
This is for your country.
That's what this is, all right?

997
02:03:34,414 --> 02:03:35,624
Now say it.

998
02:03:36,959 --> 02:03:38,168
Say it.

999
02:03:44,883 --> 02:03:47,928
"Our marriage has become an obstacle
for the prosperity of France.

1000
02:03:49,930 --> 02:03:52,474
Agreeing to the dissolution
of our marriage,

1001
02:03:53,100 --> 02:03:55,561
as I must, does not change my feelings.

1002
02:04:01,775 --> 02:04:08,115
The emperor will have in me
always his truest friend."

1003
02:04:42,232 --> 02:04:43,317
<i>Emperor,</i>

1004
02:04:44,151 --> 02:04:47,321
<i>you have just pronounced the word
which separates us forever.</i>

1005
02:04:49,156 --> 02:04:52,325
{\an8}<i>Your mistaken ambition has ever been</i>

1006
02:04:52,326 --> 02:04:56,622
{\an8}<i>and will continue to be the guide
of all your actions.</i>

1007
02:04:57,497 --> 02:04:58,707
<i>Nevertheless,</i>

1008
02:04:59,499 --> 02:05:02,961
<i>you can never doubt the sincerity
of my wishes for your happiness.</i>

1009
02:05:04,213 --> 02:05:07,799
<i>May it at least afford me
some consolation for my sufferings.</i>

1010
02:05:08,926 --> 02:05:11,470
- <i>Yours, Joséphine.</i>
- Thank you.

1011
02:05:12,137 --> 02:05:14,472
- Good morning, madame.
- Thank you. What's your name?

1012
02:05:14,473 --> 02:05:16,725
- Fleur.
- Fleur. Pleasure.

1013
02:06:19,288 --> 02:06:20,289
I miss you.

1014
02:06:25,752 --> 02:06:27,754
Marital life is very agreeable now.

1015
02:06:32,551 --> 02:06:35,137
You've shown such great courage so far.

1016
02:06:37,472 --> 02:06:38,974
You must maintain it.

1017
02:06:40,392 --> 02:06:43,312
Do not permit yourself
to fall into melancholy.

1018
02:06:48,859 --> 02:06:50,569
You look best when you're happy.

1019
02:06:55,407 --> 02:06:56,992
Please take care of your health.

1020
02:06:57,993 --> 02:06:59,369
It is precious to me.

1021
02:07:00,704 --> 02:07:02,039
Will you write me tomorrow?

1022
02:07:06,418 --> 02:07:07,544
And the next day?

1023
02:07:08,253 --> 02:07:09,254
Yes.

1024
02:07:10,339 --> 02:07:11,465
And the day after that?

1025
02:07:15,302 --> 02:07:17,137
- And the day after that?
- Yeah.

1026
02:07:20,557 --> 02:07:21,558
Good.

1027
02:07:31,818 --> 02:07:35,405
{\an8}Once, an English ambassador
challenged my reasons for war.

1028
02:07:36,281 --> 02:07:39,784
{\an8}He said,
"You French, you fight only for money,

1029
02:07:39,785 --> 02:07:42,037
while we English, we fight for honor."

1030
02:07:43,205 --> 02:07:46,875
I replied,
"Everyone fights for what they lack."

1031
02:07:50,254 --> 02:07:53,256
This is not your story.
This never happened to you, did it?

1032
02:07:53,257 --> 02:07:54,298
Of course it did.

1033
02:07:54,299 --> 02:07:55,758
- Of course it did.
- What do you mean?

1034
02:07:55,759 --> 02:07:57,927
We had the same saying
with my people and the Turks.

1035
02:07:57,928 --> 02:07:59,220
Do you?

1036
02:07:59,221 --> 02:08:01,389
The English lack honor.
We can agree on that.

1037
02:08:01,390 --> 02:08:02,724
Listen, there is...

1038
02:08:05,060 --> 02:08:09,982
There's nothing I think we can agree
more with than our hatred for Britain.

1039
02:08:13,318 --> 02:08:17,822
I just have to say that it actually...

1040
02:08:17,823 --> 02:08:21,410
It would be my absolute pleasure
and honor if I could call you my brother.

1041
02:08:25,205 --> 02:08:27,207
There is a way for you to call me brother.

1042
02:08:29,751 --> 02:08:32,838
Last night, at dinner, I was...

1043
02:08:34,882 --> 02:08:37,217
charmed by your sister.

1044
02:08:38,760 --> 02:08:39,761
Is she spoken for?

1045
02:08:40,971 --> 02:08:45,475
Sadly, yes. She's to be married
to the Duke of Oldenburg, I'm afraid.

1046
02:08:46,185 --> 02:08:49,145
And what of her younger sister? Anna?

1047
02:08:49,146 --> 02:08:51,565
Is there a formal offer for Anna?

1048
02:08:59,364 --> 02:09:02,159
Well, you see, Anna, she's 15 years old.

1049
02:09:03,368 --> 02:09:04,536
That is a detail.

1050
02:09:07,956 --> 02:09:12,544
Our friendship is built on
our mutual distrust of England.

1051
02:09:13,253 --> 02:09:17,632
When we hold to the Continental Blockade,
we choke them from the trade,

1052
02:09:17,633 --> 02:09:20,009
and we fight for our most sacred rights.

1053
02:09:20,010 --> 02:09:22,262
That is what is important between us.

1054
02:09:22,930 --> 02:09:23,931
I just had a thought.

1055
02:09:24,598 --> 02:09:25,890
- No.
- No, say it.

1056
02:09:25,891 --> 02:09:27,601
- Should I tell you?
- Please.

1057
02:09:28,852 --> 02:09:31,605
Imagine an army. 50,000 men.

1058
02:09:32,105 --> 02:09:35,358
Russians, Frenchmen,
perhaps even Austrians,

1059
02:09:35,359 --> 02:09:38,152
marching by way of Constantinople
into Asia

1060
02:09:38,153 --> 02:09:39,904
would have only to reach the Euphrates

1061
02:09:39,905 --> 02:09:42,448
to make England tremble
and bring her down on her knees

1062
02:09:42,449 --> 02:09:43,784
before the continent.

1063
02:09:47,454 --> 02:09:48,622
It is incredible.

1064
02:09:49,831 --> 02:09:50,832
Toast.

1065
02:09:57,673 --> 02:09:59,174
- To you.
- To us.

1066
02:10:00,384 --> 02:10:05,304
His Majesty, the Emperor Napoleon,
wishes to make a formal offer to Austria

1067
02:10:05,305 --> 02:10:07,599
and to His Majesty, King Francis,

1068
02:10:08,809 --> 02:10:12,104
for the hand
of the archduchess, Marie-Louise.

1069
02:10:13,772 --> 02:10:14,898
His eldest daughter.

1070
02:10:16,233 --> 02:10:17,442
No.

1071
02:10:18,735 --> 02:10:21,279
This union would bring together
Austria and France

1072
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:23,490
in an unbreakable matrimonial bond.

1073
02:10:25,284 --> 02:10:27,286
Is this a joke?

1074
02:10:29,663 --> 02:10:36,420
I may find it humorous...
but His Majesty does not.

1075
02:10:54,313 --> 02:10:55,980
Did you have a pleasant journey?

1076
02:10:55,981 --> 02:10:57,608
It was wonderful. Thank you.

1077
02:11:03,780 --> 02:11:05,199
You're quite petite.

1078
02:11:06,241 --> 02:11:07,451
I'm not accustomed to that.

1079
02:11:11,330 --> 02:11:12,623
How do I look to you?

1080
02:11:14,249 --> 02:11:16,001
Do I resemble my portrait?

1081
02:11:16,585 --> 02:11:20,923
Oh, yes.
And even more handsome and strong.

1082
02:11:22,216 --> 02:11:25,719
And you are even more handsome,
more beautiful.

1083
02:11:27,804 --> 02:11:30,182
I hope you're pleased with your choice.

1084
02:11:31,433 --> 02:11:34,603
I hope so too.
Would you like to see the bedroom?

1085
02:11:35,437 --> 02:11:36,980
Yes, thank you.

1086
02:11:49,451 --> 02:11:51,578
Your Majesty, your son.

1087
02:12:11,056 --> 02:12:12,391
Hello.

1088
02:12:16,395 --> 02:12:17,938
Fire!

1089
02:12:25,946 --> 02:12:27,155
My little king.

1090
02:12:32,160 --> 02:12:34,663
Hyah!

1091
02:12:40,502 --> 02:12:41,628
Hold.

1092
02:13:39,978 --> 02:13:41,730
Oh, sweet child.

1093
02:13:52,282 --> 02:13:57,955
One day, you will understand
what I have sacrificed for you.

1094
02:14:07,422 --> 02:14:11,467
What's good for Napoleon

1095
02:14:11,468 --> 02:14:13,345
is not good for Russia.

1096
02:14:14,346 --> 02:14:17,057
And if it is not good for Russia,

1097
02:14:18,225 --> 02:14:22,271
it cannot be good for His Majesty.

1098
02:14:24,273 --> 02:14:29,486
It is the timber trade with Britain
that makes Russia great.

1099
02:14:30,821 --> 02:14:35,492
Your father made a serious error.

1100
02:14:35,993 --> 02:14:38,579
He put himself above Russia.

1101
02:14:42,416 --> 02:14:48,046
I do not want to see Your Majesty

1102
02:14:48,755 --> 02:14:53,093
become unpopular with the Russian people.

1103
02:14:56,597 --> 02:14:58,557
I am not my father.

1104
02:15:01,101 --> 02:15:07,024
Do not make that regrettable mistake
of thinking that I am... again.

1105
02:15:08,025 --> 02:15:13,739
Russia will re-align itself with
the English. I am not afraid of Napoleon.

1106
02:15:15,699 --> 02:15:18,577
<i>My dear Joséphine, I'm sad today.</i>

1107
02:15:19,119 --> 02:15:22,956
<i>Tsar Alexander has turned against me
and forced me to invade Russia.</i>

1108
02:15:23,916 --> 02:15:26,335
{\an8}<i>He's decided to open his ports to England</i>

1109
02:15:26,919 --> 02:15:28,754
{\an8}<i>while taxing the French.</i>

1110
02:15:30,088 --> 02:15:33,634
{\an8}<i>I must wipe away my melancholy
and begin the march to Moscow.</i>

1111
02:15:34,927 --> 02:15:37,803
{\an8}<i>I've convinced the heads of Europe
of this resolution,</i>

1112
02:15:37,804 --> 02:15:42,391
<i>and so I command the combined forces
of France, Austria, Italy,</i>

1113
02:15:42,392 --> 02:15:44,186
<i>Germany and Poland.</i>

1114
02:15:44,770 --> 02:15:47,438
<i>I see nothing but success in my future.</i>

1115
02:15:47,439 --> 02:15:50,400
Keep your lines. Steady.

1116
02:15:52,736 --> 02:15:54,403
To the front.

1117
02:15:54,404 --> 02:15:56,406
Keep your step.

1118
02:16:02,120 --> 02:16:03,746
Take cover!

1119
02:16:03,747 --> 02:16:04,831
Get down!

1120
02:16:11,296 --> 02:16:13,090
Get down!

1121
02:16:22,933 --> 02:16:26,269
Hyah!

1122
02:16:26,270 --> 02:16:28,397
After them!

1123
02:16:46,748 --> 02:16:48,000
Whoa.

1124
02:16:51,712 --> 02:16:52,713
Whoa.

1125
02:17:09,605 --> 02:17:13,275
- Get back! Drop back. Retreat.
- Fall back!

1126
02:18:20,675 --> 02:18:22,593
{\an8}<i>My dear Joséphine.</i>

1127
02:18:24,179 --> 02:18:27,432
<i>I'm writing to you because I have just won
a great battle today.</i>

1128
02:18:29,058 --> 02:18:31,352
<i>Tomorrow we will resume our advance.</i>

1129
02:18:32,062 --> 02:18:34,438
<i>Moscow is now only 200 miles away.</i>

1130
02:18:34,439 --> 02:18:37,985
<i>And I think of you all the while.
All yours.</i>

1131
02:19:17,733 --> 02:19:18,901
Spread out.

1132
02:19:19,567 --> 02:19:21,068
Search the buildings.

1133
02:19:24,573 --> 02:19:25,574
Search everywhere.

1134
02:19:27,659 --> 02:19:29,494
Nearly there.

1135
02:19:36,752 --> 02:19:37,794
Thank you, sir.

1136
02:19:45,010 --> 02:19:47,930
- Thank you, Admiral.
- You were the brave of Austerlitz.

1137
02:20:52,953 --> 02:20:54,496
Where are you?

1138
02:21:07,593 --> 02:21:09,887
300,000 souls lived in this city.

1139
02:21:11,763 --> 02:21:13,140
And they've all just left?

1140
02:21:32,326 --> 02:21:35,244
Little boy.

1141
02:21:35,245 --> 02:21:38,707
Pspspsps.

1142
02:21:40,459 --> 02:21:42,002
Where are you?

1143
02:21:46,465 --> 02:21:48,091
Don't be frightened.

1144
02:21:48,926 --> 02:21:51,136
I'm just gonna give you a little spanking.

1145
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:23,502
It's not very sporting, is it?

1146
02:22:25,379 --> 02:22:27,256
For his honor and Russia's, not mine.

1147
02:22:32,678 --> 02:22:34,638
There's dignity to be had in defeat.

1148
02:23:18,307 --> 02:23:19,308
Who did this?

1149
02:23:20,726 --> 02:23:21,727
They did.

1150
02:23:23,228 --> 02:23:26,440
No, they did not. Be sensible.

1151
02:23:29,359 --> 02:23:31,069
Who set these fires?

1152
02:23:32,571 --> 02:23:35,991
Your Majesty, they did.

1153
02:23:41,622 --> 02:23:44,583
He'd rather burn his own city
than negotiate with me.

1154
02:23:45,375 --> 02:23:47,419
I didn't think he had the courage.

1155
02:23:52,883 --> 02:23:58,430
Well, we'll go to Saint Petersburg
and have him burn that too.

1156
02:24:00,307 --> 02:24:03,852
We have let too much time slip away.

1157
02:24:05,562 --> 02:24:08,941
We would be marching
into the Russian winter

1158
02:24:09,900 --> 02:24:13,946
with horses that are not raised
for this weather.

1159
02:24:15,489 --> 02:24:18,742
If we go back to Poland,
we can wait out the winter months.

1160
02:24:34,258 --> 02:24:37,761
<i>Napoleon, your letters are a soothing balm
to my heart.</i>

1161
02:24:38,679 --> 02:24:39,972
<i>I fear for you.</i>

1162
02:24:40,722 --> 02:24:44,434
<i>Remember that I alone know your health,
your fears.</i>

1163
02:24:45,227 --> 02:24:48,772
<i>I thank you as tenderly
as I will always love you.</i>

1164
02:24:49,314 --> 02:24:50,357
<i>Joséphine.</i>

1165
02:25:09,543 --> 02:25:13,213
The horseman's disease,
Your Majesty. Piles.

1166
02:25:19,553 --> 02:25:20,845
Make it better.

1167
02:25:20,846 --> 02:25:22,347
As you wish, Your Majesty.

1168
02:25:37,696 --> 02:25:39,281
<i>My friend, Joséphine.</i>

1169
02:25:40,449 --> 02:25:41,617
<i>"Friend."</i>

1170
02:25:42,701 --> 02:25:44,870
<i>It is strange to write that word to you.</i>

1171
02:25:46,121 --> 02:25:48,123
<i>You have always been so much more.</i>

1172
02:25:56,215 --> 02:26:01,011
<i>Despite careful organization,
there have been breakdowns in supply.</i>

1173
02:26:02,596 --> 02:26:07,392
<i>We're suffering sickness,
desertion and famine.</i>

1174
02:26:09,436 --> 02:26:10,562
We are winning.

1175
02:26:22,783 --> 02:26:26,119
- Us or Cossacks?
- Us.

1176
02:26:29,331 --> 02:26:33,961
<i>Joséphine. Fortune has abandoned me.</i>

1177
02:26:35,170 --> 02:26:37,464
{\an8}<i>I know that it is what fate has for me.</i>

1178
02:26:38,549 --> 02:26:40,717
{\an8}<i>Your words rattle in my head.</i>

1179
02:26:42,386 --> 02:26:44,388
<i>I am nothing without you.</i>

1180
02:26:44,930 --> 02:26:46,515
<i>I have no confidence.</i>

1181
02:26:47,933 --> 02:26:49,560
<i>I'm scared and I'm alone.</i>

1182
02:26:50,853 --> 02:26:53,188
<i>My men do not look at me like you do.</i>

1183
02:26:57,150 --> 02:27:01,488
<i>I know I will return home to the judgment
of these European kings.</i>

1184
02:27:02,489 --> 02:27:05,242
<i>And they will not judge me
as they judge themselves.</i>

1185
02:27:06,076 --> 02:27:07,451
<i>They will punish me</i>

1186
02:27:07,452 --> 02:27:10,247
<i>by a standard they would
never apply to each other.</i>

1187
02:27:11,498 --> 02:27:14,542
<i>I wish you could put me on your knee
and take care of me.</i>

1188
02:27:14,543 --> 02:27:17,253
Get the horses covered and under shelter.

1189
02:27:17,254 --> 02:27:19,506
This way, Your Majesty. Over here.

1190
02:27:31,435 --> 02:27:33,687
Into the barn, quickly!

1191
02:27:36,273 --> 02:27:37,356
Everyone, in!

1192
02:27:37,357 --> 02:27:40,610
- Let us in!
- We're gonna freeze out here. Let us in!

1193
02:27:40,611 --> 02:27:43,405
- Block the doors!
- You have to find somewhere else.

1194
02:27:43,989 --> 02:27:45,740
Open up the doors!

1195
02:27:45,741 --> 02:27:47,242
We're gonna freeze to death.

1196
02:27:47,743 --> 02:27:49,953
Open the doors!

1197
02:27:52,289 --> 02:27:53,624
Out of my way!

1198
02:27:56,585 --> 02:27:58,670
We're gonna die out here!

1199
02:28:10,098 --> 02:28:11,683
Majesty?

1200
02:28:14,645 --> 02:28:15,771
Yeah?

1201
02:28:16,563 --> 02:28:18,690
It's time for you
to leave this misery behind

1202
02:28:20,150 --> 02:28:21,652
and return to Paris.

1203
02:28:22,903 --> 02:28:24,196
I've found a way.

1204
02:28:25,781 --> 02:28:27,574
There's a sleigh behind this building.

1205
02:28:30,452 --> 02:28:33,080
With two horses,
we can make Warsaw in a week.

1206
02:28:36,166 --> 02:28:37,459
Paris soon after.

1207
02:28:41,505 --> 02:28:43,882
It's our only way
to get you back alive, Majesty.

1208
02:28:48,971 --> 02:28:50,180
Please.

1209
02:29:12,995 --> 02:29:16,373
- Fire! Fire!
- Fire!

1210
02:29:17,791 --> 02:29:18,792
It's spreading!

1211
02:29:21,336 --> 02:29:23,629
Hey, wake up! Get up!

1212
02:29:23,630 --> 02:29:25,716
- Fire!
- Fire!

1213
02:29:40,564 --> 02:29:43,567
- Put it out!
- Fire!

1214
02:30:13,096 --> 02:30:15,057
This is a triumphant return.

1215
02:30:17,100 --> 02:30:18,268
I am the victor.

1216
02:30:20,270 --> 02:30:22,356
Alexander abandoned his city.

1217
02:30:23,857 --> 02:30:28,237
And though he lacks honor
and failed to sign a peace treaty,

1218
02:30:29,655 --> 02:30:32,324
my presence back home
will be proof to my people

1219
02:30:32,824 --> 02:30:34,826
they have no one to fear in the world.

1220
02:30:36,787 --> 02:30:38,747
They fear you, Majesty.

1221
02:30:39,540 --> 02:30:41,291
They fear no one but you.

1222
02:30:48,799 --> 02:30:50,968
Do you think I'm this terrible...

1223
02:30:52,803 --> 02:30:55,472
terrible person with a bad temper?

1224
02:30:56,890 --> 02:30:58,934
- No.
- Of course you don't.

1225
02:31:02,062 --> 02:31:04,857
You're not an idiot. Or maybe you are.

1226
02:31:05,440 --> 02:31:06,900
I hope you get eaten by Cossacks.

1227
02:31:19,872 --> 02:31:20,955
Stop!

1228
02:31:20,956 --> 02:31:22,416
Whoa.

1229
02:31:40,976 --> 02:31:42,102
Where are we?

1230
02:31:42,603 --> 02:31:44,229
Borodino, Majesty.

1231
02:31:50,527 --> 02:31:53,154
<i>I hear the muskrats are agitated in Paris</i>

1232
02:31:53,155 --> 02:31:55,490
<i>at the idea of the emperor's return.</i>

1233
02:31:57,826 --> 02:32:01,455
<i>The coward, Tsar Alexander,
now knows what I'm capable of.</i>

1234
02:32:01,955 --> 02:32:05,209
<i>Who else can move half a million men
everywhere in Europe?</i>

1235
02:32:06,126 --> 02:32:10,046
<i>Now a farmer boy knows that
he can become a marshal of the empire.</i>

1236
02:32:10,047 --> 02:32:12,382
<i>A minister. A cardinal.</i>

1237
02:32:18,388 --> 02:32:21,642
<i>When I move, the world moves forward.</i>

1238
02:32:30,943 --> 02:32:34,862
<i>Of the 600,000 men you sent to Russia,</i>

1239
02:32:34,863 --> 02:32:37,823
<i>only 40,000 have returned.</i>

1240
02:32:37,824 --> 02:32:43,539
<i>Therefore, you have been exiled
in no uncertain terms.</i>

1241
02:32:45,332 --> 02:32:50,295
The allied coalition of Austria, Prussia,
Russia and England,

1242
02:32:52,089 --> 02:32:54,383
and with the agreement
of the French Council,

1243
02:32:55,592 --> 02:32:59,346
grant you sovereignty
of the island of Elba.

1244
02:33:01,098 --> 02:33:04,184
A revenue of two million francs
from the French funds,

1245
02:33:05,185 --> 02:33:08,605
pensions for the Bonaparte family
and the Empress Marie-Louise.

1246
02:33:09,773 --> 02:33:14,987
It also provides for Empress Joséphine
to retain all of her properties

1247
02:33:16,488 --> 02:33:20,325
and an allotted annual income
of one million francs.

1248
02:33:49,438 --> 02:33:51,023
I love France too much.

1249
02:33:56,278 --> 02:33:58,530
All I've desired was its glory.

1250
02:34:01,325 --> 02:34:03,285
I would never bring her misfortune.

1251
02:34:05,787 --> 02:34:07,372
They want me to abdicate.

1252
02:34:09,082 --> 02:34:10,626
Fine, I'll abdicate.

1253
02:35:00,717 --> 02:35:01,760
Good.

1254
02:35:07,349 --> 02:35:08,642
Wine.

1255
02:36:07,576 --> 02:36:08,577
Your Highness.

1256
02:36:10,329 --> 02:36:11,330
Empress.

1257
02:36:26,386 --> 02:36:27,387
Here.

1258
02:36:32,267 --> 02:36:34,061
Joséphine, Joséphine.

1259
02:36:36,146 --> 02:36:37,314
I am charmed.

1260
02:36:39,233 --> 02:36:40,317
But...

1261
02:36:44,780 --> 02:36:49,034
you do not have to lock yourself away
just because he's not here.

1262
02:36:50,786 --> 02:36:53,163
I know what it is like
to be underestimated.

1263
02:36:54,790 --> 02:37:00,796
But your eyes, your charm and your spirit,

1264
02:37:02,005 --> 02:37:03,215
it is in there.

1265
02:37:04,049 --> 02:37:07,594
It is yours, and you can use it.

1266
02:37:38,292 --> 02:37:39,585
Boy, what day is it?

1267
02:37:41,128 --> 02:37:42,128
Tuesday.

1268
02:37:42,129 --> 02:37:43,213
The 11th?

1269
02:37:43,964 --> 02:37:45,089
Yes.

1270
02:37:45,090 --> 02:37:47,509
Boy, do you know who Tsar Alexander is?

1271
02:37:50,095 --> 02:37:51,013
No.

1272
02:37:51,014 --> 02:37:52,639
But you knew who I was?

1273
02:37:55,851 --> 02:37:56,852
Yes.

1274
02:38:10,199 --> 02:38:11,200
There we are.

1275
02:38:17,164 --> 02:38:19,916
You know, it brings me no great joy

1276
02:38:19,917 --> 02:38:23,170
to sit with my son
and have him gloomy and sullen.

1277
02:38:37,100 --> 02:38:40,312
You were not meant to die
on this island, my son.

1278
02:38:45,234 --> 02:38:47,778
My wife is entertaining
the Russian Emperor...

1279
02:38:50,781 --> 02:38:51,740
in my home.

1280
02:39:16,849 --> 02:39:18,183
<i>Dear Joséphine,</i>

1281
02:39:18,934 --> 02:39:22,020
<i>You are mine. You will always be.</i>

1282
02:39:23,564 --> 02:39:25,440
<i>I cannot stand it any longer.</i>

1283
02:39:26,191 --> 02:39:28,443
<i>It has been 300 days on this rock,</i>

1284
02:39:29,111 --> 02:39:32,489
<i>and I'm ready to come home
and reclaim what's mine:</i>

1285
02:39:33,115 --> 02:39:34,908
<i>you and France.</i>

1286
02:39:53,093 --> 02:39:54,844
<i>I'm taking your ship.</i>

1287
02:39:54,845 --> 02:39:57,806
If you do not provoke me,
you do not have to fear me.

1288
02:40:16,867 --> 02:40:18,076
<i>Napoleon,</i>

1289
02:40:19,036 --> 02:40:23,248
<i>I'm a flower that opens its petals
and smiles to the sunshine,</i>

1290
02:40:24,374 --> 02:40:27,877
<i>unconscious that the storm is near
which will lay me low</i>

1291
02:40:27,878 --> 02:40:31,047
<i>and scatter leaves to the heavens.</i>

1292
02:40:31,048 --> 02:40:33,133
<i>Come quickly, my friend.</i>

1293
02:41:02,663 --> 02:41:05,123
If you would open your mouth, please.

1294
02:41:10,379 --> 02:41:11,380
Thank you.

1295
02:41:16,301 --> 02:41:17,511
Thank you.

1296
02:41:18,303 --> 02:41:21,640
Well, your chest is congested.
Your throat is aflame.

1297
02:41:22,808 --> 02:41:24,643
My suggestion is to stay in bed.

1298
02:41:27,104 --> 02:41:28,438
But Napoleon is coming.

1299
02:41:28,981 --> 02:41:31,732
It would be unwise
to receive any visitors.

1300
02:41:31,733 --> 02:41:33,442
But Napoleon is coming.

1301
02:41:33,443 --> 02:41:34,611
I understand.

1302
02:41:54,173 --> 02:41:56,133
Just keep her comfortable.

1303
02:42:15,944 --> 02:42:16,987
Whoa!

1304
02:42:24,036 --> 02:42:25,120
Your Majesty.

1305
02:42:29,958 --> 02:42:31,250
You may speak.

1306
02:42:31,251 --> 02:42:34,504
Bonaparte, Your Majesty. He has returned.

1307
02:42:34,505 --> 02:42:36,547
A ship landed on a beach
in Antibes this morning,

1308
02:42:36,548 --> 02:42:37,590
and they're on the march.

1309
02:42:37,591 --> 02:42:40,719
Napoleon Bonaparte is marching
towards Paris.

1310
02:42:44,097 --> 02:42:45,389
More.

1311
02:42:45,390 --> 02:42:46,475
Your Majesty.

1312
02:43:19,883 --> 02:43:20,759
Afternoon, Colonel.

1313
02:43:21,802 --> 02:43:23,011
Your Majesty.

1314
02:43:23,595 --> 02:43:24,679
General Marchand,

1315
02:43:24,680 --> 02:43:27,349
in defense of the royal government
of King Louis XVIII,

1316
02:43:28,141 --> 02:43:31,186
requests that you surrender your weapons
and cease your march

1317
02:43:31,895 --> 02:43:34,565
so that you may be arrested
and returned to your island.

1318
02:43:35,607 --> 02:43:39,486
Will you please inform the general that
I shall like to come and speak with him?

1319
02:43:41,196 --> 02:43:43,198
I have no fight with my own Fifth Army.

1320
02:43:44,992 --> 02:43:45,993
Sir.

1321
02:43:55,043 --> 02:43:56,503
He wishes to speak.

1322
02:43:58,005 --> 02:43:59,006
Make ready!

1323
02:44:02,759 --> 02:44:03,969
Present.

1324
02:44:14,980 --> 02:44:19,943
Soldiers of the Fifth Regiment,
do you recognize me?

1325
02:44:23,739 --> 02:44:25,866
Do you recognize me, soldiers?

1326
02:44:27,784 --> 02:44:29,369
Yes, Emperor!

1327
02:44:35,584 --> 02:44:36,793
I miss you.

1328
02:44:39,546 --> 02:44:41,548
I'm melancholy for my home...

1329
02:44:43,842 --> 02:44:46,011
and for our victories together.

1330
02:44:49,223 --> 02:44:50,724
I want to come home.

1331
02:44:52,184 --> 02:44:53,477
Will you join me?

1332
02:44:55,229 --> 02:44:56,979
Long live the emperor!

1333
02:44:56,980 --> 02:45:04,488
- Long live the emperor!
- Long live the emperor!

1334
02:45:44,403 --> 02:45:45,529
Your Majesty.

1335
02:45:49,533 --> 02:45:51,118
Thank you.

1336
02:46:19,563 --> 02:46:24,484
On May 26th, Dr. Corvisart was called

1337
02:46:25,777 --> 02:46:30,949
and found her chest congested
and her throat inflamed.

1338
02:46:33,327 --> 02:46:35,829
Her illness was diphtheria.

1339
02:46:38,916 --> 02:46:44,796
On May 29th, last sacrament was given,
and she died.

1340
02:46:49,426 --> 02:46:51,303
And no one thought to notify me?

1341
02:47:01,605 --> 02:47:02,606
Hortense.

1342
02:47:05,526 --> 02:47:07,152
Do you blame...

1343
02:47:08,362 --> 02:47:09,571
Do you blame me?

1344
02:47:12,282 --> 02:47:13,407
I don't blame you.

1345
02:47:13,408 --> 02:47:14,493
Of course not.

1346
02:47:17,371 --> 02:47:20,541
I'm not to bear the burden
of responsibility

1347
02:47:22,334 --> 02:47:24,253
for the misfortunes of your mother.

1348
02:47:25,379 --> 02:47:27,463
I want the letters that I wrote to her.

1349
02:47:27,464 --> 02:47:31,593
I'm sorry, I don't have them.
They were stolen by her valet.

1350
02:47:34,388 --> 02:47:35,597
Where did she keep them?

1351
02:47:37,975 --> 02:47:40,477
In the cupboard in her bedroom,
next to her bed.

1352
02:47:44,106 --> 02:47:45,524
What did he do with them?

1353
02:47:47,943 --> 02:47:49,528
Her valet sold them.

1354
02:47:56,952 --> 02:47:58,412
I'm sorry.

1355
02:48:00,873 --> 02:48:01,874
I forgive you.

1356
02:48:44,082 --> 02:48:47,210
{\an8}Napoleon Bonaparte has destroyed

1357
02:48:47,211 --> 02:48:51,173
{\an8}the only title
upon which his very existence depended.

1358
02:48:52,591 --> 02:48:55,009
{\an8}This congregation of allies

1359
02:48:55,010 --> 02:48:59,472
{\an8}shall form along the borders of France
and Belgium an army.

1360
02:48:59,473 --> 02:49:02,226
70,000 troops from England,

1361
02:49:03,560 --> 02:49:06,146
120,000 troops from Prussia.

1362
02:49:08,232 --> 02:49:12,194
This vermin has routed
the farmyards of Europe

1363
02:49:13,070 --> 02:49:15,239
while the farmers snored.

1364
02:49:15,822 --> 02:49:18,033
We should have struck this blow long ago.

1365
02:49:19,117 --> 02:49:23,454
He has held the world hostage
with his egotism,

1366
02:49:23,455 --> 02:49:26,749
his insatiable hunger for power,

1367
02:49:26,750 --> 02:49:30,254
and his lack of simple good manners.

1368
02:49:31,213 --> 02:49:33,674
We will all sleep again without him.

1369
02:49:34,842 --> 02:49:39,972
I believe I speak for all of us when I say
that the only regret we all share

1370
02:49:40,681 --> 02:49:44,101
is that we allowed this vermin
to live at all.

1371
02:49:45,269 --> 02:49:48,897
250,000 men with the traitor.

1372
02:49:50,107 --> 02:49:56,070
25,000 men, 125,000 men

1373
02:49:56,071 --> 02:49:58,824
and 100,000 men...

1374
02:50:02,327 --> 02:50:05,664
against our 125,000 men.

1375
02:50:08,125 --> 02:50:09,710
This is a fight on land.

1376
02:50:11,378 --> 02:50:14,381
This is what Britain does not know
how to do that I know.

1377
02:50:16,675 --> 02:50:20,762
Strike quickly
against Wellington and Blücher.

1378
02:50:21,555 --> 02:50:23,140
Defeat them separately.

1379
02:50:24,183 --> 02:50:27,853
Disallow them from uniting forces here.

1380
02:51:11,021 --> 02:51:13,565
Morning.

1381
02:51:14,399 --> 02:51:15,859
The Prussians are advancing.

1382
02:51:16,944 --> 02:51:18,445
We should begin the offensive.

1383
02:51:19,154 --> 02:51:21,240
We must wait for the ground to dry.

1384
02:51:23,742 --> 02:51:27,037
Blücher will never make it in time.
I'll have Wellington by lunch.

1385
02:51:49,852 --> 02:51:52,646
I never get wet if I can help it.

1386
02:52:58,754 --> 02:53:00,130
What shall I tell the men?

1387
02:53:02,174 --> 02:53:03,884
Tell them to make the rain stop.

1388
02:53:06,887 --> 02:53:11,225
- Coming through!
- In formation!

1389
02:53:12,684 --> 02:53:15,354
Now's your time, lads. Now's your time.

1390
02:53:16,688 --> 02:53:18,315
Now, listen very carefully.

1391
02:53:19,775 --> 02:53:24,696
Patience is the order of the day today.
Patience shall win the day.

1392
02:53:25,447 --> 02:53:27,699
We must hold this ground.

1393
02:53:28,408 --> 02:53:30,201
Let them come to us.

1394
02:53:30,202 --> 02:53:32,120
Huzzah!

1395
02:53:37,459 --> 02:53:38,710
Go on, boys. Go on.

1396
02:53:40,879 --> 02:53:41,880
Whoa.

1397
02:53:42,673 --> 02:53:43,881
Good morning, General Blücher.

1398
02:53:43,882 --> 02:53:46,592
- Good morning.
- Estimated time of arrival, sir?

1399
02:53:46,593 --> 02:53:49,011
- Officer?
- About five hours.

1400
02:53:49,012 --> 02:53:50,681
About five hours.

1401
02:54:07,239 --> 02:54:08,615
Come on, boys.

1402
02:54:21,170 --> 02:54:22,462
There he is.

1403
02:54:23,380 --> 02:54:29,052
He appears to be just sleeping.

1404
02:54:30,512 --> 02:54:35,934
One thing you cannot resist, my friend,
is a frontal attack.

1405
02:54:38,854 --> 02:54:41,857
Let's see how this general
can attack our position.

1406
02:54:44,860 --> 02:54:49,697
Sir. I have the emperor in my sights.
Do I have permission to fire?

1407
02:54:49,698 --> 02:54:50,908
Certainly not.

1408
02:54:51,408 --> 02:54:53,701
Generals commanding armies
have better things to do with their time

1409
02:54:53,702 --> 02:54:54,827
than to shoot at one another.

1410
02:54:54,828 --> 02:54:57,371
Hold your fire, rifleman,
on pain of death.

1411
02:54:57,372 --> 02:54:59,248
Go on, boys. Come.

1412
02:54:59,249 --> 02:55:01,126
A runner coming through!

1413
02:55:02,628 --> 02:55:04,296
Blücher, 11 to 12 miles, sir.

1414
02:55:05,130 --> 02:55:06,965
Attention, follow me.

1415
02:55:07,466 --> 02:55:10,009
- Blücher at 11 to 12 miles, sir.
- Jesus Christ.

1416
02:55:10,010 --> 02:55:12,179
- I want a report every hour.
- Yes, sir.

1417
02:55:14,973 --> 02:55:18,644
Runner coming through. Make way.

1418
02:55:23,232 --> 02:55:26,151
Prussians on the roadside, 12 miles.

1419
02:55:32,407 --> 02:55:36,286
Prussian troops have been sighted
on the road, sire. Twelve miles.

1420
02:55:39,915 --> 02:55:41,124
Ready the cannons.

1421
02:55:44,753 --> 02:55:46,421
Ready the cannons!

1422
02:55:49,591 --> 02:55:51,635
Go on! Move!

1423
02:56:01,061 --> 02:56:03,646
Ready! Cannons are ready!

1424
02:56:03,647 --> 02:56:05,606
Cannons are ready!

1425
02:56:05,607 --> 02:56:07,401
The rain has stopped, sir.

1426
02:56:16,326 --> 02:56:18,036
Prepare to fire!

1427
02:56:27,671 --> 02:56:30,257
- Fire!
- Fire!

1428
02:56:36,263 --> 02:56:37,806
Take cover!

1429
02:56:40,601 --> 02:56:42,935
Straight into position. Steady.

1430
02:56:42,936 --> 02:56:47,107
Prepare for the advance. Get ready.

1431
02:56:48,442 --> 02:56:49,901
Prepare for the advance.

1432
02:56:49,902 --> 02:56:52,069
Readjust to 195!

1433
02:56:52,070 --> 02:56:54,197
Adjust 195!

1434
02:56:54,198 --> 02:56:56,950
Elevation 195.

1435
02:56:59,995 --> 02:57:01,121
Adjusted!

1436
02:57:03,081 --> 02:57:05,958
Prepare to fire! Fire!

1437
02:57:05,959 --> 02:57:07,586
Fire!

1438
02:57:12,674 --> 02:57:15,802
Keep your head down. Seventh, take over.

1439
02:57:24,686 --> 02:57:27,564
- Out the way!
- Hold fast, men!

1440
02:57:31,610 --> 02:57:35,113
Infantry, advance!

1441
02:57:35,948 --> 02:57:37,574
Left company!

1442
02:57:39,826 --> 02:57:41,494
And march!

1443
02:57:41,495 --> 02:57:43,664
Get in formation. Now!

1444
02:57:45,666 --> 02:57:46,792
Keep them away!

1445
02:57:48,043 --> 02:57:49,044
Join!

1446
02:57:58,428 --> 02:58:02,516
Second wave, advance! Over the top, men!

1447
02:58:03,517 --> 02:58:04,934
Hold the line!

1448
02:58:04,935 --> 02:58:06,979
Cannons!

1449
02:58:07,688 --> 02:58:09,481
Fire!

1450
02:58:12,901 --> 02:58:14,444
Get ready.

1451
02:58:15,529 --> 02:58:16,780
Hold fast.

1452
02:58:17,573 --> 02:58:18,991
Fire!

1453
02:58:28,333 --> 02:58:30,460
You there, get on that cannon.

1454
02:58:40,596 --> 02:58:41,638
Fire!

1455
02:58:48,520 --> 02:58:50,314
Fill the gap!

1456
02:58:52,149 --> 02:58:53,567
Keep the line!

1457
02:59:01,074 --> 02:59:03,701
Skirmishers, keep advancing!

1458
02:59:03,702 --> 02:59:05,119
Get in formation.

1459
02:59:05,120 --> 02:59:06,955
Fire at will.

1460
02:59:12,252 --> 02:59:14,588
Keep them back, men. Fire.

1461
02:59:17,758 --> 02:59:20,928
Go on. Don't let them rally!

1462
02:59:26,683 --> 02:59:27,892
...the strike position.

1463
02:59:27,893 --> 02:59:30,437
Get up, boys. Go on. Go on, boys.

1464
02:59:32,022 --> 02:59:33,357
Whoa.

1465
02:59:35,901 --> 02:59:38,820
Prussians, roadside, five miles.

1466
02:59:40,531 --> 02:59:42,157
Five miles, maybe less.

1467
02:59:44,159 --> 02:59:45,827
We have to act before Blücher arrives.

1468
02:59:46,495 --> 02:59:47,496
Out.

1469
02:59:50,332 --> 02:59:51,333
Out!

1470
03:00:03,512 --> 03:00:05,013
Cavalry!

1471
03:00:06,306 --> 03:00:08,100
Charge!

1472
03:00:15,107 --> 03:00:19,152
Prepare to receive cavalry.

1473
03:00:27,828 --> 03:00:32,206
We must hold our ground.
Stand fast to the last man.

1474
03:00:32,207 --> 03:00:34,543
We must not be beat!

1475
03:00:35,335 --> 03:00:37,587
Or what will they say in England?

1476
03:00:37,588 --> 03:00:40,841
- Hold the line.
- Keep it tight.

1477
03:00:45,179 --> 03:00:48,682
Steady, men. Stay in formation.

1478
03:00:52,102 --> 03:00:54,479
Long live the emperor!

1479
03:00:56,815 --> 03:00:58,734
Company, halt!

1480
03:00:59,401 --> 03:01:02,779
Form square!

1481
03:01:18,420 --> 03:01:21,006
Long live the emperor!

1482
03:01:24,092 --> 03:01:27,763
One section, fire. Two section, fire.

1483
03:01:44,154 --> 03:01:47,073
What do we do, sir?
We can't break through.

1484
03:01:47,074 --> 03:01:49,618
Keep them running.
Get them back in the square.

1485
03:01:52,329 --> 03:01:53,914
Show them your British steel.

1486
03:02:05,592 --> 03:02:07,553
Present arms!

1487
03:02:11,265 --> 03:02:12,599
Shoulder, hold!

1488
03:02:17,187 --> 03:02:18,939
They're here, the Prussians.

1489
03:02:22,317 --> 03:02:23,694
First over the rise, Emperor.

1490
03:02:49,720 --> 03:02:51,805
We need to find a way through!

1491
03:02:54,641 --> 03:02:56,643
Break the square!

1492
03:03:07,279 --> 03:03:08,572
Charge bayonets.

1493
03:03:09,448 --> 03:03:11,283
Charge bayonets!

1494
03:03:13,368 --> 03:03:17,915
Your Emperor is with you.
You are the brave of Austerlitz.

1495
03:03:18,790 --> 03:03:20,334
Never surrender.

1496
03:03:21,168 --> 03:03:23,670
For homeland and glory!

1497
03:03:30,552 --> 03:03:33,304
Shoulder to shoulder! Form lines!

1498
03:03:33,305 --> 03:03:35,057
Shoulder to shoulder.

1499
03:03:42,022 --> 03:03:43,315
Infantry, advance.

1500
03:03:43,815 --> 03:03:47,151
Battalion and infantry!

1501
03:03:47,152 --> 03:03:49,655
Advance!

1502
03:03:55,327 --> 03:03:56,703
Keep the line!

1503
03:03:58,997 --> 03:04:01,208
Footmen, fire!

1504
03:04:05,128 --> 03:04:07,214
Second line, fire.

1505
03:04:11,134 --> 03:04:12,511
Prepare to charge!

1506
03:04:14,930 --> 03:04:16,306
Charge!

1507
03:04:23,146 --> 03:04:24,857
Go on! Batter them!

1508
03:04:27,276 --> 03:04:29,444
Advance!

1509
03:04:41,707 --> 03:04:42,916
Cavalry advance, sir?

1510
03:04:44,168 --> 03:04:45,460
Cavalry advance.

1511
03:04:46,587 --> 03:04:50,299
Prepare for counter.

1512
03:04:51,633 --> 03:04:53,302
Full support.

1513
03:05:28,253 --> 03:05:32,049
No. He can't help himself.

1514
03:05:33,300 --> 03:05:35,010
Sir, Blücher.

1515
03:05:41,725 --> 03:05:42,726
Thank God.

1516
03:05:43,227 --> 03:05:48,190
Your Majesty!

1517
03:05:49,525 --> 03:05:52,401
Come see how a marshal of France dies!

1518
03:05:52,402 --> 03:05:55,072
Yeah! Hyah!

1519
03:06:21,265 --> 03:06:23,559
Yeah!

1520
03:06:58,010 --> 03:07:02,472
The battle is mine.
There will be an end to the war.

1521
03:07:10,105 --> 03:07:11,940
Senior officer, on deck!

1522
03:07:14,484 --> 03:07:16,361
Good day.

1523
03:07:19,615 --> 03:07:24,328
I am the first to admit
when I make a mistake. But I never do.

1524
03:07:25,078 --> 03:07:26,955
Because it is geometry.

1525
03:07:28,373 --> 03:07:30,751
I simply know
precisely where to place a cannon.

1526
03:07:32,294 --> 03:07:36,590
But tragically I cannot transfer
this knowledge to my marshals.

1527
03:07:38,091 --> 03:07:41,303
That might be
what is most difficult in life.

1528
03:07:43,263 --> 03:07:44,932
Accepting the failures of others.

1529
03:07:46,016 --> 03:07:47,267
You must not do that.

1530
03:07:49,728 --> 03:07:51,063
Encourage greatness.

1531
03:07:56,401 --> 03:07:57,528
Mind your head, sir.

1532
03:08:00,447 --> 03:08:02,199
Mind your head, sir.

1533
03:08:09,331 --> 03:08:12,416
- What are they doing there?
- Sir, it's the midshipmen. They adore him.

1534
03:08:12,417 --> 03:08:13,584
Well, get 'em out.

1535
03:08:13,585 --> 03:08:15,587
Clear the room. Quickly.

1536
03:08:31,979 --> 03:08:34,021
- Your grace...
- Good morning, General.

1537
03:08:34,022 --> 03:08:35,399
These boys are delightful.

1538
03:08:37,317 --> 03:08:38,609
May I sit down?

1539
03:08:38,610 --> 03:08:39,695
Please.

1540
03:08:40,863 --> 03:08:42,281
And this breakfast.

1541
03:08:43,282 --> 03:08:47,661
Now I know why you have
such a successful navy. Thank you.

1542
03:08:53,542 --> 03:08:55,918
I've never visited
the English countryside.

1543
03:08:55,919 --> 03:08:57,880
I imagine I'll love the Cotswolds...

1544
03:09:01,341 --> 03:09:04,428
soft rolling hills, gentle light.

1545
03:09:06,388 --> 03:09:10,766
My dear sir,
it is only by a narrow margin of opinion

1546
03:09:10,767 --> 03:09:13,061
that you have been spared the fate
of being shot.

1547
03:09:14,813 --> 03:09:17,064
Politically, I'm afraid it's impossible

1548
03:09:17,065 --> 03:09:20,569
for the British government
to allow you to stay in England.

1549
03:09:22,654 --> 03:09:25,698
You are permitted three officers
and 12 servants

1550
03:09:25,699 --> 03:09:27,993
to accompany you into exile.

1551
03:09:28,827 --> 03:09:32,496
Exile will be contained to the island
of Saint Helena

1552
03:09:32,497 --> 03:09:37,169
under the watchful eye
of Governor Hudson Lowe and his family.

1553
03:09:39,505 --> 03:09:40,506
Saint...

1554
03:09:41,715 --> 03:09:45,135
Helena. It's a small island.

1555
03:09:45,969 --> 03:09:47,596
More of a rock, really.

1556
03:09:48,639 --> 03:09:51,391
A thousand miles
from the mainland of Africa.

1557
03:09:52,142 --> 03:09:56,647
I'm told it's very pretty, tranquil.
You'll have time to reflect.

1558
03:09:58,357 --> 03:10:00,525
Your correspondence will be monitored,

1559
03:10:00,526 --> 03:10:04,154
your presence verified twice daily
by the orderly officer.

1560
03:10:08,158 --> 03:10:09,201
I see.

1561
03:10:11,453 --> 03:10:13,497
If I were to land on British soil,

1562
03:10:14,081 --> 03:10:17,084
I would be allowed, by your law,
to stand here for a trial.

1563
03:10:17,584 --> 03:10:19,211
You are denying me that.

1564
03:10:31,431 --> 03:10:34,268
One must also not forget
that I am only a man.

1565
03:10:37,020 --> 03:10:38,730
You forgot it, sir.

1566
03:10:40,607 --> 03:10:42,484
You thought you were a god.

1567
03:10:45,821 --> 03:10:47,573
I never said such a thing.

1568
03:10:57,165 --> 03:11:00,419
Fix that rigging line. Draw up the sails.

1569
03:11:02,004 --> 03:11:03,338
Go below deck!

1570
03:11:12,472 --> 03:11:16,810
<i>What will you do now?
I hate to see you alone.</i>

1571
03:11:18,187 --> 03:11:22,983
<i>Will you come to me? Will I forgive you?</i>

1572
03:11:24,651 --> 03:11:27,070
<i>My sweet, stubborn Emperor.</i>

1573
03:11:28,155 --> 03:11:30,741
<i>I let you loose and let you come to ruin.</i>

1574
03:11:32,075 --> 03:11:35,286
<i>Next time, I will be Emperor,</i>

1575
03:11:35,287 --> 03:11:37,289
<i>and you will do as I say.</i>

1576
03:11:44,546 --> 03:11:47,257
<i>Well, you were right.</i>

1577
03:11:48,675 --> 03:11:51,220
<i>Every night I beg to see you in my dreams.</i>

1578
03:11:52,137 --> 03:11:55,432
<i>And when I do, you turn me away.</i>

1579
03:12:20,624 --> 03:12:22,125
Precision!

1580
03:12:25,128 --> 03:12:26,380
Precision.

1581
03:12:28,841 --> 03:12:30,092
Slow down.

1582
03:12:33,428 --> 03:12:35,347
First, you salute each other.

1583
03:12:40,143 --> 03:12:41,562
And drop down like this.

1584
03:12:42,312 --> 03:12:43,355
<i>En garde.</i>

1585
03:12:44,523 --> 03:12:45,649
Left foot back.

1586
03:12:46,483 --> 03:12:47,484
Yes.

1587
03:12:48,277 --> 03:12:49,945
Then you'll do two attacks.

1588
03:12:50,571 --> 03:12:53,281
Prime and seconde.

1589
03:12:53,282 --> 03:12:54,532
Okay?

1590
03:12:54,533 --> 03:12:55,783
Hold this.

1591
03:12:55,784 --> 03:12:56,869
Very good.

1592
03:13:12,593 --> 03:13:14,011
This way's more fun.

1593
03:13:23,270 --> 03:13:25,230
Girls, what's the capital of France?

1594
03:13:27,774 --> 03:13:28,775
Paris.

1595
03:13:29,484 --> 03:13:30,485
And Russia?

1596
03:13:31,195 --> 03:13:33,447
Petersburg. And Moscow before.

1597
03:13:35,407 --> 03:13:39,828
Moscow.
And who burnt Moscow to the ground?

1598
03:13:44,249 --> 03:13:45,250
I don't know, sir.

1599
03:13:46,710 --> 03:13:47,711
I did.

1600
03:13:48,504 --> 03:13:52,341
I believe, sir, the Russians burnt it
to get rid of the French.

1601
03:13:52,841 --> 03:13:53,842
Who told you that?

1602
03:13:54,635 --> 03:13:56,094
It's common knowledge, sir.

1603
03:14:00,182 --> 03:14:02,476
Go. Go play.

1604
03:14:04,061 --> 03:14:05,062
<i>En garde.</i>

1605
03:14:08,357 --> 03:14:10,943
<i>Can I tell you
what I have waiting for you?</i>

1606
03:14:13,111 --> 03:14:17,324
<i>It is a secret.
And I will show you when you arrive.</i>

1607
03:14:20,911 --> 03:14:26,250
<i>Come to me, Napoleon.
And let's try this again.</i>
