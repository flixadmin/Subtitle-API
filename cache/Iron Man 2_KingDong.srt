1
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,602
Been a while since I was up here
in front of you.

2
00:00:11,627 --> 00:00:14,772
Maybe I'll do us all a favor
and just stick to the cards.

3
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,528
There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred

4
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:22,130
on the freeway and the rooftop...

5
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:25,158
Sorry, Mr. Stark, do you
honestly expect us to believe that

6
00:00:25,183 --> 00:00:28,828
that was a bodyguard in a suit
that conveniently appeared,

7
00:00:28,853 --> 00:00:31,622
despite the fact
that you sorely despise bodyguards?

8
00:00:31,748 --> 00:00:32,832
Yes.

9
00:00:32,957 --> 00:00:37,587
And this mysterious bodyguard
was somehow equipped

10
00:00:37,612 --> 00:00:40,990
with an undisclosed
Stark high-tech powered battle...

11
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:43,134
I know that it's confusing.

12
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,891
It is one thing to question 
the official story,

13
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:48,599
and another thing entirely
to make wild accusations,

14
00:00:48,623 --> 00:00:50,485
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.

15
00:00:53,102 --> 00:00:56,356
I mean, let's face it,
I'm not the heroic type.

16
00:00:56,481 --> 00:01:01,569
A laundry list of character defects,
all the mistakes I've made, largely public.

17
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:03,279
The truth is...

18
00:01:08,284 --> 00:01:10,203
I am Iron Man.

19
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,173
Ivan.

20
00:01:27,428 --> 00:01:28,846
Vanya.

21
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:08,149
270 at 30 knots.
Holding steady at 15,000 feet.

22
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,569
You are clear for exfiltration
over the drop zone.

23
00:07:05,933 --> 00:07:10,063
Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!

24
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:12,482
It's good to be back.

25
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,252
- You missed me?
- Blow something up!

26
00:07:16,277 --> 00:07:19,550
I missed you, too.
Blow something up? I already did that.

27
00:07:20,484 --> 00:07:23,696
I'm not saying that the world is enjoying

28
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:27,997
its longest period of uninterrupted peace
in years because of me.

29
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,714
I'm not saying that
from the ashes of captivity,

30
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:41,844
never has a greater phoenix metaphor
been personified in human history.

31
00:07:44,973 --> 00:07:50,853
I'm not saying that Uncle Sam
can kick back on a lawn chair,

32
00:07:50,878 --> 00:07:52,664
sipping on an iced tea

33
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:55,692
because I haven't come across anyone
who's man enough

34
00:07:55,717 --> 00:07:58,653
to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.

35
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:04,283
I love you, Tony!

36
00:08:04,308 --> 00:08:06,494
Please, it's not about me.

37
00:08:07,912 --> 00:08:09,664
It's not about you.

38
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,919
It's not even about us. It's about legacy.

39
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,756
It's about what we choose to
leave behind for future generations.

40
00:08:18,781 --> 00:08:22,969
And that's why for the next year
and for the first time since 1974,

41
00:08:22,994 --> 00:08:25,471
the best and brightest men and women

42
00:08:25,496 --> 00:08:27,515
of nations and corporations
the world over

43
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,102
will pool their resources,
share their collective vision,

44
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:34,230
to leave behind a brighter future.

45
00:08:34,255 --> 00:08:36,065
It's not about us.

46
00:08:36,858 --> 00:08:40,111
Therefore, what I'm saying,
if I'm saying anything,

47
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:42,739
is welcome back to the Stark Expo.

48
00:08:46,534 --> 00:08:49,162
And now,
making a special guest appearance

49
00:08:49,187 --> 00:08:51,764
from the great beyond
to tell you what it's all about,

50
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:54,250
please welcome my father, Howard.

51
00:08:56,627 --> 00:08:59,547
Everything is achievable
through technology.

52
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,824
Better living, robust health,

53
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:06,971
and for the first time in human history,
the possibility of world peace.

54
00:09:06,996 --> 00:09:08,973
So, from all of us here
at Stark Industries,

55
00:09:08,998 --> 00:09:13,853
I would like to personally introduce you
to the City of the Future.

56
00:09:13,878 --> 00:09:17,690
Technology holds infinite possibilities
for mankind,

57
00:09:17,715 --> 00:09:20,610
and will one day
rid society of all its ills.

58
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:24,280
Soon, technology will affect the way
you live your life every day.

59
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:26,065
No more tedious work,

60
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:30,662
leaving more time for leisure activities
and enjoying the sweet life.

61
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:33,498
The Stark Expo. Welcome.

62
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,589
{\an8}We are coming to you live
from the kickoff of the Stark Expo,

63
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:44,550
{\an8}where Tony Stark
has just walked offstage.

64
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,519
{\an8}Don't worry if you can't
make it down here tonight

65
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,721
{\an8}because this Expo goes on all year long.

66
00:09:48,746 --> 00:09:50,807
{\an8}And I'm gonna be here
checking out all the attractions

67
00:09:50,832 --> 00:09:54,435
{\an8}and the pavilions and the inventions
from all around the world.

68
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,972
All right, it's a zoo out there, watch out.

69
00:09:57,005 --> 00:09:59,899
- Open up, let's go.
- Hey! Nice to see you.

70
00:09:59,924 --> 00:10:02,527
- All right. Thank you. I remember you.
- Tony, Tony...

71
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:04,153
Hey, hey...

72
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:06,698
- Call me.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.

73
00:10:06,723 --> 00:10:09,242
Hello. It would be a pleasure.

74
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:10,827
- Okay.
- See you, buddy.

75
00:10:10,852 --> 00:10:11,995
This is Larry.

76
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,163
Hey, the oracle of Oracle.
What a pleasure.

77
00:10:14,188 --> 00:10:15,748
- Nice to see you.
- Call me. Call me.

78
00:10:15,773 --> 00:10:17,625
- Larry King.
- Larry!

79
00:10:18,126 --> 00:10:20,461
Yes, my people, my people.

80
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,088
Come on, Tony. There we go.

81
00:10:22,113 --> 00:10:24,048
- Very mellow.
- That wasn't so bad.

82
00:10:24,073 --> 00:10:25,425
No, it was perfect.

83
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,010
Look what we got here, the new model.

84
00:10:27,035 --> 00:10:28,803
- Hey, does she come with the car?
- I certainly hope so.

85
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:29,971
- Hi.
- Hi.

86
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,222
- And you are?
- Marshal.

87
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:33,266
- Irish. I like it.
- Pleased to meet you, Tony.

88
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,518
I'm on the wheel. Do you mind?
Where you from?

89
00:10:35,543 --> 00:10:36,811
- Bedford.
- What are you doing here?

90
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,133
- Looking for you.
- Yeah? You found me.

91
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:44,193
- What are you up to later?
- Serving subpoenas.

92
00:10:46,696 --> 00:10:47,822
He doesn't like to be handed things.

93
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,490
- Yeah, I have a peeve.
- I got it.

94
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:53,036
You are hereby ordered to appear before
the Senate Armed Services Committee

95
00:10:53,061 --> 00:10:54,787
tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.

96
00:10:54,812 --> 00:10:56,456
- Can I see a badge?
- You wanna see the badge?

97
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:58,071
He likes the badge.

98
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,960
- You still like it?
- Yep.

99
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:04,649
How far are we from D.C.?

100
00:11:04,674 --> 00:11:06,344
D.C.? 250 miles.

101
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:13,650
{\an8}Mr. Stark, could we pick up now
where we left off?

102
00:11:13,825 --> 00:11:15,241
Mr. Stark. Please.

103
00:11:15,266 --> 00:11:16,909
- Yes, dear?
- Can I have your attention?

104
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:17,977
Absolutely.

105
00:11:18,002 --> 00:11:21,022
Do you or do you not possess
a specialized weapon?

106
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,096
{\an8}- I do not.
- You do not?

107
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,791
{\an8}I do not. Well, it depends
on how you define the word "weapon".

108
00:11:25,816 --> 00:11:26,889
The Iron Man weapon.

109
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,838
My device does not fit that description.

110
00:11:28,863 --> 00:11:30,549
Well... How would you describe it?

111
00:11:30,574 --> 00:11:33,577
I would describe it by defining it
as what it is, Senator.

112
00:11:33,785 --> 00:11:34,522
{\an8}As?

113
00:11:34,546 --> 00:11:37,377
{\an8}It's a high-tech prosthesis.

114
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:38,765
That is... That is...

115
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,142
That's actually the most apt description
I can make of it.

116
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,002
It's a weapon. It's a weapon, Mr. Stark.

117
00:11:43,027 --> 00:11:46,299
Please, if your priority was actually
the well-being of the American citizen...

118
00:11:46,324 --> 00:11:48,347
My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon

119
00:11:48,372 --> 00:11:50,591
turned over to the people of
the United States of America.

120
00:11:50,616 --> 00:11:52,400
{\an8}Well, you can forget it.

121
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:57,033
I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one.

122
00:11:57,058 --> 00:11:59,477
To turn over the Iron Man suit
would be to turn over myself,

123
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,564
which is tantamount
to indentured servitude or prostitution,

124
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,215
depending on what state you're in.

125
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,358
You can't have it.

126
00:12:05,383 --> 00:12:07,353
Look, I'm no expert...

127
00:12:07,378 --> 00:12:10,643
In prostitution? Of course not.
You're a senator. Come on.

128
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:14,471
I'm no expert in weapons.

129
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,678
{\an8}We have somebody here
who is an expert on weapons.

130
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:21,626
{\an8}I'd now like to call Justin Hammer,
our current primary weapons contractor.

131
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,920
{\an8}Let the record reflect that I observed
Mr. Hammer entering the chamber,

132
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,365
{\an8}and I am wondering

133
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,045
{\an8}if and when any actual expert
will also be in attendance.

134
00:12:35,138 --> 00:12:39,434
{\an8}Absolutely. I'm no expert.
I defer to you, Anthony.

135
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,396
You're the wonder boy.

136
00:12:41,644 --> 00:12:43,505
Senator, if I may.

137
00:12:43,855 --> 00:12:48,276
I may well not be an expert,
but you know who was the expert?

138
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:51,025
Your dad. Howard Stark.

139
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:55,615
Really a father to us all,
and to the military-industrial age.

140
00:12:56,117 --> 00:13:00,341
Let's just be clear.
He was no flower child. He was a lion.

141
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:03,224
We all know why we're here.
In the last six months,

142
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:07,437
Anthony Stark has created a sword
with untold possibilities.

143
00:13:07,462 --> 00:13:10,256
And yet he insists it's a shield.

144
00:13:10,381 --> 00:13:14,969
{\an8}He asks us to trust him
as we cower behind it.

145
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:18,206
I wish I were comforted, Anthony,
I really do.

146
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:23,161
I'd love to leave my door unlocked when
I leave the house, but this ain't Canada.

147
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,930
You know, we live in a world
of grave threats,

148
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:28,650
threats that Mr. Stark
will not always be able to foresee.

149
00:13:29,737 --> 00:13:30,623
Thank you.

150
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:33,709
God bless Iron Man. God bless America.

151
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:37,153
That is well said, Mr. Hammer.

152
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,665
The committee would now like to invite

153
00:13:39,687 --> 00:13:42,573
Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes 
to the chamber.

154
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,040
Rhodey? What?

155
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:53,633
Hey, buddy.
I didn't expect to see you here.

156
00:13:53,658 --> 00:13:56,444
Look, it's me, I'm here.
Deal with it. Let's move on.

157
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:57,512
I just...

158
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,113
- Drop it.
- All right, I'll drop it.

159
00:13:59,146 --> 00:14:02,608
{\an8}I have before me a complete report
on the Iron Man weapon,

160
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,470
{\an8}compiled by Colonel Rhodes.
And, Colonel, for the record,

161
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:08,564
{\an8}can you please read page 57,
paragraph four?

162
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:11,784
You're requesting that I read specific
selections from my report, Senator?

163
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,518
Yes, sir.

164
00:14:12,543 --> 00:14:14,413
It was my understanding that 
I was going to be testifying

165
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,572
in a much more comprehensive
and detailed manner.

166
00:14:16,597 --> 00:14:18,292
I understand.
A lot of things have changed today.

167
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:22,261
You do understand that reading a single
paragraph out of context does not reflect

168
00:14:22,286 --> 00:14:24,259
- the summary of my final...
- Just read it, Colonel. I do.

169
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,314
Thank you.

170
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:27,904
Very well.

171
00:14:29,898 --> 00:14:33,337
{\an8}"As he does not operate within
any definable branch of government,

172
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:39,195
{\an8}"Iron Man presents a potential threat to
the security of both the nation

173
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,897
{\an8}and to her interests."

174
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:44,125
I did, however, go on to summarize
that the benefits of Iron Man

175
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,660
far outweigh the liabilities.

176
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,919
{\an8}- And that it would be in our interest
- That's enough, Colonel.

177
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,181
{\an8}- to fold Mr. Stark
- That's enough.

178
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,690
{\an8}into the existing chain of command,
Senator.

179
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:53,935
I'm not a joiner, but I'll consider
Secretary of Defense, if you ask nice.

180
00:14:54,214 --> 00:14:56,528
We can amend the hours a little bit.

181
00:14:57,511 --> 00:14:59,468
I'd like to go on and show, if I may,

182
00:14:59,492 --> 00:15:01,576
the imagery that's connected 
to your report.

183
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:04,420
I believe it is somewhat premature 
to reveal these images

184
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,051
to the general public at this time.

185
00:15:06,076 --> 00:15:07,807
With all due respect, Colonel,
I understand.

186
00:15:07,832 --> 00:15:11,878
And if you could just narrate those
for us, we'd be very grateful.

187
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,684
{\an8}Let's have the images.

188
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,693
{\an8}Intelligence suggests
that the devices seen in these photos

189
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:23,097
{\an8}are, in fact, attempts at making
manned copies of Mr. Stark's suit.

190
00:15:23,245 --> 00:15:28,250
This has been corroborated by our allies
and local intelligence on the ground,

191
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:33,441
indicating that these suits are quite
possibly, at this moment, operational.

192
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,528
Hold on one second, buddy.
Let me see something here.

193
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:40,895
Boy, I'm good. I commandeered your screens.

194
00:15:41,777 --> 00:15:44,572
I need them.
Time for a little transparency.

195
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,721
{\an8}- Now, let's see what's really going on.
- What is he doing?

196
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,957
If you will direct your attention to
said screens,

197
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,626
I believe that's North Korea.

198
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:02,720
Can you turn that off? Take it off.

199
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:03,972
Iran.

200
00:16:07,475 --> 00:16:10,421
No grave immediate threat here.

201
00:16:10,445 --> 00:16:11,659
Is that Justin Hammer?

202
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,768
{\an8}How did Hammer get in the game?

203
00:16:14,857 --> 00:16:16,734
{\an8}Justin, you're on TV. Focus up.

204
00:16:17,485 --> 00:16:21,280
Okay, give me a left twist.
Left's good. Turn to the right.

205
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:26,190
{\an8}Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

206
00:16:26,577 --> 00:16:27,704
{\an8}Wow.

207
00:16:28,623 --> 00:16:32,418
{\an8}Yeah, I'd say most countries,
five, 10 years away.

208
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,935
Hammer Industries, 20.

209
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,546
{\an8}I'd like to point out that
that test pilot survived.

210
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,273
{\an8}I think we're done,
is the point that he's making.

211
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:41,585
{\an8}- I don't think there's any reason...
- The point is, you're welcome, I guess.

212
00:16:41,592 --> 00:16:44,387
- For what?
- Because I'm your nuclear deterrent.

213
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,991
It's working.
We're safe. America is secure.

214
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,476
You want my property? You can't have it.
But I did you a big favor.

215
00:16:51,248 --> 00:16:54,038
I've successfully privatized world peace.

216
00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:59,569
What more do you want? For now!

217
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:03,239
I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.

218
00:17:03,364 --> 00:17:06,701
{\an8}<i>Bleep</i> you, Mr. Stark. <i>Bleep</i> you, buddy.

219
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:08,911
We're adjourned.
We're adjourned for today.

220
00:17:09,037 --> 00:17:11,289
- Okay.
- You've been a delight.

221
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,380
My bond is with the people.

222
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:24,741
And I will serve this great nation
at the pleasure of myself.

223
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:29,807
If there's one thing I've proven, it's that
you can count on me to pleasure myself.

224
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,011
Wake up. Daddy's home.

225
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,589
Welcome home, sir.

226
00:18:08,718 --> 00:18:10,624
Congratulations on the opening ceremonies.

227
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:13,652
They were such a success,
as was your Senate hearing.

228
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,703
And may I say how refreshing it is

229
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:18,467
to finally see you in a video
with your clothing on, sir.

230
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:22,485
You!

231
00:18:23,111 --> 00:18:25,279
I swear to God I'll dismantle you.
I'll soak your motherboard.

232
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,241
I'll turn you into a wine rack.

233
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:31,869
How many ounces a day of this
gobbledegook am I supposed to drink?

234
00:18:31,995 --> 00:18:35,915
We are up to 80 ounces a day
to counteract the symptoms, sir.

235
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,876
Check palladium levels.

236
00:18:40,837 --> 00:18:43,131
Blood toxicity, 24%.

237
00:18:44,585 --> 00:18:47,068
It appears that the continued use
of the Iron Man suit

238
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:49,368
is accelerating your condition.

239
00:18:51,014 --> 00:18:53,349
Another core has been depleted.

240
00:18:56,763 --> 00:18:58,348
God, they're running out quick.

241
00:18:58,443 --> 00:19:01,249
I have run simulations
on every known element,

242
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:04,892
and none can serve as a viable
replacement for the palladium core.

243
00:19:07,565 --> 00:19:10,329
You are running out of both time
and options.

244
00:19:14,357 --> 00:19:18,860
Unfortunately, the device that's
keeping you alive is also killing you.

245
00:19:20,448 --> 00:19:21,899
Miss Potts is approaching.

246
00:19:21,924 --> 00:19:24,801
- I recommend that you inform her...
- Mute.

247
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:29,594
Is this a joke?

248
00:19:31,012 --> 00:19:32,680
- What are you thinking?
- What?

249
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:35,058
- What are you thinking?
- Hey, I'm thinking I'm busy.

250
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:37,377
And you're angry about something.

251
00:19:37,602 --> 00:19:38,936
Do you have the sniffles?
I don't wanna get sick.

252
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,556
- Did you just donate
- Keep your business.

253
00:19:40,563 --> 00:19:44,067
our entire modern art collection to the

254
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,894
- Boy Scouts of America.
- Boy Scouts of America?

255
00:19:45,902 --> 00:19:47,654
Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation.

256
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,215
I didn't physically check the crates
but, basically, yes.

257
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,468
And it's not "our" collection,
it's my collection. No offence.

258
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:57,281
No, you know what? I think I'm actually 
entitled to say "our" collection,

259
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,243
considering the time that I put in,
over 10 years, curating that.

260
00:20:01,264 --> 00:20:02,578
It was a tax write-off. I needed that.

261
00:20:02,603 --> 00:20:07,590
You know, there's only about 8,011 things
that I really need to talk to you about.

262
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,777
Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out. The
Bridgeport's already machining that part.

263
00:20:10,802 --> 00:20:13,137
The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.

264
00:20:13,162 --> 00:20:15,573
I need you to wear a surgical mask
until you're feeling better.

265
00:20:15,598 --> 00:20:16,699
- Is that okay?
- That's rude.

266
00:20:16,724 --> 00:20:19,602
There's nothing more important to me than
the Expo. It's my primary point of concern.

267
00:20:19,627 --> 00:20:22,956
- I don't know why you're...
- The Expo is your ego gone crazy.

268
00:20:22,981 --> 00:20:24,329
Wow. Look at that.

269
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:28,419
That's modern art. That's going up.

270
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:30,860
- You've got to be kidding.
- I'm gonna put this up right now.

271
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:33,697
- This is vital.
- Stark is in complete disarray.

272
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:35,969
- You understand that?
- No. Our stocks have never been higher.

273
00:20:35,994 --> 00:20:38,287
- Yes, from a managerial standpoint.
- You are... Well, if it's messy,

274
00:20:38,312 --> 00:20:39,790
- then let's double back.
- Let me give you an example.

275
00:20:39,815 --> 00:20:41,459
- Let's move on to another subject.
- No, no, no, no.

276
00:20:41,484 --> 00:20:44,220
You are not taking down the Barnett Newman
and hanging that up!

277
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:46,354
I'm not taking it down.
I'm just replacing it with this.

278
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,814
- Let's see what I can get going here.
- Okay, fine.

279
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:52,143
My point is, we have already awarded
contracts to the wind farm people.

280
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,087
Don't say "wind farm".
I'm already feeling gassy.

281
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,985
And to the plastic plantation tree,
which was your idea, by the way.

282
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,156
Those people are on payroll

283
00:20:57,181 --> 00:20:58,933
- Everything was my idea.
- and you won't make a decision.

284
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,827
I don't care about
the liberal agenda any more.

285
00:21:00,852 --> 00:21:03,187
It's boring. Boring.
I'm giving you a boring alert.

286
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:04,438
You do it.

287
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,665
I do what?

288
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,890
Excellent idea. I just figured this out.
You run the company.

289
00:21:07,915 --> 00:21:10,486
- Yeah, I'm trying to run the company.
- Pepper, I need you to run the company.

290
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:11,988
- Well, stop trying to do it and do it.
- You will not

291
00:21:12,013 --> 00:21:13,509
- I'm not asking you to try.
- give me the information

292
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,858
- I'm asking you to physically do it.
- in order to...

293
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,444
- I need you to do it.
- I am trying to do it.

294
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,177
- Pepper, you're not listening to me!
- No, you are not listening to me.

295
00:21:18,202 --> 00:21:19,212
I'm trying to make you CEO.

296
00:21:20,008 --> 00:21:21,602
Why won't you let me?

297
00:21:22,623 --> 00:21:24,063
Have you been drinking?

298
00:21:24,771 --> 00:21:25,647
Chlorophyll.

299
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:31,694
I hereby irrevocably appoint you
chairman and CEO of Stark Industries,

300
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:33,023
effective immediately.

301
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,847
Yeah, done deal. Okay?

302
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:43,093
I've actually given this a fair amount
of thought, believe it or not.

303
00:21:43,118 --> 00:21:45,489
Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak,

304
00:21:46,142 --> 00:21:49,812
trying to figure out
who a worthy successor would be.

305
00:21:49,984 --> 00:21:51,736
And then I realized...

306
00:21:54,322 --> 00:21:56,824
...it's you. It's always been you.

307
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,236
I thought there'd be a legal issue,

308
00:22:00,257 --> 00:22:03,648
but actually I'm capable of
appointing my successor.

309
00:22:04,248 --> 00:22:06,209
My successor being you.

310
00:22:08,348 --> 00:22:09,975
Congratulations?

311
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:13,383
- Take it, just take it.
- I don't know what to think.

312
00:22:13,408 --> 00:22:14,934
Don't think. Drink.

313
00:22:19,527 --> 00:22:21,029
There you go.

314
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:05,786
The notary's here! Can you please
come sign the transfer paperwork?

315
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:07,611
I'm on happy time.

316
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,312
- Sorry.
- What the hell was that?

317
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,697
It's called mixed martial arts.
It's been around for three weeks.

318
00:23:17,722 --> 00:23:19,766
It's called dirty boxing.
There's nothing new about it.

319
00:23:19,991 --> 00:23:22,067
All right, put them up. Come on.

320
00:23:25,121 --> 00:23:29,959
I promise you this is the only time
I will ask you to sign over your company.

321
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,546
I need you to initial each box.

322
00:23:34,172 --> 00:23:36,883
Lesson one. Never take your eye off...

323
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:40,386
That's it. I'm done.

324
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:42,889
- What's your name, lady?
- Rushman. Natalie Rushman.

325
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,657
Front and centre. Come into the church.

326
00:23:44,682 --> 00:23:48,436
- No. You're seriously not gonna ask...
- lf it pleases the court, which it does.

327
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:51,856
- It's no problem.
- I'm sorry. He's very eccentric.

328
00:24:05,453 --> 00:24:06,579
What?

329
00:24:10,335 --> 00:24:13,087
- Can you give her a lesson?
- No problem.

330
00:24:13,356 --> 00:24:15,317
- Pepper.
- What?

331
00:24:16,506 --> 00:24:18,816
- Who is she?
- She is from legal.

332
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:22,987
And she is potentially a very expensive
sexual harassment lawsuit

333
00:24:23,012 --> 00:24:25,239
- if you keep ogling her like that.
- I need a new assistant, boss.

334
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:28,091
Yes, and I've got
three excellent potential candidates.

335
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,744
They're lined up and ready to meet you.

336
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,705
I don't have time to meet.
I need someone now. I feel like it's her.

337
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:33,873
No, it's not.

338
00:24:33,898 --> 00:24:35,650
- You ever boxed before?
- I have, yes.

339
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:39,696
What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot
Camp? Crunch? Something like that?

340
00:24:39,721 --> 00:24:43,533
- How do I spell your name, Natalie?
- R-U-S-H-M-A-N.

341
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:47,372
- What, are you gonna google her now?
- I thought I was ogling her.

342
00:24:48,076 --> 00:24:51,677
- Wow. Very, very impressive individual.
- You're so predictable, you know that?

343
00:24:51,702 --> 00:24:54,005
She's fluent in French, Italian,
Russian, Latin.

344
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,958
- Who speaks Latin?
- No one speaks Latin.

345
00:24:55,983 --> 00:24:58,235
- No one speaks Latin?
- It's a dead language.

346
00:24:58,513 --> 00:25:00,350
You can read Latin
or you can write Latin,

347
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,026
- Did you model in Tokyo?
- but you can't speak Latin...

348
00:25:02,051 --> 00:25:03,761
- 'Cause she modelled in Tokyo.
- Well...

349
00:25:03,823 --> 00:25:05,321
I need her.
She's got everything that I need.

350
00:25:05,346 --> 00:25:07,536
Rule number one,
never take your eye off your opponent.

351
00:25:10,184 --> 00:25:11,561
Oh, my God!

352
00:25:13,855 --> 00:25:16,566
- Happy!
- That's what I'm talking about.

353
00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:18,084
- I just slipped.
- You did?

354
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:20,403
- Yeah.
- Looks like a TKO to me.

355
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,949
Just... I need your impression.

356
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:27,844
You have a quiet reserve.
I don't know, you have an old soul.

357
00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:30,330
- I meant your fingerprint.
- Right.

358
00:25:33,207 --> 00:25:36,711
- So, how are we doing?
- Great. Just wrapping up. Hey.

359
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:41,174
- You're the boss.
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?

360
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:43,225
- No.
- Yes, that will be all, Miss Rushman.

361
00:25:43,343 --> 00:25:45,136
Thank you very much.

362
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,736
- I want one.
- No.

363
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,844
You know, it's Europe. Whatever happens
the next 20 minutes, just go with it.

364
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,005
Go with it? Go with what?

365
00:26:28,017 --> 00:26:29,173
- Mr. Stark?
- Hey.

366
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,448
Hello. How was your flight?

367
00:26:30,473 --> 00:26:31,933
It was excellent.
Boy, it's nice to see you.

368
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:35,649
We have one photographer
from the ACM, if you don't mind. Okay?

369
00:26:36,312 --> 00:26:38,456
- When did this happen?
- What? You made me do it.

370
00:26:38,481 --> 00:26:40,984
- I made you do what?
- You quit. Smile. Look right there.

371
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,311
Stop acting constipated.

372
00:26:42,318 --> 00:26:43,736
- Don't flare your nostrils.
- You are so predictable.

373
00:26:43,761 --> 00:26:44,963
- That's the amazing thing.
- Right this way.

374
00:26:44,988 --> 00:26:46,656
- You look fantastic.
- Why, thank you very much.

375
00:26:46,681 --> 00:26:48,574
But that's unprofessional.
What's on the docket?

376
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:50,677
You have a 9:30 dinner.

377
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,512
- Perfect. I'll be there at 11:00.
- Absolutely.

378
00:26:52,537 --> 00:26:54,330
- Is this us?
- It can be.

379
00:26:54,355 --> 00:26:56,082
- Great. Make it us.
- Okay.

380
00:26:56,107 --> 00:26:58,626
- Mr. Musk. How are you?
- Hi, Pepper.

381
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:00,586
- Congratulations on the promotion.
- Thank you very much.

382
00:27:00,611 --> 00:27:02,922
Elon, how's it going?
Those Merlin engines are fantastic.

383
00:27:02,947 --> 00:27:05,008
Thank you. Yeah, I've got an idea
for an electric jet.

384
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:06,175
- You do?
- Yeah.

385
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,102
Then we'll make it work.

386
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,138
- You want a massage?
- Oh, God. No,

387
00:27:10,163 --> 00:27:11,681
- I don't want a massage.
- I'll have Natalie make an...

388
00:27:11,706 --> 00:27:13,182
- I don't want Natalie to do...
- Don't want you tense.

389
00:27:13,207 --> 00:27:14,434
By the way, I didn't mean
to spring this on you.

390
00:27:14,459 --> 00:27:15,643
Thank you very much.

391
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:17,687
- Green is not your best color.
- Oh, please.

392
00:27:17,712 --> 00:27:19,314
Anthony! Is that you?

393
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,790
- My least favorite person on Earth.
- Hey, pal.

394
00:27:20,815 --> 00:27:22,066
- Justin Hammer.
- How you doing?

395
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:24,944
You're not the only rich guy here
with a fancy car.

396
00:27:24,969 --> 00:27:27,447
You know Christine Everhart
from Vanity Fair.

397
00:27:27,472 --> 00:27:28,756
- You guys know each other?
- Hi.

398
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:29,991
- Yes.
- Yes.

399
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:31,342
- Yes, roughly.
- We do.

400
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:35,371
BTW, big story.
The new CEO of Stark Industries.

401
00:27:35,396 --> 00:27:36,748
- I know. I know.
- Congratulations.

402
00:27:36,773 --> 00:27:40,293
My editor will kill me if I don't grab
a quote for our Powerful Women issue.

403
00:27:40,318 --> 00:27:41,544
- Can I?
- Sure.

404
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:44,130
She's actually doing a big spread on me
for Vanity Fair.

405
00:27:44,155 --> 00:27:46,132
I thought I'd throw her a bone, you know.

406
00:27:46,257 --> 00:27:47,300
- Right.
- Right?

407
00:27:47,325 --> 00:27:50,762
Well, she did quite a spread
on Tony last year.

408
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,297
And she wrote a story as well.

409
00:27:52,305 --> 00:27:54,307
- It was very impressive.
- That was good.

410
00:27:54,432 --> 00:27:56,434
- Very well done.
- Thank you.

411
00:27:56,459 --> 00:27:57,977
- I'm gonna go wash.
- Don't leave me.

412
00:27:58,002 --> 00:27:59,520
- Hey, buddy. How you doing?
- I'm all right.

413
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:00,897
- Looking gorgeous.
- Please, this is tough.

414
00:28:00,922 --> 00:28:03,608
- Can I ask you... Is this the first time
- Fromage.

415
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:05,293
- Say, "Brie".
- that you guys have seen each other?

416
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:06,742
God, that's so awful.

417
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,089
Listen, is it the first time you've seen
each other since the Senate?

418
00:28:10,114 --> 00:28:11,841
Since he got his contract revoked

419
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:14,152
- when you were attempting to...
- Actually, it's on hold.

420
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:16,238
That's not what I heard.
What's the difference between "hold"

421
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,156
- and "cancelled"? The truth?
- Yes, what is?

422
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:20,500
No. The truth is...
Why don't we put that away?

423
00:28:20,688 --> 00:28:24,587
The truth is, I'm actually hoping
to present something at your Expo.

424
00:28:24,743 --> 00:28:28,549
Well, if you invent something that
works, I'll make sure I get you a slot.

425
00:28:28,675 --> 00:28:30,843
- Mr. Stark, your corner table is ready.
- Yes?

426
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:33,137
I actually have a slot this year.
Yes, I do.

427
00:28:33,162 --> 00:28:36,291
- Hammer needs a slot, Christine.
- We kid, yeah.

428
00:28:37,308 --> 00:28:38,434
We kid. We're kidders.

429
00:29:00,753 --> 00:29:02,755
Got any other bad ideas?

430
00:29:07,088 --> 00:29:08,214
Tony!

431
00:29:12,093 --> 00:29:16,347
Tony and I... Tony... I love Tony Stark.
Tony loves me. We're not competitors.

432
00:29:16,372 --> 00:29:18,992
Him being out of the picture
created tremendous opportunities

433
00:29:19,017 --> 00:29:20,662
for Hammer Industries, you know?

434
00:29:21,515 --> 00:29:24,810
- Everything that Tony and I do
- Well, what's the use of having

435
00:29:24,835 --> 00:29:27,412
- is a healthy...
- and owning a race car...

436
00:29:27,984 --> 00:29:30,466
- ...competition.
- ...if you don't drive it?

437
00:29:31,988 --> 00:29:33,489
Is he driving?

438
00:29:40,788 --> 00:29:42,457
Natalie. Natalie!

439
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:44,701
- Yes, Miss Potts?
- Did you know about this?

440
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:46,878
This is the first that I have known of it.

441
00:29:47,587 --> 00:29:48,813
This... This cannot happen.

442
00:29:48,838 --> 00:29:50,465
Absolutely. I understand.
How can I help you?

443
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,799
- Where's Happy?
- He's waiting outside.

444
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:53,760
- Okay, get him. I need Happy.
- Right away.

445
00:29:54,489 --> 00:29:56,575
Tony's... You know, he...

446
00:29:56,763 --> 00:29:58,598
We're not competitive.
You know what I mean?

447
00:29:58,715 --> 00:29:59,758
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,

448
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:02,810
- can you excuse me just one second?
- Just read me what you wrote.

449
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:04,221
- I will. I will, after.
- Just read it back to me.

450
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,556
But I have to make one quick phone call.

451
00:30:05,563 --> 00:30:06,706
- Where are you going?
- This is great.

452
00:30:06,731 --> 00:30:08,066
- I've got some caviar coming.
- This is great stuff.

453
00:30:08,091 --> 00:30:09,551
- I'll be right back.
- Look!

454
00:30:09,776 --> 00:30:11,235
That's Stark.

455
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,480
Go, go!

456
00:32:14,108 --> 00:32:15,360
Hang on.

457
00:33:24,345 --> 00:33:26,139
- Give me the case.
- Here. Take it.

458
00:33:26,264 --> 00:33:27,807
- Where's the key?
- It's in my pocket.

459
00:33:27,838 --> 00:33:28,503
Car!

460
00:34:32,747 --> 00:34:34,123
Oh, my God!

461
00:34:40,755 --> 00:34:43,257
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

462
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:46,260
- Were you heading for me or him?
- I was trying to scare him.

463
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:48,446
- 'Cause I can't tell!
- Are you out of your mind?

464
00:34:48,471 --> 00:34:50,390
- Better security.
- Get in the car right now!

465
00:34:50,415 --> 00:34:52,251
I was attacked! We need better security.

466
00:34:52,276 --> 00:34:54,486
- Get in the car!
- You're CEO. Better security measures.

467
00:34:54,607 --> 00:34:56,317
God, it's embarrassing.

468
00:34:57,271 --> 00:34:59,149
First vacation in two years.

469
00:35:04,195 --> 00:35:05,571
Oh, my God!

470
00:35:06,698 --> 00:35:08,907
- I got him!
- Hit him again. Hit him again.

471
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,337
Football.

472
00:35:13,371 --> 00:35:15,373
- I got him!
- Take the case! Take it!

473
00:35:15,498 --> 00:35:17,125
- Take the case!
- Give him the case!

474
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,043
Stop banging the car!

475
00:35:22,213 --> 00:35:23,548
Calm down.

476
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:26,467
God! God!

477
00:35:29,095 --> 00:35:31,806
Give me the case! Please! Come on!

478
00:37:04,232 --> 00:37:05,858
You... You lose.

479
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,826
You lose. You lose, Stark.

480
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:12,050
Pretty decent tech.
Cycles per second were a little low.

481
00:38:17,847 --> 00:38:20,725
You could have doubled up
your rotations.

482
00:38:23,478 --> 00:38:26,189
You focused the repulsor energy
through ionized plasma channels.

483
00:38:26,314 --> 00:38:29,192
It's effective. Not very efficient.

484
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,570
But it's a passable knock-off.

485
00:38:33,428 --> 00:38:36,658
I don't get it. A little fine tuning,
you could have made a solid paycheck.

486
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,849
You could have sold it to
North Korea, China, Iran,

487
00:38:41,037 --> 00:38:43,623
or gone right to the black market.

488
00:38:43,716 --> 00:38:45,983
You look like you got friends
in low places.

489
00:38:46,793 --> 00:38:52,298
You come from a family of
thieves and butchers.

490
00:38:53,716 --> 00:38:59,514
And now, like all guilty men,
you try to rewrite your own history.

491
00:39:00,223 --> 00:39:05,186
And you forget all the lives
the Stark family has destroyed.

492
00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:09,092
Speaking of thieves,
where did you get this design?

493
00:39:09,732 --> 00:39:12,610
My father. Anton Vanko.

494
00:39:13,798 --> 00:39:15,654
Well, I never heard of him.

495
00:39:17,076 --> 00:39:19,745
My father is the reason you're alive.

496
00:39:20,076 --> 00:39:22,998
The reason I'm alive is 'cause
you had a shot, you took it, you missed.

497
00:39:23,725 --> 00:39:24,893
Did I?

498
00:39:27,695 --> 00:39:33,840
If you can make God bleed,
the people will cease to believe in him.

499
00:39:35,216 --> 00:39:39,512
And there will be blood in the water.
And the sharks will come.

500
00:39:41,556 --> 00:39:48,521
The truth, all I have to do is sit here
and watch as the world will consume you.

501
00:39:48,546 --> 00:39:50,790
Where will you be watching
the world consume me from?

502
00:39:50,815 --> 00:39:54,412
That's right. A prison cell.
I'll send you a bar of soap.

503
00:39:54,819 --> 00:40:00,533
Hey, Tony. Before you go, palladium
in the chest, painful way to die.

504
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:19,586
It's just unbelievable.

505
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:21,684
It proves that 
the genie is out of the bottle

506
00:40:21,708 --> 00:40:23,873
and this man has no idea what he's doing.

507
00:40:23,905 --> 00:40:27,617
He thinks of the Iron Man weapon
as a toy.

508
00:40:27,935 --> 00:40:32,832
I was at a hearing
where Mr. Stark, in fact, was adamant

509
00:40:32,857 --> 00:40:36,444
that these suits can't exist anywhere else,

510
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:39,272
don't exist anywhere else,
never will exist anywhere else,

511
00:40:39,297 --> 00:40:40,590
at least for five to 10 years,

512
00:40:40,615 --> 00:40:45,303
and here we are in Monaco realising,
"These suits exist now."

513
00:40:45,328 --> 00:40:46,454
Mute.

514
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:52,043
He should be giving me a medal.
That's the truth.

515
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:59,384
- What is that?
- This is your in-flight meal.

516
00:41:02,428 --> 00:41:04,230
Did you just make that?

517
00:41:04,681 --> 00:41:07,332
Yeah. Where do you think I've been
for three hours?

518
00:41:08,961 --> 00:41:10,087
Tony,

519
00:41:12,438 --> 00:41:14,649
what are you not telling me?

520
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:21,572
I don't want to go home. At all.

521
00:41:23,866 --> 00:41:26,536
Let's cancel my birthday party and...

522
00:41:26,561 --> 00:41:28,821
We're in Europe.
Let's go to Venice, Cipriani.

523
00:41:29,283 --> 00:41:30,598
- Remember?
- Oh, yes.

524
00:41:30,623 --> 00:41:32,458
It's a great place to...

525
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,581
- ...be healthy.
- I don't think this is the right time.

526
00:41:38,158 --> 00:41:40,369
We're in kind of a mess.

527
00:41:40,503 --> 00:41:42,088
Yeah, but maybe that's why
it's the best time.

528
00:41:42,283 --> 00:41:45,439
Well, I think as the CEO, 
I need to show up.

529
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:49,719
As CEO, you are entitled to a leave.

530
00:41:49,913 --> 00:41:51,369
- A leave?
- A company retreat.

531
00:41:51,394 --> 00:41:53,896
- A retreat? During a time like this?
- Just a ride.

532
00:41:53,921 --> 00:41:57,228
Well, I'm just saying, to recharge
our batteries and figure it all out.

533
00:41:57,543 --> 00:41:59,798
Not everybody runs on batteries, Tony.

534
00:44:12,355 --> 00:44:14,571
Hey, there he is.

535
00:44:15,246 --> 00:44:16,664
There he is.

536
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:21,753
What an absolute pleasure. Welcome.

537
00:44:22,879 --> 00:44:23,980
Oh, goodness gracious.

538
00:44:24,005 --> 00:44:26,837
Can we get the handcuffs
off my friend here?

539
00:44:27,734 --> 00:44:31,195
Forgive me, I'm sorry.
I'm such a huge fan of yours.

540
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:35,048
I didn't want to make
a first impression like this.

541
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:37,310
He's not an animal. Come on.

542
00:44:38,269 --> 00:44:39,611
He's a human being.

543
00:44:40,091 --> 00:44:41,053
Thank you.

544
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,275
We're fine.

545
00:44:48,912 --> 00:44:50,580
My name is Justin Hammer.

546
00:44:50,823 --> 00:44:54,118
I'd like to do some business with you.
Please sit.

547
00:44:57,872 --> 00:44:58,505
Dig in.

548
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,915
What do we have today, Jack?

549
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:03,753
- We have some salmon carpaccio.
- Salmon carpaccio.

550
00:45:05,254 --> 00:45:07,148
Anything you want here, we got it.

551
00:45:07,173 --> 00:45:11,219
I like my dessert first.
I had this flown in from San Francisco.

552
00:45:11,344 --> 00:45:12,501
It's Italian, though.

553
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,892
Organic ice cream.

554
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:19,173
I got a sweet tooth.
Apparently you do, too, for Tony Stark.

555
00:45:20,957 --> 00:45:23,873
What I saw you do to Tony Stark
on that track,

556
00:45:23,898 --> 00:45:27,527
how you stepped up to him
in front of God and everybody,

557
00:45:27,552 --> 00:45:29,737
that was... Wow!

558
00:45:29,862 --> 00:45:31,364
You spoke to me with what you did.

559
00:45:31,389 --> 00:45:34,001
And I know that you knew
that I'd be listening.

560
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,819
This is why I couldn't bear
to have you shipped off

561
00:45:35,827 --> 00:45:38,579
to God knows where. It would have been
such a waste of talent.

562
00:45:38,665 --> 00:45:40,098
But if I might make a suggestion,

563
00:45:40,123 --> 00:45:42,792
you know,
you don't just go and try and kill the guy.

564
00:45:42,917 --> 00:45:47,230
I think, if I may, you go after his legacy.

565
00:45:47,255 --> 00:45:48,782
That's what you kill.

566
00:45:49,424 --> 00:45:51,970
You and me,
we are a lot alike in a lot of ways.

567
00:45:52,377 --> 00:45:57,204
The only difference between you and I
is that I have resources.

568
00:45:57,974 --> 00:46:02,595
I think, if I may,
you need my resources.

569
00:46:02,795 --> 00:46:05,340
Someone behind you, a benefactor.

570
00:46:05,565 --> 00:46:07,368
I'd like to be that guy.

571
00:46:19,474 --> 00:46:23,728
Okay. Do you speak English?
Because I can get a translator.

572
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:26,759
I don't know. Have you been
understanding everything I'm saying?

573
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,160
Very good, man.

574
00:46:28,338 --> 00:46:30,040
- Very good, man.
- Very good, man.

575
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:32,581
Hey!

576
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,134
Hey.

577
00:46:35,637 --> 00:46:36,487
Yes?

578
00:46:36,512 --> 00:46:37,907
I want my bird.

579
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:43,728
- A bird? You want a bird?
- I want my bird.

580
00:46:43,853 --> 00:46:45,306
I can get you a bird.
I can get you 10 birds.

581
00:46:45,605 --> 00:46:47,106
I want my bird.

582
00:46:47,192 --> 00:46:49,695
Well, okay.
Nothing's impossible. I could...

583
00:46:49,804 --> 00:46:53,433
Are we talking about...
Is this a bird back in Russia?

584
00:46:53,558 --> 00:46:56,561
Yes, but the fundamentals of
the company are still very, very strong

585
00:46:56,586 --> 00:46:58,718
- despite the events in Monaco.
- Yes, of course.

586
00:46:58,743 --> 00:47:02,163
- The AP wants a quote.
- Don't tell him. Fax them...

587
00:47:02,188 --> 00:47:03,648
Where is he?

588
00:47:03,795 --> 00:47:06,040
- He doesn't want to be disturbed.
- He's downstairs.

589
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:07,160
Yes, but...

590
00:47:07,193 --> 00:47:11,965
{\an8}But his continuing erratic behavior
may lead many people to ask themselves,

591
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:13,883
{\an8}"Can this man still protect us?"

592
00:47:14,008 --> 00:47:17,261
Iron Man never stopped protecting us.
The events in Monaco proved that.

593
00:47:18,596 --> 00:47:20,388
Query complete, sir.

594
00:47:20,689 --> 00:47:26,020
Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist
who defected to the United States in 1963.

595
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:30,328
However, he was accused of espionage
and was deported in 1967.

596
00:47:30,353 --> 00:47:32,835
His son, lvan, who is also a physicist,

597
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:37,573
was convicted of selling Soviet-era
weapons-grade plutonium to Pakistan,

598
00:47:37,598 --> 00:47:39,919
and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison.

599
00:47:40,222 --> 00:47:42,146
No further records exist.

600
00:47:46,958 --> 00:47:50,878
Tony, you gotta get upstairs and
get on top of this situation right now.

601
00:47:51,004 --> 00:47:55,316
Listen. I've been on the phone
with the National Guard all day,

602
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:58,253
trying to talk them out of
rolling tanks up the PCH,

603
00:47:58,261 --> 00:48:01,097
knocking down your front door
and taking these.

604
00:48:01,122 --> 00:48:05,099
They're gonna take your suits, Tony, okay?
They're sick of the games.

605
00:48:05,372 --> 00:48:08,599
You said nobody else would possess
this technology for 20 years.

606
00:48:08,624 --> 00:48:11,916
Well, guess what?
Somebody else had it yesterday.

607
00:48:11,941 --> 00:48:14,021
It's not theoretical any more.

608
00:48:15,486 --> 00:48:17,271
Are you listening to me?

609
00:48:19,657 --> 00:48:20,786
Are you okay?

610
00:48:22,228 --> 00:48:22,908
Let's go.

611
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:28,166
Hey, man. Hey, hey!

612
00:48:30,496 --> 00:48:33,021
- You all right?
- Yeah, I should get to my desk.

613
00:48:34,005 --> 00:48:35,716
- See that cigar box?
- Yeah.

614
00:48:36,507 --> 00:48:37,958
It's palladium.

615
00:48:45,141 --> 00:48:46,659
Is that supposed to be smoking?

616
00:48:46,684 --> 00:48:50,513
If you must know, it's neutron damage.
It's from the reactor wall.

617
00:48:54,496 --> 00:48:56,396
You had this in your body?

618
00:49:01,658 --> 00:49:04,591
And how about the high-tech
crossword puzzle on your neck?

619
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:06,725
Road rash.

620
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:11,365
Thank you.

621
00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:25,747
- What are you looking at?
- I'm looking at you.

622
00:49:26,601 --> 00:49:30,601
You wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act
and it's unnecessary.

623
00:49:30,626 --> 00:49:31,966
You don't have to do this alone.

624
00:49:31,991 --> 00:49:36,201
You know, I wish I could believe that.
I really do. But you've gotta trust me.

625
00:49:36,564 --> 00:49:39,591
Contrary to popular belief,
I know exactly what I'm doing.

626
00:49:49,205 --> 00:49:51,457
This is where we do it.
This is my humble abode.

627
00:49:51,582 --> 00:49:55,003
You can work in absolute peace.
Must be fun to be dead, right?

628
00:49:55,128 --> 00:49:56,240
No pressure.

629
00:49:56,629 --> 00:49:59,590
Here they are. I'm very excited.
They're combat-ready.

630
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:03,212
I may have done a few miscalculations
and rushed the prototype into production.

631
00:50:03,237 --> 00:50:05,072
Sue me, I'm enthusiastic.

632
00:50:05,305 --> 00:50:07,076
Go ahead, take a look around.

633
00:50:12,395 --> 00:50:14,272
You don't wanna do that.

634
00:50:14,397 --> 00:50:17,984
You'll be able to access that as soon as
we generate some encrypted pass codes.

635
00:50:18,062 --> 00:50:20,106
Can we generate
some encrypted pass codes?

636
00:50:20,131 --> 00:50:23,138
Get some of
those encrypted pass codes, Jack.

637
00:50:24,574 --> 00:50:25,982
Never mind, I...

638
00:50:27,493 --> 00:50:30,747
Wow. Okay. Good stuff.

639
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,216
Sorry?

640
00:50:34,416 --> 00:50:35,543
Software shit.

641
00:50:37,758 --> 00:50:38,968
Well...

642
00:50:40,344 --> 00:50:41,762
You're good.

643
00:50:42,258 --> 00:50:45,386
You really blasted in
past the firewall there.

644
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:49,515
Let me show you where
you're gonna be working primarily.

645
00:50:49,641 --> 00:50:51,232
Go ahead, take a look.

646
00:50:52,461 --> 00:50:55,047
Get a good look at that.
That's something, isn't it?

647
00:50:55,188 --> 00:50:57,148
You know,
those are really just for show and tell.

648
00:50:57,173 --> 00:51:00,279
They're $125.7 million a pop, so...

649
00:51:00,304 --> 00:51:02,063
Wait! Oh, gosh.

650
00:51:04,364 --> 00:51:07,200
Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here.

651
00:51:08,117 --> 00:51:10,232
That's where the pilot goes.

652
00:51:10,779 --> 00:51:14,783
I'm having a tough time finding volunteers.

653
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,912
I'll take care of that, just leave it.

654
00:51:18,169 --> 00:51:19,629
What you want them do?

655
00:51:19,707 --> 00:51:24,560
Well, long term, I want them to put me
in the Pentagon for the next 25 years.

656
00:51:25,027 --> 00:51:27,029
I want to make Iron Man
look like an antique.

657
00:51:27,178 --> 00:51:30,264
I wanna go to that Stark Expo,
I wanna take a dump in Tony's front yard.

658
00:51:30,289 --> 00:51:31,693
You know what I'm talking about?

659
00:51:31,891 --> 00:51:34,018
- I can do that. No problem.
- Yeah?

660
00:51:34,043 --> 00:51:36,287
Hey, fabulous! I love it.

661
00:51:36,312 --> 00:51:39,271
Hey, this is our guy. Didn't I tell you?
I had a feeling.

662
00:51:48,658 --> 00:51:51,077
Do you know which watch
you'd like to wear tonight, Mr. Stark?

663
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:52,818
I'll give them a look.

664
00:51:56,332 --> 00:51:57,750
I should cancel the party.

665
00:51:58,876 --> 00:52:00,086
- Probably.
- Yeah.

666
00:52:00,211 --> 00:52:01,560
'Cause it's...

667
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:02,812
Ill-timed.

668
00:52:02,837 --> 00:52:04,297
Right, sends the wrong message.

669
00:52:04,405 --> 00:52:05,865
Inappropriate.

670
00:52:11,785 --> 00:52:13,792
Is that dirty enough for you?

671
00:52:15,101 --> 00:52:18,855
Gold face, brown band.
The Jaeger. I'll give that a look.

672
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:20,721
Bring them over here.

673
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:26,237
I'll take that. Why don't you...

674
00:52:38,374 --> 00:52:40,668
I gotta say it.
It's hard to get a read on you.

675
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,109
Where are you from?

676
00:52:42,134 --> 00:52:43,130
Legal.

677
00:52:45,882 --> 00:52:47,722
Can I ask you a question, hypothetically?

678
00:52:48,092 --> 00:52:49,344
Bit odd.

679
00:52:49,677 --> 00:52:53,014
If this was your last birthday party
you were ever gonna have,

680
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:54,682
how would you celebrate it?

681
00:52:57,393 --> 00:53:01,522
I'd do whatever I wanted to do
with whoever I wanted to do it with.

682
00:53:32,178 --> 00:53:34,347
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

683
00:53:35,306 --> 00:53:37,225
Yes, sir, I understand.

684
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:41,562
No. No, sir, that will not be necessary.
I'll handle it.

685
00:53:41,597 --> 00:53:45,896
Sir, I personally guarantee that within
24 hours, Iron Man will be back on watch.

686
00:53:53,241 --> 00:53:54,659
Hey, Pepper.

687
00:53:55,034 --> 00:53:57,120
I'm going to go get some air.

688
00:53:57,245 --> 00:53:58,579
What's wrong?

689
00:53:59,414 --> 00:54:01,666
- I don't know what to do.
- You gotta be kidding me.

690
00:54:07,922 --> 00:54:10,508
- That's it. I'm making... Pepper.
- No, no, no. Don't call anyone.

691
00:54:10,533 --> 00:54:12,510
This is ridiculous.
I just stuck my neck out for this guy.

692
00:54:12,535 --> 00:54:15,179
I know. I know. I get it. I'm gonna
handle it, okay? Just let me handle it.

693
00:54:15,204 --> 00:54:18,081
Handle it. Or I'm gonna have to.

694
00:54:19,434 --> 00:54:21,060
You know, the question
I get asked most often is,

695
00:54:21,085 --> 00:54:23,646
"Tony, how do you go to the bathroom
in the suit?"

696
00:54:27,066 --> 00:54:28,379
Just like that.

697
00:54:32,155 --> 00:54:35,033
Does this guy know
how to throw a party or what?

698
00:54:38,786 --> 00:54:39,787
I love you.

699
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:42,640
Unbelievable! Thank you so much.

700
00:54:42,665 --> 00:54:46,686
Tony, we all thank you so much
for such a wonderful night.

701
00:54:46,711 --> 00:54:50,673
And we're gonna say good night now,
and thank you all for coming.

702
00:54:50,698 --> 00:54:52,066
No, no, no, we can't... Wait, wait, wait.

703
00:54:52,091 --> 00:54:53,843
We didn't have the cake.
We didn't blow out the candles.

704
00:54:53,868 --> 00:54:56,721
You're out of control, okay?
Trust me on this one, okay?

705
00:54:56,852 --> 00:54:59,146
- You're out of control, gorgeous.
- It's time to go to bed. It's time.

706
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:00,450
- Give me another smooch.
- You're not going to be

707
00:55:00,475 --> 00:55:01,738
- Come on, you know you want to.
- happy about this.

708
00:55:01,768 --> 00:55:03,102
You just peed the suit.

709
00:55:03,127 --> 00:55:04,746
- I know. It has a filtration system.
- It's not sexy.

710
00:55:04,771 --> 00:55:06,147
You could drink that water.

711
00:55:06,648 --> 00:55:09,691
Just send everybody home, okay?
It's time to...

712
00:55:09,942 --> 00:55:11,653
- lf you say so.
- Okay.

713
00:55:11,778 --> 00:55:13,905
I'll take this, you take that.

714
00:55:15,365 --> 00:55:16,950
Pepper Potts.

715
00:55:18,284 --> 00:55:19,786
She's right. The party's over.

716
00:55:19,811 --> 00:55:22,931
Then again, the party was over for me,
like, an hour and a half ago.

717
00:55:22,956 --> 00:55:26,417
The after-party starts in 15 minutes.

718
00:55:30,046 --> 00:55:34,175
And if anybody, Pepper,
doesn't like it, there's the door.

719
00:55:40,682 --> 00:55:42,016
Yeah!

720
00:55:46,437 --> 00:55:47,647
Hit!

721
00:55:54,862 --> 00:55:56,030
Pull!

722
00:56:05,331 --> 00:56:06,499
Pull!

723
00:56:15,508 --> 00:56:17,677
I think she wants the Gallagher!

724
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,554
I'm only gonna say this once.

725
00:56:32,483 --> 00:56:33,374
Get out.

726
00:56:40,325 --> 00:56:43,369
You don't deserve to wear one of these.
Shut it down!

727
00:56:45,038 --> 00:56:46,164
Goldstein.

728
00:56:47,386 --> 00:56:48,554
Yes, Mr. Stark?

729
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:51,961
Give me a phat beat to
beat my buddy's ass to.

730
00:56:55,798 --> 00:56:57,759
I told you to shut it down.

731
00:57:08,311 --> 00:57:11,856
Now, put that thing back where
you found it before someone gets hurt.

732
00:57:18,613 --> 00:57:19,864
Really?

733
00:57:27,664 --> 00:57:31,209
Sorry, pal,
but Iron Man doesn't have a sidekick.

734
00:57:31,834 --> 00:57:34,045
Sidekick this!

735
00:57:42,595 --> 00:57:44,055
Had enough?

736
00:57:45,014 --> 00:57:46,432
- Natalie!
- Miss Potts.

737
00:57:46,557 --> 00:57:50,228
Don't you "Miss Potts" me! I'm on to you.
You know what? Ever since you came here-

738
00:57:54,524 --> 00:57:55,525
Pepper!

739
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:58,403
Get out of here. Get out of here.

740
00:58:04,701 --> 00:58:07,412
You want it? Take it!

741
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,871
Put your hand down.

742
00:58:49,965 --> 00:58:52,134
You think you got what it takes
to wear that suit?

743
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:53,708
We don't have to do this, Tony.

744
00:58:53,733 --> 00:58:55,602
You wanna be the War Machine,
take your shot.

745
00:58:55,627 --> 00:58:57,420
- Put it down!
- You gonna take a shot?

746
00:58:57,445 --> 00:58:58,755
- Put it down!
- No!

747
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:00,298
- Drop it, Tony!
- Take it.

748
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,846
Edwards Tower, this is
Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes,

749
01:00:13,871 --> 01:00:17,041
inbound from three miles east
at 5,000 feet...

750
01:01:01,502 --> 01:01:02,795
Colonel.

751
01:01:03,796 --> 01:01:05,006
Major.

752
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:06,883
Wow.

753
01:01:08,134 --> 01:01:09,385
Yeah.

754
01:01:11,262 --> 01:01:12,945
Let's take it inside.

755
01:01:13,264 --> 01:01:14,724
Clear the area.

756
01:01:37,497 --> 01:01:41,209
Sir! I'm gonna have to ask you to
exit the doughnut.

757
01:01:45,296 --> 01:01:47,423
I told you I don't wanna join
your super-secret boy band.

758
01:01:48,341 --> 01:01:51,970
No, no, no. See, I remember,
you do everything yourself.

759
01:01:52,095 --> 01:01:53,410
How's that working out for you?

760
01:01:53,434 --> 01:01:55,226
It's... It's... It's...

761
01:01:56,808 --> 01:01:58,201
I'm sorry.
I don't wanna get off on the wrong foot.

762
01:01:58,226 --> 01:01:59,978
Do I look at the patch or the eye?

763
01:02:01,145 --> 01:02:04,607
Honestly, I'm a bit hung over. I'm not sure
if you're real or if I'm having...

764
01:02:04,732 --> 01:02:06,776
I am very real.

765
01:02:06,801 --> 01:02:08,882
I'm the realest person
you're ever gonna meet.

766
01:02:09,412 --> 01:02:11,074
Just my luck. Where's the staff here?

767
01:02:11,098 --> 01:02:12,623
That's not looking so good.

768
01:02:13,408 --> 01:02:15,368
I've been worse.

769
01:02:16,945 --> 01:02:18,257
We've secured the perimeter,

770
01:02:18,282 --> 01:02:20,546
but I don't think 
we should hold it for too much longer.

771
01:02:24,669 --> 01:02:26,374
You're fired.

772
01:02:26,668 --> 01:02:27,781
That's not up to you.

773
01:02:28,214 --> 01:02:31,484
- Tony, I want you to meet Agent Romanoff.
- Hi.

774
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:32,938
I'm a S.H.I.E.L.D. shadow.

775
01:02:32,961 --> 01:02:35,420
Once we knew you were ill,
I was tasked to you by Director Fury.

776
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:37,054
I suggest you apologize.

777
01:02:37,348 --> 01:02:38,850
You've been very busy.

778
01:02:38,875 --> 01:02:42,287
You made your girl your CEO,
you're giving away all your stuff.

779
01:02:42,312 --> 01:02:45,273
You let your friend
fly away with your suit.

780
01:02:45,298 --> 01:02:46,833
Now, if I didn't know better...

781
01:02:46,858 --> 01:02:48,918
You don't know better.
I didn't give it to him. He took it.

782
01:02:48,943 --> 01:02:51,571
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it?

783
01:02:51,696 --> 01:02:54,866
You're Iron Man and he just took it?

784
01:02:54,991 --> 01:02:57,944
The little brother walked in there,
kicked your ass and took your suit?

785
01:02:57,969 --> 01:02:59,137
Is that possible?

786
01:02:59,162 --> 01:03:01,848
Well, according to Mr. Stark's
database security guidelines,

787
01:03:01,873 --> 01:03:04,834
there are redundancies
to prevent unauthorized usage.

788
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:10,256
- What do you want from me?
- What do we want from you?

789
01:03:10,381 --> 01:03:12,216
What do you want from me?

790
01:03:12,342 --> 01:03:16,070
You have become a problem,
a problem I have to deal with.

791
01:03:16,095 --> 01:03:19,307
Contrary to your belief,
you are not the centre of my universe.

792
01:03:19,455 --> 01:03:22,458
I have bigger problems than you
in the southwest region to deal with.

793
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:23,561
Hit him.

794
01:03:24,812 --> 01:03:28,107
Oh, God, are you gonna
steal my kidney and sell it?

795
01:03:28,608 --> 01:03:31,486
Could you please not do anything awful
for five seconds?

796
01:03:32,111 --> 01:03:33,511
What did she just do to me?

797
01:03:33,535 --> 01:03:35,663
What did we just do for you?

798
01:03:35,823 --> 01:03:38,301
That's lithium dioxide.
It's gonna take the edge off.

799
01:03:38,326 --> 01:03:40,161
We're trying to get you back to work.

800
01:03:40,286 --> 01:03:42,330
Give me a couple of boxes of that.
I'll be right as rain.

801
01:03:42,355 --> 01:03:44,232
It's not a cure,
it just abates the symptoms.

802
01:03:44,457 --> 01:03:46,749
Doesn't look like it's gonna be
an easy fix.

803
01:03:47,043 --> 01:03:49,212
Trust me, I know. I'm good at this stuff.

804
01:03:49,337 --> 01:03:51,673
I've been looking for
a suitable replacement for palladium.

805
01:03:51,698 --> 01:03:56,077
I've tried every combination,
every permutation of every known element.

806
01:03:56,254 --> 01:03:59,299
Well, I'm here to tell you,
you haven't tried them all.

807
01:04:00,848 --> 01:04:03,781
Hey, hey, hey. Special delivery.

808
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:05,561
Candygram.

809
01:04:09,816 --> 01:04:11,234
I brought you something.

810
01:04:11,859 --> 01:04:13,569
Oh, yeah.

811
01:04:16,155 --> 01:04:17,949
We got you the bird, pal.

812
01:04:18,074 --> 01:04:19,367
This is not my bird.

813
01:04:19,826 --> 01:04:21,869
What do you mean?
That's the bird. This is the bird.

814
01:04:21,995 --> 01:04:24,747
Yeah. Pulled a lot of strings
to get this bird.

815
01:04:24,872 --> 01:04:26,224
This is a great bird.

816
01:04:26,249 --> 01:04:28,835
- It's a beautiful bird.
- We got this all the way from Russia.

817
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,379
Hey, man, this not my bird.

818
01:04:33,756 --> 01:04:37,635
Well, listen, even if it's not the bird,
I mean, this is a gorgeous bird.

819
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:40,555
I mean, you know, look,
don't get so attached to things.

820
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:42,249
Learn to let go.

821
01:04:45,101 --> 01:04:47,562
Wait a minute. Jack, what is that?

822
01:04:48,146 --> 01:04:48,895
Is that...

823
01:04:48,919 --> 01:04:51,232
That's not a helmet. What is that?

824
01:04:59,782 --> 01:05:03,286
lvan... What's this? Jack.

825
01:05:04,287 --> 01:05:06,289
Is that a helmet?
It doesn't look like a helmet to me.

826
01:05:06,414 --> 01:05:08,958
How... How are you supposed
to get a head in there?

827
01:05:09,083 --> 01:05:10,877
- Jack, could you put your head in there?
- No.

828
01:05:11,002 --> 01:05:14,172
Try to put your head in there.
Go ahead. Try to put your head in there.

829
01:05:14,297 --> 01:05:16,924
See, lvan? He can't put his head in there.
That's...

830
01:05:16,949 --> 01:05:21,487
That's not a helmet. It's a head.
I need to put a guy in there.

831
01:05:21,512 --> 01:05:24,849
I need to fit a person in that suit.
You understand?

832
01:05:25,224 --> 01:05:27,310
- Drone better.
- What? Drone better?

833
01:05:27,335 --> 01:05:29,879
Why is drone better?
Why is drone better?

834
01:05:30,104 --> 01:05:33,816
People make problem.
Trust me. Drone better.

835
01:05:34,317 --> 01:05:38,446
Ivan, you know, I like you.
I got you the bird.

836
01:05:39,364 --> 01:05:41,157
You said, "No problem."

837
01:05:41,282 --> 01:05:44,160
That's what you said to me.
You said, "No problem."

838
01:05:44,285 --> 01:05:47,138
Now I need suits.
The government wants suits.

839
01:05:47,163 --> 01:05:49,223
Like Iron Man. You understand?

840
01:05:49,248 --> 01:05:52,335
That's what the people want.
That's what's gonna make them happy.

841
01:05:53,211 --> 01:05:54,504
Hey, man.

842
01:05:56,089 --> 01:05:58,633
Don't get too attached to things.

843
01:05:59,384 --> 01:06:01,052
Learn to let go.

844
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:07,134
These drones better steal the show, lvan.

845
01:06:07,809 --> 01:06:11,187
You understand?
Better rock my world, lvan.

846
01:06:20,822 --> 01:06:22,448
Unbelievable.

847
01:06:22,949 --> 01:06:25,576
This ought to get the Senate off my ass.

848
01:06:25,702 --> 01:06:27,191
It's functional?

849
01:06:27,594 --> 01:06:29,038
Fully mission-capable.

850
01:06:29,455 --> 01:06:32,792
Good. Get Hammer down here
to weaponize it.

851
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:34,870
Sir?

852
01:06:34,895 --> 01:06:37,481
Justin Hammer's making
a weapons presentation at the Expo.

853
01:06:37,506 --> 01:06:39,269
We'd like this to introduce it.

854
01:06:39,294 --> 01:06:40,964
Sir, I don't believe that the Expo-

855
01:06:40,989 --> 01:06:43,742
Colonel, the world needs to see this fast.

856
01:06:43,928 --> 01:06:45,706
We've got to make this happen.

857
01:06:45,731 --> 01:06:47,031
Yes, General, but-

858
01:06:47,056 --> 01:06:49,017
It's also an order.

859
01:06:49,434 --> 01:06:50,727
Yes, sir.

860
01:06:51,122 --> 01:06:54,450
Good work, Colonel.
You've made your country proud.

861
01:06:54,689 --> 01:06:56,274
Thank you, sir.

862
01:07:02,402 --> 01:07:06,073
That thing in your chest is based on
unfinished technology.

863
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:07,385
No, it was finished.

864
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:11,598
It has never been particularly effective
until I miniaturized it and put it in my...

865
01:07:11,611 --> 01:07:15,661
No. Howard said the arc reactor was
the stepping stone to something greater.

866
01:07:15,668 --> 01:07:20,131
He was about to kick off an energy race
that was gonna dwarf the arms race.

867
01:07:20,673 --> 01:07:21,858
He was on to something big,

868
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:25,472
something so big that it was
gonna make the nuclear reactor

869
01:07:25,497 --> 01:07:27,488
look like a triple-A battery.

870
01:07:27,513 --> 01:07:30,074
Just him,
or was Anton Vanko in on this, too?

871
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:33,239
Anton Vanko is
the other side of that coin.

872
01:07:33,269 --> 01:07:35,271
Anton saw it as a way to get rich.

873
01:07:35,296 --> 01:07:37,832
When your father found out,
he had him deported.

874
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:39,833
When the Russians found out 
he couldn't deliver,

875
01:07:39,857 --> 01:07:41,461
they shipped his ass off to Siberia

876
01:07:41,486 --> 01:07:44,197
and he spent the next 20 years
in a vodka-fuelled rage.

877
01:07:44,222 --> 01:07:46,925
Not quite the environment
you want to raise a kid in,

878
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:51,037
the son you had the misfortune
of crossing paths with in Monaco.

879
01:07:51,454 --> 01:07:52,847
You told me I hadn't tried everything.

880
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:55,158
What do you mean I haven't tried
everything? What haven't I tried?

881
01:07:55,166 --> 01:07:59,520
He said that you were the only person
with the means and knowledge

882
01:07:59,545 --> 01:08:01,506
to finish what he started.

883
01:08:01,631 --> 01:08:03,091
He said that?

884
01:08:03,299 --> 01:08:05,885
Are you that guy? Are you?

885
01:08:05,963 --> 01:08:11,218
'Cause if you are, then you can solve
the riddle of your heart.

886
01:08:15,603 --> 01:08:19,357
I don't know where you get your
information, but he wasn't my biggest fan.

887
01:08:19,387 --> 01:08:20,934
What do you remember about your dad?

888
01:08:20,942 --> 01:08:22,710
He was cold, he was calculating.

889
01:08:22,735 --> 01:08:25,546
He never told me he loved me.
He never even told me he liked me,

890
01:08:25,571 --> 01:08:27,215
so it's a little tough for me to digest

891
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,659
when you're telling me he said
the whole future was riding on me

892
01:08:29,684 --> 01:08:32,660
and he's passing it down.
I don't get that.

893
01:08:32,685 --> 01:08:34,149
You're talking about a guy 
whose happiest day

894
01:08:34,173 --> 01:08:35,798
was when he shipped me off 
to boarding school.

895
01:08:35,801 --> 01:08:36,791
That's not true.

896
01:08:36,816 --> 01:08:39,544
Well, then, clearly you knew my dad
better than I did.

897
01:08:40,003 --> 01:08:43,731
As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of
the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D.

898
01:08:43,756 --> 01:08:44,882
What?

899
01:08:45,466 --> 01:08:47,510
- I got a 2:00.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

900
01:08:47,535 --> 01:08:49,137
- What's this?
- Okay, you're good, right?

901
01:08:49,162 --> 01:08:50,972
- No, I'm not good.
- You got this? Right? Right?

902
01:08:50,997 --> 01:08:53,032
Got what? I don't even know
what I'm supposed to get.

903
01:08:53,057 --> 01:08:56,269
Natasha will remain a floater at Stark
with her cover intact.

904
01:08:56,294 --> 01:08:59,272
- You remember Agent Coulson, right?
- Yeah.

905
01:08:59,731 --> 01:09:01,190
And Tony,

906
01:09:02,442 --> 01:09:05,445
remember, I got my eye on you.

907
01:09:11,534 --> 01:09:14,746
We've disabled all communications.
No contact with the outside world.

908
01:09:14,871 --> 01:09:16,205
Good luck.

909
01:09:20,335 --> 01:09:21,544
Please.

910
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:25,340
First thing, I need a little bodywork.
I'll put in a little time at the lab.

911
01:09:25,453 --> 01:09:27,692
If we could send one of your goon squad
down to The Coffee Bean,

912
01:09:27,717 --> 01:09:30,261
Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run,
or something like that, that'd be nice.

913
01:09:30,286 --> 01:09:31,571
I'm not here for that.

914
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:34,025
I've been authorized by Director Fury 
to use any means necessary

915
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:35,658
to keep you on premises.

916
01:09:35,683 --> 01:09:38,369
If you attempt to leave
or play any games,

917
01:09:38,394 --> 01:09:41,564
I will tase you and watch Supernanny
while you drool into the carpet.

918
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:43,805
- Okay?
- I think I got it, yeah.

919
01:09:43,931 --> 01:09:45,766
Enjoy your evening's entertainment.

920
01:10:12,261 --> 01:10:13,947
Think this is the power source?

921
01:10:13,972 --> 01:10:18,726
Major, this is not a scientific exercise.
Let's just focus on arming it, all right?

922
01:10:19,894 --> 01:10:21,187
Yes, sir.

923
01:10:21,646 --> 01:10:22,897
Oh, yes!

924
01:10:23,356 --> 01:10:25,233
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

925
01:10:25,358 --> 01:10:27,068
Is it my birthday?

926
01:10:27,402 --> 01:10:30,780
You got it.
What did you do? What did you do?

927
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:36,744
- Is this what I think it is?
- Yes, it is.

928
01:10:36,869 --> 01:10:39,914
Hammer, I want to know
what you're gonna do for us.

929
01:10:40,123 --> 01:10:41,582
What am I going to do for you?

930
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:44,711
Well, the first thing I'm gonna do for you
is I'm gonna upgrade your software.

931
01:10:44,836 --> 01:10:47,497
- And then, second, I think I should...
- That's not what I'm talking about.

932
01:10:47,804 --> 01:10:49,677
I'm talking about firepower.

933
01:10:51,759 --> 01:10:53,803
Well, you're talking to the right guy.

934
01:10:55,138 --> 01:10:58,391
Claridge Hi-Tec,
semi-automatic, 9mm pistol.

935
01:10:59,726 --> 01:11:02,020
Too downtown? I agree.

936
01:11:02,603 --> 01:11:04,814
M24 shotgun, pump action.

937
01:11:05,481 --> 01:11:06,733
Five-round magazine.

938
01:11:06,858 --> 01:11:08,251
You know what? You're not a hunter.

939
01:11:08,276 --> 01:11:10,320
What am I talking about?
I'm getting rid of it.

940
01:11:10,445 --> 01:11:12,864
This is the FN-2000 from Belgium.

941
01:11:12,989 --> 01:11:14,896
They do make something
better than waffles.

942
01:11:16,117 --> 01:11:18,202
It's beautiful, but I can tell
this isn't disco enough for you,

943
01:11:18,227 --> 01:11:19,478
so I'm gonna put it right here.

944
01:11:19,704 --> 01:11:22,474
You're looking at
a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher.

945
01:11:22,832 --> 01:11:25,835
Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control.

946
01:11:26,213 --> 01:11:27,396
You're tough.

947
01:11:27,421 --> 01:11:29,882
Let me tell you something.
Size does matter.

948
01:11:30,131 --> 01:11:31,591
Don't let anyone tell you different.

949
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:35,303
This is an M1347.62 Minigun.

950
01:11:35,328 --> 01:11:38,748
Six individual barrels.
The torso taker, powder maker.

951
01:11:38,973 --> 01:11:43,403
Our boys in uniform call it Uncle Gazpacho,
or Puff the Magic Dragon.

952
01:11:46,564 --> 01:11:47,607
Okay.

953
01:11:49,567 --> 01:11:53,321
These are the Cubans, baby.
This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos.

954
01:11:55,039 --> 01:11:57,008
This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle

955
01:11:57,033 --> 01:12:01,287
with a secondary
cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine RDX burst.

956
01:12:01,913 --> 01:12:05,375
It's capable of busting the bunker
under the bunker you just busted.

957
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,627
If it were any smarter,
it would write a book.

958
01:12:07,752 --> 01:12:11,130
A book that would make Ulysses
look like it was written in crayon.

959
01:12:11,756 --> 01:12:13,549
It would read it to you.

960
01:12:13,574 --> 01:12:15,234
This is my Eiffel Tower.

961
01:12:15,259 --> 01:12:18,304
This is my Rachmaninoff's Third.
My Pieta.

962
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:21,574
It's completely elegant.
It's bafflingly beautiful.

963
01:12:21,599 --> 01:12:26,271
It's capable of reducing the population
of any standing structure to zero.

964
01:12:27,397 --> 01:12:29,274
I call it the Ex-Wife.

965
01:12:34,445 --> 01:12:36,322
That's the best I got.

966
01:12:41,452 --> 01:12:43,179
Are we gonna do this?
Give me something here.

967
01:12:43,204 --> 01:12:45,813
You're like a sphinx. I can't read you.

968
01:12:46,138 --> 01:12:47,433
I think I'll take it.

969
01:12:47,458 --> 01:12:48,523
Which one?

970
01:12:49,074 --> 01:12:50,155
All of it.

971
01:12:52,088 --> 01:12:53,089
All of it.

972
01:13:30,543 --> 01:13:34,297
Everything is achievable
through technology.

973
01:13:34,422 --> 01:13:36,899
Better living, robust health

974
01:13:36,924 --> 01:13:42,722
and for the first time in human history,
the possibility of world peace.

975
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:44,550
I'm Howard Stark,

976
01:13:44,557 --> 01:13:48,561
and everything you'll need for the future
can be found right here.

977
01:13:48,686 --> 01:13:51,648
City of the Future?
City of Tomorrow? City of...

978
01:13:57,528 --> 01:13:58,755
I'm Howard Stark,

979
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:02,617
and everything you'll need in the future
can be found right here.

980
01:14:02,742 --> 01:14:07,956
So, from all of us at Stark Industries,
I would like to personally...

981
01:14:08,623 --> 01:14:10,833
Tony, what are you doing back there?
What is that?

982
01:14:10,959 --> 01:14:14,208
Put that back.
Put it back where you got it from.

983
01:14:14,754 --> 01:14:15,720
Where's your mother?

984
01:14:15,744 --> 01:14:16,881
Maria?

985
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:19,217
Go on. Go, go, go, go.

986
01:14:21,552 --> 01:14:23,466
All right, I think we got...

987
01:14:24,138 --> 01:14:25,890
I'll... I'll... I'll come in and...

988
01:14:29,852 --> 01:14:31,729
Are you waiting on me?

989
01:14:33,571 --> 01:14:38,159
So, from all of us at Stark Industries,
I'd like to personally show you...

990
01:14:38,987 --> 01:14:39,988
...my ass.

991
01:14:40,013 --> 01:14:42,056
I'd like to... I can't... This is...

992
01:14:42,282 --> 01:14:44,617
I can't... We have this, don't we?

993
01:14:44,742 --> 01:14:46,904
This is a ridiculous way...

994
01:14:48,052 --> 01:14:49,512
Everything...

995
01:14:50,665 --> 01:14:52,125
...is achievable...

996
01:14:52,917 --> 01:14:54,752
...through technology.

997
01:15:07,257 --> 01:15:08,076
Tony?

998
01:15:08,515 --> 01:15:10,581
You're too young 
to understand this right now,

999
01:15:10,594 --> 01:15:13,101
so I thought 
I would put it on film for you.

1000
01:15:15,229 --> 01:15:17,064
I built this for you.

1001
01:15:18,151 --> 01:15:20,837
And someday you'll realize
that it represents a whole lot more

1002
01:15:20,862 --> 01:15:24,782
than just people's inventions.
It represents my life's work.

1003
01:15:26,034 --> 01:15:28,328
This is the key to the future.

1004
01:15:31,289 --> 01:15:36,044
I'm limited by the technology of my time,
but one day you'll figure this out.

1005
01:15:36,912 --> 01:15:41,588
And when you do,
you will change the world.

1006
01:15:43,134 --> 01:15:47,055
What is and always will be
my greatest creation...

1007
01:15:49,424 --> 01:15:50,758
...is you.

1008
01:16:11,829 --> 01:16:14,582
- $6. Six.
- I don't have any dough.

1009
01:16:14,707 --> 01:16:16,250
- Here.
- No, sir, that's too much.

1010
01:16:16,275 --> 01:16:17,442
No, it's fine. Take that.

1011
01:16:17,606 --> 01:16:19,566
- It's fine.
- No, senor.

1012
01:16:19,921 --> 01:16:22,840
Take it. Take it.
I don't like people handing me things.

1013
01:16:22,966 --> 01:16:24,607
If you just drop that there,
that'd be great.

1014
01:16:25,218 --> 01:16:27,804
- Are you Iron Man?
- Sometimes.

1015
01:16:27,926 --> 01:16:29,636
We believe in you.

1016
01:16:30,181 --> 01:16:32,892
It was an illegal seizure of
trademark property.

1017
01:16:33,254 --> 01:16:34,339
- Miss Potts?
- Relax.

1018
01:16:34,519 --> 01:16:35,520
- Mr. Stark...
- Is here.

1019
01:16:35,645 --> 01:16:37,396
- He refuses...
- I don't. It's fine.

1020
01:16:37,605 --> 01:16:38,517
I'll just be a second.

1021
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:42,603
Listen, it's our position that
Stark has and continues to maintain

1022
01:16:42,610 --> 01:16:45,280
proprietary ownership of
the Mark II platform.

1023
01:16:45,305 --> 01:16:48,216
When Mr. Stark announced
he was indeed Iron Man,

1024
01:16:48,241 --> 01:16:50,410
- he was making a promise to America.
- No, the suit belongs to us.

1025
01:16:50,435 --> 01:16:52,512
We trusted that he would look out for us.

1026
01:16:52,525 --> 01:16:54,698
- Yeah, but you're not... Burt...
- He obviously did not.

1027
01:16:54,706 --> 01:16:57,000
- And now we learn that his secretary
- Yes, it does.

1028
01:16:57,025 --> 01:16:59,319
a woman named Virginia "Pepper" Potts,

1029
01:16:59,544 --> 01:17:02,213
has been appointed
as CEO of Stark Industries.

1030
01:17:02,346 --> 01:17:03,940
What are her qualifications?

1031
01:17:03,965 --> 01:17:05,088
- No.
- Miss Potts is doing

1032
01:17:05,113 --> 01:17:06,197
nothing to manage this terrible...

1033
01:17:06,342 --> 01:17:07,802
- Mute.
- No...

1034
01:17:08,678 --> 01:17:10,738
Burt... Burt... Burt, listen to me.

1035
01:17:10,763 --> 01:17:13,283
Don't tell me that we have
the best patent lawyers in the country

1036
01:17:13,308 --> 01:17:15,351
and then not let me pursue this.

1037
01:17:15,768 --> 01:17:16,811
I'll get this stuff out of here.

1038
01:17:16,836 --> 01:17:19,298
Well, then, tell the President
to sign an order.

1039
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:22,100
We'll talk about it at the Expo.

1040
01:17:22,108 --> 01:17:25,069
Hammer's giving some presentation
tomorrow evening.

1041
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:27,396
Will Tony Stark be there?

1042
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:28,322
Will I?

1043
01:17:28,698 --> 01:17:31,009
- No, he will not. Bye.
- I would like to be.

1044
01:17:32,243 --> 01:17:33,386
- Got a minute?
- No.

1045
01:17:33,411 --> 01:17:36,122
Come on, you just got off the phone.
You're fine, 30 seconds.

1046
01:17:37,582 --> 01:17:39,876
Twenty-nine. Twenty-eight.

1047
01:17:40,001 --> 01:17:41,686
I was just driving over here,

1048
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:44,289
and I thought I was coming to
basically apologize, but I'm not.

1049
01:17:44,297 --> 01:17:47,050
- You didn't come here to apologize?
- Look, that goes without saying,

1050
01:17:47,075 --> 01:17:48,618
and I'm working on that.

1051
01:17:48,843 --> 01:17:52,673
But I haven't been
entirely upfront with you,

1052
01:17:52,698 --> 01:17:54,157
and I just want to try to make good.

1053
01:17:54,182 --> 01:17:57,544
Can I move this? This is crazy.
It's like a Ferris wheel going.

1054
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:58,846
- I'm trying to get some...
- No.

1055
01:18:01,569 --> 01:18:03,814
Do you know how short life is?

1056
01:18:04,108 --> 01:18:07,111
And if I never got to express...

1057
01:18:07,236 --> 01:18:09,864
And by the way,
this is somewhat revelatory to me.

1058
01:18:09,989 --> 01:18:12,508
And I don't care...
I mean, I care. It would be nice.

1059
01:18:12,533 --> 01:18:14,118
I'm not expecting you to...

1060
01:18:14,243 --> 01:18:15,470
Look, here's what I'm trying to say.

1061
01:18:15,495 --> 01:18:17,430
- I'm just gonna say it.
- Let me stop you right here, okay?

1062
01:18:17,455 --> 01:18:19,874
Because if you say "I" one more time,

1063
01:18:19,899 --> 01:18:22,752
I'm gonna actually hurl something
at your head, I think.

1064
01:18:23,378 --> 01:18:27,193
I am trying to run a company.
Do you have any idea what that entails?

1065
01:18:27,217 --> 01:18:27,982
Yes.

1066
01:18:28,007 --> 01:18:30,969
People are relying on you to be Iron Man
and you've disappeared,

1067
01:18:30,994 --> 01:18:34,173
and all I'm doing is putting out your fires
and taking the heat for it.

1068
01:18:37,058 --> 01:18:40,478
I am trying to do the job
that you were meant to do.

1069
01:18:44,274 --> 01:18:46,195
Did you bring me strawberries?

1070
01:18:47,735 --> 01:18:51,214
Did you know that there's only
one thing on Earth that I'm allergic to?

1071
01:18:51,239 --> 01:18:53,449
Allergic to strawberries.

1072
01:18:56,035 --> 01:18:57,136
This is progress, Pepper.

1073
01:18:57,161 --> 01:18:59,687
I knew there was a correlation
between you and this.

1074
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:02,100
- I need you
- I need you, too.

1075
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:04,752
- to leave now.
- That's what I'm trying to...

1076
01:19:09,966 --> 01:19:11,342
Miss Potts?

1077
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:13,667
Hi, come on in.

1078
01:19:13,691 --> 01:19:15,305
Wheels up in 25 minutes.

1079
01:19:15,872 --> 01:19:17,207
Thank you.

1080
01:19:19,017 --> 01:19:20,476
- Anything else, boss?
- I'm good, Hap.

1081
01:19:20,501 --> 01:19:23,545
No, I'll be just... another minute.

1082
01:19:24,689 --> 01:19:26,570
I lost both the kids in the divorce.

1083
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:31,613
No.

1084
01:19:33,823 --> 01:19:36,707
Are you blending in well here, Natalie?

1085
01:19:36,731 --> 01:19:39,093
Here at Stark Enterprises?

1086
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:41,679
Your name is Natalie, isn't it?

1087
01:19:42,415 --> 01:19:45,435
I thought you two didn't get along.

1088
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:48,585
- No. That's not so.
- It's just me you don't care for.

1089
01:19:48,963 --> 01:19:50,136
No? Nothing?

1090
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,542
Actually, while you're here,

1091
01:19:51,554 --> 01:19:54,611
maybe you and Natalie could discuss
the matter of the personal belongings.

1092
01:19:54,636 --> 01:19:56,012
Absolutely.

1093
01:20:02,427 --> 01:20:03,976
I'm surprised you can keep your mouth shut.

1094
01:20:04,001 --> 01:20:07,415
Boy, you're good. You are mind-blowingly
duplicitous. How do you do it?

1095
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,334
You just tear things...
You're a triple impostor.

1096
01:20:09,359 --> 01:20:11,711
I've never seen anything like you.
Is there anything real about you?

1097
01:20:11,736 --> 01:20:12,779
Do you even speak Latin?

1098
01:20:14,989 --> 01:20:17,575
Which means? Wait. What?
What did you just say?

1099
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,812
It means you can either drive yourself home
or I can have you collected.

1100
01:20:22,538 --> 01:20:23,734
You're good.

1101
01:21:23,766 --> 01:21:26,394
Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form
a digital wire frame?

1102
01:21:26,419 --> 01:21:28,749
I need a manipulatable projection.

1103
01:21:36,321 --> 01:21:39,824
1974 Stark Expo
model scan complete, sir.

1104
01:21:42,055 --> 01:21:44,012
How many buildings are there?

1105
01:21:44,037 --> 01:21:46,456
Am I to include
the Belgian waffle stands?

1106
01:21:46,481 --> 01:21:48,983
That was rhetorical. Just show me.

1107
01:22:01,888 --> 01:22:03,887
What does that look like to you, Jarvis?

1108
01:22:04,173 --> 01:22:06,576
Not unlike an atom.

1109
01:22:06,601 --> 01:22:10,106
In which case, the nucleus would be here.

1110
01:22:11,123 --> 01:22:12,794
Highlight the unisphere.

1111
01:22:22,033 --> 01:22:25,110
Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.

1112
01:22:25,149 --> 01:22:27,155
What is it you're trying to achieve, sir?

1113
01:22:27,163 --> 01:22:28,957
I'm discovering... Correction.

1114
01:22:29,082 --> 01:22:33,002
I'm rediscovering a new element,
I believe.

1115
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:36,823
Lose the landscaping,
the shrubbery, the trees.

1116
01:22:36,917 --> 01:22:39,169
Parking lots, exits, entrances.

1117
01:22:44,055 --> 01:22:50,019
Structure the protons and the neutrons
using the pavilions as a framework.

1118
01:22:53,147 --> 01:22:54,232
Dad.

1119
01:23:15,545 --> 01:23:20,258
Dead for almost 20 years,
and still taking me to school.

1120
01:23:26,514 --> 01:23:31,102
The proposed element should serve as
a viable replacement for palladium.

1121
01:23:31,327 --> 01:23:32,370
Thanks, Dad.

1122
01:23:32,395 --> 01:23:35,565
Unfortunately,
it is impossible to synthesize.

1123
01:23:40,153 --> 01:23:43,698
Get ready for a major remodel, fellas.
We're back in hardware mode.

1124
01:24:31,599 --> 01:24:33,852
- I heard you broke the perimeter.
- Yeah.

1125
01:24:33,877 --> 01:24:35,880
That was, like, three years ago.
Where you been?

1126
01:24:35,905 --> 01:24:39,520
- I was doing some stuff.
- Yeah, well, me, too, and it worked.

1127
01:24:40,046 --> 01:24:42,006
Hey, I'm playing for the home team,
Coulson,

1128
01:24:42,201 --> 01:24:44,245
you and all your
Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.

1129
01:24:44,270 --> 01:24:46,022
Now, are you gonna let me work
or break my balls?

1130
01:24:48,388 --> 01:24:50,348
What's this doing here?

1131
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:53,463
That's it.

1132
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:55,790
Bring that to me.

1133
01:24:55,799 --> 01:24:56,799
You know what this is?

1134
01:24:56,824 --> 01:24:58,494
It's exactly what I need to make this work.

1135
01:25:00,275 --> 01:25:01,276
Lift the coil.

1136
01:25:01,818 --> 01:25:03,481
Go, go. Put your knees into it.

1137
01:25:03,759 --> 01:25:05,595
There you go. And...

1138
01:25:06,781 --> 01:25:08,302
Drop it. Drop it.

1139
01:25:11,869 --> 01:25:13,345
Perfectly level.

1140
01:25:13,958 --> 01:25:15,056
I'm busy. What do you want?

1141
01:25:15,081 --> 01:25:18,209
Nothing. Goodbye. I've been reassigned.

1142
01:25:18,935 --> 01:25:20,478
Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.

1143
01:25:20,503 --> 01:25:23,022
- Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.
- So I'm told.

1144
01:25:23,047 --> 01:25:25,049
- Secret stuff?
- Something like that.

1145
01:25:26,509 --> 01:25:27,610
- Good luck.
- Bye.

1146
01:25:27,635 --> 01:25:29,679
- Thanks.
- We need you.

1147
01:25:29,764 --> 01:25:32,684
- Yeah, more than you know.
- Not that much.

1148
01:25:51,026 --> 01:25:53,338
Initialising prismatic accelerator.

1149
01:25:59,834 --> 01:26:02,211
Approaching maximum power.

1150
01:26:49,759 --> 01:26:50,927
That was easy.

1151
01:27:07,527 --> 01:27:09,445
Congratulations, sir.

1152
01:27:11,239 --> 01:27:13,700
You have created a new element.

1153
01:27:21,666 --> 01:27:25,461
Sir, the reactor has accepted
the modified core.

1154
01:27:25,586 --> 01:27:28,131
I will begin running diagnostics.

1155
01:27:34,053 --> 01:27:35,388
Hey, lvan.

1156
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,307
I got Senator Stern here.

1157
01:27:37,479 --> 01:27:39,773
Thought we'd swing over
and look at some of the drone designs.

1158
01:27:39,851 --> 01:27:42,103
The drone is not going to be ready.

1159
01:27:42,395 --> 01:27:43,605
Not ready? What do you mean?

1160
01:27:43,730 --> 01:27:47,150
I can make presentation,
not demonstration.

1161
01:27:47,275 --> 01:27:49,235
What the hell is the difference?

1162
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:52,113
Presentation. No fly. No shoot.

1163
01:27:52,405 --> 01:27:54,240
Well, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

1164
01:27:54,365 --> 01:27:57,452
What can you make them do? I mean,
this is a weapons demonstration.

1165
01:27:57,577 --> 01:28:00,872
- I can make salute.
- You can make salute?

1166
01:28:00,897 --> 01:28:02,332
What do you mean, "make salute"?

1167
01:28:02,457 --> 01:28:06,502
What the hell does that mean, lvan?
This is not what we agreed to, okay?

1168
01:28:06,628 --> 01:28:09,213
You promised me suits
and then you promised me drones.

1169
01:28:09,339 --> 01:28:13,384
- Hey, man, everything will be okay.
- This is not what I wanted.

1170
01:28:25,563 --> 01:28:28,149
Hey, there he is. It's the bird man.

1171
01:28:29,734 --> 01:28:35,323
Now you like the bird. Is that right?
Is that your bird? I'm confused.

1172
01:28:36,324 --> 01:28:39,661
You said it wasn't,
but now it looks like you're best of pals.

1173
01:28:39,786 --> 01:28:43,665
You love that bird, don't you?
You know what? Take the bird.

1174
01:28:45,734 --> 01:28:46,584
Hey!

1175
01:28:48,711 --> 01:28:51,339
Take his pillows, too. Both of them.

1176
01:28:52,632 --> 01:28:54,550
And his shoes. Take his shoes.

1177
01:28:58,638 --> 01:29:00,306
I took your stuff.

1178
01:29:00,583 --> 01:29:03,559
How does that make you feel?
Do you feel bad?

1179
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:06,980
Good. 'Cause that's how I feel!

1180
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:10,775
We had a contract.

1181
01:29:11,416 --> 01:29:15,947
I saved your life and you give me suits.

1182
01:29:16,476 --> 01:29:18,186
That was our deal.

1183
01:29:18,366 --> 01:29:20,368
And you did not deliver.

1184
01:29:21,244 --> 01:29:25,707
I don't know if you're a genius or a fraud.
I don't know what you are.

1185
01:29:28,084 --> 01:29:31,379
Something really, really great
fell into my lap.

1186
01:29:32,005 --> 01:29:35,216
And if it hadn't,
I'd be at your mercy tonight.

1187
01:29:35,508 --> 01:29:39,262
Now I have a piece of Stark tech
that I pimped out myself.

1188
01:29:39,554 --> 01:29:42,690
And now your overpriced paperweights
are gonna look like a backdrop

1189
01:29:42,714 --> 01:29:44,069
to my demonstration.

1190
01:29:44,475 --> 01:29:46,644
Do you dig what I'm getting at here?

1191
01:29:48,938 --> 01:29:53,151
I don't know if you know this,
but I don't speak Russian!

1192
01:29:56,613 --> 01:29:58,448
I'm gonna leave now.

1193
01:29:58,573 --> 01:30:01,618
I'm gonna go to the Expo.
Maybe I'll even get laid.

1194
01:30:02,410 --> 01:30:04,203
You see these guys?
They're your babysitters.

1195
01:30:04,412 --> 01:30:06,873
They are not to be trifled with.

1196
01:30:07,290 --> 01:30:11,544
When I get back, we're gonna
renegotiate the terms of our agreement.

1197
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:14,172
And you're gonna make good
on our arrangement...

1198
01:30:14,743 --> 01:30:15,940
...because if you don't,

1199
01:30:15,965 --> 01:30:20,094
you're gonna be exactly what you were
when I found you, a dead man.

1200
01:30:20,119 --> 01:30:21,496
You got that?

1201
01:30:22,597 --> 01:30:24,891
Maybe you can watch me on TV.

1202
01:30:34,359 --> 01:30:36,694
Dummy, you, can we clean up
this mess? You're killing me.

1203
01:30:36,726 --> 01:30:37,605
You know I don't...

1204
01:30:37,629 --> 01:30:40,031
Incoming call with a blocked number, sir.

1205
01:30:40,156 --> 01:30:43,326
My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely.

1206
01:30:43,355 --> 01:30:44,969
Coulson.
How's the Land of Enchantment?

1207
01:30:44,994 --> 01:30:47,664
Hey, Tony, how you doing?

1208
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:51,292
- I double cycle.
- You what?

1209
01:30:52,335 --> 01:30:56,172
You told me double cycle's more power.
Good advice.

1210
01:30:56,534 --> 01:30:58,274
You sound pretty sprightly for a dead guy.

1211
01:30:58,299 --> 01:30:59,759
You, too.

1212
01:31:02,387 --> 01:31:03,680
- Trace him.
- Sir.

1213
01:31:03,805 --> 01:31:07,517
Now, the true history of Stark name
will be written.

1214
01:31:07,642 --> 01:31:08,685
Jarvis, where is he?

1215
01:31:08,710 --> 01:31:12,797
Accessing the Oracle grid.
Eastern Seaboard.

1216
01:31:13,022 --> 01:31:17,110
What your father did to my family
over 40 years,

1217
01:31:17,986 --> 01:31:20,571
I will do to you in 40 minutes.

1218
01:31:20,822 --> 01:31:22,699
Sounds good.
Let's get together and hash it out.

1219
01:31:22,724 --> 01:31:24,015
Tri-State area.

1220
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:26,661
Manhattan and outlying boroughs.

1221
01:31:26,686 --> 01:31:28,563
I hope you're ready.

1222
01:31:31,457 --> 01:31:33,418
Call trace incomplete.

1223
01:31:44,053 --> 01:31:46,598
- Sir...
- You want to run some tests, run them.

1224
01:31:47,682 --> 01:31:49,601
And assemble the suit while you're at it.
Put it together now.

1225
01:31:49,726 --> 01:31:52,103
- We are unclear as to the effects...
- I don't want to hear it, Jarvis.

1226
01:31:56,566 --> 01:31:58,610
That tastes like coconut.

1227
01:31:58,735 --> 01:32:00,403
And metal.

1228
01:32:00,778 --> 01:32:02,280
Oh, wow, yeah!

1229
01:32:14,959 --> 01:32:16,753
I'll keep the car down here, all right?

1230
01:32:16,878 --> 01:32:18,129
Thank you, Happy.

1231
01:32:18,154 --> 01:32:22,867
...Justin Hammer. His presentation
will begin shortly in the main pavilion.

1232
01:32:41,486 --> 01:32:42,695
Yeah.

1233
01:32:43,863 --> 01:32:47,158
That's what I'm talking about.
Thanks for coming.

1234
01:32:47,825 --> 01:32:49,744
Ladies and gentlemen, for far too long,

1235
01:32:49,769 --> 01:32:54,274
this country has had to place
its brave men and women in harm's way,

1236
01:32:54,582 --> 01:32:56,267
but then the Iron Man arrived,

1237
01:32:56,292 --> 01:32:59,921
and we thought the days of
losing lives were behind us.

1238
01:33:00,797 --> 01:33:03,608
Sadly, that technology
was kept out of reach.

1239
01:33:03,633 --> 01:33:05,927
That's not fair. That's not right.

1240
01:33:06,052 --> 01:33:07,434
And it's just too bad.

1241
01:33:07,458 --> 01:33:08,363
Oh, Lord.

1242
01:33:08,388 --> 01:33:10,634
Regardless, 
it was an impressive innovation,

1243
01:33:10,659 --> 01:33:13,435
one that grabbed headlines the world over.

1244
01:33:13,851 --> 01:33:18,982
Well, today, my friends, the press is
faced with quite a different problem.

1245
01:33:19,524 --> 01:33:21,985
They are about to run out of ink.

1246
01:33:27,573 --> 01:33:29,492
Get that out of here.

1247
01:33:30,493 --> 01:33:32,328
Ladies and gentlemen,

1248
01:33:33,413 --> 01:33:39,438
today I present to you the new face of
the United States military.

1249
01:33:40,555 --> 01:33:41,879
The Hammer drone.

1250
01:33:44,465 --> 01:33:45,842
Army!

1251
01:33:59,022 --> 01:34:00,148
Navy!

1252
01:34:10,408 --> 01:34:11,826
Air Force!

1253
01:34:19,751 --> 01:34:21,002
Marines!

1254
01:34:32,931 --> 01:34:34,057
Yeah!

1255
01:34:34,349 --> 01:34:35,516
Yeah!

1256
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:41,898
That's a hell of a lot better than
some cheerleaders, let me tell you.

1257
01:34:43,274 --> 01:34:46,110
But as revolutionary
as this technology is,

1258
01:34:46,135 --> 01:34:49,906
there will always be a need for man
to be present in the theatre of war.

1259
01:34:50,531 --> 01:34:53,534
Ladies and gentlemen,
today I am proud to present to you

1260
01:34:53,563 --> 01:34:55,487
the very first prototype

1261
01:34:55,495 --> 01:34:58,848
in the Variable Threat Response
Battle Suit

1262
01:34:58,873 --> 01:35:02,669
and its pilot, Air Force
Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.

1263
01:35:04,253 --> 01:35:05,463
What?

1264
01:35:26,401 --> 01:35:29,612
For America and its allies,
Hammer Industries is reporting for...

1265
01:35:46,671 --> 01:35:48,298
We got trouble.

1266
01:35:48,423 --> 01:35:50,091
Tony, there are civilians present.

1267
01:35:50,116 --> 01:35:52,702
I'm here on orders.
Let's not do this right now.

1268
01:35:52,927 --> 01:35:54,178
Give them a wave.

1269
01:35:54,203 --> 01:35:56,330
Hey, all right. Yeah.

1270
01:35:56,556 --> 01:35:58,658
All these people are in danger.
We gotta get them out of here.

1271
01:35:58,683 --> 01:36:00,643
You gotta trust me for
the next five minutes.

1272
01:36:00,668 --> 01:36:02,912
Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed
around your house, remember?

1273
01:36:02,937 --> 01:36:04,939
Listen, I think he's working with Vanko.

1274
01:36:04,964 --> 01:36:06,549
Vanko's alive?

1275
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:09,027
Yeah.

1276
01:36:09,052 --> 01:36:10,261
Where is he?

1277
01:36:10,778 --> 01:36:12,739
- What?
- Where's Vanko?

1278
01:36:13,239 --> 01:36:14,615
- Who?
- Tell me.

1279
01:36:15,158 --> 01:36:17,118
What are you doing here, man?

1280
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:18,777
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1281
01:36:23,291 --> 01:36:24,229
Is that you?

1282
01:36:24,253 --> 01:36:25,896
No, I'm not doing that. That's not me.

1283
01:36:26,794 --> 01:36:29,422
I can't move. I'm locked up.
I'm locked up!

1284
01:36:30,256 --> 01:36:32,467
Get out of here. Go!
This whole system's been compromised.

1285
01:36:33,801 --> 01:36:35,678
Let's take it outside.

1286
01:36:47,857 --> 01:36:49,067
No. No!

1287
01:36:59,077 --> 01:37:01,080
Jarvis, break in. I need to own him.

1288
01:37:01,104 --> 01:37:02,068
Yes, sir.

1289
01:37:04,165 --> 01:37:07,043
Tony, Tony, I'm locked on.
I have target lock.

1290
01:37:07,068 --> 01:37:08,653
- On what?
- On you.

1291
01:37:13,841 --> 01:37:15,635
Tony, on your six!

1292
01:37:32,986 --> 01:37:35,321
- What's going on? What's happening?
- The software's been overridden.

1293
01:37:35,346 --> 01:37:36,714
What? What do you mean
it's been overridden?

1294
01:37:36,739 --> 01:37:38,132
- What does that mean?
- I think he slaved the drones.

1295
01:37:38,157 --> 01:37:39,242
That's impossible.

1296
01:37:39,267 --> 01:37:41,094
- Call the guards.
- All the phones are down, sir.

1297
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:43,304
Well, then call their... Call their cells.

1298
01:37:43,329 --> 01:37:44,831
Their cell phones
are not working, either, sir.

1299
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:46,241
He's locked us out of the mainframe.

1300
01:37:46,249 --> 01:37:47,517
Who's locked you out of the mainframe?

1301
01:37:47,542 --> 01:37:49,143
Please, please, go away. Go away.

1302
01:37:49,168 --> 01:37:50,550
- I've got this handled.
- Have you now?

1303
01:37:50,575 --> 01:37:51,660
Yes, I do.

1304
01:37:51,685 --> 01:37:54,315
In fact, if your guy hadn't showed up,
this wouldn't be happening.

1305
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:56,676
So please, now go away. Thank you.

1306
01:37:57,093 --> 01:37:59,387
Listen, we got to get
these bitches out of here.

1307
01:37:59,637 --> 01:38:01,055
What?

1308
01:38:01,167 --> 01:38:02,574
You tell me who's behind this.

1309
01:38:02,599 --> 01:38:04,206
Who's behind this?

1310
01:38:04,617 --> 01:38:07,103
Ivan. Ivan Vanko.

1311
01:38:07,562 --> 01:38:08,613
Where is he?

1312
01:38:08,638 --> 01:38:10,056
He's at my facility.

1313
01:38:13,484 --> 01:38:15,211
- I need NYPD, please.
- No, no, no!

1314
01:38:15,223 --> 01:38:16,480
- Command Central.
- No, no, honey.

1315
01:38:16,487 --> 01:38:18,464
- Don't call the authorities.
- Okay. Right away. Right away.

1316
01:38:18,489 --> 01:38:20,491
Step aside. Step aside.

1317
01:38:21,492 --> 01:38:23,119
Tell me everything you know. Go.

1318
01:38:30,585 --> 01:38:32,023
How are we doing, Jarvis?

1319
01:38:32,047 --> 01:38:33,546
Remote reboot unsuccessful.

1320
01:38:51,064 --> 01:38:52,523
This way.

1321
01:38:53,232 --> 01:38:55,126
Nobody's answering the phone.
What's going on?

1322
01:38:55,151 --> 01:38:57,362
Get in the car.
Take me to Hammer Industries.

1323
01:38:57,487 --> 01:38:59,956
- I'm not taking you anywhere.
- Fine. You want me to drive?

1324
01:38:59,989 --> 01:39:02,492
No, I'm driving. Get in the car.

1325
01:40:01,009 --> 01:40:02,635
Nice work, kid.

1326
01:40:04,428 --> 01:40:06,176
You got multiples coming in on you.

1327
01:40:06,201 --> 01:40:07,724
Let's get this away from the Expo.

1328
01:40:13,187 --> 01:40:15,565
When we arrive,
I need you to watch the perimeter.

1329
01:40:15,690 --> 01:40:19,319
I'm gonna enter the facility
and take down the target.

1330
01:40:21,613 --> 01:40:24,198
- Watch the road.
- I got it. I got it.

1331
01:40:54,646 --> 01:40:55,788
Listen, listen.

1332
01:40:55,813 --> 01:40:57,815
A pack just peeled off.
They're headed back to the Expo.

1333
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:59,132
Got it.

1334
01:41:03,029 --> 01:41:04,489
I'm closing on you.

1335
01:41:04,514 --> 01:41:06,850
Ordnance coming in hot, Tony. Watch it.

1336
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:25,510
- Stay in the car.
- I'm not staying in the car.

1337
01:41:25,635 --> 01:41:27,136
I said, stay in the car.

1338
01:41:27,345 --> 01:41:29,305
What are you wearing?

1339
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:32,892
Look, I'm not letting you
go in there alone.

1340
01:41:33,017 --> 01:41:35,368
- You want to help? Keep the car running.
- Okay.

1341
01:41:39,315 --> 01:41:41,567
Hey, hey, hey. You can't come in here.

1342
01:41:42,026 --> 01:41:43,528
Hold on. Hey!

1343
01:42:28,281 --> 01:42:31,300
Each set of drones is communicating 
in its own unique language.

1344
01:42:31,324 --> 01:42:33,036
Well, choose one and focus on that.

1345
01:42:33,061 --> 01:42:35,092
Have you tried Russian?
Why don't you try Russian?

1346
01:42:38,625 --> 01:42:41,127
Attention. We have intrusion on Grid W.

1347
01:42:41,252 --> 01:42:43,504
We got it. We're on our way.

1348
01:43:24,963 --> 01:43:26,381
I got him!

1349
01:43:41,271 --> 01:43:43,273
- Rhodey, you still locked on?
- Yeah.

1350
01:43:43,298 --> 01:43:46,718
Drop your socks and grab your Crocs.
We're about to get wet on this ride.

1351
01:43:49,028 --> 01:43:50,113
Wait, wait, wait!

1352
01:44:09,757 --> 01:44:11,134
He's gone.

1353
01:44:15,263 --> 01:44:17,265
I'm sorry, buddy.
Had to thin out the herd.

1354
01:44:18,099 --> 01:44:19,504
What's your 20?

1355
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:32,748
What are you doing?

1356
01:44:32,773 --> 01:44:34,276
I'm rebooting Rhodey's suit.

1357
01:44:40,788 --> 01:44:41,789
Tony!

1358
01:44:58,348 --> 01:44:59,974
Reboot complete.

1359
01:45:00,784 --> 01:45:02,494
You got your best friend back.

1360
01:45:02,518 --> 01:45:04,521
Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.

1361
01:45:04,548 --> 01:45:05,955
Well done with the new chest piece.

1362
01:45:05,980 --> 01:45:09,609
I am reading significantly higher output
and your vitals all look promising.

1363
01:45:09,734 --> 01:45:12,445
Yes, for the moment, I'm not dying.
Thank you.

1364
01:45:12,570 --> 01:45:14,714
What do you mean you're not dying?
Did you just say you're dying?

1365
01:45:14,739 --> 01:45:16,449
Is that you? No, I'm not.

1366
01:45:16,474 --> 01:45:18,176
- Not any more.
- What's going on?

1367
01:45:18,201 --> 01:45:19,837
I was going to tell you.
I didn't want to alarm you.

1368
01:45:19,855 --> 01:45:21,613
You were gonna tell me?
You really were dying?

1369
01:45:21,621 --> 01:45:23,331
- You didn't let me.
- Why didn't you tell me that?

1370
01:45:23,356 --> 01:45:26,267
I was gonna make you an omelette
and tell you.

1371
01:45:26,292 --> 01:45:29,212
Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon.
You got incoming, Tony.

1372
01:45:29,337 --> 01:45:30,980
Looks like the fight's coming to you.

1373
01:45:31,005 --> 01:45:32,799
- Great. Pepper?
- Are you okay now?

1374
01:45:32,824 --> 01:45:34,929
I am fine. Don't be mad.
I will formally apologize...

1375
01:45:34,954 --> 01:45:35,877
I am mad!

1376
01:45:35,885 --> 01:45:38,805
...when I'm not fending off
a Hammeroid attack.

1377
01:45:38,930 --> 01:45:40,490
- Fine.
- We could have been in Venice.

1378
01:45:40,515 --> 01:45:41,557
Oh, please.

1379
01:45:44,982 --> 01:45:46,206
Rhodes?

1380
01:45:46,646 --> 01:45:49,274
Snap out of it, buddy. I need you.

1381
01:45:50,108 --> 01:45:52,360
They're coming.
Come on, let's roll. Get up.

1382
01:45:55,613 --> 01:45:57,782
Oh, man. You can have your suit back.

1383
01:46:01,327 --> 01:46:02,620
You okay?

1384
01:46:02,829 --> 01:46:04,372
Yeah, thanks.

1385
01:46:05,943 --> 01:46:08,452
- Tony, look, I'm sorry, okay?
- Don't be.

1386
01:46:08,459 --> 01:46:09,727
No. I should have trusted you more.

1387
01:46:09,752 --> 01:46:11,396
I'm the one who put you in this position.
Forget it.

1388
01:46:11,421 --> 01:46:13,815
No. It's your fault.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

1389
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,704
Thank you. That's all I wanted to hear.

1390
01:46:15,990 --> 01:46:17,179
Partner.

1391
01:46:17,385 --> 01:46:20,930
They're coming in hot, any second.
What's the play?

1392
01:46:21,634 --> 01:46:23,283
Well, we want to take
the high ground, okay?

1393
01:46:23,308 --> 01:46:24,951
So let's put the biggest gun
up on that ridge.

1394
01:46:24,976 --> 01:46:26,227
Got you.

1395
01:46:27,103 --> 01:46:28,246
- Where do you want to be?
- Where are you going?

1396
01:46:28,271 --> 01:46:29,813
- What're you talking about?
- I meant me.

1397
01:46:29,838 --> 01:46:32,040
You have a big gun.
You are not the big gun.

1398
01:46:32,066 --> 01:46:33,501
- Tony, don't be jealous.
- No. It's subtle,

1399
01:46:33,526 --> 01:46:34,752
- all the bells and whistles.
- Yeah.

1400
01:46:34,777 --> 01:46:37,238
- It's called being a badass.
- Fine.

1401
01:46:37,989 --> 01:46:41,326
All right. You go up top.
I'll draw them in.

1402
01:46:41,351 --> 01:46:43,386
Don't stay down here.
This is the worst place to be.

1403
01:46:43,411 --> 01:46:44,721
Okay, you got a spot. Where's mine?

1404
01:46:44,746 --> 01:46:47,624
It's the kill box, Tony. Okay?
This is where you go to die.

1405
01:47:37,382 --> 01:47:39,133
- See that?
- Yeah, yeah, nice.

1406
01:47:47,183 --> 01:47:48,393
Rhodey?

1407
01:47:49,811 --> 01:47:51,229
Get down.

1408
01:48:01,531 --> 01:48:03,950
Wow. I think
you should lead with that next time.

1409
01:48:03,975 --> 01:48:07,270
Yeah. Sorry, boss.
I can only use it once. It's a one-off.

1410
01:48:09,682 --> 01:48:11,809
I told you that five minutes ago.

1411
01:48:13,293 --> 01:48:14,669
That's your guy here.

1412
01:48:16,045 --> 01:48:18,006
- Excuse me?
- You're being placed under arrest.

1413
01:48:18,031 --> 01:48:19,649
- Are you kidding me?
- Hands behind your back, sir.

1414
01:48:19,674 --> 01:48:21,259
I'm trying to help here.

1415
01:48:25,430 --> 01:48:28,933
I get it. I see what you're doing.
You're trying to pin this on me, huh?

1416
01:48:29,058 --> 01:48:30,602
That's good. That's good.

1417
01:48:30,727 --> 01:48:33,605
You're starting to think like a CEO,
taking out the competition.

1418
01:48:33,813 --> 01:48:36,190
I like that. You think you're making
a problem for me?

1419
01:48:36,215 --> 01:48:37,458
I'm gonna make a problem for you.

1420
01:48:37,483 --> 01:48:40,176
I'm gonna be seeing you again
real soon.

1421
01:48:44,528 --> 01:48:45,520
When they get here,

1422
01:48:45,519 --> 01:48:49,071
I think you should station them
at the south, east and both west exits.

1423
01:48:49,106 --> 01:48:51,347
We shut down the 7 train
in and out of Willets Point already.

1424
01:48:51,358 --> 01:48:54,225
Well, have city buses there to
ferry people to operating lines.

1425
01:48:54,250 --> 01:48:55,852
Yeah. Are you coming with us?

1426
01:48:55,877 --> 01:48:57,820
No, I'm gonna stay till the park is clear.

1427
01:48:57,844 --> 01:48:58,738
Okay.

1428
01:49:01,035 --> 01:49:03,496
Heads up.
You got one more drone incoming.

1429
01:49:03,624 --> 01:49:04,917
This one looks different.

1430
01:49:05,511 --> 01:49:07,644
The repulsor signature is
significantly higher.

1431
01:49:18,983 --> 01:49:20,610
Good to be back.

1432
01:49:21,235 --> 01:49:22,695
This ain't gonna be good.

1433
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:28,284
I got something special for this guy.

1434
01:49:28,309 --> 01:49:30,395
I'm gonna bust his bunker
with the Ex-Wife.

1435
01:49:30,596 --> 01:49:32,014
With the what?

1436
01:49:42,465 --> 01:49:43,652
Hammer tech?

1437
01:49:44,165 --> 01:49:44,926
Yeah.

1438
01:49:46,740 --> 01:49:47,683
I got this.

1439
01:50:41,316 --> 01:50:43,276
Rhodes. I got an idea.

1440
01:50:43,693 --> 01:50:45,102
You want to be a hero?

1441
01:50:45,126 --> 01:50:46,154
What?

1442
01:50:46,529 --> 01:50:49,449
I could really use a sidekick.
Put your hand up.

1443
01:50:49,574 --> 01:50:51,409
- This is your idea?
- Yep.

1444
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:54,704
I'm ready. I'm ready. Go, go, go!

1445
01:50:58,541 --> 01:50:59,584
Take it.

1446
01:51:28,196 --> 01:51:29,572
You lose.

1447
01:51:37,163 --> 01:51:39,874
All these drones are rigged to blow.
We gotta get out of here, man.

1448
01:51:40,416 --> 01:51:41,626
Pepper?

1449
01:52:21,833 --> 01:52:23,643
Oh, my God! I can't take this any more.

1450
01:52:23,668 --> 01:52:24,981
- You can't?
- I can't take this.

1451
01:52:25,006 --> 01:52:25,774
Look at me.

1452
01:52:25,798 --> 01:52:27,880
My body, literally,
cannot handle the stress.

1453
01:52:27,905 --> 01:52:32,418
I never know if you're gonna kill yourself
or wreck the whole company.

1454
01:52:32,443 --> 01:52:34,403
I think I did okay.

1455
01:52:34,762 --> 01:52:36,764
I quit. I'm resigning.

1456
01:52:37,432 --> 01:52:38,766
That's it.

1457
01:52:39,259 --> 01:52:41,803
What did you just say? You're done?

1458
01:52:43,231 --> 01:52:46,700
That's surprising.
No, it's not surprising. I get it.

1459
01:52:47,191 --> 01:52:50,340
- You don't have to make any excuses.
- I'm... I'm... I'm not making any excuses.

1460
01:52:50,365 --> 01:52:51,629
You actually were just making excuses.

1461
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:53,176
- But you don't have to.
- No, I wasn't making an excuse.

1462
01:52:53,201 --> 01:52:54,757
- I'm actually very justified.
- Listen. Hey, hey.

1463
01:52:54,782 --> 01:52:56,004
You deserve better.

1464
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:57,076
Well...

1465
01:52:57,101 --> 01:52:59,246
You've taken such good care of me.

1466
01:53:00,663 --> 01:53:03,041
I've been in a tough spot,
but you got me through it, so...

1467
01:53:03,387 --> 01:53:04,475
Right?

1468
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:05,710
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1469
01:53:06,544 --> 01:53:09,464
- Thank you for understanding.
- Yeah, yeah. Let's talk clean-up.

1470
01:53:09,581 --> 01:53:11,079
I'll handle the transition.
It'll be smooth.

1471
01:53:11,103 --> 01:53:12,317
Okay. What about the press?

1472
01:53:12,342 --> 01:53:14,277
Because you only had
the job for a week. That's gonna seem...

1473
01:53:14,302 --> 01:53:15,970
- Well, with you it's like dog years.
- I know.

1474
01:53:15,995 --> 01:53:17,430
I mean, it's like the Presidency...

1475
01:53:30,416 --> 01:53:31,626
Weird.

1476
01:53:32,028 --> 01:53:33,588
- No, it's not weird.
- It's okay, right?

1477
01:53:33,613 --> 01:53:35,490
- Yeah.
- Run that by me again.

1478
01:53:35,515 --> 01:53:37,350
I think it was weird.

1479
01:53:37,854 --> 01:53:40,773
You guys look like two seals
fighting over a grape.

1480
01:53:41,412 --> 01:53:43,831
- I had just quit, actually.
- Yeah, so we're not...

1481
01:53:43,856 --> 01:53:46,417
You don't have to do that.
I heard the whole thing.

1482
01:53:46,442 --> 01:53:49,320
- You should get lost.
- I was here first. Get a roof.

1483
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:52,882
- I thought you were out of one-liners.
- That's the last one.

1484
01:53:52,909 --> 01:53:55,711
- You kicked ass back there, by the way.
- Thank you. You, too.

1485
01:53:55,718 --> 01:53:58,179
Listen, my car got taken out
in the explosion,

1486
01:53:58,204 --> 01:54:01,432
so I'm gonna have to hang on
to your suit for a minute, okay?

1487
01:54:01,457 --> 01:54:03,168
Not okay. Not okay with that.

1488
01:54:03,893 --> 01:54:05,103
It wasn't a question.

1489
01:54:10,733 --> 01:54:14,028
How are you gonna resign
if I don't accept?

1490
01:54:33,923 --> 01:54:36,801
I don't think I want you looking at that.

1491
01:54:37,010 --> 01:54:39,137
I'm not sure it pertains to you any more.

1492
01:54:39,262 --> 01:54:44,475
Now this, on the other hand,
is Agent Romanoff's assessment of you.

1493
01:54:45,768 --> 01:54:46,811
Read it.

1494
01:54:48,771 --> 01:54:52,734
"Personality overview. Mr. Stark displays
compulsive behavior."

1495
01:54:52,859 --> 01:54:54,986
In my own defence, that was last week.

1496
01:54:57,071 --> 01:54:59,866
"Prone to self-destructive tendencies."
I was dying.

1497
01:55:00,033 --> 01:55:02,577
I mean, please. And aren't we all?

1498
01:55:02,994 --> 01:55:05,788
"Textbook narcissism"?

1499
01:55:07,874 --> 01:55:08,916
Agreed.

1500
01:55:10,043 --> 01:55:11,377
Okay, here it is.

1501
01:55:11,402 --> 01:55:14,697
"Recruitment assessment for
Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes."

1502
01:55:14,860 --> 01:55:15,876
I gotta think about it.

1503
01:55:15,900 --> 01:55:16,957
Read on.

1504
01:55:20,011 --> 01:55:23,139
"Tony Stark not... Not recommended"?

1505
01:55:24,390 --> 01:55:25,658
That doesn't make any sense.

1506
01:55:25,683 --> 01:55:28,561
How can you approve me
but not approve me?

1507
01:55:29,270 --> 01:55:33,733
I got a new ticker.
I'm trying to do right by Pepper.

1508
01:55:34,359 --> 01:55:37,236
I'm in a stable-ish relationship.

1509
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:40,048
Which leads us to believe
at this juncture

1510
01:55:40,073 --> 01:55:43,075
we'd only like to use you
as a consultant.

1511
01:55:50,166 --> 01:55:52,001
You can't afford me.

1512
01:55:54,379 --> 01:55:59,550
Then again, I will waive my customary
retainer in exchange for a small favor.

1513
01:56:00,544 --> 01:56:03,423
Rhodey and I are being honored 
in Washington

1514
01:56:03,448 --> 01:56:05,472
and we need a presenter.

1515
01:56:07,308 --> 01:56:08,768
I'll see what I can do.

1516
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:15,416
It is my honor to be here today
to present these distinguished awards

1517
01:56:15,441 --> 01:56:19,404
to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes
and Mr. Tony Stark,

1518
01:56:19,429 --> 01:56:22,724
who is, of course, a national treasure.

1519
01:56:25,034 --> 01:56:26,427
Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel,

1520
01:56:26,452 --> 01:56:28,788
for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

1521
01:56:29,122 --> 01:56:31,082
- You deserve this.
- Thank you, sir.

1522
01:56:32,834 --> 01:56:34,185
Mr. Stark.

1523
01:56:34,210 --> 01:56:38,356
Thank you for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

1524
01:56:38,381 --> 01:56:40,008
You deserve this.

1525
01:56:41,509 --> 01:56:43,559
Oh, sorry.

1526
01:56:44,053 --> 01:56:47,432
Funny how annoying
a little prick can be, isn't it?

1527
