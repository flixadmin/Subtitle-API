196
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,968
HE ALSO MENTIONED
THAT HE OFFERED TO SET
YOU UP WITH A LAWYER

197

TO HELP GET
YOUR DAUGHTER BACK,

HE'S THE MOST
SKILLED HACKER

216
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,763

HAS EVER KNOWN.

00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,348
IF HE WAS, I WOULD
HAVE HEARD OF HIM.

218

NO, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
BECAUSE HE'S JUST THAT GOOD.

219
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,477
HE'S A GHOST.

220
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,061
HE'S ALSO THE PERSON
THAT FORMED HELIX.

221
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,646
-WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO...
-8 MONTHS AGO,

222
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:47,981
HE WAS SCOOPED UP
BY ARGUS.

223
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,690
NOT ARRESTED,
NOT CHARGED,

224
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,277
JUST TAKEN,
AND NOW HE'S BEING
HELD WITHOUT CAUSE,

225
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,070
BEING TORTURED,
WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE,

226
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,823
AND I HAD TO TAKE THIS
OFF THAT ARGUS AGENT
SO WE CAN FREE HIM.

227
00:10:56,864 --> 00:11:01,119
ALENA, YOU KILLED
SOMEONE.

TOO JUDGMENTAL,

HELP ME FREE CAYDEN

230

FROM WHEREVER ARGUS
IS HOLDING HIM.

231
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,251
-WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
-BECAUSE BEFORE HE WAS TAKEN,

232
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,086
CAYDEN WAS WORKING
ON A BIOMETRIC TRACKER

233
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,588
THAT COULD RECOGNIZE
A HEARTBEAT,

234
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,590
POWERFUL ENOUGH TO SCAN
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

235

ANYWHERE
ADRIAN CHASE IS.

236

LYLA: WE HAVE A PROBLEM.
JOHN: WHAT IS THAT?

237
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,391
THE PROBLEM.
AFTER DAMIEN DARHK

238
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,934
TOOK MY SECURITY
IMPLANT LAST YEAR,

239
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,478
I INSTITUTED
NEW PROTOCOLS

240
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,229
TO PREVENT ANY
SENSITIVE ARGUS
INFORMATION

241
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,898
OR LOCATION
FROM BEING ACCESSED
BY A SINGLE PERSON.

242
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,443
ACCESS NOW REQUIRES
TWO OF THESE
SECURITY KEYS.

243
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:36,530
BUT AGENT PIERCE'S
KEY WASN'T TAKEN.
YOU FOUND IT ON HIM.

244
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,239
I FOUND A VERY
SOPHISTICATED COPY.

245
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,991
-SMART.
-EXTREMELY.

246
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,242
I ALMOST DIDN'T
CATCH IT.

247
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,619
IF THOSE KEYS HAVE
BEEN COMPROMISED,

248
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,162
THEN THEY HAVE TO BE
REPROGRAMMED.

249
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,622
THE WHOLE POINT
OF HAVING THE KEYS

250
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,040
IS FOR THEM TO BE
UNHACKABLE.

251
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,125

ABOUT 24 HOURS.

TO KEEP OUR FOCUS.

BUT I'VE GOT

256
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,390

LOCKDOWN AT ARGUS.

FOR CAYDEN'S RELEASE.

NO, IT'S NOT,

306
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,639
BUT EVEN IF IT WERE,
AT WHAT COST?

307
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,474
AGENT DITKOFF
COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.

308
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:52,726
NO. THE TEAM WAS
THERE TO MAKE SURE.

309
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:53,934
SHE COULD HAVE
BEEN KILLED

310
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,562
JUST LIKE
AGENT PIERCE.

311
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,937
I TOLD YOU THAT
WAS AN ACCIDENT.

312
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,356
AND NOW...NOW TWO KEYS
ARE IN THE WIND,

313
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,733
AND ARGUS
IS VULNERABLE.

314
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,150
WHAT THE HELL WERE
YOU THINKING?

315
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:02,527
THAT WE NEED TO CATCH
THIS SON OF A BITCH

316
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,737
NO MATTER WHAT.

317
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,616
GUYS, A LITTLE
SUPPORT HERE.

318
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,869
MIGHT BE CROSSING
A LINE, FELICITY.

319
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,370
WELL, YOU'RE THE LAST
PERSON ON EARTH THAT GETS

320
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:15,415
TO GIVE THAT LECTURE, OLIVER.

321
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,333
OR SECOND TO LAST,

322
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,001
AND DON'T TELL ME
THAT YOU DON'T MAKE

323
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,837
MORALLY QUESTIONABLE CHOICES
SO THAT I DON'T HAVE TO.

324
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,213
I HAVE TO!

325
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,090
NO, YOU DON'T, FELICITY.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

326
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,217
LYLA'S RIGHT. THERE ARE
BETTER WAYS FOR US
TO FIND CHASE.

327
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,053
CHASE HAS BEEN IN THE WIND
FOR A WEEK.

328
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,555
HE WAS TRAINED
BY TALIA AL GHUL.

329
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:31,806
HE KNOWS HOW TO
STAY IN THE WIND.

330
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,391
WHAT OTHER LEADS
DO WE HAVE?

331
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,226
HOW ELSE ARE WE GONNA
BRING ADRIAN CHASE
TO JUSTICE

332
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,395
UNLESS ARGUS
LETS GO OF CAYDEN JAMES.

333
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,230
-NOT A CHANCE.
-WELL, THEN MY ONLY CHOICE

334
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,065
IS TO HELP HELIX.

335
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,567
JOHN:
YOUR ONLY CHOICE?

336
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,235
FELICITY,
I THOUGHT WE WERE
ON THE SAME SIDE.

337
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,904
NO, JOHN. I'M ON THE SIDE
THAT'S GONNA PUT CHASE AWAY

338
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,405
SO THAT HE CAN'T HURT
ANYONE EVER AGAIN.

339
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,573
OLIVER: HEY, FELICITY.

340
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,116
LET HER GO, MAN.

341
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,659
NOW'S NOT THE TIME.

342
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,668
YOU WANTED TO
SEE ME, HOSS?

343
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,754
YEAH. F-FIRST, CLOSE
THE DOOR.

344
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,385
SECOND, WHAT HAVE
I TOLD YOU ABOUT
CALLING ME "HOSS"?

345
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,596
-DON'T.
-RIGHT.

346
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,598
YEAH.

347
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,266
OH, JUST SIT DOWN.

348
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,398
ARE YOU FIRING ME?

349
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,984
OH, RENE, THERE
WAS A TIME WHEN
I WOULD HAVE LOVED

350
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,235
TO HEAR YOU
ASK ME THAT,

351
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,862
BUT, NO, I AM NOT
FIRING YOU.

352
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:31,115
I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT...ZOE.

353
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,243
YEAH, YOUR DAUGHTER.

354
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,537
YEAH. I KNOW
HER NAME, HOSS.

355
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,457
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU
I DON'T WANT TO
TALK ABUT HER.

356
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,627
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD
BECAUSE YOU HAPPEN TO
BE WORKING FOR A GUY

357
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,044
WHO WOULD GIVE
ANYTHING TO BE

358
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,880
WITH HIS DAUGHTER AGAIN.

359
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,592
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME, MAN?

360
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,928
AN EXPLANATION.

361
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,554
I LOOKED INTO YOUR CASE,

362
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,598
AND YOU HAVE
FULL VISITATION RIGHTS

363
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,057
AS LONG AS YOU'RE
ACCOMPANIED

364
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,894
BY A COURT-APPOINTED
GUARDIAN,

365
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,438
AND THERE'S NO RECORD
OF YOU EVER VISITING.

366
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,900
PLEASE. JUST LEAVE
THIS ALONE, MAN.

367
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,068
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
I'M NOT GONNA,

368
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,196
SO WHY DON'T WE JUST
SKIP TO THE PART
WHERE YOU TELL ME

369
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,239
WHY YOU DO NOT WANT TO
SEE YOUR DAUGHTER?

370
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,995
OK.

371
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,664
WHEN CURTIS TOLD ME
ABOUT HIS LAWYER FRIEND,
I GOT EXCITED, OK?

372
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:22,249
YEAH, YEAH. ALL RIGHT,
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

373
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:26,045
I REMEMBERED WHY
THEY TOOK ZOE AWAY
FROM ME IN THE FIRST PLACE.

374
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:29,966
YEAH, SURE.
I...I COULD VISIT HER

375
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:32,176
WITH A COURT-APPOINTED
GUARDIAN LIKE YOU SAID.

376
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,595
WANT TO KNOW WHY THAT IS?

377
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,055
BECAUSE I'M BAD NEWS.

378
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,682
YEAH, YOU'RE
AN ACQUIRED TASTE
FOR SURE...

379
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,266
I HURT HER!

380
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,854
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU HURT HER?

381
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:53,322
I...I WAS REHEATING
SOME SOUP FOR HER.

382
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:59,037
IT WAS JUST ABOUT
ALL I COULD MAKE HER...

383
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,793
AND IT WAS ON THE STOVE,
AND I PASS OUT DRUNK.

384
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:12,008
POOR ZOE, SHE'S TRYING TO
GRAB IT AND PULLS IT DOWN,

385
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,260
AND IT BURNS HER HAND
REAL BAD...

386
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,472
AND IT WAS HER CRYING
THAT WOKE ME UP.

387
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,310
ZOE DESERVES BETTER
THAN ME.

388
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,521
END OF STORY.

389
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,481
RENE. RENE,
COME BACK...WHA...

390
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,734
[DOOR SLAMS]

391
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,403
[SIGHS]

392
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:37,784
LYLA: MEET PRISONER 38085,
AKA CAYDEN JAMES.

393
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,035
WHAT ARE YOU
HOLDING HIM ON?

394
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,995
HE'S A PERSON OF INTEREST.

395
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,873
SO NO CRIME.
I'M GUESSING
NO TRIAL EITHER.

396
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,417
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING YOU
WANT TO SAY TO ME, JOHNNY?

397
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,210
NOT RIGHT NOW, LYLA.

398
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,129
OLIVER: THERE'S SOMETHING
WE'RE NOT CONSIDERING.

399
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,799
WHAT IF FELICITY
IS RIGHT?

400
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,968
SHE MIGHT BE RIGHT.

401
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:57,177
WE GIVE JAMES A TERMINAL,
WE MAKE HIM FIND CHASE,

402
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:00,098
AND THEN WE HAND HIM
BACK TO HELIX.

403
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,017
I KNOW YOU WANT CHASE
OFF THE BOARD, OLIVER,

404
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,561
BUT CAYDEN JAMES IS
AS DANGEROUS AS A LOOSE NUKE.

405
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,313
I CAN'T PUT HIM
BACK IN PLAY.

406
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,607
HELIX HAS COMPROMISED
YOUR SECURITY,

407
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,400
AND NOW THEY HAVE HIRED
MERCENARIES

408
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:13,778
THAT ARE GONNA GO
AFTER ARGUS TO GET JAMES OUT.

409
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,529
WHICH MEANS WE GO
AFTER THEM FIRST.

410
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,948
CURTIS HAS INTEL
AS TO WHERE THEIR

411
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,324
BASE OF
OPERATIONS IS.

412
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,784
AND WE'D BE GOING IN
COMPLETELY BLIND.

413
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,201
WE HAVE A GREATER CHANCE
OF SUCCESS

414
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,038
IF WE LET HELIX
COME TO US.

415
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,499
WAIT, LYLA.

416
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,750
YOU WANT TO SET
A TRAP FOR HELIX

417
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,586
AND USE JAMES
AS THE BAIT?

418
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,046
I DON'T THINK I NEED TO
TELL EITHER OF YOU

419
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,631
HOW DANGEROUS HELIX IS.

420
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,009
THIS IS OUR CHANCE
TO TAKE THEM DOWN.

421
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:40,013
THIS IS HAPPENING
WITH OR WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

422
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,765
I'LL LET YOU BOYS WRAP
YOUR HEAD AROUND THAT.

423
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,858
WE HAVE TO GET FELICITY
OUT OF HELIX.

424
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,442
WE CAN'T LET HER GET
INVOLVED IN THIS.

425
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:54,819
YOU MEAN ANY MORE
INVOLVED.

426
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,071
WE KNEW SHE WAS
INTO SOMETHING,

427
00:19:57,113 --> 00:20:00,116
WE KNEW IT WAS BAD.

428
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:02,576
WE JUST LET HER GET
IN DEEPER.

429
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,954
OLIVER, GRIEF CAN MAKE
PEOPLE DO CRAZY THINGS.

430
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:08,248
NO ONE KNOWS THAT
BETTER THAN YOU AND ME,

431
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,543
BUT I'M NOT THE ONE
SHE WAS GONNA MARRY.

432
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,884
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

433
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,426
MY POINT IS...

434
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:24,306
OLIVER, LOOK, MAYBE
WE SHOULD HAVE TALKED
HER OUT OF HELIX,

435
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,683
MAYBE NOT, I DON'T KNOW,
BUT THE POINT IS

436
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,019
WE'RE HERE NOW,
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

437
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,896
SHE WILL LISTEN TO.

438
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:35,401
I'M NOT...SURE
HOW MUCH CREDIBILITY

439
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,070
I HAVE WITH HER.

440
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,821
YOU BOTH WANT TO
CATCH CHASE, RIGHT?

441
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,490
YOU HAVE THAT
IN COMMON,

442
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,409
WHICH TELLS ME YOU ARE
THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN

443
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,244
PULL HER BACK
FROM THE BRINK.

444
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,211
OH!

445
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,588
-HI.
-HEY.

446
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,507
NICE OF YOU TO USE
THE FRONT DOOR FOR ONCE.

447
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:59,967
MAY I COME IN, PLEASE?

448
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,510
UH, ACTUALLY,
I WAS JUST LEAVING.

449
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:02,678
I CAN SEE THAT.

450
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,599
SURE.

451
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,856
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE NOT
SITTING BEHIND A KEYBOARD
FOR THIS ONE.

452
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,694
-CAN YOU BLAME ME?
-NO.

453
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,072
I...MORE THAN
PROBABLY ANYONE ELSE...

454
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,074
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S
LIKE TO BE WILLING TO DO

455
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,825
WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO STOP CHASE.

456
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,119
THEN LET ME DO IT.

457
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,704
LET ME JUST TELL YOU
HOW I'M SEEING THINGS.

458
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:31,874
YOU'RE WILLING TO DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO STOP CHASE

459
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:37,379
BECAUSE I WAS WILLING
TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO SAVE THIS CITY,

460
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,465
AND THAT CREATED HIM.

461
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,008
OK. SO IT'S IRONIC.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

462
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,927
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE.

463
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:46,139
YOU SEE, WE...WE CAN
THINK OF ANOTHER WAY
TO FIND HIM,

464
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,390
AND THEN WE CAN FIND
ANOTHER WAY TO STOP HIM.

465
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,350
OK. HOW?
THE SCPD TIP LINE?

466
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,770
NO. THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK
THIS TIME, OLIVER.

467
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,605
WE BOTH KNOW THAT.

468
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,941
LOOK. THIS IS
OUR ONLY CHANCE.

469
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,609
AND THIS IS ME ASKING
YOU...

470
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,196
DON'T DO THIS.

471
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,366
FOR THE PAST 4 YEARS,
I HAVE WATCHED YOU DO

472
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:09,036
WHATEVER YOU HAD TO,
WHATEVER IT TOOK

473
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,412
TO STOP THE PEOPLE
THREATENING THIS CITY.

474
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,956
HOW CAN YOU STAND THERE
AND NOT ASK ME

475
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,874
TO DO THE SAME THING?

476
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:18,087
BECAUSE OVER THE PAST
4 YEARS, YOU, MORE
THAN ANYONE ELSE,

477
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:20,547
HAS SEEN THE TOLL THAT
IT HAS TAKEN ON ME.

478
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,091
-AND I TOLD YOU...
-AND I UNDER...I UNDERSTAND.

479
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,260
I AGREE THAT I SHOULD
NOT SHELTER YOU

480
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:25,594
FROM MAKING
HARD DECISIONS,

481
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,471
BUT YOU WANT TO TALK
IRONY? FINE.

482
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:33,019
YOU ARE WILLING TO
SELL YOUR SOUL

483
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,189
TO DESTROY A THREAT
THAT I CREATED...

484
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,233
AND...

485
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,069
I...

486
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,403
ONE OF THE REASONS I FELL

487
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,947
IN LOVE WITH YOU
IS BECAUSE YOU WERE
ALWAYS WILLING

488
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:49,118
TO DO WHAT WAS RIGHT,
NO MATTER WHAT THE COST,

489
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,704
EVEN IF IT'S
UNBEARABLY HARD.

490
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:56,250
IT'S WHAT MAKES YOU YOU.

491
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:02,631
SO HOW CAN I BE
ANY DIFFERENT?

492
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:06,219
YOU'VE SACRIFICED
YOUR SOUL FOR THE TEAM

493
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,262
AND FOR THE CITY
AND FOR ME.

494
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,016
YOU DON'T...

495
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:15,228
HAVE TO CARRY
THAT BURDEN ANY LONGER.

496
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,606
LET ME DO IT.

497
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,651
FELICITY, I...

498
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,615
I CAN'T.

499
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,371
THEN YOU'LL HAVE
TO STOP ME.

500
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:43,881
THIS FACILITY HAS
8 INGRESS POINTS.

501
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,508
I'VE GOT 6-MAN TEAMS
STATIONED AT EACH,

502
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,927
PERIMETER SQUADS
KEEPING WATCH,

503
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,469
AND DRONES FLYING
SURVEILLANCE.

504
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,097
HELIX HAS TO BE READY
FOR ALL OF THAT.

505
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,057
THAT'S WHY
WE'RE HERE.

506
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:55,351
ADDED SUPPORT
AND THE ELEMENT
OF SURPRISE.

507
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:56,685
YOU THINK FELICITY
WILL BE SURPRISED THAT

508
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:58,396
WE'RE TRYING TO
STOP HER? HEH.

509
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,231
ACTUALLY, I AM KIND OF
SURPRISED.

510
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:01,732
I MEAN, YOU AND HER
HAVE A HISTORY.

511
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,650
JUST KIND OF LIKE,
"OH, WE'RE AGAINST
EACH OTHER."

512
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,403
LET'S HAVE YOU
AND DINAH PATROL
THE SOUTHWEST.

513
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,820
STAY ON COMMS, OK?

514
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,322
-UH, QUICK QUESTION.
-MM-HMM.

515
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,532
WHAT DO WE DO
IF SHE SHOWS UP TONIGHT?

516
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:15,955
WE STOP HER.

517
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,297
LOGISTICS CALCULATES
A 46% LIKELIHOOD

518
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,006
THEY'LL TRY TO BREACH
THROUGH HERE.

519
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:29,176
OK. THEN WE'LL BE
READY FOR THEM.

520
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,846
WE'RE NOT EXPECTING
HELIX FOR ANOTHER
7 MINUTES,

521
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,433
SO WOULD YOU LIKE TO
USE THAT TIME TO TELL
ME WHAT I'VE DONE

522
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,517
THAT'S GOT YOU
SO PISSED OFF?

523
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,771
[SIGHS]

524
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:43,399
LYLA, I'M NOT PISSED OFF.

525
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:45,818
I AM CONCERNED.

526
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,820
WHAT DID FELICITY MEAN
WHEN SHE MADE

527
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:51,031
THAT CRACK ABOUT YOU
CROSSING A LINE?

528
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,950
I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN
TO FATHOM THE AMOUNT

529
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,661
OF CRAP THAT HELIX HAS
PUT INTO FELICITY'S
HEAD, JOHNNY.

530
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,456
BUT, LYLA, HOLDING
CAYDEN JAMES WITHOUT
DUE PROCESS,

531
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,166
THAT'S NOT
A BUNCH OF CRAP.

532
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:03,294
CAYDEN JAMES IS
20 TIMES MORE DANGEROUS
THAN SNOWDEN.

533
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:05,587
WE CAUGHT HIM TRYING
TO HACK AN ARGUS
TRANSPONDER.

534
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,215
IF HE GOT IN, EVERY
NOC AGENT WE HAVE
COULD BE AT RISK.

535
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,592
THAT SOUNDS A WHOLE LOT
LIKE AMANDA WALLER.

536
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,678
WALLER'S DECISIONS SEEM
A LOT LESS WRONG

537
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,680
FROM THIS SIDE
OF THE DESK, JOHNNY.

538
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,890
YOU CAN'T JUDGE ME
FOR THAT.

539
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,642
I'M NOT JUDGING.

540
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,105
I'M JUST WORRIED.

541
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:26,442
FELICITY SMOAK IS ONE
OF THE BEST PEOPLE
I'VE EVER KNOWN,

542
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:28,486
AND SHE'S GONE
OVER TO THE DARK SIDE.

543
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,449
I DON'T WANT THAT
TO HAPPEN TO MY WIFE.

544
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,671
ALENA: I'VE DONE A LOT
OF ILLEGAL THINGS,

545
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,216
BUT NONE OF THEM HAVE
REQUIRED HEAVY WEAPONRY

546
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,468
OR ANY WEAPONRY.

547
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,886
YOU KNOW, I FOUND
THE TRANSITION
BETWEEN HACKER

548
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,471
TO VIGILANTE TO BE

549
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:57,264
SURPRISINGLY
STRAIGHTFORWARD.

550
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,308
YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT.

551
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,060
BESIDES, YOU HAVE
ENOUGH FIREPOWER HERE
TO INVADE RUSSIA.

552
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,769
WELL, HOPEFULLY,
WE WON'T HAVE TO.

553
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,022
THINK WE MIGHT.

554
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,648
THEY KNOW WE'RE COMING.

555
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,566
I'M NOT WORRIED.

556
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:10,528
IN CASE YOU NEED THEM.

557
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,988
NO.

558
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,698
I MEAN, EVEN IF WE DO,
I'M NOT USING THAT.

559
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,116
ARGUS WILL HAVE GUNS.

560
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:18,118
I THOUGHT YOU SAID NO ONE
WAS GONNA GET HURT.

561
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,621
IF WE DO THIS RIGHT,
NO ONE WILL.

562
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:22,956
WAIT FOR MY SIGNAL.

563

[DOOR OPENS,
QUENTIN WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY]

564

RENE: WHAT'S
SO IMPORTANT, HOSS?

565
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,092
I WAS GONNA CALL
IT A NIGHT.

566
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,970
DADDY!

567
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,722
SWEETHEART.

568
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,140
I TOLD YOU.

569
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:41,599
HEY. YOU'RE NOT
THE ONLY ONE AROUND HERE

570
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,227
THAT DOESN'T LISTEN
TO ORDERS.

571
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:46,855
WHO'S HE?

572
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,900
UH, THAT'S, UM,
QUENTIN, QUENTIN LANCE,

573
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:54,196
DADDY'S FRIEND,
BUT I CALL HIM HOSS.

574
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:56,240
HE ARRANGED
THIS LITTLE VISIT.

575
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:58,951
THANK YOU, HOSS.

576
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:02,496
-I MISSED YOU.
-OH, I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,622
OH, I MISSED YOU MORE.

578
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,750
DANG, GIRL. YOU'RE
GETTING SO BIG.

579
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,919
LOOK AT YOU. I...
PRETTY SOON,

580
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,088
YOU'RE GONNA BE DRIVING
POPS TO THE GAMES.

581
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,839
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

582
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:16,427
TELL YOUR DADDY WHAT YOU'RE
DOING AT SCHOOL NOW, ZOE.

583
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:17,970
I MADE
THE HOCKEY TEAM!

584
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,679
WHAT?! NO WAY.

585
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:20,847
WHAT POSITION
YOU PLAYING?

586
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,016
-GOALIE.
-THAT'S MY GIRL.

587
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,810
JUST LIKE YOUR POPS.

588

AW. THAT'S SO GOOD.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

589
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,649
CAN WE GO HOME NOW?

590
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:42,161
I'M SORRY, SWEETHEART,
BUT NOT TODAY.

591
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,370
WHY?

592
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,375
SWEETHEART, THE LAST TIME
YOU WERE WITH ME,

593
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,336
YOU GOT HURT, BABY.

594
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,588
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

595
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,590
WHEN CAN I GO HOME
TO DADDY?

596
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:59,303
I DON'T KNOW,
SWEETHEART.

597
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:02,931
SOON, PEANUT.

598

HE'S GONNA TALK TO HIM

COME HOME WITH ME.

I PROMISE.

00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,319
OK? I PROMISE.

603
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,915
THOUGHT YOU WERE STANDING
POST WITH LYLA.

604
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,460
SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA
TO PUT SOME SPACE
BETWEEN US.

605
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:33,086
FELICITY ISN'T
THE ONLY LADY WHO THINKS

606
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,214
THE ENDS JUSTIFIES
THE MEANS.

607
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:38,050
WHEN LYLA
AND FELICITY SMOAK ARE
WILLING TO CROSS THE LINE...

608
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,969
MAKES YOU WONDER
IF THERE EVEN IS
ONE, RIGHT?

609
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:42,596
LYLA ON COMMS:
