1
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,471
Mr. White?

2
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,473
Hello?

3
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:22,124
Mr. White,
the car's been dealt with, sir.

4
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,795
No one tailed you?

5
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:30,882
No, I stayed off the main streets
and kept checking, so...

6
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,429
Joe ask any questions?

7
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:40,350
I told him RV job, just like you said,
and he totally knew.

8
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:52,487
It's pretty cool the way they do that.
They just turn a car into a cube.

9
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:10,589
So should we deal
with this other thing now?

10
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,224
Yeah.

11
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,895
Sure.

12
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,288
- I don't want to talk about this.
- Okay.

13
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,749
It had to be done.

14
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,168
Okay.

15
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,089
All right.

16
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,067
I need to talk to you.

17
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:13,694
In private.

18
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:22,953
So, what's the story?

19
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,871
You get to Mike?

20
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,624
He get out safe?

21
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,252
He's gone.

22
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,046
All right.

23
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:36,717
Well, what about those nine guys in jail?

24
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,636
I mean, they got no reason
not to talk now.

25
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,430
So, what do we do?

26
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,641
"We"? Who's "we"?

27
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,311
There is no "we," Jesse.

28
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,689
I'm the only vote left,

29
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,816
and I'll handle it.

30
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:03,260
{\an8}My client will supply information
relating to the organization

31
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:07,139
{\an8}distribution and production of Fring's
methamphetamine enterprise.

32
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:10,976
{\an8}We expect all charges to be dropped,
and Dennis not only walks out of here

33
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,510
{\an8}a free man,
but also receives blanket immunity.

34
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,349
For what he'll be furnishing,
this deal is plenty fair.

35
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:26,909
{\an8}Best I'd be willing to do
is queen for a day and reduced charges.

36
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,118
{\an8}All charges dropped.

37
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:31,580
{\an8}Queen for a day and a five-k.
That's the best you're gonna get.

38
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:33,707
{\an8}No way. Guys, come on.

39
00:05:33,874 --> 00:05:36,001
{\an8}You can be a fairy princess,
for all I care.

40
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,461
{\an8}Where you going?

41
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:40,978
{\an8}Shopping for someone who can tell me
something I don't already know.

42
00:05:41,131 --> 00:05:43,008
Hey, hey.

43
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,636
I got plenty you don't know.

44
00:05:46,595 --> 00:05:48,639
You seem a little confused.

45
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,349
This here is a buyer's market.

46
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:54,645
I got eight other assholes just like you,
four of them within 100 feet from here.

47
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:58,190
I also got Dan the lawyer, who'll give me
the money and Ehrmantraut.

48
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:01,360
So settle in, Dennis.
Enjoy your new home.

49
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:03,946
I'm gonna go rattle some cages.

50
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,908
{\an8}- So?
- Maybe you should order something.

51
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:53,162
{\an8}- Do you want a coffee or something?
- Not just now.

52
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:57,579
{\an8}I think this would play better
if you ordered something.

53
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,961
{\an8}I think this will play just fine,
and I'm not thirsty.

54
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:03,422
{\an8}So let's take a look at the list.

55
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:08,908
Lydia, you've come all this way.
You do have the list?

56
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,138
{\an8}- Yes, I have it.
- Good.

57
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,182
{\an8}It's just not written down.

58
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:17,061
{\an8}- And why is that?
- It's in my head. Safer there.

59
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:18,520
{\an8}I see.

60
00:07:18,687 --> 00:07:21,231
{\an8}Then I suggest you pick up a pen.

61
00:07:21,398 --> 00:07:22,566
{\an8}Not just yet.

62
00:07:24,985 --> 00:07:28,572
It was my understanding
that attending to these nine names

63
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,574
was precisely what you wanted.

64
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,160
Ten names now.
Ten, counting the lawyer.

65
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,579
Yes. Ten, counting the lawyer.

66
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:41,710
So, what, am I not tying up loose ends
for our mutual benefit?

67
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:44,796
You're tying up loose ends,
and I don't wanna be one of them.

68
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,091
I give you that list,
I've served my purpose.

69
00:07:47,257 --> 00:07:49,957
Then maybe I'm just one more person
who knows too much.

70
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,265
So you put that list in my hands,
and in your mind

71
00:07:55,432 --> 00:08:00,062
I immediately just murder you,
just right here in this restaurant?

72
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,879
- No. Not right here. Of course.
- Here in this public place, immediately?

73
00:08:03,982 --> 00:08:05,525
{\an8}- That is not...
- Listen, Lydia.

74
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:10,280
{\an8}You made me promise on my children's
lives that I guaranteed your safety.

75
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:11,990
From Mike.

76
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:14,660
You guaranteed I'd be safe from Mike.

77
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:20,165
{\an8}There's no way he'd ever go for this,
you getting rid of his guys.

78
00:08:20,332 --> 00:08:24,920
You wouldn't be doing this, the names,
if Mike were still a factor.

79
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:32,386
Yeah. That's what I thought.

80
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:38,058
What do you want, exactly?

81
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:41,228
{\an8}Because if you don't want
to give me that list

82
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:44,231
{\an8}then I've truly got no use for you.

83
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,778
{\an8}I can grow your business exponentially.

84
00:08:49,945 --> 00:08:51,113
{\an8}Just give me the list.

85
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,241
{\an8}I can do that by helping you
expand into a larger

86
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,995
{\an8}highly active, highly profitable
marketplace.

87
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:01,165
{\an8}What do you know
about the Czech Republic?

88
00:09:02,332 --> 00:09:03,625
{\an8}The Czech Republic?

89
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:07,462
Did you know there's a higher demand
for meth there than anywhere in Europe?

90
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:09,631
Five percent of its 10 million people

91
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:12,384
which is roughly the population
of the Southwest

92
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:16,096
from western Texas to Phoenix,
are using meth.

93
00:09:16,263 --> 00:09:19,433
You keep your market here,
but by adding overseas sales

94
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,935
you can more than double
your current profits.

95
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,898
{\an8}And I checked. The average purity
is only about 60 percent.

96
00:09:26,064 --> 00:09:29,359
{\an8}They've never seen
anything like your product.

97
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:32,154
You'll blow their hair back.

98
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:38,160
{\an8}Shipping internationally
seems like courting disaster.

99
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,452
Not if you're Madrigal.

100
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:42,456
Madrigal is under investigation
by the DEA.

101
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,458
The restaurant division, mostly.

102
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,962
We've got 46,000 employees
spread across 14 divisions.

103
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:53,759
And once Mike's people are no longer
a factor, things should tidy up nicely.

104
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,719
This is what I do, you understand?

105
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,346
Move things from point A to point B
all over the globe.

106
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,807
One-point-two million
metric tons a month,

107
00:10:00,974 --> 00:10:05,979
and all of it right at my fingertips,
a laptop click away.

108
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:09,316
The Czech Republic...

109
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,694
{\an8}- Who's on the other end?
- People I ship to regularly.

110
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,947
{\an8}People I've worked with for years.
Professional and very amenable.

111
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:18,659
{\an8}I'm very careful who I work with.

112
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:30,003
And if this is such a slam dunk,
then why didn't you pitch it to Fring?

113
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:34,007
I did. He said yes. We were
in the final stages of working it out

114
00:10:34,174 --> 00:10:35,634
when somebody killed him.

115
00:10:40,597 --> 00:10:45,102
You don't think Gus Fring built
his distribution network all by himself.

116
00:10:46,436 --> 00:10:50,899
There are considerable advantages
to diversification of distribution

117
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,320
like putting 6000 miles
between you and your product.

118
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,202
At 25 pounds a week, I'm estimating
you'll gross about 2 million.

119
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:07,291
Give me 10 pounds to start,
and we'll see how it goes.

120
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,589
- All right.
- Now, with Fring

121
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:17,467
my end was gonna be 30 percent,
which I believe is more than fair.

122
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:19,803
- Okay.
- Trust me, if you do this...

123
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,307
Lydia, learn to take yes for an answer.

124
00:11:24,474 --> 00:11:27,060
Now, first things first.

125
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:02,971
Shake on it?

126
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:09,584
We're going to make
a lot of money together.

127
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:42,905
Todd, I think it's time
I meet your uncle.

128
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,241
No iron pile.

129
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:49,119
There's too many muscle-heads
flexing their shit. Too many eyes.

130
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,540
Okay, so no chow line, no yard.

131
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,250
Well, gonna keep it simple.

132
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,001
Pass-byes.

133
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:59,755
Yeah. Hallways,
shower room, cells.

134
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,507
The easy stuff.

135
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,885
I say we go with a riot.
Our boys get it done in a riot.

136
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,638
No, no, no. No chaos.

137
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:13,310
I don't want the goon squad rolling in
and stealing our shot, you know?

138
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:16,146
This has gotta be fast and quiet.

139
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,566
Just boom, boom, boom.

140
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,693
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

141
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,028
Surgical.

142
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,574
Surgical. That's what it's gotta be.

143
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,619
So how many guys we got at MDC?

144
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:35,291
Three, counting Shattuck.
And he makes the schedule now,

145
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,460
so we can put who we need
where we need them.

146
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,547
All right. So MDC's covered.
What about the rest?

147
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,549
We need G block in Valencia, right?

148
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,343
Our guy's on the night shift.

149
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,928
- Have him pull a double.
- No.

150
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,347
His supervisor's got
some hard-on about OT.

151
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,766
Have him switch with somebody.
Just get it done.

152
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,020
Regardless, you know, we got
enough guys in Valencia right now?

153
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,980
Might have to hire out.

154
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,482
You high?
Mix blood with <i>chuntaros?</i>

155
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,526
- No way.
- No.

156
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,365
There's no need. We got enough.

157
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:12,912
Hitters ain't the problem. It's that
short walking window after lunch.

158
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,081
Yeah. It's gonna be tight.

159
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,667
Real tight.

160
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:28,427
I gotta be straight with you, man.
Taking out all these guys is doable.

161
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:32,305
But hitting them in three separate jails
all within two minutes?

162
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,935
I mean, whacking bin Laden
wasn't this complicated.

163
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,733
Where do you suppose these come from?

164
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,277
I've seen this one before.

165
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,279
I wonder

166
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:51,492
are they all In some giant
warehouse someplace?

167
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,876
Hey.

168
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,506
It can be done,
just not the way you want it.

169
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,402
It can be done exactly how I want it.

170
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:30,322
The only question is,
are you the man to do it?

171
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,041
Figure it out.

172
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,586
That's what I'm paying you for.

173
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,552
Yo, what's going on, man?
What's that alarm?

174
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,262
What's happening?

175
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,768
What are you doing, man?
No, man, please!

176
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,687
No, man! Help me!

177
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,523
Help me! Help!

178
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,275
Help me!

179
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:22,077
Ball came in my direction,
batter wouldn't even bother running.

180
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,748
Excuse me a second.
Couple more photos.

181
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,097
Yes?

182
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,849
<i>It's done.</i>

183
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,194
{\an8}<i>New details have emerged
in the spate of jail deaths</i>

184
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,738
{\an8}<i>that rocked central New Mexico
three days ago.</i>

185
00:19:58,905 --> 00:20:01,992
<i>As of yet, no names of victims
have been released,</i>

186
00:20:02,158 --> 00:20:05,620
<i>but authorities continue to investigate
what appears to be</i>

187
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,373
<i>a carefully coordinated
sequence of attacks</i>

188
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:13,003
<i>that occurred within minutes in
three different correctional facilities...</i>

189
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:15,171
- Is it okay if I turn this off?
- Oh, sure.

190
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,173
I don't want the news on right now.

191
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,594
Hank just pulled up,
and he's not in the best mood.

192
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,888
- Oh, all right. I'll get out of your hair.
- Okay.

193
00:20:24,764 --> 00:20:26,308
Hi, honey.

194
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:30,478
Dinner will be in about an hour.

195
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,983
And I thought we could have
that chicken you like.

196
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,862
- Or we could order Chinese.
- Sure.

197
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,780
Here we go.

198
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,702
That fun? Play with your toys?

199
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:49,039
I'll see you in a little bit, okay?
See you in a little bit.

200
00:20:49,205 --> 00:20:51,499
Hey, Hank.
I was just getting ready to leave.

201
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:53,126
Something to drink?

202
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,129
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

203
00:20:56,671 --> 00:20:57,964
Perfect.

204
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,091
Hi.

205
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,553
- Rocks, right?
- Rocks, yes.

206
00:22:10,578 --> 00:22:13,540
Been thinking about this summer job
I used to have.

207
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,501
Oh, yeah?

208
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,214
Back in college, I'd spend my days...

209
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,844
marking trees in the woods with this...

210
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,555
This orange spray can.

211
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:32,308
Marking trees?

212
00:22:32,475 --> 00:22:35,227
Yeah. Crews would come in later,

213
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:38,356
and find the trees I tagged
and cut them down.

214
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:48,199
First, you go in and you mark locations
for skid trails and landings.

215
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:53,079
Then you choose specific trees
all within a selected grid.

216
00:22:56,624 --> 00:22:58,626
Every day

217
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,795
I'd go back

218
00:23:01,504 --> 00:23:02,964
hike in

219
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,134
pick up where I left off.

220
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,974
Oh, it sounds nice

221
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,351
being out in the woods all day.

222
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,729
No, it wasn't so great.

223
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,607
I got sunburned.
There were mosquitoes.

224
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,568
I just wanted to make a few bucks.
Buy beer.

225
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:29,772
Been thinking about that job
more and more lately.

226
00:23:31,117 --> 00:23:33,787
Maybe I should've enjoyed it more.

227
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:37,916
Tagging trees is a lot better
than chasing monsters.

228
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,099
I used to love to go camping.

229
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,290
- This way.
- Here, baby girl. Come see your brother.

230
00:27:48,374 --> 00:27:50,293
There you go, sweetie. That's it.

231
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,503
Oh, my God! Look at her go!

232
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:56,299
- Good job! Good job!
- Over here. Peekaboo. This way.

233
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,550
Let's go see your brother.
Let's get him.

234
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,721
Where'd you go?
I can't see you. Where'd you go?

235
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,931
There you are!

236
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:08,102
You're really good with her.

237
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,561
Come here, my baby girl.

238
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,607
You're gonna be a handful,
aren't you? Yeah.

239
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,693
Mama's gonna get her exercise.

240
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,908
Hey, do you wanna watch a movie?

241
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:25,036
Hey, Louis.

242
00:28:26,412 --> 00:28:28,081
One moment.

243
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,959
Nothing. What's up?

244
00:28:36,422 --> 00:28:38,382
Oh, well.

245
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:47,725
It's so nice to see you smile again.

246
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:51,312
I mean, you seem good.

247
00:28:52,396 --> 00:28:54,565
Yeah. I'm hanging in there.

248
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,528
To see you laugh like that just now...

249
00:28:59,737 --> 00:29:02,824
It's such an improvement,
don't you think?

250
00:29:04,408 --> 00:29:07,286
I don't... I don't really...

251
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:15,211
We've been thinking

252
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:18,673
Hank and I, that it may be time

253
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,634
to take the kids home.

254
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,890
It's been almost three months, right?

255
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,809
Almost three?

256
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,440
Does Hank not want...?

257
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:39,193
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, God. No. No.

258
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,155
Hank's crazy for these kids.
You know that.

259
00:29:42,321 --> 00:29:44,699
It goes without saying,
we love having them.

260
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,466
And we're always here for you,

261
00:29:46,617 --> 00:29:49,996
and wanna help you any way that we can.

262
00:29:50,913 --> 00:29:52,290
But...

263
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,587
We're starting to worry

264
00:29:57,795 --> 00:30:00,464
that maybe...

265
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,511
Maybe we're enabling you.

266
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:12,310
Sweetie, you've had a lot on your plate,

267
00:30:12,476 --> 00:30:16,522
and you and Walt have had a lot...

268
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:20,610
So much to contend with.

269
00:30:20,776 --> 00:30:23,876
I'm so proud of you for going to therapy.
You know that, right?

270
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,532
It can be so helpful, such a good tool.

271
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:30,703
And I'm very, very proud of you,

272
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,496
but I...

273
00:30:32,663 --> 00:30:34,582
We...

274
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,295
Maybe at this point

275
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:43,883
the best way to help repair the family

276
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:49,347
would be to repair the family, you know?

277
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,709
Take a drive with me.

278
00:32:19,645 --> 00:32:21,689
Here. I'll get it.

279
00:32:26,902 --> 00:32:28,446
Walt.

280
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,677
This is it.

281
00:32:53,387 --> 00:32:55,890
This is what you've been working for.

282
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:02,980
I rented this place and I started
bringing it here because

283
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,233
I didn't know what else to do.

284
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,528
I gave up counting it.
I mean, I had to.

285
00:33:09,695 --> 00:33:13,240
It was just so much, so fast.

286
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:15,534
I tried weighing it.

287
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:20,498
I figured one bill of any denomination
weighs a gram.

288
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:24,752
There are 454 grams to a pound, but...

289
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:33,386
There's a variety of denominations, so...

290
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,098
How much is this?

291
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,602
I have no earthly idea.

292
00:33:42,978 --> 00:33:44,980
I truly don't.

293
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,733
I just stack it up

294
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,404
keep it dry, spray it for silverfish.

295
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,325
There is more money here

296
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:59,495
than we could spend in 10 lifetimes.

297
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:04,792
I certainly can't launder it,
not with a hundred car washes.

298
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,297
Walt

299
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:15,136
I want my kids back.

300
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:20,891
I want my life back.

301
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,394
Please tell me.

302
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,856
How much is enough?

303
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:31,193
How big does this pile have to be?

304
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,441
Shit!

305
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,058
Hi.

306
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:26,852
Hey.

307
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:32,357
I hope I'm not disturbing you
or anything.

308
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:33,942
I tried calling, but...

309
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:37,362
Yeah. No, I tossed all my burners.

310
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,504
And you didn't answer your home line.

311
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:41,575
It's disconnected.

312
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:43,702
Well, unplugged.

313
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:47,164
I mean, did you leave a message, or...?

314
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:49,791
No.

315
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,338
So, what's up?

316
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:02,012
No, I was just in the neighborhood,
so I thought I'd drop by and say hello.

317
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,603
You wanna come in, or...?

318
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,899
Sure. Thanks.

319
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:30,373
You know, I'd offer you
a beer or something,

320
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:35,253
- but, you know, I'm out.
- No, no. No, I'm fine, thanks.

321
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,840
You didn't wind up moving, I see.

322
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:40,926
Didn't have to.

323
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:43,637
Saul told me what you did.

324
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:50,936
Anyways, I'm not in jail.

325
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:54,564
You aren't either, so there you go.

326
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:59,820
There was no other option, Jesse.
It had to be done.

327
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,535
I'm not coming back.

328
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:09,412
I know.

329
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:14,668
So why are you here, exactly?

330
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:24,928
It's funny, I...

331
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:27,764
I saw a Bounder the other day.

332
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:29,683
- Bounder?
- Yeah.

333
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:32,644
Our RV? A Bounder?

334
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:38,066
Oh, you saw the same one as ours?

335
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:41,319
Yeah. Well, I mean,
within a couple of years, I guess.

336
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:42,821
Early '80s.

337
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:46,366
It was certainly in a lot better shape
than our old hunk of junk.

338
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,827
Much nicer paint job.

339
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:52,581
No bullet holes in the door.

340
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,959
Yeah. That thing
was a nightmare, huh?

341
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:59,504
Yeah. It was primitive.

342
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:04,301
You know, whenever
I hit a red light, I used to pray

343
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,678
it wouldn't crap out on me.

344
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,346
Yeah.

345
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:11,975
And then, suddenly,
it would sometimes have that...

346
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:14,603
That screeching sound
just out of the blue

347
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,269
like we hit a pack of cats.

348
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:19,774
Power-steering belt.
That's what that was.

349
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:21,902
You know, I always had this...

350
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,987
This whole system.

351
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:26,489
Strategy to not let it idle too low.

352
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:29,951
Remember that time we ran out of gas
coming back from a cook?

353
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,995
The gauge. It always said half-full.

354
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:36,374
You walked three miles with a jerrican
while I waited on the side of the road

355
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:39,878
praying the whole time
that no cop would show up

356
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,630
no Good Samaritan.

357
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,548
God.

358
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,675
We had money.

359
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:47,552
Why'd we keep it?

360
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,805
Why did we have to have
the world's shittiest RV?

361
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,891
Inertia?

362
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:54,726
Yeah.

363
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,394
Yeah.

364
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,230
Inertia.

365
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:15,705
So, hey, you know, I gotta get going.

366
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,331
- Me too.
- I'm meeting friends.

367
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,709
I gotta get going as well.

368
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,968
I left something for you.

369
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:04,564
Hey.

370
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:19,120
I'm out.

371
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,796
I'm out.

372
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:18,846
With some big earrings,
it could be really nice.

373
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,349
- Perhaps some big hoops.
- I do indeed.

374
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:24,268
I feel like I want to mix it up
with my hair this summer.

375
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,771
- I don't know, like colors...
- I don't know. Coins.

376
00:43:26,855 --> 00:43:28,857
Did you have a coin collection?
Did you?

377
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,609
I've heard it's very therapeutic.

378
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,988
Coins and baseball cards.
Those were the ones.

379
00:43:35,155 --> 00:43:37,531
You can play around with it,
take them in and out.

380
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,409
Not enough hours in the day, right?

381
00:43:39,576 --> 00:43:42,245
- There's not enough hours.
- My hairstylist told me

382
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:44,581
to take prenatal vitamins.

383
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,207
For your hair?

384
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:48,585
He said they work, so I figured why not?

385
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:52,547
Oh, Flynn, could you put some more
sunscreen on Holly?

386
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:54,299
Yeah. Is it over there?

387
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:56,092
- Yeah, it's right here.
- Okay.

388
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:59,888
- Especially for a home brew, though.
- Paba-free. That's good.

389
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,765
- I don't know why it would be bad.
- Yeah. Me neither.

390
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:06,019
Oh, do you...? I used to squeeze
lemon juice in my hair.

391
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:07,395
You remember that?

392
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:10,315
You wanted to be a beach bum so badly.

393
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:11,983
I did.

394
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,152
You and your stiff hair.

395
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:18,114
- Stiff? Whose stiffy? What?
- Hey, hey.

396
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:20,991
I was interested
to see you get into that.

397
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,995
- It's like chemistry.
- Borage oil is supposed to be good.

398
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:26,164
- Better than flaxseed?
- I don't know.

399
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:30,460
- That's cool. I like your style.
- There is no Christmas.

400
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:33,713
- Maybe I should brew up a batch.
- Schraderbrau?

401
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,048
- Yeah.
- I vote yes.

402
00:44:35,215 --> 00:44:37,926
- I second that.
- Well, there you go. It's unanimous.

403
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:41,971
Well, who am I to fly in the face
of public demand, right?

404
00:44:45,225 --> 00:44:47,185
All right.

405
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,439
Anybody want anything?
You want anything?

406
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:55,026
- No, I'm good. I'm good, thank you.
- Yeah? All right.

407
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,153
Does it look glossier?

408
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:59,197
Do I have a halo?

409
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:01,407
- How's she doing?
- She's good.

410
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:04,786
Yeah? Try not to put any
of the sunscreen on her fingers.

411
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:13,688
<i>"To W.W. My star, my perfect silence."</i>

412
00:46:13,855 --> 00:46:16,065
<i>W.W.</i>

413
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:18,943
I mean, who do you figure that is?

414
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,820
Woodrow Wilson?

415
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:23,573
Willy Wonka?

416
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:27,910
Walter White?

417
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:32,540
You got me.
