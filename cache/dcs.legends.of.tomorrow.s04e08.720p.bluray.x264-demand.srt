00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,713
<i>Previously on</i>
Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,599
I couldn't send Neron to hell
without sending Des down with him.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,718
<i>I killed the man I loved,
and for what?</i>

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,070
John, you have to stop this.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,800
If Desmond isn't dragged to hell,
and you don't join the Legends,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,354
<i>the effects could be cataclysmic.</i>

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,240
<i>History be bloody damned.</i>

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,880
I really care about you.

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,634
This thing between us,
it isn't real, it never was.

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,440
Uh...

11
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:28,921
- What's that?
- I think John just broke time.

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,194
Oi, Z, check this out.

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,480
I got my powers back.

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,440
Zari?

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,196
Constantine did it! He changed
the timeline back in New Orleans.

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,396
He saved old Des.

17
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,720
Oh.

18
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:51,475
Unfortunately, I've no idea
why you're a cat, Z.

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,313
Oh, quit your whinging.

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,513
I know it's a pretty raw deal for you,

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,639
especially 'cause, well,
who knows what they put in cat food.

22
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,352
On the plus side, you are cute as hell.

23
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,437
Z, it has been an experience.

24
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,112
Now, I'm gonna set the autopilot
to take you back to the <i>Waverider.</i>

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,353
But first, we're gonna
drop me off somewhere fabulous.

26
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,872
Hope y'all are thirsty for champagne,

27
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,199
because I'm feeling a little bubbly.

28
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,470
Hello, Red.

29
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,313
Ms. Monroe. How's Lady Luck treating ya?

30
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,471
Ooh!

31
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,274
Hey, Red, it's me.
Charlie, the shapeshifter.

32
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,953
Tears of St. Patrick.

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,634
What are you doing here?

34
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,916
I haven't seen you since
we escaped from that prison.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,673
Yeah. Hey, listen, mate.

36
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,960
You gotta stop
doing your leprechaun magic

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,600
so out in the open like this, all right?

38
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,396
I do this all the time. These humans,
they don't notice anything.

39
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Watch.

40
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,440
- Lucky 11. Winner!
- Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

41
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,520
- Quit doing that.
- But I'm just having a little fun!

42
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,753
What's got you so worried?
The magic police?

43
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,960
They're called the Legends

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,376
and I'm just trying to stay
off their radar for a little while.

45
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,880
Sounds to me like you're scared.

46
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,510
What, of them?

47
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,056
No. They're not dangerous,

48
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,595
they're just annoying
little Boy Scouts, you know.

49
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,839
Reach for the sky, you filthy animals.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,753
Pretty please.

51
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,315
He asked nicely.

52
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,230
Greetings, gentlemen.

53
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,597
Ah, the leprechaun!

54
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,996
You fellows play?

55
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,680
Uh...

56
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,760
No.

57
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,910
Oh, my God! Why did you do that?

58
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,879
Marilyn Monroe! I am killing it
at historical-figure bingo.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,559
All right, everyone, calm down.

60
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,917
We just saved your butts from
a very dangerous magical creature.

61
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,989
Who are you guys?

62
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,311
Hi. Nate Heywood, monster hunter.

63
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,976
Just want you ladies to know
you're in good hands.

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,471
Man, Garima is gonna flip when she
hears we met Marilyn Monroe.

65
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,392
You think a murderous alien queen

66
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,995
that sprang to life from
Mick's fantasies is into Marilyn?

67
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,080
Yes.

68
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
Hmm.

69
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,152
What is up with these guys?

70
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,429
Gideon, any messages while we were gone?

71
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,200
You missed calls
from Barry Allen,

72
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,913
Oliver Queen and Kara Zor-El.

73
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,754
Sounds like the annual crossover.

74
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,358
Ugh! Yeah, that's gonna be a hard pass.

75
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,154
Oh, Zari.

76
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,835
Well, I'm glad to see that
you made it back to the ship okay.

77
00:04:40,921 --> 00:04:43,833
Okay, I hear you.
You're still mad at me.

78
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,716
Listen. I really need your help.

79
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,669
All right, yeah. I can see that being
a cat is your main concern right now,

80
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,197
but I still don't know why you're a cat.

81
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,759
Ms. Tomaz was turned into a cat

82
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,877
during the team's encounter
with a Fairy Godmother.

83
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,795
Whoa, Gideon.
Your latest upgrade is smoking.

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,320
Thank you, Miss Jiwe.

85
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,520
Amaya Jiwe. Yeah. That's me.

86
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,119
And may I say, your new upgrade
and accent are also smoking.

87
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,240
- Oh, Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

88
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:13,577
You know, I'm just trying something out.

89
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,793
Yeah, okay. One last question.

90
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,952
Why are the Legends
homicidal wankers now?

91
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,280
If you're referring to
the Custodians of the Chronology,

92
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,398
their policy toward magical creatures
has been "shoot on sight"

93
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,752
since their disastrous
encounter at Woodstock.

94
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,038
Right. Thanks, Gideon.

95
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,958
Must be fallout from
Constantine altering the timeline.

96
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,959
Right. This zero-tolerance bollocks
ends now.

97
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,113
Hey, people!

98
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,677
I have an announcement to make.

99
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,718
Please, gather around.

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Come listen.

101
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,280
So, I know our "shoot first,
ask questions never" policy

102
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,994
has led to some

103
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,720
interesting decorations,
but it's time to change.

104
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,635
From now on, we are going to
capture the magical creatures

105
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,360
and bring them to the Bureau
like we are supposed to.

106
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,796
Why are you looking at me weird?

107
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,756
Well, it just seems like a shame
to change our policy now.

108
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,914
Considering we're so close
to capturing our white whale.

109
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,680
That's a <i>Moby Dick</i> reference.

110
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,314
And what is your white whale?

111
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,520
The only creature we haven't
been able to capture

112
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,632
because it's quite elusive.

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,960
Maybe because it has
the ability to change shape!

114
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,040
- Shapeshifter!
- How dare you step on this ship

115
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,554
and pretend to be our dead captain.

116
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,510
What?

117
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,157
- Wait. Sara's dead?
- Yeah.

118
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,959
That's why we know you're not Sara.

119
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,080
- Is that why you guys are like this?
- Like what?

120
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,480
Hunting down magical creatures
like it's a...

121
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,397
Yes!

122
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,670
Damn it, Garima!

123
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,840
I called dibs on killing
the shapeshifter last week!

124
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,790
You know what, he did.

125
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,754
Remember when we were
roasting that little baby gryphon?

126
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,479
Which was delicious, by the way.

127
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,040
But you guys got into an argument

128
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,476
about who actually killed it,
so, then Ray got upset.

129
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,520
He was like,
"Hey, I wanna kill the shapeshifter."

130
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,794
It heals itself. It turns into Amaya.
This is not good!

131
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,520
- Kill her again!
- I get to kill her this time!

132
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,596
After her!

133
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:22,757
Zari?

134
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,280
Oh, bollocks.

135
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,559
They've become maniacs.

136
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,916
Okay, this is bad.

137
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,278
What, Constantine? Yes!

138
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,512
This is his fault.
He needs to help us fix this.

139
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,795
But where is he?

140
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,915
Nice work, Zari Cat.

141
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,637
Can't very well walk
around here looking like this.

142
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,437
Oh, hush. It's still me,
despite the insane grin on my face.

143
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,029
I don't remember
there being a memorial here.

144
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,473
"Sara Lance. Struck down by a unicorn."

145
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Bollocks.

146
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,233
Gary, you're late.

147
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,033
Uh, sorry, Mr. Heywood.

148
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,800
My cat-sitter quit on me, so...

149
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,151
This place is going to hell
in a handbasket.

150
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,390
Yeah, it's my bad, sir.

151
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,676
Look, the Custodians of the Chronology

152
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,190
just destroyed a freaking leprechaun,
all right?

153
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,794
You know what? If you see them,

154
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,315
tell them they're getting
a scream-down from me.

155
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,359
One more thing, Mr. Heywood.

156
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,955
Have you seen
John Constantine around?

157
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
Is that a joke?

158
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,755
He's been in confinement for months!
You put him there.

159
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,560
Idiots!

160
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,555
This isn't the "when"
when I'm supposed to be.

161
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,554
<i>Johnny... Johnny...</i>

162
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,776
<i>No, the truth is
not the truth, all right?</i>

163
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,111
This is not the "when"
when I'm supposed to be.

164
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,476
<i>You should go.
This was real, Johnny.</i>

165
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,920
Reality is fractured,

166
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,476
but the pieces,
they speak to each other,

167
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,513
like light between broken mirrors.

168
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,514
John Constantine.

169
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,232
Confined for becoming dangerously
unstable after suspected time crimes.

170
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,154
Are you real? Do you exist? Because
it's really hard to tell these days.

171
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,278
Yeah, bloke's gone cuckoo.

172
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
Ha!

173
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,553
I sense a familiar face.

174
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,517
Who is that? Z?

175
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,870
Z, is that you?

176
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,600
Why the transmogrification?
Let's get this sorted out.

177
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Ooh!

178
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:14,321
Yeah, all right, I'm sorry,

179
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,030
but this is the only way
that you will know your true self.

180
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,118
Oh, finally.

181
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,676
Hairball.

182
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,917
Because of you dicks,
I have been a cat for so long.

183
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,317
Do you know where this tongue has been?

184
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,276
Places.

185
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,056
I wasn't sure that reversal was
gonna work, because I've been feeling

186
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,436
a little, you know, insane lately.

187
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,398
Yeah. You only have yourself to blame.

188
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,756
Wait, what?

189
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,072
You created a time wave when
you changed your past with Desmond.

190
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,200
Because you're the epicenter,

191
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,955
your experience of
this timeline and that one

192
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,440
both exist in your brain.

193
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,394
Just give me a break here, right.

194
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,279
What you're trying to say
is that I broke time?

195
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,830
Yes. Back in New Orleans.

196
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,000
Sure, you don't have to live with
the guilt of damning Desmond,

197
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,077
but you also
never joined the Legends.

198
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,232
Without John's help with the
unicorn at Woodstock, Sara died,

199
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,279
which made the Legends into killers.

200
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,273
There's only one way to fix this...

201
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,960
We go back to Woodstock
and we save Sara.

202
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,190
- Yeah.
- No.

203
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,598
Guys, you're not listening to me.

204
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,679
You have to go to New Orleans
and set history back on track.

205
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,279
Whoa, whoa, Z, you're suggesting
a total reset of the timeline.

206
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,079
All we need is a surgical strike.

207
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,960
Now, if we save Sara,

208
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,556
then the Custodians of the Chronology
never exist.

209
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,031
I keep my powers,
Des is de-demoned. Bob's your uncle.

210
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,956
I'm sorry, guys. I have to stop you
before you make this any worse.

211
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,440
Ow!

212
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,950
Right, then.

213
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,669
I'm sorry, love.

214
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,992
Until you can learn
to stay out of my way,

215
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,838
then you are a cat.

216
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,200
In the mood for a prison break?

217
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,715
Yes, I am.

218
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,193
Is the coast clear?

219
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,954
How much of that did you hear?

220
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,550
Uh...

221
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,594
Nothing at all. Nothing about
breaking out or hacking history.

222
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,433
Please don't turn me into a cat.

223
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,200
Well, I didn't turn her into a cat.
I returned her to being a cat,

224
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,999
which is considerably easier,
believe me.

225
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,912
But if you gotta, maybe a calico.
And real fluffy.

226
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,316
Okay, I'm ready. Do it.

227
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,936
- What are we gonna do with her?
- I've no idea.

228
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,760
You don't have to do anything.
I want to help.

229
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,310
You do?

230
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,636
The Custodians of the Chronology
must be stopped.

231
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,518
They turned my Kaupe friend into a rug.

232
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,639
So, if you're trying to defeat them,
I want in.

233
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,856
Watch the bumps, yeah?

234
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,240
- Oi.
- Someone might hear you!

235
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,040
<i>Red alert!
The</i> Waverider <i>is landing. Red alert!</i>

236
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,199
Oh, man, the Custodians are here.
Could things get any worse?

237
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,717
Wait! Stop right there! Are you me?

238
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
Yes.

239
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,750
From the future.

240
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,877
Do I ever find love?
Or at least, my sunglasses?

241
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,993
- They might be in my other pants.
- Yes, Gary. All that, and more.

242
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,336
It's the Custodians.
Notify Mr. Heywood...

243
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,320
But right now,
I need you to delay the Custodians.

244
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,357
Okay! Oh, but be careful.

245
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,576
There's been reports of
a shapeshifter on the loose.

246
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,670
Yeah, I know that already.

247
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,037
Because I'm you
from the future, dummy.

248
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Okay, okay.

249
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,316
Come on.
We gotta find a place to hide.

250
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,637
Knock, knock. Anybody home?

251
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,056
Come on, hurry up.
Let me out of this thing.

252
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,513
Where are we?

253
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,280
This is Ava's office. But she's gone.

254
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,876
Gone, gone?

255
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,757
I'm right here, you idiots.

256
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,990
Dad.

257
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,512
We tracked a shapeshifter here,

258
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,120
so, we're gonna need you to stand down

259
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,078
and let us do our job
and bag it for you.

260
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,718
Your job, son, is to bring the
creatures back to the Bureau alive.

261
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,600
Not leave their insides
strewn through history.

262
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,640
It's called payback for what they did
to Sara, and don't get in our way.

263
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,909
Sharpie, what happened to you?

264
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,153
I'm allowed to grieve in my own way.

265
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,760
Why the hell are you out of your cell?

266
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,469
Oh, plans change, love.

267
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,392
Are you sure you're okay,
Director Sharpe?

268
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,636
I'm fine!

269
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,312
I'm just taking some time to get
my head together after Sara was...

270
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,590
Unicorned.

271
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,160
I'm really sorry about that.

272
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,114
Things are not as they seem.

273
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,920
- Amaya?
- No.

274
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,471
Well, it's a long story,
but time is... Well, broken.

275
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,360
What are you talking about?

276
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,631
You see, you're living
in a timeline that doesn't exist,

277
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,360
and we are from a timeline
where your hair is still blond.

278
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,640
Okay, I don't have time for this
timey-wimey crap...

279
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,080
No! No, this is the truth.

280
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,277
Now, listen.
The Custodians of the Chronology

281
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,736
are actually the Legends of Tomorrow,

282
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,433
and they're the good guys. Mostly.

283
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,240
Yeah. And the kicker is,
Sara is supposed to be alive.

284
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,235
Did you say Sara's alive?

285
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,596
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

286
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,076
I knew it!
I knew something was wrong.

287
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,352
I mean, I like the Indigo Girls,
but they should not be a way of life.

288
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,393
Then let's help them set things right.

289
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,714
What do you guys need from me?

290
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,757
Well, well, well. Look who's
helping our magical fugitive.

291
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,510
We were looking for you.

292
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,074
Got eyes on suspects.

293
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,637
Thought you might wanna have some fun.

294
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,600
I got 12 gauges of fun right here.

295
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,000
That's it.
I'm placing you all under arrest.

296
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,514
Shut your mouth, Pops.

297
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,280
Go!

298
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,920
Take cover.

299
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,920
Get them out of here!

300
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,074
I'll cover you. Go save Sara.

301
00:16:40,521 --> 00:16:41,977
Did they really
all just kill each other?

302
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Don't think about it.

303
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,959
We'll go back in time
and we'll fix things. We have to.

304
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,033
Target ahead. Arming the weapons now.

305
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,638
Is that what I think it is?

306
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,673
Twilight Sparkle come to life...

307
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,197
We didn't screw things up
for the better this year.

308
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,397
We screwed things up
for the more magical.

309
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,160
- Yes!
- Nice shot!

310
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,514
Who the hell is in the <i>Jumpship?</i>

311
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,992
Who cares? Mission accomplished.

312
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,960
And you guys thought
we needed Constantine.

313
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,278
Yeah, we saved Sara's life.
That should fix everything.

314
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
The Custodians should be back
to being the Legends,

315
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,274
and Zari should no longer be a cat.

316
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,776
All right, this might be
a crossed-wire thing in my brain,

317
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,712
but that is still a cat
sitting there, isn't it?

318
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,576
Killing the unicorn
didn't solve the problem.

319
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,512
No, Zari. We're not going back
to New Orleans.

320
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,155
We need to find out what's wrong
with this timeline and fix it.

321
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,515
All right, we go back to the Bureau,
figure out our next step.

322
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,936
<i>Charlie? Come on,
talk to me, love. What's happening?</i>

323
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,030
Is everything normal?

324
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,076
No.

325
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,920
In fact, things are
pretty far from normal.

326
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,070
No reason to panic.
We still got this.

327
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,376
Right, we'll find out how the boys
died in this timeline,

328
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,720
then we'll go back and save them.

329
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,234
And hopefully, when they return,

330
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,656
they won't be
magical-creature murderers.

331
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,149
Right. Sounds so simple.

332
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,670
Hey, watch it.

333
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,073
Out of the way, suckers.

334
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,913
Make way for SOS.

335
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,634
What the hell is "SOS"?

336
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,159
Good morning, Sirens.

337
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,920
Good morning, Hank.

338
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,913
I hope you're ready to go to work today,

339
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,640
because we have one hell of
a case on our hands.

340
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,160
If anyone knows what happened
to the guys, it'll be them.

341
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,994
<i>Hang tight on the ship.</i>

342
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,436
Looks like I'm joining the SOS.

343
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,715
All right, ladies. Weapons check.

344
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,234
Way ahead of ya, babe.

345
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,433
My pistol's hot and ready.

346
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,116
Hey, girls. Save some fun for me.

347
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,790
Amaya, what are you doing here?

348
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,713
We thought you went back to 1942.

349
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,954
I did, but then I...

350
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,198
I heard about your monster problem,
and, well, I couldn't stay away.

351
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,796
It's perfect timing.
We are up to our peaches

352
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,998
with magical creatures,
and about to kick some ass.

353
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,030
I'm in.

354
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,590
<i>Johnny, be honest with me.</i>

355
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,976
<i>This thing between us,</i>

356
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,276
<i>it isn't real, it never was,
it doesn't exist.</i>

357
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,840
Get it together, John!

358
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,440
Come on!
Get your head together!

359
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,872
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know what you're thinking.

360
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,376
You want me to put things back
the way they were,

361
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,357
but that's not gonna bloody happen.

362
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,156
No. I'm not all right, to be honest.

363
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,355
So, what kind of fun costumes
are we gonna need for this mission?

364
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,952
We don't do costumes anymore.

365
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,856
Yeah, we stopped, so we could
streamline the missions.

366
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,056
Yeah, why get all dressed up if we're

367
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,040
just wasting
these magical creatures straightaway?

368
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,555
Please tell me you don't
keep a trophy room of their skulls.

369
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,551
What do we look like, barbarians?

370
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,314
No, we just toss them.

371
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,760
- You, what?
- Yeah.

372
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,121
Ever since that Fairy Godmother
killed Nate, Ray and Rory,

373
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,238
we just waste any magical creature
that comes in our path.

374
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,320
No questions asked.

375
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,195
Well, they can't all be bad.

376
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,515
We haven't met a good one.

377
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,717
Hey, how's Zambesi?

378
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,270
- Hmm? Who?
- Zambesi?

379
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,154
Where you're from?

380
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,079
It's great. Yeah, it's like, chill.

381
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,475
Super chill.

382
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,195
If I do what you ask,
I'd be sending Desmond to hell.

383
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,429
Yeah, I know.
Maybe I deserve this insanity.

384
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,320
Oh, you're all soft.

385
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,136
<i>Oi, wake up, losers.</i>

386
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,160
I know how to fix it.

387
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,914
Right, we gotta take care of
the Fairy Godmother in Salem.

388
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,037
Fire up the ship.
I'm heading up there now.

389
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,998
Cor blimey!

390
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,359
No more tea and crumpets
for this dodgy doppelganger!

391
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,031
Hard Drive here knew you
weren't really Amaya all along.

392
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,436
I'm equipped to detect
shapeshifter pheromones.

393
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,317
How fortunate our white whale
swam right into our net.

394
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,113
What is it with you guys
and white whales?

395
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,918
You really think you three can take me?

396
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,958
Oh, I can take you alone.

397
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,072
Damn it! Get back here!

398
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,235
Hi. How were
the Sirens of Space-time?

399
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,800
Well, they're not the Custodians.

400
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,480
They may actually be worse.

401
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:34,041
Now, let's go save the lads.

402
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,439
The three of you have been so rude,
with your nasty attitude.

403
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,675
<i>It will be ever so sublime
to slowly choke you out with vines</i>

404
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,439
Whatever you're gonna do, Charlie,
you better make it fast.

405
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,190
I got this.

406
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,194
<i>...peach or cherry</i>

407
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,479
<i>Any good thing to make us all merry</i>

408
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
Prudence?

409
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,279
Fairy Godmother, are you finished?

410
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,073
- That was fast.
- Yes.

411
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,799
And I was thinking,

412
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,992
if I'm to be your Fairy Godmother,

413
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,239
you must start behaving
like a proper young lady.

414
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
How do you mean?

415
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,355
Nothing dreadful or out of the ordinary.

416
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,751
Just chores, daily baths,

417
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,316
church service each morning,

418
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,798
and you must start eating broccoli.

419
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,234
But I don't want all that.

420
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,559
Well, until our bond is severed,

421
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,435
I'm afraid that's the way it must be.

422
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,038
Now, eat the broccoli.

423
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,076
Fairy Godmother, I relinquish you!

424
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,560
That's cool.

425
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,355
<i>I'll only become satiated</i>

426
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,353
<i>When you're all asphyxiated</i>

427
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,555
My bond with Prudence
has been severed!

428
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,997
Oh, fiddlesticks.

429
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,871
You know, I hate to jinx this,
but I really think

430
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,155
we nailed it this time.

431
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,800
I just hope you guys are right.

432
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,956
What's wrong?

433
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,510
What are you looking at?

434
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,240
Is there something on my nose?

435
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,960
Bollocks!

436
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
<i>Anything yet?</i>

437
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,039
Don't rush me, love. Who knows
what surprises wait for us in here?

438
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,436
Looks like there's reptilians
in the Renaissance.

439
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,816
Sounds like a team meeting. I'll just
pop in and say hello, shall I?

440
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,760
So, put on your
period-appropriate boots,

441
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,036
'cause we are going lizard stomping.

442
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,160
Hey, everybody, look. It's our
good friend, John Constantine!

443
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,310
Yay!

444
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,560

<i>So, they've got magic</i>

00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,475
<i>Well, we've got heart and fabric</i>

<i>Welcome to</i> DC's Puppets of Tomorrow.

456
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,677
<i>...Fraggle Rock</i> is going on here?

457
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,720
Well, today we learned about
the importance of cooperating.

458
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,912
And about the number three.

459
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,959
And about a famous man
from history named Napoleon.

460
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,714
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

461
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,075
I think I need a drink.

462
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,634
Ooh, we can help!

463
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,080
<i>When you're thirsty for a drink</i>

00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,999
<i>You gotta ask for help!</i>

466
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,112
Oh, stop! All right, please, please.

467
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,274
No more singing.

468
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,631
Just tell me. Why are you puppets?

469
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,873
Because Rory called us
"a bunch of Time Bureau puppets."

470
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,159
Yeah, and then he ran off with his
new partner in crime.

471
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,594
So? Did you figure out how I
turned into a damn puppet?

472
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,216
It's worse than I thought.

473
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,800
After we managed to separate
the Fairy Godmother from Prudence,

474
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,712
she somehow glommed onto Rory.

475
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,314
You can probably figure out the rest.

476
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,216
We're just gonna have to keep fixing

477
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,616
what's broken until we get it right.

478
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,640
Yeah.

479
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,520
Damn it!

480
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Nope.

481
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,836
Hmm...

482
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,120
Mmm-mmm.

483
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,594
No plaques!

484
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,749
No plaques! No plaques! We did it.

485
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,556
I'm chuffed to bits!
Everyone's alive,

486
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,276
Zari's human again,
and I still have my powers.

487
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,711
That's smashing news, love.

488
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,077
Yeah. I mean, sure, it took us
a few cracks, but fixed the timeline.

489
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,511
- See that, Zari?
- John, are you okay?

490
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,315
Yeah. Yeah, never better.

491
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,754
John? John!

492
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,909
What happened?

493
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,056
Passed out, mate.

494
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,719
He didn't just pass out.

495
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,679
His brain can't handle this wad of
bandages you call a timeline.

496
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,234
I can take the pain, love.

497
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
What if you can't?

498
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,110
What if you die, John?

499
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,830
What happens to all the people who
need you alive and Constantine-ing?

500
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,896
You can leave that
to the real heroes, all right?

501
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,673
Because I'm done giving a damn.

502
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,920
Oh...

503
00:28:02,921 --> 00:28:03,921
I see.

504
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,195
This isn't about saving
Desmond anymore.

505
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,357
It's an excuse for you
to give up on yourself.

506
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Just leave him alone, will ya?

507
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,399
You think because there's no plaques,
the world is fixed?

508
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,831
I promise you,
it's just as messed up out there

509
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
as it is in John's brain.

510
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,994
I know you don't want
to send Desmond to hell,

511
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,000
but that doesn't have to be
the end of the story.

512
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,716
You of all people can find a way
to keep fighting for him.

513
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,240
Go to New Orleans
and set things right.

514
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,120
Don't listen to her!
Come on, John. It's you and me.

515
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,314
We can make this timeline work.

516
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,400
No, Charlie.

517
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,760
We've tried over and over and over
to get what we wanted,

518
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
and it hasn't worked.

519
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,555
But Zari's right.

520
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,960
There's still hope for Desmond.

521
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,632
Maybe there's still hope
for your powers, too.

522
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,276
"Hope"?

523
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,393
My powers aren't some magic trick,
they're who I am.

524
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,314
I'm not gonna just sit around
and hope that they come back.

525
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
I'll fight for them.

526
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,429
This ain't over.

527
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,872
Not by a long shot.

528
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,750
Ava? I wasn't expecting to see you here.

529
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,513
Yeah, the Bureau got an emergency alert

530
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,717
about a magical presence
in New Orleans, 2018.

531
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,640
I thought maybe we could
check it out together.

532
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,996
Let's get to work.

533
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,520
Cool.

534
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,236
I didn't live this specific moment,
but I remember it.

535
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,717
It's all part of my
jumbled bloody memory.

536
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,874
By the way, only about 10% of what
you're saying makes any sense.

537
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,599
But by all means, continue.

538
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,195
Right, so, the earliest me
just left for the market.

539
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,875
The other one is upstairs
breaking up with Des right now.

540
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,151
And when Des leaves upset,

541
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,915
I'll stop him,
put things back to normal.

542
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,195
<i>All right, good luck.</i>

543
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,680
Blimey, that's a lot of ammo.

544
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,760
"Blimey"?

545
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,432
Oh, I meant, wow!

546
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,870
All right, boys,
orders are shoot to kill.

547
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,759
Wait, wait, wait. Shouldn't we discuss

548
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,296
what kind of creature
we're dealing with here?

549
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,720
We can't just go in guns a-blazing.

550
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,759
What if whatever's causing this
is just a little misguided?

551
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,078
- It's a magical fugitive.
- We kill those.

552
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,278
You two head out. Stay on the comms.

553
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,830
Hmm.

554
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,312
I killed the man I loved, and for what,

555
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,920
to buy New Orleans a little more time.

556
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,320
Neron needs souls...

557
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,629
Okay, right,

558
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,272
I think that something should be
landing right here any second now.

559
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,520
I work alone.

560
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,960
Got it.

561
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,953
All right, Gideon,
what are we looking at?

562
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,096
I've located
multiple targets on the ground,

563
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,237
each one with a substantial
magical signature.

564
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,710
Do we have a visual yet?

565
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,040
Coming up now.

566
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,592
Wait. That's John Constantine,
and there's more than one of him.

567
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,156
Looks like our shapeshifter
has a shapeshifter friend.

568
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,576
Wait a second. How do you know that

569
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,160
that's not really
Constantine out there?

570
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,391
Because it's John Constantine.
He doesn't time-travel.

571
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,296
Believe me, I tried to recruit him.

572
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,896
Okay, so, why don't we capture
all three of them

573
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,960
so we can find out if any of them
are the real John?

574
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,760
What is wrong with you?

575
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,120
Are you feeling okay?

576
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,954
I'm fine. I'm just a firm believer
in taking precautions.

577
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,591
"Precautions." Good one.

578
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,917
<i>Ray, Rory, what's your status?</i>

579
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,915
All right, we're in position.

580
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,959
We got sights on the shapeshifter.

581
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,350
When do we get to shoot?

582
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,075
<i>All right, on my mark, open fire.</i>

583
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,640
Sara, don't!

584
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,920
Damn it, Ava. Why not?

585
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,435
Because I'm the shapeshifter.

586
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,471
Guys, stand down.
We have a code blue on the ship.

587
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,394
What the hell is a "code blue"?

588
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,312
Just don't shoot yet.

589
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,696
If there's something going on
in your life, just be honest with me.

590
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,520
Yeah, do you know what,
this thing between us,

591
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,069
it isn't real, it never was,
it doesn't exist.

592
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,676
You should go.

593
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,919
Yeah, you're right. I should.

594
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,271
But this was real, Johnny.

595
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,559
Hey, you dropped this.

596
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,995
My phone.

597
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,677
How did you get down here?
You were just upstairs.

598
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,136
Yeah, never mind about that
right now.

599
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,516
I have something really
important to tell you.

600
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,936
You know what, I think you've
said quite enough today already.

601
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,960
No, Des, please.

602
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,595
Give me a minute, all right?

603
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,517
So, you're the shapeshifter.

604
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,074
Why do you look like Amaya?

605
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,949
It is complicated,

606
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,360
but this is how you know me.

607
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,877
What's happened to the Legends
to make you like this?

608
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,636
What do you mean?

609
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,400
You guys are so intent
on killing magical creatures.

610
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,200
Can't you see that this is wrong?

611
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,710
Not really.

612
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,520
Look, now, I know this sounds crazy,

613
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,480
but the "me" you were just
speaking to upstairs, he's my past.

614
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,800
So, you break up with me
out of the blue,

615
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,354
act like a total ass.

616
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,557
And suddenly, that's in the past.

617
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,472
- Just like that?
- No, listen, literally,

618
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,072
that is me from ages ago,

619
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,856
but the person who is standing
in front of you right now

620
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,475
is a little bit older
and he's a little bit wiser.

621
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,109
Sure. Still playing games, clearly.

622
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,039
Look,

623
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,316
I thought this was real.

624
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,235
It is real, Des. And that's why
I moved heaven and earth,

625
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,119
so that I could save you from
a lifetime, an eternity

626
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,237
of anguish, anguish that I caused.

627
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,038
Look... I guess
what I'm trying to say is

628
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,392
I'm sorry you ever even met me.

629
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,600
Don't be sorry.

630
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,275
Only a fool would fall in love
with John Constantine

631
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,959
and not expect it to be rocky.

632
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,677
I knew the risks.

633
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,316
And I took them anyway.

634
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,520
For you.

635
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,516
I'm still pissed at you.

636
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,911
Why can't we just go back
to the way things were?

637
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,793
That's exactly what I was thinking.

638
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,750
What is that?

639
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,639
Know one thing, Desmond...

640
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,436
I'm not quitting on you.

641
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,919
Sara, crazy-looking Constantine
just memory-flashed a civilian.

642
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,040
Can we shoot him yet?

643
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,320
Wait for my signal.

644
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,953
I'm dealing with a situation.

645
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,120
Constantine might be...

646
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,390
<i>Sara? Sara?</i>

647
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,320
<i>Hold on a second, Ray.</i>

648
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,195
Where did you get that?

649
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,480
Look, I don't know who you are,

650
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,518
or why you are on my ship,

651
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,993
but you're never leaving.

652
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,600
Oh, hello, handsome.

653
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,235
What are you doing,
standing in the middle of the street?

654
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,640
I wa... Um...

655
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,230
- You went to the market...
- I did.

656
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,056
Next thing I knew,
I was standing in the street.

657
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,080
I don't know.

658
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,560
Wait, Sara, please.

659
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,550
Just tell me why you're so intent
on killing magical creatures.

660
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,353
Because that's how we stay alive.

661
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,560
Stop doing that!

662
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,032
- Don't you remember London?
- No.

663
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,715
When you and I first met,

664
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,076
and I helped you see the truth
about magical creatures?

665
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,390
And how did you do that?

666
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,200
By being me.

667
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,231
By showing you that I'm
not here to hurt humans.

668
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,232
That not all "monsters"
need to be put down.

669
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,830
That's cute, but it never happened.

670
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,430
What?

671
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,034
How can you not remember?

672
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,116
Bollocks.

673
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,480
Because of Constantine,
you and I never met

674
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,999
and you never changed.

675
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,193
I'm the missing ingredient in
every one of these botched timelines.

676
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,151
I'm sorry, but all I see is a threat
that needs to be taken out.

677
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,238
Ray, fire when ready.

678
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,120
- You got eggs?
- I've got the eggs.

679
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,720
I got the bread.
Got everything we need.

680
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,351
- Soufflé?
- Soufflé, but first things first.

681
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,155
<i>You need to be a part of a team.</i>

682
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,256
<i>Your shapeshifting days
are over, sweetheart.</i>

683
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,280
<i>No!</i>

684
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,856
<i>I know who's coming for you!</i>

685
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,873
<i>Choosing a life of magic,
it never leads to a happy ending.</i>

686
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,600
<i>That's the thing about time travel.</i>

687
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,120
<i>There's always a way.</i>

688
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,840
I'm sorry, Des.

689
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,232
John, you okay?

690
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,920
Yeah, well...

691
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,798
My mind is
no longer split in two, but...

692
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,880
I can't say the same
about my heart, though.

693
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,360
You?

694
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,513
Well, lost my powers.

695
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,159
Back to being mortal.

696
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,640
Sorry, guys. It had to be done.

697
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,951
Well, let's go and find
the Legends, shall we?

698
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,034
- Yeah, see if all this was worth it.
- Yeah.

699
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,191
Well, everything seems
pretty normal so far.

700
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,920
This isn't over, you ding-a-lings!

701
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,795
You better watch
your knees, Sara Lance.

702
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,752
Oh, no. Is everyone a puppet again?

703
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,960
What?

704
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,456
- What are you talking about?
- I'll kill you all!

705
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,040
I've got an anti-magic
isolation chamber

706
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,873
with your name on it, Mike the Spike.

707
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,719
The usual insanity that passes
for normal around here.

708
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,509
What is this?
Why are you being so weird?

709
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,715
Well, I do have a little bit
of a tale to tell, to be honest.

710
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,840
Do you fancy a drink?

711
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,118
Hmm, one of those stories. Let's go.

712
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,829
Hey, Zari.
I want to say that I'm sorry.

713
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,630
For what? For stuffing me into a bag
or almost destroying all of history?

714
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,790
Well, yeah, that, too.

715
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,999
But what I'm really sorry about is that
we got off on the wrong foot.

716
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,589
You're a shapeshifter.
Your whole deal is tricking people.

717
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,717
Yeah, but now,
I'm being honest with you.

718
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,275
You know, I could have been anyone
when I got my powers back.

719
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,280
Do you know why I kept coming
back to this form?

720
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,079
Because Amaya is very hot?

721
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,600
It's because this is the form I was
when I joined the Legends.

722
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,911
Now, I've been a part of many crews.

723
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,271
And you guys... Well,

724
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,915
you're not rubbish.

725
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,397
Listen, destroying history
for personal gain,

726
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,233
it's happened
to almost everyone here.

727
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,795
Rite of passage.

728
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,240
So, you think I'm hot, then?

729
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,358
I made snickerdoodles
with your recipe.

730
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,670
Not bad.

731
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,436
Hmm.

732
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,076
I'm reading your novel.
I'm on the last chapter.

733
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,999
Your female characters are shallow,

734
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:37,471
libidinous, and so much fun to read.

735
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,199
Thanks.

736
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,114
Yeah. Good job... "Rebecca Silver"?

737
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,391
- Nom-de-plum.
- Got it.

738
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,039
So, let me get this straight.

739
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,920
They're making love on
the surface of the sun?

740
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,200
It's a metaphor.

741
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,756
Got it.

742
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,240
<i>And the worst part...</i>

743
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,680
It didn't even make a bloody difference.

744
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I was a fool,

745
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,549
thinking I could outrun this fight
flying around with you lot.

746
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,079
Yeah, we tend to fly
directly into fights.

747
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,597
But we do it together.

748
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,189
And we have your back.

749
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,600
As long as you know what
you're getting yourself into.

750
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,157
Because a demon like Neron
doesn't just want to win.

751
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,439
He wants to win
in the cruelest possible way.

752
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,760
Yeah?

753
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,315
The Kaupe escaped?

754
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,880
Here's what I want you to do.

755
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,714
Track him down and recapture him,
or else.

756
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,320
Um...

757
00:41:46,321 --> 00:41:47,755
There has been a setback.

758
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,718
But we'll make it right.

759
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,234
Oh, you'd better.
