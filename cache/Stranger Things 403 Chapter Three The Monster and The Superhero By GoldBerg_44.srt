Your temporary insanity earlier today

threw yourself at Nance?

- Pretty sure that's what happened.

00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,860
It was public.
There were a lot of witnesses.

have a thing for Nance?

No. I'm not implying.

747
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,950
I'm stating. And, as it relates
to your steadfast refusal to date Robin,

it's pretty much

00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,590
I was just trying to protect a friend.

That's why, if we're really gonna do this,
