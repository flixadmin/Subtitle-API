1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,960
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:01,963 --> 00:00:04,148
After 6 years of being a vigilante,

3
00:00:04,151 --> 00:00:05,951
the only way to achieve my goal

4
00:00:05,953 --> 00:00:09,287
and save my city was to confess
to being the Green Arrow.

5
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:13,291
Now my family and friends must
carry on my mission without me.

6
00:00:13,293 --> 00:00:15,594
I am no longer a hero.

7
00:00:15,596 --> 00:00:18,898
I am inmate 4587.

8
00:00:19,664 --> 00:00:20,997
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,667
The bureau's going to stay in Star City

10
00:00:22,669 --> 00:00:24,059
until Diaz is brought in,

11
00:00:24,062 --> 00:00:26,238
but only if Oliver will turn himself in.

12
00:00:27,474 --> 00:00:30,008
Diaz found Felicity. Your wife is dead.

13
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:33,039
You're okay.

14
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:36,809
I can't let what happened to
William and I happen again.

15
00:00:36,812 --> 00:00:38,884
I have to fight back.

16
00:00:38,886 --> 00:00:41,119
I know I want to keep
fighting for this city.

17
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:43,121
I know you've been in some
hot water here at A.R.G.U.S.,

18
00:00:43,123 --> 00:00:45,902
burning so many of their
resources going after Diaz.

19
00:00:45,905 --> 00:00:48,700
This place must be
very important for you.

20
00:00:48,703 --> 00:00:50,036
It's not the place.

21
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,786
It's the person I'm
hoping to find there.

22
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:52,898
My father...

23
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,299
Is Oliver Queen.

24
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:55,834
William?

25
00:01:12,828 --> 00:01:16,621
Vacation's over, 4587.

26
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:19,524
You're lucky you only
got two days in the hole

27
00:01:19,526 --> 00:01:21,426
after what you pulled.

28
00:01:21,428 --> 00:01:24,262
Apparently, there are
still people in here

29
00:01:24,264 --> 00:01:28,500
who believe that you're a hero.

30
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:31,769
But we know better...

31
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:33,805
Don't we?

32
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:38,542
I asked you a question, inmate.

33
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:41,613
You don't know anything about me.

34
00:01:41,615 --> 00:01:43,314
Sure I do.

35
00:01:43,316 --> 00:01:45,937
I grew up with kids just like you...

36
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,553
Entitled, rich.

37
00:01:48,555 --> 00:01:51,923
Thought the law didn't apply to them.

38
00:01:51,925 --> 00:01:56,060
But look at you now... a criminal

39
00:01:56,062 --> 00:01:59,998
just like every other bastard in here.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,134
My wife and son were attacked.

41
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,304
I'll do anything to protect them.

42
00:02:14,661 --> 00:02:17,593
Oh, you're back! Oh, man.

43
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:20,251
The way you beat the crap
out of that grim reaper guy

44
00:02:20,253 --> 00:02:21,351
was awesome.

45
00:02:21,354 --> 00:02:23,052
That face looked like hamburger meat.

46
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:24,188
Where is he?

47
00:02:24,191 --> 00:02:25,554
He's gone.

48
00:02:25,557 --> 00:02:28,191
The warden found out that he
attacked you in the shower,

49
00:02:28,194 --> 00:02:29,727
got sent down to level two.

50
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:31,362
Which is worse than a death sentence.

51
00:02:31,364 --> 00:02:33,418
He's my only lead on Diaz.

52
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:35,533
Don't worry. He doesn't know anything.

53
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:37,368
He just got a nice pay day.

54
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,271
Right. Why do you know that?

55
00:02:40,273 --> 00:02:41,773
I asked around.

56
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:44,108
You should be keeping to yourself.

57
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,946
Asking questions in here
is going to get you killed.

58
00:02:47,948 --> 00:02:50,014
Not when you're asking
for the Green Arrow.

59
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:51,416
Everyone saw what you did,

60
00:02:51,418 --> 00:02:52,817
and they're all afraid of you.

61
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:53,914
'Cause we're friends,

62
00:02:53,917 --> 00:02:56,351
now they're afraid of me.

63
00:02:57,723 --> 00:02:59,846
All right. If that prisoner
wasn't behind the attack,

64
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:01,523
then who hired him?

65
00:03:01,526 --> 00:03:04,337
That scary bald guy who attacked me.

66
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,997
Right. Brick.

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,328
So what's our plan?

68
00:03:08,331 --> 00:03:11,635
Beat him up? Torture him for info?

69
00:03:11,638 --> 00:03:16,114
Nope. We do it my way.

70
00:03:16,117 --> 00:03:21,273

71
00:03:23,332 --> 00:03:24,681
A little more.

72
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:26,351
A little more.

73
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:28,286
Do you want me to put
a straw in the bottle?

74
00:03:28,288 --> 00:03:30,570
Ah, ah! Don't judge me.

75
00:03:30,573 --> 00:03:32,429
A.R.G.U.S. is my
designated driver tonight.

76
00:03:32,432 --> 00:03:33,998
Indeed they are, and every night

77
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:35,640
until we take Diaz off the board.

78
00:03:35,643 --> 00:03:37,561
That psycho has been M.I.A. 5 months,

79
00:03:37,564 --> 00:03:39,731
and then he goes after
Oliver and Felicity.

80
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:40,664
Why now?

81
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:43,155
Well, whatever he's up to,
now we know it's personal.

82
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:44,924
Which is exactly why I put Laurel

83
00:03:44,927 --> 00:03:46,226
on protective detail.

84
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:47,904
She's got to be high on his hit list.

85
00:03:47,907 --> 00:03:49,741
Not that I don't enjoy talking about

86
00:03:49,743 --> 00:03:51,804
all the ways that Diaz can get to us.

87
00:03:51,807 --> 00:03:54,762
Anybody have any idea
how we can get to him?

88
00:03:54,765 --> 00:03:56,132
Well, I've been working on that.

89
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:57,501
What the heck is that thing?

90
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:58,938
I call it my Digi murder board.

91
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,290
I mean, I can probably work on the name,

92
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:02,258
but it analyzes all the
data we've collected on Diaz.

93
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,516
Plus, it searches for additional Intel.

94
00:04:03,518 --> 00:04:05,125
And then it makes
predictive suggestions.

95
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:07,556
So it's like a brain that
only thinks about Diaz.

96
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:08,671
- Mm.
- Gross...

97
00:04:08,674 --> 00:04:11,375
- Yeah.
- But also cool.

98
00:04:11,378 --> 00:04:13,463
That's an electronic jammer.

99
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:15,418
What is Diaz doing with tech like that?

100
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,594
Well, it's the same tech he used to bust

101
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:18,612
my A.R.G.U.S. security
system when he attacked me.

102
00:04:18,615 --> 00:04:21,218
Well, a model that sophisticated
is very hard to get.

103
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:22,375
Diaz has new friends.

104
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:23,878
Which is why I wrote algorithms to track

105
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,179
all his known associates,
like Cyrus Broderick

106
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,715
and the Longbow Hunters.

107
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:29,981
Well, this is all great work, Felicity.

108
00:04:29,984 --> 00:04:32,312
Just remember you don't have
to do it all alone, okay?

109
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:34,015
We've all got your
back, whatever you need.

110
00:04:34,018 --> 00:04:35,813
I know. Thank you. I... I appreciate it.

111
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:38,039
But what I need is for Diaz to go down.

112
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:40,491
There is somebody else
who might be able to help.

113
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:41,693
If you say, "The New Green Arrow,"

114
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:43,061
I'm gonna punch you in the face.

115
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:44,595
You did say, whatever she needed.

116
00:04:44,597 --> 00:04:46,698
There is only one Green
Arrow, and he's in prison.

117
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,400
Okay, enough squabbling
and murder boarding.

118
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:50,968
Let's toast.

119
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,601
To friends reunited, to being back home,

120
00:04:54,604 --> 00:04:57,957
and to bringing that son
of a bitch Diaz to justice.

121
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,585
- I'll drink to that.
- Hear! Hear!

122
00:04:59,588 --> 00:05:00,954
- Yeah.
- Cheers.

123
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,085
Felicity and Oliver, they really...

124
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:11,302
They really just left you?

125
00:05:11,305 --> 00:05:14,206
Pretty much.

126
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:15,945
And my ex-boyfriend wonders why

127
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,794
I have commitment issues.

128
00:05:17,797 --> 00:05:20,335
I'm sorry. That's awful.

129
00:05:20,338 --> 00:05:21,737
Yeah, he was a real jerk.

130
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,067
No. I was talking about
Oliver and Felicity.

131
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,617
Yeah, well, I survived.

132
00:05:31,678 --> 00:05:33,311
So what about you?

133
00:05:33,313 --> 00:05:35,046
What's your excuse for being here?

134
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:36,647
Where'd you get that?

135
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:40,551
Oh, um, Felicity gave it to me.

136
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:43,788
She said it was a
symbol of reconnection.

137
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,960
I thought it was B.S.,

138
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:50,359
but then, uh, 3 weeks
ago, it started to beep.

139
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:52,329
I opened it up...

140
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:58,301
And I found this.

141
00:05:58,304 --> 00:06:01,072
They're GPS coordinates for this island.

142
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:05,243
Wait. Why would Felicity
send you to Lian Yu?

143
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:07,111
Cruel joke?

144
00:06:07,113 --> 00:06:11,215
You know, the last time
I was on this island...

145
00:06:11,217 --> 00:06:13,184
Was the day my mother died.

146
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:16,546
I still have nightmares about it.

147
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:20,343
But I came anyway.

148
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:23,476
Well, trust me, looking for answers is

149
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:25,132
only gonna cause you pain.

150
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,562
So what I would do is I would take that,

151
00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:30,067
and I'd throw it right
there in the ocean

152
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:32,336
and never look back.

153
00:06:47,921 --> 00:06:49,086
Hi there.

154
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:50,755
I'm looking for Global Solutions.

155
00:06:50,757 --> 00:06:53,391
Fourth floor, ma'am. Everything
above that's restricted.

156
00:06:53,393 --> 00:06:56,500
Tom, can I ask you a favor?

157
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:58,069
I have an interview with GS,

158
00:06:58,072 --> 00:07:00,139
and I somehow ended
up here without a pen,

159
00:07:00,142 --> 00:07:02,142
and I really need that job.

160
00:07:02,145 --> 00:07:03,845
Of course.

161
00:07:14,295 --> 00:07:15,694
Pardon me.

162
00:07:15,697 --> 00:07:17,297
I am so sorry.

163
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:29,210
Excuse me, ma'am.

164
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:33,464
Who the hell are you?

165
00:07:37,837 --> 00:07:40,037
So much for not making a mess.

166
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:42,173
I got bored.

167
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:04,947
Number 326.

168
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,546
Where the hell is she?

169
00:08:14,316 --> 00:08:15,718
You or me?

170
00:08:15,721 --> 00:08:18,241
Be my guest.

171
00:08:29,487 --> 00:08:30,968
That never gets old.

172
00:08:30,971 --> 00:08:33,203
We need to get out of
here. Did you get it?

173
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:52,390
Thanks a million, Tom.

174
00:08:52,393 --> 00:08:54,648
No problem. How was the interview?

175
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:56,328
I think I nailed it.

176
00:09:02,211 --> 00:09:04,922
Shortly after 0900 this morning,

177
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:06,305
a break-in was reported

178
00:09:06,308 --> 00:09:08,408
at one of our off-site facilities.

179
00:09:08,411 --> 00:09:12,063
Only one item was
stolen... Prototype B-24.

180
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:13,117
It's an ultra...

181
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,798
High-density renewable battery?

182
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:16,711
I didn't even know those existed yet.

183
00:09:16,714 --> 00:09:19,419
One super battery has
enough juice to power a town.

184
00:09:19,421 --> 00:09:21,421
We were reusing them to help refugees.

185
00:09:21,423 --> 00:09:23,078
What kind of jerk gets
in the way of that?

186
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:25,475
Well, maybe you would know if
John let you in on his briefing.

187
00:09:25,477 --> 00:09:27,381
Well, I do not have a high
enough security clearance.

188
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:29,328
Plus, I heard Deputy Director
Bell's gonna be in there,

189
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,672
and he scares me.

190
00:09:30,675 --> 00:09:32,914
You know, I could just get
us the unredacted report.

191
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:35,727
Uh, no. I actually like my job, okay?

192
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,803
So whoever did this knows their tech.

193
00:09:37,806 --> 00:09:39,939
They used an electronic
jammer to get past security.

194
00:09:39,941 --> 00:09:42,992
Yes! The same tech that Diaz
used to breach my safe house

195
00:09:42,995 --> 00:09:45,812
in hope Springs. That is
not a coincidence, Curtis.

196
00:09:45,814 --> 00:09:48,855
Can you tell what type of
weapons they used in the heist?

197
00:09:48,858 --> 00:09:51,250
High-tech shield, nano-powered
darts, sonic manipulator.

198
00:09:51,252 --> 00:09:52,885
These are super impressive weapons.

199
00:09:52,887 --> 00:09:56,122
Not just impressive. They're specific.

200
00:09:56,124 --> 00:09:57,847
This was definitely...

201
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,183
The Longbow Hunters.

202
00:09:59,186 --> 00:10:01,453
According to our
source, Anatoly Knyazev,

203
00:10:01,456 --> 00:10:04,724
they were hired by our
old friend, Ricardo Diaz.

204
00:10:04,727 --> 00:10:07,362
These assassins are extremely dangerous,

205
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:10,226
and we need to find
them and shut them down.

206
00:10:10,229 --> 00:10:12,663
You have your assignments.

207
00:10:16,276 --> 00:10:18,443
Deputy Director Bell,
I'm surprised to see

208
00:10:18,446 --> 00:10:19,901
you made time for this briefing.

209
00:10:19,904 --> 00:10:21,570
I wanted to check in,

210
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:24,230
given the reappearance of Ricardo Diaz.

211
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:26,266
I know you have a personal connection.

212
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:28,420
Well, I appreciate the concerns.

213
00:10:28,423 --> 00:10:32,091
I assure you my priorities
are in the right place.

214
00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:34,660
Diaz is a son of a bitch,

215
00:10:34,662 --> 00:10:37,697
but A.R.G.U.S. isn't chartered
for criminal investigations.

216
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:41,200
That's why recovering
that tech is the objective.

217
00:10:41,202 --> 00:10:42,735
Understood?

218
00:10:42,737 --> 00:10:44,370
Yes, sir.

219
00:10:49,777 --> 00:10:51,441
I know it's the Longbow Hunters.

220
00:10:51,444 --> 00:10:53,362
You have to let me in on this operation.

221
00:10:53,365 --> 00:10:54,742
A.R.G.U.S. is handling it.

222
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:55,878
Told you! Ahem.

223
00:10:55,881 --> 00:10:58,081
The longbow hunters are a
direct connection to Diaz.

224
00:10:58,084 --> 00:11:00,480
They are the best lead
we've had on him in months.

225
00:11:00,483 --> 00:11:03,288
You know it, John. John,
I need to do something.

226
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:06,234
I know, and I'm sorry, but
A.R.G.U.S. has its protocols.

227
00:11:06,237 --> 00:11:07,387
- John...
- We will keep you updated.

228
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:10,423
Felicity, just trust me.

229
00:11:15,537 --> 00:11:16,869
Laurel...

230
00:11:16,871 --> 00:11:18,581
We need to talk.

231
00:11:18,584 --> 00:11:20,355
If this is about the Conway case,

232
00:11:20,358 --> 00:11:22,574
I already told Anastas I need more time.

233
00:11:22,577 --> 00:11:24,744
That is not why I'm
here, and you know it.

234
00:11:24,746 --> 00:11:27,713
Aw. Did you miss me? That's so sweet.

235
00:11:27,715 --> 00:11:32,448
Laurel, you ditched your
protective detail again.

236
00:11:32,451 --> 00:11:34,618
Perhaps you should get your
facts straight, Captain.

237
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:37,556
Your officers had a medical emergency.

238
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,355
Food poisoning, I think it was.

239
00:11:39,358 --> 00:11:42,480
Food poisoning does not
cause hearing loss or vertigo.

240
00:11:42,483 --> 00:11:44,483
You know what does? A sonic wave.

241
00:11:44,486 --> 00:11:46,648
Ooh, that sounds serious.

242
00:11:46,651 --> 00:11:48,639
This isn't a joke, Laurel.

243
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:50,375
You know, I just heard from A.R.G.U.S.

244
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:53,072
the Longbow Hunters are in Star City.

245
00:11:53,074 --> 00:11:55,472
Diaz won't be far behind.

246
00:11:55,475 --> 00:11:56,975
Matter of fact, for all we know,

247
00:11:56,978 --> 00:11:58,678
he could already be in town.

248
00:11:58,681 --> 00:12:02,115
Now, I don't really
care if Diaz kills you,

249
00:12:02,118 --> 00:12:04,182
but I do care if he kills the D.A.

250
00:12:04,185 --> 00:12:05,409
Touching.

251
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:06,901
Diaz kidnapped you.

252
00:12:06,904 --> 00:12:10,019
He killed Quentin, who everyone
believes is your father.

253
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,284
Such a joke.

254
00:12:11,287 --> 00:12:12,878
Hey, I cared about him.

255
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:16,097
Then let my officers protect you.

256
00:12:17,832 --> 00:12:19,966
It's what he would have wanted.

257
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:23,001
I can take care of myself.

258
00:12:24,691 --> 00:12:26,269
Fine.

259
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:35,181
Isn't baby-sitting

260
00:12:35,183 --> 00:12:36,749
a little bit below your pay grade?

261
00:12:36,751 --> 00:12:40,698
Way below, but the SCPD
is going to keep you safe,

262
00:12:40,701 --> 00:12:43,034
whether you want us to or not.

263
00:12:44,826 --> 00:12:47,426
Okay, fine, whatever. Suit yourself.

264
00:12:47,428 --> 00:12:48,961
You might as well make yourself useful

265
00:12:48,963 --> 00:12:50,831
while you're here and
go get me a coffee.

266
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:52,464
Two sugars, no cream.

267
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:54,183
That's never happening.

268
00:13:01,976 --> 00:13:03,191
Ricardo Diaz.

269
00:13:03,194 --> 00:13:04,339
That seat's taken.

270
00:13:04,342 --> 00:13:05,895
You're gonna tell me where to find him.

271
00:13:05,897 --> 00:13:08,566
Hey, you sure you want to do that?

272
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:10,302
I still haven't gotten
a chance to thank you

273
00:13:10,305 --> 00:13:11,684
for sending me to the hole.

274
00:13:11,686 --> 00:13:13,386
I guess you don't know your place here.

275
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:15,121
You may have gotten your fight back,

276
00:13:15,123 --> 00:13:17,703
but we're still at the
top of this food chain.

277
00:13:17,706 --> 00:13:18,858
It's okay, boys.

278
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,626
I got this.

279
00:13:20,628 --> 00:13:24,230
Diaz? Don't ring any bells.

280
00:13:24,232 --> 00:13:27,566
You hired those prisoners
to attack me in the shower

281
00:13:27,569 --> 00:13:29,095
for Diaz.

282
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:32,070
So why don't you tell
me how I can find him?

283
00:13:32,073 --> 00:13:34,140
You know what your problem is, Queen?

284
00:13:34,142 --> 00:13:36,331
You've forgotten where you are.

285
00:13:36,334 --> 00:13:38,034
This is prison,

286
00:13:38,037 --> 00:13:39,828
and you're playing by the wrong rules.

287
00:13:39,831 --> 00:13:41,847
I'm not in any mood for games, Brick.

288
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:43,416
What I'm saying is

289
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:45,051
if you want to be a mate of mine,

290
00:13:45,053 --> 00:13:47,987
you got to prove yourself
worthy of my friendship.

291
00:13:55,596 --> 00:13:57,396
What do you want?

292
00:13:59,651 --> 00:14:01,651
I want him gone.

293
00:14:04,915 --> 00:14:06,191
Why?

294
00:14:06,194 --> 00:14:08,316
That is no concern of yours.

295
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:10,175
You just take care of that guard,

296
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:12,311
and I'll tell you
anything you want to know.

297
00:14:12,313 --> 00:14:14,347
Everybody wins.

298
00:14:21,656 --> 00:14:23,089
Fine.

299
00:14:23,091 --> 00:14:25,324
Queen.

300
00:14:25,326 --> 00:14:27,261
If you say anything to anybody,

301
00:14:27,264 --> 00:14:29,531
the deal is off.

302
00:14:34,402 --> 00:14:36,683
Please tell me you are

303
00:14:36,686 --> 00:14:38,819
not hacking A.R.G.U.S.

304
00:14:38,822 --> 00:14:40,034
from inside A.R.G.U.S.

305
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:41,812
Of course I'm not hacking
A.R.G.U.S. from inside A.R.G.U.S.

306
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,422
I'm hacking Interpol
from inside A.R.G.U.S.

307
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,778
That's not much better,

308
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,370
and that will still get me fired.

309
00:14:47,373 --> 00:14:50,107
Felicity, I really like this job.

310
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,680
Look, I know how badly
you want to get Diaz,

311
00:14:53,683 --> 00:14:55,026
but we need to listen to John.

312
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:57,869
A.R.G.U.S. is more than
capable of doing the job

313
00:14:57,872 --> 00:15:00,058
while we wait and eat some snacks.

314
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:01,691
I'm not waiting for A.R.G.U.S.

315
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:04,178
That's exactly what Oliver wanted
me to do, and Diaz found me anyway.

316
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,269
Okay, well, maybe we can
find the Longbow Hunters

317
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,871
without committing espionage?

318
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:09,734
Can I please... Just for one second.

319
00:15:09,737 --> 00:15:12,004
Okay. Now, we know they
have a super battery.

320
00:15:12,007 --> 00:15:13,970
Chances are they've tried
to test it. And doing that...

321
00:15:13,972 --> 00:15:15,462
Would require an
incredible amount of energy,

322
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:17,176
which would, in turn,
create a power surge.

323
00:15:17,178 --> 00:15:19,802
Which we can pinpoint and then
trace to a specific location.

324
00:15:19,805 --> 00:15:21,306
Ohh! I miss this. I
miss working with you.

325
00:15:21,308 --> 00:15:22,815
I miss hacking Star City's power grid.

326
00:15:22,817 --> 00:15:25,886
- I mean, it just feels right.
- Bingo! A huge voltage spike

327
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:26,927
in a warehouse in Pennytown

328
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:27,878
about an hour ago.

329
00:15:27,881 --> 00:15:30,283
- Great.
- You actually want to go there?

330
00:15:30,286 --> 00:15:31,637
Of course you do. I really
should've thought this through.

331
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,137
Look, I'm not gonna engage
with the Longbow Hunters.

332
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:34,572
I'm just gonna grab one of
your T-spheres and use it

333
00:15:34,574 --> 00:15:36,441
to track them back to Diaz. No big.

334
00:15:36,444 --> 00:15:37,984
Very big. You know what?

335
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:39,220
I'm coming to back you up.

336
00:15:39,223 --> 00:15:41,757
And who's gonna back you up?

337
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,134
I might know a guy.

338
00:15:44,137 --> 00:15:45,603
Back in town a week,

339
00:15:45,606 --> 00:15:47,142
and you're already
sneaking out of A.R.G.U.S.

340
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:48,888
behind Papa Diggs' back?

341
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:50,391
I'm so proud.

342
00:15:50,394 --> 00:15:51,375
Thanks, man.

343
00:15:51,378 --> 00:15:52,778
Don't encourage her, okay?

344
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,586
She's already moved on to espionage.

345
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:55,457
Thanks for coming out, Rene.

346
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:56,754
I know it's not the
best time to be Wild Dog,

347
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,289
what with the whole 25-to-life thing.

348
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:00,452
Wild Dog's not here.
You see a hockey mask?

349
00:16:00,455 --> 00:16:02,558
Besides, this is exactly
what we should've been doing

350
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,926
in the first place instead of
waiting for Diaz to come to us.

351
00:16:06,494 --> 00:16:08,175
The scan's complete.

352
00:16:08,178 --> 00:16:09,811
The Longbow Hunters aren't home.

353
00:16:09,814 --> 00:16:12,594
Damn. So we can't
follow them back to Diaz

354
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,066
if they're not here to be followed.

355
00:16:14,068 --> 00:16:16,535
We can go inside.

356
00:16:16,537 --> 00:16:17,847
Curtis, relax.

357
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,718
I just want to put a couple
trackers on a few things.

358
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,886
Five minutes, tops.

359
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:22,778
Are you familiar with the expression

360
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,128
"famous last words"?

361
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,566
Grab your balls, Curtis. We're going in.

362
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,355
They're not balls. They're T-spheres.

363
00:16:29,358 --> 00:16:31,749
Feels weird doing this without
Oliver and without a headset.

364
00:16:31,752 --> 00:16:33,076
I'm more worried about you holding in

365
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:34,612
so many snarky Overwatch comments.

366
00:16:34,615 --> 00:16:36,015
Guys, look at this.

367
00:16:36,018 --> 00:16:37,832
Anything worth putting a tracker on is

368
00:16:37,835 --> 00:16:39,050
definitely behind that door.

369
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:40,837
Damn. I should've
included a lock pick module

370
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,089
in my last T-sphere update.

371
00:16:42,092 --> 00:16:44,059
Never bring a T-sphere to a gun fight.

372
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,581
Jackpot. Let's plant the tracker.

373
00:16:49,584 --> 00:16:52,018
You work on that. I'll work on this.

374
00:16:53,691 --> 00:16:56,307
Oh, frak. I think I just
triggered a system self-destruct.

375
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,883
Guys, we got a bigger problem.

376
00:16:57,886 --> 00:16:59,411
We're not alone.

377
00:16:59,413 --> 00:17:00,441
Stay behind me.

378
00:17:00,444 --> 00:17:03,812
I think I get the whole
"famous last words" thing now.

379
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:06,217
- Freeze!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot! John!

380
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,187
John, it's us.

381
00:17:15,653 --> 00:17:18,686
You three realize you've just
compromised an active investigation?

382
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:20,780
Yes. But in my defense, we
wouldn't have had to do any of this

383
00:17:20,782 --> 00:17:22,809
if you had just included
me in the first place.

384
00:17:22,812 --> 00:17:24,418
We wanted it as much as you did, Digg.

385
00:17:24,421 --> 00:17:25,545
Rene, before you say another word,

386
00:17:25,547 --> 00:17:28,657
realize that A.R.G.U.S. is quite
aware of your immunity agreement.

387
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,426
Just because you're not wearing a mask

388
00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:32,028
doesn't mean you're
not breaking the law.

389
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,090
You wouldn't really turn him in, though.

390
00:17:34,093 --> 00:17:35,359
But would you?

391
00:17:35,362 --> 00:17:37,333
Felicity, A.R.G.U.S. has its rules.

392
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:38,784
What the hell were you thinking?

393
00:17:38,787 --> 00:17:40,836
I was thinking about catching Diaz.

394
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:42,371
There are bigger things at stake here.

395
00:17:42,374 --> 00:17:43,433
Like what, batteries?

396
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:45,354
It's not just a battery,
Rene. It's a weapon.

397
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,049
Say what, now?

398
00:17:48,747 --> 00:17:50,880
A.R.G.U.S. developed an adapter...

399
00:17:50,882 --> 00:17:53,015
An adapter that calibrates
the charge to power

400
00:17:53,018 --> 00:17:54,273
a directed energy weapon.

401
00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:56,112
- It's enough to flatten a whole city.
- God.

402
00:17:56,115 --> 00:17:58,320
How were we supposed to know that?

403
00:17:58,323 --> 00:18:00,477
You didn't need to know that, Curtis.

404
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,781
Please just pack up the
laptop. Restore the data.

405
00:18:02,784 --> 00:18:04,994
We need to find out what the
Longbow Hunters are doing next.

406
00:18:04,996 --> 00:18:05,960
That could take forever.

407
00:18:05,963 --> 00:18:07,745
The security virus wiped the hard drive.

408
00:18:07,748 --> 00:18:09,698
You have a better idea, Felicity?

409
00:18:09,701 --> 00:18:13,303
Your little stunt just
blew our best possible lead.

410
00:18:18,743 --> 00:18:20,743
This is prison.

411
00:18:20,745 --> 00:18:22,512
There's tons of guys
in here that would be

412
00:18:22,514 --> 00:18:24,702
happy to handle Yorke,
if you know what I mean.

413
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:27,305
Yorke's a hardass, but
he doesn't deserve to die.

414
00:18:27,308 --> 00:18:28,507
Just...

415
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,720
I need to find his pressure point.

416
00:18:30,722 --> 00:18:33,189
WWGAD?

417
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:34,357
What?

418
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,892
What would Green Arrow do?

419
00:18:35,894 --> 00:18:37,293
Oh. I...

420
00:18:39,764 --> 00:18:41,964
He'd have Overwatch gather information.

421
00:18:41,966 --> 00:18:43,599
What's an overwatch?

422
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:48,462
We need a computer.

423
00:18:52,477 --> 00:18:56,578
Once we get inside, we'll have two
minutes before the guards miss us.

424
00:18:56,581 --> 00:18:58,140
You up for this?

425
00:18:58,143 --> 00:19:02,151
Yeah. Hell, yeah. It's my
first Green Arrow mission.

426
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:16,159
What the hell?

427
00:19:16,162 --> 00:19:19,067
No one moves! Everyone,
stay right where you are.

428
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,505
Control, we need
backup near the showers!

429
00:19:25,408 --> 00:19:27,359
Does this thing even have the Internet?

430
00:19:27,362 --> 00:19:28,711
We'll soon find out.

431
00:19:28,713 --> 00:19:31,429
Even if it does, they don't
let felons surf the web.

432
00:19:31,432 --> 00:19:34,814
My wife taught me a
thing or two. Sit tight.

433
00:19:34,817 --> 00:19:37,351
And we got him.

434
00:19:37,354 --> 00:19:38,921
Ok, so what are we looking for?

435
00:19:38,924 --> 00:19:41,624
Anything that will give me leverage.

436
00:19:41,627 --> 00:19:44,227
Peter Yorke was born in 1978.

437
00:19:44,229 --> 00:19:46,757
He joins the army at 19, serves 8 years.

438
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,871
Commendations, injured in line of duty.

439
00:19:48,874 --> 00:19:50,273
Started working at Slabside,

440
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:51,540
and he's been here ever since.

441
00:19:51,543 --> 00:19:52,742
He's been here for 12 years.

442
00:19:52,745 --> 00:19:54,237
No wonder he's such a jerk.

443
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,245
He's got no complaints.

444
00:19:55,248 --> 00:19:56,885
He's got no disciplinary record.

445
00:19:56,888 --> 00:19:59,141
He's a jerk, but he's a law-abiding jerk.

446
00:19:59,143 --> 00:20:02,078
No one that's clean.
There's got to be something.

447
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,280
Look at that.

448
00:20:04,282 --> 00:20:06,401
He's got a wife and a kid.

449
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:07,868
I bet a guy like that would do

450
00:20:07,871 --> 00:20:10,452
just about anything to
keep his family safe.

451
00:20:10,455 --> 00:20:13,589
All right! Back in line!

452
00:20:13,591 --> 00:20:15,596
We have to go.

453
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:33,976
You're still here.

454
00:20:33,978 --> 00:20:36,212
Stubbornness must be hereditary.

455
00:20:36,214 --> 00:20:38,687
I'm a guy who spent over a
billion dollars trying to develop

456
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,583
affordable magnetic levitation.

457
00:20:40,585 --> 00:20:42,485
I don't give up so easily.

458
00:20:42,487 --> 00:20:45,578
Wow. You've done really
good for yourself,

459
00:20:45,581 --> 00:20:47,556
considering everything that's happened.

460
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,927
You know, when I first met you,

461
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:52,895
you were with my Aunt Thea.

462
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:56,155
The two of you were leaving
somewhere together and...

463
00:20:56,158 --> 00:20:59,034
You're not gonna get anywhere
with me by dredging up the past.

464
00:20:59,037 --> 00:21:01,304
I came here to forget about all of that.

465
00:21:05,777 --> 00:21:07,677
When Felicity gave me this,

466
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,018
she told me it was about reconnecting.

467
00:21:11,983 --> 00:21:15,051
And it led me here to you.

468
00:21:15,053 --> 00:21:17,153
That can't be a coincidence.

469
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,324
I know exactly where this is.

470
00:21:22,327 --> 00:21:24,346
Come on.

471
00:21:32,837 --> 00:21:34,804
Hey, where's the D.A.?

472
00:21:34,806 --> 00:21:36,906
She said she needed some air.

473
00:21:36,908 --> 00:21:38,674
Damn it.

474
00:21:40,588 --> 00:21:43,312
I'm still a ways off
from repairing the laptop,

475
00:21:43,314 --> 00:21:45,114
but I have compiled a list of known

476
00:21:45,116 --> 00:21:47,016
directed energy weapons,
which could be powered

477
00:21:47,018 --> 00:21:48,918
using a modified battery.

478
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,487
This list has too many potential targets

479
00:21:51,489 --> 00:21:53,445
for this agency to reasonably protect.

480
00:21:53,448 --> 00:21:55,224
We need whatever's on that laptop.

481
00:21:55,226 --> 00:21:56,726
You blocked my computer?

482
00:21:56,728 --> 00:21:58,227
What the hell, John?

483
00:21:58,229 --> 00:21:59,627
That's my cue. Heh.

484
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:03,085
Felicity, we can no longer risk you

485
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,667
interfering with this mission.

486
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:05,901
This is not Team Arrow.

487
00:22:05,903 --> 00:22:07,136
This is an A.R.G.U.S. operation.

488
00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:08,347
Please. I'm asking for your patience.

489
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:10,338
I'm out of patience, John.

490
00:22:10,341 --> 00:22:13,542
You have your life,
your home, your family,

491
00:22:13,544 --> 00:22:15,678
but I lost everything,
and bringing down Diaz

492
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,222
is the only way for
me to get it all back.

493
00:22:17,224 --> 00:22:19,463
Felicity, you can't get it back.

494
00:22:19,466 --> 00:22:22,200
Your old life... Our
old life... is over.

495
00:22:25,356 --> 00:22:28,524
And taking down Diaz
will not change that.

496
00:22:34,365 --> 00:22:36,165
Oliver's gone,

497
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:39,835
and he is not coming
back for a very long time.

498
00:22:39,837 --> 00:22:42,171
I need you to accept that.

499
00:22:42,173 --> 00:22:44,140
I can't...

500
00:22:44,142 --> 00:22:46,475
And I won't.

501
00:22:46,477 --> 00:22:50,157
And I can't believe that you do.

502
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,360
The old John would've done anything

503
00:22:52,363 --> 00:22:55,158
to bring down that monster,
and you're... you're here.

504
00:22:55,161 --> 00:22:56,810
And you wouldn't even take
up the Green Arrow mantle...

505
00:22:56,812 --> 00:22:59,501
The only thing that
Oliver asked you to do.

506
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:01,340
You've moved on with your life.

507
00:23:01,343 --> 00:23:04,517
The last 6 years actually
meant something to me.

508
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,695
So I am going to stop
Diaz, whatever it takes,

509
00:23:07,698 --> 00:23:10,232
even if I have to do it alone.

510
00:23:19,043 --> 00:23:20,916
You know, just because
Yorke doesn't dirty,

511
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:22,845
doesn't mean we can't get him fired.

512
00:23:22,847 --> 00:23:24,914
Blackmail's pretty much a prerequisite

513
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:26,482
for getting in this place.

514
00:23:26,484 --> 00:23:31,369
I'm not about to ruin an
innocent man's life, okay?

515
00:23:31,372 --> 00:23:34,390
Not the Green Arrow way. Noted.

516
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,337
I'm starting to think

517
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,064
you've lost interest in
my information, queen.

518
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:47,436
Yorke's clean.

519
00:23:47,438 --> 00:23:50,206
There are other ways of
getting rid of somebody,

520
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:51,941
a more permanent way.

521
00:23:53,814 --> 00:23:55,547
That's not how I do things.

522
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,817
That's not how you do things out there.

523
00:23:59,717 --> 00:24:01,791
You asked me to take care of Yorke.

524
00:24:01,794 --> 00:24:03,185
You didn't say how.

525
00:24:03,187 --> 00:24:05,154
Well, let me make this clear.

526
00:24:06,491 --> 00:24:09,254
You use that to get rid of Yorke,

527
00:24:09,257 --> 00:24:10,990
or I will.

528
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:25,755
Cell check!

529
00:24:28,027 --> 00:24:30,466
Cell check time.

530
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,703
You're up, 4587.

531
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,724
You know the drill.

532
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,513
Yorke, you need to listen to me.

533
00:24:48,516 --> 00:24:51,015
No chitchat, inmate.

534
00:24:51,017 --> 00:24:53,517
Someone in here wants you dead.

535
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,221
News flash: everyone
in here wants me dead.

536
00:24:57,223 --> 00:24:59,747
Yorke, I don't care if
you quit or transfer,

537
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,182
but whatever you do,
you need to do it today.

538
00:25:02,185 --> 00:25:03,169
Do you understand?

539
00:25:03,172 --> 00:25:04,995
I have no idea what kind
of game you're playing,

540
00:25:04,997 --> 00:25:07,865
but if you don't knock it off, I promise

541
00:25:07,867 --> 00:25:09,278
you'll regret it.

542
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:12,516
I'm not playing a game.
I am trying to help you.

543
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:14,552
I don't need your help, inmate.

544
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:19,543
I just want to do the right thing.

545
00:25:19,545 --> 00:25:20,872
The right thing?

546
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:26,591
Is that what you were doing,

547
00:25:26,594 --> 00:25:29,194
running around in that costume?

548
00:25:29,197 --> 00:25:32,185
You turned the law into a joke.

549
00:25:32,188 --> 00:25:34,824
The Green Arrow's very existence

550
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:37,461
invited criminals into your city.

551
00:25:37,463 --> 00:25:39,863
You think you're some kind of hero.

552
00:25:39,865 --> 00:25:42,399
Have you ever stopped to think

553
00:25:42,401 --> 00:25:46,103
maybe all you've done
is make things worse?

554
00:25:54,747 --> 00:25:56,013
Hey. Can we talk?

555
00:25:56,015 --> 00:25:58,749
Not unless it's about Diaz.

556
00:26:03,055 --> 00:26:04,791
Felicity, I want you
to know I understand

557
00:26:04,794 --> 00:26:06,060
why you're angry at me.

558
00:26:07,383 --> 00:26:09,757
But I have not forgotten
Oliver or this team

559
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,760
or you.

560
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:17,271
But I need you to hear why I chose

561
00:26:17,274 --> 00:26:19,736
not to become the Green Arrow.

562
00:26:19,739 --> 00:26:24,508
Felicity, I watched as
Oliver, you, and William

563
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,474
lost everything important in life

564
00:26:26,477 --> 00:26:27,825
because of that hood.

565
00:26:27,828 --> 00:26:29,422
And I wanted to.

566
00:26:29,425 --> 00:26:31,914
I wanted to put it on
because Oliver asked me to,

567
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:33,333
but I couldn't.

568
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:39,224
The truth is...

569
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,934
I saw what the hood did
to you and your family.

570
00:26:46,499 --> 00:26:49,166
And I couldn't do it to mine.

571
00:26:49,168 --> 00:26:51,535
Maybe that was selfish,

572
00:26:51,537 --> 00:26:54,938
but I just couldn't make
that kind of sacrifice,

573
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,200
and I couldn't ask that of Lyla or J.J.

574
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:02,078
It's not selfish.

575
00:27:02,081 --> 00:27:04,630
I'd like to think that I'm
honoring Oliver's mission

576
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:06,450
without putting that suit on.

577
00:27:06,453 --> 00:27:09,487
I respect that you
want to keep fighting.

578
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,107
Oliver turned himself in

579
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,372
so the FBI would help us take down Diaz.

580
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:15,716
I may not agree with the decision,

581
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:18,320
but as long as Diaz is still out there,

582
00:27:18,323 --> 00:27:22,161
Oliver's sacrifice will
have been for nothing.

583
00:27:24,403 --> 00:27:26,770
Sorry to interrupt. John,
you have to see this.

584
00:27:26,772 --> 00:27:28,904
I was finally able to pull the
data from that damaged hard drive.

585
00:27:28,906 --> 00:27:30,810
Look what I found: Train schematics.

586
00:27:30,813 --> 00:27:31,950
Let me guess.

587
00:27:31,953 --> 00:27:34,044
One of these directed
energy weapons on your list

588
00:27:34,047 --> 00:27:35,845
is being transported by train.

589
00:27:35,848 --> 00:27:38,048
Yup. It's being shipped out of Star City

590
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,424
for testing tonight.

591
00:27:39,427 --> 00:27:40,577
We can't let the Longbow Hunters

592
00:27:40,579 --> 00:27:41,849
get their hands on that weapon.

593
00:27:41,852 --> 00:27:44,442
John, wait. No one knows the
Longbow Hunters better that I do.

594
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:48,667
Felicity, if you're gonna help, you
got to do this the A.R.G.U.S. way. Deal?

595
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,060
Deal.

596
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:59,735
Hey.

597
00:27:59,738 --> 00:28:01,716
What are you doing here?

598
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:03,919
You know, I should be
asking you the same question.

599
00:28:03,922 --> 00:28:05,488
How did you find me?

600
00:28:05,491 --> 00:28:08,759
Well, I am a cop, Laurel.

601
00:28:08,762 --> 00:28:10,713
What is this place?

602
00:28:10,716 --> 00:28:15,052
Diaz bought it right after
he joined the quadrant.

603
00:28:15,054 --> 00:28:16,513
Planning on renovating,

604
00:28:16,516 --> 00:28:19,589
he wanted to turn it
into his own castle.

605
00:28:19,592 --> 00:28:21,592
And you think he's in there?

606
00:28:21,594 --> 00:28:24,928
Well, I don't think he's
welcome at the Star City Plaza.

607
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,497
All right. Fine.

608
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:28,739
Call it in, then.

609
00:28:28,742 --> 00:28:32,101
No, no. This is my fight.

610
00:28:32,104 --> 00:28:35,839
Oh. Heh. Right.

611
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:39,122
This is what you've been
planning all along, isn't it?

612
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:41,125
This is why you've been
refusing protection.

613
00:28:41,128 --> 00:28:42,928
Because you're going to kill him.

614
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:44,797
Let's hope so.

615
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,284
If Diaz is in this building,
the SCPD is going to be

616
00:28:47,286 --> 00:28:48,442
the one to take him down,

617
00:28:48,445 --> 00:28:49,881
and we're going to do it the right way.

618
00:28:49,883 --> 00:28:52,724
I'm not interested in
doing things the right way.

619
00:28:52,727 --> 00:28:55,028
That monster killed Quentin.

620
00:28:55,031 --> 00:28:56,560
I want to see him in hell,

621
00:28:56,563 --> 00:28:59,064
and I want to be the one
that sends him there myself.

622
00:28:59,067 --> 00:29:04,849
You know, I knew you were faking
it this whole time, Laurel.

623
00:29:04,852 --> 00:29:09,560
Becoming the D.A. and all your
B.S. talk about the rule of law.

624
00:29:09,563 --> 00:29:10,649
You know, deep down,

625
00:29:10,652 --> 00:29:13,403
you are still the same lying murderer

626
00:29:13,406 --> 00:29:15,306
who killed the man I loved.

627
00:29:17,054 --> 00:29:19,955
I'm not that person anymore.

628
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:22,630
But someone has to get
justice for Quentin,

629
00:29:22,633 --> 00:29:24,687
and you know it.

630
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,825
So don't you dare try and stop me.

631
00:29:36,268 --> 00:29:37,966
Alpha team's in position.

632
00:29:37,969 --> 00:29:39,268
Sitrep?

633
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:40,834
The train is right on schedule.

634
00:29:40,836 --> 00:29:43,153
60 seconds till the first
car reaches your position.

635
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,756
Copy that.

636
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:46,599
Overwatch, you ready for this?

637
00:29:46,602 --> 00:29:48,836
Oh, I've been ready for 5 months.

638
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:01,945
Overwatch, I'm on the train.

639
00:30:01,948 --> 00:30:02,989
Copy that.

640
00:30:02,991 --> 00:30:04,775
I've logged into the train
control and management system.

641
00:30:04,777 --> 00:30:06,414
I'm now inside the brain of the train.

642
00:30:06,417 --> 00:30:07,719
Where's the weapon?

643
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,121
It's in the fourth car from the back.

644
00:30:09,123 --> 00:30:10,696
- Any sign of our friends?
- Not yet.

645
00:30:10,698 --> 00:30:11,996
You're coming up on the Bader tunnel.

646
00:30:11,998 --> 00:30:15,503
We will have a snapshot from their
thermal imaging camera in about 30 seconds.

647
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:27,417
Hey. That way.

648
00:30:34,577 --> 00:30:36,410
That'll be the engineer.

649
00:30:36,413 --> 00:30:39,581
There. That'll be the Longbow
Hunters... Two of them, at least.

650
00:30:39,584 --> 00:30:42,952
John, we got two bogies, both in
the baggage car in front of you.

651
00:30:42,955 --> 00:30:44,488
Where's the other one?

652
00:30:44,491 --> 00:30:46,524
Oh, my god. John, he's right above you.

653
00:30:51,653 --> 00:30:53,105
Hold your fire!

654
00:31:16,465 --> 00:31:18,206
Get to the weapon!

655
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:04,846
Hello there.

656
00:32:04,849 --> 00:32:06,315
It's gas!

657
00:32:06,318 --> 00:32:08,105
Get out of here! Go! Go! Go!

658
00:32:11,385 --> 00:32:15,273
Oops. Guess it's locked.

659
00:32:21,186 --> 00:32:22,452
Overwatch, I'm trapped!

660
00:32:22,455 --> 00:32:24,021
Already on it. Hang on, John.

661
00:32:33,192 --> 00:32:35,261
Diaz.

662
00:32:35,264 --> 00:32:37,839
Diaz is there?

663
00:32:37,842 --> 00:32:39,007
Felicity!

664
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:41,355
Sorry! On it. Got it.

665
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,957
You're almost there. The weapon
is two cars in front of you.

666
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:47,693
Go help the others!
I'll secure the weapon.

667
00:33:16,508 --> 00:33:18,141
Are you ok?

668
00:33:18,144 --> 00:33:19,730
Yeah, I think so.

669
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:22,167
How the hell did she do that?

670
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:25,671
I have no idea.

671
00:33:25,674 --> 00:33:28,605
Diaz, freeze!

672
00:33:28,608 --> 00:33:31,175
Hands up, slowly.

673
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:35,978
You miss me, John?

674
00:33:55,845 --> 00:33:57,178
Yeah!

675
00:34:12,883 --> 00:34:14,849
Hyah!

676
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:17,034
Uh!

677
00:34:29,754 --> 00:34:31,487
I've got the battery.

678
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:32,847
Felicity, when I tell you,

679
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:34,566
I need you to uncouple that flatcar.

680
00:34:34,569 --> 00:34:36,403
What? No.

681
00:34:36,406 --> 00:34:38,073
We can't let Diaz escape.

682
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,610
We can't let him get ahold
of that weapon either!

683
00:34:40,613 --> 00:34:42,941
Felicity, do it now!

684
00:34:42,944 --> 00:34:45,478
I can't. He'll get away.

685
00:35:08,596 --> 00:35:11,864
I thought I could do it, your way.

686
00:35:11,867 --> 00:35:14,096
And then I saw Diaz.

687
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:16,566
There's no need to explain.

688
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,416
I just wanted to make sure you're okay.

689
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,051
I'm not.

690
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,787
I understand why you did what you did.

691
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,555
The world is a safer place

692
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:28,824
because Diaz doesn't have that weapon.

693
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:30,292
I was wrong before.

694
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,161
You may now be working
here at A.R.G.U.S.,

695
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:35,231
but you're still
honoring Oliver's mission.

696
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,966
I appreciate your saying that.

697
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,103
But I still can't rest until I know

698
00:35:39,106 --> 00:35:40,906
that my family is safe...

699
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:46,272
Which means I need to work
with someone whose focus is

700
00:35:46,275 --> 00:35:48,110
bringing down Diaz...

701
00:35:49,852 --> 00:35:52,319
And that someone is not you.

702
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,721
I'm guessing that was your
last mission with A.R.G.U.S.

703
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,853
- Yeah.
- And probably with me, too.

704
00:36:00,856 --> 00:36:02,684
I'm sorry, Curtis.

705
00:36:02,687 --> 00:36:04,283
What are you gonna do?

706
00:36:04,286 --> 00:36:06,205
Find help somewhere else.

707
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,142
I don't think you understand our deal.

708
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:22,877
It's a limited-time offer,

709
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,101
and it's just about to expire.

710
00:36:25,104 --> 00:36:27,447
I understand.

711
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,213
I'm gonna take care of him.

712
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,932
Oliver told me what was
buried on this island.

713
00:36:44,935 --> 00:36:46,197
When I got here,

714
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,353
I found the 4 graves
that he had mentioned,

715
00:36:48,356 --> 00:36:49,989
but then...

716
00:36:49,992 --> 00:36:52,607
Then I found this one

717
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,277
so, look, I can take care of
this on my own if you want.

718
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,783
Look, I would love to miss out

719
00:36:56,786 --> 00:36:58,848
on staring into the face
of a desiccated corpse,

720
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,916
but I think it'll go quicker if I help.

721
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,078
I don't get it. It's my father's bow.

722
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,510
I can't even shoot an arrow.

723
00:37:30,513 --> 00:37:32,379
Why would Felicity want me to have this?

724
00:37:32,382 --> 00:37:33,994
I know why.

725
00:37:49,241 --> 00:37:51,041
Wait. What the hell?

726
00:37:51,044 --> 00:37:52,498
Grab your stuff. We're going back.

727
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:55,478
- Back? Back where?
- To Star City.

728
00:38:10,838 --> 00:38:12,369
Laurel.

729
00:38:12,372 --> 00:38:15,057
Isn't that supposed to be a doughnut?

730
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:17,002
So funny.

731
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:19,072
Can you give us a minute?

732
00:38:24,976 --> 00:38:27,911
I just... uh, I wanted
to come by and thank you

733
00:38:27,914 --> 00:38:29,513
for the backup.

734
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:35,218
Also, from now on, I will
be accepting protection

735
00:38:35,221 --> 00:38:36,979
from the SCPD.

736
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,650
No more ditching, no more complaining.

737
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:42,596
Well, maybe a little complaining.

738
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:45,932
Well, uh, I appreciate that.

739
00:38:48,755 --> 00:38:50,458
Anything else?

740
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:53,369
No. That's it.

741
00:38:57,602 --> 00:38:59,682
Actually, that's not it.

742
00:39:02,736 --> 00:39:05,397
I know that Quentin wasn't my father...

743
00:39:06,568 --> 00:39:09,310
Not... not the father
that raised me anyway.

744
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:13,408
And... I guess I had just forgotten

745
00:39:13,411 --> 00:39:18,281
what it felt like to have
someone who cared about me.

746
00:39:18,284 --> 00:39:22,720
And losing him, it was the worst pain

747
00:39:22,723 --> 00:39:25,256
that I've felt in a very long time.

748
00:39:25,259 --> 00:39:28,397
And I can only imagine
how you must have felt

749
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:31,392
after Vinny's death.

750
00:39:31,395 --> 00:39:32,853
Please don't.

751
00:39:32,856 --> 00:39:35,456
Listen, I don't expect
you to forgive me...

752
00:39:37,857 --> 00:39:41,174
But I have to tell you
that I am truly sorry

753
00:39:41,177 --> 00:39:42,908
about killing Vinny.

754
00:39:44,503 --> 00:39:45,836
And I hope one day,

755
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,010
you'll see that I am not that person.

756
00:39:51,453 --> 00:39:52,963
Not anymore.

757
00:40:03,393 --> 00:40:05,916
This Diaz guy seems
like a real nightmare,

758
00:40:05,919 --> 00:40:09,821
but you sure this is a good idea?

759
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,224
My way's not working.

760
00:40:12,227 --> 00:40:14,432
Do I have a choice?

761
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,854
Hey. Hey!

762
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,390
What's your problem?

763
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:32,054
I know you're not talking to me, inmate.

764
00:40:32,057 --> 00:40:34,260
You've had it in for me since day one.

765
00:40:34,263 --> 00:40:36,263
You need to shut your mouth

766
00:40:36,266 --> 00:40:38,197
and get back.

767
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,370
Do your wife and son
know you're such a dick?

768
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:42,771
What did you just say?

769
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,314
It's Jenna and Noah, right?

770
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:48,475
You don't say their names.

771
00:40:48,478 --> 00:40:52,244
Uh! Uh! Aah.

772
00:40:52,247 --> 00:40:54,533
You... you stabbed me.

773
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:57,019
- What? I didn't stab you.
- Get away from him.

774
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,154
The video! That guard
stabbed me. He stabbed me!

775
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:01,590
I didn't... Dunbar, what are you doing?

776
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:02,822
I didn't touch him.

777
00:41:02,825 --> 00:41:06,503
- Get him out of here.
- No! Wait. No! He's lying!

778
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:08,705
I didn't do anything!

779
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:23,912
Thank you for seeing
me on such short notice.

780
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:26,713
You made a deal with my husband.

781
00:41:26,716 --> 00:41:30,450
And he's in prison because of it.

782
00:41:30,453 --> 00:41:34,855
Now it's your turn to hold
up your side of the bargain.

783
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:41,029
We're gonna take down Ricardo Diaz...

784
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:42,838
Together.

785
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:52,757
