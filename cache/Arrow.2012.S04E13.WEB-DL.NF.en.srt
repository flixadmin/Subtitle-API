1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:03,628
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

2
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:06,839
There's only one way to prevent that.

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,967
My father once told me of an elixir
known as the Lotus.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,262
And I will freely give it to you
on one condition.

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,556
I want you to kill Malcolm Merlyn.

6
00:00:14,847 --> 00:00:17,017
If you cared about Thea,

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,187
then curing her bloodlust
wouldn't come with any condition.

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,106
Thea is my sister-in-law.
You are my husband.

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,774
I'm not your husband.

10
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:27,152
But war does not know family bonds

11
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,528
nor friendly sentiments.

12
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,946
Who are you at war with?

13
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:33,366
I just told you I want you to kill
Malcolm Merlyn. Try to guess.

14
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,410
Hey.

15
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:40,290
If you have a problem with Malcolm Merlyn,
deal with it yourself.

16
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,709
Do not involve me or my sister.

17
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,337
You put the Demon's Head ring
on Malcolm's hand.

18
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,214
You...

19
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:49,966
You can't defeat him.

20
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:51,176
But you can.

21
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,386
-You have!
-And...

22
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,306
That was before I knew
that he was my sister's father.

23
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,934
So he dies so his child might live.
Didn't your father make a similar bargain?

24
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,062
I'm sorry, Oliver.

25
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,397
I would not resort
to this if I had any other choice.

26
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,149
Listen, my sister is dying

27
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,944
because of something that your father did.

28
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,655
I think you have every choice.

29
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,283
Thea is dying
because of what her father did.

30
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,787
I'm only following events
to their inevitable conclusion.

31
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,682
{\an8}You know what's strange?

32
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,101
{\an8}Watching your baby girl drink coffee.

33
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,811
{\an8}Yeah, it would probably be
a little less strange

34
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,231
{\an8}if you'd seen your baby girl
in the last 18 years.

35
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,524
{\an8}You're right.

36
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,194
{\an8}Don't suppose it helps
if I say that I thought

37
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,613
{\an8}staying out of your life
was the best thing for you.

38
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,615
{\an8}I was protecting you and your mother.

39
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:56,991
{\an8}You were protecting yourself.

40
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,661
{\an8}You were wanted by the police
and you didn't want to go to jail.

41
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,621
{\an8}That is why you stayed away.

42
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,248
{\an8}And you know why the police were after me?

43
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,125
{\an8}The type of "criminal" I was?

44
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,628
{\an8}Mom never went into detail.
I assume petty stuff.

45
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,255
{\an8}Anything else requires commitment.

46
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,008
{\an8}Well, I'm here now
and I want us to speak openly.

47
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,885
{\an8}I'll answer any questions you have.

48
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:19,472
{\an8}Okay, I just have one at the moment.
Why now?

49
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,599
{\an8}I was doing a job for someone.

50
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,312
{\an8}Almost got beat. Almost.

51
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,815
{\an8}My adversary had exceptional skills.

52
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:32,109
{\an8}My curiosity piqued,
I investigated further.

53
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,446
{\an8}Imagine what I discovered.

54
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,823
Overwatch.

55
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,621
Bye. See you never.

56
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,333
Felicity, wait. It is not what you think.

57
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,336
{\an8}My employer, my work,
is hardly diabolical.

58
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,254
{\an8}I'll be sure to tell that to my friend
who you blackmailed.

59
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,299
{\an8}Short-term legal mischief
for long-term societal gain.

60
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:57,552
{\an8}Isn't that kind of hacktivism
exactly what you did at MIT?

61
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:01,556
{\an8}Is it really all that different
from the vigilantism you practice today?

62
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:04,934
{\an8}We are the same, you and I.

63
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:09,522
{\an8}I'm pretty sure that I didn't try
to kill 8,000 people.

64
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,150
{\an8}An empty threat. I swear to you.
I know I have no right.

65
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,527
{\an8}I'm asking for a chance.

66
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,947
{\an8}A chance to prove to you
that I'm not a bad guy.

67
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,116
{\an8}And that I'm not a bad guy.

68
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,245
{\an8}What is that?

69
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:26,205
{\an8}A record of some of the hacks
I've done throughout the years.

70
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,625
{\an8}I've selected the ones
that can be verified by news accounts

71
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,835
{\an8}so you know I'm telling the truth.

72
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,588
{\an8}This is very simple for me, Felicity.

73
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,756
{\an8}I want to be back in your life.

74
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,884
{\an8}I know that doing that will require
earning your trust back.

75
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:42,722
{\an8}I hope this is a first step down
that very long road.

76
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:56,694
{\an8}So Nyssa's holding Thea's life hostage
until you kill Malcolm Merlyn.

77
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,988
{\an8}I'll be surprised
if she wasn't the Daughter of the Demon.

78
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:00,823
Oh, it's not funny, John.

79
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,284
No, it's not. Thea's dying.

80
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,660
She's has one, maybe two days.

81
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,870
And if we can save her
by killing the man that killed my sister,

82
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:07,539
then how could you
even think twice about that?

83
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,998
I'm not gonna defend Malcolm.

84
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:12,209
He orchestrated your sister's murder,
he killed Tommy...

85
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,256
{\an8}Nothing is ever gonna change
the fact that he's Thea's family.

86
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,508
{\an8}I don't know how much
you remember of my father,

87
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,967
{\an8}but he was not a good man.

88
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,387
{\an8}He threw in with Malcolm Merlyn.

89
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,680
{\an8}And all of that being said,

90
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,098
{\an8}there is nothing that I wouldn't do
to have him back.

91
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:30,687
{\an8}So you tell me, how am I supposed to take
that away from Thea?

92
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,314
But Oliver,
what's the difference if Thea dies?

93
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,857
It doesn't have to come to that, John.
There's more than one choice here.

94
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,609
-Like what?
-Diplomacy.

95
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,528
What does Nyssa want?

96
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,823
I mean, all Nyssa really wants
is control of the League.

97
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,701
So I need to convince Merlyn
to give her the ring,

98
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,120
she gives us the cure,
and no one has to die.

99
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,916
Laurel, can you convince Nyssa to,
to go along with that?

100
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:53,751
Yeah.
It's easier than talking Malcolm into it.

101
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,795
Well, let me worry about Malcolm.

102
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,509
I don't understand.

103
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,261
{\an8}Why would you save me,
only to kill my brother?

104
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,806
{\an8}Vlad attacked me.

105
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,391
{\an8}Vlad would never do such a thing.

106
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,728
{\an8}I was defending myself.
And I did not know he was your brother.

107
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,062
Would that have made a difference?

108
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:14,230
I didn't have a choice.

109
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,982
There is always a choice.

110
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,318
(SIGHS) I couldn't just let him kill me.

111
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,694
I'm done with you.

112
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,655
Taiana,
I have something that Reiter wants.

113
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,826
Where did you get that?

114
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,328
{\an8}It doesn't matter.

115
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,039
{\an8}I think that we can use this against him.

116
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,916
I have a better idea.

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,335
Hey!

118
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,669
Get Reiter.

119
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:40,632
Tell him I want to talk to him.
I have something that he wants.

120
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,143
Let me see if I've got this right.

121
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:55,104
There's a magic potion
that could cure Thea's bloodlust,

122
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:58,650
that we've never heard of,
but Nyssa "conveniently" has.

123
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,819
I've been holding off telling you
this for years, Oliver.

124
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,906
You're very handsome,
not especially bright.

125
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,366
(SIGHS) Well, bright enough
to have checked.

126
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,910
It's called the Lotus.

127
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,204
Tatsu Yamashiro is part of the order
who guards it.

128
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,291
Or did. They gave it to Nyssa.

129
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:18,545
And if we don't get her
to give it to Thea now...

130
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,465
We're gonna lose her.

131
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,842
Even assuming such an elixir existed,

132
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:28,513
even assuming Ms. Yamashiro's order
parted with it willingly,

133
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:33,309
even assuming Nyssa al Ghul's words
could be trusted, then yes.

134
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,394
Of course, I'd do anything
to save my daughter.

135
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,397
But none of that is true, Oliver.

136
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,526
Look, I appreciate your trying to embrace

137
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,570
a more optimistic viewpoint these days...

138
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,072
Malcolm,
we're talking about your daughter.

139
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:49,784
Yes.
And I need to do something to save her.

140
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:54,080
And you need to stop wasting my time
with Nyssa al Ghul's games.

141
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,759
LOA GUARD: We found her at the perimeter.
She claims to be a friend.

142
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:08,886
And she speaks the truth.

143
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,013
At least until she defiled my beloved

144
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,933
and stood idly by while
I was left to rot in a dungeon.

145
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,102
Leave us.

146
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,859
-Nyssa...
-How is my beloved?

147
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:26,070
Sara's good. She's whole.
I think she's happy.

148
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:27,572
If you're here about Thea...

149
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,031
Nyssa, what are you doing?

150
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:30,241
Protecting my birthright.

151
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,243
By holding Thea's life hostage?

152
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,580
You say that as if she didn't fire
the arrows that felled your sister.

153
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,499
You and I both know that wasn't her doing.

154
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,917
Yes. It was Malcolm Merlyn.

155
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:43,379
And the time has come for recompense.

156
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:47,258
I will never forgive Merlyn for all
the horrible things that he's done.

157
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:51,554
He's taken people,
two very special people away from me.

158
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,139
Don't you think I want him dead?

159
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,557
Then why are you here?

160
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,519
Because if you want Merlyn dead,
then you have to drive that sword.

161
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,479
And if you can't or if you won't,

162
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,564
we will need to negotiate a compromise.

163
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:06,903
You have my attention.

164
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,364
Oliver convinces Merlyn
to give up the power,

165
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,199
and you...

166
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,703
And you give us the cure.

167
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,081
I would accept those terms.

168
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:21,417
But Merlyn never will.

169
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,544
Let us worry about that.

170
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,961
And by "us," you mean my husband.

171
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,755
LAUREL: Oliver's speaking
with Merlyn right now.

172
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,341
And Merlyn, he is a bastard,

173
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,011
but there is nothing that he wouldn't do
to save his daughter.

174
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,179
I hope so.

175
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,559
Because if he doesn't, it won't just
be Thea's life that is forfeit.

176
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:38,851
What do you mean?

177
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:51,614
NYSSA: There will be war.

178
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:55,367
And the streets of your home will run red
with the blood of our enemies.

179
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:58,329
Whomever they may be.

180
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,461
How'd it go with Merlyn?

181
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,379
Not good. Nyssa?

182
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:10,382
She brought an army. But if you
get her the ring, she'll play ball.

183
00:09:10,507 --> 00:09:12,384
We can get this done
with no one getting hurt.

184
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,804
Everything all right?

185
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,305
No, not really. I mean, it's not great,

186
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:19,141
it's just not quite the level "my sister's
on her deathbed" kind of bad, so...

187
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,393
-What happened?
-My dad came back.

188
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:22,895
DIGGLE: And why is that a bad thing?

189
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,480
Well, it's an extremely long story,

190
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,692
but you remember the super-hacker
who blackmailed Roy? Same guy.

191
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,485
-What?
-Your father is...

192
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,612
The Calculator.

193
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,113
He showed up
at my Palmer Tech presentation.

194
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,823
I had coffee with him yesterday,

195
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,407
where he dropped
the Calculator bomb on me.

196
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,618
And why would he do that?

197
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,995
Apparently,
now that he knows what I do,

198
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:43,040
that we're both "vigilantes,"
we have something in common.

199
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,501
The sickest part is I want to believe him.

200
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,836
I wish there was some sort of test

201
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,088
I could do that would prove
that he is who he says he is.

202
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,547
A test is a good idea.

203
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,383
It's a good idea for you, and for us.

204
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,927
I've got a way to bring Merlyn
to the bargaining table.

205
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,684
I'm not usually one to be summoned
by my prisoners.

206
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,438
I heard you had something for me?

207
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,609
Taiana, please don't.

208
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,611
I have something you want.

209
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,280
Let me out of this cage, and it's yours.

210
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,615
Show me what you have.

(RAGGED BREATHING) Magnificent.

212
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,583
Do we have a deal?

213
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,169
A deal?

214
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,798
-(GASPS)
-REITER: You misunderstood.

215
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,257
It's mine either way.

216
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:37,344
(GRUNTING) I cannot stay here, Reiter.

217
00:10:37,594 --> 00:10:38,888
This man killed my brother.

218
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,933
REITER: And you will continue to care
for him as if he were your brother.

219
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,770
Mr. Queen is an important piece
of my endeavor on this island.

220
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,147
You'll stay here
with him until he's well.

221
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,482
If his health gets worse,

222
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,777
you'll join him in his fate.

(GRUNTING)

224

Your left-side block is slow.

225
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,974
Your next opponent won't have my patience,
or my mercy.

226
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,811
Clearly you don't understand
how this is supposed to work, my husband.

227
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,938
You were supposed to bring
the Magician with you.

228
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,982
Well, I need something from you first.

229
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,567
Proof that what you're offering is real.

230
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,196
A stalling tactic.
Al Sa-her thinks me the fool.

231
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,781
Or that you're one.

232
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,158
Or maybe he doesn't trust
the woman trying to take

233
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,869
the Demon's Head ring from him.

234
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,579
I can't imagine why.

235
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,915
Bring me a sample of the Lotus.

236
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:53,254
I recognize what you're doing.

237
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,797
Part of me even respects it.

238
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:58,009
But the leadership of the League
of Assassins is in the balance here.

239
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,762
It is naive to think this
can be resolved without bloodshed.

240
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,022
This amount is not sufficient
to cure her permanently.

241
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,357
Only to provide
the assurance Merlyn seeks.

242
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,486
Thank you, Nyssa.

243
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:22,241
As I said, someone is going to die.

I pray it won't be your sister.

245
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,338
Was it difficult to get her discharged
from the hospital?

246
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:40,592
No. I spoke to Dr. Lamb.
A friend of the family.

She hooked us up

This buys Thea some more time,

You hand over the Ring, she gives us
the rest of the elixir.

And Thea lives.

Tonight. Laurel's with her now.

Hi. I got your...

Oh, no.
Oh, no, you've Mr. Square Bear face.

What?

Mr. Square Bear.
Oh, my God, you don't remember?

261
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,491
You lost him when you were,
like, four years old.

262
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:49,245
And you had that exact,
you had that exact look on your face.

00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,874
Oh, baby. Is it too much to hope
that you lost a plushy toy?

264
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:57,503
No, but adjusting for age inflation
might be just as bad.

00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,505
Huh?

Yeah.

277

I've just been doing
some checking.

278
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,954
Is it possible that he's not the guy
who we thought he was?

279
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,623
That maybe he's better
than who we thought he was?

No.

281

that your father didn't show up

with some ulterior motive
in your life right now.

283
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,675
But I've been where you are more times
than I care to admit,

00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,261
and it always ends the same way.

He tells you exactly what you want
to hear and you get sucked in.

And the next thing you know,
you have no job, no money,

287
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,439
and a sweet seven-year-old daughter

00:16:27,944 --> 00:16:30,531
-Get out of my way, Oliver!
-Think about Thea!

312
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:35,827
Do not question my love for my daughter!
Everything I do, I do it for her.

313
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:37,163
I'm not moving.

314
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,592
So much for the Gandhi method.

315
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,096
Given who we're dealing with,
we shouldn't be surprised.

316
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:57,224
I cannot believe that being Ra's al Ghul
is more important to Malcolm

317
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,850
than saving his daughter's life.

318
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,561
I know that you're trying a new approach.

319
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,189
But just because you've changed,
that doesn't mean everybody else has.

320
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,026
Yeah. We cannot allow a League civil war.

321
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,860
Too many people will be collateral damage.

322
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,738
And the four of us definitely can't take
on two armies of assassins.

323
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:13,365
Then we take on the generals.

324
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,534
We need to work on locating
Nyssa and Malcolm.

325
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,868
But mainly Nyssa.

326
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,787
Because she's got the whole
Lotus cure thing.

327
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,623
We find both of them.
No one else dies tonight.

328
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,252
Especially Thea.

329
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:35,887
You need this to keep your fever at bay.

330
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,391
If it comes back, well,
that would be very bad.

331
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,017
I'm surprised you still care.

332
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,979
Baron Reiter made it very clear
what happens to me if you die.

333
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,148
Taiana, I know what you're going through.

334
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,402
It's this feeling
in the pit of your stomach.

335
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,490
-Just... Emptiness.
-Don't you dare

336
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,493
try to help me mourn my brother,
that you took from me.

337
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,246
-Please, just listen...
-You know nothing about how I feel.

338
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,875
A man with a heart as small as yours
is incapable of such things.

339
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,629
My father sacrificed himself

340
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,423
so I could survive.

341
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,551
So that I could right his wrongs.

342
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,720
He did it by pulling out a gun

343
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,182
and shooting himself in the head,

344
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,310
not three feet from me.

345
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:27,939
Since that day, I have lost

346
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,985
four more people that I love.

347
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,406
That I cared so much about.

348
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,867
It never gets easier. Ever.

349
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,911
I could see it in your eyes.

350
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,914
From the moment we first met.

351
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,291
That I was good?

352
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:50,462
No. That you were lost. Shattered.

353
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,798
(INHALES DEEPLY)

354
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,008
There is a Russian saying,

355
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,762
(SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

356
00:18:58,845 --> 00:19:02,641
"The same hammer that shatters glass,
forges steel."

357
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,894
If you want to be the man
that your father wishes you to be,

358
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,688
then this is how you get there.

359
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:09,690
You save us from Reiter.

360
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,236
But you cannot do that shattered.

361
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,290
Hey.
Everyone's telling the same story.

362
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,667
Guys in black robes fighting each other.

363
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,126
Yeah. League of Assassins.

364
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,503
They're working out
some leadership issues.

365
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,047
Yeah, but how many more people
are gonna die before that happens?

366
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,257
Yeah. We're working on it.

367
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:38,302
You gotta work faster.
Or this is just the beginning.

368
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,763
Hey. I think we need to talk.

369
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,640
About what?

370
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,392
About the elephant in the room.

371
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,395
The way this is going down,
it ends one way.

372
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,481
Malcolm Merlyn.

373
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,524
(SIGHS) He has to be taken down, Oliver.

374
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,734
You're the only man who's ever done it.

375
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,196
Malcolm's killed hundreds of people.
He killed Tommy, he killed Sara.

376
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,907
Thea is dying right now because of events
that he set in motion.

377
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,495
I've never hated anyone the way
that I hate him.

378
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,079
You've been in denial, Oliver.

379
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,040
Holding on to hope with both hands

380
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,709
that you don't have to give
in to that hate.

381
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,504
Use that hate to do what needs to be done.

382
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,882
But Oliver, this needs to be done.

383
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,427
You have to kill Malcolm Merlyn.

384
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,557
I'm glad you called.

385
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,518
Well, all your files checked out.

386
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,353
And I did some additional digging myself.

387
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,771
You're right.

388
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,189
You and I, we're not all that different.

389
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,819
This facility is really amazing.

390
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:40,239
FELICITY: Yes.
After numerous false starts,

391
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,908
we've finally got the R and D section
working like a Swiss watch.

392
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:46,412
This floor contains most of our
bleeding-edge projects. Ah!

393
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,957
That is an autonomous

395

But there are no seams in the casing.

396
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,211
I know. (CHUCKLES)

It's milled
from a single piece of aluminum.

398
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,174
The entire surface connects
to an induction charger.

399
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,759
How did you achieve the heat sink?

400
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,470
Curtis Holt achieved it, actually.
He's quite the genius.

401
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,015
Don't sell yourself short.
You're the Steve Jobs in this equation.

Don't worry, I-I turned it off before
bringing it down here.

470
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,384
-It's not yours?
-It's my father's.

471
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,597
I gave him a little tour
of Curtis' R and D lab,

472
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,265
and he left this behind as a souvenir.

473
00:25:17,348 --> 00:25:19,309
He's trying to steal from Palmer Tech?

474
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,352
It's your idea, actually.

475
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,896
You needed proof about the Lotus.

476
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,439
I needed proof about my dad.

477
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:26,066
You a trap for him as a test?

478
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,319
Unrestricted access to
Palmer Technologies' R and D lab.

479
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,904
He flunked with flying colors.

480
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,198
I don't even know why I'm surprised.

481
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,450
You're surprised because you're hoping

482
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:38,620
that he's the parent
you've always wanted him to be.

483
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:40,956
A parent you deserve.

484
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,168
In an extremely ironic role reversal,
my mother was smarter than me...

485
00:25:45,251 --> 00:25:49,255
She said, "People don't change.

486
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,593
"No matter how much we want them to."

487
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,552
-Some people don't.
-Uh-huh.

488
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,930
I'd like to think that there's hope
for the rest of us.

489
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:02,018
Or I did. As far as Malcolm is concerned,

490
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,605
John thinks I should kill him.

491
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:05,981
If it helps save Thea, I agree.

492
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,859
Yeah, and I agree
if he wasn't Thea's father, but he is.

493
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,652
We are in this mess because of him.

494
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,195
On, like, a million different levels.

495
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:15,365
Let's not pretend that this is a typical
father-daughter relationship.

496
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:18,368
He brainwashed her into killing a friend.

497
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:21,246
I know all this. I do.

498
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:24,833
And I'm still holding out
hope that with...

499
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:29,295
(STUTTERS) With time, and with how much
he says that he loves her,

500
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:33,759
that maybe they have some chance
at some type of normal relationship.

501
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,677
If I kill him,

502
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,848
my sister never gets that chance.

503
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,350
Thea's father is no more likely
to change than mine is.

504
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:43,977
(BEEPING)

505
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,478
What now?

506
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,606
-Found Malcolm.
-Where?

507
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,441
Right underneath us.

508
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,863
Malcolm!

509
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,449
The Lotus effect is wearing off.

510
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,202
She will pass by sunrise.

511
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,038
I would like to be by her side.

512
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,291
This has to end. No more games.

513
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,710
You give Nyssa the damn ring!

514
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,254
She was four months old when we first met.

515
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,467
(SIGHS) Your housekeeper,
Raisa, I believe,

516
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:20,596
was picking you up from our house
with Thea in a stroller.

517
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,891
I peeked my head into the bassinet,

518
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:27,562
and Thea, all of 16 weeks,

519
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,774
she stuck her tongue out at me.

520
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,609
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

521
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,197
I always knew I was connected to her.

522
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:42,493
As if, on some primal level,
I knew I was her father.

523
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:46,456
A real father wouldn't let their child die

524
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,499
just to keep his hands on power.

525
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,210
That is not what I am doing.

526
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:53,421
What's unfolding here is larger than I.

527
00:27:53,504 --> 00:27:55,090
And it is bigger than my daughter.

528
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,383
It's not just her life that hangs
in the balance, Oliver.

529
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,469
For all your dealings with the League,

530
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,766
you still remain ignorant
to what it is they do for the world.

531
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,310
Enough about the League.
You're a group of assassins.

532
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,520
It is a force of change.

533
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,191
Silently manipulating global events
for hundreds of years.

534
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:17,320
And I cannot, I will not put
that kind of power

535
00:28:17,403 --> 00:28:19,530
into Nyssa al Ghul's hands!

536
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,658
Let me ask you something.

537
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:25,328
If Damien Darhk came to you and told you

538
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,122
to lay down your bow,

539
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,876
let him finish his plan for Star City,
would you do it?

540
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,462
Even if it meant saving William's life?

541
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,762
I know everything about you, Oliver.

542
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,766
I am Ra's al Ghul.

543
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,601
But back to the matter at hand,

544
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,063
you will never sacrifice your city
to save your son.

545
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:56,109
And believe me when I tell you
that I am only making the same choice.

546
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,903
I would look for another choice.

547
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:01,447
And I wouldn't stop looking
until there was a third option!

548
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,826
Malcolm, what if,

549
00:29:06,577 --> 00:29:10,916
what if you could have
the Lotus and keep your ring?

550
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,583
I don't see how.

551
00:29:13,709 --> 00:29:16,212
Nyssa's forces are stronger
than I'd care to admit.

552
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,839
Not by herself.

553
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,759
You challenge her to a trial by combat.

554
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:23,094
You do realize your plan
would end in her death.

555
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,767
We're all backed into a corner, Malcolm.

556
00:29:30,726 --> 00:29:31,895
Nyssa made her bed.

557
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,780
This is one of your crazier ideas
and that is a competitive field.

558
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,365
Well, sit tight.
I have a crazier one coming.

559
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:57,420
In deference to good taste,
we will forgo the removal of shirts.

560
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,340
Let us be finished with the charade.

561
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,550
As you wish.

562
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,480
OLIVER: Hold!

563
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,566
In the eyes of the League,

564
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,069
this woman is my wife.

565
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,531
As your husband,

566
00:30:26,782 --> 00:30:28,701
I wish to fight on her behalf.

567
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,462
I have never allowed anyone
to fight my battles for me.

568
00:30:39,545 --> 00:30:41,256
Do you want to become Ra's
or do you want to die?

569
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,507
Why are you doing this?

570
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,259
You told me yourself,
you couldn't defeat Merlyn.

571
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:48,263
If I am forced to choose
between your life and his,

572
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,851
then I will see justice done.

573
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,947
I'm a little disappointed, I must say.

574
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,824
You're the one who put us
in this position, Malcolm.

575
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:13,454
Can I remind you the role you played
in putting this ring on my finger?

576
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,040
No, I remember.

577
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,251
Tonight, I correct that mistake.

578
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,878
I can't believe it.

579
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:23,882
You've grown even more foolish
with experience.

580
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,716
Three years!

581
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,595
Let's finish this.

-Last chance, Malcolm. Yield!
-Never!

585
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,129
To end this, you must kill me.

586
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,550
But you always knew that, Oliver.

587
00:32:07,633 --> 00:32:10,261
-I don't want it to end this way.
-Spare me your false sympathy.

588
00:32:10,636 --> 00:32:12,055
Just do it.

Bring me the Lotus.

00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,073
You are Ra's al Ghul.

592
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,075
Thank you, husband.

Is everything okay?

00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,229
That, uh, depends.

598
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,648
How are you feeling?

599
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:48,109
I'm... (GRUNTS)

What am I doing here?

You know, it's a long story.
But to shorthand it...

Is that you're gonna be fine.

Ooh, yeah, not to be the buzzkill,

611

but when are we going to tell Thea
about Malcolm's...

Right.

What's up?

615
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,730
Something my father said.

NOAH: I brought you a portable ramp.

617

a higher surface, just unfold it.

Look, I have a meeting in a few.

620
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,579
I just wanted to say goodbye.

621
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:42,955
Goodbye?

622
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,250
We were just starting
to get to know each other.

623
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,085
I think I know everything I need to know.

625
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,589
I thought we were making progress.

626
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,591
When I was a girl, I hated myself.

627
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,677
I thought I was broken,
that no one could or ever would love me.

00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,972
It's the only way a child can grow up
when their father abandons them.

629
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:01,891
Felicity...

630
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,643
All I ever wanted
to know was why?

631
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:06,937
What was so wrong with me
that you would leave?

632
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:09,815
There was nothing
wrong with you, sweetheart.

633
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,277
But there was everything wrong with me.

634
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:15,196
The police, the FBI. They were never
going to stop looking for me.

635
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,532
I realized a life on the run,

636
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,618
that wasn't the life that I owed you
or your mother.

637
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,496
So I disappeared.

638
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,290
You thought you were doing
the right thing for us.

639
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,624
Exactly.

640
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,961
I have waited my entire life
for that explanation.

641
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,882
And the thing is,
I don't even know if believe it.

642
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,259
It's the truth.

643
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:39,053
There is only one part of your story
that I know to be true.

644
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,431
And that is that
you are wanted by the police.

645
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,726
Felicity.

646
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,102
I just need you to know one thing.

647
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:50,565
You were wrong. I am nothing like you.

648
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,066
NOAH: Felicity...
QUENTIN: Noah, come on.

649
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,569
You're under arrest. Anything you say
or do can and will be used

650
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,696
against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.

651
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:57,738
NOAH: No! No, don't, don't...
Don't do this.

652
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,407
Felicity!

653
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,455
Thank you both for coming.

654
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,166
How is Thea?

655
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,417
Don't pretend like you care.

656
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,170
I do. She's my sister-in-law.

657
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,256
And her condition is the result
of my father's blade.

658
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:19,051
You were right. Even after his death,
I remained my father's prisoner.

659
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,805
I allowed him to turn me into someone
you showed me I don't have to be.

660
00:36:26,141 --> 00:36:27,393
And you showed me as well

661
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:28,978
when you took up the sword
to save my life.

662
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:34,525
You both showed me what needed to be done.

663
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,776
And what's that?

664
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,028
Patience, please.
We're waiting for one other.

665
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,116
Thank you for coming, Al Sa-her.

666
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,577
You're Ra's. I had no choice.

667
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,746
And so you are mistaken once again.

668
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,126
What are you doing?

669
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:57,882
(GASPS)

670
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,058
Earlier today,
I disbanded the League of Assassins.

671
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:10,561
I released its forces,

672
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,231
much as my father
had released you long ago.

673
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,819
No one will be held prisoner
by my father any longer.

674
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,415
I thought of you as a son once, Oliver.

675
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:34,419
I had more in common with you
than my own blood.

676
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,048
But that's not the reason
why I'm not going to kill you.

677
00:37:39,214 --> 00:37:43,303
Neither the fact
that you are my daughter's brother.

678
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:47,390
The reason you get to live
is because death would be a mercy

679
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:50,476
compared to the debt I now owe you.

680
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,522
Don't you dare threaten me, Malcolm.

681
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,065
(SCOFFS)

682
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,280
Taiana,

683
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,991
I promise I will free your friends...

684
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:08,994
For Vlad.

685
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:12,790
Vlad is dead. We do this for them.

686
00:38:14,124 --> 00:38:15,293
REITER: Mr. Queen.

687
00:38:16,126 --> 00:38:18,296
I hope you have regained your strength.

688
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,090
The stone you gave me
was the final piece of the puzzle.

689
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:24,176
The final map. We are going to dig.

690
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,472
-Dig?
-The heaven I seek is not above,

691
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:30,140
but rather beneath our feet.

692
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,685
We dig at daybreak.

693
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,151
Hey.

694
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,153
Are you feeling any better?

695
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,572
I don't even know why I'm so upset.

696
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,659
Doesn't every long-awaited
father-daughter reunion end

697
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,578
with the dad being
taken away in handcuffs?

698
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,246
You don't have to be funny for me.

699
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,583
-You know that, right?
-I know.

700
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,878
And I know I did the right thing.

701
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,173
But the look on his face when he realized
I had turned him in,

702
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,134
that's going to haunt me
for the rest of my life.

703
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,012
And I can't help but think he doesn't even
deserve that kind of remorse.

704
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,723
I think that remorse
is a pretty clear indicator

705
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:13,351
that you are a very different person
than him.

706
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:16,521
Maybe Thea and I could make t-shirts.
We could join a club.

707
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:18,939
Listen to me.

708
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,609
Don't make the mistake of thinking
that this thing with your dad is over.

709
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,362
I can tell you from experience

710
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,865
that closure does not come that easily.

711
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,492
(GRUNTS)

712
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,911
Speaking of closure,

713
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:34,246
are you punishing yourself
for betraying Malcolm?

714
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,040
Is that insane?

715
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:39,126
Yes. But it's part of what makes you
the man I love.

716
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,128
John was right.

717
00:39:41,211 --> 00:39:43,130
You were faced
with an impossible situation

718
00:39:43,213 --> 00:39:45,132
and you found the best way out of it.

719
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,556
Will you marry me?

720
00:39:52,347 --> 00:39:54,099
I think I already answered that question.

721
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,602
Thea's better. Andy's better.

722
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,146
Things are quiet on the Darhk front.

723
00:39:59,229 --> 00:40:01,441
I feel like this might be our window.

724
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,276
And with everything that we have gone
through for the past few months,

725
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:05,903
I want you to tell me,

726
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,113
why are we waiting?

727
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,825
-Well, I have to plan it.
-Mmm-hmm.

728
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,661
(SIGHS) Maybe just a small ceremony
with a few of our friends,

729
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,830
and no caterers. My mom will hate that.

730
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,875
I'm in.

731
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,126
Mmm.

732
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,429
I don't like to be kept waiting.

733
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:35,265
My apologies.
I don't have the resources I once had.

734
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,935
Yes. I'm aware
of your recent reversal of fortune.

735
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,895
I take it that's why
you asked for this meeting?

736
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,606
Well, I haven't come empty-handed.

737
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,398
-So to speak.
-(CHUCKLES)

738
00:40:45,275 --> 00:40:48,488
I have some information that you
might find of particular interest.

739
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:53,367
I know who Oliver Queen cares about more
than anyone in the whole world.

740
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,537
Yeah, so do I. We did a pretty good number
on her over the holidays.

741
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,080
It's not Felicity Smoak.

742
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,213
Who?

743
00:41:06,296 --> 00:41:09,550
His son, William.
