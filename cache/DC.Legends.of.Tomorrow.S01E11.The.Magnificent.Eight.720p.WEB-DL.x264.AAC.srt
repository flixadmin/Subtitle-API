00:00:01,302 --> 00:00:04,832
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:07,539
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:10,509
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

5
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,910
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:14,480
<i>Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed by the body</i>

7
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:17,549
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance to,
the Time Masters.</i>

8
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,985
<i>In the future, my friends
may not be heroes,</i>

9
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:21,720
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

10
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:25,424
<i>they will be remembered
as legends.</i>

11
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:28,894
<i>Previously
on "Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

12
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:30,229
Sorry we're late.

13
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:31,897
<i>Aren't you even
a little bit happy</i>

14
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,265
to be back on the ship?

15
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,900
I was happy with that life
we built together.

16
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:36,769
<i>You think I was hunting you
and your friends</i>

17
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:38,871
<i>because the Time Masters
made me?</i>

18
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:41,240
They barely had to ask.

19
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:42,608
<i>Since I failed
to bring you in,</i>

20
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,676
<i>the Time Masters want
to bring me in.</i>

21
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,578
<i>They're called the Hunters,
and they'll stop at nothing</i>

22
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,415
till every single one of us is
erased from the face of history.

23
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:52,151
- Do you have any suggestions?
- Run.

24
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:04,396
Aah! It's been quite a while
since I time-jumped

25
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,598
far enough to experience
side effects.

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,067
Fond memories.

27
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:10,369
- I can't feel my face.
- Fine feel I.

28
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:13,906
Linguistic dysplasia,
that should pass shortly.

29
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:15,374
Better it now.

30
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:18,177
Am I the only one who can't
feel their face?

31
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:20,913
I can't feel my...
I better not say.

32
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:23,248
Mr. Rory appears unaffected.

33
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,484
What's going on?
We time-jump?

34
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:27,519
Yeah, we time-jumped.

35
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:29,755
But "where to?"
Is the better question.

36
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:34,426
The town of Salvation,
the Dakota territory, 1871.

37
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,958
I can't believe it...
the old west.

38
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:39,498
- This isn't going to work.
- It'll buy us time.

39
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,333
We can hide out here
while the Hunters search

40
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:42,668
the other fragmentations.

41
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,037
What if they decide
to check this place first?

42
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:48,807
You know, feel free to loop us
in whenever it's convenient.

43
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:51,510
As you've seen, time doesn't
operate as is generally thought.

44
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,579
It wants to happen.
It takes time to harden.

45
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:57,015
The... the timeline is unclear
on occasion,

46
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:58,350
constantly in flux.

47
00:01:58,352 --> 00:01:59,852
Hence the difficulty
in locating Savage

48
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:01,153
throughout history.

49
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:02,955
Indeed. And one of the other
interesting notions

50
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:05,524
of time travel is the existence
of fragmentations.

51
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,793
Temporal blind spots,

52
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:11,029
specific places and times
the Time Masters can't see.

53
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:13,298
The town of Salvation
and its surrounding environs

54
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,667
are located within one
of these fragmentations.

55
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,403
So, basically,
we're hiding out in the old west

56
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:22,107
and hoping your boogeymen
don't find us here.

57
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:24,243
The Hunters
are not boogeymen.

58
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:26,311
And you better hope
they don't find us.

59
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,013
Well, at least not until
I get a chance

60
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:31,817
to "punch a few doggies"
or "bust a bronco" or two.

61
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,720
Not that I condone
animal cruelty.

62
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:36,655
It's just that I watched a lot
of westerns as a kid.

63
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:40,092
Alas, you'll have to enjoy
the old west from in here,

64
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:41,193
I'm afraid.

65
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:42,628
Oh, come on.

66
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,964
What's the harm
in us just taking a look around?

67
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,432
With this group?

68
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:49,201
Clearly, you haven't been
paying attention.

69
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:52,104
Ugh, if I'm in the old west
and I don't get to look around,

70
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:53,472
I'm going to kick myself.

71
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:56,008
I could help with that.

72
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,277
I'll keep an eye on them.
Don't worry.

73
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:00,012
I'll be a good boy.

74
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,954
I look just like Wyatt Earp.

75
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,157
Now, the fabricator
can make clothing,

76
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,660
but you're also going to need
era-appropriate protection.

77
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:16,862
This era can get
a little, uh, rough.

78
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,665
- Oh, six shooters?
- Actually, most guns

79
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,500
of that time period
had hammer blocks,

80
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:22,834
thus reducing the number
of shots to five.

81
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,536
Now, this should go
without saying,

82
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,905
but considering this group,
I am going to say it...

83
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:27,906
only use these weapons

84
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:32,144
in the case
of extreme emergencies.

85
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:34,379
You make it sound
like you're not coming with.

86
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,648
From your duster and revolver,
I'd imagined you

87
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,084
as much an old west aficionado
as Dr. Palmer.

88
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,920
Indeed I am. But my time
is best spent back here

89
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:44,890
on the ship, plotting our next
move against Vandal Savage.

90
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,459
Besides, as Mr. Rory says,
it's only a matter of time

91
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:48,994
before the Hunters
find us here.

92
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:51,763
Don't worry. We're not
going to put down roots.

93
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,665
Yeah, we'll stay
out of trouble.

94
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:57,336
Mm, how I hope and pray
that to be true.

95
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,512
<i>Yahoo!</i>

96
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,452
Remember, we're just here
to get the lay of the land.

97
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,154
- No trouble.
- Sure that'll happen.

98
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:51,523
I need a drink.

99
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:54,926
Wow. It's a real
old-timey saloon.

100
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,461
Oh, I beg your pardon.

101
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,163
Not at all, ma'am.

102
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:08,206
That tastes like gasoline.

103
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,742
Pretty much.
Hit me again.

104
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,680
Oh, I'm so sorry.

105
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:17,616
It's no bother.

106
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:27,059
Time doesn't pass normally
in the vanishing point.

107
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:30,295
It's been years since I've seen
the bottom of a glass.

108
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,431
Years?

109
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,266
How long were you...

110
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:36,668
Chronos?

111
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,304
Never counted.
Doesn't matter.

112
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:42,107
Turns out it was
just another gig anyway.

113
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,011
Doesn't seem like it.

114
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,513
You're different now.

115
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,682
Better or worse?

116
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,021
Don't know yet.

117
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,960
You can handle your liquor.
I like that.

118
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:03,995
I've been on more than a few
dates with guys who thought

119
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,964
we'd get wasted
and they'd get lucky,

120
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:10,702
but somehow they always ended up
the ones under the table.

121
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:11,536
Mm.

122
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,638
You haven't drunk with me.

123
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,209
Is that a challenge, Mick?

124
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,744
Line them up.

125
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,147
Didn't know
you played cards.

126
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,284
Like you, Mr. Snart,
I am an enigma.

127
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:27,652
Raise.

128
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,050
Aha.

129
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,990
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- I'm impressed.

130
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:37,996
My father was
what some might call

131
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:41,400
a degenerate gambler,
others would say criminal.

132
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:44,236
When I was old enough, he'd pull
me in on some of his schemes.

133
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,604
I picked up a thing or two

134
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:48,073
at a few of the card tables
he frequented.

135
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,409
Then I took

136
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,944
a different path.

137
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:56,515
Like father, like son isn't
always inevitable, Mr. Snart.

138
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,255
- I had a full boat.
- As did I.

139
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:06,257
Full of kings,
which beats your pair of queens.

140
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,194
Don't I look busy to you?

141
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:11,830
I'm sorry.
I...

142
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:14,299
You spill another drop of that
whiskey, and you will be.

143
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:15,834
Just because you're losing

144
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:18,670
doesn't mean you have
to pick on the waitstaff.

145
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:21,072
Mind your
own business, grandpa.

146
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,741
Unhand the lady.

147
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:25,577
Now, now, boys,
let's just take it easy.

148
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,345
Oh, when my friend here
is being reasonable,

149
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:28,713
we know we have a problem.

150
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:30,482
I'm not the one
with the problem.

151
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:31,950
You are.

152
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,826
You killed him.

153
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:43,061
You're welcome.

154
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,069
Clearly, the deceased
was a friend of yours,

155
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:51,937
but my friend here...

156
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:54,072
Your friend drew first,

157
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,440
got put down.

158
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:56,842
It was a clean shot.

159
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:58,677
Do we look like we care
about clean?

160
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:01,446
He has a point.

161
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:29,307
All right!

162
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,909
Playtime's over.

163
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:33,478
Anybody's got a problem
with that,

164
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,380
they answer to me.

165
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,486
Thank you,

166
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:42,687
Mister...

167
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,456
Hex.

168
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,991
Jonah Hex.

169
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:48,460
You're not from around here,
are you?

170
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:49,661
No.

171
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,197
My friends and I are, uh...

172
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,065
From out of town.

173
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,335
Way out of town.

174
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:59,638
All right.

175
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,140
Why don't you folks tell me
where you're really from?

176
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,776
I'm not sure that's
any of your business, sir.

177
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:07,879
Let me rephrase that.

178
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,049
Tell me when y'all from.

179
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,418
You seven stick out
like a dog in a manger.

180
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,154
Like he said,
we're not from around here.

181
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,223
You think you're
the first time travelers

182
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,991
I've ever come across?

183
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:22,227
Uh, yes.

184
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,795
Where is he?

185
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:26,298
I got some words
that need saying.

186
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,732
Where is who?

187
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,703
Rip Hunter.

188
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,046
What is it about you people

189
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:42,681
that whenever we go
to a new timeline,

190
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:46,384
you feel the need
to pick up...

191
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,219
Strays?

192
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,322
Nice.

193
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:52,390
I didn't get to see it
last time around.

194
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:53,758
Last time?

195
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,427
A long story,
which we will not be telling.

196
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,662
My coat suits you good.

197
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:58,897
What are you
doing here, Jonah?

198
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,533
Collecting on a bounty,

199
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,268
wetting my whistle,

200
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,204
when your friends here
got in a lot of trouble.

201
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:09,708
We might've gotten into
a barroom brawl back in town.

202
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,776
Well, that was
entirely predictable.

203
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,714
One of them poured lead into a
member of the Stillwater Gang.

204
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:17,849
- Mr. Rory.
- Snart, actually.

205
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:19,684
Oh, that was
gonna be my next guess.

206
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,419
This guy tried
to kill Gray.

207
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,021
Snart saved him.

208
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:26,424
And brought this town a whole
lot of hell in the bargain.

209
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:29,461
Those boys you were trading
hands with in the saloon...

210
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,863
they're all members
of the Stillwater Gang.

211
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,932
Why can't a gang ever be
a bunch of good guys?

212
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,634
Jeb Stillwater
and his friends

213
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:38,737
been raiding this town
for the past three months.

214
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:41,973
Stealing, robbing, killing.

215
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,242
Well, he'll have to go
through us.

216
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,778
No, he won't.

217
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,480
No doubt your...
your little ruckus

218
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,115
has already placed
the timeline at risk,

219
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,017
to say nothing of potentially
alerting the Hunters

220
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,718
to our presence here.

221
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,788
Sounds like someone's planning
on busting out of town again.

222
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,323
Leaving already?

223
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,858
No. No.

224
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,292
Look, this town
is being terrorized

225
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,561
by the Stillwater Gang.

226
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:05,230
And I aim to do something
about it.

227
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:06,297
You "aim to"?

228
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,733
You getting all native on us,
haircut?

229
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,869
Look, we signed on
to this mission...

230
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,570
to stop Vandal Savage.

231
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:14,105
To be heroes.

232
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,608
And saving a town from
a marauding gang of criminals...

233
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,777
that is what heroes do.

234
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,013
Quite a posse of saints

235
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,449
you're riding along
with nowadays.

236
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,819
Hey.
Bridge is, uh, that way.

237
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,621
Yeah, I'm not going
to the bridge. I'm, uh...

238
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:30,655
Where am I going, Gideon?

239
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:31,990
<i>The valley you described</i>

240
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:34,259
<i>is consistent
with Albano Gulch.</i>

241
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:35,560
Yeah, there.

242
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:38,096
Okay, wait. Why?

243
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:40,532
Back at the saloon,
I ran into a woman,

244
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:43,468
and she caused me to have
more memory flashes, so...

245
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,438
I think I might have known her
in one of my past lives.

246
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,140
And if so, she might be able
to help me find Carter.

247
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,309
Wait. So you're just
gonna run out there

248
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:52,377
and try and find her?

249
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,713
Actually, I was planning
on flying.

250
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:57,282
You want
a partner in crime?

251
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:58,883
Okay, fine.

252
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,086
But you're definitely
not carrying me.

253
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,954
How do you propose
we get there?

254
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:11,763
Howdy.

255
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:14,466
I'm Ray...
John Wayne.

256
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,536
What do you want,
Mr. Wayne?

257
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:21,005
Well, I, uh...
I reckon you could use

258
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:23,875
another hand
with the Stillwater Gang.

259
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:28,713
You boys have any experience
with law enforcement?

260
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:32,684
Well, I have a fair bit
of experience fighting crime.

261
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:35,220
Congratulations, then.

262
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,391
You're making me
your deputy?

263
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:43,495
Nope. Just made you
the new sheriff.

264
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:45,930
- Excuse me. What?
- Stillwater Gang

265
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,433
has been shooting up this town
for months now.

266
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,869
It's only by the grace
of the good lord

267
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:54,205
that I'm not
pushing up daisies myself.

268
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:58,042
And I am done
with pushing my luck.

269
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:00,578
But you're the...

270
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,646
Sheriff.

271
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:04,415
Congratulations.

272
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,850
By the way,

273
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,719
you might find a warrant
or two out for me

274
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,454
around these parts.

275
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,790
You know, we have stuff
back on the ship

276
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,658
that can fix your...
You know...

277
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,994
Fix what?

278
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:19,430
Yep. Nothing.
Never mind.

279
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:28,873
What can I get you?

280
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,176
Information.

281
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:33,211
Some friends of mine
are looking for Jeb Stillwater.

282
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:35,079
If they're the same friends
that shot Billy Conlon

283
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:37,282
and beat on
the Stillwater posse,

284
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,617
I can guarantee you
he'll find you.

285
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:43,221
That being said, we'd very
much like to find him first.

286
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:46,257
You got any more
of them greenbacks?

287
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,063
Let me go find a map.

288
00:13:56,369 --> 00:14:00,271
Excuse me, ma'am.
Are you all right?

289
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:01,606
I'm fine.

290
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,708
I just want to be alone.

291
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,276
I understand.

292
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,278
I'm new to these parts.

293
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,317
I didn't think it was customary
for a lady to drink alone.

294
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,918
Tonic water.

295
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
It's for my son.

296
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:19,757
I just needed
a moment to myself.

297
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,093
Is everything all right?

298
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,095
I should be getting
back to my boy.

299
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,263
If there's something
wrong with him,

300
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:27,031
perhaps I can be
of assistance.

301
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,734
I happen to be a scientist.

302
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,569
That's kind.

303
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,205
But I'm afraid
there's nothing you can do.

304
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,008
My boy is going to die.

305
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,210
What's wrong with him?

306
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,118
He has the consumption,
they say.

307
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,786
Tuberculosis.

308
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:52,957
He's been like this on and off
for about a year now.

309
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,261
He always wanted to see
the American West.

310
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:58,129
Our doctor thought
a constitutional

311
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,198
might do him some good.

312
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,233
It hasn't, clearly.

313
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,968
You know,
there are medicines that...

314
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,204
the doctor here says
he has a day...

315
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:08,940
Maybe two, if he's lucky.

316
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:12,176
Does he look lucky to you,
Mister...

317
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,712
I don't know your name.

318
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,514
It's Martin.

319
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,285
Hello, young man.

320
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:22,453
We call him Bertie.

321
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,055
Bertie.

322
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:27,592
Your mother tells me
you wanted to come out west.

323
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:31,562
Can't imagine
you've seen much of it yet.

324
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:34,899
I want to ride
a stagecoach.

325
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:37,435
Well, in that case...

326
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,637
I encourage you
to get better.

327
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:42,707
My mum...
she's not sure I will.

328
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,946
Well, then you must prove
your mother wrong...

329
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,949
So you can ride
that stagecoach.

330
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,100
One of mine is dead.

331
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,835
And this here town's gonna pay.

332
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,013
Now, who the hell
are you supposed to be?

333
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,015
John Wayne...

334
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,783
Salvation's new sheriff.

335
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:29,821
And this here town
is under my protection.

336
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:32,190
Well, you being new and all,

337
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,592
you don't know about
the arrangement that we got.

338
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,862
See, me and my boys,
we ride into town,

339
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,031
we take whatever we want.

340
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,399
In exchange for what?

341
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,701
Not killing nobody.

342
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:47,271
Well, that sounds
reasonable and all,

343
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:50,274
but arrangement's over.

344
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:53,511
Arrangement's over, boys.

345
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,881
They teach you numbers
where it is you're from?

346
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:58,383
'Cause the way I see it,

347
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:00,218
there's only one of you

348
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,753
and a whole mess of us.

349
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,027
You get out of town,
and you don't come back,

350
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,529
or the next bullet goes
in your eye.

351
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,799
I got sharpshooters
all around.

352
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:17,235
You really want to test me?

353
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:23,041
Let's ride, boys.

354
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:26,778
Hyah!

355
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,355
Nice, haircut.

356
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,292
Dude, that was badass.

357
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:42,960
Let's not oversell it.

358
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,629
Running a bad guy
out of town's always been

359
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:46,631
- on my bucket list.
- "Bucket list"?

360
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:50,001
A list of things one hopes
to accomplish before they die.

361
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:52,537
Well, you better hope it's
a real short list, string bean.

362
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,639
We can handle
the Stillwater Gang.

363
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:58,109
Well, you're all just tearing
up the 1870s, aren't you?

364
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:00,344
Stillwater and his gang's
like a hornets' nest,

365
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,880
and your friends here keep
poking at it.

366
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:05,216
They saved the town
from being raided, man.

367
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,952
Today,
but what about tomorrow...

368
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:09,887
Or the day after that?

369
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,556
For a bunch of time travelers,

370
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:14,492
you don't seem to understand
the future much.

371
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:18,496
The day will come
when you'll all leave...

372
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:21,833
And Salvation
will end up like Calvert.

373
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:22,900
What's a Calvert?

374
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:25,536
A closed matter.

375
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:27,872
A word, Mr. Hex?

376
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:30,741
I believe you've all done
enough for one day.

377
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,715
Well, now I definitely want
to know what a Calvert is.

378
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,517
Then it's a good thing
we have access

379
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,919
to a supercomputer.
Gideon?

380
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:45,256
<i>Calvert was a town
in Oklahoma circa 1868.</i>

381
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:46,324
"Was"?

382
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:00,838
You know, there's something
weird going on with your face.

383
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,173
What?

384
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:04,609
You're smiling.

385
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:06,277
I didn't know
you could do that.

386
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,379
Well, don't tell anyone
my secret.

387
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,884
It's just all of this...

388
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:16,154
it's so pure, so simple.

389
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,522
I'd say I miss simple,

390
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,624
but I guess you have
to experience something first

391
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:20,858
to miss it.

392
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,827
I know what you mean.

393
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,596
I've been having more and more
memory flashes lately,

394
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:28,232
and I'm not
entirely sure why.

395
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:32,336
Well, if this woman was a
friend of yours in a past life,

396
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:35,439
hopefully she'll have
another piece for your puzzle.

397
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,746
I feel like I'm being drawn
to this place.

398
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:43,648
Which way?

399
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,782
There.

400
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,563
You know,
stealing's against the law.

401
00:19:58,565 --> 00:19:59,964
I'm the sheriff
of these here parts.

402
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:02,833
How did you know I was
appropriating this medicine?

403
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:05,136
<i>That was my fault,
Professor.</i>

404
00:20:05,138 --> 00:20:06,737
Et tu, Gideon?

405
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:08,539
I suppose this is
going to earn me a lecture

406
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,241
on the perils
of upsetting the timeline

407
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:13,077
by introducing futuristic
medicine to the 19th century.

408
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,279
Well, it seems you've
already given it to yourself.

409
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,081
Except this isn't
futuristic medicine.

410
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,817
I've had Gideon fabricate
simple streptomycin for me.

411
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,285
Excuse me.

412
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:24,188
Which won't be used in medical
treatments for another 70 years.

413
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,623
This is about a boy in town

414
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,558
who's dying
of an easily curable disease.

415
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,027
Just as you couldn't turn
your back on Jeb Stillwater

416
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:32,597
and his gang, I can't turn mine
on this boy and his mother.

417
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,865
Except Dr. Palmer is using
19th-century technology

418
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,601
to deal with Stillwater,
whereas you...

419
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:38,903
just spare me the lecture,
Captain Hunter.

420
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,538
You, of all people...

421
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,907
This isn't
about the mission, Martin!

422
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,775
Do you not recall happened
when Dr. Palmer

423
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:47,278
left a bit of his suit
back in 1975

424
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,213
and nearly destroyed
Central City?

425
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:50,615
That was an accident.

426
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:51,916
I'm not talking
about our mission

427
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:55,419
or Dr. Palmer's
technological gaffe.

428
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,121
Calvert...

429
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:59,857
That town clearly holds some
emotional resonance for you,

430
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:02,360
judging from the looks you've
been exchanging with Mr. Hex.

431
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:04,228
How do you know it's a town?

432
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,596
Gideon?

433
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,302
Calvert, Oklahoma...

434
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,371
what happened
to you there, Rip?

435
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:16,707
And why is it
so important to you?

436
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,877
Because the past
is prologue.

437
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:22,146
It's not uncommon
for criminal posses

438
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:25,182
such as Mr. Stillwater's
to sack and pillage towns

439
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:27,752
which they find uncooperative.

440
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:30,154
So Stillwater's
done this before?

441
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:34,859
In the case of Calvert,
it was Quentin Turnbull's doing.

442
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:36,260
But it was my fault.

443
00:21:36,262 --> 00:21:39,196
I'd come to Calvert on a mission
from the Time Masters.

444
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:43,467
This was years
before my son Jonas was born.

445
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:44,835
Jonas...

446
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:47,638
Did you name your son
after Hex?

447
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,106
After my mission
was completed,

448
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:51,342
I felt unable to leave.

449
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:54,812
I'd grown so attached
to this era...

450
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,081
a victim of the same
time drift you experienced

451
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,549
in 1958.

452
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,284
But obviously you left
at some point.

453
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:03,621
Left? I had to
tear myself away

454
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:05,256
from the time period

455
00:22:05,258 --> 00:22:09,293
for fear that I would never see
my then-future wife, Miranda,

456
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:11,162
ever again.

457
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:18,202
Turnbull attacked Calvert
the very next day.

458
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:19,904
So...

459
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:22,006
You can understand
why I must act.

460
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,407
No, Martin, I don't.

461
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:25,309
As I said before,
this is advanced medicine

462
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,610
unsuitable to the period,

463
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:28,412
to say nothing
of what this boy's survival

464
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:30,047
might do to the timeline.

465
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,582
Be that as it may,

466
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:33,751
I refuse to live
with the regret

467
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:36,787
I see on your face right now.

468
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,661
The information Mr. Stein got
from the barkeep paid out.

469
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:45,896
I know where
the Stillwater Gang's holed up.

470
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:48,132
All right.
Let's ride.

471
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:49,834
Up high.

472
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,571
You coming, Rip?

473
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:01,946
That's what I thought.

474
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:21,198
I wonder why she lives alone
all the way out here.

475
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,100
Because...

476
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:25,102
I value my privacy!

477
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:26,337
Wait, wait, wait.

478
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:28,038
Don't you remember me...

479
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,040
From the saloon
back in Salvation?

480
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:32,643
I remembered you,
you wigged-out little girl.

481
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:33,711
If I'd wanted
to talk to you then,

482
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:35,012
I would have talked
to you then.

483
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:37,047
I ain't fixing
to talk to you now.

484
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,416
Now, get off of my land!

485
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:40,818
Listen, we're not trying
to start any trouble.

486
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,654
Do you want that pretty little
mouth of yours filled with lead?

487
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:46,223
Your friend has
a colorful personality.

488
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:50,795
I ain't got friends.
I keep to myself.

489
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,865
She's right.

490
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:58,402
She wasn't my friend.

491
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:01,305
I was her.

492
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:10,080
We sat for that picture
at the county fair, 1830.

493
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:12,349
He looked
like such a gentleman.

494
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:13,684
What was his name?

495
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:15,085
Hannibal.

496
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:16,654
Hannibal Hawkes.

497
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,122
And what happened?

498
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,224
Was it Savage?

499
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,028
What is this?

500
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,796
It looks familiar.

501
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,699
That was ours
in our first life.

502
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:35,072
I remember.

503
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:36,874
We crossed with Savage
in Jefferson city.

504
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:38,542
He had it with him.

505
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:40,711
We escaped with it
and our lives.

506
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:42,279
Do you still have it?

507
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:44,415
We lost it to bandits
about a year later.

508
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:47,051
We heard that the Pinkertons
were after the same bandits,

509
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:48,452
but we just...

510
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:51,655
Hey.
What is it?

511
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,757
Objects present
at the moment of my...

512
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,593
our first death

513
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:57,828
can be used to kill Savage.

514
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,463
So, if I can get my hands
on that bracelet, then...

515
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:02,766
you're going to try
to kill Savage with a bracelet?

516
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,803
You need to stop.

517
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:08,906
- Stop what?
- Fighting our destiny.

518
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:10,674
Ain't destiny
what brought you here?

519
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,244
What part of destiny
is she fighting?

520
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:14,778
All of it.

521
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,081
We get reborn.
We find Hannibal... Carter...

522
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,750
then Savage finds us,
and then we die.

523
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:22,052
That's... that's
the way it is.

524
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:24,255
It's the way
it's always gonna be.

525
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:25,556
I don't believe that.

526
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:27,525
Well, I have
a few more years on you.

527
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:29,026
You can't break the cycle.

528
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,995
That's why I live
out here, alone.

529
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:34,331
For the rest of your life?

530
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:37,434
Well, I guess I had
to figure that out the hard way.

531
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:41,539
I was still a young woman
when Savage left me a widow.

532
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:44,808
Instead of waiting for him
to find me and kill me

533
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,478
so that I could love my Hannibal
in the next life,

534
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,947
I tried to find love
in this one.

535
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:52,416
Talk about a curse.

536
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:54,685
What happened?

537
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:57,288
He was a good man,
but he wasn't a soul mate.

538
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,057
It was like fate was trying
to break us apart.

539
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,960
Eventually,
fate broke both our hearts.

540
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:05,329
So I made a promise
to myself

541
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:08,699
that I wasn't gonna do that
to a person again.

542
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:12,303
I'm...
I'm sorry to hear that.

543
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:15,272
No, I'm who's sorry...

544
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:18,075
To have to be the one
to let you know

545
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:21,211
that you're never going to be
able to love anyone else, ever.

546
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:24,848
How much do you know
about our previous lives?

547
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,284
I reckon not a lot because
you didn't recognize me,

548
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:30,054
so let me tell you
that we did love other men...

549
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:31,855
loved them real and pure,

550
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:34,592
but it never ended well,
not ever.

551
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:37,928
Tragedy or heartbreak...

552
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:41,999
That's how it always ends
if the man's not Carter.

553
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:49,707
We could've used Sara
on this roundup.

554
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:51,208
A lady? You crazy?

555
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,510
Just remember,
we're here to arrest Stillwater,

556
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:54,778
not kill him.

557
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,780
He always this much
of a stick in the mud?

558
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,315
Yes.

559
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:05,522
How?
It's a miracle.

560
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:08,892
Oh, it's... it's not a miracle,
I can assure you.

561
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:10,461
Uh, M-Mrs. Neal...

562
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:11,662
Sarah.

563
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:14,565
Sarah...

564
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:17,301
When the illness is gone,

565
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,837
I need you to promise me
that you'll take what's left

566
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:22,373
of the medicine and burn it,
vials and all.

567
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:23,440
Do you understand?

568
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:25,876
Yes.
Yes, I shall do it.

569
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:31,181
Sarah...

570
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:32,549
I wish you well.

571
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:34,752
Thank you.

572
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:37,421
I really must be going.

573
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,139
Oh, damn.

574
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,647
These boys got some stones.

575
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:35,913
Jeb Stillwater,
you are under arrest.

576
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:37,214
You have the right
to remain silent.

577
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,982
You have the right
to an attorney.

578
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:41,552
There won't be Miranda rights
for another 100 years.

579
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:44,488
Fall back! Fall back!

580
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,131
Jax!

581
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,706
- We got to go!
- Not without Jax!

582
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,875
Well, we got Stillwater.
It means we got leverage.

583
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:06,777
Live to fight another day
or die tonight...

584
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,145
your choice.

585
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:09,012
Hyah!

586
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:18,422
Where is Stillwater?

587
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:19,990
He's knocked out cold
in the med bay.

588
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:21,592
Well, this is
a simple matter.

589
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:23,427
We trade Stillwater for
Jefferson as Mr. Hex suggested.

590
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:24,962
It's not that simple.

591
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:26,230
If we release Stillwater,
we're back to square one

592
00:29:26,232 --> 00:29:27,564
and the town
is still in danger.

593
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:28,999
So is the kid.

594
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:30,634
And we'll figure out a way
to get him back

595
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:32,035
without releasing Stillwater.

596
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:34,605
I got a notion.

597
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:36,774
Set up a quick draw.

598
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:38,709
You win,

599
00:29:38,711 --> 00:29:40,611
get your guy back.

600
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,012
You lose,

601
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:43,347
you set Stillwater free.

602
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:45,015
And, by "lose," you mean...

603
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:46,884
Get shot and killed.

604
00:29:46,886 --> 00:29:48,152
Oh, great.
Pistols at high noon.

605
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:50,454
Finally,
someone's talking sense.

606
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:52,623
There has to be another way,
a better way.

607
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,358
Sure.

608
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,095
Go after Stillwater with all
your gear from the future.

609
00:29:58,097 --> 00:30:01,165
I don't know how that'll sit
with your Captain, though.

610
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:03,066
Mm, let's assume
it's a bad idea.

611
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:05,602
So who's standing
in the middle of main street?

612
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:06,970
I'll do it.

613
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,438
Raymond, now is not the time

614
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,073
to indulge
your cowboy fantasies.

615
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:12,576
No one else
is stepping forward.

616
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:14,478
Plus, I'm a decent shot...

617
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,313
At least I was
with an air rifle.

618
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,649
I can't believe
you're encouraging this.

619
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:20,184
You know it's the only way.

620
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:21,618
Dr. Palmer's going to get
himself killed.

621
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,587
I think you forfeited
your right to an opinion

622
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:26,023
when you refused to leave
the ship since we've been here.

623
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:27,624
I had good reason.

624
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:28,892
Because of Calvert.

625
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:30,761
Yes, but not in the way
you think.

626
00:30:30,763 --> 00:30:34,231
Leaving Calvert,
leaving this... era

627
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:36,800
is one of the hardest things
I've ever had to do.

628
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:40,704
And why is that, Captain?

629
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:43,974
A Time Master is trained to do
his work without interference,

630
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:46,977
which means not helping people
or being a hero.

631
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:49,880
But as you've seen, Dr. Palmer,
this era offers

632
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:51,715
many opportunities for heroism.

633
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:54,718
I found it...

634
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,420
Enticing.

635
00:30:56,422 --> 00:31:00,123
And you still managed
to leave.

636
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:03,994
Something's been bugging me
all these years.

637
00:31:03,996 --> 00:31:05,495
If you'd have known what
Turnbull was going to do

638
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:08,599
to Calvert,
would you have left?

639
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:14,438
That's the thing, Jonah.

640
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,906
I did know.

641
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:20,043
I deserve that.

642
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,345
You deserve a lot worse.

643
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:22,913
You knew,
and you still left?

644
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:24,982
Of course I knew.
I was a Time Master.

645
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:26,750
And therein lay the problem.

646
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:28,318
Like Raymond, like Martin,

647
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,220
I felt the pull of heroism,
of this era's penchant

648
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,788
for being rife
with opportunities

649
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,190
to make a difference.

650
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:34,958
That's one of the things
that called to me,

651
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,427
and that is why
I had to leave.

652
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:42,432
Because had I stayed...

653
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:45,369
I could no longer
have remained a Time Master.

654
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:53,977
But I'm no longer
a Time Master...

655
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:55,545
Which is why
I'll face Stillwater.

656
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:57,547
Wait. I said
that I would do it.

657
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:59,249
And get yourself shot
and killed?

658
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:02,286
It's appreciated,
but I'd rather you stayed alive.

659
00:32:02,288 --> 00:32:05,822
Send word to
Stillwater's posse.

660
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:08,759
I believe high noon is
in less than three hours.

661
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:20,504
You want to talk about it?

662
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:22,205
Not really.

663
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,111
You don't have to listen
to her, you know?

664
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:30,714
Is this you
not talking about it?

665
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:33,450
No. This is me
ignoring you

666
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:37,087
saying you don't want
to talk about it.

667
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:39,356
Look, I get it.

668
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:42,960
Things may have gone
very wrong for old west you

669
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:45,996
and whoever she loved
who wasn't Carter.

670
00:32:45,998 --> 00:32:47,297
But?

671
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:51,101
But old west you
didn't know Ray Palmer.

672
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:54,037
She didn't love Ray Palmer.

673
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,872
You do.

674
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:58,742
And you have
to live your life.

675
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:01,545
She already lived hers.

676
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,589
You think Hunter
can pull this off?

677
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:14,257
Reasonably.

678
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:18,729
If not, I got dibs on that
newfangled revolver of his.

679
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:33,610
You sure about this?

680
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:36,480
Well, if anything, it feels
good to be out here again,

681
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:38,215
in this era.

682
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:40,917
Well, don't get
too attached.

683
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:44,254
That is what
I keep telling myself.

684
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:46,957
I'll be drawing
for Sheriff Palmer.

685
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:50,327
How do me and my boys know
you're going to keep your word?

686
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:52,729
Sheriff Palmer's
a straight shooter.

687
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:56,833
Then he should be
the one in the street.

688
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,657
Jefferson,
are you all right?

689
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:54,624
Yeah.

690
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:56,526
Did you just shoot
somebody for me?

691
00:34:56,528 --> 00:35:01,064
Yeah.
You're welcome.

692
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:03,333
I don't think
we're done here yet.

693
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:07,871
Oh, no.

694
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,379
They found us.

695
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:28,992
Ah, friends!
Welcome.

696
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:30,961
I think you'll find this
slightly more effective

697
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:32,796
than your current sidearm.

698
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,164
Yes, I will be wanting
that back, by the way.

699
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:35,699
And you'll be needing this.

700
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:38,535
What about revealing
our future tech to the locals?

701
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:41,204
It doesn't seem
to bother them. Shall we?

702
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:55,352
What about our guns?

703
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:57,954
Sorry.
Grabbed what I could.

704
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,403
That's what's up!

705
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:14,971
Y'all better stay the hell
away from us!

706
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:17,674
Calm down, Jefferson.

707
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,881
- Traitor!
- Not possible.

708
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:27,784
I was never on your side.
I was on my side.

709
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:47,404
- You'll never win!
- Wake up, pal. We already did.

710
00:36:57,081 --> 00:37:01,618
Fool. The Time Masters
have initiated omega protocol.

711
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,587
The pilgrim's coming
for you, Chronos.

712
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:07,824
Your deaths are
just a matter of time.

713
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,494
Yeah, yeah.

714
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,399
Well, that was easy.

715
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:27,711
- You're not staying.
- Are you?

716
00:37:27,713 --> 00:37:29,913
Me?
You know I can't.

717
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:32,949
But this town still
needs a sheriff.

718
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:36,886
Well, I'm not
the law-and-order type...

719
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:40,056
Nor the staying-in-one-place
type either.

720
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:44,761
Well, we have that much
in common at least.

721
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,496
At least.

722
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:51,101
Be well, Jonah.

723
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:53,336
Nice thing
about my world...

724
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:56,506
for you,
it ain't going anywhere.

725
00:37:56,508 --> 00:38:00,377
Ah, perhaps we will see
each other again, my friend.

726
00:38:00,379 --> 00:38:02,145
Yeah.

727
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:03,880
I reckon that'd be okay.

728
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,026
Interesting fella.

729
00:38:16,028 --> 00:38:17,427
Indeed.

730
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:20,030
This town's seen
a lot of interesting.

731
00:38:20,032 --> 00:38:21,831
Suppose you got
one of those doohickies

732
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:26,002
that erases people's memories
or something?

733
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:27,971
No. But...

734
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:30,840
Skepticism and disbelief
are a far more effective tool.

735
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:35,512
Ah. So, if anybody here talks,
no one will believe them.

736
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:38,248
Would you, Mr. Snart?

737
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:43,553
I'm not going to pretend
to understand what I saw.

738
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:47,424
I'd prefer that you didn't
tell anyone about it either.

739
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:50,794
That goes for you too,
young master Neal.

740
00:38:50,796 --> 00:38:53,730
- My last name's Wells.
- Excuse me?

741
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:56,066
His father's surname.

742
00:38:56,068 --> 00:38:59,903
Herbert George Wells.

743
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:02,772
You're H.G. Wells.

744
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:06,142
H.G...
I like that.

745
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:08,345
Astonishing.

746
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:12,115
God, it feels so good to be
in normal clothes again.

747
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:15,452
The people here need to invent
fabric softener asap.

748
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:17,354
Is that all?

749
00:39:17,356 --> 00:39:18,922
It's just that
you've seemed a little off

750
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:21,291
ever since you came back
from your walkabout.

751
00:39:21,293 --> 00:39:22,859
Ray, I told you...

752
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:26,796
Something, but I don't
think it's the whole truth.

753
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:30,200
I thought that we decided to be
honest with each other.

754
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:32,469
And I am.

755
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:35,505
I am being honest
with you, Ray.

756
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:40,243
Look, I met a woman,
and I learned some things.

757
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:43,980
I told you
about killing Savage.

758
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:46,549
And the rest...

759
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:51,388
The rest is what she thought,
not what I think.

760
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,623
I don't have to
listen to her.

761
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:05,668
I love you.

762
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:08,104
I love you too.

763
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:10,407
I think they're waiting for us
on the bridge.

764
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:12,675
We should go.

765
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,780
So how are you feeling,
given your concerns

766
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:19,182
about becoming addicted
to this era once again?

767
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:21,117
The last time
I left, Martin,

768
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,587
I did it to be
with those closest to me.

769
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,289
I'm doing the same again.

770
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:27,924
So where to now?

771
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,760
Or, more
specifically, when?

772
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:33,229
Is there another fragmentation
we can hide out in?

773
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:37,033
Unfortunately, matters are
not quite so simple.

774
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,802
How'd I know you were gonna
say something like that?

775
00:40:38,804 --> 00:40:41,905
- Rip's buddies.
- And yours.

776
00:40:41,907 --> 00:40:45,375
The Time Masters have issued
omega protocols on all of us.

777
00:40:45,377 --> 00:40:47,710
That sounds
pretty terrible.

778
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:51,314
The worst kind of order
they can issue...

779
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:53,483
They've sent the pilgrim
after us.

780
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:54,517
Who's the pilgrim?

781
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:55,919
The pilgrim is

782
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:57,520
the Time Masters'
most deadly assassin,

783
00:40:57,522 --> 00:40:58,855
and she will stop at nothing

784
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:00,523
until each and
every one of you are dead.

785
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:02,792
Ooh, scary.

786
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,662
Pretty sure
we can handle ourselves.

787
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:08,064
Indeed...

788
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:09,632
Which is why
she won't be going after

789
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:12,068
the present-day versions
of you.

790
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,306
She's hunting
our younger selves.

791
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:20,910
<i>And she won't stop until each
and every one of us</i>

792
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:23,513
<i>has been erased
from the timeline.</i>

793
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:55,311
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
