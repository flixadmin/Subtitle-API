00:39:59,638 --> 00:40:01,071
Interesting.

978
00:40:01,074 --> 00:40:03,760
- [GASPS]
- Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

979
00:40:03,763 --> 00:40:04,929
I didn't mean to drop that.

980
00:40:04,932 --> 00:40:06,948
- It just slipped out of my hands.
- That's okay.

981
00:40:06,951 --> 00:40:08,860
Oh, gosh, my first... [LAUGHS]

982
00:40:08,862 --> 00:40:10,928
Killer Frost, and I go and ruin it.

983
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,161
- Typical... typical me.
- That's not....

984
00:40:12,163 --> 00:40:13,496
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

985
00:40:13,499 --> 00:40:15,541
I just get so clumsy when I'm nervous.

986
00:40:15,544 --> 00:40:16,873
What are you nervous about?

987
00:40:16,876 --> 00:40:19,083
Um, I'm... I'm supposed to
be meeting some people here

988
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:20,877
for the first time, and
I've got the jitters,

989
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,181
which... [LAUGHS] Is
what this place is called.

990
00:40:23,184 --> 00:40:24,213
Hey! It is.

991
00:40:24,216 --> 00:40:26,257
- Apt name, don't you think?
- I do.

992
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,944
It's funny, you know, you get nervous,

993
00:40:27,947 --> 00:40:29,280
you get the jitters, you go for coffee,

994
00:40:29,282 --> 00:40:30,596
and the caffeine acts as a stimulant,

995
00:40:30,598 --> 00:40:32,650
which makes you shaky, which
could also be known as...

996
00:40:32,652 --> 00:40:33,985
- The jitters.
- Exactly.

997
00:40:33,987 --> 00:40:36,621
[LAUGHS] Okay, ri... I get it.

998
00:40:36,623 --> 00:40:38,856
Okay.

999
00:40:38,858 --> 00:40:40,258
We're gonna go.

1000
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,166
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1001
00:40:42,169 --> 00:40:44,328
Um, I'm really very, very sorry.

1002
00:40:44,337 --> 00:40:46,157
Don't worry about it. Good
luck with your meeting.

1003
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,865
- I hope it goes well.
- Thanks.
