2
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:20,136
The city's called Duke
The state's called New Mexico

3
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:30,524
Among the gangsters
The gringos' fame is inflated

4
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:35,819
'Cause of the new drug they created

5
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:49,965
They say the color is blue
And the quality pure

6
00:00:56,139 --> 00:01:00,137
This potent drug's runnin'
Through the city

7
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:05,474
And no one could stop it
If they wanted to

8
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:14,147
The cartel's runnin' hot because
They weren't getting respect

9
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:21,160
Talkin' 'bout some "Heisenberg"
Who owns the market now

10
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:27,920
No one knows the man since
They've never seen his face

11
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,165
The cartel's 'bout respect
And they ain't forgiving

12
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:39,927
But that homey's dead
He just doesn't know it yet

13
00:01:55,574 --> 00:02:02,158
Heisenberg's fame has got
Down to Michoacan

14
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,872
From way far away
They want to taste that meth

15
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:14,713
That blue stuff has crossed the border

16
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,343
Now New Mexico's livin' up to its name

17
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:37,900
Looks just like Mexico
In all the drugs it's hiding

18
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:44,286
Except there's a gringo boss
And he's known as "Heisenberg"

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,421
The cartel's runnin' hot because
They weren't getting respect

20
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:59,342
Talkin' 'bout some "Heisenberg"
Who owns the market now

21
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,978
No one knows the man since
They've never seen his face

22
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:11,347
The fury of the cartel
Ain't no one escaped it yet

23
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,773
But that homey's dead

24
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:19,273
He just doesn't know it yet

25
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,842
Nitrogen bonds to oxygen,
which in turn...

26
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,813
You do know what a bond is?

27
00:03:56,904 --> 00:04:00,237
A strong force of attraction.

28
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,615
Covalent bonds, ionic bonds.

29
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:08,204
The coming together of atoms
and molecules to form compounds.

30
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,874
No?

31
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:16,089
Chemical bonds
are what make matter matter.

32
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:20,378
Bonds are what hold
the physical world together.

33
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:24,841
- What hold us together.
- Yeah. Yeah. No, I got it.

34
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,053
Bonds.

35
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,890
Your test score says otherwise.
It tells me you don't get it at all.

36
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,309
Yeah, but, I mean, 58. I was close.

37
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,904
What is "close"?

38
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,074
There's no "close" in science, Barry.

39
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,203
There are right answers
and wrong answers.

40
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,655
"Close" didn't put men on the moon.

41
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,908
Yeah, but I'm just saying, Mr. White,
two points?

42
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,083
Look, if I don't pass chemistry,
I have to go to summer school.

43
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:04,923
And, I mean, I really studied.
Like, really, really studied.

44
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,926
Like, all night, hard.

45
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,435
And, I mean, I'm so into chemistry
for, like, the concepts.

46
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:18,482
I just think I might have, you know,
the attention deficit...

47
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:21,066
Couldn't you please
just let this slide?

48
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:33,280
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

49
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:39,915
The answer is no.
Next time, apply yourself.

50
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,510
Yo. If I know you, leave a message.

51
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,299
Are you ducking me, or what?
This makes the third time.

52
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:36,855
Look, I will be leaving this phone on
for another 15 minutes, so call me.

53
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:41,975
Oh, and by the way,
that thing we talked about, the...

54
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,863
When I said, "Handle it."

55
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:49,200
Well, don't. Just let it go.

56
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,904
All right.

57
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,878
Come on.

58
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:15,100
Jesse, open the door.

59
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,054
I know you're home. Your car is here.
Come on. Hey.

60
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,196
Can I help you?

61
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,860
No. Thank you.

62
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:34,367
Well, I'm the manager, so can we stop
with the pounding, please?

63
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,914
You're the manager?

64
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,579
Yes. Yes, you can help me.
Absolutely.

65
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:44,663
I very much need to get inside here,
so if you have a master key...

66
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:48,547
- You have a key, right?
- Yeah, I have a key.

67
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,050
Look, the person who lives here...

68
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,183
...it's just very important
for me to see him.

69
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:00,265
- And you knocked, right?
- Yeah.

70
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,473
He didn't answer?

71
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,025
Which means...?

72
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:12,700
- Look, I'm his father, all right?
- You're Mr. Jackson?

73
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:17,446
Yes. That's me. Walt Jackson.

74
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,660
And you are...?

75
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,241
- Jane.
- Jane. Very nice to meet you, Jane.

76
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,418
Now, if you wouldn't mind...

77
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,465
Mr. Jackson,
I'm happy to let you use my phone.

78
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,628
- Wanna call him?
- No.

79
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,505
No. I...

80
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:37,173
As I said, I would like
if you let me inside here...

81
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:40,844
...so that I can check on
my son's well-being.

82
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:42,640
You understand?

83
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,976
Look, whatever's going on
between the two of you is family.

84
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,984
I don't get involved in family.

85
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,484
Jesse doesn't want you in,
you're not getting in.

86
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:51,693
Period.

87
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:53,615
Sorry.

88
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:01,872
Come on in, Dad.

89
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,288
- Thanks.
- You okay?

90
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,300
Yeah.

91
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,098
"Jesse Jackson"?

92
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,054
Do you even...?

93
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:27,065
Oh, I see you have a telephone,
at least.

94
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:30,609
You know, that blinking thing
I've been calling you on?

95
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,944
Whatever, man.

96
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:38,571
- Hey, give me my... Give...
- I will break this. I will break this!

97
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,321
Damned druggie idiot.
Is this what you've been doing...

98
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,699
...the whole time
I've been trying to reach you?

99
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,702
- No. I've been taking care of business.
- What business?

100
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,418
What business?

101
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:55,294
The business you put me on, asshole.
What, you already forgot?

102
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,058
This business.

103
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:10,395
Does that jog your memory?
Son of a bitch.

104
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,574
- You didn't actually...?
- Hey, you said...

105
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,026
You said, "Handle it,"
so, you know, I handled it.

106
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,199
When I said, "Handle it,"
I meant fear and intimidation.

107
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,372
I meant get your money back.
I never meant...

108
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,660
- Oh, didn't mean to kill somebody?
- No!

109
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:30,832
Well, too late, yo,
because dude's dead.

110
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,921
- Oh, God.
- All right? Way dead.

111
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:37,261
- Oh, God.
- Oh, and, hey, hey, hey. Here.

112
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,380
Here's your money.

113
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:45,385
Yeah, 4660 bucks. Your half.

114
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:51,104
Spend it in good health,
you miserable son of a bitch.

115
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:22,805
I didn't say I killed him.

116
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,644
Tell me what happened.

117
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,478
Dude's wife crushed his head
with an ATM machine.

118
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,977
- Crushed his...?
- Crushed his head...

119
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,233
...with an ATM machine
right in front of me.

120
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,489
I mean, crushed it like...

121
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:46,153
Oh, my God, the sound...

122
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,116
...it's still in my ears.

123
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,038
You know, and the blood,
like, everywhere.

124
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:56,496
Like, there was so much,
you would not believe.

125
00:11:56,717 --> 00:12:01,675
Man, will you just please give me...?
Just give me my weed, all right?

126
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,344
It helps with my nausea.

127
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:07,929
So...

128
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:11,177
...you did not kill anyone?

129
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:15,019
Does anybody think
that you killed anybody?

130
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,062
I called the cops.

131
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,521
You called the cops?

132
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,239
Yeah. You know, I called,
and I split, you know?

133
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,528
And then they came in
and busted her.

134
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:30,196
God, she was...
She was so zapped out of her mind.

135
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,786
You know? It's...
She did it for, like, nothing.

136
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:37,503
I mean, he told her she was a skank,
but, yo, I mean, she was a skank.

137
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:43,055
Can this person identify you?
Can she identify you being there?

138
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:47,971
She couldn't identify
her left ass cheek.

139
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,474
She was so zonked.

140
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,055
And she had this...

141
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,352
God, she had this kid.

142
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,981
Listen, I'm a little fuzzy
on the mechanics here...

143
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:05,155
...but could you not stop this woman
from killing this man?

144
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,163
Look, she had a gun on me,
all right?

145
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:18,542
Yeah, my gun, okay? Mine.

146
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:20,584
Go ahead, say it. Say it.

147
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:24,799
No, I ain't no Tuco or Krazy-8.
I can't run a crew.

148
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:28,714
Come on. Come on. Point made, man.
Point made. Yes.

149
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:38,231
Yo. If I know you, leave a message.

150
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:41,444
- Hey, it's Badger, man.
- What are you doing?

151
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:45,439
- Don't use your real name.
- What? That isn't my real name.

152
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,691
Okay.

153
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:53,239
Yo, we got those pants you wanted.
Thirty-two large, right?

154
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,949
We got them just for you, jefe.

155
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,625
Let's do some business, yo.

156
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:09,140
So are you gonna
get back up on that horse?

157
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,470
No.

158
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:16,605
You get on. All right?

159
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,769
I just want to forget. I just...

160
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:30,614
Sorry.

161
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:44,707
Hey.

162
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:47,133
Hey, what's up with that?

163
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,844
Jesus Malverde,
patron saint of Mexican drug dealers.

164
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,680
Well, yeah, hell,
I know who it is, okay?

165
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:57,468
Scumbags kneeling down
praying to him:

166
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:02,850
"Please, Señor Saint.
No DEA, please."

167
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:14,079
I'm just... I'm just saying,
why's he on your desk?

168
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,994
Going after neo-Nazis,
you don't wear swastikas, right?

169
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:23,625
- Sun Tzu.
- Son who?

170
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:26,628
Sixth-century Chinese general.
Wrote The Art of War.

171
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,551
"If you know your enemy
as yourself...

172
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,301
...you'll fight without danger
in many battles."

173
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,727
Right on.

174
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:45,896
- Agent Schrader.
- Sir.

175
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,282
- Glad to have you on board.
- Thanks.

176
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:54,360
- Everybody getting you settled in?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Great group of guys.

177
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,913
And gals. And gals.
Guys... Guys and gals.

178
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,830
Good. You couldn't have
picked a better time to arrive.

179
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,714
We're about to put a big dent
in the cartel. Right, Vanco?

180
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,547
Yes, sir.

181
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:37,320
Yo, bro, check it out.
It's a satellite picture of you farting.

182
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:41,285
"Fat Man and Little Boy."
Sounds like you two.

183
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:45,120
I got your fat man in my pants, bitch.

184
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:52,462
- Hey, watch it.
- It ain't real, dumb-ass.

185
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,794
Just watch it, is all.

186
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,805
You watch it.

187
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,651
I'm Heisenberg.

188
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,314
You're Heisenberg?

189
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:12,570
Yeah, I remember you.
You were the cook.

190
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:15,069
Let's get this over with.

191
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:16,910
Where's Jesse?

192
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:20,236
- Busy.
- Hey, that's cool.

193
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:21,868
Real cool.

194
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,626
Totally cool.

195
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:25,294
Hey, hey...

196
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:30,047
It's all there, man. Every dollar.
Case you wanna, like, count it.

197
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:33,425
- Here?
- I'm just saying...

198
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:35,464
Just saying, like, we cool, yo.

199
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:37,804
Ain't got no confusions
and interpretations...

200
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,297
...as to who we work for.

201
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:42,721
And that's church, yo. For real.

202
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:49,484
What have you heard?

203
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:54,401
Did Jesse really...?

204
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:58,072
I mean, did he really...

205
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:03,112
...squash that dude's head
with an ATM machine?

206
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,662
Word.

207
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,168
Who's saying that?

208
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:15,428
Damn, man, it's all over town.
Everybody's like, "Whoa, snap."

209
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:18,307
Usually I gotta chase dudes down
for their money...

210
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,259
...but today everybody's paying up.

211
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:23,393
True that. Serious.

212
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,477
But, like...

213
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,351
He really did it?

214
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:40,651
You didn't hear that from me.

215
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,645
Big lunch.

216
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,079
Thank you.

217
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,161
- Here you go.
- Very good, Ms. White.

218
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,085
We'll consider your application
and let you know.

219
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:35,580
Thank you.

220
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:38,837
I'd just like to mention
that I have worked here before.

221
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:40,169
Really?

222
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:42,262
When are you due?

223
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:47,472
- Several months.
- Congratulations.

224
00:19:47,813 --> 00:19:52,439
I see. Accounting Department.
You left us four years ago?

225
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:54,064
Family.

226
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:58,277
We'll definitely let you know.
Thank you for coming by.

227
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:07,949
Actually, may I see Ted Beneke?
I... I think he'll remember me.

228
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,954
Mr. Beneke's very busy today,
unfortunately.

229
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,458
You know, if it's okay, I'll just...

230
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:17,133
Ma'am...

231
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:33,934
Skyler. Oh, my God, look at you.

232
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:35,645
Hey, Ted.

233
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,150
- Come in, come in.
- Okay.

234
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:40,985
No calls, Margaret, thanks.

235
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,694
Come on, sit down right here.

236
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,151
Okay. Thank you.

237
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:51,998
- You look great.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

238
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,459
Boy or girl?
Or are you keeping it a secret?

239
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,997
Oh, it's a little girl.
We're very excited.

240
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:59,967
I'll bet. One of each.

241
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,428
How's Walt Jr.?

242
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:06,256
Oh, 10th grade,
and he's just growing like a weed.

243
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:08,017
He's... He's taller than I am now.

244
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:14,054
Yeah. I'm betting 6'3 ", 6'4"
by the time he's finished.

245
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,812
And, wow, handsome. Oh, my God.

246
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:18,607
Good genes.

247
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:26,488
Speaking of movie stars,
those can't be the twins.

248
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:28,862
Oh, yeah. Yep. That's them.

249
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:31,204
- They're gorgeous.
- Yes, they are.

250
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,039
And they know it.

251
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:36,044
I'm in real trouble there, huh?

252
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:37,915
Yeah.

253
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:42,259
So the big office, huh?

254
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,177
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

255
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:46,345
Weird, isn't it?

256
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:48,882
I still think of it as my dad's.

257
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:50,429
I miss him.

258
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:52,186
Me too.

259
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:58,223
I'd like to think he'd be proud.
Last year was our best year yet.

260
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:00,567
Yeah, he'd be proud.

261
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:04,282
Walt? How's he doing?

262
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:09,449
Oh, he's... He is doing great.
Yeah. He's plugging away.

263
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:13,079
- Great. He's still teaching?
- Yeah.

264
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:18,084
- You tell him I said hello.
- I will definitely do that.

265
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:27,217
To be honest, Ted,
I didn't just stop by to say hello. I...

266
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,725
I was applying for the data-entry job.

267
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:34,770
You're kidding.

268
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,269
Skyler, you were, like,
our go-to bookkeeper.

269
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:39,938
Yeah. Well...

270
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:42,607
...the economy, you know, so...

271
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:46,356
Well, you, data entry?
That'd be a mistake.

272
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:52,078
How about...

273
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,076
...get your old job back?

274
00:22:57,336 --> 00:23:01,120
We're expanding, and, well,
between you and me...

275
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,628
...the whole department's
pretty much of a mess.

276
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:06,542
Your work would be cut out for you...

277
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:09,470
...but we could use your help.

278
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:16,973
Okay.

279
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:22,981
All right. Now, this is our territory,
right? Currently.

280
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:24,475
Hey. Hello.

281
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:27,022
- Yeah, man. Current. Whatever.
- Now, look at this.

282
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:29,150
Here, here, here and here.

283
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:32,451
What does that look like to you?

284
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:37,081
Opportunities. Golden ones.
That's what that looks like.

285
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:40,878
No, look.
Look, it's an entire city full of buyers.

286
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:42,831
Now, why aren't we exploiting that?

287
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:46,499
- Because it's not our territory?
- Because we lack initiative.

288
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:47,999
- Initiative.
- Yes.

289
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,177
You need to employ more dealers.

290
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:52,714
Double, triple your crew.
Those three I met?

291
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:57,180
They should each have three, six, nine
sub-dealers working for them.

292
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:59,435
Exponential growth,
that's the key here.

293
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:05,402
It's not our territory, man.
Yo, you follow me here, huh?

294
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:08,282
We go rolling into
these neighborhoods...

295
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,325
...other crews ain't gonna take kindly,
you understand?

296
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:14,199
Sure, they won't like it...

297
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:17,283
...but I say they're not gonna
do a thing about it.

298
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,456
- No. Listen, Jesse...
- No.

299
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:21,293
Jesse.

300
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:28,507
The game has changed.
The word is out that you are a killer.

301
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:32,511
- What are you talking about?
- Apparently, it's all over town.

302
00:24:32,723 --> 00:24:35,214
Somebody crossed you,
you got angry...

303
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:38,518
...you crushed their skull
with an ATM machine.

304
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:40,721
- That's not how it happened.
- Who cares...

305
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:44,225
...as long as it's our competitors
who believe it and not the police?

306
00:24:44,443 --> 00:24:47,728
- Oh, my...
- No, don't you see how great this is?

307
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:52,021
Look, you... You are a...

308
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:57,030
Jesse, look at me.

309
00:24:57,706 --> 00:25:00,826
You are a blowfish.

310
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:03,249
- What?
- A blowfish. Think about it.

311
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:07,590
Small in stature,
not swift, not cunning.

312
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,080
Easy prey for predators...

313
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:11,590
...but the blowfish
has a secret weapon...

314
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:14,129
...doesn't he? Doesn't he?

315
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:18,262
What does the blowfish do, Jesse?
What does the blowfish do?

316
00:25:21,063 --> 00:25:23,102
- I don't even know...
- The blowfish puffs up.

317
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:27,147
The blowfish puffs himself up
four, five times larger than normal.

318
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:29,934
And why? Why does he do that?

319
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:32,824
So that it makes him intimidating,
that's why.

320
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,029
Intimidating.

321
00:25:34,243 --> 00:25:37,446
So that the other scarier fish
are scared off.

322
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:40,414
And that's you. You are a blowfish.

323
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:43,578
You see, it's just all an illusion.

324
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:46,795
You see, it's nothing but air.

325
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,799
Now...

326
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:53,134
...who messes with the blowfish,
Jesse?

327
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:56,759
- Nobody.
- You're damn right.

328
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:01,017
- I'm a blowfish.
- You are a blowfish.

329
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:02,722
- Say it again.
- I'm a blowfish.

330
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:04,812
- Say it like you mean it.
- I'm a blowfish.

331
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:07,894
- You're a blowfish. That's right.
- Yeah!

332
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,980
Blowfishing this up.

333
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:50,014
Hello?

334
00:26:50,235 --> 00:26:53,153
The SkyMall.
Give me the SkyMall, would you?

335
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:00,321
Vanco...

336
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:04,072
...new guy don't speak Spanish.
What's up?

337
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:08,951
Hey, white boy,
better learn Español, huh?

338
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:12,456
This ain't Branson, Missouri,
know what I'm talking about?

339
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:16,176
You know what? I'll teach you.

340
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:23,223
It means, "Let's make a deal."

341
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:25,724
So go ahead. We're waiting.

342
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:29,017
Okay.

343
00:27:31,193 --> 00:27:32,568
Right here.

344
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:35,483
"Item SS4G:

345
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:40,240
Yankee Stadium final season
commemorative baseball...

346
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:42,243
...hand-signed by Derek Jeter."

347
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:45,028
Vanco, write this down.

348
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:47,618
Oh, man, watch out.

349
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:53,085
"66100ZBG: large-size floor runner."

350
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:56,502
Look at that, huh?
It's a rug you put on the floor...

351
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:59,589
...except for it looks like
a hundred-dollar bill.

352
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:04,052
I love them. Get me 20 of them.
I'm gonna put them all over my casa.

353
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:05,430
We'll get you three.

354
00:28:05,644 --> 00:28:07,684
- No, you give me 10.
- Five.

355
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:13,059
Hey. How about you stop
jerking us off here?

356
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:20,407
Where's the meet?
When's it going down?

357
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:24,111
White boy don't like
let's make a deal, huh?

358
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:27,116
White boy's gonna kick your ass,
you don't stop wasting time.

359
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:28,364
Schrader...

360
00:28:28,584 --> 00:28:35,037
Hey, white boy. My name's Tortuga.
You know what that means?

361
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:39,718
Well, if I had to guess,
I'd say that's Spanish for "asshole."

362
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:44,507
Tortuga means "turtle." That's me.

363
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:51,641
I take my time, but I always win.

364
00:28:55,194 --> 00:28:56,901
Oh, wait. That reminds me.

365
00:28:57,112 --> 00:28:59,603
I seen this earlier. Lookit.

366
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:03,735
This is awesome, homes.
Right there, look at that.

367
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:07,037
"The tranquil tortoise
garden sculpture."

368
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:08,907
Definitely two of those, huh?

369
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:12,661
Check it out, huh? Good likeness.

370
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:16,537
Hank's doing great down there.
He's making inroads.

371
00:29:16,757 --> 00:29:19,295
I'm sure he is. He's a hero, after all.

372
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,594
So you gonna go down to El Paso?

373
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:25,260
Please. It's Third World enough
around here.

374
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:27,051
They keep him busy every second.

375
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:29,260
He's already got some
big operation going.

376
00:29:29,478 --> 00:29:31,850
Some hush-hush deal
he couldn't tell me about...

377
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:34,389
...except it's on the other side
of the border.

378
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:36,186
Wow, that sounds exciting.

379
00:29:36,944 --> 00:29:38,936
He's being safe, right?

380
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:41,230
Yeah.
He says he's mostly riding a desk.

381
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:44,449
Which, between you and me,
is just the way I want it.

382
00:29:45,202 --> 00:29:48,037
Speaking of riding desks...

383
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:50,199
...got myself a job today.

384
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:53,038
You did not.

385
00:29:55,796 --> 00:29:58,334
As big as you are?

386
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:04,053
- Thank you.
- You know I just mean...

387
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:05,887
Where? With who?

388
00:30:06,098 --> 00:30:09,798
Well, someone willing
to work around that, apparently.

389
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:11,014
Beneke.

390
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:14,893
You did not.
Is Mr. Grabby-Hands still there?

391
00:30:15,107 --> 00:30:17,230
Marie, that was one time
at a Christmas party.

392
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:22,401
And he was so drunk,
he was practically slurring his words.

393
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:25,948
- Just what you want in an executive.
- And he apologized profusely.

394
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,742
Plus he's married with a family.
I'm sure he doesn't wanna get sued.

395
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:32,660
It will not happen again.

396
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:37,207
Is money that tight?

397
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,751
Yeah.

398
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,968
You know we can always help out.

399
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:47,636
No, Marie.

400
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:49,515
You know Walt. He would just...

401
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:56,351
- Speak of the devil.
- Hey. Hi, Marie.

402
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:58,273
How are you? What's up?

403
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:01,228
Nothing much.
How's things with you?

404
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:03,112
- Good. Good.
- Hi, honey.

405
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:05,943
- Dinner will be about an hour and...
- Oh, thanks, sweetie.

406
00:31:06,158 --> 00:31:09,823
- Everything okay?
- Everything's perfect.

407
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:35,805
This is Raisin Bran,
not Raisin Bran Crunch.

408
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:38,014
So? Same thing.

409
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:39,774
Not the same thing.

410
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:42,770
I'll tell you what, why don't you
do the grocery shopping?

411
00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:47,234
And then you can get
whatever you want. Great.

412
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:52,526
It's... It's not that hard, Mom.
It says "crunch" on the box.

413
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:53,944
You're pushing it.

414
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:56,916
- Morning.
- Morning, honey.

415
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,165
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

416
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:02,462
Dad, notice anything?

417
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:06,132
Is there a funeral today?

418
00:32:06,343 --> 00:32:07,339
- A funeral?
- Well...

419
00:32:07,553 --> 00:32:09,676
- Oh, Christ, do I look that bad?
- No, no, no.

420
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:11,964
Mom got a job.

421
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:13,593
A job? Why?

422
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:16,347
Well, do I need to get out
the checkbook and show you?

423
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:19,681
No, I... Do you think it's a good idea
in your condition?

424
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:22,603
No, no. The doctor said I can work
up until I go into labor.

425
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:26,187
And it's just an office job.
I'm just sitting on my butt.

426
00:32:27,865 --> 00:32:29,063
Where?

427
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:31,486
Beneke.

428
00:32:31,702 --> 00:32:34,275
I'm back working
in the Accounting Department.

429
00:32:34,496 --> 00:32:38,161
Skyler, what about the welding fumes?
Isn't that why you had to quit...

430
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:41,376
- ...in the first place?
- They've gone green since then.

431
00:32:41,587 --> 00:32:45,252
They have some kind of
green welding or something.

432
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:48,217
I didn't smell anything
when I was in there.

433
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:52,303
Didn't Mr. Beneke pass away?

434
00:32:52,514 --> 00:32:53,629
Yeah.

435
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:54,880
Who's running things?

436
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,342
Ted. The son.

437
00:32:59,438 --> 00:33:02,889
Anyway, I have got to go.

438
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:06,691
I don't wanna be late
my first day back.

439
00:33:06,904 --> 00:33:08,647
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

440
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,655
- Bye.
- Bye.

441
00:33:10,866 --> 00:33:12,277
Okay.

442
00:33:13,202 --> 00:33:15,871
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

443
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:20,245
Bye.

444
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:33,631
Hey.

445
00:33:35,224 --> 00:33:37,216
You left your cave.

446
00:33:37,726 --> 00:33:39,434
Yeah.

447
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:42,266
I was... I'm missing my TV.

448
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:43,856
Thinking maybe I'd hit Costco.

449
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:46,604
You know,
snag a big-ass wide-screen.

450
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:49,070
So...

451
00:33:49,488 --> 00:33:50,982
Yeah.

452
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,317
What you drawing?

453
00:33:56,245 --> 00:33:57,240
Damn.

454
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:58,829
That's good.

455
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,699
Make a hell of a tat.

456
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:02,031
That's the plan.

457
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:03,413
Really?

458
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:06,462
I work part-time, down at ABQ Ink.

459
00:34:06,672 --> 00:34:07,751
Right on.

460
00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:12,464
Yo, you're a real good drawer.

461
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:15,259
I used to do a little of that.

462
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:19,844
You used to be a drawer too, huh?

463
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:24,473
What stopped you?

464
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:29,810
You know, just...

465
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:31,938
So tell me something.

466
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:36,533
What kind of tattoo artist
has no tattoos?

467
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:40,654
That's way too big a commitment.

468
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:53,084
Hey, man. You're Pinkman.

469
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:57,671
You're the man!
Everybody's been talking about you.

470
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,348
Yeah.

471
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,925
Right on, man. Keep it real.

472
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:10,564
"Pinkman," huh?

473
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:12,188
Yeah.

474
00:35:12,487 --> 00:35:14,646
I thought your name was "Jackson."

475
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,050
Well, your snitch
is really earning his nickname.

476
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:34,498
Are we...?

477
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:36,212
Are we just on mañana time?

478
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:37,757
They'll show.

479
00:35:37,971 --> 00:35:40,723
Yeah? Why is that?

480
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:43,845
You got more catalogs
for him to clean out?

481
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:47,728
Maybe a little Sharper Image
or Pottery Barn?

482
00:35:51,652 --> 00:35:53,644
What the hell are they thinking?

483
00:35:53,862 --> 00:35:56,353
Sending us some loudmouth
who doesn't speak the language?

484
00:35:56,615 --> 00:35:58,773
Politics, man. Politics.

485
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:05,746
Supposed to be some hotshot hero.
I say it's a bunch of crap.

486
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:11,244
Hero for Albuquerque, maybe.
Maybe it don't take much up there.

487
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:15,213
Hey, something
I need to know about?

488
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:17,798
What? Oh, that? No, man.

489
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:20,965
We were just singing your praises.

490
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:22,462
Glad to have you.

491
00:36:22,683 --> 00:36:24,426
Welcome aboard.

492
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,538
Hey, is that your guy?

493
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:50,372
Hey, I think that's your guy.

494
00:36:51,712 --> 00:36:53,788
What the hell
is he doing down there?

495
00:38:00,822 --> 00:38:02,447
Schrader, where you going?

496
00:38:03,617 --> 00:38:07,365
We need an evidence bag, right?
A pretty big one.

497
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:11,531
What's the matter?
You act like you never saw...

498
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,039
...a severed human head
on a tortoise before.

499
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:28,052
Hey, welcome to...

500
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:55,203
My leg.

501
00:39:14,938 --> 00:39:18,983
...headed by Werner Heisenberg,
were also undertaken during the war.

502
00:39:19,193 --> 00:39:21,600
The game has changed, yo.

503
00:39:22,154 --> 00:39:24,609
This is our city, all right?

504
00:39:24,823 --> 00:39:27,361
All of it. The whole damn place.

505
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:29,615
Our territory.

506
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:31,620
We're staking our claim...

507
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:35,579
...that we sell when we want,
where we want.

508
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:38,544
Now, we're gonna be kings,
understand?

509
00:39:38,754 --> 00:39:40,296
Well, I'm gonna be king.

510
00:39:40,506 --> 00:39:42,961
You guys will be princes
or dukes or something.

511
00:39:43,175 --> 00:39:45,796
- I wanna be a knight.
- But first things first.

512
00:39:46,345 --> 00:39:48,088
We gotta get more dealers.

513
00:39:48,305 --> 00:39:50,796
You know, foot soldiers, right?

514
00:39:51,016 --> 00:39:52,807
Now, they'll be working for you.

515
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:56,102
You're working for me,
and they're working for you.

516
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,390
You follow me?

517
00:39:58,607 --> 00:40:00,398
Layered, like nachos.

518
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:02,317
Exponential growth.

519
00:40:02,528 --> 00:40:06,110
Now, that's success
with a capital S.

520
00:40:06,323 --> 00:40:07,865
Straight up, straight up.

521
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:09,071
For shizzle.

522
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:10,316
Frigging awesome.

523
00:40:22,214 --> 00:40:23,874
Well, we're set.

524
00:40:24,091 --> 00:40:27,590
Our boys are ready.
Gonna be some mad cheddar, yo.

525
00:40:28,554 --> 00:40:29,882
Cheddar, Mr. White.

526
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:34,308
Fat stacks, dead presidents,
cash money.

527
00:40:35,936 --> 00:40:37,596
Gonna own this city.

528
00:40:38,397 --> 00:40:39,855
We're not charging enough.

529
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:42,479
What?

530
00:40:43,277 --> 00:40:45,815
You corner the market,
then raise the price.

531
00:40:46,488 --> 00:40:48,647
Simple economics.

532
00:41:09,178 --> 00:41:11,550
Oh, hey, Ted. Come on in.

533
00:41:11,763 --> 00:41:14,681
- Looks like they got you all set up.
- Yeah. It's perfect.

534
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:17,892
I am close enough to the bathroom
that I don't have to waddle far.

535
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:19,099
And that's very nice.

536
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:21,554
- I figured that might be a deal-breaker.
- Yeah.

537
00:41:23,275 --> 00:41:24,473
Listen, I...

538
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:28,696
I wanted to thank you
for having me back.

539
00:41:29,448 --> 00:41:31,737
You don't have to thank me.
I need you.

540
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:39,076
Wow, Ted, it's a little early
for wine, isn't it?

541
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:40,917
Oh, damn. It's grape juice.

542
00:41:41,126 --> 00:41:43,415
Been making the girls
breakfast in the morning.

543
00:41:43,629 --> 00:41:45,087
Hey, how is Denise doing?

544
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:48,089
We split up, about a year ago.

545
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:51,588
I'm sorry.

546
00:41:52,471 --> 00:41:55,140
She's definitely happier now.
I guess I am too, most days.

547
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:57,922
- Together since high school.
- Yeah.

548
00:41:58,143 --> 00:42:00,100
- I remember that.
- Anyway...

549
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,187
I don't know, people change.

550
00:42:03,482 --> 00:42:04,478
Yes.

551
00:42:04,691 --> 00:42:07,265
Anyway, I just wanted
to welcome you.

552
00:42:07,486 --> 00:42:09,977
Welcome you back. And...

553
00:42:10,197 --> 00:42:12,688
I'll see you around
the vending machines.

554
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,408
Okay.

555
00:42:17,913 --> 00:42:19,491
We should have lunch one day.

556
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:20,951
Like old times.

557
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:23,292
Sure.

558
00:43:55,969 --> 00:43:57,713
Oh, hey.

559
00:43:58,555 --> 00:44:00,263
Hey, yourself.

560
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:07,227
So listen. My...

561
00:44:07,773 --> 00:44:10,478
My name is not really
Jesse Jackson.

562
00:44:13,195 --> 00:44:15,318
It's Jesse Pinkman.

563
00:44:15,531 --> 00:44:18,401
And that guy you met...

564
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:23,321
...he's not my dad.

565
00:44:32,047 --> 00:44:36,045
You're not gonna kick me out,
are you?

566
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:39,095
Because I actually really like it here.

567
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:43,387
I don't make it my business
what you do.

568
00:44:44,226 --> 00:44:46,515
So long as you don't do it here.

569
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:57,060
So, hey, I got this kick-ass
new flat-screen.

570
00:45:00,826 --> 00:45:02,569
Wanna see?

571
00:45:29,855 --> 00:45:32,310
It's got that thing where the blacks...

572
00:45:32,524 --> 00:45:36,652
...are, like, you know,
really, really, really black.

573
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:42,190
And the Dolby six-point-whatever.

574
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:46,537
So it'll really rock the house.

575
00:45:47,497 --> 00:45:49,205
But I'll, you know...

576
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:54,659
I'll keep it way down, of course.

577
00:46:04,723 --> 00:46:07,843
I don't know what the hell
is taking so long.

578
00:46:11,063 --> 00:46:14,017
Come on, come on.
