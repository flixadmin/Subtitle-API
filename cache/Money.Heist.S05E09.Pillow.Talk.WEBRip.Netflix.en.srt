1
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:27,125
The good thing
about really fucked-up situations

2
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,708
is that they can only happen once.

3
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,000
You can only get killed once.

4
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:35,041
You only lose the love of your life once.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,041
You're only robbed of the greatest
treasure anyone has ever stolen once.

6
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:43,958
But the fact
that all these things only happen once

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,666
doesn't make them less painful.

8
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:32,916
You feel devastated.

9
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:35,833
You see the faces
of the people you've disappointed.

10
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:39,666
It's like a cannonball
hurling through your chest.

11
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:43,916
At that point,
when the anxiety won't let you breathe,

12
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,125
you have two options.

13
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:47,375
Accept your defeat

14
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,208
or fight.

15
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,708
And the Professor chose to fight.

16
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:01,000
Although he knew that all was lost,

17
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:02,666
that he was, most likely,

18
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,916
only prolonging his suffering,

19
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,541
he chose to fight.

20
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:09,333
Turn on the GPS.
Find the signal for the trucks.

21
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:11,791
They don't know they're being tracked.

22
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,833
Palermo, Lisbon, private line.

23
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,250
They're 2.5 miles away.
They aren't moving.

24
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,958
At the next crossroads, everyone go west.

25
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,375
Roger that.

26
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,500
Weapons ready, they're 2.5 miles away.

27
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:34,833
Lisbon, do you copy?

28
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,666
Come on, Lisbon, respond.

29
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,333
This is Lisbon.
I'm with Palermo. What is it?

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,916
The gold is gone.

31
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:45,666
What did you say?

32
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,333
They came in pretending to be police
when we had the gold loaded up.

33
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,791
They tied us up and took everything.

34
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,541
-How many were there?
-Ten.

35
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,166
Wait a minute, Sergio.

36
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:59,125
Did they arrive
right when the ingots were in the trucks?

37
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,125
-That's when they went in?
-Yes.

38
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,833
You know what that means, right?

39
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,416
We have a mole.

40
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,000
It's an abandoned quarry.
They're not moving.

41
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:08,583
They're unloading the gold.

42
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,875
They're in the old Santa Bárbara quarry.

43
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,833
For fuck's sake! No!

44
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,458
-God!
-Palermo.

45
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:25,708
You know this bank better than anyone.
Tell me there's another way out.

46
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,750
Without the gold, we're done for.

47
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,166
Then we're done for.

48
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,041
There they are.

49
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:44,958
Go easy.

50
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,458
Darko, we're getting out.

51
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:40,833
Cover the flanks.

52
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,083
We'll check the trucks.

53
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:48,125
The rest of you, cover us.
They could be anywhere.

54
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:52,750
Now.

55
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,416
Cover them.

56
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,666
Guy with the beard, here.
Watch the baby.

57
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,708
Fuck!

58
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,125
No!

59
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,291
The trucks are empty.

60
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,083
They unloaded 90 tons of gold
in half an hour. This…

61
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:20,500
This wasn't improvised.
They knew the plan.

62
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,791
It could only have been one person.

63
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,083
You know exactly who it was.

64
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,250
No. She knew about the target.

65
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:35,416
She didn't know how we'd get the gold out
or any details of the plan.

66
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,416
You put everything in the safe each night.

67
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,875
Your brother was in love.

68
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:43,416
Do you really think strategy
was more important to him than love?

69
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,833
-Seriously?
-Yes.

70
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,041
Considering our lives depend on it, yes!

71
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,041
People talk in bed, Sergio.

72
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,541
And you're no exception.

73
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,375
You told me about the Paris Plan in bed,
because you knew no one could hear it.

74
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,875
You knew you were putting a noose
around your associates' necks

75
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,083
to save me.

76
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:05,458
We both knew
they would come in after that.

77
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,875
And now Tokyo is dead.

78
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,083
That's what people talk about in bed.

79
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,000
About secrets that endanger
other people's lives.

80
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,250
Your brother did it,

81
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,625
you did it,

82
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:21,333
and I did it.

83
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,583
Sergio.

84
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,458
Let's lighten the mood.
Who were you talking about?

85
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,041
About my brother's ex-wife.

86
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,500
Great, and what does she do?

87
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:47,916
She's a pianist.

88
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,000
And a thief!

89
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:03,375
She knew everything!

90
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,875
All this time,
they've been staying here, watching us.

91
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,583
They saw everything.

92
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,416
All they had to do was time us.

93
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:41,250
They knew that, once the trucks went in,

94
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:45,666
it would be eight to ten hours
until they left, that's why…

95
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,083
That's why they got there just in time.

96
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,333
We don't have all day, guys!

97
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:04,375
Let's go, guys!

98
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,666
Come on! Hurry up!

99
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,750
Let's go!

100
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,500
Move!

101
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,875
Let's go! Come on, that's good.

102
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,041
All right, that's good.

103
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,125
-Eight minutes and we're done.
-Let's go!

104
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,333
Come on!

105
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:23,958
Let's go!

106
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
This message is for the whole gang.

107
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,958
Someone stole our gold.

108
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,625
They came into the stormwater tank
pretending to be police.

109
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,000
We're going after them.

110
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,375
We're looking for several dump trucks.

111
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:34,708
They loaded them with the ingots
and covered them in dirt.

112
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:38,125
The cargo is uncovered
to avoid arousing suspicion.

113
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,916
It's crucial that no one knows
the gold's been stolen.

114
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,291
Not the hostages, not the police, no one.

115
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:46,666
Because any setback
would finish us off, got that?

116
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,625
Got it.

117
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:48,708
Copy.

118
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,291
-Helsinki?
-Got it.

119
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,000
-Manila?
-Copy.

120
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,333
Denver? Stockholm?

121
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,250
Denver, Stockholm, do you copy?

122
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,500
Rio, listen to me.

123
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,958
I need you to hack all the traffic cameras

124
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,666
near the Santa Bárbara quarry, okay?

125
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,333
Go to the stormwater tank.
Take miners, the Captain and those trucks.

126
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:14,791
Get rid of the police vans
and start the Tom Thumb Plan.

127
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,458
Got it. Captain, the Polish guy and you,
get in the trucks.

128
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:23,458
And everyone else,
before a crisis unfolds,

129
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:26,916
think about what you want to study
in a maximum-security prison.

130
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,166
I give you my word…

131
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,583
…we'll get the gold back

132
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,166
and get you out.

133
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,250
That was the first time the Professor
said something nobody believed.

134
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,083
-You can't just remove it.
-Yes, you can.

135
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,541
You'll see.

136
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,000
Who did it?

137
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,916
Who is the funny guy,
or girl, who put this hake in my bed?

138
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:13,250
Fine.

139
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,125
You know what?

140
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,708
I resign as the brains of the gang.

141
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,791
I'd rather party. Pass the patxarán.

142
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,416
It's more of an amaretto than patxarán--

143
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,583
I don't give a shit what it is.

144
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,166
Drink up. Drink.

145
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,791
-I'll have a smoke too.
-Good for you.

146
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:44,125
Do you know why you're here?
You're here to let off steam.

147
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:47,250
Because concentrating all day
is difficult, isn't it?

148
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,708
It's exhausting, isn't it?

149
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,208
This party you've organized is a sign.

150
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,583
A sign of weakness.

151
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,541
It shows you don't have what it takes
to be stressed all day.

152
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:01,708
Nairobi's the only responsible one.
You have to be on guard all day.

153
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:05,250
You have to be on guard all day,
clenching your fists, Bogotá.

154
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:10,208
Tokyo. Helsinki.
Your ass has to be as tight as a drum.

155
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,708
That's the way to be.
On the lookout, like an owl.

156
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,208
Stiff, vigilant.

157
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,666
Because as soon as you lower your guard,
they'll get you.

158
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:21,708
Some son of a bitch, some bastard,
will be on guard all day long,

159
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:22,833
and he'll get you.

160
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:24,416
-We'll clean up.
-No!

161
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:32,458
You need to let off steam?
Hey, then let's let off steam.

162
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:33,750
Let's relax then.

163
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,791
Everybody relax. Let's see.

164
00:14:58,416 --> 00:14:59,833
No class tomorrow.

165
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,125
You can share notes.

166
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,541
Come on, let's all dance!

167
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,291
-Come on.
-Let's do it.

168
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,500
The day the gang fell,

169
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,166
we all thought about
that night with the hake.

170
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:43,000
But we didn't lower our guard
because we needed to let off steam.

171
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,208
We did it out of despair
from having lost the gold,

172
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:50,166
and with it, something even worse,
the trust we had in our leader.

173
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,166
So it was hard to stay on guard
and realize that the real danger…

174
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,250
had lurked around us

175
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:03,541
from the exact moment
we thought we had broken Sagasta.

176
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,333
We came in here with the mission

177
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:10,041
to end this heist,
and that's what we're going to do.

178
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,875
There's two of you and one psycho.

179
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,041
Right now, you don't stand a chance.

180
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,208
More than ever,

181
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,333
because this time
they really won't see it coming.

182
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:22,583
We need someone to put an end to all this.

183
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,375
Pay attention.

184
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,583
You're going to go inside
the ventilation ducts,

185
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:28,750
but don't do anything.

186
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:33,458
Even if you find three of them sleeping
in front of you and you could kill them,

187
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,000
restrain yourself.

188
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,041
I'm at the main entrance.

189
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,375
-Status?
-There are four charges.

190
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,333
You have to move like a ghost.

191
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:44,041
We'll buy you time.

192
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:47,291
I'll negotiate for surgeons
to be allowed in to operate on Ramiro.

193
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,000
You'll radio the command post.

194
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,833
The doctors they send in
should be soldiers.

195
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:55,458
They're going to take part
in a covert operation.

196
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,000
What is the mission?

197
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,458
To open this fucking building.

198
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,125
They feel strong locked up in here.

199
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,791
But there's less than 10 of them
and the army's outside.

200
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,791
You're going to open up three gaps.

201
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:08,583
The loading docks,

202
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,833
large windows on the first floor,

203
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,416
and, most importantly, the main entrance.

204
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,958
Once you've done that,
we will have won this war.

205
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,250
They'll take the bank
in under ten minutes.

206
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,166
And you?

207
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,791
Together with you, and the surgeons,

208
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,208
we're the Trojan horse.

209
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,416
Main access cleared.

210
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,583
Good job. We'll wait for your signal.

211
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:43,208
Hey, so…

212
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:47,500
Considering how confused you were about…

213
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,416
your past, you, Manila, I don't know,

214
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,541
you seemed really into it.

215
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:55,916
How was I "into it"?

216
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,875
Your eagerness, your thrust…

217
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,250
I overdid it, right?

218
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:06,583
I overdid it. I should've been gentler,
but with the striptease you did for me,

219
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,500
you didn't make it easy for me.

220
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,833
Did you like it? Was it okay?

221
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,291
But seriously,

222
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,291
how do you feel now?

223
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:24,958
Everything is clearer now.

224
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,708
-Really?
-Yes.

225
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:27,625
Yes,

226
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:33,041
because before you have an orgasm,
your head is full of noise.

227
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,166
When you ejaculate,

228
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,500
only one of two things can happen,
you want to get the hell out

229
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,833
or stay with that person forever.

230
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,291
And what do you want to do?

231
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,791
I want to stay here,

232
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:48,625
with you,

233
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,458
holding you, forever.

234
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,041
If you want to, of course.

235
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,375
But with one condition.

236
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,833
What?

237
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,166
That the next time you want to go out,

238
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:06,625
don't lie to me.

239
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:10,583
Take me with you.
Party with me until the sun rises.

240
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,125
-Or until it sets again.
-Exactly.

241
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:28,125
Fuck, can't you knock?
What's wrong with you?

242
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,750
Someone stole the gold.

243
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:32,708
What?

244
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,583
Not a word about this.

245
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,125
If anyone finds out,
it's over, we're dead.

246
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:39,625
Fucking hell.

247
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:47,666
Come on, hurry up!

248
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,458
Let's go.

249
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,958
I have access to the server.

250
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,166
I'm in. We have the traffic cameras.

251
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,750
Check the ones on the M60.

252
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,458
They must have exited at kilometer 26.

253
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,541
Got it. Exit 26, Madrid-Barcelona.

254
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:18,875
We're looking for three dump trucks,
maybe four, between 10:55 and 11:10.

255
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,250
I don't see any trucks there.

256
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,250
Look for heavy goods vehicles.

257
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,000
Nothing.

258
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,708
Nothing in those 15
or the next 15 minutes.

259
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,208
They took a country road with no cameras.

260
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,750
Any idiot knows that.

261
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,375
-No one will be able to find them.
-We still have time.

262
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:37,166
We still have time
to protect our people outside.

263
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,083
Cincinnati, my daughter and my mom.

264
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,083
I'm not going to give up now.

265
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,625
You already did.
When you put your hands up.

266
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:47,000
You had weapons, men,
a secure position, and you surrendered.

267
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,125
It was a lost war.

268
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:52,750
They came in with patrol cars,
special operations vans.

269
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,750
It looked serious. Killing 20 policemen
wouldn't have saved us.

270
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,916
They weren't police!
It was a fucking magic trick!

271
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,250
You fell for your own tricks,
your own disguises.

272
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:04,083
-You fell for it!
-Shut up!

273
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,083
Wait a second.

274
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,958
Palermo already said it.

275
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,000
It's Berlin's son.

276
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,625
They're playing the same cards as us.

277
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,041
Lisbon was right.

278
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,625
Of course it's a magic trick.

279
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:40,708
It was a trick when they stole our gold.
It's still a trick now.

280
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:44,250
They knew we would check
the security cameras.

281
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:45,833
That's all we could do.

282
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,375
And that we would believe what we saw.

283
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:53,458
But maybe what we're seeing isn't real.

284
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,041
Rio, check the images again.

285
00:22:55,125 --> 00:23:00,083
Look for something, a loop,
anything, a sign that the images are fake.

286
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,625
The asphalt. It's wet.
It rained yesterday, not today.

287
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,958
They altered the images instead
of taking a side road with no cameras.

288
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:13,958
-Why go to all that trouble?
-Because they need to.

289
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:15,208
Exactly.

290
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:18,625
They're going somewhere
they can only get to on this road.

291
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:21,916
The M60 is a beltway.
They'd never use it to flee Madrid.

292
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:26,208
Because they're not fleeing.

293
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,833
They're hiding.

294
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:30,541
No one flees
with 90 tons of a country's gold.

295
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:33,416
What do you do
when you have so much money and gold

296
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,750
you can't take it with you?

297
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,375
What did Pablo Escobar do?

298
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,166
-What do pirates do?
-Bury the loot!

299
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,000
That's why they're using dump trucks.

300
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,916
-That's right.
-The gold is underground.

301
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,916
-Correct!
-Where do you bury that kind of loot?

302
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,625
Wherever it is,

303
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:50,916
the hole you need to dig
to bury 90 tons of gold

304
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,500
requires moving so much dirt
and machinery…

305
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:58,541
that we still have a chance to find it.

306
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:00,375
Higher.

307
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:02,750
Higher.

308
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:24,666
Attention!

309
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:28,791
I want everyone dressed
as anything other than a soldier.

310
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:31,541
Doctor, civil protection,
ambulance driver…

311
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:33,666
We'll intervene when they least expect it.

312
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:36,333
We'll approach the bank in camouflage,

313
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:38,583
gather troops in blind spots

314
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:41,583
and wait for Sergeant Arteche's signal.

315
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:43,416
-Got that?
-Yes, sir!

316
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,125
Go get them!

317
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,125
Let's go!

318
00:25:53,791 --> 00:25:55,250
I'm entering the library.

319
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,458
I'm about to make contact
with Major Sagasta.

320
00:25:58,541 --> 00:25:59,500
Copy, Sergeant.

321
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,208
All units in position.

322
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:19,500
Suárez, keep your men in a blind spot.

323
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:20,625
Copy, Colonel.

324
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,250
Wait for my command.

325
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:47,625
Established visual contact with the major.

326
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:48,833
Mendizábal, status?

327
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:50,958
-We're in position, Colonel.
-Copy.

328
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,708
Let's go!

329
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:55,750
Get ready!

330
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:57,500
We're still in a blind spot.

331
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:59,916
-Cañizo?
-Colonel, the charge is ready.

332
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,625
Sargent, all units are ready
and awaiting your signal.

333
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:17,375
Keep your head down.

334
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,833
There's nothing to see here.

335
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:23,541
Arteche.

336
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:27,500
Arteche, what's going on?

337
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:30,375
-Another heist man has come back in.
-Head down.

338
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:31,541
I'm going to wait.

339
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:34,750
How's that leg doing, Fatty?

340
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:39,000
Good. I can't feel anything yet.

341
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,500
-Are the hostages giving you trouble?
-No.

342
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,500
They're quiet.

343
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:45,791
I have to tell you something.

344
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:51,791
This sounds like a goodbye.

345
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:56,625
The Professor lost the gold.
I doubt we'll get out of here.

346
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:59,416
Palermo, you'll get me out of here.

347
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:02,083
You promised,

348
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,125
and you'll do it.

349
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:06,958
You may have your doubts,

350
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:08,583
but I don't.

351
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:35,875
-Someone do something.
-What's going on?

352
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:40,791
Initiating phase two.

353
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:44,208
Let us go. He needs
immediate medical attention, please.

354
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:45,458
Okay, don't move.

355
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:48,083
Hostages, get down!

356
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:49,708
Get down or I'll kill you!

357
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:51,916
Open your mouth.

358
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:55,916
Stick your tongue out!

359
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:57,416
I'm inside.

360
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,958
Units on alert, Arteche is going in.

361
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:03,875
It's not epilepsy.
He probably has brain damage.

362
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:07,250
-Subdural hematoma.
-We need to trepan it now.

363
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:08,625
Release us, please.

364
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:11,583
-Release the doctors, fuck!
-Major, shut up!

365
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:14,875
Come here. Slowly.

366
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:20,291
You too.

367
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:24,375
Move and I'll blow your head off, bastard!

368
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,250
Shoot, Fatty!

369
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,375
Shoot and I'll blow his head off.

370
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:33,125
You have a machine gun, kill them!

371
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:35,500
-Drop the weapon.
-I'm dying to kill him.

372
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:37,208
Give me an excuse.

373
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:38,375
Five.

374
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:40,041
Four.

375
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:42,583
-Three. Two.
-Fucking do it!

376
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:44,750
-Don't do it.
-One.

377
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:49,875
Drop it, damn.

378
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,958
Major, do you copy?

379
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:56,125
Library cleared.

380
00:29:56,916 --> 00:30:00,666
Major Sagasta is operational
and in charge of the Trojan horse.

381
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:06,125
Colonel.

382
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,583
You have the green light to proceed.

383
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:12,083
Calling all units. We're going in now!

384
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:34,666
Come on! Get down!

385
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:50,041
Charge!

386
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:06,375
Don't move!

387
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:13,958
Get down on the ground!

388
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,416
-Get down!
-Stop!

389
00:31:19,041 --> 00:31:19,916
Don't move!

390
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:23,833
Don't move!

391
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:33,083
Charge!

392
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:50,541
Let's go!

393
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:57,458
Hands on your head!

394
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,166
Get down!

395
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,458
Get down!

396
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,916
Hands on your head!

397
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:46,833
Hands on your head!

398
00:32:58,208 --> 00:32:59,583
Major Sagasta here,

399
00:33:00,791 --> 00:33:02,708
informing you that the gang has fallen.

400
00:33:02,791 --> 00:33:05,000
There are no casualties
on our side or theirs.

401
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,666
The hostages are safe.

402
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:08,125
Over and out.

403
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:57,625
Professor, this is Tamayo.

404
00:34:57,708 --> 00:35:00,291
You'll be surprised to hear me
on your gang's radio.

405
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:03,958
I regret to inform you that
this is not a trick like one of yours.

406
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:06,333
If you want proof, hold on.

407
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,333
Don't worry.
We're all alive, but on our knees.

408
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:18,333
They deactivated the charges
and entered in a coordinated manner.

409
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:23,666
And if you need visual confirmation,
just turn on the TV,

410
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,750
because they're going
to appear live before a judge,

411
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,666
one at a time, the whole band.

412
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,250
Like the Rolling Stones.

413
00:35:31,416 --> 00:35:35,958
So I recommend you find
the deepest, darkest hole you can.

414
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:37,416
We're coming for you.

415
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:39,458
That won't be necessary.

416
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:44,291
I'm turning myself in.

417
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:50,958
Even my own gang never fully understood
why I stayed outside the bank.

418
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:53,750
Some thought I did it out of cowardice.

419
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:58,125
If something went wrong…
I'd be outside and they wouldn't.

420
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,583
I promised myself
that if the gang went down,

421
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:04,708
I'd go down with them.

422
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,708
You've already won, Tamayo.

423
00:36:09,791 --> 00:36:13,458
So it makes no sense for us
to keep dragging this out with a chase

424
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:15,250
while we endanger more lives.

425
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:16,791
I'm asking…

426
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:22,500
man to man,
that you accept my surrender and…

427
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:25,666
And allow me to go into the bank

428
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:28,958
and come out in handcuffs
with my associates.

429
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:32,833
I'll be there in 20 minutes,
just in time for the photo op.

430
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:35,500
Try to make that 15 minutes instead of 20.

431
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:40,041
You're surrendering?

432
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:43,791
This is Colonel Tamayo.

433
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:45,916
Keep the hostages in the library.

434
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,125
Don't let anyone out of there.
Nobody gets to leave! Understood?

435
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:54,333
What are you trying to do?
Be a hero? Or a martyr?

436
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:57,583
Listen to me.
If the gang leaves the bank, it's over.

437
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:02,250
All will be lost.
There will be no turning back, but now…

438
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:07,291
We still have a chance.
It's one in a million, but it's there.

439
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:09,583
A chance to do what?

440
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:11,125
I need you to find the gold.

441
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:12,958
-What?
-With Benjamín.

442
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:15,750
-What?
-I need you to find the gold.

443
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,416
Now. Right now.

444
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:21,208
I need you to find the gold.

445
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:25,458
My God.

446
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:27,291
My God.

447
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:29,958
-Listen.
-Did you hear that, Logroño?

448
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:33,416
It turns out that we,
the new mom and the ex-convict,

449
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,916
are in charge of delivering
the final blow, the checkmate,

450
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,041
the masterstroke.

451
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,083
Don't fuck with me.

452
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:41,041
If anyone can do it, it's you.

453
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:45,791
I am a woman who just had a baby
and I'm breastfeeding.

454
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:49,291
I can't think straight
and I'm tired, very tired.

455
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:53,500
I don't know if I can deal with a war
between organized crime families.

456
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:56,125
-I don't know.
-All you have to do is find some robbers.

457
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:58,833
You've been doing it your whole life.
You're the best.

458
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:01,708
-Don't suck up to me, Sergio.
-You found me.

459
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:04,541
I'm the most wanted man in all of Spain.

460
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:10,708
Alicia, Interpol spent month after month
looking for me all over the planet.

461
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:13,208
They never found me. You did.

462
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:15,583
In a few hours.

463
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:18,416
You snuck out of a press conference
full of journalists.

464
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,083
You ran away from Tamayo,
from the entire police force,

465
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,625
while you were 9 months pregnant
and you found me!

466
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:26,666
You're going to find that gold!

467
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:29,833
So take those cars and this gang…

468
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,541
and go find the biggest loot in history.

469
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:43,583
Alicia. Yes.

470
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,666
Consider yourself lucky.

471
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,291
This is the first time
I've given a real hug

472
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:17,875
since Germán died.

473
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:19,916
And most importantly,

474
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,333
it's the first time I've smiled for real.

475
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:26,625
What made you smile?

476
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:29,000
Well, you're leaving me with Columbo…

477
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:33,291
and Starsky and Hutch and friends.

478
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:34,500
They're the best.

479
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:36,916
Sure.

480
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,125
I need you to do me one last favor.

481
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:04,291
I can't go in our cars,
they can be traced, but that one…

482
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:07,500
Go now.

483
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:13,708
Gentlemen, let's go!

484
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:16,125
When you see my daughter, tell her…

485
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:18,958
Tell her that I love her lots.

486
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:40,666
-Good afternoon.
-Are you the Professor?

487
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:42,583
That's right.

488
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:46,541
You have a lovely car.

489
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:42,375
Come on, push.

490
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,666
Come on, push.

491
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:03,625
Jesus Christ.

492
00:42:08,666 --> 00:42:10,583
They've cleaned us out, Colonel.

493
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,250
They took the entire national reserve.

494
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:17,625
Do you know what that means?

495
00:42:19,208 --> 00:42:21,333
It's a country's credit guarantee.

496
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:24,125
Its solvency! Its collateral!

497
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:28,083
-Do you understand?
-I understand, Mr. Mario.

498
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:32,208
-Cañizo.
-Colonel.

499
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:35,875
I want your men to fire
intermittent bursts every other minute,

500
00:42:35,958 --> 00:42:38,333
as if they're holding the fort down here.

501
00:42:38,416 --> 00:42:39,625
At your command.

502
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:42,833
Until we know what the fuck to say,
the operation continues.

503
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,333
Cincinnati.

504
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,083
Fuck, Cincinnati. I have to go, Professor.

505
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:16,333
-I have to go.
-Okay.

506
00:43:16,416 --> 00:43:17,916
-It's my turn.
-Okay.

507
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:40,500
Look at that. Only the party professionals
are left standing.

508
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:41,666
That's you and me.

509
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,500
Now this is the resistance.

510
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:52,333
-Exactly.
-No.

511
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:53,666
-That?
-That?

512
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,375
No, this is.

513
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,958
I love you a lot, Tokyo.

514
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:07,708
A lot.

515
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:10,625
Me too.

516
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:15,541
A lot.

517
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,541
You know why?

518
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:21,958
Because of my dance moves?

519
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:23,458
What?

520
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:29,541
Because you always make it to the end.

521
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:34,666
That's why you're still here
with me at 8:00 a.m.

522
00:44:36,625 --> 00:44:38,375
Am I wrong? Am I?

523
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:40,041
No, it's true.

524
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,541
I realized that you're a hero.

525
00:44:49,458 --> 00:44:51,875
The rest of us can drink and horse around

526
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:56,583
because you're on the other side,
holding the fort down.

527
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:00,666
Yes.

528
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:15,500
With you, we know nothing can go wrong.

529
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:24,833
You'll have an ace up your sleeve.

530
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:35,416
You'll do a magic trick.

531
00:45:42,625 --> 00:45:44,625
That's why we go back in the lion's den.

532
00:45:50,416 --> 00:45:52,500
Even if they point tons of guns at us.

533
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,000
Because we believe in you.

534
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:02,166
Like a mantra.

535
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:05,708
Professor!

536
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:16,833
You're our faith.

537
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:22,458
We have faith that,
even if all else fails,

538
00:46:24,333 --> 00:46:25,583
we'll still have you.

539
00:46:27,875 --> 00:46:29,750
No matter how bad things get…

540
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,041
even if they've beaten us,

541
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,250
even if it looks like there's no hope,
like we're almost dead…

542
00:46:39,416 --> 00:46:40,666
we'll still believe.

543
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:47,416
We know we'll always have the Professor.

544
00:46:48,083 --> 00:46:51,208
Professor!

545
00:50:08,958 --> 00:50:11,833
