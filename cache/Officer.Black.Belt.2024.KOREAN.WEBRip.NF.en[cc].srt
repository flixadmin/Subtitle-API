00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,301
I deliver.

161
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,762
My <i>abeoji</i> runs a chicken shop.

162
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:13,516
That's surprising because Supervisor Cho
made it sound like you do tae kwon do

163
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,935
or judo professionally,
you were so impressive.

164
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,604
-Do you?
-Not for a living.

165
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,691
But in both tae kwon do and judo,
I'm a third <i>dan.</i>

166
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,443
-Wow.
-Kendo too.

167
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,194
-I'm a third <i>dan</i>.
-Wow.

168
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,779
[both chuckle]

169
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,531
Can I please ask you a favor?

170
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,782
No.

171
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,034
[chuckles]

172
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,370
-Of course. Yes, please, ask away.
-[chuckles]

173
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,749
The thing is,
the martial arts officers in our division

174
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,752
are currently on
a triple-shift rotation schedule.

175
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,921
But because of Supervisor Cho's injuries,

176
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,842
the two other martial arts officers
now have to pull 12-hour shifts.

177
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:48,759
Mmm.

178
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,345
That means they have to work for 12 hours

179
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,015
and come back to work
12 hours later, on repeat.

180
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,476
-Yeah, that's pretty intense.
-It is.

181
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,353
The work we do is somewhat difficult.

182
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,064
Realistically, it's near impossible
to find someone

183
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,485
to fill in just for the five weeks
Supervisor Cho is recovering.

184
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,862
But he told me, when he saw you

185
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,908
and how you were... handling
the former inmate with such ease,

186
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,203
he thought that it would be
nothing short of a miracle

187
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,498
if you might be willing to help us out.

188
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:22,001
Oh. Uh, but would I even qualify though?

189
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,878
Yeah, you're pretty much in.

190
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,548
Tae kwon do, hapkido, judo, or kendo,

191
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,634
and because you have
a third <i>dan</i> behind you,

192
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,260
you'll definitely be in.

193
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,304
Jung-do-ssi, your skills
are more than enough.

194
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,139
Uh, but is it

195
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,934
something I'll have fun doing?

196
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,394
That's the most important thing for me.

197
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,104
Well,

198
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:46,108
something "fun" can be defined differently
for each individual.

199
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:50,530
But I can say, it's such a rewarding job
and work we're proud of.

200
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,574
What we do helps keep civilians safe.

201
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,784
But... [chuckles]

202
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,038
Is that, um, something cool?

203
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,292
Yeah, it is.

204
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,629
It's something where you'll learn a lot,

205
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,382
and by working with us,
you could have fun too.

206
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,299
Hmm.

207
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,762
I know about this because
I've done research for my writing.

208
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,598
You get an anklet because of murder
or another violent crime.

209
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,518
Most of what you'd do is chase
and catch people. It might be a good fit.

210
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,353
-Why?
-[man 1] Adrenaline.

211

[crunching]

213
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,570
What do you think about me
filling in for a martial arts officer?

214
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,114
[inhales sharply]
The triple shift sounds pretty rough.

215
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,741
-Why do you think it'd be rough?
-It'll ruin his sleep cycle.

216
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,493
Diarrhea is in great shape.

217
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,328
-I'll be fine.
-[man 2] Might be too intense.

218
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,247
[man 1] Can you stop changing your mind?

219
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,041
-[man 2] Stop telling me what to do.
-Go ahead and try.

220
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,793
[sniffs] Thank you.

221
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,715
They told me I'd have to chase
and catch the guys if necessary.

222
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,925
-[pensive music playing]
-But what do you think?

223
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,388
I'd be happy to see you take on
a new challenge and learn things.

224
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,391
You got a commendation,
and I'm proud of you.

225
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,144
You are?

226
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,439
Yeah, and, uh, I'm on board.

227
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,317
I'll be able to manage the restaurant,
so worry about you.

This is our senior martial arts officer,

Hello.

241

Supervisor Huh will be showing you
how to use the program.

-[Sun-min] Take good care of him.

[inhales deeply] Oh...

247
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,699
The people here include
someone who raped a ten-year-old boy

248
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,451
and someone who killed his own parents.

And when that happens,

253

we call them and persuade them nicely
to charge up their anklet.

if you're unsure of anything,
just ask Director Kim.

-It prevents slashing injuries.

But if the point is direct,
you'll probably bruise.

-Cool.
-Put this in here.

323
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,704
How'd he end up in jail?

324
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,372
He raped a middle-school girl.

325
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,875
Whoa.

326
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,755
Do you think I could shock him a little?

327
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,591
Only if it's absolutely necessary.

328
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:49,388
Our priority is to keep watch
over these guys and... prevent trouble.

329
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,181
Ah, right.

[music fades]

331
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,655
What is it?
Did you see something, Jung-do-ssi?

332
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,659
Right there. 201.

333
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,994
It's probably there.

334
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,457
I've delivered to so many buildings
that I can roughly figure out the layout.

335
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,751
See that window?

336
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,252
No security grille.

337
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,962
But that window has one.

338
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,757
He removed it,
so it's easier for him to run away.

339
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,010
I bet if you knock on his door,

340
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,679
he'll probably jump down there,

341
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,765
and that's where I can pounce on him.

342
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,601
And what if he runs out the front door?

343
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,271
Then I'll meet you there.

344

-Twenty servings?
-Yes.

477
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,715
And we'll get five servings
of kimchi <i>jeongol.</i>

478
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,800
Twenty-five in total?

479
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,677
Including the five servings
of the <i>jeongol</i>.

Oh, I don't have
the enzymes to break down alcohol.

483
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,350
Oh.

484
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,435
And I'm more fun sober than anyone wasted.

487
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,732
It's so nice to meet you, Moisture-ssi.

00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,192
-You too, Earthworm-ssi.
-Same.

489
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,780
-All right, shall we drink up?
-[all] Yes.

[Sun-min sighs]

492
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:33,417
I did some research on probation officers
while I was working on one of my scripts.

493
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,334
Oh, nice.

494
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:38,005
I know that it's a very stressful job
that involves many dangerous tasks.

495
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,382
-[sighs]
-Why did you decide to go into probation?

496
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,093
I was in a car accident when I was little.

497
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,928
Ah...

498
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,763
Our car wasn't even moving.

499
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,892
But someone suddenly came
and crashed into the back of our car.

500
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,811
The rear doors all caved in,

501
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:56,023
and I couldn't even move my legs
because they were completely stuck.

502
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,149
Whoa.

503
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:00,235
-[poignant music playing]
-And the engine caught on fire. Whoa.

504
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,486
I was only ten years old.

505
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,032
A ten-year-old had to
think about death in that moment.

506
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,783
"Whoa! This is how I die?"

507
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,411
I would've played video games nonstop
instead of studying

508
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,787
if I knew I'd die like this."

509
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,914
I couldn't stop thinking about
all my New Year's money

510
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,334
I had stashed in my drawer.
I was so upset about it!

511
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,252
[all laughing]

512
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,921
Anyway, um... [sniffles]

513
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,923
...some cops arrived to save us,

514
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,635
and they ripped the whole door off,
working to save me.

515
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,803
Oh...

516
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:30,640
I decided that I would become
a police officer,

517
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:34,436
to save people and pay forward
the help I had received that day.

518
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,521
-Mm.
-But I had an issue.

519
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,649
The growth plate in my leg
was damaged in the accident.

520
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,735
-Oh man.
-So my left leg is shorter than my right.

521
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:45,530
Because of that, I knew I wouldn't be able
to run around and catch criminals,

522
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,948
and... [inhales sharply]

523
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,035
...and then I wondered...
what would come second?

524
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,497
So then
I learned about probation officers.

525
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,414
Mm.

526
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,875
The fact that I could contribute
to reducing recidivism

527
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,461
got me deeply motivated to do this work.

528
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,713
Then once I got married
and became a father,

529
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,216
um, my job became more meaningful to me.

530
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,467
Why?

531
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,844
There were a lot
of sex offenses involving children

532
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,138
among the formerly incarcerated
that we monitor.

533
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,099
It's my dream

534
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:16,228
that we can have a world where
children are always protected and safe.

All right. Let's eat!

00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,335
Uh, we're wondering

544
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,213
if we might be able
to call you our <i>hyung-nim</i>.

But the thing is,
you have to pass a little test first.

And all that we need

00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,561
is for you to eat this in one bite.

Director Kim's neck was broken,

any nerves, so he'll be all right.
