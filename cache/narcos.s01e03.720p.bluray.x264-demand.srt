1
00:00:23,631 --> 00:00:26,885
I'm more of a dog man myself,
but no cat deserves this.

2
00:00:27,886 --> 00:00:30,013
Did you tell anyone
about why you were down here?

3
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:32,057
Someone on the plane?
Someone you met at a restaurant?

4
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,224
'Course not.

5
00:00:33,307 --> 00:00:37,228
Not to get personal,
but have you had any, uh... encounters?

6
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:39,022
- "Encounters"?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:41,315
I'm married.

8
00:00:42,483 --> 00:00:43,735
Right.

9
00:00:44,485 --> 00:00:47,155
Only people I've encountered
outside the DEA and my wife

10
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:48,740
are those Colombian cops in Medellín.

11
00:00:48,907 --> 00:00:50,324
No, no, Carrillo's solid.

12
00:00:50,408 --> 00:00:52,201
Did anyone have access
to your credentials?

13
00:00:52,368 --> 00:00:54,704
Did you drop your wallet?

14
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:55,872
Passport.

15
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,916
How important is this cat to you?

16
00:00:58,625 --> 00:00:59,625
Excuse me?

17
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:01,294
You gave someone your passport?

18
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:05,506
We were trying to get Puff
through Immigration.

19
00:01:05,673 --> 00:01:06,883
"Puff"?

20
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,676
I didn't name it, dude.

21
00:01:08,843 --> 00:01:11,512
Traffickers pay people
at the airports for intel.

22
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:14,724
A gringo coming in from Miami raises
suspicions. That's how you got made.

23
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,351
Don't let it rattle you.
That's what they want.

24
00:01:17,435 --> 00:01:20,188
You probably got a price on your head,
but no one's gonna take the contract.

25
00:01:20,354 --> 00:01:21,355
Fucking price on my head?

26
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,860
There's a standing bounty
of 350,000 US on any DEA down here,

27
00:01:25,944 --> 00:01:28,738
but you're safe... because of Kiki.

28
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,950
The "Kiki" Peña was referring to

29
00:01:32,117 --> 00:01:37,455
was Kiki Camarena, a DEA agent who went
after the Guadalajara cartel in Mexico.

30
00:01:37,622 --> 00:01:39,833
Kiki was captured and tortured.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,919
They skinned his legs,
put a bullet in each limb,

32
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:45,505
used an electric drill on his head
until he died.

33
00:01:46,422 --> 00:01:48,549
What the fuck were they thinking?

34
00:01:48,716 --> 00:01:52,971
They could kill an American
government agent and get away with it?

35
00:01:53,054 --> 00:01:56,808
Uncle Sam doesn't fuck around.
The cocksuckers paid in blood.

36
00:01:57,725 --> 00:02:00,187
They went after them so hard,
every single narco in the world

37
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:04,149
got the message
that the DEA is off-limits.

38
00:02:04,232 --> 00:02:06,734
Kiki was like Jesus Christ to us.

39
00:02:06,818 --> 00:02:08,069
He died to save us all.

40
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,364
Do not tell Connie that story.

41
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:12,740
I won't.

42
00:02:12,824 --> 00:02:15,243
- But you shouldn't forget it either.
- Why?

43
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:18,371
This cat is DEA.

44
00:02:18,454 --> 00:02:20,581
Mark my words, it will get justice.

45
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:06,687
My name is everywhere.

46
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:11,818
Newspapers...

47
00:04:14,112 --> 00:04:15,613
magazines...

48
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:24,205
Everyone is talking about
the "Paisa Robin Hood."

49
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:26,082
Pablito, I'm sorry.
If I had known that...

50
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,459
You're going to have
to pay for that, my love.

51
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,462
Anything you want, Pablito.

52
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:33,506
Anything I want?

53
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:35,967
Yes, my love, whatever you want.

54
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,593
You sure?

55
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,347
Uh-huh.

56
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,071
Then...

57
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,493
you're going to help me
get into Congress.

58
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:06,831
Yes, Pablo.

59
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,458
Yes.

60
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,974
Those shitty oligarchs.

61
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:29,520
Those people,
all of their lives...

62
00:05:30,771 --> 00:05:34,525
don't know what it's like to wonder
where their next meal is coming from.

63
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:39,989
I come from nothing, Valeria...

64
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,202
and I have more money
than any of those sons of bitches.

65
00:05:44,285 --> 00:05:48,164
If you run for Congress, you put yourself
in the public eye, you become a target.

66
00:05:49,457 --> 00:05:53,586
"I made my money from taxis" isn't going
to work when you face the press.

67
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,466
Pablo, you need a party that supports you.

68
00:05:58,674 --> 00:06:01,719
You need a proper political campaign.

69
00:06:03,137 --> 00:06:05,056
I buy the press, my love.

70
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:07,892
And as far as a political party,

71
00:06:07,975 --> 00:06:10,978
I am quite sure
that I can buy one of those as well.

72
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:13,773
I don't want to be good.

73
00:06:17,068 --> 00:06:18,861
I am going to be great.

74
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:19,862
A PAISA ROBIN HOOD

75
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:23,491
A drug dealer running
for president. It was crazy, right?

76
00:06:23,574 --> 00:06:26,702
Well, not in Colombia.
Not in the mid-'80s.

77
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:30,081
As far as Colombians go,
Pablo wasn't a drug dealer at all.

78
00:06:30,164 --> 00:06:32,250
He was a fucking winner.

79
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:35,002
The living embodiment
of the Colombian dream.

80
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:38,172
The guy who'd buy houses for the poor
in exchange for nothing.

81
00:06:39,006 --> 00:06:42,510
As far as Pablo could tell, the doors
to political success were there...

82
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,679
and all he had to do was to get to them.

83
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,059
And in order to do that,

84
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:54,105
he asked Valeria Velez
to introduce him to Fernando Duque.

85
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,156
Duque was a lawyer and a lobbyist
who represented the New Liberals,

86
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:05,950
a party who claimed
to represent the people.

87
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:12,832
Pablo!

88
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:15,084
I should've gotten into the taxi business.

89
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:17,378
- Valeria, how are you doing?
- Well, thank you.

90
00:07:17,462 --> 00:07:18,879
Mr. Duque.

91
00:07:19,046 --> 00:07:22,300
It gives me great pleasure to invite you
to the Hacienda Nápoles.

92
00:07:22,383 --> 00:07:23,926
- Nice to meet you.
- Please, come.

93
00:07:24,718 --> 00:07:25,928
After you, Valeria.

94
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:30,057
Please.

95
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:37,023
Look, I am not a rich person.
I am a poor person with money.

96
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:39,275
And for that reason,
I think that...

97
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,611
Well, I think that
I understand the people

98
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,905
to whom the New Liberalism
wants to give a voice.

99
00:07:45,072 --> 00:07:49,577
The party clearly needs to hear
what you have to say, Mr. Escobar.

100
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:53,789
There is a great deal of talk
about how you have made your money.

101
00:07:53,956 --> 00:07:57,710
I need guarantees
concerning the origins of your fortune.

102
00:07:59,253 --> 00:08:02,715
And Valeria told you...
how much I am going to donate?

103
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,717
- No, no...
- Look, I am not a politician.

104
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,722
I am not a successful lawyer like you.
I come from the street... brother.

105
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:13,934
I want to reassure you
that you will receive your piece.

106
00:08:14,018 --> 00:08:16,354
- It's not about that...
- Assuming your piece is ten percent,

107
00:08:16,437 --> 00:08:17,897
your piece would be what?

108
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:20,441
$300,000 just for you.

109
00:08:24,862 --> 00:08:27,862
Does that seem like a sufficient guarantee
for the Justice Minister or what?

110
00:08:27,948 --> 00:08:30,284
- Most definitely.
- All right, then.

111
00:08:30,368 --> 00:08:32,203
Let's go look at the hippos.
Come on.

112
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:36,999
Blackie.

113
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,334
Pablo?

114
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,547
- And what about me?
- What about you?

115
00:08:43,964 --> 00:08:45,466
I don't get my piece?

116
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,386
No, my queen.
The thing is that you...

117
00:08:49,678 --> 00:08:51,847
you're in this for love, right?

118
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,144
Look, Minister...

119
00:08:57,228 --> 00:09:00,231
Escobar has founded schools, clinics.

120
00:09:00,314 --> 00:09:02,650
He has created sources of employment
throughout Medellín.

121
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:05,319
The people love him,
and he loves the people.

122
00:09:05,403 --> 00:09:08,114
And from a legal point of view,
his money is clean.

123
00:09:08,197 --> 00:09:11,909
And according to Forbes Magazine,
he's a drug trafficker.

124
00:09:11,992 --> 00:09:16,163
Are you going to believe all of that
American imperialist propaganda?

125
00:09:16,247 --> 00:09:17,248
Take a look.

126
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:25,423
These are property holdings papers.

127
00:09:25,506 --> 00:09:26,674
Look.

128
00:09:26,757 --> 00:09:31,429
He's the owner of hundreds of properties
in Colombia and also the United States.

129
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:34,641
In addition,
this man has no criminal record.

130
00:09:34,723 --> 00:09:38,102
If there was,
there would be proof of his background.

131
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,484
How much is he paying you?

132
00:09:46,277 --> 00:09:48,362
I am thinking about our party, Minister.

133
00:09:49,447 --> 00:09:52,992
Escobar is prepared
to contribute millions of dollars.

134
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,580
We already support Jairo Ortega
so that he can campaign in Antioquia.

135
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,291
Let's let Escobar be his alternate.

136
00:10:00,374 --> 00:10:03,961
What do you prefer...
rumors and insinuations,

137
00:10:04,044 --> 00:10:06,422
or fewer representatives in Congress?

138
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:11,719
And just like that...
an honest man blinked.

139
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:13,971
You're not going back to that comuna!

140
00:10:14,054 --> 00:10:16,694
What, you want me to stay
in this apartment for the next two years?

141
00:10:18,058 --> 00:10:19,768
Oh, my God, you do.

142
00:10:19,935 --> 00:10:21,735
Honey, your cat was killed
as a warning to me.

143
00:10:21,812 --> 00:10:22,855
Our cat.

144
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,106
OK, our cat.

145
00:10:25,483 --> 00:10:28,861
What if you went back to Miami just for
a little while until things quiet down?

146
00:10:28,944 --> 00:10:32,781
- Oh, you're gonna make them quiet down?
- You're that good, huh?

147
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:36,452
I'll tell you what. I'll agree to go back
to Miami if you agree to go back, too.

148
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:39,163
- You prepared to do that?
- I'm not giving in on this one!

149
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:51,342
OK. I'll be waiting to take you home.

150
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:53,720
I already stick out like a sore thumb.

151
00:10:53,802 --> 00:10:56,055
The bodyguards
are only gonna draw more attention.

152
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,765
Just humor me.

153
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:00,851
I can't do my job
if I'm worried about your safety.

154
00:11:01,852 --> 00:11:02,852
Mm...

155
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:10,152
Hey, mind parking
down the street a little?

156
00:11:10,277 --> 00:11:11,779
I'll scream if I need you.

157
00:11:20,871 --> 00:11:22,498
- Buenos días, Father.
- Connie.

158
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,124
What, are you surprised to see me?

159
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,835
We've had American volunteers.
They come and go.

160
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,462
Well, this one will keep coming.

161
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,095
Surprised to see Elisa,
a communist M-19 guerrilla,

162
00:11:36,178 --> 00:11:37,722
working in the comuna?

163
00:11:37,888 --> 00:11:41,559
That's because you don't know
the liberation church in Colombia.

164
00:11:41,726 --> 00:11:44,604
And the priest... innocent, right?

165
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:47,523
Wrong.
He's more of a commie than she is.

166
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:49,400
Who is the gringa?

167
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:51,110
A child of God, just like you.

168
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:52,986
Hm. Got it.

169
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:03,038
Let's see, you are here for a cat?

170
00:12:03,205 --> 00:12:06,626
This isn't just any cat.
This is a gringo cat of the DEA.

171
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:09,336
- What's he saying?
- I'm telling him about the cat.

172
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,006
And what you want
is for me to find a cat killer.

173
00:12:13,173 --> 00:12:17,386
It was the narcos, Suárez.
We don't take this shit lightly.

174
00:12:19,054 --> 00:12:20,556
Your friend is a little crazy.

175
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:22,975
No hablo español.
I don't know what you're saying.

176
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:24,435
I don't speak English.

177
00:12:26,854 --> 00:12:28,939
Get me some information, Suárez.

178
00:12:29,022 --> 00:12:30,817
Look, I don't have enough people

179
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:34,903
to go through hundreds of hours of chatter
over a fucking cat.

180
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,699
If this was information about the narcos,
yes, my people are interested.

181
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,493
But they won't give a fuck about the cat.

182
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,329
- What is he saying?
- They don't like cats in this country.

183
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:44,747
Tell me about it.

184
00:12:44,913 --> 00:12:48,334
But if you want
to put all my people to work

185
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:53,130
to find out who killed the fucking cat,
that is going to cost you more.

186
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,259
They broke into the house to kill his cat.

187
00:12:58,135 --> 00:13:00,929
I think they made him
when he arrived at the airport in Bogotá.

188
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:02,222
Find out.

189
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,770
- Is that a D-103?
- Yup.

190
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:10,648
Let me get this straight.
Gotta pay this cop off for information,

191
00:13:10,815 --> 00:13:14,276
- then you gotta get a receipt?
- I gotta get reimbursed.

192
00:13:14,443 --> 00:13:19,281
This gentleman is an employee
of the American Embassy in our country,

193
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:23,452
and he assures me that you gave out his
personal information to certain criminals.

194
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:25,746
That's not true.

195
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:29,291
These guys killed his cat.

196
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:32,573
Maybe you don't know this,
but the mistreatment of animals

197
00:13:32,628 --> 00:13:33,962
is a federal crime.

198
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:36,590
Is this funny to you?

199
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:41,970
They can bring formal charges against you,
and you could lose your job.

200
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,849
Do you not need your job, Santiago?

201
00:13:45,974 --> 00:13:47,100
Yes, I need it.

202
00:13:56,861 --> 00:14:00,406
Mr. Murphy,
do you recognize these men?

203
00:14:01,365 --> 00:14:03,242
Yeah, you guys
stalled me at the airport

204
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:06,913
so you could take my passport
and copy and scan it, didn't you?

205
00:14:06,995 --> 00:14:09,081
- What?
- May I?

206
00:14:09,998 --> 00:14:13,544
You both are being accused
of conspiring against a federal agent

207
00:14:13,627 --> 00:14:15,212
of the United States.

208
00:14:16,004 --> 00:14:20,008
The cat is under the jurisdiction
of the American government.

209
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,970
And to kill it is the same
as to kill a police dog.

210
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:27,641
This is absurd.

211
00:14:28,976 --> 00:14:32,772
Look, I'm a Colombian citizen,
and I know exactly my...

212
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:36,024
You will not disrespect them!

213
00:14:37,317 --> 00:14:38,819
Is that clear?

214
00:14:38,986 --> 00:14:44,658
If I open my mouth, they kill me...
and they kill my wife.

215
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:47,160
He's having problems with his wife.

216
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:48,412
Shut up!

217
00:14:49,413 --> 00:14:51,373
- Imbecile.
- OK, gentlemen.

218
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,876
This is quite simple.

219
00:14:55,210 --> 00:15:01,300
I can get the phone number of the person
to whom you sent those documents,

220
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:06,054
and I can tell him that you accused him
of being the cat killer.

221
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:07,640
How does that sound?

222
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,856
I sent a copy of that passport...

223
00:15:17,065 --> 00:15:19,192
to a man they call...

224
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:21,945
"Poison."

225
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:26,700
OK, Poison.

226
00:15:26,784 --> 00:15:29,996
You're going to take this money
to Fernando Duque in Bogotá.

227
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,872
And this is the address.

228
00:15:31,956 --> 00:15:34,291
If they stop you on the road,
just salute the official,

229
00:15:34,374 --> 00:15:36,836
give them a little bribe
and continue forward.

230
00:15:37,628 --> 00:15:38,879
No violence.

231
00:15:38,963 --> 00:15:40,840
And you call me every two hours.

232
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:43,258
- Of course, boss. Whatever you say.
- OK, then. No showing off.

233
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:45,761
No showing off!

234
00:15:45,886 --> 00:15:49,974
- Nice and simple. Go unnoticed.
- Got it.

235
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:53,644
What the fuck are you doing?

236
00:15:55,145 --> 00:15:56,396
Getting ready, right?

237
00:15:56,563 --> 00:16:00,150
You are meeting up with politicians,
not with gangsters.

238
00:16:02,277 --> 00:16:04,279
Aren't they the same thing, boss?

239
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:08,325
Politicians scare easily.

240
00:16:08,408 --> 00:16:10,327
You're fine with just a pistol.

241
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,955
Go to it, then.
Go to it, dumbass.

242
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:17,125
According to CNP wiretaps,
the sicario "Poison"

243
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,670
was recorded saying
he was driving to Bogotá this afternoon.

244
00:16:19,753 --> 00:16:21,338
For what purpose, we don't know.

245
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:24,299
But if we don't respond
to the obvious threat to Agent Murphy,

246
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:25,885
we're sending the wrong message.

247
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:28,345
Police have the information,
then they should make the arrest.

248
00:16:28,428 --> 00:16:30,597
No. No, if we leave it to them,
someone will sell us out.

249
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:33,308
The narcos have informants
in their department.

250
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:36,062
What Peña's driving at is that
Major Carrillo should man a roadblock.

251
00:16:36,144 --> 00:16:37,897
- We can trust Carrillo.
- I don't have authority

252
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,190
- over the Colombian police.
- All due respect, Ambassador,

253
00:16:40,273 --> 00:16:42,026
but you know where we are.

254
00:16:42,109 --> 00:16:43,869
With enough money,
you can get anything done.

255
00:16:46,655 --> 00:16:51,035
Excuse me for saying so...
but this isn't much of a roadblock, is it?

256
00:16:51,118 --> 00:16:52,536
Well, if the roadblock is too obvious,

257
00:16:52,619 --> 00:16:55,956
Pablo can be tipped off
by a cop or by a passerby, who knows.

258
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,626
Can anybody in this country
keep a secret?

259
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:02,588
I've got a spotter set up
about four kilometers away.

260
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:04,311
He's gonna let us know
when Poison passes.

261
00:17:04,381 --> 00:17:06,581
You're gonna question them, right?
Because we need to...

262
00:17:06,717 --> 00:17:08,094
Poison's killed three of my men already.

263
00:17:08,176 --> 00:17:10,256
If I catch him alive,
you guys can question him here.

264
00:17:11,138 --> 00:17:12,431
Then you guys gotta go.

265
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:22,942
Hey, hey, hey, hold on, 65?

266
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,484
Sixty-five.

267
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:26,695
Hey, brother, that's a lot.

268
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,405
You sure?

269
00:17:28,488 --> 00:17:31,075
I counted every single son of a bitch.

270
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:32,701
All right!

271
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:35,370
Sure, but are you counting
what happened last night?

272
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,164
Of course, that was number 65.

273
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:40,793
Don't bullshit.
I was the one who shot that faggot.

274
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:43,629
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit...

275
00:17:43,712 --> 00:17:45,505
if I was the one
who killed that little man.

276
00:17:45,672 --> 00:17:48,926
You only shot him
once he was already on the ground, dead.

277
00:17:49,093 --> 00:17:50,803
I shot him first.

278
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:57,601
Come in.

279
00:17:59,186 --> 00:18:01,106
Did you give information about Poison
to the DEA?

280
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:02,314
So?

281
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,775
I'm still listening
to their phone conversations,

282
00:18:04,858 --> 00:18:06,735
and it's not a shipment of drugs.

283
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,529
They're carrying
three million dollars to Bogotá,

284
00:18:09,696 --> 00:18:11,157
and if two guys from the DEA
stop that car,

285
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,950
Pablo is going to hang you by the balls.

286
00:18:18,122 --> 00:18:21,667
- You don't have 65, Poi.
- Yes, I do.

287
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,043
Eh!

288
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:27,881
What are you doing, Gonorrhea?!

289
00:18:27,965 --> 00:18:30,550
Look, 65, man!

290
00:18:34,054 --> 00:18:36,389
Now we're going
to have to wash the car, man!

291
00:18:36,556 --> 00:18:38,684
Son of a bitch.

292
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,811
Yes?

293
00:18:40,894 --> 00:18:42,521
Hi, Pablo.
I have good news for you.

294
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,065
I'm going to help you
avoid an enormous loss.

295
00:18:45,232 --> 00:18:47,317
And how much is it going to cost me?

296
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,737
Ten percent... $300,000.

297
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:57,828
- How did you find out?
- One of your men.

298
00:18:57,995 --> 00:19:01,289
That Poison... he talks too much.

299
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:03,625
You should take his phone away.

300
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:04,960
Five percent.

301
00:19:11,008 --> 00:19:13,593
Suspicious vehicle approaching.

302
00:19:13,677 --> 00:19:16,805
OK. We have visual
confirmation. Four kilometers away.

303
00:19:26,273 --> 00:19:28,650
- Hello?
- Poison?

304
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:31,611
You bring your fucking mouth
back here immediately!

305
00:19:31,778 --> 00:19:34,240
- Yes. I'm sorry, boss.
- Now!

306
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,660
The son of a bitch policeman
tapped my phone!

307
00:19:38,827 --> 00:19:43,165
- These fags.
- You have a very big mouth, Poison.

308
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:44,833
Pablo is really pissed off.

309
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:48,962
Shut that mug,
or you will never reach 66, you hear?

310
00:19:58,722 --> 00:19:59,890
OK!

311
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:08,732
I'm calling this off. Nobody's coming.

312
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:13,153
- What the fuck has happened here?
- Maybe Poison spotted the spotter.

313
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,821
Either that or Suárez sold you out.

314
00:20:14,988 --> 00:20:17,324
Yeah, if he did,
he must've had a better offer,

315
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:19,243
and it wasn't a fucking cat.

316
00:20:23,496 --> 00:20:25,624
He has been called the "Paisa Robin Hood,"

317
00:20:25,707 --> 00:20:27,626
but he is much more than that.

318
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:31,379
He is a man to whom the people
mean a great deal. All of us.

319
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:34,382
To avoid suspicion
and questioning about his fortune,

320
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:37,761
Pablo ran as an alternate
for Jairo Ortega,

321
00:20:37,844 --> 00:20:40,180
a former congressman from Antioquia.

322
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:46,812
It was the first time an alternate was
more important than the main candidate.

323
00:20:52,525 --> 00:20:57,530
I am tired... of the
people with power running this country.

324
00:20:57,697 --> 00:21:03,745
This is a fight between the people
with power and poor people, weak people.

325
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:07,624
And this fight must begin here!

326
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:16,800
To have power does not mean
that one can abuse the poor.

327
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:18,177
If I am elected...

328
00:21:19,094 --> 00:21:22,681
if my friend, Jairo, is elected...

329
00:21:22,764 --> 00:21:26,810
those who have never had a voice
will have a voice.

330
00:21:29,396 --> 00:21:32,941
Those who are hungry will have food.

331
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:36,444
Those who want to learn will have schools.

332
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:39,156
And those who have dreams

333
00:21:39,323 --> 00:21:43,451
will see that there are no limits
to what you can achieve.

334
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:47,497
In me, you have a friend

335
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,416
whom you have always had,

336
00:21:49,582 --> 00:21:53,128
the friend of today, the friend
of yesterday and the friend of tomorrow.

337
00:21:56,589 --> 00:21:57,589
Thank you very much.

338
00:22:00,093 --> 00:22:02,804
- Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!
- Thank you very much.

339
00:22:08,352 --> 00:22:11,355
My friend, Jairo Ortega!

340
00:22:18,778 --> 00:22:22,157
Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!

341
00:22:22,324 --> 00:22:23,450
Thank you very much.

342
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:32,918
- You were marvelous, my love.
- You sure?

343
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:35,879
- Yes.
- Very good, Pablo.

344
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,965
There are a few things we can improve,
but we'll work on them.

345
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:39,966
OK, whatever you say.

346
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,844
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much, Valeria.

347
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,179
Congratulations, ma'am.

348
00:22:46,514 --> 00:22:47,515
Excuse me.

349
00:22:58,902 --> 00:23:02,655
To vote for Jairo Ortega
is to vote for the one and only Pablo!

350
00:23:08,036 --> 00:23:10,247
Tata, what's wrong?

351
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:16,878
Why does that woman need to know
everything about each step you take?

352
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,713
What are you talking about?

353
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:23,051
- Valeria Velez.
- My love...

354
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:27,806
Tata, she's a newspaper woman,
a reporter who follows the news.

355
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:30,683
And right now, I'm the news.

356
00:23:32,102 --> 00:23:36,356
When you win, don't disrespect me
anymore with that bitch.

357
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,192
Come here.
Come here, come here, come here.

358
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:41,778
Slowly... come on.

359
00:23:41,861 --> 00:23:43,447
Come on.

360
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:50,745
You are going to be the First Lady
of this country one of these days.

361
00:23:51,413 --> 00:23:54,916
Therefore, you are going
to have to learn to deal with the press.

362
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:57,919
That woman is not on your level, Pablo.

363
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,212
She degrades you.

364
00:23:59,379 --> 00:24:01,965
Please, don't worry about Valeria.

365
00:24:06,136 --> 00:24:08,263
Pablo!

366
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:11,975
A car, please!

367
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:14,186
A car to the hospital, now!

368
00:24:24,446 --> 00:24:25,613
You know what, Pablo?

369
00:24:27,282 --> 00:24:30,035
To me, it looks like
you are handling things very badly.

370
00:24:33,413 --> 00:24:37,042
You need to start thinking more
about your family... and about business.

371
00:24:38,502 --> 00:24:40,253
Thing is,
you can't be a politician.

372
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,297
Says who?

373
00:24:43,423 --> 00:24:47,553
You can't go strutting around
giving things to people

374
00:24:47,635 --> 00:24:49,346
simply so they will love you.

375
00:24:51,598 --> 00:24:54,267
We... are bandits.

376
00:24:59,647 --> 00:25:03,651
If you run for Congress, find someone else
to manage the laboratories.

377
00:25:03,818 --> 00:25:05,862
Señor Escobar?

378
00:25:05,945 --> 00:25:09,575
Come meet your daughter.

379
00:25:15,455 --> 00:25:18,083
God has blessed us with a girl, Pablo.

380
00:25:21,628 --> 00:25:23,589
How beautiful.

381
00:25:27,175 --> 00:25:29,761
Shh.

382
00:25:29,886 --> 00:25:31,388
Shh.

383
00:25:53,868 --> 00:25:55,537
Pablo is out of control.

384
00:25:58,831 --> 00:26:02,001
Mother Mary, man.
What do you want us to do?

385
00:26:02,085 --> 00:26:06,465
You can't give Pablo Escobar a spanking
as though he were some spoiled brat.

386
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:07,757
Oh, no?

387
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:09,759
And why not?

388
00:26:09,842 --> 00:26:12,596
Careful with the threat
you cannot execute.

389
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:20,019
You know what he's doing, right?

390
00:26:20,103 --> 00:26:25,108
According to Colombian law,
a congressman has total immunity.

391
00:26:25,275 --> 00:26:29,404
Do you think he's protecting himself
while we remain in the drift?

392
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:32,740
I do. He thinks he's that fucking
"Paisa Robin Hood."

393
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:34,909
So what do we do?

394
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:40,290
Well... we fulfill our duties,
stuffing the ballot box,

395
00:26:40,373 --> 00:26:45,420
and later we let Pablo receive
the applause, and take the risk.

396
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:51,551
We continue with our business...
in the shadows, like always.

397
00:26:52,969 --> 00:26:55,013
Carlos, what are the guys saying?

398
00:26:56,389 --> 00:26:58,850
I imagine that they're worried, right?

399
00:26:58,933 --> 00:27:01,520
They are not politically conscious,
brother.

400
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,859
How can you expect them
to understand your objectives?

401
00:27:11,904 --> 00:27:13,823
You do understand me, brother.

402
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:19,829
Imagine... a state governed by us.

403
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:23,249
Immunity for everyone, brother.

404
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:26,211
We, Carlos, belong to the people.

405
00:27:26,294 --> 00:27:29,631
I need you to use your influence with the
others to convince them that I am right.

406
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:31,758
If you win,
you don't need to explain anything.

407
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:35,637
And if you lose...
there's nothing to explain.

408
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:37,263
I like that.

409
00:27:38,598 --> 00:27:40,642
- Hitler said it.
- Fuck off.

410
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:42,227
Yes.

411
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,978
He also said that no politician

412
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:47,399
should ever let his picture be taken
in a bathing suit.

413
00:28:08,336 --> 00:28:10,004
Well, that's what he said.

414
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:14,676
And if I tell you, Carlos...

415
00:28:16,511 --> 00:28:20,223
that what I want, sincerely...

416
00:28:21,182 --> 00:28:23,351
is to help the poor people
of this country...

417
00:28:24,977 --> 00:28:26,438
do you believe me or what?

418
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:30,900
Pablo held most of his campaign rallies

419
00:28:30,983 --> 00:28:33,653
in the poorest neighborhoods
of his electoral district.

420
00:28:34,821 --> 00:28:37,449
He placed himself on the side
of the poor and the weak

421
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:40,993
in the fight against the oligarchs,
"The Men of Always."

422
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:46,499
And just like any politician,
he made plenty of promises.

423
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:50,920
Only difference was Pablo had the men
and the money to back them up.

424
00:28:53,423 --> 00:28:55,925
It was becoming clear to everyone
that Pablo was gonna win.

425
00:28:56,092 --> 00:28:57,427
Pablo! Pablo!

426
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:00,764
The only question remaining was...
what to do about that.

427
00:29:02,223 --> 00:29:05,059
Gustavo made good on his promise
to quit the labs,

428
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:08,605
so Pablo put Carlos Lehder in charge.

429
00:29:08,688 --> 00:29:13,318
With characteristic German efficiency,
he turned the labs into Nazilandia,

430
00:29:13,401 --> 00:29:16,904
and production rose 12 percent
in just two short months.

431
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:22,869
Gacha and the Ochoas
adopted a wait-and-see attitude,

432
00:29:22,952 --> 00:29:25,997
debating how and when
Pablo would dispose of Jairo Ortega,

433
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,124
his front man,
once the election was over.

434
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:33,045
As soon as the results
come out, Jairo Ortega will resign.

435
00:29:33,212 --> 00:29:36,299
I say he's running toward his death.

436
00:29:41,638 --> 00:29:44,140
As for us, we were kind of divided.

437
00:29:44,223 --> 00:29:47,226
We cannot have Colombia
become a narco state.

438
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:50,229
We need to find someone
who can prove this guy is a drug dealer.

439
00:29:50,313 --> 00:29:52,190
Let's stop his campaign before it starts.

440
00:29:52,273 --> 00:29:53,983
No one will go on record.

441
00:29:55,151 --> 00:29:56,611
I got a better idea.

442
00:29:57,696 --> 00:29:59,197
We let him win.

443
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,449
If we put him in the spotlight
and prove he's a trafficker,

444
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:04,160
the embarrassment alone
might get this country off its ass.

445
00:30:06,454 --> 00:30:08,164
But first, we had to get proof

446
00:30:08,247 --> 00:30:10,750
that Pablo was the drug dealer
we knew he was.

447
00:30:10,917 --> 00:30:13,002
So we went to Suárez,

448
00:30:13,085 --> 00:30:15,421
and gave him a lot of money.

449
00:30:16,673 --> 00:30:20,927
First, he told us that Pablo
was arrested for trafficking back in '76,

450
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:24,681
and then he gave us the name
of a sergeant who could give us the files.

451
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:32,980
Problem was, Suárez was on both the DEA
and the narcos' payroll.

452
00:30:40,196 --> 00:30:43,241
- Sixty-six.
- Bullshit. I shot him first.

453
00:30:47,495 --> 00:30:49,539
Then Suárez gave us
the name of the journalist

454
00:30:49,622 --> 00:30:51,917
who reported the arrest...

455
00:30:51,999 --> 00:30:54,669
and then the lawyer
who defended Pablo...

456
00:30:54,878 --> 00:30:57,881
and finally, the judge
who signed Pablo's arrest warrant.

457
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:02,301
We were like the Bermuda Triangle.

458
00:31:02,468 --> 00:31:04,721
You get too close to us,
you disappear.

459
00:31:04,888 --> 00:31:07,181
We gotta get something
on this motherfucker.

460
00:31:08,516 --> 00:31:10,396
If he was arrested,
there's gotta be a mug shot.

461
00:31:10,476 --> 00:31:12,437
Yeah, well, the file's gone.

462
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,981
If there was a mug shot,
then it's gone, too.

463
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,526
If there was a photo,
there's a negative.

464
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:21,529
Finally, it dawned on us.

465
00:31:21,696 --> 00:31:25,074
We had to find someone
without Suárez's help,

466
00:31:25,157 --> 00:31:29,621
and that was the photographer
who had taken Pablo's mug shot years ago.

467
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:38,004
We got his negatives, and for safekeeping,
we put him into witness protection.

468
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,248
- How long have you had this picture?
- That's classified.

469
00:31:46,053 --> 00:31:47,138
And what am I doing here?

470
00:31:47,221 --> 00:31:50,099
It's not America's role to get involved
in other countries' elections.

471
00:31:50,182 --> 00:31:53,185
Once again, the hand
of the United States remains invisible.

472
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:55,104
Your party took money from Escobar.

473
00:31:55,187 --> 00:31:56,940
I should think
you'd want to get ahead of this.

474
00:31:57,023 --> 00:31:58,316
Everyone took money.

475
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:02,737
By the way, it's all American money,
so why don't you take this to the press?

476
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:05,698
It should come from you.
You're the Minister of Justice.

477
00:32:08,034 --> 00:32:11,579
Come election day,
sure enough, it was a landslide.

478
00:32:11,746 --> 00:32:14,040
The New Liberal party had the candidate

479
00:32:14,206 --> 00:32:17,043
who got the most votes
in all of Antioquia...

480
00:32:17,126 --> 00:32:19,253
and his name was Jairo Ortega.

481
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,213
Ladies and gentlemen,

482
00:32:21,297 --> 00:32:24,383
with clear use of my
mental and physical faculties...

483
00:32:25,301 --> 00:32:28,429
I wish to communicate to you my decision

484
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:32,266
to resign from my seat
in the Congress of the Republic...

485
00:32:32,433 --> 00:32:35,979
for reasons of family and health.

486
00:32:36,145 --> 00:32:40,274
But I am completely certain that
my friend Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria

487
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:44,278
is going to continue
our social and political ideas,

488
00:32:44,445 --> 00:32:47,198
because Pablo is the voice of the people.

489
00:32:47,281 --> 00:32:49,241
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much, Jairo.

490
00:32:49,325 --> 00:32:51,118
I will give my best effort.

491
00:32:51,243 --> 00:32:52,243
Thank you very much.

492
00:33:25,361 --> 00:33:27,947
Imagine you were born in a poor family,

493
00:33:28,031 --> 00:33:31,951
in a poor city, in a poor country,

494
00:33:32,035 --> 00:33:34,328
and by the time you were 28 years old,

495
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:37,456
you have so much money
you can't even count it.

496
00:33:40,626 --> 00:33:42,211
What do you do?

497
00:33:42,378 --> 00:33:45,506
You make your dreams come true.

498
00:33:52,722 --> 00:33:55,474
Problem is, nobody can control
the dreams they have.

499
00:34:00,813 --> 00:34:02,565
Especially if you were Pablo Escobar.

500
00:34:04,483 --> 00:34:07,153
Especially if you grew up in Colombia.

501
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:15,369
There's a reason magical realism
was born in Colombia.

502
00:34:17,413 --> 00:34:20,499
It's a country where
dreams and reality are conflated...

503
00:34:23,377 --> 00:34:26,380
where, in their heads,
people fly as high as Icarus.

504
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:32,178
But even magical realism has its limits.

505
00:34:32,344 --> 00:34:35,765
Congressman Escobar... Sir!

506
00:34:35,848 --> 00:34:37,433
Excuse me.

507
00:34:37,516 --> 00:34:40,061
Allow me to remind you
of the norms of etiquette.

508
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:42,396
You cannot enter the hall
if you don't have a tie.

509
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:46,609
All right.

510
00:34:46,692 --> 00:34:49,070
- What is your name?
- Juan.

511
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:50,738
Look, Juan...

512
00:34:51,781 --> 00:34:54,617
that is a really nice tie.

513
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,161
- My girlfriend gave it to me.
- Really?

514
00:34:56,243 --> 00:34:57,578
Yes.

515
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:01,248
Well, she's in the history books now.

516
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:03,918
- Thank you very much, my son.
- Thank you, sir.

517
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:05,336
- Thank you.
- All right.

518
00:35:08,881 --> 00:35:11,176
And when you get too close to the sun...

519
00:35:12,218 --> 00:35:14,303
your dreams may melt away.

520
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:30,361
Good morning.

521
00:35:32,113 --> 00:35:35,908
This is to inform you that we have
a quorum and may now begin our session.

522
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:43,290
The Minister of Justice,
Rodrigo Lara Bonilla,

523
00:35:43,457 --> 00:35:46,211
is present here today
to address this honorable Congress.

524
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:49,881
I give the floor to you, Mr. Minister.

525
00:35:49,964 --> 00:35:51,382
Thank you very much.

526
00:35:56,179 --> 00:36:01,100
Much has been made
of the issue of drug money,

527
00:36:01,267 --> 00:36:06,731
"hot money,"
in our national political process.

528
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:11,694
I myself have been accused
of receiving campaign contributions

529
00:36:11,777 --> 00:36:15,489
from the narcotics traffickers
who have bought influence in these halls.

530
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:23,081
To this charge, I plead guilty.

531
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:29,336
In my eyes,
the sin of turning a blind eye

532
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,756
is as great as the sin
of outright corruption.

533
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:35,551
We are a nation of the blind,
and in our blindness,

534
00:36:35,634 --> 00:36:38,679
we have sold our country
to the highest bidder.

535
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,102
It's time for us to open our eyes
and to see the light.

536
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:52,860
Congressman Escobar...

537
00:36:54,237 --> 00:36:58,241
you stated that your great fortune
was built from a taxi company.

538
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:04,580
This photograph
clearly contradicts your claim.

539
00:37:05,372 --> 00:37:07,875
For this reason,
I demand your resignation.

540
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:10,128
You are not welcome in this chamber.

541
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,504
You don't belong here.

542
00:37:58,717 --> 00:38:01,346
Thank you very much, Juan.
Very kind.

543
00:38:01,428 --> 00:38:03,139
What interests the narcos

544
00:38:03,222 --> 00:38:06,809
isn't just the fall
of the Minister of Justice,

545
00:38:06,976 --> 00:38:10,813
but also to impede the strategy of
the government to combat his interests.

546
00:38:11,647 --> 00:38:14,775
His two arms: silver or lead.

547
00:38:14,942 --> 00:38:21,073
I want to inform the people
that the Minister of Justice has 24 hours

548
00:38:21,157 --> 00:38:24,952
within which to present concrete proof
regarding the insinuations he made

549
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:27,997
the day before yesterday
in the Hall of Representatives.

550
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:32,251
To the contrary,
I will proceed to denounce him legally

551
00:38:32,335 --> 00:38:35,129
before the authorities
and before the Colombian justice system.

552
00:38:35,296 --> 00:38:37,840
Pablo and his lawyers went on the offense,

553
00:38:37,923 --> 00:38:40,218
trying to smear Lara with accusations.

554
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:43,304
I am not looking
for, nor do I long for a confrontation

555
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:44,513
before the Colombian people.

556
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,100
I look for peace,
I have always preached peace,

557
00:38:48,184 --> 00:38:52,104
and have longed for peace and
the prosperity of the Colombian people.

558
00:38:52,271 --> 00:38:55,733
It's important to realize
that when members of Congress

559
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,861
can be threatened or bought at will,

560
00:38:59,028 --> 00:39:03,408
we see with clarity the real dimension
of the drug problem here in Colombia.

561
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,159
But Lara wouldn't back down.

562
00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:07,745
He denounced narcos at every opportunity,

563
00:39:07,828 --> 00:39:10,748
going after the guys
that we hadn't been able to touch.

564
00:39:10,831 --> 00:39:14,168
He revealed that six
of the country's nine soccer teams

565
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:16,003
were owned by drug traffickers.

566
00:39:17,463 --> 00:39:21,508
Gacha the Mexican was forced
to give up ownership of his team,

567
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:24,095
aptly nicknamed "The Millionaires."

568
00:39:25,346 --> 00:39:29,350
Lara denied flying permits
for 57 planes in the Ochoa fleet.

569
00:39:33,312 --> 00:39:35,731
He even fined Pablo
for illegal importation

570
00:39:35,898 --> 00:39:37,566
of elephants and camels from Africa.

571
00:39:39,902 --> 00:39:42,196
And with the action of one brave man,

572
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,324
Pablo knew his dream
of presidency was over.

573
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,576
What are required are honest men,

574
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:52,331
men who are able to put themselves
up against drug traffickers,

575
00:39:52,415 --> 00:39:59,297
who with complete tranquility buy or kill
any person or government institution

576
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,173
who is against their interests.

577
00:40:01,257 --> 00:40:05,177
Rodrigo Lara became the most
important political figure in Colombia

578
00:40:05,261 --> 00:40:07,305
with his stand against the narcos.

579
00:40:07,388 --> 00:40:09,848
He just wouldn't stop going after them.

580
00:40:09,932 --> 00:40:14,686
His bravery in the face of danger made him
the most wanted man in the country.

581
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:19,066
For his own safety, he was appointed
Colombian ambassador to Czechoslovakia.

582
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,695
He was slated to leave in two weeks,
but a lot could happen in two weeks.

583
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,574
I think it might be a good idea
for you to wear this until you leave.

584
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,578
You feel responsible, is that it?

585
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,540
Somewhat, yes, sir.

586
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:39,753
Are you so arrogant to think
you had any influence over my actions?

587
00:40:40,712 --> 00:40:43,882
That I put my life
and the life of my family at risk

588
00:40:43,966 --> 00:40:46,177
for American policy objectives?

589
00:40:47,928 --> 00:40:50,973
Let me assure you, Agent Murphy,
outside of providing me with the picture,

590
00:40:51,056 --> 00:40:52,724
you... did nothing.

591
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:57,104
The decision to speak out
was solely mine.

592
00:40:57,271 --> 00:41:00,107
And I highly advise you
to wear this vest, sir.

593
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:16,207
I will accept this vest... out of respect
for your concern with my well-being.

594
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:19,460
But I would advise you one thing
while you remain in Colombia.

595
00:41:19,544 --> 00:41:20,878
And what is that?

596
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:25,299
We accept your help,
but never your condescension.

597
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:30,429
When all this is over, Colombians
will be the heroes, and the victims.

598
00:41:31,972 --> 00:41:34,850
John Wayne only exists in Hollywood.

599
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,228
Just wear the vest.

600
00:41:50,157 --> 00:41:52,326
Oh, Pablito.

601
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:55,204
We knew they wouldn't
accept you in that circle.

602
00:41:58,374 --> 00:42:00,125
Damned bastards.

603
00:42:06,465 --> 00:42:08,926
You're too good for them, Pablito.

604
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,743
This is a fight
that you cannot win, cousin.

605
00:42:37,162 --> 00:42:40,541
You need to think more
about your family and the business...

606
00:42:43,252 --> 00:42:45,588
and abandon that ridiculousness
once and for all.

607
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:52,678
I will fix it.

608
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:07,901
Due to the vicious lies
and slander cast my way

609
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:11,280
by Minister Lara and his cronies,

610
00:43:11,447 --> 00:43:14,992
I've decided to announce my resignation
from Congress of the Republic.

611
00:43:17,244 --> 00:43:20,665
I ran as a representative
for the common man,

612
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:23,626
a voice for those who had no voice,

613
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:27,087
but that has happened
through much of our history.

614
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:31,425
The powerful have conspired to silence me.

615
00:43:32,092 --> 00:43:33,969
I dreamt of doing good.

616
00:43:35,721 --> 00:43:37,473
Those dreams are over.

617
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:44,396
But make no mistake...
I will not go quietly.

618
00:43:45,397 --> 00:43:46,773
I will fight.

619
00:43:47,441 --> 00:43:50,110
"The Men of Always" are mistaken

620
00:43:50,277 --> 00:43:54,490
if they think they can defeat
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria!

621
00:44:05,751 --> 00:44:06,835
Thank you very much.

622
00:44:08,337 --> 00:44:10,839
Thank you very much.

623
00:44:34,863 --> 00:44:36,031
He didn't wear it.

624
00:44:38,867 --> 00:44:40,827
Wouldn't have made a difference.

625
00:44:41,495 --> 00:44:44,749
Our strategy had gotten a good man killed.

626
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,420
