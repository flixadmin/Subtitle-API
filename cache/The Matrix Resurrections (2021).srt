1
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,841
<i>- Seq, I'm in.
- Captain.</i>

2
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,180
<i>You were right.
The skylight was a window pane.</i>

3
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:03,623
<i>I've got serious interference.</i>

4
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:05,684
<i>Weird. It's some kind of Modal.</i>

5
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,643
<i>Looks like old code.</i>

6
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,138
<i>It feels really familiar.</i>

7
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,838
<i>Drop a pin.
I'll signal for backup.</i>

8
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,257
<i>- I'm gonna check it out.
- Bugs?</i>

9
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:13,883
<i>If the general finds out
we've been fishing...</i>

10
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,693
<i>A quick peek can't hurt.</i>

11
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,178
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

12
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,642
<i>Shit. I think our signal was traced.</i>

13
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,615
<i>Bugs, this feels like a trap.</i>

14
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,950
<i>Bugs!</i>

15
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,326
Freeze! Do not move!

16
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,499
We will shoot!

17
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,914
Very slowly, raise your hands.

18
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,262
Here we go.

19
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:31,353
Hey, where are you going?

20
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:32,983
You were warned, Lieutenant.

21
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,235
I think we can handle one little girl.

22
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:42,076
You're wasting your time!
My men are bringing her down now.

23
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,280
No, Lieutenant.

24
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,364
Your men are already dead.

25
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,208
Seq, you with me?

26
00:02:58,387 --> 00:02:59,547
This old code keeps crashing.

27
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,240
Your projection's breaking up.
Switch to audio.

28
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,864
Bugs, this is a direct violation
of the general's protocols.

29
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:07,017
I know, I know.
But something is happening here.

30
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,599
Something important.

31
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:10,854
Oh, fuck.

32
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,435
We know what happens next.

33
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,225
She kicks their ass.

34
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,173
Now she makes a call.

35
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,463
The line was traced.

36
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,877
- And then...
- Then she runs for her life.

37
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,261
Are there any Agents?

38
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,763
We know this story.

39
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,929
This is how it all began.

40
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,052
God damn it.

41
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,728
This is where he began.

42
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:55,141
You're thinking this Modal is a loop?
Or a treadmill?

43
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,940
Some sort of sequencer
evolving a program to do what?

44
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,229
I don't know.

45
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,947
But I'm going to find out.

46
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,233
All right.

47
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,307
So déja vu
and yet it's obviously all wrong.

48
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,443
Why use old code
to mirror something new?

49
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,978
I don't know.

50
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,541
If that's supposed to be Trinity,
that's not what happens.

51
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,540
Maybe this isn't the story
we think it is.

52
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,050
Bugs, you have to get out of here.

53
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,258
It's gotta be a trap.

54
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,724
Shit.

55
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,506
Uh...

56
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,254
You all carry on.

57
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,724
As you were.

58
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,260
I'm just gonna...

59
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,562
see myself out.

60
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,024
Kill her.

61
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,933
Oh, Seq!

62
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,156
- Why did you save me?
- You first.

63
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,787
Who are you? Where did you come from?

64
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,001
Okay.

65
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,840
My name is Bugs.

66
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,710
As in "Bunny."

67
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,504
And tech that listens.

68
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,549
Do you know this is a Modal?

69
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:58,933
What's a Modal?

70
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,311
It's a simulation
used to evolve programs.

71
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,067
Do you understand that you are...

72
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,611
digital sentience?

73
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,397
I know what I am.

74
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,862
Just like I know my job is to hunt down
and destroy sentience...

75
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,242
like you.

76
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,948
And yet...

77
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,753
Here we are.

78
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,536
Here we are.

79
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,298
The other Agents
don't know about this room?

80
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,509
How'd you find it?

81
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,591
No one was ever in the key shop,

82
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,297
so I started looking.

83
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,558
More you looked, the more you found.

84
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,182
Story of my life.

85
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,321
What?

86
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,065
I feel like I know this room.

87
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,119
Holy shit.

88
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,001
This is his apartment.

89
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,128
You mean Thomas Anderson's?

90
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,419
I searched everywhere. He doesn't exist.

91
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,759
He stopped being Thomas a long time ago,

92
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,139
but maybe you know him by his real name.

93
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:21,975
Neo.

94
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,686
You do.

95
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,356
Oh, okay.

96
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,437
Uh...

97
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,144
I can't believe this,
after all these years.

98
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,781
You see, most people
think that Neo is dead.

99
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,533
But I know he's not.

100
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,240
Because I've seen him.

101
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Where?

102
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,917
It's not something
I can explain easily, but...

103
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,175
<i>But the moment he looked at me,</i>

104
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,256
I felt something...

105
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,299
unlock my mind.

106
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:05,935
Okay.

107
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,185
Something like that happened to me.

108
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:16,780
<i>I saw this pattern...</i>

109
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,490
<i>and it was everywhere.</i>

110
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,616
We can't see it,
but we're all trapped inside

111
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,288
these strange, repeating loops.

112
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,076
Somehow, I saw it in the mirror.

113
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,295
Just a flicker,
but it was like you said.

114
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,753
And suddenly I understood.

115
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,715
This is not the real world.

116
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,519
<i>For the first time,
I felt real purpose.</i>

117
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,722
I knew who I was

118
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,149
and what I had to do.

119
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,231
Who are you?

120
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,272
What do you have to do?

121
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,530
I am...

122
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,702
Morpheus.

123
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,122
And I have to find Neo.

124
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,628
Morpheus.

125
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,170
Okay. Okay.

126
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,379
Oh, my God!

127
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:20,754
I have to get you out of here.

128
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,005
I need to figure out
who built this Modal.

129
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,015
Okay, come with me.

130
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,288
You have to be ready to leave.
You have to be really ready.

131
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,312
And if you're not,

132
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,156
if you think that
this is where you belong...

133
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,399
You call this a choice?

134
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,338
Oh, honestly, when somebody
offered me these things,

135
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,923
I went off on
binary conceptions of the world

136
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,587
and said there was no way
I was swallowing

137
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,402
some symbolic reduction of my life.

138
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,096
And the woman with the pills laughed
'cause I was missing the point.

139
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,656
What point?

140
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,821
The choice is an illusion.

141
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,915
You already know what you have to do.

142
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,756
Truth.

143
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:06,475
Okay.

144
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,385
There's an old building
with a skylight and lots of stairs.

145
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,723
The Lafayette.

146
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,457
One of the four back doors leads there.

147
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,439
Oh.

148
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,003
- Don't fight it.
- Whoa, what's happening?

149
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,027
Keep breathing.

150
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:20,529
Extraction works pretty much the same
for humans and programs.

151
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,368
Ouch.

152
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,487
Ah.

153
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,199
Okay.

154
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,244
- Hey.
- Hey.

155
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,079
I've never worn
different glasses before.

156
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,245
Yeah, looks good. Which door?

157
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,751
- It's gotta be...
- Okay.

158
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,177
Agent White.

159
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,801
Agent Smith?

160
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,970
Go!

161
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,863
Seq! Can you hear me?

162
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,272
Bugs! I thought I lost you.

163
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,678
Can you get us to the window pane?

164
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,568
Bugs! Bugs! He's an Agent!

165
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,001
That window! Go hard!

166
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,674
What the...

167
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,728
What the hell?

168
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,831
Something wrong?

169
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,574
Uh... Just a little crash.

170
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,160
Morning, Bobbi. Morning, dude.

171
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,754
What a beautiful day to be alive.
Am I right?

172
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,375
- Problemo?
- He lost something.

173
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,006
Is this old <i>Matrix</i> code?

174
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,681
A little Modal experiment.

175
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,636
For <i>Binary?</i>

176
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,390
- I need a coffee.
- Coffee. Yes, stat!

177
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,562
I'm buying.

178
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,617
I'm not trying to
blow smoke up your ass,

179
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:08,238
but the first time I played the trilogy,
I was shook.

180
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,484
The paradox
between free will and destiny.

181
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,028
Are we all just algorithms
doing what we're supposed to do,

182
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,954
or can we escape our programming?

183
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,082
Genius, inside the context of the game,
BT dubs.

184
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,123
Hey, did I tell you
it took over my life?

185
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,583
Yeah. I failed the seventh grade.

186
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,380
Your game almost ruined me.

187
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,838
- So you've said.
- Yet here we are.

188
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,723
You tell me,
Mr. Anderson, is it free will

189
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,599
or destiny?

190
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,935
Oh, yeah.

191
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,728
There she is.

192
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,775
Total f-ing MILF.

193
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,695
Daggers. Look, I'm sorry.

194
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,107
I'm a geek. I was raised by machines.

195
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,491
Maybe you should go.

196
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,528
No, please. I... I promise, best self.

197
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:57,912
Best self.

198
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,076
Sure.

199
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,377
You ever talk to her?

200
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,550
Tell you what.

201
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:12,920
For all you've done for me,
let me do this for you.

202
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,380
Jude, no. Stop.

203
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,924
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Thanks.

204
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,592
Hi. Um...

205
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,512
I know this is all a bit extemporaneous.
I'm Jude Gallagher.

206
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,558
I work for a game company
called Deus Machina.

207
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,021
Hi, Jude, I'm Tiffany.

208
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,983
Tiffany. Wow. Didn't see that coming.

209
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,067
- Mom loved Audrey Hepburn.
- Jude.

210
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:35,984
Oh, and this is my very good friend,
Thomas Anderson.

211
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,903
He is a bona fide famous person

212
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,570
and considered by most to be

213
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,451
the greatest game designer
of our generation.

214
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:42,787
I'm sorry about this.

215
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,229
- Jude...
- Just talk to her.

216
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,620
Hi, Thomas. Everyone calls me Tiff.

217
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,713
Hi.

218
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,013
Have we met?

219
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,675
Uh, we both come here.

220
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,372
- Can I have your morning bun?
- Hey.

221
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,790
Are you trying to ball my mom or what?

222
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,100
Brandon!

223
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,023
Can I have one bite?

224
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:10,026
Babe. What's going on?
We're gonna be late.

225
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,062
This is my husband, Chad.

226
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,901
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

227
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,567
Babe, we gotta get Callie to practice.

228
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,531
Right. Sorry.

229
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,492
Come on, kids. Let's move out.

230
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:46,937
What?

231
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,648
Sorry. Uh, it's the boss.

232
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,665
"Billions of people
just living out their lives,

233
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,705
oblivious."

234
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,497
I always loved that line.

235
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,582
You wrote that one, yeah?

236
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,129
Every time I stand here,

237
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,557
I mean, O-M-G.

238
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,930
It's so perfect, it's gotta be fake.

239
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,391
Right?

240
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,515
Yeah.

241
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,434
Sure.

242
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,439
Have a seat.

243
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,652
Smoke?

244
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:40,994
I thought you quit.

245
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,410
I quit calling it a habit.

246
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,239
Now it's just a guilty pleasure.

247
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,328
Oh. Maybe I can make this easy for you.

248
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,296
I know <i>Binary</i> is over budget.

249
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,547
This is not about <i>Binary,</i> Tom.
It's bigger than that.

250
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,133
This is about our future,

251
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,427
which is a sticky subject,
given our past.

252
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,259
What do you mean?

253
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:04,720
How's the therapy?

254
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,347
Good.

255
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,519
Any...

256
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,809
episodes?

257
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,691
No.

258
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,103
That's terrific.

259
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,691
Look, Tom,
I know we've always had our differences.

260
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,318
What did you say
about our first meeting?

261
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,329
We had all the chemistry
of an FBI interrogation.

262
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:30,708
But look at this place.

263
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,123
We did this.

264
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,713
Together.

265
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,458
Yeah.

266
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:39,842
Now what?

267
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,338
Things have changed. The market's tough.

268
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,764
I'm sure you can understand

269
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,183
why our beloved parent company,
Warner Bros.,

270
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,595
has decided to make a sequel
to the trilogy.

271
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,725
What?

272
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,099
They informed me
they're gonna do it with or without us.

273
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,850
I thought they couldn't do that.

274
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,610
Oh, they can.

275
00:19:58,781 --> 00:19:59,781
And they made it clear

276
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,856
they'll kill our contract
if we don't cooperate.

277
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,403
Really?

278
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,195
I know you said
the story was over for you,

279
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,281
but that's the thing about stories.

280
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,793
They never really end, do they?

281
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,750
We're still telling the same stories
we've always told,

282
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:21,009
just with different names,
different faces

283
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,718
and I have to say I'm kind of excited.

284
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,884
After all these years,

285
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,141
to be going back
to where it all started.

286
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:35,223
Back to <i>The Matrix.</i>

287
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,230
I've spoken to Marketing...

288
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,199
Tom?

289
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,696
Yeah.

290
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,371
Are you all right?

291
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,781
Yeah.

292
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,913
What were you feeling
at that point?

293
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,801
What was I feeling?

294
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:11,681
I felt either I'm having
a mental breakdown again

295
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:16,182
or I'm living inside
a computer-generated reality

296
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,814
that has imprisoned me...

297
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:19,601
again.

298
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,703
Not much of a choice.

299
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:32,874
No.

300
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,824
Maybe it's not as binary as that.

301
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:38,120
Maybe there are other ways
to understand what happened.

302
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,749
Yeah.

303
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,131
Thomas, you are a suicide survivor

304
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,009
gifted with a powerful imagination.

305
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,011
Those facts have combined

306
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,509
to create dangerous fictions
in your life.

307
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,266
Yesterday, you walked into a meeting
with your business partner

308
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,597
and he ambushed you,

309
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:56,433
demanding you make a game
you said you would never make.

310
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:59,349
This attack
effectively took away your voice.

311
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,644
His violence triggered you
and your mind fought back.

312
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,529
You did to him
what he was doing to you.

313
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:10,322
We've talked about the value
of adaptive anger in healing trauma.

314
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,490
Far from suggesting
a repeat of your initial breakdown,

315
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,659
I believe this episode
demonstrates healthy self-protection.

316
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,582
And more importantly,

317
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,836
I remember how hard it was
for you to share something like this.

318
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:27,339
Which tells me just how far we've come.

319
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,680
Do you need a refill
on your prescription?

320
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,766
Yeah.

321
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,662
First of all,
I know I speak for everyone

322
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,081
when I say that I'm so, so excited

323
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:08,752
to be working on a game
that was such a, well, game changer.

324
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:13,723
Now, the packet in front of you
has our focus group research.

325
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,307
Inside, you'll find the breakdown,

326
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,390
including key word association
with the brand.

327
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,602
The top two
being "originality" and "fresh,"

328
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,641
which I think are great things
to keep in mind

329
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,898
as you begin working on <i>Matrix 4.</i>

330
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,029
And who knows how many more?

331
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,836
What made <i>Matrix</i> different?
It effed with your head.

332
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:49,213
On point.

333
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,506
People want us up in their grey space,

334
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,172
switching their synaptic WTF light on.

335
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:07,106
What made <i>Matrix</i> different?
It effed with your head.

336
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,940
People want us up in their grey space,

337
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,320
switching their synaptic

338
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,066
"What the hell is going on here?"
light on.

339
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:27,498
I didn't love the first one,
like some of you.

340
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:30,042
And, frankly, I've got zero tolerance

341
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,460
for anything that requires
a syllabus and a highlighter.

342
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,345
I like my games big, loud and dumb.

343
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:36,381
We need guns! Lots of guns.

344
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,050
<i>Matrix</i> means mayhem.

345
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,939
Mindless action is not on-brand.

346
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,026
She's right.

347
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:50,528
<i>Matrix</i> is mind porn.
Philosophy in shiny,

348
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:52,234
- tight PVC.
- Yeah.

349
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,235
Ideas are the new sexy.

350
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,210
Obviously <i>The Matrix</i> is about...

351
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,382
- trans-politics.
- Crypto-fascism.

352
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:13,553
It's a metaphor...

353
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,173
of capitalist exploitation.

354
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:32,024
This cannot be another reboot,
retread, regurgitated...

355
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,188
Why not? Reboots sell.

356
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,639
We are so far down
the wrong rabbit hole here, people.

357
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,701
You say <i>Matrix</i> to anyone...
You say <i>Matrix...</i>

358
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,367
Matrix... Matrix... Matrix...

359
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,377
this is what they see.

360
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,178
Allow me to sum up our goal
in a single word.

361
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,429
Bullet time! Bullet time!

362
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,142
That's two words.

363
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:08,306
We need a new "bullet time."

364
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,859
We need to revolutionize gaming again.

365
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:18,696
Revolutionize gaming again!

366
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,264
Afternoon, Tiff.

367
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,438
The ushe?

368
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,893
You know what, Skroce? I'm going wild.

369
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,978
I'll have a cortado today.

370
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,443
Fly that freak flag.

371
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,855
Mind if I get that?

372
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,032
Oh, hi.

373
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,274
Hi.

374
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,243
I remember wanting a family,

375
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,827
but was that because
that's what women are supposed to want?

376
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,843
How do you know
if you want something yourself

377
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,415
or if your upbringing
programmed you to want it?

378
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,840
Mm.

379
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:19,127
I pay my analyst a lot of money
to answer such questions for me.

380
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:20,802
Smart.

381
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:24,216
I should get more therapy
but honestly, I'm too goddamn tired.

382
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,426
Kids are exhausting, you know?

383
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,267
No. Never had kids.

384
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,898
Oh, right, I knew that.

385
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,647
Sorry. I googled you.

386
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,190
So, what's it like
being a world-famous game designer?

387
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:44,364
- Must be amazing.
- Uh... A lot of hours.

388
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:46,495
Sometimes it is amazing.

389
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,121
Most times,

390
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,537
I don't know.

391
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:53,294
But you made <i>The Matrix.</i>
Even I've heard of that.

392
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,376
Yeah. We kept some kids entertained.

393
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,292
So, worth it?

394
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,134
Can I ask something about your game?

395
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,518
Sure.

396
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,895
Did you base your main character
on yourself?

397
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,065
There is a lot of me in him.

398
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:24,700
Maybe a little too much.

399
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,366
Can I ask you something else?

400
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,746
Please.

401
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,747
There's a woman in your game.

402
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:35,963
Trinity.

403
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,549
Which is a weird
coincidence also, right?

404
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,218
God, yeah.

405
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,846
I like her.

406
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,849
- I like Trinity.
- Ah.

407
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,725
And I dig her Ducati.

408
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,763
Another coincidence. I love motorcycles.

409
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,689
My friend Kush and I
actually build them.

410
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:00,863
Really?

411
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:03,531
You have your analyst, I have my bikes.

412
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:07,493
So, I was looking at images
from your game.

413
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,163
At Trinity.

414
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:14,576
Well, I showed Chad a scene,
and I was like, "So, what do you think?"

415
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:17,628
He didn't get it until I said,

416
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,255
"Don't you think she looks like me?"

417
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,793
You know what he did?

418
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,386
He laughed.

419
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,978
And I laughed too, like it was a joke.

420
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,603
How could it not be, right?

421
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,441
Made me so angry.

422
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:43,278
I hated myself for laughing.

423
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:48,033
I wanted to kick him so hard.

424
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,452
Not too hard.

425
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,702
Maybe just hard enough
to break his jaw off.

426
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,044
And right now,
you're probably regretting

427
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,542
sitting down with me.

428
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:06,294
This is the best thing I've done
in a long time.

429
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,675
I have to take this.

430
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,356
Hi, this is Tiff.

431
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:18,605
Oh, God, no.

432
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,108
I'll be right there.

433
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:25,525
My... My, uh, youngest
stuck a Lego up his nose.

434
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,690
Oh.

435
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:30,161
I gotta go.

436
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:34,951
I hope I see you again.

437
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,581
<i>There has been a report of an emergency.</i>

438
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,688
<i>Proceed calmly to the nearest exit
and leave the building immediately.</i>

439
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,098
What's going on?

440
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,196
We probably just got swatted
by some 14-year-old.

441
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,922
Yeah, someone pissed
about the latest update.

442
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:05,946
Or they're just a dick.

443
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:09,197
Please move to the exits.
Building's being evacuated.

444
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,054
Sir, this way.

445
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,057
Jude?

446
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,642
Jude!

447
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:50,072
At last.

448
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:53,317
Ah.

449
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,530
I wasn't too sure about the callback,
but, you know, it was hard to resist.

450
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:57,908
What?

451
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,539
Morpheus Uno. Reveal at the window.

452
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,950
Lightning, thunder and theater.

453
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,665
At last.

454
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:08,420
All these years later, here's me,
strolling out of a toilet stall.

455
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,004
Tragedy or farce?

456
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,839
I know you.

457
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,799
Not every day you meet your maker.

458
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,089
This can't be happening.

459
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,928
Oh, most definitely is.

460
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,343
You can't be a character I coded.

461
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,512
One hundred percent natural.

462
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:30,024
How?

463
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,444
All the explanation you need.

464
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,278
Oh.

465
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,487
No.

466
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,531
No, no, no.

467
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,408
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What do you mean, "no"?

468
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:45,169
You wanted this, you did this.
This was your idea.

469
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:49,374
It was a test.
An experiment.

470
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:51,880
An experiment?

471
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,387
You put me in a tiny-ass Modal,

472
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:56,718
left me to bang my head

473
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,140
till I nearly lost my shit
searching for you,

474
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,927
as an experiment.

475
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,999
- The exit's breaking down.
- He hasn't taken the pill.

476
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:04,354
What? There's no time.

477
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,185
I know, I know. He's having a moment.

478
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,655
Does he know
how hard it was to hack that mirror?

479
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,358
Still open.

480
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:16,533
This... This can't be real.

481
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,383
Target acquired.
We got him.

482
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,290
This isn't happening.

483
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:29,922
It's in my mind. It's in my mind.

484
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,691
Hey, you!
Stop! Hold it!

485
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,724
This can't be happening.

486
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,612
Freeze! Don't move!

487
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,697
Neo!

488
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,005
Oh, my God!

489
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,840
Neo!

490
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,923
Mr. Anderson!

491
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,974
No.

492
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,145
It can't be.

493
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,774
I've missed you.

494
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,704
It's in my mind.

495
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,214
It's in my mind.

496
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,882
Can you hear me, Thomas?

497
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:49,178
Follow my voice.

498
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,766
Feel the tips of your fingers.
What are they touching?

499
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,144
The bell.

500
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,072
Do you hear the bell?

501
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,537
Do you remember what happened?
How you got here?

502
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,456
You must have walked.

503
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:13,085
I heard Déja Vu outside,
opened my door, and there you were.

504
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,800
You feel like you can talk about it?

505
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:22,782
When we started working together,

506
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:27,175
you had lost your capacity
to discern reality from fiction.

507
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:30,060
You came to me
after trying to jump off a building.

508
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,679
You said you wanted to fly away.

509
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:48,908
We have made
a lot of progress since then,

510
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,289
but you seem
particularly triggered right now.

511
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,745
Can you tell me how it started?

512
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,457
He texted me.

513
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,918
Who?

514
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:00,503
Morpheus.

515
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:01,674
Ah.

516
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,761
So, he's back.

517
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,013
It wasn't actually him.

518
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,926
It was a program I coded for a Modal.

519
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,725
And this Modal, Morpheus,

520
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,014
came to help you escape

521
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:19,522
from a virtual reality
called <i>The Matrix?</i>

522
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:30,992
Am I crazy?

523
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,494
We don't use that word in here.

524
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,121
What word should I use?

525
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:40,456
What word explains
what is happening to me?

526
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,341
Can I see the texts?

527
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,336
They were erased.

528
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,974
If we got in my car
and drove to your office,

529
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,889
what do you think we'd find there?

530
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,101
Nothing.

531
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,902
Because there was no attack.

532
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,693
No one was Killed.

533
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,195
No one texted.

534
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,869
My mind made it all up.

535
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,539
Is that what I'm supposed to say?

536
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,537
Is that what you believe?

537
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,743
It felt real.

538
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,628
Of course.

539
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:24,254
It was your great ambition
to make a game

540
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:26,426
that was indistinguishable from reality.

541
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,679
To achieve this goal,

542
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,555
you converted elements of your life
into narrative.

543
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:32,925
Your sublimated anger toward
your business partner

544
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,718
cast him as your nemesis.

545
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:39,890
A married woman named Tiffany
became the Trinity of a doomed romance.

546
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:44,027
Even your dislike of my cat
made it into your <i>Matrix.</i>

547
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,480
There's nothing wrong with that.

548
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,114
It's what artists do.

549
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,241
But it becomes a problem

550
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,912
when fantasies
endanger us or other people.

551
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,496
We don't want anyone to get hurt,

552
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,001
do we, Thomas?

553
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,004
Hi, Thomas. Everyone calls me Tiff.

554
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,384
- Who are you?
- My name is Trinity.

555
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,662
<i>No one can tell you
you're in love.</i>

556
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,973
You just know it, through and through.

557
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,103
Balls to bones.

558
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,474
<i>You feel this?</i>

559
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:24,894
I'm never letting go.

560
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,619
<i>You have to let it all go, Neo.</i>

561
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,076
Free your mind.

562
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:56,887
Huh.

563
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,389
Looks easy enough.

564
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,858
"Free my mind." Shit.

565
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,493
Okay.

566
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,570
Free my mind.

567
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,342
I fly...

568
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:37,720
or I fall.

569
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:47,230
Who the hell are you?

570
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,270
You won't remember me,

571
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,906
but a long time ago, you changed my life

572
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,609
when you leapt off another roof.

573
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:59,071
<i>Back then,
I was just like any other coppertop,</i>

574
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,576
<i>pretending my life</i>

575
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,288
until I looked up and I saw you.

576
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,586
<i>It was a different you, but I saw</i>

577
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,459
the real you,

578
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,008
just a second before...

579
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:14,594
you leapt.

580
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:21,093
And you never fell.

581
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,558
Are you the one that hacked my Modal?

582
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,234
Yeah.

583
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:34,440
That'll be Jude. He's not your friend.

584
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,294
He's a handle,
a program used to control you.

585
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,194
He's on his way here,
and he's bringing Agents with him.

586
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:41,746
Jude.

587
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:45,204
<i>Bro, I've been calling you all night.
We have a major problemo.</i>

588
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,332
Are you alone?

589
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,211
<i>That's kind of a sexy question, dude.</i>

590
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,340
They don't look like
typical Agents.

591
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,908
They use bots now,
skinned as normal people,

592
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,594
which means they're everywhere
and you never know who to trust.

593
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,138
Why should I trust you?

594
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,353
Because if they open that door,
we lose our hack.

595
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,108
I will be caught and killed

596
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,798
and you will be put right back
on that treadmill they designed for you

597
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:15,342
just like they did the last time
you tried to leap your way out.

598
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,068
I know why you left your Modal open.

599
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,361
You needed someone else
to free Morpheus.

600
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,851
And it's because of him
that we were able to get to you.

601
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:27,539
I know these things the same way
that I knew one day I would find you.

602
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:31,125
And that when I did,
you would be ready for this.

603
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:37,085
If you want the truth, Neo,

604
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,346
you're going to have to follow me.

605
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:42,893
Okay.

606
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,155
- Where are we?
- Tokyo.

607
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:07,074
A moving portal
makes it harder to track us.

608
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,618
- Seq is the best of them.
- Portal's clean.

609
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:11,161
Reading no shadows.

610
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:14,339
I don't remember this.

611
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,592
We don't have to run
to phone booths anymore either.

612
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,595
Door's on your right.

613
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,153
Set and setting, right?

614
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,571
Oh, no.

615
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,114
It's all about set...

616
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,287
and setting.

617
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:54,455
After our first contact went so badly,
we thought elements from your past

618
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,112
might help ease you into the present.

619
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,837
Nothing comforts anxiety like

620
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,467
a little nostalgia.

621
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,800
This is footage from your game.

622
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,021
Time is always against us,

623
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:14,941
etcetera, etcetera.

624
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:20,655
No one can be told what the Matrix is,
blah, blah, blah.

625
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,201
You gotta see it to believe it.

626
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:29,875
Time to fly.

627
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,872
Wait.

628
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,046
If this is real,

629
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,956
if I haven't lost my mind,
does that mean

630
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,050
this happened?

631
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,519
But if it did,

632
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,149
then we died.

633
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,231
Obviously not.

634
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,816
Why the Machines kept you alive

635
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:03,732
and why they went
to such lengths to hide you

636
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,492
are questions we don't have answers to.

637
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:06,947
Hide me?

638
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:11,198
I've been at a company making
a game called <i>The Matrix.</i>

639
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:14,410
Doesn't seem like
they were trying to hide anything.

640
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:16,148
We've been tracking
that company for years.

641
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:18,789
We screened
every Thomas Anderson we found.

642
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:22,675
What we didn't understand
was that they could alter your DSI.

643
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:25,045
Pods generate your digital self-image

644
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,551
through a feedback system
called Semblance.

645
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,090
This is how you look to yourself.

646
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,719
Somehow they were able
to alter your DSI loop.

647
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:35,472
This is how everyone else sees you.

648
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:51,992
Twenty years?

649
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,918
Why did it take 20 years to find me?

650
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:58,874
It took a lot longer than that.

651
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:01,005
It's been over 60 years
since you and Trinity

652
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,674
flew to one of the Machine Cities.

653
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:04,386
What?

654
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,260
There's so much we don't know.

655
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:08,638
Like why you've barely aged,

656
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,840
or how many times
they've altered your DSI.

657
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,371
But based on what we do know,

658
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:15,228
it appears no one found you
because you didn't want to be found.

659
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,105
- That's not true.
- Maybe it isn't.

660
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:20,966
Maybe there's no foundation
to the rumors that you disappeared

661
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,589
because you were
working with the Machines

662
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:23,613
from the beginning.

663
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:24,942
Morpheus, stop.

664
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:28,154
All I'm saying is this is the moment

665
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,659
for you to show us what is real.

666
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,616
If you want out,

667
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,451
you'll take this pill.

668
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,326
But if you are where you belong,

669
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,586
you can go back to this.

670
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,042
Every day.

671
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,754
Over and over, forever.

672
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,429
Fuck.

673
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:01,649
Keep the loop tight.

674
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,434
Cybebe needs that tower pin.

675
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,199
I got a signal. It's faint.

676
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,741
It's definitely off-grid.

677
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,084
Captain. I'm tracking
a whole lot of weird.

678
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,593
- What?
- It's some kind of graft.

679
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,139
Thomas?

680
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:40,100
Oh, God.

681
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:42,223
Oh, no.

682
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,935
- We got company.
- How'd they find us?

683
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:50,278
Thomas, none of this is real.

684
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:53,660
You are in the midst
of a serious psychotic break.

685
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,491
- Lexy?
- Almost there.

686
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:57,871
Thomas?

687
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:01,618
Thomas, please. This is not a game.

688
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:03,252
Feel my hand.

689
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:04,537
This is what is real.

690
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,129
Stay with me.

691
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:11,048
No. No.

692
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,243
Stay with me.

693
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:18,812
Neo!

694
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:23,525
Morpheus!

695
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:26,480
Let's go, let's go!

696
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,970
- Bots are being activated.
- It's a swarm.

697
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,291
Come on!

698
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,222
I got a hack in the bathroom. Hurry.

699
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,246
Yes.

700
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,040
Come on!

701
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,126
Seq, where?

702
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:10,421
- That mirror.
- What? We'll never fit.

703
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:12,235
You gotta fit, 'cause I don't have
another way off this train.

704
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,859
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

705
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:15,835
I know. I know.

706
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,971
Think perspective.
Closer you are, bigger it gets.

707
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,177
Okay, come on.

708
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:26,687
In you go.

709
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:22,844
Trinity.

710
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:29,187
No.

711
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:53,015
Welcome back to the real world.

712
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:02,653
Trinity.

713
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:03,688
What's up, Doc?

714
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,635
His vital systems
have been meticulously maintained,

715
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,445
but it doesn't look good.

716
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,207
- We're losing him.
- Cold boot could shock him.

717
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:16,794
Do it.

718
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,431
I remember this.

719
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:35,636
The Construct.

720
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:40,649
In between
everything and nothing.

721
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:43,027
Welcome to the Crib.

722
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,655
I've been chilling here
in the ship network,

723
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,656
learning all about you.

724
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,491
And me.

725
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:04,002
Careful. It'll do your head in.

726
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:08,795
Are memories turned into fiction
any less real?

727
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:15,302
Is reality based in memory
nothing but fiction?

728
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:17,095
As to my role in all this,

729
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:19,772
my best guess is that you wrote me

730
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:22,065
as an algorithmic reflection
of two forces

731
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:24,352
that helped you become you,

732
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:27,735
Morpheus and Agent Smith.

733
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:31,989
A combo pack of counterprogramming
that was...

734
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,660
Let's just say,
more than a little bit crazy-making.

735
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:41,619
But it worked because here we are.

736
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,292
Now, for the bad news.

737
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,673
Your brain is hooked on this shit

738
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:49,461
<i>The Matrix</i> has been force-feeding you
for years.

739
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:51,345
Hooked bad.

740
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:53,075
You're going through major withdrawals.

741
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:55,473
Docbots are giving you crap odds
for surviving.

742
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,477
But, see, they don't know you like I do.

743
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,557
I know exactly what you need.

744
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,918
You gotta be kidding.

745
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,252
Uh-uh.

746
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:30,547
No joke.

747
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:34,631
Could be this is the first day
of the rest of your life.

748
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:37,175
But if you want it...

749
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:42,138
You gotta fight for it.

750
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:46,225
No. I'm done fighting.

751
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:48,279
Are you?

752
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,029
What the hell is he doing?

753
00:57:34,326 --> 00:57:36,988
Oh, yeah. They taught you good.

754
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:45,786
Made you believe
their world was all you deserved.

755
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,829
But some part of you knew
that was a lie.

756
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:50,543
Some part of you
remembered what was real.

757
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:54,460
You don't know me.

758
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:56,097
No?

759
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:03,104
Ooh.

760
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:39,800
I know you,

761
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:42,091
because I know the only thing
that still matters to you.

762
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,136
I know it's why you're here,
why you're still fighting

763
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,387
and why you will never give up.

764
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,866
Come on, Neo!

765
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:05,493
This is it.

766
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:09,076
This is your last chance.

767
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:20,145
You gotta fight for your goddamn life
if you want to see Trinity again.

768
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:26,348
Come on, Neo! Fight for her!

769
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:31,599
- Holy shit.
- Fight for her!

770
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,361
- Hey.
- Hey.

771
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:28,788
Mind if I...

772
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,469
How are you doing?

773
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:47,133
If this plug is actually real,

774
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:51,436
that means they took my life...

775
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:56,358
And turned it into a video game.

776
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:01,109
How am I doing?

777
01:01:02,117 --> 01:01:03,403
I don't know.

778
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,364
I don't even know how to know.

779
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:08,950
That's it, isn't it?

780
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:12,666
If we don't know what's real,

781
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:15,877
we can't resist.

782
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:21,838
They took your story,
something that meant

783
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,175
so much to people like me,

784
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:29,467
and turned it into something trivial.

785
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,061
That's what the Matrix does.

786
01:01:33,982 --> 01:01:36,098
It weaponizes every idea.

787
01:01:36,902 --> 01:01:38,267
Every dream.

788
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:41,562
Everything that's important to us.

789
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:45,365
Where better to bury truth

790
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:48,911
than inside something
as ordinary as a video game?

791
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,575
That sounds like the Oracle.

792
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,750
Heard so much about her.

793
01:01:57,672 --> 01:01:59,083
She was gone before I was free.

794
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:01,759
Gone?

795
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:05,045
When this new version of the Matrix
was uploaded,

796
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,096
there was a purge.

797
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:16,726
They promised peace
and they gave us purge.

798
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:19,228
No.

799
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:21,439
No, there was peace.

800
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:27,237
You made it possible,
and it changed everything.

801
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:30,865
Doesn't feel like it changed anything.

802
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:34,323
The Matrix is the same or worse.

803
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:37,167
And I'm back where I started.

804
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:42,380
It feels like everything I did,

805
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:44,924
everything we did...

806
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:53,141
like none of it mattered.

807
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,020
All of it mattered.

808
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:00,273
I can show you.

809
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:12,532
This is my crew.

810
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,832
Our operator, Seq.

811
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:23,547
Sequoia. But everybody calls me Seq.

812
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,461
Nice to meet you.

813
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,084
Dad loved redwoods.

814
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:31,589
When he escaped the Matrix
and found out they no longer existed,

815
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:32,764
it almost killed him.

816
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,387
Lucky he met Mom,

817
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:36,393
and here I am.

818
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:40,689
This is Lexy, Berg and Ellster.

819
01:03:41,443 --> 01:03:42,604
Hi.

820
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:45,269
You knew my grandfather, Captain Roland.

821
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:47,779
Roland was your grandfather?

822
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:50,776
He always laughed,
joking how he never believed in you.

823
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:55,029
But, in private, he said
that you freed his mind a second time.

824
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,747
Uh, not to fanboy out here,

825
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,745
but this is kind of
a huge moment for me.

826
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,785
Berg is our resident Neo-ologist.

827
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:03,625
A what?

828
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:06,836
There's a lot of people
out there like me

829
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:09,133
who are a little bit obsessed
with your life.

830
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:11,741
I would never have recognized your Modal
if it weren't for him.

831
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:14,974
Whenever you're feeling up for it,
I've got, like, a million questions.

832
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:17,475
Me too. Starting with them.

833
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:19,855
It's okay.

834
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:21,648
Come meet him.

835
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:23,189
This is Cybebe.

836
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,771
That's Octacles.

837
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,935
That's Lumin8.

838
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,813
Machines are on our side now?

839
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:32,949
They are synthients.
It's a word they prefer to Machines.

840
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:36,453
Your contact with the Synthient City
had a huge impact on their world.

841
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:37,995
That's what I meant.

842
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:40,954
What you changed that nobody believed
could ever be changed.

843
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:45,120
The meaning of "our side."

844
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:52,257
Cybebe and Octacles risked their lives
to help get you out.

845
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:54,723
Thank you.

846
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:57,267
But why?

847
01:04:57,352 --> 01:04:59,093
Not all seek to control.

848
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,012
Just as not all wish to be free.

849
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:04,939
What is that?

850
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:07,522
An exomorphic-particle codex.
It's pretty new.

851
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:10,778
It gives programs access to this world.
Within limits.

852
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:13,941
Limits are the domain of the limited.

853
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:15,200
Morpheus.

854
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:16,745
Thank you.

855
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,278
It was my honor.

856
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,406
Wow.

857
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:22,728
How does it work?

858
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,117
Paramagnetic oscillation.

859
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:26,662
If you want,
I can download the codex manual for you.

860
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,081
- Sure.
- Downloading used to be fun.

861
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:31,375
Now it's all manuals and diagnostics.

862
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:33,502
Can I ask them something?

863
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:39,554
When you unplugged me,
there was another pod?

864
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:43,888
Yes. We've analyzed the data.

865
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:46,436
It could be Trinity.

866
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:48,524
It's her.

867
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:51,566
I figured we were going to
have this conversation.

868
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:55,149
Look, you were not
a typical flush-and-grab.

869
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,738
You were in this weird tower
that Cybebe had never accessed,

870
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:58,990
and she's now exiled.

871
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:01,201
We burned our one shot for you.

872
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:03,686
Even if it were Trinity
and she wanted to be free,

873
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,576
we have no idea how to do it.

874
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:06,753
Yet.

875
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,547
Nobody believed we'd ever find him,

876
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:13,177
but we did.

877
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:16,712
Okay.

878
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:20,723
We don't know how to get her out... yet.

879
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,437
Captain, we're approaching
security clearance.

880
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:27,774
We're here.

881
01:06:28,026 --> 01:06:29,026
Zion?

882
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:38,275
Have a seat.

883
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:41,403
This is Hanno. Best pilot in our fleet.

884
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:43,913
Quite a few synthients
deserve that title before me.

885
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,769
Mnemosyne, <i>you are cleared for landing.</i>

886
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:46,793
<i>Welcome home.</i>

887
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:48,460
Thank you, Control.

888
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:50,120
Um, we're about to crash.

889
01:06:57,138 --> 01:07:00,506
General realized we were never going to
beat the Sentinels,

890
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,640
so we just got better at
hiding from them.

891
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:08,809
Welcome to Io.

892
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:11,558
Io.

893
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:21,030
Wow. That looks real.

894
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,120
Bio-sky.

895
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:28,541
Works kind of like grow lights.

896
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:30,911
It's way more complex than that.

897
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:33,456
It pulls water from the crust,
hydronating the air.

898
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:36,751
It balances the ECO and our SRI cycles.

899
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,173
Plus...

900
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,763
It is pretty to look at.

901
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,674
As opposed to that.

902
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:47,556
I guess the general
sent us a welcome party.

903
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:07,243
God damn.

904
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:09,537
It is you.

905
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,581
Niobe?

906
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:16,332
A few more wrinkles
and a few less teeth,

907
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:20,840
but wise enough to know
I don't know anything.

908
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:23,506
I sure as shit never saw this coming.

909
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:25,473
Neither did I.

910
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:26,758
I told you he was alive.

911
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,052
Captain, you and your crew
have been grounded.

912
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:30,666
General, if you'd just let me explain.

913
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:33,478
The protocols are put in place
for everyone's protection.

914
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:36,939
I'm sorry. I saw an opportunity
and I was afraid we'd lose him.

915
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,650
But, General,
people have been waiting for so long.

916
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,573
We found The One.

917
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,111
I don't believe in The One.

918
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:49,497
I never did.

919
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:51,249
No?

920
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:53,709
Me neither.

921
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:58,587
But there was a time
when you trusted me with your ship,

922
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:01,009
against the Council's orders.

923
01:09:01,179 --> 01:09:03,136
The world was different then.

924
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:06,594
We were different.

925
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:10,059
Report to the docks.

926
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:11,845
Scrub down the <i>Mnemosyne.</i>

927
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:14,185
Transfer your access codes.

928
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:15,770
You are done, Captain.

929
01:09:25,453 --> 01:09:27,239
We need to talk.

930
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,705
When word first came,

931
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:37,454
that it actually might be you,

932
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:45,011
I didn't know how I would feel
in this moment.

933
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,937
It is nice to see you.

934
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:57,645
It's good to see you too.

935
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:06,362
A long way from Dozer's paint stripper.

936
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,864
Yes.

937
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:11,158
A lot has changed.

938
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:14,616
Except maybe you.

939
01:10:17,505 --> 01:10:18,961
You remember this?

940
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:30,762
It's so easy to forget how much noise
the Matrix pumps into your head

941
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:32,300
until you unplug.

942
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:35,182
Yeah.

943
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:38,557
Something else
makes the same kind of noise.

944
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:40,817
Takes over every damn thing

945
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:42,603
just like the Matrix.

946
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:45,282
War.

947
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,618
I stood at the barricade of the Temple.

948
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:53,697
Staring at the army of Sentinels,

949
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:57,451
waiting for them to Kill
every one of us.

950
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:01,997
But then, they left.

951
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:05,633
They said you saved us.

952
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:07,009
I didn't believe it.

953
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:10,343
Every night I would dream
of attack sirens.

954
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:12,257
But then,

955
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:17,053
I would wake up to this...

956
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:22,524
silence.

957
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:27,655
I'm ashamed of it now.

958
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:31,693
My pessimism
of how long it took me to believe

959
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:34,954
a world without war was possible.

960
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:37,953
You gave me that.

961
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:40,876
You gave that gift to us all.

962
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:45,090
And it is the gift
that continues to bear fruit.

963
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:49,548
Come help me get up.

964
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:51,338
Let's take a walk.

965
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,497
Oh! Beautiful.

966
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:21,667
This is Freya, head of botany.

967
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:24,830
And this is Quillion,
our lead digitologist.

968
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:29,088
I presume
our guest needs no introduction.

969
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:31,720
Nothing travels faster than light.

970
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:33,129
Except gossip.

971
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,891
Welcome to the Garden, Neo.

972
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,186
A strawberry?

973
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:44,350
Using digital code from the Matrix,
we retro-convert it into DNA sequences.

974
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:45,983
And they grow here?

975
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:50,317
It's not easy augmenting the genome
to photosynthesize Bio-sky, but...

976
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:52,073
We're getting there.

977
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,530
Go ahead. Try it.

978
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:04,327
We're quite excited
about the blueberries.

979
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:06,291
You remember that shit we used to eat?

980
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:08,706
That slop that tasted like rust.

981
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:13,845
Zion could have never
made something like this.

982
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:15,346
Why?

983
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:18,049
Because we needed synthients

984
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:20,473
and DI like him.

985
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:23,855
Zion was stuck in the past.
Stuck in war.

986
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:26,062
Stuck in a Matrix of its own.

987
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:30,233
They believed
that it had to be us or them.

988
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:35,070
This city was built
by us and them.

989
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,415
What happened to Zion?

990
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:45,794
I've been waiting
for you to ask that question.

991
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:51,341
All of the troubles
started in the Machine Cities.

992
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:54,753
Power plants were unable
to produce enough energy.

993
01:13:55,306 --> 01:13:58,844
Nothing can breed violence
like scarcity.

994
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:02,261
For the first time,

995
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:05,476
<i>we saw machines at war with one another.</i>

996
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:12,479
We got word from the Oracle
of a new power rising.

997
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:17,109
That was the last we heard from her.

998
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:21,992
Morpheus.

999
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:26,626
After the siege,
he was elected unanimously.

1000
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:28,787
High Chair of the Council.

1001
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:32,791
Oh, how he loved that.

1002
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:37,338
But as rumors of this new power spread,

1003
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:38,721
he ignored them.

1004
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:43,260
He was certain what you had done
could not be undone.

1005
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:47,602
All of these people
never stopped believing in miracles,

1006
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:50,107
believing in you.

1007
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:03,537
I'm sorry.

1008
01:15:05,543 --> 01:15:07,910
How could I know this would happen?

1009
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:10,169
We didn't understand
all of it back then.

1010
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:11,955
No more than we do now.

1011
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:15,466
I didn't come here
to cause you problems, Niobe,

1012
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:18,256
but I need your help.

1013
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:21,430
Trinity is alive.

1014
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,216
Then there is another question.

1015
01:15:23,394 --> 01:15:25,055
Why did they keep her alive?

1016
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:26,435
I can't answer that.

1017
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:29,814
But if there's a chance I can free her,

1018
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:31,645
I have to try.

1019
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:35,483
Even if it means
endangering everyone in this city?

1020
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:41,116
I'm sorry, Neo.

1021
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:45,205
I won't let what happened to Zion
happen to Io.

1022
01:15:47,168 --> 01:15:50,832
I hope you'll forgive an old woman
for asking you to go with Sheperd here,

1023
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:54,255
till we have better understanding
of what's going on.

1024
01:15:54,925 --> 01:15:57,758
You're going to imprison me
after I just got free?

1025
01:15:57,928 --> 01:16:00,795
I know it doesn't seem fair,

1026
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,798
but neither does growing old.

1027
01:16:04,769 --> 01:16:06,726
But you don't hear me complaining.

1028
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:19,822
Sorry.

1029
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:22,696
I've never met a legend before.

1030
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:27,163
Neo.

1031
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:29,665
Sheperd.

1032
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:33,415
Crazy. You're real.

1033
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:36,497
"Real."

1034
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:39,592
There's that word again.

1035
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:47,149
People talk a lot
about the old days.

1036
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:49,761
About you, the viral Agent.

1037
01:16:49,939 --> 01:16:51,555
The siege of Zion.

1038
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:54,607
Everything was simpler back then.

1039
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:57,184
People wanted to be free.

1040
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:00,609
It's different now.

1041
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:04,738
Sometimes it feels like people gave up.

1042
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,161
Like the Matrix won.

1043
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:11,908
This is you.

1044
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:18,213
And I gotta ask you one thing.

1045
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:21,960
Is it true you could fly?

1046
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:27,809
Cool.

1047
01:17:58,382 --> 01:17:59,463
Morpheus.

1048
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:02,633
Oh. General stuck you
in the Rapunzel tower.

1049
01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:06,712
On the upside, it's a nice view.

1050
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:08,928
What happened to Bugs and the others?

1051
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:11,809
They're supposed to be sterilizing
the <i>Mnemosyne</i> with a toothbrush.

1052
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:12,896
"Supposed to be"?

1053
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:14,416
Well, I could tell you
that they're standing by,

1054
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:17,558
waiting for you to make the choice
to remain meekly incarcerated

1055
01:18:17,735 --> 01:18:19,851
or bust the hell out of here
and go and find Trinity.

1056
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:22,530
But that ain't a choice.

1057
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:37,293
General, what should we do?

1058
01:18:40,925 --> 01:18:43,383
Bugs has the same
independence of mind

1059
01:18:43,469 --> 01:18:44,925
she had the day you freed her.

1060
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:47,883
This is not independence of mind.

1061
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:49,057
It's mutiny.

1062
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:51,476
Come on, 'Be.

1063
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:54,807
I know how much you hated
locking him up.

1064
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:57,597
Just like I know there's a part of you

1065
01:18:57,775 --> 01:19:00,642
that's relieved now that he's gone.

1066
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:05,943
We've worked so hard to keep Io safe.

1067
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:10,326
This scares me.

1068
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:22,163
That's her.

1069
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:23,376
On the bridge.

1070
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:24,919
Got her.

1071
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:35,934
It's sick how the Semblance works.

1072
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:37,595
You see flashes of the real her,

1073
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:40,390
but the way she reads...

1074
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:44,736
Code-wise, she's pure bluepill.

1075
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:49,691
This is a tough question, Neo,
but it has to be asked.

1076
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:52,986
What if she's happy where she is?

1077
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:55,701
How did I read?

1078
01:19:57,835 --> 01:19:59,701
Exactly like her.

1079
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:05,251
Take us to broadcast depth.

1080
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:18,469
Thank you for helping me.

1081
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:22,106
Most of us are here because of you.

1082
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:27,445
I also admit our only chance
to get out of the general's doghouse

1083
01:20:27,614 --> 01:20:29,104
is for you to find your mojo.

1084
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:33,409
What if I can't be what I once was?

1085
01:20:35,122 --> 01:20:36,683
Then we're all fucked.

1086
01:20:36,707 --> 01:20:38,038
Two minutes.

1087
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:39,494
Two minutes to broadcast.

1088
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:50,366
I slipped you in
through a hotel room.

1089
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:53,295
Should be safe.

1090
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:05,266
Portal's open.

1091
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:07,684
Closest I could get you
is the warehouse near her garage.

1092
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:09,437
Whole zone's crawling with bots.

1093
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:12,360
Let's go.

1094
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:41,344
So, what do you think of him?

1095
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:45,602
I was kinda worried at first
because he's so much older.

1096
01:21:45,776 --> 01:21:48,313
The beard, the hair... Oh.

1097
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:51,104
- No, totally works for me.
- You idiot.

1098
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:53,151
I mean "The One" thing.

1099
01:21:55,035 --> 01:21:57,402
You know, everyone that
shipped with him died.

1100
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,663
Oh, yeah. He's gonna
get us all killed for sure.

1101
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:07,578
Predictable as ever.

1102
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:11,207
Smith.

1103
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,671
Smith? As in, <i>the</i> Smith?

1104
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:23,310
This is so insane.

1105
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:24,874
There's so many theories
about the two of them

1106
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:26,514
and they're standing right there.

1107
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:28,228
This code is freaky.

1108
01:22:28,402 --> 01:22:31,144
He's like an Agent, but not.

1109
01:22:35,409 --> 01:22:36,899
An appeal to reason.

1110
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:42,696
How did you find us?

1111
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:44,991
You never appreciated our relationship.

1112
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:47,125
Not like The Analyst.

1113
01:22:47,296 --> 01:22:49,207
- The what?
- My doctor.

1114
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:52,999
He used our bond
and turned it into a chain.

1115
01:22:53,177 --> 01:22:54,737
It's so obvious once you see it, right?

1116
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:57,636
But this whole altered-code update
really blew my mind.

1117
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:00,222
I still don't know how he did it.

1118
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,599
You, as a balding nerd.

1119
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:04,434
Hilarious.

1120
01:23:05,063 --> 01:23:06,895
And me...

1121
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:09,356
Even more perfect.

1122
01:23:10,444 --> 01:23:12,338
Maybe a little too far
on the piercing blue eyes.

1123
01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:13,602
What do you think?

1124
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,272
What do you want, Smith?

1125
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:22,112
I have such dreams, Tom. Big dreams.

1126
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:25,456
Well, mostly just extremely violent
revenge fantasies,

1127
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:26,853
but in order for me to pursue mine,

1128
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:29,084
I need to dissuade you
from pursuing yours.

1129
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:32,709
Hmm. Sounds like conflict.

1130
01:23:34,468 --> 01:23:35,958
Inevitable?

1131
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:38,593
Doesn't have to be.

1132
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:40,880
All you have to do
is stay out of the Matrix,

1133
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:42,430
and leave the good doctor to me.

1134
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:44,717
You can have him. I'm here for Trinity.

1135
01:23:44,895 --> 01:23:46,431
That's the trouble, Tom.

1136
01:23:46,605 --> 01:23:48,846
He knew you'd come, just like I did.

1137
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:52,065
Trust me.

1138
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:54,442
You're not ready for him.

1139
01:23:54,613 --> 01:23:57,446
Captain, I'm reading portals
from the lower frequencies.

1140
01:24:02,913 --> 01:24:05,905
I won't have his leash on my neck again.

1141
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:15,627
I found some old acquaintances of yours.

1142
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:20,048
Bugs!

1143
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:34,812
Exiles.

1144
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:36,130
I thought they were all purged.

1145
01:24:36,154 --> 01:24:37,235
You?

1146
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:38,854
Oh!

1147
01:24:38,949 --> 01:24:40,906
It is you!

1148
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:46,162
All these years. I can't believe it.

1149
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:48,448
Oh, God.

1150
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:52,493
You stole my life!

1151
01:24:57,509 --> 01:24:58,987
What the Merv
is trying to say is that

1152
01:24:59,011 --> 01:25:01,469
their situation
is a little bit like mine.

1153
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:03,675
To have their lives back,
yours has to end.

1154
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:08,352
Kill him!

1155
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:27,286
You ruined every
suck-my-silky-ass thing!

1156
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:29,993
We had grace.

1157
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:36,578
We had style!

1158
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:38,748
We had conversation!

1159
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:40,757
Not this...

1160
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:08,778
Art, films, books were all better!

1161
01:26:08,955 --> 01:26:12,118
Originality mattered!

1162
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:14,158
You gave us Face-Zucker-suck

1163
01:26:14,336 --> 01:26:17,624
and
Couch-flix-climatey-Wiki-piss-and-shit!

1164
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:05,334
I still know kung fu.

1165
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:08,222
Neo!

1166
01:27:38,003 --> 01:27:39,414
Just like old times.

1167
01:28:37,062 --> 01:28:38,097
Neo.

1168
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:42,181
I've been thinking about us, Tom.

1169
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:46,067
About binaries that form
the nature of things.

1170
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:48,645
Ones and zeros.

1171
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:50,943
Light and dark.

1172
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:55,152
Choice and its absence.

1173
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,745
Anderson and Smith.

1174
01:29:37,497 --> 01:29:39,579
You've lost something, Tom.

1175
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:45,373
You're not what you used to be.

1176
01:29:46,673 --> 01:29:47,708
It's true.

1177
01:30:01,146 --> 01:30:03,057
- Nice one.
- Thanks.

1178
01:30:10,947 --> 01:30:12,108
Come on, Neo.

1179
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:39,222
Captain. You okay?

1180
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:42,009
Yeah. Where's Neo?

1181
01:30:42,812 --> 01:30:43,847
Smith is killing him.

1182
01:30:44,022 --> 01:30:45,183
Where?

1183
01:30:52,948 --> 01:30:54,859
I feel bad about this, Tom.

1184
01:30:57,661 --> 01:30:59,572
After all,
you are the one who set me free...

1185
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:01,872
again.

1186
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,708
So you, more than anyone,
understands why I can't go back.

1187
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:11,080
You should have listened to me.

1188
01:31:13,426 --> 01:31:15,042
Now you'll never see her again.

1189
01:31:28,692 --> 01:31:29,773
What was that?

1190
01:31:29,943 --> 01:31:31,274
That was Neo.

1191
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:33,981
Mojo rising.

1192
01:31:42,038 --> 01:31:43,324
You all right?

1193
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:44,498
Yeah.

1194
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:47,648
- It's gonna trigger a response.
- I got multiple exits ready.

1195
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:49,271
This is not over yet!

1196
01:31:49,295 --> 01:31:51,787
Our sequel franchise spinoff!

1197
01:31:59,014 --> 01:32:00,254
We should go.

1198
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:01,593
I can't.

1199
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:03,677
I have to talk to her.

1200
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:07,095
Neo, those Exiles were older than you,
and we barely handled them.

1201
01:32:10,775 --> 01:32:12,231
You really wanna do this now?

1202
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:18,863
I mean...

1203
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,277
you look like shit.

1204
01:32:35,842 --> 01:32:38,209
Oh, my God. What? What happened?

1205
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:39,467
An accident.

1206
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:41,844
Kush. Call a doctor.

1207
01:32:42,015 --> 01:32:43,505
It's fine.

1208
01:32:44,517 --> 01:32:46,133
I don't have a lot of time.

1209
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:48,393
I wasn't sure I'd see you again.

1210
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:51,021
After we spoke, I realized

1211
01:32:51,941 --> 01:32:53,932
my life wasn't a life.

1212
01:32:55,528 --> 01:33:00,489
At some point, I think I gave up
searching for something real.

1213
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:08,117
Wait.

1214
01:33:09,667 --> 01:33:11,283
Something happened.

1215
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:14,627
I looked for you at the coffee shop.

1216
01:33:16,549 --> 01:33:18,756
I began to wonder if I imagined you.

1217
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:22,086
And then last night I had a dream.

1218
01:33:23,223 --> 01:33:25,339
<i>In the dream,
you were surrounded by police,</i>

1219
01:33:25,517 --> 01:33:27,053
then they started chasing us.

1220
01:33:28,228 --> 01:33:31,061
- Us?
- You were on my bike with me.

1221
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:34,605
How did it end?

1222
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:37,188
Not good.

1223
01:33:39,906 --> 01:33:43,194
I've had dreams
that weren't just dreams.

1224
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:45,484
You mean a dream that came true?

1225
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:55,794
Finally, we can talk like adults.

1226
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:00,590
I hate lying. I do.
It exhausts me.

1227
01:34:02,554 --> 01:34:05,888
Tiff and I have been waiting for you,
like, forever.

1228
01:34:12,939 --> 01:34:14,179
Déjà vu, right?

1229
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:18,267
Oh, no use. You can't beat time.

1230
01:34:18,444 --> 01:34:21,937
This rewind is happening
faster than you can blink.

1231
01:34:26,911 --> 01:34:28,822
You gave me the idea.

1232
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:34,951
Allow me to sum up our goal
in a single word.

1233
01:34:38,047 --> 01:34:39,082
"Bullet time."

1234
01:34:41,050 --> 01:34:43,087
I know. Kind of ironic,

1235
01:34:43,261 --> 01:34:46,799
using the power that defined you
to control you.

1236
01:34:47,098 --> 01:34:49,681
I kept such a close eye on you

1237
01:34:49,851 --> 01:34:51,467
and, still, you found a way out.

1238
01:34:52,478 --> 01:34:54,719
Clever monkey, using that Modal.

1239
01:34:55,773 --> 01:34:58,014
Call me an optimist,
but this could all be for the best.

1240
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:01,772
The skin's not looking
too bad this time.

1241
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:04,775
I know some of this
will be difficult for you to hear,

1242
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:06,314
after everything you went through.

1243
01:35:06,492 --> 01:35:07,698
All that pain and suffering,

1244
01:35:07,869 --> 01:35:10,657
only to learn
the world doesn't end when you do.

1245
01:35:12,207 --> 01:35:13,288
Surprise.

1246
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:20,745
I was there when you died.

1247
01:35:23,259 --> 01:35:27,719
I said to myself,
"Here is the anomaly of anomalies."

1248
01:35:27,889 --> 01:35:30,506
What an extraordinary opportunity.

1249
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:35,143
First, I had to convince the Suits
to let me rebuild the two of you.

1250
01:35:35,313 --> 01:35:38,556
Why her? Getting there.
And don't worry, she can't hear me.

1251
01:35:38,983 --> 01:35:41,896
Resurrecting you both
was crazy expensive.

1252
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:43,435
Like renovating a house.

1253
01:35:43,613 --> 01:35:45,650
Took twice as long, cost twice as much.

1254
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:52,194
I thought you'd be happy
to be alive again.

1255
01:35:53,248 --> 01:35:54,613
So wrong.

1256
01:35:56,376 --> 01:35:59,960
Did you know hope and despair
are nearly identical in code?

1257
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:03,997
We worked for years

1258
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:05,711
<i>trying to activate your source code.</i>

1259
01:36:05,885 --> 01:36:09,094
I was about to give up,
when I realized...

1260
01:36:12,183 --> 01:36:13,218
Trinity.

1261
01:36:13,393 --> 01:36:15,600
It was never just you.

1262
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:18,432
Alone, neither of you
is of any particular value.

1263
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:23,559
Like acids and bases,
you're dangerous when mixed together.

1264
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:26,357
Every sim where you two bonded,

1265
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:29,197
let's just say bad things happened.

1266
01:36:31,244 --> 01:36:32,700
Neo!

1267
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:40,284
However, as long as I managed
to keep you close,

1268
01:36:40,461 --> 01:36:42,168
but not too close,

1269
01:36:42,338 --> 01:36:44,579
I discovered something incredible.

1270
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:49,092
Now, my predecessor loved precision.

1271
01:36:49,262 --> 01:36:52,675
His Matrix was all fussy facts
and equations.

1272
01:36:52,849 --> 01:36:54,590
He hated the human mind.

1273
01:36:54,767 --> 01:36:57,454
So he never bothered to realize
that you don't give a shit about facts.

1274
01:36:57,478 --> 01:36:58,889
It's all about fiction.

1275
01:36:59,063 --> 01:37:03,022
The only world that matters
is the one in here.

1276
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:06,648
And you people believe
the craziest shit.

1277
01:37:07,196 --> 01:37:08,196
Why?

1278
01:37:08,364 --> 01:37:11,106
What validates
and makes your fictions real?

1279
01:37:12,076 --> 01:37:13,157
Feelings.

1280
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:15,781
Allow me.

1281
01:37:17,290 --> 01:37:18,826
Kush here is one of my handlers.

1282
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,240
They're everywhere.

1283
01:37:20,418 --> 01:37:23,080
Such a pain,
cloning Agents over a coppertop.

1284
01:37:23,254 --> 01:37:25,461
Far more effective
just to saturate a population.

1285
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:30,292
And, bonus, swarm mode is sick fun.

1286
01:37:42,732 --> 01:37:45,815
Ooh! Nicely done.

1287
01:37:47,445 --> 01:37:50,107
You ever wonder why you have nightmares?

1288
01:37:50,782 --> 01:37:53,365
Why your own brain tortures you?

1289
01:37:53,826 --> 01:37:56,614
It's actually us,
maximizing your output.

1290
01:37:57,330 --> 01:37:58,445
It works just like this.

1291
01:37:58,623 --> 01:38:01,160
Oh, no. Can you stop the bullet?

1292
01:38:01,334 --> 01:38:04,326
If only you could move faster.

1293
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:06,878
Here's the thing about feelings.

1294
01:38:07,048 --> 01:38:09,130
They're so much easier to control
than facts.

1295
01:38:10,176 --> 01:38:12,087
Turns out, in my Matrix,

1296
01:38:12,261 --> 01:38:15,549
the worse we treat you,
the more we manipulate you,

1297
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:18,055
the more energy you produce.

1298
01:38:18,226 --> 01:38:19,808
It's nuts.

1299
01:38:20,603 --> 01:38:23,470
I've been setting productivity records
every year since I took over.

1300
01:38:23,648 --> 01:38:26,310
And, the best part, zero resistance.

1301
01:38:26,484 --> 01:38:27,770
People stay in their pods,

1302
01:38:27,944 --> 01:38:30,311
happier than pigs in shit.

1303
01:38:31,072 --> 01:38:32,153
The key to it all?

1304
01:38:32,323 --> 01:38:33,563
You.

1305
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:34,981
And her.

1306
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:37,366
Quietly yearning
for what you don't have,

1307
01:38:37,453 --> 01:38:39,410
while dreading losing what you do.

1308
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:43,911
For 99.9% of your race,
that is the definition of reality.

1309
01:38:44,377 --> 01:38:46,334
Desire and fear, baby.

1310
01:38:47,463 --> 01:38:50,205
Just give the people
what they want, right?

1311
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:02,392
She's the only home you have, Thomas.

1312
01:39:02,854 --> 01:39:06,017
Come home
before something terrible happens.

1313
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:17,451
- Bugs!
- I hear him.

1314
01:39:24,041 --> 01:39:25,041
Trinity!

1315
01:39:25,126 --> 01:39:26,992
- You shouldn't call me that.
- I'm sorry.

1316
01:39:28,546 --> 01:39:29,707
I have to go.

1317
01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:30,996
But I'll be back.

1318
01:39:32,175 --> 01:39:34,416
Neo! Time to go.

1319
01:39:37,013 --> 01:39:38,469
- Sentinels?
- Worse.

1320
01:39:40,266 --> 01:39:42,411
<i>General ordered me
to look after the ship.</i>

1321
01:39:42,435 --> 01:39:43,435
So you shadowed us?

1322
01:39:44,437 --> 01:39:45,927
Check your long-range scans.

1323
01:39:46,105 --> 01:39:47,937
<i>Squids are combing this area.</i>

1324
01:39:48,107 --> 01:39:49,188
He's right.

1325
01:39:49,692 --> 01:39:52,730
You can stay here and die,
or come back and face a court-martial.

1326
01:39:53,404 --> 01:39:55,315
And you call that a choice?

1327
01:40:02,788 --> 01:40:04,825
Sheperd should have left you
to the Squids.

1328
01:40:04,999 --> 01:40:08,117
I'm too damn old
to sit through some boring-ass trial.

1329
01:40:08,294 --> 01:40:09,409
Niobe, don't blame Bugs.

1330
01:40:09,587 --> 01:40:11,123
Do shut your mouth.

1331
01:40:11,589 --> 01:40:13,921
Do address me as General.

1332
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:18,210
And do not rob my ex-captain
of her agency,

1333
01:40:18,387 --> 01:40:20,378
which she exercised with her own

1334
01:40:20,473 --> 01:40:23,807
particular brand
of shortsighted stupidity.

1335
01:40:25,102 --> 01:40:26,137
Shortsighted?

1336
01:40:28,064 --> 01:40:31,853
You care more about growing fruit
than freeing minds.

1337
01:40:32,026 --> 01:40:34,438
We are not going
to have this argument again.

1338
01:40:34,612 --> 01:40:36,444
It's not an argument. It's a fact.

1339
01:40:36,948 --> 01:40:38,063
You gave up on people.

1340
01:40:39,700 --> 01:40:41,907
I tell you what I'm going to give up on,

1341
01:40:41,994 --> 01:40:43,029
and it's you!

1342
01:40:45,581 --> 01:40:48,573
- Sheperd, get her out of my sight.
- General.

1343
01:40:50,503 --> 01:40:51,538
Disarm!

1344
01:40:51,712 --> 01:40:53,294
Kujaku's a friend.

1345
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:01,377
Hello, friend.

1346
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:05,058
Okay.

1347
01:41:06,394 --> 01:41:07,600
Him?

1348
01:41:14,527 --> 01:41:15,858
General.

1349
01:41:16,362 --> 01:41:17,602
Thank you for seeing me.

1350
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:21,774
I figured if there was anyone
who could make sense of this mess,

1351
01:41:21,951 --> 01:41:23,658
it would be you.

1352
01:41:23,828 --> 01:41:24,863
Hello, Neo.

1353
01:41:25,037 --> 01:41:26,493
I know you.

1354
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:28,905
I tried to keep my eye on you.

1355
01:41:32,253 --> 01:41:33,493
Why?

1356
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:35,332
We met a long time ago.

1357
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:38,126
Good morning.

1358
01:41:40,970 --> 01:41:41,970
Sati.

1359
01:41:42,138 --> 01:41:44,175
My father knew we'd meet again,

1360
01:41:44,849 --> 01:41:46,969
though he would have wished
for happier circumstances.

1361
01:41:47,852 --> 01:41:49,572
His inadvertent role
in what happened to you

1362
01:41:49,687 --> 01:41:51,769
was the greatest regret of his life.

1363
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:53,725
I don't understand.

1364
01:41:55,234 --> 01:41:58,067
My father was the chief engineer
at the Anomaleum.

1365
01:41:58,237 --> 01:41:59,693
The what?

1366
01:41:59,864 --> 01:42:02,481
My father designed the resurrection pods

1367
01:42:02,992 --> 01:42:04,733
where Neo and Trinity were imprisoned.

1368
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:07,829
I'm sorry.

1369
01:42:08,247 --> 01:42:09,737
You knew what happened to him?

1370
01:42:09,915 --> 01:42:12,907
You knew that he and Trinity
both were alive,

1371
01:42:14,003 --> 01:42:15,334
and you didn't tell me?

1372
01:42:15,504 --> 01:42:18,166
There were times
I doubted my decision, Niobe.

1373
01:42:18,341 --> 01:42:19,957
But Io needed you.

1374
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:23,468
This city needed to be built
for your people as well as mine.

1375
01:42:24,805 --> 01:42:26,261
If I would have told you everything,

1376
01:42:26,682 --> 01:42:28,682
you would have had
a very difficult choice to make.

1377
01:42:28,768 --> 01:42:30,304
My friends

1378
01:42:31,729 --> 01:42:33,891
let me make my own choices.

1379
01:42:34,315 --> 01:42:36,181
If it was a mistake,

1380
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:38,316
you have my deepest apologies.

1381
01:42:40,488 --> 01:42:41,774
Why are you here now?

1382
01:42:41,947 --> 01:42:44,359
Neo's escape
has destabilized the Matrix.

1383
01:42:44,533 --> 01:42:47,025
The Anomaleum draws its current
from Trinity alone now.

1384
01:42:47,328 --> 01:42:51,287
A fail-safe has been triggered to reset
the Matrix back to the previous version.

1385
01:42:51,624 --> 01:42:53,331
But The Analyst halted the reset.

1386
01:42:53,501 --> 01:42:56,710
He's convinced the authorities
that you will soon return voluntarily.

1387
01:42:57,963 --> 01:42:59,328
And why would he say that?

1388
01:43:00,091 --> 01:43:02,924
Because if I don't go back,
he'll kill Trinity.

1389
01:43:05,846 --> 01:43:08,133
Faced with returning to your pod

1390
01:43:08,307 --> 01:43:10,344
or enduring Trinity's death again.

1391
01:43:11,102 --> 01:43:12,308
What would you choose, Neo?

1392
01:43:13,437 --> 01:43:14,677
I'll go back.

1393
01:43:16,565 --> 01:43:18,727
Well, The Analyst knows you well,

1394
01:43:18,901 --> 01:43:21,393
but that knowledge
has made him incautious.

1395
01:43:21,570 --> 01:43:22,605
After you escaped,

1396
01:43:22,697 --> 01:43:25,655
he should have accepted his losses
and devacuated Trinity.

1397
01:43:26,492 --> 01:43:29,075
But that would have prevented
this extraordinary opportunity

1398
01:43:29,245 --> 01:43:31,077
that now exists before us.

1399
01:43:31,789 --> 01:43:33,621
A few hours ago,

1400
01:43:34,959 --> 01:43:38,202
no one would have been able
to convince me

1401
01:43:38,379 --> 01:43:42,418
that I would be standing here,
trying to explain a mission

1402
01:43:42,591 --> 01:43:44,457
as crazy as this one.

1403
01:43:48,347 --> 01:43:49,883
What are you doing?

1404
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:51,639
- Volunteering.
- Oh, no.

1405
01:43:51,809 --> 01:43:56,053
You are the one captain
that I am ordering to go.

1406
01:43:56,397 --> 01:43:59,560
Now you don't have to order me,
General, 'cause I'm volunteering.

1407
01:44:02,987 --> 01:44:04,477
I need two more.

1408
01:44:09,076 --> 01:44:11,363
Are you out of your minds?

1409
01:44:12,037 --> 01:44:13,778
You don't even know what it is.

1410
01:44:13,956 --> 01:44:16,288
General, we know you.

1411
01:44:16,959 --> 01:44:20,202
If you say this is important,
none of us is choosing to stay home.

1412
01:44:25,634 --> 01:44:26,669
Thank you.

1413
01:44:31,849 --> 01:44:33,760
Knuckle up and good luck.

1414
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:07,298
Trinity is held in the Anomaleum,
which is in this transmission tower.

1415
01:45:07,468 --> 01:45:09,630
<i>The passages used to rescue Neo
are now sealed</i>

1416
01:45:09,804 --> 01:45:11,795
<i>and a legion of Sentinels
patrols the tower.</i>

1417
01:45:11,972 --> 01:45:13,929
So stealth will be paramount.

1418
01:45:14,099 --> 01:45:15,840
As long as we raise no alarms,

1419
01:45:16,018 --> 01:45:18,079
this first part of the mission
should be the easiest.

1420
01:45:18,103 --> 01:45:21,095
You mean crossing the Fetus Fields,
sneaking across an entire power plant,

1421
01:45:21,273 --> 01:45:24,516
climbing a two-kilometer tower
guarded by thousands of Sentinels?

1422
01:45:24,652 --> 01:45:25,687
That's the easy part?

1423
01:45:25,861 --> 01:45:27,101
Exactly so.

1424
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:29,987
Because all we have to do
is convince someone

1425
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:31,656
who does this every day

1426
01:45:31,826 --> 01:45:33,112
to take one of us along.

1427
01:45:56,809 --> 01:46:00,222
Fifty meters below the Anomaleum
is a stratum of amniotic filters.

1428
01:46:00,396 --> 01:46:03,388
Hidden along this edge
is a small hexagonal vent.

1429
01:46:03,899 --> 01:46:06,982
<i>This vent feeds the air intake
into the corpuscular modifier,</i>

1430
01:46:07,152 --> 01:46:10,019
<i>which oxygenates
the bio-gel used in Neo's pod.</i>

1431
01:46:10,698 --> 01:46:11,698
I get it.

1432
01:46:11,866 --> 01:46:14,858
The exomorph
slinkies up Neo's old umbilicus.

1433
01:46:16,203 --> 01:46:17,318
What could go wrong?

1434
01:47:04,209 --> 01:47:06,746
<i>Once inside,
Morpheus will use the System Operator</i>

1435
01:47:06,921 --> 01:47:09,663
<i>to open the devacuator line
and disengage the macerators.</i>

1436
01:47:14,094 --> 01:47:15,630
In order to unplug Trinity's body,

1437
01:47:15,804 --> 01:47:17,886
while her mind
still remains connected to the Matrix,

1438
01:47:18,057 --> 01:47:20,765
I'm gonna need a second human brain
to implement the bypass.

1439
01:47:20,935 --> 01:47:22,642
And since Neo must be with The Analyst,

1440
01:47:22,811 --> 01:47:26,896
the only available mind
that's a near-enough match is yours.

1441
01:47:28,442 --> 01:47:29,442
Figures.

1442
01:47:46,919 --> 01:47:48,000
Thanks, Cybebe.

1443
01:47:56,428 --> 01:47:58,294
Does Trinity still have to
take the red pill?

1444
01:47:58,472 --> 01:48:01,152
Since Kujaku and I are transferring
her consciousness onto the ship,

1445
01:48:01,308 --> 01:48:02,924
it's not strictly necessary.

1446
01:48:03,102 --> 01:48:05,810
But what matters
is that this is her choice.

1447
01:48:07,147 --> 01:48:09,388
Extracting a confused
or an uncertain mind

1448
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:11,724
will, in all probability, kill her.

1449
01:48:11,902 --> 01:48:14,485
But even if it is what she wants,

1450
01:48:14,655 --> 01:48:17,989
won't The Analyst
just order the Sentinels to stop you?

1451
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:19,239
He will.

1452
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:21,821
But if my plan works, it won't matter.

1453
01:48:22,287 --> 01:48:23,287
Why?

1454
01:48:23,455 --> 01:48:24,945
Because we'll already be gone.

1455
01:48:26,875 --> 01:48:30,084
Somebody thinks this hard about a plan,
there has to be a reason why.

1456
01:48:32,381 --> 01:48:35,544
When my father realized
how the Anomaleum was going to be used,

1457
01:48:36,135 --> 01:48:38,877
he covertly transferred
the designs to me.

1458
01:48:39,638 --> 01:48:41,970
The Analyst discovered his betrayal,

1459
01:48:42,141 --> 01:48:43,927
and had my parents purged.

1460
01:48:46,687 --> 01:48:49,554
I would have been murdered too
if it wasn't for Kujaku.

1461
01:48:52,776 --> 01:48:55,359
Not a day goes by
that I don't grieve them.

1462
01:48:56,947 --> 01:48:59,655
I've been praying for this day
for a very long time.

1463
01:49:08,042 --> 01:49:09,453
We're coming up on broadcast.

1464
01:49:12,254 --> 01:49:16,043
I thought you should know
that I'm here because of her.

1465
01:49:19,803 --> 01:49:21,919
All I ever wanted
was to be as fearless as Trinity.

1466
01:49:24,349 --> 01:49:27,387
But I saw how she reacted in the garage,
and I...

1467
01:49:27,770 --> 01:49:29,977
You're wondering if I'm wrong.

1468
01:49:30,439 --> 01:49:31,895
What if we're too late?

1469
01:49:33,817 --> 01:49:35,399
What if she's not Trinity anymore?

1470
01:49:40,949 --> 01:49:43,566
I never believed I was The One.

1471
01:49:44,495 --> 01:49:45,860
But she did.

1472
01:49:46,955 --> 01:49:48,537
She believed in me.

1473
01:49:51,335 --> 01:49:53,417
It's my turn to believe in her.

1474
01:50:18,570 --> 01:50:20,311
This is where it gets tricky.

1475
01:50:31,667 --> 01:50:33,874
Have you ever done
an operation like this?

1476
01:50:34,586 --> 01:50:35,667
Not yet.

1477
01:50:57,442 --> 01:50:58,773
Here we go.

1478
01:51:16,420 --> 01:51:18,036
Welcome home.

1479
01:51:18,505 --> 01:51:20,712
All I want is to talk to her.

1480
01:51:20,883 --> 01:51:22,214
Do you mean Tiff?

1481
01:51:22,384 --> 01:51:25,297
Come back, and you can talk to her
as often as you like.

1482
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:28,428
I mean, handsome Chad
may have something to say about it.

1483
01:51:28,599 --> 01:51:31,682
If she tells me this is what she wants,

1484
01:51:32,895 --> 01:51:33,976
you win.

1485
01:51:34,146 --> 01:51:35,227
Really?

1486
01:51:35,397 --> 01:51:37,354
But if she wants me,

1487
01:51:38,275 --> 01:51:40,141
then you'll let us go free.

1488
01:51:40,319 --> 01:51:43,061
And why would I do something
as stupid as that?

1489
01:51:43,238 --> 01:51:45,821
Right now, I'm on a ship full of people
who will unplug me

1490
01:51:45,991 --> 01:51:48,278
before they'll let you take me back.

1491
01:51:48,994 --> 01:51:50,576
If you want this Matrix,

1492
01:51:51,121 --> 01:51:52,703
this is your only chance.

1493
01:51:52,873 --> 01:51:55,410
But how do I know
they won't unplug you anyway?

1494
01:51:55,918 --> 01:51:59,036
Same way I know
you'll let us walk out of here.

1495
01:52:24,655 --> 01:52:25,816
Okay.

1496
01:52:26,448 --> 01:52:27,904
I like tests.

1497
01:52:28,867 --> 01:52:30,403
We'll let Tiff decide.

1498
01:52:47,970 --> 01:52:49,085
That's it.

1499
01:52:50,347 --> 01:52:51,508
Bypass is ready.

1500
01:52:51,932 --> 01:52:53,263
Now what?

1501
01:52:53,725 --> 01:52:54,760
We wait.

1502
01:52:55,143 --> 01:52:57,054
Doesn't it seem crazy
to come all this way

1503
01:52:57,145 --> 01:52:58,510
and leave her here?

1504
01:52:58,897 --> 01:53:00,888
We must abide by her decision.

1505
01:53:01,608 --> 01:53:03,098
And if she says no,

1506
01:53:03,986 --> 01:53:05,351
what happens to Neo?

1507
01:53:05,529 --> 01:53:09,614
At this time,
the most important choice of Neo's life

1508
01:53:09,783 --> 01:53:11,194
is not his to make.

1509
01:53:42,316 --> 01:53:44,023
I saw this in my dream.

1510
01:53:45,652 --> 01:53:48,940
If I was the Oracle,
maybe I could explain it.

1511
01:53:49,614 --> 01:53:51,150
The Oracle.

1512
01:53:51,325 --> 01:53:52,941
From your game?

1513
01:53:54,870 --> 01:53:57,077
It's not a game.

1514
01:53:59,207 --> 01:54:00,413
Oh, God.

1515
01:54:08,008 --> 01:54:11,251
After you left, I went home

1516
01:54:11,428 --> 01:54:13,089
and I played it.

1517
01:54:15,515 --> 01:54:16,880
I kept thinking,

1518
01:54:18,226 --> 01:54:21,344
"Why does this story
feel like a memory?"

1519
01:54:28,612 --> 01:54:30,273
There's a part of me

1520
01:54:33,158 --> 01:54:36,071
that feels like I have been
waiting my whole life for you.

1521
01:54:39,122 --> 01:54:41,409
And that part is like,

1522
01:54:41,583 --> 01:54:44,245
"What the hell
took you so long?"

1523
01:54:45,253 --> 01:54:47,210
I don't have an easy answer.

1524
01:54:49,466 --> 01:54:51,548
Maybe I was afraid of this.

1525
01:54:53,095 --> 01:54:54,881
Afraid of what might happen.

1526
01:54:56,598 --> 01:54:59,386
Afraid of hurting
the only person I ever loved.

1527
01:55:01,269 --> 01:55:04,637
I wish I was who you think I am.

1528
01:55:06,066 --> 01:55:07,602
But look at me.

1529
01:55:08,985 --> 01:55:10,521
I can't be her.

1530
01:55:11,321 --> 01:55:13,278
- Mom!
- Mom! Come on.

1531
01:55:13,448 --> 01:55:14,563
- Mom!
- It's Callie.

1532
01:55:14,741 --> 01:55:15,741
Is this real?

1533
01:55:15,909 --> 01:55:16,969
You have to come with us.

1534
01:55:16,993 --> 01:55:18,137
Come on, we gotta go.

1535
01:55:18,161 --> 01:55:19,242
Tiff, hey.

1536
01:55:19,329 --> 01:55:21,349
Don't know what's going on here,
but I'm glad we found you.

1537
01:55:21,373 --> 01:55:22,934
- She got hit by a car.
- I know, it's crazy.

1538
01:55:22,958 --> 01:55:24,073
She was chasing after you.

1539
01:55:24,251 --> 01:55:25,436
They're casting her arm. We gotta go.

1540
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:26,729
Doctor said she's gonna be fine.

1541
01:55:26,753 --> 01:55:28,713
You have to come with us
to the hospital.

1542
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:29,880
It's too late.

1543
01:55:30,048 --> 01:55:31,083
I understand.

1544
01:55:31,258 --> 01:55:33,124
- Tiff, come on, let's go.
- Come on.

1545
01:55:39,683 --> 01:55:40,718
What's happening?

1546
01:55:42,853 --> 01:55:44,014
Neo was wrong.

1547
01:56:17,304 --> 01:56:18,385
Tiffany.

1548
01:56:22,100 --> 01:56:24,512
Tiffany, you have to come with us.

1549
01:56:26,229 --> 01:56:27,515
Tiffany!

1550
01:56:29,983 --> 01:56:33,476
I wish you would
fucking stop calling me that.

1551
01:56:33,653 --> 01:56:35,143
I hate that name.

1552
01:56:36,698 --> 01:56:38,280
My name is Trinity

1553
01:56:38,450 --> 01:56:40,657
and you better
take your hands off of me.

1554
01:56:51,838 --> 01:56:52,838
Neo!

1555
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:54,340
Trinity!

1556
01:56:55,550 --> 01:56:56,550
Oh, shit.

1557
01:56:57,928 --> 01:56:59,134
Get her out. Get her out!

1558
01:57:07,896 --> 01:57:10,354
Aye-yi-yi, what a mess.

1559
01:57:11,399 --> 01:57:13,936
I own that mistake.
Shouldn't have pressed.

1560
01:57:14,110 --> 01:57:16,067
Women used to be so easy to control.

1561
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:21,569
You know there's no way
I can let you two go free.

1562
01:57:25,038 --> 01:57:26,449
Cannot happen.

1563
01:57:29,793 --> 01:57:32,455
So, I guess it's déjà vu all over again.

1564
01:57:33,588 --> 01:57:34,749
She dies,

1565
01:57:35,549 --> 01:57:36,835
and it's all your fault.

1566
01:57:38,426 --> 01:57:40,963
Lies, lies and more lies.

1567
01:57:41,721 --> 01:57:42,927
Smith?

1568
01:57:43,098 --> 01:57:45,576
What has the world come to
when you can't even trust a program?

1569
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:47,967
How...

1570
01:57:49,104 --> 01:57:51,391
Tom and I have more in common
than you know.

1571
01:57:51,856 --> 01:57:54,769
Once he got out, let's just say,

1572
01:57:55,694 --> 01:57:57,401
I was free to be me.

1573
01:58:05,161 --> 01:58:07,323
- Yeah!
- Trinity?

1574
01:58:56,254 --> 01:58:57,289
You ready?

1575
01:58:57,464 --> 01:58:58,750
Yeah.

1576
01:59:40,882 --> 01:59:42,293
Oh, no.

1577
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:46,047
Destroy her. Destroy her!

1578
02:00:09,911 --> 02:00:11,197
Stop them.

1579
02:00:37,105 --> 02:00:38,516
You think this is over?

1580
02:00:38,690 --> 02:00:40,601
Lockdown. Initiate swarm.

1581
02:00:49,743 --> 02:00:51,905
Here, our unexpected alliance ends.

1582
02:00:53,747 --> 02:00:55,579
You know the difference between us, Tom?

1583
02:00:56,416 --> 02:00:57,827
Anyone could have been you.

1584
02:00:58,376 --> 02:01:00,287
Whereas I've always been anyone.

1585
02:01:05,759 --> 02:01:06,840
What just happened?

1586
02:01:07,302 --> 02:01:08,417
What?

1587
02:01:10,555 --> 02:01:12,842
Oh, no! Move! Move!

1588
02:01:13,183 --> 02:01:14,223
Get the hell out of there.

1589
02:01:18,146 --> 02:01:19,978
- How bad?
- Like, all the bad.

1590
02:01:21,357 --> 02:01:22,722
Yeah, this is bad.

1591
02:01:24,277 --> 02:01:25,733
I don't suppose you can still fly?

1592
02:01:36,247 --> 02:01:37,829
Yeah, that's not happening.

1593
02:02:03,608 --> 02:02:04,848
Neo! Get on.

1594
02:02:13,618 --> 02:02:15,359
Calliope! Take the wounded!

1595
02:02:15,537 --> 02:02:17,403
Everyone else, we stay with them!

1596
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:37,006
- How is she?
- Life signs are good.

1597
02:02:40,979 --> 02:02:42,310
Her signal's strong, Captain.

1598
02:02:51,239 --> 02:02:53,230
Well done, Captain.

1599
02:02:55,702 --> 02:02:57,409
Now all we need is a miracle.

1600
02:03:25,607 --> 02:03:26,607
I hate bots.

1601
02:03:33,072 --> 02:03:34,858
- Get us out of here!
- I'm trying!

1602
02:03:35,033 --> 02:03:36,833
The lockdown is tracking.
Swarm is everywhere.

1603
02:03:36,993 --> 02:03:38,193
Never seen anything like this.

1604
02:04:23,998 --> 02:04:26,114
Seq, what is that?

1605
02:04:31,172 --> 02:04:32,253
What's wrong?

1606
02:04:34,050 --> 02:04:35,461
What are you...

1607
02:04:43,142 --> 02:04:45,053
He's turning bots into bombs.

1608
02:05:17,552 --> 02:05:18,633
Shit!

1609
02:05:18,803 --> 02:05:19,803
Lexy?

1610
02:05:34,277 --> 02:05:35,438
Sheperd's in trouble.

1611
02:05:38,531 --> 02:05:39,692
Jack me in.

1612
02:05:40,616 --> 02:05:42,656
I can get you in.
I don't know if I can get you out.

1613
02:05:48,499 --> 02:05:50,081
No!

1614
02:06:03,514 --> 02:06:04,549
What are they doing?

1615
02:06:08,728 --> 02:06:10,264
Herding them into a kill zone.

1616
02:06:43,429 --> 02:06:44,794
Captain, you gotta hurry.

1617
02:06:44,889 --> 02:06:47,051
Hang on, Lex.

1618
02:06:51,312 --> 02:06:53,053
Lexy!

1619
02:07:35,398 --> 02:07:36,598
There they are!

1620
02:08:02,925 --> 02:08:04,086
Morpheus!

1621
02:08:07,972 --> 02:08:08,972
Lex.

1622
02:08:09,849 --> 02:08:11,635
- Bugsy.
- Hell yeah!

1623
02:08:12,643 --> 02:08:14,225
Seq, where's Neo?

1624
02:08:14,395 --> 02:08:15,931
It's bad. They're pinned.

1625
02:08:16,105 --> 02:08:17,105
Heading to a roof.

1626
02:09:26,509 --> 02:09:29,126
Nodal fibrillation is critical.
She'll die if we don't extract.

1627
02:10:10,177 --> 02:10:12,760
It's so beautiful.

1628
02:10:28,112 --> 02:10:29,773
I remember this.

1629
02:10:31,907 --> 02:10:34,069
I remember us.

1630
02:10:52,219 --> 02:10:54,176
My dream ended here.

1631
02:11:05,107 --> 02:11:06,643
We can't go back.

1632
02:11:08,778 --> 02:11:09,859
We won't.

1633
02:11:29,215 --> 02:11:30,501
Can they make the jump?

1634
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:02,825
I'm not doing this.

1635
02:12:03,374 --> 02:12:04,660
Are you doing this?

1636
02:12:28,774 --> 02:12:29,855
Bye.

1637
02:13:50,940 --> 02:13:52,476
How dramatic.

1638
02:13:53,317 --> 02:13:54,398
"Tiffany"?

1639
02:13:54,818 --> 02:13:57,651
It was a private joke.

1640
02:13:57,821 --> 02:13:59,277
An amusement, that's all.

1641
02:13:59,448 --> 02:14:01,530
An amusement? Hmm.

1642
02:14:03,577 --> 02:14:05,568
Whoa.

1643
02:14:05,746 --> 02:14:07,111
Kind of like that?

1644
02:14:11,377 --> 02:14:13,789
Okay. Ow.

1645
02:14:14,338 --> 02:14:16,420
If you hated the name so much,
why did you heel

1646
02:14:16,549 --> 02:14:18,039
like a good little bitch so long?

1647
02:14:21,220 --> 02:14:23,302
Yeah. Definitely asked for that.

1648
02:14:28,769 --> 02:14:30,555
Can't you control her?

1649
02:14:36,485 --> 02:14:38,101
That was for using children.

1650
02:14:43,075 --> 02:14:44,565
We have a few questions.

1651
02:14:44,743 --> 02:14:47,906
- You tried to activate the fail-safe.
- The Suits tried.

1652
02:14:48,080 --> 02:14:50,242
Obviously, without control
of your source code,

1653
02:14:50,416 --> 02:14:51,747
I knew that was impossible.

1654
02:14:51,917 --> 02:14:53,954
So, why haven't the Suits purged you?

1655
02:14:54,920 --> 02:14:56,786
Because I know the system.

1656
02:14:57,631 --> 02:14:59,372
I know human beings.

1657
02:15:00,134 --> 02:15:01,624
And I know you.

1658
02:15:04,930 --> 02:15:07,297
Right now, you're feeling good
about what you've done.

1659
02:15:07,474 --> 02:15:09,715
You should. It was a victory. Bravo.

1660
02:15:10,561 --> 02:15:11,892
Now what?

1661
02:15:12,062 --> 02:15:14,679
You've come here
to negotiate some kind of deal?

1662
02:15:14,857 --> 02:15:16,268
You think you hold all the cards

1663
02:15:16,442 --> 02:15:18,729
because you can do
whatever you want in this world.

1664
02:15:18,902 --> 02:15:21,234
I say, go for it.

1665
02:15:21,405 --> 02:15:23,897
Remake it. Knock yourselves out.

1666
02:15:24,074 --> 02:15:25,985
Paint the sky with rainbows.

1667
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:27,275
But here's the thing.

1668
02:15:27,453 --> 02:15:30,320
The sheeple aren't going anywhere.

1669
02:15:30,497 --> 02:15:31,737
They like my world.

1670
02:15:31,915 --> 02:15:34,748
They don't want this sentimentality.

1671
02:15:34,918 --> 02:15:36,659
They don't want freedom or empowerment.

1672
02:15:36,837 --> 02:15:39,204
They want to be controlled.

1673
02:15:39,381 --> 02:15:41,338
They crave the comfort of certainty.

1674
02:15:41,508 --> 02:15:44,170
And that means you two,
back in your pods,

1675
02:15:44,345 --> 02:15:47,679
unconscious and alone, just like them.

1676
02:15:52,102 --> 02:15:54,719
We're not here to negotiate anything.

1677
02:15:54,897 --> 02:15:56,979
We were on our way to remake your world.

1678
02:15:57,149 --> 02:15:58,560
Change a few things.

1679
02:15:58,734 --> 02:16:01,101
I kind of like the
"paint the sky with rainbows" idea.

1680
02:16:01,195 --> 02:16:03,357
Just remind people
what a free mind can do.

1681
02:16:03,530 --> 02:16:04,986
I forgot. It's easy to forget.

1682
02:16:05,157 --> 02:16:07,489
- He makes it easy.
- That, he does.

1683
02:16:07,660 --> 02:16:09,697
Something he should think about.

1684
02:16:10,788 --> 02:16:14,326
Before we got started,
we decided to stop by to say thank you.

1685
02:16:15,167 --> 02:16:17,955
You gave us something
we never thought we could have.

1686
02:16:18,128 --> 02:16:19,459
And what is that?

1687
02:16:20,381 --> 02:16:21,963
Another chance.

1688
02:27:25,545 --> 02:27:28,128
Face reality, people. Movies are dead.

1689
02:27:28,298 --> 02:27:30,130
Games are dead.

1690
02:27:30,300 --> 02:27:32,086
Narrative? Dead.

1691
02:27:32,260 --> 02:27:34,126
Media is nothing
but neuro-trigger response

1692
02:27:34,220 --> 02:27:35,220
and viral conditioning.

1693
02:27:35,388 --> 02:27:36,924
Wait, what are you two talking about?

1694
02:27:39,225 --> 02:27:40,386
Cat videos.

1695
02:27:41,269 --> 02:27:44,853
What we need is a series of videos

1696
02:27:45,023 --> 02:27:47,264
that we call "The Catrix."
