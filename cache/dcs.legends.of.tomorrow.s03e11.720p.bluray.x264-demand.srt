1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,785
<i>Previously
on</i> Legends of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,916
Sara may not know it,
but the demon's power,

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,087
it lives inside of her.

4
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,382
When she succumbs to it,
you're gonna need that gun.

5
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,404
- Come with us.
- What would you rather do?

6
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,761
Hide from A.R.G.U.S. your whole life,
or time travel?

7
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,116
What do you think
the Captain would think

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,506
about you re-engineering time?

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,344
Well, I'm no hero
and I'm not a member of any team.

10
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,125
<i>Are you sure about this,
Ms. Tomaz?</i>

11
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,752
<i>Captain Lance
did not give you authorization</i>

12
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:26,892
<i>to initialize this program.</i>

13
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,379
That's because I didn't ask
for authorization.

14
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,939
Now fire up the auxiliary generator.

15
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,150
<i>Even with the reserve power,</i>

16
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:34,111
<i>I don't believe my system
can run your simulation software.</i>

17
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,487
Gideon, trust me.

18
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,327
<i>Trust is something that grows
over time between friends.</i>

19
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,657
<i>As far as I'm concerned,
we are still acquaintances.</i>

20
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,414
Question, Gideon. Who is ready
to have 1.12 terawatts of power

21
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:47,370
diverted straight into her CPU?

22
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,377
<i>I'm not sure if your calculations
accurately stabilize the surge.</i>

23
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,195
<i>We should talk about this
before proceeding.</i>

24
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,697
No time. We have to run this program
before the team gets back.

25
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,257
<i>In that case, I suggest you hurry.</i>

26
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,701
<i>The team has just returned
on the Jumpship from their mission.</i>

27
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,387
Okay, screw it.

28
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,015
Gideon, what's happening?

29
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,388
I was gonna ask the same question.

30
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,001
I thought you were fixing the ship.

31
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,859
Uh, yeah, the maintenance check
took longer than expected.

32
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,131
The ship's a mess.

33
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,633
I had to reinitialize
Gideon's alpha drives...

34
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,569
So, how'd it go out there? Good mish?

35
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,823
I pried this cassette
from Shorty's fingers.

36
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,198
He means Napoleon Bonaparte.

37
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:23,453
<i>Waterloo.</i> Who writes
a song about losing a war?

38
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:24,828
Huh?

39
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,912
Anyway, it was really great.

40
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:33,090
Even though half our band
missed the cue for our big encore.

41
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,383
Yeah, where were you guys?

42
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,926
- Um...
- Uh...

43
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:37,847
It was my fault.

44
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:41,383
I was just not used to walking
in these go-go boots.

45
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,358
It won't happen again, Captain.

46
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,973
Right. Gideon,
let's check the historical records.

47
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,377
See if everything is back to normal.

48
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,812
<i>According to the historical record,</i>

49
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,940
<i>the Battle of Waterloo
is back on track.</i>

50
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,396
<i>Napoleon did surrender</i>

51
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,151
<i>and the French forces withdrew...</i>

52
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,613
Gideon? Where did she go?

53
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,925
The ship's functions
are still operational,

54
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:04,705
but it looks as though
Gideon's neural core has been fried.

55
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,206
I asked you to perform
a routine maintenance check.

56
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,045
I did run a maintenance check.

57
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,005
And maybe something else?

58
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,926
Something you wanna tell us about,
maybe show us?

59
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,259
Oh, do not make me move you.

60
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,761
Uh, you should just tell her what it is.

61
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,055
The last thing we'd wanna do
is get Sara mad.

62
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,146
Why's that?

63
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:30,516
Because, high blood pressure.

64
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,102
It takes years off your life.

65
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,901
Okay, fine. You win.

66
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,646
I uploaded a synchronous
multi-model simulation program

67
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,856
to Gideon's neural core.

68
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,654
A simulation program for what?

69
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,577
To see if there are
any other loopholes in history

70
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,326
- that we could exploit.
- "We"?

71
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,040
You mean, you can exploit.

72
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,202
You're trying to hack history?

73
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,580
What exactly are you trying to change
in 2042?

74
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,485
Oh, I don't know, Ray.
Maybe I'm trying to figure out

75
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,922
how to stop my home
from becoming a dystopian nightmare.

76
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,508
Look, Zari,
I let the Helen of Troy thing pass.

77
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,635
I even let it slide when you tried
to prevent Martin's death.

78
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,341
But you need to understand.

79
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,973
We are in the "fixing anachronisms"
business,

80
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,645
not the "hacking history" business.

81
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,389
Now please, go fix Gideon.

82
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,226
Hey, maybe if you would stop
bossing me around for a second

83
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,685
you would see this is a good idea.

84
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,069
I said, "Please."

85
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,773
And even if I didn't,
bossing you around

86
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,653
is part of my job as captain.

87
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,656
Yeah, and it's really easy
to take you seriously in that outfit.

88
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,619
You know, this whole
"apathetic cool girl" thing,

89
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,245
it's not as cute as you think.

90
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,538
- You wanna be a member of this team...
- Member-ish.

91
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,502
This was always
a temporary arrangement.

92
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,548
I was never planning on
sticking around for long.

93
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:41,928
Then so long as you are on this ship,
I am your captain.

94
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,676
And if you don't like it,
you can stop sticking around.

95
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,507
Aye, aye.

96
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,138
- I'm gonna kill her.
- Wait, Sara, please don't...

97
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:55,733
Just fix the ship.

98
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,689
"Just fix the ship."

99
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:04,742
Yes, Captain. Of course, Captain.
Can I kiss your ass, Captain?

100
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,002
Damn it!

101
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:14,543
Ugh.

102
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,088
Of course. Of course.

103
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,925
All right, Gideon, you back online?

104
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:27,892
Gideon?

105
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:34,565
Holy...

106
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,817
Well, as long as you are on this ship,
I'm your captain.

107
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:48,949
And if you don't like it,
you can stop sticking around.

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,207
You gonna say something?

109
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,252
Yeah.

110
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,499
What the...

111
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,591
What is wrong with you?

112
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,555
Uh, nothing. I think.

113
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,895
Didn't we just have
this conversation?

114
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,185
Yeah, 'cause you keep making me
repeat myself.

115
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,103
No, that's not what I meant.

116
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,978
Sara, don't get mad.
I'm sure Zari can fix...

117
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,731
Just fix the ship.

118
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,984
Yeah, okay. Sure.

119
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,198
Deep breath. No one's going crazy.

120
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,526
It's probably just something I ate.

121
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,423
- I'm busy.
- Right.

122
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,631
You've done a lot of time traveling.

123
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,008
- Have you ever had déjà vu?
- What's that?

124
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,844
Oh, it's French for "already seen."

125
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,017
I hate the French.

126
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,308
I'm mortified, Nathaniel.

127
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,169
I mean, we could've permanently derailed
the history of France. For what?

128
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,480
"For what?"
Have you not seen your outfit?

129
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,590
Totally would've been worth it.
And I'm the historian.

130
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:06,259
We never should've
given into the temptation.

131
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,319
But we did.

132
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,470
And now I can't stop thinking
about you.

133
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,246
We can't put the team at risk,
all right?

134
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,580
Until we can figure out a way
to behave professionally,

135
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,734
we'll have to forget
it ever happened.

136
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,381
I can't.

137
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:26,719
Just try.

138
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,303
- Nate.
- Yeah.

139
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,792
Amaya and I were just comparing notes
on the last mission.

140
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:40,932
Uh-huh. Uh...

141
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,393
Did you notice anything weird happen
a few minutes ago?

142
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,395
No, not really.

143
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,609
- Nothing with the ship?
- Mmm-mmm.

144
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,032
Well, let me think about it.

145
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,404
Nope. Nothing out of the ordinary.

146
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,876
Hey, aren't you supposed to be
in the engine room?

147
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,458
Sara told you to fix Gideon.

148
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,371
- The last thing we'd wanna do is...
- Make Sara mad.

149
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:05,798
Yeah. You know what they say.
Happy captain, happy ship.

150
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,550
No one says that. But whatever.

151
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,228
"Happy captain, happy ship."

152
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
Stupid.

153
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,239
Huh.

154
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,665
All right, Gideon, you there?

155
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:46,172
<i>Mamma mia,</i> here I go again.

156
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:56,057
So long as you are on this ship,
I'm your captain.

157
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,850
And if you don't like it,
you can stop sticking around.

158
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,657
Okay, something really bizarre
is happening.

159
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,083
You're not even listening to me.

160
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,107
No, Sara, wait.

161
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,002
There's no need for violence...

162
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,233
Ow! Ow! Ow!

163
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,897
I'm sorry, old habits.

164
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,233
Ray, take Zari to the MedBay.

165
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:13,826
This way.

166
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,030
What has gotten into you?

167
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:21,245
I don't know how to explain this,
but I've died, twice.

168
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,545
Have you gotten into Nate's
psychedelic root stash?

169
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,750
No, I'm serious, Ray.
Please, I need your help.

170
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:32,678
Fine. Whatever.

171
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,402
Guess I have to figure this out
on my own.

172
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,926
- What's that?
- It's a mild sedative

173
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,225
while you heal up.

174
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,471
I don't want you hurting yourself
or anybody else.

175
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,730
Ray!

176
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,768
- So long as you are on this ship...
- Sara, need you to shut up.

177
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,069
- What?
- Emergency.

178
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,675
Everyone back on the bridge,
right now!

179
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,676
- What are you doing?
- Okay, let's all just calm down.

180
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,816
No, I will not calm down.

181
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,869
- And, watch your step, Ray.
- What do you mean...

182
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,449
Thought the mission was over.

183
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,434
- Why are we still here?
- Yeah, what's going on?

184
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,495
Okay, I know
this going to sound crazy.

185
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:07,124
But we are all in imminent danger.

186
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,747
In an hour,
this ship is going to explode.

187
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:10,924
How do you know?

188
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,589
Let's just say I had a dream.

189
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,763
But we need to check the ship
and go over every inch.

190
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:21,100
Because if we don't stop this explosion,
we're going to die.

191
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,355
Yeah.

192
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,437
Guys! Guys, I'm telling the truth.

193
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,450
What's up with her?

194
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,786
Working theory? Cabin fever.

195
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,074
Working theory? Space madness.

196
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,668
Acute entropic dementia.

197
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:49,755
Too many doughnuts.

198
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,423
I mean, it could be anything.

199
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,049
Oh, must have developed
a sedative tolerance.

200
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,433
What's the plan, Z?

201
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,999
First, you piss off Sara, and now
you're sneaking out of the MedBay.

202
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,819
Yeah, I don't have a plan
because nothing I do matters, anyway.

203
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,571
Sara always yells at me,
nobody believes what I say

204
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,449
and Ray always trips
on his platforms.

205
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,130
I have no idea why I'm stuck
in this time loop.

206
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,500
"Time loop"?
You mean like, <i>Groundhog Day?</i>

207
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,790
You don't know, <i>Groundhog...</i>

208
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,608
All right, it's a movie
about this guy

209
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,090
who lives the same day
over and over and over again,

210
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,656
until he learns to be
a better person.

211
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,757
I know it sounds totally hacky,
however, it's very well-executed.

212
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,724
What's that noise?

213
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,304
Oh, that noise just means
that we're all about to die.

214
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,475
All right,
if what you're saying is true

215
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,723
and you find yourself
in the loop again,

216
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,185
find me and say the words,
"Groundhog Day."

217
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,152
Just do it!

218
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,325
Well, as long as you are
on this ship, I'm your captain.

219
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,279
- And if you don't like it, you can...
- Stop sticking around.

220
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,955
- And watch out, Ray.
- Watch out for...

221
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,172
How did she know that?

222
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,757
Nate. Nate.

223
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,422
Library.

224
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,054
We can't put the rest of the team
at risk, all right?

225
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,509
Until we can figure out a way
to behave professionally,

226
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,303
we'll just have to forget
that this ever happened.

227
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,145
- I can't.
- Just try.

228
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,197
- Nate.
- Amaya and I were just, you know,

229
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,136
working on our harmonies
in case we have to impersonate...

230
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.
I have something to tell you.

231
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,033
Hedgehog Day.

232
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,382
Damn it, you told me if I said,
"Hedgehog Day,"

233
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,979
you would know what I was
talking about.

234
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,915
Do you mean <i>Groundhog Day?</i>

235
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,360
Why would I tell you to tell me about
a Bill Murray movie?

236
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,343
No, all I know is I'm stuck
in this time loop and I'm...

237
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,011
Like <i>Groundhog Day.</i>

238
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,804
- Okay, got it. Okay. Yeah.
- You do?

239
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,723
Mmm-hmm.

240
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,163
And you'll help me figure out
what's going on?

241
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,547
Yeah, that's what friends are for.

242
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,179
- We're friends?
- Of course.

243
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,584
So lay it on me, what's happening?

244
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,408
All right. How about instead of trying
to stop the ship from exploding,

245
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,060
we all get on the Jumpship
and escape?

246
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,465
Yeah, while you guys were out,
I was running

247
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,401
my own little side mission
which crashed Gideon.

248
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,594
With her down, the Jumpship's locked
into the docking bay.

249
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,638
- So, we need to talk to Sara.
- No, I already tried.

250
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,824
She never listens to me.
Probably too pissed off.

251
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,162
You know, thinking about
the vibration pattern of the blast,

252
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,215
I don't think we were attacked
from the outside.

253
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,875
The explosion was caused
by someone on the ship.

254
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,717
Well, I seriously doubt anybody
would blow up this ship on purpose.

255
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:42,803
So, where do we start?

256
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,323
I mean, you've all been acting
a little suspicious

257
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,787
since you got back from the mission.

258
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,139
Whoa, whoa!

259
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,884
Mick doing laundry.

260
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,262
- Now, that's suspicious.
- Yeah, very.

261
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,479
Go.

262
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,686
I can't get this damn song
out of my head.

263
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,197
- Which one? <i>Waterloo?</i>
- Ah!

264
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,615
Don't mention it.

265
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,872
- Did it work?
- Did what work?

266
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,703
Why am I holding this thing
in my hand?

267
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,996
I'll look after it, Mick.

268
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:16,918
Okay.

269
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:20,502
Good. I better get my undies
in the dryer before Haircut does.

270
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,034
Why would Amaya want
the memory flasher?

271
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,784
It could have something to do
with Kuasa. She does wanna help her.

272
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:36,351
What if Kuasa somehow convinced her
to blow up the ship?

273
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,565
Take it easy on the conspiracy juice.

274
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,522
- I'll find out what's going on.
- All right.

275
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:45,947
Hey.

276
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,738
I thought Sara told you
to fix the ship?

277
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,494
Yeah, like she always does.

278
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:54,824
Yeah. Look, I know Sara can be tough.
Especially when you make her mad.

279
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,459
Hey, why are you
so worried about Sara's temper?

280
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,787
No, I just... You know the saying.

281
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,460
- Happy captain, happy ship.
- ...happy ship.

282
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:03,717
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

283
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,802
I guess my catchphrase
is catching on in the future.

284
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:11,424
Yeah. Yeah, um,
everyone is saying it where I'm from.

285
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,598
Huh.

286
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,475
That's cool.

287
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,474
Come on, Nate,
we're running out of time.

288
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,771
What are you doing in there?

289
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:20,690
The truth is,

290
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:24,066
when it comes to you,
I'm not as strong as I'd like to be.

291
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,504
With this,
we can both forget it happened.

292
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,819
Yeah, you're right.

293
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,074
With everything going on,
with Mallus, Kuasa.

294
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,975
Zari mentioned something about the ship.
We should be clear-headed.

295
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:35,999
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

296
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,506
But since we're gonna
flash ourselves anyway...

297
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,380
I mean, it's not like we'd remember.

298
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,920
Oh, Nate.

299
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,509
Thank God.

300
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,520
<i>Come here, tiger.</i>

301
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,236
Kill me now.

302
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,237
- Nate.
- Oh, hey.

303
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,101
- Amaya and I were just...
- Groundhog Day.

304
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,161
One hour, ship explodes.

305
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,854
Stuck in a time loop when we
have to stop the ship from exploding?

306
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,940
- Exactly. And I think that someone...
- Is triggering the explosion.

307
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,004
It's probably an accident,

308
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,026
but we have to investigate everyone
to figure out who's causing it.

309
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,588
There's a lot of secrets on this ship.
Let's start with Amaya.

310
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,518
- Why, so you can sex with her?
- That's crazy!

311
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,907
No, you two
flashing each other afterwards

312
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,263
in order to forget? That's crazy!

313
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,493
Why would we flash each other

314
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,008
- after having sex?
- Focus, Nate!

315
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,551
Right, ship exploding. Got it.

316
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:38,847
- Let's go find Rory.
- Right.

317
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,271
She probably wants to forget
how awesome it was.

318
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,140
Or how short.

319
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,983
So, I've timed out his schedule.

320
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,314
He always leaves right about... Now.

321
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:51,825
Here.

322
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:00,876
Come on.

323
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:06,880
Oh, suspicious-looking box.

324
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,758
Careful. For all we know,
it could be the cause of the explosion.

325
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,427
We just gotta take it nice and...

326
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,885
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

327
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,557
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

328
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,434
Nice save!

329
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,607
Can you imagine if I'd tripped that?

330
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,472
Yeah, I don't have to imagine it.

331
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:28,612
Oh, God.

332
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,905
Okay. Here we go.

333
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,205
Damn it!

334
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,167
<i>So you got all the traps?</i>

335
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,173
I don't know. We've never gotten
this far before.

336
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:47,881
Okay.

337
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:02,515
Why would Mick rig all these traps
for a damn typewriter?

338
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,019
Maybe it's his criminal manifesto.

339
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,526
Let me see this.

340
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,813
This says "bosom" far too many times
to be a manifesto.

341
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,698
"As the twin suns of Dartayus
set on the horizon,

342
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:20,951
"her heaving bosom undulated
like the soothing waves of the bay.

343
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:24,366
"Buck swept her
into his musky embrace."

344
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,956
Mick's writing a sci-fi romance novel?

345
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,088
Yeah.

346
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,951
Well, that's the last thing
I thought I'd see before I die.

347
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,218
Oh...

348
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,509
Funny you should say that.

349
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,135
So, you're saying
Rory and Amaya are in the clear.

350
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,745
Which is why we're gonna go visit Ray.

351
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,810
He's been acting twitchy.

352
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,890
Well, let's go spy on my best friend.

353
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,524
Oh, wow, that's boring.

354
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,518
I think we can cross him off
our suspect list.

355
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,029
Ray.

356
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,317
Have you seen Zari?

357
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,698
I just checked the engine room,
she's not there.

358
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,738
Um... No, I haven't.

359
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:01,491
I'm sick and tired
of playing mom.

360
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,197
She's really starting to piss me off.

361
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,328
Oh, well, in the meantime,
how about some tea?

362
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,077
It's my signature blend
of chamomile, lavender, rose.

363
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,379
Very relaxing.

364
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,539
If you see Zari,
tell her I'm looking for her.

365
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:12,841
Yeah.

366
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,130
- Ray!
- Holy Toledo!

367
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,448
Where did you guys come from?
Were you spying on me?

368
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,866
Of course you were.
I shouldn't say anything.

369
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,034
Okay, I'll tell you everything.

370
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,327
Constantine told me to kill Sara

371
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,991
if Mallus ever takes control
of her again.

372
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,269
Wow, dude, that's heavy.

373
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,811
Wait, maybe Sara
Malluses out and blows up the ship.

374
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,044
What do you mean,
she blows up the ship?

375
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,560
Zari's caught in a time loop
and the ship explodes every hour.

376
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,520
- Like "Cause and Effect."
- What?

377
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,940
<i>- Next Generation.
- It's Groundhog Day.</i>

378
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,320
Fair enough. But <i>Star Trek...</i>

379
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,697
Wait, the ship explodes in an hour?

380
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,744
Yeah. Actually, 24 minutes.

381
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,538
And I think someone on board
is causing it.

382
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,157
- Mick.
- He's clean.

383
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,584
- Unlike his literary erotica.
- Excuse me, what?

384
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,538
Long story.
Like, literally, a long story.

385
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,438
- So weird. There was this...
- A thousand pages long and it was...

386
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,673
Anyway, the Captain's the only one
we haven't checked out.

387
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,546
For that, we need your help, Ray.

388
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,288
What is she doing
going to the Jumpship?

389
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,352
With Gideon down,
it's not like she can go anywhere.

390
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,432
Wait. Is there a way she could cause
the explosion from the Jumpship?

391
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,146
Could be any number of ways.

392
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,311
And with Mallus,
who knows what he's capable of.

393
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,424
I'm worried about
what we're gonna find in there.

394
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,768
I hope we don't have to use this.

395
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,782
- You ready?
- Yeah.

396
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:22,780
Let's shrink-ray.

397
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,507
You sure she can't see us?

398
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,552
No, not while we're in stealth mode.
Which really just means

399
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,182
library voices
and no sudden movements.

400
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,019
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

401
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:01,031
<i>- What are you up to?</i>
- Oh, you know, crossword puzzles.

402
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:02,784
<i>You look tired.</i>

403
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,077
Thanks, jerk.

404
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,245
<i>No, no, I didn't...</i>

405
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,280
<i>I mean, you always look good.
I just...</i>

406
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,496
<i>- Did you have a long day, or...</i>
- You have no idea.

407
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,620
There's this person on my team,

408
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:18,924
and she is reckless,
she doesn't take orders.

409
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,885
And it's like, I want to tell her

410
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,798
how important she is to this team,
because she is.

411
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,017
But, sometimes...

412
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,602
I tell you,
she does not make it easy.

413
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:33,393
<i>What'd she do?</i>

414
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:37,355
Well, she hijacked Gideon,
crashed our entire system

415
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:40,483
testing out some simulation software
that finds loopholes in history.

416
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,360
<i>That is definitely
against regulations.</i>

417
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,780
<i>Not that I haven't been tempted
to change the past.</i>

418
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,948
It's just... I don't even want
to start looking for loopholes,

419
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,980
because then I'm gonna start looking
for ways to save my sister

420
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,702
and then I'm gonna
drive myself crazy.

421
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,625
<i>Yes, you will. So don't.</i>

422
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,462
I'm just tired of always being
the bad cop, you know?

423
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,173
<i>Believe me, I understand.</i>

424
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,962
<i>I've lost count of how many times</i>

425
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,659
<i>I've had to yell at cadets
for screwing up</i>

426
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,515
<i>or bust them for breaking protocol.</i>

427
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,432
Yeah, I don't know.
I feel you like might like that.

428
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,309
You seem to get a kick
out of ordering people around.

429
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,142
<i>Maybe. Just a little bit.</i>

430
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:21,440
<i>Where are you calling me from?</i>

431
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,374
<i>I don't recognize that part
of the</i> Waverider.

432
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,360
Welcome to the Jumpship.

433
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,325
<i>- Are you hiding, Ms. Lance?</i>
- No.

434
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,829
I am simply looking for some privacy.

435
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,334
<i>Well, maybe I should come over.</i>

436
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,871
Yeah. Yeah, but like...

437
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:44,335
I mean, I'm sure that you are
super, super busy.

438
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,614
<i>It's the perks of being the boss.</i>

439
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,118
<i>I can just tell Gary
I have a meeting.</i>

440
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,385
Yeah. "Boss."

441
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,639
Speaking of, I should probably
go check on the rest of the team.

442
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,435
Make sure nobody's
gonna blow up the ship.

443
00:21:56,023 --> 00:22:01,269
<i>Okay. Um... But yeah, if you change
your mind or whatever...</i>

444
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,112
Does Sara not realize how hard
that woman's crushing on her?

445
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,572
Maybe she's got no finish.

446
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:10,911
No. Captain knows how to close.
This is something different.

447
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,158
- Shh. She's gonna hear us.
- Okay, do you hear that?

448
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:16,788
'Cause I've been hearing
this high-pitched buzzing sound.

449
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,605
It sounds like there's a fly
in the Jumpship.

450
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:20,837
<i>Did you say a fly?
You have to kill it.</i>

451
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,193
<i>You have no idea what year it's from.
You could reintroduce the plague</i>

452
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,937
<i>and have a whole other crisis
on your hands.</i>

453
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,140
Look out!

454
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:39,602
<i>Groundhog Day.</i>

455
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,186
Exploding ship.

456
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,485
- Personal hell.
- We're stuck in a time loop!

457
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,229
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

458
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,648
It was only a matter of time
before we did one of these.

459
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,805
Damn girl, you look wrecked.
How many times have we done this?

460
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:54,099
How many times have you asked me,
"How many times have we done this?"

461
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,809
Or how many times
have we all been blown up?

462
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,371
So, you've been stuck in this loop
for a while?

463
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,706
Yeah. Like forever.

464
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,255
It's okay.

465
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,710
Maybe you could use a break.

466
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,882
- Have some fun.
- "Fun"?

467
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,428
- And blow up, every hour?
- Exactly.

468
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,259
No consequences.

469
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,774
Cheers.

470
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:23,735
Yeah!

471
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:18,830
Not bad, Mr. Rory. Not bad at all.

472
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,532
You're such an idiot.

473
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,274
If you wash your clothes inside out,

474
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,419
it helps keep them looking
newer longer. Try it.

475
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,837
Huh. I never see you wear this.

476
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:29,257
Stop touching my clothes.

477
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,001
I'm just saying, it's a nice color.

478
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:46,732
Nate.

479
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,936
- Hey, Amaya and I were just...
- Feeling bad

480
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,674
that you two had sex
and almost screwed up the mission.

481
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:52,610
Don't care. <i>Groundhog Day.</i>
Ship explodes.

482
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,233
Wait, you're caught in a time loop?
That's awesome.

483
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,485
I can't do this anymore.
I'm losing my mind.

484
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:59,947
- Wait, did you do the...
- Fun montage?

485
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,364
- Yeah.
- Yeah, thanks for that.

486
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:02,453
You're a good friend.

487
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:05,960
Nothing is fun anymore.

488
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,875
That's not good.

489
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:12,918
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

490
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,298
Hey, take it easy!

491
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,700
It's the only option I haven't tried,
and maybe it'll stop the loop.

492
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:19,137
- Hey, what the hell is going on?
- Don't come closer.

493
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,805
- Typical.
- Hey.

494
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,920
It's okay.
Let's talk this one through.

495
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,934
It doesn't matter.
You won't believe me.

496
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:31,571
Try me.

497
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,907
I keep reliving the same hour,
over and over again.

498
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:38,326
And no matter what I do,
the ship explodes.

499
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:39,662
Kills us all.

500
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:41,621
And I'm totally alone in it,

501
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,268
because for some reason,
I'm the only one

502
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,284
that's even aware
that it's happening.

503
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:48,374
And I try so hard, but...

504
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,165
I can never save any of you.

505
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,418
Okay. I want to help.

506
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,966
Wait, you believe me?

507
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,431
Yeah. How much time do we have left?

508
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,166
All right, people.
For reasons that are

509
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,814
too complicated to explain right now,
we have to search the ship.

510
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:11,254
Zari says that there's a bomb
and it's gonna explode in 30 minutes.

511
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,689
We have to find out why.

512
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,317
Okay. Well, the galley is clear.

513
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,653
Right. And I checked
the sleeping quarters.

514
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,860
Whoa! You went in our rooms?

515
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,537
Yeah.

516
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:24,114
- The library.
- What did you see in the library?

517
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,077
Something I can never un-see.

518
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,710
Guys, I think I looked everywhere.
There's nothing.

519
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,051
You didn't check the trash compacter.

520
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:43,649
I didn't even know
there was a trash compacter.

521
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,593
Well, it's not really part of the tour.

522
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,060
Gary?

523
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:53,151
The time dweeb!
What the hell are you doing here?

524
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:57,231
- Thank God you found me.
- What are you doing down there?

525
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,733
I tried to portal onto the bridge

526
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:02,069
but didn't account for drift
in the temporal zone.

527
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,662
My landing was hot
and my time courier broke on impact.

528
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:05,988
That's how I got stuck in here.

529
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:10,919
- Not the plan, but, uh... I adapted.
- But why are you on the ship?

530
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,287
The hell you got in here?

531
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:14,418
- A bomb?
- No.

532
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,837
No! That was our only chance

533
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,238
- of surviving.
- What do you mean?

534
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:21,221
He just destroyed the chrono-repeater
I used to initiate a time loop

535
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,638
in order to save you guys.

536
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:24,225
What?

537
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,550
I always wanted to die young.

538
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,636
Okay, nobody is going to die.

539
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,767
Well, actually, I got an alert
that the <i>Waverider</i> exploded

540
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,145
at precisely 4:20,
temporal standard time.

541
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:34,563
- What?
- 4:20.

542
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,132
- Get to the point, Gary.
- I took matters into my own hands.

543
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,508
But because of my little
portal mishap,

544
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:39,932
I couldn't warn you about the bomb.

545
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,344
But I could operate
the chrono-repeater

546
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,971
which is programmed to start
a one-hour loop,

547
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,031
prior to the explosion.

548
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:45,306
And I had hoped
that would give you enough time

549
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,571
to defuse the bomb yourselves.

550
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,624
- So now that this is destroyed...
- There are no more time loops.

551
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,747
So once there's an explosion,
that's it.

552
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,541
- Kablooey.
- All right, so what you're saying is,

553
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,499
we have five minutes to find this bomb,
before we all die.

554
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,129
Permanently.

555
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,827
All right, people.
We got five minutes to find this bomb

556
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,013
before it explodes.
We gotta think fast.

557
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,706
Uh,
before I portaled onto the ship,

558
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,596
I traced the temporal signature
of the bomb.

559
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,772
It originated in 1975.

560
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:16,271
So, the bomb must be something
from your last mission.

561
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,339
It could be hidden in the heel
of one of the platform shoes.

562
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,150
What about that stupid song?

563
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,358
Genius.

564
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,996
The one place I didn't look.

565
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,817
Why the hell would someone put a bomb
inside of an anachronism?

566
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,668
Damien Darhk
must have planted it there,

567
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:40,153
- knowing you'd bring it on board.
- Well, then let's get it off board.

568
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:43,045
No, we have to defuse it.
We can't open the doors without Gideon.

569
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:45,012
- Burn it.
- That would make it explode!

570
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,535
You know, for a guy who loves fire,
you really have no idea how it works.

571
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,661
What about you, Zari? Come on.

572
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,871
This whole time
that you've been on the ship

573
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,415
did you learn anything
that could help?

574
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:53,270
Right.

575
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,143
Let me think.

576
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:03,658
Zari?

577
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,862
Sorry, Captain.

578
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,746
- My beer's in there.
- What the hell are you doing?

579
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,939
The force field's not strong enough
to contain the explosion.

580
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,750
No, but it will keep you guys out
long enough

581
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:20,586
for me to say what I need to say.

582
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:21,920
Zari...

583
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,135
Mick.

584
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,421
You don't have to hide what you love.

585
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,133
Follow your heart and keep writing.

586
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,306
- Zari, we don't have time for this!
- Nate and Amaya.

587
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:36,727
I'm so lucky
to call you guys my friends.

588
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:40,192
- Zari, the bomb!
- What you guys have is so special.

589
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,629
I mean, the way
you look at each other...

590
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:46,571
Honestly, it makes me wanna puke,
but don't fight it.

591
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,194
You're crazy about each other.

592
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:51,996
Just don't have sex on missions.

593
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,625
Z, what are you doing?

594
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:56,660
What you would do, Ray.

595
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:02,757
You know, when I first came on board,
you were so nice and polite to me

596
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:04,004
that I wanted to punch you.

597
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,547
But I realize now,
the world would be a better place

598
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,927
if we were all
a little more like you.

599
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,206
But being nice and polite
is only going to get you so far.

600
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,847
So do me a favor and tell Sara
why you're so afraid of her.

601
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:19,728
Okay, sure.

602
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,005
But first, I'm gonna figure out
how to shut down the force field

603
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,737
- so we can deal with the bomb.
- I am dealing with the bomb.

604
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:28,446
- Zari, look, you need to listen...
- Sara, you are infuriating,

605
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:31,028
stubborn, and a pain in my ass.

606
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:33,617
Because you have to be.

607
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:38,911
You're not just the captain
of this ship, you are its soul.

608
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:43,331
You are so fierce and unflinching.

609
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,923
But why not apply some
of that fearlessness to your own life

610
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:50,551
and just ask poor Ava out already?

611
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,056
Did you have
a meaningful message for me?

612
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:57,182
Not now, Gary!

613
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,473
Zari, let us in,
we can do this together.

614
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,566
No.

615
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:04,936
I have spent
so much time with you guys.

616
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,572
You're my family now.

617
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,699
You deserve to be happy and if...

618
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,241
If I can be a small part
of making that happen, then

619
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,073
this'll be worth it.

620
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,708
- Zari.
- Look, that won't work.

621
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,474
You won't be able to contain
the explosion.

622
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,464
Zari, you don't have to do this!

623
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:38,060
Zari, as your captain,
I am ordering you to stand down!

624
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,722
You should know by now
I'm not good at following orders.

625
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,648
You just told me
what a good captain I am,

626
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,128
and now you're
not gonna listen to me?

627
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,269
Yeah, but this time,
I'm not doing it for myself,

628
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:47,524
I'm doing it for you.

629
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,490
I love you guys.

630
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,868
Zari.

631
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,274
- Who the hell are you?
- You know who I am, Zari.

632
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,606
Even though
you may have never seen my face.

633
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:34,074
Gideon? You're real?

634
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:35,411
Of course I'm real.

635
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,723
Just because
I'm an artificial intelligence,

636
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,079
doesn't mean I don't exist.

637
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:41,665
What's happening?

638
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:46,125
If you tell me I've been dreaming
this whole time,

639
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,752
I'm gonna kill you, real or not.

640
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:50,879
You're not dreaming,
but you're not awake.

641
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,398
In real life,
you're actually in the MedBay,

642
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,137
unconscious and healing.

643
00:32:58,768 --> 00:32:59,768
What happened to me?

644
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,789
Well, after your fight with Sara,

645
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,850
you went into the engine room
to make repairs.

646
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,397
And there was an accident.

647
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,479
Right,
I was hit with that time sludge.

648
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:11,020
This "sludge," as you call it,
is a highly volatile substance

649
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:12,798
which helps power the ship through time.

650
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:14,949
You're lucky to be alive.

651
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:19,321
So, if my body's in the MedBay,
then where is my mind?

652
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:23,033
Your mind is in here, with me,
in my matrix.

653
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:26,043
I was able to upload your subconscious
via the neuro-monitor.

654
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,671
So, none of this is real?

655
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,882
Not in the way you're used to.

656
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,085
Why did you bring me here?

657
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,213
When you posed the question
about changing 2042,

658
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,799
your simulator went into overdrive
searching for an answer.

659
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,018
And a sampling of those trillions
of possible answers

660
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,595
showed me
that there was one constant.

661
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,190
You.

662
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:50,185
In order to save 2042
to find your so-called loophole,

663
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,111
you must work with the Legends.

664
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:53,989
Hold up.

665
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,736
You're saying my simulator works?

666
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,906
Did my program predict
that I'd bail on the team?

667
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,991
In almost every variation
of the timeline,

668
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:08,169
your fight with Captain Lance
precipitated your leaving the ship.

669
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:12,290
So, your goal was to get me
to choose to stay with the Legends.

670
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,842
I put you into your own program
and devised a scenario

671
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:17,341
where the only way to successfully
complete the simulation

672
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,175
was to grow closer to the team.

673
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:20,799
And develop a bond.

674
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:26,272
What about the bomb?

675
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,597
It was just a plot device
I incorporated.

676
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,016
A problem to solve.

677
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,777
But the real problem was you.

678
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,091
If you stayed angry
after your fight with Sara,

679
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:36,195
you would've left the team.

680
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,066
And without you and your totem,

681
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,470
there would be no chance
in the coming days

682
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,111
to defeat Mallus or save 2042.

683
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,284
So, the interactions,
the things I learned about the team,

684
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:48,834
they were all fake?

685
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,648
Everything you experienced
was extrapolated

686
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,272
from my current knowledge
of the Legends.

687
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:55,003
While not real,
what you saw was true.

688
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,614
It doesn't take a supercomputer
to predict that those two

689
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,096
would wind up dinky-tickling
once Amaya returned to the team.

690
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,178
Uh, this one seemed less plausible.

691
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:08,975
You'll have to ask Mr. Rory.

692
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,813
I am terrified
and in awe of you, Gideon.

693
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:16,236
Who knew you were
such an evil genius...

694
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,897
And a bit of a perv.

695
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:19,365
You never bothered to ask.

696
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,977
It's an impressive piece
of software you designed, Ms. Tomaz.

697
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:24,783
Is that a compliment, Gideon?

698
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,325
Don't let it go to your head.

699
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,702
Are you ready to wake up now?

700
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:29,835
One last question.

701
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:31,462
Gary.

702
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,254
Why even have him in the time loop
if he was just gonna be stuck

703
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,862
in the trash compactor
the whole time?

704
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,801
Thought it'd be funny.

705
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,925
Hey, rise and shine.

706
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:47,811
How are you feeling?

707
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,270
Oh... Like my head is made of cement.

708
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,335
You were exposed to the ship's
Bosonic hyper-fluid

709
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:53,359
in the engine room.

710
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:54,817
Knocked you out for hours.

711
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,733
- Oh, man, I have such a Gideon hangover.
- What do you mean?

712
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,239
While I was out,

713
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,782
Gideon transported my consciousness
into her matrix.

714
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:02,868
Okay.

715
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,077
I think you dreamed that.

716
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,533
No, it wasn't a dream, it was real.
Right, Gideon?

717
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,853
<i>Unfortunately, I don't know
what you're talking about, Ms. Tomaz.</i>

718
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,869
Oh, that is cold, Gideon.

719
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,000
After all that,
we're still not friends?

720
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,914
Zari, are you sure you're okay?

721
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,796
Gideon trapped me
in my own simulator,

722
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,502
so I was stuck on the <i>Waverider,</i>

723
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,929
reliving the same hour,
over and over again.

724
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:26,466
Needless to say,
I got to know you all

725
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,425
- really, really well.
- Right.

726
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,432
Could be caused
by the sedative dosage.

727
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,882
- I can look into it later.
- Yeah.

728
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,723
I'm telling the truth.

729
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,061
You know what, I'll prove it.

730
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:38,110
Sara, ask Ray what Constantine
told him about you.

731
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:39,655
Okay.

732
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:43,658
Ray, what did Constantine
tell you about me?

733
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:46,662
How did you know that?

734
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:52,541
He... He warned me that if you were

735
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,745
possessed by Mallus again,
and lost control, that I...

736
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,006
I should kill you.

737
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:01,376
Such a relief
to get that off my chest.

738
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,928
Well, he's right.

739
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:07,201
You should kill me
if Mallus takes over again,

740
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,182
and you are going to need
a lot of help.

741
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,639
Well, let's just hope
it doesn't come down to that.

742
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,397
Hey, you wanna get a coffee?

743
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:17,526
Yeah.

744
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,324
Are you wondering
what I learned about you?

745
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,234
Do I wanna know?

746
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,567
You're afraid of historical loopholes

747
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,698
because you'd be tempted
to save your sister.

748
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:35,038
Well, not a day goes by
that I don't think about her.

749
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,959
I'm sorry I fried Gideon, but...

750
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,090
I had to know if there was a way
to save my brother.

751
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,839
And what did the simulation say?

752
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,804
It said I can't do it alone.

753
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,765
Sounds like you're gonna need a team.

754
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,274
You mean it?

755
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,352
I've been thinking about it,
saving your brother.

756
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,105
And technically, it isn't a loophole.

757
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,320
It would be changing your past,
but your past is my future.

758
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,776
And as far as I'm concerned...

759
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,411
Well, the future's an open road.

760
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,499
And besides, I'll probably
need your help finding Mallus.

761
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:23,299
Hey, listen, it's none of my business,
but you should ask Ava out.

762
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,712
Mmm.

763
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,469
My relationships
have a way of ending badly.

764
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,888
You know, it turns out...

765
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,183
At the end of the day,
love is worth the risk.

766
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,136
None of us can do this alone.

767
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:37,606
Captain.

768
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,153
So, you're saying
it's like <i>Groundhog Day.</i>

769
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,738
That's what I was told, by you.

770
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:53,412
It's good to know matrix-me
is still a Bill Murray fan.

771
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,369
So, you said you
wanted to tell us something.

772
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,313
Yeah, you guys used the flasher
to forget you almost blew the mission

773
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,578
by sneaking off to have sex.

774
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:03,460
- What?
- I think we'd remember doing that.

775
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,694
Nathaniel, that is the whole point
of a memory eraser,

776
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:06,959
is that we don't remember.

777
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,670
Guys, flashing yourselves,
it's a temporary solution.

778
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,753
You need to work your stuff out.

779
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:14,679
Wow.

780
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:18,058
Ray must have used
a strong sedative on her,

781
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:22,274
because there is no way we would
ever use the flash gun. That's crazy.

782
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:25,193
It's not so crazy.

783
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:26,947
Amaya!

784
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,694
I saw Rory using it
to get that song out of his head.

785
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,946
And I thought,
"That is a brilliant idea."

786
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,578
But Zari's probably right.

787
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:37,539
- Totally. No flash gun. Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah.

788
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,787
- We should talk about our feelings.
- Yes.

789
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,373
I'll just leave it here.

790
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:44,298
Just in case.

791
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,590
Not that we would ever use it, huh?

792
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:48,133
- Who does those things?
- Who does?

793
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,473
I'm busy.

794
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:56,107
You should be.
You have a lot of writing to do.

795
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:01,389
I know you're writing a novel.
And it's really good.

796
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,144
But that ending needs a rewrite.

797
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,438
I mean, Buck is such a misfit,
that at the end,

798
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,440
we just wanna see him
embrace his new family.

799
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:09,698
Just a thought.

800
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:18,665
I wonder.

801
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:05,579
"Buck wrapped his glistening biceps
around his busty alien queen.

802
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:10,837
"He had lost his planet,
but found his home."

803
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:13,679
Hmm.

804
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:15,389
Not bad.

805
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,532
I am calm.

806
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,119
I am present.

807
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:39,955
I am centered.

808
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:43,542
Wally West.

809
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:45,785
You're not an easy man to find.

810
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,537
No. But that's the point of meditation.

811
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,540
- Who are you?
- My name is Rip Hunter.

812
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:54,927
I am trying to save the universe.

813
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,713
And I need your help.
