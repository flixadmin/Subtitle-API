1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,970
That's better.

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,230
You don't need it.

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,520
Still pretty?

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,400
Yeah!

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,360
Pretty. Really pretty.

6
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,700
El?

7
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:32,990
Yes?

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,250
Um, I'm happy you're home.

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,830
Me, too.

10
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,970
Guys!

11
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,850
It's Lucas,
I think he's in trouble.

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,616
Do you remember how he said
he was looking for the gate?

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,220
- Yeah.
- What if he found it?

14
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,350
What's he saying?

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,480
I don't know, he's way out of range.

16
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,520
<i>...son of a bitch!</i>

17
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,730
Lucas, if you can hear us, slow down.
We can't understand you.

18
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,400
Yes, I copy!
Do you?

19
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,240
They know about Eleven!

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,370
Get out of there!
They know about Eleven!

21
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,950
The bad men are coming!
All of them!

22
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,710
Do you hear me?
The bad men are coming!

23
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,460
"Mad hen."
Does that mean anything to you?

24
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,870
Like a code name or something?

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,420
- <i>The bad men are coming!</i>
- "Bad men."

26
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,130
Bad men!

27
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,130
Stay here.

28
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,730
What's that guy doing?

29
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,730
You don't think...

30
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,036
Well, I know she and Steve
have been spending some time together,

31
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,230
- so I thought maybe...
- Mom!

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,110
Well, is he home?

33
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,296
- Maybe you could ask him?
- Mom!

34
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,676
I'm sorry,
can you just hold on, please?

35
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,886
Michael, I'm on the phone.
I've told you a million times...

36
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,820
- Did you schedule any repairs?
- What?

37
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,580
Is there anyone supposed to come
and do repairs on the house?

38
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,356
I don't understand.
Is there something wrong...

39
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,630
- No, Mom, nothing's wrong in the house.
- Mike!

40
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,680
- One second.
- Mike!

41
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,680
We need to leave...
right now.

42
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,730
Michael!

43
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,610
If anyone asks where I am,
I've left the country.

44
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,770
What?

45
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,510
Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go!

46
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,350
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

47
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,876
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
<i>- Dustin!</i>

48
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,780
<i>Dustin, do you copy?</i>

49
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,690
Yeah, Lucas, they're on us.

50
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,400
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- Cornwallis.

51
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,780
<i>Meet me at Elm and Cherry!</i>

52
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,490
Copy. Elm and Cherry!

53
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,780
Okay.

54
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,210
- Shit!
- This way, come on!

55
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,590
Out of the way!

56
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,300
Out of the way!

57
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,076
- Lucas!
- Where are they?

58
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,456
- I don't know.
- I think we lost them.

59
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,940
Go, go, go, go, go!

60
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,110
Go, go, go, go, go!

61
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,530
- Faster, faster!
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

62
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,120
Holy... holy shit!

63
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,580
Did... did you see
what she did to that van?

64
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,750
No, Dustin, we missed it.

65
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,340
- I mean that was...
- Awesome.

66
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,090
It was awesome.

67
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,810
Everything I said
about you being a traitor and stuff...

68
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,520
I was wrong.

69
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,360
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,070
Friends...

71
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,870
friends don't lie.

72
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,080
I'm sorry, too.

73
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,620
Me, too.

74
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,130
Hey.

75
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,680
Jonathan?
Jesus, what... what happened?

76
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,986
- Ma'am...
- I'm fine.

77
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,470
Why is he wearing handcuffs?

78
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,680
Well, your boy assaulted a police officer.
That's why.

79
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,060
- Take them off.
- I am afraid I cannot do that.

80
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,230
- Take them off!
- You heard her. Take 'em off.

81
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:20,780
Chief, I get everyone's emotional here,
but there's something you need to see.

82
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,780
What is this?

83
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,506
Why don't you ask your son?
We found it in his car.

84
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,210
- What?
- Why are you going through my car?

85
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,516
Is that really the question
you should be asking right now?

86
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,210
I wanna see you in my office.

87
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,630
You won't believe me.

88
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,710
Why don't you give me a try?

89
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,510
Mike? Mike?

90
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,820
Yeah, just a minute, please!

91
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,580
Jiminy Christmas.

92
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,950
Hold your horses.

93
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,000
Mr. Wheeler?

94
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,710
Yes?

95
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,550
<i>I don't understand.</i>

96
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,010
You think my son is hiding this girl?

97
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,220
What happened to her hair?

98
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,840
We just need to know
if you've seen her in the past week.

99
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,140
- No, no.
- Absolutely not.

100
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,930
Our son with a girl?

101
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,310
I mean, believe me,

102
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,730
if he had a girl sleeping in this house,
we'd know about it.

103
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,400
Wouldn't we?

104
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,320
This girl...

105
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,440
what has she done?

106
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,280
I'm afraid I can't answer that.

107
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,716
Oh, my God, is she Russian?

108
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,870
- You can't treat us like this.
- I need you to stay calm.

109
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,660
You come into my house,

110
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,250
and you tell me that my son
is hiding some girl,

111
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,460
and that he's in danger,
but you can't tell us why?

112
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,380
And you, what,
you expect me to remain, what, calm?

113
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,060
I understand how upsetting this is.

114
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,350
I wish we could tell you more...

115
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:08,730
but I can tell you that your son,
Michael, is in real danger.

116
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,660
We want to help him.

117
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,530
We will help him.
I give you my word.

118
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,500
But in order for me to do that...

119
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,920
you have to trust me.

120
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,040
Will you trust me?

121
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,010
Good.

122
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,260
Now...

123
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,640
do you have any idea
where your son might have gone?

124
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,980
This is Randolph Road, right here.

125
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,610
The fence starts here,
and goes all the way around.

126
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,650
And this is the lab right here.

127
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,256
The gate's gotta be in there somewhere.

128
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,320
It's gotta be.

129
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,280
Well, who owns Hawkins Lab?

130
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,846
The sign says "Department of Energy."

131
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,000
Department of Energy?
What do you think that means?

132
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,040
It means government. Military.

133
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,356
- Then why does it say "Energy"?
- Just trust me, all right?

134
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,896
It's military. My dad's told me before.

135
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,670
Mike's right. There's soldiers out front.

136
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,800
Do they make, like,
lightbulbs or something?

137
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,090
No, weapons...

138
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,736
to fight the Russians,
and commies and stuff.

139
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,300
Weapons.

140
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,760
Oh, Jesus, this is bad.

141
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,640
Really bad.
The place is like a fortress.

142
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,770
Well, what do we do?

143
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,520
I don't know,
but we can't go home.

144
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,020
We're fugitives now.

145
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,730
Guys?

146
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,570
Do you hear that?

147
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,096
- Go, go, go, go!
- Come on, come on!

148
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,846
- It's stuck.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

149
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,176
- Hurry up! Hurry, come on!
- Come on!

150
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,620
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

151
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,500
Get down!

152
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,260
Mental.

153
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,190
You say blood draws this thing?

154
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,600
We don't know.

155
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,860
It's just a theory.

156
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,150
<i>I'm sorry, Mom.</i>

157
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,240
What, you're sorry?
You're... you're sorry?

158
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,120
- That is not good enough, Jonathan.
- I know.

159
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,676
That's not even close. That's not even
in the... in the ballpark.

160
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,290
I wanted to tell you, I just...

161
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,620
What if this thing took you, too?

162
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:30,000
You risked your life... and Nancy's.

163
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,550
I thought I could save Will...
I still do.

164
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,010
This is not yours to fix alone.

165
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:40,930
You act like you're all alone
out there in the world, but you're not.

166
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,140
You're not alone.

167
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,600
I know.

168
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,100
God damn it, Jonathan.

169
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,890
- I know.
- Damn it.

170
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,036
I want an apology!

171
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,296
An apology for what, exactly?

172
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,126
Where is the chief?
I want to speak to him

173
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,490
- right this instant.
- Stay here.

174
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,400
Ma'am, I need you to calm down.

175
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,660
What is your name, Deputy?

176
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,530
Well, I'm an officer...
okay?

177
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,136
Name and badge number,
both of you!

178
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,096
- What the hell is going on here?
- Chief...

179
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,080
These men are humiliating my son.

180
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,160
- No, no, no. Okay, that's not true.
- Yes.

181
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,686
There was some kind of fight, Chief...

182
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,380
A psychotic child broke his arm!

183
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,710
- A little girl, Chief. A little one.
- That tone! Do you hear that tone?

184
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,106
Honestly,
I'm just trying to state a fact.

185
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,606
- I don't have time for this.
- It was a little girl...

186
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,220
Will you please take a statement...
and get her out?

187
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,526
- Yes.
- So what'd this girl look like?

188
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,720
She had no hair
and she was bleeding from her nose.

189
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,730
Like a freak.

190
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:29,940
What'd you just say?

191
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,150
I said she's a freak!

192
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,020
No, her hair.
What'd you say about her hair?

193
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,030
Her head's shaved.

194
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,860
She doesn't even look like a girl.

195
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
And...

196
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,120
And what?

197
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,200
Tell the man, Troy.

198
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,870
She can...

199
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,420
do things.

200
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,790
What kind of things?

201
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,920
Like...

202
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,340
make you fly.

203
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,640
And piss yourself.

204
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,720
What?

205
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,310
Was she alone?

206
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,600
She always hangs out with those losers.

207
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,850
"Losers"?

208
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,480
What losers?

209
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,650
Hey.

210
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,280
You owe me $1.20.

211
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,466
Don't worry, he'll need more than aspirin
when we're done with him.

212
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,160
Yeah, if the creep ever gets out.

213
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,886
The cops should just lock him up forever.

214
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,500
Did you see the look on his face?

215
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,420
Oh.

216
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,896
He probably had that same look
whenever he killed his brother, right?

217
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,430
Oh, God, I just got an image
of him making that face

218
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,906
while he and Nancy are screwing.

219
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,826
Carol, for once in your life,
shut your damn mouth!

220
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,560
- What?
- Hey, what's your problem, man?

221
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,980
You're both assholes.
That's my problem.

222
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,456
- Are you serious right now, man?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

223
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,536
You shouldn't have done that.

224
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,860
- Done what?
- You know what.

225
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,820
You mean call her out
for what she really is?

226
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,216
Oh, that's funny, because I don't remember
you asking me to stop.

227
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,966
I should've put that spray paint
right down your throat.

228
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,670
- What the hell, Steve?
- You know,

229
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,846
neither of you ever cared about her.
You never even liked her,

230
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,530
because she's not miserable like you two.

231
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,096
She actually cares about other people.

232
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,370
The slut with a heart of gold.

233
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,690
I told you to watch your mouth!

234
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,040
Hey! I don't know
what's gotten into you, man,

235
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,440
- but you don't talk to her that way.
- Get out of my face.

236
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,000
Or what?

237
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,170
Or what?

238
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,840
You gonna fight me now, too? Huh?

239
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,040
You gonna fight me now, too?

240
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,380
Because you couldn't take
Jonathan Byers...

241
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:29,220
so I wouldn't recommend that.

242
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,456
Here, let me get the door for you, buddy.

243
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,280
That's right.
Run away, Stevie boy!

244
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,860
Run away!
Just like you always do.

245
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,280
That Nancy's turning you
into a little pussy!

246
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,660
That's right, Harrington, run away!

247
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,370
Run away!

248
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,550
I have to go home.

249
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,130
No, you can't.

250
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,970
- My mom... my dad are there.
- They're gonna be okay.

251
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,520
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Let go.

252
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,286
- Let go!
- Hey! Listen to me. Listen to me.

253
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,770
The last thing in the world we need

254
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,570
is them knowing
you're mixed up in all this.

255
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,190
- Mike is over there...
- They haven't found him.

256
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,570
Not yet, at least.

257
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,900
- For Mike?
- Come on, get in the car.

258
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,370
Look, we need to find them
before they do.

259
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,846
Do you have any idea
where he might have gone?

260
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,660
- No, I don't.
- I need you to think.

261
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,460
I don't know.
We haven't talked a lot.

262
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,380
I mean, lately...

263
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,686
Is there any place that your...

264
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,670
your parents don't know
about that he might go?

265
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,880
- I don't know.
- I might.

266
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,050
What?

267
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:51,140
I don't know where he is,
but I think I know how to ask him.

268
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,610
Whoa.

269
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,700
I got it.

270
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:22,250
<i>Mike,
are you there? Mike?</i>

271
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,670
You guys hear that?

272
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,880
<i>Mike, it's me, Nancy.</i>

273
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,630
<i>Mike, are you there?</i>

274
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,390
<i>Answer.</i>

275
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,140
<i>Mike, we need you to answer.</i>

276
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,760
Is that your sister?

277
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,390
This is an emergency, Mike.

278
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,770
Do you copy?

279
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,440
Mike, do you copy?

280
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,060
Okay, this is really weird.

281
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,650
Don't answer.

282
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,876
- She said it was an emergency.
- What if it's a trick?

283
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,650
- It's your sister!
- What if the bad people kidnapped her?

284
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,620
- What if they're forcing her to say this?
<i>- I need you to answer.</i>

285
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,240
It's like Lando Calrissian.
Don't answer.

286
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,080
<i>We need to know
that you're there, Mike.</i>

287
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,620
Listen, kid, this is the chief.
If you're there, pick up.

288
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,766
We know you're in trouble
and we know about the girl.

289
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,840
Why is she with the chief?

290
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,276
How the hell does he know about...

291
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,220
<i>We can protect you,
we can help you, but you gotta pick up.</i>

292
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,930
<i>Are you there?
Do you copy? Over.</i>

293
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,850
Anybody got any other ideas?

294
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,940
<i>Yeah, I copy.</i>

295
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,980
<i>It's Mike.</i>

296
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,400
I'm here.

297
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,030
We're here.

298
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,170
Need a hand?

299
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,420
Did you have something
to do with this?

300
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,590
I just...

301
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,760
I wanna help.

302
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,480
All yours.

303
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,080
They expect us
to just sit here like prisoners.

304
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,790
We should be out there looking for him.

305
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:23,660
Honey, we have to trust them, okay?

306
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,540
This is our government.
They're on our side.

307
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,550
That man gives me the creeps.

308
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,260
Nancy.

309
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,800
You don't think
she's involved in this, too, do you?

310
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,300
Nancy with Mike?

311
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,850
No.

312
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,930
No.

313
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,780
Will you stop pacing?

314
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,820
It's been way too long.

315
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,830
Do you know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe this is all a trap

316
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,676
and the bad men
are coming to get us right now!

317
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,700
It's not a trap.

318
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,790
Why would the chief set us up?

319
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,040
Nancy, maybe, but the chief?

320
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,500
Lando Calrissian.

321
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,250
Would you shut up about Lando?

322
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,316
I don't feel good about this.
I don't feel good about this!

323
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,220
When do you feel good
about anything?

324
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,230
Shit!

325
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,650
Go, go, go, go.

326
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,610
Lando.

327
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,440
You think they saw us?

328
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,200
Both of you, shut up.

329
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,506
Hey!

330
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,240
What the...

331
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,920
All right, let's go.

332
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,260
Let's go!

333
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,780
Mike. Oh, my God. Mike!

334
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,660
I was so worried about you.

335
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,160
Yeah, uh... me, too.

336
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,880
Is that my dress?

337
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,550
Okay, so, in this example,
we're the acrobat.

338
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,560
Will and Barbara, and that monster,
they're this flea.

339
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,020
And this is the Upside Down,
where Will is hiding.

340
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,560
Mr. Clarke said the only way to get there
is through a rip of time and space.

341
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,286
- A gate.
- That we tracked to Hawkins Lab.

342
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,610
With our compasses.

343
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:41,820
Okay, so the gate
has a really strong electromagnetic field,

344
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,110
and that can change
the directions of a compass needle.

345
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,410
Is this gate underground?

346
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,160
Yes.

347
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,250
Near a large water tank?

348
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,120
Yes.

349
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,460
How do you know all that?

350
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,630
He's seen it.

351
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,550
Is there any way that you could...

352
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,356
that you could reach Will?
That you could talk to him in this...

353
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,470
The Upside Down.

354
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,180
Down. Yeah.

355
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,036
And my friend Barbara?

356
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,520
Can you find her, too?

357
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,840
I'm sorry.

358
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:48,970
What?

359
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:51,180
What's wrong?
What happened?

360
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,930
I can't find them.

361
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,720
<i>Whenever she uses her powers,
she gets weak.</i>

362
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,350
The more energy she uses,
the more tired she gets.

363
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,020
- Like, she flipped the van earlier.
- It was awesome.

364
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,390
- But she's drained.
- Like a bad battery.

365
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,360
Well...
How do we make her better?

366
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,270
We don't.
We just have to wait and try again.

367
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,190
Well, how long?

368
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,650
I don't know.

369
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,990
The bath.

370
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,320
What?

371
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,620
I can find them.

372
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,160
In the bath.

373
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,540
Oh!

374
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,970
Oh. Oh, my...
No, mmm-mmm.

375
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,106
Hey, you know how they did that?
You know what that is?

376
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,390
No, what?

377
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:13,010
Melted plastic
and microwaved bubble gum.

378
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,970
No way. Really?

379
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,600
Really.

380
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,060
- What in the world?
- Do you want me to pause it?

381
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,730
I'm sure it's just a wrong number.

382
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,740
Hello?

383
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,610
Mr. Clarke? It's Dustin.

384
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,570
Dustin? Is everything okay?

385
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,280
Yeah, yeah. I just, I...

386
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:35,450
I have a science question.

387
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,910
It's ten o'clock on Saturday.
Why don't we pick this up...

388
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,960
Do you know anything
about sensory deprivation tanks?

389
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,840
Specifically how to build one?

390
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,880
Sensory deprivation?
What is this for?

391
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,170
Fun.

392
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,930
Okay. Well...

393
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,180
Why don't we talk about it Monday?
After school, okay?

394
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,720
<i>You always say
we should never stop being curious.</i>

395
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,730
To always open any curiosity door we find.

396
00:25:58,810 --> 00:25:59,850
Dustin...

397
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,560
Why are you keeping
this curiosity door locked?

398
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,400
Uh-huh.

399
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,450
Uh-huh. How much?

400
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,410
Uh-huh.

401
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,490
Yep, all right.
Yeah, we'll be careful.

402
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,200
Definitely.
All right, Mr. Clarke.

403
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,556
Yeah, I'll see you on Monday.
I'll see you on Monday, Mr. Clarke.

404
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,960
Bye.

405
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,360
Do you still have that kiddie pool
we bobbed for apples in?

406
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,710
- I think so. Yeah.
- Yeah.

407
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,460
Good. Then we just need salt.
Lots of it.

408
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,260
How much is "lots"?

409
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,430
1,500 pounds.

410
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,220
Well, where are we gonna
get that much salt?

411
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,320
Hey, wait.

412
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,370
It's not gonna snow next week, is it?

413
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,530
Worst case, no school.

414
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,330
Even if we find Will in there...

415
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,960
what are we gonna do about that thing?

416
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,330
We're not gonna do anything.

417
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:04,896
I don't want you
anywhere near this, all right?

418
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,340
- Your mom's been through enough already.
- He's my brother.

419
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:10,760
Listen to me.
I'm gonna find him. All right?

420
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,380
You gotta trust me on this.

421
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,180
I am going to find him.

422
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,680
This damn thing is heavy.

423
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,650
Come on.
It's upside down.

424
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,990
No, this way.

425
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,086
- Okay, um...
- How does this even work?

426
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,620
- Try that side.
- Son of a bitch!

427
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,700
- Pull it back. Pull it back.
- I am!

428
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,410
One, two, three.

429
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,830
Shit!

430
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,470
Ah.

431
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,630
Stand back.

432
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,100
Whoa.

433
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,820
What did she even eat?

434
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,530
- What?
- Eleven.

435
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:22,870
Oh.
Candy, leftovers, Eggos...

436
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,210
She really likes Eggos.

437
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,500
I knew you
were acting weird. I just...

438
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,630
I thought it was because of Will.

439
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,590
I knew you were acting weird, too.
I thought it was 'cause of Steve.

440
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,090
Hey...

441
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,010
No more secrets, okay?

442
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,140
From now on we tell each other everything.

443
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,270
Okay. Do you like Jonathan now?

444
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,310
What? No.

445
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:52,070
No, it's... it's not...
it's not like that.

446
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,900
Do you like Eleven?

447
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,320
What? No. Ew. Gross.

448
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:14,500
This will keep it dark for you.

449
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,670
Just like in your bathtub.

450
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,510
You're a very brave girl.

451
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,390
You know that, don't you?

452
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:28,390
Everything you're doing
for my boy... for Will...

453
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,480
for my family...

454
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:35,730
Thank you.

455
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,570
Listen.

456
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,950
I am gonna be there
with you the whole time.

457
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,000
And if it ever gets too scary...

458
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,460
in that place,
you just let me know, okay?

459
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,550
Yes.

460
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,260
Ready?

461
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,220
Ready.

462
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:24,200
Colder!

463
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,450
Warmer!

464
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,250
Right there!

465
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,140
Barb?

466
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,470
Barbara?

467
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,880
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

468
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,880
Is Barb okay?
Is she okay?

469
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,970
Gone! Gone!

470
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,800
Gone!

471
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:35,560
Gone! Gone!

472
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,930
Gone. Gone.

473
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,520
Gone.

474
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,400
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

475
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,770
- Gone. Gone!
- It's okay. It's okay.

476
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,270
Gone!

477
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,110
Hey. It's okay.

478
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,700
It's okay, we're right here.
We're right here, honey.

479
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:53,030
<i>It's okay. I got you.</i>

480
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,950
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

481
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,540
<i>I'm right here with you.</i>

482
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,160
<i>I'm right here with you.</i>

483
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,420
It's okay. It's okay.

484
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,790
<i>It's okay.</i>

485
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,000
<i>It's okay, you're safe.</i>

486
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:08,460
<i>You're okay, honey.</i>

487
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,970
Castle Byers.

488
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,930
Castle Byers.

489
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,380
Will.

490
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:55,300
Will?

491
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,730
You tell him...
tell him I'm coming.

492
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,310
<i>Mom is coming.</i>

493
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,520
Your mom...
she's coming for you.

494
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,530
Hurry.

495
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,150
<i>Hurry.</i>

496
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:17,620
Okay. Listen, you tell him to...
to stay where he is.

497
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,700
We're coming. We're coming, okay?
We're coming, honey.

498
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:23,040
Just... just hold on a little longer.

499
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,210
Will. Will.

500
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,550
Will?

501
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,560
Will!

502
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,270
Oh!

503
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,070
Oh, okay, okay.

504
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,320
I've got you.

505
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,610
It's okay.
I got you. I got you.

506
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,870
I got you, honey.
You did so good.

507
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,330
Are you okay?

508
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,880
So this fort.
Where is it?

509
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,816
Uh, it's in the woods
behind our house.

510
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,250
Yeah, he used to go there to hide.

511
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,260
Hey, get back inside.

512
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,470
What, are you insane?

513
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,906
- No, I'm...
- Look, if something happens to me,

514
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:22,970
I don't make it back...

515
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,770
Yeah, but then I'll go.
You stay.

516
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:25,980
Are you kidding me?

517
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:29,310
He's my son, Hop. My son.

518
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,480
I'm going!

519
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,376
- Now, listen, I need you to stay here...
- No.

520
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,796
- ...and watch over the kids.
- No, Mom.

521
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,716
- I can help.
- Please, I need you to stay, Jonathan.

522
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,740
Joyce!

523
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,020
- Please.
- Please, be careful.

524
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,676
- Joyce, come on!
- Please. I'm gonna find him.

525
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,450
I'm gonna find him.

526
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,820
We have to go back to the station.

527
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,320
What?

528
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:27,830
Your mom and Hopper
are just walking in there like bait.

529
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:31,830
That thing is still in there.

530
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,260
And we can't just sit here
and let it get them, too.

531
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,630
We can't.

532
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,970
You still wanna try it out?

533
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,060
I wanna finish what we started.

534
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,650
I want to kill it.

535
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,700
So this is your plan?

536
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,500
Worked for me before, didn't it?

537
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,790
- Well, did it?
- Come on, trust me.

538
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,066
<i>I'd like to hear
your thoughts on the war.</i>

539
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,146
<i>I think we're dealing with a whole
different environment here.</i>

540
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,896
<i>I'll tell you what,
we always planned</i>

541
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,220
<i>on the Russians massing the fire and we...</i>

542
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,220
Don't move!

543
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,700
All right, move in.

544
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,240
It's all right.

545
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,700
Let me do the talking.

546
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,580
<i>♪ If I go there will be trouble ♪</i>

547
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,630
<i>♪ And if I stay it will be double ♪</i>

548
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:02,420
<i>♪ So, come on and let me know ♪</i>

549
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,550
<i>♪ Should I stay or should I go now? ♪</i>
