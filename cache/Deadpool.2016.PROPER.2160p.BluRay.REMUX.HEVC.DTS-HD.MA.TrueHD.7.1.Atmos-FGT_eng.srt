1
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,559
Kinda lonesome
back here.

2
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,269
Yeah, little help.

3
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:12,025
Okay, um, just, I have to
keep my hands on the wheel.

4
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,570
Excuse me. Whoo!

5
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,698
Ah, Dopinder.

6
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,866
Pool. Dead.

7
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,536
Hmm, nice.

8
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,705
Smells good, no?

9
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,748
Not the Daffodil Daydream.
The girl.

10
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,792
Ah, yes. Gita.

11
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,293
Hmm.
She is quite lovely.

12
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,130
She would have made me
a very agreeable wife.

13
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,381
But, um...

14
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,635
Gita's heart has been stolen
by my cousin Bandhu.

15
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:42,597
He is as dishonorable
as he is attractive.

16
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,809
Dopinder,
I'm starting to think

17
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,728
there's a reason
I'm in this cab today.

18
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,396
Yeah, sir, you called
for it, remember?

19
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:54,151
No, my slender brown friend.
Love is a beautiful thing.

20
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,902
When you find it,
the whole world

21
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,237
tastes like Daffodil Daydream.

22
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,240
So you gotta
hold onto love...

23
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,908
...tight!
Ah.

24
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,326
And never let go.

25
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,911
Don't make
the same mistakes I did.

26
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,163
Got it?
Yeah.

27
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:09,833
Or else the whole world tastes
like Mama June after hot yoga.

28
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,753
Sir, what does
Miss Mama June taste like?

29
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,756
Like two hobos fucking in a
shoe filled with piss. Okay, enough.

30
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,675
I can go all day, Dopinder.
The point is, it's bad!

31
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,510
Hmm, it's bad.

32
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:23,597
Uh, why the fancy
red suit, Mr. Pool?

33
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,682
Oh, that's because
it's Christmas Day, Dopinder.

34
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,268
And I'm after someone
on my naughty list.

35
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,954
I've been waiting one year,
three weeks...

36
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,855
six days and, oh...

37
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,274
14 minutes to make him fix
what he did to me.

38
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,195
And what did he do
to you, Mr. Pool?

39
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,613
This shit...

40
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:41,865
Boo!

41
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:03,887
They won't disappoint.

42
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,306
They'd better not.

43
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,683
And what about
next month's shipment?

44
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,393
There won't be one.

45
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,159
You're not the only one
with a war to win.

46
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,731
That won't do.

47
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,237
See, we've had
this small disruption

48
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,571
to our supply chain...

49
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,661
We'd appreciate your patience.

50
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,414
Okay.

51
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,209
We'll deliver in full
the following month.

52
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:38,951
Pleasure doing
business with you.

53
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,427
Fucking mutant.

54
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,939
Oh, shit!

55
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,440
I forgot my ammo bag.

56
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,900
Shall we turn back?

57
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,026
No, no time.

58
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:01,945
Fuck it. I got this.

59
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,365
9, 10, 11, 12 bullets,
or bust.

60
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,533
Right here!

61
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,912
That's, uh, $27.50.

62
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,765
I... I never carry a
wallet when I'm working.

63
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,249
Ruins the lines
of my suit.

64
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,750
But, uh,

65
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,127
how about
a crisp high five?

66
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,295
Okay.

67
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,629
Merry Christmas.

68
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:24,050
And a convivial Tuesday
in April to you too, Pool!

69
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,554
Hey, yeah
I wanna shoop, baby

70
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,473
Shoop
shooop ba-doop, shoop ba-doop

71
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,475
Shoop ba-doop,
ba-doop, ba-doop

72
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,579
You're packed and you're
stacked "specially in the back

73
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,314
Brother, wanna thank your
mother for a butt like that

74
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,774
Can I get some fries
with that shake-shake boobie?

75
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,985
If looks could kill
you would be an uzi

76
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,570
You're a shotgun, bang!

77
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,654
Wha... Oh!

78
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,491
Oh, hello. I know, right?

79
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,577
Whose balls
did I have to fondle

80
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,329
to get my very own movie?

81
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:53,622
I can't tell you,

82
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,166
but it does rhyme
with "Polverine."

83
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,626
And let me tell you,

84
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,671
he's got a nice pair of
smooth criminals down under.

85
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:06,009
Anyway, I got places to be,
a face to fix and, oh...

86
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,803
Bad guys to kill.

87
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,477
Maximum effort.

88
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,363
Cock shot.

89
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,369
Ha!

90
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,206
Rich Corinthian leather.

91
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,001
I'm looking for Francis!

92
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,212
Have you seen this man?

93
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,297
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

94
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,721
Ow. Ow!

95
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,223
Yanky, yanky!

96
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,091
I've never said this,
but don't swallow.

97
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,947
Shit.

98
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,575
Did I leave the stove on?

99
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,427
Now, breaking news.

100
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,804
A multi-car collision
turned shots fired

101
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,488
on the crosstown expressway
this morning.

102
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,767
Gridlock has kept
police from the scene.

103
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,561
Residents are advised
to remain in their homes.

104
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,146
The assailant
appears to be armed,

105
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,647
dangerous, and wearing...

106
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,149
a red suit.
A red suit.

107
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,068
Deadpool.

108
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,653
Negasonic!
Come, we have mission.

109
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,115
Colossus, wait up.

110
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,494
I've given Deadpool
every chance to join us...

111
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,829
but he'd rather
act like a child.

112
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,248
A heavily-armed child.

113
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:46,169
When will he grow up and see
benefits of becoming X-Man?

114
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,129
Which benefits?
The matching unitards?

115
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,173
The house that blows up
every few years?

116
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,341
Please.

117
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,802
House blowing up
builds character.

118
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,137
You ate breakfast, yes?

119
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,431
Breakfast is most
important meal of day.

120
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:03,520
Here, protein bar.
Good for bones.

121
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,022
Deadpool may try
to break yours.

122
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,990
Get out of the way!

123
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,884
Hey! Whoo!

124
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,313
Wait!

125
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,732
You may be wondering,
"Why the red suit?"

126
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,734
Well, that's so bad guys
can't see me bleed.

127
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,102
This guy's got the right idea.

128
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,738
He wore the brown pants.

129
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,868
Fine!
I only have 12 bullets...

130
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,578
SO you're gonna
have to share!

131
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,413
Let's count them down.

132
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,933
Shit.

133
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,688
Motherfucker!

134
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,107
10! Shit!

135
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,775
Nine. Fuck.

136
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,235
Eight.

137
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,278
Shit-fuck!

138
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,283
Bad Deadpool.

139
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,912
Seven.
Good Deadpool.

140
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,800
Oh!

141
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,728
Someone's not counting. Six.

142
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,832
Oh!

143
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,506
Four...

144
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,009
Gotcha.

145
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:42,929
Right up main street.

146
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,976
Three, two!

147
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,936
Stupid! Worth it.

148
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,169
Ah!

149
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,339
I'm touching myself tonight.

150
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,300
Francis!

151
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:21,884
Francis...

152
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,055
What the shit-biscuit!

153
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,890
Where you at,
Francis?

154
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:37,900
You're not Francis.

155
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,369
Really?
Rolling up the sleeves?

156
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,089
You're
probably thinking,

157
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,067
"My boyfriend said
this was a superhero movie...

158
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,691
“but that guy in the red suit
just turned

159
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,928
"that other guy
into a fucking kabab!"

160
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:10,516
Well, I may be super,
but I'm no hero.

161
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,935
And yeah, technically,
this is a murder.

162
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,271
But some of the best love
Stories start with a murder.

163
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,399
And that's exactly
what this is, a love story.

164
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:19,859
And to tell it right...

165
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,111
I gotta take you back
to long before

166
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,739
I squeezed this ass
into red spandex.

167
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,284
Look, would it help
if I slow it down for you?

168
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,787
I didn't order the pizza.

169
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,707
Is this 7348 Red Ledge Drive?
Are you Mr. Merchant?

170
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,752
Yeah, the Mr. Merchant who
didn't order the fucking pie!

171
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,295
Then who placed the call?

172
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,255
I did!

173
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,926
Pineapple and olive?

174
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,262
Sweet and salty.

175
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,555
The fuck are you?

176
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,557
The fuck you doing
in my crib...

177
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:52,767
Is it burnt crust?

178
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,644
I... God,
I hope not. Um...

179
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,622
Whoa... Man, look, if this
is about that poker game.

180
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,940
I told Howie,
I told him that...

181
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:02,944
Okay, uh, look,
just take whatever you want.

182
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,112
Thanks.

183
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,423
Sir, before you do
anything to him,

184
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,657
do you mind
if I get a big tip?

185
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,952
Uh, Jeremy, is it?

186
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,495
Umm-hmm.
Wade. Wade Wilson.

187
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,624
That is a no go
on the tiperoo, Jer.

188
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,167
I'm not here for him.

189
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,128
I'm here for you.

190
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,587
Oh.

191
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,551
Okay, wow, dodged a
big-time bullet on that one.

192
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,591
Not out of the woods yet.

193
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,511
You need to seriously ease up
on the bedazzling.

194
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,513
They're jeans,
not a chandelier.

195
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,908
P.S. I'm keeping your wallet.
You did kinda give it to me.

196
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,785
Okay, just look, man,
can I have my Sam's card...

197
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,103
I will shoot your fucking cat!

198
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,314
I don't really know what
that means. I don't have a cat.

199
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,358
Then whose Kitty litter
did I just shit in?

200
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,656
Anyhoo, tell me something...

201
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:52,368
what situation
isn't improved by pizza?

202
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,829
Do you happen to know
a Meghan Orflosky?

203
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,497
Getting that right?
Orflosky?

204
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,875
Orlovsky? Yeah? Good.

205
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,377
Because she knows you.

206
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,671
Jeremy, I belong
to a group of guys

207
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,840
who take a dime
to beat a fella down.

208
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,359
And little Meghan,
she's not made of money,

209
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,676
but lucky for her...

210
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,052
I got a soft spot.

211
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,722
But I'm a...
A stalker.

212
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,682
Threats hurt, Jer.

213
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:18,227
Though not nearly as badly
as serrated steel.

214
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,397
So keep away
from Meghan.

215
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,482
Cool?

216
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,691
Yes, sir.

217
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:24,734
Then we're done.

218
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,195
Wait.
We are?

219
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,905
Yeah. We're totally done.

220
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,073
You should've
seen your face.

221
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,676
I didn't know what to do.
I was so scared.

222
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,743
Soft spot, remember?

223
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,330
You even look in her
general direction again...

224
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,933
and you will learn
in the worst of ways

225
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,083
that I have
some hard spots too.

226
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,504
That came out wrong.

227
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:46,839
Or did it?

228
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,020
Mmm... Meghan?

229
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,910
You've heard the last
of Jeremy. He's sorry.

230
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,277
No frigging way.

231
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,343
Should've brought
my roller blades.

232
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,785
Show these kids
how it's done.

233
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,205
Oh. And that's why we do it.
But mostly the money.

234
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,290
Hey, think you could
fuck up my step-dad?

235
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:22,917
I give a guy
a pavement facial,

236
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,079
it's because he's earned it.

237
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:25,962
Hey, wait!

238
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,881
You're my hero.

239
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,467
No-no-no-no.
That I ain't!

240
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,596
Nope. Never will be.

241
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,598
Oh. Fuck you, Wade.

242
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,143
I'm just a bad guy who gets
paid to fuck up worse guys.

243
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,438
Welcome to Sister Margaret's.

244
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,607
It's like a job fair
for mercenaries.

245
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,363
Think of us as really
fucked up tooth fairies...

246
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,988
except we knock out the teeth
and take the cash.

247
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:55,116
You'd best hope we never see
your name on a gold card.

248
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,993
Buck! Liefeld...

249
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,411
Hey, Wade!

250
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,972
Wade Wilson, patron
saint of the pitiful.

251
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,330
What can I do for you?

252
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,124
I'd love a Blow Job.

253
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,500
Oh, God, me too.

254
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,752
The drink, moose knuckle.
But first...

255
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,440
Hey, and I ain't taking any
babysitting money, all right?

256
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,091
Make sure
that gets back to Ms...

257
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,175
Orlovsky.

258
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:14,302
Yeah, her.

259
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,636
You sure?
Hmm.

260
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,306
You know, for a merc,
you're pretty warm-blooded.

261
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,266
I bet you let
the kid off easy, too.

262
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,184
Oh, he's not a bad kid, Weas.

263
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,519
Just a little light stalking.

264
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,247
I was way worse than him
when I was his age.

265
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,981
I was traveling
to exotic places...

266
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,692
Baghdad, Mogadishu,
Jacksonville,

267
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,628
meeting new and exciting
people. And then, uh...

268
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,529
Killing them. Yeah,
I've seen your Instagram.

269
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:36,198
So what was Special Forces
doing in Jacksonville, anyway?

270
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:37,867
That's classified.

271
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,036
They have
a wonderful TGI Fridays.

272
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,455
All right,
Kahlua, Baileys and...

273
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,789
whipped cream.

274
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,000
I give you a Blow Job.

275
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,877
Why do you
make me make that?

276
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,712
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly...

277
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,172
Take that over
to Buck please,

278
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,174
and tell him it's from
Boothe. Little foreplay.

279
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,509
Remind me what good
will come of this?

280
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,553
I don't take the shits.
I just disturb them.

281
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,971
Boothe!
Oh!

282
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,222
Easy, man.
Hold up! Hold up!

283
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,307
What you want?

284
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,395
- Cheers. To your health.
- Fuck you.

285
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,023
Come here,
you fat fuck!

286
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,566
That's a new stool.

287
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,906
Stay the fuck down.

288
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,243
Whoa! Took his ass out!

289
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,079
All right, move.
Move, move, move.

290
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,246
Buck, go rest.

291
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:26,916
Boothe got hit
then went down.

292
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,255
Yeah, he's still breathing.

293
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,510
Nobody wins today.

294
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,261
Nice try, Wade.

295
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,430
You got me. I picked
Boothe in the dead pool.

296
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,890
Who did you pick?

297
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,934
Yeah, Wade,
about that, um...

298
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:46,227
No.

299
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,437
You did not bet
on me to die.

300
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,442
You bet on me to die. Wow!

301
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,326
Motherfucker, you're
the world's worst friend.

302
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,571
Well, joke's on you.
I'm living to 102.

303
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,740
And then dying.
Like the city of Detroit.

304
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,743
I'm sorry. I just...
I wanted to win money.

305
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,120
I never win anything.

306
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,246
Whatever.

307
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,914
Soldiers of fortune,
drinks on me!

308
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,252
Domestic, nothing imported.

309
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,214
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa...

310
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:19,218
Baby, are you sure you wanna
shoot your whole wad?

311
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,471
Uh... Tight.

312
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,100
Vanessa.
Wade.

313
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,602
What's a nice place like you
doing in a girl like this?

314
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,230
I'd hit that.

315
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,316
Buck, you best
apologize before...

316
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,652
Yeah, that.

317
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,487
Say the magic words,
Fat Gandalf.

318
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,322
I'm sorry.
Breathe through the nose.

319
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,658
I don't have a filter
between my brain and my...

320
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,660
Let go. Okay.
Hey, oh, oh, oh...

321
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:45,804
Hakuna his tatas.
He's sorry.

322
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,079
I'm working on it.

323
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,248
Get out of here.
Go. Go cast a spell.

324
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:52,251
Hey. Hands off
the merchandise.

325
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,087
Merchandise? Huh...

326
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,673
So you, uh...

327
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,175
bump fuzzies for money?

328
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,302
Rough childhood?
Yep.

329
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,344
Rougher than yours.

330
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,013
Daddy left before
I was born.

331
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,182
Daddy left before
I was conceived.

332
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,073
Ever had a cigarette
put out on your skin?

333
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,436
Where else do you
put one out?

334
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,771
I was molested.

335
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,522
Me too. Uncle.

336
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,858
Uncles. They took turns.

337
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,526
I watched my own
birthday party

338
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,837
through the keyhole
of a locked closet...

339
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,196
which also happens to be my...

340
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,115
Your bedroom. Lucky.
I slept in a dishwasher box.

341
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,201
You had a dishwasher.

342
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,702
I didn't even know sleep.

343
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,662
It was pretty much
24/7 ball gags,

344
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,164
brownie mix and clown porn.

345
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,461
Who would do such a thing?

346
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,549
Hopefully you, later tonight?

347
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:48,349
Hey, what can I get for,
uh, $275 and a...

348
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,227
a Yogurtland rewards card?

349
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,896
Baby, about 48 minutes of
whatever the fuck you want.

350
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,149
And a low-fat dessert.

351
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,242
Did she just put a gift card
in your mouth?

352
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,829
It's time to put
balls in holes.

353
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,414
You said whatever I want.

354
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,083
I get it.

355
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,043
You love skee ball.

356
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,379
Apparently more than
you love vagina.

357
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,714
That's a tough call.

358
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,050
I just wanna get to
know the real you, you know.

359
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,052
Not the short-shorted,
two-dimensional

360
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,012
sex object
peddled by Hollywood.

361
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,097
Balls in holes.

362
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,266
Balls in holes.

363
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,767
Prepare to lose tragically.

364
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:32,935
Bring it, big man.

365
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,061
Okay.

366
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,606
Uh-oh.

367
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,191
Uh-oh.

368
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:41,777
The limited edition

369
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,780
Defender of
the Universe ring, por favor.

370
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,741
Okay. Here we go.

371
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,786
Had my eye on
this sucker for a while.

372
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,705
And I will take
the pencil eraser.

373
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,206
Okay.

374
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,084
You are now the protector
of the planet Arus.

375
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,086
And you can erase stuff...

376
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:00,462
written in pencil.

377
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,256
M'lady?

378
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:03,608
Well, I hate to
break it to you...

379
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,467
but your 48 minutes
are up.

380
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,804
Hey, how many more minutes
can I get for this?

381
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,307
FYI, five mini lion-bots
come together

382
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,392
to form one super-bot, so...

383
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,770
Five mini lion-bots?
Three minutes.

384
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:17,855
Deal.

385
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,190
What do we do with the
remaining two minutes, 37 seconds?

386
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:21,984
Cuddle?

387
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,907
How long can you
keep this up?

388
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,158
All year?

389
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,670
Happy Valentine's Day.

390
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,971
Happy Chinese New Year.

391
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,348
Year of the Dog.

392
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,687
Relax.

393
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,440
And Happy
International Women's Day.

394
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:09,031
No. No. No.

395
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,534
Happy Lent.

396
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,706
Ow, ow.

397
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,041
Wade?
Sorry.

398
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,542
Happy Halloween.

399
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:21,710
Happy Halloween.

400
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:33,222
Happy Thanksgiving.

401
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,392
I love you.

402
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,231
If your left leg
is Thanksgiving...

403
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:44,024
and your right leg
is Christmas...

404
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,860
can I visit you
between the holidays?

405
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:48,737
Oh!

406
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,572
That sweater is terrible.

407
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,242
But red looks good on you.

408
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,368
Red's your color.

409
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,245
Brings out the bloodshot
in your eyes.

410
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,306
Listen,
I've been thinking...

411
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,331
Really?

412
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,834
...about why we're
so good together.

413
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,252
Why's that?

414
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:07,840
Well, your crazy matches
my crazy. Big time.

415
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,425
Hmm.

416
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,593
And, uh, we're like
two jigsaw pieces,

417
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,039
you know,
the weird curvy edges...

418
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,723
You put them together and
you can see the picture on top.

419
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:17,599
Right.

420
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,268
Wade...

421
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,438
there's something I've been
meaning to ask you.

422
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:25,065
But only because you haven't
gotten around to asking me.

423
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,277
Will you, uh...

424
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,405
stick it in my...
Marry me?

425
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,409
Uh... Jinx?

426
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:36,452
Huh.

427
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:38,454
Where were you
hiding that?

428
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,580
Nowhere.

429
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,249
They say one month's salary.
So, uh...

430
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,292
You mean?

431
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,376
I do.

432
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,461
That's my line.

433
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,466
I love you, Wade Wilson.

434
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,694
You're supposed to...
So that's a...

435
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,136
Whoo!
Yes!

436
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:55,971
Yes!

437
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,600
I feel just like
a little girl.

438
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,274
What if I just held on
and never let go?

439
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:09,943
Just ride a bitch's back,
like Yoda on Luke.

440
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,321
Oh, Star Wars jokes.

441
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,073
Empire.

442
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:16,784
Jesus Christ.

443
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,786
It's like I made you
in a computer.

444
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,580
Mmm.

445
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:23,999
Hey.

446
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,502
Perfect.

447
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,799
Let's see.
All right, wee break.

448
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,133
Shake it, yeah.

449
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:40,516
Here's the thing.

450
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,810
Life is an endless series
of train-wrecks...

451
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:46,438
with only brief, commercial-like
breaks of happiness.

452
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:50,025
This had been the ultimate
commercial break.

453
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,862
Which meant
it was time to return

454
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,697
to our regularly
scheduled program.

455
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,658
What the...

456
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,826
Oh, my God. Wade?

457
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,375
You're clowning.

458
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,210
You're not clowning?

459
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,461
I sense clowns.

460
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:13,382
People react to news of
late-stage cancer differently.

461
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:16,343
There are certainly options
we can look into.

462
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,178
New drugs are being
developed every day.

463
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,851
So what do we do?

464
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,728
Surely there is
something we can do.

465
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:30,399
My uncle Ivan was diagnosed
with thyroid cancer...

466
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,924
and there were all these new
experimental drugs from Germany.

467
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,571
Vanessa's already
working on Plan A, B,

468
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,364
all the way through Z.

469
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:41,201
Me? I'm memorizing
the details of her face.

470
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:44,246
Like it's the first time
I'm seeing it.

471
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,414
Or the last.

472
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,999
Mr. Wilson...

473
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,500
Mr. Wilson?

474
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:51,170
Take your time
to process this.

475
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,089
It's important not to
do anything rash.

476
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,270
Now, if I were
a 200-pound sack

477
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,898
of assholes named Francis,
where would I hide?

478
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:15,777
Oh.

479
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,217
A hush falls
over the crowd

480
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,636
as rookie sensation
Wade W. Wilson...

481
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:44,139
out of Regina, Saskatchewan,
lines up the shot.

482
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,643
His form looks good.

483
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,645
Oh!

484
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:53,565
And that's why Regina
rhymes with fun.

485
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,485
Ladies and gentlemen,
what you're witnessing...

486
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,820
is sweet dick-kicking revenge.

487
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,281
Oh! Giving him the business.

488
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,783
Incoming!

489
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:07,663
This is taking unsportsmanlike
conduct to a whole new level!

490
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,962
Looking good, Francis.
Well rested.

491
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,672
Like you've been pitching,
not catching.

492
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,174
Ringing any bells? No?

493
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,430
How about now?

494
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,603
Wade fucking Wilson.

495
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,357
Well,
hello, gorgeous.

496
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,360
Yeah, like I got bit
by a radioactive Shar-Pei.

497
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,655
Yeah. And whose fault
is that, huh, Francis?

498
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,737
Yeah, time to undo what
you did to this butter face.

499
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,492
Please,
you should thank me.

500
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:46,785
Apparently,
I made you immortal.

501
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,704
I'm actually
quite jealous.

502
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,039
Yeah, but this ain't a
life worth living, is it?

503
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,835
Now, I'm about
to do to you

504
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,212
what Limp Bizkit did
to music in the late 90s.

505
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:00,382
Dad?

506
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,555
I think we can all agree
that shit just went sideways

507
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,473
in the most colossal way.

508
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,476
Well, maybe not the most.

509
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:15,731
Uh... This is
my most prized possession.

510
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,357
Wham?

511
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,234
No, no, no. Wham!

512
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:23,196
Make It Big is the album that George
and Andy earned the exclamation point.

513
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,866
So, am I supposed
to just smile

514
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,200
and wave you out the door?

515
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,702
Think of it like
spring cleaning.

516
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,078
Only if spring
was death.

517
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,581
God, if I had a nickel
for every time

518
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,166
I spanked it to
Bernadette Peters.

519
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,626
Sounds like you do.

520
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:39,296
Bernadette is not
going anywhere,

521
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,298
because you're not
going anywhere.

522
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:42,424
Drink.

523
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,027
You're right. Cancer
is only in my liver,

524
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,302
lungs, prostate, and brain.

525
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:46,595
All things I can
live without.

526
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:48,889
Ha.

527
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,932
You belong here
at home.

528
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,434
Surrounded by
your Voltron

529
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,603
and your Bernadette,
and your me.

530
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:59,441
Listen, we both know
that cancer is a shit-show.

531
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,153
Like, a Yakov-Smirnoff-
opening-for-the

532
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,989
Spin-Doctors- at-the-
Iowa-State-Fair shit-show.

533
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:12,662
And under no circumstances
will I take you to that show.

534
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,665
I want you to remember me.

535
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,960
Not the ghost
of Christmas me.

536
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:20,837
Well, I wanna remember us.

537
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:22,982
I swear to God, I will
find you in the next life...

538
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:26,093
and I'm gonna boom-box Careless
Whisper outside your window.

539
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:27,636
Wham!

540
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:34,017
No one is boom-boxing shit.
Okay?

541
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:38,021
We can fight this.

542
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:43,360
Besides, I just
realized something.

543
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:46,530
You win.
Your life is officially

544
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:49,324
way more fucked up
than mine.

545
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,704
I love you.

546
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:07,551
Wade.

547
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,887
Weas.

548
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,515
You look like you need
a Blow Job and a shower.

549
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,684
Though courtesy calls
for the latter first.

550
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,352
How about three shots
of Patron?

551
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:21,189
Or how about Triticum
aestivum, wheat grass.

552
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:22,566
Excellent for
the immune system.

553
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,693
Jesus Christ.
You sound like Vanessa.

554
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:25,902
Here, check it out.

555
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:29,364
She's sending away for all
these colorful clinic brochures.

556
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,241
I'm sure they're
all FDA approved.

557
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,578
Chechnya. Isn't that where
you go to get cancer?

558
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:37,497
You got China
and Central Mexico.

559
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,083
You know how they
say "cancer" in Spanish?

560
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,251
No.

561
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,545
El Cancer.
Oh.

562
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,422
I could have
guessed that.

563
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,340
Look how happy
you look here.

564
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,050
Mind if I keep this?
Put it up,

565
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,511
so I can remember
when you looked alive.

566
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:53,889
At least now I'm gonna
win the dead pool.

567
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:56,683
Now that you're gonna die
tragically of cancer.

568
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,560
I got it, Weas. Thanks.

569
00:32:58,602 --> 00:32:59,728
Oh.

570
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,690
And, uh, that guy over there
came in looking for you.

571
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:06,568
Real Grim Reaper type.

572
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,612
I don't know.
Might further the plot.

573
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:13,742
Boothe.

574
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:14,951
Wade.

575
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:21,249
Mr. Wilson.

576
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,918
How can I help you?

577
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,587
Besides luring children
into a panel van.

578
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:29,299
I understand you've recently been
diagnosed with terminal cancer.

579
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,550
Stalker alert.

580
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,761
It's my job.
Recruitment.

581
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,931
I'm sorry you've had
such a tough go.

582
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:39,142
But you're a fighter.
Special Forces.

583
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,728
41 confirmed kills.

584
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,605
One every seven weeks.

585
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,982
Same rate most folks
get a haircut. Hmm...

586
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:47,984
It's to wash
the taste out.

587
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:51,154
It's tough to forget
being so impressive.

588
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,490
And now you
spend your days

589
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,492
sticking up for
the little people...

590
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,160
People change.
What do you want?

591
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:00,664
I represent an organization
that may be able to help.

592
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:06,294
What if I told you
we can cure your cancer?

593
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:11,007
And what's more, give you
abilities most men only dream of?

594
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:16,471
I'd say that you sound
like an infomercial,

595
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,682
but not a good one,
like Slap Chop.

596
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,350
More Shake Weight-y.

597
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:23,478
The world needs
extraordinary soldiers.

598
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,647
We won't just
make you better.

599
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:28,692
We will make you
better than better.

600
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:30,986
A superhero.

601
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:34,155
Look, Agent Smith,

602
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,324
I tried the hero business
and it left a mark.

603
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:39,369
But if I ever hit "fuck it,"
I'll look you up.

604
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,329
Oh, um...

605
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,430
Shit. We're within
500 yards of a school,

606
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,666
SO you may wanna...

607
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:50,880
His drink's on him.

608
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,305
What did he say?

609
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,537
Hey, what's going on?

610
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:25,040
Hey. Sorry.

611
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,501
I had a Liam Neeson
nightmare.

612
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,879
I dreamt I kidnapped
his daughter

613
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,547
and he just
wasn't having it.

614
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:44,434
Hey, uh, they've made
three of those movies.

615
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:48,605
At some point you have to
wonder if he's just a bad parent.

616
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,731
Hmm.

617
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:06,623
The worst part about
cancer isn't what it does to you...

618
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,918
but what it does to
the people you love.

619
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,754
Who knew if this guy
could save my life...

620
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,465
but I knew there was only one
way that I could save hers.

621
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:21,930
Isn't that what
superheroes do?

622
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:38,321
Okay. Let's pro-con
this superhero thing.

623
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,118
They pull down
a gaggle of ass.

624
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:44,619
Local dry cleaning discounts.

625
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,454
Lucrative film deals,
both origin stories

626
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:48,623
and larger ensemble
team movies.

627
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,543
They're all lame-ass
teacher's pets.

628
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,628
You know,
I can hear you.

629
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,589
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to them.

630
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,341
Stay right here.

631
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,094
You've been
warned before, Deadpool.

632
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:04,973
This is a shameful and
reckless use of your powers.

633
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,142
You will both
be coming with us.

634
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,018
Look, Colossus,
I don't have time for

635
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:11,146
the goody two-shoes
bullshit right now!

636
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,106
And you are?

637
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:16,484
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

638
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:19,988
Negasonic Teenage...
What the shit?

639
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,865
That's the coolest name ever!

640
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,994
So, what, you're like,
uh, his sidekick?

641
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,495
No. Trainee.

642
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,997
Let me guess.

643
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:31,541
X-Men left you behind
on what? Shit detail?

644
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,709
What does that make you?

645
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,170
Pretending you're not here,
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

646
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:36,504
Can we trade names?

647
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,173
Can we go?

648
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,550
Look!
I'm a teenage girl.

649
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,844
I'd rather be
anywhere than here.

650
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:45,054
I'm all about
long sullen silences...

651
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,641
followed by mean comments,
followed by more silences.

652
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:52,312
So what's it gonna be, huh?
Long sullen silence...

653
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,898
or mean comment? Go on.

654
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,358
You got me in a box here.

655
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:58,526
Aha!

656
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,528
We can't allow this,
Deadpool.

657
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,030
Please, come quietly.

658
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,365
You big chrome
cock-gobbler!

659
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,408
That's not nice.

660
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,052
You're really gonna
fuck this up for me?

661
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:11,706
Trust me, that wheezing bag
of dick-tips has it coming.

662
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:14,334
He's pure evil.

663
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:18,004
Besides...
Nobody's getting hurt.

664
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,428
That guy was already up there
when I got here.

665
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,556
Wade, you are
better than this.

666
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,226
Join us.
Use your powers for good.

667
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,268
Heads up.

668
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,603
Be a superhero.

669
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,729
Listen!

670
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:37,131
The day I decide to become
a crime-fighting shit-swizzler...

671
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:40,568
who rooms with a bunch of other
little whiners at the Neverland mansion...

672
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:45,448
of some creepy, old, bald,
Heaven's Gate-looking motherfucker...

673
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,283
on that day...

674
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,577
I'll send your shiny,
happy ass a friend request.

675
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,121
But until then, I'mma do
what I came here to do.

676
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,916
Either that or slap
the bitch outta you!

677
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,251
Wade...
Hey.

678
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,418
Zip it, Sinéad!

679
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:58,545
Hey, douche-pool!

680
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,921
And I hope
you're watching...

681
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:06,427
Quite unfortunate.

682
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:12,058
That does it!

683
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,477
Oh!

684
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:17,814
Canada!

685
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,108
That's not good.

686
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,276
Wade, please.

687
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,820
Cock shot!

688
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,947
Oh, your poor wife.

689
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,824
You really should stop.

690
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,830
All the dinosaurs
feared the T. rex.

691
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,628
I promise this gets
worse for you, big boy!

692
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,630
This is embarrassing.

693
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:44,465
Please, stay down.

694
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,987
You ever hear of the
one-legged man in the ass-kicking contest?

695
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,470
Do you have
off switch?

696
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,139
Yeah, it's right next
to the prostate.

697
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:52,307
Or is that the on switch?

698
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,475
Enough!

699
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,861
Let us go talk
to the Professor.

700
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,155
McAvoy or Stewart?

701
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,449
These timelines
are so confusing.

702
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,369
"Dead or alive,
you're coming with me!"

703
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,038
You will
recover, Wade.

704
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,831
You always do.

705
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:24,881
You ever see 127 Hours?
Spoiler alert.

706
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:29,719
Oh, my God.

707
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:30,887
Nasty.

708
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,350
Oh, there's
the money shot, baby.

709
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,519
Are You There God?
It's Me, Margaret.

710
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,908
Rock, meet bottom.

711
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:55,411
And when life ends up
breathtakingly fucked...

712
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:59,874
you can generally trace it
back to one big, bad decision.

713
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:03,169
The one that sent you
down the road to Shitsburgh.

714
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:06,005
This? Well, this was mine.

715
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,257
Mr. Wilson.

716
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:14,180
Nothing warms my heart more
than a change of someone else's.

717
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,932
You finally hit "fuck it."

718
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,102
Just promise
you'll do right by me.

719
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:21,771
So I can do right
by someone else.

720
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,064
Of course.

721
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,566
And please don't make
the super-suit green.

722
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:28,277
Or animated.

723
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:36,411
Move it! Keep moving.

724
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,591
This place seems sanitary.

725
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,594
My first request
is warmer hands.

726
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:57,432
Oh! And, Jesus,
a warmer table.

727
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:01,144
We should really come up
with a safe word, fellas.

728
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,104
I'm thinking
"pork and beans."

729
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,609
Easy.

730
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,822
Aren't you a little
strong for a lady?

731
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:14,991
I'm calling wang.

732
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,121
What's up with the matches?

733
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:23,124
Oral fixation
or just a big Stallone fan?

734
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:25,960
Patience, Angel.

735
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,504
All in good time.

736
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,631
Are you here for the turn
down service, or what?

737
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:33,301
We have another talker.

738
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,320
I'm just excited about my
first day at superhero camp.

739
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,513
Shut the fuck up.

740
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,769
Mr. Wilson, my name's Ajax.

741
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,855
I manage this workshop.

742
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:50,193
Ah, my welcome speech used to
be full of euphemisms like...

743
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:51,778
"This may hurt a little."

744
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,821
"This may cause you
some discomfort."

745
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,199
But I've grown blunt.

746
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,868
This workshop is not
a government-led program.

747
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:02,538
It's a private institution that turns
reclamation projects like yourself...

748
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:06,000
into men of
extraordinary abilities.

749
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:10,880
But if you think super-human
powers are acquired painlessly...

750
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,216
Wrong.

751
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:14,842
I'm injecting you
with a serum...

752
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:17,553
that activates any mutant
genes lurking in your DNA.

753
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:21,557
For it to work we need to
subject you to extreme stress.

754
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:30,233
You've heard that whole "make an
omelet, break some eggs" bit, right?

755
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,527
I'm about to hurt you, Wade.

756
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,197
I was a patient here once
myself, you know.

757
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,242
The treatment affects
everyone differently.

758
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,411
It made Angel
inhumanly strong.

759
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:46,749
In my case,
it enhanced my reflexes.

760
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:50,211
Also scorched my nerve
endings, so I no longer feel pain.

761
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:55,758
And, in fact,
I no longer feel anything.

762
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:07,061
Thanks! Thank you. Thank you.

763
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,105
You have something
in your teeth.

764
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,233
Right in the middle there.
Just, I don't...

765
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:15,361
A little nugget of romaine
lettuce or something.

766
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,615
It's been bothering me
for a long time.

767
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:22,118
Ah, made you look.

768
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,078
Hey, is Ajax
your actual name?

769
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,872
Because it sounds
suspiciously made up.

770
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,039
What is it, really?

771
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,375
Kevin? Bruce? Scott?

772
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,043
Mitch? The Rickster?

773
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,296
Is it Basil Fawlty?

774
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,131
Oh, joke away.

775
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:36,942
One thing that never
survives this place

776
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:38,467
is a sense of humor.

777
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:40,094
We'll see about that.

778
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,596
I suppose we will.

779
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:44,557
He's all yours.

780
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:45,600
Oh, come on.

781
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:47,768
You're gonna leave me
all alone here

782
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,437
with less-angry
Rosie O'Donnell?

783
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,902
This is how
it's going to work.

784
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,946
Adrenaline acts as a catalyst
for the serum...

785
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:02,116
SO we're going
to have to make you suffer.

786
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,786
If you're lucky,
the mutant genes will activate

787
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:08,664
and manifest in
a spectacular fashion.

788
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,796
If not, well, we'll
have to keep on hurting you...

789
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:18,841
In new and different ways,

790
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,343
each more painful
than the last...

791
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:25,348
until you finally mutate.

792
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,184
Or die.

793
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:36,651
You mean a bucket list?

794
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,986
Like a fuck-it list.

795
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:40,321
I'd really like
to light a spliff

796
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:41,697
off the Olympic torch.

797
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:44,158
Pass it
to me right after.

798
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,662
Let's not forget naked
tandem base-jumping

799
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:50,164
with the WNBA's
Sacramento Monarchs.

800
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:54,335
Anything on my bucket list
would involve public nudity.

801
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,713
Finally, giving Meredith
Baxter-Birney a Dutch oven.

802
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:01,175
No. Receiving a Dutch oven
from Meredith Baxter-Birney.

803
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:09,225
Making banana pancakes
for my kids.

804
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:14,730
Vanessa.

805
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:20,569
I wanna see Vanessa.

806
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,029
You're lovely.

807
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:25,491
I don't know about
anyone else, but I'm touched.

808
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:26,534
We were just joking.

809
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,911
No, no. It's okay.

810
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,747
I encourage distractions.

811
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,875
Wouldn't want you giving up
on us, now would we?

812
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,752
Hey, don't take any shit
from him, Cunningham.

813
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,047
How tough can he be...

814
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:43,092
with a name like Francis?

815
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:44,760
Francis?

816
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:46,554
That's his legal name.

817
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:50,599
He got "Ajax"
from the dish soap.

818
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:56,230
F, R, A, N, C, I...

819
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,065
Oops!

820
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,737
Snagged the dry cleaning tag
off your lab coat.

821
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:07,074
FYI, I could probably get you
the superhero discount.

822
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:08,534
You are so
relentlessly annoying.

823
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:09,577
Thanks.

824
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,911
Never heard that before.

825
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:14,206
Why don't you do us all
a favor and shut the fuck up?

826
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,250
Or I'll sew
your pretty mouth shut.

827
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:17,960
Oh...

828
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,628
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

829
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,255
See, here's the problem with

830
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,090
round-the-clock torture...

831
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:26,093
is that you can't really
step it up from there.

832
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:31,098
Is that what you think?

833
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:38,814
If this doesn't unlock
your mutation, then, well...

834
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:40,983
nothing will.

835
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:42,627
Now, what we're going to do is

836
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,403
lower the oxygen
concentration in the air...

837
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:47,114
to the exact point you feel
like you're suffocating.

838
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:48,616
If your brainwaves slow,

839
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,493
meaning you're
about to pass out...

840
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,328
then we'll turn up the O2.

841
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:54,789
If your heart rate slows...

842
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,458
meaning you're able
to catch your breath...

843
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:58,959
we'll turn it back down.

844
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:01,128
And that's where
we'll leave you.

845
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,297
Right there.

846
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:05,925
Oh, and I thought
you guys were dicks before.

847
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,344
You know
the funniest part of this?

848
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,514
You still think we're making
you a superhero.

849
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:15,810
You. A dishonorable discharge.

850
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:18,646
Hip-deep in hookers.

851
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,981
You're nothing.

852
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,359
Little secret, Wade.

853
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:26,028
This workshop
doesn't make superheroes,

854
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,322
we make super-slaves.

855
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,117
We're gonna fit you
with a control collar

856
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,160
and auction you off
to the highest bidder.

857
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,349
Who knows what
they'll have you doing?

858
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:39,542
Terrorizing citizens,
putting down freedom fighters.

859
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,547
Maybe just mow
the occasional lawn.

860
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,550
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

861
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:55,516
You're never going home
after this.

862
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:57,893
Now there's a brave face.

863
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,521
Wait, wait! Wait. Wait.

864
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:06,735
Seriously, you actually have
something in your teeth now.

865
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:10,030
Enjoy your weekend.

866
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:12,074
"Weekend"? Back up.

867
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,367
Weekend?

868
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,119
Did I say
this was a love story?

869
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,622
No, it's a horror movie.

870
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:18,265
Fucking hell.

871
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:21,477
Looks like someone lost his
shot at Homecoming King.

872
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:23,604
What have you done to me?

873
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,248
I've merely raised
your stress levels

874
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,982
high enough
to trigger a mutation.

875
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,318
You sadistic fuck!

876
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,487
I've cured you, Wade.

877
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:33,989
Now your mutated cells
can heal anything.

878
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,826
It's attacking your cancer
as fast as it can form.

879
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,664
Yeah, I've seen similar
side-effects before.

880
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:43,999
I could cure them...

881
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:49,296
but where's the fun in that?

882
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:54,176
Now, I'm gonna
shut you in again, Wade.

883
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,972
Not because I need to.

884
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,644
Because I want to.

885
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,159
Oh, well.

886
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:20,786
Go ahead.

887
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,541
Oh, you smell like shit.

888
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:28,836
Whoa!

889
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:29,878
Motherfucker.

890
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:32,715
Hey, hey, hey. It's
all right, it's all right.

891
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:35,801
I think we owe him
that one, yeah?

892
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:38,220
You take off. Go on.

893
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,347
Off you go.

894
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,027
Quick question.

895
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:57,239
What's my name?

896
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:04,371
Didn't think so.

897
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:09,043
Sorry, Francis.
My lips are sealed.

898
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:06,827
You don't want to kill me.

899
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:09,204
I'm the only one
who can fix your ugly mug.

900
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:07,429
What's my name?

901
00:55:13,602 --> 00:55:14,770
Wade.

902
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:25,173
I didn't just get
the cure to el cancer...

903
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:29,344
I got the cure
to el everything.

904
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:35,142
But there was
only one thing...

905
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:36,977
that really mattered.

906
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,382
Come on, let's go.

907
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:15,515
Oh, that must hurt.

908
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:18,018
Thank you so much.

909
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:32,074
God, he's so fucking gnarly.

910
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:33,575
Look at his face.

911
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,036
Oh, my God. Poor guy.

912
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:37,079
Honey, don't stare.

913
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,413
Freak.

914
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:02,104
No way. I'm not making
her life as ugly as mine.

915
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:04,773
Come on, Wade,
it can't be that bad.

916
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,233
Ah, bullshit!

917
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,569
I'm a monster inside and out.
I belong in a fucking circus.

918
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:12,239
Wade, Vanessa loves you.
She doesn't care what you...

919
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:13,740
Oh! Oh.

920
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,117
Do you like what you see?

921
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:16,410
No.

922
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,412
You look like an avocado

923
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:20,789
had sex with an older,
more disgusting avocado.

924
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:21,915
Yeah.

925
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:24,084
Not gently.
Like it was hate-fucking.

926
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:26,104
There was something wrong
with the relationship...

927
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:27,963
and that was
the only catharsis

928
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,715
that they could find
without violence.

929
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:32,384
And the only guy
who can fix this fugly mug...

930
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:35,095
is the British shit stick
who ran the mutant factory.

931
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:36,972
And he's gone. Poof!

932
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:38,908
Yeah, well you gotta do
something to remedy this...

933
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,058
because as of now,

934
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,810
you only have
one course of action.

935
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:43,103
Damn straight.

936
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:45,063
Find Francis.
Star in horror films.

937
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:46,106
What?

938
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:48,275
Star in your own horror films.

939
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:49,776
Because you look
like Freddy Krueger

940
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:52,279
face-fucked
a topographical map of Utah.

941
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:54,906
Here's what
I'm actually gonna do.

942
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,092
I'm gonna work
through his crew

943
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:57,576
until somebody
gives up Francis...

944
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,995
force him to fix this, then
put a bullet in his skull...

945
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,747
and fuck the brain hole.

946
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,791
I don't wanna see that
or think of it again.

947
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,686
But the douche bag does
thinks you're dead, right?

948
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:07,710
Yeah.

949
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:09,796
That's good.
You should keep it that way.

950
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:11,506
What, like, wear a mask?

951
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:14,509
Yes. A very thick mask.
All the time.

952
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:16,261
I am sorry...

953
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:18,805
you are haunting.

954
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,932
Your face is
the stuff of nightmares.

955
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,309
Like a testicle with teeth.

956
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,102
You will die alone.

957
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:25,812
I mean, if you could die.

958
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:28,356
Ideally, for others' sake.

959
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:29,649
That'll do.

960
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:31,777
All you need now is a suit
and a nickname...

961
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:33,653
like Wade the Wisecracker...

962
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:37,199
or Scaredevil,
Mr. Neverdie.

963
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,159
Oh, shit.

964
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:40,827
What?

965
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,622
I put all my money
on you and now...

966
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,141
I just realized I'm never
gonna win the, uh...

967
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:46,208
Dead pool.

968
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:52,506
Captain Deadpool...

969
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:55,467
No, just...

970
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:57,052
Just Deadpool, yeah.
Just Deadpool.

971
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:59,221
To you, Mr. Pool.

972
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:00,514
Deadpool.

973
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,120
That sounds like
a fucking franchise.

974
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,698
This shit's gonna
have nuts in it.

975
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:20,867
Where's Francis?

976
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,550
Where's Francis?

977
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,893
Seltzer water
and lemon for blood.

978
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:51,064
Or wear red. Dumbass.

979
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,251
Don't make me
ask twice.

980
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:13,920
Where...

981
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:16,256
is Francis?

982
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,466
He made me ask twice.

983
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:20,594
Is the mask muffling my voice?

984
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:26,766
Where's Francis?

985
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:31,271
Where the fuck is Francis?

986
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:43,158
You're about to be killed
by a Zamboni.

987
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:44,576
Where's Francis?

988
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,120
No! Please!

989
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,624
Oh, God! I'm so sorry!

990
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:54,336
Oh! You little
spider monkey!

991
01:01:57,464 --> 01:02:00,926
Where... is... Francis?

992
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,303
This is confusing.

993
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:04,679
Is it sexist to hit you?

994
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:06,306
Is it more sexist
to not hit you?

995
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:08,642
I mean, the line
gets real... blurry.

996
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:10,977
WHERE IS FRANCIS?

997
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,481
Tell me where
your fucking boss is

998
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:15,815
or you're gonna die!

999
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:18,026
In five minutes!

1000
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:29,996
Don't hesitate to call me.

1001
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:47,722
Nice to see you, Jared.

1002
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,350
I'll take the foot long...

1003
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:51,685
Fully loaded.

1004
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:07,200
Whoa, whoa!

1005
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:08,868
41 confirmed kills.

1006
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:11,371
Now it's 89.
About to be 90.

1007
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,206
Mr. Wilson?

1008
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:14,374
Ding-ding.

1009
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:17,377
You're looking
very alive.

1010
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,254
Ha! Only on the outside!

1011
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,524
This is not going to
end well for me, is it?

1012
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:22,858
This is not gonna
end well for you, no.

1013
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,050
Where's your boss?

1014
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:25,677
I can tell you exactly...

1015
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:29,389
Oh, you'll tell me.
But first...

1016
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:32,183
You might wanna
look away for this.

1017
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:33,560
Now this little piggy
went to...

1018
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,897
Thank you, Agent Smith.

1019
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:42,569
Taxi!

1020
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,364
Hop in! Great day for a ride.

1021
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:49,641
And we all know
how this turned out.

1022
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:54,789
Whoops!
You weren't meant to see that.

1023
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:04,591
There. All caught up.

1024
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:14,434
We're here.

1025
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:18,438
Sorry about
bleeding in all your garbage.

1026
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:26,780
Seltzer water and
lemon for blood.

1027
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,281
Whoo!

1028
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:31,493
Some kinds of anger
can't be managed...

1029
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:33,745
like the kind where
your year-long plan

1030
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:36,623
ends with the wrong guy
getting dismembered!

1031
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:40,126
That said, when it comes time
to licking wounds,

1032
01:04:40,168 --> 01:04:41,795
there's no place like home.

1033
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:44,506
Ah, and I share that home
with someone you've met,

1034
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:46,966
the old blind lady
from the laundromat, Al.

1035
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,843
God, I miss cocaine.

1036
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:50,178
Her.

1037
01:04:50,345 --> 01:04:53,973
Fourth-wall break
inside a fourth-wall break.

1038
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,684
That's like 16 walls.

1039
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:58,812
She's like Robin to my Batman,

1040
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:02,524
except she's old,
and black, and blind.

1041
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:04,359
And I think
she's in love with me.

1042
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:08,196
Wait, pretty sure
Robin loves Batman, too.

1043
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:19,207
Al?

1044
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:22,877
Morning, sleepyhead.

1045
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:26,548
It smells like
old lady pants in here.

1046
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:28,508
Yes, I'm old.
I wear pants.

1047
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:30,343
But you're no lady.

1048
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:33,179
Oh! So comfy.

1049
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:36,850
I've never seen you in Croce.

1050
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:38,369
You mean my big,
rubber masturbating shoes?

1051
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:39,519
Yes, I know.

1052
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:42,564
Downside of being blind...

1053
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,899
I hear everything
in this duplex.

1054
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:48,361
Sit on a stick.

1055
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:49,529
Bactin?

1056
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:53,700
Yeah. Bactin should do it.

1057
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:56,536
How's that Kullen
coming along?

1058
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:58,538
IKEA doesn't assemble itself,
you know.

1059
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:01,541
You're telling me.
I don't mind the Kullen.

1060
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:03,585
It's an improvement
on the Hurdal.

1061
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:06,754
Please. Anything's an
improvement over the Hurdal.

1062
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:10,425
I'd have taken an Hemnes
or a Trysil over the Hurdal.

1063
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:13,845
Oh, no, I didn't get excited
till I saw the Kullen.

1064
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:14,929
Screw, please.

1065
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:16,389
Here? Now?
Just kidding.

1066
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:17,724
I know it's been decades.

1067
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:18,892
You'd be surprised.

1068
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:20,727
Pretty grossed out.

1069
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:25,106
Ta... Da.

1070
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:34,073
I wish I never heard
of Craigslist.

1071
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:35,759
And I quote,
"Looking for roommate,

1072
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:37,076
"blind to
life's imperfections.

1073
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:38,244
"Must be good with hands."

1074
01:06:38,286 --> 01:06:40,538
Or would you rather I build
the IKEA, and you pay rent?

1075
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:42,457
Why such a douche
this morning?

1076
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:44,375
Let's recap.

1077
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,586
The cock thistle that
turned me into this freak...

1078
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:48,421
slipped through
my arms today...

1079
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:51,257
Arm.

1080
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:52,902
Catching him was
my only chance

1081
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:54,886
to be hot again,
get my super sexy ex back...

1082
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:57,222
and prevent this shit from
happening to someone else.

1083
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,224
So, yeah,
today was about as much fun

1084
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:00,975
as a sandpaper dildo.

1085
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:04,437
#driveby.

1086
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:23,957
Found out who our friend
in the red suit is.

1087
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,127
Fucking Wade Wilson.

1088
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:31,464
I suppose I'd wear a mask too
if I had a face like that.

1089
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:33,633
I only wish I healed the same.

1090
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:40,306
Still, we'll put him
out of our misery.

1091
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:41,683
On our terms.

1092
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:43,851
Right.
And when he heals?

1093
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:45,853
He can't.

1094
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:48,606
Not if there's nothing
left of him to heal.

1095
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:52,652
You know, it's funny.
I almost miss the fucker.

1096
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:55,488
I like a challenge.

1097
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:58,866
But he's bad
for business.

1098
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:00,785
Now let's go
find him.

1099
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:02,662
Oh.

1100
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:06,541
Tylenol PM?

1101
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:09,210
You can stick that
where you stuck the Bactin.

1102
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:11,879
I raided my stash
of wisdom tooth Percocet...

1103
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:16,050
and I am orbiting
fucking Saturn right now.

1104
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:20,972
But I appreciate the gesture.

1105
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:26,185
Am I crazy, or is your
hand really small?

1106
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,146
About the size of
a KFC spork.

1107
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:29,397
Ugh.

1108
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:32,400
I get why you're so pissy...

1109
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:34,193
but your mood's
never gonna brighten

1110
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:35,403
till you find this woman...

1111
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:36,863
and tell her how you feel.

1112
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:38,573
What do I keep telling you,
Mrs. Magoo?

1113
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:40,241
She wouldn't have me.

1114
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:42,076
If you could see me,
you'd understand.

1115
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:43,244
Looks aren't everything.

1116
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:44,412
Looks are everything.

1117
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:46,539
You ever heard
David Beckham speak?

1118
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:48,750
It's like he mouth-sexed
a can of helium.

1119
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:50,561
You think Ryan Reynolds
got this far

1120
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:52,253
on his superior acting method?

1121
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:53,713
Love is blind, Wade.

1122
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:54,756
No.

1123
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:57,175
You're blind.

1124
01:08:57,842 --> 01:09:00,595
So, you're just gonna
lie there and whimper?

1125
01:09:00,762 --> 01:09:02,865
No, I'm gonna wait till this
arm plows through puberty...

1126
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:03,949
and then I'm gonna
come up with

1127
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,173
a whole new
Christmas Day plan.

1128
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,060
In the meantime,

1129
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:08,519
you might wanna
leave the room.

1130
01:09:09,187 --> 01:09:11,564
I bet it feels huge
in this hand.

1131
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:15,401
Go, go, go.

1132
01:09:16,194 --> 01:09:17,779
So, the doctor says,
"The bad news is

1133
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:19,173
"you don't have
that long to live."

1134
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:20,758
So, the patient says,
"How long do I have?"

1135
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:22,700
The doctor says, "Five."

1136
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:24,369
The guy says, "Five what?"

1137
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:27,580
And the doctor says,
"Four, three, two..."

1138
01:09:35,463 --> 01:09:37,048
Can I help you ladies?

1139
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:40,760
Oh, I do hope so.

1140
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:46,432
I heard you might be
able to point me

1141
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:49,102
in the direction
of a, um, friend of mine.

1142
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:50,645
Name of Wade Wilson.

1143
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:53,231
Sorry.

1144
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:54,941
I don't know the name.

1145
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:04,617
Hey, you're not supposed
to be behind the bar.

1146
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:10,123
I've seen this girl.

1147
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:11,624
Ah, this must be Vanessa.

1148
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:12,834
I've heard so much about you.

1149
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:19,298
Um, sweetheart,
you might wanna look around.

1150
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:22,510
This isn't really the place
to do something like that.

1151
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:25,513
Easy, Angel.

1152
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,098
Put the little man down.

1153
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:30,435
We have everything
we need now.

1154
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:31,853
You sure?

1155
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:35,523
You don't want any clothes
that are not monochromatic?

1156
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:38,359
Have fun at your midnight
showing of Blade II.

1157
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:41,612
Whoo.

1158
01:10:42,029 --> 01:10:43,781
Thanks for having
my back, guys.

1159
01:10:48,786 --> 01:10:51,164
Wade, we have
a fucking problem.

1160
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:53,040
And by "we," I mean "you."

1161
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:55,626
Ah, I can't believe
I'm doing this.

1162
01:10:56,127 --> 01:10:58,838
Is there a word for
half afraid, half angry?

1163
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:01,048
Yeah, "afrangry”,
I guess.

1164
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:03,015
Have you decided what
you're gonna say to her?

1165
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:04,051
Fuck me!

1166
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:06,304
Uh, maybe not
start with that.

1167
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:15,354
Hey, coming onto
our stage right now...

1168
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:17,690
give it up for Chastity!

1169
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:23,738
Or as I like
to call her, Irony.

1170
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:25,907
Better find her fast
before numb nuts does.

1171
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:27,492
How do you know
she's in here?

1172
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:30,745
Because I'm constantly
stalking that fox.

1173
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:59,273
Every time I see her,
it's like the first time...

1174
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:02,276
Especially from this angle.

1175
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:27,051
You can't buy love,

1176
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:29,554
but you can rent it
for three minutes.

1177
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:35,476
Ah, you weak motherfucker!

1178
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:37,270
Come on!

1179
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:39,772
Come on, get it together.

1180
01:12:39,814 --> 01:12:41,816
This isn't about me,
this is about Vanessa.

1181
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:47,280
Here we go.

1182
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:51,492
Maximum effort.

1183
01:12:54,996 --> 01:12:56,122
Vanessa.

1184
01:12:58,666 --> 01:13:00,626
Someone out back
asking for you.

1185
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:02,795
Something about, uh,
an old boyfriend.

1186
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:31,282
I knew it was you.

1187
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:35,036
The weird,
curvy edges.

1188
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:38,456
Like a jigsaw puzzle.

1189
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:50,384
You have Wade Wilson
to thank for this.

1190
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:00,895
Hey. Hey! Where'd she go?

1191
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:02,897
Uh, I saw her
head to the back.

1192
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:04,398
Go get her, tiger.

1193
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:29,715
Fuck. Fuck!

1194
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:34,053
Motherfucker!

1195
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:35,346
Wait, wait.
Let's... Just...

1196
01:14:35,388 --> 01:14:36,389
Cock juggling...

1197
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:37,532
We can talk about
what we're gonna...

1198
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:38,557
Jiminy! Fuck face!

1199
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:39,850
Okay, or you
can hit that.

1200
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:41,727
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Fuck! Fuck!

1201
01:14:41,769 --> 01:14:43,187
No, no.
All right. Hey!

1202
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:44,438
Fuck! Fuck!

1203
01:14:44,939 --> 01:14:45,940
Fuck!
Hey, um...

1204
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:48,943
Whoa! Whoa!
Relax. Relax. Okay.

1205
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:50,430
Okay. I think
that's a good start.

1206
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:52,446
Oh, I'm gonna rip
his motherfucking...

1207
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:53,572
Wait.

1208
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:55,199
Find it! Find it.
What?

1209
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:56,681
I'm gonna get angry.
Okay. All right.

1210
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:58,744
All right. Okay. All right.

1211
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:00,121
Here. This is Vanessa.

1212
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:02,206
What?
No, wait. It's Francis.

1213
01:15:02,373 --> 01:15:04,125
He wants you
to come to him.

1214
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:06,752
What is that?
That's the shit emoji.

1215
01:15:06,794 --> 01:15:08,939
You know, it's the turd with
the smiling face and the eyes?

1216
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:11,298
I thought it was chocolate
yogurt for so long.

1217
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:13,134
I need guns.

1218
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,301
Okay, which ones?

1219
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:15,594
I need all the guns!

1220
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:16,887
All right. Okay.

1221
01:15:37,575 --> 01:15:38,993
That's about
3,000 rounds.

1222
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:41,996
We all know
what I can do with 12.

1223
01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:44,623
Hey, hey, careful with
that, Ronnie Milsap!

1224
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:45,791
We're downrange.

1225
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:48,669
I was gonna
spend the night

1226
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:50,914
assembling the Borje, but
this is holding my interest.

1227
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:54,800
I told you, we're going with
the Urvaj, not the Borje.

1228
01:15:54,842 --> 01:15:56,802
Get it through your head
or get out of fuck town.

1229
01:15:56,844 --> 01:15:59,513
Shit. That's all the pieces
in the house.

1230
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,474
Nah, nah... Come on.
Let's go. Cough it up.

1231
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:03,350
Up, up, up.

1232
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:05,770
Oh. Down, down, down.

1233
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:06,937
Fuck you.

1234
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:11,525
45 cal. I like it.

1235
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:14,862
Wade...

1236
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:18,824
I'd go with you,
but I don't want to.

1237
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:22,995
Uh...

1238
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:24,538
Listen, Al...

1239
01:16:25,623 --> 01:16:28,042
if I never see
you again,

1240
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:30,795
I want you to know that
I love you very much.

1241
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:35,508
And also, uh, there's
about 116 kilos of cocaine

1242
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:36,860
buried somewhere
in the apartment...

1243
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:39,678
right next to the cure
for blindness. Good luck.

1244
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:46,227
You wanna get fucked up?

1245
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:58,072
Put her down
over here.

1246
01:17:08,249 --> 01:17:09,500
Go on then.

1247
01:17:11,919 --> 01:17:14,505
Thanks, dick less.
And I mean you.

1248
01:17:14,922 --> 01:17:18,175
Wow. You're a talker too.
You and Wade.

1249
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:20,052
I've been trying
to tell you assholes,

1250
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:21,554
you've got the wrong girl.

1251
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:23,055
My old boyfriend,
he's dead.

1252
01:17:23,222 --> 01:17:26,684
See, I thought that too.
But he keeps on coming back.

1253
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:28,102
Like a cockroach...

1254
01:17:28,269 --> 01:17:29,603
but uglier.

1255
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:34,108
Now, I may not feel,
but he does.

1256
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:37,232
Let's see how he fights
with your head on the block.

1257
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:47,538
Ripley, from Alien 3!

1258
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:49,957
Fuck, you're old.

1259
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:53,919
Fake laugh.
Hiding real pain.

1260
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:55,296
Go get Silver Balls.

1261
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:57,756
You guys going for a bite?
Early bird special?

1262
01:17:57,882 --> 01:17:59,109
Oh, like there's
something wrong

1263
01:17:59,133 --> 01:18:00,777
with eating before sundown
or saving money.

1264
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:04,138
No, you know that bad guy
that you let go?

1265
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:06,557
He's got my girl.

1266
01:18:06,724 --> 01:18:08,100
You're gonna
help me get her back.

1267
01:18:08,475 --> 01:18:10,227
Wade, is that you?

1268
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:11,896
Yeah, it's me, Deadpool,

1269
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:14,773
and I got an offer
that you can't refuse.

1270
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:18,587
I'm gonna wait
out here, okay?

1271
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:19,653
It's a big house.

1272
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:20,881
It's funny that I only
ever see two of you.

1273
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:24,116
It's almost like the studio
couldn't afford another X-Man.

1274
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:29,121
And that is why,
in my opinion...

1275
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:32,416
the movie Cocoon
IS pure pornography.

1276
01:18:32,917 --> 01:18:34,585
Who brought
this twinkly man?

1277
01:18:34,752 --> 01:18:36,670
Twinkly, but deadly.

1278
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:39,256
My chrome-penised
friend back there

1279
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:40,925
has agreed
to do me this solid.

1280
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:43,344
In exchange,
I said that I would

1281
01:18:43,469 --> 01:18:45,346
consider joining his boy band.

1282
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:46,680
It's not boy band.

1283
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:47,932
Sure it's not.

1284
01:18:48,641 --> 01:18:50,935
So,
any luck winning Gita back?

1285
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:54,021
I tried to hold on tight,
Mr. Pool...

1286
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:57,816
but Bandhu is more craftier
and handsomer than me.

1287
01:18:58,484 --> 01:19:00,194
Well, I think you're
pretty darn cute.

1288
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:07,701
Dopinder.
Hmm?

1289
01:19:09,036 --> 01:19:10,037
What was that?

1290
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:11,997
Uh...

1291
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:17,711
That was Bandhu
in the trunk.

1292
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:19,672
Ban who?

1293
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:22,508
My romantic rival Bandhu.
He's tied up in the trunk.

1294
01:19:22,549 --> 01:19:24,176
I'm doing as you said, DP.

1295
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:26,178
I plan to gut him
like a tandoori fish,

1296
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:28,055
then dump his carcass
on Gita's doorstep.

1297
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:31,016
I did not tell him
to do that.

1298
01:19:31,141 --> 01:19:33,811
Absolutely not.
It got lost in translation.

1299
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:37,022
Dopinder, this is no way
to win Gita's heart back!

1300
01:19:37,147 --> 01:19:38,148
I'm so proud of you.

1301
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:40,359
Drop Bandhu off,
safe and gentle-like.

1302
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:41,485
Kill him.

1303
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:43,529
And then,
win Gita back...

1304
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:46,407
with your boyish charm.

1305
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:48,033
Kidnap her.

1306
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:50,661
He's super dead.

1307
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:52,162
Whoa!

1308
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:57,584
I presume a crisp
high five?

1309
01:19:57,751 --> 01:19:59,086
For you? 10.

1310
01:20:00,587 --> 01:20:03,257
Okay, guys, let's get out
there and make a difference.

1311
01:20:03,424 --> 01:20:05,342
You know what to do.

1312
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,887
Knock 'em dead,
Pool Boy!

1313
01:20:10,097 --> 01:20:12,099
Time to make
the chimi-fucking-changas.

1314
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,227
Not often
a dude ruins your face...

1315
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:18,230
skull-stomps your sanity,
grabs your future baby mama...

1316
01:20:18,272 --> 01:20:19,898
and personally sees to four

1317
01:20:20,024 --> 01:20:22,401
of your five
shittiest moments.

1318
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:26,697
Let's just say it's beginning
to look a lot like Christmas.

1319
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:40,919
Hey.

1320
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:42,296
Where's your duff te bag?

1321
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:02,566
Bandhu?

1322
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:06,070
Leave a message
and have a happy day.

1323
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:07,488
God damn it!

1324
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:09,294
I'm gonna do this
the old fashioned way...

1325
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:12,826
with two swords
and maximum effort.

1326
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:14,828
Cue the music.

1327
01:21:31,011 --> 01:21:33,472
Wade Wilson!

1328
01:21:34,014 --> 01:21:35,641
What's my name?

1329
01:21:35,682 --> 01:21:37,851
Oh, I'mma fucking
spell it out for ya.

1330
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:41,146
Go get some.

1331
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:42,356
Superhero landing.

1332
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:43,666
She's gonna do
a superhero landing.

1333
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:44,691
Wait for it.

1334
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:49,113
Whoo!

1335
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:50,322
Superhero landing!

1336
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:52,258
You know, that's really
hard on your knees.

1337
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:53,700
Totally impractical.
They all do it.

1338
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:57,371
You're a lovely lady, but
I'm saving myself for Francis.

1339
01:21:57,538 --> 01:21:58,622
That's why
I brought him.

1340
01:21:58,789 --> 01:22:02,000
I prefer not to hit a
woman, so please...

1341
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:12,302
I mean,
that's why I brought her?

1342
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:15,889
Oh, no, finish your tweet.
It's not... That's...

1343
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:17,516
Just give us a second.
Yeah.

1344
01:22:17,683 --> 01:22:19,017
There you go.
Hashtag it.

1345
01:22:20,394 --> 01:22:22,229
Go get her, tiger.

1346
01:22:28,902 --> 01:22:32,656
Oh, I so pity the dude who
pressures her into prom sex.

1347
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:34,908
All right, then. Fire!

1348
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:48,172
Finish fucking her
the fuck up!

1349
01:22:48,338 --> 01:22:49,381
Language, please.

1350
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:50,591
Suck a cock.

1351
01:23:16,617 --> 01:23:18,285
Look away, child.

1352
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:20,370
Look away!

1353
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:28,921
Wait!

1354
01:23:29,087 --> 01:23:30,130
Wait!

1355
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:31,256
Cease fire!

1356
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:32,591
Cease fire!

1357
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:34,134
Fellas! Hey! Hey!

1358
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:39,139
You only work for that
shit-spackled muppet fart.

1359
01:23:39,306 --> 01:23:41,433
So, I'mma give you a chance

1360
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:43,227
for y'all to lay down
your firearms...

1361
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:46,271
in exchange for preferential,
bordering on gentle...

1362
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:49,900
possibly even
lover-like treatment.

1363
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:53,111
Fine.

1364
01:23:53,153 --> 01:23:54,238
Commando!

1365
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:07,352
Teabag!

1366
01:25:11,857 --> 01:25:12,858
Bob?

1367
01:25:13,859 --> 01:25:14,860
Wade?

1368
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:16,254
Oh, my God,
I haven't seen you since...

1369
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:18,530
Jacksonville. Fridays.
Since TGI Fridays.

1370
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:21,116
Well, what the hell!

1371
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:23,201
God, come here, you.

1372
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:27,289
How are the kids?
Good?

1373
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:29,642
And Gail, she still fixing
that tuna casserole?

1374
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:31,376
So good.
But bad for the waistline,

1375
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:32,820
if you know what
I'm talking about.

1376
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:38,216
Oh!

1377
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:42,554
Your... On the left.
You are beautiful woman.

1378
01:25:42,721 --> 01:25:43,722
That is so sweet.

1379
01:25:44,056 --> 01:25:45,057
Uh...

1380
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:46,224
Thanks.

1381
01:25:53,732 --> 01:25:54,733
Yoo-hoo!

1382
01:25:58,403 --> 01:25:59,988
Does he
write you notes too?

1383
01:26:00,072 --> 01:26:01,907
He's such a romantic.

1384
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:03,742
Don't worry, baby.
I'm coming.

1385
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:06,078
Fire!

1386
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:15,170
Hey!

1387
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:16,421
Climb on!

1388
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:55,043
Motherfucking...

1389
01:27:06,388 --> 01:27:08,890
Motherfucker should have
worn his brown pants.

1390
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:12,811
You were right,
beautiful.

1391
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:15,480
Red really is my color.

1392
01:27:16,148 --> 01:27:17,232
Wade?

1393
01:27:17,315 --> 01:27:18,316
Don't worry, baby...

1394
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:20,652
I'mma get you out
of that shit-box.

1395
01:27:21,153 --> 01:27:23,353
What better way to crawl back
inside that head of yours?

1396
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:25,240
Oh, you never left.

1397
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:27,409
But you did, asshole!

1398
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:28,994
Ah, deep breath, darling.

1399
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:31,663
Oh, wait.

1400
01:27:32,831 --> 01:27:34,332
Wrong choice of words.

1401
01:27:36,585 --> 01:27:39,337
I hope they blocked pain
to your every last nerve.

1402
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:40,589
"Cause I'mma go looking!

1403
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:44,009
I hear you grow back
body parts now, Wade.

1404
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:45,510
When I'm finished...

1405
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:47,345
parts will have
to grow back you.

1406
01:27:47,512 --> 01:27:48,680
Good one.

1407
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:51,349
Yep, that was a good one.

1408
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:52,517
Let's dance.

1409
01:27:53,852 --> 01:27:55,020
And by dance, I mean...

1410
01:27:55,187 --> 01:27:56,347
let's try to kill each other.

1411
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:53,161
Fine. Fists.

1412
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:55,247
Oh, sounds like
your last Saturday night.

1413
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:19,247
Asshole!

1414
01:31:15,553 --> 01:31:16,554
Hang in there,
baby!

1415
01:31:17,055 --> 01:31:19,057
Wade!
I gotcha!

1416
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:24,396
I got a plan.
You're not gonna like it.

1417
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:36,241
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1418
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:44,666
Don't worry.
I'm totally on top of this.

1419
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:01,766
Ah! Damn it!

1420
01:32:02,684 --> 01:32:05,603
Maximum effort!

1421
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:48,980
Thanks.

1422
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:55,570
Just take it slow.

1423
01:33:02,285 --> 01:33:03,661
Yoo-hoo!

1424
01:33:05,997 --> 01:33:08,666
Oh, my God! That was so...

1425
01:33:39,697 --> 01:33:41,282
There are no words!

1426
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:45,954
Me and you are headed
to fix this butter face.

1427
01:33:46,704 --> 01:33:47,872
What?

1428
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:52,961
You stupid
fucking idiot.

1429
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:57,966
Did you really think there
was a cure... for that?

1430
01:33:59,843 --> 01:34:00,844
What?

1431
01:34:01,302 --> 01:34:02,345
You heard me.

1432
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:05,223
No.

1433
01:34:05,348 --> 01:34:06,558
No!

1434
01:34:13,815 --> 01:34:16,818
So, you mean to say...

1435
01:34:17,569 --> 01:34:21,573
after all this,
you can't fix me?

1436
01:34:22,407 --> 01:34:24,492
It sounds even stupider
when you say it.

1437
01:34:24,576 --> 01:34:26,411
Like the kind of stupid
who admits

1438
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:29,581
he can't do the one thing
I'm keeping him alive for?

1439
01:34:33,543 --> 01:34:35,253
Any last words?

1440
01:34:37,172 --> 01:34:38,256
What's my name?

1441
01:34:39,382 --> 01:34:40,425
Who fucking cares?

1442
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:41,551
Wade!

1443
01:34:43,178 --> 01:34:45,555
Four or five moments.

1444
01:34:45,763 --> 01:34:46,764
I'm sorry?

1445
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:49,517
Four or five moments,
that's all it takes.

1446
01:34:50,101 --> 01:34:51,102
To?

1447
01:34:52,103 --> 01:34:53,438
Be a hero.

1448
01:34:55,565 --> 01:34:58,359
Everyone thinks
it's a full-time job.

1449
01:34:58,443 --> 01:35:00,737
Wake up a hero,
brush your teeth a hero,

1450
01:35:00,778 --> 01:35:02,030
go to work a hero.

1451
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:04,199
Not true.

1452
01:35:04,407 --> 01:35:07,577
Over a lifetime, there are
only four or five moments

1453
01:35:07,619 --> 01:35:09,787
that really matter.

1454
01:35:10,205 --> 01:35:12,582
Moments when you're
offered a choice.

1455
01:35:12,749 --> 01:35:15,376
To make a sacrifice,
conquer a flaw,

1456
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:16,920
save a friend...

1457
01:35:17,545 --> 01:35:20,131
spare an enemy.

1458
01:35:20,757 --> 01:35:22,133
In these moments...

1459
01:35:22,926 --> 01:35:25,803
everything else falls away.

1460
01:35:26,429 --> 01:35:28,973
The way the world sees us.

1461
01:35:29,432 --> 01:35:30,433
The way we...

1462
01:35:34,646 --> 01:35:35,772
Why?

1463
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:38,816
You were droning on.

1464
01:35:38,983 --> 01:35:41,945
Sure, I may be stuck looking
like pepperoni flatbread...

1465
01:35:42,111 --> 01:35:44,906
but at least fuck face
won't heal from that.

1466
01:35:45,156 --> 01:35:47,784
If wearing superhero tights...

1467
01:35:48,243 --> 01:35:49,577
means sparing psychopaths...

1468
01:35:49,744 --> 01:35:51,788
then maybe I wasn't
meant to wear 'em.

1469
01:35:51,955 --> 01:35:54,290
Not everyone monitors
a hall like you.

1470
01:35:54,332 --> 01:35:55,416
Just promise...

1471
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,085
Yeah, yeah,
I'll be on the lookout

1472
01:35:57,168 --> 01:35:59,337
for the next four moments.

1473
01:35:59,462 --> 01:36:00,964
Oh, shit.

1474
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:04,801
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm just a boy,

1475
01:36:04,842 --> 01:36:06,970
about to stand
in front of a girl...

1476
01:36:07,136 --> 01:36:08,346
and tell her...

1477
01:36:08,513 --> 01:36:10,515
What the fuck
am I gonna tell her?

1478
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:13,851
Well, hmm,
you better figure it out.

1479
01:36:15,353 --> 01:36:16,604
I can't even tell you...

1480
01:36:16,688 --> 01:36:17,772
I deserved that.
That, too.

1481
01:36:18,523 --> 01:36:20,149
No, no, no,
maybe not the nethers.

1482
01:36:20,191 --> 01:36:22,110
Start talking!

1483
01:36:24,153 --> 01:36:25,697
I'm sorry.

1484
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:27,448
I'm so sorry.

1485
01:36:28,283 --> 01:36:30,827
For everything,
I'm sorry for leaving...

1486
01:36:32,328 --> 01:36:34,289
I'm sorry for not
cowboying up sooner.

1487
01:36:34,455 --> 01:36:36,165
It's been rough
couple of years.

1488
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:37,208
Rough?

1489
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:46,884
I live in a crack house.

1490
01:36:48,136 --> 01:36:49,470
With a family of 12.

1491
01:36:51,222 --> 01:36:52,724
Every night
we spoon for warmth.

1492
01:36:52,807 --> 01:36:55,727
Everybody fights for Noelle.
She's the fattest.

1493
01:36:55,893 --> 01:36:57,520
There's nothing
that we don't share.

1494
01:36:57,562 --> 01:37:01,733
Floor space, dental floss,
even condoms.

1495
01:37:09,866 --> 01:37:12,035
So, you live in a house.

1496
01:37:20,877 --> 01:37:23,838
I should have come
and found you sooner.

1497
01:37:25,256 --> 01:37:26,616
But, baby,
the guy under this mask,

1498
01:37:26,716 --> 01:37:29,260
he ain't the same one
that you remember.

1499
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:34,849
You mean this mask?

1500
01:37:54,952 --> 01:37:56,579
And this one.

1501
01:37:58,039 --> 01:37:59,791
In case the other fell off.

1502
01:38:02,794 --> 01:38:04,962
All right.
Yeah, just... Ow.

1503
01:38:05,129 --> 01:38:06,714
Like a Band-Aid,
just give it a...

1504
01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:08,966
Owdie 5,000.

1505
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:10,134
Wait, wait, wait...

1506
01:38:12,053 --> 01:38:13,304
Are you sure?

1507
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:16,140
I'm sure.

1508
01:38:26,484 --> 01:38:27,485
Wow.

1509
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:29,987
Yeah.

1510
01:38:36,953 --> 01:38:38,287
Hey.

1511
01:38:40,498 --> 01:38:42,291
After a brief
adjustment period...

1512
01:38:42,834 --> 01:38:44,752
and a bunch of drinks...

1513
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:48,131
it's a face...

1514
01:38:52,593 --> 01:38:54,178
I'd be happy to sit on.

1515
01:39:01,686 --> 01:39:05,148
I'm not the same
underneath this suit, either.

1516
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:06,190
No.

1517
01:39:06,774 --> 01:39:08,526
Super-penis.

1518
01:39:08,776 --> 01:39:10,653
Come on, Wade. Language.

1519
01:39:10,862 --> 01:39:12,280
Young one is present.

1520
01:39:13,364 --> 01:39:15,199
What are you still doing?

1521
01:39:15,283 --> 01:39:17,952
Get out of here.
Go make yourself useful!

1522
01:39:18,035 --> 01:39:20,788
You, go be a really
big brother to someone.

1523
01:39:20,872 --> 01:39:22,540
Tell Beast to stop
shitting on my lawn.

1524
01:39:22,665 --> 01:39:24,459
And you,
chicken noodle...

1525
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:26,377
Nothing compares to you.

1526
01:39:26,502 --> 01:39:28,546
Sinéad O'Connor, 1990.
Sorry.

1527
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:31,340
That's all right.
You're cool.

1528
01:39:33,217 --> 01:39:34,844
What in the ass?

1529
01:39:35,011 --> 01:39:38,055
That was not mean.
I'm proud of you!

1530
01:39:38,473 --> 01:39:41,517
We will make an X-Man
of you yet, Wade.

1531
01:39:41,684 --> 01:39:42,894
For a second there,

1532
01:39:43,019 --> 01:39:44,819
it felt like we were
three mini-lion robots...

1533
01:39:44,854 --> 01:39:47,064
coming together to form
one super robot.

1534
01:39:47,899 --> 01:39:49,066
There's a stupid.

1535
01:39:49,192 --> 01:39:50,234
Yeah.

1536
01:39:53,696 --> 01:39:58,075
And now, for the moment
I've all been waiting for.

1537
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:02,914
Come here.

1538
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:15,760
Wham! As promised.

1539
01:40:28,856 --> 01:40:29,941
See?

1540
01:40:30,066 --> 01:40:33,611
You don't need to be
a superhero to get the girl.

1541
01:40:33,694 --> 01:40:36,447
The right girl will bring out
the hero in you.

1542
01:40:37,073 --> 01:40:40,451
Now, let's finish this
epic wide shot. Pull out.

1543
01:40:40,618 --> 01:40:42,119
There we go, that looks nice.

1544
01:40:42,245 --> 01:40:43,388
That's gonna be
about the only thing

1545
01:40:43,412 --> 01:40:44,705
that's pulling out tonight.

1546
01:40:44,789 --> 01:40:47,959
Who doesn't love
a happy ending, huh?

1547
01:40:48,084 --> 01:40:49,585
'Til next time, this is

1548
01:40:49,627 --> 01:40:51,879
your friendly neighborhood
pool guy singing...

1549
01:40:51,963 --> 01:40:54,257
I'm never gonna dance again

1550
01:40:54,298 --> 01:40:57,802
The way I danced with you

1551
01:47:07,671 --> 01:47:09,340
You're still here?

1552
01:47:11,926 --> 01:47:14,970
It's over. Go home.

1553
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:19,183
Oh, you're expecting
a teaser for Deadpool 2.

1554
01:47:19,266 --> 01:47:21,101
Well, we don't have
that kind of money.

1555
01:47:22,019 --> 01:47:24,939
What are you expecting?
Sam Jackson to show up?

1556
01:47:25,105 --> 01:47:27,691
With an eye patch and a saucy
little leather number?

1557
01:47:27,816 --> 01:47:29,443
Go. Go.

1558
01:47:34,698 --> 01:47:35,699
Oh.

1559
01:47:35,741 --> 01:47:38,285
But I can tell you one thing,
and it's a bit of a secret.

1560
01:47:38,369 --> 01:47:41,497
For the sequel,
we're gonna have Cable.

1561
01:47:41,538 --> 01:47:43,958
Amazing character.
Bionic arm, time travel.

1562
01:47:44,041 --> 01:47:45,185
We have no idea
who we're gonna cast yet,

1563
01:47:45,209 --> 01:47:46,293
but it could be anybody.

1564
01:47:46,377 --> 01:47:47,878
Just need a big guy
with a flat top.

1565
01:47:47,962 --> 01:47:49,630
Could be Mel Gibson,
Dolph Lundgren...

1566
01:47:49,713 --> 01:47:52,174
Keira Knightley.
She's got range. Who knows.

1567
01:47:52,216 --> 01:47:53,634
Anyway, big secret. Shh...

1568
01:47:53,717 --> 01:47:55,678
Oh, and don't leave your
garbage all lying around.

1569
01:47:55,719 --> 01:47:58,180
It's a total dick move.

1570
01:47:59,139 --> 01:48:00,224
Go.
