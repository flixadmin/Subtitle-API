1
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,350
Now, I know what you're thinking.

2
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:00,895
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage.
How did this happen?"

3
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:02,813
Well, sometimes you have to get captured

4
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:04,565
just to get a straight
answer out of somebody.

5
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:07,151
It's a long story,

6
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:09,195
but basically, I'm a bit of a hero.

7
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:12,949
See, I spent some time on Earth...

8
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:14,575
fought some robots,

9
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:16,285
saved the planet a couple of times.

10
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,329
Then I went searching through the cosmos

11
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:21,457
for some magic, colorful
Infinity Stone things.

12
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,752
Didn't find any.

13
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:26,128
That's when I came across

14
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:28,965
a path of death and destruction...

15
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,842
which led me all the way here
into this cage...

16
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:34,804
where I met you.

17
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:40,059
Hmm.

18
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,645
How much longer do you
think we'll be here?

19
00:01:56,701 --> 00:02:00,288
Thor, son of Odin.

20
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:04,208
Surtur, son of a bitch.

21
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:05,293
You're still alive.

22
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:09,797
I thought my father killed you
a half a million years ago.

23
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,590
I cannot die.

24
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,509
Not until I fulfill my destiny...

25
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:15,928
and lay waste to your home.

26
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,596
It's funny you should mention that.

27
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:20,057
Because I've been having these
terrible dreams of late.

28
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:22,476
Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins.

29
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,853
And you, Surtur,

30
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,438
are at the center of all of them.

31
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,442
Then you have seen Ragnarok,
the fall of Asgard.

32
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,444
- The great prophecy...
- Hang on.

33
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,322
Hang on.

34
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:37,116
I'll be back around shortly.

35
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:40,244
I really feel like we were
connecting there.

36
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,373
Okay, so Ragnarok.

37
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:46,125
Tell me about that.
Walk me through it.

38
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,294
My time has come.

39
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:51,589
When my crown is reunited
with the Eternal Flame...

40
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:54,425
I shall be restored to my full might.

41
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,844
I will tower over the mountains...

42
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,597
and bury my sword deep in Asgard's...

43
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,308
Oh, hang on.
Give it a second.

44
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,768
I swear I'm not even moving.

45
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,394
It's just doing this on its own.

46
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,980
I'm really sorry.

47
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,857
Okay, so let me get this straight.

48
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:13,652
You're going to put your crown
into the Eternal Flame...

49
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,197
and then you'll suddenly
grow as big as a house?

50
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:17,531
A mountain!

51
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,743
The Eternal Flame that Odin
keeps locked away on Asgard?

52
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,329
Odin is not on Asgard.

53
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:27,541
And your absence has left
the throne defenseless.

54
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,543
Okay, so where is it?
This crown?

55
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,630
This is my crown, the source of my power.

56
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,632
Oh, that's a crown.

57
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,509
I thought it was a big eyebrow.

58
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,843
It's a crown.

59
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,514
Anyway, it sounds like all I have
to do to stop Ragnarok...

60
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,391
is rip that thing off your head.

61
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:47,269
But Ragnarok has already begun.

62
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,230
You cannot stop it.

63
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:02,034
I am Asgard's doom, and so are you.

64
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:05,788
All will suffer, all will burn.

65
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:07,665
Oh, that's intense.

66
00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:09,667
To be honest, seeing
you grow really big...

67
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:12,336
and set fire to a planet
would be quite the spectacle.

68
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,172
But it looks like I'm gonna
have to choose option B...

69
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,091
where I bust out of these chains...

70
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:19,009
knock that tiara off your head,

71
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,095
and stash it away in Asgard's vault.

72
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:24,265
You cannot stop Ragnarok.

73
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:25,516
Why fight it?

74
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:29,395
Because that's what heroes do.

75
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:33,399
Hmm.

76
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,402
Wait, I'm sorry.
I didn't time that right.

77
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,028
Hmm?

78
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:39,572
And, now!

79
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,746
You have made a grave mistake, Odinson.

80
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,457
I make grave mistakes all the time.

81
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:55,171
Everything seems to work out.

82
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:59,276
Huh?

83
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,542
Heimdall, I know it's been a while,

84
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,628
but I could really use a fast exit.

85
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,547
Heimdall?

86
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,425
Heimdall was an idiot.

87
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,552
This job should have made him rich.

88
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,972
Now, the job ain't easy...

89
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,932
but it does have its benefits.

90
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,476
The Bifrost gives me access to everything

91
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,478
the Nine Realms has to offer.

92
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,939
I mean it's all mine for the taking.

93
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,608
Behold...

94
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:42,945
my stuff.

95
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,280
Ooh.

96
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:46,949
I'm particularly fond of these.

97
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:50,661
I pulled them out of a place
on Midgard called Texas.

98
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:53,872
I even named them.
Des and Troy.

99
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:57,084
You see, when you put them together...

100
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,128
they destroy.

101
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,149
Heimdall, come on.

102
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:41,503
Stay!

103
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:46,133
Heimdall?
I'm running short on options.

104
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,886
<i>Heimdall?</i>

105
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,387
Um... Skurge?

106
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,142
Is that important?

107
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,942
You girls are in for a treat.

108
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,497
Girls!

109
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,752
Well, well, well.
Look who decided to pop in.

110
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,963
Thanks for scaring away my company

111
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,714
and drenching my workplace in brains.

112
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,007
Who are you?

113
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,843
Don't you remember?
I'm Skurge.

114
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,052
We fought together on Vanaheim.

115
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:14,555
Right. Where is Heimdall?

116
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,724
That traitor. No one knows.
He's a fugitive of the throne.

117
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,518
Traitor?

118
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,186
Yeah. Well, you see,
Odin charged Heimdall

119
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,271
with negligence of duty...

120
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,356
but he disappeared before the trial.

121
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:25,649
Hard to catch a guy

122
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:26,733
who can see everything in the universe.

123
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:27,818
Sure.

124
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,446
Hold on. I'm supposed
to announce your arrival.

125
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,221
What the hell is that?

126
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:06,899
Oh, brother.
This is it.

127
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:08,442
I take my leave.

128
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,320
You fool, you didn't listen!

129
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:12,613
I'm sorry.

130
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:13,822
Lady Sif, get help!

131
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:14,907
Somebody, help!

132
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,242
Sorry for all I've done.

133
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:19,161
Shh. It's all right. Hold on.

134
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:22,748
I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth.

135
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,249
They'd be lucky to have you.

136
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,252
I'm sorry about that thing
with the Tesseract.

137
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,213
- I just couldn't help myself.
- I know.

138
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:30,589
I'm a trickster.

139
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,591
So mischievous.

140
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:35,469
Sorry about that time
I turned you into a frog.

141
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,054
It was a wonderful joke.

142
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,348
'Twas indeed hilarious.

143
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:41,600
You are the savior of Asgard.

144
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:43,936
- Tell my story.
- I will.

145
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,145
Build a statue for me.

146
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,022
We will build a big statue for you.

147
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,067
With my helmet on,
with the big bendy horns.

148
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,195
I will tell Father
what you did here today.

149
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,030
I didn't do it for him.

150
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,867
I didn't do it for him.

151
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,795
No!

152
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,218
And so, Loki died of his wounds...

153
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,303
giving his life for ours.

154
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,139
He fought back those disgusting elves...

155
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,100
he brought peace to the realm.

156
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:25,561
Loki, my boy...

157
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,021
'twas many moons ago I found you

158
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,065
on that frostbitten battlefield.

159
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,318
On that day, I did not yet see in you...

160
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,779
Asgard's savior. No.

161
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:40,450
You were merely a little
blue baby icicle...

162
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,454
that melted this old fool's heart.

163
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:49,418
Bravo! Bravo!
Well done. Bravo.

164
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,173
Father.

165
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:57,259
Oh, shit.

166
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,886
Uh, my son, Thor, has returned!

167
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:03,265
Greetings, my boy.

168
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,017
It's an interesting play.
What's it called?

169
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,269
<i>The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard.</i>

170
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,271
The people wanted to commemorate him.

171
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:10,772
Ah, indeed they should.

172
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:12,232
I like the statue.

173
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,568
A lot better looking than he was
when he was alive, though.

174
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,570
A little less weaselly,
less greasy, maybe.

175
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:19,698
Do you know what this is?

176
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,577
The skull of Surtur.
That's a formidable weapon!

177
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,287
Do me a favor.
Lock this away in a vault...

178
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,205
so it doesn't turn into a giant monster

179
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:28,665
and destroy the whole planet.

180
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:31,960
Thank you, dear. Um...

181
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:34,713
So it's back to Midgard for you, is it?

182
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,089
Nope.

183
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,217
I've been having this
reoccurring dream lately.

184
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,179
Every night,
I see Asgard fall into ruins.

185
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:43,472
That's just a silly dream...

186
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,599
signs of an overactive imagination.

187
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:46,892
Possibly.

188
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,810
But then I decide to go
out there and investigate.

189
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,228
And what do I find,

190
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:53,065
but the Nine Realms completely in chaos.

191
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:56,193
Enemies of Asgard assembling,
plotting our demise...

192
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:57,903
all while you, Odin,

193
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,279
the protector of those Nine Realms...

194
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,114
are sitting here in your bathrobe,

195
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:02,199
eating grapes.

196
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,409
Yes, it is best to respect
our neighbors' freedom.

197
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:07,663
Yes, of course,
the freedom to be massacred.

198
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,625
Yes, besides I've been
rather busy myself.

199
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:12,918
Watching theater.

200
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,836
Board meetings, and security
council meetings...

201
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,129
You're really gonna make me do it?

202
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,547
Do what?

203
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,261
You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir

204
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,846
as it returns to my hand.

205
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,473
Not even your face.

206
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,850
You've gone quite mad.
You'll be executed for this.

207
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:31,561
Then I'll see you
on the other side, brother.

208
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,356
All right, I yield.

209
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:45,659
Behold!

210
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:47,703
Thor...

211
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,830
- Odinson.
- No.

212
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,875
You had one job. Just the one.

213
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,045
Where's Odin?

214
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,964
You just couldn't stay away, could you?

215
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,007
Everything was fine without you.

216
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,844
Asgard was prospering.
You've ruined everything.

217
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,345
- Ask them.
- Where's Father?

218
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,055
- Did you kill him?
- You had what you wanted.

219
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,140
You had the independence you asked for.

220
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,349
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

221
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:11,518
Okay. I know exactly where he is.

222
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,782
I swear I left him right here.

223
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:28,535
Right here on the sidewalk,

224
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:29,911
or right there where the building
is being demolished?

225
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:31,246
Great planning.

226
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:32,664
How was I supposed to know?

227
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,999
Can't see into the future.
I'm not a witch.

228
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,376
No? Then why do you dress like one?

229
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,754
- Hey.
- I can't believe you're alive.

230
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,380
I saw you die.

231
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:42,174
I mourned you, I cried for you.

232
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,550
I'm honored.

233
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:44,926
Ask him.

234
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,595
Hi. Would you mind taking
a picture with us?

235
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:48,972
Oh, sure.

236
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,599
Start figuring out where he is.

237
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,601
Oh, my God.

238
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:53,769
Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.

239
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,521
She didn't dump me, you know.

240
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,857
I dumped her.
It was a mutual dumping.

241
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:02,694
What's this?
What are you doing?

242
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:04,029
This isn't me.

243
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:09,743
Loki.

244
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,686
Thor Odinson.

245
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,782
God of Thunder.

246
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,368
You can put down the umbrella.

247
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,179
So, Earth has, uh, wizards now?

248
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,478
The preferred term is

249
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,272
"Master of the Mystic Arts."
You can leave that now.

250
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:22,941
All right, wizard.

251
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,317
Who are you?
Why should I care?

252
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,653
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange,

253
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,697
and I have some questions for you.

254
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,781
Take a seat.

255
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:35,912
Tea?

256
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:39,708
I don't drink tea.

257
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,126
What do you drink?

258
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,586
Not tea.

259
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,674
So, I keep a watch list

260
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,551
of individuals and beings
from other realms...

261
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:51,428
that may be a threat to this world.

262
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:55,098
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

263
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,767
He's a worthy inclusion. Hmm.

264
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,187
Then why bring him here?

265
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,023
We're looking for my father.

266
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,526
So, if I were to tell you
where Odin was...

267
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,195
all parties concerned would
promptly return to Asgard?

268
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:10,572
Promptly.

269
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:11,948
Great! Then I'll help you.

270
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,326
If you knew where he was,
why didn't you call me?

271
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:16,244
I have to tell you, he was adamant

272
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:17,329
that he not be disturbed.

273
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:19,539
Your father said he had
chosen to remain in exile.

274
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,793
- Hmm.
- And you don't have a phone.

275
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,879
No, I don't have a phone...

276
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:27,797
but you could have sent
an electronic letter.

277
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:28,965
It's called an email.

278
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,717
- Yeah, do you have a computer?
- No. What for?

279
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,969
- Uh-huh.
- Anyway,

280
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,638
my father is no longer in exile.

281
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,473
So if you could tell me where he is,

282
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,557
I can take him home.

283
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,601
Gladly. He's in Norway.

284
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,771
I'm just seeing whether this incantation

285
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:45,857
requires any Asgardian modifications.

286
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:47,567
Nope.

287
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,611
Oh, we don't need that.

288
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,744
Will you stop doing that?

289
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:01,957
I need just one strand of your hair.

290
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,208
Let me explain something.

291
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,794
My hair is not to be meddled with.

292
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:14,803
We could have just walked.

293
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,391
He's waiting for you.

294
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:20,767
All right.

295
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,310
Don't forget your umbrella.

296
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:23,728
Oh, yes.

297
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:32,529
Sorry.

298
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,783
There we go.

299
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,786
I suppose I'll need my brother back.

300
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:41,621
Oh, yeah. Right.

301
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:50,171
I have been falling for 30 minutes!

302
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,340
You can handle him from here.

303
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,092
Yes. Of course.

304
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:55,510
Thank you very much for your help.

305
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,761
Good luck.

306
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,805
Handle me? Who are you?

307
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:00,557
Loki.

308
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:01,975
You think you're some kind of sorcerer?

309
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,768
Don't think for one minute,
you second-rate...

310
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,061
Bye-bye.

311
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:31,463
Father?

312
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,759
Look at this place.
It's beautiful.

313
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,599
Father, it's us.

314
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,520
My sons.

315
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,814
I've been waiting for you.

316
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:51,608
I know. We've come to take you home.

317
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,568
Home, yes.

318
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:57,530
Your mother, she calls me.

319
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,076
Do you hear it?

320
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,746
Loki, lift your magic.

321
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,918
Took me quite a while to break
free from your spell.

322
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,586
Frigga would have been proud.

323
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,380
Come and sit with me.
I don't have much time.

324
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,764
I know that we failed you.

325
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:24,224
But we can make this right.

326
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,184
I failed you.

327
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,813
It is upon us. Ragnarok.

328
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,774
No, I've stopped Ragnarok.
I put an end to Surtur.

329
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,567
No.

330
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:37,112
It has already begun.
She's coming.

331
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,490
My life was all that held her back.

332
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,574
But my time has come.

333
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,246
I cannot keep her away any longer.

334
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,206
Father, who are you talking about?

335
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:51,876
Goddess of Death. Hela.

336
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,462
My firstborn.

337
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:56,673
Your sister.

338
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,427
Your what?

339
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,724
Her violent appetites
grew beyond my control.

340
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:11,062
I couldn't stop her, so I imprisoned her.

341
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:12,230
Locked her away.

342
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:16,484
She draws her strength from Asgard...

343
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:21,322
and once she gets there,
her powers will be limitless.

344
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,074
Whatever she is,
we can stop her together.

345
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,159
We can face her together.

346
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,410
No, we won't.

347
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:28,538
I'm on a different path now.

348
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:30,165
This you must face alone.

349
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,294
I love you, my sons.

350
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,506
Look at that.

351
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,262
Remember this place.

352
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:47,140
Home.

353
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,139
Brother.

354
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,566
This was your doing.

355
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,360
So he's gone.

356
00:23:26,364 --> 00:23:28,574
That's a shame.
I would've liked to have seen that.

357
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:30,493
You must be Hela.

358
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,413
I'm Thor, son of Odin.

359
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:37,083
Really? You don't look like him.

360
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,252
Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.

361
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:41,296
You sound like him.

362
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:44,382
Kneel.

363
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:45,883
Beg your pardon?

364
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:51,723
Kneel.

365
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,811
Before your queen.

366
00:23:58,229 --> 00:23:59,480
I don't think so.

367
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,201
It's not possible.

368
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:16,914
Darling, you have no idea
what's possible.

369
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:38,227
Bring us back!

370
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,312
No!

371
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:49,489
Loki!

372
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:38,037
Who are you?
What have you done with Thor?

373
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:44,502
I'm Hela.

374
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:48,381
I'm just a janitor.

375
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:52,969
You look like a smart boy
with good survival instincts.

376
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,723
How would you like a job?

377
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,690
Are you a fighter?

378
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:12,858
Or are you food?

379
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:15,027
I'm just passing through.

380
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,029
It is food.

381
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:18,406
On your knees.

382
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:02,491
He's mine.

383
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:12,877
Wait!

384
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:22,928
Wait!

385
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,265
He's mine.

386
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:29,602
So if you want him, you go through me.

387
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,228
But we've already got him.

388
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,816
All right, then.
I guess I go through you.

389
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:37,818
More food.

390
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,522
Thank you.

391
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:53,352
Scrapper 142. I need clearance
and an audience with the boss.

392
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:55,604
I've got something special.

393
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:58,107
Hey! Where are you taking me?

394
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,776
Answer me!

395
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:02,236
Hey!

396
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:05,072
I am Thor, son of Odin.
I need to get back to Asgard.

397
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,325
Many apologies, your majesty.

398
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:40,608
It's come to my attention
that you don't know who I am.

399
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:51,285
I am Hela, Odin's firstborn...

400
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,662
the commander of the Legions of Asgard...

401
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,581
the rightful heir to the throne,

402
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,208
and the Goddess of Death.

403
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:04,381
My father is dead.

404
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,425
As are the princes.
You're welcome.

405
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:08,511
We were once the seat

406
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:10,471
of absolute power in the cosmos.

407
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:12,848
Our supremacy was unchallenged.

408
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,101
Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.

409
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:19,688
Our destiny is to rule over all others.

410
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:23,651
And I am here to restore that power.

411
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,821
Kneel before me...

412
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:30,866
and rise into the ranks
of my great conquest.

413
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:34,203
Whoever you are...

414
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:37,331
whatever you've done, surrender now!

415
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,708
Or we will show you no mercy.

416
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,418
Whoever I am?

417
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:44,088
Did you listen to a word I said?

418
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,257
This is your last warning!

419
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:50,594
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

420
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:57,643
Fine.

421
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:12,241
Charge!

422
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,547
Oh, I've missed this.

423
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:10,382
Still, it's a shame.

424
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:13,344
Good soldiers dying for nothing...

425
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:15,596
all because they couldn't see the future.

426
00:34:16,055 --> 00:34:17,306
Sad.

427
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:20,517
Oh, look, still alive.

428
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:29,777
Change of heart?

429
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:32,446
Go back to whatever
cave you crept out of.

430
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,199
You evil demoness!

431
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,163
Let's go see my palace.

432
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:14,363
<i>Fear not, for you are found.</i>

433
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,409
<i>You are home, and there is no going back.</i>

434
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,831
<i>No one leaves this place.</i>

435
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,708
<i>But what is this place?</i>

436
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:29,003
<i>The answer is Sakaar.</i>

437
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:33,132
<i>Surrounded by cosmic gateways...</i>

438
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,051
<i>Sakaar lives on the edge
of the known and unknown.</i>

439
00:35:36,385 --> 00:35:38,012
<i>It is the collection point</i>

440
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:39,763
<i>for all lost and unloved things...</i>

441
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:41,724
<i>like you.</i>

442
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:44,560
<i>But here on Sakaar, you are significant.</i>

443
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,270
<i>You are valuable.</i>

444
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:47,980
<i>Here you are loved.</i>

445
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,064
What the hell?

446
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:52,234
<i>And no one loves you more
than the Grandmaster.</i>

447
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:54,486
<i>He is the original,</i>

448
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,613
<i>the first lost and the first found...</i>

449
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:57,906
<i>the creator of Sakaar...</i>

450
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,285
<i>and father of the Contest of Champions.</i>

451
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:05,748
<i>Where once you were nothing,
now you are something.</i>

452
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,126
<i>You are the property of the Grandmaster.</i>

453
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,836
<i>Congratulations!</i>

454
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:14,423
<i>You will meet the Grandmaster in 5 seconds.</i>

455
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:16,133
<i>Prepare yourself.</i>

456
00:36:18,052 --> 00:36:19,178
<i>Prepare yourself.</i>

457
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:24,099
<i>You are now meeting the Grandmaster.</i>

458
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,443
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

459
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:39,281
He's wonderful.
It is a he?

460
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:40,783
It is a he.

461
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:41,867
Yeah.

462
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:44,036
I love when you come to visit, 142.

463
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:45,704
You bring me the best stuff.

464
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,790
Whenever we get to talking, Topaz,

465
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:49,583
about Scrapper 142...

466
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,168
what do I always say?

467
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,212
"She is the..."
And it starts with a "B."

468
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,421
Trash.

469
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:57,174
No, not trash.

470
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,593
Were you waiting just to call her that?

471
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:01,053
It doesn't start with a "B."

472
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:02,346
Booze hag.

473
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,351
Uh, I'm so sorry. No, "best."
I was thinking about "best."

474
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:08,727
'Cause I always say you're the best.

475
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,896
She brought me my beloved
champion, you know.

476
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:12,898
You say that every time she's here.

477
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,149
What have you brought today?
Tell me.

478
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:15,651
A contender.

479
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:16,860
A what?

480
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:19,071
I need to go closer.
I want a closer look at this.

481
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,198
Can you take us closer?
Thank you.

482
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:34,795
Pay this lady.

483
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:36,588
Just wait a damn minute.

484
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,133
I'm not for sale.

485
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,099
Man, he's a fighter.

486
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:48,559
I take 10 million.

487
00:37:48,851 --> 00:37:49,852
Tell her she's dreaming.

488
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,895
Oh, for heaven's sakes,
transfer the units.

489
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:00,487
You'll pay for this.

490
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:02,072
No, I got paid for this.

491
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:05,450
Here's what I wanna know.

492
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:08,245
Who are you?

493
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:12,291
I am the God of Thunder.

494
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,793
Wow.

495
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:16,879
I didn't hear any thunder,

496
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:19,006
but out of your fingers,
was that sparkles?

497
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:21,550
We've located your cousin.

498
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:23,635
Uh, oh, good!

499
00:38:23,886 --> 00:38:25,888
Yeah, come on.
I think you're gonna like this.

500
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,222
There he is.

501
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:28,390
Hey, cuz.

502
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:31,268
We almost couldn't find you.
What, you been hiding?

503
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:32,728
Hi.

504
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,229
Hmm.

505
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:35,439
So...

506
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:36,732
Please.

507
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:38,942
I'm sorry.

508
00:38:39,193 --> 00:38:40,235
Yeah.

509
00:38:40,444 --> 00:38:41,570
Carlo...

510
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:43,947
I pardon you.

511
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:45,490
Oh, thank you.

512
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:46,575
Thank you.

513
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,745
You're officially pardoned.
From life.

514
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,793
Help me.

515
00:38:57,586 --> 00:39:00,088
Oh, my God!

516
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:02,466
I'm stepping in it.
I'm stepping in it. Look!

517
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:04,426
Wow.

518
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:06,386
Oh, the smell.

519
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:08,013
What does it smell like?

520
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:10,474
Burnt toast.

521
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,267
What happened to my manners?

522
00:39:12,643 --> 00:39:14,061
I haven't properly introduced myself.

523
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:16,146
Come on. Uh, follow me.

524
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:18,565
My name is Grandmaster.

525
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:20,567
I preside over a little harlequinade

526
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:22,069
called the Contest of Champions.

527
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:23,737
People come from far and wide

528
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,988
to unwillingly participate in it.

529
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:26,406
And you, my friend,

530
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,991
might just be part of the new cast.

531
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:29,201
What do you say to that?

532
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,286
We're not friends and I don't
give a shit about your games.

533
00:39:31,495 --> 00:39:32,746
I'm going back to Asgard.

534
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,207
Ass-gard.

535
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:38,001
One, two, three, four.

536
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,755
There was a wormhole in space
and time beneath me.

537
00:39:41,964 --> 00:39:45,092
At that moment, I let go.

538
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:46,343
Loki?

539
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:49,388
Loki! Loki!

540
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:52,891
Over here. Over here.

541
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,351
- Excuse me one second.
- Loki!

542
00:39:56,353 --> 00:39:57,521
- What?
- You're alive?

543
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:59,273
- Yes, of course I'm alive.
- What are you doing here?

544
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:00,565
What do you mean, what am I doing?

545
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:01,650
I'm stuck in this stupid chair.

546
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,026
- Where's your chair?
- I didn't get a chair.

547
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:04,695
- Get me out of this one.
- I can't.

548
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:06,113
- Get me out. What?
- I can't.

549
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:07,197
I've made friends with this man.

550
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:08,282
He's called the Grandmaster.

551
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:09,491
- Oh, he's crazy!
- I've gained his favor.

552
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,243
The Bifrost brought me
out here weeks ago.

553
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:12,536
- Weeks ago?
- Yes.

554
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:13,745
I just got here.

555
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:14,997
What are you whispering about?

556
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,916
Time works real different
around these parts.

557
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:21,128
On any other world, I'd be,
like, millions of years old.

558
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,921
But here on Sakaar...

559
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:31,013
In any case, you know this, uh...

560
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,431
You call yourself Lord of Thunder?

561
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:34,891
God of Thunder.
Tell him.

562
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:36,768
I've never met this man in my life.

563
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,562
- He's my brother.
- Adopted.

564
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:39,730
Is he any kind of a fighter?

565
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,148
You take this thing

566
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,232
out of my neck and I'll show you.

567
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:44,067
Now, listen to that.
He's threatening me.

568
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:46,194
Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal.

569
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:48,572
If you wanna get back
to Ass-place, Assberg...

570
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:49,906
Asgard.

571
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,826
Any contender who defeats my champion...

572
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:54,745
their freedom they shall win.

573
00:40:55,037 --> 00:40:56,580
Fine. Then point me in the direction

574
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,123
of whoever's ass I have to kick!

575
00:40:58,457 --> 00:41:00,876
That's what I call, contender.

576
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,420
Direction would be this way, Lord.

577
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:05,088
Ah! Loki!

578
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:12,971
Hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy, man.

579
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:15,766
Over here.

580
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,434
The pile of rocks waving at you. Here.

581
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:20,145
Yeah, I'm actually a thing.
I'm a being.

582
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,980
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Korg.

583
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:23,357
I'm kind of like the leader in here.

584
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,400
I'm made of rocks, as you can see.

585
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:26,943
But don't let that intimidate you.

586
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:28,403
You don't need to be afraid

587
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:30,030
unless you're made of scissors.

588
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:31,406
Just a little rock-paper-scissor

589
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,491
joke for you.

590
00:41:32,783 --> 00:41:35,410
This is my very good
friend over here, Miek.

591
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:38,330
He's an insect and has knives for hands.

592
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:40,374
You're a Kronan, aren't you?

593
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:43,210
- That I am.
- How'd you end up in here?

594
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,170
Ah, well, I tried to start a revolution,

595
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:46,296
but didn't print enough pamphlets.

596
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:47,964
So hardly anyone turned up,

597
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:50,634
except for my mum and her
boyfriend, who I hate.

598
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:52,260
As punishment, I was forced

599
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:54,721
to be in here and become a gladiator.

600
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,223
Bit of a promotional disaster, that one.

601
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:59,142
But I'm actually organizing
another revolution.

602
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:00,435
I don't know if you'd be interested

603
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:01,561
in something like that.

604
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:03,313
Do you reckon you'd be interested?

605
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:06,608
How did you...

606
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,444
Ah, yeah, no.
This whole thing is a circle.

607
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:12,781
But not a real circle,
more like a freaky circle.

608
00:42:13,115 --> 00:42:14,282
This doesn't make any sense.

609
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:15,659
No, nothing makes sense here, man.

610
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:17,285
The only thing that does make sense

611
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:18,745
is that nothing makes sense.

612
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:21,289
Has anyone here fought
the Grandmaster's champion?

613
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:22,582
Doug has.

614
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:23,750
Doug!

615
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,001
Our luck, Doug's dead.

616
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:26,086
That's right.

617
00:42:26,253 --> 00:42:27,337
Everyone who fights

618
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:28,505
the Grandmaster's champion perishes.

619
00:42:28,964 --> 00:42:30,507
What about you?
You're made of rocks.

620
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:33,301
Perishable rock. There you go.
Another one gone.

621
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:35,387
Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights,

622
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,305
warm up the crowd and whatnot.

623
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:39,224
Wait. You're not gonna face him, are you?

624
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:40,809
Yes, I am.

625
00:42:41,143 --> 00:42:42,894
Gonna fight him, win,

626
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:44,271
and get the hell out of this place.

627
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:46,773
That's exactly what Doug used to say.

628
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:48,817
See you later, new Doug.

629
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,370
Does no one remember me?

630
00:43:01,163 --> 00:43:03,415
Has no one been taught our history?

631
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:10,547
Look at these lies.

632
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:12,716
Goblets and garden parties?

633
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,636
Peace treaties?

634
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:18,680
Odin...

635
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,432
proud to have it...

636
00:43:20,724 --> 00:43:21,975
ashamed of how he got it.

637
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:43,538
We were unstoppable.

638
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:45,540
I was his weapon in the conquest

639
00:43:45,624 --> 00:43:48,084
that built Asgard's empire.

640
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:54,257
One by one, the realms became ours.

641
00:43:54,508 --> 00:43:58,595
But then, simply because
my ambition outgrew his...

642
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:03,433
he banished me, caged me,
locked me away like an animal.

643
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:06,478
Before that, Asgard's warriors
were honored...

644
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:10,273
their bodies buried as heroes
beneath this very palace.

645
00:44:21,535 --> 00:44:23,203
- Odin's treasures.
- Fake.

646
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:27,916
Most of the stuff in here is fake.

647
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:29,709
Or weak.

648
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,797
Smaller than I thought it would be.

649
00:44:34,965 --> 00:44:36,466
That's not bad.

650
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,218
But this...

651
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:40,929
The Eternal Flame.

652
00:45:09,374 --> 00:45:11,543
Want to see what true
power really looks like?

653
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:42,991
Fenris, my darling,
what have they done to you?

654
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:49,539
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.

655
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,015
I've missed you.

656
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:09,768
I've missed you all.

657
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:13,605
Odin...

658
00:46:13,897 --> 00:46:17,067
I bid you take your place
in the halls of Valhalla...

659
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,611
where the brave shall live forever.

660
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:23,406
Nor shall we mourn but rejoice...

661
00:46:23,782 --> 00:46:25,033
for those that have died...

662
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:26,409
...the glorious death.

663
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:35,794
Hurts, doesn't it?

664
00:46:36,086 --> 00:46:37,087
Being lied to.

665
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,464
Being told you're one thing

666
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,424
and then learning it's all a fiction.

667
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:48,264
You didn't think I'd really
come and see you, did you?

668
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,183
This place is disgusting.

669
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:54,896
Does this mean you don't want my help?

670
00:46:55,188 --> 00:46:57,107
Look, I couldn't jeopardize
my position with the Grandmaster.

671
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:58,650
It took me time to win his trust.

672
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:00,193
He's a lunatic, but he can be amenable.

673
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:01,736
What I'm telling you is,

674
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,613
you could join me
at the Grandmaster's side.

675
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:04,864
Perhaps, in time,

676
00:47:04,948 --> 00:47:08,410
an accident befalls
the Grandmaster, and then...

677
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:16,835
You're not seriously thinking
of going back, are you?

678
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:22,006
Our sister destroyed your hammer

679
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:23,466
like a piece of glass.

680
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:26,219
She's stronger than both of us.
She's stronger than you.

681
00:47:26,428 --> 00:47:27,721
You don't stand a chance.

682
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:30,056
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

683
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:35,603
Fine.

684
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:40,775
I guess I'll just have to go it alone.

685
00:47:41,693 --> 00:47:42,694
Like I've always done.

686
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:46,990
Would you say something?

687
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:51,202
Say something!

688
00:47:52,454 --> 00:47:54,539
What would you like me to say?

689
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,125
You faked your own death...

690
00:47:57,417 --> 00:47:59,919
you stole the throne,
stripped Odin of his power...

691
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:01,629
stranded him on Earth to die,

692
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:03,339
releasing the Goddess of Death.

693
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:05,133
Have I said enough or
would you like me to go back

694
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:07,135
further than the past two days?

695
00:48:08,845 --> 00:48:10,221
You know, I haven't seen this

696
00:48:10,305 --> 00:48:12,348
beloved champion he talks of...

697
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,517
but I've heard he is
astonishingly savage.

698
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,896
I've placed a large wager
against you tomorrow.

699
00:48:19,272 --> 00:48:20,273
Don't let me down.

700
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,737
Piss off, ghost!

701
00:48:28,323 --> 00:48:29,783
He's freaking gone.

702
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:39,209
Oh, yuck!

703
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:41,419
There's still someone's hair
and blood all over this.

704
00:48:41,711 --> 00:48:43,004
Guys, can you clean up the weapons

705
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:44,297
once you finish your fight?

706
00:48:44,464 --> 00:48:45,465
Disgusting slobs.

707
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:48,134
Oh, Thor...

708
00:48:48,635 --> 00:48:50,428
wanna use a big wooden fork?

709
00:48:50,804 --> 00:48:51,805
No.

710
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:53,097
Yeah, not really useful.

711
00:48:53,306 --> 00:48:55,016
Unless you're fighting off three vampires

712
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,684
that were huddled together.

713
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:59,145
I really wish I had my hammer.

714
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:00,563
Hammer?

715
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:02,273
Quite unique.
It was made from this

716
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:04,317
special metal from the heart
of a dying star.

717
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:06,361
And when I spun it really, really fast,

718
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:07,946
it gave me the ability to fly.

719
00:49:08,071 --> 00:49:09,072
You rode a hammer?

720
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:10,740
No, I didn't ride the hammer.

721
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:12,408
The hammer rode you on your back?

722
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,160
No. I used to spin it really fast,

723
00:49:14,244 --> 00:49:15,829
and it would pull me off the...

724
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:17,997
Oh, my God.
A hammer pulled you off?

725
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:19,833
The ground. It would pull
me off the ground,

726
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:21,709
up into the air, and I would fly.

727
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,002
Every time I threw it,

728
00:49:23,086 --> 00:49:24,879
it would always come back to me.

729
00:49:25,255 --> 00:49:26,381
Sounds like you had a pretty special

730
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:27,841
and intimate relationship
with this hammer...

731
00:49:27,924 --> 00:49:29,050
and that losing it

732
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,927
was almost comparable
to losing a loved one.

733
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:34,138
That's a nice way of putting it.

734
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:37,058
I said they're mine.

735
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:40,478
See her, that's the one
that put me in here.

736
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:43,022
Oh, yeah. Scrapper 142.

737
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:45,233
Gotta watch out for those
Asgardians, man.

738
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:46,901
They are hard to perish.

739
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:48,486
Asgardian?

740
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:52,198
Hey. Hey.

741
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:53,950
Hey.

742
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,953
Do not zap me with that thing.
I just wanna talk.

743
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:00,039
Asgard is in danger.

744
00:50:04,544 --> 00:50:06,004
My God, you're a Valkyrie.

745
00:50:07,088 --> 00:50:09,299
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie
when I was younger...

746
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:11,926
until I found out that you
were all women.

747
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:13,094
There's nothing wrong
with women, of course.

748
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:14,178
I love women.

749
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:15,805
Sometimes a little too much.

750
00:50:16,014 --> 00:50:17,056
Not in a creepy way,

751
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:18,850
just more of a respectful appreciation.

752
00:50:19,142 --> 00:50:20,393
I think it's great that there is

753
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:23,521
an elite force of women warriors.

754
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,189
It's about time.

755
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:27,817
Are you done?

756
00:50:27,901 --> 00:50:28,902
Lord of Thunder, you're up.

757
00:50:28,985 --> 00:50:30,069
Please, help me.
I need your help.

758
00:50:30,153 --> 00:50:31,154
Bye.

759
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:33,406
Fine, then you must be
a traitor or a coward.

760
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:35,950
Because the Valkyrie is sworn
to protect the throne.

761
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:39,746
Listen closely, your majesty.
This is Sakaar, not Asgard.

762
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:41,956
And I'm a Scrapper, not a Valkyrie.

763
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:47,170
Bring him in for processing.

764
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:51,257
And no one escapes this place.
So you're gonna die anyway.

765
00:51:03,186 --> 00:51:04,646
Now, don't you move.

766
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:07,523
My hands ain't as steady
as they used to be.

767
00:51:07,774 --> 00:51:10,568
By Odin's beard,
you shall not cut my hair...

768
00:51:10,902 --> 00:51:13,363
lest you feel the wrath
of the mighty Thor.

769
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:20,119
Please. Please, kind sir,
do not cut my hair.

770
00:51:21,454 --> 00:51:22,789
Please! No!

771
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:24,040
No!

772
00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:39,097
<i>Wow! Look at all of you.</i>

773
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,848
<i>What a show! What a night!</i>

774
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:42,100
<i>Who's having fun?</i>

775
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:44,894
<i>Please, I'm your host.</i>

776
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:46,312
<i>Big round of applause</i>

777
00:51:46,396 --> 00:51:48,272
<i>for all of our undercard competitors...</i>

778
00:51:48,523 --> 00:51:51,234
<i>who today died so gruesomely.</i>

779
00:51:51,484 --> 00:51:52,610
<i>Good sports.</i>

780
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,445
<i>What a show! What a night!</i>

781
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:58,783
<i>This is what you've come for,
and so have I.</i>

782
00:52:04,831 --> 00:52:07,667
<i>And now, without further ado...</i>

783
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,253
<i>it's main event time.</i>

784
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:13,631
<i>Making his first appearance,</i>

785
00:52:13,715 --> 00:52:15,258
<i>though he looks quite promising...</i>

786
00:52:15,717 --> 00:52:17,385
<i>got a couple of tricks up his sleeve.</i>

787
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,430
<i>I'll say no more, see what you think.</i>

788
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:22,098
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...</i>

789
00:52:23,224 --> 00:52:25,393
<i>Lord of Thunder.</i>

790
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:50,877
<i>Watch out for his fingers.
They make sparks.</i>

791
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,295
<i>Okay, this is it.</i>

792
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:55,715
<i>Let's get ready to welcome this guy.
Here he comes.</i>

793
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:06,142
<i>He is a creature.</i>

794
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:07,643
<i>What can we say about him?</i>

795
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:10,188
<i>Well, he's unique.
There's none like him.</i>

796
00:53:10,438 --> 00:53:12,857
<i>I feel a special connection with him.</i>

797
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:15,860
<i>He's undefeated.</i>

798
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,738
<i>He's the reigning.</i>

799
00:53:21,157 --> 00:53:23,201
<i>He's the defending.</i>

800
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:24,702
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

801
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,120
<i>I give you...</i>

802
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:27,455
Uh-oh.

803
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,670
<i>...your Incredible...</i>

804
00:53:38,508 --> 00:53:40,343
Hulk!

805
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:42,303
Yes!

806
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:48,101
I have to get off this planet.

807
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:50,603
Hey, hey, hey.
Where you going?

808
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:00,113
Hey!

809
00:54:00,822 --> 00:54:02,031
We know each other.

810
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:04,367
He's a friend from work.

811
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,294
Where have you been?

812
00:54:15,503 --> 00:54:17,505
Everybody thought you were dead.

813
00:54:17,797 --> 00:54:19,590
But so much has happened
since I last saw you.

814
00:54:20,216 --> 00:54:21,759
I lost my hammer.

815
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:24,887
Like, yesterday,
so that's still pretty fresh.

816
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,598
Loki. Loki's alive.
Can you believe it?

817
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:28,933
He's up there.

818
00:54:29,142 --> 00:54:31,060
Loki! Look who it is!

819
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:35,314
Banner, I never thought
I would say this...

820
00:54:35,398 --> 00:54:37,650
but I'm happy to see you.

821
00:54:37,984 --> 00:54:40,319
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

822
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:47,118
Banner.

823
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:49,495
Hey, Banner!

824
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,081
No Banner. Only Hulk.

825
00:54:52,582 --> 00:54:53,624
What are you doing?

826
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:55,585
It's me. It's Thor!

827
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:17,273
Banner, we're friends.

828
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:19,317
This is crazy.
I don't want to hurt you!

829
00:55:26,449 --> 00:55:28,284
Here we go.

830
00:55:47,136 --> 00:55:48,221
What?

831
00:55:58,773 --> 00:56:00,149
Hey, big guy.

832
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:03,986
The sun's getting real low.

833
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:17,625
That's it.
The sun's going down.

834
00:56:20,753 --> 00:56:22,338
I won't hurt you anymore.

835
00:56:22,755 --> 00:56:24,006
No one will.

836
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:38,187
Yes! That's how it feels!

837
00:56:39,772 --> 00:56:41,315
I'm just a huge fan of the sport.

838
00:56:49,115 --> 00:56:51,450
All right. Screw it.

839
00:56:57,498 --> 00:56:58,624
Oh!

840
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:04,297
I know you're in there, Banner.

841
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,381
I'll get you out!

842
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,600
What's the matter with you?
You're embarrassing me!

843
00:57:16,851 --> 00:57:17,977
I told them we were friends!

844
00:58:49,485 --> 00:58:52,321
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

845
00:58:54,115 --> 00:58:58,911
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

846
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:33,195
Another day, another Doug.

847
00:59:42,455 --> 00:59:44,373
What is that noise?

848
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:47,293
The common folk aren't
exactly falling in line.

849
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:51,380
There's a resistance trying
to knock down the front gates.

850
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:58,679
Tell me about yourself, Skurge.

851
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:01,390
Well, me dad was a stonemason.
Me mum was...

852
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,559
Right, yeah, I'll just stop you there.

853
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:05,394
What I meant was...

854
01:00:05,895 --> 01:00:07,188
what's your ambition?

855
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:11,734
I just want a chance to prove myself.

856
01:00:12,485 --> 01:00:13,486
Recognition.

857
01:00:13,861 --> 01:00:15,112
When I was young...

858
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:19,033
every great king had an executioner.

859
01:00:19,325 --> 01:00:21,243
Not just to execute people...

860
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:23,996
but also to execute their vision.

861
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:27,791
But mainly to execute people.

862
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:30,002
Still, it was a great honor.

863
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:34,548
I was Odin's executioner.

864
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:39,929
And you shall be my executioner.

865
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:47,436
Let's begin our conquest.

866
01:00:58,948 --> 01:01:00,366
Skurge, where's the sword?

867
01:01:05,788 --> 01:01:09,500
That sword is the key
to opening the Bifrost.

868
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:11,460
Those people you mentioned,

869
01:01:11,544 --> 01:01:13,546
the ones who aren't falling into line...

870
01:01:14,213 --> 01:01:15,297
round them up.

871
01:01:39,238 --> 01:01:40,656
Excuse me.

872
01:01:52,751 --> 01:01:54,169
Sorry about that.

873
01:01:54,253 --> 01:01:55,546
These bloody things are everywhere.

874
01:01:57,006 --> 01:01:58,007
Come on.

875
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:34,543
You'll be safe here.

876
01:03:44,029 --> 01:03:45,030
Are we cool?

877
01:03:48,909 --> 01:03:50,327
It's Hulk in a hot tub.

878
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:53,205
So how long have you been like that?

879
01:03:53,872 --> 01:03:54,915
Like what?

880
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:58,836
Like this. Big, and green, and stupid.

881
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:02,131
Hulk always Hulk.

882
01:04:07,136 --> 01:04:08,303
How'd you get here?

883
01:04:09,221 --> 01:04:10,222
Winning.

884
01:04:10,305 --> 01:04:11,890
You mean cheating, huh?

885
01:04:11,974 --> 01:04:14,309
Were they wearing one
of these when you won?

886
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,728
How'd you arrive here?

887
01:04:18,731 --> 01:04:19,732
Quinjet.

888
01:04:20,107 --> 01:04:22,443
Yes. Now, where is the Quinjet now?

889
01:04:27,406 --> 01:04:29,283
That's naked.

890
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:32,161
He's very naked. Hmm.

891
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:36,957
It's in my brain now.

892
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:38,792
Quinjet.

893
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:50,804
Yes!

894
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:52,431
I'm getting us out of here.

895
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:55,058
This is a terrible, awful place.

896
01:04:55,309 --> 01:04:58,937
You're gonna love Asgard.
It's big. It's golden. Shiny.

897
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:00,481
Hulk stay.

898
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:04,026
No, no, no. My people need me
to get back to Asgard.

899
01:05:04,902 --> 01:05:06,570
We must prevent Ragnarok.

900
01:05:06,904 --> 01:05:07,988
Ragnarok?

901
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:09,865
The prophesied death of my home world.

902
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:11,283
The end of days, it's the end of...

903
01:05:13,702 --> 01:05:15,662
If you help me get back to Asgard...

904
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:17,915
I can help you get back to Earth. Huh?

905
01:05:18,207 --> 01:05:19,208
Earth hate Hulk.

906
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:20,834
Earth loves Hulk.
They love you.

907
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:22,419
You're one of the Avengers.

908
01:05:22,503 --> 01:05:23,712
One of the team, one of our friends.

909
01:05:24,338 --> 01:05:26,173
This is what friends do.
They support each other.

910
01:05:26,465 --> 01:05:27,549
You're Banner's friend.

911
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:29,885
I'm not Banner's friend.
I prefer you.

912
01:05:30,219 --> 01:05:31,220
Banner's friend.

913
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:32,304
I don't even like Banner.

914
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:35,224
"I'm into numbers and science and stuff."

915
01:05:35,766 --> 01:05:37,184
Thor go. Hulk stay.

916
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:38,602
Fine.

917
01:05:39,186 --> 01:05:40,187
Stay here.

918
01:05:41,063 --> 01:05:43,398
Stupid place.
It's hideous, by the way.

919
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:47,027
The red, the white.
Just pick a color. Ridiculous.

920
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:49,071
Smash you.

921
01:05:49,363 --> 01:05:51,532
You didn't smash anything.
I won that fight.

922
01:05:51,824 --> 01:05:53,826
- I smashed you.
- Yeah, sure, sure.

923
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:55,744
- Baby arms.
- What?

924
01:05:56,036 --> 01:05:57,204
Baby.

925
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:58,705
Moron! You big child.

926
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:00,082
Thor go!

927
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:01,917
I am going.

928
01:06:06,046 --> 01:06:07,297
Thor go again.

929
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:13,345
Thor home.

930
01:06:23,605 --> 01:06:24,940
Hulk trains.

931
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:27,192
That's great. Have fun.

932
01:06:27,568 --> 01:06:29,111
- Hey, big guy.
- Angry girl.

933
01:06:29,236 --> 01:06:30,404
What have you been up to?

934
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:31,738
Winning.

935
01:06:42,249 --> 01:06:45,335
Heimdall, I know you can see me.

936
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:48,463
<i>I need you to help me.</i>

937
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:51,925
Help me see.

938
01:07:02,436 --> 01:07:04,771
I see you, but you're far away.

939
01:07:05,856 --> 01:07:06,899
What's going on here?

940
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:08,525
Come see for yourself.

941
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:12,738
I'm providing refuge in a stronghold

942
01:07:12,821 --> 01:07:13,822
built by our ancestors.

943
01:07:14,323 --> 01:07:17,576
But if the garrison falls,
our only escape is Bifrost.

944
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:19,786
You're talking about evacuating Asgard?

945
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,875
We won't last long if we stay.

946
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:26,877
She draws her power from Asgard

947
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,086
and grows stronger every day.

948
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:29,379
Come on.

949
01:07:33,467 --> 01:07:34,843
Hela is ravenous.

950
01:07:35,135 --> 01:07:36,136
If I let her leave,

951
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:38,013
she'll consume Nine Realms
and all the cosmos.

952
01:07:38,347 --> 01:07:39,348
We need you.

953
01:07:39,431 --> 01:07:40,515
I'm working on it.
But I don't even know

954
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:41,600
where the hell I am.

955
01:07:42,142 --> 01:07:44,186
You're on a planet surrounded by doorways.
Go through one.

956
01:07:44,478 --> 01:07:46,271
- Which one?
- The big one.

957
01:08:15,342 --> 01:08:16,510
Thor sad.

958
01:08:16,969 --> 01:08:18,053
Shut up.

959
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,890
Thor sad.

960
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:24,768
I'm not sad, you idiot.

961
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:26,895
- I'm pissed off!
- Oh.

962
01:08:28,063 --> 01:08:30,524
Angry. I lost my father.

963
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:34,236
I lost my hammer.

964
01:08:34,361 --> 01:08:35,946
- You're not even listening.
- Whining and crying.

965
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:37,197
Cry like baby.

966
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:39,074
Don't kick stuff.

967
01:08:40,492 --> 01:08:42,536
You're being a really bad friend.

968
01:08:42,828 --> 01:08:43,829
You bad friend!

969
01:08:44,204 --> 01:08:45,288
- You know what we call you?
- No.

970
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:47,165
We call you the stupid Avenger.

971
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:49,376
You're tiny Avenger!

972
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:53,171
What, are you crazy?

973
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:54,381
Yes.

974
01:08:54,548 --> 01:08:56,925
You know what?
Earth does hate you.

975
01:09:17,738 --> 01:09:19,698
No. Mmm-mmm.

976
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,745
I'm sorry I said those things.

977
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:26,872
You're not the stupid Avenger.

978
01:09:26,955 --> 01:09:28,999
Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger.

979
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:31,126
It's okay.

980
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:32,502
You just can't go around throwing shields

981
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:33,712
at people. Could have killed me.

982
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:35,005
I know. I'm sorry.

983
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:36,757
I just get so angry all the time.

984
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,884
Hulk always, always angry.

985
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:41,428
I know.
We're the same, you and I.

986
01:09:42,054 --> 01:09:43,513
We're just a couple of hot-headed fools.

987
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:47,559
Yeah, same. Hulk like fire,
Thor like water.

988
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:50,270
We're kind of both like fire.

989
01:09:50,562 --> 01:09:52,439
But Hulk like real fire.

990
01:09:53,607 --> 01:09:55,859
Hulk like raging fire.

991
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:58,236
Thor like smoldering fire.

992
01:10:00,864 --> 01:10:02,616
Hulk, I need you to do something for me.

993
01:10:02,783 --> 01:10:03,784
Hmm?

994
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:10,665
Angry girl.

995
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:20,258
What's going on?
What are you...

996
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:31,144
You're so thick-headed
that you can't tell...

997
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:32,771
when someone's hiding all the way across

998
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:34,147
the universe and wants to be left alone.

999
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:36,942
- We need to talk.
- No, you wanna talk to me.

1000
01:10:37,818 --> 01:10:38,860
I need her to stay.

1001
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:40,028
Stay?

1002
01:10:40,654 --> 01:10:41,655
Block.

1003
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:45,075
Stay.

1004
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:46,743
- Please.
- Please.

1005
01:10:49,538 --> 01:10:50,539
All right.

1006
01:10:52,874 --> 01:10:54,584
Here's the deal.

1007
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:56,878
I'll listen to you...

1008
01:10:57,712 --> 01:10:58,922
till this is empty.

1009
01:11:00,549 --> 01:11:02,676
Asgard is in danger and people are dying.

1010
01:11:02,968 --> 01:11:04,344
We need to get back there.
I need your help.

1011
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:05,887
Wow.

1012
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:08,390
Finished. Bye.

1013
01:11:10,142 --> 01:11:11,393
Odin is dead.

1014
01:11:14,896 --> 01:11:16,982
Hela, the Goddess of Death,
has invaded Asgard.

1015
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:20,402
If Hela's back,
then Asgard's already lost.

1016
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:21,945
I'm going to stop her.

1017
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:23,947
- Alone?
- Nope.

1018
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:25,407
I'm putting together a team.

1019
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:28,368
It's me, you, and the big guy.

1020
01:11:28,869 --> 01:11:30,954
No. No team. Only Hulk.

1021
01:11:31,246 --> 01:11:32,706
It's me and you.

1022
01:11:33,081 --> 01:11:34,082
I think it's only you.

1023
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:36,459
Wait. Just listen.
The Valkyrie are legend.

1024
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:38,962
Elite warriors of Asgard
sworn to defend the throne.

1025
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:40,964
I'm not getting dragged into

1026
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:42,048
another one of Odin's family squabbles.

1027
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:44,426
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your sister.

1028
01:11:44,718 --> 01:11:46,511
Her power comes from Asgard,
same as yours.

1029
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:47,929
When it grew beyond Odin's control

1030
01:11:48,013 --> 01:11:49,181
she massacred everyone in the palace...

1031
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:50,807
and tried to seize the throne.

1032
01:11:51,266 --> 01:11:52,809
When she tried to escape
her banishment...

1033
01:11:52,893 --> 01:11:55,187
he sent the Valkyrie in
to fight her back.

1034
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:58,815
I only survived because...

1035
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:01,943
Look, I already faced her once

1036
01:12:02,027 --> 01:12:03,778
back when I believed in the throne...

1037
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:05,113
and it cost me everything.

1038
01:12:05,572 --> 01:12:06,948
That's what's wrong with Asgard.

1039
01:12:07,032 --> 01:12:09,409
The throne, the secrets,
the whole golden sham.

1040
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:10,952
I agree.

1041
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:13,246
Don't get familiar.

1042
01:12:13,872 --> 01:12:15,123
I agree.

1043
01:12:15,415 --> 01:12:16,791
That's why I turned down the throne.

1044
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:18,960
But this isn't about the crown.

1045
01:12:19,044 --> 01:12:20,086
This is about the people.

1046
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:22,214
They're dying and they're
your people, too.

1047
01:12:22,589 --> 01:12:23,840
Forget it.

1048
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:26,218
I have.

1049
01:12:26,468 --> 01:12:27,552
- Okay.
- Okay.

1050
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:28,887
- Good. Great.
- Great.

1051
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:30,096
Thank you.

1052
01:12:30,222 --> 01:12:31,765
- For what?
- For this.

1053
01:12:33,475 --> 01:12:35,310
Didn't see that, did you?

1054
01:12:36,978 --> 01:12:38,897
There... That's better.

1055
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,484
You know, go ahead.

1056
01:12:42,776 --> 01:12:47,155
Stay here and enslave
people for that lunatic.

1057
01:12:47,447 --> 01:12:48,698
Keep drinking, keep hiding.

1058
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:50,075
But me...

1059
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:53,995
I choose to run toward my problems

1060
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:55,205
and not away from them.

1061
01:12:56,498 --> 01:12:57,582
Because that's what...

1062
01:13:02,796 --> 01:13:04,714
Because that's what heroes do.

1063
01:13:16,393 --> 01:13:17,686

1064
01:13:29,698 --> 01:13:30,865
Yes!

1065
01:13:45,463 --> 01:13:46,464

- Thor.
- Yeah.

1103
01:15:36,908 --> 01:15:38,159
What happened to your hair?

1104
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:39,619
Some creepy old man cut it off.

1105
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:41,204
- It looks good.
- Oh, thanks.

- Is she okay?

1108
01:15:47,168 --> 01:15:48,837
- And what about Sokovia?
- Sokovia?

1109
01:15:49,129 --> 01:15:50,463
The city, Sokovia.
Did we save it?

1110

- Banner, listen.
- What?

1111
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:53,967
Sokovia. Ultron.
That was two years ago.

1112

- What are you saying?

- Yeah.

- Did I win?
- No, I won. Easily.

01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:18,760

01:17:52,544 --> 01:17:53,545
Don't interrupt me!

1158
01:17:53,753 --> 01:17:54,754
Here you go.

1159
01:17:55,672 --> 01:17:56,881
Why are you handing me the melt stick?

1160
01:17:57,215 --> 01:17:58,841
He was interrupting.

1161
01:17:59,217 --> 01:18:00,885
That's not a capital violation.

1162
01:18:01,177 --> 01:18:02,345
Where was I?

1163
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:05,223
My precious champion
has come up missing...

1164
01:18:05,515 --> 01:18:07,475
and it's all because
of that Lord of Thunder.

1165
01:18:07,559 --> 01:18:09,727
It's all because of him.
Your brother.

1166
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:12,855
Whatever the story is.
Adopted, or complicated.

1167
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:14,023
I'm sure there's a big history.

1168
01:18:14,274 --> 01:18:15,275
And your contender...

1169
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:17,026
My dear friend...

1170
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:19,153
if you were to give me 12 hours,

1171
01:18:19,237 --> 01:18:20,613
I could bring them both
back to you. Alive.

1172
01:18:20,863 --> 01:18:22,282
I could do it in two.

1173
01:18:23,283 --> 01:18:24,284
I could do it in one.

1174
01:18:24,534 --> 01:18:25,535
Let's stop there.

1175
01:18:25,743 --> 01:18:27,453
You know what?
I woke up this morning

1176
01:18:27,537 --> 01:18:29,247
thinking about a public execution.

1177
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:31,291
But for now, I'll settle
for this sweet little...

1178
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:34,335
"Who's gonna get him first?"

1179
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:37,922
So, you're on the clock.

1180
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:41,009
What have you done?

1181
01:18:41,092 --> 01:18:42,343
I don't answer to you, lackey.

1182
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:43,469
It's Loki.

1183
01:18:43,678 --> 01:18:45,179
And you will answer to the Grandmaster.

1184
01:18:46,389 --> 01:18:48,141
Hmm.

1185
01:18:48,433 --> 01:18:51,144
Why would you help my brother
escape with that green fool?

1186
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:52,687
I don't help anyone.

1187
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:00,361
You're a Valkyrie.

1188
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:07,452
I thought the Valkyrie had
all died gruesome deaths.

1189
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:10,371
Choose your next words wisely.

1190
01:19:10,705 --> 01:19:13,791
I'm terribly sorry.
Must be a very painful memory.

1191
01:20:06,761 --> 01:20:09,097
The sun's going down.
It's getting really low.

1192
01:20:10,431 --> 01:20:11,641
The sun's going down.

1193
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:13,142
- It's getting real low.
- Oh, shoot.

1194
01:20:13,518 --> 01:20:15,728
- Sun's getting low.
- Would you stop saying that?

1195
01:20:15,812 --> 01:20:16,854
I just need you to stay calm.

1196
01:20:17,105 --> 01:20:18,940
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!

1197
01:20:19,232 --> 01:20:20,858
It's just a planet.
You've been on a planet before.

1198
01:20:20,942 --> 01:20:21,984
Yeah. One.

1199
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:23,861
Now you've been on two.
That's a good thing.

1200
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:25,279
It's a new experience.

1201
01:20:25,488 --> 01:20:27,407
My neurons, they're firing faster

1202
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:29,492
than my brain can handle the information.

1203
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:31,911
The whole thing is totally
different this time.

1204
01:20:32,203 --> 01:20:33,913
In the past, I always
felt like Hulk and I

1205
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:35,289
each had a hand on the wheel.

1206
01:20:35,665 --> 01:20:37,333
But this time, it's like he had the keys

1207
01:20:37,417 --> 01:20:38,960
to the car and I was locked in the trunk.

1208
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:41,003
All right, well, you're back now.
That's all that matters.

1209
01:20:41,212 --> 01:20:42,255
No, it's not what matters.

1210
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:43,506
What I'm trying to tell you, is that

1211
01:20:43,589 --> 01:20:45,133
if I turn into the Hulk again...

1212
01:20:45,383 --> 01:20:46,759
Banner may never come back.

1213
01:20:47,051 --> 01:20:48,261
And we're stranded on a planet

1214
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:50,096
that is designed to stress me out.

1215
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:51,305
We're not stranded.

1216
01:20:51,389 --> 01:20:52,724
I'm gonna figure out
a way to get us home.

1217
01:20:53,266 --> 01:20:54,267
Thank you.

1218
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,602
Not your home, though. Asgard.
My home.

1219
01:20:56,936 --> 01:20:57,979
What?

1220
01:20:58,229 --> 01:20:59,814
Listen, my people are in great danger.

1221
01:21:00,398 --> 01:21:02,567
You and I, we have to fight
this really powerful being...

1222
01:21:02,817 --> 01:21:04,569
who also happens to be my sister.

1223
01:21:04,819 --> 01:21:06,487
Okay, that is so wrong on so many...

1224
01:21:06,696 --> 01:21:07,780
I don't wanna fight your sister.

1225
01:21:07,864 --> 01:21:09,115
That's a family issue.

1226
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:10,491
No, she's an evil being.

1227
01:21:10,575 --> 01:21:12,368
I don't care what she is.

1228
01:21:12,452 --> 01:21:14,620
I'm not fighting any more beings.
I'm sick of it.

1229
01:21:14,871 --> 01:21:15,872
- What?
- I just told you.

1230
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:17,707
If I turn into the Hulk,

1231
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:18,958
I am never gonna come back again.

1232
01:21:19,167 --> 01:21:20,209
And you don't care.

1233
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:22,086
No, no. I'm putting together the team.

1234
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:23,588
The Hulk is the fire.

1235
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,548
Wait, you're just using me
to get to the Hulk.

1236
01:21:25,798 --> 01:21:27,216
- What? No!
- It's gross.

1237
01:21:27,467 --> 01:21:29,135
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.

1238
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:31,137
No! I don't even like the Hulk.

1239
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:32,472
He's all like...

1240
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:34,056
"Smash, smash, smash."

1241
01:21:34,307 --> 01:21:35,308
I prefer you.

1242
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:37,226
Thanks.

1243
01:21:38,102 --> 01:21:39,604
But if I'm being honest,

1244
01:21:39,687 --> 01:21:41,063
when it comes to fighting evil beings...

1245
01:21:41,314 --> 01:21:42,607
he is very powerful and useful.

1246
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:44,734
Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too.

1247
01:21:45,026 --> 01:21:46,110
Is he though?

1248
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:48,404
How many PhDs does Hulk have?
Zero.

1249
01:21:48,613 --> 01:21:50,364
How many PhDs does Banner have?
Seven.

1250
01:21:51,324 --> 01:21:53,201
Fine, you don't have to fight anyone.

1251
01:21:53,451 --> 01:21:55,244
But we're in danger here,
so we have to move.

1252
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:00,416
What are you doing with that?

1253
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:01,584
I need a disguise.
I'm a fugitive.

1254
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:03,336
- I need a disguise.
- You are the disguise.

1255
01:22:04,212 --> 01:22:05,671
- I'll be Tony Stark.
- What?

1256
01:22:06,047 --> 01:22:07,632
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.

1257
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:10,343
No, no, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.

1258
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:11,803
Then why did you dress me up like Tony?

1259
01:22:12,053 --> 01:22:13,054
Because you were naked.

1260
01:22:13,221 --> 01:22:14,347
Okay, I'll give you that.

1261
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:16,474
What are you doing?
Stop doing that!

1262
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:17,934
Tony wears his pants super tight.

1263
01:22:18,017 --> 01:22:19,018
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry.

1264
01:22:19,352 --> 01:22:21,354
- Why are you being so weird?
- I don't know.

1265
01:22:21,646 --> 01:22:23,898
Maybe the fact that I was
trapped for two years...

1266
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:26,526
inside of a monster
made me a little weird.

1267
01:22:26,901 --> 01:22:28,444
Hey. Shh. It's okay.

1268
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:30,988
You're good. Calm down.
Come on.

1269
01:22:31,239 --> 01:22:32,532
Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard...

1270
01:22:32,782 --> 01:22:33,783
and you're not gonna have to think about

1271
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:34,867
the Hulk ever again.

1272
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:36,202
- All right?
- All right.

1273
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:41,958
Hulk!

1274
01:22:43,918 --> 01:22:45,503
Oh. This is bad.

1275
01:22:49,674 --> 01:22:51,008
Banner! Banner!

1276
01:22:55,054 --> 01:22:56,097
Banner!

1277
01:23:09,777 --> 01:23:10,820
Banner!

1278
01:23:11,362 --> 01:23:12,488
Thor!

1279
01:23:23,791 --> 01:23:24,792
Hi.

1280
01:23:25,084 --> 01:23:26,085
Hi.

1281
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:27,587
I was gonna do that.

1282
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:28,796
Yeah, well, I did it first.

1283
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:30,965
That's good.
What are you doing here?

1284
01:23:32,008 --> 01:23:33,593
What are you doing here?
I thought you were leaving.

1285
01:23:33,801 --> 01:23:34,802
I got sidetracked.

1286
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:36,262
What's with the...

1287
01:23:36,762 --> 01:23:37,847
It's my disguise.

1288
01:23:38,014 --> 01:23:39,015
But I can see your face.

1289
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:41,100
Not when I do this, you can't.

1290
01:23:41,893 --> 01:23:43,644
Your hair looks nice.
I like what you did with it.

1291
01:23:43,728 --> 01:23:45,146
Change it? Washed it maybe?

1292
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,612
What are those things on her eyes?

1293
01:23:52,695 --> 01:23:54,030
Are those the people that she's killed?

1294
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:55,740
She's so beautiful and
strong and courageous.

1295
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,033
Who is this guy?

1296
01:23:57,116 --> 01:23:58,117
- He's a friend.
- Who? Me?

1297
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:59,535
- I'm Bruce.
- I feel like I know you.

1298
01:23:59,785 --> 01:24:01,704
I feel like I know you, too.

1299
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:08,252
Look, I've spent years in a haze,

1300
01:24:08,336 --> 01:24:09,712
- trying to forget my past.
- Mmm.

1301
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:11,547
Sakaar seemed like the best place

1302
01:24:11,631 --> 01:24:13,883
to drink and forget, and to die one day.

1303
01:24:14,258 --> 01:24:15,885
I was thinking that you drink too much,

1304
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:17,345
and that probably was gonna kill you.

1305
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:18,596
I don't plan to stop drinking.

1306
01:24:18,763 --> 01:24:20,973
- Oh.
- But I don't wanna forget.

1307
01:24:21,223 --> 01:24:22,767
I can't turn away anymore...

1308
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:25,186
so if I'm gonna die...

1309
01:24:25,478 --> 01:24:27,063
well, it may as well be driving my sword

1310
01:24:27,146 --> 01:24:28,522
through the heart of that murderous hag.

1311
01:24:28,814 --> 01:24:30,274
- Good.
- Yeah.

1312
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:33,444
So, I'm saying that I wanna
be on the team.

1313
01:24:34,153 --> 01:24:35,363
Has it got a name?

1314
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:38,240
Yeah, it's called the Revengers.

1315
01:24:38,616 --> 01:24:39,617
Revengers?

1316
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:42,078
Because I'm getting revenge.
You're getting revenge.

1317
01:24:43,955 --> 01:24:45,247
Do you want revenge?

1318
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:47,541
I'm undecided.

1319
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:48,834
Okay.

1320
01:24:49,502 --> 01:24:51,212
Also, I've got a peace offering.

1321
01:24:54,507 --> 01:24:56,342
Surprise.

1322
01:25:02,098 --> 01:25:03,349
Ow.

1323
01:25:03,474 --> 01:25:04,809
Just had to be sure.

1324
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:09,605
Hello, Bruce.

1325
01:25:11,023 --> 01:25:12,775
So, last time I saw you,

1326
01:25:12,858 --> 01:25:13,985
you were trying to kill everybody.

1327
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:15,361
Where are you at these days?

1328
01:25:15,945 --> 01:25:17,655
It varies from moment to moment.

1329
01:25:18,489 --> 01:25:19,949
Is that a Dragonfang?

1330
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:21,701
It is.

1331
01:25:21,784 --> 01:25:22,827
My God.

1332
01:25:23,911 --> 01:25:25,871
This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.

1333
01:25:25,955 --> 01:25:27,790
Sakaar and Asgard are about as far apart

1334
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:29,041
as any two known systems.

1335
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:32,044
Our best bet is a wormhole
just outside of city limits.

1336
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:34,338
Refuel on Xandar,
and we can be back in Asgard

1337
01:25:34,422 --> 01:25:35,881
in 18 months.

1338
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:39,301
Nope. We are going through the big one.

1339
01:25:39,552 --> 01:25:40,553
The Devil's Anus?

1340
01:25:40,928 --> 01:25:41,929
Anus?

1341
01:25:42,096 --> 01:25:43,097
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?

1342
01:25:43,305 --> 01:25:44,306
For the record, I didn't know

1343
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:45,391
it was called that when I picked it.

1344
01:25:45,474 --> 01:25:47,059
That looks like a collapsing
neutron star...

1345
01:25:47,143 --> 01:25:49,562
inside of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

1346
01:25:49,979 --> 01:25:51,147
We need another ship.

1347
01:25:51,230 --> 01:25:52,648
That would tear mine to pieces.

1348
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:54,483
She's right. We need one
that can withstand

1349
01:25:54,567 --> 01:25:55,651
the geodetic strain from the singularity.

1350
01:25:55,943 --> 01:25:57,778
And has an offline power
steering system...

1351
01:25:57,862 --> 01:26:00,489
that could also function
without the on-board computer.

1352
01:26:00,781 --> 01:26:02,074
And we need one with cup holders,

1353
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:03,701
because we're gonna die. So, drinks!

1354
01:26:04,076 --> 01:26:05,870
Do I know you?
I feel like I know you.

1355
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,872
I feel like I know you, too.
It's weird.

1356
01:26:08,122 --> 01:26:09,123
What do you say?

1357
01:26:09,457 --> 01:26:10,458
Uncharted metagalactic travel

1358
01:26:10,541 --> 01:26:11,751
through a volatile cosmic gateway.

1359
01:26:12,084 --> 01:26:13,169
Talk about an adventure.

1360
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:15,463
- We need a ship.
- Need a ship.

1361
01:26:15,713 --> 01:26:16,714
There are one or two ships.

1362
01:26:16,797 --> 01:26:17,798
Absolute top of the line models...

1363
01:26:17,965 --> 01:26:19,258
I don't mean to impose...

1364
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,263
But the Grandmaster has
a great many ships.

1365
01:26:24,972 --> 01:26:26,348
I may even have stolen

1366
01:26:26,432 --> 01:26:28,392
the access codes to his security system.

1367
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:29,685
And suddenly you're overcome

1368
01:26:29,769 --> 01:26:30,853
with an urge to do the right thing.

1369
01:26:31,145 --> 01:26:32,146
Heavens, no.

1370
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:33,856
I've run out of favor
with the Grandmaster...

1371
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:35,775
and in exchange for codes
and access to a ship...

1372
01:26:36,067 --> 01:26:39,111
I'm asking for safe passage
through the Anus.

1373
01:26:39,487 --> 01:26:40,821
You're telling us that you can get us

1374
01:26:40,905 --> 01:26:42,031
access into the garage...

1375
01:26:42,114 --> 01:26:43,741
without setting off any alarms?

1376
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,743
Yes, brother. I can.

1377
01:26:45,993 --> 01:26:48,662
Okay, can I just...
A quick FYI.

1378
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:50,539
I was just talking to him
just a couple minutes ago...

1379
01:26:50,790 --> 01:26:53,167
and he was totally ready
to kill any of us.

1380
01:26:53,417 --> 01:26:54,502
He did try to kill me.

1381
01:26:54,794 --> 01:26:56,504
Yes, me too.
On many, many occasions.

1382
01:26:56,796 --> 01:26:58,255
There was one time when
we were children...

1383
01:26:58,506 --> 01:26:59,965
he transformed himself into a snake,

1384
01:27:00,049 --> 01:27:01,175
and he knows that I love snakes.

1385
01:27:01,425 --> 01:27:03,177
So, I went to pick up
the snake to admire it...

1386
01:27:03,427 --> 01:27:04,845
and he transformed back into himself

1387
01:27:04,929 --> 01:27:06,055
and he was like, "Yeah, it's me!"

1388
01:27:06,305 --> 01:27:09,183
And he stabbed me.
We were eight at the time.

1389
01:27:09,809 --> 01:27:10,851
If we're boosting a ship...

1390
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:12,561
we're gonna need to draw some
guards away from the palace.

1391
01:27:12,812 --> 01:27:14,105
Why not set the beast loose?

1392
01:27:14,313 --> 01:27:15,314
Shut up.

1393
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:16,565
You guys have a beast?

1394
01:27:16,774 --> 01:27:19,068
No, there's no beast.
He's just being stupid.

1395
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:20,778
We're going to start a revolution.

1396
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:22,321
- Revolution?
- I'll explain later.

1397
01:27:22,905 --> 01:27:25,074
- Who's this guy again?
- I'll explain later.

1398
01:27:26,283 --> 01:27:28,410
Is that some sort of protoplasm,

1399
01:27:28,494 --> 01:27:29,620
all the stuff that's coming out of you...

1400
01:27:29,787 --> 01:27:30,955
or are they eggs?

1401
01:27:32,456 --> 01:27:33,582
Looks like eggs.

1402
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:37,044
Oh!

1403
01:27:43,134 --> 01:27:44,343
I'm looking for Korg.

1404
01:27:44,718 --> 01:27:45,886
Who's asking?

1405
01:27:46,137 --> 01:27:47,221
I know you're asking.

1406
01:27:47,513 --> 01:27:49,390
Is anyone else asking, or is it just you?

1407
01:27:49,723 --> 01:27:51,684
The Lord of Thunder sends his best.

1408
01:27:55,354 --> 01:27:57,356
The revolution has begun.

1409
01:27:57,690 --> 01:27:59,608
Revolution?
How did this happen?

1410
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:01,318
Don't know.

1411
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:02,987
But the arena's mainframe

1412
01:28:03,070 --> 01:28:04,655
for the Obedience Disks
have been deactivated...

1413
01:28:04,905 --> 01:28:06,824
and the slaves have armed themselves.

1414
01:28:06,991 --> 01:28:08,951
Oh. I don't like that word.

1415
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:10,411
Which? Mainframe?

1416
01:28:10,661 --> 01:28:12,663
No. Why would I not like "mainframe"?

1417
01:28:12,913 --> 01:28:14,874
No, the "S" word.

1418
01:28:15,124 --> 01:28:17,668
Sorry, the prisoners with jobs
have armed themselves.

1419
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:20,421
Okay, that's better.

1420
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:28,429
Hey, so, listen.
We should talk.

1421
01:28:29,889 --> 01:28:30,931
I disagree.

1422
01:28:31,432 --> 01:28:34,226
Open communication was
never our family's forte.

1423
01:28:34,602 --> 01:28:35,603
You have no idea.

1424
01:28:35,769 --> 01:28:38,355
Been quite the revelation
since we last spoke.

1425
01:28:38,439 --> 01:28:39,440
Hello.

1426
01:28:40,524 --> 01:28:41,525
Hi.

1427
01:28:48,616 --> 01:28:50,159
Odin brought us together.

1428
01:28:51,243 --> 01:28:54,038
It's almost poetic that his death
should split us apart.

1429
01:29:00,169 --> 01:29:02,171
We might as well be strangers now.

1430
01:29:02,421 --> 01:29:05,382
Two sons of the crown, set adrift.

1431
01:29:05,716 --> 01:29:07,635
Oh.

1432
01:29:08,636 --> 01:29:10,054
Thought you didn't wanna talk about it.

1433
01:29:11,555 --> 01:29:12,556
Here's the thing.

1434
01:29:12,932 --> 01:29:14,600
I'm probably better off
staying here on Sakaar.

1435
01:29:14,808 --> 01:29:16,435
That's exactly what I was thinking.

1436
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:19,772
Did you just agree with me?

1437
01:29:20,064 --> 01:29:21,523
Come on, this place is perfect for you.

1438
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:23,400
It's savage, chaotic, lawless...

1439
01:29:23,609 --> 01:29:25,194
Brother, you're gonna do great here.

1440
01:29:25,444 --> 01:29:27,029
Do you truly think so little of me?

1441
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:30,908
Loki, I thought the world of you.

1442
01:29:32,117 --> 01:29:34,578
I thought we were gonna
fight side by side forever.

1443
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:37,581
But at the end of the day,
you're you and I'm me.

1444
01:29:38,374 --> 01:29:40,751
I don't know, maybe
there's still good in you.

1445
01:29:41,001 --> 01:29:42,169
But let's be honest,

1446
01:29:42,253 --> 01:29:44,421
our paths diverged a long time ago.

1447
01:29:49,218 --> 01:29:50,219
Yeah.

1448
01:29:51,428 --> 01:29:52,471
It's probably for the best

1449
01:29:52,554 --> 01:29:53,681
that we never see each other again.

1450
01:29:53,973 --> 01:29:55,057
That's what you always wanted.

1451
01:29:59,478 --> 01:30:01,063
Hey, let's do "Get Help."

1452
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:02,314
- What?
- "Get Help."

1453
01:30:02,398 --> 01:30:03,399
No.

1454
01:30:03,482 --> 01:30:04,483
- Come on, you love it.
- I hate it.

1455
01:30:04,566 --> 01:30:05,567
It's great.
It works every time.

1456
01:30:05,651 --> 01:30:07,278
- It's humiliating.
- Do you have a better plan?

1457
01:30:07,361 --> 01:30:08,904
- No.
- We're doing it.

1458
01:30:09,071 --> 01:30:10,739
We are not doing "Get Help."

1459
01:30:11,365 --> 01:30:13,033
Get help! Please!

1460
01:30:13,284 --> 01:30:14,285
My brother, he's dying.

1461
01:30:14,493 --> 01:30:16,412
Get help! Help him!

1462
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:19,707
Classic.

1463
01:30:19,873 --> 01:30:21,208
Still hate it.

1464
01:30:21,417 --> 01:30:23,669
- It's humiliating.
- Not for me, it's not.

1465
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:25,963
Now, which one's the ship
she told us to get?

1466
01:30:26,046 --> 01:30:27,047
<i>The Commodore.</i>

1467
01:30:27,965 --> 01:30:28,966
Right.

1468
01:30:31,719 --> 01:30:34,221
Though I feel it won't make
much of a difference.

1469
01:30:36,473 --> 01:30:38,142
Oh, Loki.

1470
01:30:39,393 --> 01:30:40,644
I know I've betrayed you
many times before...

1471
01:30:40,894 --> 01:30:42,438
but this time
it's truly nothing personal.

1472
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:44,565
The reward for your capture

1473
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:45,733
will set me up nicely.

1474
01:30:46,025 --> 01:30:47,443
Never one for sentiment, were you?

1475
01:30:47,818 --> 01:30:49,069
Easier to let it burn.

1476
01:30:49,403 --> 01:30:50,404
I agree.

1477
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:00,581
Oh, that looks painful.

1478
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:04,043
Oh, dear brother,
you're becoming predictable.

1479
01:31:04,418 --> 01:31:06,211
I trust you, you betray me.

1480
01:31:06,545 --> 01:31:08,464
Round and round in circles we go.

1481
01:31:08,756 --> 01:31:10,632
See, Loki, life is about,
it's about growth.

1482
01:31:10,924 --> 01:31:12,051
It's about change.

1483
01:31:12,301 --> 01:31:15,262
But you seem to just wanna stay the same.

1484
01:31:16,055 --> 01:31:17,598
I guess what I'm trying to say...

1485
01:31:17,848 --> 01:31:20,684
is that you'll always be
the God of Mischief...

1486
01:31:20,976 --> 01:31:22,311
but you could be more.

1487
01:31:24,938 --> 01:31:26,857
I'll just put this over here for you.

1488
01:31:27,483 --> 01:31:30,819
Anyway, all got places to be,
so good luck.

1489
01:31:36,283 --> 01:31:37,534
All right, I can figure this out.

1490
01:31:37,993 --> 01:31:39,745
It's just another spaceship.

1491
01:31:53,175 --> 01:31:54,468
<i>Loyal Sakaarians...</i>

1492
01:31:54,718 --> 01:31:56,595
<i>Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship</i>

1493
01:31:56,678 --> 01:31:58,055
<i>and my favorite champion.</i>

1494
01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:02,768
<i>Sakaarians, take to the skies.
Bring him down.</i>

1495
01:32:02,976 --> 01:32:04,603
<i>Do not let him leave this planet.</i>

1496
01:32:17,825 --> 01:32:19,076
- Good shot!
- Thanks.

1497
01:32:22,162 --> 01:32:23,163
<i>Open the doors.</i>

1498
01:32:23,247 --> 01:32:24,540
Okay.

1499
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:31,672
I hope that you're tougher than you look.

1500
01:32:31,839 --> 01:32:32,881
Why?

1501
01:32:45,436 --> 01:32:47,146
Shouldn't we be shooting
back or something?

1502
01:32:47,229 --> 01:32:48,230
Yes, we should.

1503
01:32:48,564 --> 01:32:50,315
Where are the guns on this ship?

1504
01:32:50,607 --> 01:32:51,900
<i>There aren't any.</i>

1505
01:32:52,151 --> 01:32:53,610
- It's a leisure vessel.
<i>- What?</i>

1506
01:32:53,902 --> 01:32:55,404
Grandmaster uses it for his good times,

1507
01:32:55,529 --> 01:32:56,530
orgies and stuff.

1508
01:32:56,905 --> 01:32:58,198
Did she just say the Grandmaster

1509
01:32:58,282 --> 01:32:59,408
uses it for orgies?

1510
01:32:59,658 --> 01:33:00,784
Yeah.

1511
01:33:01,034 --> 01:33:02,327
Don't touch anything.

1512
01:33:22,764 --> 01:33:24,057
No!

1513
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:28,061
- No!
- No!

1514
01:33:35,068 --> 01:33:36,111
Get inside!

1515
01:33:36,403 --> 01:33:37,821
In a minute.

1516
01:33:49,249 --> 01:33:51,084
I should probably go and help.
Here, take the wheel.

1517
01:33:51,168 --> 01:33:52,544
No. I don't know how to fly one of these.

1518
01:33:52,836 --> 01:33:54,588
You're a scientist.
Use one of your PhDs.

1519
01:33:54,671 --> 01:33:57,883
None of them are for flying
alien spaceships!

1520
01:34:32,668 --> 01:34:33,669
Okay, come on.

1521
01:34:33,752 --> 01:34:35,796
There's gotta be a gun on this thing.

1522
01:34:35,921 --> 01:34:36,922
That looks like a gun.

1523
01:34:38,257 --> 01:34:39,550
<i>It's my birthday</i>

1524
01:34:39,633 --> 01:34:40,676
<i>It's my birthday</i>

1525
01:34:41,635 --> 01:34:42,636
<i>It's my birthday</i>

1526
01:34:50,686 --> 01:34:51,770
Yeah!

1527
01:35:09,329 --> 01:35:11,415
Guys, we're coming up
on the Devil's Anus!

1528
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:19,214
There she is.

1529
01:35:19,506 --> 01:35:21,341
Our ticket out of here.

1530
01:35:22,009 --> 01:35:23,176
Hey, what's this?

1531
01:35:28,223 --> 01:35:29,308
Thank you.

1532
01:35:29,391 --> 01:35:31,893
Hey, man. We're about to jump
on that ginormous spaceship.

1533
01:35:31,977 --> 01:35:32,978
You wanna come?

1534
01:35:33,353 --> 01:35:35,981
You do seem like

1535
01:35:36,064 --> 01:35:37,566
you're in desperate need of leadership.

1536
01:35:37,983 --> 01:35:39,401
Why, thank you.

1537
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,281
Here we go.

1538
01:35:50,829 --> 01:35:51,830
Shit.

1539
01:36:09,389 --> 01:36:11,099
Asgardians...

1540
01:36:11,350 --> 01:36:13,769
some misguided soul...

1541
01:36:14,728 --> 01:36:16,605
has stolen the Bifrost sword.

1542
01:36:16,938 --> 01:36:19,149
Tell us where it is...

1543
01:36:19,441 --> 01:36:21,943
or there will be consequences.

1544
01:36:25,781 --> 01:36:26,907
Bad ones.

1545
01:36:30,243 --> 01:36:31,244
Well?

1546
01:36:38,377 --> 01:36:39,378
You.

1547
01:37:15,622 --> 01:37:19,584
Well? Executioner?

1548
01:37:24,631 --> 01:37:25,841
Wait!

1549
01:37:25,924 --> 01:37:26,925
Wait!

1550
01:37:29,302 --> 01:37:30,470
I know where the sword is.

1551
01:38:13,722 --> 01:38:15,891
I never thought I'd be back here.

1552
01:38:19,561 --> 01:38:21,021
I thought it'd be a lot nicer.

1553
01:38:21,563 --> 01:38:23,023
I mean, not that it's not nice.

1554
01:38:23,106 --> 01:38:24,483
It's just, it's on fire.

1555
01:38:24,733 --> 01:38:25,734
Here, up here in the mountains.

1556
01:38:26,193 --> 01:38:28,278
Heat signatures.
People clustered together.

1557
01:38:28,445 --> 01:38:29,446
She's coming for them.

1558
01:38:29,738 --> 01:38:30,739
Okay, drop me off at the palace

1559
01:38:30,822 --> 01:38:32,949
- and I'll draw her away.
- And get yourself killed?

1560
01:38:33,158 --> 01:38:34,826
The people trapped down there
are all that matters.

1561
01:38:34,910 --> 01:38:36,244
While I'm dealing with Hela,
I need you two

1562
01:38:36,328 --> 01:38:37,412
to help get everyone off Asgard.

1563
01:38:37,871 --> 01:38:39,498
How the hell are we supposed to do that?

1564
01:38:40,165 --> 01:38:41,708
I have a man on the ground.

1565
01:38:47,589 --> 01:38:48,590
Asgard.

1566
01:38:52,219 --> 01:38:53,386
She's here.

1567
01:39:05,106 --> 01:39:06,691
Now the ship has a gun.

1568
01:39:06,942 --> 01:39:08,026
I'll take it from here.

1569
01:39:08,985 --> 01:39:11,863
I found this in the armory.

1570
01:39:15,242 --> 01:39:16,243
Good luck.

1571
01:39:17,953 --> 01:39:19,120
Your Majesty...

1572
01:39:21,206 --> 01:39:22,249
don't die.

1573
01:39:25,252 --> 01:39:26,878
You know what I mean.

1574
01:40:25,937 --> 01:40:27,689
We must keep moving!

1575
01:40:28,481 --> 01:40:30,066
Go to the Bifrost!

1576
01:41:12,859 --> 01:41:13,944
Sister.

1577
01:41:16,237 --> 01:41:17,864
You're still alive.

1578
01:41:18,156 --> 01:41:20,033
I love what you've done with the place.

1579
01:41:20,116 --> 01:41:21,451
Redecorating, I see.

1580
01:41:21,826 --> 01:41:23,870
It seems our father's solution

1581
01:41:23,954 --> 01:41:26,414
to every problem was to cover it up.

1582
01:41:28,041 --> 01:41:29,542
Or to cast it out.

1583
01:41:31,878 --> 01:41:35,298
He told you you were worthy.
He said the same thing to me.

1584
01:41:36,007 --> 01:41:37,258
You see?

1585
01:41:38,009 --> 01:41:40,053
You never knew him.

1586
01:41:40,470 --> 01:41:42,222
Not at his best.

1587
01:41:42,514 --> 01:41:45,392
Odin and I drowned entire civilizations

1588
01:41:45,475 --> 01:41:46,977
in blood and tears.

1589
01:41:47,268 --> 01:41:50,063
Where do you think
all this gold came from?

1590
01:41:50,355 --> 01:41:51,940
And then, one day...

1591
01:41:52,232 --> 01:41:55,110
he decided to become a benevolent king.

1592
01:41:55,443 --> 01:41:57,946
To foster peace, to protect life...

1593
01:41:59,197 --> 01:42:00,657
to have you.

1594
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:03,493
I understand why you're angry.

1595
01:42:03,743 --> 01:42:05,203
And you are my sister, and technically

1596
01:42:05,286 --> 01:42:07,580
have a claim to the throne.

1597
01:42:07,831 --> 01:42:09,749
And believe me, I would love
for someone else to rule.

1598
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:10,959
But it can't be you.

1599
01:42:11,209 --> 01:42:14,713
You're just...
The worst.

1600
01:42:16,381 --> 01:42:17,924
Okay, get up.

1601
01:42:18,299 --> 01:42:20,176
You're in my seat.

1602
01:42:21,344 --> 01:42:23,221
You know, Father once told me...

1603
01:42:23,471 --> 01:42:25,932
that a wise king never seeks out war.

1604
01:42:26,182 --> 01:42:28,601
But must always be ready for it.

1605
01:43:01,009 --> 01:43:02,260
Go back!

1606
01:43:07,432 --> 01:43:08,683
Go!

1607
01:43:43,843 --> 01:43:46,221
To be honest, I expected more.

1608
01:43:49,474 --> 01:43:50,475
Heimdall!

1609
01:43:52,811 --> 01:43:54,437
The sword!

1610
01:43:59,025 --> 01:44:00,485
Here's the difference between us.

1611
01:44:00,819 --> 01:44:02,278
I'm Odin's firstborn...

1612
01:44:02,529 --> 01:44:04,823
the rightful heir, the savior of Asgard.

1613
01:44:05,115 --> 01:44:06,825
And you're nothing.

1614
01:44:17,085 --> 01:44:19,879
So simple, even a blind man could see it.

1615
01:44:22,173 --> 01:44:23,174
Oh.

1616
01:44:23,716 --> 01:44:25,844
Now you remind me of Dad.

1617
01:44:36,229 --> 01:44:37,897
The stupid dog won't die!

1618
01:45:00,003 --> 01:45:02,714
Everything's gonna be
all right now. I got this.

1619
01:45:03,214 --> 01:45:05,175
You wanted to know who I am?

1620
01:45:06,259 --> 01:45:07,760
What the hell are you talking about?

1621
01:45:08,052 --> 01:45:09,345
You'll see!

1622
01:45:58,102 --> 01:46:00,230
You see?
No one's going anywhere.

1623
01:46:00,521 --> 01:46:01,814
I'll get that sword...

1624
01:46:01,981 --> 01:46:04,609
even if I have to kill every
single one of them to do it.

1625
01:46:31,427 --> 01:46:32,679
Hey, man.

1626
01:46:33,972 --> 01:46:35,223
I'm Korg. This is Miek.

1627
01:46:35,473 --> 01:46:36,599
We're gonna jump on that spaceship

1628
01:46:36,683 --> 01:46:37,767
and get out of here.
Wanna come?

1629
01:46:47,402 --> 01:46:51,155
Your savior is here.

1630
01:46:58,788 --> 01:47:00,498
Did you miss me?

1631
01:47:00,832 --> 01:47:02,041
Everyone, on that ship now.

1632
01:47:06,587 --> 01:47:08,631
Welcome home.
I saw you coming.

1633
01:47:08,923 --> 01:47:09,924
Of course you did.

1634
01:47:26,774 --> 01:47:28,860
It's a valiant effort,
but you never stood a chance.

1635
01:47:30,028 --> 01:47:31,070
You see...

1636
01:47:31,946 --> 01:47:34,615
I'm not a queen or a monster.

1637
01:47:36,743 --> 01:47:38,286
I'm the Goddess of Death.

1638
01:47:39,537 --> 01:47:41,622
What were you the god of, again?

1639
01:47:53,259 --> 01:47:54,969
Even when you had two eyes...

1640
01:47:55,845 --> 01:47:57,555
you'd see only half the picture.

1641
01:47:59,098 --> 01:48:01,934
She's too strong.
Without my hammer, I can't.

1642
01:48:03,311 --> 01:48:06,689
Are you Thor, the God of Hammers? Hmm?

1643
01:48:09,942 --> 01:48:12,236
That hammer was to help
you control your power,

1644
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:13,571
to focus it.

1645
01:48:14,489 --> 01:48:16,074
It was never your source of strength.

1646
01:48:16,991 --> 01:48:19,118
It's too late.
She's already taken Asgard.

1647
01:48:20,370 --> 01:48:22,914
Asgard is not a place.
Never was.

1648
01:48:24,290 --> 01:48:25,375
This could be Asgard.

1649
01:48:26,751 --> 01:48:28,753
Asgard is where our people stand.

1650
01:48:29,754 --> 01:48:34,384
Even now, right now,
those people need your help.

1651
01:48:42,225 --> 01:48:44,227
I'm not as strong as you.

1652
01:48:47,105 --> 01:48:48,106
No...

1653
01:48:49,524 --> 01:48:50,775
you're stronger.

1654
01:48:59,909 --> 01:49:01,160
Tell me, brother.

1655
01:49:01,244 --> 01:49:03,579
What were you the god of again?

1656
01:51:19,257 --> 01:51:21,300
- You're late.
- You're missing an eye.

1657
01:51:21,634 --> 01:51:22,969
This isn't over.

1658
01:51:30,226 --> 01:51:31,852
I think we should disband the Revengers.

1659
01:51:33,521 --> 01:51:34,564
Hit her with a lightning blast.

1660
01:51:34,855 --> 01:51:35,982
I just hit her with the biggest
lightning blast

1661
01:51:36,065 --> 01:51:37,191
in the history of lightning.

1662
01:51:37,275 --> 01:51:38,276
It did nothing.

1663
01:51:42,071 --> 01:51:44,574
We just need to hold her off
until everyone's on board.

1664
01:51:45,366 --> 01:51:46,742
It won't end there.

1665
01:51:47,201 --> 01:51:50,454
The longer Hela's on Asgard,
the more powerful she grows.

1666
01:51:50,788 --> 01:51:52,373
She'll hunt us down.

1667
01:51:52,582 --> 01:51:54,000
We need to stop her here and now.

1668
01:51:54,292 --> 01:51:55,334
So what do we do?

1669
01:51:56,335 --> 01:51:57,670
I'm not doing "Get Help."

1670
01:52:10,057 --> 01:52:13,185
Asgard's not a place, it's a people.

1671
01:52:15,229 --> 01:52:16,230
Loki...

1672
01:52:16,564 --> 01:52:18,399
this was never about stopping Ragnarok.

1673
01:52:18,733 --> 01:52:20,610
This was about causing Ragnarok.

1674
01:52:20,818 --> 01:52:22,320
Surtur's crown, the vault.

1675
01:52:24,196 --> 01:52:25,406
It's the only way.

1676
01:52:26,115 --> 01:52:27,450
Bold move, brother.

1677
01:52:28,868 --> 01:52:30,202
Even for me.

1678
01:52:33,497 --> 01:52:34,498
Shall we?

1679
01:52:35,666 --> 01:52:36,667
After you.

1680
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:03,694
This is madness.

1681
01:53:17,249 --> 01:53:18,751
Go! Go, now!

1682
01:54:20,020 --> 01:54:21,313
For Asgard.

1683
01:54:35,745 --> 01:54:36,954
Hela!

1684
01:55:01,687 --> 01:55:05,691
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.

1685
01:55:16,952 --> 01:55:18,454
Hela, enough!

1686
01:55:22,291 --> 01:55:24,919
You want Asgard, it's yours.

1687
01:55:25,419 --> 01:55:28,631
Whatever game you're playing,
it won't work.

1688
01:55:28,881 --> 01:55:30,299
You can't defeat me.

1689
01:55:31,175 --> 01:55:32,426
No, I know.

1690
01:55:34,136 --> 01:55:35,137
But he can.

1691
01:55:39,642 --> 01:55:40,726
No.

1692
01:55:48,818 --> 01:55:52,112
Tremble before me, Asgard!

1693
01:55:52,363 --> 01:55:54,490
I am your reckoning!

1694
01:56:03,999 --> 01:56:05,417
The people are safe.

1695
01:56:06,168 --> 01:56:07,837
That's all that matters.

1696
01:56:09,755 --> 01:56:10,965
We're fulfilling the prophecy.

1697
01:56:11,715 --> 01:56:12,967
I hate this prophecy.

1698
01:56:13,259 --> 01:56:14,927
So do I, but we have no choice.

1699
01:56:15,219 --> 01:56:16,887
Surtur destroys Asgard...

1700
01:56:17,179 --> 01:56:19,390
he destroys Hela,
so that our people may live.

1701
01:56:19,515 --> 01:56:21,100
But we need to let him finish the job,

1702
01:56:21,183 --> 01:56:22,268
otherwise...

1703
01:56:24,019 --> 01:56:25,020
No!

1704
01:56:27,523 --> 01:56:29,358
Hulk, stop, you moron!

1705
01:56:38,576 --> 01:56:39,618
Hulk, stop.

1706
01:56:39,869 --> 01:56:42,705
Just for once in your life, don't smash.

1707
01:56:44,081 --> 01:56:45,666
Big monster!

1708
01:56:46,125 --> 01:56:47,209
Let's go!

1709
01:56:49,086 --> 01:56:50,087
Fine.

1710
01:57:14,278 --> 01:57:16,947
I am Asgard's doom!

1711
01:57:40,137 --> 01:57:42,097
The damage is not too bad.

1712
01:57:42,389 --> 01:57:44,266
As long as the foundations
are still strong...

1713
01:57:44,558 --> 01:57:45,893
we can rebuild this place.

1714
01:57:46,352 --> 01:57:48,437
It will become a haven...

1715
01:57:48,729 --> 01:57:51,440
for all peoples and aliens of the universe.

1716
01:57:58,489 --> 01:58:00,824
Now those foundations are gone. Sorry.

1717
01:58:16,048 --> 01:58:17,841
What have I done?

1718
01:58:19,134 --> 01:58:21,428
You saved us from extinction.

1719
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:23,305
Asgard is not a place...

1720
01:58:25,099 --> 01:58:26,642
it's a people.

1721
01:58:55,963 --> 01:58:57,381
It suits you.

1722
01:59:00,259 --> 01:59:02,594
Maybe you're not so bad
after all, brother.

1723
01:59:03,053 --> 01:59:04,096
Maybe not.

1724
01:59:05,556 --> 01:59:06,598
Thank you.

1725
01:59:07,516 --> 01:59:09,685
If you were here,
I might even give you a hug.

1726
01:59:14,189 --> 01:59:15,357
I'm here.

1727
01:59:39,590 --> 01:59:40,841
Your throne.

1728
01:59:56,148 --> 01:59:59,068
So. King of Asgard.

1729
02:00:09,745 --> 02:00:10,746
Where to?

1730
02:00:11,997 --> 02:00:13,248
I'm not sure.

1731
02:00:13,999 --> 02:00:15,084
Any suggestions?

1732
02:00:17,961 --> 02:00:19,671
Miek, where are you from?

1733
02:00:20,047 --> 02:00:21,840
Oh, Miek's dead.

1734
02:00:22,132 --> 02:00:25,135
Yeah, no, I accidentally
stomped on him on the bridge.

1735
02:00:25,302 --> 02:00:26,637
I've just felt so guilty,

1736
02:00:26,720 --> 02:00:27,888
I've been carrying him around all day.

1737
02:00:30,057 --> 02:00:31,975
Miek, you're alive!

1738
02:00:32,059 --> 02:00:33,227
He's alive, guys.

1739
02:00:33,310 --> 02:00:34,478
What was your question again, bro?

1740
02:00:36,313 --> 02:00:37,314
Earth it is.

1741
02:02:54,159 --> 02:02:55,577
Do you really think it's a good idea

1742
02:02:55,661 --> 02:02:56,745
to go back to Earth?

1743
02:02:57,329 --> 02:02:58,330
Yes, of course.

1744
02:02:58,413 --> 02:03:00,499
The people of Earth love me.
I'm very popular.

1745
02:03:01,041 --> 02:03:02,834
Let me rephrase that.

1746
02:03:03,210 --> 02:03:05,003
Do you really think it's a good idea

1747
02:03:05,087 --> 02:03:06,463
to bring me back to Earth?

1748
02:03:07,130 --> 02:03:09,091
Probably not, to be honest.

1749
02:03:09,174 --> 02:03:10,884
I wouldn't worry, brother.

1750
02:03:10,968 --> 02:03:13,971
I feel like everything's
gonna work out fine.

1751
02:09:43,068 --> 02:09:44,069
Oh, boy.

1752
02:09:50,659 --> 02:09:52,369
Oh.

1753
02:09:52,452 --> 02:09:56,456
I just gotta say, I'm proud of you all.

1754
02:09:56,873 --> 02:10:00,085
This revolution has been
a huge success. Yay, us!

1755
02:10:00,460 --> 02:10:02,837
Pat on the back.
Pat on the back.

1756
02:10:02,921 --> 02:10:05,173
Come on. No?

1757
02:10:05,715 --> 02:10:07,717
Me too. 'Cause I've been a big part of it.

1758
02:10:07,801 --> 02:10:10,595
Can't have a revolution without
somebody to overthrow.

1759
02:10:10,679 --> 02:10:12,555
So, you're welcome.

1760
02:10:12,847 --> 02:10:15,100
And, uh, it's a tie.
