00:14:49,447 --> 00:14:51,530
You're good at this, you know.

164
00:14:51,531 --> 00:14:53,988
- At what?
- At ruling.

165
00:14:53,989 --> 00:14:55,822
(SIGHS) No.

166
00:14:55,823 --> 00:14:56,823
You are.

167
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,322
You are.

168
00:15:00,739 --> 00:15:03,113
They respect you, they really do,

169
00:15:03,114 --> 00:15:05,279
- but you have to...
- (CHUCKLES)

170
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,697
Why are you laughing?

171
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,863
What did father used to say?

172
00:15:08,864 --> 00:15:12,196
Everything before the
word "but" is horse shit.

173
00:15:12,197 --> 00:15:13,697
He never said that to me.

174
00:15:13,698 --> 00:15:16,405
No. No, he never cursed
in front of his girls.

175
00:15:16,406 --> 00:15:19,488
SANSA: Because he was
trying to protect us.

176
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:22,488
He never wanted us to see
how dirty the world really is,

177
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:25,196
but Father couldn't protect
me and neither can you.

178
00:15:25,197 --> 00:15:26,482
Stop trying.

179
00:15:26,483 --> 00:15:27,905
All right, I'll stop
trying to protect you

180
00:15:27,906 --> 00:15:29,279
and you stop trying to undermine me.

181
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,489
I'm not trying to undermine you!

182
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,071
You have to be smarter than Father.

183
00:15:36,072 --> 00:15:38,738
You need to be smarter than Robb.

184
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:41,863
I loved them, I miss them,
but they made stupid mistakes,

185
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:43,905
and they both lost their heads for it.

186
00:15:43,906 --> 00:15:46,113
And how should I be smarter?

187
00:15:46,114 --> 00:15:47,572
By listening to you?

188
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,905
Would that be so terrible?

189
00:15:52,906 --> 00:15:55,864
A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace.

190
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:07,905
"Cersei of House Lannister,
First of Her Name,

191
00:16:07,906 --> 00:16:09,822
Queen of the Andals and the First Men,

192
00:16:09,823 --> 00:16:11,446
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms..."

193
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:12,906
What does she want?

194
00:16:14,155 --> 00:16:16,947
(SIGHS) Come to King's Landing.

195
00:16:16,948 --> 00:16:20,780
Bend the knee or suffer
the fate of all traitors.

196
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:22,905
You've been so consumed
with the enemy to the north,

197
00:16:22,906 --> 00:16:24,738
you've forgotten about
the one to the south.

198
00:16:24,739 --> 00:16:27,780
I'm consumed with the Night
King because I've seen him.

199
00:16:27,781 --> 00:16:30,405
And believe me, you'd think
of little else if you had, too.

200
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,113
We still have a wall between
us and the Night King.

201
00:16:32,114 --> 00:16:33,947
There's nothing between us and Cersei.

202
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:36,863
There's a thousand miles
between us and Cersei.

203
00:16:36,864 --> 00:16:39,655
Winter is here. The
Lannisters are a southern army.

204
00:16:39,656 --> 00:16:41,113
They've never ranged this far north.

205
00:16:41,114 --> 00:16:44,446
You're the military man, but I know her.

206
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:47,780
If you're her enemy, she'll never
stop until she's destroyed you.

207
00:16:47,781 --> 00:16:50,948
Everyone who's ever crossed
her, she's found a way to murder.

208
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,114
You almost sound as if you admire her.

209
00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:01,948
I learned a great deal from her.

210
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:40,655
What is this?

211
00:17:40,656 --> 00:17:43,321
It's what we've been
waiting for our whole lives.

212
00:17:43,322 --> 00:17:46,113
It's what Father trained us
for, whether he knew it or not.

213
00:17:46,114 --> 00:17:47,613
He knew it.

214
00:17:47,614 --> 00:17:49,571
Made me memorize every damn city, town,

215
00:17:49,572 --> 00:17:51,154
lake, forest, and mountain.

216
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:53,322
It's ours now. We just have to take it.

217
00:17:54,864 --> 00:17:57,196
You've been quiet since you came home.

218
00:17:57,197 --> 00:17:58,655
Are you angry with me?

219
00:17:58,656 --> 00:18:00,906
No, not angry.

220
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,030
Are you afraid of me?

221
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,155
Should I be?

222
00:18:09,948 --> 00:18:13,863
Daenerys Targaryen has
chosen Tyrion to be her Hand.

223
00:18:13,864 --> 00:18:16,655
Right now, they're sailing
across the Narrow Sea,

224
00:18:16,656 --> 00:18:19,655
hoping to take back her father's throne.

225
00:18:19,656 --> 00:18:22,071
Our little brother,

226
00:18:22,072 --> 00:18:24,238
the one you love so much,

227
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:26,071
the one you set free,

228
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:29,363
the one who murdered our
father and our first-born son,

229
00:18:29,364 --> 00:18:32,698
now he stands beside our
enemies and gives them counsel.

230
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:40,405
He's out there somewhere
at the head of an armada.

231
00:18:40,406 --> 00:18:42,114
Where will they land?

232
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:46,238
Dragonstone.

233
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:49,029
They have deep-water
ports for the ships.

234
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,029
Stannis left the castle unoccupied,

235
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,488
and that's where she was born.

236
00:18:52,489 --> 00:18:54,780
Enemies to the east.

237
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:56,571
Enemies to the south...

238
00:18:56,572 --> 00:18:59,571
Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.

239
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,405
Enemies to the west...

240
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,238
Olenna, the old cunt.

241
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:06,446
Another traitor.

242
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:08,613
Enemies to the north.

243
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,738
Ned Stark's bastard has
been named King in the North

244
00:19:11,739 --> 00:19:14,738
and that murdering whore
Sansa stands beside him.

245
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:17,405
Enemies everywhere. We're
surrounded by traitors.

246
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,113
You're in command of
the Lannister army now.

247
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:22,238
- How do we proceed?
- Winter is here.

248
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,530
We can't win a war if we can't
feed our men and our horses.

249
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:29,697
The Tyrells have the grain,
the Tyrells have the livestock.

250
00:19:29,698 --> 00:19:31,738
Will the Tyrell
bannermen stand alongside

251
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:35,029
a Dothraki horde and
Unsullied slave soldiers?

252
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,697
If they think Daenerys will win.

253
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:39,655
No one wants to fight
on the losing side.

254
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:42,781
Right now, we look like the losing side.

255
00:19:44,072 --> 00:19:45,905
I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

256
00:19:45,906 --> 00:19:48,655
Three kingdoms, at best.

257
00:19:48,656 --> 00:19:51,196
I'm not sure you understand
how much danger we're in.

258
00:19:51,197 --> 00:19:52,988
I understand we're
in a war for survival.

259
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:56,029
I understand whoever loses dies.

260
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,321
I understand whoever wins
could launch a dynasty

261
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,905
that lasts a thousand years.

262
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:02,488
A dynasty for whom?

263
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:05,488
Our children are dead.

264
00:20:05,489 --> 00:20:06,947
We're the last of us.

265
00:20:06,948 --> 00:20:08,989
A dynasty for us, then.

266
00:20:12,155 --> 00:20:13,698
We never talked about Tommen.

267
00:20:16,698 --> 00:20:18,655
There's nothing to say.

268
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:20,613
Our baby boy killed himself.

269
00:20:20,614 --> 00:20:22,154
He betrayed me.

270
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:23,655
He betrayed us both.

271
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,488
Should we spend our
days mourning the dead...

272
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:26,905
Mother, father, and all our children?

273
00:20:26,906 --> 00:20:29,488
- Cersei...
- I loved them. I did.

274
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:32,697
But they're ashes now and
we're still flesh and blood.

275
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,698
We're the last Lannisters,
the last ones who count.

276
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:44,196
Even Lannisters can't
survive without allies.

277
00:20:44,197 --> 00:20:47,363
Where are our allies now?

278
00:20:47,364 --> 00:20:49,571
You saw what happened to
Walder Frey and his family.

279
00:20:49,572 --> 00:20:51,238
I heard.

280
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:53,780
- How could we ever trust a man like that?
- We couldn't.

281
00:20:53,781 --> 00:20:55,780
He was a useless, old coward,

282
00:20:55,781 --> 00:20:57,613
but the Freys supported us.

283
00:20:57,614 --> 00:20:58,988
Now they're all dead.

284
00:20:58,989 --> 00:21:00,697
Whoever killed them
is no friend of ours.

285
00:21:00,698 --> 00:21:02,238
We need allies.

286
00:21:02,239 --> 00:21:04,029
Stronger, better allies.

287
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,155
We can't win this war alone.

288
00:21:08,155 --> 00:21:11,781
You think I listened to Father
for 40 years and learned nothing?

289
00:21:16,656 --> 00:21:19,197
(SEAGULLS SCREECHING)

290
00:21:48,781 --> 00:21:50,279
JAIME: The Greyjoys?

291
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,863
You invited the Greyjoys
to King's Landing?

292
00:21:52,864 --> 00:21:55,697
- Not all of them.
- Well, it looks like all of them.

293
00:21:55,698 --> 00:21:57,279
I invited Euron Greyjoy,

294
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,780
the new King of the Iron Islands.

295
00:21:59,781 --> 00:22:02,488
You said yourself we needed
stronger, better allies.

296
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:05,613
- There you are.
- How are they better allies?

297
00:22:05,614 --> 00:22:08,029
How are they different from the Freys?

298
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,613
They both broke their promises

299
00:22:09,614 --> 00:22:11,905
and murdered their former
friends as soon as it suited them.

300
00:22:11,906 --> 00:22:14,905
So does everyone when it suits them.

301
00:22:14,906 --> 00:22:17,530
Unlike the Freys, they have ships.

302
00:22:17,531 --> 00:22:20,154
- And they're good at killing.
- They're not good at anything.

303
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:23,571
I know the ironborn. They're
bitter, angry little people.

304
00:22:23,572 --> 00:22:25,144
All they know how to do is steal things

305
00:22:25,145 --> 00:22:26,745
they can't build or grow themselves.

306
00:22:26,781 --> 00:22:28,905
Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.

307
00:22:28,906 --> 00:22:30,947
Oh, what did he come here for, then?

308
00:22:30,948 --> 00:22:32,614
A queen.

309
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,530
EURON: The moment I was chosen
Lord of the Iron Islands,

310
00:22:48,531 --> 00:22:50,905
they turned on me. (CHUCKLES)

311
00:22:50,906 --> 00:22:52,154
Their own uncle.

312
00:22:52,155 --> 00:22:54,780
They stole my best ships and ran.

313
00:22:54,781 --> 00:22:56,947
Sailed them right across the world

314
00:22:56,948 --> 00:22:59,238
and gave them to the Dragon Queen

315
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:02,697
so she could bring her
armies here to attack you.

316
00:23:02,698 --> 00:23:06,154
It's nothing compared to
the treason you suffered

317
00:23:06,155 --> 00:23:09,822
at the hands of a family
member, from what I hear.

318
00:23:09,823 --> 00:23:12,531
But still, it bothers me.

319
00:23:14,155 --> 00:23:17,196
Murdering them would
make me feel a lot better.

320
00:23:17,197 --> 00:23:21,363
And since it appears that all
our treasonous family members

321
00:23:21,364 --> 00:23:23,279
are fighting for the same side,

322
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,822
I thought we rightful monarchs

323
00:23:25,823 --> 00:23:28,406
could murder them together.

324
00:23:34,406 --> 00:23:37,197
You're not a rightful
monarch, though, are you?

325
00:23:41,322 --> 00:23:44,321
The Greyjoys rebelled against the
throne for the right to be monarchs,

326
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:48,363
but as I recall, you
were soundly defeated.

327
00:23:48,364 --> 00:23:50,196
Come to mention it,

328
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:52,571
weren't you the one who
started that rebellion

329
00:23:52,572 --> 00:23:56,780
by sailing to Casterly Rock
and burning the Lannister fleet?

330
00:23:56,781 --> 00:23:58,488
You certainly caught us there.

331
00:23:58,489 --> 00:24:01,321
Very smart move on your part.

332
00:24:01,322 --> 00:24:05,571
Of course, we all made it
to the Iron Islands anyway.

333
00:24:05,572 --> 00:24:06,780
I was there.

334
00:24:06,781 --> 00:24:08,613
I remember very well.

335
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,154
I saw you.

336
00:24:10,155 --> 00:24:12,446
I heard so much talk.

337
00:24:12,447 --> 00:24:16,071
The best in the world.
No one can stop him.

338
00:24:16,072 --> 00:24:17,780
I didn't believe it, to be honest.

339
00:24:17,781 --> 00:24:21,071
But I must say when you
rushed through the breach

340
00:24:21,072 --> 00:24:23,239
and started cutting people down...

341
00:24:26,739 --> 00:24:28,446
it was glorious.

342
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:29,863
Like a dance.

343
00:24:29,864 --> 00:24:33,071
The people I was cutting
down were your own kin.

344
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:35,405
The place was getting crowded.

345
00:24:35,406 --> 00:24:37,988
I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.

346
00:24:37,989 --> 00:24:40,196
And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.

347
00:24:40,197 --> 00:24:42,655
A good thing for me.

348
00:24:42,656 --> 00:24:46,279
If you hadn't crushed us, I
wouldn't have gone into exile.

349
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,196
If I hadn't done that,

350
00:24:48,197 --> 00:24:51,781
I wouldn't be the greatest
captain on the 14 seas.

351
00:24:52,823 --> 00:24:54,656
If not the most humble.

352
00:24:55,948 --> 00:24:56,948
You're not humble.

353
00:24:58,906 --> 00:25:00,906
You're the queen of a great nation.

354
00:25:02,197 --> 00:25:03,863
You don't care about the Iron Islands.

355
00:25:03,864 --> 00:25:08,530
They're nothing but
rocks and bird shit and...

356
00:25:08,531 --> 00:25:11,405
And a lot of very unattractive people.

357
00:25:11,406 --> 00:25:14,029
The Iron Fleet, on the other hand,

358
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,154
that's something else entirely.

359
00:25:17,155 --> 00:25:20,446
It's the greatest armada
Westeros has ever seen.

360
00:25:20,447 --> 00:25:25,029
With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas.

361
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,863
You can defeat the invaders of the east

362
00:25:27,864 --> 00:25:30,822
and the pretenders of
the north and south.

363
00:25:30,823 --> 00:25:32,447
What do you want in return?

364
00:25:34,531 --> 00:25:37,571
Ever since I was a little boy,

365
00:25:37,572 --> 00:25:39,488
I wanted to grow up and marry

366
00:25:39,489 --> 00:25:41,613
the most beautiful woman in the world.

367
00:25:41,614 --> 00:25:44,321
So here I am,

368
00:25:44,322 --> 00:25:46,780
with a thousand ships

369
00:25:46,781 --> 00:25:48,322
and two good hands.

370
00:25:53,739 --> 00:25:55,322
I decline your proposal.

371
00:25:57,823 --> 00:25:58,863
Why?

372
00:25:58,864 --> 00:26:00,531
You're not trustworthy.

373
00:26:01,948 --> 00:26:04,029
You've broken promises to allies before

374
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,488
and murdered them at
the nearest opportunity.

375
00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:08,030
You murdered your own brother.

376
00:26:09,364 --> 00:26:11,697
You should try it. Feels wonderful.

379
00:26:15,364 --> 00:26:17,738
You need proof of my honest intentions.

380
00:26:17,739 --> 00:26:19,196
In my experience,

381
00:26:19,197 --> 00:26:22,196
the surest way to a woman's
heart is with a gift.

382
00:26:22,197 --> 00:26:24,488
A priceless gift.

383
00:26:24,489 --> 00:26:26,363
I won't return to King's Landing

384
00:26:26,364 --> 00:26:28,406
until I have that for you.

00:29:52,447 --> 00:29:54,405
What's the weight?

412
00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:57,364
Um, 147.

413
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,363
I was wondering if you had
considered my proposition.

414
00:30:03,364 --> 00:30:06,446
I don't remember your proposition.

415
00:30:06,447 --> 00:30:09,738
I asked you if, in light of
what I've seen in the North,

416
00:30:09,739 --> 00:30:12,905
if I could have access to the
restricted area of the library.

417
00:30:12,906 --> 00:30:14,613
That area is reserved for maesters.

418
00:30:14,614 --> 00:30:17,113
- Are you a maester?
- No.

419
00:30:17,114 --> 00:30:19,239
Not a very strong proposition, is it?

420
00:30:28,531 --> 00:30:31,196
Archmaester, with respect,

421
00:30:31,197 --> 00:30:33,029
I've seen them...

422
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,279
The Army of the Dead.

423
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,655
The white walkers.

424
00:30:37,656 --> 00:30:40,154
I was sent here to
learn how to defeat them,

425
00:30:40,155 --> 00:30:42,697
but everyone in the Citadel,

426
00:30:42,698 --> 00:30:44,863
those who will even talk to me,

427
00:30:44,864 --> 00:30:47,697
they all doubt the walkers
ever existed in the first place.

428
00:30:47,698 --> 00:30:50,238
Everyone in the Citadel
doubts everything.

429
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,322
It's their job.

430
00:30:56,864 --> 00:31:00,155
But the tales of the Long
Night can't be pure fabrication.

431
00:31:01,989 --> 00:31:04,905
Too many similarities
from unconnected sources.

432
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:07,488
Sources in the restricted area?

433
00:31:07,489 --> 00:31:09,114
The very same.

434
00:31:10,406 --> 00:31:11,863
And the simplest explanation

435
00:31:11,864 --> 00:31:14,822
for your grating obsession
with the white walkers

436
00:31:14,823 --> 00:31:16,321
is that you're telling the truth

437
00:31:16,322 --> 00:31:19,446
and that you saw what you say you saw.

438
00:31:19,447 --> 00:31:22,322
So, you believe me.

439
00:31:23,489 --> 00:31:25,154
I do.

440
00:31:25,155 --> 00:31:26,864
You'll finish weighing that heart?

441
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:31,989
That makes you the only person
south of the Twins who does.

442
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,863
We're not like the
people south of the Twins.

443
00:31:37,864 --> 00:31:40,072
And we're not like the
people north of the Twins.

444
00:31:42,406 --> 00:31:46,322
In the Citadel, we lead different
lives for different reasons.

Don't remember any meal but the last,

448

can't see forward to any but the next.

449
00:31:58,781 --> 00:32:00,947
And every time you leave
the house and shut the door,

450

When Robert's Rebellion was raging,

452
00:32:06,864 --> 00:32:08,697
people thought the end was near.

453
00:32:08,698 --> 00:32:11,780
The end of the Targaryen
dynasty. "How will we survive?"

454
00:32:11,781 --> 00:32:15,238
When Aegon Targaryen
turned his eye westward

455
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:17,196
and flew his dragons
to Blackwater Rush...

456
00:32:17,197 --> 00:32:19,238
"The end is near! How will we survive?"

457
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:22,113
And thousands of years before
that, during the Long Night,

458
00:32:22,114 --> 00:32:24,238
we can forgive them for
thinking it truly was the end.

459
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:26,948
But it wasn't. None of it was.

460
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:31,280
The Wall has stood through it all.

461
00:32:32,572 --> 00:32:35,531
And every winter that
ever came has ended.

We can't tell you.

645

Only the fire can tell you.

646
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:20,698
What do you see?

647
00:45:22,447 --> 00:45:23,905
Logs burning.

00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:45,071
Ice.

651
00:45:45,072 --> 00:45:46,989
A wall of ice.

652
00:45:49,406 --> 00:45:50,406
The Wall.

653

What else?

654
00:45:54,447 --> 00:45:58,656
It's where the Wall meets the sea.

655
00:45:59,864 --> 00:46:02,072
There's a castle there.

656
00:46:09,489 --> 00:46:10,988
There's a mountain.

657
00:46:10,989 --> 00:46:14,447
Looks like an arrowhead.
