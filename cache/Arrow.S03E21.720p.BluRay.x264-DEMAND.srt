1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,128
My name was Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,800
For three years, I worked to save my city.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,970
But to save my sister,
I had to become someone else.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,640
I had to become something else.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,649
Previously on Arrow:

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,890
You can still save her, Oliver.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,762
Take your rightful place as heir to the demon
and Ra's al Ghul will bring your sister back.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,847
I have fulfilled my end
of our arrangement.

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,883
I suggest you begin
to make peace with yours.

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,122
The only way I'm gonna survive this
is if I know that you're out there...

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,651
...living your life happy.

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,843
Oliver Queen is dead.
And for now, only the Arrow...

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,442
...Al Sah-him shall
remain heir to the demon.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,722
Oliver Queen is alive
only in the past. He is forgotten.

15
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,207
Oliver Queen is alive only in the past.
He is forgotten.

16
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,561
You are Al Sah-him.

17
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,729
You have made great progress
in three weeks...

18
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,731
...Al Sah-him.

19
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,647
You no longer flinch
upon hearing your new name.

20
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,923
Oliver Queen is alive only in the past.

21
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,969
He's forgotten.

22
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,331
Indeed. You are Al Sah-him.

23
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,000
You are Wareeth al Ghul, heir to the demon.

24
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,850
My lord...

25
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,964
...I apologize for this interruption.

26
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,685
We captured this intruder.

27
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,644
Why then is he still yet alive?

28
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,449
He is known to Al Sah-him.

29
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,131
What the hell is going on?

30
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,563
Clearly, he made another attempt
to free Al Sah-him.

31
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,685
Well, then it falls on Al Sah-him
to deal with him.

32
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,689
Oliver, they're lying to you.

33
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,482
I never made it home.
They've had me here prisoner for weeks.

34
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,651
My oath of mercy on your friends
was premised by your fealty. Prove it.

35
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,131
No, Oliver, listen to me.

36
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,401
They're lying to you-

37
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,241
We can get out of here. You and me
working together. There's still a chance.

38
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,965
Remove his chains.

39
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,085
Give him your sword, Sarab.

40
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,724
I will not kill an unarmed man.

41
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,731
That's the way this is. You've been here
for a few weeks and you forget who you are.

42
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,402
Remember when you brought me
into your crusade?

43
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,285
I told you I would be here to remind you
who Oliver was...

44
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,642
...if you ever became something else.

45
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,570
I haven't given up on that promise.

46
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,925
Fight.

47
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,685
The past three weeks, you've
been exposed to a rare herb, centuries old.

48
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,204
Causes one's conscience
to come to the forefront of their mind...

49
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,084
...so it's the only thing they see.

50
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,646
The herb's effect is
different for everyone.

51
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,282
Some people see family and loved ones.

52
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,041
Others encounter trusted
friends or teachers.

53
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,288
What did you see?

54
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,769
Very well.

55
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,645
There is something else
I wish you to see. Come.

56
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,285
Where?

57
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,169
The past.

58
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,444
A place now home only for the dead.

59
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,881
I had the vial in my hand.

60
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,044
What's happening is not your fault.

61
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,289
- Shrieve is to blame. This is his doing.
- I can't get through.

62
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,770
Everyone's calling the police.
We're all inoculated, remember?

63
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,883
I want to get back to my son.

64
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,727
I've not been back to this
place since I pledged myself to the League.

65
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,001
What happened here?

66
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,680
When I joined the League,
I was conscripted with another man...

67
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,604
...Damien Darhk.

68
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,083
We would become the prized agents
of Ra's al Ghul.

69
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,089
We were his horsemen.

70
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,363
And he molded us into warriors
the likes the world had never seen.

71
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,406
We were as brothers.

72
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,801
What happened to him?

73
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,766
He believed himself worthy
of becoming heir to the demon.

74
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,201
But I was the one chosen.

75
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,442
So you had to kill him.

76
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,210
Yes.

77
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,330
But, you see, I hesitated.

78
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,808
With that hesitation,
he found an opportunity to escape.

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,925
Taking with him his loyalists
and water from the Lazarus Pit.

80
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,085
And he has vexed me ever since.

81
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,964
And you.

82
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,245
- I don't follow.
- Damien continues the League's ways...

83
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,923
...but through his own organization
filled with a hive of agents...

84
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,724
...devoted to his own agenda.

85
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,327
Last year, he tried to purchase
Malcolm Merlyn's earthquake generator.

86
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,251
He gave Gholem Qadir safe haven
to Markovia...

87
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,842
...and he hired Mark Shaw to steal
a secret file from A.R.G.U.S.

88
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,247
This was all the work of one man?

89
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,682
The list goes on.

90
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,289
Many lives have been lost,
others endangered.

91
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,246
And all because I was slow
to swing a vengeful sword.

92
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,761
And I will not have my heir...

93
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,530
...haunted by the same mistake.

94
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,964
What is it you wish me to do?

95
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,321
There is a rival who claims to be heir
to the demon.

96
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,081
You must eliminate this threat
from your reign.

97
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,923
And you must do so without mercy.

98
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,241
Didn't you hear?
Masks aren't wanted in Starling no more.

99
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,208
Tell that to the woman you mugged.

100
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,607
You underestimated your opponent again.

101
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,365
I should've known he had a knife.

102
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,206
- He didn't have a knife.
- What the hell...?

103
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,324
He had two.

104
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,204
Shall we continue your training?

105
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,890
I'm starving.

106
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,369
There's a diner near here that serves the best
black-and-white milkshakes in Starling City.

107
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,801
What is a black-and-white milkshake?

108
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,687
I never understood your country's need
to fry everything.

109
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,208
That's because everything
tastes better that way.

110
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,607
This is more oil than potato.

111
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,604
Dip it in your milkshake.

112
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,211
I sense you mocking me.

113
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,767
Heh. I'm serious.

114
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,362
Here, dip it in your milkshake.

115
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,966
I have to admit, it's fun
seeing you like this.

116
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,246
- Like what?
- Like a normal person.

117
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,284
I am a normal person.

118
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,965
I can't believe you said that.

119
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,645
Mm.

120
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,961
That's actually not bad.

121
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,286
And the student becomes the teacher.

122
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,446
You have a point.

123
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,884
For me, normal is a world
where only the strong survive.

124
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,362
One without simple pleasures.

125
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,162
Thank you, Laurel.

126
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,402
I was alone and adrift.

127
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,284
And you have shown me kindness.

128
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,006
I'm only returning the favor.

129
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,368
Isn't that what you did for Sara?

130
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,408
There's little comparison
between my situation...

131
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,887
...and Sara's after her time
with Oliver on Lian Yu.

132
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,761
What's wrong?

133
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,043
It's about Oliver.

134
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,208
There's something that I haven't told you.

135
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,009
He's in Nanda Parbat.

136
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,720
I don't understand.

137
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,567
He's accepted your father's offer
to become the next Ra's.

138
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,722
You should not have kept that from me.

139
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,206
I'm sorry, it's just...

140
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,690
it's just that you seem so happy, and
after what happened with your father, I...

141
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,486
And here comes the CAT-5 prong
into the Ethernet port.

142
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,241
Even if she knew what that was,
even if I knew what that was...

143
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,211
...I think Sara is still young
for chicken cacciatore.

144
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,246
My mom used to feed me nachos from the bar
at The Grand before I was off the bottle.

145
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,528
- And I turned out normal.
- lsh.

146
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,404
John, what's the house rule?

147
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,851
No Glocks on the dinner table.

148
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,845
How did it go out there tonight?

149
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,371
Your intel was spot-on.

150
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,605
Caught four Halcones at the docks
trying to unload a shipment of M16s.

151
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,611
Well, I'm especially proud
you didn't get yourself killed.

152
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,968
That was my favorite part too.

153
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,248
If you're gonna keep going out,
we should design you some sort of...

154
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,442
Do not say "costume."

155
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,489
Okay. Identity concealment.

156
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,681
Eventually we're going to have to figure
out a new status quo, a working one...

157
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,285
...now that...

158
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,448
Ollie's gone.

159
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,809
How are you doing?

160
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,645
Having never been resurrected before, I don't
really have anything to compare it to.

161
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,805
- I mean, about Oliver being gone.
- I don't know.

162
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,440
Mornings are the worst.

163
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,600
I can't really leave the loft, so...

164
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,450
It's nice to be able to come here.

165
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,564
You are always welcome in our home.

166
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,728
I just miss him.

167
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,163
The fact that he's gone because of me...

168
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,641
He wouldn't want you blaming yourself.

169
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,291
The military, they have a saying for a
soldier that makes the ultimate sacrifice:

170
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,569
Gone but never forgotten.

171
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,081
Gone but never forgotten.

172
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,369
Liling's apartment
is just a few more blocks north.

173
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,770
Waller said there wasn't a cure.

174
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,164
The United States Army. Shrieve's men.

175
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,725
That's not a cure
they're giving those people.

176
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,371
It's the virus.

177
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,121
Shrieve's leaving nothing to chance.
Wants to infect as many people as possible.

178
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,608
We have to stop him.
Hey! Get away from there.

179
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,687
Move. Move.

180
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,801
Tatsu, the truck.

181
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,851
I had him.

182
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,401
- What do we do now?
- Destroy it.

183
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,324
All of it.

184
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,407
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you about Oliver earlier.

185
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,244
It was your right to know.

186
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,927
I just... Things were
going so well for you.

187
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,091
You seemed happy. I didn't wanna upset you.
I still shouldn't have kept it from you.

188
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,121
Were I so inclined...

189
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,160
...I'd question why your first instinct
is to always keep matters secret.

190
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,722
Even after doing so cost you your
relationship with your father.

191
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,446
But I have much greater concerns.

192
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,927
What's going on?

193
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,966
You should go.

194
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,130
No.

195
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,563
I'm not leaving.
Friends don't do that to one another.

196
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,806
Now that Oliver has ascended to his
position as heir to the demon...

197
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,168
...he will come for me...

198
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,364
...with as many men as it takes
to see me dead.

199
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,048
Tonight, Nyssa al Ghul faces justice
for her betrayal.

200
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,442
Wait a second, Oliver wouldn't.
I don't see how.

201
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,087
What she's trying to say is Oliver
would never do anything to hurt you.

202
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,363
The only reason he joined the League
is to protect people he loves.

203
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,609
And what you need to understand
is that Oliver Queen is dead.

204
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,086
He's a memory.

205
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,408
Apparently, the League
has some of their recruits...

206
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,204
...undergo a process of reprogramming.

207
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,246
Like brainwashing? Oliver never said
that he was signing on for brainwashing.

208
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,330
The League's ways are shrouded
in ritual and ceremony.

209
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,849
- Oliver would not know it was happening.
- I don't care. Oliver, he is stronger than that.

210
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,485
I did not come here to debate.

211
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,411
Laurel insisted
that I bring this news to you myself.

212
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,763
But I can see all I'm doing
is damaging your memory of him.

213
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,851
Perhaps it is better for you to not think
of what Oliver has become.

214
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,925
You can have that luxury.

215
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,446
- Wait, where are you going?
- To face him. And if necessary, my destiny.

216
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,483
I will not cower in the shadows
waiting for death.

217
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,240
Great. Now what are we supposed to do?

218
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,886
Nothing. No offense, but Nyssa is insane.

219
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,003
Oliver is still Oliver.

220
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,761
Nobody knows the League
better than Nyssa.

221
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,442
Did you see her face? She was terrified.
I didn't think that was possible.

222
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,361
- Even if Nyssa's right about Oliver...
- She isn't.

223
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,006
Getting between her and the League
isn't an option.

224
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,568
Since when does Ra's' daughter
become someone we stick our necks out for?

225
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,162
I know you're furious with Ra's
for what he's done to Oliver. We all are.

226
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,089
But Nyssa...

227
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,725
...she saved my sister's life.

228
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,610
She gave her a home. She's a good person.

229
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,651
In spite of everything
that she grew up with.

230
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,689
And the last time I checked...

231
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,048
...protecting good people,
that is what we do.

232
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,450
Fine. Nyssa does seem to have an idea
where we can find Oliver and the League.

233
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,648
We shouldn't have let Nyssa leave alone.

234
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,287
No, it's fine.
I just put a tracking device on her.

235
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,605
This isn't my first day.

236
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,246
Everybody, get back!

237
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,646
Away from the truck!

238
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,601
No more virus.

239
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,768
We have to get back to Akio.

240
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,761
Come on.

241
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,726
- Anything?
- Nyssa hasn't stopped moving.

242
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,207
- I'm still getting a strong signal.
- Copy that.

243
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,641
Radio check every five minutes.

244
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,321
- What?
- If anything happens with Nyssa...

245
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,085
...let me handle it on my own.

246
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,082
- We're talking about the League of Assassins.
- I know that. I just...

247
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,130
Oliver. You were closer to him
than any two people I've known.

248
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,362
- You should not have to...
- What, fight him?

249
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,685
Kill him?

250
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,403
Laurel, it's not gonna come to that.
Look, I'm with Felicity.

251
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,242
There's nothing that Ra's al Ghul can do that
can turn Oliver against the people he loves.

252
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,445
Right.

253
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,528
Nice secret headquarter upgrade.

254
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,643
Does Mr. Palmer know
you guys are in here?

255
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,242
Yes. He's out of town,
and how did you get in here?

256
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,451
My dad's a super villain
and you left your doors unlocked.

257
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,051
Right.

258
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,728
I've been distracted.

259
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,642
Because you and Mr. Diggle
are trying to save the city by yourselves?

260
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,806
Look, I've been thinking.

261
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:33,046
Um, maybe rather than
me sitting at home alone, miserable...

262
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,483
...maybe I could be out there
helping you guys.

263
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,083
I mean, you seem like you're shorthanded
one and vigilante skills run in my blood.

264
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,525
Thea, this might actually be
the worst week ever for this conversation.

265
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,690
- What's going on?
- I can't.

266
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,089
Felicity, I cannot be handled right now.

267
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,049
It's possible, and I stress "possible,"
that Oliver is back in town.

268
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,964
With the League.

269
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,767
I don't understand.

270
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,724
Why would Ollie come back here?

271
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,803
- They're after Nyssa.
- Ollie would never...

272
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,090
Nyssa thinks he's under some sort
of League mind voodoo.

273
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,964
But it's gonna be fine.

274
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,491
We're handling it.

275
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,924
You are a terrible liar.

276
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,043
That is true.

277
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,965
You know where he is?
Maybe I could just talk to him.

278
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,085
I don't know what doctor's orders are when
someone gets brought back from the dead...

279
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,602
...but I'm sure getting into a fight
with the League goes against them.

280
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,964
I can get through to him.

281
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,924
Please, Thea.

282
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,164
Oliver wouldn't want you involved.

283
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,170
He did what he did
so that you would stay out of harm's way.

284
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,081
Yeah, well,
sounds like Ollie is not here anymore.

285
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,326
This is where my beloved spirit
departed this world.

286
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,602
Do you even remember Sara?

287
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,646
Or has my father already obliterated her
from your memory?

288
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,002
I'm here to bring you back to Nanda Parbat.

289
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,803
To face justice?

290
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,809
If so, for what crime?

291
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,488
To face vengeance?

292
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,444
If so, for what offense?

293
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,768
You told me...

294
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,248
...vengeance is justice.

295
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,448
And you bested me in battle.

296
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,404
That won't happen again.

297
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,723
Do it. If I would die,
I would have it on the same ground as Sara.

298
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,330
Oh, my God.

299
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,523
We can't let you hurt her, man.

300
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,685
Oliver.

301
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,010
You should not have interfered.

302
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,844
Well, I am sorry...

303
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,884
...but I have lost a sister,
a father, Oliver...

304
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,327
There's no way
that I was about to lose you too.

305
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,681
You don't understand.

306
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,042
You already have.

307
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,245
I was marked for death the moment
Oliver accepted my father's offer.

308
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,441
Laurel, these past few weeks...

309
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,762
...they've enlightened me...

310
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,402
...to live a life outside
of my father's rule.

311
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,289
To be someone else even for a little while
brought me great happiness.

312
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,806
But I am daughter of the demon.

313
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,569
Happiness is not something
that was ever meant for me.

314
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,448
I've known Oliver my entire life.

315
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,246
We've been friends since childhood.

316
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,122
- But tonight I did not recognize him.
- I told you...

317
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,049
...he has been changed.

318
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,247
Well, if he can change, then why can't you?

319
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,969
How's Nyssa?

320
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,524
She's with Laurel. She's gonna be okay.

321
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,890
How are you?

322
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,681
Same as you, probably.

323
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,246
Neither one of us believed Nyssa
when she said Oliver had been turned.

324
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,247
I'm still not sure I believe it.

325
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,126
I've heard about this kind of thing.

326
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,966
Guy gets captured by the enemy...

327
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,164
...he gets broken.

328
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,122
I just never imagined Oliver...

329
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,130
Still can't imagine that Oliver would...

330
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,961
He's the strongest man I've ever known,
Felicity.

331
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,731
When Oliver stayed,
when he agreed to join the League...

332
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,810
...he never could have known
this was what he was agreeing to.

333
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,083
Only way I've been able
to get out of bed these past weeks...

334
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,567
...is because I knew
that Oliver was still alive.

335
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,922
He is alive, Felicity.

336
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:49,729
We thought that Oliver
was just giving up his life to Ra's...

337
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,568
...but he gave up his soul.

338
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,241
There was doubt you would return.

339
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,204
But not from me.

340
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,640
What happened?

341
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,803
Nyssa had friends.

342
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,407
I warned you not to face her alone.

343
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,568
These friends of Nyssa's...

344
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,928
...were they friends of yours?

345
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,326
They'll be protecting her now.

346
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,683
We need to draw her out.

347
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,887
Thank you for coming

348
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,402
Suffice it to say,
I was surprised to get your call.

349
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,568
I need your help.

350
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,727
That couldn't have been easy
for you to say.

351
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,206
I need to know.

352
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,687
Is Ollie back in town?

353
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,406
Is he going after Nyssa?

354
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,685
According to my sources,
he intends to eliminate her...

355
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,161
...as a threat to his ascension to Ra's.

356
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,283
Well, I need to stop him.

357
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,642
He is Wareeth al Ghul now, Thea.

358
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,166
Heir to the demon.

359
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,002
He is my brother. It's one thing to let him join
the League and run off to Nanda Parbat, but...

360
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,611
Another to let him kill?

361
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,048
What did you think he would be doing
in the League of Assassins?

362
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,403
Felicity told me that
he's been brainwashed.

363
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,962
I know what it's like to kill
while under the influence of someone else.

364
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,646
Your brother didn't sacrifice everything
for you to go to war with the League.

365
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,045
- That's what Felicity said.
- And she was right.

366
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,366
No.

367
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,286
I couldn't stop him
from trading his life to save mine.

368
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,529
But this? This, I can stop.

369
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,127
You are a warrior, Thea.

370
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,243
Long before I trained you.

371
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,046
You have always had an incredible strength
inside you...

372
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,244
...and your brother knows that too.

373
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,131
Now...

374
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,765
...what do you need from me?

375
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,891
Are you sure this is okay?

376
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,767
Yeah. With Oliver and the League
running around, it's best we stay close.

377
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,088
Especially if something...

378
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,811
John?

379
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,605
Something's wrong. Lyla?

380
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,044
Where's Lyla?

381
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,243
- John.
- Oliver?

382
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,125
First, let me assure you
that no harm will come to Lyla...

383
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,164
...if you do exactly as I say.

384
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,288
Bring Nyssa to the warehouse at Fullerton
and Halsted, and I'll let your wife go.

385
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,687
Oliver, I swear, if you
do anything to Lyla...

386
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,522
You have 30 minutes.

387
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,206
Laurel.

388
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,326
- What happened?
- Oliver and his new friends took Lyla.

389
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,126
- What? Where's Sara? Is she okay?
- With John's neighbor.

390
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,170
- What's wrong with you?
- Hey, it is not Nyssa's fault.

391
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,691
No, just her people.

392
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,450
You call yourself warriors?

393
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,724
You claim to have honor?
If you knew the meaning of the word...

394
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,491
- ...there are lines you do not cross!
- John, back off.

395
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,846
You back off!

396
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,364
I am truly sorry. I never meant for any
harm to come to you or your family.

397
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,005
Yeah, Nyssa?

398
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,049
Then prove it.

399
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,524
Hand yourself over to the League.

400
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,202
What? We're just gonna negotiate
with them now?

401
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,926
Are we just gonna give in?
Turn over an innocent person?

402
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,687
She's not innocent.
She's the daughter of the demon.

403
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,810
- She's killed hundreds of people.
- Enough.

404
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,367
Only thing that matters
is getting Lyla back.

405
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,722
- I don't care how we do it.
- Yes, you do.

406
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,764
Trading one person's life for another?
We're better than that.

407
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,930
It's all right.
You should exchange me for your beloved.

408
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,049
- I won't see an innocent life taken for mine.
- What? No.

409
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,447
I'm not gonna let you commit suicide.

410
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,483
Don't you remember what you said?

411
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,524
These past few weeks
have been some of the best of your life.

412
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,886
I remember.

413
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,607
And I remember telling you
that happiness is something denied to me.

414
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,929
Where is the exchange to take place?

415
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,208
No. There has to be another way.

416
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,449
Another way to save Lyla
without turning Nyssa over to the League.

417
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,247
And if there isn't,
even if you get Lyla back safe and sound...

418
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,808
...Oliver won't be the only one
who lost his soul.

419
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,283
What happened to you?

420
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,450
Johnny told me,
but how could you become this?

421
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,921
Quiet. It'll be over soon.

422
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,681
No. I genuinely wanna know.

423
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,764
How could the man
who stood up at my wedding do this?

424
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,007
How could the man...

425
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,123
...who's been like a brother...?
Quiet!

426
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,930
You know, when John's brother died...

427
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,242
...a part of him died too.

428
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,571
His guilt and the emptiness from the loss
outweighed everything.

429
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,122
I tried my hardest to help him.

430
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,642
But no one seemed to be able to comfort him
or fill that void...

431
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,442
...until he met you.

432
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,043
You gave him hope and purpose again.

433
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,890
It's time.

434
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,684
Aki0.

435
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,244
- Aki0.
- Aki0.

436
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,561
Liling's sick.

437
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,761
It's gonna be okay.

438
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,000
- We have to leave Hong Kong.
- Shrieve and his men...

439
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,680
- Have enough to worry about.
- Tatsu's right.

440
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,005
The chaos will give us cover.
It could be our only chance.

441
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,729
They're here.

442
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,769
Search them.

443
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,208
Where's my wife?

444
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,047
Where's my wife?

445
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,160
You son of a bitch.

446
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,288
Whatever Ra's did to you...

447
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,329
Don't you dare touch me.

448
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,726
Oliver, this isn't you. Look at me.

449
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,561
I know you're still in there somewhere.

450
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,766
Bind her.

451
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,489
You're free to go.

452
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,166
- Johnny. I thought they were going for Sara.
- It's okay.

453
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:56,206
Everything's fine. Sara's fine.
I told Felicity, this is just like Jakarta.

454
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,290
- Kneel before the true heir to the demon.
- I kneel before no one.

455
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,726
Laurel.

456
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,410
Nyssa.

457
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,451
You're still Oliver.

458
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,842
I don't care if the hood is black or green.

459
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,851
You're still you.

460
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,361
Get away from him.

461
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,201
Get away from him
or the next one goes in your eye.

462
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,360
Lyla's got Sara. They're
headed out of town.

463
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,040
- There is no straightening this out.
- I don't know.

464
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,448
I can't see past tomorrow right now.

465
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,841
They're gonna kill Nyssa.

466
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,042
- Oliver or her father, they're gonna kill her.
- I'm sorry, Laurel.

467
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,365
It's not fair.

468
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,210
No. No, it's not.

469
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,686
I'll ask it...

470
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,729
...to ask it.

471
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,887
There is no way of getting him back?

472
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,082
He's gone, Felicity.

473
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,771
No one wants to believe that less than me.

474
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,249
But he's gone.

475
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,643
There's only one thing left of him now.

476
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,246
And what's that?

477
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,441
Us.

478
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,842
Gone but never forgotten.

479
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,646
There are no more threats to my reign.

480
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,402
Your fealty continues to impress me,
Al Sah-him.

481
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,807
You truly are Wareeth al Ghul.

482
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,610
And yet my daughter
still does not approve of my choice.

483
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,490
Fortunately, what I require from you
is not your approval.

484
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:15,011
- Did you search her?
- It does not appear to be on her person.

485
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,287
Bring me her weapons.

486
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,166
You know, as a young child...

487
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,211
...Nyssa displayed the panache of a thief.

488
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,810
Always stealing extra qatayef after meals
and then stowing them away in her quarters.

489
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,208
She would grow to learn
that there is nothing she can hide from me.

490
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,842
Her exploits of late...

491
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,929
...seem to have clouded that memory.

492
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,445
I will remember you
as the warrior you once were...

493
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,961
...and not as this shell
that stands before me.

494
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,530
All my life, I've lived in fear of you.

495
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,569
But now as I stand before you
ready to leave this earth...

496
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,643
...I want you to know...

497
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,487
...I am not afraid.

498
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,689
Do what needs to be done, my heir.

499
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,568
And take with it the satisfaction
that your reign will be unchallenged.

500
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,367
I can see now you do not require a culling
to solidify your reign.

501
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,681
You have broken your rival, Al Sah-him...

502
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,360
...something I wasn't able to do as heir.

503
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,609
Spilling her blood now
would only serve as gluttony.

504
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,608
And perhaps her blood
could be of another purpose.

505
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,607
As a means to unite our families.

506
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,609
You as husband.

507
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,604
And you as wife.

508
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,121
I would rather die
than become his betrothed.

509
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,086
Well, your wishes were no longer my
concern from the moment you betrayed me.

510
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,007
So you will marry Al Sah-him...

511
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,931
...and you will become bride of the demon.

512
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,928
Come on, come on, come on.

513
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,808
We need a vehicle.

514
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,284
Oliver.

515
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,690
- Let's get out of this place.
- It's okay. We're safe now.

516
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,845
Thea?

517
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,568
The door was open.

518
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,443
Sorry to interrupt your staring
into nothingness.

519
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,291
He should have let me die.

520
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,682
That was never an option.

521
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,842
It's why I love him.

522
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,729
I didn't know...

523
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,690
...about you and my brother.

524
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,202
Yeah, well...

525
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,688
It was complicated.

526
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,208
But I did love him.

527
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,010
Despite everything, I still do.

528
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,363
I do too.

529
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,568
How is that even possible...

530
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,922
...after what he's...

531
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,685
Become?

532
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,530
I don't know.

533
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:25,406
But I think John's right. I think we have
to remember the best parts of him...

534
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,847
...and we have to move on.

535
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:32,170
Are you trying to convince me or yourself?

536
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,169
Both of us.

537
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,725
I don't know how,
but we have to go on living.

538
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,722
That's what Oliver...

539
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,089
Ollie would want for you.

540
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,441
To move on.

541
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,765
To live.

542
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,282
To be with the one that you love
while you still can.

543
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,761
Roy's gone, so...

544
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,602
You've had a lot on your plate.

545
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,442
And I've been trying to think of
the right time to tell you this.

546
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,924
Roy's alive.

547
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,927
We faked his death. It's a long story...

548
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,568
...as most fake death stories are.
We were gonna tell you, I promise.

549
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,207
You were busy being mostly dead,
Oliver signed on to become Darth Oliver...

550
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,689
- Wait, I don't...
- He's starting a new life.

551
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,327
One that hopefully includes you.

552
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,410
If you want it.

553
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,449
When my daughter left Nanda Parbat...

554
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,365
...she absconded something critical
to both our futures.

555
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,247
Do you recall the village I showed you?
The one where only the dead remain?

556
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,482
- It was your home.
- It was.

557
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,286
And I was obligated
to unleash death upon it.

558
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,649
It has been this way
ever since there has been a Ra's.

559
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,286
You see, it is the final
act of ascension...

560
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,801
...the transformation to Demon's Head...

561
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,287
...the erasure of one's former life...

562
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,766
...former home.

563
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:45,763
Now, my predecessor, he wiped away
Alexandria, Egypt with cholera in 1609.

564
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,571
Today you will do the same.

565
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,521
Do you recognize this?

566
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,326
The Alpha and Omega bio-weapon.

567
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,090
Beginning and the end.

568
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,609
Now, Nyssa stole this to prevent my heir
from doing that which you will do today.

569
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,290
You will unleash this on Starling City.
