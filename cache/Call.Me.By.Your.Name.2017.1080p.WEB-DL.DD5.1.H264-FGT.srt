The word "apricot"
comes from the Arabic.

145
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,150
It's like the words "algebra,"
"alchemy," "alcohol."

146
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,820
It derives from an Arabic noun

147
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,819
combined with the Arabic article "al"
before it.

148

The origin of our Italian albicocca

You're right in the case
that most Latin words

do find their origins in Greek words.

157
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,784
However, in the case of "apricot,"

158
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,695
it's a little bit more
of a complicated journey.

How so?

160
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:45,223
Well, here, the Greek actually
takes over from the Latin.

Latin word being
praecoquum or precoquere.

162
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,163
So it's, "precook" or "pre-ripen,"
as you know.

To be precocious or premature.
