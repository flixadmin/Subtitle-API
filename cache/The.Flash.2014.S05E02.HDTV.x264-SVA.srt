1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,427
Previously on "The Flash"...

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:02,781
You never come back.

3
00:00:02,784 --> 00:00:04,168
You are not stuck here, are you?

4
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,184
- Bye, Cisco.
- Bye, Sandy.

5
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,718
My father's death certificate.

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,848
The ME who signed off
on it, he doesn't exist.

7
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,398
- So this death certificate...
- Is a fake.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,518
- Who the hell are you?
- What do you want?

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,239
For all of you

10
00:00:18,242 --> 00:00:19,748
to die.

11
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,404
What the...

12
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,598
Damn, man.

13
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,388
Another fight?

14
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,778
Yeah.

15
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,748
I'd hate to see the other guy.

16
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,418
See you on the floor.

17

18
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,468
So you're not stuck here.

19
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,123
No, I'm not.

20
00:02:19,126 --> 00:02:21,307
So they will reverse
tachyons in your system?

21
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,818
Were put there because of me.

22
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,248
Are you kidding?

23
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:27,168
You know how many credit
card points I just blew

24
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,188
trying to get rid of
your negative tachyons?

25
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,658
I just bought a brand
new spectral tachyeometer

26
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,298
when I could have my Fiji get away.

27
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,998
Not that I have anyone
to go with, anymore.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,048
I'm not taking you to Fiji, Ralph.

29
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,802
Why didn't you guys tell
us about this before?

30
00:02:50,252 --> 00:02:52,060
Oh, my God!

31
00:02:52,063 --> 00:02:53,877
Barry never returns?

32
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,468
That's why you came here.

33
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,348
To see you father,

34
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,660
because you were raised without him.

35
00:03:11,388 --> 00:03:12,935
So what?

36
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,828
Iris.

37
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,912
So what that that article
says that you never come back.

38
00:03:19,915 --> 00:03:21,918
So what if the other one
says that you vanished.

39
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,878
I mean, it's said other
things before, right?

40
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,348
We made it say other things before.

41
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,168
So whatever the future brings

42
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,508
we are gonna deal with
it when it gets here.

43
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,598
And change it if we need to.

44
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,888
She has a point.

45
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:40,599
If there's anything
Team Flash is good at,

46
00:03:40,602 --> 00:03:42,974
it's handing the future
its own ass and then some.

47
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,068
What he said.

48
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,068
Well, looks like Nora's

49
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,688
gonna need more training after all.

50
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,682
- Oh, okay.
- She's hungry.

51
00:03:54,685 --> 00:03:55,927
Yeah, why don't we, uh,

52
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,470
all meet back at
S.T.A.R. Labs, all right?

53
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:05,127
Wow, first you meet your
adult daughter from the future

54
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,388
and now this.

55
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,588
I mean, it's a lot.

56
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,980
Yeah.

57
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:16,477
Well, I guess now I know why

58
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,098
she never wants to leave her dad's side

59
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,648
and why she...

60
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,618
Never wants to be by mine.

61
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,518
Nora will reach out at some point.

62
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,660
The trick is you gotta
keep yourself busy.

63
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,998
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Dad.

64
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,758
Joe!

65
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,720
- Cecile?
- Cecile, what's wrong?

66
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:51,417
I can't hear what she wants.

67
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,388
I can't hear anything.

68
00:04:55,808 --> 00:04:57,596
I think I'm losing my powers.

69
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,938
Hey babe, uh, it's me,

70
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,148
just checking in, for my dad.

71
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,000
He...

72
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:17,440
- Hello there.
- Hey.

73
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,818
- What are you doing?
- I was just trying to get

74
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,385
Barry's new suit into this ring.

75
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:24,008
Oh, it's... it's tiny.

76
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,798
Yeah, you weren't watching
old holograms of Gipsy.

77
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,136
- Why would I be doing that?
- Because you miss her.

78
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:32,057
We just had something so special.

79
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,628
Shouldn't it have work?

80
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,338
Of course now it's
not so special anymore

81
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,768
now she's just rattlin'
around inside my head.

82
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,988
I'm sorry this is so hard for you.

83
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,097
But it's okay that you are
still thinking about her.

84
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,768
I don't think you understand, Caitlin.

85
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:46,828
I mean, she's literally...

86
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,478
inside my head.

87
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,768
I can't vibe.

88
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,408
Everything I vibe connects to her.

89
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,818
I put some music on, I hear
her voice singing along.

90
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,148
I'm painting my
figurines, I see her face

91
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,488
on Captains Kirk's body. Shh...

92
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,368
Do you smell that?

93
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,488
Of course you don't.

94
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:08,143
'Cause that's her perfume
and I'm only one smelling it.

95
00:06:08,146 --> 00:06:10,868
- Of course.
- Your powers linked you guys

96
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,208
over pan-dimensional spacetime,
so it makes complete sense

97
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,543
that your vibes echoes would still be...

98
00:06:14,545 --> 00:06:15,968
Connecting us to each other.

99
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,548
Yes, I know. Thank
you for the diagnosis.

100
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,428
- I'm sorry.
- You don't need a doctor.

101
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,320
You need a friend.

102
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,008
I'm sorry. I'm just...

103
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,768
I'm a mess.

104
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:29,573
- Oh, perfect.
- Been looking for you two.

105
00:06:29,576 --> 00:06:30,693
We need to talk.

106
00:06:30,696 --> 00:06:32,158
I've hit a real wall
trying to figure out

107
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,560
who forged this death certificate,

108
00:06:33,563 --> 00:06:35,517
so I was thinking maybe
Cisco could give this

109
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,398
a little bit of a...

110
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,917
Cisco is not available right now.

111
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,263
Please leave a message.

112
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,027
Oh, hey, Cisco, it's Ralph.

113
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,618
Hope you are doing well.
Just get back to me.

114
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,368
I need to vibe this as soon as possible.

115
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,698
Bye, bye.

116
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,408
Ralph, um, Cisco can't vibe right now,

117
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,798
so we're just gonna have to
deal with this a little later.

118
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,708
- Why can't he vibe right now?
- What's going on?

119
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:56,878
Because we need to
help him get over Gipsy.

120
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,088
I mean, like you said,
Cisco get his vibe back,

121
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,729
- we can crack this case.
- Please, stop caring about me.

122
00:07:01,732 --> 00:07:03,808
Ralph, I mean, you don't
have any ideas about

123
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,718
how to help a man get
over a heartbreak, do you?

124
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,718
Oh, my God, you stop it, girl.

125
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,938
You know I have plenty.

126
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,658
Cisco, you wanna know
why I'm perfect guy

127
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,938
to help you get over this and
get back into the game of love?

128
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,398
Because trust me, buddy,
nobody, I mean nobody,

129
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,084
has been kicked out
of that more than me.

130
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,308
- Hello, Bobby.
- Vanessa Jansen.

131
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,278
You got out of the slammer.

132
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,188
Now I'm gonna loosen up that chokehold

133
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,938
you and that punk-ass brother of yours

134
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,198
have on all the big
arms deals in this city.

135
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,250
I don't think so.

136
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,818
What the hell?

137
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,948
Do you know what four
years in Iron Heights

138
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,238
will do to you, Bobby?

139
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,948
It makes you very, very, angry.

140
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:14,178
Vanessa, you Cain't gonna do this.

141
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,788
Vanessa, please.

142
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:34,665
Okay.

143
00:08:36,035 --> 00:08:37,813
So this is where the Moretti brothers

144
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:40,455
- have been running guns.
- Yeah.

145
00:08:42,235 --> 00:08:44,625
Stealing from these
guys takes some cojones.

146
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:48,073
Any idea who our bold thieve might be?

147
00:08:48,075 --> 00:08:50,073
- Not yet.
- Made my rounds too.

148
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:53,105
So far the only prints belong
to Bobby and Bruno Moretti.

149
00:08:53,108 --> 00:08:55,346
Well, whoever did this,
they're running fast and loose.

150
00:08:55,349 --> 00:08:56,732
- Mm-hmm.
- If we don't stop this,

151
00:08:56,735 --> 00:08:59,206
a lot of high powered weapons
are gonna flood the streets.

152
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:01,112
Central City is gonna be a war zone.

153
00:09:01,115 --> 00:09:02,643
Don't worry about the city, friend.

154
00:09:02,645 --> 00:09:05,233
CCPD's finest are on the case.

155
00:09:05,235 --> 00:09:08,853
- And you are...
- Nora, CSI intern.

156
00:09:08,855 --> 00:09:13,103
- Who are you?
- The captain of CCPD.

157
00:09:13,105 --> 00:09:16,393
Captain David Singh. Oh I've
read so much about you.

158
00:09:16,395 --> 00:09:18,483
It's really nice to meet you.

159
00:09:18,485 --> 00:09:20,103
You hired an intern, Allen?

160
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:23,863
I am very sorry, sir,

161
00:09:23,865 --> 00:09:26,310
but I needed help with, um,

162
00:09:26,313 --> 00:09:28,402
the cases that accumulated
while I was suspended

163
00:09:28,405 --> 00:09:29,753
and you said the Mayor wasn't going

164
00:09:29,755 --> 00:09:31,163
to give us any money to help solve them,

165
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:34,228
so I hired an intern to help for free.

166
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:36,637
Mm.

167
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,503
Well, make her official
when you get back.

168
00:09:38,505 --> 00:09:40,475
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

169
00:09:42,635 --> 00:09:44,273
I know you're surprised to see me

170
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:46,463
but I found this badge and
this jacked and thought,

171
00:09:46,465 --> 00:09:48,593
"I'm a CSI too" so I should help my dad.

172
00:09:48,595 --> 00:09:49,943
Right, okay.

173
00:09:49,945 --> 00:09:51,613
You said you were still a rookie, right?

174
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,783
Well, yeah, but forensic
sciences in the future

175
00:09:53,785 --> 00:09:56,783
is like way advance, so I can
totally handle a robbery scene.

176
00:09:56,785 --> 00:10:00,103
- Like, not a prob.
- Ah, got you.

177
00:10:00,105 --> 00:10:03,233
- That's great.
- What is that?

178
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,363
That I haven't gotten to yet.

179
00:10:05,365 --> 00:10:07,784
But it looks like somebody
wanted their pound of flesh.

180
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:09,060
- Nora, wait.
- Wha...

181
00:10:09,063 --> 00:10:10,793
- What are you doing?
- You can't touch that.

182
00:10:10,795 --> 00:10:12,203
You'll contaminate the evidence.

183
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:13,823
Sorry, you mean you don't have

184
00:10:13,825 --> 00:10:16,283
a scene-wide modified
bosonic frequency field

185
00:10:16,285 --> 00:10:18,245
to avoid cross-contamination?

186
00:10:18,248 --> 00:10:21,213
I don't even think we have
some of those words yet.

187
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:23,923
Oops. Well... ugh.

188
00:10:23,925 --> 00:10:27,473
It's just this seems way
denser than human tissue.

189
00:10:27,475 --> 00:10:29,803
Yeah, you're right, actually.

190
00:10:31,895 --> 00:10:34,653
I can't even move this thing.

191
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:38,473
This isn't a pound of flesh.
This is a whole human body.

192
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:41,466
That is so schway.

193
00:10:41,469 --> 00:10:43,313
Let's hold off in telling
the Mayor about this

194
00:10:43,315 --> 00:10:44,813
until we have some more info.

195
00:10:44,815 --> 00:10:47,146
She's still be upset
about the Lang homicide.

196
00:10:49,085 --> 00:10:51,003
Hey, Captain, did you mean Gridlock?

197
00:10:51,005 --> 00:10:52,653
I thought he was locked
up in Iron Heights.

198
00:10:52,655 --> 00:10:54,627
Iris, it's a pleasure to see you.

199
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,053
Can we secure the crime scene, please?

200
00:10:57,055 --> 00:10:59,723
You know I can't make
a comment on the record.

201
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:03,686
Okay, well, how about off the record?

202
00:11:05,505 --> 00:11:08,120
Just once and that's it,
and only because it's you.

203
00:11:08,123 --> 00:11:09,605
Okay.

204
00:11:11,435 --> 00:11:14,343
While in transport to Iron Heights

205
00:11:14,345 --> 00:11:17,603
the convoy was attacked.

206
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:20,363
Lang was killed by something strong.

207
00:11:20,365 --> 00:11:23,151
- We think maybe a meta.
- Were there any survivors?

208
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:26,733
Four guards, they are
still in the hospital.

209
00:11:26,735 --> 00:11:29,283
- So if you hear anything...
- Yeah, I got you.

210
00:11:29,285 --> 00:11:30,883
Thanks.

211
00:11:33,258 --> 00:11:34,883
Put this away, and, hey.

212
00:11:34,885 --> 00:11:37,203
- Here, put these on.
- Okay.

213
00:11:37,205 --> 00:11:39,533
You do have...

214
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:44,873
The book of Ralph.

215
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:47,233
Yep, and we are gonna
start with a page of Ralph

216
00:11:47,235 --> 00:11:50,037
'cause he's nowhere near
ready for this whole book.

217
00:11:55,675 --> 00:11:57,643
"Ralph Dibny's 27 steps

218
00:11:57,645 --> 00:11:59,401
to getting over the love of your life."

219
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:00,698
Are you kidding me with this?

220
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:02,563
We just want to help you get past Gipsy.

221
00:12:02,565 --> 00:12:04,377
And if this has worked for Ralph...

222
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,603
Multiple times I will add.

223
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:06,940
Then I think it's worth trying.

224
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:08,153
Come on, what's step one?

225
00:12:08,155 --> 00:12:10,253
Shark cage diving.

226
00:12:10,256 --> 00:12:12,659
- What's step two?
- Affirmations.

227
00:12:12,662 --> 00:12:14,753
- Oh.
- Okay.

228
00:12:16,595 --> 00:12:20,623
Ralphy is kind. Ralphy is great.

229
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,662
Ralphy is a brilliant detective.

230
00:12:22,665 --> 00:12:24,412
Yeah, buddy, I mean, I know all that.

231
00:12:24,415 --> 00:12:27,353
But it works a lot better
if you use your name instead.

232
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:30,463
Cisco is creative. Cisco is good.

233
00:12:30,465 --> 00:12:32,987
Cisco is smarter than your average bear.

234
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,263
That's Yogi's. You
stole Yogi's affirmation.

235
00:12:35,265 --> 00:12:36,773
Yeah, I did, 'cause it's a winner.

236
00:12:36,775 --> 00:12:38,909
You don't see him moping
over any lady bears.

237
00:12:38,912 --> 00:12:41,263
Okay, you know what, Caitlin?
I changed my mind, all right?

238
00:12:41,265 --> 00:12:43,263
I... I don't care about the Gipsy vibes.

239
00:12:43,265 --> 00:12:44,623
I'll just muscle through them,

240
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:45,891
let's just help you with your thing

241
00:12:45,893 --> 00:12:47,628
and just get me the
hell out of here, please?

242
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,123
No, Cisco, after Ronnie and Jay

243
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,983
you helped me get back past it.
Now it's my turn to help you.

244
00:12:52,985 --> 00:12:55,943
Okay? So...

245
00:12:55,945 --> 00:12:58,807
We don't have time to
find ourselves in Thailand.

246
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,323
And we are certainly
not watching "Beaches"

247
00:13:01,325 --> 00:13:02,713
while painting each others toes.

248
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,029
That's a really important one, though.

249
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:05,921
But step twelve isn't so bad.

250
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,663
Holy Kafka.

251
00:13:08,665 --> 00:13:10,333
Come on, Cisco, change is good.

252
00:13:10,335 --> 00:13:12,393
No, no, no.

253
00:13:12,395 --> 00:13:13,983
Change is pain.

254
00:13:13,985 --> 00:13:16,655
It's not as painful as
seeing you like this, buddy.

255
00:13:18,655 --> 00:13:20,325
Fine.

256
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:23,695
Whatever you say, doc.

257
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:34,023
Um, Officer Matthews?

258
00:13:34,025 --> 00:13:35,743
Yes.

259
00:13:35,745 --> 00:13:38,003
Hi, I'm Iris West-Allen.

260
00:13:38,005 --> 00:13:41,163
I'm reporter, and I'm doing
a story about William Lang.

261
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:44,373
- Gridlock.
- Pardon?

262
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,203
You call him Gridlock.

263
00:13:46,205 --> 00:13:48,975
In your blog I've read it. It's good.

264
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:53,145
Thanks.

265
00:13:54,525 --> 00:13:57,693
Um, I understand that you
were part of the convoy

266
00:13:57,695 --> 00:14:01,343
that was escorting him to Iron
Heights when you were attacked.

267
00:14:01,345 --> 00:14:04,203
- Something like that.
- What do you mean?

268
00:14:04,205 --> 00:14:07,413
I mean I really don't
remember what happened.

269
00:14:07,415 --> 00:14:10,943
One minute I was in my
vehicle there was a pile up,

270
00:14:10,945 --> 00:14:12,733
I got out to see what's going on.

271
00:14:14,005 --> 00:14:15,795
Everything went black.

272
00:14:17,285 --> 00:14:19,674
Finally came to and Lang's
laying there on the ground,

273
00:14:19,677 --> 00:14:22,053
beaten to a pulp.

274
00:14:22,055 --> 00:14:24,223
He was beaten to death?

275
00:14:24,225 --> 00:14:25,573
Beaten, then stabbed.

276
00:14:25,575 --> 00:14:27,580
- Was anyone else hurt?
- No.

277
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,564
Everyone else on SWAT
was concussed like me.

278
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:31,555
So, Lang was the only target?

279
00:14:33,065 --> 00:14:35,393
Looks like it.

280
00:14:39,885 --> 00:14:41,661
Thanks for your time.

281
00:14:46,905 --> 00:14:49,933
- Oh, hi, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.

282
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:53,103
- I just...
- I got a little too excited.

283
00:14:53,105 --> 00:14:54,753
Okay, guess what?

284
00:14:54,755 --> 00:14:57,663
You know my powers have
been fading in and out.

285
00:14:57,665 --> 00:14:59,163
Mostly out.

286
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:02,653
Well, I am definitely losing them.

287
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,002
You weren't that excited
about that this morning.

288
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,388
- No.
- No, I was not.

289
00:15:06,391 --> 00:15:09,619
But I'm excited now
because I have a fix.

290
00:15:09,622 --> 00:15:10,743
I have a fix!

291
00:15:10,745 --> 00:15:13,123
Mental activity dampener 2.0.

292
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,640
2.0.

293
00:15:14,643 --> 00:15:16,773
Harry altered it so that
you can hear the thoughts

294
00:15:16,775 --> 00:15:18,103
of whoever is wearing it.

295
00:15:18,105 --> 00:15:20,003
And why would we wanna do that?

296
00:15:20,005 --> 00:15:22,273
So we can make sure it works
before we put it on Jenna.

297
00:15:22,275 --> 00:15:23,679
Uh-uh.

298
00:15:23,682 --> 00:15:25,523
Oh, honey, it's completely safe,

299
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:26,973
Harry used it on his own daughter,

300
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,413
It doesn't mean we
have to use it on ours.

301
00:15:29,415 --> 00:15:33,313
Oh, ok... okay. Honey, listen.

302
00:15:33,315 --> 00:15:36,533
I have had a constant

303
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,273
telepathic connection to our child

304
00:15:39,275 --> 00:15:41,283
since before she was born.

305
00:15:41,285 --> 00:15:44,215
It's been constant.

306
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:47,551
Babe, now when she cries half
the time I don't know why.

307
00:15:47,554 --> 00:15:49,783
Look, she's an infant.

308
00:15:49,785 --> 00:15:52,012
They cry and you always get to know why.

309
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:53,926
No, not... me.

310
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:55,895
You don't understand.

311
00:15:57,771 --> 00:16:01,861
I haven't been the mother
to a newborn in a long time.

312
00:16:03,232 --> 00:16:07,122
When I got pregnant,
baby, I was so scared.

313
00:16:08,645 --> 00:16:11,183
But then I got powers.

314
00:16:11,185 --> 00:16:13,733
These powers that...

315
00:16:13,735 --> 00:16:18,129
gave me a chance to be a perfect parent.

316
00:16:18,132 --> 00:16:21,483
The parent that our child deserves.

317
00:16:21,485 --> 00:16:24,323
And now they're going away?

318
00:16:26,995 --> 00:16:29,452
I'm scared I can't live up to that.

319
00:16:32,185 --> 00:16:35,013
I know you're struggling, babe.

320
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:37,013
But that device...

321
00:16:37,015 --> 00:16:40,054
isn't the solution.

322
00:16:40,057 --> 00:16:42,843
We'll figure out, okay?

323
00:16:42,845 --> 00:16:46,173
But...

324
00:16:46,175 --> 00:16:48,275
I got it.

325
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:02,862
Ugh, these old-timey computers

326
00:17:02,865 --> 00:17:06,193
are even slower than the ones
in storage at the Flash Museum.

327
00:17:06,195 --> 00:17:08,903
DNA analysis used to take a lot longer

328
00:17:08,905 --> 00:17:12,003
even just ten years ago.

329
00:17:12,005 --> 00:17:15,527
So, Mom took the news
about you being gone

330
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,293
better than I thought she would.

331
00:17:17,295 --> 00:17:18,963
Iris is as though as they come.

332
00:17:18,965 --> 00:17:21,303
I'm sure you know that.

333
00:17:21,305 --> 00:17:24,423
Got a match. Vanessa Jansen.

334
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:26,053
Low level weapon dealer

335
00:17:26,055 --> 00:17:28,573
affiliated with the
East Street Skulls gang.

336
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:31,723
I ran into a couple of
them when I was in prison.

337
00:17:31,725 --> 00:17:33,553
- You were in prison?
- Mm-hmm.

338
00:17:33,555 --> 00:17:34,856
That wasn't in the museum.

339
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:36,353
The Skulls make the Hell's Angels

340
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,168
look like a knitting
club, drug trafficking,

341
00:17:38,171 --> 00:17:39,233
armed robbery.

342
00:17:39,235 --> 00:17:41,563
Any places Jansen's known to frequent?

343
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:44,443
East Street Auto Haven.

344
00:17:44,445 --> 00:17:47,283
Looks like it's probably a
front for Skull's activities.

345
00:17:47,285 --> 00:17:50,663
Yes, time to take down my first baddie!

346
00:17:50,665 --> 00:17:53,152
Uh, with your permission, of course.

347
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,623
Let's do it.

348
00:18:00,755 --> 00:18:04,603
What is the hold up? These
you are gonna move fast.

349
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:07,813
Well, I guess, I heard right.

350
00:18:07,815 --> 00:18:10,473
You got something you're selling.

351
00:18:10,475 --> 00:18:14,453
Too late, another interested
customer just showed up.

352
00:18:14,455 --> 00:18:16,763
You're looking to buy, Bruno?

353
00:18:16,765 --> 00:18:20,643
From the broad who killed my
brother and stole our stash?

354
00:18:20,645 --> 00:18:23,903
This is way out of your league, Vanessa.

355
00:18:23,905 --> 00:18:25,773
See, I would've agree with you...

356
00:18:25,775 --> 00:18:27,693
before prison.

357
00:18:27,695 --> 00:18:30,153
But then I got out and it hit me...

358
00:18:30,155 --> 00:18:32,283
I'm tougher now, Bruno.

359
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:33,633
I got connections with people

360
00:18:33,635 --> 00:18:35,373
that would pay big money for my weapons.

361
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:37,515
Except, they're not your weapons.

362
00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:44,883
Like I said...

363
00:18:47,485 --> 00:18:49,565
I'm tougher now.

364
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:53,183
All right, I'm gonna take
Vanessa and the gangster.

365
00:18:53,185 --> 00:18:54,563
Why don't you just scan the perimeter

366
00:18:54,565 --> 00:18:56,233
for any back up she might have.

367
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,663
- I can do better than that.
- What?

368
00:18:58,665 --> 00:19:00,433
Whoa, what're you...

369
00:19:00,435 --> 00:19:02,063
Crap.

370
00:19:06,315 --> 00:19:08,583
Sorry, I can't let you hurt him.

371
00:19:08,585 --> 00:19:11,533
Or take this.

372
00:19:11,535 --> 00:19:13,153
Didn't know I was a meta.

373
00:19:13,155 --> 00:19:14,863
Don't feel bad, it's my new look.

374
00:19:14,865 --> 00:19:17,663
- Vanessa!
- The Flash!

375
00:19:17,665 --> 00:19:19,583
I guess I better put my hands up.

376
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:40,655
How long do you think it will...

377
00:19:50,572 --> 00:19:52,180
I think Nora is good to go.

378
00:19:52,183 --> 00:19:54,033
She didn't even need an Ibuprofen.

379
00:19:54,035 --> 00:19:56,398
- You sure you feel okay?
- I'm totally okay.

380
00:19:56,401 --> 00:19:58,062
Come on, let's get back to work, Flash.

381
00:19:58,065 --> 00:19:59,703
Okay.

382
00:19:59,705 --> 00:20:01,968
All right, well let's figure
out where Vanessa went.

383
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:05,463
If she sells those stolen
weapons to the wrong people I...

384
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:08,281
Um, Cisco, were you
able to get the satellite

385
00:20:08,284 --> 00:20:10,593
up and running? Cisco?

386
00:20:12,555 --> 00:20:14,883
We weren't able to track Vanessa,

387
00:20:14,885 --> 00:20:16,723
but we did find a scientific anomaly

388
00:20:16,725 --> 00:20:18,653
that we've never seen
before, right, Cisco?

389
00:20:24,115 --> 00:20:27,800
- Han shot second.
- That doesn't even make sense.

390
00:20:27,803 --> 00:20:30,221
Ralph, it's you.

391
00:20:30,224 --> 00:20:31,898
Sorry to lie like that, man.

392
00:20:31,901 --> 00:20:36,363
- We just... we need the CCTV...
- CCTV, yes.

393
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:40,335
Vanessa Jansen's concentrated
air squares are dense

394
00:20:40,338 --> 00:20:43,393
very dense, stupid dense.

395
00:20:43,395 --> 00:20:45,703
The kind of dense reserved for

396
00:20:45,705 --> 00:20:47,893
people who still believe...

397
00:20:47,895 --> 00:20:49,233
In love.

398
00:20:49,235 --> 00:20:52,021
I think what Cisco is trying to say

399
00:20:52,024 --> 00:20:54,392
is that Vanessa can manipulate
the movement of atoms

400
00:20:54,395 --> 00:20:57,433
to created concentrated
air molecules in cube form.

401
00:20:57,435 --> 00:20:59,753
The space between the
molecules is so compact that...

402
00:20:59,755 --> 00:21:01,753
That there isn't enough
room for a speedster

403
00:21:01,755 --> 00:21:03,198
to vibrate trough them.

404
00:21:03,201 --> 00:21:05,732
What do you call someone who
can compress air molecules

405
00:21:05,735 --> 00:21:08,593
- into solid blocks?
- I don't know, Block.

406
00:21:11,425 --> 00:21:13,252
So, I guess Cisco is still

407
00:21:13,255 --> 00:21:14,843
taking the Gipsy thing pretty hard?

408
00:21:14,846 --> 00:21:16,643
Well, we're working on it.

409
00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:18,293
But you can't expect real progress

410
00:21:18,295 --> 00:21:20,583
till you hit step 17.

411
00:21:20,585 --> 00:21:23,007
It's this thing we're
working on with Cisco.

412
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,133
You can do without us
for a little while, right?

413
00:21:25,135 --> 00:21:26,803
I mean, we are blind
without our satellite

414
00:21:26,805 --> 00:21:27,950
so we're just gonna have to wait

415
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:29,763
until Vanessa makes
her next move anyway.

416
00:21:32,955 --> 00:21:35,376
What about you? Gonna
hang out here for a bit?

417
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:38,033
Actually, I am working on a lead.

418
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:40,783
- Huh.
- Can I use your lab?

419
00:21:40,785 --> 00:21:42,653
There's something I wanna follow up on.

420
00:21:42,655 --> 00:21:44,503
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay.

421
00:21:48,155 --> 00:21:49,783
Okay.

422
00:21:49,785 --> 00:21:51,524
Uh, what kind of training is this?

423
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:55,333
Well, speedsters need
to know about physics,

424
00:21:55,335 --> 00:21:57,973
aerodynamics, trajectory formulas.

425
00:21:57,975 --> 00:22:00,833
And after your last
encounter with Jansen,

426
00:22:00,835 --> 00:22:03,753
I think is time for you
to get back to basics.

427
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:06,173
- My training is math?
- Yeah.

428
00:22:06,175 --> 00:22:09,485
I think chapter one is
probably a good place to start.

429
00:22:12,895 --> 00:22:14,723
Al right, you're in for a real treat.

430
00:22:14,725 --> 00:22:16,643
He initially said no,
but after I told him

431
00:22:16,645 --> 00:22:18,143
that your cousin was John Stamos.

432
00:22:18,145 --> 00:22:19,813
My cousin is not John Stamos.

433
00:22:19,815 --> 00:22:21,483
He agreed to you on.

434
00:22:21,485 --> 00:22:25,523
I proudly present my
personal stylist, Bruce.

435
00:22:29,485 --> 00:22:31,583
This guy does it all, hair, makeup.

436
00:22:31,585 --> 00:22:33,083
He picks everything I wear.

437
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,873
- That explains that.
- Come on.

438
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:37,683
Bruce is gonna help us
accomplish step twelve.

439
00:22:37,685 --> 00:22:40,121
Metamorphosis.

440
00:22:40,124 --> 00:22:42,380
Does that mean you think
there's something wrong

441
00:22:42,383 --> 00:22:45,051
with me?

442
00:22:45,054 --> 00:22:48,193
Even a Ferrari needs a
tune-up every once in a while.

443
00:22:52,865 --> 00:22:54,433
This feels like purgatory.

444
00:22:59,685 --> 00:23:03,165
You cut my hair, I cut you.

445
00:23:14,555 --> 00:23:16,527
My work here is done.

446
00:23:21,585 --> 00:23:23,543
So...

447
00:23:23,545 --> 00:23:25,753
I hate it.

448
00:23:25,755 --> 00:23:27,543
I hate it all.

449
00:23:27,545 --> 00:23:30,063
Great, now that that's
over and done with.

450
00:23:30,065 --> 00:23:32,814
Why don't we focus on
the death certificate?

451
00:23:32,817 --> 00:23:34,572
Well, I mean, we need to vibe it.

452
00:23:34,575 --> 00:23:37,776
Or we can ask Joe to do some
good old fashion police work.

453
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:39,087
Did you ever think of that?

454
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,693
Let's not worry about it, okay?

455
00:23:40,695 --> 00:23:42,129
No, I mean, it's a good idea.

456
00:23:42,132 --> 00:23:43,581
- We'll just ah...
- Let's give him a call.

457
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:46,331
Guys, stop. Seriously, cut it out!

458
00:23:46,334 --> 00:23:47,960
Okay?

459
00:23:47,963 --> 00:23:49,661
Forget about the death certificate

460
00:23:49,664 --> 00:23:52,282
and let's just focus on
helping our friend, okay?

461
00:23:57,245 --> 00:23:58,763
I need a break.

462
00:24:05,585 --> 00:24:08,313
Okay, so the key with Higgs
particles isn't the math per se

463
00:24:08,315 --> 00:24:11,093
but the effect they have on
the mass of other particles.

464
00:24:11,095 --> 00:24:13,133
- Yeah.
- Question.

465
00:24:13,135 --> 00:24:16,283
How would one go about
performing a supersonic punch

466
00:24:16,285 --> 00:24:18,513
on one of those particles?

467
00:24:18,515 --> 00:24:20,653
- Nora.
- Dad, I'm sorry,

468
00:24:20,655 --> 00:24:22,546
but I already know all of this.

469
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:24,953
My high school textbooks
had laws of physics

470
00:24:24,955 --> 00:24:27,643
that this time hasn't even discover yet.

471
00:24:27,645 --> 00:24:29,963
I don't need this kind of training

472
00:24:29,965 --> 00:24:33,463
I need to learn how to be like you.

473
00:24:33,465 --> 00:24:36,283
What do you think it
means to be like me?

474
00:24:36,285 --> 00:24:40,163
You know, running so fast
you can stop a tsunami.

475
00:24:40,165 --> 00:24:42,473
Or vibrating something
bigger than a plane.

476
00:24:42,475 --> 00:24:44,473
Or how about defeating a sand demon

477
00:24:44,475 --> 00:24:46,483
by throwing lighting at him.

478
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:47,916
Nora, look, all those things

479
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,813
are way behind your current skill level.

480
00:24:49,815 --> 00:24:53,293
You gotta stick to what
you can handle right now.

481
00:24:53,295 --> 00:24:54,983
Uh, just because I'm your daughter

482
00:24:54,985 --> 00:24:57,483
doesn't mean you have to baby me.

483
00:24:57,485 --> 00:25:01,143
I can handle way more than you think.

484
00:25:01,145 --> 00:25:03,013
Watch.

485
00:25:19,005 --> 00:25:21,843
Dad!

486
00:25:21,845 --> 00:25:23,833
- Dad, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

487
00:25:23,835 --> 00:25:25,493
I've been hit with lighting before.

488
00:25:25,495 --> 00:25:27,753
Ow.

489
00:25:27,755 --> 00:25:30,763
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

490
00:25:30,765 --> 00:25:33,713
I guess greatness isn't hereditary.

491
00:25:50,165 --> 00:25:52,773
Body cam footage.

492
00:25:52,775 --> 00:25:55,233
Officer Matthews.

493
00:25:55,235 --> 00:25:56,715
Bingo!

494
00:25:58,795 --> 00:26:00,288
What the hell was that?

495
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:02,073
Stay where you are. Freeze don't move.

496
00:26:03,965 --> 00:26:06,583
What was that?

497
00:26:18,635 --> 00:26:21,573
Hey, I need your help.

498
00:26:21,575 --> 00:26:24,132
- That's blunt.
- Yeah, so Nora,

499
00:26:24,135 --> 00:26:25,763
isn't really spending
any time with Iris.

500
00:26:25,766 --> 00:26:27,578
So she's kind of with me
all the time, you know?

501
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,522
And I've been training
her a lot by myself

502
00:26:29,525 --> 00:26:31,928
and I just don't get it.

503
00:26:31,931 --> 00:26:33,116
I mean, it's like...

504
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:35,433
She keeps taking things on
that she can't handle yet.

505
00:26:35,436 --> 00:26:37,342
It's like she wants
to go big for big sake

506
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:40,366
and I try to walk her back, but
it's like she's not listening

507
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:41,578
to what I'm teaching her, you know?

508
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,033
It's actually that
she hears the opposite

509
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:45,383
of what I'm saying. Why are you nodding?

510
00:26:45,386 --> 00:26:46,905
Are you agreeing with me?

511
00:26:46,908 --> 00:26:50,848
Do you remember your
4th grade science fair?

512
00:26:52,765 --> 00:26:55,403
Yeah, but what does that
have to do with this?

513
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,813
All you had to do is make
a baking soda volcano.

514
00:26:57,815 --> 00:26:59,403
- And what did you do?
- I...

515
00:26:59,405 --> 00:27:02,743
You built a robot with wheels,

516
00:27:02,745 --> 00:27:04,943
pretty much set the gym on fire.

517
00:27:04,945 --> 00:27:06,991
Almost got Mrs. Dumas too.

518
00:27:06,994 --> 00:27:09,583
- But that was different.
- How so?

519
00:27:09,585 --> 00:27:12,903
That was the first year you took me in.

520
00:27:12,905 --> 00:27:15,283
I mean, you took me when I had no one.

521
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:17,277
I looked up to you. I
mean, you were my hero.

522
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,833
I...

523
00:27:23,105 --> 00:27:25,173
I really wanted to impress you.

524
00:27:25,175 --> 00:27:28,253
Bar, all the information

525
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:31,683
this girl has on you
comes from that museum.

526
00:27:31,685 --> 00:27:34,803
There're literally statues

527
00:27:34,805 --> 00:27:37,523
of you on pedestals.

528
00:27:37,525 --> 00:27:40,453
How do you think she
wants to impress her hero?

529
00:27:42,525 --> 00:27:44,813
So what do I do?

530
00:27:44,815 --> 00:27:47,623
Well, show her it's
okay not to be perfect

531
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:48,882
coming out of the gate.

532
00:27:48,885 --> 00:27:51,143
There's no shortcuts.

533
00:27:51,146 --> 00:27:54,293
Takes time to get things
right and that's not a failure.

534
00:27:54,295 --> 00:27:56,543
That's life.

535
00:27:56,545 --> 00:28:01,383
And also show her that no matter what

536
00:28:01,385 --> 00:28:05,053
you're always gonna love her.

537
00:28:05,055 --> 00:28:08,293
That's what parents do.

538
00:28:08,295 --> 00:28:09,963
Yeah.

539
00:28:09,965 --> 00:28:12,393
- Yeah, thanks, Joe.
- Mm.

540
00:28:12,395 --> 00:28:14,963
See you later.

541
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:24,662
Mm. Mm.

542
00:28:24,665 --> 00:28:26,573
Mm.

543
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:28,953
What was that for?

544
00:28:28,955 --> 00:28:31,293
Just 'cause.

545
00:28:31,295 --> 00:28:33,335
Uh-uh. I got her.

546
00:28:35,155 --> 00:28:36,703
Yeah, you do.

547
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:53,343
Ah, yes, the sugary pastry.

548
00:28:53,345 --> 00:28:55,883
I think as far as avoiding
your feelings goes,

549
00:28:55,885 --> 00:28:59,273
cinnamon bun was a solid choice.

550
00:28:59,275 --> 00:29:01,533
You look nice.

551
00:29:01,535 --> 00:29:05,203
Yeah, well, I think Bruce
burned all my clothes, so...

552
00:29:05,205 --> 00:29:07,075
Hmm.

553
00:29:10,045 --> 00:29:11,453
Why don't you want to investigate

554
00:29:11,455 --> 00:29:13,915
your dad's death certificate?

555
00:29:18,055 --> 00:29:20,623
Because...

556
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,723
if it's true...

557
00:29:23,725 --> 00:29:27,185
if he has been alive this whole time...

558
00:29:28,544 --> 00:29:30,582
I just means he didn't want to see me.

559
00:29:43,985 --> 00:29:46,243
Step 27:

560
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:48,653
Accept that she isn't
the love of your life

561
00:29:48,655 --> 00:29:52,233
because if she were,
she'd still be in it.

562
00:29:55,243 --> 00:29:58,263
- Pretty deep for Ralph Dibny.
- Yeah.

563
00:30:00,095 --> 00:30:03,035
Granted it took him 26 swings
before he could hit the ball.

564
00:30:04,505 --> 00:30:07,503
I don't know...

565
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:10,585
I think he might of knocked
out of the park with that one.

566
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,605
Gipsy isn't the one.

567
00:30:15,845 --> 00:30:18,763
I know that.

568
00:30:18,765 --> 00:30:22,093
And there's no amount
of new clothes or...

569
00:30:22,096 --> 00:30:25,406
crazy makeover distraction
that can change that fact.

570
00:30:26,935 --> 00:30:30,491
Because some truths you
can only hide for so long.

571
00:30:33,295 --> 00:30:37,085
The truth is, it's too late for
me to change things with her.

572
00:30:40,825 --> 00:30:43,045
But it's not too late for you.

573
00:30:44,455 --> 00:30:47,413
It's not too late for you to
change things with your dad.

574
00:30:51,715 --> 00:30:55,383
But what if he doesn't
want anything to do with me.

575
00:31:01,135 --> 00:31:03,115
Maybe he doesn't.

576
00:31:05,105 --> 00:31:08,473
But wouldn't you rather face that truth

577
00:31:08,475 --> 00:31:11,453
instead of spending the
rest of your life wondering?

578
00:31:20,485 --> 00:31:23,045
- Is this part of my training?
- Just watch.

579
00:31:24,544 --> 00:31:27,782
- Schway, is that you?
- Yeah.

580
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:29,533
A few weeks after I got my powers.

581
00:31:29,535 --> 00:31:32,703
OG Flash. God, look at you move.

582
00:31:32,705 --> 00:31:34,633
Yeah, just wait for it.

583
00:31:36,265 --> 00:31:38,723
And this.

584
00:31:38,725 --> 00:31:40,093
And this.

585
00:31:40,095 --> 00:31:41,683
- Yeah.
- Oh!

586
00:31:41,685 --> 00:31:44,603
It takes time to hone your skills, Nora.

587
00:31:44,605 --> 00:31:46,553
You can't just can't just
skip rungs on a ladder

588
00:31:46,555 --> 00:31:49,153
or jump right to the big
stuff. It's not how it works.

589
00:31:50,815 --> 00:31:52,613
All right, that's enough of that.

590
00:31:52,615 --> 00:31:54,733
Look, when you first got here

591
00:31:54,735 --> 00:31:58,313
you said that you
weren't a great speedster.

592
00:31:58,315 --> 00:32:01,863
But obviously neither was
I when I first started.

593
00:32:01,865 --> 00:32:05,793
Um, do you think one day
I will be great like you?

594
00:32:07,705 --> 00:32:09,703
You punched out a satellite

595
00:32:09,705 --> 00:32:12,553
while I was falling to
the earth and on fire.

596
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,543
And you were moving so fast

597
00:32:14,545 --> 00:32:17,123
even I couldn't see who you were.

598
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:19,725
- Yeah, that was pretty epic.
- Yeah.

599
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:24,713
I'm sorry I didn't listen to you today.

600
00:32:24,715 --> 00:32:26,983
I just wanted to make you proud.

601
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:31,254
Sometimes for people with our abilities

602
00:32:31,257 --> 00:32:35,412
the most impressive feat is restraint.

603
00:32:42,275 --> 00:32:44,720
I want what's mine, Vanessa.

604
00:32:44,723 --> 00:32:45,943
Now step aside.

605
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:51,326
Because you brought a
bigger gun this time?

606
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:52,673
Not happening.

607
00:32:54,675 --> 00:32:56,433
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

608
00:32:58,415 --> 00:32:59,843
I'm sure.

609
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:18,126
Hey, guys. Any luck with Block?

610
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,122
Nothing. No. Anything at the lab?

611
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:23,323
Uh, maybe. It's still a
little too early to tell.

612
00:33:23,325 --> 00:33:25,443
Unit 7-5-2 requesting a 10-61.

613
00:33:25,445 --> 00:33:26,642
- What is that?
- Nothing.

614
00:33:26,645 --> 00:33:29,032
An officer requesting
to go on a coffee break.

615
00:33:29,035 --> 00:33:30,783
Not having our satellites is killing us.

616
00:33:30,785 --> 00:33:32,790
I mean, we can't scan
the city for dark matter

617
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:34,461
we don't have facial recognition.

618
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,897
All we'd need to do is
see if there any pockets

619
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,813
of compressed air around
the city and we'd have her.

620
00:33:38,815 --> 00:33:41,833
You mean gauging atmospheric
pressure like a barometer?

621
00:33:41,835 --> 00:33:43,633
Yeah, but it would have
to be a big barometer.

622
00:33:43,635 --> 00:33:47,393
You mean like channel
52 Doppler radar relay?

623
00:33:47,395 --> 00:33:50,282
Yeah, I mean, Vanessa's
blocks are constructed

624
00:33:50,285 --> 00:33:52,653
of highly dense air, so they'd
have the same composition

625
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,353
as an extreme atmospheric system.

626
00:33:54,355 --> 00:33:57,223
So, we track the
weather and we find her.

627
00:33:57,225 --> 00:33:59,073
- That's so schway.
- Okay, yeah.

628
00:33:59,075 --> 00:34:01,503
Let's do it, yeah.

629
00:34:03,895 --> 00:34:05,982
- Go Team West-Allen.
- Yeah!

630
00:34:05,985 --> 00:34:09,032
Okay, look, there's a
high-density low-pressure zone

631
00:34:09,035 --> 00:34:11,646
in a six block radius
around Pacific and Davies.

632
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:13,247
Okay, cool. All right, let's go.

633
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,528
Hey, maybe I should just stay here.

634
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:17,872
Or you could put some
of that training to use.

635
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:21,763
Last chance, Vanessa.

636
00:34:23,574 --> 00:34:25,322
To do what?

637
00:34:25,325 --> 00:34:26,689
Just give me the keys

638
00:34:26,692 --> 00:34:28,463
so I can drive my weapons out of here.

639
00:34:28,465 --> 00:34:29,610
Come on.

640
00:34:29,613 --> 00:34:31,033
Just hand them over nice and easy.

641
00:34:33,185 --> 00:34:35,203
Yeah, right.

642
00:34:35,205 --> 00:34:36,903
Light her up!

643
00:34:49,445 --> 00:34:51,425
You two. I swear...

644
00:34:58,085 --> 00:34:59,805
She's getting tired.

645
00:35:03,975 --> 00:35:05,643
We got her.

646
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,093
Yeah, we did.

647
00:35:12,348 --> 00:35:14,803
- Gotcha.
- Uh-oh.

648
00:35:14,805 --> 00:35:17,653
- Uh-oh.
- Flash is trapped!

649
00:35:17,655 --> 00:35:18,913
What's wrong? What's happening?

650
00:35:18,915 --> 00:35:20,913
Barry's in trouble.

651
00:35:29,945 --> 00:35:31,403
She gets tired.

652
00:35:31,405 --> 00:35:34,573
Hey, blockhead! Try that on me!

653
00:36:00,995 --> 00:36:04,313
Bit off more than you could chew, huh?

654
00:36:15,456 --> 00:36:18,814
Well, my work here is done.

655
00:36:18,825 --> 00:36:21,043
Looks like she's a regular
chip off the ol' block.

656
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:22,143
- Am I...
- Don't.

657
00:36:22,145 --> 00:36:23,305
Okay, yeah, I know.

658
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:28,043
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

659
00:36:41,235 --> 00:36:42,493
Get her to a hospital.

660
00:36:42,495 --> 00:36:45,743
XS! Now!

661
00:36:50,365 --> 00:36:51,843
Barry? What is it?

662
00:36:51,845 --> 00:36:53,385
- Who's there?
- I don't know yet.

663
00:37:03,885 --> 00:37:06,503
I just lost my speed.

664
00:37:06,505 --> 00:37:08,583
- I got nothing.
- Negative, Ghost Rider.

665
00:37:08,585 --> 00:37:10,883
Guys, I know we're
three against one, but

666
00:37:10,885 --> 00:37:13,383
something tells me this
guy's got the advantage.

667
00:37:38,607 --> 00:37:39,727
Barry!

668
00:38:05,735 --> 00:38:09,153
What is that sound?

669
00:38:09,156 --> 00:38:10,354
Oh, my God.

670
00:38:10,357 --> 00:38:11,442
Barry!

671
00:38:11,445 --> 00:38:13,233
Barry, you got get out
of there right now!

672
00:38:17,509 --> 00:38:18,763
Dad!

673
00:38:32,345 --> 00:38:35,093
Dad.

674
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:37,763
- Dad, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

675
00:38:53,825 --> 00:38:55,453
I mean, this is definitely dark matter,

676
00:38:55,456 --> 00:38:57,934
but these levels of
concentration are unlike

677
00:38:57,937 --> 00:39:00,392
like any dark matter levels
I've ever seen before.

678
00:39:00,395 --> 00:39:02,493
Yeah, well, that wasn't
quite like any ass kicking

679
00:39:02,496 --> 00:39:04,754
I've ever gotten before either.

680
00:39:04,757 --> 00:39:06,143
That dagger he had,

681
00:39:06,145 --> 00:39:08,513
I think that negated our powers.

682
00:39:08,515 --> 00:39:12,023
And he control it too, like Mjolnir.

683
00:39:12,025 --> 00:39:13,463
That's Thor's hammer.

684
00:39:13,465 --> 00:39:15,153
I'm just glad you guys are okay.

685
00:39:15,155 --> 00:39:16,463
This could've been a lot worst.

686
00:39:16,465 --> 00:39:17,863
Yeah.

687
00:39:17,865 --> 00:39:19,653
Careful. Those cuts are pretty deep.

688
00:39:19,655 --> 00:39:22,063
It could take a while for them to heal.

689
00:39:24,176 --> 00:39:27,972
Cisco, that's not important right now.

690
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:40,175
Look, if you wanna know,
this is your chance.

691
00:39:42,223 --> 00:39:44,196
I support you either way, Caitlin.

692
00:40:12,065 --> 00:40:14,743
I'm sorry. I don't know what happened.

693
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,048
Caitlin, did you see something?

694
00:40:19,051 --> 00:40:21,032
Yeah, I did.

695
00:40:24,595 --> 00:40:26,553
My mother.

696
00:40:26,555 --> 00:40:29,583
Hey, guys.

697
00:40:29,585 --> 00:40:31,413
Let's go.

698
00:40:39,734 --> 00:40:41,664
Hey, we got a big problem.

699
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:44,115
So I talked to Captain Singh
and he said that Gridlock

700
00:40:44,118 --> 00:40:46,483
was killed during his
transport to Iron Heights.

701
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:49,153
- Gridlock's dead?
- How?

702
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,258
I'm not sure.

703
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:51,822
I interviewed everyone that was there

704
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:52,933
and no one knows.

705
00:40:52,935 --> 00:40:54,393
But I did some digging...

706
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:56,820
What the hell is that?

707
00:40:56,823 --> 00:40:58,732
Stay where you are! Freeze! Don't move!

708
00:41:02,535 --> 00:41:04,423
Okay, so what are we looking for here?

709
00:41:04,425 --> 00:41:07,283
Not looking. Listening.

710
00:41:11,005 --> 00:41:12,843
It sounds like the guy
who just attacked us.

711
00:41:14,965 --> 00:41:17,183
Sounds like an insect.

712
00:41:17,185 --> 00:41:18,463
Yeah, it does.

713
00:41:18,465 --> 00:41:20,293
- Like a...
- Like a cicada.

714
00:41:25,472 --> 00:41:27,125
Who's Cicada?

715
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,200
