ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE IN KOREA

2
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:15,890
Hello, everyone!

3
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:19,144
{\an8}I'm Orangibberish, and I always get
to the truth behind the rumors.

4
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:22,647
Okay, today, I'll be uncovering the truth
behind the Hyosan zombies rumor.

5
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,941
I'm on my way to see
if it's really turned into Zombieland

6
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,235
like they've been saying online
and on social media.

7
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:28,653
You know what I'm talking about.

8
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,071
FINALLY
HE'S REALLY GOING

9
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,240
Whoa. It's already pretty crazy.

10
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,324
Look out there.

11
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,833
Do you see that?

12
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:45,295
It's bumper to bumper
with cars trying to get into Hyosan.

13
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,671
There are so many cars.

14
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:47,797
Hold on.

15
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,008
I'm gonna have to get out
and hike my way in.

16
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:53,511
I came up the mountain
to avoid the traffic jam.

17
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,138
See that there?

18
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,932
{\an8}That is Hyosan all the way
down there in the distance.

19
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,018
Okay. I'll…

20
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,520
…show you the gear…

21
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,147
…that I've brought for this mission.

22
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,608
First. A helmet.

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,444
A hockey mask. A pair of knee pads.

24
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,488
Shin guards. Very important.

25
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,823
This is emergency food.

26
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,034
First aid kit. And water.

27
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,328
And the most important of all, an axe.

28
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,830
If something grabs me,
slice them up like roast beef.

29
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,873
Like that.

30
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:24,834
Please hit like and subscribe, okay?

31
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,961
MY MOM TOLD ME TO STAY HOME
LOOK AT YOU ALL GEARED UP

32
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,004
Hold on.

33
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,464
RUN! RUN FASTER!

34
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,591
Shit!

35
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,094
I'm so screwed! Damn these crazy assholes!

36
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,470
THIS IS SCRIPTED, ISN'T IT?

37
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,556
IT SHOULD BE OVER SOON
THIS FOOTAGE WILL HELP US

38
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,310
LOOK AT THAT ACTING
THIS IS FUN

39
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,229
Are they gone?

40
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,688
TAKE OUT YOUR AXE!

41
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,858
Shit. They're so aggressive.

42
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,819
SHOW US THE STREET
COME BACK

43
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,118
I DON'T THINK I CAN SLEEP TONIGHT
GOODBYE

44
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:01,579
Did you see that shit?
Yes, I'm talking to you, assholes!

45
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,001
IT'S SCARY
WHERE ARE THE REAL ZOMBIES?

46
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,007
YOU SHOULD'VE TAKEN A GUN
ZOMBIE!

47
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,401
Are you okay?

48
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,071
Your hand.

49
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,162
You're not okay.

50
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,589
Gyeong-su?

51
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,257
Gyeong-su. It's you, isn't it?

52
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,970
It's me. Cheong-san's mom.

53
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,097
Gyeong-su. Where's Cheong-san?

54
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,601
I'm sorry to say this…

55
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:51,981
but you have to be strong.

56
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:53,816
Don't comfort me.

57
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,237
You can't do things like that.

58
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,365
Yes, I can.

59
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,703
Still, don't do it.

60
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,709
I didn't know…

61
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,173
I-sak was such a precious friend.

62
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,136
When I though she was gone…

63
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,390
it felt like I'd lost the whole world.

64
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,146
Gyeong-su…

65
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,151
must be out there somewhere.

66
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:38,695
Mm-hm.

67
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,868
Oh! Gyeong-su!

68
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,163
Gyeong-su. I'm Cheong-san's mom.

69
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,174
Gyeong-su. Aah!

70
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,973
Cheong-san…

71
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,996
I wonder if things are okay outside.

72
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,916
Your dad's a firefighter,
so I'm sure he's fine.

73
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,795
And I'm guessing my mom and dad
are at the restaurant.

74
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,883
That's the most important thing to my mom.

75
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,845
She's probably out there selling chickens
to the zombies right now.

76
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,975
I really wish I could have
some of her chicken.

77
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,146
-You said it was salty.
-But it still tasted good.

78
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,443
Let's eat it…

79
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,655
once it's all over and we get out of here.

80
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,077
I didn't hear anything at all.

81
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,498
I just couldn't hear anything.

82
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,626
-Like what?
-I mean, after Na-yeon went out…

83
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,091
…and then Miss Park went after her.

84
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,511
Miss Park! Miss Park!

85
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,222
I didn't hear anything after that.

86
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,266
You mean, screaming?

87
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,643
Yeah.

88
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,814
Maybe they didn't die, then.

89
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,943
They wouldn't have been quiet
if zombies were biting them.

90
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,571
They must be alive.

91
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,830
Why won't you respond?

92
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:39,709
No one answers me.
I'm always talking to myself.

93
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,086
-I think you're right.
-Forget it.

94
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,464
I didn't hear anything, either.

95
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,756
Me neither.

96
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:50,970
I was scared because I didn't know
how I'd feel if I heard them screaming,

97
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,847
but I didn't hear anything.

98
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,808
Come to think of it, neither did I.

99
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,312
Then I'm right. They're alive, right?

100
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,440
Should she be alive?

101
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:04,984
What do you mean?

102
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,572
She's a murderer.

103
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:13,075
She killed Gyeong-su
and walked out of here on her own.

104
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,621
Is it even right for her to be alive?
Aren't you all being fake?

105
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:17,788
What about Miss Park?

106
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,416
Should she have died too?

107
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,751
Is that our fault?

108
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,545
Either way, we're responsible
for what happened.

109
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,463
Why is that?

110
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:27,924
What did we do wrong?

111
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,093
Na-yeon killed someone,
then played the victim,

112
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,595
and chose to leave on her own…

113
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,849
because we didn't listen to her.

114
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,269
If no one's on your side,
is it okay to kill?

115
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,315
Miss Park acted
like we were wrong.

116
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,653
We didn't tell Na-yeon to go out there.

117
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,115
We didn't tell Miss Park
to go out there, either.

118
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,119
Why should we feel bad?

119
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,501
What the hell did we do wrong?

120
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:24,689
Hey.

121
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,234
I feel weird saying this, but--

122
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,236
Don't say it.

123
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,659
Does anyone else have to go
to the bathroom by any chance?

124
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,794
Am I the only one?

125
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,172
I do.

126
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,551
We have to go, too, actually.

127
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,177
But we can't go out.

128
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,070
See?

129
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,240
I told you no one would come.

130
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,953
No one cares about this school.

131
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,789
If they did,
they would've saved us by now.

132
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,751
So we wouldn't have been
attacked like that.

133
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,903
Now, I really wish the school
would burn down.

134
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,865
Till nothing's left.

135
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,867
They'll save us.

136
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,041
They just have to.

137
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,048
<i>Otherwise…</i>

138
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,385
I don't know.

139
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,847
I hope there really is a fire…

140
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,769
that kills everyone.

141
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:29,772
Right?

142
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,901
You want to die too?

143
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,243
No.

144
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,662
I know you wanna live.

145
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,459
You wanna live so badly…

146
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,588
that you want to die.

147
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,470
Why are you blaming me for this?
Su-hyeok brought it up.

148
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,681
Pooping's not a crime.

149
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,143
It's not a crime, but…

150
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,437
But what? Don't you need to go?

151
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,689
Yes, I do.

152
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,401
-Not poop, but, you know…
-What about you?

153
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,406
I don't… Pooping? No.

154
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,409
Don't you need to go?

155
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,244
Why are you asking me?

156
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,288
Why are you getting annoyed?

157
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,416
What do you want from us?
We can't go out, anyway.

158
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:35,880
I have an idea.

159
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,094
First…

160
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,472
The girls and the guys will take turns.

161
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,890
Where?

162
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,850
Here.

163
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,311
You're crazy.

164
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,896
Stop it, man.

165
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:52,980
Why?

166
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:57,151
The girls can wait in the other room,
and the guys can just pee out the window.

167
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,361
What about… poop?

168
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,822
Poop. Well…

169
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,992
You can take off your pants
and hang out the window.

170
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,577
Like this.

171
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,537
Outside.

172
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,582
Like you're taking a dump
at the edge of a cliff.

173
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,667
-Like this.
-What reaction is he hoping for?

174
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,878
Stop being ridiculous.

175
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,464
But someone has to hold you,
so you don't fall.

176
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,090
How are you going to wipe your butt?

177
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,302
-Well, someone else should.
-What is he saying?

178
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,261
Idiot.

179
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,514
Let's just hold it.

180
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,308
If the rescuers come--

181
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,185
It'll take a while for them to get here.

182
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:35,648
It may be the same outside of the school.

183
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,776
I don't know
how long we'll be stuck here,

184
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,319
but my dad always told me

185
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,696
to separate the bathroom
from where you sleep

186
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,240
if you find yourself stranded.

187
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,742
Where will we create a bathroom and how?

188
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,036
Right there.

189
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,751
Yes, sir.

190
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,128
They're sending a chopper.

191
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,589
We have to get to the roof
by 11:00 a.m. tomorrow.

192
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,176
What do you mean,
we have to go out to the roof

193
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,719
when it's swarming with the infected?

194
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,472
Also, 11:00 a.m. tomorrow?

195
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,641
Why can't you arrange it
for 11:00 p.m. tonight?

196
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:13,394
Yes, tomorrow. We'll spend the night here.

197
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,023
How can the assemblywoman sleep here?
Radio in again!

198
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,526
We'll have to stay here tonight,
so you're gonna have to create

199
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,819
a temporary bathroom.

200
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,362
-U-sin.
-Yes, sir.

201
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:35,457
Nam-ra and you guys, try to look
for something to cover the window.

202
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,375
Okay.

203
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,377
Cheong-san and Joon-yeong,

204
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,131
make something that can absorb urine
and feces to use as a toilet.

205
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,301
Cheong-san.

206
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,888
And then the rest of you…

207
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,556
A screen?

208
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,224
-A screen?
-Yes, a screen to block.

209
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,063
MUSIC 3

210
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,820
Come with me. Come on.

211
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,697
That's the bathroom.

212
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,671
Put this in here.

213
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:26,008
Why don't we put this
on top of the basket?

214
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,426
Oh, okay.

215
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,597
Okay. We're all gonna
use this as a toilet,

216
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,350
so that it will absorb urine and feces
as much as possible.

217
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,604
Put this in there too.

218
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,650
Dae-su's got a big butt, so let's…

219
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,362
Why don't we tape CDs up there?

220
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,615
-One more?
-Is there more tape?

221
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,546
What's going on?
Did they make the toilet yet?

222
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,798
What's taking them so long?

223
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:10,886
That's good.

224
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,263
-This should be good enough.
-Okay.

225
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,642
How do we poop on this?

226
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,770
Use the cover for poop,
and without for pee.

227
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:20,688
Get out.

228
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,814
-Oh.
-Out.

229
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:22,898
How do we use that?

230
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,985
-Get out. Get out. Get out!
-Come on. Don't push me! Aah!

231
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,035
At least there are cops
and soldiers out there, right?

232
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:41,834
But if you watch the movies,
they can't do anything, either, right?

233
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,379
Yeah, but they always save everyone
in the end.

234
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,926
-Here's the tissue.
-Pee. Just pee.

235
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,596
-Oh!
-Shit!

236
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,598
Why don't you just stay inside?

237
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,267
Does it smell?

238
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,977
-Shit.
-What?

239
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,105
Stop being so dramatic.
It doesn't smell at all.

240
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,940
Sit somewhere else.

241
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,901
There's nobody there.

242
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,738
There are no lights on
in the stores and apartments out there.

243
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,323
They all ran away or died.

244
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,700
What do you mean by that?

245
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,660
No one's coming here to save us.

246
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,539
Why do you have to be so pessimistic?

247
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,623
Don't you know my mom?

248
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,627
She would've torn the school apart
looking for me, but she isn't here yet.

249
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,837
So, what do you wanna do?

250
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,132
I'm just trying to point out the facts.

251
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,301
We all know that no one's coming.

252
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,345
So I think we should just figure out
what we're gonna do next.

253
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,222
We have to wait to be rescued.

254
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,267
We can't leave somewhere safe
to go somewhere dangerous.

255
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,770
And what if nobody comes?

256
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,731
We haven't been waiting that long yet.

257
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,858
How do you think we have to wait?

258
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,320
-Do you think we should wait until we die?
-No.

259
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,363
I'm saying let's wait as long as we can.

260
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,866
There's no way we can go out
right now, anyway.

261
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,160
It's probably
because it's nighttime.

262
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,621
I'm sure somebody will come
in the morning, maybe.

263
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,748
There are a lot of choppers flying around.

264
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,794
Let's just wait until tomorrow,
and we'll see.

265
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,021
What do you mean?

266
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,065
You're leaving first
for a personal matter?

267
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,236
How could a firefighter say
something like this during a crisis?

268
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,655
I'll take any punishment
when this is over.

269
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:35,948
I'll resign if I have to.

270
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,950
Listen.

271
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,786
Do you intend to leave all these people
and go by yourself?

272
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:44,540
You'll abandon your sick colleague
and leave a kid in charge?

273
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,084
A kid? He's not a kid.

274
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,794
He's a firefighter.

275
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:57,761
Fine.

276
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,471
I made a mistake.

277
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,808
Please accept my apologies.
I didn't mean to offend you.

278
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,936
But this isn't just about you.

279
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,231
My daughter is at school…

280
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,067
but I can't reach her.

281
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,070
I know she's waiting for me.

282
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,825
I need to go. I'm sorry.

283
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:20,742
Stop. Wait.

284
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,202
Let me tell you something.

285
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,336
His apartment is right there.

286
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,382
If he says he needs to go save his mother,

287
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,259
do I let him go?

288
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,055
And she lives right over there.

289
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,225
She has a husband and children.

290
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,936
Is it the right thing to do
to let her leave?

291
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,441
Knowing they'll all die if they go out?

292
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,738
I'll go even if I'll die.

293
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,991
That's exactly why I'm saying this.

294
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,288
You're a firefighter.

295
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,540
I'm a politician.

296
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,128
Do you know when it's the hardest
for people like us?

297
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,923
Right now.

298
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,218
Because we have to save the most people,

299
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,596
not the people most precious to us.

300
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,752
Fuck. Lucky me.

301
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,172
All I gotta do is get to the bike.

302
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,163
Shit.

303
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,816
Oh, damn! Wash up.

304
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,031
Do you know where the juniors are?

305
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,493
No, I don't know. Everyone's zombies.

306
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,828
It's not like they'd stay
with their class.

307
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,166
Stop that. You're driving me up the wall.

308
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,212
It's dark now, right?

309
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,254
Let's go.

310
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,883
Let's just go tomorrow.

311
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:08,470
It's too dark to see anything out there.
We won't see the zombies coming.

312
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:12,140
Before you said we should go at night,
so the zombies don't see us.

313
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,310
People change their minds
all the time, all right?

314
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,354
Shut up and get up already!

315
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,398
No, I'm not going.

316
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,524
I swear to…

317
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,652
Just forget it.

318
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,987
Hey. Grab your arrows and follow me.

319
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,198
Shut up and sit down.

320
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,951
That fucker.

321
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,578
Spoken like an athlete.

322
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:37,416
-What?
-Doing nothing is your specialty.

323
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,793
All you do is shoot arrows,
and you're gonna go to college

324
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,753
and make a bunch of money.
You're life's easy,

325
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,631
so all you know how to do
is sit on your ass and wait.

326
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,842
Who says shooting arrows
gets you into college?

327
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:47,968
Doesn't it?

328
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,137
You're so fucking ignorant.
Be quiet already.

329
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,304
You don't know anything.

330
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,431
Fuck you.

331
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,099
Hey.

332
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,226
How'd you know?

333
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,394
Hey.

334
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,439
How'd you know I was ignorant?

335
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,150
Huh? Is it on Facebook?

336
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,652
Just stop. Let it go already.

337
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,279
Why should she? She got hit.

338
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,197
Hey, don't hold back.

339
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:13,952
You fucking--

340
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,706
You little--

341
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,124
Let go of me!

342
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,669
-You shit, come at me!
-Stop it.

343
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:23,753
-Come at me, bitch.
-That's enough.

344
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:24,713
Come down, stop.

345
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,673
Come at me! Let go!

346
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,674
Stop it!

347
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,134
Get out of my way!

348
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,218
Cut it out!

349
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,887
-Hey.
-Let go of me.

350
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,681
Are you touching my boobs?

351
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:35,849
Get lost.

352
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,184
Come here! Come here!

353
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,852
-Come on, just stop.
-Who do you think you are…

354
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:39,895
People.

355
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,438
ANYONE ALIVE?
ANYBODY THERE?

356
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,024
This whole city is pure hell.

357
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,401
The cops won't answer the phone.

358
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,863
No first responders.

359
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,031
Shit.

360
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,408
LOOK AT HIS FACE LOL
YOU REALLY WENT?

361
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,661
{\an8}I'm going to hide
and wait for the rescuers.

362
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:02,000
{\an8}And please hit like
and subscribe to my channel, okay?

363
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,837
Goddamnit. Can't you just like it
after I did all this?

364
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,090
IS THIS REAL?
I RESPECT YOU, BROTHER

365
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,843
Okay. I'm going to go hide now.

366
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,014
Shit, shit, shit!

367
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:19,142
Oh, my god. Who left their garbage here?

368
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,937
MY CONDOLENCES
GARBAGE ASSHOLE LOL

369
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,023
LET'S NOT GO THERE
ZOMBIES ARE LIVING CORPSES

370
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,908
Look, everyone.

371
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,284
I CAN'T TURN THIS OFF
COME BACK

372
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,452
It's empty.

373
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,412
I think it's safe.

374
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,956
MY HEART'S RACING
I HATE ZOMBIES

375
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,457
I'm going in now.

376
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,710
THE SOUND MAKES IT SCARIER
IT'LL BE FULL OF ZOMBIES

377
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,463
YOU'RE WORKING HARD
SHOULD'VE BROUGHT A GUN

378
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,469
YOU SHOULD HIDE
STOP GOING

379
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,472
BE CAREFUL
WHAT IF THEY'RE IN THERE?

380
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,559
IT'S EMPTY, SPEND THE NIGHT
DON'T MAKE A SOUND!

381
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,395
Okay, looks like no one's here.

382
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:06,481
I'M SCARED…
SAFETY FIRST!

383
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:10,485
IT'S TOO DARK…
IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO RUN…

384
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,486
Hold on.

385
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,863
What is that?

386
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,496
Shit! Shit! Shit!

387
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,456
Damn it.

388
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,958
RUN! RUN!
I WANT TO GO THERE TOO

389
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,211
This is bad.

390
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,174
SO SCARY
IT'S ALL FAKE ANYWAY LOL

391
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,968
IS THAT REAL?
KEEP STREAMING!

392
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,136
Did you see all that?

393
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,387
Where do I go now?

394
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,941
Oh, shit. Damn it.

395
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,193
I'm surrounded.

396
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:00,619
Do you have any idea

397
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,538
what's going on out there?
You gotta tell me what you know.

398
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,794
The strong are now ripping apart the weak.

399
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,339
It happens all the time.

400
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,635
Are you crazy?

401
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,136
The world is crazy.

402
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,138
Why did you do this?

403
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,726
I tried to tell you,
but no one listened to me.

404
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,701
My son was bullied for a very long time.

405
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,771
<i>I only found out</i>
<i>when he tried to kill himself.</i>

406
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,525
<i>It was too late.</i>

407
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,319
<i>But I still thought I could fix it.</i>

408
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,530
SCHOOL VIOLENCE RESOLUTION COMMITTEE

409
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:19,864
We were just…

410
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,908
You know…

411
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,078
We were just fooling around.

412
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,962
Come on, guys.
We were just messing around.

413
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,590
That's what we do when we hang out, right?

414
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,302
Is that right?

415
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,144
Eun-ji?

416
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:58,737
Yes.

417
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,669
<i>They were just fooling around.</i>

418
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,796
Come on. Why would you go to the police?

419
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,840
The school punished them. That's enough.

420
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,176
Writing a few apologies is punishment?

421
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,761
They're just students.

422
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,638
They apologized and promised
not to do it again. That's enough.

423
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,307
We have the school evaluation coming up.

424
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,226
Do you really wanna make an issue
out of it and blow it out of proportion?

425
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,520
You're so right
about that, sir.

426
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,231
You got yourself kicked out
of a pharmaceutical company

427
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,900
and became a substitute teacher.

428
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:40,069
Our principal took you in
as a permanent member of the faculty.

429
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,613
You should be a team player

430
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,615
and work for the school too.

431
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,325
<i>That's how they always were.</i>

432
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,704
{\an8}<i>We transferred him immediately</i>
<i>pretty much to run away.</i>

433
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,291
{\an8}<i>And they kept finding him</i>
<i>and harassing him.</i>

434
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,586
I guess it was fun for them.

435
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,547
Like they're playing with a toy.

436
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,062
Hey, Dad.

437
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,902
Just fight back, would you?

438
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,324
Just be a man for once
and fight them back!

439
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,745
I'm sorry, Dad.

440
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,414
I just want to disappear.

441
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,503
That would be easier for me.

442
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,673
<i>That's when I realized it.</i>

443
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:46,052
We live in a system of assault.

444
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,806
A complete nobody like me…

445
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,394
can't change the system.

446
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,491
<i>So I decided</i>
<i>to change my son.</i>

447
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,787
<i>I just hoped he wouldn't die.</i>

448
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:16,040
<i>I didn't want him</i>
<i>to try and commit suicide again.</i>

449
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,380
<i>You created…</i>

450
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,510
<i>a monster.</i>

451
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,638
That's how desperate I was to save him.

452
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,683
Rather than die as a human,

453
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,603
I wanted him to survive as a monster.

454
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,815
Don't you realize
that monster is killing everyone?

455
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,484
Who cares if they all die?
They were all complicit.

456
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,403
You crazy asshole.

457
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,906
Who created this world?

458
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,825
I warned that if you ignore it
for being a minor assault,

459
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,077
violence would eventually rule the world.

460
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,454
But no one listened to me.

461
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,706
"It happens."

462
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,082
"Kids fight."

463
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,168
"They were bullied,
because they deserved it."

464
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,296
The bastards who thought that
and shunned them

465
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,673
made this world the hell
of what it is today!

466
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:22,231
No. You're the one who made this hellhole.
It's on you.

467
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,734
Maybe as a cop, I'm partly responsible.

468
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,820
But what about those people out there
dying without knowing why?

469
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,698
Sure. Maybe they're partly responsible
like you say.

470
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,951
But there are certain things
you must pay with death,

471
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,411
and certain things you must pay
as you live.

472
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,374
You wanted to change the world.

473
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:44,963
Not for everyone to die like this, huh.

474
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,720
{\an8}Day 39 of infection.

475
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,556
{\an8}I've tested several sedatives.

476
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,016
The most effective…

477
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:07,735
Where's the antidote?

478
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,447
Well, there has to be
some kind of treatment.

479
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:14,826
There's not.

480
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,671
Let's go now. We have to evacuate.

481
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,522
What are you looking at, asshole? Get on.

482
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:45,898
Go ahead and shove them in.

483
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,234
Yes, sir. Come on.

484
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:51,404
Move quickly. Go. Go.

485
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:26,105
Hey. What happened?

486
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,032
Holy shit.

487
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,873
<i>They're human beings</i>
<i>following their baseless instincts.</i>

488
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,627
<i>That is just one side of human nature.</i>

489
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,840
<i>Perhaps it's best to accept them</i>
<i>for what they are…</i>

490
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,844
{\an8}…and simply give up
on trying to find a way to treat them.

491
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,925
My laptop is in the school science lab.

492
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:18,843
Let's just go.

493
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,596
If you try to find a solution to all this
in there, that's the only way.

494
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,557
So let's get your laptop.
Come on. Let's go. Damn it.

495
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,603
Byeong-chan!

496
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:32,815
Go! Get out of here!

497
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,318
Go! Go now!

498
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:09,602
That was fucking close. What the fuck?

499
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,333
What the hell?

500
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,294
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait.

501
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,629
I'm stuck.

502
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,005
I'm not a zombie.

503
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,716
Here.

504
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,823
<i>The standards of being</i>
<i>humane emasculate human nature.</i>

505
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,617
{\an8}How are we different from a seeing eye dog

506
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,828
{\an8}stripped of its basic instincts
to run and bark?

507
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:13,291
<i>Must all dogs forfeit their instincts</i>
<i>and become seeing eye dogs?</i>

508
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,877
<i>Must all human beings abandon</i>
<i>their instincts to become humane?</i>

509
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,527
-Hey.
-Sir.

510
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,322
We'll go to the
Emergency Management Agency

511
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,825
to tell them to get the laptop
from the Hyosan High science lab.

512
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:50,703
The solution to this disaster is in there.

513
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:51,829
Got it?

514
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,873
Hyosan High School.
Science lab. The laptop.

515
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,708
Why are you telling me?

516
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:59,045
If I die, you have to stay alive
and tell them. You understand, asshole?

517
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,004
I do?

518
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,547
Yes, you dumbass.

519
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,840
Let's go.

520
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,091
Whoa.

521
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,760
Where are you going?

522
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,137
The Emergency Management Agency.
I told you two seconds ago.

523
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,306
Get your fucking head in the game.
Come on!

524
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,975
-We're going where?
-Emergency Management.

525
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:16,103
{\an8}-And tell them what?
-Hyosan High, science lab, laptop.

526
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,396
{\an8}-That's right.
-Okay.

527
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,523
-Are you ready?
-I'm not.

528
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,400
Let's go.

529
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,285
Go with me.

530
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,019
It's cold.

531
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,601
No one came.

532
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,617
This is insane.

533
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:57,413
There are no cops. I have no cigarettes.

534
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,540
There's no one here.

535
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,877
Really? There's nobody? No one out there?

536
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,961
Put me down.

537
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:06,922
My back.

538
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,257
Hey. Shit.

539
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,804
Hey. What's the move?

540
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,766
We have to leave.
No one's coming to save us.

541
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,688
All the zombies will see us.

542
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:24,940
Let's go at night.

543
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,026
Okay. You can stay right here.

544
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:31,030
Let's go out back, so we can try
and leave through the back gate.

545
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,490
That's the fastest route.

546
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,700
{\an8}-I'm going to the second floor first.
-Why there?

547
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,621
{\an8}My brother's a junior.
I'll get him if he's in the classroom.

548
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:43,834
Hey. Would a zombie really sit
and wait at his desk in his classroom?

549
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,921
Did you see him turn into a zombie?

550
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,506
He may have already.

551
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,257
There's no guarantee he didn't.

552
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:51,717
Shut up.

553
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,552
Why are you arguing?

554
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:54,929
Just fight, okay?

555
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,098
Sorry.

556
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,437
Come with me if you want.

557
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,403
She's so cool. Fuck.

558
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:13,405
So annoying.

559
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,494
Wait up.

560
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,996
They'll come for us eventually.

561
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,540
How long do we wait?

562
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,333
Until they come.

563
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,877
There's no guarantee they'll come, though.

564
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,922
So? You want to go out there?

565
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,925
Even if they come, they won't find us
if they don't know we're here.

566
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:35,344
Well, we can put up a sign for help.

567
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,303
How?

568
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:40,224
I remember my dad taught me
a signal that's used internationally.

569
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,934
What is it?

570
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,020
<i>It's Cheong-san. Bye, Dad.</i>

571
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,814
Hey, have another bite. Okay?

572
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,566
Hey, kid!

573
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:52,236
It was red and blue arranged together

574
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:57,992
to create some sort of a pattern.

575
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,334
Should we write "SOS" on a curtain, maybe?

576
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,086
Yeah, let's do that.

577
00:54:12,121 --> 00:54:14,422
Subtitle translation by: Jeong Lee

578
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,968
Three minutes without oxygen,

579
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:18,012
three days without water,
three weeks without food.

580
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,263
What's that?

581
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,265
How long a person can survive.

582
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:24,768
It's only been a day, you know.
We have to try the best we can.

583
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,772
We'll show signs of dehydration today.

584
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,441
And we won't be able to move by tomorrow.

585
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,234
What are you trying to say?

586
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,737
Are you saying we should go out, or…

587
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,117
are you saying we'll die, anyway,
so we shouldn't bother doing anything?

588
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,000
I don't know.

589
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,793
Then don't say anything.

590
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:56,925
I think the prez means we should think
about anything else that we can do.

591
00:43:58,218 --> 00:43:59,053
Right?

592
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,263
-No.
-No?

593
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,099
We don't know anything at all.

594
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:06,935
We need to know something
before we can make plans.

595
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,480
-What more do we need to know?
-What Nam-ra means--

596
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:12,441
You don't know what she's saying, either.

597
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,360
No.

598
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,907
Are you saying we need to understand
the situation in order to take action?

599
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,701
Yes, that's right.

600
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,286
Well, I totally agree with that.

601
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,332
We need more information to decide
whether to wait, run, or get out.

602
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:31,460
What can we find out on this situation,
and also, how?

603
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,796
We can check online
if we have a cell phone.

604
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,632
But we don't.

605
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:38,550
The teacher's office.

606
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,681
Why are you telling me that now?

607
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:44,640
Sorry.

608
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,435
Why are you telling me that, Cheol-su?
What do you want me to do about it?

609
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:53,899
What time is it now?

610
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,779
<i>It's 9:00 a.m.</i>

611
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:02,199
Hyosan High. Eun-ji.

612
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,868
Nude. Kim Cheol-su.

613
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:05,911
SCHEDULE SETTINGS

614
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,955
Schedule post…

615
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,164
{\an8}PROCESSING

616
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,708
…for 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

617
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,043
Bring the money by nine.

618
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:17,047
If you don't,
it'll be posted automatically.

619
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,928
<i>All I had to do</i>
<i>was give him money.</i>

620
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:26,098
But I couldn't because of the zombies.

621
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:29,560
I was going to ask the rescuers
to find his phone if they came, but…

622
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,103
It's past nine, right?

623
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:32,771
Not sure. I don't have my phone.

624
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,648
No way.

625
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,608
It can't be nine yet.

626
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,153
If that gets posted online, I'll…

627
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,578
What's wrong? Where are you going?
Where are you going?

628
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:50,706
-Let go. I should've died yesterday.
-Don't do this.

629
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,249
Please stop it!

630
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:55,210
Whether or not you die,
the video will be posted.

631
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,087
Nothing will change.

632
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,179
I guess you're right.

633
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:09,016
Even if I kill myself now,
everyone will still see my body.

634
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,101
Everyone's gonna watch.

635
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,020
And my mom…

636
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:14,772
It'll be okay.

637
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:18,025
We didn't do anything wrong.

638
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,777
We were victims.

639
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:23,655
I'm going.

640
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,866
Where?

641
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,576
-To get his phone.
-Are you insane?

642
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,079
Come with me.

643
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,749
-You filmed the whole thing.
-But…

644
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:35,793
I had no choice. They made me do it.

645
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:38,837
You pretty much committed murder
because you had no choice?

646
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:41,799
Still…

647
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,636
We'll die if we go.

648
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:46,929
That's so you.

649
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:49,640
You have no courage to live or die.

650
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,267
You're such a fucking coward, Cheol-su.

651
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:20,504
Cheong-san.

652
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,715
Stop being so stubborn.

653
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:28,303
Two rooms across and one floor down
at the teacher's office.

654
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:29,513
You shouldn't go.

655
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,890
If I can't make it,
I'll just come back, you know?

656
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:35,060
-Don't worry about me.
-I'm not worried about you.

657
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,980
-I'm pissed off.
-Sure.

658
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:40,649
Yes. Why would you worry about me?

659
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,071
Shit.

660
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,701
Su-hyeok.

661
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:51,785
I'll be back soon.

662
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,625
Careful, Cheong-san.

663
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,130
Bare-su has always been
loyal to me.

664
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,756
-You too?
-So I'm going too.

665
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,426
-Stop. Come on. Get down.
-Why?

666
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:09,553
You can't go out there
at your size, fatso.

667
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:13,140
-My size?
-Are you serious?

668
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,320
Why do you keep following me?

669
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,614
Who else do you have?

670
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,408
You better stay close.

671
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,039
Careful.

672
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,676
Can we go in?

673
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:51,595
Come back.

674
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:04,816
What are you gonna do?

675
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:10,322
Let's hang by our hands and go across.

676
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,576
No, I don't mean that.

677
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:18,330
I heard On-jo told you that she likes you.

678
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:22,376
-Are you going to go out with her?
-Is that important right now?

679
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:27,714
I'm not asking because it's important.
I'm just curious. That's all.

680
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:30,550
Why?

681
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,387
-Do you think I should?
-Hey.

682
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,555
Why would you even ask me that?

683
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,808
Do whatever you want. Who cares?

684
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,393
What do you think?

685
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:41,937
Go.

686
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:47,359
Go.

687
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:48,318
You go.

688
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,156
Be careful.

689
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:42,831
Why are you doing this to me?

690
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,419
Wait, wait, wait. Shh.

691
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:25,684
What is that sound?

692
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,979
I don't know. Let's go see.

693
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,078
Fucking die!

694
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,002
What is it?

695
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:13,940
GWI-NAM
UPLOAD

696
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,448
I'm gonna kill you!

697
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,786
Give it to me, fucker! I'll kill you!

698
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:13,917
Cheong-san.

699
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:37,774
You go! I'll meet you there!

700
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,694
Damn it.

701
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:57,919
Hey.

702
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,754
Hey, wake up.

703
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,133
You're Gwi-nam, right?

704
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,551
What? Why?

705
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,262
How is it outside? Still the same?

706
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:12,976
I don't know.

707
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:16,271
You can drive the car, right?

708
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:19,065
-I can't.
-Come on!

709
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,901
I had cover up your mess last year
when you guys drove your dad's car

710
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,403
and cause an accident!

711
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,613
Why do you ask?

712
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,660
Here's my car key.
It's in the parking lot.

713
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,329
License plate, 7340.

714
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,499
Bring it here.

715
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:42,547
Why?

716
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:45,759
Go to the night duty room
and out the window, it's in the lot.

717
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,553
No way.

718
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,431
You punk.
Listen to your principal at once!

719
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:52,932
I said no.

720
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,396
-Give me that. Give me that.
-You punk.

721
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,690
I said to let go.

722
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,442
Damn it.

723
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,237
Fine. Just get out of here.

724
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,155
Go with me.

725
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:09,115
Why should I? You go.

726
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,909
Go with me to the car.

727
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:14,829
It'd be nice to have a shield, anyway.

728
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,831
What's wrong with you? Stay away.

729
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,543
My god. Look at you.

730
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:25,090
All right, Mr. Principal.

731
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,549
If this were a game,

732
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,009
I'd be…

733
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:30,804
happy to kill you…

734
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:33,014
sir.

735
00:56:58,289 --> 00:56:59,165
Are you okay?

736
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,250
Yes.

737
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:04,629
All right. Let's go.
We need to go to the roof now.

738
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,715
Please, everyone, work together
like we practiced.

739
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,429
Hurry!

740
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:14,305
What's taking so long?

741
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,141
Hold on!

742
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,893
I'll do it. Block them.

743
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:20,311
-With the desk. Hurry!
-Yes, sir!

744
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,188
-Come with me.
-Okay! Okay!

745
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,196
Okay, come one by one. One by one.

746
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,116
Madam, please go.

747
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,826
-You go first.
-No, you go first!

748
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:37,328
-Just anyone! Come on!
-Go! Hurry!

749
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:40,915
Go! Hurry! Go!

750
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,796
Okay. Run on my signal.

751
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:51,009
Three! Two! One!

752
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,554
Now!

753
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:56,764
Get back!

754
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,693
Get back!

755
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:14,782
Hurry! Hurry!

756
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,245
-Back up!
-Yes, sir!

757
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:26,794
I've got it!

758
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,593
What now?

759
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:34,636
Hello?

760
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:39,682
Close the door!

761
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,145
Captain, below, below!

762
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:58,910
Captain, in here too!

763
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:12,215
Come upstairs now!

764
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:13,591
Go up first.

765
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:14,509
We can't.

766
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,345
The door to the roof is locked.

767
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:18,429
What?

768
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:20,139
The door is locked!

769
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:23,768
-U-sin, do you have the tools?
-Yes, I do.

770
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,229
-Go upstairs.
-What about the door?

771
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:27,480
Come on!

772
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:30,692
Go up now! Come on!

773
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:32,610
Hurry!

774
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:52,130
-Get out of the way. Get out of the way.
-Step aside.

775
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,643
Help him! Come on.

776
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:19,198
Okay. One, two…

777
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:58,821
-Hurry, ma'am.
-After you, ma'am.

778
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,698
Careful. Go. Go.

779
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:43,366
Holy shit, sir.

780
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,535
Hurry up, sir! Hurry!

781
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,123
What happened?

782
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:53,710
Careful. Hold on. Hurry, hurry.

783
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,402
You all did great in there.

784
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:22,196
Is anybody injured?

785
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,831
-Is that the principal?
-Get this jerk off my back!

786
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,291
-Get this psychopath!
-Shh!

787
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:16,501
What the hell, Gwi-nam?

788
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:17,585
Cheong-san.

789
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:19,337
Come here and tie his arms.

790
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:21,380
The bastard won't stay still.

791
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,716
Hey. What are you doing?

792
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:26,469
Come and tie him up.

793
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:29,180
You're finished. Do you hear me?
I'm expelling you! Untie me now!

794
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,016
Gwi-nam!

795
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:33,309
Stop that.

796
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:38,648
Stop what? This fucking guy…

797
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:41,442
tried to kill me.

798
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:47,573
He said to go out and get his car!

799
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:49,659
You call yourself a principal.

800
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,245
-Hey.
-That's right. Good idea.

801
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,038
I'm filming everything.

802
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,166
Let go, or I'm gonna send this
to the police immediately.

803
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,836
You little… I will kill you.

804
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:02,088
Just stop acting like human garbage.

805
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:05,424
No one respects you
just because you act tough.

806
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,260
I'm the new boss of this school.

807
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:10,596
-Don't you get it?
-Don't make me laugh.

808
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:15,434
You're just a fucking loser
who will serve bullies…

809
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:17,603
for his entire life.

810
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:26,904
Yeah? Say that again.

811
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:28,698
