<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a big gap.</font>

2
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This feels
like the only route, let's keep going.</font>

3
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:24,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

4
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right, kid.
Never be easy.</font>

5
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:32,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

6
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 1, 2, 3!

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

8
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

9
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my god.
- Never better.</font>

10
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

11
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Whoa, whoa, you're good.
- Shit.</font>

12
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're good. Yeah?</font>

13
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're good?
- No.</font>

14
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, you've done way scarier than this.</font>

15
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember A.J. Hackett, snake dike?</font>

16
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stupid singing competition.
God, you married this sad sack,</font>

17
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for Christ's sake.</font>

18
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah? Okay.
- Okay.</font>

22
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my girl.</font>

23
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ew! Gross!</font>

24
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys, get a room!</font>

25
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here comes Ethan hunt.</font>

26
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Careful, H, there's loose rock
around the elbow.</font>

27
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Worry about your ropes, bitches.</font>

28
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm fine.</font>

29
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>

30
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try to keep up!</font>

31
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Taking your time there, hotshot.</font>

32
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunter, you show off!</font>

33
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:01,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>

34
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on, Dan.
Hold on, I'm coming.</font>

35
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dan, are you okay?</font>

36
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just hold on. I'm coming down.</font>

37
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Come on. I can't make it.</font>

38
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my god.
- Okay, Becky, Becky.</font>

39
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need a little more length.</font>

40
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you un-clip? Are you secure?</font>

41
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you secure?
- Yeah.</font>

42
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'm... I'm secure.</font>

43
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just un-clip and I'll be able
to swing to the rock.</font>

44
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- I think I can reach it.</font>

45
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ready?</font>

46
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you reach it?</font>

47
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just... just one second.</font>

48
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. I think I can make it.</font>

49
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on, Dan.</font>

50
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm almost there.
- Just need a little more momentum.</font>

51
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

52
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

53
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dan!</font>

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

55
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Becky and Dan.
Leave a message.</font>

56
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Becky, it's me.</font>

57
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I've tried to console you
every way I know how.</font>

58
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I...</font>

59
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't help you
if you don't pick up the phone.</font>

60
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sweetheart, I'm worried about you.</font>

61
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So whenever you stop hating on me,</font>

62
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am here.</font>

63
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, what's up?</font>

64
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is just the voice mail.
You've reached Dan.</font>

65
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just leave a message,
I'i/ hit you back when I can.</font>

66
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get it off at the beep.</font>

67
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

68
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miss you.</font>

69
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, what? Are you stalking me now?</font>

70
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I just don't know what else to do,
'cause you're not answering your phone.</font>

71
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Take a hint.
- I-I think this is getting</font>

72
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- a little bit ridiculous.
- "Ridiculous"?</font>

73
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:24,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You told me I shouldn't be so broken up
about him because he was an asshole.</font>

74
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. I said that maybe he didn't
belong on this pedestal</font>

75
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you were putting him up on,</font>

76
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that he wasn't this martyr
that you've been making him out to be.</font>

77
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is how you console your daughter?</font>

78
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just want you to be able
to move on with your life.</font>

79
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:39,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to move on. I miss him!</font>

80
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every day, I miss the way he looked at me.</font>

81
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I miss the way he made me feel.
- Sweetie.</font>

82
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't!
- Don't what?</font>

83
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think you're doing, Becky?</font>

84
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Getting away from you.
- You are not driving. Stop it.</font>

85
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck off!</font>

86
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't get to talk to me like that.</font>

87
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your mother and I,
we raised you better than that.</font>

88
00:06:55,373 --> 00:07:00,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So getting shit-faced
and pushing the people away that love you,</font>

89
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's not gonna work.</font>

90
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:05,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, look,
a horrible thing happened to you,</font>

91
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you have to start
living your life again.</font>

92
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:11,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right? There's a whole big wide world
out there that needs you</font>

93
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and believe it or not, I need you.</font>

94
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me give you a ride home.</font>

95
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd rather walk.</font>

96
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me ask you something.</font>

97
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:29,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If roles reversed, if it had been you
that had fallen that day,</font>

98
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">do you think Dan
is standing out here alone?</font>

99
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drowning in booze, grief, sorrow,
whatever the hell this is?</font>

100
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not.</font>

101
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you damn well know it.</font>

102
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God damn it, Becky, I need you to try.</font>

103
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know what I need, dad?</font>

104
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to leave me alone.</font>

105
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God damn it.</font>

106
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The number you have
called has been disconnected.</font>

107
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mwmm</font>

108
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hi!
- Hey.</font>

109
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look, um...</font>

110
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Awful.
- Yeah.</font>

111
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, like really freakin' awful.
Well, come here.</font>

112
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what brings you back?</font>

113
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you finally ready to rest?</font>

114
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll rest when I'm dead.</font>

115
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have something that's planned
and I need a partner in crime.</font>

116
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:30,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, your dad called me a few weeks ago.</font>

117
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:34,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He didn't know who else to turn to,
and he said that you were in a bad place.</font>

118
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He had no right to do that.
- He's worried about you.</font>

119
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's coming up on a year.
He doesn't want you to be alone.</font>

120
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, the only thing
that drives me crazier</font>

121
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">than Dan's boxed ashes
collecting dust in there</font>

122
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is my best friend stuck in here with him.</font>

123
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I have something
that I wanna pitch you.</font>

124
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not gonna like it,
but just try to keep an open mind.</font>

125
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The 8-6? TV tower.</font>

126
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's only a 6-hour drive from here.</font>

127
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was planning on climbing it this weekend</font>

128
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I wanted to see
if you'd climb it with me.</font>

129
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:14,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It would be an adventure,
like old times.</font>

130
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you could scatter Dan's ashes on top.</font>

131
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:22,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I just... I haven't climbed since...
- I get it.</font>

132
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:27,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if you don't confront your fears,
you are always going to be afraid.</font>

133
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it that Dan used to say?</font>

134
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Don't... die if you wanna live</font>

135
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or keep living even if you're dying."</font>

136
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit, I feel like
I'm messing this pitch up.</font>

137
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm sorry.</font>

138
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunter, I just... I can't.</font>

139
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like I know I can't do it, I'm sorry.</font>

140
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you're gonna be okay.</font>

141
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can't.

<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

143
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Morning, Princess.</font>

144
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong?</font>

145
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,781

don't be afraid to live."</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what Dan used to say.</font>

147
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's do it.</font>

148
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's climb your stupid tower.</font>

149
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my god, Becky, baby, I'm so excited!</font>

150
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never
actually seen this video.</font>

151
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit, I was really ripped.</font>

152
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah! You're awesome.</font>

153
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is the Becky
that we need for this trip.</font>

154
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw!</font>

155
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:16,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit! Look at your beaming face.</font>

156
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, who's this in the photo with you?</font>

157
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. It's an oldie.</font>

158
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who is it?
- Nobody.</font>

159
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just give it back.
- Hunter has a boyfriend.</font>

160
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's nothing. Just some guy.</font>

161
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that some guy sure knew
how to tickle your whistle.</font>

162
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo, what's up, guys?</font>

163
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Danger D, and I'm back stateside, yo!</font>

164
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hashtag, super badass.</font>

165
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, in my defense,</font>

166
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I may act like a total dick on camera,
but it's worth it.</font>

167
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get paid for this shit.</font>

168
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's enough to keep me traveling
and you know me,</font>

169
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to be doing dangerous shit
to keep my blood pumping,</font>

170
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I might as well monetize that.</font>

171
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just saying,
if you're gonna be a youtuber,</font>

172
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">why not be yourself? You are awesome.</font>

173
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:09,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Natural born clickbait.
- No.</font>

174
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What we're doing here, this is clickbait.</font>

175
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me?</font>

176
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have somewhere
I could charge my phone?</font>

177
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Power ain't free, ma'am.</font>

178
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, and do you know
where the B-67 TV tower is?</font>

179
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't find it on the map.</font>

180
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:31,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't need a map.
You see that light way up there?</font>

181
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's your tower.</font>

182
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's insanely high.</font>

183
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's with the light? I thought you said
it was out of commission.</font>

184
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So aircraft can see it.</font>

185
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:48,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, this was once
the tallest structure in the US.</font>

186
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now it's just this old relic.</font>

187
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're due
to tear it down next winter.</font>

188
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:55,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Becky?</font>

189
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Becky?</font>

190
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Give me your phone charger.</font>

191
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

192
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A very cool life hack.</font>

193
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I'm just gonna line up the prongs</font>

194
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:13,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the elements in the lamp. And...</font>

195
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's that for a dumb youtuber?</font>

196
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:40,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, honey.</font>

197
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,423

200
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am saying it.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a mile?</font>

227
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe two-ish?</font>

228
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn, it's hot.</font>

229
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll cool down
once we get some air time.</font>

230
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've got enough water, you think?</font>

231
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Water's check. Harnesses check.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd do the same

253
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is awful.</font>

254
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, guys!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">4th-highest structure in the us.</font>

258
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna begin our grueling journey</font>

259
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with an 1,800-foot ladder climb</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here.</font>

271
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:17,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take a breath.</font>

272
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After Dan died,
I was afraid of my own shadow.</font>

273
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I pushed through.</font>

274
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I overcame the fear. I took control.</font>

275
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:35,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not let this fear consume you.
Come at it head on and kick its ass.</font>

276
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you can beat it, you can beat anything.</font>

277
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:42,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm right here
beside you the whole time.</font>

278
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are so much stronger
than you think you are.</font>

279
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So shut your shit and let's do this.</font>

280
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, Hunter.</font>

281
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, that's the kind of shit
you should be posting on Instagram.</font>

282
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

283
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, this is so cool.</font>

284
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit.</font>

285
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this.</font>

286
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it, Hunter.
You are such an asshole.</font>

287
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you getting us into?
- Don't worry.</font>

288
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've got 50 feet of rope between us.</font>

289
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're clipped in and we're all good.</font>

290
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:25,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

291
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One rung at a time,
and let me know if you have to rest.</font>

292
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay.</font>

293
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See?</font>

294
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's easy.</font>

295
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

296
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:23,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're doing great. Come on.</font>

297
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

298
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're doing great.</font>

299
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

300
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:53,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunter?</font>

301
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hunter?
- Yeah?</font>

302
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we rest a moment?
I need a drink.</font>

303
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

304
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those guylines means we're halfway up.</font>

305
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perfect spot.</font>

306
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna know something crazy?</font>

307
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

308
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Halfway up?</font>

309
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That means we've climbed about 1,000 feet.</font>

310
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we've climbed the height
of the Eiffel Tower.</font>

311
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please don't say shit like that, Hunter.</font>

312
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

313
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's the motel. And the diner.</font>

314
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:37,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No way. Looks like a little toy town.</font>

315
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's just get this over with.
- Yeah.</font>

316
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Catch up.</font>

317
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it.</font>

318
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Becky, you're doing amazing.</font>

319
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! Come on, Becky!</font>

320
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

321
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the end of the internal ladder.</font>

322
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One step at a time, okay? You got this.</font>

323
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The next 200 feet is external.</font>

324
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:49,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not gonna lie.</font>

325
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:53,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna get a little bit crazy
when we're out of the cage in the open.</font>

326
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But don't panic.</font>

327
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunter. Hunter!</font>

328
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunter! Hunter!</font>

329
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:13,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Becky! You gotta come up. It's so sick!</font>

330
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

331
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hunter?
- I'm here.</font>

332
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just like 200 feet more, that's all.</font>

333
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:37,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can't!
- Yes, you can!</font>

334
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just look up and only up.</font>

335
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're doing great. You got this.</font>

336
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Okay.</font>

337
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:06,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

338
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah! You're killing it!</font>

339
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>

340
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're okay.</font>

341
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember, only look up.</font>

342
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:47,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell are we doing?</font>

343
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

344
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop overthinking.</font>

345
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How?
- I don't know.</font>

346
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Concentrate on something else, like...</font>

347
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:59,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sing a-a nursery rhyme or some shit.</font>

348
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:03,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay.</font>

349
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

350
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> ring around the roses <i></font>

353
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,946

354
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't have picked that one.</font>

355
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

356
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Okay, Becks,</font>

357
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:27,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this is gonna look
a little bit worse than it is.</font>

358
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:30,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, what the hell, Hunter?
Let's just go back down!</font>

359
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:40,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Becky, if I let you go back now,
fear wins.</font>

360
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm not going to let that happen.</font>

361
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, Becks.</font>

362
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

363
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:24,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got your weight.</font>

364
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:28,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks. Okay.</font>

365
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:48,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Reach up. Oh, yeah.
- Okay.</font>

366
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

367
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:01,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Smooth as sailing to the top now.
You got this.</font>

368
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I actually really do hate you, Hunter.</font>

369
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, does this ladder feel loose to you?</font>

370
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:15,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop, you click, Hunter!</font>

371
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:17,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

372
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that?</font>

373
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, we're almost there.</font>

374
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on.
- Okay.</font>

375
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:05,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

376
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Becky, you're not gonna believe this.
You gotta come up here.</font>

377
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming.</font>

378
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Whoo!</font>

379
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

380
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunter.</font>

381
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, trust me.</font>

382
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay.</font>

383
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck, Becky!</font>

384
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm here. Oh, my god.</font>

385
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my god.</font>

386
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We did it, Becks!
I knew you could.</font>

387
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:08,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>

388
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>

389
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go!</font>

390
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- On top of the goddamn world!
- Whoo!</font>

391
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you wanna try?</font>

392
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:45,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit! Hunter, stop!</font>

393
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:49,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just focus on getting a good shot.
I didn't wear this stupid bra for nothing.</font>

394
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, Hunter.
- Whoo!</font>

395
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Swoop it around!</font>

396
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seize your day!</font>

397
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Oh, my god.</font>

398
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:15,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd it look?</font>

399
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Insane! Insane. Crazy.</font>

400
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get this bad boy back.</font>

401
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit, so sick, dude.</font>

402
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:28,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Now the ultimate, Becks.</font>

403
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your turn.</font>

404
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? No.</font>

405
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you want to kick fear
in the dick or not?</font>

406
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, Hunter.</font>

407
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:44,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The old Becky would have done it.</font>

408
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just saying...
- Dude.</font>

409
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:50,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here. I'll hold your hand.</font>

410
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah?</font>

411
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

412
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on!</font>

413
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can do this.</font>

414
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You can do it.
- Okay, okay, okay.</font>

415
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I got you.
- Okay.</font>

416
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Whoa!</font>

417
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You can trust me.
- Whoa, okay.</font>

418
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:21,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I've got you, Becks.
- Oh, my god.</font>

419
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Careful over the ledge.</font>

420
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:27,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take it easy.</font>

421
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I've got you. I've got you.</font>

422
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open your eyes.</font>

423
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:43,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo-hoo!</font>

424
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, just one more.</font>

425
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're coming up right now.</font>

426
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My god, you did it.</font>

427
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:05,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did it! You did it, you idiot.</font>

428
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! Look.</font>

429
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:14,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Look how amazing these are.
- Oh, my god. Whoa!</font>

430
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next time you are ever afraid of anything,</font>

431
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to look at these and know
that you have nothing to be afraid of.</font>

432
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:29,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- Yeah.</font>

433
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:31,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm really proud of you.</font>

434
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:33,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dan would be, too.</font>

435
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

436
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, it's time.</font>

437
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:30,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and I were one, Dan.</font>

438
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:34,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And whenever I needed a laugh,</font>

439
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you told me one of your shit jokes.</font>

440
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:45,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And whenever I needed
a shoulder to cry on, it was yours.</font>

441
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now you're gone and I'm...</font>

442
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't feel whole anymore.</font>

443
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I miss you, um, just so much and I'm...</font>

444
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:08,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you.</font>

445
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goodbye, Dan.</font>

446
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:32,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey.
- I'm sorry.</font>

447
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:35,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just didn't expect it
to hit me like that.</font>

448
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've just been so far away for so long.</font>

449
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It just didn't really feel real
until then.</font>

450
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

451
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:53,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get back down on earth, okay?</font>

452
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know about you,
but I really need to pee.</font>

453
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:58,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've needed to pee
since we passed the Eiffel Tower.</font>

454
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay?</font>

455
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:05,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, home time.
- Home time.</font>

456
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Harnesses?
- Harnesses.</font>

457
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think of the ice-cold
beers waiting for us.</font>

458
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, stop.</font>

459
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I've got you.
- Okay, slowly.</font>

460
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:24,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.
Uh, I'm just getting a stitch here.</font>

461
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:26,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay.</font>

462
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

463
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunter!</font>

464
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:26,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my god! Oh, my god, holy shit.</font>

465
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't let go.
- Yeah, I got you.</font>

466
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:34,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunter!</font>

467
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, god, please don't drop me.</font>

468
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't drop me.</font>

469
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Becks?</font>

470
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:08,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got you, Becks.</font>

471
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can see the ladder.</font>

472
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got you.</font>

473
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just died almost.</font>

474
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my god.</font>

475
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did that really just happen?</font>

476
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my...
- Jesus Christ!</font>

477
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish we'd filmed that.</font>

478
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:50,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you're here.</font>

479
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get back on the ground
before I actually pee myself.</font>

480
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:55,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, take 2.</font>

481
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

482
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The ladder. It's gone.</font>

483
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunter, how do we get down?</font>

484
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:33,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shit!
- Please tell me there's a way to go down.</font>

485
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing on the pole
I can get a good foothold on.</font>

486
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- Oh, no.</font>

487
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:38,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.</font>

488
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, there must be something.</font>

489
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:45,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Shit. I don't have a signal.</font>

490
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:49,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't get it, either.</font>

491
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure there's something,
I'm sure it's just really spotty up here.</font>

492
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we're too freaking high.
There's no signal up here.</font>

493
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna be okay.</font>

494
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:59,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freaking out is not gonna help anything
right now, so just take a breath.</font>

495
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're stuck on a pizza-sized platform
in the middle of nowhere, Hunter.</font>

496
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:05,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Becky, freaking out
is not gonna help anything.</font>

497
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not gonna help, okay?</font>

498
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

499
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:13,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sure we can...
- Wait, Hunter. Hunter, Hunter.</font>

500
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:14,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this.</font>

501
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my god.</font>

502
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Binoculars. Amazing.
- Okay.</font>

503
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a flare.</font>

504
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:21,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

505
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

506
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is great news.
- Okay. Great.</font>

507
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:39,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit, our bag is down there.</font>

508
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, man, our water's in there.</font>

509
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit, we're gonna die of thirst.</font>

510
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No. No.
- We don't have water.</font>

511
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:48,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, think about it...
- That's how you die when you're stranded.</font>

512
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The noise! The noise that this thing
made when it crashed,</font>

513
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:53,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there is no way nobody heard that. Okay?</font>

514
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:58,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm-I'm sure that there are, like,
multiple calls to 911 as we speak.</font>

515
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:02,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you really think so?
- Yeah.</font>

516
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, the cavalry is coming, okay?
We just... we just have to wait.</font>

517
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Okay.</font>

518
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy...</font>

519
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What? What?
- Becky, your leg.</font>

520
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:15,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My god.</font>

521
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell?</font>

522
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't even notice this.</font>

523
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:21,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

524
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:22,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Um, whoa!
- Come here.</font>

525
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:24,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's compress it.
- Ow!</font>

526
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you okay? I know.
- It really hurts. Can you just like...</font>

527
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Okay.
- Can you warn me?</font>

528
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Count of 3?
- Yeah. 1...</font>

529
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:33,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2... sorry. I'm really sorry.</font>

530
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I know.
- Oh, man.</font>

531
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>

532
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know I'm like,
I'm okay. It's like...</font>

533
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:46,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really have to pee.</font>

534
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:47,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just go.</font>

535
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:50,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just pee.
- No, it's fine. I can hold it.</font>

536
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just need to get comfortable.</font>

537
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:04,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you go any farther?
It's, like, spraying.</font>

538
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, careful over the ledge.
- I'm trying.</font>

539
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop looking at me.</font>

540
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, god. That's a relief.</font>

541
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just grateful you didn't need to shit.</font>

542
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, well, we should find
a way to get comfortable,</font>

543
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause I think we're gonna
be up here for a while.</font>

544
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

545
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right!</font>

546
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:36,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you really think someone's coming?</font>

547
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One million percent.</font>

548
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:24,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, danger d, what's happening, guys?</font>

549
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll tell you what's happenin', Becky C.</font>

550
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:32,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are stuck at the top
of a 2,000-foot tower with no way down.</font>

551
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:35,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I shot some of the best
goddamn footage of my life.</font>

552
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:36,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And no way to upload it.</font>

553
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:39,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what worrying you
about the situation?</font>

554
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:40,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's quite ironic.</font>

555
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, don't worry,
you'll still be famous if you fall,</font>

556
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:47,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as the girl who died taking a selfie.
Now, that is ironic.</font>

557
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:52,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would like to be remembered for my life,
not my death, thank you very much.</font>

558
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hashtag, life over death.</font>

559
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hashtag, Becky's a dick hole.</font>

560
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hashtag, Hunter says she's doing
this YouTube thing for the money,</font>

561
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but really I think
she's just like a "like" whore.</font>

562
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:05,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's not like that.
- Okay, what is it like, then?</font>

563
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, show us who you are.
Show us Shiloh Hunter.</font>

564
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell us why you vlog.</font>

565
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:17,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, firstly, you're an asshole.</font>

566
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Secondly,</font>

567
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">um... ahem...</font>

568
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this is gonna sound stupid...</font>

569
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I do this because of Dan.</font>

570
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:39,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened, it...</font>

571
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It just made me realize
that life is fleeting.</font>

572
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I want to spread that message,
that life is short, too short.</font>

573
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:52,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you gotta use every moment.</font>

574
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:56,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to do something
that makes you feel alive.</font>

575
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was amazing.</font>

576
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, I mean, I told you,
you should just be yourself.</font>

577
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was really great.</font>

578
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Should I kill danger d?
- Mm-hmm.</font>

579
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:25,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll help you Bury the body.</font>

580
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:42,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit.</font>

581
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:45,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's like an old RV thing down there.</font>

582
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:48,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can I see?
- Just past the gate, a little over.</font>

583
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:53,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. That looks abandoned.</font>

584
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:59,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been 5 hours. If anyone
called 911, they'd be here by now.</font>

585
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:19,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my god. Holy shit.</font>

586
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:22,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on, Becky,
we don't get service up here,</font>

587
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:25,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but we definitely did down there.
Remember I got all those likes?</font>

588
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:27,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

589
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:28,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

590
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:31,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so we don't know
at what point we lost service.</font>

591
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe it was just up here
because of some, like,</font>

592
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- interference with the broadcast antenna.
- Yeah.</font>

593
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:37,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you're definitely
onto something, Hunter.</font>

594
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, we have 50 feet of rope.</font>

595
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can try to fish for coverage.</font>

596
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just need something to secure this with.</font>

597
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:45,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- My hair tie.
- Yeah, perfect.</font>

598
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:46,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

599
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:50,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Can you message
emergency services?</font>

600
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:53,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think so. But I have
over 60,000 followers.</font>

601
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:55,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Help us.</font>

602
00:48:55,433 --> 00:49:01,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stuck on 8-67 tower. Call 911</font>

603
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's ready to post.</font>

604
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:05,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should hear it when it sends.</font>

605
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on.</font>

606
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:16,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Okay.</font>

607
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me see if I can get lower.</font>

608
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just be careful.</font>

609
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got it, okay. Come on.</font>

610
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:36,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the end.</font>

611
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:38,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I didn't hear anything.
- I didn't, either.</font>

612
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think it posted.</font>

613
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:46,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, maybe I can get lower.</font>

614
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:47,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? What do you mean? Just...</font>

615
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got it. I've got an idea.</font>

616
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:58,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Careful, Hunter.
- Feels solid.</font>

617
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.</font>

618
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

619
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my god. Careful.
- Shit. Shit.</font>

620
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my god, Hunter.</font>

621
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:18,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you okay? Oh, my god.
- Yeah. Yeah.</font>

622
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Careful. Shit.</font>

623
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:32,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't hear anything. Nothing.</font>

624
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, you need to come back up.</font>

625
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:38,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

626
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:47,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it.</font>

627
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:01,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did it post?
- No.</font>

628
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What do we do now?
- I don't know.</font>

629
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, hold on.</font>

630
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We know there's a signal
at the base for sure.</font>

631
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- What if we just drop the phone?</font>

632
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:17,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, but what if my phone
just shatters into a million pieces?</font>

633
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:20,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not if we reinforce it somehow,
so it doesn't like the egg drop challenge.</font>

634
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:22,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Okay, shit.</font>

635
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:25,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, we just need something to...
To put it in.</font>

636
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:28,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- This.</font>

637
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:31,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's welded on. My shoe's too flimsy.</font>

638
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Your shoe?
- Yeah, perfect.</font>

639
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:35,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, got it.</font>

640
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:42,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need some padding.
Can we use your sock?</font>

641
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Okay.</font>

642
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

643
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:52,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We still need something more substantial.</font>

644
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:56,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Hunter. Your push-up bra.</font>

645
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:58,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That is more substantial.
- Yeah.</font>

646
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:00,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dying to get this thing off, anyway.</font>

647
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:04,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, VS.</font>

648
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:07,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

649
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:09,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope it's strong enough.</font>

650
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:10,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shove it real good.</font>

651
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:15,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

652
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:19,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here goes nothing.</font>

653
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:37,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did it work?
- I don't know. I can't tell.</font>

654
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:55,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you see anything?
- No, nothing.</font>

655
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry. They're coming.</font>

656
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:10,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit! There's a freaking guy!</font>

657
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:12,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Oh, my god. Yes.</font>

658
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:13,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And a dog, too.</font>

659
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey! Up here!
- Hey, help us!</font>

660
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:23,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I sent you the check, man. Come on.</font>

661
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:26,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need that...</font>

662
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey!
- Hey, boy! Big boy!</font>

663
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:34,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Parker.</font>

664
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come! Come on, boy.</font>

665
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, no, no.</font>

666
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:41,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit!</font>

667
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:46,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

668
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:47,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>

669
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:51,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goddamn it, they're getting away.</font>

670
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Parker.</font>

671
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He got the shoe.</font>

672
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:13,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey! Up here!
- Look up here. Please!</font>

673
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:23,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey!
- Hey!</font>

674
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:24,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He's walking!
- Hey!</font>

675
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, no, no, turn around!
- Turn around!</font>

676
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right here!</font>

677
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:39,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shit! Shit!
- Hey!</font>

678
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no.
Do not fire the flare, he's not looking.</font>

679
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This might be our only chance.</font>

680
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:48,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, he's not looking.</font>

681
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:51,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait.</font>

682
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:53,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on. There's somebody by the RV.</font>

683
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:56,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He's setting up a grill or some shit.
- Okay.</font>

684
00:54:56,877 --> 00:55:00,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we'll fire the flare when the sun goes
down in like... in like an hour.</font>

685
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:01,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've only got one shot at this.</font>

686
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:06,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, damn.
- What?</font>

687
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:08,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They're making ribs.
- Oh, no.</font>

688
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:11,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And they have really cold beer.
- Don't.</font>

689
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:30,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These guys are definitely a couple.</font>

690
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:33,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dirty weekend away.</font>

691
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm jealous.</font>

692
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:54,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey, hey. They're finishing up.</font>

693
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's now or never, fire the flare.</font>

694
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is it dark enough?
- Uh-huh.</font>

695
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:00,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

696
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shit.
- Shit. What the hell?</font>

697
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:03,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why isn't it firing?
- I fired it.</font>

698
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cocked it, maybe
there's a safety or something?</font>

699
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:08,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit. Okay, they're going in, they're
going in. You have to do the flare now.</font>

700
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:09,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm trying. It's stuck.
- Get it to go.</font>

701
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:10,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I got it. I got it.</font>

702
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:19,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Randy,
come check this shit out.</font>

703
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:21,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, give me your phone.
- Okay.</font>

704
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, sons of bitches, up here!</font>

705
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:28,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit! Check this out.</font>

706
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Up here! Hey!</font>

707
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:32,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, wait, wait,
they're looking at us.</font>

708
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:33,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- They can see us.</font>

709
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:35,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my god!</font>

710
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit! Oh, my god,</font>

711
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">let me see, let me see, let me see.</font>

712
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:40,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my god, they're coming.</font>

713
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:42,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

714
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit, they found the car.
They found our car, they found our car.</font>

715
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They have a... a crowbar.
They're probably gonna open the gate.</font>

716
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:57,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Okay.</font>

717
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wait, what the hell?
- Wait, what's going on?</font>

718
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:02,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They stopped.
- What?</font>

719
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quit chatting, go open the freakin' gate.</font>

720
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:07,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, no, no. What the hell?</font>

721
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They're stealing my freakin' car!
- What?</font>

722
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, you sons of bitches!
- Hey!</font>

723
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:14,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You asshole! What the hell?</font>

724
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:16,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! I need to see it!</font>

725
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:22,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my god. No, no!
- Die, you freakin' assholes!</font>

726
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. New rule.</font>

727
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If somebody falls off the tower,</font>

728
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:22,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they bring the cell phone with them,
and call for help on the way down.</font>

729
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:27,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And maybe post that video.</font>

730
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kidding-ish.</font>

731
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:38,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, my leg. I could eat aspirin
like skittles right now.</font>

732
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:43,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's looking a little funky.</font>

733
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could use some washing, here.</font>

734
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:58,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

735
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:10,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll just keep it wrapped up.</font>

736
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong?</font>

737
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dan could never say the words,
"I love you."</font>

738
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1-4-3.</font>

739
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:31,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1-4-3.</font>

740
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Becky, I...
- How long?</font>

741
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4 months.</font>

742
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a huge mistake.</font>

743
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:55,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.</font>

744
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:58,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For sleeping with my husband
or me finding out about it?</font>

745
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For falling in love with the same guy.</font>

746
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:33,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who made the move?</font>

747
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Both super drunk.
- Who?</font>

748
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:41,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He did.</font>

749
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:47,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it was a huge, huge mistake, Becks.</font>

750
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:51,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

751
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A mistake is a kiss, a one-night stand.</font>

752
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said you loved him, so...</font>

753
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It got out of hand.</font>

754
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:08,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tried so hard not to,
but I fell for him. I mean...</font>

755
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:10,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He listened to me, he was...</font>

756
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:15,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was just different than every
other douchebag that I'd ever dated and...</font>

757
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'd never felt that way before.</font>

758
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then you asked me to be
your maid of honor</font>

759
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it all hit me like a ton of bricks,
how messed up this all was.</font>

760
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I loved him, but...</font>

761
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:35,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I love you more, so I ended it.</font>

762
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:42,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was just so hard
seeing you guys together.</font>

763
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And after Dan died, I...</font>

764
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:49,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just didn't have the strength
to be there for you,</font>

765
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:52,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to be strong enough for you, so...</font>

766
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:54,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I ran away.</font>

767
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now you hate me and I don't blame you,</font>

768
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:01,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and now we're stuck on this stupid,
freaking tower</font>

769
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:02,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the middle of freaking nowhere.</font>

770
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's all my fault.</font>

771
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:10,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am so, so sorry.</font>

772
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:25,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

773
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:29,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I set it when we dropped
the phone down yesterday.</font>

774
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:33,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been 24 hours.</font>

775
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:40,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it's time to accept that either
your 60,000 followers don't give a shit</font>

776
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or your phone's down there
in a million pieces.</font>

777
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:45,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

778
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:49,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we've got one more shot. Your phone.</font>

779
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:52,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, no padding this time, though.
Even less of a chance.</font>

780
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:55,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if this fails
we really don't have any hope.</font>

781
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:00,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long till we die of thirst?</font>

782
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:05,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just killing me that our water
is just right down there in that bag.</font>

783
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, with the drone.</font>

784
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could've used that to get help.</font>

785
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:15,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could have flown it back to our motel
with a good old fashioned note.</font>

786
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, maybe I can get it.</font>

787
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:26,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?
You said it was too smooth. No footholds.</font>

788
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but when I hung
my cell down yesterday,</font>

789
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think the rope
was long enough to reach it.</font>

790
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:35,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you serious?
- Yeah.</font>

791
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:39,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I seriously think I can get it.</font>

792
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunter, I don't think this is a good idea.</font>

793
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:52,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Becky, I don't think we have a choice.</font>

794
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every hour that passes, the weaker we get.</font>

795
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:00,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides...</font>

796
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe you'll get lucky and I'll fall.</font>

797
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:15,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunter.</font>

798
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:20,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be careful.</font>

799
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:24,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, Becks.</font>

800
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:27,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you.</font>

801
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

802
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:52,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>

803
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:53,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

804
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, all good.</font>

805
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:05,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

806
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:13,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

807
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:22,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunter, careful.</font>

808
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

809
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:28,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't quite reach it.</font>

810
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come back up. We'll attach it lower.
- Come on.</font>

811
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

812
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:39,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I can drop myself lower.</font>

813
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:41,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

814
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:43,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell are you doing, Hunter?</font>

815
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:45,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunter!</font>

816
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:54,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

817
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:05,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I think I can swing to it.
- Hunter, no!</font>

818
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:07,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunter! Come back up!</font>

819
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:09,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunter, no!</font>

820
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:10,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunter!</font>

821
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>

822
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:22,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

823
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:28,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there a way down?</font>

824
01:07:28,253 --> 01:07:31,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. The ladder ripped all the way off.</font>

825
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my god.
- Wait, Hunter.</font>

826
01:07:50,275 --> 01:07:52,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How are you gonna get back on the rope?</font>

827
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:57,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh.</font>

828
01:07:58,449 --> 01:07:59,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

829
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:03,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can... can you reach it?</font>

830
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:16,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> humpty dumpty sat on the wall <i></font>

831
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:19,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">oh, my god.</font>

832
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:22,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> humpty dumpty had a big fall... <i></font>

833
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:35,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

834
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:42,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You okay?
- Yeah.</font>

835
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:44,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have an idea.</font>

836
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:54,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

837
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:57,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna try to hook it on with this,</font>

838
01:08:57,675 --> 01:09:00,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then we're gonna
work together to pull me up.</font>

839
01:09:00,428 --> 01:09:02,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay?
- That's amazing.</font>

840
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:05,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's some good MacGyver shit
right there.</font>

841
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:35,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on. Please. Come on.</font>

842
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:40,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You did it!
- Okay.</font>

843
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:44,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. I'm gonna jump onto this.</font>

844
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:46,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna need your help to pull me up.</font>

845
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Get ready, Becks.</font>

846
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:49,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Okay.</font>

847
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:52,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

848
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:58,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, come on, come on.
Come on, you can do it.</font>

849
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:08,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

850
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:10,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunter, are you okay? You okay?</font>

851
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:16,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. I'm okay.</font>

852
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:18,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's do this fast and quick, Becky.</font>

853
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:19,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Work together to pull me up.</font>

854
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:23,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- I climb, you pull.</font>

855
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:27,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? Okay, now!</font>

856
01:10:56,878 --> 01:10:59,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can almost reach the ladder.</font>

857
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:05,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Almost there, Becks.</font>

858
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:13,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

859
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:47,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Becky! I landed on the bag!</font>

860
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my god... are you okay?</font>

861
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:53,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hurt my hands, real bad.
I don't think I can climb.</font>

862
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna have to pull me up, okay?</font>

863
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:56,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Okay.</font>

864
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:01,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you.</font>

865
01:12:38,938 --> 01:12:43,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit.</font>

866
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:45,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no. Are you okay?</font>

867
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:47,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit. I thought you died there.</font>

868
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:50,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not going anywhere, Becks.</font>

869
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:52,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that was scary.</font>

870
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We should ration it.
- Okay. You're right.</font>

871
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:06,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there any food in there?</font>

872
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:08,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's just your cherry lip balm.</font>

873
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:10,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think you can eat that.</font>

874
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:14,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, it's getting dark.
I think it's now or never on that drone.</font>

875
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:19,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess we need to...
We need to write a note.</font>

876
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:22,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, the receipt from the diner.</font>

877
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:25,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- A pen... do you have a pen?
- Eyeliner in here.</font>

878
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:28,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aren't you glad I brought up makeup now?</font>

879
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help.</font>

880
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:36,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stuck on top of 8-67 tower.
Call 911</font>

881
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:40,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">yeah, perfect.</font>

882
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:46,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. See that?</font>

883
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:49,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the road
where we almost got wiped out.</font>

884
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:51,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It leads to the motel.</font>

885
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:53,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's do this while we still have light.</font>

886
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:58,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

887
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:03,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, just keep it straight
and follow the line of the road.</font>

888
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:05,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let it drift down as it goes.
- Okay.</font>

889
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:21,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

890
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:23,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, we're almost past the gate.</font>

891
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:24,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my god.</font>

892
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, no, no. The battery.
- What?</font>

893
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:28,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's running out of juice.
- Oh, shit.</font>

894
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:31,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hit retrieve. Or has it gone too far?</font>

895
01:14:31,258 --> 01:14:33,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is it gonna make it?
- There's no chance!</font>

896
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:34,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you sure?
- It's not even at the gate.</font>

897
01:14:35,012 --> 01:14:36,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit. It's dropping.</font>

898
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:37,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hit retrieve, hit retrieve...
- Hunter.</font>

899
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hit retrieve.
- Okay.</font>

900
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:41,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's coming back.
- Fly it up.</font>

901
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:43,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give it the best shot to get back to us.</font>

902
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:45,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, just get it
higher, higher, higher.</font>

903
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:48,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Just get it higher!
- I'm trying.</font>

904
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:52,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We'll grab it when it gets close.
- Okay.</font>

905
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:57,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. We've got this.</font>

906
01:14:59,286 --> 01:15:00,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get it, Becks, get it.</font>

907
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice! Good job.</font>

908
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:21,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a charger,
but we don't have any power.</font>

909
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:24,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe just turn it off and once it's
rested, it will have more juice.</font>

910
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:27,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's never gonna be enough. Hunter.</font>

911
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:38,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are we gonna do?</font>

912
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:40,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, we're not gonna panic.</font>

913
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:43,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna stay calm.</font>

914
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:46,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna figure it out, okay?
There's gotta be a way.</font>

915
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:53,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are we gonna die?
- No.</font>

916
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:55,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we're gonna be okay.</font>

917
01:16:25,122 --> 01:16:26,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunter. Hunter...</font>

918
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:29,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you? Hunter...</font>

919
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:37,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunter...</font>

920
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:41,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunter, where are you?</font>

921
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:47,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunter. Hunter!</font>

922
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:51,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Becky, it's okay.</font>

923
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just had a bad dream.</font>

924
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:59,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're nice and safe,
2,000 feet up in the middle of nowhere.</font>

925
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:10,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have an idea.</font>

926
01:18:10,978 --> 01:18:12,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How to charge the drone.</font>

927
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:15,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your dumb life hack.</font>

928
01:18:16,775 --> 01:18:18,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Becky, you freakin' genius.</font>

929
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:28,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it's light enough now.
Let's do it.</font>

930
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:51,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, it's a standard bulb fitting,
but it's gonna be hot.</font>

931
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:53,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's 30 feet
but it's gonna feel like 1,000.</font>

932
01:18:57,816 --> 01:18:59,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is your leg okay?
- Yeah.</font>

933
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:02,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It smells, but it doesn't hurt
anymore. It's fine.</font>

934
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

935
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:12,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can do this.</font>

936
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:20,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah!
- Yeah.</font>

937
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep going, Becky.</font>

938
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:32,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got this, Becky.</font>

939
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:45,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can't.
- It's okay, it's okay.</font>

940
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:47,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't.</font>

941
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:49,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can do it, Becky.</font>

942
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:50,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got it.</font>

943
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:58,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. It's just like pole dancing.</font>

944
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:01,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um... okay, "cherry pie."</font>

1081
01:35:52,789 --> 01:35:55,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it! Fuck!</font>

1082
01:36:18,982 --> 01:36:21,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need energy.</font>

1083
01:36:21,526 --> 01:36:23,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should eat something.</font>

1084
01:36:27,573 --> 01:36:30,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Survival of the fittest.</font>

1085
01:37:06,612 --> 01:37:10,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can pad the cell better this time.</font>

1086
01:37:10,325 --> 01:37:11,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me your shoe.</font>

1087
01:38:30,696 --> 01:38:31,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hunter.</font>

1088
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:47,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, I love you.</font>

1089
01:39:20,538 --> 01:39:22,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

1090
01:39:22,623 --> 01:39:26,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry, but I really have
to make sure this gets through.</font>

1091
01:39:26,252 --> 01:39:28,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, god, I'm sorry.</font>

1092
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:48,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't park here.</font>

1093
01:40:48,793 --> 01:40:51,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Becky! Becky!</font>

1094
01:41:04,308 --> 01:41:06,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>

1095
01:41:06,435 --> 01:41:07,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>

1096
01:41:08,938 --> 01:41:10,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>

1097
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought that was you.</font>

1098
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:22,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, I love you. I'm so sorry.</font>

1099
01:41:24,078 --> 01:41:25,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

1100
01:41:27,873 --> 01:41:30,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just... I just want you to be okay.</font>

1101
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:37,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am, you know? I'm gonna be okay.</font>

1102
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:40,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really.</font>

1103
01:41:55,526 --> 01:41:57,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go home.</font>

1104
01:41:59,739 --> 01:42:02,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Life is fleeting.</font>

1105
01:42:02,116 --> 01:42:04,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Life is short.</font>

1106
01:42:05,911 --> 01:42:09,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you gotta use every moment.</font>

1107
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:12,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to do something
that makes you feel alive.</font>

1108
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:14,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that shit?</font>

1109
01:42:14,545 --> 01:42:18,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That would spread that message
far and wide.</font>
