00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,359
My motivations are entirely impure.

332
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:24,995
Doesn't make me wrong.

333
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:33,879
You told me yourself
I can't fight enemies within and without.

334
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:38,425
So when enemies without come knocking,
I need the city of Meereen behind me.

335
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,927
I have no choice.

336
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,304
Everyone has a choice.

337
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,348
Even slaves have a choice,

338
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,016
death or slavery.

339
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,477
So what else can I do, hmm?

340
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,939
Marry me instead.

341
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:58,070
Even if I wanted to do
such an inadvisable thing,

342
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,448
- I couldn't.
- Why not?

343
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,117
You are queen. You can do what you like.

344
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,331
No, I can't.

345
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,793
Then you are the only person in Meereen
who's not free.

346
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,683
And I know I'm here to serve my queen
and not give advice,

347
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,852
but can I make one more suggestion?

348
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,774
Of course.

349
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,405
On the day of the great games,

350
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:47,202
gather all the Great Masters and Wise Masters
and Worthy Masters you can find,

351
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,830
and slaughter them all.

352
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:57,004
I am a queen, not a butcher.

353
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,886
All rulers are either butchers or meat.

354
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,521
OLENNA: You there.

355
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:18,483
Where would I find
the High Septon, or High Sparrow,

356
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,652
or whatever bloody fool name he's got?

357
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,947
It's not as good a name as Queen of Thorns,
I'll admit.

358
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:30,162
You should have the decency
to stand when you speak to a lady.

359
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,497
You should have the decency
to kneel before the gods.

360
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,583
Don't spar with me, little fellow.

361
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,626
(GROANS)

362
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,422
For me, it's the knees.

363
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,632
- You?
- Hips.

364
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:44,176
Ah.

365
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:48,597
A man of the people. Is that your game?

366
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:52,476
It's an old game. Dull and unconvincing.

367
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,019
A man of the people

368
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,314
who does Cersei's dirty work for her.

369
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,359
The people always do the dirty work.

370
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:03,570
Spare me the homilies.
I can smell a fraud from a mile away.

371
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,030
Useful talent.

372
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,949
I'm here for my grandson and granddaughter.

373
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:12,829
Your grandson and granddaughter
swore sacred vows and lied.

374
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,124
The Father judges us all.

375
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,878
Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen.

376
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,548
If you break his laws, you will be punished.

377
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,551
Don't you walk away from me.

378
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,762
You don't give commands here.

379
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,263
What is it you want?

380
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,182
Gold?

381
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,394
I'll make you the richest septon
who ever lived.

382
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,603
(CHUCKLES)

383
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,230
What, then?

384
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:41,483
I imagine this is strange for you.

385
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:47,572
Everyone you meet has a hidden motive,
and you pride yourself on sniffing it out.

386
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,659
But I'm telling you a simple truth.

387
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,661
I serve the gods.

388
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:54,871
The gods demand justice.

389
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,457
How do they communicate their demands?

390
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,126
By raven or horse?

391
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:01,837
By the holy text, The Seven-Pointed Star.

392
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:05,966
If you don't have one in your library,
I'll give you my own.

393
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,552
I've read The Seven-Pointed Star.

394
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:12,973
Then you'll remember the passages
concerning buggery and perjury.

395
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,267
Your grandchildren will be punished

396
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:19,980
in the same manner
as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.

397
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:24,860
Half the men, women, and children
in this foul city break the sacred laws.

398
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:28,321
You live among murderers,
thieves, and rapists,

399
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:33,785
and yet you punish Loras
for shagging some perfumed ponce,

400
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,037
and Margaery for defending her brother?

401
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,539
Yes.

402
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:40,459
The gods' laws must be applied to all equally.

403
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,253
If it's equality you want, so be it.

404
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:47,299
When House Tyrell stops sending our crops
to the capital,

405
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:49,551
everyone here will starve.

406
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,637
And I'll make sure
the hungry know who's to blame.

407
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,139
(CHUCKLES)

408
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,518
Have you ever sowed the field?

409
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,355
Have you ever reaped the grain?

410
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:05,567
Has anyone in House Tyrell?

411
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,572
A lifetime of wealth and power
has left you blind in one eye.

412
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:13,950
You are the few,

413
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,703
we are the many.

414
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,917
And when the many stop fearing the few...

415
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:35,972
(DOG BARKING)

416
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,474
Lady Olenna.

417
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:53,323
CERSEI: Starving yourself won't make things
any better for her, my love.

418
00:33:56,535 --> 00:34:01,289
She's in a prison cell,
and there is nothing I can do.

419
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,545
I am the king!

420
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,798
The queen is in prison,
and there is nothing I can do!

421
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,189
No matter who you are,

422
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,734
no matter how strong you are, sooner or later,

423
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:32,404
you'll face circumstances
beyond your control.

424
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:37,158
Events you couldn't possibly have anticipated
or prevented, even if you had.

425
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,619
You cannot blame yourself for fate.

426
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:41,913
Your father,

427
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,541
your brother, your grandfather...

428
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,252
I was Queen of the Seven Kingdoms,
and what could I do?

429
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,838
Hold them as they left this world.

430
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,465
Kissed their heads after they'd gone.

431
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,926
I'll call in the army.

432
00:34:55,010 --> 00:35:00,557
I'll take back the sept,
and kill every last one of them.

433
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,811
I'll start a war if I have to.

434
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:08,315
You know as well as I do
who the first casualty of that war would be.

435
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,738
I love her.

436
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:19,743
I love her,

437
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,164
and I can't help her.

438
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:43,725
We must be strong for those we love.
We cannot give in to despair.

439
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,853
I will speak with the High Sparrow.

440
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,647
There must be something he...

441
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,523
Let me talk to him on your behalf.

442
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:54,903
The king cannot sully himself
negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.

443
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,323
You will try to help her?

444
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:01,826
I'll do everything I can
to win her freedom and her brother's.

445
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,537
Your happiness is all I want in this world.

446
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,290
I know.

447
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,125
No, you don't.

448
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,214
You can't possibly.

449
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,301
Not until you have children of your own.

450
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,054
I would do anything for you.

451
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,183
Anything to keep you from harm.

452
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,021
I would burn cities to the ground.

453
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,692
You are all that matters.

454
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,820
You

455
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,364
and your sister.

456
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,741
From the moment you came into this world.

457
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,285

00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:08,601
Prince Doran hopes this satisfies
your concerns about the princess' well-being.

461
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,985
You looked different when I left.

462
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,904
You had more hair.

463
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,489
And more hands.

464
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,827
- How's Trystane?
- He'll be all right.

465
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,911
I'm sorry for that.

466
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,538
It wasn't supposed to happen that way.

467
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:30,331
Why is it happening at all?

468
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,668
Your mother's worried about you.

469
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,256
Threats have been made.
Dorne's too dangerous for you.

470
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,675
- I've come to take you home.
- This is my home.

471
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:41,885
This has been my home for years.

472
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:45,764
I didn't want to come here, but she told me to.
I did what she said.

473
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,600
I did my duty,
and now she's forcing me to go back?

474
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,644
It's for your own good.
These are complicated matters.

475
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:53,980
No, it's not complicated at all. It's simple.

476
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:57,942
I love Trystane, I'm going to marry him,
and we're staying right here.

477
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,819
- I don't understand.
- Of course you don't.

478
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,446
You don't know me.

But what does it matter
For all men must die

We're lucky he's a singer.

If he were a fighter,
we might have been in trouble.

489

It's against my code to hurt a woman.

It's amazing how many men we beat
seem to have this code.

491
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,287
I wouldn't say you beat me.

492
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,081
How's your arm?

493
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,541
Wonderful.

494
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,002
Wouldn't feel right to leave Dorne
without a new scar.

495
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,213
(SCOFFS) You think you're leaving Dorne?

496
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,090
No great hurry.

497
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:05,093
Dornish women
are the most beautiful women in the world.

498
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:06,678
Thank you.

499
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,597
I said Dornish women. I didn't say you.

500
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,811
I'm not the most beautiful woman
you've ever seen?

501
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,315
BRONN: I've seen quite a few women
in all the Seven Kingdoms.

502
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,652
Name one more beautiful than I am.

503
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,281
Well, now,

504
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:31,411
in King's Landing,
there was an absolutely gorgeous...

505
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,125
There was a what?

506
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,796
In King's Landing, you were saying?

507
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,590
Was I?

508
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,635
There was a woman more beautiful than I am.

509
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,470
Was there?

510
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,973
My memory's not what it was earlier.

511
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:56,811
How's your arm now?

512
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,646
You seem concerned with it.

513
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:00,648
You must really like me.

514
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:01,900
(LAUGHS)

515
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,910
And how about your head?

516
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,541
My head.

517
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,752
My head?

518
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:24,505
You don't even want to know
what's going on in...

519
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,342
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

520
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,184
Your nose is bleeding.

521
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,190
It's nothing. It's the dry air.

522
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,947
My dagger was coated
with a special ointment from Asshai.

523
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,824
They call it the Long Farewell.

524
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,035
It takes time to work,

525
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:58,623
but if a single drop
makes contact with the skin,

526
00:40:58,706 --> 00:40:59,707
death.

527
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,051
The only antidote.

528
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,475
Who's the most
beautiful woman in the world?

529
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,228
(QUIETLY) You.

530
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,564
Sorry? Who?

531
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,068
You.

532
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,406
Don't drop it.

533
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,209
(GASPING)

534
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,171
I think you're very handsome as well.

535
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,594
- I'm sorry about the locale.
- No, you're not.

536
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,973
It felt like the safest place.

537
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,726
Not for your clientele, clearly.

538
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:44,812
It was an establishment like no other.

539
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,149
The sheer range of appetites catered to.

540
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:50,151
Desires that didn't even exist

541
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:52,653
until we invented them.

542
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:56,157
You've always been rather impressed
with yourself, haven't you?

543
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,160
The past is the past.

544
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:03,915
The future is all that's worth discussing.

545
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,043
The future of House Tyrell.

546
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,754
Don't pretend to have any concern
for my house,

547
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,547
my grandchildren, or me.

548
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:14,092
I should have known
you'd return to the capital

549
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:16,677
as soon as things started to go wrong.

550
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,971
- I promise you...
- I promise you, Lord Baelish,

551
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,890
that our fates are joined.

552
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,767
Together we murdered a king.

553
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,312
If my house should fall,
I will have nothing to hide.

554
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:33,653
And if I should meet with some accident here
at your broken little flesh market,

555
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,115
they'll never even find what's left of you.

556
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:39,700
So...

557
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,036
Do you deny a part in all this?

558
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,289
Cersei summoned me to King's Landing.

559
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,083
I dared not refuse her.

560
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,001
And what did she want?

561
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:51,712
A piece of information she knew that I had.

562
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:55,216
Neither silence nor lies were an option.

563
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:57,635
But I have other information

564
00:43:58,553 --> 00:43:59,929
of which she is unaware.

565
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,267
And as you say, our interests are aligned.

566
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:07,812
I have a gift for you.

567
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,772
What kind of gift?

568
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:11,774
The same kind I gave Cersei.

569
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:14,986
A handsome young man.

570
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:33,713
YEZZAN: Many worthy fighters have died
trying to make it to the great games.

571
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:37,383
When most of you worthless scum
join them in death this afternoon,

572
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:40,386
it will represent a significant rise
in your station.

573
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:43,639
But if you do happen to triumph here,

574
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:47,977
you will fight at the Great Pit of Daznak itself,
in front of the queen.

575
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,939
So whatever happens,
the gods have smiled upon you today.

576
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,777
This is the day your lives
actually start to mean something.

577
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,324
You and you. You.

578
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,535
You two.

579
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,331
You, you, and you.

Prepare yourselves.

583
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,187
Sitting through the great games
will be bad enough.

584
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:34,148
For generations,
in the days leading up to the great games,

585
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:37,652
it has been customary for our ruler
to make the rounds of the lower pits

586
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,029
to pay the fighters there
the honor of her presence.

You're not thinking clearly.

00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:51,859
I'm afraid I must.
My son needs me now more than ever.

655
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,486
Get out, you hateful bitch!

661
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,657
Thank you, Boake.

662
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,582
- You saw her?
- Yes.

663
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:51,293
- And?
- Her accommodations seem sufficient.

664
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:52,544
What happens to her now?

665
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:57,424
Well, she and her brother are both being held
under fair suspicion.

666
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:03,430
A trial will be held for each of them
to determine if they're guilty of any acts

667
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:07,226
that might constitute
a violation of the tenets of the faith.

668

Who will stand judge?

669
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:13,357
Seven septons, as it was in all trials
before the Targaryens.

670
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:15,901
Will you be one of them?

671
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:17,945
I will.

672
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:24,368
If one or both of them were to
confess before the trial...

673
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,203
Then they will be shown the Mother's mercy.

674
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,456
And what does the Mother's mercy entail?

675
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,418
It depends upon the situation.

676
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,713
The acts themselves, the degree of contrition.

677
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:37,631
Thank you, High Septon,

678
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:41,176
for bringing them
whatever justice they deserve

679
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:43,846
in the eyes of the Seven.

680
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,228
Did you know this chapel is
one of the oldest structures

681
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,438
in King's Landing?

682
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:56,024
I think I may have heard at one point.

683
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,777
Baelor built his sept around it.

684
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:03,240
But men worshipped here long before him.

685
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:06,076
Who carved this altar?

686
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,996
- Do you know?
- I'm afraid I don't.

687
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:11,790
No one does.

688
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:16,003
There's no name on it,
or anywhere else in the chapel.

689
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,382
No, the people who built this place

690
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:24,344
didn't inflict their vanity
on those who came after them,

691
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:28,891
the way Baelor did
with that great gilded monstrosity up there.

692
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:29,975
Hmm.

693
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,144
Their faith was clean.

694
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:36,523
Strip away the gold and the ornaments,

695
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,568
knock down the statues and the pillars,

696
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,154
and this is what remains.

697
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,618
Something simple,

698

solid, and true.

699
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:02,466
The Tyrells' finery will be stripped away.

700
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:08,055
Their lies knocked down.
Their true hearts laid bare for all to see.

701
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:11,809
And so it will be for all of us.

702
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:14,853
High and low alike.

703
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:20,901
What will we find

704
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,238
when we strip away your finery?

705
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:30,494
A young man came to us not long ago,

706
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,664
broken in body and spirit.

707
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,418
He had so much to strip away.

708
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:42,256
So much weighing him down.

709
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:47,261
But piece by piece, he unburdened himself.

710
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,264
Let go of vanity,

711
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:53,016
pride, sin.

712
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:57,688
Now his soul is so light,

713
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:01,650
he will float through
the seven heavens like a bird.

714
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,026
Hmm.

715
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:10,909
And he has much to say about you.

You will order her to let me go.

Let me go!

...your filthy hands off me!
Are you out of your mind?

I am the queen! Let me go!

726
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:07,341
Look at me.

727
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,553
Look at my face.

728

It's the last thing you'll see before you die.
