1
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:10,504
Eleven.

2
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,548
Mike.

3
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:17,719
Is that...

4
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,351
I never gave up on you.

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,313
I called you every night.
Every night for...

6
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,860
353 days.

7
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:32,943
I heard.

8
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,400
Why didn't you tell me you were there?

9
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,854
- That you were okay?
- Because I wouldn't let her.

10
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,791
- The hell is this? Where you been?
- Where have you been?

11
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:46,753
You've been hiding her.

12
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,502
- You've been hiding her this whole time!
- Hey!

13
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:52,584
Let's talk.

14
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:54,593
Alone.

15
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:03,265
- Protecting her! Protecting her?
- Listen. Listen to me.

16
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,642
The more people know about her,
the more danger she's in.

17
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,940
And the more danger
you and your family are in...

18
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,312
So I should be thanking you?

19
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,987
I'm not asking you to thank me!
I'm asking you to try to understand.

20
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,405
I don't! I don't understand!

21
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,325
That's fine. That's fine!
Just do not blame her!

22
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,277
All right? She's upset enough as it is.

23
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,738
I don't blame her! I blame you!
I blame you!

24
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,040
That's okay, kid. That's okay.

25
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,243
No! Nothing about this is okay!

26
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,874
- Nothing about this is okay!
- Oh, jeez...

27
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:30,626
You're a stupid, disgusting,

28
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,652
- lying piece of shit!
- Okay. All right! Stop it.

29
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,588
- Liar! Liar! Liar!
- Stop it. It's okay.

30
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:37,261
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Liar! Liar!

31
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:45,015
You're okay, kid. You're okay.

32
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,310
I'm sorry, kid.

33
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,775
- We missed you.
- I missed you, too.

34
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,948
We talked about you
pretty much every day.

35
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,412
Teeth.

36
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,160
- What?
- You have teeth.

37
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:09,662
Oh. You like these pearls?

38
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,374
Eleven?

39
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,509
Hey. Um, I'm Max.

40
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:17,927
I've heard a lot about you.

41
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,260
Hey. Hey, sweetheart.

42
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,520
Hey.

43
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,017
Can I see him?

44
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,499
He's not doing well.

45
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,954
I know.

46
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,336
I saw.

47
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,881
What else did you see?

48
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,937
You opened this gate before, right?

49
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,112
Yes.

50
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,410
Do you think if we got you back there,
that you could close it?

51
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,937
Ted! Would you please get that?

52
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,411
Ted!

53
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,870
Hold on, please.

54
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,461
- Oh. Hi.
- Hi.

55
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,181
I, uh, didn't realize Nancy had a sister.

56
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,519
What's so funny?

57
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,515
I'm Nancy's mother.

58
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,392
- No.
- Yes.

59
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,223
Mrs. Wheeler.

60
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,400
Um, I'm sorry, and you are?

61
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,229
Billy. Billy Hargrove.

62
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,485
You must be here for Nancy.

63
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,444
Nancy? No, no, no. Not my type. Uh...

64
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:14,577
No, actually,
I am looking for my little sister Max.

65
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,282
Goes by Maxine.

66
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,414
She's been missing all day,
and, uh, to be honest with you,

67
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,417
- I've been worried sick, you know, so...
- Oh.

68
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:26,547
I thought she was at Lucas', but
Mrs. Sinclair said your house is the...

69
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,384
the designated hangout, so, you know...

70
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,095
Here I am.

71
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,688
Their driveway is pretty dark
this time of night.

72
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,062
So drive slowly.

73
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,269
Always.

74
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,946
And when you see Mike,
tell him to come home already, okay?

75
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,820
You're a real lifesaver, you know that?

76
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:52,953
Anytime.

77
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,933
It's not like it was before. It's grown.

78
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:26,394
A lot. And, I mean,
that's considering we can get in there.

79
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,229
The place is crawling with those dogs.

80
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:29,188
Demo-dogs.

81
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:33,993
- I'm sorry, what?
- I said, uh, Demo-dogs.

82
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,570
Like Demogorgon and dogs.

83
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,584
You put them together,
it sounds pretty badass...

84
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:38,946
How is this important right now?

85
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,332
It's not. I'm sorry.

86
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,418
I can do it.

87
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,456
You're not hearing me.

88
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,879
I'm hearing you. I can do it.

89
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,333
Even if El can,
there's still another problem.

90
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,306
- If the brain dies, the body dies.
- I thought that was the whole point.

91
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,009
It is,
but if we're really right about this...

92
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:57,137
I mean, if El closes the gate
and kills the mind flayer's army...

93
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,638
Will's a part of that army.

94
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,310
Closing the gate will kill him.

95
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,194
- He likes it cold.
- What?

96
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,239
It's what Will kept saying to me.

97
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,749
He likes it cold.

98
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,003
We keep giving it what it wants.

99
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:30,800
If this is a virus,
and Will's the host, then...

100
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,877
Then we need
to make the host uninhabitable.

101
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,463
So if he likes it cold...

102
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:36,923
We need to burn it out of him.

103
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,134
We have to do it somewhere
he doesn't know this time.

104
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,559
Yeah, somewhere far away.

105
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:47,145
Take Denfield,
then you'll see a large oak tree.

106
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,603
You're gonna swing a right.
That road is gonna dead-end.

107
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,030
And it's about a five-minute walk
from there.

108
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:56,905
Okay. Denfield to oak tree.
Swing a right.

109
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,157
That's it. But it's channel ten, right?

110
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,909
It's channel ten. Listen...

111
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,742
You let me know
when that thing is out of him.

112
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,378
You should go with him.

113
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,089
- What?
- With Jonathan.

114
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,935
- No, I'm...
- I'm not just gonna leave Mike.

115
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,346
No one's leaving anyone.

116
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:32,069
I may be a pretty shitty boyfriend,
but...

117
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,778
turns out I'm actually
a pretty damn good babysitter.

118
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,701
Steve...

119
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:48,036
It's okay, Nance.

120
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,423
It's okay.

121
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,717
I...

122
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,764
Just be careful, okay?
I can't lose you again.

123
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,563
You won't lose me.

124
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,403
Do you promise?

125
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:15,656
Promise.

126
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,204
El... Come on, let's go. It's time.

127
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,210
Okay.

128
00:10:28,234 --> 00:10:30,234
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

129
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,798
So, what, we're just
not gonna talk about it, huh?

130
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,509
About what?

131
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,610
Oh, I don't know.
I'm just curious, you know,

132
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,348
why all of a sudden
you look like some kind of MTV punk.

133
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,733
I'm not mad, kid. I just want to know
where you've been.

134
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:37,613
That's all.

135
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,027
To see Mama.

136
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,153
Okay.

137
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,657
- How'd you get there?
- A truck.

138
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:51,788
A truck?

139
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,414
A big truck.

140
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,960
A big truck? Whose truck was it?

141
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,882
- A man's.
- A man's?

142
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,421
A nice man.

143
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,718
Okay. So let me just
get this straight in my head.

144
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,016
So a nice man in a big truck,

145
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,139
he drove you to your mama's,
and then what?

146
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,018
Your Aunt Becky gave you
those clothes and that makeup?

147
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,483
I...

148
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,609
I shouldn't have left.

149
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,106
Mmm-mmm.

150
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:23,909
No.

151
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,699
No, this isn't on you, kid.
I should've been there.

152
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,159
I should never have lied to you
about your mom.

153
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,495
Or about when you could leave.

154
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,497
A lot of things I shouldn't have done.

155
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,339
Sometimes I feel like I'm...

156
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,719
Like I'm just some kind of black hole
or something.

157
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:52,929
A black hole?

158
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,732
Yeah, it's a...
You know, it's this thing in outer space.

159
00:12:56,818 --> 00:13:00,562
It's like, it sucks everything towards it
and destroys it.

160
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,610
Sarah had a picture book
about outer space. She loved it.

161
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,737
Who's Sarah?

162
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,328
Sarah?

163
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,203
Sarah's my girl.

164
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,874
She's my little girl.

165
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,382
Where is she?

166
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:27,092
Well, that's kind of the thing, kid.
She, uh...

167
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,099
She left us.

168
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,854
- Gone.
- Yeah.

169
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:39,275
The black hole. It got her.

170
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,529
And somehow...

171
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,613
I've just been scared, you know?

172
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:52,075
I've just been scared
that it would take you, too.

173
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,785
I think that's why I get...

174
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,455
so mad.

175
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:01,956
I'm so sorry.

176
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,841
For everything.

177
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,799
I could be so... so...

178
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,133
Stupid?

179
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,435
Yeah. Stupid.

180
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,355
Just really stupid.

181
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,029
I've been stupid, too.

182
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,694
I guess we broke our rule.

183
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,953
I don't hate it, by the way.

184
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,250
This whole...

185
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,879
look.

186
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,456
It's kinda cool.

187
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,254
Bitchin'.

188
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,088
Okay. Sure.

189
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,725
Bitchin'.

190
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,424
All right.

191
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,839
It should fit now.

192
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:31,721
Is this really necessary?

193
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:34,890
Yes, it is, okay? This is
a ground-breaking scientific discovery.

194
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,310
We can't just bury it like
some common mammal, okay? It's not a dog.

195
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,137
All right, all right, all right.

196
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,974
But you're explaining this to Mrs. Byers,
all right?

197
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,109
Christ. Help me out.

198
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,232
- What am I supposed to do?
- Get the door, man.

199
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,904
All right, I got the door.

200
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,324
- Ew. Jesus...
- God...

201
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:56,913
Phew!

202
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,500
Mike, would you just stop already?

203
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,130
You weren't in there, okay, Lucas?

204
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,553
That lab is swarming
with hundreds of those dogs.

205
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,799
- Demo-dogs!
- The chief will take care of her.

206
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,091
Like she needs protection.

207
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,972
Listen, dude,
a coach calls a play in a game,

208
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,643
bottom line, you execute it. All right?

209
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,938
Okay, first of all,
this isn't some stupid sports game.

210
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,607
And second, we're not even in the game.
We're on the bench.

211
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,060
So my point is...

212
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,778
Right, yeah, we're on the bench,
so, uh, there's nothing we can do.

213
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,076
That's not entirely true.

214
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:39,326
I mean, these Demo-dogs,
they have a hive mind.

215
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,702
When they ran away from the bus,
they were called away.

216
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,396
- If we get their attention...
- Maybe we can draw them from the lab.

217
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,786
Clear a path to the gate.

218
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,212
Yeah, and then we all die.

219
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,298
That's one point of view.

220
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,419
No, that's not a point of view, man.
That's a fact.

221
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,842
I got it!

222
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:56,172
This is where the chief dug his hole.
This is our way into the tunnel. So...

223
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,473
Here, right here. This is like a hub.

224
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,425
So you got all the tunnels
feeding in here.

225
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,056
Maybe if we set this on fire...

226
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,182
Oh, yeah? That's a no.

227
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,959
- The mind flayer would call away his army.
- They'd all come to stop us.

228
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,211
- We circle back to the exit.
- Guys.

229
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,171
- By the time they realize we're gone...
- El would be at the gate.

230
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:12,609
Hey. Hey! Hey! This is not happening.

231
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,759
- But...
- No, no, no, no, no.

232
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,695
No buts. I promised
I'd keep you shitheads safe,

233
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,242
and that's exactly what I plan on.

234
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,194
We're staying here. On the bench.

235
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,496
And we're waiting for the starting team
to do their job.

236
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,622
Does everybody understand?

237
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,329
This isn't a stupid sports game.

238
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,410
I said does everybody understand that?

239
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:28,879
I need a yes.

240
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:38,426
It's my brother.

241
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,930
He can't know I'm here.
He'll kill me. He'll kill us.

242
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:00,119
Am I dreaming, or is that you, Harrington?

243
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,820
Yeah, it's me. Don't cream your pants.

244
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,415
What are you doing here, <i>amigo?</i>

245
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,955
I could ask you the same thing.

246
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,879
<i>Amigo.</i>

247
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:14,375
Looking for my stepsister.
A little birdie told me she was here.

248
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,130
Huh, that's weird. I don't know her.

249
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,008
Small? Redhead? Bit of a bitch.

250
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,464
Doesn't ring a bell. Sorry, buddy.

251
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,389
You know, I don't know, this...

252
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,597
This whole situation,
Harrington, I don't know.

253
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,635
It's giving me the heebie-jeebies.

254
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:31,900
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

255
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:36,484
My 13-year-old sister goes missing
all day.

256
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:40,363
And then I find her with you
in a stranger's house.

257
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,362
And you lie to me about it.

258
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,659
Man, were you dropped too much
as a child, or what?

259
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:52,296
I don't know what you don't understand
about what I just said.

260
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,465
She's not here.

261
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,918
Then who is that?

262
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,839
Shit! Did he see us?

263
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,594
Oh, shit. Listen...

264
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,475
I told you to plant your feet.

265
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,187
Well, well, well.

266
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,187
Lucas Sinclair. What a surprise.

267
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,483
I thought I told you
to stay away from him, Max.

268
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,442
- Billy, go away.
- You disobeyed me.

269
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,320
And you know what happens
when you disobey me.

270
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,656
- Billy...
- I break things.

271
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,334
Billy! Stop! Billy! Stop!

272
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,422
Get off of me, you...

273
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,794
Since Maxine won't listen to me,
maybe you will.

274
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,667
You stay away from her.

275
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:42,220
Stay away from her! You hear me?

276
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,465
I said get off me!

277
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,599
So dead, Sinclair! You're dead.

278
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,139
No. You are.

279
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,524
Steve!

280
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,439
Looks like you got some fire in you
after all, huh?

281
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,365
I've been waiting to meet this King Steve

282
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,660
everybody's been telling me so much about.

283
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,539
Get out.

284
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,583
- Yes! Kick his ass, Steve!
- Get him!

285
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,460
Murder the son of a bitch!

286
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,507
- Now! Now!
- Get that shithead!

287
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,505
Kill the son of a bitch!

288
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,795
- Steve!
- Billy!

289
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,180
Holy shit!

290
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,966
Shit!

291
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,644
No one tells me what to do!

292
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,395
Whoo! Get up!

293
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,445
You're gonna kill him.

294
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,767
The hell is this?

295
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,944
You little shit,
what did you do?

296
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:23,442
What did you do?

297
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,278
Shit.

298
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:37,085
From here on out, you leave me
and my friends alone. Do you understand?

299
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,912
Screw you.

300
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:46,966
Say you understand! Say it! Say it!

301
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,890
I understand.

302
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,216
- What?
- I understand.

303
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,324
Let's get out of here.

304
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,191
It's actually kinda nice.

305
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,068
We'll do it here.

306
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,132
Are you sure this is a good idea?

307
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,010
This thing has had Will long enough.

308
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,516
Let's kill the son of a bitch.

309
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,016
Papa!

310
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:16,824
All right. You let me do the heavy lifting
up front, all right?

311
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:18,997
You save your strength till we're below.

312
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,460
You okay?

313
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,363
Nancy?

314
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,415
No, don't touch it.

315
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,703
Hey, buddy...

316
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,130
It's okay. You put up a good fight.

317
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,957
He kicked your ass,
but you put up a fight.

318
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,258
You're okay.

319
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,007
Okay, you're gonna keep straight
for a half a mile,

320
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,009
then make a left on Mount Sinai.

321
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:19,804
What's going on?

322
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:22,226
Oh, my God!

323
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,644
Just relax. She's driven before.

324
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,291
- Yeah, in a parking lot.
- That counts.

325
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,647
They were gonna leave you behind.

326
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:27,850
Oh, my God.

327
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,559
I promised that you'd be cool, okay?

328
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,690
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on?

329
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:37,197
Oh, my God. No! Whoa!
Stop the car. Slow down.

330
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,198
- I told you he'd freak out.
- Stop the car!

331
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,780
Everybody shut up! I'm trying to focus!

332
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,554
Oh, wait, that's Mount Sinai. Make a left.

333
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:44,995
- What?
- Make a left.

334
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:05,429
What's happening?

335
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,597
It hurts.

336
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:13,858
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

337
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,148
Let me go! Let me go! It hurts!

338
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:23,325
It hurts! Let me go! Let me go! It hurts!

339
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,125
- Mom.
- No!

340
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,959
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

341
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,226
Hello!

342
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,269
- Whoa!
- Incredible.

343
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,348
I told you. Zoomer.

344
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:58,741
Guys.

345
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,994
Oh, no. Guys.

346
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,623
Hey, where do you think you're going?

347
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,167
What are you, deaf? Hello?

348
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:13,122
We are not going down there right now.
I made myself clear.

349
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,958
Hey, there's no chance
we're going to that hole, all right?

350
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,259
This ends right now!

351
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,211
Steve, you're upset, I get it.

352
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,924
But the bottom line is,
a party member requires assistance,

353
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,885
and it is our duty
to provide that assistance.

354
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,517
Now, I know you promised Nance
that you would keep us safe.

355
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,307
So, keep us safe.

356
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,567
Holy shit.

357
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,160
Yeah,
I'm pretty sure it's this way.

358
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,333
You're pretty sure,
or you're certain?

359
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:53,287
I'm 100% sure.
Just follow me and you'll know.

360
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,123
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I don't think so.

361
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,047
What?

362
00:27:57,134 --> 00:28:01,378
Any of you little shits die down here,
I'm getting the blame. Got it, dipshit?

363
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:04,635
From here on out, I'm leading the way.
Come on, let's go.

364
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,351
Come on.

365
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,803
Hey, a little hustle.

366
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,586
Stay here.

367
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,841
Oh, shit.

368
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,306
Hey, Doc.

369
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,977
Those suckers
got you pretty good, huh?

370
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:00,816
It's okay, don't talk.

371
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:04,899
Don't talk. I got you.
I got you. I got you.

372
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:11,531
Oh, yeah, I've been meaning to tell you.

373
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:16,290
This is Eleven. Eleven, Doc Owens.
Doc Owens, Eleven.

374
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,915
She's been staying with me
for about a year

375
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,376
and she's about to save our asses.

376
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,216
Maybe when this is all said and done,

377
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,844
maybe you could help her out, too,
you know?

378
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:32,435
Maybe you could help her lead,
like, a normal life.

379
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:35,935
One where she's not poked
and prodded and...

380
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,900
treated like some kind of lab rat,
you know?

381
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:40,735
I don't know, just a thought.

382
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,357
But, uh... think about it.

383
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,326
Don't go anywhere.

384
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,848
God.

385
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,301
What is this place?

386
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,682
Guys, come on. Keep moving.

387
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:23,903
What the hell?

388
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:30,155
Shit!

389
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,414
- Help! Help! Help!
- Dustin.

390
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,581
Shit!

391
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,375
- Dustin!
- Dustin!

392
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:39,578
What happened?

393
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,914
It's in my mouth!
Some got on my mouth! Shit!

394
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,801
I'm okay.

395
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:57,308
- You serious?
- Very funny, man.

396
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,389
- Nice. Very nice.
- Jesus, what an idiot.

397
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,149
Hang on. Wait, wait.

398
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,527
All right, Wheeler.

399
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,492
I think we found your hub.

400
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:29,970
Drench it.

401
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:56,204
It's not working. It's not working.
Mom, are you listening to me?

402
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,155
- Just wait!
- How much longer?

403
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,286
Look... look at him!

404
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,895
- Jonathan, wait!
- You're killing him!

405
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,205
Just wait!

406
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,704
- No!
- No, leave it!

407
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:05,900
- You're killing him!
- Leave it!

408
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,793
Wait, Jonathan, Jonathan!
His neck! His neck!

409
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,016
No, no, no, no.

410
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,505
Stay here.

411
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,786
- You ready?
- Yeah.

412
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,096
- Ready.
- Ready.

413
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,100
Light her up.

414
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:49,271
I am in such deep shit.

415
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:12,258
All right.

416
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,763
Get the hell out of my son!

417
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,992
Go, go, go!

418
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:50,954
Let's go, let's go!

419
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,163
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

420
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,614
Will, baby.

421
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,578
Will. Will.

422
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,456
- Please, Will. Will.
- Come on, buddy.

423
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,253
- Please. Can you hear me?
- Come on.

424
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,252
- Come on.
- Please. Will.

425
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,379
Mom?

426
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,591
Oh, honey. Oh, God.

427
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,368
<i>Chief, are you there?
Chief, do you copy?</i>

428
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:09,323
Yeah, I copy.

429
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:12,000
Close it.

430
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,533
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

431
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:57,296
Hey, this way!

432
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:04,591
Help! Help! Help! Help!

433
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,645
Help! Help!

434
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:00,727
- Hold on!
- Steve, pull him out.

435
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,356
Everybody back! Back!

436
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:10,055
- You good?
- You okay?

437
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,363
Guys, we gotta go!

438
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,123
Dart.

439
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:23,791
Shh. Stop.

440
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:26,343
- Dustin, get back.
- Trust me, please.

441
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:35,474
Hey. It's me, it's me.
It's just your friend, it's Dustin.

442
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,350
It's Dustin, all right?

443
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,273
You remember me?

444
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,193
Will you let us pass?

445
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:49,738
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about the storm cellar.

446
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,865
That was a pretty douchey thing to do.

447
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,785
You hungry? Yeah?

448
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,144
- He's insane.
- Don't.

449
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:57,999
Shut up.

450
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:02,330
I've got our favorite. See? Nougat.

451
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:10,296
Look at that. Yummy. Here, all right?

452
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,883
Eat up, buddy. Come on. Come on.

453
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,058
Let's go.

454
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,138
There's plenty. I've got more.

455
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:34,657
Goodbye, buddy.

456
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,790
Let's go, let's go!

457
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,728
<i>I want you to find something
from your past,</i>

458
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,099
something that angers you.

459
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,396
Now channel it.

460
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:03,853
Papa!

461
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:20,584
Jesus!

462
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:23,921
What was that?

463
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:27,957
They're coming.

464
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:29,590
Run! Run!

465
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,542
Let's go! Let's go!

466
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:32,378
Come on, Mike!
Move, Mike!

467
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,924
- There, there!
- Come on! Let's go.

468
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:38,475
Go, go, go! Let's go!
Come on! Come on!

469
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,561
Come on!

470
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:41,262
Come on, hurry up! Come on!

471
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,228
Come on, come on, come on!

472
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,981
Lucas, come on.
Reach for my hand.

473
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:51,981
Come on. Pull him.

474
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,284
Oh, shit.

475
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,738
Here.

476
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,198
Dustin! Come on!

477
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:03,794
No!

478
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,375
This is...

479
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:18,976
Eleven.

480
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:50,710
Oh, shit!

481
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,363
You have a wound, Eleven.

482
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,242
A terrible wound.

483
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,403
The gate, I opened it.

484
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:25,415
<i>- And it's festering.
- I'm the monster.</i>

485
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,335
And it will grow.

486
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:32,418
Spread.

487
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,624
Papa!

488
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:39,880
And eventually, it will kill you.

489
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,350
Jane!

490
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,176
You did good, kid.

491
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,263
You did so good.

492
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,530
<i>Since the release
of the incendiary tape,</i>

493
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:09,079
<i>the once quiet town of Hawkins, Indiana,</i>

494
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:11,873
<i>has spent time in a place
it never expected.</i>

495
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,325
<i>The national spotlight.</i>

496
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:17,709
<i>Under mounting pressure,
several high-ranking members</i>

497
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:19,164
<i>from the U.S. Department of Energy</i>

498
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:22,626
<i>have admitted involvement
in the death and cover-up</i>

499
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,838
<i>of Hawkins resident Barbara Holland
who died due to exposure</i>

500
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:28,595
<i>to an experimental chemical asphyxiant,</i>

501
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:31,017
<i>which had leaked
from the grounds of the lab.</i>

502
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:34,892
<i>We sent our own April Kline to Hawkins
to speak to residents,</i>

503
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:38,771
<i>residents who told us
they thought they lived in a safe town.</i>

504
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:42,696
<i>The kind of town where,
they say, nothing ever happens.</i>

505
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:56,619
Chief-o.

506
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,829
- How's the leg?
- Better.

507
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:00,835
Pretty sure my football career is over.

508
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,962
Want some? No way I'm gonna finish it.

509
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:06,010
No. I'm, uh... on a diet.

510
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,384
Well, you're a better man than me.

511
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,057
Hey, got a little something for you.

512
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:22,737
I thought...

513
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,191
Sometimes I impress even myself.

514
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:27,407
Still, I'd let things cool off
for a while, if I were you.

515
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,610
How long is a while?

516
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:31,856
Want to be safe? I give it a year.

517
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:32,914
A year?

518
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:39,379
What about one night out?

519
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,499
One night?

520
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,876
Yeah. How risky would that be?

521
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,754
What's so important about one night?

522
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:04,315
Yeah, you got it. See?

523
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:05,771
Mom!

524
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,698
Wow!

525
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,582
Do you always
have to be filming everything?

526
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,081
No, no. Just the good stuff.

527
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,288
Are you sure people still dance like this?

528
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,338
Yeah. It's just what's happening.

529
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:25,586
Is it what's happening?

530
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,588
Yeah, yeah, it's what's happening.

531
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:33,890
Oh, wait.

532
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,183
All right, that's enough.

533
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,636
- One more, okay? Just one more.
- Why?

534
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:39,517
- You look so handsome.
- Mom!

535
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:40,607
Mike.

536
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:52,535
We should, you know, get out there,
like, do our thing... Stop.

537
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:04,250
Yeah, I love it.
But not as much as I love you, Lukey.

538
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,627
Get out of my room!

539
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,879
Ow, ow. That hurts.

540
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,801
It's gonna be worth it. Promise.

541
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,272
Where did you see it last?

542
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:28,479
Right here, where I put it.

543
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,734
What's in there
that's so important anyway?

544
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,112
You look fabulous, baby.

545
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,283
That's your ride. Dusty!

546
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:48,461
Okay.

547
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,225
All right, buddy, here we are.

548
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,940
So, remember, once you get in there...

549
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,234
Pretend like I don't care.

550
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:09,565
- You don't care.
- I don't care.

551
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,988
There you go. You're learning, my friend.
You're learning.

552
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:14,524
- Hey.
- What?

553
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:18,237
Come on. You look great, okay?
You look... You look great.

554
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,947
- Okay? Now you're gonna go in there...
- Yeah.

555
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,782
- Look like a million bucks.
- Yeah.

556
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:24,163
And you're gonna slay 'em dead.

557
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:25,744
Like a lion.

558
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:29,873
Don't do that, okay?

559
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,128
Okay.

560
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:33,885
Good luck.

561
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:50,902
- Looking very snazzy tonight, sir.
- Thank you, my lord.

562
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,277
- Hey, Nance.
- Hey.

563
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,819
- What's in this?
- Pure fuel.

564
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,458
Holy shit. What happened to you?

565
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:58,511
- What do you mean, "What happened"?
- What?

566
00:50:58,597 --> 00:50:59,428
- Dude.
- Your hair.

567
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:00,972
Is there a bird nesting in there?

568
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,640
What do you mean, "What's wrong"?

569
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,139
There's no bird nesting in here, asshole.
Okay?

570
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:06,310
I worked hard.

571
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:15,697
Max...

572
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:17,985
Hey.

573
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,153
Um, it's nice, right?

574
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:21,530
You want to, um...

575
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,820
You want to, like... You know?

576
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,702
Like, just you and me?

577
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,492
Are you trying
to ask me to dance, stalker?

578
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:31,954
No, of course not.

579
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:34,415
Unless you want to.

580
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,249
So smooth. Come on.

581
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:49,809
Hey, Zombie Boy.

582
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:51,482
Do you want to dance?

583
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:53,433
Um... I don't...

584
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:57,070
- I mean... I mean, yeah. Sure.
- Cool.

585
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:24,468
Wish me luck, Mike.
I'm going in.

586
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,228
- Stacy.
- He just broke up with Jennifer.

587
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:37,231
- Plus he's, like, not my type.
- Stacy.

588
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:40,948
Yeah?

589
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:44,786
Shall we?

590
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,576
Um, no, thanks.

591
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:02,878
Oh, my God.

592
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:43,468
- Hey.
- Hey.

593
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:47,305
- Wanna dance?
- What?

594
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:49,507
Come on. Let's go.

595
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:00,735
Here. Mmm-hmm.

596
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:02,989
Closer.

597
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,067
A little closer. Okay.

598
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:10,661
Now feel the music.

599
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:12,364
The rhythm.

600
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:15,166
Start to move to it.

601
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,039
Yeah. There.

602
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:18,620
- Good?
- That's good. Yeah.

603
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:19,795
Okay.

604
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:23,216
You know,
out of all of my brother's friends,

605
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:24,886
you're my favorite.

606
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,550
- You've always been my favorite.
- Really?

607
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,640
Yeah.

608
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:37,851
Girls this age are dumb.

609
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:41,525
But give them a few years,
and they'll wise up.

610
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:45,317
And, uh, you're gonna drive them nuts.

611
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:48,775
- You think so?
- Oh, I know so.

612
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:05,550
- Hey.
- Hey.

613
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,420
Thought I might find you out here.

614
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:12,883
Will wanted me to give him
some space, so...

615
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:15,180
I'm giving him a few feet.

616
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:18,646
What do you say?

617
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:24,903
I'm pretty sure that Mr. Cooper retired
in the '70s, so...

618
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:28,152
we might be okay.

619
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,544
How are you holding up?

620
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,129
- You know.
- Yeah.

621
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,382
That feeling never goes away.

622
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,094
It is true what they say, you know.

623
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,427
Every day it does get a little easier.

624
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:47,818
You look beautiful.

625
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:52,024
Do you wanna dance?

626
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:56,369
I don't know how.

627
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:58,033
I don't either.

628
00:56:58,457 --> 00:56:59,948
Do you want to figure it out?

629
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:10,587
Like this.

630
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:12,840
Yeah, like that.

631
00:57:12,864 --> 00:57:20,864
