1
00:00:01,284 --> 00:00:03,493
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,714
For 5 years, I was stranded

3
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:08,215
on an island
with only one goal...

4
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:10,018
survive.

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,453
Oliver Queen is alive.

6
00:00:11,454 --> 00:00:14,155
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish...

7
00:00:14,396 --> 00:00:16,596
To use the list
of names he left me

8
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:20,628
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

9
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:24,498
To do this, I must
become someone else.

10
00:00:24,499 --> 00:00:28,835
I must become...
something else.

11
00:00:29,137 --> 00:00:31,137
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

12
00:00:32,973 --> 00:00:35,609
The company Mrs. Queen
invested in doesn't exist.

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,545
Tempest purchased a
warehouse in Starling City.

14
00:00:39,546 --> 00:00:42,182
I could never really tell if the
playboy thing was all an act,

15
00:00:42,183 --> 00:00:44,283
but I guess after a while,
it doesn't really matter.

16
00:00:44,684 --> 00:00:47,563
He's a vigilante.
He's a damn criminal.

17
00:00:47,588 --> 00:00:49,629
Here's the security footage
from the Exchange building.

18
00:00:49,654 --> 00:00:50,857
What do you want me to look for?

19
00:00:50,858 --> 00:00:52,625
I want you to look for anything
that's out of the ordinary.

20
00:00:52,726 --> 00:00:54,193
What is that? Play that again.

21
00:00:54,194 --> 00:00:56,594
Oliver Queen, you're under arrest on
suspicion of obstruction of justice,

22
00:00:56,595 --> 00:00:58,130
aggravated assault,
trespassing...

23
00:00:58,131 --> 00:01:00,232
- Are you out of your mind?!
- and murder.

24
00:01:09,942 --> 00:01:12,076
Dinner.

25
00:01:12,077 --> 00:01:14,345
Ah, come...
hey, I got an idea,

26
00:01:14,446 --> 00:01:16,314
why don't you let me
shoot that thing

27
00:01:16,315 --> 00:01:18,882
and you can go
pick up the bloody,

28
00:01:18,883 --> 00:01:21,919
dead, disgusting animal.

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,887
What?

30
00:01:23,888 --> 00:01:25,956
Try. Breathe.

31
00:01:25,957 --> 00:01:28,124
Everything, breathe.

32
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:33,229
Breathe, aim... fire.

33
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,897
Here.

34
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:40,002
Aim that tree.

35
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:56,251
Breathe.

36
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,791
What does that mean?

37
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:07,061
You will die badly.

38
00:02:07,162 --> 00:02:10,264
Get.

39
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,888
Ahh!

40
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,526
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
Wait, wait!

41
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:43,729
You can't leave me here!
Don't do this to me, please!

42
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,231
Oh-oh! No!

43
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:48,273
Please! I didn't
do anything!

44
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:52,270
The police think
they know who I am.

45
00:02:52,271 --> 00:02:53,905
They think I'm the vigilante.

46
00:02:53,906 --> 00:02:56,607
The man in the hood terrorizing
the city's criminals.

47
00:02:56,908 --> 00:02:59,377
They also think
they have me trapped.

48
00:02:59,378 --> 00:03:01,512
That I have no way out.

49
00:03:01,513 --> 00:03:03,548
They're only half right.

50
00:03:04,572 --> 00:03:08,572
<font color=#00FF00>1x05</font>

<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

52
00:03:11,522 --> 00:03:12,990
This is a mistake.

53
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:14,759
I'll be asking you
a few questions,

54
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,493
standard stuff for the report.

55
00:03:16,494 --> 00:03:17,929
Have you been arrested before?

56
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,229
That's ok, I know the
answer to that one,

57
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,997
plenty of times.

58
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:23,733
Like I said, this is a mistake.

59
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:25,501
Far as I can tell,
the only mistake I made

60
00:03:25,502 --> 00:03:28,237
was not shooting you down at
the docks when I had a chance.

61
00:03:28,238 --> 00:03:30,774
I am not who you think I am.

62
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:32,876
Oh, you're exactly
who I think you are.

63
00:03:32,877 --> 00:03:35,744
You're a dangerous menace who
doesn't care about who he hurts,

64
00:03:35,745 --> 00:03:38,047
except now you're doing
it with bows and arrows

65
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:39,481
instead of trust funds
and yachts.

66
00:03:39,482 --> 00:03:41,917
Detective... you hate me.

67
00:03:41,918 --> 00:03:43,786
I get it.

68
00:03:43,787 --> 00:03:46,221
But that doesn't make me
a vigilante.

69
00:03:46,222 --> 00:03:48,791
No. The security camera
footage of you

70
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:50,959
from the Unidac auction
with a green hood

71
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,627
- does that pretty well.
- And as I said again,

72
00:03:52,628 --> 00:03:54,629
I ran into the stairwell
once I heard the shooting.

73
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,231
I saw a duffel that I thought
maybe belonged to the shooter.

74
00:03:57,232 --> 00:04:00,574
I grabbed it, looked inside
and saw... A hood.

75
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,699
And what, you took it home with you?
'cause we cant find it.

76
00:04:02,738 --> 00:04:04,071
And what about harassing
Adam Hunt?

77
00:04:04,072 --> 00:04:05,874
That just happened
to take place

78
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:07,574
right across the street from
your little homecoming bash.

79
00:04:07,575 --> 00:04:09,543
- Those were coincidences.
- No.

80
00:04:09,744 --> 00:04:12,112
When they pile up like that,

81
00:04:12,113 --> 00:04:14,481
it becomes evidence.

82
00:04:14,482 --> 00:04:16,449
- His parents are here.
- Tell them to wait.

83
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,918
I want to see my son.

84
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,452
I'm in the middle of
an interrogation here!

85
00:04:19,453 --> 00:04:21,421
Detective Lance,
I know you hate my family,

86
00:04:21,422 --> 00:04:23,090
but I had no idea
that you'd go so far

87
00:04:23,091 --> 00:04:25,825
to arrest my son without
any grounds whatsoever!

88
00:04:25,826 --> 00:04:28,193
I have solid grounds,
and I have evidence.

89
00:04:28,194 --> 00:04:31,497
Which you can present to Mr. Queen's
attorney when he gets here.

90
00:04:31,498 --> 00:04:33,432
Until then, this interrogation

91
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:35,801
is over, Detective.

92
00:04:37,971 --> 00:04:41,439
Sure. You have
15 minutes.

93
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,113
Detective Lance appears to be
on some personal vendetta.

94
00:04:48,114 --> 00:04:50,448
He is.

95
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:52,817
He blames me for the
death of his daughter.

96
00:04:52,818 --> 00:04:55,486
He also thinks that
I dress up in a green hood

97
00:04:55,487 --> 00:04:57,688
and shoot people...
With arrows.

98
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:01,025
The important thing is not to say
anything until your attorney gets here.

99
00:05:01,026 --> 00:05:03,994
Fine. I want Laurel.

100
00:05:04,195 --> 00:05:06,629
Brilliant.

101
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,365
Oliver...

102
00:05:08,366 --> 00:05:09,933
I don't think
your ex-girlfriend

103
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,501
can be counted on
to be objective here.

104
00:05:11,502 --> 00:05:12,869
She knows me better
than anyone.

105
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,972
She knows that I could
never be this guy.

106
00:05:15,973 --> 00:05:17,774
Walter, you say Lance
has a vendetta?

107
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,108
- Yes.
- I think Laurel

108
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:21,510
can get him off of it.

109
00:05:21,511 --> 00:05:23,780
He raised her
to do the right thing.

110
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,115
That includes representing
an innocent man.

111
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:28,349
So... Mom.

112
00:05:29,952 --> 00:05:32,487
Please.

113
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,331
Laurel.

114
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:46,466
- Mrs. Queen! What are you...
- It's Oliver.

115
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:48,569
Something's happened.
It's been all over the news.

116
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:52,940
These charges are ludicrous.

117
00:05:52,941 --> 00:05:54,841
I know.

118
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:57,945
Can I ask you,
who's representing him?

119
00:05:57,946 --> 00:06:00,179
Well, that's why I'm here.

120
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,681
He wants you to represent him.

121
00:06:02,682 --> 00:06:04,050
Me?

122
00:06:04,151 --> 00:06:05,719
Yes. I told him
it was a bad idea,

123
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,188
but to be Frank,
I am desperate.

124
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:09,923
He says if you don't
represent him,

125
00:06:09,924 --> 00:06:11,657
then he doesn't want
any attorney.

126
00:06:11,658 --> 00:06:14,027
Mrs. Queen, my father
is the arresting officer.

127
00:06:14,028 --> 00:06:15,361
Yes.

128
00:06:15,362 --> 00:06:17,329
And I don't think
it's a good idea

129
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,431
for me to represent someone
who I've been involved with.

130
00:06:19,632 --> 00:06:21,766
Listen, I am sorry

131
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:23,468
for what your family
is going through...

132
00:06:23,469 --> 00:06:25,570
No... no apologies.

133
00:06:25,571 --> 00:06:28,106
Your idealism, I think,
is why my son,

134
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:30,742
for all his mistakes,
is so smitten with you.

135
00:06:32,244 --> 00:06:35,012
Regardless, it was a
bad idea on his part,

136
00:06:35,013 --> 00:06:38,983
and I am sorry if I made
you feel uncomfortable.

137
00:06:43,755 --> 00:06:46,424
Docket 81941,

138
00:06:46,425 --> 00:06:49,059
People vs. Oliver Queen.

139
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,228
Murder, aggravated assault,

140
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:55,098
assault with intent,
menacing and trespassing.

141
00:06:59,436 --> 00:07:00,937
Where's your attorney,
Mr. Queen?

142
00:07:00,938 --> 00:07:03,073
I'm representing myself, Judge.

143
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:05,407
I'm not sure that's the
wisest course, Mr. Queen.

144
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:07,609
I think it is.

145
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,578
I'm innocent.

146
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:11,814
Then we'll consider
that your plea.

147
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:13,182
Thank you.

148
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,516
Now, as to bail...

149
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,152
Your Honor,
Mr. Queen's family

150
00:07:16,153 --> 00:07:18,154
owns a pair of private jets,

151
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:19,788
and, well, on the subject
of their wealth,

152
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:22,056
I would point out that there
is virtually no bail amount

153
00:07:22,057 --> 00:07:24,425
that can guarantee
his presence at trial.

154
00:07:24,426 --> 00:07:25,927
So then I guess
it's a good thing

155
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:30,231
that the people's case
is so circumstantial.

156
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:35,603
Dinah Laurel Lance, Your Honor.

157
00:07:35,604 --> 00:07:37,304
I'd like to file my appearance

158
00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:39,706
on behalf of the defendant.

159
00:07:39,707 --> 00:07:42,342
Mr. Queen's wealth
should not deprive him

160
00:07:42,343 --> 00:07:44,211
of the right to be
released on bail

161
00:07:44,212 --> 00:07:45,812
while under the
presumption of innocence.

162
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:48,881
- He is a flight risk.
- Then minimize the risk.

163
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:51,884
The defendant is willing to
submit to home confinement

164
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:54,287
and electronic monitoring
through the wearing

165
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:57,623
of a UKG45 administrated
ankle device.

166
00:07:57,624 --> 00:07:59,158
- No, he wouldn't.
- Sold.

167
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,459
Your Honor...

168
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,628
Bail is set at $15 million.
$5 million bond.

169
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:05,463
Defendant to see probation

170
00:08:05,464 --> 00:08:09,868
for the fitting
of a GPS device.

171
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:11,903
I knew you couldn't resist
saving my ass.

172
00:08:11,904 --> 00:08:14,406
You're going to make me
regret this, aren't you?

173
00:08:14,407 --> 00:08:16,141
No. It's going
to be like old times.

174
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:18,808
Fortunately for you
with the legal case,

175
00:08:18,809 --> 00:08:20,644
there's no way that
you're this vigilante.

176
00:08:20,645 --> 00:08:22,479
- I agree.
- Because he's actually

177
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,848
trying to make a difference.

178
00:08:23,849 --> 00:08:25,716
We both know that's not
really your style.

179
00:08:37,234 --> 00:08:39,568
Mom. It's not that bad.

180
00:08:39,569 --> 00:08:42,738
Ok. This device has a direct
line into the precinct.

181
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:44,139
Stay on the property,
you're golden.

182
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,481
Any questions?
Yes.

183
00:08:46,498 --> 00:08:48,332
I'm having a sizable
get together

184
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,634
here tomorrow evening, and there
is a better than likely chance

185
00:08:50,635 --> 00:08:52,502
it spills into
the outdoor pool.

186
00:08:52,503 --> 00:08:54,237
Pool, that's fine.
Step on the grass,

187
00:08:54,238 --> 00:08:56,206
they're sending a SWAT team
to forcibly subdue you.

188
00:08:56,207 --> 00:08:58,474
- Thank you, officer.
- Of course.

189
00:08:58,475 --> 00:09:00,877
A "sizable get together"?

190
00:09:00,878 --> 00:09:02,712
I'm confined to this house

191
00:09:02,713 --> 00:09:04,647
for the foreseeable future. I might
as well make the most of it.

192
00:09:04,648 --> 00:09:06,349
And this party
is going to be themed.

193
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,583
I'm thinking prison,

194
00:09:08,584 --> 00:09:11,020
uh, burning man meets
"Shawshank Redemption".

195
00:09:11,021 --> 00:09:14,856
The invite says, "come before
Oliver Queen gets off."

196
00:09:14,857 --> 00:09:16,892
Maybe a party's not
in the best of taste,

197
00:09:16,893 --> 00:09:18,760
you know, considering
the circumstances.

198
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:20,495
Tommy, the circumstances

199
00:09:20,496 --> 00:09:22,831
are why we're having
the party in the first place.

200
00:09:22,832 --> 00:09:25,766
I want people to know that I'm
not worried about any of this.

201
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:28,036
Well, that makes one of us.

202
00:09:28,037 --> 00:09:29,537
Before you start yelling...

203
00:09:29,538 --> 00:09:31,406
Why would I yell?

204
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:32,440
You're only defending the man
that killed your sister.

205
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:34,309
Oliver did not kill Sarah!

206
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,277
If it wasn't for him, she
wouldn't have been on that boat.

207
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:38,079
Have you consider
the possibility

208
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,713
that that's the reason
you're trying

209
00:09:39,714 --> 00:09:41,448
to make him out
to be this... this menace?

210
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:43,383
No, it is the video tape,

211
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:44,784
is the suspicious timing,
that is the reason!

212
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:47,220
This is Oliver Queen
we're talking about.

213
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:49,589
He wrecks fancy cars
and he dates models.

214
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,224
He doesn't kill people.

215
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:53,393
No, he just uses them,
like he used Sarah

216
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:54,794
and like he used you,
and he's only asked you

217
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:56,963
to be his lawyer to get at me.

218
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:59,665
No, he asked me to be his lawyer
to get through to you.

219
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,001
You hate the Hood
and you hate Oliver,

220
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,770
and you want more than anything
for them to be the same person.

221
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,673
But Oliver isn't the reason
why Sarah died.

222
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:09,508
Or the reason mom left.

223
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:10,742
I don't have to listen to this.

224
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,811
By the way...

225
00:10:13,812 --> 00:10:17,615
You're not the only
one who misses them.

226
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:31,595
Yup?

227
00:10:31,596 --> 00:10:34,365
Thank you for coming.
Shut the door.

228
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,502
I guess it was just
a matter of time

229
00:10:38,503 --> 00:10:39,870
before the police
caught up with you.

230
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:40,971
Except they didn't.

231
00:10:40,972 --> 00:10:42,739
Oliver, they got you on video.

232
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,441
I knew the security camera
was there,

233
00:10:44,442 --> 00:10:45,976
just like I knew the police
would review the footage

234
00:10:45,977 --> 00:10:47,577
and arrest me.

235
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:49,245
All part of the plan.

236
00:10:49,246 --> 00:10:50,947
So you wanted to get arrested?

237
00:10:50,948 --> 00:10:52,382
Well, I returned
to Starling City

238
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:54,450
and a few days later,
the vigilante appears.

239
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:57,153
Sooner or later, somebody was
going to make the connection.

240
00:10:57,154 --> 00:10:58,989
So what part of serving
yourself up to the cops

241
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,557
will help you avoid going to
prison for the rest of your life?

242
00:11:01,558 --> 00:11:03,058
There's more to it.

243
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:04,493
Well, there better be,
for your sake,

244
00:11:04,494 --> 00:11:06,595
because your family is
freaking out downstairs.

245
00:11:06,596 --> 00:11:09,064
Oliver, your mother and your
sister just got you back,

246
00:11:09,065 --> 00:11:11,534
and now you're going to put them
through a trial, maybe even worse?

247
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:12,935
Don't you care?

248
00:11:12,936 --> 00:11:15,504
Of course I care.

249
00:11:15,505 --> 00:11:18,506
The mission comes first.

250
00:11:21,443 --> 00:11:23,811
Who is he?

251
00:11:23,812 --> 00:11:25,647
Leo Mueller.
German arms dealer.

252
00:11:25,648 --> 00:11:27,882
Suspected in the theft
of a hundred m249

253
00:11:27,883 --> 00:11:29,551
squad automatic weapons.

254
00:11:29,552 --> 00:11:31,519
Ok...

255
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,854
Last night he arrived in
Starling City to sell the guns.

256
00:11:33,855 --> 00:11:35,656
Oliver, don't you imagine

257
00:11:35,657 --> 00:11:36,990
there's enough trouble
you're in this week

258
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:38,525
than to go after this guy?

259
00:11:38,526 --> 00:11:40,060
I imagine what would happen
if a street gang

260
00:11:40,061 --> 00:11:42,495
got their hands
on military-grade hardware.

261
00:11:42,496 --> 00:11:45,398
I imagine our city's streets
turned into a war zone.

262
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,834
But you're under
house arrest, Oliver,

263
00:11:47,835 --> 00:11:49,902
which means you can't
just go after this guy.

264
00:11:49,903 --> 00:11:53,873
Look, for now, I would just
like you to shadow Mueller.

265
00:11:53,874 --> 00:11:56,308
I would like you
to track his movements.

266
00:11:56,309 --> 00:11:59,511
I want to know
where the buy is happening.

267
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:01,581
Ok.

268
00:12:01,582 --> 00:12:04,249
And how am I supposed
to track him?

269
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,918
Well, you know us
billionaire vigilantes...

270
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:09,520
we do love our toys.

271
00:12:26,905 --> 00:12:28,672
Ow!

272
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,612
Oooh.

273
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:43,385
Oh, well, that's sweet.

274
00:12:43,386 --> 00:12:46,388
You wanted to see me, sir?

275
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:48,658
No. I didn't.

276
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:52,561
In fact, this meeting
isn't taking place.

277
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:58,399
How long have you been
head of security

278
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,301
at Queen consolidated, Josiah?

279
00:13:00,302 --> 00:13:01,937
Going on seven years now, sir.

280
00:13:01,938 --> 00:13:04,339
Sounds about right.

281
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,241
But what I'm about to tell you

282
00:13:06,242 --> 00:13:09,443
will test the bounds
of your discretion.

283
00:13:09,444 --> 00:13:11,512
You're aware
of the "Queen's gambit",

284
00:13:11,513 --> 00:13:12,980
Robert Queen's
ill-fated yacht?

285
00:13:14,582 --> 00:13:16,316
Well, I found it.

286
00:13:16,317 --> 00:13:20,021
Sir, the boat went down in the
North China sea five years ago.

287
00:13:20,022 --> 00:13:21,856
Which is why my discovery
of its remains

288
00:13:21,857 --> 00:13:26,026
in a warehouse downtown was
unexpected, to say the least.

289
00:13:26,027 --> 00:13:29,262
I want you to transfer
those remains

290
00:13:29,263 --> 00:13:32,198
to a secure location.
Can I count on you?

291
00:13:34,268 --> 00:13:36,469
What's going on, sir?

292
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,173
That's very much what
I'm trying to determine.

293
00:13:50,683 --> 00:13:52,317
Thank you both for coming.

294
00:13:52,318 --> 00:13:53,785
No, thank you.

295
00:13:53,786 --> 00:13:56,354
It's nice to get
out of the house.

296
00:13:56,355 --> 00:13:59,257
I'll cut right to it. Detective
Lance arrested your client

297
00:13:59,258 --> 00:14:02,360
without consulting
my office first.

298
00:14:02,361 --> 00:14:04,361
So congratulations.
I am willing

299
00:14:04,362 --> 00:14:06,096
to consider
a plea in this case.

300
00:14:06,097 --> 00:14:07,398
Absolutely not.

301
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,633
Mr. Queen spent
five years in seclusion

302
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:12,936
on a deserted island,
cut off from civilization.

303
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:15,038
It is quite possible
he's suffering from some form

304
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,940
of post traumatic stress.

305
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:18,775
Given that, we would support

306
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:20,610
a plea of insanity.

307
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:24,113
Conditional on a period
of indeterminate incarceration

308
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:25,981
at a psychiatric facility.

309
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:28,451
No, thank you.
I'm not crazy.

310
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:29,952
Finally something we agree on.

311
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,621
He's not a nut,
he's a killing machine.

312
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:32,955
Actually, I'm neither.

313
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,390
There is nothing
you can say to me

314
00:14:34,391 --> 00:14:37,492
that I would believe.

315
00:14:37,493 --> 00:14:40,362
I'll take a polygraph.

316
00:14:40,363 --> 00:14:42,464
Uh, polygraphs
are inadmissible.

317
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,832
In front of the jury.

318
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,667
I'll take a polygraph
in front of him.

319
00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:50,038
He's the one
I need to convince.

320
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,972
I'm going to need a minute.

321
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:07,388
You're looking
at life in prison.

322
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:10,057
What Spencer
just offered you is a gift.

323
00:15:10,058 --> 00:15:12,325
I'm not crazy.
I am innocent.

324
00:15:12,326 --> 00:15:14,061
I kind of want
to take the polygraph.

325
00:15:14,062 --> 00:15:17,597
And if I take it
and I fail, then...

326
00:15:17,598 --> 00:15:22,002
I will consider making a deal.

327
00:15:22,003 --> 00:15:23,403
Fine.

328
00:15:23,404 --> 00:15:25,604
I'll set up the poly.

329
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:28,007
And I will tell Spencer
that we're not pleading out,

330
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:30,777
but Oliver, you have a family.

331
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:33,079
Friends. People
who actually care about you.

332
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,248
So don't, for one second,
think you're the only person

333
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:38,284
with something to lose here.

334
00:15:39,753 --> 00:15:42,587
I'll be right back.

335
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:08,679
Please, sit.

336
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,315
You're making me feel rude.

337
00:16:18,155 --> 00:16:21,195
I do apologize for my men's

338
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:23,998
treatment of you.

339
00:16:24,328 --> 00:16:26,595
They're...
they're trained

340
00:16:26,596 --> 00:16:30,265
to view any stranger
as hostile.

341
00:16:32,768 --> 00:16:35,971
I'm Edward Fyers, by the way.

342
00:16:38,074 --> 00:16:41,476
And you are?

343
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:45,646
I'm Oliver Queen.

344
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:48,115
I was shipwrecked here.

345
00:16:48,116 --> 00:16:52,220
I don't... know
for how long.

346
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:54,956
My family has money.

347
00:16:54,957 --> 00:16:57,992
They have lots of money
you would be...

348
00:16:57,993 --> 00:17:02,628
You'd be really well
compensated for my rescue.

349
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:06,099
Well, I look forward to that.

350
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,634
But for the moment,
let's just talk.

351
00:17:08,635 --> 00:17:10,536
About what?

352
00:17:10,537 --> 00:17:12,739
Well, for instance...

353
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:17,709
This gentleman.

354
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,712
Do you know him?

355
00:17:26,186 --> 00:17:28,787
- No.
- No?

356
00:17:28,788 --> 00:17:30,222
No. Who's he?

357
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:32,957
You're a poor liar.

358
00:17:38,831 --> 00:17:41,366
I've been polite.

359
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:43,902
I'll offer you one more chance

360
00:17:43,903 --> 00:17:45,970
before my manners leave me.

361
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:49,206
Hey, hey.
I don't know this guy.

362
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:52,209
I thought I was on this
island all by myself.

363
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,479
Do you know what
this island is named?

364
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,381
We're on Lian Yu...

365
00:17:57,382 --> 00:17:59,550
Mandarin for "purgatory",

366
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,252
and I can make it
feel like hell.

367
00:18:04,655 --> 00:18:07,824
I don't know
why you're protecting him.

368
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:11,060
You're young, foolish.

369
00:18:11,061 --> 00:18:14,431
Perhaps you don't know
why, either.

370
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:19,602
Think on that when
you're begging for death.

371
00:18:22,238 --> 00:18:25,373
He's yours now.

372
00:18:43,936 --> 00:18:45,544
Hey, sweetie.

373
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:47,574
One of the workers left a
keg too far from the bar.

374
00:18:47,575 --> 00:18:49,010
Can you ask them
to move it please?

375
00:18:49,011 --> 00:18:51,211
I got the ankle... thingie.

376
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:53,914
I don't want to set off
a SWAT invasion.

377
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,019
Hey!

378
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,319
All this stuff?

379
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,221
It's going to be
fine, I promise.

380
00:19:02,222 --> 00:19:05,324
Yeah, well, when you and dad
left on the yacht,

381
00:19:05,325 --> 00:19:07,393
you promised me I'd see you
in a few days.

382
00:19:07,394 --> 00:19:09,663
Which didn't happen.

383
00:19:09,664 --> 00:19:11,430
This is different than that.

384
00:19:11,431 --> 00:19:15,068
I didn't do any of this
stuff, you know that.

385
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:16,601
Right?

386
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:19,038
You're out all the time.

387
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,273
You have those scars,

388
00:19:21,274 --> 00:19:23,275
and since you've been back,
you've been acting really weird.

389
00:19:23,276 --> 00:19:26,879
None of this makes me
some Robin Hood wannabe.

390
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,882
And you get me this.

391
00:19:29,883 --> 00:19:31,916
I mean, it's an arrowhead.

392
00:19:31,917 --> 00:19:34,185
Oh, man.

393
00:19:35,721 --> 00:19:38,522
Thea, I bought that

394
00:19:38,523 --> 00:19:41,258
in the gift shop
of the Beijing airport.

395
00:19:47,365 --> 00:19:50,100
Now I'm sort of happy
I didn't buy you

396
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:52,736
the shot glass
with the panda on it,

397
00:19:52,737 --> 00:19:55,271
'cause then you'd be
worried I was panda man.

398
00:19:57,641 --> 00:20:01,011
You know, I knew
you couldn't be

399
00:20:01,012 --> 00:20:02,746
this person.

400
00:20:02,747 --> 00:20:05,081
I-I just...

401
00:20:05,082 --> 00:20:07,382
I can't lose you again.

402
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:10,752
Deal.

403
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,725
Moira. Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

404
00:20:16,726 --> 00:20:18,727
Yes. Could you please
make this quick?

405
00:20:18,728 --> 00:20:21,096
I'm in the midst of somewhat
of a family emergency.

406
00:20:21,097 --> 00:20:22,564
Yes, of course.

407
00:20:22,565 --> 00:20:23,932
It's all over the local news.

408
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:26,602
Possibly even national.

409
00:20:26,603 --> 00:20:29,037
- Well, I know what you're thinking.
- Do you?

410
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:31,539
My son is not the man
targeting the list.

411
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,074
The charges are preposterous.

412
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:34,408
Not according to the
district attorney,

413
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:36,111
assistant district attorney,

414
00:20:36,112 --> 00:20:38,113
investigating Detective
in the police department

415
00:20:38,114 --> 00:20:39,647
that filed charges against him.

416
00:20:39,648 --> 00:20:42,450
That Detective has a
vendetta against my family.

417
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:44,885
Why? Is there
something untoward

418
00:20:44,886 --> 00:20:47,888
about your family?

419
00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:50,791
If so, something really needs
to be done about that.

420
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,461
Is your name Oliver Queen?

421
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,164
You don't know
who I am, Detective?

422
00:20:57,165 --> 00:21:00,599
The questions are to
calibrate the polygraph.

423
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,068
- Is your name Oliver Queen?
- Yes.

424
00:21:02,069 --> 00:21:03,569
Were you born in Starling City

425
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,738
May 16th, 1985?

426
00:21:05,739 --> 00:21:07,106
Yes.

427
00:21:07,107 --> 00:21:08,407
- Is your hair blue?
- No.

428
00:21:08,408 --> 00:21:10,943
Have you ever been to
Iron Heights prison?

429
00:21:10,944 --> 00:21:12,611
No.

430
00:21:17,984 --> 00:21:20,585
Are you the man
in this picture?

431
00:21:20,586 --> 00:21:25,323
Where can I find the man
in this picture?

432
00:21:25,324 --> 00:21:27,625
No.

433
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,135
You steal 40 million
dollars off Adam Hunt?

434
00:21:38,136 --> 00:21:40,805
- No, I didn't.
- Were you marooned

435
00:21:40,806 --> 00:21:42,206
on an island called
Lian Yu for 5 years?

436
00:21:42,207 --> 00:21:43,507
- Yes.
- How is that even relevant?

437
00:21:43,508 --> 00:21:44,809
I don't need to show relevance,

438
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,810
but since you asked,
whatever happened

439
00:21:46,811 --> 00:21:49,312
to your client on that island turned
him into a cold blooded killer.

440
00:21:53,217 --> 00:21:56,319
No!

441
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,988
The physician that
examined you reported that

442
00:21:58,989 --> 00:22:01,224
20% of your body is
covered in scar tissue.

443
00:22:05,862 --> 00:22:08,430
The machine won't work
unless you ask a question.

444
00:22:08,431 --> 00:22:10,565
Did that happen to you there?

445
00:22:10,566 --> 00:22:11,900
Yes.

446
00:22:11,901 --> 00:22:13,535
When you came back,

447
00:22:13,536 --> 00:22:16,538
you told everyone that you
were alone on that island.

448
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:19,241
Are you claiming
that your scars were...

449
00:22:19,242 --> 00:22:20,742
Self-inflicted?

450
00:22:20,743 --> 00:22:22,210
No.

451
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:24,278
I wasn't alone.

452
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,247
I didn't want to talk about what
happened to me on the island.

453
00:22:26,248 --> 00:22:27,882
Why not?

454
00:22:27,883 --> 00:22:30,251
Because the people
that were there tortured me.

455
00:22:30,252 --> 00:22:33,588
Have you killed anyone?

456
00:22:42,263 --> 00:22:45,399
Yes.

457
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:50,471
When I asked your daughter Sara

458
00:22:50,472 --> 00:22:52,538
to come on my father's
yacht with me.

459
00:22:56,076 --> 00:22:59,779
I killed your daughter.

460
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:16,695
I'd have to study the data,

461
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:19,564
but just eyeballing it,
he's telling the truth.

462
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:20,932
Hmm.

463
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:23,534
Can I assume that
you'll be recommending.

464
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:26,103
Ms. Spencer to drop
all charges against my client?

465
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,471
No.

466
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,106
I know a guilty man
when I see one.

467
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:32,376
He is guilty, whether
you can see it or not.

468
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:43,781
You're going to love this.

469
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:04,301
Hi, everybody!

470
00:24:04,302 --> 00:24:05,218
Hey!

471
00:24:05,245 --> 00:24:07,413
I'm very touched that you came

472
00:24:07,414 --> 00:24:09,181
to celebrate with me
before I am

473
00:24:09,182 --> 00:24:11,283
sent up the river.

474
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:13,586
Closest neighbors
are six miles away,

475
00:24:13,587 --> 00:24:15,287
so don't worry about the noise.

476
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:17,690
Actually, on second thought...

477
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:20,959
Let's wake those losers up!

478
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,295
Whoo!

479
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:30,535
If you think this is what
prison's like,

480
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:33,672
you are in
for a rude awakening.

481
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:35,507
Mueller's car has been parked in the
warehouse district of the Glades

482
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:37,208
for 45 minutes.

483
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,511
Yeah, that's a good
place for an arms deal.

484
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:41,979
Ok, since this is
going down tonight,

485
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,215
what do we do, drop a dime
on Mueller with the cops?

486
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,083
No, the man in the hood.

487
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:48,419
He's going to stop them.

488
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,721
Oliver, you can't
leave the house.

489
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:54,691
It doesn't have to be me
in the hood.

490
00:24:57,328 --> 00:25:00,531
That's why you threw
this ridiculous party?

491
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:03,448
So you have a hundred witnesses

492
00:25:03,449 --> 00:25:04,657
placing you here at the house

493
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,003
while I'm supposed to be across
town dressed as a vigilante?

494
00:25:07,004 --> 00:25:08,338
I thought that it was
going to be good enough

495
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:10,439
just for you to be seen
in the hood.

496
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,175
I didn't count
on Mueller showing up

497
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:13,876
and I didn't count
on the possibility

498
00:25:13,877 --> 00:25:15,444
that the Glades
could be flooded

499
00:25:15,445 --> 00:25:17,713
with machine guns.

500
00:25:17,714 --> 00:25:20,749
Look.

501
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,420
I promise, it was
never my intention

502
00:25:24,421 --> 00:25:26,921
to put you in harm's way.

503
00:25:26,922 --> 00:25:30,425
Oliver, I didn't think joining your
crusade was ever going to be risk-free.

504
00:25:30,426 --> 00:25:33,761
I just don't like being played.

505
00:25:33,762 --> 00:25:36,998
Now you might have gotten used to
lying to everyone else in your life,

506
00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:39,867
but I'm the one guy
you don't lie to.

507
00:25:39,868 --> 00:25:43,270
You're right.

508
00:25:43,271 --> 00:25:45,372
I'm sorry.

509
00:25:49,444 --> 00:25:51,812
So am I going to jail?

510
00:25:54,216 --> 00:25:57,050
No, man.

511
00:25:59,052 --> 00:26:01,754
I got to stop an arms deal.

512
00:26:10,427 --> 00:26:12,094
Hello?

513
00:26:12,095 --> 00:26:14,696
Mr. Steel, I'm sorry
to bother you, sir.

514
00:26:14,697 --> 00:26:16,398
This is Mike Vogel
down in security.

515
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:18,033
But I have some
sad news for you.

516
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:21,069
The company's head
of security, Josiah Hudson,

517
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,338
was in a car accident tonight.

518
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:27,910
He's dead, sir.

519
00:26:27,911 --> 00:26:29,878
♪ You said that you're
a freak in the sheets ♪

520
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:33,873
♪ that my eyes
had to see to believe ♪

521
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:35,369
Hello.

522
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:37,522
Do we have a legal meeting
or something?

523
00:26:37,523 --> 00:26:40,692
Because I have friends over.

524
00:26:40,693 --> 00:26:44,196
Do you think maybe you
can tear yourself away

525
00:26:44,197 --> 00:26:46,497
from this inappropriately
themed rave

526
00:26:46,498 --> 00:26:48,166
for a couple minutes?

527
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,904
Wow.

528
00:26:53,905 --> 00:26:56,173
I can't remember the last time

529
00:26:56,174 --> 00:26:57,507
that I've been in this room.

530
00:26:57,508 --> 00:26:59,676
I can. Halloween, 2005.

531
00:26:59,677 --> 00:27:02,713
We were getting ready
for Tommy's party.

532
00:27:02,714 --> 00:27:05,049
Ah. Yes.

533
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:07,817
I wore those horrible fishnets.

534
00:27:07,818 --> 00:27:10,419
I thought you looked good.

535
00:27:12,723 --> 00:27:14,891
Listen...

536
00:27:14,892 --> 00:27:16,993
I just wanted
to come by and apologize

537
00:27:16,994 --> 00:27:19,229
for my father's behavior today.

538
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,763
During the polygraph.

539
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,866
You don't have
to apologize for him.

540
00:27:22,867 --> 00:27:26,201
He has a right to feel
any way that he wants.

541
00:27:26,202 --> 00:27:29,004
It wasn't just Sara, Ollie.

542
00:27:29,005 --> 00:27:30,740
What do you mean?

543
00:27:30,741 --> 00:27:33,709
After Sara died,

544
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:37,045
my father threw himself
into his work.

545
00:27:37,046 --> 00:27:40,715
I think that's part
of the reason I'm an attorney.

546
00:27:40,716 --> 00:27:43,485
He ran to the law
and I followed.

547
00:27:43,486 --> 00:27:45,820
But my mother couldn't.

548
00:27:48,056 --> 00:27:50,057
So she left him.

549
00:27:52,461 --> 00:27:55,729
Left us.

550
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:57,765
Look, I'm not trying
to tell you this

551
00:27:57,766 --> 00:27:59,933
to make you feel bad, or worse.

552
00:27:59,934 --> 00:28:02,669
I just... I really want you
to understand him.

553
00:28:04,806 --> 00:28:08,942
Why don't you hate me?

554
00:28:08,943 --> 00:28:11,778
You should.

555
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:14,514
I did.

556
00:28:14,515 --> 00:28:19,151
For so long, I did, Ollie.

557
00:28:19,152 --> 00:28:22,321
But after today,
I realized that...

558
00:28:22,322 --> 00:28:25,357
I was so focused
on what happened to my family

559
00:28:25,358 --> 00:28:27,626
that I didn't even
stop and wonder

560
00:28:27,627 --> 00:28:29,828
what could have
happened to you.

561
00:28:33,332 --> 00:28:38,637
I didn't know about
the torture, or your scars.

562
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:43,308
What happened to you
on that island

563
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:46,577
was far more than you deserved.

564
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:51,449
And I was wrong

565
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,918
that I didn't ask you before,

566
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,953
but I'm asking you now.

567
00:28:55,954 --> 00:28:58,322
I need to know.
I need to see.

568
00:28:58,323 --> 00:29:00,022
Are you sure?

569
00:29:01,358 --> 00:29:04,160
Yes.

570
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:25,113
How did you survive this?

571
00:29:25,114 --> 00:29:29,284
There were times
when I wanted to die.

572
00:29:29,285 --> 00:29:31,886
In the end...

573
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:36,323
There was something
I wanted more.

574
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:01,882
No. Laurel,
you don't have to go.

575
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,650
Oh, God.
I have to.

576
00:30:06,352 --> 00:30:08,687
Amazing.

577
00:30:08,688 --> 00:30:12,758
You have resolve
I didn't credit you for.

578
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:16,495
Or perhaps he truly
doesn't know anything.

579
00:30:18,331 --> 00:30:20,865
We should put him
out of his misery.

580
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,671
It's an M249 machine gun.

581
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:17,574
Gas-powered, air-cooled,

582
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:20,744
fires up to 800 rounds
per minute.

583
00:31:26,683 --> 00:31:28,017
We need to move, now!

584
00:31:28,018 --> 00:31:29,752
What are you doing?
Get out of here!

585
00:31:29,753 --> 00:31:32,788
Move! Let's go!

586
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:52,341
Well.

587
00:31:52,342 --> 00:31:54,608
I'm not accustomed
to being summoned

588
00:31:54,609 --> 00:31:58,279
to the office
in the middle of the night.

589
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,815
Well, what was it
that was so important

590
00:32:00,816 --> 00:32:02,917
that I had to race down here?

591
00:32:02,918 --> 00:32:07,021
I found the
"Queen's Gambit", Moira.

592
00:32:09,224 --> 00:32:12,692
I know you secretly
had the boat salvaged.

593
00:32:12,693 --> 00:32:14,895
I wanted to move it
to a more secure location

594
00:32:14,896 --> 00:32:18,932
before confronting you about it.
In fact, I sent Josiah Hudson

595
00:32:18,933 --> 00:32:21,768
to the warehouse for
precisely that purpose.

596
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:25,438
But he died mysteriously
in a car accident.

597
00:32:25,439 --> 00:32:27,673
I hope you now have
a better understanding

598
00:32:27,674 --> 00:32:30,242
of why it is I've been
so distant of late.

599
00:32:30,243 --> 00:32:32,812
It's very disconcerting
to discover

600
00:32:32,813 --> 00:32:34,980
that the person with whom
you share your home,

601
00:32:34,981 --> 00:32:36,415
your bed and your heart

602
00:32:36,416 --> 00:32:39,518
has been lying to you
so convincingly,

603
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,253
and I would be a fool
not to consider

604
00:32:41,254 --> 00:32:42,620
all the things that you
have told me were lies.

605
00:32:42,621 --> 00:32:44,289
Walter, you're my husband, I...

606
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:47,025
Yes, I am.

607
00:32:47,026 --> 00:32:48,992
Walter, please.

608
00:32:48,993 --> 00:32:51,428
You've got to stop looking
into this, it's not safe.

609
00:32:51,629 --> 00:32:54,464
You'll be... you'll be
upsetting people,

610
00:32:54,465 --> 00:32:57,634
people with influence.

611
00:32:57,635 --> 00:33:01,538
You are very far
out of your depth.

612
00:33:07,177 --> 00:33:11,213
Man in the hood, one,
gangbangers, zero.

613
00:33:11,214 --> 00:33:12,981
Hang on.

614
00:33:12,982 --> 00:33:14,583
Yeah?

615
00:33:14,584 --> 00:33:17,819
Mr. Queen, if you're
entertaining guests upstairs,

616
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,688
should I have
some drinks sent up?

617
00:33:19,689 --> 00:33:22,157
No. It's just me up here and
I'm on my way back down.

618
00:33:22,158 --> 00:33:24,092
Good job.

619
00:33:24,093 --> 00:33:26,161
Now get back here.

620
00:33:53,554 --> 00:33:56,422
Yeah. Yep.

621
00:33:56,423 --> 00:33:59,158
How did you know
I was in trouble?

622
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:01,060
Because when the guy
was fighting you,

623
00:34:01,061 --> 00:34:03,329
- he broke the ankle monitor.
- Are you all right?!

624
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,231
I'm fine.
Oliver...

625
00:34:05,232 --> 00:34:07,833
Mom. I promise.

626
00:34:07,834 --> 00:34:10,001
This is on you.
By accusing my son publicly,

627
00:34:10,002 --> 00:34:11,470
you've made him a target.

628
00:34:11,471 --> 00:34:14,506
Do you have any idea
who attacked Oliver?

629
00:34:14,507 --> 00:34:16,941
We haven't identified him.
Though it must be someone

630
00:34:16,942 --> 00:34:18,943
with a grudge against
the Hood, obviously.

631
00:34:18,944 --> 00:34:21,179
What are you doing?

632
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,415
I got a call from my lieutenant.

633
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:26,984
An arms dealer was attacked
across town tonight.

634
00:34:29,521 --> 00:34:32,823
By the vigilante. Multiple
witnesses put him there.

635
00:34:32,824 --> 00:34:36,293
In light of that, all charges
against your son are being dropped.

636
00:34:36,294 --> 00:34:40,597
I'm truly sorry for what's
happened to your family, Quentin.

637
00:34:40,598 --> 00:34:42,965
But would you kindly get
the hell out of my house?

638
00:34:50,508 --> 00:34:52,775
Mr. Lance...

639
00:34:54,811 --> 00:34:57,179
Thank you.

640
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,961
Moira.

641
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:19,171
- Did we have an appointment?
- No, but I decided

642
00:35:19,172 --> 00:35:22,140
to screw propriety after you
tried to have my son killed.

643
00:35:23,443 --> 00:35:24,943
I'm sure you understand,

644
00:35:24,944 --> 00:35:26,778
I was justified
in suspecting your son

645
00:35:26,779 --> 00:35:29,448
of being the vigilante
targeting our associates.

646
00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:31,217
I had to take steps.

647
00:35:31,418 --> 00:35:34,218
And now that you know your
steps were taken in error,

648
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:36,554
that Oliver is not your enemy.

649
00:35:38,189 --> 00:35:41,559
I offer my sincerest apologies.

650
00:35:44,296 --> 00:35:47,197
I know you found out I
had the yacht salvaged,

651
00:35:47,198 --> 00:35:50,801
just as I know you had
Josiah Hudson killed.

652
00:35:50,802 --> 00:35:56,072
Well, accidents tend to befall
people who are too curious.

653
00:35:56,073 --> 00:35:59,075
I've been the good soldier.

654
00:35:59,076 --> 00:36:03,379
I've done everything you asked.

655
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,881
But if any member of my family

656
00:36:05,882 --> 00:36:08,684
so much as gets a paper cut,

657
00:36:08,685 --> 00:36:13,188
I will burn your
entire world to ashes.

658
00:36:30,572 --> 00:36:33,308
I tell you, island dangerous,

659
00:36:33,309 --> 00:36:35,209
but you not tell them
where to find me.

660
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:38,545
You stronger than I thought.
Take it.

661
00:36:38,546 --> 00:36:41,382
I lead them off, you stay.

662
00:36:41,383 --> 00:36:43,184
Remember. Everything, breathe.

663
00:36:43,185 --> 00:36:45,419
You breathe,
you survive here longer.

664
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,256
No! I'm coming with you!

665
00:36:57,064 --> 00:36:58,265
Rough party.

666
00:36:58,266 --> 00:36:59,800
My father told me
what happened.

667
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,402
Are you ok?

668
00:37:02,403 --> 00:37:05,272
Yeah, I'm fine.

669
00:37:07,474 --> 00:37:10,442
These are your
polygraph results.

670
00:37:10,443 --> 00:37:14,146
My father asked you if you'd
ever been to Iron Heights.

671
00:37:14,147 --> 00:37:18,284
It's the prison where the
vigilante saved me last week.

672
00:37:18,285 --> 00:37:21,887
It's also where you and I went
on our eighth grade field trip.

673
00:37:21,888 --> 00:37:24,990
When you said that you
had never been there,

674
00:37:24,991 --> 00:37:27,458
I thought maybe
you were just nervous,

675
00:37:27,459 --> 00:37:30,628
or that you'd forgotten.

676
00:37:30,629 --> 00:37:34,432
But then I looked
at your results,

677
00:37:34,433 --> 00:37:38,803
and there is a slight flutter in
your answer to that question.

678
00:37:38,804 --> 00:37:41,239
And if you lied on one,

679
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,106
you could have lied on others.

680
00:37:43,107 --> 00:37:45,242
What happened to me
being too selfish

681
00:37:45,243 --> 00:37:48,245
to be a masked crusader?

682
00:37:48,246 --> 00:37:51,148
Oliver!
I saw your scars.

683
00:37:57,722 --> 00:38:00,194
Do you want to know why

684
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:02,319
I don't talk about what
happened to me there?

685
00:38:02,392 --> 00:38:06,095
Because if people knew;

686
00:38:06,096 --> 00:38:09,798
If you knew...

687
00:38:09,799 --> 00:38:13,236
You'd see me differently.

688
00:38:13,237 --> 00:38:15,203
And not as some...

689
00:38:15,204 --> 00:38:17,805
vigilante guy.

690
00:38:20,142 --> 00:38:22,911
As damaged.

691
00:38:22,912 --> 00:38:26,047
I don't sleep.

692
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:29,017
I barely eat.

693
00:38:29,018 --> 00:38:31,818
I can barely sign my name,

694
00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:36,490
let alone aim a bow and arrow.

695
00:38:39,327 --> 00:38:42,329
After last night...

696
00:38:44,933 --> 00:38:49,035
clearly we're still
attracted to one another.

697
00:38:52,273 --> 00:38:54,840
Oliver.

698
00:38:54,841 --> 00:38:58,611
Nothing can ever
happen between us.

699
00:39:01,015 --> 00:39:04,049
I know.

700
00:39:18,163 --> 00:39:20,398
So you lied to her.

701
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:23,034
Or maybe you just gave her
a version of the truth.

702
00:39:23,035 --> 00:39:24,535
I told her what
she needed to hear, Diggle.

703
00:39:24,536 --> 00:39:26,003
She was too close.

704
00:39:26,004 --> 00:39:30,141
Sad thing is, I think you
actually believe that.

705
00:39:30,142 --> 00:39:32,543
I think things didn't go down
exactly how you planned.

706
00:39:32,544 --> 00:39:35,511
You didn't count on so many
people having questions,

707
00:39:35,512 --> 00:39:37,213
doubting you.

708
00:39:37,214 --> 00:39:39,649
You didn't think about
what happens when you lie.

709
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,318
- Thank you, Chris.
- Walter?

710
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:45,021
Especially when you lie to
the ones you love the most.

711
00:39:45,022 --> 00:39:47,023
What is this?

712
00:39:47,024 --> 00:39:48,224
Business trip.

713
00:39:48,225 --> 00:39:50,426
I decided it's long overdue

714
00:39:50,427 --> 00:39:52,461
for me to inspect
our holdings in Melbourne.

715
00:39:53,629 --> 00:39:56,065
And how long will you be?

716
00:39:56,066 --> 00:39:59,468
I don't know.

717
00:40:05,232 --> 00:40:07,475
When you were
stuck on that island

718
00:40:07,476 --> 00:40:09,244
plotting your grand plan
to save the city,

719
00:40:10,085 --> 00:40:12,755
I don't think you stopped
to consider the effect

720
00:40:12,855 --> 00:40:15,389
it would have on the
people in your life.

721
00:40:18,086 --> 00:40:21,221
Let's go.

722
00:40:22,556 --> 00:40:24,791
You're ok.
No, no, no.

723
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,561
Or how it might hurt them.

724
00:40:28,562 --> 00:40:31,763
You're wrong.

725
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:35,801
I think about it all the time.

726
00:40:35,802 --> 00:40:37,769
And just to be clear,

727
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:41,573
not being able to tell
my family the truth...

728
00:40:41,574 --> 00:40:46,711
It doesn't hurt anyone
worse than it hurts me.

729
00:40:48,714 --> 00:40:50,448
Where are you going?

730
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:52,617
Mueller still has to sell those
guns and I have to stop him.

731
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:55,786
Oliver...
He had his chance.

732
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:59,624
28 crates,
four guns in each crate,

733
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:03,494
$250,000 cash.

734
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:05,829
Take it or leave it.

735
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,965
That's the deal.

736
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:38,660
Leo Mueller,

737
00:41:38,661 --> 00:41:41,763
you have failed this city.

738
00:41:43,783 --> 00:41:45,780
