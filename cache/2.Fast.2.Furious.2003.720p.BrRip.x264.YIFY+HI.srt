2
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,765
Yo, Jimmy. Give me the status.
Tell me we good.

3
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:16,601
- You got it, man.
- Beautiful.

4
00:01:17,059 --> 00:01:19,812
It's gonna be an all-timer tonight.

5
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,903
All right, fire them up!

6
00:01:27,445 --> 00:01:29,238
We go live in five!

7
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,451
It's time for ignition
and straight automobile pimping.

8
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:07,026
- Girl!
- Sorry! My bad!

9
00:02:11,947 --> 00:02:14,492
All right, ladies! We're good.

10
00:02:15,284 --> 00:02:16,619
We're good.

11
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,913
That's it, babies.

12
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,543
Come on, Tej!
Let's get this race going!

13
00:02:25,628 --> 00:02:27,338
Wait a second, man.

14
00:02:27,421 --> 00:02:30,174
You cats are first wave.
Where's your fourth at?

15
00:02:30,257 --> 00:02:33,386
It was Joaquin, but he had
to work the graveyard shift.

16
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:35,846
What? Graveyard shift, man.

17
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,601
- Why don't you run with us, Tej?
- Hell, I'm not running with y'all.

18
00:02:40,935 --> 00:02:44,772
I tell you, either you find a fourth
or you don't race. How about that?

19
00:02:44,855 --> 00:02:48,359
We should find two, so we don't have
to roll with skirt here.

20
00:02:53,864 --> 00:02:55,699
Whoa, wait a second.

21
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:59,829
Why don't I find you a fourth
and we settle this on the streets?

22
00:02:59,912 --> 00:03:02,248
- Bring him on.
- Anybody I want?

23
00:03:02,623 --> 00:03:04,625
No matter who it is?

24
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:05,876
Yeah.

25
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:12,508
Yeah?

26
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:14,510
Yeah, man. You want to race tonight?

27
00:03:14,593 --> 00:03:17,513
I could use the money.
You got four minutes.

28
00:03:18,222 --> 00:03:19,557
I'll be there.

29
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,420
The race starts in four minutes.

30
00:03:51,255 --> 00:03:53,340
All right, girls, let's do this.

31
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:07,313
- You think you'll win, baby?
- What do you think?

32
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:10,900
- You better. We got rent to pay.
- I know this.

33
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,261
I'll get you when you
get a car worth racing.

34
00:04:48,437 --> 00:04:49,813
There's our fourth.

35
00:04:49,897 --> 00:04:51,607
Shit. It's Brian.

36
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:23,138
- What's up, Tej?
- What's happening, dude?

37
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:26,266
- Thanks for the invite.
- No problem at all, man.

38
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,852
Just remember me
when you wax, all right?

39
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,855
They got deep pockets?

40
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:34,191
Real deep.

41
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:39,113
- What's up, Suki?
- What's up, Bullitt?

42
00:05:39,196 --> 00:05:40,948
What do you say we kick it a nickel?

43
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:44,618
Nobody mentioned raising stakes.

44
00:05:50,499 --> 00:05:52,751
If that's the case,
ask these nice people...

45
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:55,254
to back off the line
so you can go home.

46
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,809
Okay. $3,500.

47
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:20,195
$3,500?

48
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,532
Either that
or you can go home, bruh.

49
00:06:28,745 --> 00:06:30,914
It's all there.
Better be.

50
00:06:32,082 --> 00:06:35,669
Damn, Suki, when are you
going to pop my clutch?

51
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:37,921
As soon as you get
the right set of tools.

52
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:39,256
All right.

53
00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:01,737
All right, back up. Let's go.

54
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,282
Back y'all asses up!

55
00:07:05,365 --> 00:07:07,868
Back up before
you turn into barbecue around here.

56
00:07:08,118 --> 00:07:10,329
It's not a game. This is serious.

57
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:13,665
All right, back up.
Get off the street. Let's go.

58
00:07:13,832 --> 00:07:17,753
Back it up. Everybody keep
your heads real clear, all right?

59
00:07:17,836 --> 00:07:20,088
'Cause I got a surprise
for y'all this evening.

60
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,010
Go, Slap Jack! Go, baby!

61
00:07:25,093 --> 00:07:26,595
I got this.

62
00:07:36,146 --> 00:07:38,023
Ready?

63
00:07:41,818 --> 00:07:42,986
Go!

64
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:35,455
Oh, hell, no!

65
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,098
You ain't passing me, dawg. Come on.

66
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:57,018
What you got?

67
00:09:03,316 --> 00:09:05,318
I told you, you wouldn't pass me!

68
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:19,458
Move, bitch!

69
00:10:08,548 --> 00:10:09,966
Not tonight, baby!

70
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,968
Bend over, boy.

71
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,890
Damn, girl!

72
00:10:28,151 --> 00:10:29,444
Last turn.

73
00:10:32,155 --> 00:10:33,240
Too wide.

74
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:46,253
Home stretch, baby.

75
00:10:55,053 --> 00:10:56,429
Got to go, dawg!

76
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:16,950
Yes!

77
00:11:28,753 --> 00:11:29,796
I can smell you!

78
00:11:30,255 --> 00:11:31,923
Yo, Jimmy, hit it, baby!

79
00:11:37,345 --> 00:11:39,222
All right. Y'all see that?

80
00:11:40,348 --> 00:11:42,308
I told y'all I had a surprise.

81
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,936
How you like that for a finale?

82
00:11:54,404 --> 00:11:55,447
Bridge.

83
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:38,615
Yeah!

84
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:43,953
Shit!

85
00:12:54,255 --> 00:12:55,757
Oh, hell, no!

86
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:02,347
Smack that ass!

87
00:13:26,871 --> 00:13:27,914
Yes!

88
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:40,051
I saw that, man.
Bullitt and Suki sprayed the bridge.

89
00:13:40,343 --> 00:13:43,054
I need to start making
y'all pay to see this shit.

90
00:13:43,137 --> 00:13:45,890
I got over $10,000
for my man here, all right?

91
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:49,143
That's what I'm talking about, man.
Play with it.

92
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:52,105
- Smells good, don't it?
- How about that?

93
00:13:52,188 --> 00:13:54,691
Right. Y'all see this?
Everybody take a good look.

94
00:13:54,774 --> 00:13:58,069
This is what you call mutual
respect. All right, let's clear out.

95
00:13:58,903 --> 00:14:00,905
Anybody down for another race?

96
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:03,241
Shit.

97
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:10,290
Make sure you bring that body
by the garage later...

98
00:14:10,373 --> 00:14:13,876
so we can work
on that front end of yours.

99
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:16,170
Watch out.

100
00:14:17,297 --> 00:14:18,798
Maybe I will.

101
00:14:26,514 --> 00:14:28,057
Where are you going?

102
00:14:28,891 --> 00:14:31,352
- Time to get out of here.
- Why is that?

103
00:15:05,386 --> 00:15:07,096
Nissan Skyline! Got him!

104
00:15:17,398 --> 00:15:18,983
Shit!

105
00:15:42,465 --> 00:15:43,633
Damn!

106
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:53,851
Let me see your hands!
Put them up!

107
00:15:54,936 --> 00:15:56,646
Yeah, this is him.
We got him.

108
00:16:07,823 --> 00:16:11,869
So, how long
you been in South Florida?

109
00:16:11,953 --> 00:16:13,871
A while.
Before that?

110
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:20,253
We know you're Brian O'Conner,
formerly of the LAPD.

111
00:16:21,128 --> 00:16:23,214
- You got the wrong guy.
- Really?

112
00:16:28,177 --> 00:16:29,929
How you doing, O'Conner?

113
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:34,684
Let's take a walk.

114
00:16:37,603 --> 00:16:38,854
Carter Verone.

115
00:16:39,313 --> 00:16:42,525
Born in Argentina, but he's lived
most of his life in Miami.

116
00:16:43,025 --> 00:16:46,112
Now he owns the biggest
import-export business in the state.

117
00:16:46,195 --> 00:16:49,949
Unfortunately, the cartels have been
successful getting drugs into Miami.

118
00:16:50,032 --> 00:16:52,493
But they've had a hard time
getting the cash out.

119
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:54,370
We've surveilled him for a year.

120
00:16:54,453 --> 00:16:57,164
But we haven't been able to put him
and the money together.

121
00:16:57,248 --> 00:16:59,959
- We've swept his house, warehouses-
- Nothing.

122
00:17:00,418 --> 00:17:03,337
Customs here has done a great job
of getting us this far.

123
00:17:03,421 --> 00:17:05,464
I'm here to help get them
over the top.

124
00:17:05,548 --> 00:17:07,842
I was able to get
an agent in undercover...

125
00:17:07,925 --> 00:17:10,177
working travel and
logistics for him.

126
00:17:10,303 --> 00:17:12,930
Verone's put her in charge
of finding new drivers.

127
00:17:13,014 --> 00:17:16,475
Right, although we can't confirm
her status right now.

128
00:17:16,851 --> 00:17:20,438
- You think she's flipped?
- She's one of mine. She's all right.

129
00:17:20,521 --> 00:17:24,608
She's been in with Verone a year.
Even lives at the compound with him.

130
00:17:24,692 --> 00:17:28,821
Look, it was the FBI's idea
to bring you in. I'm against it.

131
00:17:29,113 --> 00:17:32,992
But we need good drivers to put
this asshole and his money together.

132
00:17:33,284 --> 00:17:35,453
You're gonna roll with Agent Dunn.

133
00:17:35,995 --> 00:17:37,288
And if I don't?

134
00:17:37,747 --> 00:17:40,416
Here's a list of the laws
you broke in L.A.

135
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:44,211
Obstruction of justice, aiding and
abetting. You know the rap sheet.

136
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:47,882
We can make this all go away
in the interest of justice...

137
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:50,801
if you're willing to play ball.

138
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:57,892
What's the idea here? Dunn and I
are supposed to be street racers?

139
00:17:58,017 --> 00:17:59,310
That's right.

140
00:18:05,399 --> 00:18:06,609
So, Dunn...

141
00:18:09,612 --> 00:18:11,864
looks like we're
going to be partners, bro.

142
00:18:11,947 --> 00:18:13,824
Tell me, what would be
a better motor...

143
00:18:13,908 --> 00:18:16,494
for my Skyline,
a Gallo 12 or a Gallo 24?

144
00:18:21,874 --> 00:18:23,125
Twenty four.

145
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,587
I didn't know
pizza places made motors.

146
00:18:29,423 --> 00:18:31,717
See, man, come on, I can't do this.

147
00:18:32,093 --> 00:18:36,263
If this is what you'll give me,
I'll take my chances in Chino.

148
00:18:37,431 --> 00:18:39,141
We'll get someone else.

149
00:18:40,142 --> 00:18:41,602
No way, man.

150
00:18:43,646 --> 00:18:46,941
The only way I'll do this is
if I get to pick the driver.

151
00:18:48,484 --> 00:18:51,153
All right, O'Conner.
Who you got in mind?

152
00:18:51,737 --> 00:18:55,074
- A dude I grew up with in Barstow.
- Who's that?

153
00:18:56,116 --> 00:18:57,409
Roman Pearce.

154
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:24,687
That him in the Monte Carlo?
That's him.

155
00:19:26,313 --> 00:19:28,190
He's got some skills.

156
00:19:28,524 --> 00:19:31,026
And he's crazy as hell,
I'm telling you.

157
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:34,488
In a good way, though.
He's the man for the job.

158
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,955
And he has quite a record,
including three years upstate.

159
00:19:43,414 --> 00:19:45,416
Says here,
he's on house arrest now.

160
00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:48,085
Can't go more than
100 yards from his home.

161
00:20:26,373 --> 00:20:28,334
He always said he'd be famous.

162
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:34,048
Pearce!

163
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:36,675
Roman Pearce!

164
00:20:38,302 --> 00:20:40,637
Whatever happens next,
just let it go.

165
00:20:40,888 --> 00:20:42,139
I ain't in it.

166
00:20:45,392 --> 00:20:46,560
Rome!

167
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:55,152
Only my homeboys call me Rome...

168
00:20:55,652 --> 00:20:56,779
pig.

169
00:21:00,991 --> 00:21:03,702
- I'm not a cop anymore.
- Is that true?

170
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:07,498
Blondie here is not a cop anymore?

171
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:09,875
That's true. No badge.

172
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,347
Here we go.

173
00:21:34,358 --> 00:21:37,319
You still fight like shit.

174
00:21:38,487 --> 00:21:40,322
You better chill.

175
00:21:41,281 --> 00:21:43,700
- Why are you here?
- I'll choke you.

176
00:21:43,784 --> 00:21:45,911
I told you to stay away from me.

177
00:21:50,165 --> 00:21:53,210
You should have told me.
I did three years, Brian.

178
00:21:53,293 --> 00:21:55,003
I told you it wasn't my fault.

179
00:22:05,055 --> 00:22:06,849
Why did you come here?

180
00:22:10,936 --> 00:22:12,604
I got a deal for you.

181
00:22:16,441 --> 00:22:19,486
When I needed your ass,
you were nowhere to be found.

182
00:22:21,196 --> 00:22:23,448
Now you're trying to hand out deals?

183
00:22:26,702 --> 00:22:28,912
I need you to come to Miami
and drive with me.

184
00:22:28,996 --> 00:22:32,291
If you do, they'll take off
that anklet and clear your record.

185
00:22:32,374 --> 00:22:34,501
I did three years in jail.

186
00:22:35,377 --> 00:22:37,296
Three years over you, Brian.

187
00:22:38,297 --> 00:22:41,133
- I know you better than you think.
- Maybe you don't.

188
00:22:41,216 --> 00:22:42,759
Maybe you don't.

189
00:22:43,635 --> 00:22:45,178
You guys finished?

190
00:22:46,054 --> 00:22:47,723
Is this deal legit?

191
00:22:48,307 --> 00:22:50,809
That's right.
If you do this job for us.

192
00:22:51,143 --> 00:22:53,395
- I told you.
- Shut up, punk.

193
00:22:55,188 --> 00:22:58,984
So you'll clean my record
and get this thing off my ankle.

194
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:00,360
That's right.

195
00:23:00,944 --> 00:23:04,239
I thought you couldn't wander
more than 100 yards from your home.

196
00:23:04,323 --> 00:23:06,908
Why do you think
I'm parked so close to the derby?

197
00:23:06,992 --> 00:23:09,328
Quit playing
like you'll pass this up.

198
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:12,497
You stupid...

199
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,445
Wait. Hold on.

200
00:23:45,864 --> 00:23:47,532
Bro, what's going on?

201
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,869
I don't know if
I should be trusting you, man.

202
00:23:53,955 --> 00:23:58,043
Think of it this way. It's a chance
for a fresh start. Let's do this.

203
00:23:58,126 --> 00:24:01,171
I wouldn't need a fresh start
if it wasn't for you.

204
00:24:01,505 --> 00:24:03,757
You've been using that
since you got busted.

205
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,219
- Let's just chill out and do this.
- I don't need to chill out.

206
00:24:07,302 --> 00:24:10,597
Yes, you do. And you need to stop
blaming me for your mistakes.

207
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,975
Roman Pearce needs to start taking
responsibility for his actions.

208
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:17,604
- You need to go to hell.
- You need to go back to Barstow.

209
00:24:20,315 --> 00:24:22,651
I'm not going back
to Barstow.

210
00:24:33,286 --> 00:24:36,706
Brian O'Conner,
Roman Pearce, meet Monica Fuentes.

211
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,543
- They have background on Verone?
- They've been briefed.

212
00:24:39,626 --> 00:24:41,920
Good.
All right, here's the deal.

213
00:24:42,003 --> 00:24:45,090
Verone's looking for drivers.
I arranged for you two to join.

214
00:24:45,173 --> 00:24:47,467
I also hired some thugs
to make it legit.

215
00:24:47,551 --> 00:24:49,719
- When do we start?
- Right now.

216
00:24:50,178 --> 00:24:51,721
What are we driving?

217
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,940
Don't even think about
taking the convertible.

218
00:25:02,023 --> 00:25:03,984
It might loosen your mousse.

219
00:25:04,234 --> 00:25:06,945
That's cool.
Too much chrome for me anyways.

220
00:25:07,028 --> 00:25:11,658
Damn! Where do you all
confiscate these rims from, man?

221
00:25:12,284 --> 00:25:14,536
Check in with us after you meet him.

222
00:25:16,121 --> 00:25:19,166
- You okay with these knuckleheads?
- I can handle them.

223
00:25:19,249 --> 00:25:22,294
- If they trouble you, let me know.
- Thanks, Markham.

224
00:25:25,714 --> 00:25:27,382
I ride with you, cowboy.

225
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:29,593
Why she gotta ride with you?

226
00:25:29,676 --> 00:25:31,845
You get the convertible.
Let's go.

227
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:47,736
Turn right here.

228
00:25:52,324 --> 00:25:54,910
- So, you used to be a cop?
- Yeah.

229
00:25:56,578 --> 00:25:58,330
How long you been under?

230
00:25:59,164 --> 00:26:00,498
I lost track.

231
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:02,584
You all right?

232
00:26:04,628 --> 00:26:07,756
You might want to keep
your eyes on the road, playboy.

233
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:11,134
- You think we're gonna crash?
- I haven't decided yet.

234
00:26:15,972 --> 00:26:17,807
What are you doing, Brian?

235
00:26:27,525 --> 00:26:31,071
He did the "stare and drive" on you,
didn't he? He got that from me.

236
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:08,775
Once we get in here,
you're on your own.

237
00:27:20,662 --> 00:27:22,080
Look at that one.

238
00:27:22,497 --> 00:27:25,792
Where'd you get them cars?
At the bottom of a cereal box?

239
00:27:28,002 --> 00:27:30,046
Real funny, Fonzie.

240
00:27:31,464 --> 00:27:32,632
Ass.

241
00:27:32,841 --> 00:27:35,593
Roberto, Enrique,
I need pictures of the drivers...

242
00:27:35,677 --> 00:27:38,513
their license plates, cars,
and anything else you can find.

243
00:27:51,568 --> 00:27:52,902
Let's go.

244
00:27:55,905 --> 00:27:58,658
Keep your mouth shut
and follow my lead, all right?

245
00:27:58,741 --> 00:28:01,744
- I got this.
- No, I'm serious.

246
00:28:03,121 --> 00:28:05,498
Handle your business.
I'll handle mine.

247
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,004
Watch your hands, bruh.

248
00:28:14,048 --> 00:28:15,383
Go in line.

249
00:28:15,466 --> 00:28:16,926
Let's go.

250
00:28:26,102 --> 00:28:27,270
Carter.

251
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:36,738
The drivers are here.
Good.

252
00:28:37,071 --> 00:28:38,239
Come on.

253
00:28:42,535 --> 00:28:43,620
Stay.

254
00:28:45,955 --> 00:28:47,999
What's going on here?
Tell me.

255
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,544
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

256
00:28:52,962 --> 00:28:55,089
My red Ferrari was confiscated.

257
00:28:55,173 --> 00:28:57,717
It sits in an impound lot
in Little Haiti.

258
00:28:58,092 --> 00:29:00,094
It's about 20 miles from here.

259
00:29:00,386 --> 00:29:04,515
The car isn't important. The package
I left in the glove box is.

260
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:07,018
The first team back here
with the package...

261
00:29:07,101 --> 00:29:09,187
will have an opportunity
to work for me.

262
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,439
What are you saying?
We got to audition?

263
00:29:11,606 --> 00:29:13,650
Nobody has a gun to your head.

264
00:29:16,069 --> 00:29:17,403
That's it.

265
00:29:18,321 --> 00:29:20,740
Driver's licenses. Pass them up.

266
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:23,993
Before Christmas, guys.

267
00:29:27,538 --> 00:29:28,873
Let's go!

268
00:29:48,643 --> 00:29:49,894
Come on, cuz!

269
00:29:53,147 --> 00:29:54,982
Let's see what this thing can do.

270
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:14,293
Agent Markham.
They're heading south on I-95.

271
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:15,712
I got it.

272
00:30:16,337 --> 00:30:18,548
They're running. What a surprise.

273
00:30:29,225 --> 00:30:30,768
Stick with me, Rome.

274
00:30:39,694 --> 00:30:41,446
Why must I chase the cat?

275
00:30:55,793 --> 00:30:57,044
Smart-ass.

276
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:06,804
You think you're the bomb, Rome?

277
00:31:45,843 --> 00:31:48,012
Let's see if you still got it.

278
00:31:49,972 --> 00:31:51,974
I got something for your ass.

279
00:31:58,356 --> 00:31:59,690
Watch this, bro.

280
00:32:08,658 --> 00:32:09,825
Shit.

281
00:32:10,868 --> 00:32:13,037
How do you like them apples?

282
00:32:13,287 --> 00:32:14,538
Show-off!

283
00:32:15,122 --> 00:32:18,084
That's the Brian O'Conner
school of driving, baby!

284
00:32:22,713 --> 00:32:24,423
Crazy-ass white boy!

285
00:32:25,466 --> 00:32:26,634
Shit!

286
00:32:55,538 --> 00:32:57,164
Bumbaclot.

287
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:01,335
You better get out
of the street!

288
00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:03,087
That's some bad shit.

289
00:33:12,763 --> 00:33:14,056
What do we got?

290
00:33:17,268 --> 00:33:19,019
That's good. Show me his partner.

291
00:33:23,107 --> 00:33:24,608
Where are the cars?

292
00:33:31,031 --> 00:33:33,200
Stinking boats. Where are the cars?

293
00:33:43,961 --> 00:33:46,130
I need the cars.
Where are the cars at?

294
00:34:16,535 --> 00:34:18,537
Look in the centre.
What?

295
00:34:21,207 --> 00:34:22,374
Cha-ching!

296
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:25,002
- Now put your blouse back on.
- Hater.

297
00:34:34,053 --> 00:34:35,221
Shit!

298
00:34:39,683 --> 00:34:41,560
- Don't let him get away.
- Not a problem.

299
00:34:41,644 --> 00:34:43,854
Sit on it, Fonzie!

300
00:34:45,064 --> 00:34:46,357
What the hell?

301
00:34:46,774 --> 00:34:47,983
Shit. Cops.

302
00:34:48,692 --> 00:34:49,985
What are they doing here?

303
00:34:50,027 --> 00:34:51,779
Rome, no!

304
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:56,575
Time to go.

305
00:35:00,871 --> 00:35:02,039
Son of a bitch!

306
00:35:02,122 --> 00:35:05,292
Juvy record
for popping cars. Two years in J.D.

307
00:35:05,376 --> 00:35:08,170
Another year for aiding and abetting
an armed robbery.

308
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,257
He's clean. Dirty, but clean.

309
00:35:13,175 --> 00:35:14,260
All right.

310
00:35:34,947 --> 00:35:38,117
Hey, man. You got something
to eat up in there?

311
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:40,285
We hungry.

312
00:35:44,206 --> 00:35:46,083
Sit them by the pool.

313
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:48,419
Nice. Come on.

314
00:35:57,636 --> 00:36:01,181
- What are you checking her out for?
- I'm not checking her out.

315
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:07,563
- Yes, you were.
- No, I wasn't.

316
00:36:08,355 --> 00:36:11,984
- I seen you checking her out.
- Okay, I was. Now shut up.

317
00:36:12,067 --> 00:36:14,570
You shut up.
Don't tell me to shut up.

318
00:36:14,653 --> 00:36:17,865
Both you girlies shut up.
Unbelievable.

319
00:36:29,293 --> 00:36:32,212
You sure are cosy
in this big old mansion.

320
00:36:34,631 --> 00:36:36,675
Sleeping with the enemy.

321
00:36:42,222 --> 00:36:43,932
No, no. Sit down.

322
00:36:45,267 --> 00:36:47,603
Nice Ferrari you got
in the driveway.

323
00:36:49,772 --> 00:36:51,648
I'm glad you like it.

324
00:36:56,195 --> 00:36:58,071
Darling, will you hold that?

325
00:37:06,663 --> 00:37:08,957
We did all that for a damn cigar?

326
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:11,793
No. You did that for a job.

327
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:22,387
Do you really think that
I would let somebody impound my car?

328
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,310
The boatyard is mine.

329
00:37:29,228 --> 00:37:31,563
By the way, you two owe me a gate.

330
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,815
I'll take it off your cut.

331
00:37:36,652 --> 00:37:38,445
- Off our cut?
- Yeah.

332
00:37:39,947 --> 00:37:41,740
I like that.
Good.

333
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:44,618
What's this job
you got for us, anyway?

334
00:37:44,743 --> 00:37:45,911
Come with me.

335
00:37:45,994 --> 00:37:47,829
The house has ears in it.

336
00:37:49,957 --> 00:37:53,835
I have something I want you to carry
from North Beach to the Keys.

337
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:55,128
What is it?

338
00:37:55,212 --> 00:37:57,172
Just put it in the car,
drive it to me...

339
00:37:57,214 --> 00:38:00,008
and don't let anybody
stop you. Understand?

340
00:38:00,425 --> 00:38:02,010
Any chance of cop trouble?

341
00:38:02,094 --> 00:38:05,931
I'm buying you a window of time,
but it won't be open very long.

342
00:38:07,891 --> 00:38:09,434
You make it...

343
00:38:10,644 --> 00:38:13,939
and I'll personally hand you
$100,000 at the finish line.

344
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:16,775
Make it $100,000 apiece.

345
00:38:19,027 --> 00:38:20,487
Look, man...

346
00:38:21,321 --> 00:38:22,781
obviously...

347
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:26,076
your pockets ain't nervous.

348
00:38:27,286 --> 00:38:29,705
- Don't ever touch me.
- Ours are empty.

349
00:38:31,415 --> 00:38:32,958
Like I said...

350
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,127
we hungry.

351
00:38:45,095 --> 00:38:49,558
I got an idea. Why don't you boys
join us at the club later tonight?

352
00:38:49,766 --> 00:38:51,643
Yeah. Pearl at midnight?

353
00:38:51,727 --> 00:38:54,688
- Get to know each other better.
- Sounds good.

354
00:38:56,314 --> 00:38:58,358
See you tonight.
See you.

355
00:39:02,112 --> 00:39:03,447
Hey, you!

356
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:09,119
- Your pockets aren't empty.
- Damn.

357
00:39:09,745 --> 00:39:11,621
I'll take my cutter back.

358
00:39:18,462 --> 00:39:19,880
Stupid ass.

359
00:39:21,381 --> 00:39:25,052
Hey, man, I figured you
had 12 or 13 of these.

360
00:39:25,135 --> 00:39:27,512
You're not too bright.
Get out of here.

361
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:31,683
- You're doing the same stupid shit.
- Get off me.

362
00:39:31,892 --> 00:39:35,771
Look, running your mouth?
Insulting people? Stealing his shit?

363
00:39:36,146 --> 00:39:38,565
You think I'd let someone
stare me down?

364
00:39:38,648 --> 00:39:41,401
I didn't let nobody
stare me down in jail, homeboy.

365
00:39:41,485 --> 00:39:44,029
You think I'm gonna
let it fly on a beach?

366
00:39:44,738 --> 00:39:47,365
"And you, I'll take my cutter back. "

367
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:49,201
His rich ass.

368
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:52,537
- And you're packing.
- Like you ain't.

369
00:39:54,956 --> 00:39:56,249
Exactly.

370
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:00,170
- From here on, I do the talking.
- You want to do more than that.

371
00:40:00,253 --> 00:40:01,671
What does that mean?

372
00:40:01,755 --> 00:40:05,550
It means you always get in trouble
over a female, Brian.

373
00:40:17,145 --> 00:40:19,981
Tej's garage is ridiculous.
He has everything.

374
00:40:20,065 --> 00:40:24,361
Snap-on tools. These lifts are new.
They're only a couple of months old.

375
00:40:24,444 --> 00:40:27,280
- Jimmy. What's up, man?
- What's up, Bullitt?

376
00:40:27,364 --> 00:40:29,241
That's Rome there. Do me a favour.

377
00:40:29,324 --> 00:40:32,953
When you get a second, I want you
to check out the Evo and Spyder.

378
00:40:33,036 --> 00:40:34,955
Where'd you get an Evo from?

379
00:40:35,038 --> 00:40:37,290
- It's a long story.
- I got you, man.

380
00:40:37,374 --> 00:40:38,917
Thanks, Jimmy.

381
00:40:39,209 --> 00:40:42,212
It's so hot and humid,
I can't even wear drawers.

382
00:40:42,295 --> 00:40:44,005
Tell me about it.

383
00:40:44,756 --> 00:40:47,175
Look at all this potential out here.

384
00:40:47,259 --> 00:40:50,554
Ray, don't do that, man.
You're making me lose money.

385
00:40:51,721 --> 00:40:54,683
Come on, stop that.
I know you're better than that.

386
00:40:56,434 --> 00:40:57,602
Damn.

387
00:41:09,864 --> 00:41:13,618
Your boy can help put that fire out!
Look at the bubble-

388
00:41:14,786 --> 00:41:16,288
Let's go.
Serious.

389
00:41:16,371 --> 00:41:18,206
Ray, you're making me
lose money.

390
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:20,875
Don't do that.
Don't do that to me, now.

391
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:22,502
Come on, Ray. Do it.

392
00:41:23,169 --> 00:41:26,339
Tej Parker? This is Roman Pearce.

393
00:41:28,591 --> 00:41:32,887
Basically, he's the man to know in
Miami. Has his finger in everything.

394
00:41:33,054 --> 00:41:34,973
It's just the way it is.

395
00:41:35,181 --> 00:41:37,017
- What's going on?
- What's up?

396
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,601
- How you doing?
- Good.

397
00:41:38,685 --> 00:41:40,437
What's this?
What's the latest?

398
00:41:42,147 --> 00:41:44,566
It's a work in progress.
It's not finished.

399
00:41:44,649 --> 00:41:47,402
That's some artistic shit.
You got talent.

400
00:41:47,485 --> 00:41:51,114
Ray, it's do or die now!
Bring it home, Ray!

401
00:41:52,365 --> 00:41:53,783
Yeah, baby!

402
00:41:54,075 --> 00:41:55,744
Pay up! Pay up!

403
00:41:57,203 --> 00:41:58,997
That's how they do it out here?

404
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,249
- Every day.
- That's crazy.

405
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:04,586
Right here. Right now.
You don't look too happy.

406
00:42:05,003 --> 00:42:09,132
Expeditiously, man. I need it quick.
Thank you. Thank you.

407
00:42:09,424 --> 00:42:13,261
How you feeling, man?
You all right? Thank you.

408
00:42:14,888 --> 00:42:16,347
Not too bad.

409
00:42:18,558 --> 00:42:22,020
I see you're about your money,
homey. You race, too?

410
00:42:23,563 --> 00:42:27,734
No, man. I hit a wall doing
like a buck 20 a couple years ago.

411
00:42:28,026 --> 00:42:30,945
Ever since then, I've just been
organising and collecting.

412
00:42:31,029 --> 00:42:34,908
Check it out. He'll be in town
a while. Can he use that cot?

413
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:38,453
What's wrong with your place?

414
00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:42,582
I don't want to stay with him.
He has bad habits.

415
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:47,962
All right. Show him around.
I'll be up there in a minute.

416
00:42:48,046 --> 00:42:49,380
- Thanks.
- Sure.

417
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:53,176
Who wants a chance
to win their money back?

418
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:57,305
So, Jimmy? You ever seen
anything like this before?

419
00:42:57,514 --> 00:43:00,892
No. Both of them
are wired like I never seen before.

420
00:43:00,975 --> 00:43:02,143
What?

421
00:43:02,227 --> 00:43:04,020
They got us wired with GPS.

422
00:43:04,103 --> 00:43:07,148
That's why Markham knew
we were at that impound lot.

423
00:43:07,941 --> 00:43:11,486
You the master mechanic.
Can't you just yank that shit out?

424
00:43:11,736 --> 00:43:14,030
I'll try, but this ain't LoJack.

425
00:43:14,155 --> 00:43:18,117
The DIS box, the engine management
system, the main harness...

426
00:43:18,284 --> 00:43:20,203
The GPS is spidered into all that.

427
00:43:20,286 --> 00:43:21,830
Tell me something, man.

428
00:43:21,955 --> 00:43:24,415
Do I even want to know
where the Skyline is, dawg?

429
00:43:24,499 --> 00:43:28,253
Or where you've been or where
the hell you got these rides from?

430
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,922
- They're hot.
- Yeah, they hot.

431
00:43:31,005 --> 00:43:35,134
Wired so hot, anyone tracking them
knows if you wear your seat belt.

432
00:43:38,304 --> 00:43:39,639
All right, Jimmy.

433
00:43:39,722 --> 00:43:42,183
- Just do what you can do, bro.
- I got you.

434
00:43:42,267 --> 00:43:43,601
Thanks, man.

435
00:43:43,768 --> 00:43:46,354
We need to get these
on the street ASAP.

436
00:43:47,564 --> 00:43:49,065
Check it out.

437
00:43:49,357 --> 00:43:51,985
See that Cadillac across the street?

438
00:43:56,823 --> 00:43:59,701
They've been on us
since we left Verone's house.

439
00:44:09,586 --> 00:44:12,922
Elian and Fidel!

440
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:16,050
Can I clean your windshield?

441
00:44:16,134 --> 00:44:17,969
What are you doing, man?

442
00:44:20,597 --> 00:44:22,140
Is everything copastetic?

443
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,768
Kiss my ass.

444
00:44:27,312 --> 00:44:28,479
Shit.

445
00:44:31,399 --> 00:44:32,734
Let's go!

446
00:44:38,448 --> 00:44:41,242
He'll blow our cover
before we even get started.

447
00:44:41,576 --> 00:44:44,829
- What went wrong?
- That's what I want to know.

448
00:44:44,912 --> 00:44:47,040
Show me your hands.
Keep them up!

449
00:44:47,123 --> 00:44:49,250
- What's this about?
- What's going on?

450
00:44:49,334 --> 00:44:52,712
Hold this. You think you can
shoot at me? I'm a federal agent.

451
00:44:52,795 --> 00:44:53,921
What are you talking about?

452
00:44:54,005 --> 00:44:57,008
Get your damn hands off me!
Get him away from me, dawg!

453
00:44:57,091 --> 00:45:00,261
'Cause you wear a badge doesn't mean
you can mess shit up for us!

454
00:45:00,345 --> 00:45:02,055
Get your hands off me!

455
00:45:02,138 --> 00:45:04,265
- Lucky I didn't shoot you!
- Shut up!

456
00:45:04,349 --> 00:45:06,017
Don't tell me to shut up!

457
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,436
You almost blew our cover, old man!

458
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:10,563
You shouldn't have shown up
like you did.

459
00:45:10,646 --> 00:45:12,648
You didn't know
Verone was testing us?

460
00:45:12,732 --> 00:45:14,859
I thought you punks were running!

461
00:45:14,942 --> 00:45:17,236
That's great. That's real great!

462
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,157
And if Rome wanted to shoot you?
You wouldn't be here right now.

463
00:45:21,741 --> 00:45:24,035
We got to get this under control.

464
00:45:28,998 --> 00:45:30,458
That's mine!

465
00:45:30,625 --> 00:45:31,793
So?

466
00:45:32,752 --> 00:45:36,380
- Tell me what you know.
- We're making a run for Verone.

467
00:45:36,464 --> 00:45:38,299
I'm not sure when or where...

468
00:45:38,382 --> 00:45:41,803
but he said he bought us a window,
I assume from the local cops.

469
00:45:41,886 --> 00:45:44,388
I can talk to some guys
at the local P.D.

470
00:45:44,722 --> 00:45:47,558
No good. If Verone has some
of them on payroll...

471
00:45:47,642 --> 00:45:49,894
we can't let
them know our operation.

472
00:45:49,977 --> 00:45:51,270
Exactly.

473
00:45:51,646 --> 00:45:55,775
In addition, Verone told us that
he himself will be at the drop.

474
00:45:55,942 --> 00:45:57,652
That's good news.

475
00:45:57,985 --> 00:46:01,781
If you're delivering drug money,
we can get him for laundering.

476
00:46:01,948 --> 00:46:04,283
- Now, there's only one problem.
- What's that?

477
00:46:04,367 --> 00:46:05,660
Fuentes.

478
00:46:05,993 --> 00:46:08,162
- Verone's tapping her.
- Tapping her?

479
00:46:08,496 --> 00:46:10,581
- Tapping her how?
- That is crap.

480
00:46:10,665 --> 00:46:13,042
What you talking about?
We know what we seen.

481
00:46:13,126 --> 00:46:17,255
What do you think, O'Conner?
She's compromised? You should know.

482
00:46:17,672 --> 00:46:21,050
- What does that mean?
- Your pal O'Conner didn't tell you?

483
00:46:21,134 --> 00:46:23,177
He flipped on Bilkins in L.A.

484
00:46:23,261 --> 00:46:26,180
He gave his mark his car keys
and let him disappear.

485
00:46:26,264 --> 00:46:28,599
That's why he's not a cop anymore.

486
00:46:30,726 --> 00:46:33,020
So what do you think, expert?

487
00:46:34,272 --> 00:46:35,523
I don't know.

488
00:46:35,606 --> 00:46:37,942
All right. We'll keep an eye on her.

489
00:46:39,443 --> 00:46:41,195
We're out of here.

490
00:46:47,994 --> 00:46:49,662
Let your man go?

491
00:46:50,204 --> 00:46:52,039
Drop it.
I don't wanna talk about it.

492
00:46:52,123 --> 00:46:55,001
Drop it, hell.
I want to hear about this, homey.

493
00:46:55,251 --> 00:46:57,086
Forget about it, cuz.

494
00:46:57,169 --> 00:46:59,297
We got Fuentes in with Verone...

495
00:47:00,089 --> 00:47:02,049
Markham trying to blow our cover...

496
00:47:02,133 --> 00:47:06,220
and we got two wired cars no better
than that ankle bracelet of mine.

497
00:47:06,304 --> 00:47:10,433
I'll tell you, bruh, you let Markham
do that again in front of Verone...

498
00:47:10,516 --> 00:47:11,893
that'll be our ass!

499
00:47:11,976 --> 00:47:14,186
I know, man.
It's getting thick real quick.

500
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:17,023
We need a way out, got to
come up with an exit strategy.

501
00:47:17,106 --> 00:47:18,983
- Exit strategy?
- Yeah.

502
00:47:21,861 --> 00:47:24,322
I like the way that sounds.
What you got in mind?

503
00:47:24,405 --> 00:47:27,450
I don't know.
But we need two more cars.

504
00:47:35,249 --> 00:47:36,834
Here they come.

505
00:47:55,978 --> 00:47:59,231
Fonzie and Fabio.
Glad you could join us.

506
00:48:00,232 --> 00:48:03,235
We hear you want to get rid
of those Cracker Jack toys.

507
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:04,820
No, we figured your cars...

508
00:48:04,904 --> 00:48:08,074
deserve better drivers,
so we'll take them off your hands.

509
00:48:08,157 --> 00:48:09,700
Why don't we settle this now?

510
00:48:09,784 --> 00:48:12,578
Wait. How about we settle
this on the blacktop?

511
00:48:12,912 --> 00:48:16,707
Each car does a down-and-back,
tag-team style. For slips.

512
00:48:16,916 --> 00:48:18,417
Loser walks home.

513
00:48:18,501 --> 00:48:21,128
- We came to race.
- Load them up then.

514
00:48:24,882 --> 00:48:26,801
Let's get these cars.

515
00:48:28,636 --> 00:48:32,181
Check it out. There's no way
we'll beat these guys straight up.

516
00:48:32,264 --> 00:48:34,683
That Hemi's putting out about 425...

517
00:48:34,809 --> 00:48:38,145
and that Yenko will snap
a speedo in five seconds flat.

518
00:48:38,813 --> 00:48:40,940
We have to pull something
out of our ass.

519
00:48:41,023 --> 00:48:44,360
I think we should save
the spray for the way back.

520
00:48:45,069 --> 00:48:47,363
Done deal.
Let's do this, bro.

521
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:49,782
I'm getting that orange one.

522
00:48:51,784 --> 00:48:53,828
You ain't ready, Fabio!

523
00:48:58,165 --> 00:48:59,291
All right.

524
00:48:59,416 --> 00:49:02,795
You each got a barrel to go around
down at the end of the road.

525
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:06,757
Second wave's got to sit tight till
your partner crosses this line here.

526
00:49:06,841 --> 00:49:09,885
First team to go down and back twice
wins the race.

527
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:11,971
At which point...

528
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:16,725
the losers will hand over them keys.

529
00:49:16,809 --> 00:49:20,312
Or you'll be eating breakfast
through straws from now on.

530
00:49:23,732 --> 00:49:25,067
I get it.

531
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:28,487
This means you, too.

532
00:49:29,321 --> 00:49:30,489
I got it.

533
00:49:30,573 --> 00:49:32,658
All right. Let's race.

534
00:49:36,954 --> 00:49:40,249
Come on, baby, you got this, Rome!
This dude ain't serious.

535
00:49:40,332 --> 00:49:43,794
Yeah, you gone, homey.
I got this. This is done.

536
00:49:45,379 --> 00:49:46,839
You about to lose your car.

537
00:49:46,922 --> 00:49:49,049
- Do it, Rome!
- Come on, you got it, man.

538
00:49:49,133 --> 00:49:53,345
Think I'm worried about this fool?
This is nothing!

539
00:50:04,064 --> 00:50:06,275
- Oh, no.
- American muscle.

540
00:50:09,028 --> 00:50:11,864
Your engine ain't as big
as your mouth.

541
00:50:17,036 --> 00:50:19,705
Got to smoke him.

542
00:50:19,788 --> 00:50:21,123
All right, here we go!

543
00:50:21,206 --> 00:50:24,209
- It's all right, I'll handle this.
- Handle it.

544
00:50:25,127 --> 00:50:28,088
Ready, and... go!

545
00:50:34,553 --> 00:50:37,348
You ain't ready!
I run these streets!

546
00:50:46,982 --> 00:50:49,568
Romey Rome! You ain't heard of me?

547
00:51:07,461 --> 00:51:08,796
Oh, shit.

548
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:14,927
Oh, yeah!

549
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:21,642
I'm gonna get you.

550
00:51:23,727 --> 00:51:25,437
Where's your big mouth now?

551
00:51:25,521 --> 00:51:27,856
That car's going home with me.

552
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,953
Shit. Eat this, sucker!

553
00:51:55,134 --> 00:51:56,301
Shit!

554
00:52:00,597 --> 00:52:03,100
Yeah, boy! Go, Korpi!

555
00:52:06,311 --> 00:52:09,231
Sorry, blondie,
how does that dust taste?

556
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:13,152
I don't know.

557
00:52:14,153 --> 00:52:15,696
Come on, Rome.

558
00:52:44,183 --> 00:52:45,475
What the...

559
00:52:45,559 --> 00:52:48,604
Good move, kid.
Let's see if you got the balls.

560
00:53:11,752 --> 00:53:13,086
Shit, come on.

561
00:53:23,055 --> 00:53:25,265
Come on, Brian, bring it home, man!

562
00:54:07,808 --> 00:54:09,643
We got two new cars!

563
00:54:11,144 --> 00:54:12,312
Damn!

564
00:54:19,569 --> 00:54:22,447
Y'all ain't ready!
Get to walking, Fabio!

565
00:54:23,907 --> 00:54:25,909
Use them bus tokens!

566
00:54:33,542 --> 00:54:35,544
How are you?
What's your name?

567
00:54:35,627 --> 00:54:37,003
We're Mr. Verone's guests.

568
00:54:47,347 --> 00:54:49,266
It's a hoasis in here.

569
00:54:49,766 --> 00:54:52,269
Yeah, lots of potential.

570
00:54:54,104 --> 00:54:56,398
Damn. You got a pen?

571
00:54:59,568 --> 00:55:01,695
It's about to get serious.

572
00:55:02,404 --> 00:55:04,865
Look at that girl on the swing.

573
00:55:04,948 --> 00:55:09,077
You guys did something right.
He never socialises with hired help.

574
00:55:09,161 --> 00:55:11,246
Now what's that make you?

575
00:55:11,705 --> 00:55:14,040
- Where's he at?
- He's on his way.

576
00:55:14,124 --> 00:55:16,293
You and Verone
don't go everywhere together?

577
00:55:16,376 --> 00:55:19,171
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

578
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:25,302
- I'm gonna go take a piss.
- You go do that.

579
00:55:29,723 --> 00:55:31,433
What is his deal?

580
00:55:31,808 --> 00:55:33,935
He doesn't trust people
who carry badges.

581
00:55:34,019 --> 00:55:36,021
You talk like you know.

582
00:55:38,565 --> 00:55:43,069
I'd been a cop about two months when
Roman was busted in a garage raid.

583
00:55:43,361 --> 00:55:47,032
He had eight sets of wheels
in his possession, each of them hot.

584
00:55:47,115 --> 00:55:48,867
So you busted him?

585
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:53,079
I didn't know it was going down.
But that doesn't really matter.

586
00:55:54,664 --> 00:55:59,336
Once I became a cop, Roman saw me
as a friend who became the enemy.

587
00:56:05,759 --> 00:56:08,386
Is there anything I can get for you,
Mr. Verone?

588
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:10,513
Just tell them
to come join me.

589
00:56:17,437 --> 00:56:19,272
I was admiring this.

590
00:56:29,115 --> 00:56:30,283
Damn.

591
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:33,536
I'm not giving it to you. What's up?

592
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:34,996
He's here.

593
00:56:35,497 --> 00:56:37,040
Where's he at?

594
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:38,833
He's over there. Don't look.

595
00:56:42,879 --> 00:56:45,966
Excuse me, Mr. Verone
would like for you to join him.

596
00:56:46,508 --> 00:56:47,968
Let's do it.

597
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:50,679
See what I'm talking about?

598
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,934
It's all right, let them in.

599
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,730
Go sit down,
I'll talk to you in a second.

600
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,150
- How you doing?
- Good. Enjoying your night?

601
00:57:04,234 --> 00:57:06,569
- Yeah, I'm having a good time.
- Good.

602
00:57:08,822 --> 00:57:10,699
She's beautiful, isn't she?

603
00:57:17,455 --> 00:57:18,623
Yeah.

604
00:57:19,499 --> 00:57:21,084
She's gorgeous.

605
00:57:27,674 --> 00:57:29,467
You got balls, kid.

606
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:32,262
I appreciate that.

607
00:57:33,221 --> 00:57:35,390
Women are a powerful force.

608
00:57:37,016 --> 00:57:40,645
You see the blonde sitting
with the gentleman right here?

609
00:57:44,649 --> 00:57:48,903
Five minutes of her time, and she
can get anything she wants from him.

610
00:57:49,195 --> 00:57:50,822
I love your hair.

611
00:57:50,905 --> 00:57:52,115
Watch.

612
00:57:58,246 --> 00:58:00,957
I wonder where they're going?
Sit down.

613
00:58:03,209 --> 00:58:06,588
So you lit my man's car on fire.
Is that right?

614
00:58:08,381 --> 00:58:09,549
Yeah.

615
00:58:10,592 --> 00:58:11,801
I did.

616
00:58:13,678 --> 00:58:16,806
I got a problem with authority.

617
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,144
I have that same problem.

618
00:58:21,686 --> 00:58:25,482
For me, it's cops in particular.

619
00:58:37,744 --> 00:58:39,621
Let's take a walk. Come on.

620
00:58:39,704 --> 00:58:42,624
We just got here.
And now we're leaving.

621
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,834
Let's go.

622
00:58:52,967 --> 00:58:54,010
Hey.

623
00:58:54,093 --> 00:58:55,220
Come on.

624
00:59:17,784 --> 00:59:19,452
What's all that?

625
00:59:21,663 --> 00:59:24,165
We're going to have a little fun.

626
00:59:30,922 --> 00:59:32,298
Thank you.

627
00:59:33,049 --> 00:59:37,470
- It'll be fun. Let's stay longer.
- Yeah.

628
00:59:40,682 --> 00:59:41,933
Hey, Carter.

629
00:59:42,392 --> 00:59:44,477
Meet Detective Whitworth.

630
00:59:46,604 --> 00:59:48,523
One of Miami's finest.

631
00:59:49,357 --> 00:59:51,192
Thank you, sweetheart.

632
00:59:51,276 --> 00:59:53,069
You enjoying yourself, Detective?

633
00:59:53,152 --> 00:59:54,612
Yeah, I was.

634
00:59:55,446 --> 00:59:57,699
I mean, you know me.

635
00:59:58,074 --> 00:59:59,242
Yeah.

636
00:59:59,826 --> 01:00:01,369
I do know you.

637
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:05,081
You've been on my payroll
a long time.

638
01:00:05,164 --> 01:00:07,750
- Verone, that ain't right.
- Shut up.

639
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:12,422
I've got one last job for you.
You hear me?

640
01:00:12,505 --> 01:00:14,924
- We've been through this.
- Yeah?

641
01:00:15,258 --> 01:00:17,135
And I said I can't do it.

642
01:00:18,761 --> 01:00:21,347
That's the wrong answer.
The table.

643
01:00:26,978 --> 01:00:28,980
I'm a detective, Verone!

644
01:00:29,063 --> 01:00:33,151
You do anything to me, the whole
force'll be on your ass in a minute.

645
01:00:33,234 --> 01:00:36,362
Shut your mouth,
you fat piece of shit.

646
01:00:37,238 --> 01:00:38,823
Stop right now.

647
01:00:45,038 --> 01:00:46,581
What the hell?

648
01:00:46,789 --> 01:00:48,124
Sit down.

649
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:51,502
You're going to regret this.
Stop right now!

650
01:00:51,586 --> 01:00:54,130
Once the bucket
gets hot enough, Detective...

651
01:00:54,213 --> 01:00:56,924
the rat is gonna want out.

652
01:00:58,718 --> 01:01:01,554
And the only direction it can go,
is south.

653
01:01:05,725 --> 01:01:07,101
Hold that.

654
01:01:07,602 --> 01:01:09,145
Get it off me!

655
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:10,354
I'll forget it-

656
01:01:10,438 --> 01:01:11,731
Shut up.

657
01:01:12,607 --> 01:01:17,278
Did you know that your average rat
can chew through a steel drainpipe?

658
01:01:18,613 --> 01:01:21,866
You have nothing to worry about
when he's screaming.

659
01:01:21,949 --> 01:01:24,702
It's when he goes quiet
that he goes to work.

660
01:01:24,786 --> 01:01:26,454
Stop it!

661
01:01:27,789 --> 01:01:31,167
You can't be this stupid!
Stop it now!

662
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:34,754
You're in charge of the units
that are watching my properties.

663
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:37,840
What I want is a 15-minute window...

664
01:01:37,924 --> 01:01:40,635
where everybody,
and I mean everybody, disappears.

665
01:01:40,718 --> 01:01:43,221
- I can't do it!
- You can't?

666
01:01:45,306 --> 01:01:46,599
Stop it.

667
01:01:46,682 --> 01:01:48,976
Okay. Monica, come here.

668
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:50,561
Help!

669
01:01:51,604 --> 01:01:53,064
Shut him up.

670
01:01:54,273 --> 01:01:55,942
Help!

671
01:02:02,114 --> 01:02:03,574
It's biting me!

672
01:02:05,284 --> 01:02:06,452
What?

673
01:02:08,454 --> 01:02:10,456
Got something you want to say?

674
01:02:12,083 --> 01:02:14,126
It bit me. Jesus.

675
01:02:15,253 --> 01:02:17,547
- I'll do it!
- Do what? Say it.

676
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:20,383
I'll do it.
I'll give you your window.

677
01:02:21,592 --> 01:02:23,261
Just get it off me.

678
01:02:23,344 --> 01:02:24,762
Get it off!

679
01:02:26,847 --> 01:02:28,516
You betray me...

680
01:02:29,225 --> 01:02:31,018
and my rat here...

681
01:02:31,894 --> 01:02:34,480
is gonna visit your wife, Lynn...

682
01:02:34,897 --> 01:02:37,525
your son, Clay,
and your daughter, Lexi.

683
01:02:37,608 --> 01:02:40,194
Do you hear me?
Do you understand me?

684
01:02:40,528 --> 01:02:42,321
- Hear me?
- Get it off.

685
01:02:42,405 --> 01:02:45,408
I'll burn your fucking eyes out!
I'll burn them out.

686
01:02:48,911 --> 01:02:50,830
Now, you can go.

687
01:02:51,747 --> 01:02:54,417
Get rid of him. Let's go.
Get it off.

688
01:03:03,926 --> 01:03:05,761
You boys enjoy the show?

689
01:03:06,387 --> 01:03:10,016
Fifteen minutes, and then every cop
in Florida's gonna be on you.

690
01:03:10,099 --> 01:03:14,061
Be at Versailles Cafè at 6:00 a.m,
day after tomorrow, ready to drive.

691
01:03:14,145 --> 01:03:16,105
- You understand?
- Yeah.

692
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:18,190
Don't play games with me...

693
01:03:18,733 --> 01:03:21,152
or you'll be next. All right?

694
01:03:21,777 --> 01:03:24,697
Help yourself to a little champagne.
Let's go.

695
01:03:27,783 --> 01:03:29,618
That was a damn rat.

696
01:03:39,295 --> 01:03:43,799
You ever touch another man again,
and I'll kill you.

697
01:03:44,008 --> 01:03:45,468
You hear me?

698
01:03:47,094 --> 01:03:49,138
Look at me. You hear me?

699
01:03:56,437 --> 01:03:59,065
She was into it.
What's that about?

700
01:03:59,648 --> 01:04:02,234
You seen the way she grabbed
the dude's head.

701
01:04:02,318 --> 01:04:06,822
She had to. He was testing her.
Her ass is on the line, like ours.

702
01:04:07,698 --> 01:04:09,784
You're feeling this girl
way too much.

703
01:04:09,867 --> 01:04:13,537
She's like that trailer rat
from back in the day, Tanya.

704
01:04:13,621 --> 01:04:16,749
Tanya? Man, you went out with her
after I did.

705
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,044
I couldn't let it go to waste.

706
01:04:20,127 --> 01:04:21,504
I got you.

707
01:04:22,087 --> 01:04:23,589
Is that right?

708
01:04:23,672 --> 01:04:26,592
We go race for cash,
but when I step on the gas...

709
01:04:26,675 --> 01:04:29,845
my nitrous go blast,
leave your ass in the past.

710
01:04:29,929 --> 01:04:32,181
Tej, you about
to lose your garage.

711
01:04:32,264 --> 01:04:33,682
Whatever, man.

712
01:04:33,766 --> 01:04:36,435
I'm a low-budget mechanic,
but I overcharge.

713
01:04:36,519 --> 01:04:39,313
Pay me! Let's go, man.

714
01:04:39,605 --> 01:04:41,273
Pay me my money.

715
01:04:41,357 --> 01:04:44,485
I'm glad you're happy.
This is my garage.

716
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:47,488
Royal flush. Give me this, man.

717
01:04:47,947 --> 01:04:49,406
Talk to him.

718
01:04:49,573 --> 01:04:54,119
Put that money back on the table.
You know it's mine next hand.

719
01:04:54,203 --> 01:04:58,249
Jimmy, how're you gonna pay me back
if you keep losing to Tej like that?

720
01:04:58,499 --> 01:05:01,502
I'm going to crash, Tej.
I'll catch you tomorrow.

721
01:05:17,893 --> 01:05:19,228
What are you doing here?

722
01:05:19,311 --> 01:05:23,190
They're gonna kill you. I heard him
telling Enrique and Roberto.

723
01:05:23,274 --> 01:05:26,402
Once you finish the run, they're
putting a bullet in your head.

724
01:05:26,735 --> 01:05:28,571
You sure you heard him right?

725
01:05:28,821 --> 01:05:29,863
I'm sure.

726
01:05:37,454 --> 01:05:39,540
Verone's boys is outside...

727
01:05:40,082 --> 01:05:44,003
I see what they're looking for.
Your little girlfriend here.

728
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:51,760
- They don't know. I snuck out.
- What are they doing here then?

729
01:05:51,844 --> 01:05:53,846
I don't know.
Maybe they're guessing.

730
01:05:54,305 --> 01:05:56,807
Go stall them for,
like, two minutes.

731
01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:58,851
Check her, homey.

732
01:06:04,023 --> 01:06:06,358
Found what you're
looking for?

733
01:06:10,738 --> 01:06:13,365
Hey, buddy. Hi, guys. How you doing?

734
01:06:15,242 --> 01:06:17,369
Y'all still mad about y'all car?

735
01:06:17,453 --> 01:06:20,372
Don't even trip.
Come on, man, can't you take a joke?

736
01:06:21,248 --> 01:06:24,335
This isn't about being a good cop
or doing your job.

737
01:06:24,418 --> 01:06:26,462
They're gonna kill you.
You gotta pull out.

738
01:06:26,545 --> 01:06:28,797
Verone pay you
to keep a straight face like that?

739
01:06:28,881 --> 01:06:32,885
'Cause if I was making money,
I'd remove that mole off my nose.

740
01:06:32,968 --> 01:06:34,970
- Okay?
- Yeah.

741
01:06:35,054 --> 01:06:37,222
How much he pay y'all anyway?

742
01:06:37,306 --> 01:06:40,851
Every time I see y'all,
y'all got the silk shirts on...

743
01:06:40,934 --> 01:06:43,187
jewellery, looking real Miami.

744
01:06:43,687 --> 01:06:48,233
I caught you walking up in the club,
the hamburger meat all hanging out.

745
01:06:50,152 --> 01:06:52,696
Don't make that run, Brian.

746
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:54,948
Be careful.

747
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:11,799
Where are you going?
You stay right here with us, buddy.

748
01:07:20,724 --> 01:07:22,559
Don't even think about it.

749
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:37,699
Stay your ass off my homeboy's boat.

750
01:07:44,581 --> 01:07:47,376
Put the gun down now!

751
01:07:47,668 --> 01:07:49,378
You first, asshole!

752
01:07:49,461 --> 01:07:51,296
I'll shoot the shit out of him!

753
01:07:56,593 --> 01:08:01,306
Put down the gun!

754
01:08:02,266 --> 01:08:03,892
Enough.

755
01:08:04,268 --> 01:08:06,144
Shut up.

756
01:08:07,855 --> 01:08:09,648
It's over. Come on.

757
01:08:10,148 --> 01:08:11,692
It's over. Let's go.

758
01:08:12,693 --> 01:08:14,987
It's our gun. Come on, let's go.

759
01:08:20,284 --> 01:08:22,995
I'm glad to see you boys
are getting along so well...

760
01:08:23,078 --> 01:08:27,833
because tomorrow, Roberto and
Enrique'll be riding along with you.

761
01:08:28,292 --> 01:08:30,377
Just so we don't have any problems.

762
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:32,379
I'll see you guys in a bit.

763
01:08:36,258 --> 01:08:38,385
What the hell
was she doing in there?

764
01:08:49,146 --> 01:08:51,398
Where'd you go this morning?

765
01:08:51,523 --> 01:08:54,067
I went to breakfast
with some friends.

766
01:08:59,781 --> 01:09:01,283
With friends?

767
01:09:03,243 --> 01:09:05,370
I do have friends, Carter.

768
01:09:12,044 --> 01:09:13,211
Okay.

769
01:09:15,213 --> 01:09:16,757
I'll see you later.

770
01:09:26,099 --> 01:09:27,517
Nice shirt, Bilkins.

771
01:09:27,601 --> 01:09:29,269
It's my day off.

772
01:09:31,355 --> 01:09:33,065
Well, anyhow, this is the deal.

773
01:09:33,607 --> 01:09:36,943
Last night, Verone threatened a cop
into giving us a window.

774
01:09:37,027 --> 01:09:40,322
We're driving to an airstrip
in the Keys, off Nallwood Avenue.

775
01:09:40,405 --> 01:09:43,033
Verone has a plane there
and he's taking off for good.

776
01:09:43,116 --> 01:09:44,993
Wait a minute. How do you know this?

777
01:09:45,285 --> 01:09:46,536
Monica.

778
01:09:46,953 --> 01:09:49,748
She's doing her job. She warned us.

779
01:09:49,831 --> 01:09:51,291
She warned you about what?

780
01:09:51,375 --> 01:09:53,835
Verone plans to kill us
after we give him the money.

781
01:09:53,919 --> 01:09:57,297
Driving into an ambush
wasn't the deal. I'm calling it off.

782
01:09:57,381 --> 01:10:00,717
Like hell you are.
This is a Customs case, Bilkins.

783
01:10:00,801 --> 01:10:02,969
No one's calling this off
unless I do.

784
01:10:03,053 --> 01:10:04,888
Look, this is real simple.

785
01:10:05,430 --> 01:10:09,768
Make the run, get Verone and his
cash together, so I can move in.

786
01:10:09,851 --> 01:10:13,063
You don't, I'll file enough charges
on you to make you disappear.

787
01:10:13,146 --> 01:10:14,564
Take these.

788
01:10:14,648 --> 01:10:18,068
We're gonna have GPS on you
so you don't get any cute ideas.

789
01:10:18,151 --> 01:10:20,320
And to make sure
nothing happens to them, right?

790
01:10:20,403 --> 01:10:21,863
Yeah, right.

791
01:10:30,705 --> 01:10:32,457
That guy's a dick.

792
01:10:35,502 --> 01:10:37,462
Let me get this right.

793
01:10:37,838 --> 01:10:40,423
If we don't do this,
then we go to jail.

794
01:10:40,799 --> 01:10:43,760
But if we do it,
then Verone's going to kill us.

795
01:10:43,927 --> 01:10:47,013
- It's a hell of a deal, huh?
- Yeah.

796
01:10:48,598 --> 01:10:50,058
Maybe it is.

797
01:10:51,601 --> 01:10:55,939
This guy's got an ass full of loot
that he's ready to dump in our cars.

798
01:10:56,273 --> 01:11:00,443
I can think of two reasons why
he doesn't need that money anymore.

799
01:11:00,527 --> 01:11:01,903
Here we go.

800
01:11:01,987 --> 01:11:03,405
You and me.

801
01:11:03,613 --> 01:11:05,240
Just like the old days.

802
01:11:05,323 --> 01:11:09,619
- What do you think?
- They messed with the wrong guys.

803
01:11:12,747 --> 01:11:14,958
- Tej, what's up, bro?
- What's up?

804
01:11:15,041 --> 01:11:16,668
How quickly can you organise?

805
01:11:16,751 --> 01:11:19,546
Look, if y'all really want
to carry out this plan...

806
01:11:19,629 --> 01:11:23,091
this is the best place to do it.
What do y'all think?

807
01:11:23,174 --> 01:11:25,760
I think it's perfect.
So, what do they store here?

808
01:11:31,766 --> 01:11:33,101
This thing is clean.

809
01:11:33,184 --> 01:11:34,394
Distributor cap.

810
01:11:49,075 --> 01:11:53,913
Jimmy, do we have any half-empty
bottles of nitrous lying around?

811
01:11:53,997 --> 01:11:56,082
Sure, but I've already
loaded you for spray.

812
01:11:56,166 --> 01:11:58,835
I'm thinking we may need it
for something else...

813
01:11:58,918 --> 01:12:01,713
'cause our cars may get
a little crowded, you know?

814
01:12:10,055 --> 01:12:12,599
When did you start eating so much?

815
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,477
I was in jail, bruh.

816
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:18,647
I know how shitty the grub is
on the inside.

817
01:12:19,773 --> 01:12:22,400
The way things are shaping up
out here right now...

818
01:12:22,484 --> 01:12:25,695
it'll be a matter of time
before I'm back in there, or dead.

819
01:12:27,197 --> 01:12:30,200
So I'm trying to eat all I can
while I can.

820
01:12:31,826 --> 01:12:35,121
Plus, the doctor tells me
I got a high metabolism.

821
01:12:39,834 --> 01:12:41,836
You remember us growing up?

822
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:44,714
Playing football in the dirt?

823
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:49,010
Getting into trouble.
All the stupid things we did?

824
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:53,223
When you got busted,
whether I was a cop or not...

825
01:12:53,306 --> 01:12:55,558
if there was anything
I could have done...

826
01:12:56,434 --> 01:12:58,311
I would have done it.

827
01:12:58,895 --> 01:13:01,064
I just want you to know that.

828
01:13:01,689 --> 01:13:04,192
Is that why
you let that dude go in L.A.?

829
01:13:06,444 --> 01:13:09,155
Yeah, I think
that had a lot to do with it.

830
01:13:11,408 --> 01:13:13,243
When I got busted...

831
01:13:13,827 --> 01:13:14,994
it wasn't your fault.

832
01:13:16,204 --> 01:13:19,499
It was all on me, Mr. Roman Pearce.

833
01:13:20,083 --> 01:13:22,127
Wild and out. Crazy man.

834
01:13:23,169 --> 01:13:25,338
No one could tell me nothing.

835
01:13:25,422 --> 01:13:26,881
Riding solo.

836
01:13:27,507 --> 01:13:28,967
Yeah, well, not anymore.

837
01:13:34,722 --> 01:13:36,432
Not anymore, bro.

838
01:14:01,791 --> 01:14:04,085
I've got Verone's Navigator
leaving the residence.

839
01:14:04,169 --> 01:14:05,336
Copy.

840
01:14:06,045 --> 01:14:08,548
Sir, we've got Verone on the move
to the airstrip.

841
01:14:08,631 --> 01:14:11,426
Let's get a bird in the air.
Tell him to keep his distance.

842
01:14:14,053 --> 01:14:15,513
- Ready.
- Thanks.

843
01:14:17,223 --> 01:14:19,267
- You're all set.
- Thanks.

844
01:14:19,851 --> 01:14:22,520
- All set?
- Yeah. Let's do it.

845
01:14:25,607 --> 01:14:26,858
Report.

846
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:31,237
What's going on
out there?

847
01:14:32,864 --> 01:14:34,073
Team One, checking in.

848
01:14:34,157 --> 01:14:36,868
- Team Two, checking in.
- Team Three, checking in.

849
01:14:36,951 --> 01:14:39,120
Team Four,
all clear here, too.

850
01:14:39,662 --> 01:14:41,581
Team Five, checking in.

851
01:14:42,373 --> 01:14:44,208
Team Six, all clear.

852
01:14:49,631 --> 01:14:52,342
- Here we go.
- Yeah, so you know what to do.

853
01:14:52,425 --> 01:14:54,469
Stay cool. Keep focused.

854
01:14:54,844 --> 01:14:57,430
Remember the airstrip's
off Nallwood Avenue.

855
01:14:57,513 --> 01:14:59,766
It's the third exit
after the bridge.

856
01:15:01,434 --> 01:15:02,685
Got it.

857
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:04,729
You ready for this?

858
01:15:04,812 --> 01:15:08,441
Come on, man.
Guns, murderers, and crooked cops?

859
01:15:08,608 --> 01:15:10,360
I was made for this, bruh!

860
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:47,313
Come on.

861
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,923
I got activity
at Verone's trailer property.

862
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:17,218
Do not move an inch
until I tell you to!

863
01:16:42,201 --> 01:16:43,494
Load up.

864
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:47,582
All units...

865
01:16:47,665 --> 01:16:50,710
move on the trailer property.
Right now! Move!

866
01:16:57,633 --> 01:17:00,553
Shit. Local P.D.
is moving in on our guys.

867
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:03,472
- Three bags in one car?
- Guess so.

868
01:17:16,861 --> 01:17:18,196
The cops.

869
01:17:22,491 --> 01:17:23,910
I am not going back to jail.

870
01:17:23,993 --> 01:17:26,162
Where are you going, man? Let's go!

871
01:17:27,538 --> 01:17:29,248
What is he doing?

872
01:17:50,686 --> 01:17:54,148
Now let's get the chopper over them.
I want eyes right on top.

873
01:17:54,231 --> 01:17:55,316
You got it.

874
01:17:55,399 --> 01:17:56,442
Lima 2-5...

875
01:17:56,525 --> 01:17:58,069
follow GPS.

876
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:08,746
Do you know what you're doing?

877
01:18:11,832 --> 01:18:14,251
Stay with me, Rome. Come on, man.

878
01:18:22,551 --> 01:18:25,054
I've got them heading south
on I-95.

879
01:18:25,137 --> 01:18:27,223
Bring in the aerial ESDs.

880
01:18:36,857 --> 01:18:38,025
Oh, shit!

881
01:18:41,362 --> 01:18:44,240
- They're catching up, man!
- Shut up, man!

882
01:18:56,001 --> 01:18:57,795
Nice driving, Rome.

883
01:18:58,003 --> 01:18:59,714
I got you, Brian.

884
01:19:04,844 --> 01:19:06,345
Check it out!

885
01:19:18,899 --> 01:19:20,443
What was that?

886
01:19:31,078 --> 01:19:32,246
Oh, shit!

887
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:48,679
- Come on, man. Take the wheel.
- No. I can't drive.

888
01:19:48,762 --> 01:19:52,057
Just hold the wheel!
Put your hands on it! Hold steady!

889
01:19:55,811 --> 01:19:57,605
What are you doing, man?

890
01:20:52,326 --> 01:20:53,661
Yeah, man!

891
01:21:09,677 --> 01:21:10,844
Hold.

892
01:21:13,389 --> 01:21:15,849
Bilkins, the bird's in place.

893
01:21:19,687 --> 01:21:20,854
Yeah.

894
01:21:22,648 --> 01:21:23,983
We've got Verone's Navigator.

895
01:21:24,066 --> 01:21:26,986
All right. Money's in transit.
Sit tight.

896
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:13,657
You're a good driver, man.

897
01:22:13,741 --> 01:22:15,743
Thanks, bro.

898
01:22:20,622 --> 01:22:24,543
We've got the area blocked ahead.
They've got nowhere to go.

899
01:22:33,635 --> 01:22:35,179
What was that?

900
01:22:35,971 --> 01:22:37,181
I've got a visual.

901
01:22:37,848 --> 01:22:39,975
Video should be coming through.

902
01:22:40,058 --> 01:22:41,935
I got it. Looks good.

903
01:22:43,562 --> 01:22:45,439
Where are they going?

904
01:22:53,739 --> 01:22:54,907
Shit.

905
01:23:00,287 --> 01:23:03,582
All right, Miami's finest,
let's see what you got.

906
01:23:04,291 --> 01:23:06,460
Come on. Stay with me, boys.

907
01:23:12,466 --> 01:23:14,801
Hey, man, everyone's here.
Time for the show.

908
01:23:14,885 --> 01:23:16,803
Let's give it to them.

909
01:23:21,058 --> 01:23:23,936
All right, let the party begin.
Let's go!

910
01:23:42,746 --> 01:23:46,208
This is unit 25-99.
We have the suspects surrounded.

911
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:39,386
Holy shit!

912
01:24:45,392 --> 01:24:47,894
It's a scramble, baby! A big one!

913
01:24:53,859 --> 01:24:55,694
Yeah! Let's do this!

914
01:25:03,702 --> 01:25:05,287
Check this out.

915
01:25:13,587 --> 01:25:15,338
We're not tracking them
on the video.

916
01:25:15,422 --> 01:25:17,883
We must have lost them
in the scramble.

917
01:25:17,966 --> 01:25:19,634
Yo, let's break.

918
01:25:21,094 --> 01:25:22,262
Yeah!

919
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:07,766
All right, we got them going west
on Beach.

920
01:26:07,849 --> 01:26:09,976
Roger that! I've got them!

921
01:26:22,072 --> 01:26:25,408
Customs has a fix on two cars
going west on Beach.

922
01:26:25,825 --> 01:26:27,661
Roger. Follow those cars.

923
01:26:27,744 --> 01:26:29,162
Roger that.

924
01:26:51,268 --> 01:26:52,435
Shit.

925
01:26:53,478 --> 01:26:55,188
They're cornered.

926
01:26:59,442 --> 01:27:02,153
Keep your hands
where I can see them!

927
01:27:02,237 --> 01:27:03,571
Hands up!

928
01:27:04,114 --> 01:27:08,034
I know my tags are out of date,
but damn.

929
01:27:16,209 --> 01:27:17,752
What the hell?

930
01:27:19,087 --> 01:27:20,672
Where are they?

931
01:27:42,777 --> 01:27:44,279
How about them apples, man?

932
01:27:44,362 --> 01:27:47,449
Yeah! That's some driving
for your ass, baby!

933
01:27:48,867 --> 01:27:49,951
Good job, man.

934
01:27:50,035 --> 01:27:52,037
- What are you talking about?
- Whatever.

935
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:54,080
You're supposed to be
a stone-faced killer!

936
01:27:54,164 --> 01:27:55,999
You were grabbing your seat belt!

937
01:27:56,082 --> 01:27:59,586
Hey, Tej, thanks a lot, bro.
You're clutch. I owe you big time.

938
01:27:59,669 --> 01:28:03,339
Yeah, Brian, you really do owe me.
You really do...

939
01:28:04,215 --> 01:28:05,258
Us.

940
01:28:05,467 --> 01:28:07,886
Suki says you owe us, all right?

941
01:28:10,263 --> 01:28:12,849
- Rome, you there? Come in.
- What's up, man?

942
01:28:12,932 --> 01:28:15,101
Looks like we got
just one trick left.

943
01:28:15,185 --> 01:28:17,896
My pleasure, buddy!
Let's do it, baby!

944
01:28:18,855 --> 01:28:21,066
Maybe we should grab Verone
while we still can.

945
01:28:21,149 --> 01:28:22,609
No! Not yet!

946
01:28:24,736 --> 01:28:25,904
What?

947
01:28:25,987 --> 01:28:27,113
You lost them?

948
01:28:27,197 --> 01:28:28,364
Shit!

949
01:28:28,573 --> 01:28:30,033
Those little pricks are running!

950
01:28:30,116 --> 01:28:31,868
It's your call.
What do you want to do?

951
01:28:31,951 --> 01:28:34,496
We're gonna take him down.
He is not leaving here.

952
01:28:35,121 --> 01:28:36,873
Enjoying the ride?

953
01:28:37,874 --> 01:28:39,542
It's a fast car, huh?

954
01:28:41,336 --> 01:28:43,505
It's a classic. Old school.

955
01:28:43,963 --> 01:28:45,632
American muscle.

956
01:28:47,717 --> 01:28:51,304
This car can do all kinds of things.
Want to see?

957
01:28:53,223 --> 01:28:55,350
Check this out right here, homey.

958
01:28:55,433 --> 01:28:57,727
Hey, what are you doing,
man?

959
01:29:07,278 --> 01:29:08,780
Ejecto seato!

960
01:29:09,447 --> 01:29:11,783
It worked! I love this button!

961
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:15,912
Stay on your toes!

962
01:29:17,038 --> 01:29:20,500
Mr. O'Conner, it worked!
Blow and go. I'm all clear.

963
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:23,294
Meet me at the point!
Hurry up! It's on!

964
01:29:23,378 --> 01:29:24,462
All right. 10-4, man.

965
01:29:24,546 --> 01:29:26,381
Are you ready? Let's go!

966
01:29:36,766 --> 01:29:39,477
Let me see your hands!

967
01:29:39,561 --> 01:29:40,812
Freeze!

968
01:29:41,604 --> 01:29:42,814
Clear!

969
01:29:49,195 --> 01:29:53,032
- It's not Verone and Fuentes.
- What do you mean?

970
01:29:53,283 --> 01:29:54,242
Then where the hell are they?

971
01:30:01,833 --> 01:30:03,876
Get off at Tarpon Point.

972
01:30:04,627 --> 01:30:07,964
Tarpon Point?
There's no airstrip at Tarpon Point.

973
01:30:08,798 --> 01:30:11,426
Who said anything about an airstrip?

974
01:30:24,605 --> 01:30:25,815
Brian?

975
01:30:26,524 --> 01:30:28,359
What's the hold-up, bro?

976
01:30:28,568 --> 01:30:31,070
Yo. There's a new plan.
What the hell?

977
01:30:31,154 --> 01:30:34,574
We meet him at Tarpon Point exit,
not the airstrip.

978
01:30:34,657 --> 01:30:38,077
- So, what are you saying?
- Like I said, there's a new plan.

979
01:30:40,413 --> 01:30:41,622
Brian?

980
01:30:42,165 --> 01:30:44,208
Brian? Hello, you there?

981
01:30:46,294 --> 01:30:47,378
Damn!

982
01:30:47,462 --> 01:30:48,921
What the hell is he doing?

983
01:30:49,005 --> 01:30:50,673
The feds are in the wrong place.

984
01:30:50,757 --> 01:30:52,925
Brian's woman is on her own
with Verone.

985
01:30:53,009 --> 01:30:54,052
So...

986
01:30:54,135 --> 01:30:56,054
So Brian's not coming!

987
01:31:12,195 --> 01:31:14,238
- Let him out.
- Get out.

988
01:31:21,871 --> 01:31:22,997
Pop the trunk.

989
01:31:25,458 --> 01:31:26,793
Hurry up.

990
01:31:42,308 --> 01:31:43,559
Where's the rest?

991
01:31:43,643 --> 01:31:45,561
- The other car.
- Another car?

992
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:48,439
- Where's the other car?
- On its way.

993
01:31:48,523 --> 01:31:50,233
- On the way?
- Yeah.

994
01:31:51,442 --> 01:31:52,693
Here's your money.

995
01:31:52,777 --> 01:31:56,114
So you know nothing about the agents
that stormed my jet?

996
01:32:02,995 --> 01:32:06,499
The funny thing is, I only told
one person about the airstrip.

997
01:32:20,888 --> 01:32:24,559
Customs agents sure
are getting pretty, aren't they?

998
01:32:28,855 --> 01:32:30,606
Put her on the boat.

999
01:32:32,692 --> 01:32:34,861
- Let's go.
- Get on the boat.

1000
01:32:49,333 --> 01:32:51,460
Hide the cars and get rid of him.

1001
01:32:51,544 --> 01:32:53,045
Back in the car.

1002
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:22,116
End of the road.

1003
01:33:24,577 --> 01:33:25,995
You know, I like you.

1004
01:33:26,078 --> 01:33:29,040
But I still got to kill you.
It's my job.

1005
01:33:32,627 --> 01:33:33,961
What's that?

1006
01:33:35,421 --> 01:33:37,006
It's Barstow, baby!

1007
01:33:37,381 --> 01:33:39,091
It's about to get ugly!

1008
01:33:47,058 --> 01:33:48,434
Let's go.

1009
01:34:24,303 --> 01:34:25,554
Come on.

1010
01:34:52,081 --> 01:34:53,499
You had me.

1011
01:34:55,668 --> 01:34:57,128
You slipped.

1012
01:34:58,462 --> 01:35:01,215
Eleven and a half months,
and you slipped once.

1013
01:35:02,591 --> 01:35:04,385
Put her downstairs.

1014
01:35:10,516 --> 01:35:12,184
See you in a second.

1015
01:35:17,982 --> 01:35:19,316
I thought you was dead.

1016
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,569
Me, too. Thanks for saving my ass.

1017
01:35:21,652 --> 01:35:22,945
What are you doing?

1018
01:35:23,028 --> 01:35:26,365
If Verone sees a helicopter
or Customs boat, she's dead!

1019
01:35:26,448 --> 01:35:27,449
Boat.

1020
01:35:27,783 --> 01:35:29,368
Car. Boat.

1021
01:35:29,785 --> 01:35:32,288
You're not gonna do
what I think you're gonna do?

1022
01:35:32,371 --> 01:35:35,374
- Yeah, I think so. You got my back?
- Yeah.

1023
01:35:35,457 --> 01:35:36,834
All right, put on the seat belt.

1024
01:35:36,917 --> 01:35:38,711
Show him some Dukes of Hazzard shit!

1025
01:35:38,794 --> 01:35:41,547
We're gonna do this big!
Hold on, Rome!

1026
01:35:48,053 --> 01:35:49,722
Brian, you're crazy, man!

1027
01:35:49,805 --> 01:35:51,557
What the hell are you doing?

1028
01:36:17,416 --> 01:36:19,168
I think I broke my arm.

1029
01:36:32,056 --> 01:36:33,515
Get the gun.

1030
01:36:54,453 --> 01:36:56,038
It's over, Carter.

1031
01:37:03,087 --> 01:37:04,338
You okay?

1032
01:37:04,505 --> 01:37:05,672
Yeah!

1033
01:37:06,965 --> 01:37:08,050
I'm great.

1034
01:37:14,348 --> 01:37:16,016
We got him, man.

1035
01:37:16,934 --> 01:37:19,520
We got him. Let's get out of here.

1036
01:37:39,623 --> 01:37:41,041
Go, go.

1037
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:51,885
That ought to do it.

1038
01:37:52,553 --> 01:37:56,140
So, there were three bags total?
The three from the boat?

1039
01:37:57,141 --> 01:37:58,976
So we're good, right?

1040
01:37:59,351 --> 01:38:00,686
Our records are clean?

1041
01:38:00,769 --> 01:38:02,437
You held up your end.

1042
01:38:03,021 --> 01:38:04,690
Your records are clean.

1043
01:38:22,833 --> 01:38:25,169
So maybe there were six bags.

1044
01:38:26,128 --> 01:38:28,130
I guess we can call it even.

1045
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:29,715
Agent Dunn?

1046
01:38:34,011 --> 01:38:35,929
We found some more evidence.

1047
01:38:38,348 --> 01:38:40,017
Let's take it inside.

1048
01:38:44,021 --> 01:38:46,273
Don't drop the soap, big homey.

1049
01:38:48,609 --> 01:38:52,029
I hope you know when he gets out,
he's going to kill your ass.

1050
01:38:53,363 --> 01:38:55,198
He ain't getting out.

1051
01:38:56,825 --> 01:38:58,243
I'll see you soon.

1052
01:38:58,785 --> 01:39:01,788
- You think he's going to get out?
- He'll be out.

1053
01:39:02,998 --> 01:39:05,375
Not for real.
You think he's getting out?

1054
01:39:06,043 --> 01:39:08,545
We took care of your decoys.
They're free and clear.

1055
01:39:08,629 --> 01:39:10,923
There's a sedan
out on the road for you.

1056
01:39:11,006 --> 01:39:13,175
Try to bring it back in one piece.

1057
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:17,763
Thanks a lot, Bilkins.
You're all right.

1058
01:39:18,764 --> 01:39:20,474
Thanks for looking out.

1059
01:39:22,935 --> 01:39:24,811
Do you trust me now?

1060
01:39:24,937 --> 01:39:26,438
You're all right.

1061
01:39:30,901 --> 01:39:32,069
Sorry.

1062
01:39:33,445 --> 01:39:35,364
Nice working with you, O'Conner.

1063
01:39:35,489 --> 01:39:36,823
Same here.

1064
01:39:49,086 --> 01:39:53,173
I might have to stay here in Miami,
and keep you out of trouble, bruh.

1065
01:39:55,967 --> 01:39:57,803
You know what I'm talking about.

1066
01:39:57,886 --> 01:40:00,055
You're going to kick it
in Miami?

1067
01:40:00,430 --> 01:40:03,475
I love Miami.
Miami is off the hook!

1068
01:40:05,644 --> 01:40:07,688
Open a garage together.

1069
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:11,316
A garage?
How are we going to do that?

1070
01:40:16,196 --> 01:40:18,281
Pockets ain't empty, cuz.

1071
01:40:22,369 --> 01:40:24,621
And we ain't hungry
no more, right?
