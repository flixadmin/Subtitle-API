938
00:58:14,996 --> 00:58:16,263
Nothing further, Your Honor.

939
00:58:18,299 --> 00:58:19,967
[judge]
Your witness, Ms. Stewart.

940
00:58:20,735 --> 00:58:21,535
Thank you.

941
00:58:24,105 --> 00:58:26,841
Doctor Liu, good morning.

942
00:58:26,874 --> 00:58:27,908
[doctor] Morning.

943
00:58:29,577 --> 00:58:31,278
How long did you interview
Arthur Fleck for?

944
00:58:31,712 --> 00:58:33,047
About two hours.

945
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,615
About two hours.

946
00:58:35,783 --> 00:58:37,585
It was actually 89 minutes.

947
00:58:38,786 --> 00:58:41,822
Tell me,
how can you say for certain,

948
00:58:41,856 --> 00:58:44,058
that Arthur isn't mentally ill?

949
00:58:44,859 --> 00:58:48,129
How can you be so sure
after just 89 minutes,

950
00:58:48,162 --> 00:58:50,698
that this "Joker"

951
00:58:50,731 --> 00:58:54,902
isn't a distinctly separate
and split personality from him?

952
00:58:54,935 --> 00:58:57,271
That that's not who he is.

953
00:58:57,304 --> 00:59:00,808
Well, I also reviewed
all the test results.

954
00:59:00,841 --> 00:59:05,713
Psychological tests,
neurological and medical tests.

955
00:59:05,746 --> 00:59:08,816
And in my view,
it's just a performance.

956
00:59:08,849 --> 00:59:09,984
[crowd murmurs]

957
00:59:10,017 --> 00:59:11,585
[Ms. Stewart]
Did you read the records

958
00:59:11,619 --> 00:59:13,721
from the
Department of Social Services...

959
00:59:14,922 --> 00:59:18,793
...that show that when Arthur
was seven years old,

960
00:59:18,826 --> 00:59:20,895
they returned him
to his abuser's home?

961
00:59:22,897 --> 00:59:25,199
-His mother's home.
-[pen scratching]

962
00:59:25,232 --> 00:59:27,234
[doctor] I did, yes.

963
00:59:28,302 --> 00:59:31,305
[Ms. Stewart] And when you
interviewed him for 89 minutes,

964
00:59:32,273 --> 00:59:35,076
did you ask him
why Social Services

965
00:59:35,109 --> 00:59:37,745
didn't believe
the horrific stories

966
00:59:37,778 --> 00:59:40,748
a seven-year-old boy told them

967
00:59:40,781 --> 00:59:43,651
about the physical
and sexual abuse he suffered?

968
00:59:43,684 --> 00:59:45,186
[faint, echoing laughter]

969
00:59:48,022 --> 00:59:51,058
No, I...
I didn't ask him about that.

970
00:59:51,092 --> 00:59:52,927
[Ms. Stewart] Hmm.

971
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,796
So you want us to believe,

972
00:59:56,797 --> 01:00:02,069
that after spending just
89 minutes with Arthur Fleck,

973
01:00:02,103 --> 01:00:06,273
and reading through
his records and tests

974
01:00:06,307 --> 01:00:09,944
from the same government
agencies that abandoned him,

975
01:00:09,977 --> 01:00:11,779
you want us to believe

976
01:00:11,812 --> 01:00:15,249
that you can say
with absolute certainty

977
01:00:15,282 --> 01:00:19,887
that Arthur doesn't suffer
from any serious mental illness?

978
01:00:20,855 --> 01:00:24,125
That he didn't need
to retreat into fantasy

979
01:00:24,158 --> 01:00:26,827
and create another identity

980
01:00:26,861 --> 01:00:32,933
to protect that scared,
vulnerable, seven-year-old boy

981
01:00:32,967 --> 01:00:35,970
from all the trauma and abuse
he suffered?

982
01:00:36,971 --> 01:00:40,674
And that that identity
didn't come out again,

983
01:00:40,875 --> 01:00:43,878
when he was
attacked and tormented

984
01:00:43,911 --> 01:00:47,148
by three drunk bullies
on the subway?

985
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:49,450
[three loud, echoing gunshots]

986
01:00:49,483 --> 01:00:51,418

989
01:00:56,924 --> 01:00:59,393
And then there's Murray.

990
01:00:59,827 --> 01:01:00,961
Funny, right?

991
01:01:01,896 --> 01:01:03,764
Then I remember Sophie.

-Objection. Your Honor...

993
01:01:06,233 --> 01:01:09,136
Again, my client's
personal diary is privileged.

994

[judge] Overruled.

995
01:01:10,771 --> 01:01:13,807
Again, as long as Mrs. Kane
limits her comments

996
01:01:13,841 --> 01:01:15,242
to Mr. Fleck's journals--

997
01:01:15,276 --> 01:01:16,911
But these are my own
personal private jokes.

998
01:01:16,944 --> 01:01:18,045
They weren't meant
to be read out loud.

999
01:01:18,078 --> 01:01:19,780
-Mr. Fleck. Quiet!
-[gavel bangs]

1000
01:01:19,813 --> 01:01:21,282
[faint feedback squeal]

1001
01:01:21,315 --> 01:01:24,118
[judge] These are your words
she's reading.

1002
01:01:24,151 --> 01:01:25,286
And it's up to the jury

1003
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:27,054
to determine
what to make of them.

1004
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:30,991
Please proceed.

1005
01:01:32,527 --> 01:01:34,461
Ms. Kane,
please continue reading

1006
01:01:34,495 --> 01:01:37,164
from the, uh...
the highlighted portion.

1007
01:01:38,232 --> 01:01:40,267
"Then I remember Sophie.

1008
01:01:40,868 --> 01:01:43,137
Had another dream about her.
Forgot it.

1009
01:01:44,338 --> 01:01:46,473
<i>I almost never dream.</i>

1010
01:01:46,508 --> 01:01:49,043
What do I gotta do to remember?"

1011
01:01:49,076 --> 01:01:51,478
[Dent] That's Sophie Dumond,
Mr. Fleck's neighbor,

1012
01:01:51,513 --> 01:01:53,847
whom he was obsessed with.

1013
01:01:53,881 --> 01:01:54,715
What was that date?

1014
01:01:55,517 --> 01:01:57,151
November 17.

1015
01:01:58,419 --> 01:02:00,754
Let the record show,

1016
01:02:00,788 --> 01:02:03,857
November 17th
is the day that Mr. Fleck

1017
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:06,493
stabbed Randall Kleinmanhoffer
to death.

1018
01:02:07,494 --> 01:02:13,467
The very same day that he shot
and killed Murray Franklin.

1019
01:02:14,501 --> 01:02:18,806
Now, I know it's not
your area of expertise,

1020
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:20,040
but you have read all of

1021
01:02:20,074 --> 01:02:22,076
Mr. Fleck's journal before,
correct?

1022
01:02:22,109 --> 01:02:23,410
[Mrs. Kane] Yes, I have.

1023
01:02:23,444 --> 01:02:26,247
And in your opinion,

1024
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,817
does this sound
like a different voice?

1025
01:02:30,851 --> 01:02:35,189
Like a different, uh...
personality wrote this?

1026
01:02:36,991 --> 01:02:38,392
No, it sounds like Arthur.

1027
01:02:39,326 --> 01:02:41,128
[Dent] Go on.

1028
01:02:41,161 --> 01:02:44,131
He often wrote about
his fantasies.

1029
01:02:45,966 --> 01:02:51,071
And... the... women he had
imaginary relationships with.

1030
01:02:52,339 --> 01:02:55,442
<i>And of course, his jokes.</i>

1031
01:02:55,476 --> 01:02:59,880
<i>There were always</i>
<i>a lot of... these...</i>

1032
01:02:59,913 --> 01:03:02,116
<i>these unfunny jokes.</i>

[Ms. Stewart]
She's just a social worker.

1035
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,354
I don't think
she's even qualified--

1036

You know, you're making him out
to be a fucking idiot in there.

He's never gonna get out
if you keep this shit up.

Ask her why she has me
sitting so far away from him.

1040

Let's not do this here. Please?

1041

Do you see
all those people out front?

1042
01:03:20,167 --> 01:03:21,869
Who do you think
they're here for?

1043
01:03:21,902 --> 01:03:23,837
How many T-shirts
is Arthur Fleck on?

1044
01:03:24,905 --> 01:03:26,508
How many signs?

1045
01:03:26,541 --> 01:03:28,008
It's the Trial of the Century

1046
01:03:28,042 --> 01:03:30,512
and she doesn't even know
who her own client is.

1047
01:03:30,545 --> 01:03:33,113
-What do you mean by that?
-Can't you see how sick he is?

1048
01:03:33,147 --> 01:03:35,049
How much help he needs?

1049
01:03:35,617 --> 01:03:37,217
He's not sick.

1050
01:03:38,586 --> 01:03:40,354
He's perfect.

1051
01:03:40,387 --> 01:03:41,922
You don't really think
he's just gonna

1052
01:03:41,955 --> 01:03:43,924
walk out of here, do you?

1053
01:03:43,957 --> 01:03:45,926
[Lee] Yeah, he's gonna walk
right outta here.

Any further statements?

[Ms. Stewart]
You're not listening.

1061
01:04:04,546 --> 01:04:07,081
We can win this case,
and she's gonna fuck it all up.

1062
01:04:07,114 --> 01:04:09,416
No, you're not listening.

She understands
what I've been through.

What are you talking about?

1067
01:04:17,592 --> 01:04:20,127
We're from
the same neighborhood.

1068
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:24,331
She lost her father. You know...
her mom was awful to her.

1069
01:04:24,365 --> 01:04:25,966
She had her committed.

1070
01:04:25,999 --> 01:04:28,335
So just give her a break.

1071
01:04:29,671 --> 01:04:32,306
Okay, Lee cares about you, sure.

1072
01:04:32,339 --> 01:04:33,907
I know.

1073
01:04:34,408 --> 01:04:36,477
But she didn't grow up
in your neighborhood.

1074
01:04:36,511 --> 01:04:39,581
She lives on the Upper West Side
with her parents.

1075
01:04:39,614 --> 01:04:42,916
Her father is not dead,
he's a doctor.

1076
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:45,252
She voluntarily
committed herself

1077
01:04:45,285 --> 01:04:46,453
to the hospital,

1078
01:04:46,487 --> 01:04:48,288
and then just
checked herself out

1079
01:04:48,322 --> 01:04:49,456
when she wanted to.

1080
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:51,325
She didn't check herself out.

1081

Arthur.

1082
01:04:53,127 --> 01:04:55,530
I was a bad influence on her,
so they separated us.

1083
01:04:58,332 --> 01:05:01,435
Did she mention she went
to grad school for psychiatry?

1084
01:05:01,468 --> 01:05:04,506
[giggling] You wouldn't get it.

1085
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:09,076
My point is she's playing you
for a fool.

1086
01:05:10,512 --> 01:05:12,146
I'm sorry, I just--

1087
01:05:13,581 --> 01:05:16,150
I know what it's like
to love somebody.

1088
01:05:16,183 --> 01:05:18,586
But I don't think you can
believe a word she says.

1251
01:15:32,833 --> 01:15:37,304
...was the man who broke
into your apartment that night,

1252
01:15:37,905 --> 01:15:43,177
was he different in any way
from the Arthur Fleck you knew?

1253
01:15:44,612 --> 01:15:46,313
I didn't really know him.

1254
01:15:47,148 --> 01:15:50,818
I saw him in the lobby,
the elevator a few times.

1255
01:15:52,286 --> 01:15:53,988
Like I said,
I knew his mother a little bit.

1256
01:15:54,021 --> 01:15:56,257
She was really sweet
to my daughter.

1257
01:15:57,691 --> 01:15:59,060
[Dent] And Ms. Dumond,

1258
01:16:00,394 --> 01:16:02,730
why is it that you didn't want
to come here and testify today?

1259
01:16:03,731 --> 01:16:07,001
And why did you initially
ignore our subpoenas?

1260
01:16:07,701 --> 01:16:10,971
Well,
after Arthur did what he did,

1261
01:16:12,306 --> 01:16:14,308
the press wanted
to talk to me about it.

1262
01:16:15,376 --> 01:16:17,244
And then I was a character

1263
01:16:17,278 --> 01:16:20,247
in that awful TV movie
they made, and...

1264
01:16:21,082 --> 01:16:22,016
-[whispers] It was awful?
-Then all these people...

1265
01:16:22,049 --> 01:16:23,617
No.

1266
01:16:23,651 --> 01:16:26,120
...supporters, I guess,
like the people outside,

1267
01:16:26,153 --> 01:16:30,257
started showing up
at my work and harassing me,

1268
01:16:30,758 --> 01:16:32,660
blaming me for what happened
to Arthur.

1269
01:16:34,829 --> 01:16:37,264
So I was afraid for my safety
and for my daughter's safety.

1270
01:16:37,298 --> 01:16:38,833
We moved out of the city.

1271
01:16:39,266 --> 01:16:42,803
Well, then why did you
finally decide to comply?

1272
01:16:42,837 --> 01:16:44,705
Because I should have
called the police that night.

1273
01:16:47,174 --> 01:16:48,909
Then maybe all those people
wouldn't have been...

1274
01:16:51,078 --> 01:16:52,947
Maybe they wouldn't be
dead now if I did.

He told me he was having
a bad day. And then he left.

in your apartment that night?

1289

And while Arthur's mother

1292
01:17:45,299 --> 01:17:48,469
was being so sweet
to your daughter,

1293
01:17:48,502 --> 01:17:50,704
what was she telling you
about her own son?

1294
01:17:54,942 --> 01:17:56,277
Um...

1295

She told me that there was
something wrong with Arthur,

1296
01:18:00,881 --> 01:18:03,284
and that he lived
in a fantasy world

1297
01:18:03,317 --> 01:18:06,353
and that he had this laugh.

1298
01:18:06,387 --> 01:18:08,822
[Ms. Stewart] She told you
it was a "dumb laugh."

[Sophie] Yes.

[Ms. Stewart]
What else did she tell you?

1303
01:18:19,099 --> 01:18:23,337
That she made up a story,
when he was a kid.

1304
01:18:24,305 --> 01:18:26,508
So that he would feel
better about it.

1305
01:18:26,541 --> 01:18:27,975
So that he would stop crying,

1306
01:18:28,008 --> 01:18:29,944
so that he wouldn't
kill himself.

1307
01:18:30,878 --> 01:18:32,213
What was the story?

1308
01:18:33,013 --> 01:18:35,983
[Sophie] That he was put
on this earth to bring joy.

1309
01:18:37,451 --> 01:18:39,453
Something like that.
It's why she called him "Happy."

he based his whole life

1313

around this made-up story.

1314
