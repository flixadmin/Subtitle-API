1
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,711
Tensions are rising
as the stand-off

2
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:51,775
between the world community and the
rogue North African nation of Wadiya

3
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,080
intensified today

4
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:57,123
as U.N. weapons inspectors were once
again refused access to the country

5
00:00:57,224 --> 00:01:00,524
by Wadiyan leader,
Admiral General Aladeen.

6
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,695
I will take no options
off the table. And I mean what I say.

7
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,868
Tonight we ask...
Who is General Aladeen?

8
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,066
According to Wadiyan propaganda,

9
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:13,266
Haffaz Aladeen was born in 1973.

10
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:19,777
He did not know his mother,
who died in childbirth.

11
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,641
The only son of
the savage dictator Omar Aladeen,

12
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,913
he gained power at the age of 7.

13
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,055
Eccentric and with
unlimited oil wealth,

14
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,558
he recently hosted
his own Olympic Games...

15
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,057
On your mark, get set.

16
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:46,172
At which he won
fourteen gold medals.

17
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,174
Aladeen! Aladeen!

18
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,345
Often described as ignorant,

19
00:01:54,915 --> 00:01:58,283
he changed
over 300 Wadiyan words to "Aladeen,"

20
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:02,153
including the words "positive" and
"negative," causing mass confusion.

21
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:07,420
Do you want
the Aladeen news or the Aladeen news?

22
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,125
The Aladeen news?

23
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,459
You are HIV-Aladeen.

24
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,845
With pressure mounting,

25
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:33,477
Aladeen addressed
his nation today.

26
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,982
Aladeen! Aladeen!

27
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,745
People of Wadiya,

28
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:11,649
I come before you today

29
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:16,362
to tell you that the world shall
kneel before our great nation.

30
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:21,601
We are two months away from
enriching weapons-grade uranium

31
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:29,204
to be used
for peaceful purposes.

32
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:40,510
It will be used
only for medical research

33
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:43,951
and clean energy.
It will, it will.

34
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,787
And will certainly never be used

35
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:49,619
to attack Is...
Boy.

36
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,632
With that speech, today,

37
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,295
the international community
is asking one question:

38
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:01,138
Does the Mad Dog of Wadiya
have nuclear weapons?

39
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:12,811
Now, show me my nuclear weapons!

40
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,650
I can't wait!
I can't wait!

41
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,968
This is the Beard
of Doom rocket?

42
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,309
This is my weapon?
I will be a laughingstock!

43
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,274
All my friends
have got nuclear weapons.

44
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:42,005
Even Ahmadinejad!

45
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,446
And he looks like
a snitch on Miami Vice.

46
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:49,679
Where is the Head of my Nuclear
Program and Procurer of Women?

47
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,855
Where is Nuclear Nadal?

48
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,526
You had Nadal executed,
Supreme Leader.

49
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:55,988
Why did I do that?

50
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:02,792
Supreme Leader!

51
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,368
Nadal.

52
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,802
We are just months away
from refining weapons-grade uranium,

53
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,704
and we are set
to test the missile next week.

54
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:15,277
It is too round on the top.
It needs to be pointy.

55
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,547
Round is not scary.
Pointy is scary.

56
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,811
This will put a smile
on the faces of the enemy.

57
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:24,388
They will think that it is a huge robot
dildo flying toward them.

58
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,853
No, Supreme Leader.

59
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,690
The shape of the missile top
has nothing to do with aerodynamics.

60
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,491
It is about
the payload delivery.

61
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,965
No. It sticks in the ground,
and then kaboom.

62
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,701
Supreme Leader, I think perhaps

63
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:38,568
some of your information
about bombs is coming from cartoons.

64
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,141
Nonsense. I have been
watching research films.

65
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:44,503
In this film, just one question,

66
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:48,515
was there a duck who,
when the explosion is happens,

67
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:51,814
his bill goes
around to the back of his head,

68
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:55,014
and then in order to talk,
he has to put it back this way?

69
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,720
There was somebody
who suffered a deformity like that.

70
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,054
Okay.

71
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,653
I am now 100% sure
that you are watching cartoons.

72
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:06,762
Indulge me. For one second,
pretend that I'm an idiot.

73
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,265
Okay. I'm there.

74
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,096
Okay. You know what?

75
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,939
Let's just agree
to disagree, my friend.

76
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:17,369
Okay.

77
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:20,911
What? Why? No!

78
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:24,012
- Don't you remember?
- Of course I remember!

79
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:27,254
How dare you question my
memory? I remember everything!

80
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:30,188
No, I would never do that!
Never! I'm so sorry. I didn't mean that.

81
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,892
Don't worry, it's fine.
Well done, my friend.

82
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,354
Thank you.

83
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,127
Wait! Wait!
Where are we going?

84
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:40,357
Admiral General,
what if we just tell the United Nations

85
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,765
we have no nuclear weapons?

86
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,234
They will lift the sanctions.

87
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,568
We'll be free
to sell oil rights to the Jalabiya desert.

88
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,232
Uncle Tamir.

89
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:49,538
Do you not remember
what my saintly father

90
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,475
made me promise him
on his deathbed?

91
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:55,142
It was never
to sell Wadiya's oil.

92
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,209
You remember that
was when he gave me power

93
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,254
instead of you,
the rightful heir.

94
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:01,978
You've been so cool about it.

95
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,388
Now, let's go back
to the palace.

96
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:05,819
It's the season finale

97
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:09,624
of Real Housewives
of Shachahmahahfalimitahlicch!

98
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,338
Death to the tyrant!

99
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,350
Looks like we need
to find a new double.

100
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,026
Because this one is...

101
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:45,025
You know, I don't know
if he's going to get better.

102
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,425
He's not going
to recover, sir. He's dead.

103
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,526
Yeah, how 'bout looking in my eye
when I'm speaking to you?

104
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:54,472
It's very rude not to look at somebody in
the eye when they're talking to you.

105
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,505
It's okay. Don't worry.
You're having a rough day.

106
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,885
We shot the wrong man.

107
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,524
I can fix this. I have a new
plan. We need to find a new double.

108
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:16,562
One that is simple enough to
be manipulated completely.

109
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,570
I think we found
what you are looking for.

110
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:40,079
You think this man
looks like me?

111
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,653
You have a very big barn.

112
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:46,426
You must have many happy goats?

113
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,855
What the fuck
does that even mean?

114
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:53,429
Uncle Tamir,
this thing is an idiot.

115
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,430
What makes you think
he can do the job?

116
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:59,433
May I remind you that his only real job is
to be shot in the head.

117
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:02,773
Very well. Put him
through the process, okay?

118
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,569
Clip his nails, file his teeth,

119
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,443
bleach his skin,
and shorten the penis.

120
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,778
Megan! Megan!

121
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,787
You now have herpes.

122
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:23,222
Megan, you were
worth every penny.

123
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,054
You were super hot.

124
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,627
Is my jet ready?

125
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,793
Yes, but do you
want to stay the night?

126
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,633
You know, I really
want to do some cuddling.

127
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:32,899
No. Your time is up.

128
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,964
I have to be
with the Italian Prime Minister tomorrow.

129
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,709
Okay. Maroush,
give the goodie bag!

130
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:39,101
Thanks.

131
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:40,612
I trust everything is in there,

132
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,409
as your manager requested?

133
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:44,576
Katy Perry said she got
a diamond Rolex.

134
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:47,314
That's because she let me
Aladeen in her face.

135
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,313
Okay.

136
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,655
Right. Are you sure you don't want
to stay for some cuddles?

137
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,750
- No.
- But, please.

138
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,319
I really want someone to cuddle.

139
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:02,556
Breaking news now.
Just moments ago,

140
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,823
the U.N. Security
Council voted

141
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,298
to authorize NATO
air strikes against Wadiya,

142
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:10,565
unless Admiral General Aladeen
agrees to address the U.N. in person.

143
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,571
And now, the world waits.

144
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,901
What will Aladeen do next?

145
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,527
Next. No, no, no. No. Boring,
boring. Come on. Come on.

146
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:42,035
Beloved Oppressor,
I have just received disturbing news.

147
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,434
Welcome to the Munich Olympics.

148
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,099
Shalom?

149
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,434
Oy vey!

150
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:50,200
Supreme Leader,

151
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,539
the United Nations demands that

152
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:54,911
you address their concerns
about our nuclear program,

153
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,108
or they will vote to
authorize military action.

154
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:58,780
Meshugenner!

155
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,211
Very well.

156
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:04,246
Then I shall address this gathering of
snakes they call the U.N.

157
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:07,691
We are going to the devil's nest

158
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,620
of America!

159
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:36,921
America!

160
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,590
Built by the blacks
and owned by the Chinese.

161
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,634
Supreme Leader, I took the liberty
of hiring some extra security.

162
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,260
This is Mr Clayton.

163
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,431
Admiral General,
I am here for your protection 24/7.

164
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:54,599
Okay.

165
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:58,270
But in the interest of full disclosure, I
have to say I hate A-rabs.

166
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,273
Well, that's fine,
because I'm not an Arab.

167
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,315
Well, you're
all A-rabs to me, the blacks, the Jews,

168
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:08,149
those blue tree-hugging
queers in A-vatar.

169
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:14,150
In fact, anyone from outside of
America is technically an A-rab.

170
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:16,455
Listen, while you're here,

171
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,829
I highly recommend a visit
to the Empire State Building,

172
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,993
before you or one of your
sand-monkey cousins takes it down.

173
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:29,203
Supreme Leader, the suite has been
renovated to your specifications.

174
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:37,878
Twenty dollars a day
for Internet? What the fuck?

175
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:42,985
And they accuse me
of being an international criminal?

176
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,188
Beloved Oppressor,
try to get some sleep.

177
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,885
Tomorrow is your big speech.

178
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,029
Nobody touch the minibar!
It's a fucking rip-off!

179
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,580
Rise and shine.

180
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,843
Who are you?

181
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,519
We've actually already met.

182
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:19,184
Hello, Aladdin.

183
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,251
- Clayton?
- Here's the deal.

184
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,185
I'm being paid to kill you.

185
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,997
But I'm gonna
torture you for free.

186
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:31,099
Are you serious?

187
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,532
Where'd you get those relics?

188
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,200
From the Shah of Iran's
garage sale?

189
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:36,598
Yeah, right.

190
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,109
I mean, I know there's
nothing more annoying

191
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,736
than a backseat torturer,
but, please, come on.

192
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,378
This is great stuff.

193
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,884
It's not great stuff.
That's like 1972, hello.

194
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:50,112
You won't be talking
so much smack with this up your butt.

195
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,852
That's the Anal Umbrella.
It's a good device, I grant you,

196
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,792
but where's the splash guard?

197
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,864
You're going to kill me
and your white shirt.

198
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,893
It didn't come
with a splash guard.

199
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,958
You're gonna get chara
on your trousers.

200
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,202
I can see it has
a screw hole for one.

201
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,636
Apparently, I didn't get it.

202
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,037
All right, Mr Smart Guy,

203
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,368
check out this bad boy.

204
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,912
That's not bad.
The Kandahar Cock Wrench.

205
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:14,311
Okay, so, now
we're getting somewhere.

206
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,282
It's actually been banned in Saudi
Arabia for being too safe.

207
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,785
You know,
this is totally depressing.

208
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,419
Listen, just show me
another one.

209
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,287
You know, honestly, I don't even want
to show you anything any more.

210
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,290
Don't be like that.

211
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,762
You know, I don't even think
you want to be tortured.

212
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:31,161
I don't want to be tortured.

213
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,823
You're just, like,
taking all the fun out of it!

214
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,423
What else you got?
I'm gonna love the next thing!

215
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,763
I will be supportive.

216
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,167
All right.

217
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:40,070
Just this. This pours
hot fire out on you.

218
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,241
the Fallujah Firehose!

219
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,106
Someone's got a friend in Syria!

220
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,611
I am pretty proud of it.

221
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,271
There is a new model, you know.

222
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:49,813
I've got one that
works by Bluetooth.

223
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,446
Screw it. Screw it!
Screw it!

224
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,084
I'm going to enjoy this now.

225
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,918
No, don't. Don't.
Don't. Please, don't!

226
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:08,333
No one will recognise
the body without this!

227
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:10,866
The Supreme Beard!
You will be cursed!

228
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,029
No, no, don't do it!

229
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,970
Come on!
Why won't this catch?

230
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,875
You foolish man! There is no earthly
fire that could ever light...

231
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,146
The flames
of the righteous attack the unjust!

232
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,893
I'll be back with help!
J.K.! Just kidding!

233
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,828
My speech.

234
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,667
Yo!
Average American shopper!

235
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:48,205
Give me your clothes!

236
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,578
Hey, hey!
Aladeen has got to go!

237
00:16:56,916 --> 00:17:00,250
Hey, hey!
Aladeen has got to go!

238
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:03,913
Hello. I am
Admiral General Aladeen.

239
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,219
I am here to
deliver my speech to the United Nations.

240
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,226
Look, Admiral,
it's too hot for crazy.

241
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,420
How dare you?

242
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,655
Listen, Tamir is
coming right now.

243
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:14,059
You're going to
be in big trouble. Here he is.

244
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,866
Tamir! Tamir!

245
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,005
Tamir, it was you, you snake!

246
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,545
He's not the legitimate leader!

247
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,450
He's not the legitimate leader!

248
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,786
He's not the legitimate leader!

249
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:42,126
You have rehearsed the
speech I prepared for you?

250
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:45,221
Yes. But when is
the General coming?

251
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,625
He's feeling ill.

252
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,959
Does he have worms in his shilshul?

253
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,229
Very possibly.

254
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,295
Admiral General Aladeen
preparing

255
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,466
to address the General
Assembly of the United Nations.

256
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,565
An historic moment.

257
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,304
He's approaching the podium.

258
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,909
And he's walked
right past the podium.

259
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,070
What is he doing?

260
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,473
You are making a fool out of me!

261
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,809
Let's bring in Denise,
our U.N. correspondent.

262
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,114
What do you make of that?

263
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,822
Well, I have to say,
he's got their attention.

264
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,319
Every eye in the room
is on him right now.

265
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,827
And he's returning
to the podium.

266
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,492
And he's fallen off the stage.

267
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,260
What do you make
of that, Denise?

268
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:25,164
You know, he's clearly implying that the
U.N. must fall before him.

269
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,097
Drinking from the
pitcher of water directly,

270
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:30,769
as opposed to
the glass that I'm sure must be up there.

271
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:31,833
What do you think that means?

272
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,970
Again, it's another
attempt to say,

273
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,276
"Listen, I'm not going
to play by your rules."

274
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,011
And he seems to have
a pitcher of urine out.

275
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,782
I believe he just
urinated in the pitcher.

276
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,183
He is now drinking his urine.

277
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,119
It looks to be his own urine.

278
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:47,921
Sorry. You want?

279
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,527
Trying to force it
on the Israeli delegation.

280
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:52,531
That might be the ambassador.

281
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:56,596
He is dumping the urine
on the Israeli delegation.

282
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,098
That's a good one.

283
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:01,771
Okay, he's returning
to the podium.

284
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:06,712
Much has been made
of the hostility between our countries.

285
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:09,546
With the help
of the U.M.,

286
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:13,219
I will draft a new
constitution for Wadiya

287
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:18,547
and sign it in five days,
on Wadiya's Independence Day.

288
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:19,881
No, no, no.

289
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:21,890
This new constitution

290
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:23,721
will end the dictatorship...

291
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,819
No!

292
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:28,356
And it will turn Wadiya into a

293
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,233
democracy.

294
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,574
No! Democracy? Never!

295
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,640
Never!

296
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:41,906
The Wadiyan people
love being oppressed!

297
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,183
Dictatorship forever!

298
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,016
Come on! Come with me!

299
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:55,851
Hurry!

300
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,533
Hello, person. Person.

301
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,101
Black person.

302
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,433
The double that
you found is good.

303
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,270
He is almost as dumb
as the real guy.

304
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,034
So, Wadiya will
become a democracy.

305
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,707
China is a democracy, too.

306
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,412
Once that constitution
is signed,

307
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,715
I will be able
to sell Wadiya's oil rights. Gazprom,

308
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,353
you will have control of
Wadiya's southern oil fields.

309
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,221
B.P., you will
control the north.

310
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,726
Exxon, you will have
all offshore rights,

311
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:30,058
provided you do not
use B.P.'s drilling rigs.

312
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:34,123
And, Mr Lao of PetroChina, you will
have the lease on our shale reserves.

313
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,202
Some of those reserves are
in densely populated areas.

314
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,902
Then unpopulate them.

315
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,307
After you've paid me
my 30% finder's fee, of course.

316
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,074
Gentlemen.

317
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,073
So, you're going
to make billions.

318
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:50,139
What will you do
with all those dollars?

319
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:54,280
I will buy the house on Lake Como
next to George Clooney's.

320
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,454
I love George Clooney!

321
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,587
He's an old-fashioned
movie star.

322
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,455
He gay?
He suck my dick?

323
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,924
No, those are just rumors.
Are you a homosexual?

324
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:07,759
No, no, no, it's more
of a power trip with me.

325
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,426
Everybody has a price.

326
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:12,563
Tommy Lee Jones let me roll it in my
fingers for two hundred grand!

327
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,440
My gosh, that was so crazy!

328
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,944
I am so honored
to be able to help you.

329
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:27,176
Finally, somebody
who knows who I am.

330
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,682
Yeah, of course!

331
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:32,452
You're the Wadiyan dissident who was
standing up to that asshole Aladeen.

332
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,449
It was so brave of you.

333
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,787
- My name is Zoey.
- I don't care.

334
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:37,986
What's yours?

335
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,960
My name is Ala... son.

336
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,299
- Allison?
- Right. Allison.

337
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,468
What's your last name?

338
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:49,706
Burgers.

339
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,541
Nice to meet you,
Allison Burgers.

340
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,341
- You know, I...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

341
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:58,779
Allison, could you
please take your hands off my breasts?

342
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,211
Those are breasts?
I thought you were a boy.

343
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:07,386
- Where are you taking me to?
- To Brooklyn!

344
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,998
So, yeah, this is my store!

345
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,505
This is the Free
Earth Collective.

346
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:24,073
We are a vegan, feminist,
non-profit cooperative operating

347
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,407
within an anti-racist,
anti-oppressive framework

348
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,174
for people of all or no genders.

349
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:31,577
We are a pure democracy,

350
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,744
just like Wadiya's
going to be soon!

351
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:35,816
Get me clothes, little man.

352
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,852
You know what, there's some in
the Earthquake Relief box

353
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,482
in the lesbian bathroom,
right there.

354
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,753
Right.

355
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,262
So, Allison,
we're the only store in New York,

356
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,559
other than that fascist
superchain Green World,

357
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,657
that sells your nation's
specialty fruit, mafroom,

358
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,195
which I know
you people eat a lot of.

359
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,335
I hope that didn't come off
like a cultural stereotype.

360
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,874
Because I'm, like,
the furthest thing from a racist.

361
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:58,838
I pretty much haven't
had a white boyfriend since high school.

362
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:01,070
Well, the darker races
are less choosy.

363
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,506
Okay, that came off
as kind of offensive.

364
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,082
Thank you.

365
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,354
Anyway, let me give
you the grand tour.

366
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:12,255
Up on the roof,
we have this amazing organic garden...

367
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:15,083
Boring! Do you sell
any assault rifles?

368
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:18,190
Wait. I got it.
Humor. Right?

369
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,922
I took a feminist
clown workshop once.

370
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,226
Help! Help! I'm trapped
under a glass ceiling!

371
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,230
What the fuck?

372
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,472
I wasn't the best
student, but...

373
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,038
You seem educated.

374
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:31,140
Yes.
I went to Amherst.

375
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:33,278
I love it when
women go to school.

376
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:36,372
It's like seeing
a monkey on rollerskates.

377
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:39,642
It means nothing to them,
but it's so adorable for us.

378
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:42,120
Okay. Well, hey, Allison,

379
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:45,453
you know, we'd love to have you work
here if you ever wanted to.

380
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:49,722
All of our employees
are political refugees, just like you!

381
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:50,953
There's Hannah over here.

382
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,999
She's from El Salvador. She's a really
useful member of our team.

383
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:00,061
Useful as what?
A coat hanger?

384
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,172
- Come on.
- Allison, that's not funny.

385
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:06,479
Okay. I tell you what,
get back to work, Captain Hook!

386
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:09,007
- "Captain Hook." It's funny.
- No, it's not funny.

387
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:10,238
Who's that?

388
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:11,484
This is Joteph.

389
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,018
He's from a Sudanese tribe
that has no concept of money.

390
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:16,518
His entire village
was ransacked.

391
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:17,848
Hey, Sub-Saharan!

392
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:22,653
Do you think you could get me 100
child soldiers here by 5:00 p.m.?

393
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:23,785
No!

394
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:25,160
Okay. Time out! Time out.

395
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:26,459
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

396
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,427
Shave your under-the-arms!

397
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,601
I dread to think what kind of jungle
you have on your malawach!

398
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,428
That is very inappropriate.

399
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,439
Don't tell me what
to say and what not to say, little boy.

400
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,804
You need to put
that finger away.

401
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,209
I won't put my
finger away because...

402
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,803
Look, I've got two fingers now.

403
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,973
Okay.

404
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:46,610
If you do not stop using hateful
language, you cannot work here.

405
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,988
All right. I promise.

406
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,283
Okay.

407
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,285
I tricked you, Wolverina.

408
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:58,290
Justin Bieber's chubby double!

409
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:02,398
Hairy Potter!

410
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:11,971
Good-bye, old friend.

411
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:20,517
When will the Supreme
Leader be better?

412
00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:21,645
In time.

413
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,155
He's resting in his bedroom
and must never, ever be disturbed.

414
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:28,049
Time for bed.

415
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:35,395
Being Aladeen has its perks,
does it not?

416
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,229
Dropped your belt.

417
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:57,721
What are you doing?

418
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,019
She tried to milk me!

419
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:00,248
No.

420
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:02,688
They are trying to pleasure you.

421
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:05,592
Allow the girls to use
their many talents.

422
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,264
No!

423
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:18,867
Supreme Leader!
The girls!

424
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:21,874
Girls, show him your bosoms.

425
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:50,802
Let me in! I have
85 rooms at this hotel!

426
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:53,571
It's me, Admiral
General Aladeen!

427
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:54,943
I lost my beard!

428
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:56,641
You don't got a pass,
you don't get in.

429
00:26:56,748 --> 00:27:00,082
But I'm staying here! I paid twenty
dollars for the fucking Internet!

430
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:03,755
How much do you charge
for assassinations?

431
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:35,548
Nadal?

432
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:23,926
Welcome to
the Death to Aladeen Restaurant.

433
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:27,401
Wait. You look
very familiar.

434
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:29,071
Do I know you?

435
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,534
Sorry.

436
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:33,935
Sorry.

437
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:35,541
So sorry, Supreme Leader.

438
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,545
Don't worry.
I'm 50% to blame.

439
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,415
No! No! Supreme Leader!

440
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:45,257
Definitely not.
I must be going.

441
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:46,450
No, no. Stay, please.

442
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:48,886
If you hate Aladeen
and you like good food,

443
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:51,954
this is the place for you.
This way. Here we go.

444
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,974
Enjoy it.

445
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,948
No! No!

446
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,661
For you.

447
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,135
What is your name?

448
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:33,766
Allison Burgers.

449
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:37,304
That's a made-up name.
What's your real name?

450
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:42,072
Ladis.

451
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:43,406
Ladis what?

452
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:45,681
Ladis Washerum.

453
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:51,923
So your name
is like the sign. "Ladies Washroom"?

454
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,686
That is a made-up name.

455
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,617
What is your real name?

456
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:58,820
I am interested.
We are interested.

457
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:04,097
Emploice.

458
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:05,766
Emploice what?

459
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:08,507
Emploice... Muswashans.

460
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,600
That is a made-up name.

461
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,007
Okay.

462
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,208
What is your real name?

463
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:20,182
Max.

464
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:21,542
Max what?

465
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:25,519
Imunoccupancyu
One-hundred-and-twenty.

466
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,825
There's a number in the name?

467
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:33,525
Who are you?
An Aladeen sympathizer?

468
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:36,497
No, no, no!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay. No, no, no!

469
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:37,558
No!

470
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,070
It's Aladeen!
It's Aladeen without the beard!

471
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,202
No! It's not Aladeen!

472
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:44,134
Hasan, lock the door!

473
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,681
Wait, wait, wait, no!
There you are, cousin!

474
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,481
This is my cousin.
I see you've all met him.

475
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,483
He's very simple
and backwards. I'm sorry.

476
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:56,681
- Sorry.
- It's okay, sit.

477
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:58,087
- Okay.
- Sit and eat.

478
00:30:58,657 --> 00:30:59,920
Have a seat, cousin.

479
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,926
Very sorry.
My apologies. Enjoy.

480
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:06,222
What are you doing here?
And what has happened to your beard?

481
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,862
I've been replaced by this body
double who's a total imbecile.

482
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,594
How are you alive?

483
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,433
How am I... Wait.
You don't know?

484
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,666
No.

485
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:19,109
Every single person
you had executed is still alive.

486
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,536
We all live here
in Little Wadiya.

487
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:24,082
The executioner, he is
a member of the Resistance!

488
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:25,678
You mean I never
executed anybody?

489
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:26,775
No.

490
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,877
Like, honestly, zero people.

491
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:34,716
Nadal, you must help me
get back into power.

492
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:36,625
What? No.
Why would I do that?

493
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,095
I have a perfectly
good job here. I'm a Mac Genius!

494
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,923
What do you do?

495
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:47,269
Mostly, I clean
semen out of laptops.

496
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,532
Congratulations.
Living the American dream.

497
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,739
Okay, fine. I will help you.
On one condition.

498
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:55,075
Name it.

499
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:57,582
You reinstate me
as Head of Nuclear Research,

500
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,140
so I can finish
building my bomb.

501
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:00,541
Deal.

502
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,983
One last thing.

503
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,757
You will let me build
a round nuclear weapon.

504
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:08,085
Never.
It has to be pointy.

505
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:09,888
- Wait a minute. This is...
- Whoa.

506
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:13,828
- Okay. Deal.
- Deal.

507
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:18,097
Ladies and gentlemen
of the press,

508
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:21,501
our Supreme Leader
is indisposed to answer your questions

509
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:25,505
as he is currently
drafting Wadiya's new constitution,

510
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:27,837
which is scheduled to be signed

511
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:31,007
at the Lancaster Penthouse
Ballroom in three days.

512
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,778
Thank you.
No further questions.

513
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:49,258
There is no way we're going to
get anywhere near this hotel

514
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:51,701
without a security pass.
This is ridiculous.

515
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,133
- Wait.
- What are you doing?

516
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,364
Hiding from that lesbian hobbit.

517
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:57,968
That woman, you know her?

518
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,175
I cannot begin to tell you
what an honor it is

519
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:02,144
to be able to provide
all of the catering...

520
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:03,512
Well, of course.

521
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:04,878
And the mafroom
for this signing.

522
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,645
You just paid this month's rent!

523
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:08,787
She offered me a job.

524
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:11,619
Can you imagine that?
Me? Working?

525
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:15,158
Listen, hold onto that badge. It's the only
thing that'll get you past security.

526
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:16,195
Okay, thanks.

527
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:17,728
Wait a minute.

528
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:21,966
Wait, her company is catering the
event. She has a security pass!

529
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,329
That is the answer.
This is the plan.

530
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:26,894
Okay? You will take that
job and you will work for her.

531
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:30,073
I will get you
an identical beard and costume.

532
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:31,571
And then on
the day of the event,

533
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,737
you enter the Lancaster
as a member of her staff.

534
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,838
You will find the double,
switch with him,

535
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:39,384
then rip up the constitution
in front of the whole world.

536
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,049
Me? Work for that
hairy titted yeti?

537
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:01,164
Kimberly?

538
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:02,997
Zoey.

539
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,267
Who cares?

540
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:07,269
I've come here to apologise

541
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,945
about some of the comments
I may have made about

542
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:13,085
Captain Hook and Blackie.

543
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,043
Great!

544
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:18,686
And I accept your job offer
as general manager.

545
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:20,783
Well, you can't be the manager,
because I am the manager.

546
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:22,253
Well, I can if I killed you.

547
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,022
I think I'm starting to get you.

548
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:29,226
All right, then...
I will get you.

549
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:31,797
Great!
Let's get you to work!

550
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:33,897
Yeah?
Hold on one second.

551
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,768
Hey, my man!
Excuse me. Hairnet!

552
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:37,898
Yeah.

553
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,912
I need a little of the
quinoa salad, please,

554
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:43,911
and throw a couple of
extra cranny-b's on top, if you could,

555
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,914
and I kind of need you
to hurry up, chief. Chop-chop.

556
00:34:50,055 --> 00:34:51,045
Next!

557
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:54,926
Whoa, whoa!
Occupied!

558
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:57,292
Out. I have to clean.
Come on, out you go, out you go.

559
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:58,658
- What? You're hurting me!
- Out. Come on.

560
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:02,159
Hey, Allison,
can you take out the garbage? Thanks.

561
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:12,733
Look! One of the
customers left a tip of

562
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:17,415
some Nair and some female razors.
Does anybody want to use it?

563
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:23,847
Stop that.

564
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,154
Suck it, loser.

565
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:34,498
Clean-up on aisle four!

566
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:48,805
Hey, buddy, I saw that.

567
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,213
That is very disrespectful
to your leader.

568
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:52,508
Whatever, dude.
Who are you,

569
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:55,052
Osama bin Laden's best friend?

570
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,780
No, he is not my best friend!

571
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,651
Though he has been staying
in my guest house

572
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:01,818
ever since they shot
his double last year.

573
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,724
Now the guy won't leave.

574
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,025
I know why this guy's
the most hated man in the world.

575
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:09,124
You just have to go
to the bathroom after him.

576
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:11,169
You go to the bathroom
after Osama,

577
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:14,001
you will realise
the true meaning of terrorism.

578
00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:34,487
Here is the plan.

579
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,255
We're going to take
this helicopter tour

580
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,830
and fly over
the Lancaster to spot its weaknesses.

581
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:42,760
Remember, we're just two
ordinary American tourists

582
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:45,093
looking at the sights.

583
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:48,001
Don't worry, nobody gonna suspect
anything. It's a great plan.

584
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:49,874
Don't do anything
to arouse any suspicions.

585
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,843
Don't worry.
I am Wadiya's number one actor.

586
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:55,540
You don't win four
Wadiyan Golden Globes for nothing.

587
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:57,946
Yes, you do,
because you gave them to yourself!

588
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:01,113
My performance in
Aladeen Jones and the Temple of Doom

589
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,243
was outstanding.

590
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:03,719
I give it thumbs down.

591
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,518
Have you seen
You've Got Mail Bomb?

592
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:08,459
Yes, I've seen them all!
They're all terrible movies!

593
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,960
Listen to me. Okay?

594
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:12,093
You are a terrible actor.

595
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:16,362
I urge you, right now,
keep your performance small and real.

596
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,300
All right, can you
get me a cloak?

597
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,393
Why?

598
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:21,235
Because I think
my guy would be wearing a cloak.

599
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:25,573
No, your guy wears an American flag
sweatsuit and a sheriff's badge.

600
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:26,611
I need the sheriff's badge.

601
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,111
For what?

602
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:29,476
You're sheriff
of American douche-town!

603
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:31,249
That's rude.

604
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:32,306
Listen.

605
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:36,286
We're going to walk over
there, act very inconspicuous.

606
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:37,946
- Okay, great, okay.
- Okay, good.

607
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:39,581
Okay. So, when
we go to fly...

608
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:41,319
Don't do that with your eyes!

609
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,088
You can't be
a Chinese person on this thing, okay?

610
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:44,424
I'm not chink,
I'm Chinese-American!

611
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:45,589
No, but you cannot
hold your eyes!

612
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:46,926
Nobody is going to think
you're Chinese-American

613
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:47,966
because you hold
your eyes like that!

614
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:49,500
It's racist, what you are doing!

615
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:52,093
Do you know it's a fact
that they cannot pronounce their R's?

616
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,399
They pronounce them as L's.

617
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:55,337
So instead you know
what "rabbit" is in Chinese?

618
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,567
I don't know
how to speak Chinese.

619
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,837
- It's "labbit."
- It's not "labbit"!

620
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,572
Yes! Who Shot Loger Labbit
was a huge hit in China!

621
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:02,614
Nobody...
It's stup...

622
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,773
All right, I don't care.
This is stupid, okay?

623
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:06,812
Okay, I'll do Filipino.
I like to work, I like to talk.

624
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:08,147
- Don't.
- I like the shit, I do the kids.

625
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:09,243
Stop that.

626
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:12,820
Your Filipino
is the same as your Chinese!

627
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:14,690
Now who's being a lacist?

628
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,268
I love being an Americans!

629
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:33,836
America is number one!

630
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,638
I am from U.S.A.!

631
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:39,115
My father also
from U.S.A.

632
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:43,552
My great-grandfather fought
in the American Civil Jihad.

633
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,887
I am very proud
to be an American.

634
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,620
I am America's
number one douche.

635
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,966
I've fooled them. Job done.

636
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,567
So, how are things back at the Palace?

637
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,802
Fine, but guess
who's still living in my guest house?

638
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:04,832
Ooh, Bin Laden?

639
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:07,542
Yes, Osama.

640
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:10,240
Bin Laden flooding the bathroom
every time he showers...

641
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:14,217
And how hard is it to put a bath mat
down, Bin Laden?

642
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:19,214
Hey, do you remember
my favourite sports car?

643
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:20,849
You mean your Porsche?

644
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,416
Yes... the 911.

645
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,928
911, it's the best!

646
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:29,523
So I was driving my 911 near the
palace one day...

647
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:31,832
and I totally crashed!

648
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,205
It's ok, I've already ordered a new one.

649
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:41,212
A brand new 911 - 2012.

650
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:46,549
You know, while you are here, you
should try to see some of the sights...

651
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:49,747
such as the Empire State Building...

652
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:52,722
and Yankee Stadium.

653
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:57,387
And I'd love to see the fireworks
over the Statue of Liberty.

654
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:04,563
Hey, have your old back problems been
bothering you?

655
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:08,368
It's been terrible! It got so bad that
I made myself a back brace.

656
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:12,968
- Really?
- Yes, look, I'm still wearing it.

657
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:17,047
Hey, my English is getting good...

658
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:20,745
I bet I can count down from five
faster than you can!

659
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,986
Five, four, three, two, one!

660
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,725
Allison! Are you okay?

661
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,263
I... Yes.

662
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:34,959
You know what?
You people, you make me sick!

663
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:37,501
You see a Middle Easterner
on an aircraft

664
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,629
and you just assume
that he's hatching some violent plot?

665
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:45,267
Allison Burgers is a persecuted
dissident, not a murderous madman!

666
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:48,177
He was reported saying, "Let's take out
the guards at the Lancaster."

667
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,748
Guess what?
We deliver to the Lancaster!

668
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:51,805
Good one!

669
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:54,977
Maybe he wanted to
take the guards out for a falafel!

670
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:56,315
That's a bit of a stereotype,

671
00:40:56,421 --> 00:40:59,516
but I get the idea.
Great idea! Yeah. You...

672
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:02,617
You know what?
Is it a crime to care about your job?

673
00:41:02,694 --> 00:41:03,855
Yeah! Well,
it is in Wadiya.

674
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:07,465
Where did you get your diversity
and sensitivity training?

675
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:08,761
The Stasi?

676
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:12,827
Let's see how you feel about racial
profiling when white people...

677
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,975
And I know
what I'm talking about

678
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,714
because I majored in Fem Lit!

679
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:31,651
Come on.

680
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:34,990
Hey! What are you doing?
Where are you going?

681
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,027
Don't worry!

682
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:38,221
Just suck the fatoot
of the biggest guy, you'll be fine.

683
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,828
The police here
are such fascists!

684
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:42,992
Yeah, right,
and not in a good way.

685
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:44,729
It just makes me so mad!

686
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,533
You know, Zoey,
you were great back there.

687
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,231
Thanks. I just...

688
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,466
I don't know,
I just feel so sorry

689
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:52,874
that wherever
you go in the world,

690
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,639
you're the victim
of police abuse.

691
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:59,173
Come here.
I'm just so sorry! You're okay now.

692
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,377
All right?

693
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:02,852
And I'm not gonna
let anything bad happen to you.

694
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,650
You know what? Let's get you
back to the collective, okay?

695
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:06,391
Come on.

696
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:07,481
No, a bit more.

697
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:09,390
Okay.

698
00:42:10,061 --> 00:42:12,053
- Come on, let's go. I need to go to work.
- I feel so sad!

699
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:14,824
Let's do another hug, okay?

700
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,594
Allison, why are you sad?

701
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:19,101
The brutality?

702
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:21,202
Did you suffer
from sexual abuse?

703
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:24,401
Yes, they raped me in
a very unprofessional way.

704
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:27,746
No.
We have to get you to the Rape Center.

705
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:29,677
You have a center for rape here?

706
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:32,012
Great! I'd love to go!
Maybe another time, you know.

707
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:35,542
Hire a limo, have some
cocktails, bring my raping shoes.

708
00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:41,588
It was literally
the tour from hell...

709
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:44,685
Look, Supreme Leader is
on the talking painting.

710
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:45,889
With shades of 9/11,

711
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:49,024
their helicopter tour
of the Manhattan skyline was cut short

712
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:52,366
by what police are now
calling a "terrorism misunderstanding"

713
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:57,098
involving a man named
Emer Gencyexitonly.

714
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:58,232
Maroush!

715
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:01,041
Double the security
around the hotel.

716
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:03,308
The signing must
not be disrupted!

717
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:09,253
Hannah, that guy from the
Lancaster's coming tomorrow morning,

718
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,118
so why don't you take
the mafroom downstairs

719
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:13,214
and make some sort of
a nice display?

720
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:15,884
I just want everything
to be perfect.

721
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:17,587
Zoey?

722
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:18,823
Allison. Hi.

723
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:21,591
To thank you for what you did
today at the police station,

724
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:23,931
I have decided to
bestow upon you a gift.

725
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:26,635
- That's sweet. What is it?
- Yeah.

726
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:36,674
I don't know what that is.

727
00:43:36,848 --> 00:43:38,316
It's fine.
It's fine.

728
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:42,686
No!

729
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:46,246
No, I am not going to do that.

730
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:48,789
I'm getting a lot of this
and not much of this...

731
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,626
Listen, I understand
that you're having urges, okay?

732
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:55,758
Right.

733
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:58,428
But you need to
take care of them by yourself.

734
00:43:58,703 --> 00:44:00,535
Myself? What? How?

735
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:02,330
You need to touch yourself.

736
00:44:02,507 --> 00:44:05,170
I don't touch myself.
Do you touch yourself?

737
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:07,808
I think most
healthy people do, yes.

738
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:11,213
Yeah, you touch your own
malawach? Disgusting! Yuck!

739
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,374
Yuck!

740
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:16,052
Stop joking, all right?
You've never jerked off?

741
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:19,648
Okay, come with me.

742
00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:21,716
Where are you taking me to?
The Rape Center?

743
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:27,287
This is silly.

744
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:28,964
Okay...

745
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:32,369
Take your penis out
and put it in your hands.

746
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:33,494
This is silly.

747
00:44:35,473 --> 00:44:39,410
Now, slowly move your hand
up and down.

748
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,569
Okay.

749
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:43,574
I told you already, this is...

750
00:44:46,918 --> 00:44:48,079
Wait.

751
00:44:48,553 --> 00:44:50,351
What sorcery is this?

752
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:53,482
Some people wait a lifetime

753
00:44:53,558 --> 00:44:58,258
For a moment like this

754
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,594
Some people wait a lifetime

755
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,601
For a moment like this

756
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:10,039
Whoa, I can't believe
it's happening to me

757
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:13,043
Some people wait a lifetime

758
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:18,606
For a moment like this

759
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:27,589
I can't believe
it's happening to me

760
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,859
I did it!
I just jerked it completely off!

761
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:33,397
I did it all by myself!

762
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:35,797
With this hand right here!

763
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:39,098
I grabbed my bilbul
like I was strangling a bird.

764
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:41,365
And I smacked it
and I smacked it and I gave it a flick,

765
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:42,907
and out came my own labeneh!

766
00:45:42,974 --> 00:45:44,033
Zoey?

767
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,877
Zoey! You have
changed my life!

768
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:50,773
Give a man a vagina
and he will shpichs for a day.

769
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:53,908
Teach a man to use
his hand as a vagina,

770
00:45:53,985 --> 00:45:56,454
and he will shpichs
for a lifetime.

771
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,581
Is something the matter?

772
00:46:00,658 --> 00:46:04,425
That was the guy from the Lancaster on
the phone. They just fired us!

773
00:46:04,629 --> 00:46:05,653
What? Why?

774
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:09,427
He said he came by
and someone kicked his son.

775
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:12,994
They've given the contract
to Green World Market.

776
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:14,637
We must get the contract back.

777
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:16,230
I have to be at the signing.

778
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:19,944
I don't know what to say!
My staff lacks the discipline

779
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:22,242
and motivation to do this job.

780
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,446
We will see about that.

781
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:27,610
But from now on, it is my way

782
00:46:27,685 --> 00:46:30,519
or the highwahahtmaa -
fferrohshelechnichway.

783
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:31,847
Okay?

784
00:46:33,024 --> 00:46:35,459
There has been a regime change!

785
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:37,859
Yo! You are
stocking the shelves.

786
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:40,697
You, senile Romanian accountant.

787
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,460
You are on the cash register.

788
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:46,536
The CEO of Green World
does not drive a hybrid!

789
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,968
The chemicals
in Green World produce

790
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:53,370
made this boy grow tits?

791
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:01,212
You promise not to steal again?

792
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:02,981
I won't. I won't!

793
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,950
Give him one more
for fun, Viktor.

794
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:26,375
Good choice.

795
00:47:41,092 --> 00:47:42,754
Hi, Viktor.

796
00:47:58,776 --> 00:48:00,369
Supreme Grocer.

797
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:02,208
The radicchio
has been washed and sorted,

798
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:04,043
and the spray hose
has been tightly coiled.

799
00:48:04,115 --> 00:48:05,777
Very good. Now go upstairs

800
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,114
and finish composting
the wheatgrass tailings, okay?

801
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,448
Yes, Supreme Grocer.

802
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:12,787
Zoey!

803
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,121
What? Look...

804
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,784
Wow!

805
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:18,896
It's amazing!

806
00:48:18,963 --> 00:48:21,728
It's not amazing.
It's just a little less shit.

807
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:23,796
Well, thank you.

808
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:26,765
- Sorry.
- Of course.

809
00:48:26,871 --> 00:48:29,739
- Personal.
- Thank you. Thank you again.

810
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,810
- Hello?
- I have some very good news.

811
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:34,935
What is it?

812
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:38,641
I managed to buy some beards at the
wig store today that are perfect.

813
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,945
No, Nadal, it must be real hair.

814
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:43,077
- And from the head of a great man!
- What?

815
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:44,816
Like Castro or Gandalf.

816
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,151
No...

817
00:48:48,993 --> 00:48:51,656
Well done, Nadal.
This beard is perfect.

818
00:48:56,834 --> 00:48:58,928
Those are lovely flowers.

819
00:48:59,003 --> 00:49:00,938
You know, Zoey is
thinking of opening

820
00:49:01,005 --> 00:49:03,338
an eco-friendly
flower section to the store.

821
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:06,741
This is the fifth time you've mentioned
her today. What is going on?

822
00:49:06,811 --> 00:49:08,473
The signing is in two days.

823
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:10,411
Tell me you're not
falling for this woman!

824
00:49:10,848 --> 00:49:13,511
Of course I'm not.
This is silly.

825
00:49:13,851 --> 00:49:16,844
Okay, good. All we need to do
is slip into this chapel...

826
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,115
And yet, it's strange.

827
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:20,124
The other day,
I asked her to, you know,

828
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:22,854
gobble on my bilbul
and she said, "No."

829
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,952
So obviously
I wanted to execute her.

830
00:49:25,029 --> 00:49:28,295
But the thought of
her decapitated head actually upset me,

831
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:30,129
- so I decided not to do it.
- No.

832
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:33,535
When the thought of someone's
decapitated head upsets you,

833
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,367
that is love.

834
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,632
- I swear, I don't even like her at all.
- You don't like her?

835
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,540
She has the body shape
of a 14-year-old boy.

836
00:49:41,879 --> 00:49:45,646
Well, that is
a particular weakness of yours.

837
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,651
Need I remind you of
the Menudo incident?

838
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:49,616
Those boys had their eyes open.

839
00:49:49,687 --> 00:49:50,985
They knew exactly
what they were doing.

840
00:49:51,055 --> 00:49:52,546
We made them
have their eyes open.

841
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,818
You made me hold
one of their eyes open,

842
00:49:54,892 --> 00:49:56,520
so they'd see what
you were doing to them.

843
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:59,153
They seemed to be having
a pretty good time.

844
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,699
They were not.
Those boys were crying.

845
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,228
Three of them killed themselves!

846
00:50:04,235 --> 00:50:05,362
Nothing to do with me.

847
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,836
Everything to do with you!
A lot of them wrote notes.

848
00:50:07,905 --> 00:50:10,636
In their suicide notes
they named you by name!

849
00:50:10,808 --> 00:50:13,073
It's all a rumor.
And you're being silly.

850
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,712
- Go there.
- Okay. Here we go.

851
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,419
Hello?
Somebody in here?

852
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,690
Nadal!
The Sub-Saharans have discovered us!

853
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:34,356
- What? Okay, okay, okay!
- Hurry, hurry!

854
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:36,525
- Just a moment!
- Open this door!

855
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,501
- No, no, no!
- Open the door now!

856
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,261
Quick! Plan B! Plan B!

857
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:51,773
Why did you chop off his head?

858
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:52,941
You said Plan B!

859
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,848
Plan B was to have
coffee and regroup,

860
00:50:54,919 --> 00:50:57,252
it was not to chop his head off!

861
00:51:05,296 --> 00:51:07,094
Good morning, Nadal!

862
00:51:07,965 --> 00:51:10,298
Wake up!
Good morning, Nadal!

863
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:14,429
No, no, no, no, no, no!

864
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:15,629
Get this away from me!

865
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,968
You know, me and you
are quite a team.

866
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,064
No, no.

867
00:51:18,142 --> 00:51:19,576
You know who else
makes a great team?

868
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:22,112
Ebony and ivory

869
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:23,612
No, no, no!

870
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,079
Live together in perfect harmony

871
00:51:25,149 --> 00:51:26,117
What is wrong with you?
Get it out of here!

872
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:27,206
Good one.

873
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:34,625
Splish splash
I was taking a bath!

874
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:37,152
No! Get it out of here!

875
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:39,991
That is weird.

876
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:46,334
I threw in some carob-covered goji
berries, just as a treat. Enjoy.

877
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:51,104
Thank you. That's very kind of
you. You're a very nice man.

878
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:53,667
What the fuck did you call me?

879
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:56,510
I said you were nice!

880
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:05,455
Allison! The Lancaster just
called! We got the contract back!

881
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:07,616
- Great! Whatever!
- I know!

882
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:10,024
Green World is shutting down
their Manhattan store!

883
00:52:10,361 --> 00:52:12,262
I wonder what
could have happened?

884
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:16,323
Be careful with that,
sweetheart. Be careful.

885
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:19,365
Yeah, we're going to
have a nice big salad.

886
00:52:20,204 --> 00:52:21,934
Celebratory cuddle?

887
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,633
Well done!

888
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,208
- You smell bad.
- I know.

889
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:27,803
Help!

890
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:30,109
Somebody help!
My wife is in labor!

891
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,040
My God!
My God!

892
00:52:32,216 --> 00:52:35,015
Baby? The ambulance can't
be here for 20 minutes. Can you hold it?

893
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:36,781
I can't hold it!
It's coming out!

894
00:52:37,054 --> 00:52:38,181
It's coming out!

895
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,985
Does anyone have
any medical experience?

896
00:52:41,225 --> 00:52:44,821
I was Wadiya's Chief Surgeon
for the last 22 years.

897
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:46,893
Please.
Please help us. Please.

898
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,156
- Allison, they need your help. Come on.
- Okay, fine.

899
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,790
Come on.

900
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:52,360
Are you okay?

901
00:52:53,804 --> 00:52:55,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

902
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:56,972
Sorry! Old habits die hard.

903
00:52:57,408 --> 00:52:59,070
All right, I'm going in.

904
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,035
That's the wrong hole!

905
00:53:02,146 --> 00:53:04,081
- What?
- You just put your fist up the wrong hole.

906
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:05,876
If I had a dollar for
every time I heard that.

907
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:08,810
Get it outta there.

908
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,512
- Going in again.
- Okay, good.

909
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,248
Still my asshole!

910
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,015
What is wrong with you, man?

911
00:53:15,092 --> 00:53:16,560
You just put it in
my asshole again!

912
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,151
Just go up from where you are.

913
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,491
The good news is,
your prostate is completely healthy.

914
00:53:22,433 --> 00:53:24,095
That's good. That's good.

915
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:25,734
- Going in again.
- Okay, good.

916
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,601
Hold on.

917
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:33,001
What are you...

918
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:36,874
Allison, stop it!
You need two hands!

919
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,375
But I'm in the middle
of the text.

920
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:40,208
It's coming out!

921
00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:46,856
- Where is that coming from?
- What?

922
00:53:52,129 --> 00:53:54,121
I'm really sorry.
I'm gonna have to take this call.

923
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:55,696
Is there a phone in my body?

924
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:57,298
What are you doing?

925
00:53:57,434 --> 00:53:58,800
I'm in the Lincoln Tunnel.

926
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:01,369
What? Okay, look.
We need to talk for a minute.

927
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:03,640
Hello, Nadal.
Listen, I can't speak now.

928
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,232
I'll speak to you later,
okay? Bye!

929
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:07,477
Stop talking to my vagina!

930
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:11,475
Zoey, the baby's stuck. I need you to put
your hand in and help me.

931
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:13,045
- What? No...
- Come on! Put it in!

932
00:54:13,117 --> 00:54:14,813
- No, don't be scared. Put it in.
- Okay. Okay.

933
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,417
- I'm sorry.
- Put it right there on the right side.

934
00:54:16,487 --> 00:54:18,422
- My gosh. My gosh!
- Push in.

935
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,717
I think I feel an arm!

936
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:23,316
That's my finger.

937
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,266
Excuse me. You guys
make a really cute couple together.

938
00:54:39,343 --> 00:54:40,971
But maybe could you finish doing this

939
00:54:41,078 --> 00:54:43,013
when you're not elbow-deep
in my pussy!

940
00:54:43,347 --> 00:54:45,578
Okay, Allison,
you've got the head?

941
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:47,613
- I've got the head.
- Okay, it's coming out.

942
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:48,743
Come on, push!

943
00:54:51,188 --> 00:54:54,022
Where are the rebel bases?
Where are the rebel bases?

944
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:55,917
Sorry, sorry.

945
00:54:56,193 --> 00:54:59,163
Wait, I can see the head!
I can see the head!

946
00:54:59,263 --> 00:55:00,356
I can't push any more!

947
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:07,303
You did it!
You did it!

948
00:55:15,546 --> 00:55:16,878
I sentence you

949
00:55:17,214 --> 00:55:18,705
to life.

950
00:55:21,218 --> 00:55:22,311
It's still attached!

951
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:24,387
Sorry. No.

952
00:55:24,555 --> 00:55:25,887
- What's wrong?
- I'm sorry.

953
00:55:26,123 --> 00:55:27,614
It's bad news.

954
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:29,051
It's a girl.

955
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:32,219
Where's the trash can?

956
00:55:32,462 --> 00:55:34,454
No, no, no, no!
That's what we wanted!

957
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:36,361
We'll take her, we'll take her.

958
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:37,456
Baby.

959
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,839
You were so amazing down there.

960
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,235
You saved
a little person's life.

961
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,013
It feels so nice to kiss you.

962
00:55:58,088 --> 00:55:59,522
I know. It's nice
to kiss you, too.

963
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:01,081
I love the hugging.

964
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:02,925
I just came.

965
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,687
I don't care.

966
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,193
Lie back.

967
00:56:10,267 --> 00:56:11,257
Okay.

968
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,030
This is going to be
amazing for you.

969
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:14,435
Okay!

970
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:29,543
See you in 15 minutes.

971
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:33,181
Okay.

972
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,564
Wait, wait.

973
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,233
Wait.

974
00:56:47,471 --> 00:56:49,633
Allison,
before we go any further,

975
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,300
there's something
that I want to tell you.

976
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:55,136
You've got a dick.
I knew it.

977
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:58,041
Allison, I don't have a dick.

978
00:56:58,282 --> 00:56:59,545
Great!

979
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:02,081
What I wanted to
tell you was this.

980
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:05,316
I really want
to be with you, Allison Burgers.

981
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:07,419
Zoey,

982
00:57:09,226 --> 00:57:11,286
I'm not really Allison Burgers.

983
00:57:12,396 --> 00:57:15,059
I'm actually
a little somebody called

984
00:57:16,066 --> 00:57:18,058
Admiral General

985
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:19,998
Aladeen.

986
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,603
No, what's your real name?

987
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,574
Wait, this will convince you.

988
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:31,438
Look, it's me!

989
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:35,746
The weapons inspectors
will bathe in their own blood!

990
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:38,422
That's your beard?

991
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:40,514
No, no, no!
It's not my beard.

992
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:42,650
My friend chopped the head
off Morgan Freeman.

993
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:44,525
You're a murderer!

994
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:46,921
No, no, no!
Zoey, Zoey, Zoey! No.

995
00:57:46,997 --> 00:57:50,263
You were just using me
to get access to that hotel!

996
00:57:50,334 --> 00:57:51,495
No!

997
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:55,197
Zoey, I'm attracted to you
in a really fucked-up way.

998
00:57:55,706 --> 00:57:57,698
My God!

999
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:00,533
I'm canceling that
contract tomorrow!

1000
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:03,309
No, Zoey! What have
I ever done wrong?

1001
00:58:03,547 --> 00:58:05,516
You lied to me!

1002
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:08,050
And you're wanted
for war crimes!

1003
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,710
That stuff never sticks.

1004
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,016
You need to leave now.

1005
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:14,653
Okay.

1006
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,825
I'll go.

1007
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:42,183
With the signing of the
constitution tomorrow morning,

1008
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:44,812
democracy in Wadiya
is just hours away,

1009
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:47,221
and people are
in the streets celebrating.

1010
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:51,519
Kill Aladeen, kill Aladeen, hey!

1011
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,902
Kill Aladeen, kill Aladeen, hey!

1012
00:59:17,354 --> 00:59:18,913
- Good-bye!
- Stop, stop, wait!

1013
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:20,354
What are you doing?

1014
00:59:23,193 --> 00:59:24,855
I am executing myself!

1015
00:59:25,195 --> 00:59:26,527
What? Why?

1016
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:28,289
Because no one
has ever loved me!

1017
00:59:28,632 --> 00:59:30,692
Your father would
be ashamed of you!

1018
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:33,396
No, I've realised
I don't want to be like my father!

1019
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:36,030
In fact,
I don't want to be a dictator any more!

1020
00:59:36,106 --> 00:59:37,267
What's that now?

1021
00:59:37,474 --> 00:59:40,273
I've been on a spiritual journey,
man, like Eat, Pray, Love.

1022
00:59:41,545 --> 00:59:43,207
Have you gone insane?

1023
00:59:43,447 --> 00:59:45,473
I now know that on the outside,

1024
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:46,948
I am a bit of a cocksucker.

1025
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,118
- Yeah.
- But deep down I'm nice.

1026
00:59:50,387 --> 00:59:52,720
- Not really.
- Yes, I am! I'm like mafroom.

1027
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:55,117
Hard and spiky on the outside,

1028
00:59:55,225 --> 00:59:57,285
but soft and
really mushy on the in.

1029
00:59:57,494 --> 01:00:00,828
You're not like
mafroom at all. You're like an onion.

1030
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:03,100
An outer layer of cocksucker,

1031
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:04,600
and when you peel it away,

1032
01:00:04,668 --> 01:00:07,399
there is 10 more layers
of cocksucker underneath.

1033
01:00:09,506 --> 01:00:10,838
You are such a schmuck!

1034
01:00:11,141 --> 01:00:13,667
- Why are you speaking Yiddish?
- I picked it up.

1035
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:16,279
What do you mean,
"I picked it up"? Who picks up Yiddish?

1036
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:17,507
I'm in New York!

1037
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,845
We're trying to erase
that country off the map!

1038
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:22,010
I don't like the people,
but I like the way that

1039
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,782
their words really sound like
what they're meant to be.

1040
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:27,689
I'm sorry! Did I not get the
Evite to your bar mitzvah?

1041
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:28,952
My God!

1042
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:31,085
You've got real
chutzpah saying that!

1043
01:00:31,161 --> 01:00:33,357
Look, where has being
a nice guy gotten you?

1044
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,859
Standing on the edge
of a bridge about to commit suicide?

1045
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:37,025
Still wearing Crocs?

1046
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:39,135
What's wrong with Crocs?

1047
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:42,195
They are the universal symbol of a
man who has given up hope!

1048
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,309
You might as well
put sweatpants on

1049
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:47,310
and go to Applebee's
for the rest of your life!

1050
01:00:48,345 --> 01:00:50,314
I'll give you that one.
I do look ridiculous.

1051
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:54,215
Yes! Listen, if you won't
come down from there for yourself,

1052
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,546
do it for your country.

1053
01:00:55,719 --> 01:00:57,483
If this constitution is signed,

1054
01:00:57,554 --> 01:01:00,786
there will be free press,
women drivers, civil rights!

1055
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:02,050
What are "civil rights"?

1056
01:01:02,359 --> 01:01:04,624
I'll tell you later.
They're hilarious.

1057
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:08,565
Look, you alone can stop
these terrible things from happening.

1058
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:11,460
You are the last great dictator!

1059
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:14,030
All of the others
are gone! Qaddafi,

1060
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,729
Saddam, Kim Jong, Cheney.

1061
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:20,242
You are right, Nadal.

1062
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:22,804
I will become
the greatest dictator of all,

1063
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:24,871
the envy of madmen everywhere!

1064
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:26,674
Yes, Supreme Leader!

1065
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:30,152
From the mountaintops of North Korea
to the jungles of Zimbabwe,

1066
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:34,487
let every child laborer
and sweatshop factory worker sing,

1067
01:01:34,558 --> 01:01:37,221
"Oppressed at last!
Oppressed at last!

1068
01:01:37,594 --> 01:01:40,393
"Thank Aladeen,
I am oppressed at last!"

1069
01:01:40,497 --> 01:01:41,658
Yes! Whoa!

1070
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:43,029
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

1071
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:44,499
- No, no, no, no, don't fall.
- I'm not doing anything.

1072
01:01:44,568 --> 01:01:47,231
Just do like a pull-up.
You know how you do pull-ups?

1073
01:01:47,337 --> 01:01:48,532
I invented the pull-up.

1074
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:55,903
If you're just joining us, we
are at the Lancaster Hotel,

1075
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:57,708
where in about 20 minutes,

1076
01:01:57,781 --> 01:02:01,582
General Aladeen will be signing the
new Wadiyan constitution.

1077
01:02:01,685 --> 01:02:03,551
Dignitaries from
around the world

1078
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:06,556
are arriving now to witness
the creation of a democracy

1079
01:02:06,623 --> 01:02:09,388
that will undoubtedly change
the political landscape

1080
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:11,189
of the entire region.

1081
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:14,454
As Wadiya goes,
so goes North Africa.

1082
01:02:21,805 --> 01:02:26,072
Edward Norton,
tell Viggo Mortensen he is on my radar.

1083
01:02:27,544 --> 01:02:29,911
How do you say,
"Fly is in the soup"?

1084
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,812
Gentlemen, Tamir.

1085
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:34,309
Let me introduce you
to my beautiful wife.

1086
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:37,285
Mrs Lao, it is my
very great pleasure.

1087
01:02:37,387 --> 01:02:39,549
No, no, no, no.
She does not speak English.

1088
01:02:39,623 --> 01:02:40,818
Watch this.

1089
01:02:41,558 --> 01:02:43,151
You ugly horse!

1090
01:02:43,827 --> 01:02:44,886
She doesn't know.

1091
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:49,660
"Oh" See?
She goes "Oh" all the time. Watch.

1092
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:51,895
Shaved ape.

1093
01:03:07,017 --> 01:03:10,010
Wait. That is how you intend to get me
across to the Lancaster?

1094
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:11,346
Absolutely.

1095
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:12,786
- Where'd you get that?
- I built it.

1096
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:15,454
When I was going
to assassinate you.

1097
01:03:15,859 --> 01:03:16,952
You mean my double.

1098
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:20,995
Sure. Yeah.

1099
01:03:28,772 --> 01:03:30,673
Bingo!

1100
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:34,700
Love it!

1101
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:35,835
- Here's what you do.
- Okay.

1102
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:38,938
Zipline across, kill the double,

1103
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:41,610
and then rip up the constitution in
front of the world's media.

1104
01:03:41,685 --> 01:03:42,675
Piece of cake.

1105
01:03:57,067 --> 01:03:59,332
Hello, Lancaster!

1106
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:09,574
I don't understand
what has happened.

1107
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,739
My calculations
were very precise.

1108
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:14,384
If you lose enough weight,
then the zipline will work.

1109
01:04:14,484 --> 01:04:16,180
Do you have anything
in your pockets?

1110
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:17,914
Let me check.

1111
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:22,085
What is that?

1112
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:23,490
It's Vita Coco water.

1113
01:04:24,094 --> 01:04:25,585
Why do you have Vita Coco water?

1114
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:28,358
Because it has
as much potassium as three bananas.

1115
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:30,024
The line is still too heavy.

1116
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:32,535
Is there anything else in your pockets
that could be weighing you down?

1117
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:37,371
You're kidding. So then why did
you bring three bananas?

1118
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,070
Because I don't trust the
advertising. I'm naturally suspicious.

1119
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:44,203
Is there anything else you're
carrying? You're still too heavy.

1120
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,407
Just this.

1121
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,377
What is that, a brick?

1122
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:50,886
All this time you've had a
brick? Why do you have that?

1123
01:04:50,954 --> 01:04:52,889
Well, to balance out
the weight from the other one.

1124
01:04:52,956 --> 01:04:54,219
You have two bricks?

1125
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:55,349
Yes!

1126
01:04:55,425 --> 01:04:56,916
Throw them down immediately!

1127
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:03,933
My God!
There's a little goat eating the wire!

1128
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:08,802
You need to lose
weight immediately!

1129
01:05:09,139 --> 01:05:11,768
My pockets are empty.
I could poo.

1130
01:05:12,142 --> 01:05:13,735
That won't be enough
to make a difference.

1131
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:16,370
Yes, it will.
I haven't gone since Wadiya.

1132
01:05:16,446 --> 01:05:19,075
Losing power
has stopped me up like a cork.

1133
01:05:19,149 --> 01:05:20,447
Hurry!

1134
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:23,110
Come on, Supreme Leader!
Make it rain! Make it rain!

1135
01:05:24,721 --> 01:05:26,952
It's out!
And it's pointy!

1136
01:05:27,991 --> 01:05:29,289
Somebody stop that man!

1137
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:32,151
Yes!

1138
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:34,725
What? No, no, no, no!

1139
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:36,488
No, no, no!

1140
01:06:00,886 --> 01:06:02,445
Supreme Leader!

1141
01:06:05,824 --> 01:06:08,020
Get out of here
before Tamir kills you.

1142
01:06:08,727 --> 01:06:09,820
Who is Tamir?

1143
01:06:10,229 --> 01:06:11,663
Tamir...

1144
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:14,393
The bald bastard
who did all these terrible things to us!

1145
01:06:15,234 --> 01:06:16,896
I thought his name was Dennis.

1146
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:23,135
How would you
even make that leap? Tamir to Dennis?

1147
01:06:24,343 --> 01:06:26,335
- Go on, get out! Get out!
- Come on, Montzi!

1148
01:06:26,412 --> 01:06:27,402
Quick!

1149
01:06:30,649 --> 01:06:32,174
Just jump.
It's not that far.

1150
01:06:33,385 --> 01:06:34,648
Efawadh.

1151
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,382
It is almost time.

1152
01:06:39,191 --> 01:06:41,524
I like goats.

1153
01:06:42,695 --> 01:06:45,164
I am very stupid.

1154
01:06:47,066 --> 01:06:48,364
This is an historic moment.

1155
01:06:49,268 --> 01:06:52,102
Admiral General
Aladeen of Wadiya

1156
01:06:52,204 --> 01:06:53,695
is going to be signing

1157
01:06:53,772 --> 01:06:57,436
the first democratic
constitution in the history of his nation.

1158
01:06:57,543 --> 01:07:01,537
Across the globe,
people are glued to their television sets.

1159
01:07:01,613 --> 01:07:04,208
The people of Wadiya
are celebrating

1160
01:07:04,283 --> 01:07:07,117
what will be
a new chapter in their country.

1161
01:07:07,953 --> 01:07:10,889
Just moments away now
from putting his signature

1162
01:07:10,956 --> 01:07:13,289
on the first
democratic constitution.

1163
01:07:14,059 --> 01:07:16,893
That's Tamir Mafraad,
Aladeen's trusted advisor,

1164
01:07:16,962 --> 01:07:20,023
sharing a lighthearted moment with
Chinese businessman, Xiang Lao.

1165
01:07:20,099 --> 01:07:21,931
Any thoughts on
what they might be saying, Mike?

1166
01:07:22,034 --> 01:07:24,936
I thought I made out
the words "Harvey Keitel."

1167
01:07:27,473 --> 01:07:29,101
Don't know what that meant.

1168
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:31,939
Maybe they shared
a hot dog together, I'm thinking?

1169
01:07:32,044 --> 01:07:36,414
That would make sense. He's wiping the
mustard off his face and chest.

1170
01:07:36,482 --> 01:07:37,780
Excuse me!

1171
01:07:37,883 --> 01:07:39,374
You have to let me in.
You don't understand.

1172
01:07:39,451 --> 01:07:41,079
He's trying to stop the signing!

1173
01:07:41,153 --> 01:07:42,746
Tamir is now speaking.

1174
01:07:42,821 --> 01:07:43,811
Today,

1175
01:07:44,490 --> 01:07:46,254
we begin a new era.

1176
01:07:46,825 --> 01:07:49,818
Wadiya will be
open to the world.

1177
01:07:49,928 --> 01:07:51,487
Open to the future.

1178
01:07:51,597 --> 01:07:53,122
And open for business.

1179
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:58,002
The document is
ready to be signed, Supreme Leader.

1180
01:08:06,612 --> 01:08:09,411
What are you doing?
This man is an imposter!

1181
01:08:09,481 --> 01:08:13,942
No! This traitor tried to kill me
and had my beard removed!

1182
01:08:14,019 --> 01:08:16,250
Look!

1183
01:08:16,321 --> 01:08:18,756
Arrest the viper Tamir!

1184
01:08:18,824 --> 01:08:20,486
And now in another

1185
01:08:20,592 --> 01:08:24,256
amazing turn of events,
Tamir Mafraad is being taken away.

1186
01:08:24,329 --> 01:08:26,821
This constitution

1187
01:08:26,932 --> 01:08:29,629
is nothing
but a license for oil companies

1188
01:08:29,701 --> 01:08:33,160
and foreign interests
to destroy my beloved Wadiya!

1189
01:08:33,272 --> 01:08:36,936
Wadiya will remain
a dictatorship!

1190
01:08:46,718 --> 01:08:48,050
Be quiet.

1191
01:08:48,453 --> 01:08:51,446
Why are you guys
so anti dictators?

1192
01:08:51,723 --> 01:08:54,557
Imagine if America
was a dictatorship.

1193
01:08:54,893 --> 01:08:59,126
You could let 1% of the people
have all the nation's wealth.

1194
01:08:59,464 --> 01:09:00,955
You could help your rich friends

1195
01:09:01,033 --> 01:09:03,525
get richer by
cutting their taxes

1196
01:09:03,635 --> 01:09:06,901
and bailing them out
when they gamble and lose.

1197
01:09:07,339 --> 01:09:11,674
You could ignore the needs of the poor
for health care and education.

1198
01:09:11,743 --> 01:09:13,371
Your media would appear free

1199
01:09:13,478 --> 01:09:17,643
but would secretly be controlled
by one person and his family.

1200
01:09:17,716 --> 01:09:21,915
You could wiretap phones,
you could torture foreign prisoners.

1201
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:24,182
You could have rigged elections.

1202
01:09:24,256 --> 01:09:26,384
You could lie about
why you go to war.

1203
01:09:26,925 --> 01:09:28,689
You could fill your prisons

1204
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:32,424
with one particular racial group
and no one would complain!

1205
01:09:32,764 --> 01:09:36,098
You could use the media
to scare the people

1206
01:09:36,201 --> 01:09:40,104
into supporting policies
that are against their interests.

1207
01:09:40,205 --> 01:09:43,573
I know this is hard
for you Americans to imagine,

1208
01:09:43,675 --> 01:09:45,610
but please try.

1209
01:09:45,711 --> 01:09:47,942
I will tell you
what democracy is!

1210
01:09:48,413 --> 01:09:50,541
Democracy is the worst!

1211
01:09:50,616 --> 01:09:53,552
Endless talking
and listening to every stupid opinion!

1212
01:09:53,619 --> 01:09:55,713
And everybody's vote counts,

1213
01:09:55,787 --> 01:09:59,451
no matter how
crippled or black or female they are.

1214
01:10:00,359 --> 01:10:01,759
Democracy...

1215
01:10:08,467 --> 01:10:09,765
Democracy

1216
01:10:11,136 --> 01:10:15,267
has hairy armpits
and could lose five pounds.

1217
01:10:16,475 --> 01:10:19,775
Democracy looks like
a midget in a chemo wig.

1218
01:10:20,779 --> 01:10:23,408
Democracy kisses you
because she wants to,

1219
01:10:23,482 --> 01:10:27,385
not because her father
is in the next room chained to a radiator

1220
01:10:27,452 --> 01:10:29,717
with electrodes
attached to his nipples.

1221
01:10:30,422 --> 01:10:34,757
Democracy is flawed!
She is not perfect!

1222
01:10:35,427 --> 01:10:36,918
But democracy,

1223
01:10:40,499 --> 01:10:41,489
I love you.

1224
01:10:42,634 --> 01:10:45,729
And that is
why I call for real democracy!

1225
01:10:45,804 --> 01:10:47,602
A real constitution!

1226
01:10:47,673 --> 01:10:49,642
And real elections in Wadiya!

1227
01:10:56,248 --> 01:10:58,240
No!

1228
01:10:59,151 --> 01:11:00,312
Come on!

1229
01:11:07,192 --> 01:11:10,356
Democracy,
I will make you one of my wives.

1230
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:13,865
Okay, only wife.
We'll vote on it.

1231
01:11:14,499 --> 01:11:16,365
I'll shave my armpits for you.

1232
01:11:16,468 --> 01:11:18,528
Praise be to the Creator!

1233
01:11:18,637 --> 01:11:21,038
And please stop using
that organic deodorant.

1234
01:11:21,139 --> 01:11:23,370
You could gas the Kurds
with that stench.

1235
01:11:50,502 --> 01:11:52,403
You died protecting me, Efawadh.

1236
01:11:53,171 --> 01:11:54,161
Hello!

1237
01:11:54,473 --> 01:11:55,463
You are alive?

1238
01:11:55,674 --> 01:11:58,644
Of course!
It is my job to be shot in the head.

1239
01:12:02,314 --> 01:12:04,180
- Is he okay?
- He's fine.

1240
01:12:04,249 --> 01:12:06,878
Luckily the bullet
hit him in the brain.

1241
01:12:07,986 --> 01:12:09,818
So,

1242
01:12:11,256 --> 01:12:12,315
what now?

1243
01:12:12,591 --> 01:12:15,925
I return to Wadiya
to participate in fair elections.

1244
01:12:27,939 --> 01:12:31,501
Let's now look back
at the wonderful events of the past year.

1245
01:12:31,576 --> 01:12:34,341
After Wadiya's
first free elections,

1246
01:12:34,413 --> 01:12:37,383
President Prime Minister
Admiral General Aladeen

1247
01:12:37,449 --> 01:12:40,009
won 98.8% of the vote.

1248
01:12:42,587 --> 01:12:46,183
But the big story today is the
marriage of President Prime Minister

1249
01:12:46,258 --> 01:12:49,956
Admiral General Aladeen
and his new bride, Zoey.

1250
01:12:54,266 --> 01:12:56,895
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

1251
01:13:06,711 --> 01:13:08,907
Are you okay, my love?
What did you step on?

1252
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:10,278
Yes! No, no.

1253
01:13:10,382 --> 01:13:14,080
It's my people's tradition.
We always smash a glass at weddings.

1254
01:13:14,152 --> 01:13:15,984
- I'm Jewish!
- What?

1255
01:13:16,088 --> 01:13:17,317
Mazel tov!

1256
01:13:22,327 --> 01:13:23,386
Are you okay?

1257
01:13:24,429 --> 01:13:27,092
That's fine.
I don't mind. It's great!

1258
01:13:27,499 --> 01:13:29,263
Come here, my love.

1259
01:13:48,987 --> 01:13:50,819
Jachnoon, President
Prime Minister Aladeen.

1260
01:13:50,922 --> 01:13:54,256
Jachnoon. Nadal. I have to be back
at the palace in an hour.

1261
01:13:54,326 --> 01:13:56,591
Zoey thinks I'm at yoga.

1262
01:13:57,028 --> 01:13:58,018
I have great news.

1263
01:13:58,130 --> 01:14:00,929
We are just days
away from testing the new missiles.

1264
01:14:00,999 --> 01:14:02,968
I have re-engineered
the oxidizing ducts

1265
01:14:03,034 --> 01:14:04,468
and the payload
delivery systems.

1266
01:14:04,536 --> 01:14:09,440
But you'll be happy to know,
the missile is now pointy!

1267
01:14:10,542 --> 01:14:12,511
Who cares if it's pointy?

1268
01:14:12,611 --> 01:14:13,704
What?

1269
01:14:14,279 --> 01:14:16,544
You do.
You care if it's pointy.

1270
01:14:16,648 --> 01:14:18,310
Why would I care
about such a trivial detail?

1271
01:14:18,383 --> 01:14:20,648
Are you serious?
Are you serious right now?

1272
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:21,709
Of course I'm serious.

1273
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:23,288
That's why you had me executed!

1274
01:14:23,355 --> 01:14:26,655
The shape of the missile has nothing to
do with the payload delivery.

1275
01:14:26,725 --> 01:14:29,160
That's what I said!
That's what I said the first time!

1276
01:14:29,227 --> 01:14:30,661
No, that's what I said,
and you went crazy.

1277
01:14:30,729 --> 01:14:32,061
No!

1278
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:38,634
So, we're opening
300 Women's Centers,

1279
01:14:38,703 --> 01:14:42,640
but I'm going to have to take a
break for a little bit because

1280
01:14:43,341 --> 01:14:44,673
I'm pregnant.

1281
01:14:44,743 --> 01:14:45,904
What?

1282
01:14:49,648 --> 01:14:52,140
Are you having a boy
or an abortion?

1283
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:16,730
Hello, gentlemen.
How you doin'?

1284
01:15:16,841 --> 01:15:18,366
Are you guys friends
of the deceased?

1285
01:15:18,443 --> 01:15:21,277
Do you want me to say this
in front of his widow?

1286
01:15:21,379 --> 01:15:22,369
I was his lover.

1287
01:15:22,447 --> 01:15:23,938
No. That is
not true.

1288
01:15:24,416 --> 01:15:26,385
I saw him perform
with the Globetrotters.

1289
01:15:26,451 --> 01:15:29,011
I thought
he was outstanding. I befriended him.

1290
01:15:29,087 --> 01:15:31,215
No, it's a different person.

1291
01:15:31,289 --> 01:15:34,623
His message
of don't worry and being happy

1292
01:15:34,726 --> 01:15:35,887
was so powerful.

1293
01:15:35,961 --> 01:15:38,226
No, this is
Bobby McFerrin. I told you this outside.

1294
01:15:38,296 --> 01:15:40,561
Whatever the scandal
you went through,

1295
01:15:40,632 --> 01:15:42,464
you're still
the best golfer in the world.

1296
01:15:42,567 --> 01:15:43,865
Let's go.

1297
01:15:43,935 --> 01:15:46,564
Okay. Let's rehearse this.
Role play, role play.

1298
01:15:46,638 --> 01:15:49,802
So, Secretary General,
your soldiers will weep...

1299
01:15:51,309 --> 01:15:52,743
I am so sorry!

1300
01:15:52,811 --> 01:15:54,439
Listen, it was not my fault.

1301
01:15:54,546 --> 01:15:56,913
I mean, somebody had
set the safety catch

1302
01:15:56,982 --> 01:15:59,383
to "Aladeen"
instead of "Aladeen."

1303
01:15:59,451 --> 01:16:00,646
Look, I mean, this whole gun...

1304
01:16:04,089 --> 01:16:05,148
Zoey.

1305
01:16:06,658 --> 01:16:08,923
That's some good head!

1306
01:16:11,162 --> 01:16:13,256
That is called payback
and it feels so good!

1307
01:16:13,331 --> 01:16:15,664
How did it feel for you?
How did it feel for you?

1308
01:16:15,767 --> 01:16:17,497
I prefer it with goats.

1309
01:16:18,270 --> 01:16:19,761
Where is the Supreme Leader?

1310
01:16:19,838 --> 01:16:20,897
No, no.

1311
01:16:20,972 --> 01:16:23,339
Now that is called payback!

1312
01:16:23,608 --> 01:16:24,906
Great!

1313
01:16:30,348 --> 01:16:33,341
Don't touch it.
Don't touch it.

1314
01:16:33,852 --> 01:16:35,184
You don't have to touch it.

1315
01:16:35,287 --> 01:16:36,277
Sorry. I was...

1316
01:16:36,354 --> 01:16:38,255
Just give us...
We don't...

1317
01:16:38,323 --> 01:16:41,191
Just give me
a couple of millimeters to myself.
