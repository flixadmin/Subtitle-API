
001
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,075
Stop right there!

002
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,768
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

003
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,312
Documents, important documents...

004
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,688
for the Lieutenant-Comrade!

005
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,483
He called us, last minute.

006
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,110
Pardon our sloppy appearance.

007
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,112
Lieutenant? What Lieutenant?

008
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,656
Lieutenant...

009
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,617
Molotov?

010
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,836
Can I help?

011
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,587
Picking up.

012
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,548
Do I know you?

013
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,507
New arrivals.

014
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,134
Landed last night.

015
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,014
Say goodbye to sunlight.

016
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,598
Who needs sunlight

017
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,475
when we have one another, comrade?

018
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,394
Indeed, comrade!

019
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,479
And a bottle of Stolichnaya.

020
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,807
We just found them like this.

021
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,146
The American.
