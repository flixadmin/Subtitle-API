1
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:06,832
And action.

2
00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:09,574
Trust me, true believer.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,751
Not only
did I not think

4
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:16,146
I would be doing a cameo
in such a big movie,

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,062
I never dreamt
there'd be such a big movie.

6
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:22,109
In those days,
I was writing those books.

7
00:00:22,152 --> 00:00:25,764
I was hoping they'd sell
so I wouldn't lose my job

8
00:00:25,808 --> 00:00:27,636
and I could keep
paying the rent.

9
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,116
All of a sudden,

10
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:32,858
these characters
have become world-famous.

11
00:00:32,902 --> 00:00:35,905
They're the subject
of blockbuster movies,

12
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:38,734
and I'm lucky enough
to get little cameos in them.

13
00:00:38,777 --> 00:00:40,910
E, mark.

14
00:00:40,953 --> 00:00:44,348
Okay.
And background action. Action.

15
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:47,743
They decided
any scene with Bob and me...

16
00:00:47,786 --> 00:00:49,136
- Remember me?
- Sure don't.

17
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:50,789
...had to be
a sure crowd-pleaser.

18
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,052
You look great, Hef.

19
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:55,968
Cut.

20
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:58,058
Ladies and gentlemen,
that's a camera wrap

21
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:01,844
on the creator of Iron Man,
Mr. Stan Lee.

22
00:01:04,412 --> 00:01:05,978
We are so lucky.

23
00:01:06,022 --> 00:01:08,590
Robert Downey Jr.
playing this role.

24
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:11,288
I was born under a lucky
star, I gotta tell you.

25
00:01:11,332 --> 00:01:14,509
And to be in a scene with
him, brief as it was,

26
00:01:14,552 --> 00:01:16,337
and I'll talk to them
about that later,

27
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,295
it was a joy,
really a joy.

28
00:01:18,339 --> 00:01:20,341
I just love doing cameos,

29
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,038
because first of all,

30
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,084
there's no real
responsibility.

31
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:26,477
We arrive at the place
where they're shooting.

32
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:29,741
The director says,
"Go to wardrobe, go to makeup."

33
00:01:29,785 --> 00:01:32,135
When I'm all finished,
"Okay. Here's your line."

34
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:34,050
That's Captain America?

35
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,183
I thought he'd be taller.

36
00:01:36,226 --> 00:01:37,793
I'd like to start
with the line

37
00:01:37,836 --> 00:01:39,011
that might have been
put to you, sir,

38
00:01:39,055 --> 00:01:40,448
which was,
"Did it work?"

39
00:01:40,491 --> 00:01:42,058
I'm a very good study.

40
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,365
I can remember a whole line

41
00:01:44,408 --> 00:01:46,454
after reading it
three or four times.

42
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,195
Did it work?

43
00:01:48,238 --> 00:01:49,370
And action.

44
00:01:49,413 --> 00:01:50,632
Superheroes?

45
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:52,938
In New York? Give me a break.

46
00:01:52,982 --> 00:01:54,375
I mean, I say a line or two

47
00:01:54,418 --> 00:01:56,159
if I'm lucky enough
to get a line.

48
00:01:56,203 --> 00:01:57,987
Sometimes it's just pantomime.

49
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,207
- Larry King.
- Larry!

50
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,730
And there I am on the screen

51
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:03,514
and I'm a big ham,
so I love it.

52
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:06,169
Oh, man.

53
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:09,085
I am so fired.

54
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,697
I like them all. I mean, as I think
of them, each one is my favorite.

55
00:02:12,741 --> 00:02:15,396
And shrink!

56
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,574
Well, the '60s were fun,
but now I'm paying for it.

57
00:02:19,617 --> 00:02:20,662
And cut it.

58
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:22,011
And I love being
in the theater

59
00:02:22,054 --> 00:02:23,708
and having somebody
next to me,

60
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:25,188
"Oh, look! That's Stan Lee!"

61
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:26,668
I get a big kick
out of that.

62
00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:30,193
You know what?
I think I'll just take these,

63
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:31,890
bring them over here,

64
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:34,023
and hold on for safekeeping.

65
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:36,765
Are you Tony Stank?

66
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:43,902
Oh, man. Anyway,
before I was so rudely interrupted...

67
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:46,862
At that time,
I was a Federal Express man.

68
00:02:46,905 --> 00:02:49,995
I'm trying to tie
the Marvel Universe together

69
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:53,608
by being the one common
denominator that they all have.

70
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:55,523
What's the matter
with you kids?

71
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:57,786
You've never seen
a spaceship before?

72
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,744
My cameos are always fun,

73
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:02,486
especially when I do
one with Thor.

74
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,577
I play a barber and I'm
about to cut his hair.

75
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:08,710
Touch something and then the
whole thing's gonna come to life.

76
00:03:08,753 --> 00:03:10,190
- Okay. Good.
- Yeah.

77
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:15,195
No!

78
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:16,979
Yes!

79
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,069
Good.

80
00:03:20,112 --> 00:03:24,073
Hey, you guys,
make love not war.

81
00:03:24,116 --> 00:03:27,119
Each one stands out
more than the previous one.

82
00:03:27,163 --> 00:03:29,818
This is one of the best cameos
I've done, let me tell you.

83
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:31,428
Look at the girl I'm with.
You know what I'm saying?

84
00:03:31,472 --> 00:03:33,648
- She's crazy stupid fine, right?
- You go, "Yeah."

85
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:35,824
Yeah.
Crazy stupid fine.

86
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:37,826
It's so fun when you show up in the films.
It's really neat.

87
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:39,871
Well, it's great.
I love it.

88
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:41,656
I mean, people are so nice.

89
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:44,224
- Great to see you.
- Hey, brother. How you doing?

90
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:45,486
- All right.
- Great to see you.

91
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:46,791
Have a safe trip
down to Atlanta.

92
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:53,363
The fact that I'm working with
characters that I've created...

93
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:54,408
Not too shabby.

94
00:03:59,456 --> 00:04:02,067
By the crimson
rings of Cyttorak,

95
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:03,808
it's Doctor Strange!

96
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:07,638
And the fact that they are
being directed so beautifully...

97
00:04:07,682 --> 00:04:09,771
- "I'll need a ride home."
- Why don't you try that?

98
00:04:09,814 --> 00:04:11,120
"I'll need a ride home."

99
00:04:11,163 --> 00:04:13,209
...to work
with such professionals

100
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,212
and they all have
a love of the characters.

101
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,347
Chris Evans came over to me
like I'm his father.

102
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,915
He is so happy
to be doing what he's doing.

103
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:26,701
He's so happy to be
Captain America, you know?

104
00:04:26,744 --> 00:04:29,225
See, nobody's going to recognize
you, 'cause they...

105
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,096
- They're expecting to see this little guy.
- They're expecting this big.

106
00:04:32,837 --> 00:04:34,361
Hey, glad to see you, Chris.

107
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:35,449
Yeah. How are you?

108
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:37,189
Hey, congratulations
on the twins.

109
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:38,974
- Thanks, buddy.
- Hey, that's terrific.

110
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:41,411
- Yes. It's fun.
- So you say something first.

111
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:44,545
I say, uh, "It's aged for
a thousand years in barrels

112
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:46,460
"built from the wreck
of Grunhel's Fleet.

113
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:47,852
"It's not meant
for mortal men."

114
00:04:49,463 --> 00:04:51,247
And then that's you.

115
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:53,902
What the hell
did you just say?

116
00:04:56,252 --> 00:04:58,385
This is not meant
for mortal men.

117
00:04:58,428 --> 00:05:00,387
Neither was
Omaha Beach, Blondie.

118
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,476
Stop trying to scare us.
Come on.

119
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,304
I don't think of them
as cameos.

120
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:05,870
All right.

121
00:05:05,914 --> 00:05:09,047
I rather think of it as a
supporting role that I play.

122
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:12,007
Excelsior.

123
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,574
- And cut.
- Cut there.

124
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:14,749
And cut it.

125
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:20,058
Stan Lee. The whole
reason any of this exists.

126
00:05:20,102 --> 00:05:22,191
My hero.
The greatest man alive.

127
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:23,323
Thank you for everything.

128
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:27,109
We should all be grateful.
I know we're all honored.

129
00:05:27,152 --> 00:05:29,285
And Stan,
thank you so much for being here.

130
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,548
It is our absolute pleasure

131
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:33,245
and forgive us if there's lots of
handshakes and autographs now...

132
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:36,074
I sometimes wonder,
"Did this really all happen?"

133
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:37,728
- It's an honor to have you.
- Thank you.

134
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:39,164
Thanks a lot.

135
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:46,389
In the days
I was writing these things,

136
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:48,870
I never thought it would turn
into something like this.

137
00:05:53,135 --> 00:05:55,529
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

138
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:57,487
This is just unbelievable.

139
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,447
It's indescribable.

140
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,797
To work with creative people,

141
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:08,411
especially people who make
movies, is such a thrill.

142
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:12,502
It's overwhelming
when I think about it.

143
00:06:12,546 --> 00:06:16,637
And I keep saying to myself,
"I can't believe this is me.

144
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,466
"I can't believe
I lucked out this way."

145
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:21,511
Let's give it up
for Stan Lee, guys.

146
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:22,599
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

147
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:28,692
Five lousy words
they gave me to say.

148
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:31,216
Thank you, too.
You're a great director.

149
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,827
It's something
you never forget.

150
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:37,875
And thank you for all of this

151
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,879
and I hope that I didn't set
interviewing back a few decades.

152
00:06:41,923 --> 00:06:44,316
Okay.
I'll see you later.

153
00:06:44,882 --> 00:06:46,449
Thank you.

154
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:48,277
I appreciate that.

155
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,193
I remember every cameo I've
done since the first one.

156
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,327
And I think
I'm a very lucky guy.

157
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:30,319
The journey of the entire
Marvel Cinematic Universe

158
00:07:30,362 --> 00:07:32,408
started with the journey
of Tony Stark.

159
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:39,807
- Much better than the big old...
- Oh, yeah.

160
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,766
- ...clunky, clunky monkey.
- And that sound is great.

161
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,551
I think it looks
a little large, too,

162
00:07:44,594 --> 00:07:46,727
but I think we might be able
to get away with it all.

163
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,033
Going back to Favreau
and Robert Downey Jr.

164
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:52,123
And the founding moments
of Marvel Studios,

165
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:54,517
we said, "We want the hero to
be as interesting out of costume

166
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:57,041
"as they are in costume."

167
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:59,783
I had just been hired
to cast the first Iron Man.

168
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:01,393
Jon Favreau was on board
at that time

169
00:08:01,437 --> 00:08:02,699
and I remember asking him

170
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:03,874
in a meeting with everyone,

171
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:05,528
"Tell me all the qualities

172
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:07,182
"that you think
are most important."

173
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:09,793
Fast, quick-witted
and funny and dynamic

174
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:11,578
and a bit troubled
and confident

175
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:13,667
and brilliant
and all of these things.

176
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,712
And we really kept
coming back to Downey.

177
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:20,717
Stan Lee said he
kind of created him on a dare.

178
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:24,068
Could you make a billionaire
weapons manufacturer,

179
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:26,331
philandering philanthropist,
you know,

180
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:30,379
who largely lives an ugly and
irresponsible immoral psychology?

181
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:31,728
To peace!

182
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:34,339
If you look at Downey
in his early work, you know,

183
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:36,124
it's amazing. I mean,
look at Chaplin.

184
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:37,647
You look at Less Than Zero.

185
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:39,867
I mean, they're tough
characters to watch.

186
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,043
Robert Downey Jr.
at that point in his career

187
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:45,437
wasn't necessarily
a family-friendly name.

188
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:48,571
Today it's ridiculous,
but at the time,

189
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:51,052
it was, "Whoa! Risky casting
Robert Downey Jr."

190
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:53,141
The truth was
we got to a point

191
00:08:53,184 --> 00:08:55,056
that we realized
if we didn't cast him,

192
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:57,145
that would have been
the biggest risk.

193
00:08:57,188 --> 00:08:59,539
Robert had a whole career
of great work behind him,

194
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:01,889
and he was at a point
in his life and his career

195
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:03,455
where he was ready
to break out

196
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:05,893
and do something really big
and exciting.

197
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:08,548
Jon was in love with the
idea of Downey playing the part,

198
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:12,813
and we all felt so sure about
him on a creative level.

199
00:09:12,856 --> 00:09:16,512
Because he wasn't instantly
a slam dunk approval,

200
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,948
I suggested
we have screen tests.

201
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,520
I remember walking in with Robert
Downey Jr. the day of the tests.

202
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:28,785
He was laughing and in great
spirits and completely at ease,

203
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:31,614
and he got in front of the camera
and started saying the lines.

204
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:34,182
I assure you the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,

205
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:36,750
I'll happily transition to
manufacturing bricks and beams

206
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:39,361
for baby hospitals,
making hemp pants and the like,

207
00:09:39,404 --> 00:09:41,276
but until that time,
can I get you a drink?

208
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:43,365
I don't want to call it
an out-of-body experience,

209
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:45,193
but it was one of those rushes

210
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:47,499
that I'm sure, like, somebody
would feel if they're about to play

211
00:09:47,543 --> 00:09:49,153
a big sporting arena,

212
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:50,981
playing for the ring
or something like that.

213
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:53,854
It was just like, "Am I gonna
pass out or am I gonna nail this?"

214
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:56,465
On that day
that Robert screen tested,

215
00:09:56,508 --> 00:10:00,034
it was clear that there was no
one else who can play that part.

216
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:04,560
It was magic. It was exactly the
feeling as a casting director,

217
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,781
with Kevin, with Jon,
with everyone

218
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:09,696
that we all wanted
to have that feeling, like,

219
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:13,787
"We have it. This is it.
This is Iron Man."

220
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,616
Iron Man 1 was incredibly special.

221
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:18,182
We sort of improved
the whole thing.

222
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:20,881
We laughed. We cried.

223
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:24,406
We got very,
very close on that movie.

224
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:27,104
We were the first
Marvel movie as a studio.

225
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:30,325
You know, there was
no real model for it yet.

226
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:32,327
Nobody expected
too much of it.

227
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,720
He's Iron Man.

228
00:10:33,763 --> 00:10:36,548
We wanted to make
a good quality film,

229
00:10:36,592 --> 00:10:40,117
a good story, something that
was smart enough, funny enough.

230
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:43,686
I still remember Tony
landing in the high desert

231
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,558
in the eastern Sierras
when he escapes the cave,

232
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:49,692
and I was buried up to my neck in
sand and the storm was coming in

233
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:51,999
and we only had a couple
minutes to get this take.

234
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:53,783
And it was like God's grace
just came in

235
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:55,698
and gave us the take
that was in the movie.

236
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:58,092
Not bad.

237
00:10:58,135 --> 00:11:00,529
I loved the first movie
so much.

238
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:03,358
I was just so carried away
by the story.

239
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:05,621
It was funny. It was clever.
It was witty.

240
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,971
Let's face it, this is not the
worst thing you've caught me doing.

241
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:10,104
By casting Robert Downey Jr.,

242
00:11:10,147 --> 00:11:12,497
they were intent on breaking

243
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:16,197
the tradition and mold
of these types of movies.

244
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,808
It was an
unexpected choice at the time.

245
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:21,245
And so it made
for this really dynamic,

246
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:23,204
really surprising performance.

247
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,511
Was that so hard?

248
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:29,471
He's so bright and so fast
and it takes you so long

249
00:11:29,514 --> 00:11:33,083
to catch up with him and it's
perfect for that character.

250
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:34,128
Good luck keeping up.

251
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:39,568
I think most of us have been
pretty vocal about what he started,

252
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:44,268
and without him, none of us
would be in this position.

253
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:46,314
He really is the patriarch.

254
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:47,968
I think he really understood

255
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:51,014
the weight of the responsibility
with these movies.

256
00:11:51,058 --> 00:11:53,495
Iron Man 1 changed the genre.

257
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:56,890
And I think the casting of Robert
Downey signaled to the world

258
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:59,544
that we are serious
about our characters

259
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:01,329
and we really respect
them in a way

260
00:12:01,372 --> 00:12:03,287
that we're gonna hire
the best actors possible.

261
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:07,552
It really was
just this perfect storm.

262
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:12,253
I had hypnotized myself into
such a state of confidence

263
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:14,429
that I was certain...

264
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:17,911
everything
we were doing worked,

265
00:12:19,826 --> 00:12:21,088
and, uh,
the rest is history.

266
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,526
I am Iron Man.

267
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:48,680
I'm not sure
we could have done

268
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:51,988
this notion of an interlinked
Marvel Cinematic Universe

269
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:54,208
without Captain America.

270
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:57,733
Whether it's bit by a spider
or exposed to gamma rays,

271
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,955
the notion of a super-powered
human started with Steve Rogers.

272
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:05,872
He is the backbone
of the universe.

273
00:13:11,703 --> 00:13:14,097
As we were developing Captain
America: The First Avenger,

274
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:16,491
we brought in
these two writers

275
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:18,754
named Chris Markus
and Steve McFeely.

276
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:22,932
They were the sole writers on
the first Captain America film.

277
00:13:22,976 --> 00:13:25,152
They went on
to become the sole writers

278
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:27,328
on Captain America:
The Winter Soldier,

279
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:29,634
sole writers on Civil War,

280
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:32,333
and now Infinity War
and Avengers: Endgame.

281
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:36,598
They deserve as much credit for
Captain America as anybody else.

282
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:39,775
When we were talking to them,
they had two movies out.

283
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,213
And so the idea that,
"No, this is going to build

284
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:45,650
"into a giant, ongoing
interconnected universe"

285
00:13:45,694 --> 00:13:47,870
was like, "Uh-huh.
Yeah, sure, of course it will.

286
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:49,329
I have no doubt."

287
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:53,223
Chris and I sort of coincidentally
had been sort of blue-skying about,

288
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:56,444
"You know what someone should do.
A period superhero movie."

289
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:59,012
Right? When they were invented,
when they were created,

290
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:02,145
what would it be like to
use them in the proper time?

291
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:04,756
And then when we heard that Marvel
was going to do that, we were,

292
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,497
"Oh, my. We need to go
chase that down."

293
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,238
As for the writing,

294
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:10,980
we never worried
about the larger universe.

295
00:14:12,373 --> 00:14:13,853
The mission is

296
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,332
always make the best
movie in front of you,

297
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:17,073
because this whole thing

298
00:14:17,117 --> 00:14:19,859
is dependent on making
good movies one at a time.

299
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:22,905
We had the same goal in
the first Captain America.

300
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:25,908
We subtitled the Captain
America film "The First Avenger"

301
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:27,388
for a reason,

302
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:29,172
because putting a star
in red, white and blue

303
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:30,826
on that scrawny kid

304
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,523
who yearns to be
a part of the battle,

305
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:33,916
that is where it all started.

306
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,439
We knew that
the movie wouldn't work

307
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:37,702
if you didn't buy
Steve Rogers at the top.

308
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:39,226
I don't like bullies.

309
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:41,489
I don't care
where they're from.

310
00:14:41,532 --> 00:14:45,101
Well, there are already so
many big men fighting this war.

311
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:48,452
Maybe what we need now
is the little guy, huh?

312
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:51,586
The spectacle and
the action sequences only work

313
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:53,109
if you're engaged
in the characters.

314
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:54,763
You know,
all the visual effects

315
00:14:54,806 --> 00:14:56,199
and it doesn't matter
how big your budget is,

316
00:14:56,243 --> 00:14:59,376
if you're not engaged in
Steve Rogers/Captain America,

317
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,857
I think you're
wasting your time, really.

318
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,512
We needed to fall in
love with skinny Steve Rogers

319
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:05,905
before he ever became
Captain America.

320
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,428
- And never forget that he's in there.
- Yeah.

321
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:09,996
The serum amplifies
everything that is inside,

322
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:12,346
so good becomes great,

323
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:14,696
bad becomes worse.

324
00:15:16,263 --> 00:15:18,961
This is why
you were chosen.

325
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:22,660
Because a strong man who
has known power all his life

326
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:24,749
may lose respect
for that power.

327
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:26,142
But a weak man

328
00:15:26,186 --> 00:15:28,057
knows the value of strength.

329
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,584
Steve Rogers,
more than any of the other superheroes,

330
00:15:33,628 --> 00:15:36,283
really kind of loses
who he was

331
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:38,981
in the process of becoming Captain America.

332
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:40,940
The old him ceases to exist.

333
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:43,768
There's no life of Steve
Rogers that he goes back to.

334
00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:45,466
In The Avengers,
he's the leader

335
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:47,903
because he's completely
dedicated to everything,

336
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,558
partially because he doesn't
have anything else to turn to.

337
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:53,953
His desire to keep it
ordered and to keep some meaning,

338
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,564
all that stuff
is still an issue for him.

339
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:59,784
He's always been
this very austere kind of guy,

340
00:15:59,828 --> 00:16:03,397
but had this real loyalty
to institutions and to people.

341
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,181
We have orders.
We should follow them.

342
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:07,096
Following's not
really my style.

343
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,707
I think they slowly
strip that away from him.

344
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:12,275
You know, he loses his faith in
government in Winter Soldier.

345
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:15,409
He loses his faith in his friends
and his family in Civil War.

346
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:18,020
You know, I think when we
see him in Infinity War,

347
00:16:18,064 --> 00:16:19,848
he's just turned his back
on a lot of things.

348
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:21,545
Earth just lost
her best defender,

349
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,591
so we're here to fight.

350
00:16:25,158 --> 00:16:26,898
And if you want
to stand in our way,

351
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:30,250
we'll fight you, too.

352
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:32,208
With this movie,
they let him kind of return back to that

353
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:34,950
hopeful soldier, leader.

354
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,647
This is the fight
of our lives...

355
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:38,954
and we're gonna win.

356
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,827
Whatever it takes.

357
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:45,787
When we first
met the folks at Marvel,

358
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,050
we chased
the Captain America job

359
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:50,009
and certainly had no idea

360
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:52,315
that it would lead to the
next 10 years of our career.

361
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:54,578
And we've had Cap
most of the way.

362
00:16:54,622 --> 00:16:57,799
It's been a lot of fun having
someone with that gravity.

363
00:16:57,842 --> 00:16:59,496
It's a rare character.

364
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,976
You don't get to write
that character much anymore.

365
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,499
He's an aspirational figure.

366
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:05,807
It's a combination of where
we put him in the universe

367
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,722
and Cap rising
to the challenge.

368
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:09,593
You just don't know
when to give up, do you?

369
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:11,552
I can do this all day.

370
00:17:13,336 --> 00:17:16,122
When our characters
are beginning to come to life,

371
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:18,298
it all starts with artwork.

372
00:17:18,341 --> 00:17:19,951
Our visual development group,

373
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:22,780
led by Ryan Meinerding for
the better part of a decade,

374
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:24,782
has been
that very important step

375
00:17:24,826 --> 00:17:26,915
between the comics
and the final product

376
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:30,353
that has brought
Captain America to life.

377
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:31,963
One of the great things
about the comics

378
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:33,487
is that Captain America
was always designed

379
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,576
to read really quickly.

380
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:38,013
And also, because they had
limited colors in the printing,

381
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,146
there's a simplification that
happened with a lot of them,

382
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:42,322
that they were just, you know,
this guy's red, white and blue.

383
00:17:42,365 --> 00:17:44,976
There's a really fast,
iconic thing that happens

384
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,109
with the characters
as the source material.

385
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:49,764
Trying to bring that into a real
setting, like for a film,

386
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:52,636
whatever they simplified
for the design for the comics,

387
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,551
we're trying to fill out in a
way that makes it feel real.

388
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:56,858
If they only had line work
and four colors

389
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:59,208
and they're able to make something
that resonates with people

390
00:17:59,252 --> 00:18:02,951
for 60, 70 years, how can we find
a way of putting it into our work?

391
00:18:02,994 --> 00:18:04,257
In the case
with Captain America,

392
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,347
we're trying to find
reference materials

393
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,827
that bring him into sort
of the world of a soldier.

394
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:11,133
The first time
he puts on the costume

395
00:18:11,177 --> 00:18:13,353
in Captain America:
First Avenger,

396
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:15,442
it's about him being that sort of
patriotic icon that's on the...

397
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:16,834
In the USO show.

398
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:18,662
So that was
where we were trying

399
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:20,490
to sort of take
those really classic

400
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:23,145
and iconic lines that were
designed back in the '40s

401
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:25,147
and turn it into something

402
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:27,410
that was always kind of meant
to be a little bit goofy,

403
00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:30,152
sort of put him on stage and say,
"You're a symbol for America.

404
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:31,849
"Show us how much
of a symbol you are."

405
00:18:33,895 --> 00:18:36,941
"Not all of us can storm
a beach or drive a tank,

406
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:39,074
"but there's still a way
all of us can fight."

407
00:18:44,732 --> 00:18:48,518
One of the amazing things about
being able to work on a character

408
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:50,564
through multiple movies
is that you actually get

409
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:52,870
to tell the story of the
character through the costume.

410
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:55,525
Seeing Cap's change from Captain
America: The First Avenger

411
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:58,354
through Avengers and into Winter
Soldier, for example,

412
00:18:58,398 --> 00:19:00,574
is a pretty big
visual change.

413
00:19:00,617 --> 00:19:02,880
Being a person in the 1940s

414
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:05,274
and coming forward into 2012

415
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:07,058
and sort of living
in that period of time

416
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:08,886
and being a fish-out-of-water

417
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,280
and then sort of acclimating
very quickly and becoming

418
00:19:11,324 --> 00:19:14,501
this very stealth-orientated,
extreme tactical ops person

419
00:19:14,544 --> 00:19:15,937
is a crazy change.

420
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,157
And it worked
so well because...

421
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,812
Partially because the costume actually
reflects what he's going through.

422
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:24,119
What made Cap unique
in the Marvel Universe

423
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,643
and sort of in the nature
of his powers, he's sort of

424
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:28,428
basically a man,
only more so.

425
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:30,691
His fighting technique's
a very visceral,

426
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:32,997
surprising experience
of action.

427
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,437
From a visual standpoint,

428
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,829
you take the script
and you identify, like,

429
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:40,614
10 great moments
in the movie

430
00:19:40,657 --> 00:19:43,182
and then you take
a brilliant artist, like Ryan,

431
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:45,967
and you say, "Here's what we're
looking for from this moment."

432
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,969
And then Ryan draws up

433
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:50,145
and colors and inks
a beautiful,

434
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,540
you know, frame
from the movie.

435
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:57,370
Before we get started,
does anyone want to get out?

436
00:19:59,285 --> 00:20:01,112
They do
incorporate lighting.

437
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:04,986
They incorporate a strong visual
element, where will the camera be,

438
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:09,338
in a very, you know, sort of
dynamic and specific moment.

439
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:11,819
And that does
inspire the movie.

440
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,476
For Captain America,

441
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:19,827
almost every iconic sequence came
right out of Ryan's original drawings,

442
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:23,134
where he was just by himself with
his drawing pad at his computer.

443
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:25,267
I've been at Marvel
for about 12 years,

444
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:27,008
which is almost
the entire time

445
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:29,315
that Marvel Studios
has existed.

446
00:20:29,358 --> 00:20:31,273
There's a sort of a craziness to the notion

447
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:33,319
that I've been able
to stay with the character

448
00:20:33,362 --> 00:20:36,104
over the course of nine years.

449
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:38,759
Being that sort of medium
between the comics

450
00:20:38,802 --> 00:20:40,021
and what is actually
on the screen

451
00:20:40,064 --> 00:20:41,892
has been a joy that
I couldn't have imagined.

452
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,679
When we really distilled

453
00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:47,071
the core qualities
that we wanted

454
00:20:47,115 --> 00:20:48,421
out of Captain America,

455
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:51,119
I think there's
a moral fiber to him

456
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:53,904
that really isn't
something that you act,

457
00:20:53,948 --> 00:20:56,167
that it's something
you need to possess.

458
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,127
And Chris Evans was someone

459
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:03,000
who seemed to inhabit all
of those qualities the most.

460
00:21:03,044 --> 00:21:05,264
So everyone was in love
with the idea of Chris,

461
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:07,701
except Chris.

462
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:09,224
The only reason there
was hesitation to begin with

463
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,965
was because of the commitment.

464
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:12,227
It's a big movie
and, you know,

465
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,361
those are the movies
that if they succeed,

466
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:17,319
there's a change,
a lifestyle change.

467
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:21,062
And if it fails,
it's a whole other can of worms.

468
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:24,327
Even Chris's reluctance
to be a star...

469
00:21:25,371 --> 00:21:28,156
spoke to how right
he was for the role

470
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:31,899
because Captain America was
not looking for the limelight.

471
00:21:31,942 --> 00:21:33,683
He was humble. He was modest.

472
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:36,295
He needed to feel that
in his bones.

473
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:38,209
I love the character.

474
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:40,864
He's everything that I wish
I could be as a man, you know.

475
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:43,650
And the creative forces
behind the film are fantastic,

476
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:45,739
between Joe and Kevin Feige.

477
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:47,784
I mean, you know,
Marvel in general,

478
00:21:47,828 --> 00:21:50,613
they know what they're doing,
so in the end, I was so excited.

479
00:21:50,657 --> 00:21:54,008
Once he committed,
he committed 1,000%.

480
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:57,577
You know, he stands there,
tells the truth and then kicks ass.

481
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,363
I think there's a confidence

482
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:03,104
that he really brings
to the character

483
00:22:03,147 --> 00:22:06,368
and an integrity
that people really respond to.

484
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:10,459
There's something so endearing,
so charismatic, so charming.

485
00:22:10,503 --> 00:22:13,114
He has so much heart.
There was something very heroic.

486
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:15,203
There is something that
he brings to the character

487
00:22:15,246 --> 00:22:17,118
beyond what we could
write on the page,

488
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:20,121
beyond what we could illustrate
in, you know, special effects

489
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:22,210
that is uniquely Chris.

490
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:27,346
It's no secret,
I love Chris Evans.

491
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:31,001
And I love Captain America.

492
00:22:31,045 --> 00:22:36,833
Captain America was the single hardest
character to launch in this universe.

493
00:22:36,877 --> 00:22:38,879
This kind of guy out of time,

494
00:22:38,922 --> 00:22:42,752
and is it too retro?
Are people going to get it?

495
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:44,841
I cannot imagine
anybody but Chris

496
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:46,626
playing this role.

497
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:49,411
It's really... It's a very difficult
role to play because on one hand,

498
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:52,849
you have this character that has
this very strong moral compass

499
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:55,678
and you try to think,
"Where's the conflict in that?"

500
00:22:55,722 --> 00:22:57,114
He allows himself
to be vulnerable,

501
00:22:57,158 --> 00:22:59,856
but he allows himself
to not take it so seriously.

502
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,120
- Don't worry about it. It's just a...
- What's that do?

503
00:23:03,164 --> 00:23:04,905
He makes you love
that character,

504
00:23:04,948 --> 00:23:07,386
and it makes people
want to follow him.

505
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:10,650
It's been really great
watching him sort of pull this off.

506
00:23:10,693 --> 00:23:13,087
What he does in these movies
may look effortless,

507
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,045
but it's effortless
because, you know,

508
00:23:15,089 --> 00:23:18,658
it's a testament to what
he's done with the character.

509
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:20,529
It's tough to try
and present challenges

510
00:23:20,573 --> 00:23:22,270
to someone who is so selfless.

511
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:25,142
The biggest worry is not only
trying to make the guy entertaining,

512
00:23:25,186 --> 00:23:27,057
but also keep him
interesting enough

513
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:29,277
to have audiences
want him coming back.

514
00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:34,630
Every time I see Evans,

515
00:23:34,674 --> 00:23:37,024
he's like more
and more like Cap.

516
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:39,505
It's like we've invested him
with that.

517
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:41,202
And Chris is up for that

518
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:43,639
because that's what makes it
exciting and different.

519
00:23:43,683 --> 00:23:47,469
There's this huge amount
of love for the character.

520
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:50,603
There's 20 Captain America
shirts wherever I go.

521
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:53,736
It's ceased to become
just about him

522
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,651
and how well he inhabited
the role and all that stuff.

523
00:23:55,695 --> 00:23:58,524
It's become part of our
culture just as a symbol.

524
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:02,658
It's that thing that gives you kind
of, you know, teenage goosebumps.

525
00:24:02,702 --> 00:24:06,227
I think we have a lot emotionally
invested in Cap as a character.

526
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,664
We have a lot emotionally
invested in Chris

527
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,319
as a friend
and a collaborator.

528
00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:13,452
It's a proud moment
to be able to sit back

529
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:15,584
and look at
with perspective,

530
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:18,065
the journey that
that character's gone on.

531
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:19,632
You're looking at
yourself in this old makeup

532
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:22,199
and you're trying
to tap into Steve's journey,

533
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:23,940
but you can't help
but think about your own

534
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:26,290
and think about what this entire
experience has meant to you.

535
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:28,510
It's just been littered
with so many good memories.

536
00:24:28,554 --> 00:24:31,078
They never want to work, these
kids, but I'll get them there.

537
00:24:31,121 --> 00:24:33,036
It is
because of this journey,

538
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,866
of just such
an embarrassment of riches

539
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,956
and such good fortune
and just good luck.

540
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,350
And again,
it's just so unblemished

541
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:45,092
because there's so many
wonderful people around me.

542
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:47,529
This has been such an
incredible chapter in my life.

543
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:10,944
We'd love to take this character

544
00:25:10,987 --> 00:25:12,815
in every different direction.

545
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:16,645
I think she certainly encounters her
fair share of the Marvel Universe.

546
00:25:19,082 --> 00:25:23,957
It's nice to be able to play
a superheroine who has a past.

547
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,613
You know, she obviously has been
around for over, what, 40 years.

548
00:25:29,136 --> 00:25:31,704
And I think
has a real foundation

549
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:34,576
for all different kinds
of spinoffs

550
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,796
or interactions
with other characters.

551
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:39,494
I think the possibilities
are really endless.

552
00:25:45,456 --> 00:25:47,589
In Iron Man 2,
the part that appealed to me most

553
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:50,636
about her was her dedication
and just her intelligence.

554
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:52,942
I think you need smart people
in a movie like that.

555
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:54,378
There's too much
up for grabs.

556
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:56,729
There's too many things
that change.

557
00:25:56,772 --> 00:25:58,339
And you need somebody who's going
to be a steward of their character.

558
00:25:58,382 --> 00:25:59,993
"Cordon off all access
to the track

559
00:26:00,036 --> 00:26:02,169
- "and clear the airspace for whoever needs."
- We got it?

560
00:26:02,212 --> 00:26:03,257
- Here we go.
- Ding!

561
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,302
Scarlett was just a dream.

562
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:09,959
You know, she's so game.
And she had a really good time doing it.

563
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:12,701
I'm my own,
my own secret weapon.

564
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:15,835
Unlike some of us, uh,
older, uh, curmudgeons,

565
00:26:15,878 --> 00:26:18,794
there's very little you can do
to get under her skin.

566
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:20,883
She's just
consummately professional.

567
00:26:20,927 --> 00:26:22,929
I love
playing this character.

568
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:25,888
When we first met Natasha
in Iron Man 2

569
00:26:25,932 --> 00:26:29,413
she was Natalie and, you know, you got
to see her, kind of, undercover work

570
00:26:29,457 --> 00:26:31,677
and, you know,
it wasn't until the end of that film

571
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,418
her true identity was revealed
as an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

572
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:37,160
You are mind-blowingly duplicitous.
How do you do it?

573
00:26:37,204 --> 00:26:39,162
You just tear things.
You're a triple imposter.

574
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:40,250
I've never seen
anything like you.

575
00:26:40,294 --> 00:26:41,643
Is there anything
real about you?

576
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:44,559
- Do you even speak Latin?
- Fallaces sunt rerum species.

577
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,214
Which means? Wait, what?
What'd you just say?

578
00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:48,781
It means you can either
drive yourself home

579
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:49,869
or I can
have you collected.

580
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:56,005
In Avengers, we see,
of course, her in her own environment.

581
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:57,833
Just like Budapest
all over again!

582
00:26:57,877 --> 00:27:00,793
You and I remember Budapest
very differently.

583
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:04,231
We get to see a
little bit more of who she is,

584
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:07,669
a little bit of her history,
of her, kind of, shady past.

585
00:27:07,713 --> 00:27:11,020
I got red in my ledger,
I'd like to wipe it out.

586
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:14,197
Can you wipe out
that much red?

587
00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:19,289
Dreykov's daughter? Sao Paulo?
The hospital fire?

588
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:22,989
Your ledger is dripping.
It's gushing red.

589
00:27:23,032 --> 00:27:26,601
You pretend to be separate,
to have your own code,

590
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,082
something that makes up
for the horrors,

591
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:33,695
but they are part of you.
And they will never go away.

592
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,264
With the second Cap,

593
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:39,222
the character starts to
question her own identity,

594
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:42,008
question her own choices.

595
00:27:42,051 --> 00:27:44,140
I thought I knew
whose lies I was telling,

596
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:47,927
but I guess I can't
tell the difference anymore.

597
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,624
She's an isolated
character.

598
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,452
Cap doesn't know whether
he can trust her or not,

599
00:27:51,495 --> 00:27:53,976
so she is not part
of the family, per se,

600
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,806
because she's never been taught to
rely on anyone other than herself.

601
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,895
And she has a view of the world

602
00:27:59,939 --> 00:28:02,681
that is skeptical, and cynical,

603
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:05,727
and her and Cap grow over
the course of that movie

604
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:08,208
and he teaches her trust.

605
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:09,557
You know, it's kind of hard
to trust someone

606
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,385
when you don't know
who that someone really is.

607
00:28:11,428 --> 00:28:12,603
Who do you want me to be?

608
00:28:13,517 --> 00:28:14,649
How 'bout a friend?

609
00:28:17,913 --> 00:28:19,219
Well, there's a chance
you might be

610
00:28:19,262 --> 00:28:21,438
in the wrong business,
Rogers.

611
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,095
In Avengers 2,

612
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:30,447
she really, you know,
allowed herself to want things

613
00:28:30,491 --> 00:28:34,669
and to envision a life for
herself outside of the things

614
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,063
that have kind of
fallen upon her.

615
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:38,455
I have no place
in the world.

616
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:40,022
Exactly.

617
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:41,676
And you realize
how strong she was

618
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,460
to have come out
the other side

619
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:46,115
and to be a part
of this very heroic team.

620
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,205
Her past is something
that's always been shrouded in mystery

621
00:28:49,249 --> 00:28:51,991
and, you know, we continue
to open up the story,

622
00:28:52,034 --> 00:28:53,688
give little, kind of, tidbits

623
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,690
and throw the bone out
once in a while

624
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,693
as to where she came from
and what her background is.

625
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,826
I had this dream,

626
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:02,871
the kind that seems normal
at the time,

627
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:05,265
but when you wake...

628
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:06,527
What did you dream?

629
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:09,486
That I was an Avenger.

630
00:29:11,184 --> 00:29:15,057
That I was anything more than
the assassin they made me.

631
00:29:19,192 --> 00:29:22,108
In Civil War,
she starts to realize

632
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:24,632
that the Avengers
are her family.

633
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:28,767
And she makes a choice to
try to preserve the family.

634
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,900
We've made
some very public mistakes.

635
00:29:31,944 --> 00:29:33,859
We need to win
their trust back.

636
00:29:33,902 --> 00:29:35,556
That's what makes
this character really heroic

637
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,340
is that she's, kind of,
dug her heels in and said,

638
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:40,169
"Look, you know, I could
kind of go down this road,

639
00:29:40,213 --> 00:29:43,607
"which would be the more
desirable road personally,

640
00:29:43,651 --> 00:29:46,523
"and disappear and live off the map."

641
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:48,308
But she chooses this,
kind of, greater calling.

642
00:29:48,351 --> 00:29:51,137
Just because it's
the path of least resistance

643
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,617
doesn't mean
it's the wrong path.

644
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:55,924
Staying together is more important
than how we stay together.

645
00:29:59,014 --> 00:30:00,450
Part of the reason

646
00:30:00,494 --> 00:30:04,063
why the Avengers failed
in Infinity War

647
00:30:04,106 --> 00:30:08,458
is because they were divided,
because of the fallout of Civil War.

648
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:14,290
Natasha's a very
strategic fighter

649
00:30:14,334 --> 00:30:20,122
and she I think is really just
trying to give whatever she can

650
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:23,604
in order to save as
many people as possible.

651
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:27,782
He did exactly what
he said he was gonna do.

652
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:32,395
Thanos wiped out 50%
of all living creatures.

653
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:35,877
At the beginning of Endgame,
she wants to bring it all back

654
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:40,708
because she feels like it is the
strongest emotional connection

655
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:42,666
that she's ever had in her life.

656
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:46,235
She's struggling to deal
with the fact that they lost.

657
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:48,672
And she hasn't stopped.

658
00:30:48,716 --> 00:30:50,892
Five years later,
she's still fighting

659
00:30:50,936 --> 00:30:54,635
to figure out how to fix this
problem and she hasn't let go.

660
00:30:54,678 --> 00:31:00,162
She has to do everything in her
power to undo what Thanos did.

661
00:31:00,206 --> 00:31:02,469
She's presented with a choice:

662
00:31:02,512 --> 00:31:05,341
she has to give her own life
to bring everyone else back

663
00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:07,430
and she does it,

664
00:31:07,474 --> 00:31:12,261
which is the most,
single most heroic moment

665
00:31:12,305 --> 00:31:13,872
in the history
of the Marvel Universe.

666
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,181
It's okay.

667
00:31:28,364 --> 00:31:31,759
I actually think
that in some weird,

668
00:31:31,802 --> 00:31:32,978
and it is
a very emotional thing,

669
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:36,633
but some weird
twisted-up fateful way,

670
00:31:36,677 --> 00:31:39,114
this character who, you know,

671
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:41,725
has searched her
whole life for a purpose,

672
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:44,467
actually finds her purpose.

673
00:31:44,511 --> 00:31:49,472
And it's like this amazing,
super-emotional, beautiful thing.

674
00:31:49,516 --> 00:31:50,865
You know what I've become.

675
00:31:53,302 --> 00:31:54,390
Oh, I don't judge people

676
00:31:54,434 --> 00:31:55,870
on their worst mistakes.

677
00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:01,180
Maybe you should.

678
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:03,530
You didn't.

679
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:06,141
I feel very fortunate.

680
00:32:06,185 --> 00:32:08,361
It's been an incredible gift as an actor

681
00:32:08,404 --> 00:32:12,713
to be able to come back to a character
that's as complex as Natasha.

682
00:32:12,756 --> 00:32:15,150
I think there's, kind of,
a lot to explore there

683
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:16,543
and that is so exciting.

684
00:32:37,477 --> 00:32:39,305
Cars are coming
down the middle

685
00:32:39,348 --> 00:32:40,915
as our heroes are running
this way and this way.

686
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:45,224
Love the Russos.

687
00:32:45,267 --> 00:32:47,052
I remember them the first
couple days on Winter Soldier.

688
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:49,315
They really felt like the
new kids on the playground.

689
00:32:49,358 --> 00:32:51,839
But everything they said they
were gonna do, they delivered on.

690
00:32:51,882 --> 00:32:55,408
Their attitude kind of breeds
this sort of lightness on set.

691
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,411
Let's do one more.

692
00:32:58,454 --> 00:33:00,065
They're the filmmakers

693
00:33:00,108 --> 00:33:01,414
that took
the Captain America series

694
00:33:01,457 --> 00:33:03,285
and elevated it
with the Winter Soldier.

695
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:05,548
"Gotta know, Cap.
This isn't personal."

696
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:06,593
And then you...

697
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:12,033
But then did it again
with Civil War.

698
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:14,166
That film is gigantic.

699
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:15,645
This is gonna be
a great shot.

700
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:22,043
We were midway through
production on Civil War,

701
00:33:22,087 --> 00:33:24,698
and we saw the amazing job that
Anthony and Joe were doing,

702
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:26,134
handling all these
different characters,

703
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:28,180
telling this
very unique storyline.

704
00:33:28,223 --> 00:33:30,747
It's going kind of this way right now
and then the window's gonna shatter.

705
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:32,619
Yeah. And then...

706
00:33:32,662 --> 00:33:34,751
We knew where we wanted to head
with the next Avengers film,

707
00:33:34,795 --> 00:33:36,623
and it was then that we
started talking to them

708
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:39,582
about coming from Civil War
onto Infinity War.

709
00:33:41,193 --> 00:33:44,152
We had no time to settle between
Civil War and Infinity War.

710
00:33:44,196 --> 00:33:47,590
As we were conceiving
and executing Civil War,

711
00:33:47,634 --> 00:33:50,071
the end of that movie
was very much a setup

712
00:33:50,115 --> 00:33:51,377
for what these movies
would be.

713
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,769
We always had
the sense of that.

714
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:54,423
Even not having a break,

715
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:56,077
I think we were able
to move forward

716
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:58,732
because there is such a
continuity in the narrative.

717
00:33:58,775 --> 00:34:01,909
In Infinity War, the scope of the
film, I think, is unrivaled.

718
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:04,781
And really, the only way
the film could be made

719
00:34:04,825 --> 00:34:06,609
was in the hands
of Anthony and Joe Russo.

720
00:34:06,653 --> 00:34:09,351
That was an A-plus
version of the shot.

721
00:34:09,395 --> 00:34:11,527
I was really blown away

722
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:13,703
by how culturally powerful
it was.

723
00:34:13,747 --> 00:34:16,358
I've never seen a reaction
like that after a movie.

724
00:34:16,402 --> 00:34:20,188
Infinity War takes people
on an epic quest

725
00:34:20,232 --> 00:34:22,582
that does everything
from entertain

726
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:24,758
and delight you to
devastate you emotionally.

727
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:26,890
The success of that film
is certainly a testament

728
00:34:26,934 --> 00:34:28,979
to the Russo brothers
as a directing team.

729
00:34:29,023 --> 00:34:31,982
There's no doubt
it was not an easy task.

730
00:34:32,026 --> 00:34:33,419
You look at Infinity War,

731
00:34:33,462 --> 00:34:35,334
you're in the hands
of master filmmakers.

732
00:34:35,377 --> 00:34:37,553
It is truly remarkable.

733
00:34:37,597 --> 00:34:40,643
Slow it down just a hair and just
turn it into a little bit of a...

734
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:42,341
Yeah. Sure.

735
00:34:42,384 --> 00:34:44,082
You know, like, "I'm getting...
I'm gonna get," you know.

736
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,996
Give it a little look and then go with it.
Okay? Here we go.

737
00:34:49,522 --> 00:34:52,438
We talk a lot about the
culmination of Avengers: Endgame.

738
00:34:52,481 --> 00:34:54,701
We wanted to do a great finale

739
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:59,488
that not only had the spectacle
worthy of Infinity War,

740
00:34:59,532 --> 00:35:03,840
but with sequences and scenes
and character interactions

741
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:06,974
that could only be done
with Joe and Anthony.

742
00:35:07,017 --> 00:35:09,977
They're the only directors that
could handle this many characters

743
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,153
and doing this
ambitious of a story

744
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:15,025
that needs to pay off every
film that we've ever made

745
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:18,159
in one climactic conclusion,
while at the same time,

746
00:35:18,203 --> 00:35:22,685
introducing an entirely
new direction for the future.

747
00:35:22,729 --> 00:35:25,079
When we were thinking
about these two Avengers films,

748
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,995
we came up with this idea,
let's shoot them together.

749
00:35:28,038 --> 00:35:31,129
And it seemed like
a great idea at the time,

750
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:33,305
but it's impossible
to juggle one story.

751
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:35,698
And the idea of two stories
this complicated,

752
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:38,440
figuring out what they are,
how they intertwine.

753
00:35:38,484 --> 00:35:44,098
The Russos are so adept at
handling complicated storylines.

754
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,318
You know, after the camera
whips to you...

755
00:35:46,361 --> 00:35:48,015
- Yeah.
- Take in the group for a beat,

756
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:49,234
and then ask
where's Fury.

757
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:50,539
You have to understand

758
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:52,193
what makes
each character unique,

759
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:54,239
what special qualities
they bring to it,

760
00:35:54,282 --> 00:35:55,979
how they can shine.

761
00:35:56,023 --> 00:35:57,590
It's pretty amazing
watching these brothers, like,

762
00:35:57,633 --> 00:36:01,246
create these amazing,
powerfully epic tales.

763
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:02,508
Go that way?

764
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:04,074
Well, that'll just be
the badass delivery.

765
00:36:04,118 --> 00:36:07,165
You feel very, you know,
safe and taken care of

766
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:09,689
and at the same time,
you feel like you can contribute.

767
00:36:09,732 --> 00:36:12,213
I'm clearly
charting the course.

768
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:14,346
And then you just come in
and start charting the course.

769
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:15,999
- Yeah.
- You're like...

770
00:36:16,043 --> 00:36:18,263
Uh, we're going to...
Where to?

771
00:36:18,306 --> 00:36:19,612
The magic trick is

772
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:22,005
that they're working with
so many actors that have,

773
00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:24,007
you know, their own
relationship to the characters

774
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:27,141
that come from their own
sort of parts of the universe.

775
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,099
And to make that
all into something

776
00:36:29,143 --> 00:36:32,364
that feels cohesive
is incredible.

777
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:34,061
- So, it's all in one piece.
- So it's gonna be like...

778
00:36:34,104 --> 00:36:34,963
- It's focused at the end of it.
- Boom.

779
00:36:35,087 --> 00:36:36,063
Go back to the stake.

780
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,806
They've done
the unthinkable, really.

781
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:42,548
I mean, it's not
just two movies back to back.

782
00:36:42,591 --> 00:36:45,159
It's the two biggest movies
of all time,

783
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,249
and they've been at the helm
the whole time without fail.

784
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:49,642
They love these characters,

785
00:36:49,685 --> 00:36:51,948
and they know
these characters inside out.

786
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:54,081
Anthony and Joe,

787
00:36:54,124 --> 00:36:56,605
they've essentially been on a job
for six, seven years now.

788
00:36:56,649 --> 00:36:58,433
And I love them.

789
00:36:58,477 --> 00:37:00,914
And they love the Avengers.

790
00:37:00,957 --> 00:37:03,177
Joe and I have
always loved to figure out,

791
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,701
"How do we take the character
and how do we take the audience

792
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:09,444
"and how do we take ourselves
on a surprising journey

793
00:37:09,488 --> 00:37:11,272
"that is not
holding anything back?"

794
00:37:11,316 --> 00:37:13,579
As you progress
through films like that,

795
00:37:13,622 --> 00:37:15,929
your job as directors
gets bigger and bigger.

796
00:37:15,972 --> 00:37:18,410
We really have
an amazing team around us

797
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:20,760
that allow us to focus
on the bigger picture,

798
00:37:20,803 --> 00:37:23,110
so we're very happy
with this experience.

799
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:35,731
It's been really exciting
to get to work

800
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:38,604
with some of the actors
from different franchises

801
00:37:38,647 --> 00:37:40,475
that I have just admired that,

802
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:42,869
I guess you could say,
are sort of an extended family.

803
00:37:42,912 --> 00:37:44,523
And then of course,
there's new characters

804
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:47,047
that are also being
introduced to the family.

805
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,178
Where are you going?

806
00:37:48,222 --> 00:37:49,702
To kill Thanos.

807
00:37:49,745 --> 00:37:51,312
It's certainly
great to see that

808
00:37:51,356 --> 00:37:55,185
the audiences are embracing and
even asking for, begging for

809
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:57,971
really strong
female superheroes.

810
00:37:58,014 --> 00:38:00,190
It's wonderful to feel
like you've witnessed

811
00:38:00,234 --> 00:38:01,714
and been a part
of that growth.

812
00:38:01,757 --> 00:38:03,411
I'm always picking up
after you boys.

813
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:11,158
I think one of the dangers
of playing a kickass chick

814
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:16,381
is that you just mimic what
you've always seen kickass men do.

815
00:38:16,424 --> 00:38:18,296
You want to show me
how to punch? Go ahead.

816
00:38:20,515 --> 00:38:21,603
That's how you punch.

817
00:38:21,647 --> 00:38:24,214
It's really important
for me to find

818
00:38:24,258 --> 00:38:26,521
the voice and the rhythm
and the style

819
00:38:26,565 --> 00:38:29,785
and the meaning of what
it means to be a powerful woman.

820
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:32,353
And that that be
its own distinct thing.

821
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:36,096
I so enjoy being
able to be a piece in the puzzle

822
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:38,577
that was a woman
who was the head of an army

823
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:43,408
and who was the right-hand
"man" of the leader.

824
00:38:43,451 --> 00:38:47,890
And seeing how that resonated was
very humbling and very moving.

825
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:51,764
Women are demanding
equality in the workplace,

826
00:38:51,807 --> 00:38:55,681
whether you're in a superhero
costume or an office job.

827
00:38:55,724 --> 00:38:58,205
And I think Marvel
is doing a great job

828
00:38:58,248 --> 00:38:59,859
of amplifying that
in the films

829
00:38:59,902 --> 00:39:02,209
and representing
that properly.

830
00:39:02,252 --> 00:39:04,037
And that's a beautiful thing.

831
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,823
Every morning, I think about
every way that I can help women

832
00:39:07,867 --> 00:39:10,260
have representation
and be out there in the world.

833
00:39:10,304 --> 00:39:11,653
And I think for me
it's important

834
00:39:11,697 --> 00:39:13,742
for women to know
that it can be done.

835
00:39:16,745 --> 00:39:19,226
Hi, I'm Peter Parker.

836
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:21,489
Hey, Peter Parker.

837
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:22,534
You got something for me?

838
00:39:26,712 --> 00:39:31,499
Our goal with Endgame was to
provide a climactic conclusion

839
00:39:31,543 --> 00:39:33,545
to the journey
that the MCU has been on

840
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:35,068
for these 11 years now.

841
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:37,592
And so we spent a lot of
time looking backwards

842
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:40,682
at the journey that the
overarching narrative has taken

843
00:39:40,726 --> 00:39:44,686
and all the characters that
have been a part of that story.

844
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:47,385
And I remember it just
dawning on all of us one day,

845
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:51,084
just, like, the sheer number
of amazing female characters

846
00:39:51,127 --> 00:39:52,955
that were now in the MCU,

847
00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:55,393
which is so exciting
and impressive to all of us.

848
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:58,874
I mean, we really looked for an
opportunity to just celebrate that.

849
00:39:58,918 --> 00:40:00,615
You could just see
this really beautiful thing,

850
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:02,225
which you kind of
get a taste of

851
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:04,184
with Avengers: Infinity War
as well,

852
00:40:04,227 --> 00:40:06,708
which is very powerful
people meeting each other,

853
00:40:06,752 --> 00:40:09,450
powerful people
all being in one room,

854
00:40:09,494 --> 00:40:12,018
powerful people that all
have very specific skills

855
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:14,281
working together
to form a team.

856
00:40:14,324 --> 00:40:16,022
We have a smaller moment

857
00:40:16,065 --> 00:40:19,155
in the Wakanda field
in Infinity War,

858
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:23,029
where we have Okoye,
Natasha and Wanda

859
00:40:23,072 --> 00:40:25,161
teaming up to fight Proxima.

860
00:40:25,205 --> 00:40:29,122
And that moment in the trench
was pretty spectacular to see

861
00:40:29,165 --> 00:40:30,993
when we were
shooting Infinity War,

862
00:40:31,037 --> 00:40:34,693
and we wanted a little bit
more of that in Avengers 4.

863
00:40:34,736 --> 00:40:36,477
I don't know how you're gonna
get it through all of that.

864
00:40:38,131 --> 00:40:39,262
Don't worry.

865
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:41,569
She's got help.

866
00:40:43,266 --> 00:40:45,094
It was really beautiful
to feel

867
00:40:45,138 --> 00:40:48,228
this sort of Marvel
sisterhood, you know,

868
00:40:48,271 --> 00:40:50,360
and we're all coming from so
many different films

869
00:40:50,404 --> 00:40:52,624
that we all came together.

870
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:54,190
It was kind of like,
"I see what you do.

871
00:40:54,234 --> 00:40:55,931
I know your powers. Okay.

872
00:40:55,975 --> 00:40:58,064
"Show me what you've got,"
and then we just clicked.

873
00:40:58,107 --> 00:41:00,370
And we were just, like,
cheering each other on.

874
00:41:00,414 --> 00:41:02,285
Everyone just kind of
taking their turns

875
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:03,504
moving around,

876
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:06,159
trying to help each other out.
It was so fun.

877
00:41:06,202 --> 00:41:07,682
- You share...
- Exactly.

878
00:41:07,726 --> 00:41:08,944
- ...this connection, you know.
- So there's a connection

879
00:41:08,988 --> 00:41:11,686
- without ever having met.
- Yeah.

880
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:13,688
It's a really cool thing
about the whole battle.

881
00:41:13,732 --> 00:41:16,844
That day was insane.

882
00:41:17,387 --> 00:41:19,999
We were all in it together
and it felt electric.

883
00:41:20,042 --> 00:41:21,304
It was really, really cool.

884
00:41:21,348 --> 00:41:23,829
Three, and action!

885
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:31,793
You know, I normally don't
watch playback on the monitor,

886
00:41:31,837 --> 00:41:36,015
but I wanted to see that reveal
of all the women of Marvel,

887
00:41:36,058 --> 00:41:38,713
and I thought
it was really powerful

888
00:41:38,757 --> 00:41:40,541
and really exhilarating.

889
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:43,413
And I was thinking of all of
the young girls in the audience

890
00:41:43,457 --> 00:41:46,547
who will probably feel
really inspired by that

891
00:41:46,591 --> 00:41:47,983
in one way or another.

892
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:50,029
So, it was a really nice
thing to be a part of.

893
00:41:51,334 --> 00:41:52,553
And it's exciting
'cause all of us are saying,

894
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:54,120
"I've never
experienced this before.

895
00:41:54,163 --> 00:41:56,514
"I've never been in a film
with this many women

896
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:59,821
"and this many strong women
who stand equal to the men."

897
00:41:59,865 --> 00:42:01,127
There is something
very powerful

898
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,824
and we're realizing it
more and more,

899
00:42:02,868 --> 00:42:04,870
just how magical it is

900
00:42:04,913 --> 00:42:07,655
to allow women to express
their full gamut of their power

901
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:09,570
and their abilities
as a unit.

902
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:26,282
- What's wrong with him?
- Oh, he's pissed.

903
00:42:26,326 --> 00:42:28,023
He thinks he failed.

904
00:42:28,067 --> 00:42:30,199
Thor has suffered
tremendous loss,

905
00:42:30,243 --> 00:42:32,027
more so than
any other character.

906
00:42:32,071 --> 00:42:34,073
Asgard has been destroyed,

907
00:42:34,116 --> 00:42:37,206
and now he has to suffer
the loss to Thanos.

908
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,949
How does a person who's suffered
two devastating losses like that

909
00:42:40,993 --> 00:42:43,343
move forward,
and how would he process that?

910
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:50,829
Boys!

911
00:42:50,872 --> 00:42:52,744
Every aspect of him
was broken.

912
00:42:52,787 --> 00:42:54,920
Some tragic things have
happened and he's decided,

913
00:42:54,963 --> 00:42:57,313
"You know what?
I'm just gonna check out

914
00:42:57,357 --> 00:42:59,011
"and eat pizza
and drink beer."

915
00:42:59,054 --> 00:43:00,316
And that's what he's done,
you know.

916
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,448
You all right?

917
00:43:01,491 --> 00:43:02,841
Yes. I'm fine. Why?

918
00:43:02,884 --> 00:43:04,320
Why, don't I look all right?

919
00:43:04,364 --> 00:43:05,408
You look like
melted ice cream.

920
00:43:06,888 --> 00:43:08,760
So, what's up?
You just here for a hang?

921
00:43:08,803 --> 00:43:12,328
He's a very depressed
sort of removed Thor,

922
00:43:12,372 --> 00:43:15,288
becoming the opposite of what
we've known him to be in the past.

923
00:43:15,331 --> 00:43:16,550
I know you think
I'm down here

924
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,552
wallowing in my own
self-pity...

925
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,641
feeling sorry for myself,
hoping to be rescued,

926
00:43:20,685 --> 00:43:22,948
hoping to be saved,
but you're wrong, okay?

927
00:43:22,991 --> 00:43:24,732
But the great thing
about Thor is, like,

928
00:43:24,776 --> 00:43:27,430
there's something in his
spirit that stands in contrast

929
00:43:27,474 --> 00:43:30,390
to where he's let himself go
physically and emotionally.

930
00:43:30,433 --> 00:43:31,739
There's beer on the ship.

931
00:43:35,134 --> 00:43:36,265
What kind?

932
00:43:40,182 --> 00:43:42,620
Being able to do
this new version of Thor,

933
00:43:42,663 --> 00:43:45,448
it's hugely liberating
and fun.

934
00:43:45,492 --> 00:43:47,450
We had a big sort of fat suit,

935
00:43:47,494 --> 00:43:49,670
which I think was
sort of 60 or 70 pounds.

936
00:43:49,714 --> 00:43:50,889
This'll move.

937
00:43:50,932 --> 00:43:52,107
Yep,
that's the shimmy.

938
00:43:52,151 --> 00:43:54,306
It was the hottest
I've ever been.

939
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:56,111
How does that feel?

940
00:43:56,155 --> 00:43:57,504
I mean, amazing.

941
00:43:57,547 --> 00:43:58,962
It looks like
it's in the right place.

942
00:43:59,506 --> 00:44:00,899
And we have,
obviously, the beard, the hair,

943
00:44:00,942 --> 00:44:02,422
and I have these things
that go in the mouth

944
00:44:02,465 --> 00:44:03,902
to kind of plump out
my cheeks a bit,

945
00:44:03,945 --> 00:44:06,208
which sort of had a little
effect on the voice as well,

946
00:44:06,252 --> 00:44:07,514
but probably in a good way.

947
00:44:07,557 --> 00:44:08,646
It was a different Thor.

948
00:44:08,689 --> 00:44:11,779
Hi, my name's Thor.
I'm 22 years old,

949
00:44:11,823 --> 00:44:15,130
live on Asgard
and I like sugar.

950
00:44:15,174 --> 00:44:17,567
We're shooting
a superhero film

951
00:44:17,611 --> 00:44:20,092
and here's one of the most
recognizable superheroes,

952
00:44:20,135 --> 00:44:22,268
but he's just turned
into a new character.

953
00:44:22,311 --> 00:44:24,444
What Chris does
with that character

954
00:44:24,487 --> 00:44:27,142
and how it just
kind of has this shift,

955
00:44:27,186 --> 00:44:29,667
his excitement
was really palpable.

956
00:44:31,712 --> 00:44:33,192
He'd been playing
the character for a while

957
00:44:33,235 --> 00:44:34,759
and really wanted
to find something new.

958
00:44:34,802 --> 00:44:37,718
He has such dexterity
as a talent.

959
00:44:37,762 --> 00:44:39,154
He's incredibly funny.

960
00:44:39,198 --> 00:44:42,201
He has just
really lovely energy.

961
00:44:42,244 --> 00:44:43,637
Is he asleep?

962
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,813
No, no.
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

963
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:52,254
Thor's new look will seem
like it's being played for laughs.

964
00:44:52,298 --> 00:44:55,388
But thanks to the performance
that Chris Hemsworth gives,

965
00:44:55,431 --> 00:44:56,737
it becomes very touching.

966
00:44:56,781 --> 00:44:59,305
Let me, just let me,
let me do this.

967
00:44:59,348 --> 00:45:00,741
Let me do something right.

968
00:45:00,785 --> 00:45:03,309
And we see
over the course of the film,

969
00:45:03,352 --> 00:45:06,268
how he tries to regain
his sense of purpose

970
00:45:06,312 --> 00:45:08,270
and regain
his sense of redemption.

971
00:45:08,814 --> 00:45:10,229
It's not working.

972
00:45:13,928 --> 00:45:15,451
At the end of the day,

973
00:45:15,495 --> 00:45:16,801
even though he's carrying
a lot more weight,

974
00:45:16,844 --> 00:45:18,411
he's still the Thor
that we love.

975
00:45:18,454 --> 00:45:20,065
I'm still worthy.

976
00:45:20,108 --> 00:45:21,849
The Avengers
pull him back in.

977
00:45:21,893 --> 00:45:23,329
To have a sense of duty,

978
00:45:23,372 --> 00:45:25,244
he finally comes around

979
00:45:25,287 --> 00:45:28,029
and he's a full-on Avenger,
with carrying another 80 pounds, though.

980
00:45:28,073 --> 00:45:30,118
Look at
the first couple steps.

981
00:45:30,162 --> 00:45:31,554
I thought I was booking.

982
00:45:31,598 --> 00:45:33,143
I thought
I was going so quick.

983
00:45:33,687 --> 00:45:35,384
Maybe you want
to give a battle cry.

984
00:45:35,428 --> 00:45:36,603
Oh, yeah.
Good one there.

985
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,913
It felt like I was playing a
completely different character.

986
00:45:41,956 --> 00:45:45,525
There was a real opportunity to
just kind of swing for the fences

987
00:45:45,568 --> 00:45:46,831
and it was so much fun.

988
00:45:46,874 --> 00:45:50,095
What do you think
is coursing through my veins?

989
00:45:50,138 --> 00:45:52,880
Cocoa Puffs? Nachos?
Embarrassment?

990
00:45:53,489 --> 00:45:54,708
Lightning.

991
00:46:06,198 --> 00:46:08,940
Asking a woman to dance
always seems so terrifying.

992
00:46:08,983 --> 00:46:12,857
And the past few years just
didn't seem to matter that much.

993
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,860
- Figured I'd wait.
- For what?

994
00:46:17,383 --> 00:46:19,124
Right partner.

995
00:46:21,474 --> 00:46:24,520
The essential conflict
in Steve

996
00:46:24,564 --> 00:46:26,740
is the desire to serve.

997
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:31,310
And that desire to serve would
supersede his personal identity.

998
00:46:31,353 --> 00:46:34,443
He's got an amazing set
of morals and values.

999
00:46:34,487 --> 00:46:35,880
He's an incredibly good man,

1000
00:46:35,923 --> 00:46:39,187
given the hand that life
has dealt him.

1001
00:46:39,231 --> 00:46:41,973
Doctors kinda know that if this
guy is given this great gift,

1002
00:46:42,016 --> 00:46:43,365
he won't
take advantage of it.

1003
00:46:43,409 --> 00:46:45,846
He understands
how to value what he has

1004
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:47,805
'cause he didn't always
have it.

1005
00:46:47,848 --> 00:46:49,676
The common issue
among all the Marvel heroes

1006
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:52,200
is that they have a very
vulnerable side to them.

1007
00:46:52,244 --> 00:46:55,856
And Steve Rogers is certainly
no exception to that.

1008
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,379
He is probably
the most vulnerable

1009
00:46:57,423 --> 00:46:59,817
before he becomes
Captain America.

1010
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,428
He, more that any
of the other superheroes,

1011
00:47:02,471 --> 00:47:05,257
really, kind of,
loses who he was

1012
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,476
in the process
of becoming him.

1013
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,739
'Cause he was a scrawny,
90-pound man,

1014
00:47:09,783 --> 00:47:11,567
who gets changed into
Captain America.

1015
00:47:11,611 --> 00:47:13,569
So the old him
ceases to exist.

1016
00:47:13,613 --> 00:47:16,834
There's no life of Steve
Rogers that he goes back to.

1017
00:47:16,877 --> 00:47:18,923
Almost,
I get the feeling,

1018
00:47:18,966 --> 00:47:21,142
he'd be more comfortable if he
could wear the outfit all the time

1019
00:47:21,186 --> 00:47:22,665
because then he has
a persona.

1020
00:47:22,709 --> 00:47:23,884
Then he knows who he is.

1021
00:47:23,928 --> 00:47:25,451
That's the first time
he was valued,

1022
00:47:25,494 --> 00:47:27,496
he had very few people
who valued him.

1023
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,889
He wasn't quite
an orphan

1024
00:47:28,933 --> 00:47:30,673
but he was alone
fairly early on

1025
00:47:30,717 --> 00:47:32,110
and he had one friend.

1026
00:47:32,153 --> 00:47:34,677
It was Bucky Barnes,
and Bucky Barnes goes off to war.

1027
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:35,896
And he was a scrappy kid

1028
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,158
who got picked on all his life.

1029
00:47:37,202 --> 00:47:38,986
He is very relatable.

1030
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:40,683
He is a superhero.

1031
00:47:40,727 --> 00:47:43,948
But all his power is basically
what the human body can do.

1032
00:47:43,991 --> 00:47:46,864
Once circumstances lead
him to being Captain America,

1033
00:47:46,907 --> 00:47:49,605
he finds, you know,
a purpose.

1034
00:47:49,649 --> 00:47:52,478
You told me you thought I
was meant for more than this.

1035
00:47:52,521 --> 00:47:53,609
Did you mean that?

1036
00:47:54,741 --> 00:47:55,742
Every word.

1037
00:47:57,787 --> 00:47:59,572
Peggy has a career.

1038
00:47:59,615 --> 00:48:02,183
And she has a lot of
self-respect.

1039
00:48:02,227 --> 00:48:04,098
And she's pretty sick
and tired

1040
00:48:04,142 --> 00:48:05,491
of lots of men kind of
not taking her

1041
00:48:05,534 --> 00:48:07,667
seriously in the Army,
and you know,

1042
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:09,974
playing around with her.

1043
00:48:10,017 --> 00:48:13,760
I think Peggy relates to someone really
fighting for what they believe in

1044
00:48:13,803 --> 00:48:16,371
and really having to struggle
all the time to prove themselves.

1045
00:48:16,415 --> 00:48:18,765
And, she being the only
woman in this environment,

1046
00:48:18,808 --> 00:48:20,941
knows exactly what
that feels like.

1047
00:48:20,985 --> 00:48:24,292
It's not just the normal,
everyday love story.

1048
00:48:24,336 --> 00:48:25,511
There's something else.

1049
00:48:25,554 --> 00:48:27,252
In the same way
that we love Steve,

1050
00:48:27,295 --> 00:48:30,472
because he exhibits
some sort of determination

1051
00:48:30,516 --> 00:48:31,778
and selflessness,

1052
00:48:31,821 --> 00:48:34,215
that's the same thing
that attracts her to him.

1053
00:48:34,259 --> 00:48:36,783
Steve learned a lot
from Peggy Carter.

1054
00:48:36,826 --> 00:48:38,654
If you go back and look
at The First Avenger,

1055
00:48:38,698 --> 00:48:40,221
that is
the essential relationship

1056
00:48:40,265 --> 00:48:42,876
that I think turned him
into who he is today.

1057
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,617
It turned him
into Captain America.

1058
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:46,619
Her sense of integrity,

1059
00:48:46,662 --> 00:48:50,318
her call to action are all
qualities that have been engrained

1060
00:48:50,362 --> 00:48:52,581
in Steve
and are his best qualities.

1061
00:48:52,625 --> 00:48:55,715
And they come from
an example, from Peggy.

1062
00:48:55,758 --> 00:48:58,500
And so I think it was
critical that her character

1063
00:48:58,544 --> 00:49:00,198
embody
those essential qualities

1064
00:49:00,241 --> 00:49:02,243
because he wouldn't be
who he is without them.

1065
00:49:02,287 --> 00:49:04,593
I'm gonna need a rain check
on that dance.

1066
00:49:04,637 --> 00:49:07,118
A week, next Saturday
at the Stork Club.

1067
00:49:07,161 --> 00:49:08,815
You got it.

1068
00:49:08,858 --> 00:49:11,470
8:00 on the dot.
Don't you dare be late.

1069
00:49:17,824 --> 00:49:20,740
The great tragedy
of Steve Rogers' existence

1070
00:49:20,783 --> 00:49:22,960
was, now he found
he love of his life

1071
00:49:23,003 --> 00:49:25,397
and then,
had to sacrifice himself,

1072
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,704
and 70 years of his life
to save the world.

1073
00:49:28,748 --> 00:49:31,185
I always found it
very endearing about Cap,

1074
00:49:31,229 --> 00:49:33,057
that for all that character
has sacrificed,

1075
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,449
and he's sacrificed a lot.

1076
00:49:34,493 --> 00:49:36,756
But one thing he could
never let go of was Peggy.

1077
00:49:36,799 --> 00:49:38,976
And it just stayed with
him all those years.

1078
00:49:40,325 --> 00:49:42,980
It's been so long.

1079
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:46,984
So long.

1080
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,291
Well, I couldn't leave
my best girl.

1081
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,945
Not when she owes
me a dance.

1082
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:59,257
We want the audiences
to feel moved by it.

1083
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:02,825
People have sent me poems that
they've written about Peggy and Cap,

1084
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:05,002
and montages
that they've sent me

1085
00:50:05,045 --> 00:50:07,743
of Peggy and Cap's
greatest moments,

1086
00:50:07,787 --> 00:50:09,528
putting, like, soundtracks
over them,

1087
00:50:09,571 --> 00:50:11,356
like Aerosmith soundtracks
or something,

1088
00:50:11,399 --> 00:50:13,923
with longing looks
from Peggy and Cap.

1089
00:50:13,967 --> 00:50:16,187
And I'm realizing that the
story has affected them.

1090
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:18,450
And that's great 'cause we feel
like that's what we wanted.

1091
00:50:18,493 --> 00:50:20,408
We wanted something
that had heart to it

1092
00:50:20,452 --> 00:50:22,193
that people,
essentially, cared about.

1093
00:50:22,236 --> 00:50:25,326
Even after he died, Steve
was still changing my life.

1094
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:28,112
I really like what they let
my character experience

1095
00:50:28,155 --> 00:50:29,374
in these movies,
to be honest,

1096
00:50:29,417 --> 00:50:31,245
the struggle
and the sacrifice

1097
00:50:31,289 --> 00:50:33,073
and the culmination
of friendships

1098
00:50:33,117 --> 00:50:34,770
that have had peaks
and valleys.

1099
00:50:34,814 --> 00:50:37,208
And it's just a really
layered, colorful experience.

1100
00:50:37,251 --> 00:50:39,340
His arc over the course
of the movies

1101
00:50:39,384 --> 00:50:41,342
take him
from a place of service,

1102
00:50:41,386 --> 00:50:43,518
to where he started
to question authority

1103
00:50:43,562 --> 00:50:45,651
and ultimately
embrace his identity

1104
00:50:45,694 --> 00:50:47,348
and become
self-actualized.

1105
00:50:47,392 --> 00:50:49,959
And he has the opportunity
in Avengers: Endgame

1106
00:50:50,003 --> 00:50:52,179
to go back
and correct the loss

1107
00:50:52,223 --> 00:50:54,660
and be with Peggy,
the love of his life.

1108
00:50:54,703 --> 00:50:56,531
And he makes that choice.

1109
00:50:56,575 --> 00:50:59,273
So, did something go wrong
or did something go right?

1110
00:51:00,361 --> 00:51:01,797
Well, after I

1111
00:51:01,841 --> 00:51:03,973
put the stones back,
I thought...

1112
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:07,107
Maybe I'll...

1113
00:51:07,151 --> 00:51:09,457
try some of that life
Tony was

1114
00:51:10,154 --> 00:51:12,025
telling me to get.

1115
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,767
You're trying' to tap into Steve's
journey before you go to set

1116
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:16,725
to understand what this moment
means to him.

1117
00:51:16,769 --> 00:51:18,379
But you can't help but think
about your own.

1118
00:51:18,423 --> 00:51:20,251
And think about what
this entire experience

1119
00:51:20,294 --> 00:51:21,317
has meant to you.

1120
00:51:21,861 --> 00:51:24,429
God, you can get choked up even
thinking about it right now.

1121
00:51:24,472 --> 00:51:25,952
You wanna tell me
about her?

1122
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:35,222
No.

1123
00:51:35,266 --> 00:51:36,615
No, I don't think I will.

1124
00:52:04,556 --> 00:52:05,992
Are these our gojis?

1125
00:52:06,035 --> 00:52:07,863
- They're not.
- What's wrong with ours?

1126
00:52:07,907 --> 00:52:10,170
- Your alpaca ate them all.
- Oh.

1127
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:12,303
- All of them.
- What a glowing endorsement.

1128
00:52:12,346 --> 00:52:14,348
First of all,
Gerald is our alpaca.

1129
00:52:14,392 --> 00:52:17,090
He's not my alpaca
if he's eating my gojis.

1130
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,483
Okay. They're gonna be nice in
the salad right there, right?

1131
00:52:18,526 --> 00:52:20,833
No, don't, don't, don't!
Could you put it down?

1132
00:52:20,876 --> 00:52:22,574
- Get out of my kitchen.
- Okay.

1133
00:52:23,017 --> 00:52:24,184
Whoops.

1134
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:26,143
- We're good here, right?
- Yeah, we're great.

1135
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:29,972
Tell Madam Secretary
that lunch is in five.

1136
00:52:30,016 --> 00:52:32,975
I will collect
our alpha female posthaste.

1137
00:52:41,201 --> 00:52:43,899
And what happened
to the Tesseract after that?

1138
00:52:43,943 --> 00:52:45,379
It's at the bottom
of the ocean.

1139
00:52:45,423 --> 00:52:47,599
It fell out of the plane
after I had to crash it.

1140
00:52:47,642 --> 00:52:49,470
Yeah, I've been
meaning to ask,

1141
00:52:49,514 --> 00:52:52,604
why did you have
to crash the plane anyway?

1142
00:52:53,447 --> 00:52:54,867
There were bombs onboard.

1143
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:56,738
Bombs onboard.

1144
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,918
And you couldn't have jumped out of
the plane before you crashed it?

1145
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:12,232
How long
did you fight these guys?

1146
00:53:12,276 --> 00:53:15,322
About, uh,
two or three hours.

1147
00:53:15,366 --> 00:53:16,802
Hours?

1148
00:53:16,845 --> 00:53:19,108
The Chitauri are the
suckiest army in the galaxy.

1149
00:53:19,152 --> 00:53:20,980
Why didn't you just
blow up the mother ship?

1150
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:23,156
We didn't know
that was a thing.

1151
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,114
You didn't know
that was a thing?

1152
00:53:25,158 --> 00:53:27,204
Everyone knows... Hey!

1153
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:28,379
There we go.

1154
00:53:40,521 --> 00:53:41,740
All clear. Which way?

1155
00:53:43,698 --> 00:53:44,743
Oh.

1156
00:53:44,786 --> 00:53:46,053
You say something?

1157
00:53:46,397 --> 00:53:48,094
I said
I want to claw my eyes out.

1158
00:53:48,137 --> 00:53:49,748
But unfortunately,
it wouldn't do any good

1159
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:51,706
'cause I already
saw the awfulness.

1160
00:53:52,968 --> 00:53:54,970
- Will you focus?
- I'm focused.

1161
00:53:55,014 --> 00:53:57,538
This pretty place is about
to get uglified real quick

1162
00:53:57,582 --> 00:53:59,410
by a bunch of frickin' elves.

1163
00:53:59,453 --> 00:54:03,283
Do you know that I saw
all these people die?

1164
00:54:03,327 --> 00:54:05,677
So this is a little bit
difficult for me, okay?

1165
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,809
So why don't you
reach down deep inside

1166
00:54:07,853 --> 00:54:10,290
and try and find
a small ounce of humanity?

1167
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:11,770
Just give me the thingy.

1168
00:54:11,813 --> 00:54:12,988
"Just give me the thingy.
Just give me the thingy."

1169
00:54:13,032 --> 00:54:15,077
I didn't even
want to come here.

1170
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:17,776
Reliving all these
repressed memories.

1171
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:20,518
- My God, get it together.
- Get it together.

1172
00:54:21,867 --> 00:54:23,608
You're embarrassing.

1173
00:54:23,651 --> 00:54:24,957
All right.
Which way?

1174
00:54:27,873 --> 00:54:29,178
I don't know.

1175
00:54:29,222 --> 00:54:30,789
You don't know?
You used to frickin' live here!

1176
00:54:30,832 --> 00:54:33,270
For 1,500 years.
Not forever.

1177
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:36,316
That way, I think.
Yeah. Maybe.

1178
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,840
We are dead.
We are so, so dead.

1179
00:54:44,803 --> 00:54:47,327
I get it. It's nutty,
it's crazy-making

1180
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:49,677
'cause you start worrying
about a legacy, you know.

1181
00:54:49,721 --> 00:54:51,592
You want to leave them
the better world,

1182
00:54:51,636 --> 00:54:54,334
and then you realize you haven't
done all that much to give them one,

1183
00:54:54,378 --> 00:54:55,553
and it's...

1184
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:57,685
What's your name, again?

1185
00:54:57,729 --> 00:54:59,165
- Potts.
- Potts.

1186
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:00,949
Yeah.

1187
00:55:00,993 --> 00:55:02,864
You want to come work
for me, Potts?

1188
00:55:02,908 --> 00:55:05,258
I'm a little tied up
in futures right now.

1189
00:56:56,978 --> 00:56:59,459
Nobody pull a hamstring.

1190
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:01,505
Warm your butt cheeks up.
Warm up your butt cheeks!

1191
00:57:02,244 --> 00:57:03,420
Cut there.

1192
00:57:03,463 --> 00:57:05,291
Copy that!

1193
00:57:05,334 --> 00:57:06,684
There you go, ya cub.

1194
00:57:09,977 --> 00:57:11,340
I broke it.

1195
00:57:11,384 --> 00:57:12,346
Fill.

1196
00:57:16,215 --> 00:57:16,830
Action!

1197
00:57:16,954 --> 00:57:18,130
No, no, not yet.

1198
00:57:18,173 --> 00:57:19,479
All right, here we go.

1199
00:57:19,523 --> 00:57:21,133
The thing about time travel...

1200
00:57:22,874 --> 00:57:24,136
It's more important
to look marvelous

1201
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:25,529
than to feel marvelous.

1202
00:57:25,572 --> 00:57:27,052
I can't believe
I made a whole movie

1203
00:57:27,095 --> 00:57:29,097
with this thing on.
This is...

1204
00:57:29,141 --> 00:57:30,403
Yeah, does it
look cool or...

1205
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,231
Yeah.
It looks cool. Right?

1206
00:57:32,274 --> 00:57:34,799
It doesn't feel cool, but if it looks
cool, that's what matters.

1207
00:57:34,842 --> 00:57:36,191
Do you have any idea

1208
00:57:36,235 --> 00:57:38,280
what's coursing
through my veins right now?

1209
00:57:38,324 --> 00:57:39,368
Funyuns?

1210
00:57:42,284 --> 00:57:43,416
Yes!

1211
00:57:43,938 --> 00:57:45,157
Orange soda?

1212
00:57:48,203 --> 00:57:53,121
We are getting the whole team,
aren't we? A duck!

1213
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,690
There, good one.

1214
00:58:05,307 --> 00:58:08,006
You see what I have to deal with here?
Ten years of this...

1215
00:58:08,049 --> 00:58:10,312
<i>♪ Her synaptic drive
was probably ♪</i>

1216
00:58:10,356 --> 00:58:12,663
<i>♪ damaged in battle ♪</i>

1217
00:58:12,706 --> 00:58:16,667
<i>♪ Her synaptic drive was
badly damaged in battle ♪</i>

1218
00:58:25,066 --> 00:58:27,112
Are you sure
you want to 90210 this?

1219
00:58:27,721 --> 00:58:29,593
Fix Star-Lord's hair.

1220
00:58:31,363 --> 00:58:31,912
Whoo!

1221
00:58:36,295 --> 00:58:37,383
Turn her off!

1222
00:58:46,871 --> 00:58:49,569
I feel like I've given you
all you could ever want.

1223
00:58:57,577 --> 00:58:59,100
God, it seems
like a thousand years ago.

1224
00:59:00,928 --> 00:59:02,582
I fought my way
out of that cave,

1225
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:04,541
became Iron Man,

1226
00:59:05,977 --> 00:59:07,108
realized I loved you.

1227
00:59:08,849 --> 00:59:10,851
I know I said
no more surprises,

1228
00:59:10,895 --> 00:59:14,420
but I was really hoping
to pull off one last one.

1229
00:59:16,335 --> 00:59:19,033
The really unique thing
about Endgame for Joe and I

1230
00:59:19,077 --> 00:59:22,210
was that this movie
was the ending.

1231
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:26,563
Marvel and Kevin Feige

1232
00:59:26,606 --> 00:59:30,175
have certainly done something
singular in cinematic history.

1233
00:59:30,218 --> 00:59:33,221
We really want to bring that
same experience to the audience.

1234
00:59:33,265 --> 00:59:36,355
We want them to feel the
fullest range of emotion,

1235
00:59:36,398 --> 00:59:39,445
because we feel like that
creates the most complete ending.

1236
00:59:40,402 --> 00:59:42,927
Our goal was
to deliver an experience

1237
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:44,929
that felt like
a very satisfying,

1238
00:59:44,972 --> 00:59:47,932
surprising,
yet fitting ending to this narrative

1239
00:59:47,975 --> 00:59:49,847
that they've been following
for these many years

1240
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:52,023
and these characters that
they've loved for so long.

1241
00:59:55,722 --> 00:59:56,941
Avengers...

1242
01:00:02,555 --> 01:00:03,730
assemble.

1243
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:14,523
It's about as massive a
production as you can mount.

1244
01:00:14,567 --> 01:00:17,352
You really have to have an
incredible team of collaborators

1245
01:00:17,396 --> 01:00:18,919
that you're working with,

1246
01:00:18,963 --> 01:00:21,574
so it's been a very
special experience for us.

1247
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:23,532
There's an energy
here on set

1248
01:00:23,576 --> 01:00:27,145
that comes from everybody's
dedication and character

1249
01:00:27,188 --> 01:00:29,060
and belief in what we're doing,

1250
01:00:29,103 --> 01:00:31,758
that what we're doing is
important and matters to people.

1251
01:00:31,802 --> 01:00:34,152
Everybody recognizes,
I think, in the cast

1252
01:00:34,195 --> 01:00:36,502
what an amazing opportunity
these movies are,

1253
01:00:36,545 --> 01:00:39,723
and they know that it's going
to take everybody's best effort

1254
01:00:39,766 --> 01:00:41,550
to pull them off properly,

1255
01:00:41,594 --> 01:00:44,379
so the collaborative energy
that every one of these actors

1256
01:00:44,423 --> 01:00:47,687
brings to set every day
is really remarkable

1257
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:49,646
and a big part of the magic
of these movies.

1258
01:00:49,689 --> 01:00:51,604
Ladies and gentlemen!

1259
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:52,953
That's a wrap!

1260
01:00:54,912 --> 01:00:58,219
These are all people
that for literally the last seven years,

1261
01:00:58,263 --> 01:01:01,266
uninterrupted,
we have been collaborating with.

1262
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:03,877
They've been
like family to us.

1263
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:06,750
We're going to miss everyone.

1264
01:01:06,793 --> 01:01:09,056
This has been
such a rare opportunity.

1265
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,841
It's the opportunity
of a career.

1266
01:01:10,884 --> 01:01:12,843
And I think
we look at it like that,

1267
01:01:12,886 --> 01:01:14,409
and I think
everybody involved does,

1268
01:01:14,453 --> 01:01:17,848
so this time that we've spent
at Marvel is irreplaceable.

1269
01:01:17,891 --> 01:01:18,892
Yeah.
