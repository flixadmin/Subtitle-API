[Constantine] <i>Previously on</i>
Legends of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:04,423 --> 00:00:06,508
Astra's dead mother
was a powerful witch.

3
00:00:06,842 --> 00:00:08,194
[Natalie] Why did you bring me back?

4
00:00:08,218 --> 00:00:09,970
Natalie, is that really you?

5
00:00:10,262 --> 00:00:12,514
Natalie brought you here
to help me save Astra.

6
00:00:12,848 --> 00:00:14,558
What do you know about the Loom of Fate?

7
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:15,869
Do you wanna know what I'm hiding from?

8
00:00:15,893 --> 00:00:17,603
- Yes, I do.
- That bloody Loom.

9
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,438
He still has ten years.

10
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:20,689
Can you make it zero?

11
00:00:20,772 --> 00:00:22,274
Bye-bye, Johnny.

12
00:00:22,357 --> 00:00:23,901
[coughing violently]

- [fast heartbeat]
- [Ray] <i>John.</i>

00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:29,239
<i>John, can you hear me?</i>

15
00:00:30,115 --> 00:00:31,033
<i>What happened?</i>

16
00:00:31,034 --> 00:00:32,326
[Gary] He just collapsed.

17
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:33,327
Out of nowhere.

18
00:00:33,328 --> 00:00:34,554
[Charlie] After coughing up
a bucket of blood.

19
00:00:34,578 --> 00:00:36,330
Come on, Johnny. Stay with us.

20
00:00:39,249 --> 00:00:40,626
Gideon, we'll need to run a scan.

21
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:41,989
[Gideon] Right away, Dr. Palmer.

22
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:44,338
[coughing]

23
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:45,421
Oxygen mask, please.

24
00:00:47,216 --> 00:00:49,259
The Loom. Where is it, Charlie?

25
00:00:49,343 --> 00:00:50,904
Not now, John, all right?
You've got to rest.

26
00:00:50,928 --> 00:00:52,679
- What loom?
- Astra's ghost mom.

27
00:00:52,763 --> 00:00:55,182
She told... Oh, my God.
Hold me, hold me.

28
00:00:55,307 --> 00:00:56,367
- Hold me.
- What the hell's going on?

29
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:58,077
[Gideon] As you can see from
his chest X-ray,

30
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:00,979
Mr. Constantine has
a very aggressive form of lung cancer.

31
00:01:01,063 --> 00:01:02,689
I'm afraid it's terminal.

32
00:01:05,442 --> 00:01:06,902
[lighter clicks open]

33
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:09,196
Well, there's no point in quitting now.

34
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,918
[groans]

35
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:26,005
There's nothing funny
about lung cancer, John.

36
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:27,756
[chuckles] Who's laughing?

37
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:28,799
[coughs]

38
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,594
If you lose your hair,
I'm shaving my head in solidarity.

39
00:01:31,677 --> 00:01:32,820
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on a minute.

40
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:36,890
No saucy AI is butchering me
and pumping me full of drugs...

41
00:01:36,974 --> 00:01:39,351
[Gideon] I took the liberty
of administering a sedative.

42
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:43,272
Mr. Constantine needs to rest.

43
00:01:45,357 --> 00:01:46,984
Gideon, prepare the Jumpship.

44
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:48,402
[female voice] <i>Clotho...</i>

<i>You can't escape us.</i>

[breathing heavily]

51
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:03,208
No, no.

52
00:02:05,335 --> 00:02:07,129
- Oh, mate!
- Charlie.

53
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:08,254
You're back.

54
00:02:08,255 --> 00:02:10,549
[sighs in relief]
How are you doing, B-easy?

55
00:02:12,718 --> 00:02:13,885
Where you been?

56
00:02:14,428 --> 00:02:17,097
I was just...
I was just hanging out at Constantine's.

57
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:19,808
How is he?

58
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:22,019
- Dying.
- What?

59
00:02:22,102 --> 00:02:23,645
No, don't worry. You know John-o,

60
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:25,249
he's always got a trick up his sleeve.

61
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:29,568
Bro, that donut you made me eat
had me hallucinating.

62
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,362
Starting today, I'm on a juice cleanse.

63
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:34,698
Zari, this is my...

64
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,284
friend, Charlie.

65
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:39,328
Charlie, meet my sister.

66
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:40,620
Mmm. Good fashion.

[Agent Sharpe] <i>Team meeting

00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:45,083
<i>That means you, too, Zari.</i>

70
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,250
Cool.

71
00:02:48,462 --> 00:02:50,130
So, you coming?

72
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,050
I wouldn't miss it. [chuckles]

73
00:02:57,346 --> 00:02:58,346
Ah, Charlie.

74
00:02:58,597 --> 00:03:00,223
We could really use your help right now.

75
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:03,352
With Sara in Star City and
Rory in a mood, we are short-staffed.

76
00:03:03,435 --> 00:03:04,603
What's Mick in a mood about?

77
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:07,189
Ali. His girlfriend.

78
00:03:07,272 --> 00:03:09,316
Ray, they only...
they only had sex once.

79
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:11,401
Well, when you know, you know. You know?

80
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:12,485
[clears throat]

81
00:03:13,278 --> 00:03:14,278
[Agent Sharpe] Okay.

82
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:16,365
Listen, I know
we're all worried about John. Okay?

83
00:03:16,448 --> 00:03:18,658
And we could just sit back
and wait for a miracle.

84
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:21,661
But does Marie Kondo rest
just because she built an empire?

85
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:22,661
- No.
- No.

86
00:03:22,662 --> 00:03:23,955
No, she tidies up.

87
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:26,124
And that is exactly
what we're gonna continue to do.

88
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,543
We are gonna tidy up the timeline, yeah?

89
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:31,004
Gideon, show them
what we've been working on.

90
00:03:32,089 --> 00:03:34,424
Each point represents
a potential Encore,

91
00:03:34,508 --> 00:03:37,386
which means we can catch them
before they change history.

92
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:39,596
I call her...

93
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,849
The Prognosticator.

94
00:03:49,606 --> 00:03:50,564
Okay.

95
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:54,861
Uh, anyway, there's a Category 5
in 1997, Hong Kong.

96
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:58,931
A mysterious gangster is moving in
on the Triad's territory.

97
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:01,451
Ray, I want you and Zari to QB.

98
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:03,096
Oh, you don't have to tell me
to Queen Bee,

99
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,538
it'll occur naturally.

100
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:07,541
You know what? Hong Kong traffic
is notoriously bad.

101
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:11,962
- So why don't we take my new scooter?
- Whoa!

102
00:04:12,421 --> 00:04:13,672
I call her...

103
00:04:14,423 --> 00:04:16,216
Scoots McGoots.

104
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:17,426
[gasping]

105
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:19,029
- [chuckles] Dude!
- That's so awesome.

106
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:23,140
The scooter, you're all impressed by?

107
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:25,434
[Zari] Oh, my God. I need one.

108
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:26,810
Wanna go for a ride?

109
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:27,978
- Yeah.
- Yes.

110
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:30,605
Ooh! [chuckles]

111
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:32,691
- Away we go.
- [chuckles]

112
00:04:32,774 --> 00:04:33,900
Okay, I'm next.

113
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:34,942
Careful!

114
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,587
- [Ray] Slow down.
- [Zari] All right, speed her up.

115
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:37,611
[Ray] Nate. Nate?

116
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:53,879
Never been to Hong Kong before.

117
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:56,089
So, what's the plan?

118
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:59,468
I had Gideon cook up
the same sedative she dosed John with.

119
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,095
All we have to do is inject the Encore

120
00:05:02,179 --> 00:05:03,739
and bring him back to the ship
for nap time.

121
00:05:03,763 --> 00:05:04,681
One problem.

122
00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:06,118
We're just supposed
to hope the Encore shows up

123
00:05:06,141 --> 00:05:07,141
looking for a cuppa?

124
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:09,644
This is no ordinary tea shop.

125
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:14,107
It's owned by the Triad.

126
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:18,116
[Agent Sharpe]
Nate, how's the perimeter sweep?

127
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:20,822
No sign of a gangster from Hell yet.

128
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:23,283
So it looks like we've arrived

129
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:25,619
right as Great Britain
was getting ready to hand control

130
00:05:25,702 --> 00:05:27,204
of Hong Kong back to China.

131
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:30,707
Oh, that's probably not pertinent
but keep up the research.

132
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,877
- Psst.
- Gary! What are you doing here?

133
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:35,229
John's trying to leave the ship!

134
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:36,630
You have to stop him!

135
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:39,633
[Gideon] You should return
to the MedBay, Mr. Constantine.

136
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:41,593
John, what are you doing out and about?

137
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:43,094
Oh, listen, big man. [coughs]

138
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:45,239
Look, I know you're only
trying to help, all right,

139
00:05:45,263 --> 00:05:48,558
but nobody gets Stage IV
lung cancer this fast.

140
00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:52,312
Some sneaky git with a grudge against me
is bending the rules of magic.

141
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:54,022
Oh, who could hate you that much?

142
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:56,149
[sighs] The list is long.

143
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:59,444
I'm taking the Jumpship
home to narrow it. [coughs]

144
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:02,030
John, no, I cannot
let you leave this ship.

145
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:04,074
You are in need of medical supervision.

146
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:06,868
You can't let me?

147
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:09,746
You forget who I am, old son.

148
00:06:15,252 --> 00:06:16,252
Fine.

149
00:06:17,254 --> 00:06:18,380
But I'm going with you.

150
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:20,757
Hallelujah! [gasps]

151
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:22,509
That was intense.

152
00:06:27,264 --> 00:06:28,348
The Encore's a no-show.

153
00:06:28,515 --> 00:06:29,641
<i>I say we split.</i>

154
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:31,268
[motorbike engine revs]

155
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:05,093
Thirteenth-century armor,

156
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:07,095
Fu Manchu mustache.

157
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:09,597
Guys.

158
00:07:09,973 --> 00:07:11,683
<i>I think I know who the Encore is.</i>

159
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:16,313
<i>It's Genghis freaking Khan.</i>

160
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:29,993
How the hell did Genghis Khan
get to 1997

161
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:31,536
and learn how to ride a motorbike?

162
00:07:31,745 --> 00:07:35,040
Genghis used horses

only to return them to me?

I have only one interest.

Conquest.

171
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:12,035
Surrender the Triad to me

All right? She never dies.
You never go to Hell. Your dad, he...

John, listen to yourself. It's pathetic.

257

No, what is pathetic is that
someone who is so content to rule Hell

258
00:13:31,646 --> 00:13:34,816
because they're too scared
to make a go at a real life.

329
00:16:31,993 --> 00:16:33,452
Nevertheless,

330
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:38,875
give me what I desire
and I will spare his life.

331
00:16:40,835 --> 00:16:42,086
[knocking at door]

332
00:16:44,005 --> 00:16:45,339
John, Nora's here.

333
00:16:45,423 --> 00:16:47,925
[Constantine] All right, I'm coming.

334
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:51,095
[coughing]

335
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,350
Okay, Pippa,

336
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:59,687
can you wish our friend John healthy,
like we discussed?

337
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,440
Yes, but I want something first.

338
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:04,942
Pippa's made a lot of progress

339
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:07,445
but we're still working
on a few challenges.

340
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:08,862
Hey!

341
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:12,283
The Master of the Dark Arts
needs your help!

342
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:14,243
Shut up, four eyes.

343
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:16,495
Now you listen to me, you little squirt.

344
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:20,249
Now you're gonna make that damn wish
because if you don't and I die,

345
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:25,379
then I'm gonna come back and haunt you
every waking hour of your life.

346
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:29,842
Fairy Godmother, I wish your scary
British friend wasn't sick!

347
00:17:30,218 --> 00:17:31,594
There you go. Easy.

348
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:33,428
Okay.

349
00:17:40,478 --> 00:17:44,523
[gasps, wheezes]

350
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:45,733
[sighs]

351
00:17:48,945 --> 00:17:53,866
[coughing violently]

352
00:17:56,369 --> 00:17:57,536
Ah, no matter.

353
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,538
I'll try something else.

354
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:02,208
I wish I was home!

355
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:04,417
Sorry.

356
00:18:05,336 --> 00:18:06,336
Bye, Ray.

357
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:10,883
Bye, Nora.

358
00:18:13,386 --> 00:18:14,929
[exhales]

359
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,683
[Nate] So, when did
you and Charlie, you know...

360
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,353
- It's that obvious?
- Mmm-hmm.

361
00:18:23,062 --> 00:18:24,522
After Heyworld.

362
00:18:24,647 --> 00:18:26,983
Wow. That's nice.

363
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,713
- How was it? She shapeshift?
- That's what you want to talk about?

364
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:32,863
100%, but we don't have to.

365
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:36,450
Look, Charlie's clearly affecting you,

366
00:18:36,534 --> 00:18:38,035
so come on, talk to me.

367
00:18:38,244 --> 00:18:39,745
- It's stupid.
- What?

368
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:42,498
She left without saying goodbye.

369
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:43,874
Mmm.

370
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,167
Yeah, that sucks.

371
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:49,171
But if you were thousands of years old,
wouldn't you be over goodbyes?

372
00:18:49,255 --> 00:18:51,299
The least she could've done is texted.

373
00:18:51,382 --> 00:18:53,175
How hard is it to send a ghost emoji?

374
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,678
[man] Maybe it wasn't about you.

375
00:19:00,308 --> 00:19:01,726
Dum-dum's got a good point.

376
00:19:02,143 --> 00:19:04,979
B, chin up. You are a catch.

377
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:06,939
If there was a female version of you,

378
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:08,816
I would be all over her. Fact.

379
00:19:08,983 --> 00:19:10,568
Like my sister?

380
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:11,569
Absolutely.

381
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,654
But the point is,

382
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:14,947
we don't know why Charlie
didn't say goodbye.

383
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:16,574
So just check your ego...

384
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:18,408
and ask her.

385
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,286
You're right.

386
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,705
- Thanks, Nate.
- My man.

387
00:19:27,877 --> 00:19:29,003
Where's our prisoner?

388
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,759
[groans]

389
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:41,974
Even with Prince Charles' motorcade
route, he'll be heavily guarded.

390
00:19:42,308 --> 00:19:44,036
[Agent Sharpe] <i>Wait.
Prince Charles is the target?</i>

391
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,854
He's here to hand Hong Kong
back to China.

392
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:50,691
What if the Khan wants Prince Charles
to give it to him instead?

393
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,194
An authoritarian power
wants to control Hong Kong.

394
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:54,612
It sounds familiar.

395
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,447
[gasps, groans]

396
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,165
The worst part of my resurrection

397
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:11,045
was finding myself buried
in an impenetrable tomb.

398
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:16,050
It took me 700 years to dig myself out.

399
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:18,803
[groans]

400
00:20:21,222 --> 00:20:26,060
The best part of my resurrection
was the sword I was buried with.

401
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:28,562
[gasps]

402
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:32,483
[whispers] Genghis just killed a cop
with a Hell weapon.

403
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:33,692
Son of a bitch.

404
00:20:33,776 --> 00:20:36,404
Okay, you got what we needed, Charlie.
Get the hell out of there.

405
00:20:38,656 --> 00:20:39,656
Yeung.

406
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:43,744
What is the status of my fleet?

407
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:46,747
Your fleet?

408
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:51,377
The one you are building
to conquer the globe.

409
00:20:52,128 --> 00:20:53,128
Right.

410
00:20:53,838 --> 00:20:54,964
Fleet's great.

411
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,383
In fact, I have to go
check on it right now.

412
00:21:10,104 --> 00:21:12,022
Don't freak out. I can explain.

413
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,193
[Charlie shifts]

414
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:18,195
[sighs] Never mind.

415
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:21,657
[female voice] <i>Clotho...</i>

[groaning]

420
00:21:33,127 --> 00:21:36,213
[gasps] No! Leave me alone!

[both panting]

423
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:45,431
Are you okay?

424
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:46,807
Yeah.

425
00:21:46,891 --> 00:21:47,933
I'm fine.

426
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:06,327
So? What's the verdict? Can you heal me?

427
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:08,162
[chitters]

428
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:11,040
Well, then, screw you.

429
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:12,583
[chitters]

430
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:13,792
Come with me.

431
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:14,876
He didn't mean that.

432
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:16,212
[coughing] Yeah, I did.

433
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:23,177
I wish you would let us
take you to the oncologist.

434
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,346
Raymond, how many times
do I have to tell you,

435
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:28,891
this is a disease caused by magic
and only magic can fix it.

436
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:33,312
"How to add years to your life"?
Ah, that should do it.

437
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:36,857
Although the ingredient list
is a little unusual.

438
00:22:36,941 --> 00:22:38,817
We'll need a medieval knight.

439
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:42,488
I was once knighted
Sir Raymond of the Palms.

440
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:45,533
Great. Gary, grab a knife.

441
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:49,119
We're gonna perform a little
back-alley surgery on the big man.

442
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:51,288
Uh, what kind of surgery?

443
00:22:51,372 --> 00:22:53,415
Well, first off, are you uncircumcised?

444
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:55,751
- I... I...
- Well, I'll take that as a yes.

445
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,378
- Gary, the knife.
- No!

446
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:02,132
We tried Nora, we tried the Púca.

447
00:23:04,635 --> 00:23:06,345
What if there isn't a cure?

448
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:10,015
Isn't there anyone you...
that you need to say goodbye to?

449
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:12,851
What about a bucket list?

450
00:23:12,935 --> 00:23:15,938
[wheezing]

451
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:16,939
[coughs]

452
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,524
Goodbyes are for saps

453
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:21,026
and bucket lists
are for mealy-mouthed cowards

454
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,154
who don't have the courage
to <i>carpe</i> the bloody <i>diem.</i>

455
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:26,031
I have a bucket list.

456
00:23:26,115 --> 00:23:28,450
Thank you for proving my point, Raymond.

457
00:23:29,702 --> 00:23:32,204
Stop being so mean.
We're trying to help you.

458
00:23:32,288 --> 00:23:33,622
- Help me?
- Yes.

459
00:23:33,706 --> 00:23:35,791
Captain America and the village idiot?

460
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:37,042
Well, I don't need your help.

461
00:23:37,126 --> 00:23:39,086
I take care of myself. I always have.

462
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,213
What, you think
I'm gonna let Astra beat me?

463
00:23:41,297 --> 00:23:43,507
I will fight and I will scheme

464
00:23:43,591 --> 00:23:46,093
and I will make a deal
with the archangel himself.

465
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,554
You hear that, Gabriel, eh?

466
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:50,222
Come and get me.

467
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:52,891
Have I got an offer for you.

468
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:00,858
Looks like he's not coming.

469
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:03,777
I'll think of something. I always do.

470
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:05,946
Now piss off,
I've had enough of the pair of you.

471
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:07,448
[yells] Go on, piss off!

472
00:24:09,617 --> 00:24:11,035
[wheezes]

473
00:24:16,332 --> 00:24:17,248
Hello.

474
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:18,292
Who the hell are you?

475
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,044
I am the last queen of France.

476
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:23,255
Right. Just when I thought this ship
couldn't get more barmy.

477
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:25,965
[sighs]

478
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:29,011
[Behrad] Looking for a Time Courier?

479
00:24:32,848 --> 00:24:35,392
Why are you in such a hurry
to leave... again?

480
00:24:35,476 --> 00:24:37,811
You know me.
Always looking for the next party.

481
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:39,647
Usually I would buy that...

482
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:42,399
but you just almost walked into a truck.

483
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:43,942
Something has you spooked.

484
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:46,320
Is whatever's going on
the reason why you left?

485
00:24:46,445 --> 00:24:47,363
[sighs] Here we go.

486
00:24:47,364 --> 00:24:48,656
Look, I'll admit it.

487
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:49,865
I liked you.

488
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:53,327
I was hurt when you left

489
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:56,121
and I've felt weird
ever since you returned.

490
00:24:56,205 --> 00:24:57,873
Now, can you be honest with me?

491
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:00,083
Honestly...

492
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:02,753
you are starting to piss me off.

493
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,005
We had sex and it was mediocre.

494
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:06,089
Get over it.

495
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:07,131
[gasps]

496
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:10,969
Wow. Okay, I'm gonna ignore that.

497
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:13,889
If you don't want to talk, fine.

498
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:16,850
But we're about to go up
against Genghis Khan.

499
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:18,143
Don't leave now.

500
00:25:20,938 --> 00:25:22,189
Just give me the Courier.

501
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:24,024
[sighs]

502
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:31,115
- Bye, Charlie.
- [sighs]

503
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:36,495
Mediocre is not bad.

504
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:41,333
Charlie's gone?

505
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:43,502
- How could you let her leave?
- I didn't.

506
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:44,795
It was her choice.

507
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,631
Okay. Hey, how about we focus
on Genghis Khan?

508
00:25:47,715 --> 00:25:48,631
You're right.

509
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:51,051
We need to stop him from
attacking Prince Charles' motorcade.

510
00:25:51,135 --> 00:25:55,431
But He is on his way to a ceremony
ending 156 years of colonial rule, so...

511
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:57,766
Have you been researching history?

512
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,727
Oh, sorry. That's your thing, right?

513
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,520
- No. But...
- Okay.

514
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,605
- Okay, okay. Moving on, right?
- Hmm?

515
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:06,191
Turns out the person
Charlie impersonated is an engineer.

516
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:07,419
There's a shipment coming in tonight.

517
00:26:07,443 --> 00:26:09,671
I'll bet you that's the fleet
Genghis uses for his attack.

518
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:10,821
What kind of fleet?

519
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:13,615
Whatever it is, it's the next step
of modern warfare.

520
00:26:14,158 --> 00:26:16,038
I'll go to the docks,
I'll try to figure it out.

521
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:17,161
[Agent Sharpe] Okay.

522
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:19,389
Zari and I will monitor
the airspace above the motorcade

523
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:20,413
and you'll be on the street.

524
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:22,684
I know it's a lot of ground to cover.
If Charlie was here...

525
00:26:22,708 --> 00:26:24,752
I get it. I'm on my own.

526
00:26:29,465 --> 00:26:34,094
[Bulldog] I can't believe you stooped
to trying to make a deal with an angel.

527
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:40,517
Gabriel would have turned you
into his slave.

528
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:42,561
Well, at least I'd be alive.

529
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:45,481
[scoffs] There are worse fates
than death.

530
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:47,607
Oi.

531
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:52,321
I will shove you where the sun
don't shine just to shut you up.

532
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:54,323
[scoffs] You'd probably enjoy that.

533
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:59,369
Hell of a way to spend
your last nights on Earth, though,

534
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:01,038
you arrogant bastard.

535
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:03,540
Especially when you could be

536
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:06,335
with two of the only friends
you have left.

537
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:12,716
Yeah. Nice one.

538
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:25,312
I... I just feel so helpless, you know?

539
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:27,815
Me, too, Gary.

540
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:29,942
If he has to go, I just...

541
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:31,944
I want him to be at peace.

542
00:27:32,194 --> 00:27:33,821
Well, that's not his style.

543
00:27:33,904 --> 00:27:35,656
John's gonna go out the way he lived.

544
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:37,783
[Constantine] Like a bloody wanker, eh?

545
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:41,161
You know, it occurs to me

546
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:43,831
that I might owe you two
a bit of an apology.

547
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:45,582
We accept.

548
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:46,792
Okay. [coughs]

549
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,293
Go on, sit down.

550
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:50,017
All right.
Okay, you're hurting me. Go on.

551
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:52,214
Sit down. Stop bloody fussing, will you?

552
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:54,341
[coughing]

553
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,389
You know, I can't remember the last time
this room was used as an actual kitchen.

554
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:02,599
Well, there's roast in the oven.

555
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:05,561
- It'll be ready soon.
- Mmm. [coughs]

556
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:11,441
Did I ever tell you both

557
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:15,696
about the time I met
the ghost of Winston Churchill?

558

[Agent Sharpe]
<i>Behrad, what's your status?</i>

560
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:24,288
It's complete gridlock.

00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:26,248
[sighs] No one's getting through
on the ground.

Oh, no.

<i>Whatever there was,
there was a lot of 'em.</i>

Nate, get downtown and help Behrad.

Look who it is.

I'm sorry I couldn't protect you,
Prince Charles.

It's not your fault.

But my friends call me Charlie.

Apprehend this imposter.

Show your true form or I end him.

Looks like your luck has run out,

Where is the Prince?

Sorry, Gengi.

[rock music playing]

Your shapeshifting friend

said you need to tell your team
that I'm here.

And I told her, I'm on my beer break.

Now, shut up, princess, and listen.

[Genghis] I've never met

Come again, mate?

Your power will serve my reign well.

Join me, as I build a new empire
that will span the globe.

Look, I'm flattered,

614
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:18,563
but I've had power of immortals
and gods alike.

Trust me, that wouldn't end well

Wait.

Oh. What a shame.

No.

Is that Genghis' toothpick?

00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,322
Yeah, you want it?

- Ugh, no, it's disgusting.

to find the words, all right?

That's offensive, but correct.

Which one are you?

647

I'm super-confused,
but what do you spin?

but I used to spin people's futures.

There was a loom, but I
destroyed it thousands of years ago.

653
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:41,998
No one should have that kind of power.

654
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:44,501
I think people should just decide
their own destinies.

655
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:46,086
Why didn't you just tell us?

656
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:49,673
Look, I've been keeping this secret for
my entire bloody existence. All right?

657
00:34:50,173 --> 00:34:51,508
I've never told anyone.

658
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:55,387
Can we see your OG form?

659
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,513
Absolutely not.

660
00:34:57,138 --> 00:34:58,431
Is it 'cause you're old?

661
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:00,159
It's because your eyes will explode,
all right?

662
00:35:00,183 --> 00:35:02,119
And your ears, too,
if you could hear my original voice.

663
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:03,228
Why are you running?

664
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:06,648
My sisters are coming after me.

665
00:35:06,731 --> 00:35:08,571
They have been
ever since I destroyed our loom.

666
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:11,194
Wait, you've been running
for thousands of years?

667
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:14,322
Yes. And I've always stayed
one step ahead.

668
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:15,406
[exhales]

669
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:17,760
I scattered the loom pieces
across the multi-verse,

670
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:19,494
which took away my sisters' powers.

671
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:22,205
But now that we're all in one universe,

672
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:25,000
thanks to Sara
and her merry band of Paragons,

673
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:27,002
the Loom pieces are back on one plane.

674
00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:30,297
And now it's only a matter of time
until my sisters find me.

675
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:32,090
And when they do?

676
00:35:32,257 --> 00:35:35,051
They'll kill me
and anyone that I'm with.

677
00:35:36,594 --> 00:35:38,179
Which is why I left.

678
00:35:40,223 --> 00:35:43,310
And it's why I'm out that door now
that we're done playing "Ask a Fate."

679
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:47,063
Stop running.

680
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:48,732
We got your back.

681
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:54,279
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.

682
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:57,324
My sisters are no joke.

683
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,284
Well, we're the Legends.

684
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:00,493
[Nate] Yeah.

685
00:36:00,618 --> 00:36:03,204
We can take out a couple old ladies.

686
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:07,375
[scooter clatters]

687
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:14,299
What is with all these damn scooters?
They're a menace!

688
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:18,136
Oh. Hey, guys. What'd I miss?

689
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,781
- [all talking at once]
- Well, I lost my scooter at first.

690
00:36:20,805 --> 00:36:23,016
But the good news is,
don't worry about it, I found it.

691
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:29,814
John, this wine is delicious.

692
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:31,483
And nutritious.

693
00:36:31,816 --> 00:36:35,195
Well, there's no point
in saving the good stuff, eh?

694
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:36,905
I'm never gonna drink with you again.

695
00:36:36,988 --> 00:36:39,240
Come on, mate. Stiff upper lip, eh?

696
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:41,076
I'm gonna miss you so much, you know?

697
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,952
Nothing can make me feel better.

698
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:44,305
Oh, bollocks, all right. [coughs]

699
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:45,329
[sighs] Look.

700
00:36:45,747 --> 00:36:48,541
I didn't want you
to see my will until I died, but...

701
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:52,754
Raymond, if you'd do the honors.

702
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:53,880
Uh, sure.

703
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:55,925
[clears throat, scoffs]

704
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:58,635
You're giving this house to Gary?

705
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,556
[sobbing]

706
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:06,768
Bloody hell. That was supposed
to make you happy, not insufferable.

707
00:37:06,851 --> 00:37:09,145
I promise to take great care
of this place.

708
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:12,232
You know, I'll feed the Hell hounds,
I'll vacuum...

709
00:37:12,315 --> 00:37:16,444
Why don't we talk about what you had
on your bucket list, eh, Ray?

710
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:18,655
- Really?
- Yeah.

711
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:20,407
Give me something meaningful, ey.

712
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:24,869
Well, uh, eventually...

713
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:29,374
I plan on asking Nora to marry me.

714
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:33,294
Can I be your flower boy?

715
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:38,550
Oh. That's very sweet, Gary.
Odd, but very sweet.

716
00:37:38,633 --> 00:37:41,010
Why haven't you asked her yet, big man?

717
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:44,889
I've been engaged twice before.

718
00:37:45,723 --> 00:37:48,643
Both times didn't end as I had hoped.

719
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:50,562
You know, life, it is...

720
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:53,815
too short to dilly-dally, Raymond.

721
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,528
You can take that from a man
who has nothing but regrets.

722
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:01,906
So, if you love that witch...

723
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:05,201
you bloody well marry her, all right?

724
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,956
[coughing]

725
00:38:10,248 --> 00:38:12,459
No, no, no, I'm all right.
I'm all right. [sniffs]

726
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:13,918
Now, how about a toast, ey?

727
00:38:15,837 --> 00:38:17,088
Okay.

728
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:18,839
No, no.

729
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,886
Of all the ways that I thought I'd go...

730
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:28,224
decapitated by a demon,
eviscerated by an elemental...

731
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:31,728
I wouldn't have picked
being at home with my mates.

732
00:38:32,854 --> 00:38:34,355
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

733
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:36,356
Cheers.

734
00:38:38,776 --> 00:38:39,819

You know, I just wish
I had more time with you lovely idiots.

739
00:38:59,672 --> 00:39:02,383
Well, you're not dead yet, John.

740
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,928
No, but I will be momentarily.

00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:17,982
he always goes out
on his own terms. [groans]

00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:19,775
John?

744
00:39:25,156 --> 00:39:26,950
Couldn't wait to see me, John.

745
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:30,453
Sixty seconds and you're dead.

746
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:34,082
Poison does that.

747
00:39:38,044 --> 00:39:41,047
It's the same poison
your mother used to kill herself.

748
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:44,634
You won't change my mind.

749
00:39:45,343 --> 00:39:46,761
I'm not trying to.

750
00:39:48,346 --> 00:39:50,014
I just want you to know that

751
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:53,309
even though you gave up on her,

752
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:56,604
your mom never gave up on you.

Aye, it was.
