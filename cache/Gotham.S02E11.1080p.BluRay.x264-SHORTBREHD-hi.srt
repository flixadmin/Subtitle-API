00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,331
Galavan is innocent
until proven otherwise.

164
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:29,959
If Jim isn't dirty,
I need to hear that from him.

165
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:32,169
Where is he? Do you know where he is?

166
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,421
No.

167
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,172
Do you know how long
he's been working with Penguin?

168
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,341
He's not working with Penguin.

169
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:40,219
And he's not dirty.
And I resent being questioned like this.

170
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:44,515
Stop it. You're his girlfriend. You know
I have to ask you these questions.

171
00:12:44,682 --> 00:12:47,852
I'm going to ask you again
if you know where he is, because if you do

172
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:50,688
and you don't tell me, that makes you
an accomplice after the fact.

173
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:52,481
I don't know where he is.

174
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:56,527
I don't like this any more than you do.
Jim is like a son to me.

175
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,239
A father would have shown more faith.

176
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:03,534
Are you sure you know Jim
as well as you think you do?

180

Doesn't matter.

Anything.

No.

187
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:05,179
I did once. Oh, my gosh, it was magical.

No, they can.
They can see your brainwaves.

192
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,742
They have a form of sonar.

193
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:29,537
So they can see inside you
and detect tumors, that sort of thing.

194
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,958
But they can't read minds.

195
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:37,461

My father and I climbed an oak tree
and ate oranges.

487
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:44,477
You're under arrest.

488
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:50,691
Oh, God. You scared me, man.
I thought you were gonna shoot me.

(GROANING)

490
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:54,487
Cuff yourself.

491
00:35:56,614 --> 00:36:01,285
Well, thank goodness
for simple men of principle

492
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:04,914
who believe in the system.

493
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,916
This time, you'll get the chair.

494
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:12,296
You want to make a bet? (CHUCKLES)

495
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:18,052
Maybe you're right.

496
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:20,096
Steady now, Jim. I was just talking big.

497
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:23,891
As they say, you got me fair and square.

498
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:27,019
Had you that way the last time.
You turned it around.

499
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:32,733
Jim! Back up. I got him.

500
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:34,443
Back up, I said!

501
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:38,906
And you! On your knees!

502
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:41,784
I have a warrant to search these premises.

503
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:46,914
Jim, now, you put your gun on the ground
and put your hands on top of your head.

504
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:49,000
- What?
- You heard me. You're still a fugitive.

505
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:50,293
Captain, I've done nothing wrong.

506
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:53,671
I want to believe you, Jim.
So we're gonna do this by the book.

507
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,800
Put your gun on the ground
and let's handle this the right way.

508
00:37:00,011 --> 00:37:01,137
You're making a mistake.

509
00:37:07,143 --> 00:37:08,144
MAN: Argh!

510
00:37:10,146 --> 00:37:13,316

Nobody shoot! We are all friends here.

00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:14,609
Like hell, we are.

512
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:15,818
I apologize for that.

513
00:37:16,527 --> 00:37:19,697
But there we are. Done now.
They're still alive. That's something.

514
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:23,242
Look forward now, Jim. What now?

515
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:25,661
I will kill you to get to him
if I have to.

516
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:32,001
Forget that this man
sicced Barbara Kean on you.

517
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:35,755
Forget that he nearly
killed the mother of your child.

518

<i>Forget revenge. Think of the greater good.
Think of Gotham.</i>

519
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:45,681
He has the courts in his pocket
and billions of dollars at his command.

520
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:50,269
Are you 100% sure that he won't beat this
and walk free again?

521
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:53,648
Are you sure, Jim? Think of Gotham.

But think fast.

524
00:38:01,364 --> 00:38:02,490
I do believe, Master Bruce,

525
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:06,369
this falls very firmly into the category
of "I told you so."

526
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:08,537
I told him so, too, Alfred.

527
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:09,872
Yes, well, thank you both for your help.

528
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:11,832
But I had a perfectly feasible
escape plan.

You're a man of conscience, Jim.
You'll regret this.

531
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:30,351
I have many regrets.
This won't be top of the list.

532
00:38:41,237 --> 00:38:44,448
Oh, well. Here we are.

533
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:51,455
Shame. It's gonna be a beautiful morning.
