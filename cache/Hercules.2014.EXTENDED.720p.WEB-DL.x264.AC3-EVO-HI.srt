- You're Hercules.
- That's right.

My name is Arius. I know
all your Labors by heart.

162
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:44,624
You killed the giant
Geryon with a single blow,

163
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:47,593
- cleaned the Augean stables in one night.
- Hercules is probably tired.

164
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,295
And the Labor of the Hide,
and the Labor of the Mares.

Atalanta of Scythia.
Iolaus of Athens.

- And Amphiaraus of Argos.
- Amphiaraus?

The famed seer of Argos.

205
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,101
It is said you have
glimpsed your own death,

206
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:20,773
so you fight each battle knowing
that it is not yet your time to die.

What else can you tell of the future?

Only what the gods see fit to reveal.

209

A shame. It would have been a great

COTYS: When the kings of
yesteryear built this citadel,

218
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:06,686
it was intended as the
high seat of all Thrace.

219
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:11,890
- But now Thrace is divided.
- This war has depleted our forces.

220

We're left with nothing but farmers
and merchants to replenish our army.

221
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,996
It takes every one of
us to resist Rhesus.

222
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:21,867
People think that he cannot be
killed by an ordinary mortal.

223

Only by a god.

224
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,638
Rhesus is a sorcerer.

<i>His magic words confuse men,
bend them to his will.</i>

you what misery Rhesus has brought us.

230

Every week, more refugees
arrive seeking my protection,

231
00:18:56,301 --> 00:19:00,973
most of them covered in blood,
crippled or burnt by Rhesus' men.

232
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:06,144
I feared nothing could ever be
good again, till you arrived.

233

I'm just a mercenary
fighting for gold.

234

How we view ourselves
is of little consequence.

How others perceive us is important.

236
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:21,892
And your name, like it or
not, is a rallying cry.

237
00:19:27,632 --> 00:19:31,904
I have seen too much reality to trust
in legends, and I am not alone.

00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,972
Nobody has any faith anymore.

They need someone to look up to.

Cotys or his daughter?

244
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:08,174
All the gold on Earth is not as
convincing as a pair of breasts.

245
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:10,509
Maybe, but gold never ages.

246
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,778
Which is why I got them
to double our price.

Double your weight in gold?
(LAUGHS) Well done.

- If it be the will of Zeus.

Which title sounds more terrifying to
our enemies? "Hercules: Savior of Thrace"

When a shield wall is strong,

What's wrong with him?

319
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,449
Tydeus is my most loyal warrior.

320
00:25:54,186 --> 00:26:00,723
He was born in war. When I found
him, he was more animal than human.

321
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:09,265
He never speaks of what he saw.
He never speaks at all.

322
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,935
But he relives it every night.

323

Come. Let's find your mother.

- No hero is greater than Hercules.

326
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:33,394
I know all your Labors. Like the Cretan
Bull, you wrestled it for seven days

327
00:26:33,494 --> 00:26:35,627
- and seven nights.
- Uh, that's a bit exaggerated.

328
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:39,464
- And struck it 49 times with your club.
- Maybe not quite that many.

329
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:43,835
Until it fell dead and Crete was saved.
It's my favorite Labor.

330
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:49,608
Also Queen Hippolyta's Belt, with its
buxom Amazons and exciting bondage.

- Why are you in the hospice?
- My mother saves people's lives.

337
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:16,134
Many of our physicians
were killed during battle.

338
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:20,836
So, out of necessity, I taught
myself the art of healing.

339
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:25,877
If I could be like you, I would protect all
of Thrace and no one would ever get hurt.

I was going to give
this to someone else,

00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,128
but I never got the chance.

344
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:47,966
Only a hero may wear this.

345
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:51,901
But to become a hero,
you must grow strong.

Is this the Nemean Lion's tooth?

If you fall in the service of a just
cause, your souls will go to Elysium,

where they will dwell forever
among the shades of heroes,

- Odysseus!

And the great Achilles.

355
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:30,273
Or if you're lucky, you'll go to Hades,
where all the fun people are.

Iolaus. Your place is beside
Lord Cotys, where it's safe.

and I really feel I'm ready to fight.

Do you have any children?

477
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:21,156
- Do they live in Athens?
- Thank you for your care.

478

The sedative will help you rest.

479
00:45:05,802 --> 00:45:10,573
How could you do such a terrible thing?
By law, I should execute you,

480
00:45:10,673 --> 00:45:14,044
but I believe a more fitting
punishment would be to let you live.

481
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:17,814
So you can walk the earth in
torment, haunted by the knowledge

482
00:45:17,914 --> 00:45:23,184
that you alone are responsible for
the death of your loved ones.

483

484

the three-headed beast of Hades?

don't share with others.

There's a word for that. Madness.

498
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,417
When we were driven from Athens,
I consulted the Oracle of Delphi...

499
00:47:47,517 --> 00:47:50,634
on your behalf. Do you
remember her prophecy?

500
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:54,672
"Hercules must finish the Labor
that remains unfinished."

501
00:47:54,772 --> 00:47:57,240
And what is that, Hercules?

502
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:01,612
Confront the beast that haunts you.
Only then will you find peace.

503
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,837
I speak from experience. No matter how
far you run, no matter how fast you go,

504
00:48:04,937 --> 00:48:10,386
the beast will follow.
Man cannot escape his fate.

505
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:28,137
Room for one more in your company?

506
00:48:28,938 --> 00:48:32,743
It'd be a pleasure having female
companionship for a change.

507
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:35,279
Atalanta doesn't quite count.
No offense.

508
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:38,682
If only your manhood was
as long as your tongue.

509
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:41,716
Both can satisfy in different ways.

510
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:48,592
You're a famed storyteller, Iolaus.
Grace me with a story.

511
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:51,595
Any particular subject, My Lady?

512
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:55,930
Murder, of a woman
and her three children.

513
00:48:57,567 --> 00:49:00,738
Is it true? Did Hercules
slaughter his own family?

514
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:03,741
- Who said so?
- Oh, soldiers talk.

515
00:49:03,841 --> 00:49:06,743
They say if Hercules
ever returns to Athens,

516
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:09,711
King Eurystheus will
have him executed.

517
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:17,121
Hercules had completed his Labors
and returned home. But Hera...

518
00:49:17,221 --> 00:49:20,024
No myths. I want the truth.

519
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:22,590
No one knows the truth.

520
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:24,819
Not for sure.

521
00:49:24,919 --> 00:49:29,733
We found Hercules alone. His wife,
Megara and the children, dead.

522
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:33,969
- He remembers nothing.
- Do you believe he is innocent?

523
00:49:34,752 --> 00:49:39,543
We grew up together, both orphans,
trying to survive in the streets of Athens.

524
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:44,014
We found a home in the army.
Looked out for each other.

525
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:48,284
Hercules' strength set him apart.

526
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:52,322
Kings of Athens started to send him
on all the most dangerous missions.

527
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:55,993
- The Twelve Labors.
- And he took me with him.

528
00:49:56,093 --> 00:50:00,929
To fight by his side. And with
each mission, our numbers grew.

529
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:05,268
Scythia, the Amazon kingdom where
the royal family had been assassinated.

530
00:50:05,368 --> 00:50:08,105
My family was gone.
Everyone was gone.

531
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:10,974
Hercules helped me
avenge their murder.

532
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:13,610
He became my brother-in-arms.

533
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:19,317
Thebes, the city of corpses,
where we found a single child,

534
00:50:19,417 --> 00:50:21,585
still alive.

535
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:27,355
Hercules took Tydeus in when everyone
else saw nothing but a wild animal.

536
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:31,228
You know how a rumor spreads.
How a legend grows.

537
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,529
Hercules' deeds were so incredible,

538
00:50:33,629 --> 00:50:37,267
they could not possibly have
been performed by a mere mortal.

539
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,478
So we played along.

540
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:44,108
We encourage people to think Hercules
was the son of Zeus. It's good.

Scares the enemy. Iolaus helps.

You're very loyal friends.
You're avoiding my question.

544
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,957
Hercules is a warrior. And there
is something that haunts warriors.

545
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:05,162
It can cloud their minds.
We call it the Blood Rage.

546
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:07,831
This rage afflicted Hercules.

547
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:10,834
He made me vow to keep
the world away from him.

548
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:13,837
To make sure that he would
never harm innocents again.

549
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:17,474
And that, My Lady, is the truth.

whatever the truth,

553
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:26,216
the death of his loved
ones haunts Hercules.

554
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:29,384
Only the gods can help him,

555
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,253
if he listens.

556
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:41,464
Come! Gather around,
soldiers of Thrace, and behold,

557
00:51:41,564 --> 00:51:44,902
when Hercules gives an order,
even the gods listen.

558

Zeus' master ironsmith,
using the forges of your own citadel,

so, too, will you be
hewn into warriors.

How does that work, exactly?

Well, much as birds take flight, so,
too, are these shields lighter than air.

00:52:30,097 --> 00:52:32,580
It's in the fibers. Here.
