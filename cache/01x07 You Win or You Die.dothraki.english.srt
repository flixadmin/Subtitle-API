1
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:50,480
The stallion who mounts
the world has no need for iron chairs.

2
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,190
According to the prophecy...

3
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,690
...the stallion will ride
to the ends of the earth.

4
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,400
The earth ends at the black salt sea.

5
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,450
No horse can cross the poison water.

6
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,660
The earth does not end at the sea...

7
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,120
...there are many dirts beyond the sea.

8
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,540
The dirt where I was born.

9
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,170
Not dirts. Lands.

10
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:14,590
Lands, yes...

11
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,510
There are thousands of ships
in the free cities.

12
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,550
Wooden horses that fly across the sea...

13
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,390
Let's speak no more of wooden horses
and iron chairs.

14
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,180
It's not a chair. It's a...

15
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,560
...throne.

16
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,150
Throne.

17
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:39,530
A chair for a King to sit upon,

18
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,240
or...

19
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,030
...a Queen.

20
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,920
A King does not need a chair to sit upon.

21
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,840
He only needs a horse.

22
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,950
Sweet reds...

23
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:54,700
I have sweet reds from Lys,
Volantis and the Arbor!

24
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,540
Tyroshi pear brandy! Andalish sours!

25
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,000
I have them! I have them!

26
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,630
A taste for the Khaleesi?

27
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,630
I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady.

28
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,510
One taste and you'll
name your first child after me.

29
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,900
Rakharo.

30
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,020
Put down that cask.

31
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,210
Moon of my life.

32
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,300
Are you hurt?

33
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,730
Jorah the Andal,

34
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:47,600
I heard what you did.

35
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:51,270
Choose any horse you wish, it is yours.

36
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:59,450
I make this gift to you.

37
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:09,670
And to my son,
the stallion who will mount the world,

38
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:13,250
I will also pledge a gift.

39
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:17,550
I will give him the iron chair...

40
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,680
...that his mother's father sat upon.

41
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,520
I will give him Seven Kingdoms.

42
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:31,650
I, Drogo, will do this.

43
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:35,530
I will take my Khalasar west
to where the world ends...

44
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:41,120
...and ride wooden horses
across the black salt water...

45
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,740
...as no Khal has done before.

46
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:51,460
I will kill the men in iron suits...

47
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:54,590
...and tear down their stone houses.

48
00:50:57,010 --> 00:51:00,760
I will rape their women...

49
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:03,390
...take their children as slaves...

50
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:06,640
...and bring their broken gods
back to Vaes Dothrak.

51
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,610
This, I vow...

52
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:15,650
...I, Drogo, son of Bharbo.

53
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:22,030
I swear before the Mother of Mountains...

54
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,990
...as the stars look down in witness.

55
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:28,620
As the stars look down in witness.
