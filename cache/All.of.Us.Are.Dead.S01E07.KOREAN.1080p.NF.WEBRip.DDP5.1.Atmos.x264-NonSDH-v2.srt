1
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,396
<i>Jae-jun,</i>
<i>are you still at the base?</i>

2
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:24,065
-<i>You're not going anywhere, right?</i>
-Put on your gas masks!

3
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,818
I won't go there, Mom. Don't worry, okay?

4
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:29,863
<i>They said on TV that all</i>
<i>the soldiers were being sent there.</i>

5
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:31,072
<i>That must include you too.</i>

6
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,283
Why would it? I'm almost discharged.

7
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,285
When you're about to be discharged,

8
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,287
they don't have you stand guard
or even train.

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,621
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

10
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,957
<i>Then why did they cancel your last leave?</i>

11
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,543
<i>Do you have any idea how worried I am?</i>

12
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,420
-<i>You didn't even call--</i>
-Mom.

13
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:46,755
<i>Yes? What?</i>

14
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:47,839
I gotta go.

15
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:50,884
<i>Did you go somewhere else</i>
<i>instead of coming home?</i>

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,635
<i>Where are you going?</i>

17
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,512
To play soccer. Bye, Mom.

18
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,431
<i>Jae-jun!</i>

19
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:13,323
<i>What are you doing</i>
<i>playing soccer? What if you get hurt?</i>

20
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:20,538
I mean, what do you want me
to do all day? Hmm?

21
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,332
I'm tired of playing video games.

22
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,626
<i>All you did before</i>
<i>was play video games.</i>

23
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,841
-Status.
-Clear.

24
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,134
Clear.

25
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,427
Report.

26
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,180
<i>Control, this is Shadow Gamma.</i>

27
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,682
<i>We cleared all the infected</i>
<i>on the ground floor.</i>

28
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,059
<i>No survivors founded.</i>

29
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,728
<i>We're moving to the third floor.</i>

30
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,736
<i>I can tell you're lying.</i>
<i>You're not playing soccer, are you?</i>

31
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,363
Promise, I am.

32
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,965
Come out. You're safe.

33
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,467
We're saved! Come out.

34
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,593
-Hurry.
-Thank you.

35
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,178
-Slowly. Walk. Slowly.
-Thank you.

36
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,389
Walk in a single file.
It's safe out there.

37
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,525
<i>Zone three secured.</i>

38
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,651
<i>Two infected sighted.</i>

39
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,779
<i>Copy. Take them down.</i>

40
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,857
<i>Just please don't go</i>
<i>anywhere that's too dangerous.</i>

41
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,984
<i>Okay? For me?</i>

42
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,444
<i>I love you, son.</i>

43
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,488
<i>You know that, right?</i>

44
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,740
I love you too, Mom.

45
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,660
I'll see you later, okay?
When I'm discharged.

46
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,995
<i>Jae-jun.</i>

47
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,414
<i>Get back safely.</i>

48
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,833
<i>Make sure to call me later.</i>

49
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,627
<i>I'll be waiting, okay?</i>

50
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:29,978
<i>There's hope.</i>

51
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,022
A small number of white blood cells
were detected in the blood.

52
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,567
Even after full transformation,
the white blood cells remained,

53
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,987
and they were fighting like warriors.

54
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,115
If I raise the body temperature,
I can activate these cells.

55
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,575
Twenty-nine degrees now.

56
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,912
<i>In case blood isn't flowing,</i>

57
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,332
<i>I'll raise the temperature</i>
<i>both internally and externally.</i>

58
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,001
You guys can leave a message
as well if you want to.

59
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,214
I don't really have anything to say.

60
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,260
You?

61
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,228
We trust you.

62
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,357
You can untie it now.

63
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,530
Su-hyeok, I don't know
why you're doing this.

64
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,116
Because the others are really scared.

65
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:53,454
And you're not scared?

66
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:55,832
Mm-mm.

67
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,835
Why?

68
00:06:58,918 --> 00:06:59,836
Because…

69
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,546
I'm just not.

70
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,595
You know how I said
I wanted to bite you earlier?

71
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,930
It's okay.

72
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:12,682
It's in the past now.

73
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,647
It felt like I was dreaming.

74
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,444
You were just giving off
such a beautiful scent.

75
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,696
What kind of scent?

76
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,576
I'm not sure.

77
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,079
It was something
that I had never smelled before.

78
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,293
All I could think about was eating you.

79
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,922
How much I wanted to bite you.

80
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,301
Bite you and eat you.

81
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,264
I only thought…

82
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,813
Then I heard your voice suddenly saying…

83
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:04,859
<i>Nam-ra.</i>

84
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,240
It was your voice that woke me up.

85
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,078
You know you never called me by my name.

86
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,748
It was always "Hey," or "Prez."

87
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,547
It was the first time you said my name.

88
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,433
I know.

89
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,812
I was afraid you'd know…

90
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,440
if I said your name.

91
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,817
What?

92
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,030
That I like you.

93
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,704
I don't get good grades,

94
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,333
and I used to hang out
with bullies before.

95
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,753
But you, you're a perfect student.

96
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,838
You get good grades.

97
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,469
And you're so pretty.

98
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:32,989
Su-hyeok.

99
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,950
I like you.

100
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,859
I'm glad…

101
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,238
to know before I die.

102
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,680
NIGHT DUTY ROOM

103
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,560
Hello, sir.

104
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,439
Shit. You scared me.

105
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,483
You're…

106
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,278
You're Seon-yeong, right?

107
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,613
Eun-ji.

108
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,032
Right. Eun-ji, right.

109
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,414
Are you all right?

110
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,790
I am.

111
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,627
Except that I'm starving.

112
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,422
It's driving me crazy.

113
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,466
What?

114
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:40,968
Hey.

115
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,219
Hey.

116
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,905
Are… are you all right?

117
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,532
You were bitten?

118
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:05,659
Yeah.

119
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,244
I was.

120
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,173
Okay.

121
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,551
Wow, you must have been so hungry.

122
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,553
Eun-ji.

123
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,307
Jeez. That must have hurt a lot.

124
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:29,975
Huh?

125
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,354
Guess you should go to the infirmary!

126
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:48,494
Remember what you said
when I said I was an outcast?

127
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,874
"Don't tell me about it.

128
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,377
Go tell your homeroom teacher."

129
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,967
'Cause you didn't want them
to have a committee.

130
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,012
"You're an outcast
because you're so dense."

131
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,766
Do I still seem dense?

132
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,770
Okay, I get it. So get out.

133
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,316
Get out. Please, get out.

134
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:25,781
Stay there.

135
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,324
Stay back.

136
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,039
Get out.

137
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,250
Get out.

138
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,034
What?

139
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,785
I heard something strange.

140
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,308
-What if she's finally starting to turn?
-Huh?

141
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,517
What if half-bies don't turn?

142
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,977
Oh, my gosh.

143
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,312
My bad.

144
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,524
I hear it.

145
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,903
-What?
-What do you hear?

146
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,950
I think someone is puking.

147
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,126
It stopped.

148
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:06,840
What stopped?

149
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,843
The sound of puking.

150
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,238
Stop it. You're scaring me.

151
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,866
Don't you hear it?

152
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,994
I'm not hearing anything.

153
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,084
What?

154
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,836
What?

155
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,170
Are you scared?

156
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,213
Stop that.

157
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,841
It's just…

158
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,843
…you're the one breathing the loudest.

159
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,899
I hate this fucking school.

160
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,821
Do you hear that?

161
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,657
All I hear is that zombie.

162
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,735
What?

163
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,544
We should go. It's weird here.

164
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,421
We can't just leave.

165
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,882
There are zombies out there.

166
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,260
We should've gone to the roof
when the music was playing.

167
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,762
Shit.

168
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:17,763
Music.

169
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,599
Wait a minute. We have music.

170
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,227
What? What music?

171
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,076
<i>Shit.</i>

172
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,882
This is insane.

173
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,433
Oh, what the fuck!

174
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,104
What are you doing
you stupid piece of shit?

175
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:08,981
You scared me.

176
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,193
Hey, get down. Get down.

177
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,987
Come on, come on. Move your ass.

178
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,573
Get in here. Hurry up.

179
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,950
Get in here.

180
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,451
Get in, you asshole.

181
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,377
-So, you okay?
-Huh?

182
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,629
Where the fuck have you been?

183
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,714
Me?

184
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,258
Well, obviously, you.

185
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,552
What happened to your eye?

186
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,055
What? My eye?

187
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,143
Get it together, idiot.

188
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,687
What are you looking at, moron?

189
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,689
Listen.

190
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,232
Look. You see that car?

191
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,611
-You're gonna go run in that way.
-Why should I?

192
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,988
Shut up. You run if I say,
you little shit.

193
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,032
You want me to lure the zombies?

194
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:04,411
Mm-hmm. You go that way and lure them.

195
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,955
I'll go over that way and scream.

196
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,541
Then we run to the snack shop
while they're confused.

197
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,251
Got it?

198
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,961
I'll be going away from the snack shop.

199
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,215
That's why you should run like hell
and circle around.

200
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,008
Okay, come on. Run.

201
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,676
No way.

202
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,595
You chicken shit.

203
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,222
All right, go. Go, come on--

204
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,350
Don't talk to me that way.
I'm not your gopher now either.

205
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,561
Hey. Are you fucking out of your mind?

206
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,314
Snap out of it, will you?

207
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,441
Look at me.

208
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,859
It's me.

209
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:37,861
Do it.

210
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,326
Fine. I'll go.

211
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,577
Go now.

212
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,039
Hurry the fuck up.

213
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,252
Come with me.

214
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,211
What?

215
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,595
Quiet.

216
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,555
They'll hear you.

217
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,810
Watch this.

218
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,144
Look at it.

219
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,690
You're nothing to me now, got it?

220
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,568
Ah, you stupid chicken shit.

221
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,570
Beg for your life.

222
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:24,825
Come on.

223
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,911
"Save me." Come on.

224
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,456
Save me. Please, please save me. Please.

225
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,708
No way.

226
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:42,551
Gwi-nam! Save me, you fucking asshole!

227
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,438
Cheong-san.

228
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,108
I'll gouge your eye out.

229
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,327
We're going to have to build
a tall barricade here,

230
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,245
and then we lure them in with music.

231
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,455
Use the instruments too.

232
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:15,000
If we leave the door open,
they'll follow the music in.

233
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,377
Once it's clear,
we take the back door up to the roof.

234
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,171
In other words, what you're saying is

235
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:23,216
we stack desks, chairs, and whatever else
we could find in the middle here.

236
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:27,429
Open the front door
and run out through the back door, right?

237
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,682
Not here. Farther back.

238
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,059
We need more room on this side.

239
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,269
And why is that?

240
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,813
There aren't that many of us,
but there are lots of zombies.

241
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,398
Ah…

242
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,817
She sucks at school,
but she's pretty smart.

243
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:41,985
Hey.

244
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,445
It's a compliment.

245
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,866
Let's give it a shot.

246
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,701
We can figure out the rest later.

247
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:51,787
We have a TV too.

248
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,289
We should be able to connect it
and make it louder.

249
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,291
I will have to look for the cord though.

250
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,294
-Hey, can you help me look, Ji-min?
-Sure.

251
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,671
-Me too.
-It should be over here.

252
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,090
Let's give it a shot.

253
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,051
Guys.

254
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,012
We should untie that.

255
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,931
We should build
a frame first.

256
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,266
I'll do the moving.
You guys work on the frame.

257
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,352
It's okay.

258
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,145
Su-hyeok.

259
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,855
Keep it down.

260
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,441
She'll never be able to get close
to the others this way.

261
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,527
And no one will approach her.

262
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,573
Hatred is contagious.

263
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,701
But so is trust.

264
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:38,792
Nam-ra.

265
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,598
You should've been the class president.

266
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,741
Come on, let's help out.

267
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,410
Let's go.

268
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,376
One, two, three.

269
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,094
POLICE

270
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,366
RESTRICTED AREA

271
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,054
Hey. Be quiet.

272
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,055
Keep it down, okay?

273
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,939
They're gonna swarm all over it.

274
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,525
Make sure to build a strong foundation.

275
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,526
Well…

276
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,404
There. Right there. Empty spot.

277
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,789
Fix it down there first.

278
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,501
Maybe that's too big.

279
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,632
Wait, what?

280
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:33,902
It's looking great.

281
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:46,790
Ow. Ow, ow!

282
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,375
Ow, it hurts.

283
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:52,128
Suck it up.
You're supposed to be a senior.

284
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,256
Why do seniors have to put up
with everything?

285
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,926
I'm not smoking,
and you can't handle that?

286
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,637
-You'll die if you don't smoke?
-Yes, of course.

287
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,515
I feel like I'm going to fucking die,
so you suck it up too, all right?

288
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:04,474
We'll take the trail.

289
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:05,892
The one behind the building.

290
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,019
Once we get past the tennis courts,

291
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,854
we can go through the construction site
and up the mountain.

292
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,691
Do you think we can make it?

293
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,402
I'm not sure.

294
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,861
Motherfucker.

295
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,321
Min-jae.

296
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,033
If you don't think he'll make it,
drop him and shoot, okay?

297
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,993
Okay.

298
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,329
Are you talking about me?

299
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,999
-Let's go.
-Up, on three.

300
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,837
Ready? One, two, three!

301
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,672
Hold on. Wait.

302
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,340
Hold on.

303
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,467
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

304
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,556
Hey. If you drop this.
You pick them up, okay?

305
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,600
Let's go.

306
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,311
One, two, three.

307
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,896
Oh, he's so heavy!

308
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,858
Shit.

309
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:05,910
Hold on.

310
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,959
Ow. Wait. Hold on.

311
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,505
Hey. Look, it broke! What do we do?

312
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,924
-Get back in. Hurry! Get back!
-Back in?

313
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:20,925
-Back! Get back!
-Back. Damn it!

314
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,430
They're coming! Hurry.

315
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,643
Oh, shit.

316
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,523
Hey. Go without me. Okay?

317
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,441
Idiot.

318
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,902
You can't take me anyway.

319
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,739
You'll post about it on Facebook
if we leave you..

320
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:43,990
I won't.

321
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,116
I don't trust you.

322
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,202
Stop pretending to care.

323
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,454
You killed Ha-lim.

324
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,543
You don't care about anyone.

325
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,086
You're such a dick.

326
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,717
Let's try once again. Stronger this time.

327
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,427
Okay.

328
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,816
What the hell do you want from me anyway?

329
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,070
It hurts like crazy.
Do you know what dying feels like?

330
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,239
Yeah.

331
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,658
I feel that way every single time
I take a test.

332
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:29,911
But…

333
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,664
I can only take so much of your pain.

334
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,625
Shut up and be quiet, all right?

335
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,005
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

336
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,514
You're okay? Doesn't hurt?

337
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,395
Sergeant…

338
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,106
you know…

339
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,859
I'm thinking that
we should probably use our skills

340
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,902
to get ourselves out of here first.

341
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,446
And then they can send
the army in for the kids after, you know?

342
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,115
I think that makes more sense.

343
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,575
Sergeant?

344
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,161
If we all die,

345
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,247
who's going to tell them
about the important laptop--

346
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,874
Ho-seong.

347
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,000
Ho-cheol.

348
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,084
Ho-cheol.

349
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:22,463
Do you know why some people run
to safety when they are in danger?

350
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:28,219
Because there are others
who are running into danger for them.

351
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,097
Why put ourselves in danger
if there's no reason to?

352
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,683
You're so frustrating.

353
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,810
I ought to just…

354
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,355
If you die,
I'll put in a request with the higher-ups

355
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,025
for a statue of you as big as the one
of Admiral Yi Sun-sin.

356
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,359
Okay? Happy?

357
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,029
What's with this guy?

358
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,741
If you're feeling scared,
you could just stay here.

359
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,911
Goodness. Very well put. Yes.

360
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:57,790
Okay, listen.
We're gonna leave together now.

361
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,668
We're gonna go zoom on the motorcycle, hm?

362
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,837
What about Mommy?

363
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,346
Well, your mommy…

364
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,141
Let's just come back for her later, okay?

365
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:22,690
My son is about your age.
He's very handsome.

366
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,525
I can introduce you to him if you like.

367
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,487
I already have a boyfriend though.

368
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,368
Uh… Hey, what did I say to do
once we go out?

369
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,455
You said to keep my eyes shut tightly
and hold onto you.

370
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,291
That's right. Good girl. Very good.

371
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,377
Are you ready?

372
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,212
Uh, no.

373
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,716
CHEONGSAN CHICKEN

374
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,012
Go faster! Faster!

375
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,139
-Speed up! Speed up!
-Shut up!

376
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,724
You're drawing them to us,
you fucking idiot!

377
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,352
Shut up, I say!

378
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:01,896
Quiet, asshole!

379
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,273
Watch it. Oh, my god!

380
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,280
-They're coming!
-Oh, they're right behind us!

381
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,281
Look ahead, dipshit!

382
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,704
Turn! Turn, turn!

383
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:19,455
Go!

384
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,416
-Turn! Turn!
-Where? Where?

385
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,339
Just go this way, sir. This way. Go.

386
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,135
Watch out! Watch out! Careful!

387
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,344
Right! Go right!

388
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,181
Oh, a dead-end!

389
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,308
-What do we do?
-Wait.

390
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,768
Wait, no! There's a way!

391
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,937
-Oh, my god. There is?
-There is!

392
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,022
Let's go.

393
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,648
Hey, what are you--

394
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,817
Stop doing that.

395
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:51,320
Right here you fuckers!

396
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,613
Go!

397
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,203
Yeah!

398
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,708
Se-bin, we're saved!

399
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,835
Pipe down
unless you want more of them.

400
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,378
Help me!

401
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,838
Huh? What?

402
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,214
-Here, over here!
-What's that sound?

403
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,091
-Please help.
-Hear that?

404
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,134
Here!

405
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,552
Look up! Over here!

406
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,095
Over here.

407
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,972
-Help me!
-What is that?

408
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,474
Hey, you idiot!

409
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,517
Idiot, asshole.

410
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,396
-What the?
-What took you so long?

411
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,982
-All right, hang on.
-Sergeant, let's just go. Come on.

412
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,693
-Huh?
-Let's just go. Come on, please.

413
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:31,986
Please help me.

414
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,362
Just go. Let's go.

415
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,989
Do you have
something to drink?

416
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,157
Ooh. There's more, look.

417
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,533
What? Where?

418
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,204
Ah, there's nothing.

419
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,332
Can you climb down?

420
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,125
No. I hurt my leg.

421
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,294
-I can't get down.
-Let's just go.

422
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,296
Come on, please. Let's go.

423
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,257
Wait, wait, wait. What are you doing?

424
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,301
-What are you gonna do?
-There.

425
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,222
-Here, take the baby.
-Huh?

426
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,349
Hurry, sir. Please.

427
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,684
-Hold on.
-What are you gonna do?

428
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,644
Stay still.

429
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:06,979
Stay right here.

430
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,398
Bring the bike close. Shit.

431
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,067
Yeah, climb up that way.

432
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,402
Bring it close. Asshole.

433
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,404
Come here. Hurry. Hurry.

434
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,781
Fuck this.

435
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,492
Ho-cheol! Ho-cheol!

436
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,451
-Where is he going?
-Stop it!

437
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,702
Ho-cheol! Wait!

438
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,079
Where the hell
is he going?

439
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:26,415
-College boy! Stop!
-Get back here, you moron.

440
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,771
All right. I think this is good enough.

441
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,440
Okay.

442
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:54,110
Aren't you guys coming?

443
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,362
We left a gap over there for you.

444
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,698
Let's go.

445
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,045
Why aren't you coming over?

446
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,464
Well, someone has to stay
to open the door.

447
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,428
Couldn't you have come up
with a better plan?

448
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,346
It's okay.

449
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,849
-I'll come over right away.
-Wait.

450
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,184
I'll come.

451
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,685
It's fine.

452
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,353
It is not fine.

453
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,105
Here.

454
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,037
What happened with you and Gwi-nam?

455
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,414
He said he was gonna kill you.

456
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:53,878
Shit.

457
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,548
It's because I saw him
killing the principal.

458
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:02,220
I said I was going to tell the cops,
so he tried to kill me.

459
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,556
Prick.

460
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,150
Gwi-nam's dead.

461
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:17,985
Yeah?

462
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,195
Mm-hm.

463
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,156
He fell from up high
when I was fighting him.

464
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,245
-And I'm in love with Nam-ra.
-Huh?

465
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,289
I've liked Nam-ra for a while now.

466
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,290
You have?

467
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,793
You be good to On-jo, okay?

468
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,588
Don't treat her like she's a guy, moron.

469
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,968
You ready? I'll do it.

470
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,596
Go. Get over there.

471
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:47,682
Go.

472
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,253
Oh, shit.

473
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,922
Dae-su, you got to make some noise!

474
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,467
Die, zombies!

475
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:10,890
Fucking die!

476
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,435
Do it one more time.

477
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:15,644
Shit.

478
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,647
Stupid zombies.

479
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:25,488
Motherfuckers!

480
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:41,712
Wu-jin!

481
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,757
We can't go yet! Not yet.

482
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,357
Nam-ra!

483
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,416
It's not going to hold up!

484
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:04,837
Shit.

485
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,592
How much longer is it gonna take?
Let's go!

486
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:14,847
A little more. Not yet!

487
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,212
We need to study him
to create a treatment or a vaccine,

488
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,631
but we don't have equipment or scientists.

489
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,217
We'll have to take him to the KDCA.

490
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,513
He cannot leave the quarantine zone

491
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,223
under any circumstances,
do you understand?

492
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,267
Find scientists and build the facility.

493
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,395
We will airlift all necessary equipment.

494
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,651
-What's his name?
-Staff Sergeant Lee Jae-jun.

495
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:12,404
A week away from discharge,
but he volunteered for the operation.

496
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,991
Get his parents consent to do research.

497
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:20,538
We're under martial law,
we don't need his parent's consent.

498
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,998
If you decide to give consent,

499
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,544
we can begin the experiment
or autopsy right away.

500
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,629
I said call his parents.

501
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,757
Even under martial law,

502
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,343
that's our duty
for taking away their child.

503
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,303
Yes, sir.

504
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,652
Commander, sir.

505
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,363
There's assemblywoman awaiting testing.

506
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:56,323
She has to follow rules.

507
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,076
It's Park Eun-hee
from the National Defense Committee.

508
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:00,995
Damn it.

509
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,630
I'm the commander here.

510
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,259
Nice to meet you. I'm--

511
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:17,511
Even if you are
an assemblywoman,

512
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,055
around here you're not going
to get any special treatment.

513
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:22,641
That's all I came to tell you.

514
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,394
Don't bother these people
trying to do their jobs.

515
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:29,273
I'd appreciate it
if you'd stay quiet and follow the rules.

516
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:32,651
That's fine. I have a favor to ask though.

517
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,154
Please send a chopper
to Hyosan High School.

518
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,073
There's a firefighter on his way there.
He's by himself.

519
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,868
Commander. Hey. Wait!

520
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:44,204
You got to send the helicopter
to the high school.

521
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,998
We have to save the children!

522
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,169
Even wars can't rid of schools.

523
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:53,547
Even if you win,
if the schools are gone, we've lost.

524
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,771
How many students
have we saved so far?

525
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,107
So far, zero sir.

526
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,276
We don't think anyone got out

527
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,654
because all the students
were in class at that time.

528
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:19,698
Are choppers available?

529
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,201
No, sir. They've all been sent
on missions.

530
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:30,459
Request a Black Hawk immediately.
Have them scan high schools in Hyosan.

531
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,045
Absolutely, sir.

532
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:36,173
MAP OF HYOSAN

533
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:49,853
Gangha-dong as well?

534
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,317
Isn't that where your mother's house is?

535
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:02,449
Once he's named in the rescue zone,
we can check there.

536
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,328
Okay, sir.

537
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,222
Clear. We have to go now!

538
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,396
Hurry!

539
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,276
Hey, let's go!

540
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,446
-Go!
-You go first.

541
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,498
I'm gonna shit my pants. Go!

542
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:59,047
-Come on.
-Let's go.

543
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:23,363
Hurry.

544
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,246
Move!

545
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:50,182

<i>I'll go to Hyosan High.</i>

550
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:15,374
Come on.

551
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,717
Over here! Over here!

552
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,218
Here! I'm here!

553
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,345
Over here!

554
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,813
Come on, open it.

555
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:22,399
It's locked.

556
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,859
What?

557
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,986
Move.

558
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,703
Wait. Get back. Move.

559
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:40,292
Shit.

560
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,379
Is anyone there?

561
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,214
Anyone?

562
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:49,217
Is anyone there? Anyone?

563
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:50,802
Open the door!

564
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,680
Of course not! Get back.

565
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,225
One, two, three!

566
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,352
One, two, three!

THE ROOFTOP IS OFF LIMITS TO STUDENTS

568
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:07,861
Fuck.

569
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,034
Hear that?

570
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,369
What?

571
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,960
<i>We're outcasts again.</i>

572
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:24,795
And this is still hell.

573
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,713
I really hope everyone dies.

574
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,006
All of them.

575
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:41,603

<i>Dad, you're okay too, right?</i>

578
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,026
I'm…

579
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:51,571
I'm doing good.

<i>Mom.</i>

581
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,745
Cheongsan Chicken
still sounds stupid, by the way.

582
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,833
If it were Cheongsan Auto, Cheongsan Group
or Cheongsan Air

Throw this over!

591
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:48,855
Out of my way.

Where are the others?

597
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,555
Isn't there anyone else?
