1
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,040
Lieutenant Carapax

2
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,920
tell me that you've found the Scarab.

3
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,240
They're cutting into it now.

4
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
That's exciting.

5
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,656
I've had them working
around the clock

6
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,560
since we unearthed it
about two weeks ago.

7
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,680
Good. Let's keep this thing airtight

8
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,136
until we're ready to show the board.

9
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,720
Miss Kord. Miss Kord?

10
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,920
- Oh, Dr. Sanchez, hello.
- Sorry.

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,320
Hi. Actually, that's not my name.

12
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,920
How much longer you think
it's gonna be?

13
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,080
We'll hit the center before sunrise.

14
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,240
Well, push your men harder.

15
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,080
I've searched for 15 years.

16
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,600
I don't want to wait another second.

17
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,416
Should've called before making
the trip out, Miss Kord.

18
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,536
This could be another decoy.

19
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,720
It's in there.

20
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,160
I can feel it.

21
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,200
All right. Let's do this.

22
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,280
Excuse me, sir? How do I look?

23
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,920
Like you're six figures in debt.

24
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,560
Okay.

25
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,560
You all know.

26
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,280
We say nothing for now.

27
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,840
Let's enjoy this moment.
Before he knows.

28
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,920
I'll tell him.

29
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,440
What the hell? Why not?

30
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,920
Even good news...

31
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,760
And this is pretty bad news.

32
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,360
I can be joyful.

33
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,040
Your job is the balloon.

34
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,880
Hope I can handle it.

35
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,000
Handle what?

36
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,760
The graduate is here!

37
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,440
- How was your flight?
- Good.

38
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,960
- Are you hungry?
- Of course.

39
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,920
Here. It's all they had.

40
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,960
- Welcome back, bro.
- Thank you.

41
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,560
Nana! Do you like it?

42
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,840
I love it.

43
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Now we hug!

44
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,400
- Oh, family!
- Hey, where's Uncle Rudy?

45
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,520
That, my Rudy!

46
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,280
<i>Eso!</i>
Welcome back, freaking college boy.

47
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,096
Hey! Come on. Get out the car
and give me a hug.

48
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,120
No. No hugs, man.

49
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,456
They got Big Brother watching.
There's cameras.

50
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,616
I knew you were gonna say something.

51
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,440
Facial recognition.
Body imaging scanners.

52
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,760
Yeah, and they're all so happy
to finally catch you.

53
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,520
You see?
It's that kind of talk right there

54
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,616
that's gonna get us all busted.

55
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,600
- Where'd you get this?
- I bought it for Jaime.

56
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,040
A boy? We know it's a boy.
There's probably a bug in here.

57
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,320
Come on. What are you doing?

58
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,080
Oh, my God! I missed this so much.

59
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,920
Good to know
some things don't change.

60
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,480
Mom and Dad
have something to tell you.

61
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,440
- Milagro.
- What?

62
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,240
Okay, he's had his tacos,
now let him have the truth.

63
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,120
The truth? What is it?

64
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
- We...
- We...

65
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,440
We're losing the house.

66
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,920
- What?
- See?

67
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,016
- He didn't take it that bad.
- No... losing the house?

68
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,176
What does she mean, losing the house?

69
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,336
- The landlord tripled the rent.
- They gave us three months

70
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,880
to come up with the money or get out.

71
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,400
I am so sorry, <i>flaquito.</i>

72
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,080
No. <i>Amá</i>, don't be sorry.
It's not your fault.

73
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,120
It just means that we're gonna have
to bust our ass at the shop, right?

74
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,120
Auto shop's gone.

75
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,720
- How?
- You can thank Kord for that.

76
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,480
- Brother.
- We couldn't keep up.

77
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,360
Especially since your dad, he...

78
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,600
He had a...

79
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,040
- He...
- Dad had a heart attack.

80
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
What?

81
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,200
I'm fine!

82
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,440
At least the food's the same.
Right, <i>cabezón?</i>

83
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,520
Wait, why didn't you tell me?

84
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,760
You were working so hard, <i>mi amor.</i>

85
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,160
We didn't want
to distract you from school.

86
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,040
Ma, I could have done something.

87
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,440
I could have come back.

88
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,600
I could have been here.
I could have...

89
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,760
Cheer up, Jaime.

90
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,600
We figured it out. We always do.

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,920
We have a lot
to be grateful for. Look...

92
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,360
Yeah. And the last!

93
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,120
Yes, because you didn't apply.

94
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,200
What, so I can get into debt
for the rest of my life? No, thanks.

95
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,120
What? 25%?

96
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,560
<i>Mi amor,</i> these people make nothing.

97
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,520
We are broke.

98
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,440
Let's worry about money tomorrow.

99
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,240
Remember how Mom taught us salsa

100
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,600
right there on the front porch?

101
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,776
You were always better than me.

102
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,560
Yeah. No, I still think
you don't know how to dance salsa.

103
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,080
Yeah, I got two left feet.
I can't help it.

104
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
Yeah.

105
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,680
Do you remember your 21st birthday?

106
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,520
I remember the first half.

107
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,200
I can't believe
we're losing this place.

108
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,720
It was rough.

109
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,120
Yeah, well, I'm not leaving again.

110
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,800
What about grad school?

111
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,240
Well, that's not gonna help
the family.

112
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,440
I can't get us into even more debt.

113
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,000
Cheer up, bro.

114
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,120
Okay, you always land on your feet.

115
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,880
You're Jaime.

116
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,280
Thank you, but...

117
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,440
This wasn't how
it was supposed to happen, Mili.

118
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,720
What was supposed to happen?

119
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,320
I was supposed to make it out.

120
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,880
I was supposed to get all of us
out of here.

121
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,120
Thanks, bro, but I like the Keys.

122
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,320
- You know what I meant.
- Yeah.

123
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,801
Doesn't it bother you that they talk
about progress and get everything

124
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,720
while we have to sit here
and go broke?

125
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,480
You're a Mexican
in Edge Keys, <i>carnal.</i>

126
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,720
That progress is not for us.

127
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,120
Okay? The poor go over here
and the rich go over there

128
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,160
until the rich want to be here
and push us out.

129
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,136
We used to have the other side
of the tracks

130
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,560
and now they want that too.

131
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,240
I still have a degree, right?

132
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,720
That's gotta mean something.

133
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
I'll get a job.

134
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,560
Not just any job, but a prime job.

135
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,560
Yeah, I'm gonna get the money
to save this place.

136
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,000
Don't look at me at like that.

137
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,240
Look, Mili, I'm telling you,
in five years

138
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,480
we're gonna be rolling in it.

139
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,200
This is just gonna be
one of our houses.

140
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,360
We're gonna have the mansion
on the water

141
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,960
with the marble everywhere,
infinity pool.

142
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,640
Yeah, just watch, Mili.

143
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,280
Just watch.

144
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,920
Excuse me, Mr. Reyes?

145
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,080
You finish scraping the gum
off that lounger or what?

146
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,320
This is bullshit.

147
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,560
"Thanks, Milagro,
for hooking me up with this gig."

148
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,680
It's not my fault your future
didn't turn out the way you wanted.

149
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,416
How am I supposed to get experience
when nobody's gonna give me a job?

150
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,520
Sounds like a you problem.

151
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,760
Seriously?

152
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,920
What? I'm keeping us employed,
you noob!

153
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,440
Yes, we've finally found it.

154
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,480
Doctor Sanchez
is running tests on it now.

155
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,240
With the actual code in hand

156
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,496
we can move
beyond the prototype phase.

157
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,560
Check it out.

158
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,760
Yes, yes.

159
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,160
There goes Victoria Kord.

160
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,880
Look at that walk.

161
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,600
She's kinda sexy in like
a Cruella Kardashian sorta way.

162
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,760
- I'm gonna say hi.
- No...

163
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,840
Good afternoon, ma'am.

164
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,760
If you want, we could.

165
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,801
It's the breakthrough we've been
working towards, General.

166
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,320
We're invisible
to people like that, Jaime.

167
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,360
It's like our superpower.

168
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,680
Okay. Back to work.

169
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,480
I agree. That's a waste of time,
but General, I am telling you

170
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,360
what I'm gonna show you
tomorrow night

171
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,920
is gonna blow you away.

172
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,480
Yes. I look forward, also.

173
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Bye.

174
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,560
Aunt Vicki?

175
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,920
Jennifer, what are you doing here?

176
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,320
I didn't know you were coming.

177
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,280
Oh, Carapax, this is Ted's daughter.

178
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,280
My favorite niece, Jennifer.

179
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,880
So, to what do I owe
this unexpected pleasure?

180
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,640
<i>The world has changed.</i>

181
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,120
<i>Kord Industries faces

182
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,600

183

<i>The OMAC, the "One Man Army Corps."</i>

187
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,280
Where are we going?

188
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,840
Gotta take a shit, bro.
Need you to be a lookout.

189
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,760
Wait, but the service restrooms
are out there.

190
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,240
Yeah, and I deserve a luxury dump
right now, all right?

191
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
I...

192

<i>Using revolutionary Kord symbiotech</i>

<i>The OMAC.</i>

199
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,840
Think it works pretty well,
don't you?

200
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,720
So, this project
was shut down years ago.

201
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,480
Why have you relaunched it?

202
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,560
Jennifer, Jennifer, the OMAC
is the future of this company.

203
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,640
You should be so excited.

204
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,600
No... I really want to know
what's at Pago Island?

205
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,920
That's classified.

206
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,800
It's a secret.

207
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,760
But I'll tell you,
what isn't classified

208
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,240
is what's gonna go on at this party.

209
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,240
It's gonna be an amazing evening
with some very interesting people

210
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,000
so if you wanna come,
bring someone and it'll be fun.

211
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,400
All right, see you later.

212
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,240
I know what you're doing, Vicki.

213
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,600
We don't make weapons anymore.

214
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,760
"We"?

215
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,640
Who's "we"?

216
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,280
You are nothing to this company.
You're an expense.

217
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,480
A brat in her daddy's board seat

218
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,520
jet-setting around the world
on the company's dime

219
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,320
- doing your charity work.
- My father would never...

220
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,520
Look, your father was handed
a company I built, my company.

221
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Which he then proceeded
to almost sink

222
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,840
with his...
with his moronic inventions

223
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,240
and his reckless management

224
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,256
and then after he'd done all that,
you know what he did?

225
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,600
He just disappeared

226
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,160
and left me to pick up the pieces.

227
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,400
Your father abandoned this company.

228
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,400
And he abandoned you.

229
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,320
I won't let you do this.

230
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,440
Don't get in my way, Jennifer.

231
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,080
Back away.

232
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,760
I'm not afraid of you.

233
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,360
Maybe you should be.

234
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,880
She said to back away, ma'am.

235
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,920
That was lavish!

236
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,680
Oh, shit.

237
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,320
And who are you, handsome?

238
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,040
Jaime Reyes.

239
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,840
I think it's time to find
a new job, Jaime Reyes.

240
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,560
- I'm...
- You too, toilet. Go.

241
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,080
Hurry.

242
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,640
Thanks.

243
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,760
Where's the car?

244
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,320
Forty-seven minutes.

245
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,160
Hey, are you okay? That was...

246
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,960
I appreciate the chivalry

247
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,680
but I can take care of myself, okay?

248
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,840
Totally. But I mean...
What a dick, right?

249
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,640
She's a Kord. They're all dicks.

250
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,400
Jenny Kord.

251
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,480
We're not all dicks.

252
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,680
Obviously. Yeah.

253
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,560
Look, I'm... I'm really sorry
about this.

254
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,680
It's fine.

255
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,760
Give me your phone.
Let me give you my number.

256
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,880
Okay. Yeah.

257
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,720
Yeah. Come by Kord Tower tomorrow.

258
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,800
Okay.

259
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,360
I might be able to get you a job
somewhere else in our company.

260
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,160
Yes. Oh, my gosh. That'd be great.

261
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,800
I'll do anything. Really.

262
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,560
Anything, huh?

263
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,240
Hey, you know he has a degree, right?

264
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,200
- Pre-law.
- I... Yeah.

265
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,680
You guys need any pre-lawyers?

266
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,760
Okay.

267
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,200
- Text me.
- Okay.

268
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,080
Nice meeting you, Jaime Reyes.

269
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,040
Nice to meet you, too...

270
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Jenny Kord.

271
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,920
I think she might be into you.

272
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,160
What? No.

273
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,920
Bye.

274
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,840
- You think?
- Yeah. Yeah.

275
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,800
She took one look
at your young Mexican-ass

276
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,080
hero-of-the-moment vibe
and was into it.

277
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,880
Hey, you know what?

278
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,056
Maybe she'll pull you out of poverty
like María la del Barrio.

279
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,080
Okay.

280
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,480
Except, she's the rich white dude
and you're the María!

281
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,760
Yeah. Okay.

282
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,800
<i>A mucha honra, tan, tan, tan</i>

283
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,720
<i>María la del barrio, soy</i>

284
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,640
<i>La que de escuincla quedó resola</i>

285
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,240
<i>- Y...
- Fuera!</i>

286
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,080
<i>Y ahora, más que nunca,
estoy contigo.</i>

287
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,360
You drinking?

288
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,680
- Just one.
- Okay.

289
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,160
Don't tell your mother.

290
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,720
Can't sleep?

291
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,040
No.

292
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,280
Yeah.

293
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,360
I planted those nopales with <i>la Nana</i>
when you were a baby.

294
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,120
Look at them now.

295
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,880
Like you and la Mili,
grown and beautiful.

296
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,800
You okay?

297
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,520
Yeah.

298
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,216
Sorry, <i>Apá,</i>
it's just everything right now

299
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,520
feels so out of reach, and...

300
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,960
I feel like I failed you guys.

301
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,400
We're on a journey, Jaime.

302
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,920
This house, the <i>nopales,</i>
<i>el auto shop.</i>

303
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Everything.

304
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,200
They're just a stop in the journey.

305
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,760
But this isn't the destination.

306
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,560
And what is it?

307
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,680
I don't know.

308
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,960
What's important is that
we go on this journey together.

309
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,920
Things don't last.

310
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,240
Family, that's forever.

311
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,960
That lasts.

312
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,720
Everyone has a purpose.

313
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,880
You just haven't found yours.

314
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,080
So what's your purpose then?

315
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,640
I'm still searching, too.

316
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,040
But right now, it's this.

317
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,600
Talking to you, right here.

318
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,840
Cheer up, son.

319
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,920
Okay.

320
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,480
All right, okay, Jaime. You got this.

321
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,960
Cheer up, son!

322
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,440
God...

323
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,640
Thank you, <i>Apá.</i>

324
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,720
<i>Ya pues,</i> then, you guys can go, okay?

It's me. Jaime from yesterday.

- I'm sorry, I'm in a rush.
- No, that's all good.

370
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,256
But you know, yesterday you said
you'd consider getting me a job

371
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,000
and, you know,
I can't leave without one

372
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,120
even if that sounds too...

373
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,856
Do you think you could pause
for one second? Please...

374
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,760
Look, Jaime,
this is really a bad time.

375
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,840
Okay.
Let's talk while you have lunch.

376

Stay on comms.

378
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,480
You said you'd do anything, right?

379
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,240
Yeah. Basically, anything.

380
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,320
Here.

381
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,440
- Guard that with your life.
- Okay.

382
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
But do not open it.

383
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,440
Do not touch it!
Don't even look at it!

384
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,976
Okay. I'm just gonna guard it

385
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,400
Yeah, you're a quick learner.

386

- Yeah.
- Good. Now go!

387
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,480

- Go...

388

You two, with me!

389

So, you went in to get us jobs

390
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,680
and all you brought back
was a hamburger?

391
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,936
Okay, I don't think it's a burger.

392
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,320
You haven't looked?

393
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,440
She said not to open it. I...

394
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,200
- She's not here.
- What?

395
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,440
Okay, okay. One look.

396

Yes, right?

399
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,520
Why was she hiding it?

400
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I don't know.

401
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,480
It's kind of a letdown.

402
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,720

403
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,480

406
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,256
Very mature, but she said
to not open it, so please...

407
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,240
She said for you to not open it, bro.

408
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,520
Stop...

409

- Okay.

410

I'm gonna use a motor, all right?

411
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,000
- I'm gonna get my drill.
- Wait!

412
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,960
Don't get the drill!
What are you doing?

413

Okay.
This probably happens all the time.

558
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,520
Yeah, she wouldn't do this to me.

559
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,360
Yeah, right. Okay.

560
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,880

Okay, guys.
I need to go find Jenny Kord

'cause she's gonna know
how to get this thing out of me.

563

Where are my shoes?

564
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,600
Come on, where are my shoes?

565
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,800
Not the 84s!

566
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,040
These were my favorite shoes.

567
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,720
Okay. Okay.

568
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,960
Jaime, what happened?
Where did you go?

569
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,120
<i>Amá,</i> I don't know.

570
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,080
I think I cut a bus in half
and then...

571
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,000
- Cut what?
- And flew into orbit.

572
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,856
- What do you mean flew into orbit?
<i>- Apá,</i> I don't know.

573
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,936
- That's why I need to find Jenny.
- I am calling the police.

574
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,600
- Okay?
- No, no. Don't call the police.

575
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,880
No police.

576
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,960
They work for Kord.

577
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,240
What do you think Kord's gonna do

578
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,200
when they figure out
that some Mexican kid

579
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,880
has that type of military tech
inside of him?

580
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,176
They're gonna lock his ass up.

581
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,040
And then they're gonna wipe our minds

582
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,216
so that we don't tell anybody.

583
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,456
And it's not like
the government isn't used

584
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,616
to locking up Mexicans anyway.

585
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,480
I mean, this is sci-fi shit.
This is CIA.

586
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,440
- This is Area 51!
- Rudy, focus. What do you mean?

587
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,560
What I'm saying
is the government and Kord

588
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,840
are gonna be all over this

589
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,816
and then they're gonna start asking
for documents.

590
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,400
And that includes you, Nana.
And that includes you, Alberto.

591
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,736
Okay then fine. I'm just gonna
have to go by myself then.

592
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,000
You are not leaving this house.

593
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,560
<i>Amá,</i> I'm 22!

594
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,896
Besides, what if she's in danger?

595
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,080
What if she's in danger?

596
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,096
- Jaime, you flew out of the roof.
- You don't understand.

597
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,200
- He's into her.
- Oh, he totally is.

598
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,280
No, I'm not.

599
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,336
- Stalked her Insta.
- Where'd I put my...

600
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,200
She's Brazilian,
she lives at the Regent Tower.

601
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,360
And she's single, by the way.

602
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,800
Bit of a loner, though,
if you ask me. I mean...

603
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,880
She's single?

604
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,600
I thought you weren't into her.

605
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,056
What are you doing with my phone?

606
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
You left it unlocked.

607
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,480
Yes, the María.

608
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,760
Yes, I said the same thing.
But María la del Barrio.

609
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,600
- You hear that, <i>flaco?</i>
- Rudy!

610
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,760
What happened?

611
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,760
No...

612
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,880
Jaime!

613
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,520
No! Jaime! No!

614
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,760
Ma!

615
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,400
So itchy, this thing.

616
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,600
Okay.

617
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,800
No way.

618
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,200

620
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,760
Jenny?

621
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,400
- Oh, my gosh.
- What are you doing here?

622
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,896
- Just go. Just go. They're coming.
- Who's them?

623
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,080
They're coming. Them!

624
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,080
- Oh, God. Okay!
- Let's go!

625
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,640
Okay! Oh, my God!

626
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,840
I told you to go!

627
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,800
You should have started with,
"They have guns."

628
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
Watch out!

629
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,520
Oh, Rudy's gonna kill me.

630
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,680
Oh, my headlights!

631
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,320
No! My mirrors!

632
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,720
What the hell, man?

633
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,000
What's wrong with you? <i>Cabezón!</i>

634
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,520
Do you want some water?

635
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,600
My tailgate!

636
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,320
No, I'm good. I'm fine.

637
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,480
Okay.

638
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,480
What did you do to the Taco?

639
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,440
And that's Rudy.

640
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,760
My name's César, okay?

641
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,160
And only my friends call me Rudy.

642
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,200
- I'm Jenny.
- "I'm Jenny."

643
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,280
Hi, Jenny.

644
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,200
We know who you are.
What are you doing here?

645
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,840
Thinking about turning our house
into a nuclear power plant?

646
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,280
I went swimming out there

647
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,656
by where your family
has that company.

648
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,960
My testicles are seven times
their normal size.

649
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,320
Shouldn't you be pillaging cobalt

650
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,720
from some developing country
or something, Jenny?

651
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,280
- Where is it?
- Yeah.

652
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,080
Allow me.

653
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,640
Rudy! What?

654
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,560
- What are you doing?
- Rudy!

655
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,760
I thought the chingaderas
would come out.

656
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,520
- Come out?
- Jeez!

657
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,720
- What is he talking about?
- He's talking about this.

658
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,240
Oh, I forgot how bad it looks.

659
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,640
No, it doesn't look that bad.

660
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,360
I've seen worse.

661
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,320
- Where?
- You don't wanna know.

662
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,520
Okay, what the hell is this thing?

663
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,000
It's called the Scarab.

664
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,520
It was given to my dad
when I was a kid...

665
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,400
It's some kind
of a world destroying weapon.

666
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,560
Oh, that's nice.

667
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,960
- Weapon?
- What did she say?

668
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,160
What?

669
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,336
And did you know what was
gonna happen to my brother

670
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,000
when you stuck him
with this world destroying thing?

671
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,120
No, I swear to you,
I had no idea this would happen.

672
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
I mean, come on.

673
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,600
My father said it can't be activated
by just any person.

674
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,800
It has to choose you.

675
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,560
So I'm guessing it's chosen you.

676
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,920
No more blind dates.

677
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,160
Okay. So, how do we get it
to un-choose me?

678
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,720
I don't know. But we better move fast

679
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,880
because my aunt will kill us all
just to get it back.

680
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,000
Kill us?

681
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,640
No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

682
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,760
She's the one who sent the assassins.
Yeah.

683
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,440
I'm so sorry I put you all
in this situation.

684
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,480
I had no idea it would activate.

685
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,760
Really. I didn't know.

686
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,160
That's convenient.

687
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,256
But she already said she didn't know.

688
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,280
She's a Kord, dude.
You seriously trust her?

689
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,320
We are going to figure it out.
We always do.

690
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,720
Come on, we are the Reyes.

691
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,920
We've dealt with harder things.

692
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
We have?

693
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,440
Cheer up. We can do this.

694
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,800
Yeah. Yeah, <i>Apá.</i>

695
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,960
He's right.

696
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,000
Okay, so, how are we gonna get
this thing outta me?

697
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,320
You know, before it busts
another hole in our house.

698
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,440
Exactly.

699
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,480
There's a place
where we can get some answers.

700
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,200
But we need the key.

701
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,080
Okay, so where's the key?

702
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,880
At the Kord building.

703
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,016
And they're probably
on high alert over there

704
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,200
since I took the Scarab.

705
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,360
So, what are we talking about?
Laser-based security system?

706
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,760
Wide area motion imagery maybe?

707
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,200
Photonic emitters?

708
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,680
I really don't...

709
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,360
Because I've been working on
something that I believe can help us.

710
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,120
And it's almost finished.

711
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,440
If I can get
the mechanical structure right.

712
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,520
I love you, Ma.

713
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
Give me a couple hours.

714
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,200
You're aware
that if you deliver the OMAC

715
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,616
you'd be the most powerful
weapons manufacturer in the world.

716
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,960
If you buy into this, you can
call me whatever you want.

717
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,240
Oh, if it isn't the devil himself.

718
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,520
General, this is Lieutenant Carapax.

719
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,120
He's been crucial to the development
of the prototype

720
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,200
and I personally handpicked him
for his courage

721
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,760
during the anti-communist

722
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,120
counter-terrorism operations
in Guatemala.

723
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,720
He's the perfect recipient
for the OMAC

724
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,680
and a product of the school
of the Americas.

725
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,960
Great to meet you, Lieutenant.

726
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,840
Well, can't wait to see it in action.

727
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,960
- When will it be ready?
- Oh, it's ready, isn't it?

728
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,440
We're just putting
some finishing touches on it.

729
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,200
We have a problem.

730
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,600
Well, if you'll excuse us.

731
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,960
Have a cigar,
they're made by real Cubans.

732
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,880
You lost her? How?

733
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,320
My men saw someone helping her.

734
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,080
All right. I wanna find out
who she is working with now.

735
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,200
Because without the Scarab,
we can't complete the OMAC.

736
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,720
I'm on it.
I will bring the Scarab back.

737
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,200
This time, I'll do it personally.

738
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,000
Well, I would hope so, Carapax,
because if not

739
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,760
all your sacrifices
will have been in vain.

740
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,800
Just think of how much suffering
your body has been through.

741
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,360
I'm aware of what you've done to it.

742
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,400
My God... What we've done.

743
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,800
Ignacio, I'm on your side.

744
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,040
Do you not remember
what it was like when I found you?

745
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,200
How badly crippled you were?

746
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,440
How broken?

747
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,240
I am just trying to fix you.

748
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,080
Okay?

749
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,280
Good.

750
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,760
I have to go back to the party.

751
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,600
Now, go get me that Scarab.

752
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,320
That's it?

753
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,600
I call it, El Chapulín.

754
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,840
Why?

755
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,560
You know,
when you make something cool

756
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,320
you can call yours
whatever you want, okay?

757
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,680
Here, be useful. Hold that.

758
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,120
You're sure that this one works?

759
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,080
Thank you. Yes.

760
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,040
Unlike the junk that Kord makes,
my tech delivers.

761
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,216
Okay. You could have just said yes.

762
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,680
Okay, cupcake, you wanna hit
that yellow switch there?

763
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,840
Hit the yellow switch.

764
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,960
I just did.

765
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,000
Okay.

766
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,400
Well, at least I don't have to
open that annoying tailgate.

767
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,680
It's going on your tab.

768
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,920
So just give me, like, one step.

769
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,200
Just gotta give it a little...

770
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:00,280
- Oh, that's sexy.
- Great.

771
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,000
That's great. So it works.

772
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,560
Yeah, it works.

773
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,280
I'll keep the truck running.

774
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,640
Let's go.

775
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,880
"So it works?"

776
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,440
Guys!

777
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,400
Something's happening.

778
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,600
What the hell is this?

779
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,920
<i>El Chapulín Colorado!</i> No way.

780
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,320
<i>So join me and my little pals</i>

781
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,480
<i>- and all of our Kord subsidiaries</i>
- The key's here.

782
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:41,680
<i>Around the globe,
to build a better future.</i>

783
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,840
<i>A Kord future.</i>

784
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,960
She seemed so different back then.

785
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,680
Vicki and my grandfather started
Kord Industries together

786
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,800
and turned it
into a military powerhouse.

787
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,640
Then, when my grandfather died

788
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,280
Victoria thought the company
would go to her.

789
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,840
But he left everything
to my dad instead.

790
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,640
- Seems kind of...
- Sexist?

791
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,720
Yeah.

792
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,800
Yeah.

793
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,160
Still, my father wanted
to steer the company

794
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,680
in a different direction.

795
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,800
So, Victoria became obsessed
with erasing my father's legacy.

796
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,080
Could I get a hand over here?

797
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,320
Yeah, sorry. What do you need?

798
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,800
- Just hold this.
- Okay.

799
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,680
There's a signal blocking our feed.

800
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,320
We're being jammed out.

801
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,280
Lieutenant Carapax? We got a problem.

802
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,840
- This is the key?
- Yeah.

803
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,040
Okay, let's go.

804
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,120
Let's go.

805
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,480
This is why I don't let anyone drive
the Taco!

806
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,640
To be honest, I didn't think
the Chapulín would work.

807
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,320
Yeah, that's Rudy.
He's like the Mexican Doc Brown.

808
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,400
No kidding.

809
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,840
- Okay.
- So that's all you need?

810
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,920
Yeah.

811
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,040
Oh, my God.
I don't know why I thought

- Khaji-Da.
<i>- Khaji qué?</i>

909
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,120

It's like I feel it in my mind.
Is that crazy?

911
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,320
You're becoming symbiotic.

912
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,520

- Okay, where to now?

913
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,400

915
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,720

know how to drive?

916

They're not gonna look for you here?

917
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,080
No one's been here since I was eight.

918
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,000
Yeah, I get it. That makes sense.

919
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,920
So, your dad was all obsessed
with scarabs, huh?

920
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,080
Where are we?

921
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,560
No way.

922
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,920
Wait.

923
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,600
Ted Kord was Blue Beetle?

924
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,360
What the hell is Blue Beetle?

925
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,480
Oh, you were a kid.
It's like Palmera's superhero.

926
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,560
Like Superman in Metropolis
or the Flash in Central City.

927
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:40,720
But just...

928
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,040
I don't know, maybe just not as good.

929
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,040
I can't believe
he was the Blue Beetle.

930
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,120
Oh, I get it though.

931
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,560
Eccentric billionaire, a genius.

932
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,640
The Blue Beetle.

933
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,520
Your dad was a great man.
I had no idea.

934
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,560
You can call me César or Rudy.

935
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,520
You can call me whatever you want,
I don't care.

936
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,400
Hey, how come all of this...

937
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,840
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

938
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
What were you saying?

939
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,960
Yeah, how come this stuff
doesn't look more like...

940
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,400
Nicer? Less ridiculous?

941
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,000
No. But I mean...

942
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,800
Like, look at this.
It's like Batman's stuff, but...

943
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,600
like if he had ADHD or something.

944
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,800
Batman's a fascist.

945
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,960
The Blue Beetle,
he had a sense of humor.

946
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,000
My dad was never able
to unlock the Scarab.

947
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,600
So instead, he built his own tech
to fight as Blue Beetle.

948
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,800
If there's a way to get it out,
it's in there.

949
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,200
Let's crack into this sucker.

950
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,280
- Damn, you stink.
- This is your shirt.

951
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,760
Come on, I think there's some
of my dad's clothes upstairs.

952
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,840
That's a good idea.
This is gonna take a minute.

953
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,520
Jeez. When is this day gonna end?

954
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,320
Is everything okay?

955
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,960
Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I'll be right out.

956
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,400
Yeah, I think they...

957
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,480
I think they fit.

958
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,000
And they're comfy too, so...

959
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,560
Good.

960
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,120
It must have been so cool
growing up in a place like this, no?

961
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,360
Honestly, it was...

962
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,840
it was pretty lonely
most of the time.

963
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,920
It was just you three in here?

964
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Yeah.

965
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,480
That was my mother's last painting.

966
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:44,640
Why'd she stop?

967
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,640
My mom died when I was six.

968
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,080
We don't...

969
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,776
- I'm so sorry to...
- It's okay.

970
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,800
No, it's okay. It's fine.

971
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:56,920
What was she like?

972
00:54:58,280 --> 00:54:59,320
She was great.

973
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:02,880
She was great.

974
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,560
She changed my dad's life.

975
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,240
She was the one who taught him
that the world

976
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,440
is a place to protect.

977
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,560
Nice.

978
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:18,280
But when my mom died,
he really went adrift.

979
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,760
He obsessed over the Scarab

980
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,080
and he would disappear for days.

981
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,360
Sometimes weeks.

982
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,840
And one day, he...

983
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,760
he left and...

984
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,680
didn't come back.

985
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,480
I'm so sorry, Jenny.

986
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,240
You're really lucky.

987
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:51,120
This house is... it's full of stuff.

988
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:54,280
Your house is full of love.

989
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:58,520
Your family.

990
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,360
Yeah.

991
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,800
That's a home.

992
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,080
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

993
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,120
Sorry for what?

994
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,720
I haven't talked about this
in a very long time.

995
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,160
Kinda feels nice to, maybe, right?

996
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:21,920
Thank you.

997
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,640
Yeah.

998
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,520
You're a good listener.

999
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,120
My mom says
it's 'cause I got big ears.

1000
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,536
Hey, guys, I found something that...

1001
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,160
- Nothing happened.
- Her mom died.

1002
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,240
I found something you guys
need to look at.

1003
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,600
Great.

1004
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,920
That's great. Let's go.

1005
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,040
Nice jammies, dude.

1006
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,480
Okay.

1007
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,480
I've gone through the files.

1008
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,640
So, Ted had a professor,
this guy named Dan Garrett.

1009
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,840
The Scarab chose this Garrett guy

1010
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,320
before it chose you, Jaime.

1011
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,560
And <i>pinche</i> Ted,
ran tests on him to map out

1012
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,920
how the Scarab would react
to the human body.

1013
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,160
So, once this Scarab
goes up someone's ass...

1014
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,920
It didn't go up my ass.

1015
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,960
Okay. Well, it connects to the brain

1016
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,656
and that's what it's trying to do
to you, Jaime

1017
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,720
connect to your brain.

1018
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,520
It's trying to become one with you.

1019
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,600
Why?

1020
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,896
I think you should ask it yourself.

1021
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,360
I mean, this thing has its own will.

1022
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:25,960
It's sentient.

1023
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,560
That's why it chooses a host.

1024
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,240
That's why sometime
it does what you want

1025
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,280
and sometime it doesn't.

1026
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,600
Okay, well, who made it?
Can they help us?

1027
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,576
This wasn't made on Earth, <i>cabezón.</i>

1028
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,840
- No way.
<i>- Sí</i> way.

1029
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,240
It's alien.

1030
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,760
I don't really like the term alien.

1031
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,056
- You can use it, but I just...
- Whatever, Rudy. Come on.

1032
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,760
What... happened
to Ted's professor guy?

1033
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,840
How did he get it out?

1034
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,600
You might want to sit down.

1035
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,960
- Or not. All right...
- Rudy, please. Focus.

1036
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,040
I got good news and I got bad news.

1037
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,160
The good news is,
I figured out how to get it out.

1038
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,240
Fine.

1039
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,560
And the bad news is
that you have to be dead.

1040
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,720
- What?
- Dead.

1041
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,640
What do you mean dead?

1042
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,816
Okay, right now, Jaime, look.

1043
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,320
It's fusing itself
to every cell in your body.

1044
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,760
It's completely coiled
around your brain.

1045
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,896
And there's nothing on earth
that could remove it.

1046
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,880
It's designed to protect its host.

1047
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:15,680
To keep it alive.

1048
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,800
So you're saying that
this thing's in me forever?

1049
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,040
No, it's not forever.

1050
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,720
I mean, it's just until you...

1051
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,840
until you die.

1052
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,160
I think it's kinda cool.

1053
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,320
No, I mean, basically,
you are a superhero, <i>cabrón.</i>

1054
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,160
I'm so sorry.
I had no way of knowing...

1055
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,360
Oh, you had no idea.
So then what are my options now?

1056
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,520
So, option one
is to become an android

1057
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,640
for the rest of my life.

1058
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,400
Or option two is to hand myself over
to a murderous

1059
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,080
- billionaire psychopath?
- I'm so sorry.

1060
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,480
All I wanted was a job.

1061
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,040
- Maybe there's a...
- Maybe what, Rudy?

1062
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,280
It's all bad news.

1063
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,096
Okay, this shit just doesn't
get any better for us.

1064
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,600
I don't understand why you can't...

1065
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,440
God.

1066
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,800
Whatever. I'm gonna go for a walk.

1067
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,320
Jaime, just...

1068
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,000
Let me go talk to him.
I think I know where he's going.

1069
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,440
<i>Cabezón,</i> wait up.

1070
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,160
God.

1071
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,760
There he is.
I knew I'd find you out here.

1072
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,480
Like a cat, Jaime.

1073
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,240
Are you okay, dude?

1074
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,536
I'm sorry for yelling at you, Rudy.
I shouldn't have yelled you, but...

1075
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:36,560
Look.

1076
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,120
It's not lost on me

1077
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,840
that your situation is a little bit
out of the ordinary.

1078
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,000
Yeah, we're...

1079
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,440
We're resilient people.

1080
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:51,200
Life will continue to hit us
with curve balls, and...

1081
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,120
difference is, when we get hit,
we get stronger.

1082
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,680
Look at your old man.
He brought me here from Sonora.

1083
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:02,920
I was ten. I think he was 19.

1084
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,600
And people think
crossing the border is hard.

1085
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,600
Yeah, it's hard,
but you know what's harder?

1086
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:11,440
The next 20 years after,
I mean, <i>la chinga.</i>

1087
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:17,280
But your <i>viejo</i> would work
16 hours a day, bust his ass.

1088
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,360
Any <i>jale</i> he could get his hands on.

1089
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,960
Day laborer, bus boy, waiter.

1090
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,960
He was a mechanic,
he did everything, dishwasher.

1091
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,480
To get ahead.

1092
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:29,080
And to get us all here
and to keep us all together.

1093
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,800
And not that he wanted to, he had to.

1094
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,120
That's what we come from.

1095
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,720
The universe has sent you a gift,
Jaime.

1096
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,800
And you have to figure out
what you're going to do with it.

1097
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,080
Maybe this did all happen
for a reason.

1098
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,200
Maybe it's time
that we get our own hero.

1099
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,600
And not just some foot up our ass.

1100
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,576
Hey, but what do I know, huh?

1101
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,760
I'm just some failed promise

1102
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,440
that sleeps
in his brother's living room.

1103
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:00,360
Don't say that, man.

1104
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,600
You're not a failed promise.

1105
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,760
Come on, you're the shit!
You know it.

1106
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:07,080
- I am the shit.
- Yeah.

1107
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,920
And... And I love you.

1108
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,760
And I love you too, <i>cabezón.</i>
Yeah, all right.

1109
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,520
Guys?

1110
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,320
Do you hear that?

1111
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,200
That's Victoria.

1112
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,400
Where are they going?

1113
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,880
Home.

1114
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,600
You're wasting too much water.

1115
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:42,440
How many times have I told you guys
not to leave plates everywhere?

1116
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:44,720
Look, I almost forgot the tea.

1117
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,080
Hurry.

1118
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,720
- It's always my fault.
- Yeah.

1119
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,320
Everything okay?

1120
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:15,720
Guys?

1121
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,280
I think there's somebody
at the window.

1122
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,160
<i>Jaime Reyes,
come out with your hands up.</i>

1123
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,480
<i>Turn yourself in.</i>

1124
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,600
<i>We are authorized
to use deadly force.</i>

1125
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,160
<i>Jaime Reyes,
come out with your hands up...</i>

1126
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,680
<i>Turn yourself in.</i>

1127
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,400
<i>We are authorized
to use deadly force.</i>

1128
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,440
Okay. Okay.

1129
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,800
I'm gonna fly. I'm gonna fly.

1130
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,480
Let's do this.

1131
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:50,760
Yeah!

1132
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,760
Yeah, no chance.

1133
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,840
Now!

1134
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,360
Dude, no worries.

1135
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,160
- Just take your time.
- Thanks, Jenny.

1136
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,200
- You gotta force it to come out.
- What do you...

1137
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,160
- You're a genius.
- What... I know. What'd I say?

1138
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:14,816
You said this thing's
gonna protect me, right?

1139
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,360
- I...
- It's not gonna let me die?

1140
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,720
No. I mean, when you die...

1141
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,536
- All right, let's see if it works.
- I wouldn't test it.

1142
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,680
- No... Jaime!
- Wait... Jaime!

1143
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,320
Well, back to the Tacoma, I guess.

1144

Yeah.

1145

1149
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,560
Breach team, go.

1150
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,080
On me.

1151

Hands up! Watch your two!

1162
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,920
Miss Kord, we found the family.

1163
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,696

No...

1172

Get on the ground. On the ground!

1173
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:04,440
Get down, now! Let's go, now!

1174
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,600
The kid's not there.

1175
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:09,760
Find him!

1176
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,120
Is he inside?

1177
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,560
Where is he?

1178
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,280
Where is he?

1179
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,720
Where is he?

1180
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,400
I could use
that arsenal right about now.

1181

<i>Thought you'd never ask.</i>

Hell, yeah!

1183
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:36,480
Nice work, Khaji.

1184
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:37,560
You guys okay?

1185
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,840
- Jaime?
- Sorry, I'm late, Mom.

1186
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,560
Magnificent.

Wait, what?

1188

Look, don't shoot.
I don't wanna hurt you guys.

Fire!

1190

Oh, my God. I'm bulletproof.

Let's see what you can do.

1193
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,600
Target the family.

1194

<i>- Engage.</i>

Okay, let's see what you got.

1198

<i>Eliminating threats.</i>

1199
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,520
What? No, Khaji, no killing.

1200
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,120
Yeah, that's more like it.

1201
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:28,680
Get out of here.

01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:01,040
After 15 years, everything we've done

1299
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:03,400
every sacrifice we've made

1300
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,440
has led to this moment.

1301
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:10,000
Finally, the power of the Scarab
will be ours.

1302
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,200
Almost there.

1303
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:14,440
We are going
to change the world, Carapax.

1304
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:15,600
Are you ready?

1305
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,040
I'm ready.

1306
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,920
Is this thing bulletproof?

1307
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,200
<i>Nombre.</i>

1308
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:39,200
Well, do you guys
wanna see Dad's toys?

1309
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,480
Wait, is that Kabloom bubble gum?

1310
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,760
Oh, no, no.
That's not what you think it is.

1311
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,880
It's just a special prototype

1312
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:54,200
my dad was designing for me
when I was little.

1313
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,200
Do these things work?

1314
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:58,920
Some of them.

1315
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:00,800
Sometimes.

1316
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,280
Oh, that's the Bug Shield.

1317
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,120
Try pressing another button.

1318
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:18,720
Yeah, you know what?
I think I'm keeping this one.

1319
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:25,160
Okay, so,
how are we supposed to learn

1320
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:26,480
how to use these things?

1321
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:29,880
Nana?

1322
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,360
How do you know
how to hold that so perfectly?

1323
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:45,880
This is where they took Jaime.

1324
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:49,600
Pago is a Caribbean island
off the coast of Cuba

1325
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:51,960
that Kord bought from Batista
in the '50s.

1326
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:53,920
The place is a fortress.

1327
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:56,200
Okay, how the hell
are we gonna get in there?

1328
01:15:58,840 --> 01:15:59,880
What the hell?

1329
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:02,720
Mili, one day, we gonna have to talk
about Nana's revolutionary past.

1330
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,800
Her what?

1331
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:06,880
Let me see it.

1332
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,240
Yeah, the generators are here.

1333
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,320
We could blow them up
and knock power out.

1334
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:25,560
<i>Muy bien.</i>

1335
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:35,360
Damn, Nana.

1336
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,280
Hey, who are you?

1337
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,280
What're you doing?

1338
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,056
Get me out of this thing, please?

1339
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:04,440
Is there a problem, Sanchez?

1340
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,120
I'm sorry.

1341
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,840
You're sorry?
What does that even mean?

1342
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,160
Tell her to get me out of this!

1343
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:14,840
It's okay. It's okay.

1344
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,360
Yeah. Listen, kid.

1345
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:20,320
The Scarab chose you, that's true.

1346
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:25,400
But it doesn't belong to you.
It belongs to me.

1347
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:28,000
But now that you've activated it

1348
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:31,440
we can transfer its code
directly into the OMAC.

1349
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,800
What are you even talking about?

1350
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:35,040
No, no, Miss Kord. It could kill him.

1351
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,440
Oh, bummer.

1352
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:40,280
Well, but sacrifices have to be made
for the greater good.

1353
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:43,480
And this is yours, Jaime Reyes.

1354
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:44,840
Do it, Sanchez.

1355
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:47,400
With all due respect,
my name again is not Sanchez.

1356
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:49,400
Get me outta this thing!

1357
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:54,960
Damn it.

1358
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:08,680
Bug.

1359
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,680
- Rudy.
- Yeah, I see it.

1360
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,080
You're going too fast!

1361
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:17,840
Here goes nothing.

1362
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,240
Hold on!

1363
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:28,160
All right.

1364
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:29,560
Incoming!

1365
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:30,840
Brace for impact!

1366
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:45,920
Let's go! Let's go!

1367
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:48,880
- On the wall!
- Engage! Engage.

1368
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,400
Rudy, do something.

1369
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,200
Rudy, we need to move.
We need to move.

1370
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:10,840
Here we go!

1371
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:17,800
Okay.

1372
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:34,760
Get out of the way. Sorry!

1373
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,160
- It's like I can't miss.
- Right there! Right there!

1374
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,760
Twenty points!

1375
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:02,560
Activating cloaking system.

1376
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:05,800
<i>Activating bug fart.</i>

1377
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:15,000
Take that!

1378
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,960
- Yeah, this way. Come on.
- Okay.

1379
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,440
I know you can hear me.

1380
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:57,200
Just let me out!

1381
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:08,840
I'll keep it safe.

1382
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,200
Start the transfer.

1383
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,440
And when it's complete, kill the kid.

1384
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,400
Get me out of here!

1385
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:16,576
But, Miss Kord,
we could learn so much

1386
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:17,696
from his connection to the Scarab...

1387
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:19,616
We can learn a lot more
if we take it off his corpse.

1388
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:22,480
Let me out! No! No!

1389
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,760
Milagro, here, hide!

1390
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:52,680
Holy shit.

1391
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:54,960
Okay, I think we're good.

1392
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,200
What the...

1393
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:06,760
Victoria, you crazy bitch.

1394
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,200
What the hell is this?

1395
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,240
Fully operational OMAC systems.

1396
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,200
Enough to build an entire army.

1397
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,040
Miss Kord, this isn't looking good.

1398
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,120
What's going on?

1399
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,096
Oh, no. The Scarab download
is generating too much power.

1400
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,120
Our systems are spiking.

1401
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:34,680
What does it mean?

1402
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,360
The transfer is killing him.

1403
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:39,440
He can't die
before the transfer is completed.

1404
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:40,640
His pulse is dropping.

1405
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,520
Well, just fix it!

1406
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,800
Hey, <i>flaco.</i>

1407
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:16,720
Dad.

1408
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:20,920
What's going on?

1409
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:26,080
What are you doing here?

1410
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:31,240
You know.

1411
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,800
No. <i>Apá.</i>

Milagro, here.

1414
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,160
Help me with these.

1415
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:15,840
Jaime.

1416
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,040
This is not your time.

1417
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:22,320
You have to go back.

1418
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:25,960
Please.

1419
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,400
I understand everything now.

1420
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:33,200
My destiny was to be here with you.

1421
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:34,520
In this moment.

1422
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,600
To help you cross into it.

1423
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:48,800
This is your purpose.

1424
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:22,520
It's time for you
to accept your destiny, Jaime.

1425
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:37,920
How am I gonna do this without you?

1426
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:44,080
How am I gonna know what to do?

1427
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:02,920
I love you too, Papi.

1428
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:04,920
Go.

1429
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:23,280
Something's happening.

1430
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:24,800
What?

1431
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,240
His brainwaves, they're syncing
with the Scarab's frequency.

1432
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:29,120
Right there. They're connecting.

1433
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:35,840
I need you, Khaji!

1434
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,320
They're becoming one.

1435
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:52,680
We've got the code?

1436
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:53,920
The transfer's complete.

1437
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
The code is ours.

1438
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:56,080
It's working!

1439
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:13,000
Oh, no.

1440
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:15,840
Go...

1441
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,240
Okay. Here we go.

1442
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:55,120
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah.

1443
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,800
No...

1444
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:17,280
Sanchez, stop him!

1445
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:18,760
Oh, shit.

1446
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:31,160
What?

1447
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:33,360
Get your family
and get off this island, okay?

1448
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:34,920
- Wait... My family?
- Quickly!

1449
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,080
What do you mean my family?

1450
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:38,280
Go!

1451
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:41,000
Sanchez, you moron.
What are you doing?

1452
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:45,320
My name is not Sanchez, fucker!

1453
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:48,920
It's Jose Francisco Morales
Rivera de la Cruz!

1454
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:52,800
What are you doing?

1455
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:56,400
Stop him, Carapax.

1456
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:00,920
Go. I'll be fine.

1457
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:05,640
Okay, Khaji, come on.

1458
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:09,560
Okay. All right, Khaji, activate!

1459

<i>Rebooting.</i>

1460

01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:17,640
Oh, God. Oh, no.

1462
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:25,960
- Go...
- Okay...

1463
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:30,320
Milagro, wait.

1464
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:32,560
- Oh, no...
- What's wrong?

1465
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:33,760
No, watch out!

1466
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:43,160
Jenny.

1467
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:45,400
Jenny?

1468
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:48,160
Jenny!

1469
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:57,840
Finally, I can feel it.

1470
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:11,720
Now this look really suits you.

1471
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:16,280
Okay.

1472
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:20,120
Okay, Khaji. All right, Khaji-Da.

1473
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:22,000
You got this. You can do this.

1474
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,520
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

Freeze!

1478
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:48,200
Stay right there!

1479

Come on.

1480
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:52,280
Don't move.

1481
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:55,360
Take him down.

1482
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:08,400
Nana?

1483
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:12,920
Okay.

1484
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,360
Where did you learn
to shoot like that?

1485
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:20,040
I'll tell you later. Come on!

1486
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:36,480
Keep your eyes peeled.

1487
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,240
Come on! Let's go!

1488
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:21,360
Milagro!

1489
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:29,560
Jennifer...

1490
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:32,840
What a mess you have made.

1491
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:36,280
Let's go. On your feet. Get up!

1492
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:40,960
- Nana, come on. Rudy, hurry!
- There's your son, my daughter.

1493
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:42,800
<i>Amá.</i>

1494
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,800
I'm so glad you're back,
we were so worried about you.

1495
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:49,320
Yeah.

1496
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:54,160
- Milagro.
- Where is she?

1497
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:55,680
Milagro and Jenny. They're in there.

1498
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:56,920
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

1499
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,760
Okay, I need to head back in there,
okay?

1500
01:32:58,840 --> 01:32:59,880
Yeah. What about the suit?

1501
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:01,336
It's not working right now.
I can't deal with it.

1502
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:02,480
- Jaime.
- Yes?

1503
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,400
Come here.

1504
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:05,480
Okay.

1505
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:07,800
Rudy, what's that
<i>chongo</i> thing called again?

1506
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:09,160
Khaji-Da.

1507
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:10,600
Right.

1508
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:13,160
I know you can hear me, Khaji-Da.

1509
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:16,360
I want you both to get it together.

1510
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:18,520
Find your strength, <i>mijito.</i>

1511
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:22,680
Use the pain we're feeling
and turn it into power.

1512
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,040
I want you to go back in there...

1513
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:34,560
I found one of them.

1514
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:42,520
Sick.

1515
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:45,360
- Drop your weapon.
- Oh, goddamn it.

1516
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,000
Hey! Assholes!

1517

<i>Rebooting complete.</i>

01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:14,200
- I'm out.
- I'm out.

1520
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:16,160
You ready, Khaji?

1521
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:20,600
Come on, let's get it.

1522
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:21,800
Who's first?

1523
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:30,120
Oh, you want some?

1524
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:38,920
Wait... Watch out!

1525
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,040
Engage the target.

1526
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:48,040
Let's go!

1527
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:58,800
Oh, man, there's more.

1528
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:14,280
Grab him!

1529
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,240
What the hell? Get 'em off of me!

1530
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:18,440
<i>With pleasure.</i>

1531

- Thanks, Khaji.
<i>- De nada.</i>

1532
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:23,880

<i>One more left.</i>

Come on.

1536
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:40,400
Come on.

1537
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:42,280
Nice slap.

1538
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:44,120
Come on.

1539
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:49,960
Okay, I deserve that one.

1540
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:53,440
I thought I'd never see you again.

1541
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:58,520
I told you I wasn't going anywhere.

1542
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:00,520
- Well, you did.
- Yeah, that wasn't my...

You're safe. I thought I lost you.

1547

No, no. Look.

1548
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:12,320
Hey. Wait... Where's Jenny?

1549
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:14,680
We got separated. I don't know.

1550
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:15,800
Okay, we have to find her.

1551
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,816
Okay, we're gonna find her
before the others do because I...

1552
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,000
Watch out!

1553
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
What the hell was that?

1554
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:27,400
<i>OMAC incoming, Jaime.</i>

1555

Ah, crap.

1556
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:36,440
Get off!

1557
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:38,360
Okay, let's do this, Khaji!

1558
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:39,960
Give me rockets or something.

1559
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:41,120
<i>Deploying blasters.</i>

1560
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:45,680
Okay, now give me blades.

01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:47,560
Okay, now give me...

<i>Careful, he's stronger than before.</i>

1563
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:53,160
Okay, I get it.

1564
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:58,400
Okay, which way do we go?

1565
01:36:58,480 --> 01:36:59,696
Go to the Bug Ship. It's that way.

1566
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:01,880
- But where are you going?
- I'm gonna get <i>cabezón.</i> Go!

1567
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:14,560
<i>Critical wing damage.</i>

1568

Scratch my back?
Well, I'll scratch yours.

1569
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,040
All right, big boy.

1570
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,280
You do not deserve this power!

1571
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:41,640
I thought you'd hit harder than that.

1572
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:47,280
Okay, we need something else, Khaji.

1573
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,200
<i>Accessing energy reactor.</i>

1574

1575
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:00,120
All right, you wanna dance, huh?

1576
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:01,720
Now, give me a sword.

1577
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:06,440
So I can make whatever weapons
I want, huh?

1578
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:09,040
<i>Whatever you can imagine,
I can create.</i>

1579

01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:18,080
<i>Ooh, nice choice.</i>

01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:35,760
Yeah!

Come on. That's all you got?

1585
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:41,080
<i>Let's not get ahead of ourselves,

Khaji, don't worry. We got this.

1587
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:57,800
Okay, this is a little harder
than I thought.

1588
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,760
<i>Regenerative systems critical.</i>

01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:07,960
There can only be one of us.

1591
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:09,240
Khaji, do something!

1592
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,120
What's wrong? Can't breathe?

1593
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:37,640
<i>Jaime, I cannot protect you anymore.</i>

1594

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

Khaji, stay with me.

1596
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:49,040
You are still a scared little boy.

1597
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:07,040
I told you
the love you feel for your family

1598
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:08,640
makes you weak.

1599
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:13,920
Hey!

1600
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:18,560
Come on! Come and get me.

1601
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,400
I'll keep him here, man, Come on!

1602
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:22,720
Rudy.

1603
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,000
Oh, shit.

1604
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:26,400
No!

1605
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:29,920
Rudy!

1606
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:50,200
Khaji-Da!

1607
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:02,440
Your OMAC has failed.

1608
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:04,680
Jennifer, you don't know
what the OMAC is.

1609
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:07,280
Carapax is just a prototype.

1610
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:09,080
This is the only thing
that's important.

1611
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:10,600
The Scarab code.

1612
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:13,960
With this,
I can make a thousand Carapaxes.

1613
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:16,280
This is the culmination
of my life's work.

1614
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:21,120
This is the Kord legacy.
This is our legacy.

1615
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:25,040
Not mine. I'll make sure of it.

1616
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:29,880
You're gonna side
with that Edge Key trash

1617
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:32,200
over your own family?

1618
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:35,560
That Edge Key trash

1619
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,160
knows more about family
than you ever will.

1620
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:42,640
I know. No, I know about family.

1621
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:46,320
I know about my family
that overlooked me

1622
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,000
just the way that you are now

1623
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:50,440
because you are just like
your pathetic father.

1624
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:53,480
Who didn't have the guts
to do what was necessary

1625
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:54,600
for the greater good.

1626
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:58,800
I wish that Ted were here now
to see this.

1627
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:32,240
No! We're not done!

1628
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:41,560
<i>Jaime, threat disarmed.</i>

1629
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:43,160
<i>You're losing control.</i>

1630
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:45,280
You think that you could beat me?

1631
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:49,200
You should have finished me
when you had the chance!

1632
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:55,280
<i>OMAC neutralized.
Recommend to disengage.</i>

1633
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:04,240
What are you doing?

1634
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:06,680
<i>We are not killers, Jaime.</i>

1635
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:08,600
<i>Let him go.</i>

1636
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:10,400
What about Dad?

1637
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:13,480
What about Rudy?

1638
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:17,720
<i>During the transfer,
I unlocked his memories.</i>

1639
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:19,600
<i>Let me show you.</i>

1640
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,760
What if he doesn't survive
the procedure?

1641
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:27,280
Then we'll just get another one.

1642
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:28,480
It could kill him.

1643
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:30,800
Sacrifices must be made
for the greater good.

1644
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:35,560
<i>This country
is confronting a brutal challenge</i>

1645
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:38,160
<i>from guerrillas armed and supported</i>

1646
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:40,360
<i>by others outside Guatemala.</i>

1647
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:42,976
<i>The United States is committed
to restoring democracy</i>

1648
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:47,080
<i>and to address the root causes
of the violent insurgency.</i>

1649
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:49,320
<i>We know about the problems</i>

1650
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:51,120
<i>confronting Guatemala.</i>

1651
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:54,000
Perfect. Round them up.

1652
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:05,720
Mama!

1653
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:08,680
Ignacio!

1654
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:30,880
<i>Do you understand now?</i>

1655
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:44,280
Hey! <i>Cabezón!</i>

1656
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:36,200
You're wrong.

1657
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:42,120
That love
that I have for my family...

1658
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:46,960
that's what makes me strong.

1659
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:00,960
All right, give it to me. Come on.

1660
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:02,640
- This?
- Yes, that.

1661
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:07,560
No!

1662
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:09,720
Now what have you done?

1663
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:12,240
No...

1664
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:13,400
Jenny?

1665
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:15,480
It's okay.

1666
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:17,800
Carapax, kill them.

1667
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:19,120
Kill them both!

1668
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:31,440
Okay.

1669
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:33,000
What are you doing?
They're getting...

1670
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:34,160
Okay.

1671
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:36,480
No.

1672
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:37,640
Wait, Jenny, wait.

1673
01:46:37,720 --> 01:46:39,216
Go back to the Bug Ship.
I'll be right behind you.

1674
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:40,320
- What?
- I promise.

1675
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:42,000
We can be partners.

1676
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:45,400
I'll fix it.

1677
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,200
I'll fix you.

1678
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:48,840
We can find another Sanchez.

1679
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:54,600
Do you remember everything
that I've done for you?

1680
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:06,120
No.

1681
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:08,440
Khaji, what's he doing?

1682
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:10,720
<i>He's maxing out
the energy reactor in his suit.</i>

1683
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,240
<i>I advise we back away.</i>

1684
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:20,720
Ignacio.

1685
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:28,920
What?

1686
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
What? No! What are you doing?

1687
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:32,840
Stop! No!

1688
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:33,920
No!

1689
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:39,960
<i>Sacrifices must be made
for the greater good.</i>

1690
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:42,080
No! Please! No!

1691
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:43,800
Ignacio, no!

1692
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:46,360
<i>I suggest we run.</i>

1693
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:48,240
Okay. Oh, shit.

1694
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:07,200
Milagro, pull!

1695
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:17,120
Rocío!

1696
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:18,920
Step on it, woman!

1697
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:33,880
You okay?

1698
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:57,080
Mili.

1699
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:00,240
<i>Cabezón.</i>

1700
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:01,560
Rudy?

1701
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:03,960
Rudy!

1702
01:49:08,120 --> 01:49:10,000
- How?
- Yeah. You know...

1703
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:15,640
<i>- Amá.</i>
- Nana.

1704
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:17,240
<i>Ay, mijito.</i>

1705
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:52,080
<i>It is a delicate moment
for Kord Industries.</i>

1706
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:55,280
<i>And of course, we mourn
the loss of Victoria Kord.</i>

1707
01:49:55,880 --> 01:49:57,480
<i>But I'm looking forward.</i>

1708
01:49:57,560 --> 01:50:00,880
<i>As I was saying,
we will no longer make weapons.</i>

1709
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:04,000
<i>What I want to do is honor
my father's legacy.</i>

1710
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:05,480
<i>It's not about destruction</i>

1711
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:07,440
<i>it's about building a better future.</i>

1712
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:09,520
<i>It's not about taking
from the community</i>

1713
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:10,920
<i>but giving back to the community.</i>

1714
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:22,520
What are we gonna do now?

1715
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:28,640
<i>Ánimo,</i> Rudy, okay?

1716
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:31,960
We're gonna get through this,
we always do.

1717
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:35,360
The Reyes are here.

1718
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:37,280
Guys.

1719
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:33,680
Nana.

1720
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:37,280
Oh, honey, hold on.
I'm coming, eh. Oh, dear.

1721
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:38,360
Okay.

1722
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:40,480
Thank you, honey.

1723
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:45,320
- Well, family.
- Thank you.

1724
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:51,560
Where, <i>Amá?</i> We don't have a house.

1725
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:54,440
Rudy, we have, like, half
the Edge Keys in our yard right now.

1726
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:55,776
I'm sure they'll be happy
to help us out.

1727
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:58,080
<i>Sí, claro.</i>
Of course, they're going to help.

1728
01:51:58,160 --> 01:52:00,400
Yeah, until when?
Until Kord pushes us out?

1729
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:01,920
I wouldn't worry about that.

1730
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:04,520
Jenny.

1731
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:05,920
Hi.

1732
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:09,320
I think it's time
to return the Edge Keys

1733
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:10,720
to the people that made it great.

1734
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:12,976
Sounds like the Reyes family's
rubbing off a little bit

1735
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,120
on Jenny Kord, no?

1736
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:16,240
Kord has a lot to learn
from the Edge Keys.

1737
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:18,360
Starting with you, Rudy.

1738
01:52:18,640 --> 01:52:19,976
Wait a minute,
did you tell her to say that?

1739
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,160
Rudy, I didn't say shit.

1740
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:23,536
That sounds like something that
you would say to her to tell me.

1741
01:52:23,560 --> 01:52:25,440
And don't worry, Kord Industries

1742
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:27,480
will fix and give you back
your house.

1743
01:52:29,720 --> 01:52:30,760
Excuse me.

1744
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:32,440
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1745
01:52:33,120 --> 01:52:34,920
- Here, Rudy.
- What's this?

1746
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,560
I felt really bad,
so I got you a new tailgate.

1747
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:43,760
How do you like that, cupcake?

1748
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:46,840
Wow, it's blue.
A little on the nose, no?

1749
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:48,880
- Rudy.
- Rudy. "Thank you."

1750
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:50,536
- I'll think about it.
- Yeah, take a look.

1751
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:52,920
- Come on, help me like it.
- I'm inheriting that.

1752
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:56,280
All right, I gotta go.

1753
01:52:57,760 --> 01:52:58,840
Yeah.

1754
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:00,920
How about I walk you out?

1755
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:03,440
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

1756
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:13,240
So...

1757
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:15,880
when am I gonna see you again?

1758
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:18,800
Soon. I hope.

1759
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:21,840
Where are you headed?

1760
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:23,520
To my dad's.

1761
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:26,200
I want to look
at my mom's paintings again.

1762
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:29,360
I forgot how beautiful they are.

1763
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:31,080
Cool, cool.

1764
01:53:35,240 --> 01:53:36,440
What if I gave you a ride?

1765
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:44,200
How?

1766
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:46,480
<i>I feel a surge of blood
rushing towards your mid-region.</i>

1767
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:47,560
Stop!

1768
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:50,200
No... Not you.

1769
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:56,680
What's it saying?

1770
01:53:56,760 --> 01:53:57,760
Nothing.

1771
01:54:24,680 --> 01:54:25,680
Okay.

1772
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:27,280
Hold on.

1773
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:30,280
Okay.

1774
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:00,200
<i>Hello?</i>

1775
01:56:00,520 --> 01:56:02,040
<i>Oh, my God, it's working. Okay.</i>

1776
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:04,560
<i>Whoever turned on my computer</i>

1777
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:06,560
<i>get a message to my daughter, Jenny.</i>

1778
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:08,000
<i>Jenny Kord.</i>

1779
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:10,680
<i>Please, tell her that I love her</i>

1780
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:12,320
<i>and that I'm sorry</i>

1781
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:14,880
<i>and her dad is alive.</i>

1782
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:18,640
<i>Ted Kord is alive.</i>

1783
02:02:03,120 --> 02:02:04,640
<i>Oh, that's sexy.</i>
