1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,400
{\an8}Ever since you began to build your empire,
you have had a crutch to lean on.

2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,640
[Michael] <i>Mum, I swear
in the name of Almighty God,</i>

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,840
<i>I will take revenge on Tommy Shelby.</i>

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,480
That, my friend,
is the finest opium in the world.

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,960
Perhaps we can meet after you've
spoken to your wife's uncle, Jack Nelson.

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,360
Tommy Shelby wants
to do business with Jack Nelson?

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,840
So speak to your uncle
and get me out of here.

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,280
If he doesn't want to buy my opium,
I will sell to the East Boston Jews.

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,040
It's Ruby, she's not well.

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,160
I'm coming home.

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,880
[Polly] <i>There will be a war in this family
and one of you will die.</i>

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,160
[Michael] <i>You've been too busy
to punish the people who killed her.</i>

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,160
<i>How is the family?</i>

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,239
[Ruby] Daddy!

15
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,600
Hello, Ruby.

16
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,680
[Ruby laughs]

17
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,680
[Tommy] Come here.

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,760
Let me see you. I missed you.
I missed you.

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,040
-That's the Black Madonna. [kisses]
-[Charles] What presents did you get us?

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,080
[Tommy] Son.

21
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,440
She's all better, Tommy.
You came back for nothing.

22
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,520
But I'm glad you're back.

23
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,400
Right, before we do anything else,
we're going to go out for a drive.

24
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,480
-Okay? Let's go.
-What about me?

25
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,560
Yeah, you come too. Come on.

26
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,680
A drive where?

27
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,240
I've asked the driver
to take us to see Dr Robert.

28
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,200
-To have a look at Ruby.
-Why?

29
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,560
The appointment is in one hour.
You can stay here or you can come.

30
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,680
Right.

31
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,680
[Tommy] Right. Let's go.

32
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,040
[children playing]

33
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,760
[grunts]

34
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,320
[gags and spits]

35
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,600
[coughs]

36
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,680
[door creaks open and shuts]

37
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,680
[Lizzie] Tommy?

38
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,680
Yeah?

39
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,560
It was all good. Everything was clear.

40
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,800
[exhales]

41
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,120
That is a relief.

42
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,080
-That's a relief.
-Yeah.

43
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,360
-Driver's bringing the car around.
-[Ruby] Dad.

44
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,520
[Lizzie] Hiya.

45
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,880
Come here.

46
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,760
When did you last sleep?

47
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,440
Not much since we last spoke on the phone.

48
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,400
Now you know Ruby is all clear,
you can sleep.

49
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,480
Yeah.

50
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,320
Lizzie, I'm very happy
that Ruby's results are clear.

51
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,480
But still you won't sleep.

52
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,000
I will speak to Johnny
and I will speak to Esmeralda.

53
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,120
[sighs]

54
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,280
[sighs] We could be on holiday.

55
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,320
We could be up a mountain in America.

56
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,240
That wouldn't have been possible.

57
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,880
The man I'm dealing with
is coming to London. I need to be there.

58
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,280
[exhales] No escape.

59
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,400
We will escape, Lizzie.

60
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,400
One last deal to be done.

61
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,080
It'll be difficult.

62
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,200
-[Lizzie sighs]
-Difficulties are to be expected.

63
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,840
This is why I must move from item to item.

64
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,360
Do you feel that?

65
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,560
Do you feel anything?

66
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,320
You know, you talk as if
you're watching everything on a screen.

67
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,480
When we go home... When we go home,
we'll give the kids to Frances,

68
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,320
and then you and me will go to bed.

69
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,840
And I will be the next item.

70
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,680
-That's how it feels now, Tommy.
-[sighs] Yeah.

71
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,200
Everything on a list.

72
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,200
-Hey, baby.
-[Ruby] When are we going home?

73
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,040
[thunder rumbling]

74
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,560
[glass shatters]

75
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,360
[thunder cracks]

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,720
[Lizzie] Tommy? Tommy?

77
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,040
[both grunting]

78
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,560
[Lizzie] Tommy? Tommy, what's happened?

79
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,240
Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

80
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,280
-[Tommy grunting]
-Come here, come here.

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,840
[Tommy gasps]

82
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,240
[Lizzie] What's happening?

83
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,000
<i>Tommy!</i>

84
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,160
-Love.
-[both gasping]

85
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,960
[exhales sharply]

86
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:18,600
It is four years,
one month, six days, since I had a drink.

87
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,360
My head is clear.

88
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,760
I am myself.

89
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,520
Is this the first time?

90
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,360
Once on the ship back. Not as bad.

91
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,440
Tommy.

92
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,800
You need to see a doctor.

93
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,960
I have work to do.

94
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,200
[scoffs]

95
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,880
It's the work that's to blame.

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,200
The people you meet,
the lies that you tell.

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,960
We've got to keep going
until this Boston business is done.

98
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,160
Then we rest.

99
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,280
Then we Peaky Blinders fucking rest.

100
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,640
[rain pattering]

101
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,880
[woman] Comrades,
before we end this planning meeting

102
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,520
and send you out into the rain...

103
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,720
[crowd laughing]

104
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,080
...we have a surprise.

105
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,240
He just arrived back
from a trade mission to America.

106
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,240
He came back early and he has insisted
on addressing you volunteers in person.

107
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,280
[crowd exclaims]

108
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,720
[woman] Comrades, your Labour
representative for South Birmingham,

109
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,560
-Mr Thomas Shelby, MP, OBE.
-[crowd cheering]

110
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,400
I bring with me,

111
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,360
on the train from London,
a message from Westminster.

112
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,880
No! No, no, no. Not a message.
Not a message.

113
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,840
An instruction, in fact.

114
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,200
[crowd mutters]

115
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,520
You must be silent.

116
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,080
[crowd exclaims]

117
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,920
You must say nothing!

118
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,560
Say nothing
about the present situation in this city.

119
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,480
Say nothing about hunger.

120
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,880
Say nothing about jobs.
Say nothing about pay.

121
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:42,159
But those in greener pastures,
they may speak.

122
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,320
[crowd exclaims]

123
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,240
They may raise their voices!

124
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,360
[crowd shouts]

125
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,039
But here in the smoke, you men and women,

126
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,160
Irish and Italian and English,
who support the socialist cause...

127
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,520
Even your socialist
cats and dogs and canaries...

128
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,560
[crowd laughs]

129
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,560
You must hush

130
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,080
because the king

131
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,360
and all the king's horses
and all the king's men...

132
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,520
[crowd laughs]

133
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,720
...want you to be silent.

134
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,760
But it is you, my friends,
who must suffer the cuts in wages

135
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,200
-and in welfare and in dignity!
-[crowd exclaims]

136
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,680
And you must not complain
'cause that would be unpatriotic.

137
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,640
You soldiers who have fought in France,
you are traitors if you speak up.

138
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,360
You veterans of their wars
and their booms and their busts,

139
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,040
it is you who must take the blows
and carry the burdens

140
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,120
for the sake of those in greener pastures
who bellow at you...

141
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,280
[slams fist]

142
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,160
"Silence!"

143
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,560
[crowd yells]

144
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,880
Well, watch this, comrades.

145
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,040
I will not be silent.

146
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,000
[man] Never again.

147
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,480
Not this Englishman.

148
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,600
[crowd exclaims and cheers]

149
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,280
No silence from me!

150
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,080
No silence from me
because I have heard your voices

151
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,600
when you come to me and tell me
about the cries of your hungry children.

152
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,280
And I will gather up
every single one of those cries

153
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,280
and I will take 'em with me
on the train back to Westminster.

154
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,280
And I will let 'em out of the bag
in the House of Commons,

155
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,680
and let them try and silence that, eh?

156
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,640
[crowd cheers]

157
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,520
[Tommy] Shouldn't that involve
some sharing of the burden?

158
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,480
All of us taking
a smaller slice of the cake, eh?

159
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,800
After all, it's bloody us
who bakes the cake

160
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,960
and makes the cars and melts the metal.

161
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,280
And the king, remember him?

162
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,640
The man who ordered all of this.
Shouldn't he be taking some of the cuts?

163
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,520
Some of the blows? Some of the pain?

164
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,600
No or yes?

165
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,800
[crowd exclaims] Yes!

166
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,560
-[shushes]
-[exclaiming stops]

167
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,560
Hush, you working men and women.

168
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,440
Silence.

169
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,160
Good.

170
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,240
Save your voices.

171
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,360
You're gonna need 'em

172
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,560
on Saturday when we rally together,
at the Bull Ring Market!

173
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,480
[crowd cheering]

174
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,760
And together we will raise the roof,
break the damned silence,

175
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,440
and bring down this broken government!

176
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,000
[crowd cheering]

177
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,720
[chanting] Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!

178
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,680
Thank you.

179
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,200
Laura McKee.

180
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,360
-Battalion Commander, Fermanagh, IRA.
-You missed the first and second act.

181
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,120
-[woman] Thank you for coming, Mr Shelby.
-Thank you.

182
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,680
[Laura] The third act was enough.

183
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,880
You both have reasons to hate me and to
want to seek revenge for the killing...

184
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,840
[shushes]

185
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,520
Gypsy tradition.

186
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,560
We do not mention the name
of the dead in company.

187
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:51,720
Laura McKee, in the Shelby family,
business comes before issues of vengeance.

188
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,640
Our beloved departed
would understand and approve.

189
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,960
Let's go, boys.

190
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,280
Our agreement was
we meet in a crowded place.

191
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,680
No need for crowds.

192
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,000
We need you alive.

193
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,640
After you.

194
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,560
You know, Mr Shelby, even though
we've been doing business for a while,

195
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,560
we've never met in person.

196
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,680
You spoke with passion and compassion.

197
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,760
You understand forgiveness.

198
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,120
And you drink water.

199
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,080
Yet I heard from many reliable sources

200
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,840
that you have a reputation
for moral turpitude.

201
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,720
[chuckles and clicks tongue]

202
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,720
"Moral turpitude."

203
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,600
It's a good name for a racehorse.

204
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,240
-You don't know what it means?
-I know what it means.

205
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,520
It means you fuck people.

206
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,960
Fuck people over. Don't give a fuck.

207
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,720
It means you covet and steal
and burn all principles

208
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,440
for the sake of self-interest.

209
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,520
Well, I'm changing, Laura McKee.
And my organisation is also changing.

210
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,200
So what happened in Boston?

211
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,560
Jack Nelson said no.

212
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,480
Are we accepting "no" as an answer?

213
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,240
These are letters...

214
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,160
[clears throat]

215
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,240
...written to and by Jack Nelson
over the last three months.

216
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,480
This...

217
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,120
This is a private letter
from the president of the United States.

218
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,000
Where the fuck did you get this?

219
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,920
[Tommy sighs]

220
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,880
My racehorse "Moral Turpitude"
is just one of many in my stables.

221
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,000
Sometimes, even now,
I'll take her out for a run,

222
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,240
if there is a good cause
that requires her services.

223
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,760
Jack Nelson's coming to London.

224
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,240
Officially, he's coming
to buy liquor import licences.

225
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,520
Unofficially, he's on
a fact-finding mission.

226
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,360
He's coming to measure the strength
of support for fascism in Britain.

227
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,320
He'll report back to the president.

228
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,640
And how does that help us?

229
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,320
In this letter to his son,

230
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,240
Jack Nelson expresses
strong support for fascism.

231
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,000
In this letter,

232
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:06,680
to a friend in Berlin, he says
some interesting things about Jews.

233
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,200
He's not coming to Europe to find facts.

234
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,480
He's coming to find proof
that fascism will prevail.

235
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,320
And you and I
are going to help him in that task.

236
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,960
I thought you were a socialist.

237
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
[inhales]

238
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,640
Well, since I've entered politics,

239
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,440
I've learned that the line doesn't go out
from the middle to the left and the right.

240
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,720
It goes in a circle.

241
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,120
I'll show you.

242
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,320
You go far enough left,

243
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,440
eventually, you'll meet someone
who's gone far enough right

244
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,040
to get to the same place.

245
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,160
Working-class socialists like me,
working-class nationalists like you.

246
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,840
The result...

247
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,800
National Socialism.

248
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,240
And that's me.

249
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,080
In the middle.

250
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:14,000
Just a man trying to make
an honest living in a very dark world.

251
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,440
You have friends in Dublin, Laura McKee,

252
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,680
who are actively fighting
for a fascist Ireland.

253
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,480
And you are acting
on their behalf, ain't you?

254
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,160
When Jack Nelson comes to London,

255
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,960
I can give him access to Oswald Mosley
and to fascist sympathisers

256
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,560
in the House of Commons
and the House of Lords.

257
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,160
Both sides of the divide.

258
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,240
Fascism is quite the thing

259
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,880
among the very best people.

260
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,200
And with your help,
I can also offer him Dublin.

261
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,720
And you think this will allow us
to ship our merchandise to Boston?

262
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,800
Perhaps.

263
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,040
There may be other benefits
for your cause.

264
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,800
All you have to do

265
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,320
is sit with Jack Nelson and talk to him
about a new golden age,

266
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,640
and let him put a pin
in the map of Ireland

267
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
for the president of the United States.

268
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,680
[thudding]

269
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,800
I came to collect Arthur
and put him to bed.

270
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,520
Found him in Garrison Lane
with a syringe in his hand.

271
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,200
[sighs]

272
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,360
"A friend loves at all time,

273
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,720
a brother is born for adversity."

274
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,720
Proverbs 17:17.

275
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,800
Well, I have two brothers in need.

276
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,040
But yours is the more urgent, Tommy.
Will you come with me?

277
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,960
So, Laura McKee,
are you going to help me change the world?

278
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,680
Mr Shelby, this meeting
is not what I expected.

279
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,240
Never is.

280
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,680
Is that a yes or a no?

281
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,960
My answer is yes.

282
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,400
[scoffs]

283
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,400
The answer's always yes.

284
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,720
[Tommy] The back door is unlocked.
You can let yourself out.

285
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,960
And tell your friends back home,
Tommy Shelby has changed.

286
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,560
[train screeching]

287
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,720
[Tommy] Where is he?

288
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,840
[Ada] When I found him,
the syringe was empty.

289
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,520
He's sleeping it off on the cobbles.
Shit, Tommy.

290
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,080
Shit.

291
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,520
-It's all under control, Ada.
-I'm not under fucking control.

292
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,920
I'm not you, Tommy.
And I'm not Polly either.

293
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,240
Even though I'm trying to be.

294
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,760
She would have stopped this.

295
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,520
-We will pull Arthur through this.
-I'm not talking about Arthur.

296
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,920
I'm talking about you. I heard
everything you were saying in there.

297
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,040
Ada, this will be the end of it.

298
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,640
Hear me? This is the way out for us.
And along the way, I will be doing good.

299
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,280
No, along the way, you're gonna
make yourself a lot of money.

300
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,960
All right, fair enough.

301
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,120
Any incidental rewards
for my good work will be welcome.

302
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,400
-But you will get your fair share, sister.
-[scoffs]

303
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,200
And by being among the fascists,
by being among them, I can undermine them.

304
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,920
Polly would approve.

305
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,920
Beneath all the gold and diamonds
and fucking mink and lace,

306
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,480
she was a solid socialist.

307
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,200
[Ada] Look, I know
it's too late for this, Tom, but...

308
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,600
This doorway...

309
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,360
This same fucking doorway.

310
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,720
We used to come here for Dad's beer.

311
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,120
And we were so little,
it took two of us to carry one bucket.

312
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,120
Yeah, I remember.

313
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,440
Look at us now, eh?

314
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,320
Yeah. Fucking look at us.

315
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,960
Take a good look, Tom,

316
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,360
'cause one of us
isn't gonna be here for long.

317
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,480
Fuck! Opium and presidents.

318
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,160
Ada, if you don't want
to help me carry the bucket...

319
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,040
I wouldn't blame you.

320
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,280
But this is my mission.

321
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,520
And I will have no limitations.

322
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,360
Where are you, Tom?

323
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,840
Hmm?

324
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,880
My big brother?

325
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,320
You know, you used to stop
sometimes and laugh.

326
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,240
Do you even remember this place?

327
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,160
You walk into the Garrison like a stranger
and you sip fucking water.

328
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm alive, Ada.

329
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,360
Yeah.

330
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,560
And you're still looking for trouble
big enough to kill you.

331
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,440
Well, I think you might have found it.

332
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,720
I have children, Tommy.

333
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,800
You have to carry this bucket on your own.

334

in the rain in Garrison Alley,

I always thought that opera
was just fat people fucking shouting.

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,200
[Tommy] Yeah? What do you think now?

347
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,880
[Alfie] I think the sound
of a tenor in full passion

348
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,240
reminds me of
the crying out of Italian soldiers

349
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,520
when they had my bayonet inside of them.

350
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,240
Ever since my own death,
I have been somewhat haunted by it.

351
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,880
Dear me.

352
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,880
But, instead of fighting these voices,
I decided to write their songs down

353
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,160
and turn them into an opera of my own.

354
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,960
Do not light that. No, no.

355
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,440
Were you not told I have a condition?

356
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,760
What I was told, Alfie...

357
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,800
is that you have withdrawn
and that you spend your days alone...

358
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,520
obsessing about opera singers.

359
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,320
[Alfie] Opera is not
fucking singing, is it?

360
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,600
It's not singing. It's the sound
that people make before a word.

361
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,760
And I do not allow smoking
because I do need to see fucking clearly.

362
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,720
All right?

363
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,120
What, do you sense
weakness in the Israelite?

364
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,280
Not a sense of weakness, no, Alfie.

365
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,320
A certain knowledge of it.

366
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,720
Since you have been sat here
writing your opera...

367
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,560
a member of your family has died.

368
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,120
Charles Solomons, your uncle.

369
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,320
He ran all the narcotics,

370
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,160
bootlegging, prostitution,
gambling syndicates out of East Boston.

371
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,720
But last January, poor old Charlie, well...

372
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,120
He was shot in the Cotton Club,
in the lavatory,

373
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,680
by men that you know,
and yet you did nothing, Alfie.

374
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,880
Now my opera is called "America"!

375
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,400
America is my fucking masterpiece!

376
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,320
The truth is, your uncle is dead.

377
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,920
Boston is gone.

378
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,400
And you,
once the big man who ran Camden Town,

379
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,400
now can't even extinguish
another man's cigarette.

380
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,840
Let alone his fucking life.

381
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,000
You need favours, Alfie.

382
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,000
I need a fucking final act, right?

383
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,560
Just a final fucking act for my opera.

384
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,720
Yeah?

385
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,200
Alfie,

386
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,240
I think I may have written your final act.

387
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,680
Why don't you sit down
and have a listen, eh?

388
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,520
I have five tons of pure, refined opium,

389
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,800
sitting in one of
my warehouses in Liverpool.

390
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,840
I have safe storage
off the coast of Canada.

391
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,240
I have men willing to distribute it

392
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,520
in Toronto, Quebec, New York and Boston.

393
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,120
The income would be immediate

394
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,080
and will shift
the balance of power in Boston

395
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,680
back in favour of the Solomons family.

396

[Alfie exhales]

397
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,040
In the final act
that I'm giving you, Alfie,

398
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,320
it is you who takes the revenge.

399
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,640
Why would you sell?

400
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,520
The Irish are being difficult.
The Italians are not an option.

401
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,560
Also, Alfie, you are my friend.

402
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,080
-Would you give me credit?
-No.

403
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,600
I will take property.
You own half the warehouses in Camden.

404
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,200
I'll take 'em and knock 'em down.

405
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,920
Build houses
for the needy and the deserving.

406
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,960
Hmm. Oh.

407
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,240
Hmm.

408
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,040
Yeah, well, the...

409
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,080
The Irish have always
been difficult, Tommy,

410
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,200
they have for about fucking 700 years.

411

[sniffs]

412
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,880
You know that I once saw an Irishman

413
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,280
arguing with the statue
of Oliver Cromwell in Parliament Square.

414
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,360
The argument went on for quite a while.

415
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,880
It went into the night
as his little voice echoed

416
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,480
all around the Houses of Parliament
as he got more and more angered.

417
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,840
Oliver Cromwell was reluctant, somewhat,

418
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,120
to answer his legitimate questions.

419
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,400
So angered, in fact, that eventually,

420
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,640
he punched the statue on the nose
and broke his fucking hand.

421
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,240
And there it is, you know,
the Irish Question.

422
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,200
How come you can remember so much
about what happened 200 years ago,

423
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:07,040
but you just can't remember
what fucking happened last night?

424

425

...and you'll be free.

433
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,360
When do you travel to London?

434
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,200
Tomorrow.

435
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,400
I came to say goodbye.

436
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,760
When you go to London,
stay away from the Devil.

437
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,400
Block your fucking ears if you have to.

438

I'll be with you, Michael.

439
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,400
I've been thinking about you.

440
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,200
Only you.

441
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,040
And don't worry about Tommy Shelby.

442
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,160
I have no interest in a dead man.

443
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,960
Jack says he has to die.

444
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,080
Well, you tell Jack to wait.

445
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,320
-If anyone's going to kill Tommy Shelby...
-It will be you.

446
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,360
I know.

447
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,720
I told Jack.

448
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,000
And Jack said, "Okay, let the kid do it."

449
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:58,240
And in return
he can collect the cash that Tommy won't.

450
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,600
Five million dollars.

451
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,840
The Devil will be dead.

452
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,440
The future belongs to us.

453

I'll be wide awake in my big, wide bed,

457

and you'll be
wide awake in this prison cell.

And our souls will come together.

And we'll fuck.

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,000
-Sir...
-Fuck off!

485
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,800
May I ask why a socialist MP
would attend a fascist rally, sir?

486
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,920
[Tommy] Let him in.
Let me answer the question.

487
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,640
Mr Mosley's constituency borders my own.

488
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,560
We've worked together in the past.
He was once a socialist himself.

489
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,440
My role here tonight is to...

490
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,800
To act as a bridge between ideologies.

491
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,280
I'm in the middle.

492
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,480
Mr Shelby, you once shared
a platform with Mr Mosley.

493
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,120
Will you be sharing
the stage with him tonight?

494
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,240
No. I'm simply here
to remind my friend, Mr Mosley,

495
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,320
that the way of
the British people is compromise.

496
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,840
You can print that, pal.

497
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,480
Fucking rag.

498
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,640
[Lizzie sighs]

499
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,640
[Tommy sighs]

500
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,160
Lizzie, you should know
that Mosley's wife died six months ago.

501
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,000
So, give him your condolences, will you?

502
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:02,000
Tonight, he'll be with his mistress,
who is apparently a lady of some standing,

503
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,520
and has given him great comfort
in his time of grief.

504
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,200
[Arthur] Fuck off, you dozy bastard!

505
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,320
Move out of my fucking way!

506
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,120
What is Arthur doing here?

507
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,160
Mosley invited him. I agreed.

508
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,600
Arthur made me a promise,
which he appears to have broken.

509
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,400
[Arthur] Move!

510
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,800
I said fucking move!

511
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,240
-Move, I'm on the fucking list!
-I've tried my best.

512
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,080
-[Arthur] Get the fuck off me!
-He's hid some junk in his sock.

513
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,760
-Okay.
-[Arthur] Move it along!

514
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,400
Get out of my fucking way!

515
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,800
Oi!

516
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,160
Tommy!

517
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,480
-Come on. You're in.
-Tommy.

518
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,080
[Tommy] You're in. Come on, you're in.

519
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,600
-[Arthur] My brother, Tommy.
-[Tommy] Yep.

520
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,200
[Arthur] Johnny Dogs.

521
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,800
Mosley invited me.

522
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,760
-He said, "Wear a black fucking shirt."
-Here you are.

523
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,840
I said, "I'd look like
every other bastard."

524
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,320
-Lizzie!
-Come on.

525
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,320
[Arthur] You're an angel.

526
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,600
I know I've fucking let you down.

527
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,240
I've fucking let you down.
I know I have, all right?

528
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,800
I've fucking said sorry a million times.
I'll say it again. I'm sorry.

529
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,720
-[Tommy] Yep.
-[Arthur] Fucking sorry.

530
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,680
Look at Johnny Dogs,
look at the fucking state of him.

531
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,600
He looks like a fucking waiter.

532
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,240
-[Dogs] Shut up!
-Get me a fucking drink.

533
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,600
Johnny, take your shirt off
and give it to me.

534
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,000
For fuck's sake, Tom.

535
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,560
Take your fucking shirt off
and give it to me now.

536
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,840
Get it off!

537
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,760
Arthur, this is my fault.

538
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,600
-This is my fault.
-Yeah.

539
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,160
Remember, we voted on getting
involved in the opium trade, you voted no.

540
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,720
-I said no.
-Remember?

541
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,520
I overruled you.

542
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,120
-I've been away.
-Where you been, Tom?

543
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,280
Ada tells me you've been
hanging out with Mosley?

544
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,920
-Yeah, in Smethwick.
-Yeah?

545
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,440
At his big, beautiful fucking house.

546
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,880
And they have parties there in Belgravia.

547
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,120
And they give me fucking respect.

548
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,560
And what do you give them?
Snow and junk from the company.

549
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,600
Look at you, brother.
Half of you has gone.

550
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,280
-[Arthur] The fuck!
-[Tommy] Rag and bone.

551
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,080
You fucking slapped me.

552
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,360
You slapped me.

553
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,920
I have to remain unresolved.

554
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,640
Do you understand? Unresolved.

555
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,240
Unresolved in everything!

556
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,240
I have to move between
left and right, light and shade,

557
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,560
and maintain the trust of both.

558
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,160
And I cannot have my brother
wearing a fucking black shirt

559
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,120
on the cover of the <i>Daily Mirror.</i>

560
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,560
If anyone takes my picture in this,

561
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,400
they'll find their fucking camera
under my heel, Tom.

562
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,520
They're throwing petrol bombs
out there, Tommy.

563
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,400
-I thought Ada was taking care of you.
-Ada's got decisions to make

564
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,800
about working with us.

565
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,160
She doesn't know what she wants.

566
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,320
I'll speak to Ada.

567
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,440
-Listen, I'm going home...
-No, you stay there.

568
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,040
I have something for you.

569
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,120
Lizzie, you go with Johnny.
Johnny, take Lizzie to her seat.

570
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,680
I don't have an invitation.

571
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,640
You're wearing a black shirt,
you can do what you like. Go on.

572
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,200
I'll follow you. Go on.

573
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,880
Go on, Dogs.

574
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,640
Get me a fucking drink while you're there.

575
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,640

576
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,120
[distant music and cheering]

577
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,320
I know, Tom, look at me.

578
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,640
Arthur, before I went
to America, I wrote a letter.

579
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,520
Yeah? Who to?

580
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,120
To Linda.

581
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,720
And in that letter, I wrote,

582
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:24,440
"Linda, as a Christian woman,
do you believe in forgiveness?"

583
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,000
This is what I got back.

584
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,920
Two days ago. Have a look.

585
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,880
"As a Christian woman,
I do believe in forgiveness."

586
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,680
Yeah, and the word "do" is underlined.

587
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,840
Arthur, I'm no Christian,
but I also believe in forgiveness.

588
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,520
Get yourself clean.

589
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,040
Stay clean for two weeks.

590
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,360
I'll write Linda another letter.

591
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,040
'Cause I know where she is.

592
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,160
First, I need you back.

593
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,280
I need my brother.

594
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,320
I've a lot to do.

595
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,960
Need someone to do the real work.

596
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,440
Yeah, look at you smile, Tom.

597
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,600
Look at your smile, brother.

598
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,760
It's been so long.

599
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,800
Come on, let's see
what this bastard has to say.

600
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,800
Come on.

601
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,560
-All right.
-Come on.

602
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,160
[Arthur] Yeah, I'm coming.

603
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,120
He is a bastard and all, Tommy.

604
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,040
Black shirts and Jews. Here we go.

605
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,840
Here we fucking go.

606
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,480
You stay in the middle
and do nothing, Tom.

607
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,320
But not fucking me!

608
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,040
Me and you, you Nazi bastard!

[men grunting]

610
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,000
[Arthur] You! You!

611
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,760
Come here, man.
I'll take your fucking eye.

612
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,400
[Tommy] Not here! Not here!

613
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,560
[grunts]

614
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,680
Come here. You've had your fun.

615
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,640
-Now let's go home.
-[Tommy] We have business.

616

[Lizzie scoffs]

617
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,720
[Tommy] Johnny, you get him home.

618
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,040
This time, check his fucking socks.

619
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,160
[Dogs] For fuck's sake.

620
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,840
Tommy, we should get out now.
Forget this American business.

621
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,480
We've got enough.

622
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,800
Not yet enough.

623
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,880
Here she comes.

624
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,040
Remember to smile.

625
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,640
-Come on.
-Shit.

[glass clinks]

627
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,480
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight,
he has truly earned your adulation.

628
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:12,080
The future prime minister
of this great country, Sir Oswald Mosley.

629
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,240
[crowd applauding]

630
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,560
[man] Fuck you, Mosley!

631
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,200
[crowd applauding]

632
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,080
Fuck. I look terrible.

633
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,800
You look beautiful, Lizzie.
I need to impress this woman,

634
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,120
so I will act as if
she is beautiful as well.

635
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,440
Mosley.

636
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:06,560
Diana, this is Tommy Shelby, MP, OBE.

637
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,000
Mr Shelby, Lady Diana Mitford.

638
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,560
Oswald's most recent
and last ever mistress.

639
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,320
And this is my wife, Lizzie Shelby.

640
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,560
Beautiful earrings.

641
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,080
[Tommy] I stole them from Tiffany's.

642
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,960
Actually, he bought the earrings in Paris.
We were in Paris on our honeymoon.

643
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,080
-God, I hate Paris.
-[Tommy] Mmm.

644
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,760
I hear you prefer Berlin.

645
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,480
Oswald and I are going
to marry there, aren't we, Oswald?

646
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,280
Mosley, I have business to discuss.

647
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,200
Perhaps you and I
could find somewhere a bit quieter, eh?

648
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,320
Darling, Mr Shelby just made
the astonishing suggestion

649
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,280
that we men go off and discuss business

650
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,400
while you women
wait around looking glamorous.

651
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,480
[laughs] Goodness. What year do you
think this is, Mr Shelby, 1807?

652
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,400
In Birmingham,
the centuries grind by quite slowly.

653
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,320
But, Mr Shelby, if it's business,
Diana is the engine of my enterprise.

654
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,640
It's the modern way, Mr Shelby.

655
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,520
Yes, we know. I am company director.

656
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,960
I will join the meeting as well.

657
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,560
But of course,
you must come as well, Elizabeth.

658
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,880
By the way, I really don't like "Lizzie."
I prefer "Liberated Elizabeth."

659
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,440
She must be part of this.

660
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,720
She's been all the way to Paris,
so she is a woman of the world. Bravo.

661
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,080
Do you know,
Oswald's told me everything about you.

662
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,760
[Mosley] Only three

663
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,360
because I know
these days Mr Shelby doesn't.

664
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,280
[Diana] Our friend in Berlin
doesn't either.

665
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,520
Well, they have that in common, at least.

666
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,520
[Diana] I imagine
they have lots in common.

667
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,720
[Mosley] Hmm.

668
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,960
[smacks lips]

669
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,440
Report to me, Shelby.

670
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,960
Officially, Jack Nelson is in London
to buy import licences.

671
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,880
And unofficially, he's Roosevelt's envoy.

672
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,320
[Tommy] As you can see
from this private letter,

673
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,120
he is far from a neutral point of view.

674
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,360
Look at the bottom
of the second paragraph.

675
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,760
"Individually, Jews are fine,
but as a race, they stink."

676
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,640
[Mosley] Hmm.

677
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,720
Elizabeth,

678
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,320
do you even know why the bridge
to President Roosevelt is so important?

679
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,920
Actually, no.

680
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,360
I don't really know
much about this business at all.

681
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,640
[glass thuds]

682
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,560
But I have fucked your future husband.

683
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,160
So I know lots of things about him.

684
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,440
Tommy, I'll be outside.

685
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,240
Well done, Elizabeth.

686
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,360
-[door closes]
-[Tommy clears throat]

687
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,480
Do you people want to meet Nelson or no?

688
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,080
Mr Shelby...

689
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,760
From now on, can I call you Thomas?

690
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,080
[Tommy] If you like.

691
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,840
Of course we would.
And we are very grateful for your efforts.

692
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:09,240
[Mosley] But, Mr Shelby,
before this enterprise goes any further,

693
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,280
you really must
do something about your wife.

694
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,280
Mr Shelby?

695
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,320
Yes. Mr Nelson.

696
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,600
I came early.

697
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,840
I wanted to come and take a look
around this beautiful church.

698
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,960
You're Catholic, Mr Shelby?

699
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,800
I hoped that by suggesting
we meet in church,

700
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,240
it might make us both
more cautious with lies and truth.

701
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,600
Well, then, your hope would be forlorn.

702
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,440
There ain't no one listening here.

703
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,000
You don't believe in God?

704
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,120
No.

705
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,080
It was the way the Catholics are treated
in my country that made me angry.

706
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,360
Made me what I became.

707
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,640
What made you angry?

708
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,880
Slowness in anything.

709
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,760
I wanted to have everything already.

710
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,720
Two working-class Catholic boys.

711
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,920
Did they mess with you
when you were small?

712
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,760
Some man in the shadows.

713
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,680
I carried a screwdriver and a blade.

714
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,400
And everyone believed
I had the power to lay curses.

715
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,000
[Nelson] And do you?

716
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,040
[Tommy] Yes, I do.

717
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,480
[Nelson] First man I killed was a priest.

718
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,520
You?

719
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,280
[Tommy] A Prussian boy with green eyes,
who was already underground.

720
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,440
[Nelson] When'd you last kill
a man, Mr Shelby?

721
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,600
[Tommy] Four years ago.

722
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,880
His name was Tommy Shelby.

723
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,920
He drank whiskey.

724
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:44,120
You want me to allow you to enter my city
and deal narcotics that'll kill people?

725
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:51,120
You deal in whiskey, Mr Nelson.

726
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,160
I recently read a report,
by the Vatican, actually,

727
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,000
which said that whiskey
disproportionately kills

728
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,120
more of our Catholic brothers and sisters.

729
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,240
Whereas opium

730
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:08,120
is the sedative more often chosen
by Protestants and atheists.

731
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,600
In return, there are people in England
who you think I should meet?

732
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:15,520
Yes.

733
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,240
Yes. Like minds.

734
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:24,120
I'm here to buy import licences for booze.

735
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,840
The booze of the blue blood elite.

736
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,760
In America, we...

737
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,000
We like labels.

738
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,400
And aspiration.

739
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,120
Well, I have a brand
of my own vodka and gin.

740
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,760
You can add that to your portfolio.

741
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,920
I hear Shelby labels
are favoured by the working class.

742
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,760
Indeed. A fact of which I'm very proud.

743
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,240
They say you're a poet too?

744
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,800
No. I only read it.

745
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:59,520
There are some people in this country
who I'd like to meet.

746
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:04,760
Fascists.

747
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:08,800
Not the ones in boots and black shirts.
The ones in tuxedos.

748
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,040
I know men who are friends of the cause.

749
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,000
I also know men
who are enemies of the cause.

750
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,720
For many years now, I've been working
closely with Winston Churchill

751
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,280
in many different capacities.

752
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,040
I have his trust.

753
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,440
He's opposed to the rise of fascism.

754
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:30,080
You, I believe, see it as inevitable.

755
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,400
Well, I can give you men of influence
who support your cause.

756
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,920
I can also offer you a full report
on Churchill's strategies.

757
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,800
All this in return
for access to South Boston?

758
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:53,520
Alternatively, you can take on Churchill
on your own without my intelligence.

759
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,480
And I can sell my opium to the Jews.

760
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,800
You're a brave man, Mr Shelby.

761
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,280
A war hero, I hear.

762
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,800
Every war hero I ever met,

763
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,400
they're just someone
who wanted to get themselves killed.

764
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,440
[chuckles]

765
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,240
Do we have a deal, Mr Nelson?

766
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,920
I'll think a great deal
about what you've said.

767
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,200
Ruby, have you finished
your spelling, love?

768
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,480
Ruby? Ruby?

769
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:09,800
Ruby?

770
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:17,640
Ruby? What are you doing, love?

771
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,160
I can hear voices.

772
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,120
Coming from up the chimney.

773
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,040
What voices?

774
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,280
The grey man.

775
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,400
[man] Gentlemen,

776
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:39,000
Mr Thomas Shelby, Birmingham South.

777
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:47,320
Mister Speaker, I was raised in a family
that endured living conditions

778
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,200
that would test the morality
of even the most virtuous.

779
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,000
Indeed, even the best of us
would have our virtues

780
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,080
trounced and thwarted
by life and the meanness

781
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,240
and the bitterness
of an overcrowded British slum.

782
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,360
What would you know about virtue?

783
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,960
[clamouring]

784
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,600
[Lizzie] Quickly, please.

785
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,000
[Lizzie breathing heavily]

786
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,120
Therefore, Mister Speaker,
I intend to put before this house

787
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:22,920
a bill which will offer radical reform
in housing policy in this country,

788
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,040
in which slums are cleared,

789
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:30,320
new houses are built,
with new standards in health and hygiene.

790
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,040
Westminster 245. House of Commons.

791
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,280
[telephone ringing]

792
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,920
The time has come for change.
The people have had enough.

793
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,880
[giggles]

794
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,760
Let's open the windows, let in new light,

795
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:53,400
build a new Jerusalem,
brick by government-owned brick.

796
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,360
[all cheering]

797
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,160
Into there.

798
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,160
[Ruby coughing]

799
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,760
Good.

800
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,520
Doctor?

801
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,120
Yeah, Westminster 245.

802
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:22,800
Mr Shelby.

803
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,800
[Lizzie] "Tickner Maura, O Beng, O Beng,"
<i>over and over again.</i>

804
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,360
-[Michael] <i>How is the family?</i>
-[Polly] <i>One of you will die.</i>

805
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,360
-[Ruby] <i>He's staring at me, Daddy.</i>
-[Lizzie] <i>A man with green eyes.</i>

806
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,120
Can you stop the voices?

807
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,680
[Lizzie] There are no voices, my love.

808
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,800
[Ruby] It's the grey man.

809
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,840
He says he's coming for me.

810
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,360
And he's coming for Daddy as well.

811

-[man grunts]
-[Tommy gasps]

812
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,040
[telephone ringing]

813
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,080
[both grunting]

814
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,280
[man yells]

815
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,960
-[knife pierces]
-[screams]

816
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,520
[knock on door]

817
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:21,880
[man] Mr Shelby?

818
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,080
Is everything all right in there?

819
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,000
[knocking continues]

820
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,120
Mr Shelby?

821
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,480
Everything's fine. Everything's fine.

822
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,240
[telephone ringing]

823
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,800
-Hello?
-[Lizzie] <i>Tommy?</i>

824
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,800
Tommy. She has a temperature
of 101 and nothing is working.

825
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,760
-Just get here now.
<i>-Lizzie?</i>

826
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,160
-Please.
<i>-Lizzie...</i>

827
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,560
[sighs]

828
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,600
[breathes heavily]

829
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,160
Where is she?

830
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,800
She's with the doctor upstairs.

831
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,480
Listen, Tommy.

832
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,080
He said we shouldn't
come close to her in case...

833
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,160
In case of what?

834
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,760
When she coughs, there's blood.

835
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:56,360
Madonna, put me through to the number
I gave you for Esme Shelby-Lee.
