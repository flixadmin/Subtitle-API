1
00:00:04,756 --> 00:00:08,009
All right, prepare to die,
Klamulon scum.

2
00:00:08,384 --> 00:00:11,262
The <i>USS Engager</i> is about
to crash the mode on your asses.

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,679
How do I turn this on?

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,394
Oh, cool. Okay.
All right. Here we go.

5
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:22,398
Oh, come on. Why do I have to be
the Squid Clam Warriors?

6
00:00:22,482 --> 00:00:24,567
'Cause you're the enemy
and I'm the hero. Okay?

7
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:25,711
That's how this works.

8
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:26,651
Now, raise your shields,

9
00:00:26,653 --> 00:00:28,589
because I'm ranked top ten
on the global leaderboards

10
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:30,213
and you're about to get
your butt kicked.

11
00:00:32,242 --> 00:00:35,328
Hey, that's my ship.
That's my global ranking.

12
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:39,666
No, no, no, no. Go somewhere.

13
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:41,876
- You hate this game.
- Not anymore.

14
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,381
Oh, crap. Uh...

15
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:52,262
<i>- Hi, Bart.</i>
- Oh, Mom. It's crazy you called.

16
00:00:52,345 --> 00:00:54,597
I was pulling an all-nighter
studying for this midterm.

17
00:00:54,681 --> 00:00:56,808
<i>- Yeah. No, you weren't.</i>
- Yeah. No, I wasn't.

18
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:58,977
Never try to fool someone
who's won two Pulitzers.

19
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:00,812
<i>Look, Nora, I'm glad I have you.</i>

20
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,814
<i>Your last story did so well</i>

21
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:05,400
<i>that I would like you
to write a follow-up piece.</i>

22
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:07,777
Yeah, sure. When's the deadline?

23
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,321
<i>Uh, if you could get something
to me by...</i>

24
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,950
Mom? Mom?

25
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:16,035
Yeah, that looked like
more than just bad service.

26
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:23,960
Bart? Nora, is that really you?

27
00:01:24,544 --> 00:01:25,712
Uh, sis...

28
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:29,424
is it just me
or does Mom look really young?

29
00:01:32,552 --> 00:01:34,053
Oh, shrap.

30
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:56,831
Mom, what's the last thing you remember?

31
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:01,748
I was in my office with Taylor,
then I got lost in the time stream.

32
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:04,500
Guys, I need to talk to your dad
about what happened.

33
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:08,713
- Uh, Dad's off-world with Uncle Jay.
- But past-Dad is still looking for Mom.

34
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:12,967
I know he's gonna figure this out.
We should really get you back to 2022.

35
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:26,648
What was that?
Why can't you run back in time?

36
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:28,232
I've seen those particles before.

37
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,878
Mom, I think the Still Force
is keeping you here.

38
00:02:30,902 --> 00:02:31,902
Why would Deon do that?

39
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:34,614
Mom.

40
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,034
- No, it's gone. I'm okay.
- No, you're not.

41
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:39,303
Sis, what are we supposed to do?

42
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:40,971
We don't even know what
this time sickness stuff is,

43
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:41,911
let alone how to cure it.

44
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:44,957
Or how Mom got infected
in the first place.

45
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:56,010
- I know this is a big step.
- Yeah, I'll say.

46
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:59,305
Now, that... That's a superhero.

47
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:03,685
Are you sure I, like, need to wear this?

48
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:05,144
Maybe we're moving too fast.

49
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:09,649
These suits monitor our vitals and
allow us to communicate with each other.

50
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:14,487
That keeps us safe,
just in case something happens.

51
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,739
Like my connection
to the Negative Speed Force.

52
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,990
I know you can handle this,

53
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:20,076
and I will be there with you
every step of the way.

54
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:26,416
- You okay?
- Yeah.

55
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,877
Yeah. Let's get back to training.

56
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:42,223
You're at Mach 1.7.

57
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,268
1.78.

58
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:47,353
Wow, that's double
her last recorded speed.

59
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,216
Meena, your heart rate's in the red.
You need to slow down.

60
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:55,027
- No. I can get to Mach Two.
- You're pushing yourself too hard.

61
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:57,029
I told you, I got this.

62
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:10,209
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

63
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:13,727
- I just got the wind knocked out of me.
- What were you thinking?

64
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,798
Speed-healing
doesn't make you invincible.

65
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:17,425
Don't you think I know that?

66
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:29,895
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:34,233
And you're right, okay?

68
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:38,738
I'm a disaster.

69
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:46,661
I'll talk to her.

70
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,591
Get it together, Meena. Get it together.

71
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:02,845
- Oh, God. You got this.
- Pull it together. Okay.

72
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:06,974
I'm done. I'm done. I'm done.

73
00:05:19,946 --> 00:05:25,243
I'm sorry, Flash. I appreciate
everything you've done for me...

74
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,121
but I'm not ready for this.

75
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,917
Meena, why are you
pushing yourself so hard?

76
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:39,799
You can lap the planet in seconds.
I can barely stay on a treadmill.

77
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:42,945
Flash, how am I supposed to be a hero?

78
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,889
- You already are.
- No, I'm not.

79
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,476
Flash, I don't have what it takes.

80
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:52,728
- I think you do.
- Why?

81
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,625
Because, honestly, when I first
built that machine, I wanted...

82
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:01,070
I wanted...

83
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:04,698
nothing.

84
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:08,076
Look.

85
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,664
I'll never be the person you are.

86
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,213
Holy crap.

87
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:24,260
- You're...
- Officer Barry Allen, CSI.

88
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,931
So the fastest man alive
is a badge with a day job?

89
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:32,935
- That's so...
- Ordinary.

90
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:35,479
Yeah, that's my point.

91
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:39,609
You'd be surprised
at people's capacity to rise up

92
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:41,861
and help others during a crisis.

93
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:44,822
They just need
to be given the opportunity.

94
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:49,410
That suit, that's your opportunity.

95
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:53,282
I think you're gonna
be surprised at how well it fits.

96
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,642
But you have to give yourself a chance.

97
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:07,261
- Damn, that's good.
- I have my moments.

98
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:13,309
Fine. I'll give it a shot.

99
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,022
Besides, I already have my own suit.

100
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,650
Guess all I need is
my own superhero name.

101
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:22,807
No, you already have that, too.

102
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:25,946
Fast Track.

103
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:32,370
Fast Track.

104
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:45,967
So you're here to fulfill my destiny.

105
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:51,055
Well... you can start
by getting me out of this prison.

106
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:53,223
And then...

107
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,520
giving me my speed back.

108
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,565
Oh, you'll get everything
that you deserve, Thawne.

109
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,069
Is that right?

110
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:10,783
And just what is that going to cost me?

111
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:13,493
Just one thing.

112
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:20,376
- Your life.
- No. Wait. No!

113
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:47,485
What is it?

114
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,423
There was just a major
energy surge in Lian Yu.

115
00:08:49,447 --> 00:08:51,741
- What kind of energy?
- The temporal isotopic kind.

116
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:52,782
Deon.

117
00:08:52,784 --> 00:08:54,428
Let us know what you find
when you get there.

118
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:56,120
After last time, I reached out to Cisco.

119
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:58,906
S.T.A.R. Labs now has
a secure comm link to the island.

120
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:12,318
<i>Find anything, boss?</i>

121
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,847
<i>It's Thawne. He's dead.</i>

122
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:20,686
It's like his body was aged
a hundred years in an instant.

123
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:23,773
Which the Still Force could easily do.

124
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:27,902
Why would Deon kill Thawne now?
Doesn't make any sense.

125
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,738
Deon hasn't been himself
since we went to search for Iris.

126
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:34,784
Sorry, Barr. Gotta bounce.

127
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:39,205
It's exactly what I was afraid of.
Her time sickness has infected his mind.

128
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:41,999
Chester, can our isotopic sensor
find him?

129
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:46,212
No. It worked last time because Deon
exited the Still Force for a moment.

130
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,757
But now that he's disappeared,
we're flying blind.

131
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,927
With the power to travel across
the past, present and future...

132
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,846
he could turn up at any moment.

133
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,439
So you were out patrolling last night?
You told me you were working late.

134
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:07,566
I was. Kinda.

135
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:10,903
Look, babe,
you don't have to worry about me.

136
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:15,199
Guess what. I don't just throw emotions
in and out of people now.

137
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,535
I can induce vertigo, too.

138
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,162
- You mean like Rosa Dillon?
- Yeah.

139
00:10:20,246 --> 00:10:21,204
Babe, that's not a good thing.

140
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:23,415
It's not like
I'm some kind of super villain.

141
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:25,459
Joe, I would think
that you would be happy for me.

142
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:28,629
I am. But I just wish
I knew how all this happened.

143
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:33,717
Oh, speak of the devil.
We are about to have a visitor.

144
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:37,805
Wait for it.

145
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,684
- Come on in, Rosa.
- Hold up, hold up.

146
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,061
Ain't nobody invite
your criminal behind in here.

147
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:47,648
Really? 'Cause I think she did
when she stole all my powers.

148
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,649
Uh...

149
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,986
Wait. You what?
Cecile, is that why you leveled up?

150
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:55,030
Okay, time out. I think...
I think that I can explain...

151
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:58,075
You think? I want my powers back.

152
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,411
- Why do you think I was tailing you?
- Oh, you what?

153
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,246
I was tailing her.

154
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:06,375
Right after all my powers went missing,
I got a mental image of her in my mind.

155
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,043
So, yeah, I thought I'd swing by

156
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:09,646
to see if I could get to
the bottom of all this.

157
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:13,257
Now, that makes sense. But how did
Cecile end up with your meta-powers?

158
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,758
I, uh... Hear me out.

159
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:17,682
You know how I can throw emotions
into somebody else? I can take them...

160
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,014
- Yeah, I taught you that.
- Right.

161
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:24,768
It seems like now somehow I can actually

162
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:28,939
tap into the powers
of any psychic that's nearby.

163
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:31,150
Okay, you live off of Third Street,
right?

164
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:34,320
- Yes.
- Yes. Last night I was out patrolling.

165
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:37,907
There was somebody who needed protection
from a mugger, and I thought to myself,

166
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:42,745
"I wonder if I could use
Rosa's vertigo powers,"

167
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:46,540
and I tried it, and I did it,
and it worked.

168
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:50,169
That can't be a coincidence.

169
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:55,424
Congratulations. You cracked the case.

170
00:11:57,218 --> 00:12:00,218
But I still don't have my powers back.
You got an explanation for that, too?

171
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,391
- No, she doesn't.
- No, I don't.

172
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:07,228
- Then what am I supposed to do?
- I don't know.

173
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:11,148
What? My theory is just that.
It's a theory.

174
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,399
Then you need to test it.

175
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:22,117
Hey, David. Sorry to bother you, man.
I need a favor from the chief of police.

176
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:27,373
I need two visitor passes
to the meta-wing in Iron Heights ASAP.

177
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:29,249
Thank you so much.

178
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:38,884
So that's what's causing my life
to be a nightmare.

179
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,678
I'm afraid so.

180
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:45,683
It's a negative tachyon,
and your body is flooded with them.

181
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:48,117
They're the cause of your time sickness.

182
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,646
- So how'd they get there?
- I don't know.

183
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:55,526
But the negative tachyons inside you
are increasing exponentially.

184
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:58,946
And that's putting an incredible strain
on your physiology.

185
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,032
Your body can't withstand this forever.

186
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,288
- Mom.
- It's okay.

187
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:16,505
I saw the Forces. Bashir, Deon, Alexa.

188
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,341
But something happened.
They were different.

189
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,199
Why would I see something like that?

190
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:26,724
All I can theorize is that
somehow your sickness

191
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:30,102
must also be triggering
some kind of temporal visions.

192
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:35,308
- It's the only way.
- Agreed.

193
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:37,460
But someone needs to stay here
to keep Mom safe.

194
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,962
You were with Dad in the Speed Force.
I'll stay here.

195
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:40,612
I'll go to 2022 and get help.

196
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:42,573
- Are you sure that's a good idea?
- No.

197
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:47,619
But if anybody can help save Mom...
it's Dad.

198
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:55,935
You're gonna burn yourself out.

199
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,425
You've been training
all morning with the Flash,

200
00:13:58,464 --> 00:14:02,176
and now, instead of resting,
you're pushing yourself even harder.

201
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:07,097
- Eobard, you're worrying too much.
- Meena, you need to ease up.

202
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,101
Not yet. I need to keep training.

203
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:14,480
Why? So you can kill yourself?
What's gotten into you?

204
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:20,235
Eobard, what's the point
of having these powers...

205
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,622
We've been looking for you, Eobard.

206
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:34,165
Who are you people?

207
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:38,462
Who we are isn't important.
At least not to a dead man.

208
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,297
Whoever or whatever you are,

209
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,150
you need to get the hell out
of my building.

210
00:14:42,174 --> 00:14:43,174
Oh.

211
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:48,347
Before I make you.

212
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,100
Oh, I like her.

213
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:54,603
Well, don't get too attached.
Play time's almost over.

214
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:58,482
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You'll find out soon enough.

215
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:01,902
- I'm not kidding. Back off.
- Or what?

216
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,739
You have no idea
who you're up against, do you?

217
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:10,452
- Then enlighten me.
- We're the true Forces of the universe.

218
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:15,791
Ones written in darkness.
And we're here to kill you, Thawne.

219
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:18,710
So you can fulfill your purpose.

220
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,466
Don't look so negative.

221
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,429
I promise I'll make it fast.

222
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,439
- I won't let you hurt him.
- I was hoping you'd say that.

223
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:39,898
I can taste her fear.

224
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,027
- Ooh, amuse-bouche.
- Hold on.

225
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:48,239
Too easy.

226
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,702
Looks like you're the last Thawne left.

227
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:58,709
Hope you enjoyed
your time, man. 'Cause you're all out.

228
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,084
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

229
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,797
- What is it?
- He's coming.

230
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,599
Not fast enough, Flash.
Besides, this ain't your kind of party.

231
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:17,352
- I'm gonna crush you...
- ...like a grape.

232
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:20,723
What the...

233
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:33,744
Who are they?

234
00:16:33,745 --> 00:16:35,287
Whoa, whoa.

235
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,832
It's my speed. Something's wrong.

236
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,227
Well, it probably had something to do
with that light show you just put on.

237
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:44,505
No, it's like when Meena
attacked me at the dam.

238
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:48,008
- Only much stronger.
- They tried to kill Eobard.

239
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:52,429
- Just like at Lian Yu.
- And that's just the beginning.

240
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,099
You see, there's only room for
one set of Forces in the universe.

241
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:57,893
The negative ones.

242
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,811
And we're tired of sharing our turf.

243
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:02,499
Speed Force Nora and the others,
what did you do to them?

244
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:05,192
Oh, he just gave them
a case of the Mondays.

245
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:07,861
It'll be a while
before you see them again.

246
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:10,614
Why are you doing this,
and what does it have to do with me?

247
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:11,823
You're not the Avatar.

248
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,118
You just being here makes us weak.

249
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,871
So sacrifices got to be made, Flash.

250
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:21,041
And you've got to pay for what you did.

251
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,425
I don't care who they are.
I won't let them hurt Eobard.

252
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:31,592
Whoa, whoa.

253
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:32,719
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey.

254
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:35,055
All right, we need to get him some help.
Come on.

255
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,651
<i>I think itjust arrived.</i>

256
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,310
Uh, Chester?

257
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:43,564
Oh, yeah, yeah.
So sorry about the hacking comms thing,

258
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:46,066
<i>but once I saw the Flash's vitals,
I had to track him down.</i>

259
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,402
Do you think you can bring
the Flash to S.T.A.R. Labs?

260
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:51,446
Yeah. Be there in under a minute.

261
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:55,200
- Good. 'Cause he's got company.
- The best kind.

262
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:02,833
Caitlin, why are you helping me?
I thought you gave up on Frost.

263
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I had.

264
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,087
But after I saw your designs,

265
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:10,090
I realized I'll never stop
trying to bring her back.

266
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:12,425
I can't.

267
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:24,396
Okay, if all goes according to plan,

268
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:26,690
the pod's cerebral circuitry
should stimulate

269
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:30,235
and then reactivate Frost's residual
subconscious left inside your mind.

270
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:33,822
- And then I'll get her voice back.
- Yeah. Then when she's with us again...

271
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,950
We can pick up where we left off
and build her a new body.

272
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:42,831
Hey, what if Barry
discovers what we're doing?

273
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,459
You know, he pulls you out,
destroys the CRC?

274
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:47,669
Then we'll find another way.

275
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:29,294
It was like slamming into
a brick wall.

276
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,506
It didn't matter how fast I was.

277
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:36,426
The negative tachyons in Mom's body
won't let her travel through time.

278
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:40,555
I still can't believe we have to fight
Negative Forces or that they even exist.

279
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:43,892
True that. And what did they mean
by Thawne's not the Avatar?

280
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:52,025
Dad, you said that it was just
Negative Deon, Alexa and Bashir.

281
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:56,279
But there was no Negative Speed Force
Nora. Where was she?

282
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:00,826
This other Deon
said I had to pay for what I did.

283
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,911
And I took away Thawne's speed

284
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:05,205
by severing his connection
to the Negative Speed Force.

285
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:06,915
Which might have erased Negative Nora.

286
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,001
That must be why they're weaker now
and why they blame you.

287
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:12,879
Maybe they think that killing Thawne

288
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,590
will somehow bring back
the Negative Speed Force Avatar.

289
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:16,632
Hold on.

290
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:21,389
If they're tired of sharing their turf,
they'd wanna level the playing field.

291
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:23,432
By weakening the forces we know.

292
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,771
Iris' time sickness.

293
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:34,943
It was never about her.
They knew Deon would try to help.

294
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,529
And Mom's sickness
would spread to the Positive Forces.

295
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,072
Taking them out of the picture.

296
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,323
Wait. Hold on.

297
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:44,327
What happens if the bad Forces
end up being the only ones left?

298
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:47,497
Then every speedster we know
could cease to exist.

299
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:51,668
Leaving the entire planet unprotected
from the Negative Forces.

300
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,714
Nora, you need to run back to 2049.

301
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:59,384
You and Bart have to watch over Iris
while we face the Forces here.

302
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:02,804
But you're still too weak
to fight again. Dad, if they come back...

303
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:05,265
They will.
But nobody's gonna die tonight.

304
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:08,477
We're gonna find a way to save
your mom and end this. I promise.

305
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,526
Barr, these Forces?

306
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,696
They're literally gods,
and there's three of them.

307
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:21,765
How are we supposed to fight that?

308
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:36,046
It's all three isotopic energy masses.
Electrochemical, temporal

309
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:37,297
and geothermic.

310
00:21:37,298 --> 00:21:39,674
They're gathering strength
on their own planes of existence.

311
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:40,998
That's what's bleeding through.

312
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:51,311
Look, guys, I know this feels different.
That's because it is.

313
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:55,857
This is personal to them, which means
it's not gonna be an ordinary fight.

314
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,442
We need to be ready for anything.

315
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:00,904
Have you heard back from Cecile yet?

316
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:04,199
Yeah. Joe said she was at Iron Heights
and that it's important.

317
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,952
She thinks she might know
how her powers are leveling up.

318
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:09,079
- But she'll be here as soon as she can.
- Good.

319
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:11,474
'Cause we're going to need
all the meta-power we can get.

320
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:19,047
Mona, I don't have much time,
so here's how it's gonna go.

321
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:21,466
I'm gonna take those off,
you're gonna read my mind.

322
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,590
Tell me what I'm thinking.

323
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:24,970
- If you can.
- With pleasure.

324
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:27,806
Don't get any ideas, Mona.

325
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:31,434
She's taking the cuffs off,
but this is a meta interrogation cell.

326
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:32,811
The walls are meta-dampened,

327
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:35,146
so you won't be able
to read anything except us.

328
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,858
Like I wanna read
that empty mind of yours.

329
00:22:38,817 --> 00:22:40,277
- Watch it.
- Or what?

330
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:42,296
You're gonna put me back in prison?

331
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,199
Can we save it for the playground,
ladies? And, Mona, no tricks.

332
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:50,495
Now, let's have some fun.

333
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:03,008
Oh!

334
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:08,179
What'd you do to me?
My telepathy is gone.

335
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:10,431
Oh!

336
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:14,436
Excuse me.
Somebody has a potty mouth.

337
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:18,231
And no, Rosa, you are not
the good cop in this situation.

338
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:19,900
'Cause you stole her powers, too.

339
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:28,116
What is it?

340
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:31,661
I can hear them.

341
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:37,125
All of them. Everyone. I can hear
the entire city, all of their thoughts.

342
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,730
<i>This is personal to them,
which means it's not gonna be</i>

343
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:40,752
<i>an ordinary fight.</i>

344
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:41,754
Barry.

345
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:43,399
<i>We need to be ready
for anything.</i>

346
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:47,010
- Barry. We have to go.
- What the hell, Horton?

347
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,804
No. No way. She said
these walls were meta-dampened.

348
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:52,432
How can you read
every single mind in town all at once?

349
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:53,473
Even I couldn't do that.

350
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,155
I don't know.
I don't understand it either.

351
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:56,977
I think I do.

352
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:01,024
Look, I don't know how,

353
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:06,363
but, Horton, you're becoming
one of the most powerful metas

354
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:07,864
this city has ever seen.

355
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:11,952
- The planet, for that matter.
- What?

356
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,596
What's happening to me?

357
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:27,884
You're telling me this is just some
sick play by the Negative Forces?

358
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:30,635
Damn.

359
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:35,433
The negative tachyons replicating
inside Iris' body keep increasing.

360
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,579
I don't know if she'll survive
another temporal attack.

361
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:41,022
- There's got to be something we can do.
- There is.

362
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:44,567
Pray that Barry can find the strength
to defeat the Negative Forces.

363
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:49,864
Because it's the only way
to cure Iris and save her life.

364
00:24:58,873 --> 00:24:59,831
Hang on.

365
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:00,935
There's no time
to stop and talk.

366
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,639
I need to keep training
for our next fight.

367
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:03,794
Hey.

368
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:07,215
I know you.

369
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:10,885
And that adorable
brow furrow thing you're doing,

370
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:13,263
that only happens
when something's really bothering you.

371
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,890
So you want to tell me what's wrong now?

372
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:18,601
I mean, aside from cosmic forces
trying to kill me.

373
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:24,024
Because you have been pushing yourself
beyond your limits all day,

374
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:25,984
and you still haven't told me why.

375
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:29,904
And with the way things are now,
I get it. Look, I'm scared too. Okay?

376
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,742
But whatever happens,
let's face it together.

377
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:43,585
I told Barry this morning
that I could never be a hero like him.

378
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,464
I don't have what it takes.

379
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:50,550
So he convinced you otherwise,
and that's why you're training so hard.

380
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,677
- You're afraid of letting him down.
- No.

381
00:25:54,846 --> 00:25:56,556
I'm afraid of letting you down.

382
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:02,812
Eobard, this... this was always
supposed to be you.

383
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:07,358
And it should be. This is your dream.

384
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:10,361
- You're keeping it alive.
- That's what makes it worse.

385
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:15,617
I never wanted to be a speedster.
I... I still don't.

386
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:21,539
Eobard, I wanted to share
meta-powers with the world

387
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:26,711
so people could heal their bodies
and live fuller lives.

388
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:30,089
That was my dream.

389
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:33,718
Now I'm afraid of losing it.

390
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:36,554
You're not.

391
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:40,016
Because what you're doing now,

392
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:44,229
risking your life
to fight side by side with the Flash

393
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:47,398
to make me safer,
to make the city safer...

394
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:52,153
Meena, it's the same dream.

395
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:55,800
And you may not be able
to share your speed,

396
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:58,034
but you're doing something far greater.

397
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:01,371
You're sharing yourself with all of us.

398
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:06,126
And I couldn't be prouder.

399
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,141
How did I get so lucky?

400
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:24,519
Blame it on a resume.

401
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:35,488
God, I wish the B.L.O.C.
wasn't only programmed to just me.

402
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:40,034
If only there was a way for me
to share this gift with you.

403
00:27:43,955 --> 00:27:44,955
You can.

404
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:50,753
I'm sorry. I just came down
to check on your training.

405
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:51,838
I didn't mean to intrude.

406
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:57,385
Meena, I've been trying all day to find
a way to give us a fighting chance

407
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:59,470
against the threats
we're facing with no luck,

408
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:02,765
but... you just found the answer.

409
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:06,186
Which is?

410
00:28:07,896 --> 00:28:10,064
I'm gonna teach Meena
how to share her powers.

411
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:12,859
And turn you into a speedster.

412
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:01,866
Okay, people,
according to S.T.A.R. Labs satellites,

413
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,452
those isotopic energies,
they're on the move.

414
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:06,663
Let me guess.
They're headed straight for us?

415
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:09,165
The Negative Forces want a fight,
let's give it to them.

416
00:29:09,707 --> 00:29:10,833
You guys know the plan.

417
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:13,378
Just keep them occupied
long enough for us to do this.

418
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:19,175
Okay. Now what?

419
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:24,514
Take Eobard's hand,
listen to my voice and concentrate.

420
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:27,892
All right. Let's do this thing.

421
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:30,436
You're gonna need this first.

422
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:52,834
Flash, what happened to me
at Keystone Dam,

423
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:54,585
what if it happens to Eobard?

424
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:58,381
It won't. For the same reason
you were able to become yourself again.

425
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:02,260
The love you have for each other
balances you both.

426
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:18,693
What is this, the B-team?
You got to be kidding me.

427
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:23,072
- Clearly y'all have a death wish.
- I'm a little disappointed.

428
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:24,532
Get used to that feeling.

429
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:49,222
Nothing's happening.

430
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:51,642
Transferring speed
isn't just about energy,

431
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:52,977
it's about how you feel.

432
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:56,105
You're sharing more than your powers.
You're sharing yourself.

433
00:30:56,981 --> 00:30:59,067
Imagine giving
the most important part of yourself

434
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,443
to another by letting them in.

435
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:18,586
No way. You're not this strong.

436
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:21,005
Allegra, now.

437
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:26,010
Okay, that's really bad.

438
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:30,807
<i>Ooh, Allegra, time to play.</i>

439
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:33,643
I'll make this fast.

440
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,570
Do your worst, lady.

441
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:49,617
That's an inverse energy trap.
Good luck fighting yourself.

442
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:01,712
I feel alive.

443
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:06,843
But there's so much hate.

444
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:10,430
It burns.

445
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:14,910
The Negative Speed Force
is trying to influence you.

446
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:18,187
You have to fight it. You have to
help each other find a balance.

447
00:32:23,234 --> 00:32:26,529
<i>I'm over here.</i>

448
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:32,075
Boo.

449
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:35,704
So close.

450
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:41,376
Psst.

451
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:45,882
<i>Ooh!</i>

452
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:47,049
You're bad at this.

453
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:55,850
Poor orphan Allegra.

454
00:32:56,392 --> 00:33:00,771
The power of light in your hands
but born into a life of darkness.

455
00:33:00,855 --> 00:33:03,357
What is that,
some kind of evil poetry diss?

456
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:05,586
'Cause you're gonna need
a lot more than that to scare me.

457
00:33:08,196 --> 00:33:10,198
Why would I scare you...

458
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:13,618
when I can kill you?

459
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:21,709
I can't hold him much longer.

460
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:24,253
The field's breaking down.

461
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,880
She's too strong.

462
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:57,036
Don't give up. Don't give up. We've
gotta buy them as much time as we can.

463
00:33:57,286 --> 00:34:00,414
It's too late. You're all out.

464
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:08,422
Meena, remember what I told you.
This is your chance.

465
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:12,885
Your moment. You can do this.
You can be a hero. And you're not alone.

466
00:34:22,353 --> 00:34:24,272
Looks like y'all gotta bounce.

467
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:26,357
Permanently.

468
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:38,077
Back off. All of you.

469
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:40,746
That's your only warning.

470
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:43,331
Seriously?

471
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,669
- That's all you got?
- It's three against one, Flash.

472
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:48,296
You don't stand a chance.

473
00:34:50,381 --> 00:34:51,549
Good thing I brought backup.

474
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:14,780
- It's time for some payback.
- You sure we can do this?

475
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:16,324
As long as we work together.

476
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,599
- Where'd he go?
- I'm guessing not far.

477
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:54,087
Mom.

478
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:55,988
Mom, you have to stay with us this time.

479
00:35:56,322 --> 00:36:01,118
The Forces he's fighting...
Barry... It's a new moment in time.

480
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,162
- What does she mean?
- It's another vision.

481
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:05,498
I think she's seeing something
from 2022.

482
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:07,917
This can't be happening.
Time is changing.

483
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,795
Whatever's happening in the past
is connected to her time sickness,

484
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:12,439
and now it's literally
changing the future.

485
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:14,548
Which means we have no idea
how this will turn out.

486
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:16,193
- I can't.
- No. No, Mom, stop.

487
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:17,343
Wait. We're not losing you.

488
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,221
<i>No. Wait. No.</i>

489
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:23,182
Sacrifices got to be made, Flash.

490
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:24,391
What is it?

491
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:26,852
The visions.

492
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:29,938
They're not random.

493
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:39,782
You can't win, Flash.
We're weak, but so are you.

494
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:43,327
Which means we can handle
anything you dish out.

495
00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:49,378
This might be our only window
to win this fight.

496
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,503
But to do it, I need you two
to hold them here while I get ready.

497
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:03,055
I have to give in.

498
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:04,724
- No, Mom, you can't.
- I have to.

499
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:06,727
It's the only way to see
what's really happening.

500
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:07,809
Iris, wait.

501
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:12,106
You're not the Avatar.
You just being here makes us weak.

502
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:14,525
And you've got to pay for what you did.

503
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,778
What are you doing?
We needed that to find Iris.

504
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:19,363
Sacrifices got to be made.

505
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:22,658
No. The sacrifice isn't Thawne.

506
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:25,535
It never was.

507
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,953
The real sacrifice is...

508
00:38:49,787 --> 00:38:53,207
Iris? Iris? Iris?

509
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,544
No, no, no.

510
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:03,551
I told you, Flash.

511
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:10,891
We're tired of taking the back seat
to those sorry-ass opposites of yours.

512
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:13,978
Sacrifices had to happen.

513
00:39:17,648 --> 00:39:19,358
And that ain't the only one.

514
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:49,679
What?

515
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:59,315
- Eobard? Eobard? Hey.
- Get back.

516
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:03,068
Something's wrong.

517
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:09,700
What's happening to him?

518
00:40:32,306 --> 00:40:33,641
Thanks for the resurrection...

519
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:37,186
Flash.
