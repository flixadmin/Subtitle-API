1
00:00:00,127 --> 00:00:01,757
Last season, on "The Flash."

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,531
Melt.

3
00:00:03,534 --> 00:00:05,320
- Killer Frost...
- Is gone.

4
00:00:05,323 --> 00:00:08,544
It says there's still another
cryogenic anomaly in my DNA.

5
00:00:08,547 --> 00:00:09,943
Killer Frost is still a part of you.

6
00:00:09,945 --> 00:00:11,657
Hang on.

7
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:13,559
See, right there.

8
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:15,594
Killer Frost, she was part of you.

9
00:00:15,596 --> 00:00:17,101
Even then.

10
00:00:17,104 --> 00:00:18,265
How is that possible?

11
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,765
To the newest member of Team Flash.

12
00:00:20,768 --> 00:00:21,934
- Hi.
- Hey.

13
00:00:21,936 --> 00:00:22,945
We need to talk.

14
00:00:22,948 --> 00:00:25,303
- Who are you?
- I'm your daughter, Nora.

15
00:00:25,306 --> 00:00:26,879
Sally's in a decaying orbit.

16
00:00:26,882 --> 00:00:28,207
Okay, how do we stop something

17
00:00:28,209 --> 00:00:30,177
that's going to send us
back into the Stone Age?

18
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,913
Barry, you've got to
destroy that satellite.

19
00:00:33,171 --> 00:00:34,567
That satellite...

20
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,482
It wasn't just me who took it down.

21
00:00:36,484 --> 00:00:38,484
There was another speedster.

22
00:00:38,486 --> 00:00:40,981
Okay, let's back up.

23
00:00:42,023 --> 00:00:43,989
My name is Nora West-Allen,

24
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:45,891
the fastest woman alive.

25
00:00:45,893 --> 00:00:48,043
When I'm from, 30 years from now,

26
00:00:48,046 --> 00:00:50,129
I'm the guardian of Central City.

27
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:52,998
I'm a speedster, just like my dad.

28
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,100
People call me XS.

29
00:00:56,909 --> 00:00:59,804
Every day, I hope to live up
to the legacy of The Flash...

30
00:01:03,477 --> 00:01:06,812
But I've still got a long way to go.

31
00:01:14,155 --> 00:01:15,601
You're saying you're our daughter?

32
00:01:15,604 --> 00:01:18,156
From the future?

33
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,858
Named Nora?

34
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,194
After your mother.

35
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:25,030
Anybody need a refill?

36
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,666
No? Just me?

37
00:01:29,337 --> 00:01:30,669
Mm.

38
00:01:30,671 --> 00:01:32,137
Cisco Ramon,

39
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:34,406
always cutting the tension with a joke.

40
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:36,828
You know our names?

41
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:39,377
Of course. I know all of you.

42
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,847
You're Caitlin Snow, Ralph Dibny,

43
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:44,149
Papa Joe, Mama Cecile.

44
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:45,651
Little Auntie Jenna.

45
00:01:45,653 --> 00:01:46,852
She's so cute.

46
00:01:46,854 --> 00:01:48,187
And Uncle Wally.

47
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:51,078
Uh, and your nickname is XS?

48
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:52,391
Clearly not my doing.

49
00:01:52,393 --> 00:01:53,761
No, uh, it's a nickname

50
00:01:53,764 --> 00:01:57,395
that you gave me when I was a kid, Mom.

51
00:01:57,398 --> 00:01:59,031
"Mom"?

52
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:02,067
You said I did everything in excess.

53
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:04,370
Guess I've always been like that.

54
00:02:04,372 --> 00:02:07,006
Overdoing things, getting
in way over my head.

55
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:09,108
Like, uh, recently.

56
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,843
This mistake that you made?

57
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:12,044
Big mistake.

58
00:02:12,046 --> 00:02:13,445
Which was...

59
00:02:13,447 --> 00:02:15,014
Helping you save the city

60
00:02:15,016 --> 00:02:17,383
by destroying the STAR
Labs satellite last night.

61
00:02:17,385 --> 00:02:18,717
You were the other speedster?

62
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,052
I just couldn't stop myself

63
00:02:20,054 --> 00:02:22,354
from getting involved.

64
00:02:22,356 --> 00:02:25,057
But something happened
when I did, because now,

65
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:28,060
I can't seem to go fast enough
to open up the Speed Force.

66
00:02:28,062 --> 00:02:29,595
Par... pardon me.

67
00:02:29,597 --> 00:02:32,039
Are we talking about
actual time travel here?

68
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:34,533
Do you just like, not pay any attention

69
00:02:34,535 --> 00:02:36,001
when we have our briefings?

70
00:02:36,003 --> 00:02:37,936
Y'all didn't teach
him about the Legends?

71
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:40,515
Look, nobody said
bubkes about time travel.

72
00:02:40,518 --> 00:02:42,401
Shh, shh, shh. Oh!

73
00:02:42,404 --> 00:02:44,075
Come on, Ralph. You're scaring the baby.

74
00:02:44,078 --> 00:02:45,539
Yeah, you're scaring the baby.

75
00:02:46,747 --> 00:02:48,447
No, no, she's not scared.

76
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:49,915
She just said she's hungry.

77
00:02:51,285 --> 00:02:54,720
She said that she's... Joe!

78
00:02:54,722 --> 00:02:56,121
I heard her!

79
00:02:56,123 --> 00:02:58,424
I read her mind!

80
00:02:58,426 --> 00:03:00,570
I might not be losing my powers!

81
00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:03,696
I might not be losing my powers!

82
00:03:03,698 --> 00:03:05,464
Awesome.

83
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:07,299
I'm sorry.

84
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:10,102
I know how bizarre this must seem,

85
00:03:10,104 --> 00:03:14,740
meeting your daughter from
the future as an adult.

86
00:03:14,742 --> 00:03:16,909
But really, this wasn't my plan at all,

87
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:19,675
but I'm kind of stuck here now,

88
00:03:19,678 --> 00:03:22,045
and you're the only
people who can help me.

89
00:03:22,048 --> 00:03:26,284
So... anybody know what to do?

90
00:03:30,436 --> 00:03:33,125
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

91
00:03:35,996 --> 00:03:41,166
This is so, so weird.

92
00:03:41,168 --> 00:03:47,072
Yeah, I mean, I can't believe
that's our daughter up there.

93
00:03:47,074 --> 00:03:50,509
- We have been lied to before.
- Barry.

94
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:53,545
Yellow lightning like yours,
purple lightning like mine?

95
00:03:53,547 --> 00:03:55,681
I mean, it's... It's got to be her.

96
00:03:58,686 --> 00:04:01,420
We're meeting our daughter
for the first time, Barry.

97
00:04:01,422 --> 00:04:03,128
Yeah, well, look. If it is true, Nora

98
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:06,734
could say the wrong thing or
step on the wrong butterfly

99
00:04:06,737 --> 00:04:08,160
and screw up the whole timeline.

100
00:04:08,162 --> 00:04:10,229
I mean, she could Marty McFly
herself out of existence.

101
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:12,515
Mm, "Terminator 2," yeah.

102
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:16,101
No, that's "Back to
the"... It doesn't matter.

103
00:04:16,103 --> 00:04:18,170
Look, we just need to be
responsible, all right?

104
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:20,508
I mean, I think we need to find
a way to send her home, fast.

105
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,805
Barry, don't you think
future us taught our daughter

106
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:24,510
how not to screw with the timeline?

107
00:04:26,113 --> 00:04:29,815
Wow, this Speed Lab
sure is archaic, huh?

108
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:31,316
La-la-la-la-la, you don't know...

109
00:04:31,318 --> 00:04:32,667
You know what, um...

110
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,875
Sorry, just... no future
talk, all right, please?

111
00:04:34,878 --> 00:04:37,122
Right, I don't want
to wreck the timeline.

112
00:04:37,124 --> 00:04:39,458
- Right.
- All right, Nora.

113
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,582
This is gonna link us
up with your biometrics.

114
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:42,795
Ow!

115
00:04:42,797 --> 00:04:45,230
And this little scrunchy doohicky

116
00:04:45,232 --> 00:04:48,500
is gonna analyze your
connection to the, um, uh...

117
00:04:48,502 --> 00:04:51,537
- The Speed Force.
- The Speed Force. Thank you.

118
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:52,671
Great.

119
00:04:52,673 --> 00:04:54,894
I'll be back in a... flash.

120
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,679
And what does it say?

121
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:02,381
A quick analysis of her DNA shows

122
00:05:02,383 --> 00:05:04,616
patterns that are
similar to both of yours.

123
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:07,352
I knew it. She's our daughter.

124
00:05:07,354 --> 00:05:09,188
What about her being stuck here?

125
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,374
Everything's normal.

126
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,623
She definitely has Speed
Force in her system.

127
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:14,860
She's just not going... fast enough

128
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:17,830
to, uh, open up a time portal, so.

129
00:05:17,832 --> 00:05:20,465
How much champagne did you
have at Joe and Cecile's?

130
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:23,502
This is the first opportunity I have

131
00:05:23,504 --> 00:05:26,694
to process my breakup with Gypsy, okay?

132
00:05:26,697 --> 00:05:28,307
How was I supposed to know

133
00:05:28,309 --> 00:05:29,842
that your future daughter

134
00:05:29,844 --> 00:05:31,225
was gonna come show up

135
00:05:31,228 --> 00:05:32,728
and crash my pity party?

136
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:34,917
How was I supposed to "ancipitate" that?

137
00:05:36,298 --> 00:05:37,881
Crap, I was supposed to meet Singh

138
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:39,417
- at CCPD an hour ago.
- Okay.

139
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,695
Hey, Wally, can you do me a favor?

140
00:05:40,697 --> 00:05:42,157
Can you take the sample to the Legends

141
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,449
to see if they have any insight?

142
00:05:43,452 --> 00:05:44,512
And maybe, worst comes to worst,

143
00:05:44,514 --> 00:05:45,820
we can take her home on the Waverider?

144
00:05:45,822 --> 00:05:47,225
- Yeah, I got it.
- All right.

145
00:05:49,263 --> 00:05:51,763
Okay, just... I'll hurry back.

146
00:05:51,765 --> 00:05:53,565
Keep an eye on her.

147
00:06:01,342 --> 00:06:03,876
New ID, keys to the lab.

148
00:06:03,878 --> 00:06:06,578
You are officially reinstated
as our CSI tech, Allen.

149
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,980
Thanks, Captain.

150
00:06:07,982 --> 00:06:10,482
Oh, one more thing.

151
00:06:10,484 --> 00:06:12,784
We didn't fill your
position while you were away,

152
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:16,154
so there are a few cases
waiting for you in your lab.

153
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:18,156
Get to them fast as you can.

154
00:06:18,158 --> 00:06:19,992
Welcome back, Allen.

155
00:06:24,965 --> 00:06:27,099
"A few"?

156
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,836
- Ahh!
- What you working on?

157
00:06:30,838 --> 00:06:34,106
- I don't...
- You are crazy behind.

158
00:06:34,108 --> 00:06:36,174
Hey, so I thought you were
gonna stay at STAR Labs,

159
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:38,677
with, um... with your...

160
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:40,579
Iris... mom.

161
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:42,314
Your mom.

162
00:06:42,316 --> 00:06:44,183
You know I'm a forensic scientist too?

163
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:47,119
CCU grad, just like you. 5.6 GPA.

164
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:48,687
I could help you get through this.

165
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:50,522
Oh, I don't know. I mean, it's...

166
00:06:51,926 --> 00:06:54,835
So the fire marshal at this site says

167
00:06:54,838 --> 00:06:58,363
crazing in the melted glass
suggests a liquid accelerant.

168
00:06:58,365 --> 00:07:01,166
Mm, any petroleum-based
household product

169
00:07:01,168 --> 00:07:03,068
could cause crazing.

170
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,920
Well, like floor wax, or
shag rugs, even balloons.

171
00:07:05,923 --> 00:07:08,840
Yeah, the glass melts under the surface,

172
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:12,978
like ice cream in the
cracks of a waffle cone.

173
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,213
Oh, like when you get two scoops

174
00:07:15,215 --> 00:07:17,616
of cookie dough ice
cream with extra sprinkles

175
00:07:17,618 --> 00:07:19,621
at the Mason Family Ice Cream Shop in...

176
00:07:19,624 --> 00:07:21,753
Happy Harbor, Rhode Island.

177
00:07:27,728 --> 00:07:31,350
My parents used to take
me there when I was a kid.

178
00:07:31,353 --> 00:07:33,432
It's my favorite dessert.

179
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:34,733
Mine too.

180
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:40,372
Hey, look, I'm sorry,
um, you're obviously

181
00:07:40,374 --> 00:07:43,208
good at forensics, but
you shouldn't interfere.

182
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:47,379
I mean, people like us,
we need to be responsible.

183
00:07:47,381 --> 00:07:49,655
Right! Uh, timeline.

184
00:07:49,658 --> 00:07:50,982
The timeline, yeah.

185
00:07:50,985 --> 00:07:52,178
All available units,

186
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:54,051
M-0-3 in progress, 10th and Neely.

187
00:07:54,054 --> 00:07:56,054
M-0-3, that's a meta attack.

188
00:07:56,056 --> 00:07:57,556
Yeah, my suit's all torn up.

189
00:07:57,558 --> 00:07:59,224
I don't have anything to...

190
00:07:59,226 --> 00:08:01,259
Direct from Cisco's back closet.

191
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:04,463
One first-edition red
emblem OG super suit.

192
00:08:04,465 --> 00:08:06,398
Total fan favorite.

193
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,100
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

194
00:08:08,102 --> 00:08:10,769
Uh, I'm... I'm gonna handle this.

195
00:08:10,771 --> 00:08:11,770
You just... no, no, no.

196
00:08:11,772 --> 00:08:15,073
Uh, you... stay.

197
00:08:15,075 --> 00:08:16,441
- Okay?
- Okay.

198
00:08:16,443 --> 00:08:17,976
Seriously, please.

199
00:08:17,978 --> 00:08:20,245
Now I'm gonna...

200
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:42,067
Going old-school today, Flash?

201
00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:44,569
Yeah, it's a little tighter
than I remember, though.

202
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:56,648
Hey, uh, you might want to do something.

203
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:00,108
Now it's my turn, Flash.

204
00:09:00,111 --> 00:09:03,654
Gridlock? Schway!

205
00:09:03,657 --> 00:09:04,990
- What are you doing?
- No, no.

206
00:09:04,992 --> 00:09:06,835
I just... I just wanted...

207
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:13,231
Nice.

208
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:34,663
Oh, grife. You're mad at me.

209
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,200
No, Nora, we're not. We're just...

210
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,735
Please don't say "disappointed."

211
00:09:38,737 --> 00:09:40,184
That's so much worse.

212
00:09:40,187 --> 00:09:42,004
I mean, I just didn't
think it was a big deal.

213
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:43,773
It was only Gridlock.

214
00:09:43,775 --> 00:09:45,141
Oh, Gridlock, huh?

215
00:09:45,143 --> 00:09:47,091
Boy, the future's got some great names.

216
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,312
This lighting!

217
00:09:49,314 --> 00:09:51,080
How did you know who he is?

218
00:09:51,082 --> 00:09:52,281
Flash Museum.

219
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:53,883
Did you say...

220
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,651
- "Flash Museum"?
- Yeah.

221
00:09:55,653 --> 00:09:59,106
It has all the villains and
battles in chronological order.

222
00:09:59,109 --> 00:10:00,775
I've studied everything.

223
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,692
So you know this guy's real name?

224
00:10:03,695 --> 00:10:05,528
Mr. Myles, the curator,

225
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,897
he scrubbed all the
names for legal reasons.

226
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,265
But it really shouldn't matter.

227
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:11,734
I mean, Gridlock was a one-and-done.

228
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,598
You guys beat him in one try,

229
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:16,486
or at least... you were supposed to.

230
00:10:16,489 --> 00:10:18,808
Ugh, now, because of
me, he's on the run,

231
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,144
and the timeline's all
messed up again, and I...

232
00:10:21,146 --> 00:10:22,979
Nora, hey, look, look.

233
00:10:22,981 --> 00:10:26,052
I've made way bigger mistakes
than this time traveling.

234
00:10:26,055 --> 00:10:27,771
We'll get this guy... you don't
need to worry about that...

235
00:10:27,773 --> 00:10:30,050
But the longer you stay here,
the more things might change.

236
00:10:30,052 --> 00:10:31,353
We need to get you home.

237
00:10:31,356 --> 00:10:33,623
But I can't go fast enough to get home.

238
00:10:34,945 --> 00:10:36,725
What about the tachyon
absorption enhancer?

239
00:10:36,728 --> 00:10:38,494
The one that Thawne used
to increase his speed?

240
00:10:38,496 --> 00:10:40,263
Ooh, and if we charge it up,

241
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,398
we could uh, boost the
Speed Force in her cells,

242
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,325
like some kind of, um...

243
00:10:44,328 --> 00:10:46,301
thing that boosts Speed Force in cells.

244
00:10:46,304 --> 00:10:47,639
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's a good idea.

245
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:49,216
Let's... okay, finding Gridlock

246
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:51,506
and getting Nora home
need to be our priorities.

247
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:54,017
No, no, no. Stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

248
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,478
Wait. Loud!

249
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,302
Okay, so... but this
needs to be our priority.

250
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:01,154
Now, I realize that
you're all way ahead of me

251
00:11:01,157 --> 00:11:03,022
in this time-travel business, but guys,

252
00:11:03,025 --> 00:11:04,553
I think I just discovered something.

253
00:11:04,556 --> 00:11:06,756
So if... if Nora can time travel,

254
00:11:06,758 --> 00:11:10,092
that means she can create
new timelines, right?

255
00:11:10,094 --> 00:11:14,831
New timelines means that
parallel timelines can exist.

256
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:20,870
So, guys, I think that a whole
other universe could exist.

257
00:11:20,872 --> 00:11:22,205
I know, I know, I know.

258
00:11:22,207 --> 00:11:23,840
It sounds crazy, but think about it.

259
00:11:23,842 --> 00:11:26,843
There could be an Earth
where we're all bad guys,

260
00:11:26,845 --> 00:11:29,579
or another Earth where
there's no world hunger,

261
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:32,248
or... or another Earth where...

262
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,518
Where they never made that
last "Indiana Jones" movie.

263
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,854
Think of the possibilities.

264
00:11:37,856 --> 00:11:40,158
It's like some kind of a manyverse.

265
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,361
And everybody knows about the manyverse.

266
00:11:45,363 --> 00:11:48,598
Multiverse, and so do you, Ralph.

267
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,872
Breacher? Gypsy? Harry?

268
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,190
What did you think we meant when we said

269
00:11:52,192 --> 00:11:53,870
Harry was from Earth-2?

270
00:11:53,872 --> 00:11:56,739
That he is from Earth "also."

271
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:58,122
Oh, my God.

272
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,834
You guys really need to make,
like, a welcome pamphlet,

273
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:01,878
or at least a Powerpoint or something.

274
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,645
Hey, Ralph, buddy?

275
00:12:03,648 --> 00:12:05,981
Can we get off time
travel, maybe, please?

276
00:12:05,984 --> 00:12:07,750
Let's focus on finding
Gridlock, all right?

277
00:12:07,752 --> 00:12:08,918
Thank you.

278
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,138
I'm gonna go to CCPD,
see what I can dig up.

279
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:12,552
Okay, I'll stay with Nora.

280
00:12:12,555 --> 00:12:14,656
- Let's just make sure...
- I know.

281
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:16,659
Protect the timeline.

282
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:21,831
You thirsty?

283
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:28,738
Okay, latte for me, and
a decaf Flash for you.

284
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,540
Wow.

285
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,794
Dad's lightning bolt is way
cooler than Lightning Lad's.

286
00:12:33,797 --> 00:12:36,378
And do you think he's
gonna be back soon?

287
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:37,934
Well, you know your dad.

288
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:40,715
Whenever there's a problem,
he's gotta run off and fix it.

289
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:44,200
But, you know,

290
00:12:44,203 --> 00:12:47,889
this gives us a chance to connect.

291
00:12:49,994 --> 00:12:52,662
You're not worried about
messing things up, like he is?

292
00:12:52,664 --> 00:12:55,598
I... well, I just, I...

293
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,199
want to get to know you a little.

294
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:00,108
How about this?

295
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:02,070
I will ask you questions

296
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:04,974
about your life, and if I'm right,

297
00:13:04,976 --> 00:13:07,777
you just blink twice.

298
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:10,146
I mean, blinking never
broke the timeline, right?

299
00:13:10,148 --> 00:13:12,481
Okay, yeah, I mean,
if you really want to.

300
00:13:12,483 --> 00:13:14,333
Yeah, I think it'll be really fun.

301
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,670
Okay, um, so let's see.

302
00:13:16,673 --> 00:13:21,157
You are a reporter for a newspaper

303
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:23,793
that you can only read on Instagram.

304
00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:29,165
Um, okay, you... you are a cop.

305
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:34,103
You're a... a CSI?

306
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,307
You're a CSI.

307
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:41,243
Just like your dad.

308
00:13:41,245 --> 00:13:43,713
Okay, well, what about you and I?

309
00:13:43,715 --> 00:13:46,978
Do we... do we, like,
have dinner every Sunday?

310
00:13:46,981 --> 00:13:49,951
Do we talk on the phone?
Do we still get coffee at Jitters?

311
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,190
- Uh...
- Was that a blink?

312
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:57,660
Uh, no, I just... I
have something in my eye.

313
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:03,531
You know, a coffee in my
time at Jitters is $43 a cup.

314
00:14:03,534 --> 00:14:04,700
- Wow.
- That's one thing

315
00:14:04,702 --> 00:14:05,739
I really like about now.

316
00:14:05,742 --> 00:14:08,003
2018 is way schway.

317
00:14:08,006 --> 00:14:09,872
- "Schway"?
- Oh.

318
00:14:09,874 --> 00:14:11,807
Yeah, I guess it's a future thing.

319
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,208
Oh... oh, no. Oh, "schway."

320
00:14:14,211 --> 00:14:16,112
No, I know, I'm hip. I
know what schway means.

321
00:14:16,114 --> 00:14:18,514
Like, I'm schway, you're schway.

322
00:14:18,516 --> 00:14:21,083
We're... we're schway, baby.

323
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,987
Stupid.

324
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,757
Do you think maybe Caitlin
and Cisco need any help?

325
00:14:32,828 --> 00:14:35,331
I can't believe I'm wearing
the same tachyon enhancer

326
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,947
my dad used to meet
Supergirl for the first time.

327
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,368
All set.

328
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,864
Wait, what happened
to the second version?

329
00:14:41,867 --> 00:14:43,506
The smaller one that
was inside the emblem

330
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,169
of my dad's second suit?

331
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:47,576
Um, if he wore that one,
he could harness tachyons

332
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:48,744
and share them with me.

333
00:14:48,746 --> 00:14:50,775
Hey, fangirl, relax.

334
00:14:50,778 --> 00:14:51,895
We know.

335
00:14:51,898 --> 00:14:53,883
Did all these suits shrink?

336
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:56,052
And why does it smell so bad?

337
00:14:56,054 --> 00:14:57,920
Because it's the one you used

338
00:14:57,922 --> 00:15:00,256
when you swam against King Shark.

339
00:15:00,258 --> 00:15:01,857
Oh, yeah, yeah.

340
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,247
Flash!

341
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,814
Zoom wants you dead!

342
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:06,395
Yeah, yeah.

343
00:15:06,397 --> 00:15:08,264
I know King Shark is
technically a bad guy,

344
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:10,399
but you should see... Just wait.

345
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:12,368
- When he fights Grodd, it's...
- Um!

346
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,969
Spoiler alert.

347
00:15:15,338 --> 00:15:18,473
We should get going, actually, let's...

348
00:15:18,476 --> 00:15:19,575
Right.

349
00:15:19,577 --> 00:15:22,078
Then this is goodbye.

350
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,281
From your guys' perspectives, at least.

351
00:15:25,283 --> 00:15:28,223
I'll see you again in
a minute and 27 seconds,

352
00:15:28,226 --> 00:15:31,220
but when you see me
again, I'll be a baby.

353
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,788
Get home safe, Nora.

354
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,891
I'm sorry

355
00:15:33,894 --> 00:15:35,611
we didn't get to spend
more time together.

356
00:15:35,614 --> 00:15:36,700
Oh, it's fine, Mom.

357
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,694
We spend our whole lives together.

358
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:47,570
All right.

359
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,196
Did they already leave?

360
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,630
Yeah, why? What's up?

361
00:16:14,632 --> 00:16:15,865
We have to stop them.

362
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:42,297
I'm sorry I was too late.

363
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,006
It took me a while to find
where the Legends were.

364
00:16:44,008 --> 00:16:45,302
Well, when they were.

365
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:46,646
But we got their Gideon

366
00:16:46,648 --> 00:16:48,314
to scan Nora's blood sample.

367
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:51,651
- What'd she find?
- Negative tachyons.

368
00:16:51,653 --> 00:16:53,376
Negative tachyons?

369
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,989
So, what, instead of speeding
you up, they slow you down?

370
00:16:57,626 --> 00:16:58,925
Yeah.

371
00:16:58,927 --> 00:17:00,490
Oh, damn, I was just joking.

372
00:17:00,493 --> 00:17:01,828
That's a real thing?

373
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,463
Yeah, Ava and her
team at the Time Bureau

374
00:17:03,465 --> 00:17:05,225
have encountered them
before, but no one knows

375
00:17:05,227 --> 00:17:07,033
where they come from or
how they're generated.

376
00:17:07,035 --> 00:17:09,903
Like dark matter for
the space time continuum.

377
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:12,438
Exactly, and they're
saturating Nora's body

378
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,340
and keeping her from
entering the Speed Force.

379
00:17:14,342 --> 00:17:16,779
What about the Waverider?
Can the Legends take her back?

380
00:17:16,782 --> 00:17:18,478
If negative tachyons come anywhere near

381
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,913
the Rider's time drives,

382
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:22,048
uh, the reaction will vaporize the ship.

383
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,006
Well, there's got to be a
way to get rid of them, right?

384
00:17:24,008 --> 00:17:25,327
I mean, I don't know
about getting rid of them,

385
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:27,120
but maybe we can offset

386
00:17:27,122 --> 00:17:28,955
the tachyon absorption enhancer

387
00:17:28,957 --> 00:17:31,165
to negate the reaction somehow.

388
00:17:31,168 --> 00:17:33,293
- A new meta was last seen...
- Hey, guys.

389
00:17:33,295 --> 00:17:34,828
Jumping off a building in order to

390
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,596
evade capture after stealing...

391
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:37,931
How did we miss this?

392
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,935
I guess this is a
parting gift from DeVoe.

393
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:43,283
Without our STAR Labs
satellite, we've lost

394
00:17:43,285 --> 00:17:45,365
our eyes, our ears,
our dark matter scanner,

395
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:46,955
our facial recognition...
I mean, we're always

396
00:17:46,957 --> 00:17:48,865
gonna be one step
behind these metas now.

397
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:50,076
I'll work on this.

398
00:17:50,078 --> 00:17:51,344
Why don't you guys go help Ralph

399
00:17:51,346 --> 00:17:52,592
with the Gridlock crime scene, okay?

400
00:17:52,594 --> 00:17:53,693
Uh, I can come help.

401
00:17:53,696 --> 00:17:55,243
Please, no, just... we just

402
00:17:55,246 --> 00:17:57,130
can't let this get any worse, all right?

403
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,087
Just relax, okay?

404
00:18:03,491 --> 00:18:05,216
How's your investigation going?

405
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:06,893
Uh, it just doesn't really add up.

406
00:18:06,895 --> 00:18:09,162
I mean, if Eddie wanted to
erase Thawne from existence,

407
00:18:09,165 --> 00:18:11,731
why didn't he just have a vasectomy?

408
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:13,955
Right, uh, nobody's talking.

409
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,357
Probably because they're afraid

410
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,769
Gridlock will attack them.

411
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:19,267
Right, but maybe if I had
Killer Frost at my side,

412
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,670
people would be a little more willing

413
00:18:20,672 --> 00:18:22,175
to tell us what they know.

414
00:18:22,177 --> 00:18:24,748
Ralph, Killer Frost has been gone

415
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:27,046
since the night that
DeVoe took over your body.

416
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:29,849
Jeez Louise, no one tells me anything.

417
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:31,584
- Is she gone for good?
- I hope not.

418
00:18:31,586 --> 00:18:33,319
But I've tried everything I can think of

419
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:34,687
to get her to reappear.

420
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:36,356
You don't have any other leads?

421
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,607
Cisco vibed me back to when

422
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,462
Killer Frost and I were younger.

423
00:18:42,464 --> 00:18:44,240
You've been a meta since you were a kid?

424
00:18:44,243 --> 00:18:45,665
- I guess so.
- How?

425
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:48,234
- I have no idea.
- Did you see anything else?

426
00:18:48,236 --> 00:18:51,251
- Just that my dad was there.
- Well, that's something.

427
00:18:51,254 --> 00:18:53,187
Except my dad's been dead for years.

428
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,857
But none of this matters right now.

429
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,877
We have much more pressing
things to deal with.

430
00:18:57,879 --> 00:18:59,978
Hey, come look at this.

431
00:18:59,981 --> 00:19:01,967
I present Gridlock.

432
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,669
A mystery in three acts.

433
00:19:03,672 --> 00:19:05,151
Please note the dark matter levels.

434
00:19:05,153 --> 00:19:08,488
Act One, Gridlock attacks the
cops before Barry shows up.

435
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,023
Okay, but these dark matter levels

436
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:11,624
are perfectly normal
for a man of his size.

437
00:19:11,626 --> 00:19:14,394
Until Act Two.

438
00:19:14,396 --> 00:19:17,130
He gets lightning punched by Barry.

439
00:19:17,132 --> 00:19:18,931
His dark matter levels increased.

440
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:21,901
Which brings us to our
third and final act...

441
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:25,371
Gridlock hits back.

442
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,461
Even higher.

443
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:28,074
How... how is that possible?

444
00:19:28,076 --> 00:19:30,710
It isn't, unless every
time Gridlock got hit,

445
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:32,623
his cells absorbed the kinetic energy.

446
00:19:32,626 --> 00:19:34,514
That would increase his
dark matter quotient,

447
00:19:34,516 --> 00:19:36,382
thereby increasing his powers.

448
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:39,896
If this is true, then whatever
movement he's exposed to...

449
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:41,354
The stronger he's gonna get.

450
00:19:41,356 --> 00:19:45,191
So, if Gridlock keeps moving,
he becomes unstoppable.

451
00:19:53,768 --> 00:19:56,402
So, figure it out yet?

452
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,037
Whatever these negative tachyons are,

453
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:59,572
it feels a lot more like science fiction

454
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,040
than actual science.

455
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:02,942
I wasn't asking about the science.

456
00:20:02,944 --> 00:20:05,678
I was asking about the scientist.

457
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:10,138
You and Nora, you guys have
such a strong connection.

458
00:20:10,141 --> 00:20:12,752
I mean, it's... it's effortless.

459
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:16,322
So why are you so intent
on sending her back?

460
00:20:16,324 --> 00:20:18,524
I mean, what do you mean?

461
00:20:18,526 --> 00:20:20,860
First of all, she can't stop
talking about the future.

462
00:20:20,862 --> 00:20:24,797
But... I mean, you know the
danger that her being here

463
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,332
poses to the timeline.

464
00:20:26,334 --> 00:20:30,136
Yeah, I do, but I also know you, Barry.

465
00:20:31,573 --> 00:20:35,007
Look.

466
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:36,876
You're the guy that went back in time

467
00:20:36,878 --> 00:20:38,911
- to borrow Snart before he died.
- I know.

468
00:20:38,913 --> 00:20:41,781
You're also the same guy
that travelled to 2020

469
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:45,618
to figure out who Savitar was,
and 2015 to train with Wells.

470
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,156
You changed fate to save my life.

471
00:20:50,158 --> 00:20:52,992
So, now that our daughter
is here in front of us,

472
00:20:52,994 --> 00:20:54,994
asking for our help,
you expect me to believe

473
00:20:54,996 --> 00:20:56,888
that you're worried about the timeline?

474
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:58,931
Nora shouldn't be here.

475
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:00,800
Look, I'm...

476
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:03,790
- I've always wanted a family.
- I know.

477
00:21:03,793 --> 00:21:05,771
You know, and when we got married,

478
00:21:05,773 --> 00:21:09,909
I knew that one day, we'd
decide to have a baby.

479
00:21:09,911 --> 00:21:14,814
We would try, and you'd get pregnant.

480
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:18,618
I'd be there for the sonogram,
I'd hear her first heartbeat,

481
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,386
and then she'd come.

482
00:21:20,388 --> 00:21:24,190
And we'd take her home,
see her first smile,

483
00:21:24,192 --> 00:21:27,193
her first tooth, the
first time I read to her.

484
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:31,297
Her first steps. The first time she ran.

485
00:21:33,034 --> 00:21:36,002
But her being here
now, don't you feel like

486
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,818
we missed all those firsts?

487
00:21:37,821 --> 00:21:39,372
That we skipped all the good stuff?

488
00:21:39,374 --> 00:21:43,009
Baby, we will still
have all of those firsts.

489
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,077
Just not in that order.

490
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:47,380
But my whole life's been out of order.

491
00:21:47,382 --> 00:21:49,477
These powers, time travel...

492
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,150
That's the reason my mom was killed,

493
00:21:52,153 --> 00:21:54,387
why I grew up with my dad in prison.

494
00:21:54,389 --> 00:21:56,822
They missed so many firsts.
They missed our wedding.

495
00:21:56,824 --> 00:21:58,524
I know.

496
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:05,298
I don't know, I just thought
that when it was our turn

497
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,868
to have a kid, that life would let us

498
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:12,205
have this one little
thing the normal way.

499
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:14,540
Just once.

500
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,409
But we lost that chance.

501
00:22:16,411 --> 00:22:20,546
No, we're not losing anything
by having her here now.

502
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:23,449
We're only gaining
something extra, Barry.

503
00:22:23,451 --> 00:22:27,386
And look, if we figure this out,

504
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,222
I mean, by the time we do have a baby,

505
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:33,392
we are gonna be the best parents ever.

506
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:36,262
- Maybe you're right.
- I know I'm right.

507
00:22:38,433 --> 00:22:42,535
You're gonna be there to put
that quarter under her pillow,

508
00:22:42,537 --> 00:22:44,036
and you're gonna be there

509
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:46,138
to drive her to her first day of school,

510
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:50,476
and you're gonna be there
to cheer on her first run.

511
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:56,749
And we are gonna have
all of those firsts.

512
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:59,485
I promise.

513
00:22:59,487 --> 00:23:01,787
And think about it.

514
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:06,568
We have a kid who defied
the laws of physics

515
00:23:06,571 --> 00:23:08,094
to hang out with her parents.

516
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:11,130
I mean, that's pretty...
That's pretty schway.

517
00:23:13,582 --> 00:23:16,149
Yeah, as eager as she is,
you'd think that she's the one

518
00:23:16,152 --> 00:23:20,221
that grew up with a parent in...

519
00:23:20,224 --> 00:23:23,665
What's wrong?

520
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,845
Nothing. Um, nothing.

521
00:23:25,847 --> 00:23:27,713
I'm... I'm gonna be right back.

522
00:23:45,532 --> 00:23:48,933
Nora.

523
00:23:48,936 --> 00:23:51,470
Um...

524
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:54,206
What happens to me in the future?

525
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:57,109
You said that you spend your
whole life with your mom,

526
00:23:57,111 --> 00:24:00,813
but you didn't say the same for me.

527
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:03,482
My poker face is that bad, huh?

528
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,885
I need to know.

529
00:24:10,143 --> 00:24:14,786
_

530
00:24:17,231 --> 00:24:19,231
How long?

531
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,140
_

532
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:33,346
You never come back.

533
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:48,610
How old were you when it happened?

534
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:52,482
I was born, um, a few
years before you vanished,

535
00:24:52,485 --> 00:24:56,417
but I don't have any memories of you.

536
00:24:56,419 --> 00:24:58,620
So the wedding was...

537
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:01,623
Was pretty much the
first time I met you.

538
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:05,260
I'd imagined so many
different things to say to you.

539
00:25:05,262 --> 00:25:08,271
Still can't believe I went
with "Remember to say 'I do.'"

540
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,468
I guess things don't always
go the way you plan them.

541
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,940
You're not stuck here, are you?

542
00:25:25,715 --> 00:25:28,516
I found it in the museum archive.

543
00:25:28,518 --> 00:25:32,053
Negative tachyons, harnessed on demand.

544
00:25:32,055 --> 00:25:36,391
Really should work on
that poker face, I guess.

545
00:25:36,393 --> 00:25:37,859
This didn't have to be a secret.

546
00:25:37,861 --> 00:25:39,661
Why did you keep this from us?

547
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:42,092
Because if you knew I
could have gone home,

548
00:25:42,095 --> 00:25:43,461
you would have sent me back

549
00:25:43,464 --> 00:25:45,464
the second I walked
into Grandpa's house.

550
00:25:45,467 --> 00:25:46,966
I mean, it's like you said, Dad.

551
00:25:46,969 --> 00:25:49,637
Speedsters have to be responsible.

552
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:52,173
But... but I'm not responsible, am I?

553
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:56,295
I'm... just selfish

554
00:25:56,298 --> 00:26:01,883
and really, really bad
at being a speedster.

555
00:26:01,885 --> 00:26:03,518
Nora, you're not bad.

556
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:08,556
I mean, I can do some
cool things, you know?

557
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:11,459
Sometimes, I run so fast,
I reverse time a bit,

558
00:26:11,461 --> 00:26:14,128
but I can't do the things you can.

559
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:19,033
I don't even know how to phase yet.

560
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:27,242
Guess there's only so much
you can learn from a museum.

561
00:26:27,244 --> 00:26:31,479
What about your mom?

562
00:26:31,481 --> 00:26:34,006
Yeah, I... she's around, you know?

563
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,018
It's just, uh... Just me and her.

564
00:26:38,121 --> 00:26:39,554
I'm sorry.

565
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,522
Yeah, I know.

566
00:26:41,524 --> 00:26:43,191
I shouldn't have lied.

567
00:26:43,193 --> 00:26:46,828
I just wanted to see you so badly

568
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:49,163
and spend a day with you.

569
00:26:49,165 --> 00:26:54,702
Go for a run for the
first time together.

570
00:26:54,704 --> 00:26:57,171
I missed all your firsts.

571
00:27:01,044 --> 00:27:04,279
I was so worried about
screwing up your childhood

572
00:27:04,281 --> 00:27:08,049
and screwing up our family, but...

573
00:27:08,051 --> 00:27:10,251
I'm not even there.

574
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:13,701
Barry, we need you in the Cortex.

575
00:27:13,704 --> 00:27:15,857
It's about Gridlock.

576
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:18,626
- I...
- I'm fine. Um...

577
00:27:18,628 --> 00:27:22,497
you need to go fix my mess,
and then I can go home.

578
00:27:31,741 --> 00:27:34,131
I scanned the crime scene
photos and got a match.

579
00:27:34,134 --> 00:27:36,177
This is not Lang's first rodeo.

580
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:39,143
CCPD put out a warrant
for him for carjacking.

581
00:27:39,146 --> 00:27:40,612
He killed the whole crew inside.

582
00:27:40,615 --> 00:27:42,214
And now he absorbs kinetic energy?

583
00:27:42,217 --> 00:27:44,050
He only gets stronger if you punch him,

584
00:27:44,053 --> 00:27:45,820
you shoot him, you
throw him into traffic.

585
00:27:45,822 --> 00:27:47,296
Which could only make the traffic worse.

586
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:49,162
God, I'd hate to be
stuck in that gridlock.

587
00:27:49,165 --> 00:27:52,760
Gridlock... Gridlock...

588
00:27:52,762 --> 00:27:55,163
I came up with the name.

589
00:27:55,165 --> 00:27:58,032
I am fortune's fool.

590
00:27:58,034 --> 00:28:02,069
So how do we find this guy
without Sally the satellite?

591
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:05,498
We don't need a satellite
to hack a cell phone.

592
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:10,051
And if we want to find his
cell phone, we'll find it...

593
00:28:11,829 --> 00:28:13,448
By the airport?

594
00:28:15,311 --> 00:28:18,279
Got it, 'cause he's on a
plane that just took off.

595
00:28:18,282 --> 00:28:20,922
Central City Air, flight number 5201.

596
00:28:20,924 --> 00:28:24,058
Why would he get on a plane?

597
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,227
Because he's gonna crash it.

598
00:28:32,235 --> 00:28:34,435
We are currently cruising at 34,000 feet.

599
00:28:34,437 --> 00:28:36,157
We anticipate a smooth landing,

600
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,326
so sit back and enjoy...

601
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:39,006
Excuse me, sir.

602
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,675
If you could please fasten your seatbelt

603
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,143
until we reach cruising altitude

604
00:28:42,145 --> 00:28:44,212
and the captain turns
off the seatbelt sign.

605
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:51,018
Are you gonna buckle that thing in too?

606
00:28:52,622 --> 00:28:54,154
Well, it must be something priceless

607
00:28:54,157 --> 00:28:56,591
to get its own seat.

608
00:28:56,593 --> 00:28:58,693
Jewels, maybe.

609
00:29:25,314 --> 00:29:26,761
The plane just lost an engine.

610
00:29:26,764 --> 00:29:28,631
It's headed for downtown.

611
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:30,678
If Gridlock takes out the other engine,

612
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:32,652
the pilot won't be able
to avoid the buildings.

613
00:29:34,437 --> 00:29:36,137
Thousands of people will die.

614
00:29:36,139 --> 00:29:38,745
Not if you phase the plane
through the buildings.

615
00:29:38,748 --> 00:29:40,441
I read about you doing the same thing

616
00:29:40,443 --> 00:29:43,845
to a plane in the future when
you were fighting Mob Rule.

617
00:29:43,847 --> 00:29:46,714
Can you two do that?

618
00:29:46,716 --> 00:29:48,649
A plane?

619
00:29:48,651 --> 00:29:50,351
No... I mean, no, I don't think so.

620
00:29:50,353 --> 00:29:51,619
I mean, I think it's too big.

621
00:29:56,126 --> 00:29:57,623
The three of us.

622
00:29:57,626 --> 00:29:59,527
I mean, the three of us
might be able to do it.

623
00:29:59,529 --> 00:30:01,229
Well, I can't phase anything.

624
00:30:01,231 --> 00:30:04,465
I can't even phase myself,
let alone at G-Force.

625
00:30:04,467 --> 00:30:06,634
Wait, G-For... G-Force, that's it.

626
00:30:06,636 --> 00:30:08,336
The plane is still ascending.

627
00:30:08,338 --> 00:30:09,804
Once he blows up the other engine,

628
00:30:09,806 --> 00:30:11,839
it's gonna slow down and point downwards

629
00:30:11,841 --> 00:30:13,141
before it starts its descent.

630
00:30:13,143 --> 00:30:14,542
That'll give us about ten seconds

631
00:30:14,544 --> 00:30:16,378
- of zero Gs on the plane.
- Yeah.

632
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,678
And zero Gs means no kinetic energy,

633
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,324
means Gridlock has no powers.

634
00:30:19,327 --> 00:30:21,082
Can you breach them onto the plane?

635
00:30:21,084 --> 00:30:22,316
A plane goes way too fast.

636
00:30:22,318 --> 00:30:23,718
I'd need to see it in person.

637
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,353
- Then go.
- But I don't have a suit.

638
00:30:25,355 --> 00:30:27,055
I actually have a backup.

639
00:30:28,858 --> 00:30:32,160
I got more than just a list
of metas from that museum.

640
00:30:49,245 --> 00:30:51,579
Damn, Gina. I made that?

641
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:53,514
Uh, Ryan Choi, actually.

642
00:30:53,516 --> 00:30:56,250
Oh, this is a supersuit.

643
00:30:56,252 --> 00:30:58,252
- No offense.
- None taken.

644
00:31:11,101 --> 00:31:12,917
Guys, he just took out the other engine.

645
00:31:14,537 --> 00:31:16,070
You can do this.

646
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,780
Uh, don't drink and vibe.
I feel like I'm gonna hurl.

647
00:31:31,955 --> 00:31:33,221
It's slowing.

648
00:31:33,223 --> 00:31:34,889
Guys, you've got ten seconds.

649
00:31:37,093 --> 00:31:38,926
Ten.

650
00:31:38,928 --> 00:31:40,728
Nine.

651
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,163
Eight.

652
00:31:42,165 --> 00:31:44,065
Seven.

653
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:45,633
Six.

654
00:31:45,635 --> 00:31:48,035
Five.

655
00:31:48,037 --> 00:31:50,371
Four.

656
00:31:50,373 --> 00:31:52,740
Three.

657
00:31:52,742 --> 00:31:54,475
Two.

658
00:31:54,478 --> 00:31:55,616
One.

659
00:32:11,728 --> 00:32:14,061
Okay, everybody stay calm, all right?

660
00:32:14,063 --> 00:32:15,866
Just stay calm.

661
00:32:19,217 --> 00:32:20,501
All right, come on.

662
00:32:26,442 --> 00:32:28,342
Hey, take a wall, all right?

663
00:32:29,479 --> 00:32:31,646
We got this.

664
00:32:32,882 --> 00:32:34,315
Barry, hurry.

665
00:32:41,158 --> 00:32:43,658
- It's not working.
- What?

666
00:32:44,994 --> 00:32:46,661
I can't do this.

667
00:32:46,663 --> 00:32:49,463
All right, yes... Listen
to me, just breathe.

668
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:52,800
Feel the floor beneath your feet.

669
00:32:52,802 --> 00:32:54,368
Feel the rumble of the plane.

670
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,003
Feel the air.

671
00:32:56,005 --> 00:32:58,256
Feel that wind on your face,

672
00:32:58,259 --> 00:33:00,341
- and the lightning.
- And the lightning.

673
00:33:00,343 --> 00:33:02,910
Feel its electricity
pumping through your veins,

674
00:33:02,912 --> 00:33:04,579
traveling to every nerve in your body

675
00:33:04,581 --> 00:33:06,447
like a shock you never want to end.

676
00:33:06,449 --> 00:33:08,975
- You are no longer you now.
- You're no longer you.

677
00:33:08,978 --> 00:33:10,298
You're part of something greater.

678
00:33:10,334 --> 00:33:11,660
You're part of something greater.

679
00:33:11,663 --> 00:33:13,221
Part of the Speed Force.

680
00:33:13,223 --> 00:33:14,488
That's right.

681
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:17,158
All right, it's ours.

682
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,793
Now, let's do it.

683
00:33:25,947 --> 00:33:28,314
Everybody hold on!

684
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,757
Hold on!

685
00:34:06,242 --> 00:34:08,242
Are you okay?

686
00:34:10,246 --> 00:34:12,446
Nice.

687
00:34:16,286 --> 00:34:17,985
You phased.

688
00:34:17,987 --> 00:34:19,754
For the first time!

689
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,739
Well, Gridlock's off to
Iron Heights' meta wing.

690
00:34:29,741 --> 00:34:33,109
Where he won't be moving
from for a very long time.

691
00:34:33,111 --> 00:34:35,011
Thanks to your help.

692
00:34:35,013 --> 00:34:36,913
I'm glad we got to team up.

693
00:34:36,915 --> 00:34:38,315
Me too.

694
00:34:38,317 --> 00:34:39,983
Ladies and gentleman,

695
00:34:39,985 --> 00:34:43,853
say hello to the tachyon
absorption enhancer 2.5,

696
00:34:43,855 --> 00:34:45,987
now complete with
completely recalibrated

697
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,524
Time Bureau technology.

698
00:34:47,526 --> 00:34:50,093
We haven't tested it yet,
but it should counterbalance

699
00:34:50,095 --> 00:34:52,195
the negative tachyons in Nora's cells.

700
00:34:52,197 --> 00:34:53,830
Here you go, Billy Pilgrim.

701
00:34:53,832 --> 00:34:56,232
Consider yourself unstuck in time.

702
00:34:56,234 --> 00:34:58,034
So I can run home now?

703
00:34:58,036 --> 00:35:01,104
Or...

704
00:35:01,106 --> 00:35:03,707
maybe we hit pause on this thing.

705
00:35:03,709 --> 00:35:06,242
You want Nora to stay?

706
00:35:06,244 --> 00:35:08,678
Um, yeah, I thought

707
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,280
getting her home was our priority.

708
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:12,349
No, it is, I just...

709
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:14,459
Now, I'm thinking that
maybe we should make sure

710
00:35:14,462 --> 00:35:16,349
her powers are working correctly

711
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,788
before we send her home.

712
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:21,209
And what about the timeline?

713
00:35:21,212 --> 00:35:22,759
It's risky, but I don't know.

714
00:35:22,761 --> 00:35:24,761
I mean, Wally and I
were talking about it.

715
00:35:24,763 --> 00:35:26,496
Yeah, the Legends have a theory.

716
00:35:26,498 --> 00:35:29,299
Uh, there are some historical
events that are soft.

717
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:30,734
Basically, you change those,

718
00:35:30,736 --> 00:35:32,569
it's not going to affect much else,

719
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:34,170
like catching Gridlock late.

720
00:35:34,172 --> 00:35:36,072
And then, there are
those that are fixed.

721
00:35:36,074 --> 00:35:38,508
You mess with them, and
all sorts of craziness

722
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,110
starts to happen.

723
00:35:40,112 --> 00:35:41,690
Like the night my mom died.

724
00:35:41,693 --> 00:35:44,481
Changing that created Flashpoint.

725
00:35:46,178 --> 00:35:49,354
It looks like Nora is
gonna need a place to stay.

726
00:35:49,357 --> 00:35:52,622
Uh, yes, and I'll stay in the lounge.

727
00:35:52,624 --> 00:35:54,657
What lounge?

728
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:56,259
This lounge.

729
00:35:56,261 --> 00:35:57,627
Ah.

730
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:06,469
- Damn.
- Dad.

731
00:36:06,471 --> 00:36:08,872
- You found my spot.
- You knew about this?

732
00:36:08,874 --> 00:36:12,275
I've been napping in here since day one.

733
00:36:12,277 --> 00:36:15,521
Uh, well, Nora was gonna stay here,

734
00:36:15,524 --> 00:36:17,291
if that's all right with you.

735
00:36:17,294 --> 00:36:22,217
Okay, well, now I can get
to know my granddaughter.

736
00:36:24,856 --> 00:36:26,289
Mm.

737
00:36:28,894 --> 00:36:31,828
I'm sorry, you met Elvis?

738
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,696
Met him?

739
00:36:33,698 --> 00:36:36,966
Uncle Wally fought the
ghost of his twin brother.

740
00:36:36,968 --> 00:36:39,014
I, uh... I went to a monastery,

741
00:36:39,017 --> 00:36:41,036
and I was trying to find myself,

742
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:42,639
but I was really close.

743
00:36:42,641 --> 00:36:44,340
Then, the Legends came,
they swooped me up,

744
00:36:44,342 --> 00:36:46,876
and life got even more crazy.

745
00:36:46,878 --> 00:36:49,145
You want to go back, don't you?

746
00:36:49,147 --> 00:36:51,347
I can't. I mean, I just got here.

747
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:54,250
I don't want to leave the
team. I don't want to leave you.

748
00:36:54,252 --> 00:37:00,156
Wally, everybody in this
room loves you, especially me.

749
00:37:00,158 --> 00:37:05,195
But you didn't finish
what you set out to do,

750
00:37:05,197 --> 00:37:08,398
and nobody's gonna get in your way.

751
00:37:09,923 --> 00:37:12,602
So promise me, when you
find what you're looking for,

752
00:37:12,604 --> 00:37:14,764
come back, or you're gonna have

753
00:37:14,767 --> 00:37:18,241
a very angry-looking
dad in your zen garden.

754
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,546
Will you take care of him, XS?

755
00:37:23,548 --> 00:37:25,281
You got it, Kid Flash.

756
00:37:25,283 --> 00:37:27,484
Hmm.

757
00:37:28,954 --> 00:37:31,020
You okay?

758
00:37:31,022 --> 00:37:32,842
Yeah.

759
00:37:32,845 --> 00:37:35,646
I thought I missed out on my
chance to connect with Nora,

760
00:37:35,649 --> 00:37:40,685
but now that she's
staying, I get another shot.

761
00:37:40,688 --> 00:37:42,899
If you could have
seen her on that plane,

762
00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:44,868
you'd know that you guys
are already connected.

763
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:47,103
Really?

764
00:37:47,105 --> 00:37:51,207
She was fearless, just like you.

765
00:37:55,947 --> 00:37:59,082
- We have a daughter together.
- Yeah.

766
00:37:59,084 --> 00:38:02,452
We make a person.

767
00:38:02,454 --> 00:38:06,122
In the end, everything works out.

768
00:38:06,124 --> 00:38:08,291
We get our happy ending.

769
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:21,604
Hey.

770
00:38:21,606 --> 00:38:23,420
If Barry can go back in time,

771
00:38:23,423 --> 00:38:26,809
why didn't he stop the
Thinker from killing me?

772
00:38:26,811 --> 00:38:28,144
Kidding, I'm kidding.

773
00:38:28,146 --> 00:38:29,345
Guys, I'm kidding.

774
00:38:29,347 --> 00:38:30,613
I realize that could have upset

775
00:38:30,615 --> 00:38:32,482
the delicate balance of the universe.

776
00:38:32,484 --> 00:38:33,917
Besides, if he did that, who knows?

777
00:38:33,919 --> 00:38:36,019
He might have created a timeline where

778
00:38:36,021 --> 00:38:38,421
I died in that particle
accelerator explosion.

779
00:38:38,423 --> 00:38:39,923
Wishful thinking.

780
00:38:39,925 --> 00:38:42,018
Kidding. I'm glad you're here,

781
00:38:42,021 --> 00:38:43,616
and I'm glad that we don't
have to hold your hand

782
00:38:43,618 --> 00:38:45,519
through the time travel
thing, you're figuring it out.

783
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:47,795
Yeah, well, time travel's
not the only mystery I solved.

784
00:38:47,798 --> 00:38:49,074
While you guys were fighting Gridlock,

785
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:52,335
I was, uh, running this down.

786
00:38:52,337 --> 00:38:55,171
- What's this?
- An answer.

787
00:38:55,173 --> 00:38:57,006
And a lot more questions.

788
00:39:02,047 --> 00:39:04,814
It's my father's death certificate.

789
00:39:04,816 --> 00:39:06,950
A friend at county
helped me out with that.

790
00:39:06,952 --> 00:39:10,687
The ME who signed off
on it, Cameron Mahkent?

791
00:39:10,689 --> 00:39:12,589
He doesn't exist.

792
00:39:12,591 --> 00:39:14,357
So then, this death certificate...

793
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:16,626
Is a fake.

794
00:39:20,365 --> 00:39:23,378
You should get some rest.
You've had a long day.

795
00:39:23,381 --> 00:39:24,867
Ooh, I'll try.

796
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:26,904
I'm just so excited. Like, literally.

797
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:29,472
Phasing excited all of the
electron clouds in my body.

798
00:39:29,474 --> 00:39:31,178
Well, if you're not tired,

799
00:39:31,189 --> 00:39:34,112
two scoops of cookie dough
ice cream sound good right now.

800
00:39:34,115 --> 00:39:35,214
From Happy Harbor?

801
00:39:35,217 --> 00:39:36,846
If that's okay with you.

802
00:39:38,483 --> 00:39:40,683
It is, yeah.

803
00:39:40,685 --> 00:39:43,486
Just, uh, bring me back some mint chip.

804
00:39:50,195 --> 00:39:52,095
My name is Nora West Allen,

805
00:39:52,097 --> 00:39:54,162
and I'm the fastest woman alive.

806
00:39:54,165 --> 00:39:56,298
When I was a child,
my father disappeared

807
00:39:56,301 --> 00:39:58,067
in something impossible.

808
00:39:58,069 --> 00:40:01,671
Then I grew up and
became the impossible.

809
00:40:01,673 --> 00:40:04,389
Now I'm trying to live up
to the legacy he created

810
00:40:04,392 --> 00:40:07,543
so that one day, I'll stop
him from ever disappearing.

811
00:40:07,545 --> 00:40:09,443
I'm XS.

812
00:40:09,446 --> 00:40:11,776
How schway is that?

813
00:40:43,348 --> 00:40:45,782
CCPD! Stay where you are.

814
00:40:45,784 --> 00:40:47,383
Freeze, don't move.

815
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,045
Who the hell are you?

816
00:41:23,973 --> 00:41:27,575
Wh... what do you want?

817
00:41:27,578 --> 00:41:31,413
For all of you to die.

818
00:41:41,574 --> 00:41:45,662
