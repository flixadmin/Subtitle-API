1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:03,270
- Previously,
on "Legends of Tomorrow..."

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,440
- Come with us.
The choice is yours.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,440
- What's next for you, love?

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,030
- I guess I'll give life
above ground a fair shot.

5
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,400
- Aha.

6
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,950
Finally.

7
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,490
- I think this is the end
of the line for me.

8
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,780
- Ah, get in here.
- Aww.

9
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,040
- Whoo.

10
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,810
- Piss off, you bloody guv'nor!

11
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,510
Punks, can't handle
their liquor.

12
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,680
- Is that the ocean?
- No.

13
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,180
And you look like garbage.

14
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,350
- I feel like garbage.

15
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,060
Why don't you, huh?

16
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,690
Where the hell were you
last night?

17
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,270
- I dropped Lita off
at her mom's.

18
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,650
- Oh.

19
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,480
Well, aren't you just
a good dad, huh?

20
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,980
Ow.

21
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,950
Hey.

22
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,320
How come nobody tucked me
into bed, huh?

23
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,200
- You're asking me?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,120
Where's Sara?
- Don't know.

25
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,660
- Oh.

26
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,620
What do you--
Gideon, where's Sara?

27
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,210
- Sara Lance is not on board
the Waverider.

28
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,250
- Sara's missing?

29
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,670
Everyone's missing.

30
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,470
Gideon, who is on board?

31
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,510
- Ava Sharpe, Mick Rory,
and several punks.

32
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,390
- Uh, where could they be?

33
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,930
- Skyemont.

34
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,560
- Why do you say that?
- It's on your hand.

35
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,860
Mick, you're a genius.

36
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,190
Maybe it's from Sara.
Let's go.

37
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,780
Oh, God. Okay.
No, no, no, no, no.

38
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,260
- London, 1977.

39
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,130
The tangled knot of grime,
the stodgy monarchy.

40
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,600
This collision of punk rock
and aristocracy

41
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,680
slamming into each other
like two doomed worlds, this--

42
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,230
- This is a lot at 7:00 a.m.,
John.

43
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,850
I'm glad you're
in a good mood though.

44
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,230
- Well, why shouldn't I be?

45
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,150
You see, my soul
finally belongs to me.

46
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,650
Astra is redeemed,

47
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,450
and--

48
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,450
I get to wake up next to you,
you lovely creature.

49
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,530
- Mm.

50
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,830
- How are you feeling?

51
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,250
- I think a no-strings-attached
hookup every now and then

52
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,290
is good for the soul.

53
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,040
- Even if it's with a guy
whose only coat

54
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,790
smells like booze
and cigarettes.

55
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,720
- Ugh.
Oh, hel-lo.

56
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,260
- Oh.
Sorry, guys.

57
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,970
You, uh, missed the party.

58
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,300
- Wait, are you two--

59
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,100
- Yeah.
- Uh-oh.

60
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,390
Okay, sorry.
I'm not judging, I just--

61
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,940
it's none of my business.
I'm fine.

62
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,360
It's an involuntary reaction.

63
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,520
- We should burn the room.

64
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,690
- Hey, at least we know

65
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,240
how to use protection, Pops.

66
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,200
Do either of you know
where Sara is?

67
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,740
- Uh, we seem to have
lost track of her.

68
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,620
- Oh.
Someone did hand me this.

69
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,870
Is this anything?

70
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,500
- I call.

71
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,300
- Full house, fellas.

72
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,880
- That's three in a row.

73
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:03,390
She's a shady card sharp.

74
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,550
- Oh, no.
Just lucky.

75
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,390
What about now?

76
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,110
- Still lucky
and now also richer.

77
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,070
I just love toying
with these poor mortals.

78
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,990
- Oh, yeah, well you are one of
these poor mortals now, love.

79
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,410
Try remembering that
the next time

80
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,710
you come across one
with a gun, yeah?

81
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,460
- Astra, have you seen Sara?

82
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,960
- Uh, not recently.
Maybe ask Behrad.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,750
- Yeah, where is my brother?

84
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,420
- I can't believe how much
we have in common.

85
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,760
It's like we're riding
the same cosmic vibe, you know?

86
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,510
We just click.

87
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,930
It's like we were destined
to connect in this moment.

88
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,310
- Hey, wrap it up Behrad.

89
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,930
- We gonna pick this up later.

90
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,480
Cheerio.

91
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,060
- Hey.
Have you seen Sara?

92
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,190
- No.
- Ugh!

93
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,350
- Maybe she's with Nate.

94
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,810
He was headed back to the club.

95
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,360
- Back?
Why?

96
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,530
- We met Starman
at the after-after.

97
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,360
Said he had to prep
for his show there tonight.

98
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,320
- What the hell's a Starman?

99
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,490
- Major T?

100
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,040
Ziggy Stardust?

101
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,200
- Bowie!

102
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,500
He's talking about David Bowie.

103
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,170
- See, my girlfriend's
from another time.

104
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,500
- Oh, like the future.

105
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,050
- No.
Well...

106
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,170
technically, yes,
but she's from the future

107
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,970
with a different
timeline entirely.

108
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,050
Now she lives in a Totem.

109
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,970
And I'm forced
to be at peace with it.

110
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,390
- What's her name?

111
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,270
- Zari.

112
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,520
Her name is Zari.

113
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,610
And I'm afraid I'm never
gonna see her again.

114
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,320
Hi, Zari.

115
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,740
Hey, guys.
This is David Bowie.

116
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,200
- Marvelous.

117
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,240
- Okay, Nate.
We're looking for Sara.

118
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,780
Is she here with you?

119
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,580
- Last time I saw her
was at the concert.

120
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,580
I figured she was with you.

121
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,170
- Did he just say
"disappeared"?

122
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,880
Sara disappeared.
Is he singing about Sara?

123
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,130
- Deh, deh, deh--do not
interrupt David's process.

124
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,930
He's trying to cheer me up
by singing a song about Zari.

125
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,140
1.0, not you.
- Obviously.

126
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,180
Still weird.

127
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,400
- Guys, blonde hair.

128
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,650
Does that not remind you
of Sara?

129
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,620
- Bowie!
Cut that crap out!

130
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,700
- Hey, listen, mate.

131
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,780
Is that song you're singing

132
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,580
about Nate's sad love life?

133
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,830
- No, mate.

134
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,120
- Are you singing
about Sara Lance?

135
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,500
- Is that her name?

136
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,920
Your friend who got sucked up

137
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,290
into a spaceship?

138
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,880
- W--sucked into a spaceship?

139
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,130
- Isn't it wild?

140
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,010
- So you saw this
with your own

141
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,390
beautiful, asymmetrical eyes?

142
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,140
- I was filming that night
on my Super 8.

143
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,270
See for yourself.

144
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,690
- Okay.
Film is developed.

145
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,650
Let's see what Bowie saw.

146
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,620
- You lads are out
of this world.

147
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,370
- David freaking Bowie?

148
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,250
You're a Smell fan?
- They're something else.

149
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,370
- Hey, wait, wait, wait.
I gotta--I gotta let you in

150
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,380
on a little secret, all right,
David freaking Bowie?

151
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,500
'Cause tonight--tonight,
I am going

152
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,880
to propose to my girlfriend!

153
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,390
Holy--

154
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,190
Wish me luck.

155
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,990
- Whoa.

156
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,450
She's a space girl.

157
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,830
- Ava--
- Okay.

158
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,870
Um, Sara's been abducted so,

159
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,540
uh, Sara's been abducted.

160
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,880
Uh...I'll be right back.

161
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,720
- So she's a mess.

162
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,680
- All right, so let's just
give her some space.

163
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,010
In the meantime,
what do we know about aliens?

164
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,310
- Literally nothing.

165
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,560
- They're green.

166
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,020
- Listen, you fools.

167
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,390
Sara's missing

168
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,190
because you guys
were partying last night.

169
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,190
We have to find her.
We're running out of time.

170
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,340
- Time to get organized.

171
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,180
- Ava, you're back.
- Mm-hmm.

172
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,640
- Oh.
Whoa.

173
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,930
- Here you go.

174
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,100
- Girl, are you okay?
- What?

175
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,770
I'm fine.
Why?

176
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,150
- Well, we just thought that--

177
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,650
- You know,
with Sara being lost,

178
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,190
you may wanna sit this one out.

179
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,740
- Uh, she is not lost.
She is pre-found.

180
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,530
There's a solution to every
problem including this one.

181
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,490
- Wow, indexed.
Thorough.

182
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,070
- You are all
the best of the best.

183
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,200
If we handle this logically
and rationally,

184
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,700
we will get Sara back, okay?

185
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,950
- Right, well, uh,
this a waste of time.

186
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I've got a better idea.
- Oh?

187
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,880
- Yeah, ever since
I rescued her from Purgatory,

188
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,380
Sara and I have
a psychic connection.

189
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,880
It'll allow me to locate her,

190
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,260
and everything I need
is at the mansion.

191
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,880
- Damn it, John.
That's insubordinate.

192
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,220
But I won't try to stop you.

193
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,890
- You know, he's actually
most effective

194
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,300
not left to his own devices.

195
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,970
I can just--
- Thank you, Z.

196
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,930
- We're gonna fix this.
- Mm-hmm.

197
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,350
Astra, would you mind keeping
them on mission please?

198
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,020
- Uh, I'm not really
on the team, so...

199
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,480
- We're accepting outside help.
Thank you.

200
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,070
- Okay. I think I need
to just calm down

201
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,870
and do some "research."

202
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,910
- Really?
Right now?

203
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,080
Dude, Sara needs us!

204
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,450
- I'm freaking out here, man.

205
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,910
- Aw, come on, B.

206
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,460
Ah, Mick.
Perfect timing.

207
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,170
I need you to check
on any leads you may have

208
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,340
in the underworld please.

209
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,710
- Not gonna work.

210
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,710
This whole thing's
not gonna work.

211
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,670
Nothing works without Sara.

212
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,340
- Okay, so what?
Are you just gonna drink?

213
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,800
That's real mature, Rory.

214
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,140
Real mature.

215
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,350
- Wow. You really got this team
figured out.

216
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,020
- Mm-hmm.
- So what do we do?

217
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,730
- Uh, we are gonna call
the experts, the D.E.O.

218
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,310
- Good idea. Eesh--
- What?

219
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,520
- Is it gonna get weird
between you and Alex Danvers

220
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,440
'cause she and Sara
had a fling?

221
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,610
- It's--swing a dead cat.
Sara never liked to be alone.

222
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,230
- Are you okay?

223
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,270
Whoa.

224
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,730
Who are you?

225
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,690
- I'm Spartacus,
the Undefeatable.

226
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,990
- Oh.
Yeah, that "undefeatable" part

227
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,740
didn't quite stick, but...

228
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,580
- Uh, wait.

229
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,200
Hey, get back here!

230
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,100
- Sorry.
Did you find Sara?

231
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,350
- No.

232
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,310
Care to wet your whistle?

233
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,770
- I'm confused.
What did you learn?

234
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,150
That Sara Lance is

235
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,650
far beyond my reach.

236
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,150
- You told Ava
you could reach her.

237
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,030
- Yeah, well, I overpromised.

238
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,870
- You can't just give up
on Sara.

239
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,620
There's got to be
something you can do.

240
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,040
- Come on. Anything?
- Look--

241
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,830
aliens took her, all right?
To space.

242
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,710
This is really not my area
of expertise.

243
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,210
Now if it was a ghost,
or a demon,

244
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,750
or even a handle of whiskey,

245
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,510
I could help you out
with that, but I'm sorry.

246
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,050
All right?
I'm an astrologer.

247
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,140
And you need an astronomer.

248
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,680
- What an ass.

249
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,390
- Yeah, he does have
that going for him.

250
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,230
- Look, he's right.

251
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,980
This is out of his league.

252
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,900
This is out of all our leagues.

253
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,230
- I disagree.

254
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,360
Astra, let's talk
about your "network."

255
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,860
- My network?

256
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,160
I've been on Earth
for, like, five minutes.

257
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,990
- Exactly.

258
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,710
- Gideon, why isn't
the D.E.O. answering?

259
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,630
- The Department
of Extranormal Operations

260
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,630
was destroyed in the infamous
year 2020 by Rama Khan.

261
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,460
- Nate, this is a huge setback.

262
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,720
We needed the D.E.O.
Aliens is their jurisdiction.

263
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,340
- Yeah.

264
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,930
- Captain Sharpe,
I believe we are dealing

265
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,470
with a temporal anomaly.

266
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,010
According to
the original timeline,

267
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,350
there was no alien spacecraft

268
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,180
over London in 1977.

269
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,150
- Meaning this is
our jurisdiction.

270
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,310
- Huh?
- We're the experts.

271
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,440
No.

272
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,360
We're--we're the experts?

273
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,440
- Damn right we are.

274
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,200
You, me, the Legends.

275
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,570
We're the only people
who are capable

276
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,490
of handling
time-traveling aliens.

277
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,330
- Nate, if I trusted the team,

278
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,540
I wouldn't have made an entire
binder to get rid of them.

279
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,830
Okay?
The D.E.O. was plan A.

280
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,370
Well, Ava, you are now
in charge of the Legends.

281
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,460
So welcome to plan B.

282
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,750
Now breathe it in.

283
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,750
Breathe with me.
- No.

284
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,750
- Come.

285
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,090
- Plan B smells like pot.

286
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,510
- I got something.

287
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,140
- You are a walking
contact high.

288
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,970
- You're welcome.
Gideon, put this up.

289
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,100
- That's a cute little kid.

290
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,390
- B, that's a tabloid.

291
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,980
- Yes, tabloids
help me not think

292
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,690
about how we live
on a technological terror

293
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,860
hurtling through
a swirling green nightmare.

294
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,360
- Damn.

295
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,900
- So this girl,
Esperanza Cruz,

296
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,780
says that she was abducted
by aliens,

297
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,490
and from then on, she could
communicate with them.

298
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,530
They implanted something
in her head.

299
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,040
- B!

300
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,700
I'm s--this is a tabloid, okay?

301
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,160
From how--what, 20 years ago?

302
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,580
It's probably
totally fabricated.

303
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,830
I need real leads.
- She's real, man.

304
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,590
Gideon located her.
- I mean...

305
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,260
little kid
with alien tech in her head.

306
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,420
Not a bad lead.

307
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,590
- Okay, sure.
Fine.

308
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,680
You know? Whatever.
It's all we've got.

309
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,510
I mean, Rory's probably
good and boozed up by now,

310
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,010
so why don't you take Micky

311
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,720
and go investigate
this Esperanza--

312
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,480
what is her last name?
- Uh, Cruz.

313
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,390
Are we really sure bringing
Mick to talk to a kid

314
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,770
is, like, best practices?
- No, n--

315
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,650
You're gonna go see her
present day.

316
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,320
Some of us are still trying
not to mess with the timeline.

317
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,610
- Right.
The timeline.

318
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,530
Aye-aye.

319
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,200
- You're excused.

320
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,660
Ugh!

321
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,920
- What is it?
- I was confined to one

322
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,290
of these glass prisons.

323
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,750
You were as well.

324
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,670
Which means there
are also others inside.

325
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,170
- You just figured
that out now?

326
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,260
- I did.

327
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,720
I also commanded an army

328
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,640
of 120,000 slaves,
gladiators, and peasants

329
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,060
against the Roman republic.

330
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,140
- Yeah, I've heard.
- Mm, excellent.

331
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,890
Then we'll liberate
our fellow prisoners

332
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,850
and we'll lead a rebellion
against our captors.

333
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,690
- Wait, no.
We don't know who's in there.

334
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,440
- Rise, compatriot.

335
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,530
I am your savior.
I am Spartacus!

336
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,040
- What, pray tell, are you?

337
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,000
A Saxon?

338
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,170
- Nope, that's definitely
an alien.

339
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,690
Hey, a little help here!

340
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,510
- The thrill of the battle.

341
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,600
Reminds me of being back
in the Colosseum.

342
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,230
- Yeah, you just stand there
in the Colosseum too?

343
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,480
- I was letting it
tire itself out.

344
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,400
If it had slain you,
I would've been well-rested

345
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,900
and easily avenged your death.

346
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,320
- Being an avenger is stupid.

347
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,860
The goal is to prevent death.
I am a Preventer.

348
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,490
You wanna join the Preventers,
Sparty?

349
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,580
- Yeah--yes?

350
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,080
- Good choice.

351
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,500
Now stop opening pods.

352
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,080
We're gonna go find
who's flying the ship,

353
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,920
and we're gonna prevent them
from breathing.

354
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,050
- I'm telling you.

355
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,430
Sara ain't here.
It's a waste of our time.

356
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,350
- We're gonna find Sara.

357
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,850
The fact that we found
this person is a sign.

358
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,100
And when the universe
shows you a sign,

359
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,480
you should believe it.

360
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,900
- Is that right?

361
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,980
The universe exists
for one reason.

362
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,530
To kill you.

363
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,330
Hello.
Miss Cruz?

364
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,790
Ma'am?

365
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,120
Hm.
Must not be home.

366
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,840
- Let's not tell Miss Cruz
we broke in.

367
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,620
- When they split up, we'll
take them out one by one.

368
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,960
- Nonsense.

369
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,540
We have the element
of surprise.

370
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,840
We attack both savages now,

371
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,210
and we slay them
in one fell swoop.

372
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,960
- We have no idea
what they're capable of.

373
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,340
Look, I was an assassin.

374
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,090
Rule number one:
isolate your targets.

375
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,140
- Do not fight
from the shadows.

376
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,760
I commanded an undefeated army
of 120,000 warriors.

377
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:23,680
- Well, I assure you
they are all dead now.

378
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,100
- Then I must avenge them.

379
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,310
- No, no avenging.
No avenging.

380
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,400
It's preventing!

381
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,020
- Prepare to die, savages!

382
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,850
- I am very, very sorry, David,
you're under pressure.

383
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,690
Look, maybe I can help you.

384
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,980
Ooh, whoa, whoa.

385
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,320
Why would you do that?
- Astra has a lead.

386
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,860
- Okay.

387
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,360
All right.
She has a lead.

388
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,370
- Go ahead.

389
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,740
- So I heard about this guy
who was once in hell.

390
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,330
Raved about aliens.

391
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,080
His name was Aleister Crowley.

392
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,080
Aleister bloody Crowley.

393
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,670
Come off it.
Crowley's a kook.

394
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,960
- That is
the conventional wisdom.

395
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,750
But he had this tome of secrets

396
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,010
called the "Book of the Law."

397
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,170
- In it, Crowley detailed

398
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,920
these alien encounters

399
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,050
and spells that
these aliens taught him.

400
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,890
But he disappeared from hell.

401
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:45,270
Maybe he used these
alien spells to escape.

402
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,100
- Yeah.
Crowley didn't escape.

403
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,690
All right?

404
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,730
I summoned him, and then
I trapped him on Earth.

405
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,400
- You trapped--sorry--
isn't that a felony?

406
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,070
- No.

407
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,400
But like most things I do,
it probably should be.

408
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,780
So, what'd
you do with the book, John?

409
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,160
- All right, okay.

410
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,620
Being as we don't have
any other ideas,

411
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,700
I kept it safe right over...

412
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,710
Gary!

413
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,250
What'd I tell you
about nicking my things, eh?

414
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,100
- Why did you kidnap me?

415
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,770
- Gary!

416
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,570
Gary!

417
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,780
Bloody hell Gary
would be reading Crowley,

418
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,780
I have no idea.
There it is.

419
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,490
- Find it?

420
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,910
- What the hell is that?

421
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,330
- Ew.

422
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,960
- You better help me
understand you,

423
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,420
or this is gonna end quick.

424
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,680
- Hey!
Hands where I can see them.

425
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,940
Gary?

426
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,860
- Please don't be mad.

427
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,410
- If she could talk
to aliens,

428
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,830
why would she live
in a redneck dump like this?

429
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,200
- Maybe you're right.
But isn't it worth making sure?

430
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,790
Besides,
Ava really needs a win.

431
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:36,210
- I don't need a win.
We all need a win.

432
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,880
This isn't about me.
Oh, my God.

433
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,340
Don't give me that look.
- What look?

434
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,800
- You know exactly what look.

435
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,470
- "You'll feel better
not bottling up

436
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,970
your emotions" look?
- I'm not bottling them up.

437
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,390
I just don't wanna talk
about them.

438
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,220
- Okay.

439
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,390
I'm just gonna say one thing.
- Nate.

440
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:54,100
- You have not mentioned
Sara's proposal once.

441
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,060
- I am setting aside
my feelings

442
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,020
to focus on the goal
of getting Sara back.

443
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,480
Okay?
You should too.

444
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,570
- I wonder what's in there.

445
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,450
- Let me guess.

446
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,910
More dumb redneck stuff.

447
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,550
Guess she's not such
a dumb redneck after all.

448
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,890
- Guess not.

449
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,900
- Behrad, Mick, answer me.

450
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,360
Great.
Two more abductions.

451
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,740
This is why we don't talk

452
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,320
about emotions
during the mission.

453
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,870
- Okay, Gideon's scanning
for heat signatures.

454
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,080
It's--it's gonna be okay.

455
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,200
- Okay?
- Yeah.

456
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,540
- Three Legends are missing.

457
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,040
Things are pretty far
from okay.

458
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,540
- Yeah, well they just
got further, love.

459
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,000
We found something
in Gary's room.

460
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,420
- A human-sized chrysalis.

461
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,840
- Guys, we don't understand.

462
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,960
- Gary is an alien.

463
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,300
- An alien?
Oh, my--

464
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,510
Okay.
I don't buy it.

465
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:09,010
- Well, we also found these.

466
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,470
- Gary's glasses?

467
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,810
- Oh, allow me to demonstrate.

468
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,230
And brace yourselves.

469
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,570
- No.

470
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,490
Gary abducted Sara.

471
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,500
- I was sent to Earth to kidnap
the quintessential human.

472
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,620
- Spartacus?

473
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,830
- Oh, no, no, no.
You!

474
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,630
Spartacus was just
my boss's lunch.

475
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:43,050
But don't worry.
I don't eat humans.

476
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,880
Anymore.

477
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,260
- Terrific.

478
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,180
- The point is, I couldn't go
through with your abduction

479
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,720
because I fell
in love with you,

480
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,180
with Ava, with all humans.

481
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,350
- Yeah, well that's funny
because I still feel

482
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,890
very abducted, Gary.

483
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,060
- Well, my boss, Kayla,
found us.

484
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,230
But I remained loyal.
That's why I saved you.

485
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,770
- You saved me?
- Yeah!

486
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,360
I rigged the pod to open
with your handprint.

487
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,150
- Okay--Gary,
where are we going?

488
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,820
- No clue.
Kayla doesn't trust me anymore.

489
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,370
I don't blame her.

490
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,450
- Yeah, well, you and I
are also not okay.

491
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,910
Do you have any idea
how wrecked

492
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,790
Ava must feel right now?

493
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,170
I mean, yeah, I'm sure she's
pretending to keep it together

494
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,170
for everyone else's sake,
but inside,

495
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,710
she must be dying.
- Stop, stop!

496
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,630
It's torture to even think
about what Ava's going through.

497
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,140
Do me in.
I deserve it.

498
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,720
I've destroyed the very thing
I most stan.

499
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,600
- Knock it off.
You're gonna help me get home.

500
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,140
Now tell me everything
that you know about this ship.

501
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,190
Well...

502
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,480
when you first met,
you butt heads.

503
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,820
But any fool could tell you two
were meant for each other.

504
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,530
- This spaceship, Gary.

505
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,740
- Oh.

506
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:01,290
What the--what the--hey!

507
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,750
- Ava?

508
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,750
Nate?
- Behrad, are you guys okay?

509
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,340
- Yeah, it is very far
from chill in here.

510
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,300
- 2100 hours.

511
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,930
Trespassers have
regained consciousness.

512
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,100
They were armed
with some fancy weapons.

513
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,260
Not sure why.

514
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,220
Only one way to find out.

515
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,520
- I told you the universe
was trying to kill us.

516
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,020
- What was that, old timer?

517
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,570
- I wasn't talking to you,
Miss Crazy.

518
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,240
- I don't like
being called that.

519
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,280
- He didn't mean that,
Miss Cruz.

520
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,360
- Spooner.

521
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,620
I go by Spooner now.

522
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,370
- Okay, Spooner, ma'am.

523
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:38,620
This is all just
a misunderstanding.

524
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,540
The alien communicator
in your head,

525
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,540
we need you to use it
to find our friend.

526
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,590
- So y'all's plan was not only
to break onto my property,

527
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,130
but to kidnap me?

528
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:50,090
- We were gonna ask.
In fact, we still are.

529
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,720
- What?
- Shh.

530
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,300
Will you come with us?

531
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,180
- Come with you?

532
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,350
Oh, but you ain't going.

533
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,270
- Please hurry.

534
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,520
She's getting real friendly

535
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,820
with her knife.

536
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,110
- Who you talking to?

537
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,200
- Uh, he's a schizophrenic.

538
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,280
He talks to himself.
- It's true.

539
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,580
It's a nervous tick actually.

540
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,160
Uh--could--could--hey.

541
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,960
Wait.
Hey, hey, hey--hey.

542
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,710
Wait, wait.
Hey, hey!

543
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,670
No!

544
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,300
- Behrad?
What's happening?

545
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,590
- Uh, the universe
ripped his comms out.

546
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,350
- Captain Sharpe, I've
pinpointed their location.

547
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,810
- Oh, thank God.

548
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,480
I'm not losing
any more Legends today.

549
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,600
Gideon, take the ship
to that location.

550
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,520
- A ship?

551
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,150
- Nate, you're with me.

552
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,070
Wait, hang on.
Why is my voice echoing?

553
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,530
- She hacked my comms.

554
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:55,320
She can hear everything
you're saying.

555
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,170
- That thing
against the Waverider?

556
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,550
- Whoa!

557
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,390
- Touché, Spooner.

558
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,650
- Please stop shooting my ship.

559
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:28,810
- Don't come any closer.

560
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,020
I ain't gon' let y'all
abduct me again.

561
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,320
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, hold on.

562
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,070
That's what you think this is?
You think we're aliens?

563
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,570
- The hell else could you be?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

564
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,790
We're time travelers.
- Time travelers?

565
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,950
- Yes!
That's our time ship.

566
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,710
Which is also a spaceship,
but that's beside the point.

567
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,170
Look, I'm sorry
that we trespassed, okay?

568
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,590
It was wrong.

569
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,840
But--

570
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,300
We're desperate.

571
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,380
Listen.

572
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:59,550
The woman I love was abducted
by aliens last night.

573
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:02,760
And I just found that
she's gonna propose to me.

574
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,690
I will do anything

575
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:10,980
if you can find her.

576
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,230
Will you please help me?

577
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,570
- Exactly what an alien
would say.

578
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:19,610
- Just--

579
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,330
- Now can I burn
this place down?

580
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,380
- Can we go over the plan
one more time?

581
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,750
Because it still feels
slightly suicidal.

582
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,130
- Well, we don't have
enough fuel

583
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,510
to turn around and go home,
right?

584
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,220
- Uh-huh.
- So we commandeer the ship.

585
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,010
- From Kayla,
my vicious, violent,

586
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,800
and very vindictive boss.

587
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:42,260
- Then we open a wormhole back
to Earth's temporal zone.

588
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,890
- An unstable rip
in spacetime itself.

589
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,390
- And then we fly the ship
through it.

590
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,060
- On whatever fumes remain

591
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,350
after we burn everything

592
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,730
opening the wormhole.

593
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,400
- Well then,
we better get moving.

594
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,030
First things, you gotta go
get rid of your boss.

595
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,110
- Right.
Okay.

596
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,530
Here goes nothing.

597
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:05,000
- Gary, your glasses.

598
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,460
- Whoops.

599
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,000
All right.
Guess we'll do it this way.

600
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:02,220
- Okay.
Wormhole time.

601
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,130
- Morning, sunshine.

602
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,920
- Tables may have turned,

603
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,510
but I ain't going down
without a fight.

604
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,970
- Whoa.
We're not gonna hurt you.

605
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,640
- Look.

606
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,520
- Where the hell am I?

607
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,100
- Like Ava said before,
we're time travelers.

608
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,440
This is our time ship.
- Admit it.

609
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,520
You're only being nice so
I'll help you find your friend.

610
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,940
- 100%.
Yes.

611
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,360
- Even if I wanted
to help y'all, I can't.

612
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,320
- Why not?

613
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,450
- This thing in my head
is like an antenna.

614
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,240
If I send a signal
to your friend,

615
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,740
the aliens who put it there
could find me.

616
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,710
- Look, we have the technology

617
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,080
to remove whatever's
in your head

618
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,840
if--if you help us find Sara.

619
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,960
- How is my signal
gonna locate her?

620
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,710
- It doesn't have to.

621
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,670
Our friend will direct it
to the aliens that she's with.

622
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,470
Oh!
If you think we're weird,

623
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,010
wait till you meet John.

624
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:31,480
- So I send out my signal
and connect to this alien guy.

625
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,140
- His name is Gary.

626
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,980
- He's an alien named Gary?
- Gary Green.

627
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,110
- Ah, Green.
Yeah, now it makes sense.

628
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:40,480
- Once you make the connection,
I'll step into that Sigil

629
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,860
then Astral Project myself

630
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,150
to Gary's location.

631
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,110
And then I'll look for Sara.
- Right.

632
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,570
And how do I connect

633
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,160
to this Gary alien
who I've never met?

634
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,660
- You'll drink a potion
of sorts.

635
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,080
- One delish smoothie
coming at you.

636
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,620
Good luck.
- Crowley's spell requires you

637
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,000
to ingest something of Gary's.

638
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,090
The chrysalis
is all we've got.

639
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:01,210
- Seriously?
- No, she's not gonna--

640
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,670
- The sooner this is over,

641
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,340
the sooner
this thing's out of my head.

642
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,680
But I hope it works.

643
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,470
Salud.

644
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,890
- Oh, God.
- Oh.

645
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,220
- Oh.
- Oh.

646
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,600
- She did it.

647
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,770
- Eh.
Kinda tangy.

648
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,440
All right, um, ready?

649
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,780
Yeah, after my abduction,
I started wearing tinfoil hats.

650
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,450
It blocked any alien signals
I could pick up.

651
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:27,200
- Huh. Nifty.
Right.

652
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,820
On with the show.

653
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,810
- I can feel him.

654
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,270
I found the alien.

655
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,980
A lot dweebier than I thought.

656
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,810
- Bloody Crowley was right.
- I can sense him.

657
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:02,690
He's worried and wants
to come down to Earth.

658
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,530
It looks like he's trying
to help Sara.

659
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,610
- Oh, I just need
to step into the Sigil

660
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:07,780
and find her.

661
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,620
- John, are you okay?

662
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,740
Spooner's connection
is unstable.

663
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,410
I'm giving it everything
just to maintain it.

664
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:15,830
- I'll do it.
- No, whoa, whoa.

665
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,000
Are you crazy?
You'll kill yourself.

666
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,420
Look what's happening to John.

667
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,960
- It's plan B, Nate.
Embrace it.

668
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,680
- Sara?

669
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,980
- Ava.

670
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,110
Wait, how...

671
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,780
How are you...

672
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,360
Are you here?

673
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,610
- Hey, hey, hey.
Stay with me.

674
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:51,530
Look at me.

675
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:54,530
Yes.

676
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,450
- Yes, what?

677
00:34:56,490 --> 00:35:00,420
- When you get home,
I'll marry you.

678
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,790
So you better get home, okay?

679
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,680
I love you.

680
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:14,890
- He's killing himself.

681
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:17,220
We have to stop him.

682
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,780
- John.
Look at me.

683
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,790
- Round two.

684
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,180
- Wormhole's open, Sara!

685
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,070
- Whoa!

686
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,580
- No, no!

687
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,960
Once again, I wake
to Zari Tarazi.

688
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,460
- Oh, you're up?

689
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,880
- I almost died.

690
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,300
But you saved me.

691
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,840
- Yeah, well I couldn't
let you die

692
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,880
right after getting
your soul back, so...

693
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,180
- Gidget said you
might be dehydrated,

694
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,100
so I made you a green smoothie
to help you recover.

695
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,810
Sans alien cocoon.

696
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,640
- Oh, cheers.

697
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:07,560
Mmm.

698
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,860
Yep.

699
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,530
It's very tasty.

700
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:15,150
- Hey, uh, let me know when
you have your strength back.

701
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,460
It's a fling.

702
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,210
- Uh-huh.

703
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:32,050
You know I can tell
when someone's bluffing, right?

704
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,880
It looks like Crowley wasn't.

705
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,170
- Yeah, well,
even if alien magic is real,

706
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,840
Crowley is a slippery fish.

707
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,260
He's not to be trusted.

708
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,430
- Hm.
Whatever you say, roomie.

709
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:45,480
- Hey, that was a short
residence on the Waverider, eh?

710
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,100
- Yeah, I can't keep getting
roped into Legends missions.

711
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,520
Let's just say
I'm not as enamored

712
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,900
of the timeline
as everyone else.

713
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,690
It's like you said,

714
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,200
I'm mortal now.

715
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,450
I wanna see what it's like
to be...normal.

716
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:04,080
Maybe I can love this world
like the rest of you do.

717
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,910
- You've come a long way,
you little Hellspawn.

718
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:11,540
- And come on, John.

719
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,250
Just a fling?

720
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,670
She's got you
on a juice cleanse.

721
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,730
- Sure you won't stick around?

722
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,690
You've got a pretty chill vibe

723
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,940
beneath your gun-toting
outcast vibe.

724
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,980
- Look, we contacted
your friend,

725
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,030
and I'm sorry
she's not back yet.

726
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,440
But I want this thing removed

727
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,030
so I can finally live
a normal life.

728
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,530
- I get that.

729
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:43,030
You wanna keep it zen
in the brain stem.

730
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:46,490
Dr. Gideon will fix you up.

731
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,120
What do you see, Gideon?

732
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,550
- Nothing out of the ordinary.

733
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,420
- Really?
Can you look closer?

734
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,380
- If I removed and thoroughly
dissected her brain,

735
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,340
we might something
the scan did not detect.

736
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,090
May I proceed?

737
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,470
- What's going on out there?

738
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,260
- No.
Don't kill her, Gideon.

739
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,890
- Yeah, I can hear it.

740
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:09,230
- I wasn't gonna let her--

741
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:11,440
- You can't hear it, can you?

742
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,980
They're all around us.

743
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,030
- I've never seen
anything like this

744
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,320
in a temporal zone.

745
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,580
- Aliens.
Lots of 'em.

746
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,660
- They're falling
into the timeline.

747
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:41,010
- Why are you smiling?

748
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,470
We gotta clean this mess up.

749
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,010
- I know.

750
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,510
It's just that the only person

751
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:48,180
who could create
this much mayhem is Sara

752
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,020
which means she's alive.

753
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,730
- Well, if the universe
shows you a sign,

754
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,900
you should believe it.

755
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,150
- Mm!

756
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,570
- Engaged?

757
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:05,160
I'm so happy I could cry.
- Gary, if we don't get

758
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,950
through that wormhole,
we are stuck here.

759
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:09,700
- I'm going as fast as I can.
[straining] I'm sorry.

760
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,960
I'm not as good a pilot
as my fiancé.

761
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,080
- Wait, you and that
other alien are engaged?

762
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:17,960
- Her name's Kayla, but yeah.
I assume the wedding's off now.

763
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,840
Did I not mention that?
- We can talk about this later.

764
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,380
Right now, just get us
through that wormhole.

765
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,050
- Yeah.

766
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,890
- We're gonna make it.

767
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,930
- We're not gonna make it.
- We're gonna make it.

768
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,890
We didn't make it.
