2
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:22,514
Doctor, courier for you.

3
00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:27,815
Sender. Sana. Item.
Flowers. Message. Miss you.

4
00:03:27,988 --> 00:03:29,114
Keep it aside.

5
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:33,923
Switch on the processor.

6
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:41,033
Good. It moves well.

7
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:44,564
Serves you right.

8
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,834
Quiet.

9
00:03:55,115 --> 00:03:56,605
Oh, God.

10
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:01,277
Even you deserve this.

11
00:04:02,923 --> 00:04:07,019
He's kicking us like a
baby in the womb right now.

12
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,420
Imagine our plight
when he's complete.

13
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:48,461
Up. Walk. Yes.

14
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,429
Yes.

15
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:54,906
Oh, no. Pick him up.

16
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:59,239
Coffee?
- Thank you, R-2.

17
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:03,347
Hey, tin-head. One cup strong fil
ter coffee for me as well.

18
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,680
No coffee for grade 02, only water.

19
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:07,777
Hey, you tin-head.
- And for grade 03?

20
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:09,684
Sorry, self-service.

21
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:12,047
There's no worth of a
human being in this lab.

22
00:05:46,793 --> 00:05:47,953
Come on.

23
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:49,721
Walk.

24
00:05:52,065 --> 00:05:54,863
Come on, yes. Yes, walk.

25
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:57,161
Slow.

26
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:02,239
Walk like me. Yes.
Yes. That's right. Yes.

27
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:07,841
Excellent, doctor.

28
00:06:09,115 --> 00:06:10,309
I'll start the data transfer.
- Okay.

29
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:11,679
Verify the connection.

30
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:06,397
He's giving a pose like Bruce Lee.
- Superb.

31
00:07:06,706 --> 00:07:07,934
Come on.

32
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:39,566
Hi, Sana. Long see. No time.

33
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,005
Does anyone check
e-mails and SMS in this lab?

34
00:07:42,075 --> 00:07:45,602
Where is that man? Why does
such a man need a girlfriend?

35
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:48,640
Is he alive inside or..
- He's stuck in the wires.

36
00:07:48,715 --> 00:07:50,478
If I disturb him, he'll get angry.
- Let him be angry.

37
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,915
Tell him Sana is here.

38
00:07:52,152 --> 00:07:53,915
Come on, hurry up.

39
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,585
Sana, do you have a sister?
- No.

40
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,590
Mother.. No.. Brother.
- What?

41
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:02,490
Well, cousin sister? - Can you
please shut down your stupid system?

42
00:08:02,562 --> 00:08:03,927
Control, Alt, delete.

43
00:08:03,997 --> 00:08:05,294
Get out, you stupid.
- Sorry, sir.

44
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:06,730
Don't disturb me.

45
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:11,570
He began hitting me with a motor,
Sana. Said he won't even see Obama.

46
00:08:11,638 --> 00:08:12,832
Did you tell him that Sana is here?

47
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:14,804
I did. He said he'll call you later.

48
00:08:14,874 --> 00:08:16,739
Forget his call.

49
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:28,250
Now I will never see him again.

50
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:31,151
Hello, world.

51
00:08:33,293 --> 00:08:37,195
Hello, world. Hello, world.

52
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:40,359
Hello, world.
- Dot.

53
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:43,668
Boys, speech train him, I'll be ri
ght back. - Okay. Okay.

54
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:45,595
Hey, pal. Repeat.

55
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:49,206
Hey, why are you staring
at me? Shall I thrash you?

56
00:08:49,776 --> 00:08:53,735
Hey, donkey, idiot. Shall I give
you a tight slap? - Yes.

57
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:56,748
Hey, answer me, you mental fool.

58
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,645
Let me see how you've trained him.

59
00:08:59,252 --> 00:09:00,947
Actually, you came too soon.

60
00:09:01,054 --> 00:09:02,146
Come on, tell me.

61
00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:04,348
Hey, pal. Repeat.

62
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:08,657
Hey, why are you staring
at me? Shall I thrash you?

63
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:13,795
Hey, donkey, idiot. Shall
I give you a tight slap?

64
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:18,398
Hey, answer me, you mental fool.

65
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:22,234
He's repeating whatever we said.
- What is all this?

66
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:23,468
Is this your speech training?

67
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:25,476
Doctor, it was not
me, but this Shiva.

68
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:28,240
I thought we would start with local
language and then go on to pure Hindi..

69
00:09:28,314 --> 00:09:31,283
Shut up. This is my hard
work of 10 long years.

70
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:32,613
This is not a joke.

71
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:34,949
If you try to teach him
wrong again, I'll punish you.

72
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:36,646
Irresponsible idiots.

73
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:41,957
You fool. You complain against us?

74
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:44,758
Idiot, I'll break you into pieces a
nd throw you in the tinker shop.

75
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:47,863
He'll get us in trouble again.
Let's go from here.

76
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:44,620
My dear Robo, welcome to this world.
- Hello, world.

77
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:48,692
I am Robo. Speed. 1 terahertz.
Memory. 1 zetabyte.

78
00:10:48,795 --> 00:10:51,787
Success, doctor. Now just the
approval from AIRD remains, doesn't it?

79
00:10:51,864 --> 00:10:55,300
No, Shiva. Even though
he has been programmed..

80
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:57,062
..with all the inputs, he is
still an innocent machine.

81
00:10:57,136 --> 00:10:58,603
Like a new born baby.

82
00:10:58,671 --> 00:11:00,298
I will socialize him
with the outside world.

83
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,367
I'll see how he uses his intellect and
abilities amongst humans..

84
00:11:04,444 --> 00:11:05,570
..living like them

85
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:08,637
Once we are sure about this,
then we'll take him to AIRD.

86
00:11:08,715 --> 00:11:10,774
That means you are going
to let him out? - Dot.

87
00:11:10,883 --> 00:11:12,350
There'll be a big chaos then.

88
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,952
Coming.

89
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:22,027
It's been months.
Don't know what's going on.

90
00:11:22,128 --> 00:11:24,858
He's spoilt his health
doing some research.

91
00:11:25,465 --> 00:11:28,434
Hi. - What's this,
Vasee? You look like a hermit.

92
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:29,559
Hi, Father.

93
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:32,263
I have a shocking surprise for you.
- What is it?

94
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:37,636
Come.
- Who's he? Is he a clone?

95
00:11:38,678 --> 00:11:42,079
No, Father.
- Hey, what's all this? Who are you?

96
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:44,013
Hi. I am Robo.

97
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:46,517
Speed 1 terahertz. Memory 1 zetabyte.

98
00:11:46,586 --> 00:11:48,019
He's beyond you as well.

99
00:11:48,821 --> 00:11:50,789
Father, I made this robot.

100
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:52,154
There are many different
types of robots. - Yes.

101
00:11:52,225 --> 00:11:53,749
This is an andro-humanoid robot.

102
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:56,226
A machine that resembles a human.

103
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:00,465
This is mother.
- Mother. - Yes. Mother. Mother.

104
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:02,261
Take mother's blessings.

105
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:06,838
He is a complete human.

106
00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:08,804
He does everything a human can.

107
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,706
But he can also do
what a human can't.

108
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,471
Then we don't need
these jokers anymore.

109
00:12:12,578 --> 00:12:14,910
Father..
- Father.. - No, Father. Let them be.

110
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:17,347
If they are not here,
who'll clean up the Robo?

111
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,883
Who'll make him wear clothes?

112
00:12:19,285 --> 00:12:22,413
You turned an MSC
science guy into a nanny?

113
00:12:22,622 --> 00:12:25,113
Vasee, dear, have your food.
- Yes.

114
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:29,185
Robot, you have a seat as well.
Have some steaming hot rice cakes.

115
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:32,123
Looks like you will feed
him a gourmet meal, too.

116
00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:35,094
Mother, all it needs is 2
units of electricity daily.

117
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:37,829
Why are you talking like that?
Haven't you given him a name?

118
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:40,236
Mother, you choose a name.

119
00:12:40,406 --> 00:12:43,034
If you had a brother, I
would've named him 'Chitti Babu'.

120
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:45,407
Sounds good. We can
lovingly call him Chitti.

121
00:12:45,478 --> 00:12:48,572
I am Chitti?
- Yes.

122
00:12:48,681 --> 00:12:50,740
Chitti. Put on the TV.

123
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,427
Oh, Mother. He would do
that if you say so, right?

124
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:03,620
You should specifically
say ''switch on the TV''.

125
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:07,865
Vasee, where are you off
to already? To the lab?

126
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,730
No, Mother. First I'll get a hai
rcut and then meet Sana.

127
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:11,736
She's very angry with me. Sit behind.

128
00:13:13,372 --> 00:13:15,101
Who'll drive the car?
- Chitti.

129
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,766
Chitti?
- Chitti? Oh, God.

130
00:13:16,843 --> 00:13:18,834
Doctor, why to take a risk?
- And you?

131
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:21,680
The thing is that I've an
upset stomach, doctor. You go.

132
00:13:21,747 --> 00:13:24,545
I haven't told my
folks at home. You leave.

133
00:13:24,984 --> 00:13:26,508
Change to driving mode.

134
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:29,950
Take care, doctor. He might break
the gear if you don't say it right.

135
00:13:30,022 --> 00:13:32,718
I'm there. - Yes. You were
there when he broke the TV.

136
00:13:33,126 --> 00:13:35,617
Slow. Slow. just
follow my instructions.

137
00:13:35,728 --> 00:13:37,195
Don't do anything without asking me.
- Okay, doctor.

138
00:13:37,263 --> 00:13:38,628
Where do we go?

139
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:49,941
Hey, Chitti.

140
00:13:51,144 --> 00:13:52,338
Idiot. Why didn't
you apply the brakes?

141
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:54,970
You said I shouldn't do
anything without asking you.

142
00:13:55,781 --> 00:13:56,941
Hey, idiot.
- New word.

143
00:13:57,016 --> 00:13:58,347
Are you driving the car
after getting full with alcohol?

144
00:13:58,417 --> 00:13:59,907
No, I'm driving the car after
getting it full with petrol. - Hey.

145
00:13:59,986 --> 00:14:01,977
Don't argue with him. just drive.

146
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:11,593
Don't cut it too short. just inch.

147
00:14:11,697 --> 00:14:13,995
Will cut your hair
just as I cut your nails.

148
00:14:14,934 --> 00:14:17,835
Sir, you didn't come for long time.
Had you made a wish to Ayyappa?

149
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:19,734
No, Brother.
- Is he your brother?

150
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:20,863
Yes, kind of.

151
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:23,999
Sir, would you like to have a hai
rcut? - No. This is a wig.

152
00:14:24,577 --> 00:14:27,944
Wig? How old must sir be?
- One day.

153
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:31,245
Sir's joking.

154
00:14:31,651 --> 00:14:33,448
Here, read some books.

155
00:14:38,357 --> 00:14:40,188
Is he counting the pages?

156
00:14:49,602 --> 00:14:50,967
Are there other books?

157
00:14:52,838 --> 00:14:55,102
You finished reading all of
them so soon? - Yes, I did.

158
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:58,002
We only have the
telephone directory to read now.

159
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:10,083
Next. - You read the
directory as well? - Yes.

160
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:12,056
You memorized all the
numbers in the directory? - Yes.

161
00:15:12,124 --> 00:15:14,888
Tell me Kamal Hassan's number.
- 24334140.

162
00:15:16,162 --> 00:15:19,097
Everyone knows that.
Tell me my number.

163
00:15:19,165 --> 00:15:20,928
Your name?
- Bhajanlal.

164
00:15:26,038 --> 00:15:27,869
There are 12 Bhajanlals' here.
What are your initials?

165
00:15:27,974 --> 00:15:29,032
K. Bhajanlal.

166
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:32,105
There are 3 K. Bhajanlals
here. What is your address?

167
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:37,911
No. 6, Manna Reddy Street. Chennai.
- 24884030.

168
00:15:37,984 --> 00:15:39,713
Correct. Brilliant.

169
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:44,755
My number. 44433 Guess my name.

170
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,115
Hello, Mr. P. Pitambaram.

171
00:15:59,772 --> 00:16:01,399
Hi, sweetheart.
- Broken heart.

172
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:03,601
What is it?
- I am sorry, Sana.

173
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:05,533
Please accept my apologies.

174
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:07,476
I was busy in the
lab for so many days.

175
00:16:07,546 --> 00:16:09,946
You should've stayed there.
Why did you come here?

176
00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:12,446
I know.. you are very angry, right?

177
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:15,248
How many times I called you? I
lost count of e-mails, SMSs.

178
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:19,348
I dropped in so many times.
You didn't even talk to me.

179
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:20,783
I am tired of all this now.

180
00:16:20,893 --> 00:16:22,758
Sana, look at this. Bullet points.

181
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:26,195
One. I have no clue what's
happening when I am at work.

182
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:29,268
Second. If you knew what I was
doing all these days.. - Excuse me.

183
00:16:29,368 --> 00:16:30,426
The class is going on.

184
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:32,265
Say whatever you want to say
in the evening at jeeva park.

185
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:34,236
Dot. I love you. See
you in the evening.

186
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:39,210
Hello, don't get any ideas. Not to
romance, but to call off our love.

187
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:40,939
What? Call off our love?
What do you mean?

188
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:43,106
If you are to keep hugging
your machines and me my..

189
00:16:43,182 --> 00:16:45,582
..solitude, then there's no point
in calling off our marriage later.

190
00:16:45,685 --> 00:16:47,380
So, we might as well call
off our love now itself.

191
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:49,010
I'll go my way. You go your way.

192
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:51,021
End of the fight.
- Hey, look.

193
00:16:51,123 --> 00:16:55,219
Easy. Easy, Sana. Oh, no.

194
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,837
Here's the break-up agreement.

195
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:11,569
All the letters sent
by you, greeting cards..

196
00:17:11,644 --> 00:17:13,202
Look what book you had given me?

197
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,840
''A briefer history of time''.
''Freakeconomics''.

198
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,880
Lord Murugan's photo
on Valentine's day.

199
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:22,713
Have you ever given a gift
that has touched my heart?

200
00:17:25,858 --> 00:17:28,952
This. Does anyone give a
razor as a gift to a girl?

201
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:31,895
Thought it would be useful to you.
- What nonsense.

202
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:41,368
I have returned everything
you gave me. Sign on this now.

203
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,840
Our relationship is over. Goodbye.

204
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:45,103
That's all?
- End of it.

205
00:17:45,211 --> 00:17:47,338
Have you returned
everything I gave you? - Yes, I did.

206
00:17:47,446 --> 00:17:51,177
What about my 2 to the
power of.. 512 kisses?

207
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,541
You keep counting kisses, too?

208
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:54,916
Don't you have any feelings?

209
00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:58,090
Complete matrix head. I
can't return all that.

210
00:17:58,157 --> 00:17:59,385
Then this love won't be called off.

211
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:01,084
Forget it. I won't give it.

212
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,526
Then even I will not sign
it. Call-off is called-off.

213
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:05,788
What have I gotten myself into?

214
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,928
Close your eyes.

215
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,566
Count.

216
00:18:15,741 --> 00:18:16,969
What's this?

217
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:19,010
These are all post office kisses.
Did I kiss you like this?

218
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:22,878
Then? - Pulled you by the
waist. Hugged you tight.

219
00:18:22,948 --> 00:18:26,111
Stop. Stop. This is impossible.

220
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:27,545
You won't get it.

221
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:31,145
Then I won't call it off.
I'll trouble you daily.

222
00:18:31,257 --> 00:18:35,557
You are torturing me. Idiot.

223
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:40,164
Come close. Close your eyes.

224
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,227
Don't chuckle.

225
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:51,242
Is this okay?
- Too much gap.

226
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:54,476
Hold tighter.

227
00:18:55,247 --> 00:18:57,044
Feel. Feel.

228
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:38,620
What is this?
- 'Bhel' (Indian snack).

229
00:24:38,724 --> 00:24:39,748
'Bhel'?
- Yes.

230
00:24:39,825 --> 00:24:42,726
Who is the driver?
- Which driver?

231
00:24:42,795 --> 00:24:44,160
There are different kinds of drivers.

232
00:24:44,229 --> 00:24:45,992
Engine driver, taxi
driver, screwdriver..

233
00:24:46,064 --> 00:24:48,658
Who is the driver of this car?
- I am.

234
00:24:49,034 --> 00:24:50,968
You've parked your car
in the no parking zone.

235
00:24:51,036 --> 00:24:52,435
It's only written ''No parking'' there.

236
00:24:52,504 --> 00:24:54,870
It doesn't say ''No parking
for Dr. Vaseegaran's car''.

237
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,272
Are you trying to act smart?
- No, I am replying.

238
00:24:57,342 --> 00:25:00,937
Show me your driving license.
- I don't have one.

239
00:25:01,046 --> 00:25:02,604
How can you drive without a license?

240
00:25:02,681 --> 00:25:04,012
The driving module has
been programmed in me.

241
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:06,016
Okay. Don't act too smart.
Come with me to the station.

242
00:25:06,084 --> 00:25:08,314
Which station? Radio station,
railway station, space station..

243
00:25:08,387 --> 00:25:09,479
..or play station?

244
00:25:09,555 --> 00:25:12,251
Trying to fool me? What's your name?
- Chitti.

245
00:25:12,491 --> 00:25:14,322
What's your address?
- Here's the I. P address.

246
00:25:14,393 --> 00:25:16,156
108.11.0.1.

247
00:25:16,228 --> 00:25:18,696
Why do you answer all
questions is such a weird manner?

248
00:25:18,764 --> 00:25:20,231
What's your father's name?
- I have no father.

249
00:25:20,332 --> 00:25:21,629
Mother?
- No mother.

250
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:23,223
Are you an orphan?
- I'm not an orphan.

251
00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:26,463
Then how were you born?
- I wasn't born, but made.

252
00:25:26,872 --> 00:25:30,638
Made? Are you insane?
- No.

253
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,073
I have been fitted well.
- Are you in your senses?

254
00:25:33,178 --> 00:25:35,169
No, it is in nickel. All
my bolts are made of nickel.

255
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,942
Stop it.
- Stop what? Tell me properly.

256
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,176
You..

257
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:48,025
I argued unnecessarily.
Parking offence. No driving license.

258
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,918
You talk too much.

259
00:25:49,995 --> 00:25:52,589
If you go to the court,
you will be fined Rs. 1000.

260
00:25:53,866 --> 00:25:55,629
Want to go to court or
take care of it here itself?

261
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:57,999
I will take care of it here itself.
- That's the spirit.

262
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:03,264
Go on.
- Done.

263
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,673
Hey, are you out of your mind?

264
00:26:05,777 --> 00:26:07,677
Don't you know what
'taking care of it' means?

265
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,471
Give me a cut.
- Where?

266
00:26:12,618 --> 00:26:14,586
Give it in my hand.

267
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:22,783
He cut my hand. He
cut it. Police. Police.

268
00:26:22,895 --> 00:26:24,157
Chitti. What happened?
- Police.

269
00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:25,696
He asked for a cut. So I obliged.

270
00:26:25,764 --> 00:26:28,028
Oh, my God. He's bleeding.
- Vasee, who's this?

271
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:29,998
He looks just like you.
- Get into the car. I'll tell you.

272
00:26:30,068 --> 00:26:33,333
Hey, get the car. - Hey,
where are you going? Stop. Stop.

273
00:26:33,405 --> 00:26:35,202
Is he your brother? Are you twins?

274
00:26:35,274 --> 00:26:38,209
No. If we get caught, we
will be in a mess. Drive fast.

275
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,207
Is he your friend?
- No.

276
00:26:40,312 --> 00:26:42,644
Driver? He doesn't look like a one.

277
00:26:42,714 --> 00:26:44,375
Wait.. I'll explain everything.

278
00:26:44,483 --> 00:26:46,849
Hey, look back if he's
following us and drive.

279
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,524
Hey, look in the front.

280
00:26:53,592 --> 00:26:55,150
Why do you turn your
head at the drop of a hat?

281
00:26:55,227 --> 00:26:56,751
You asked me to look back and drive.

282
00:26:56,828 --> 00:26:58,159
Can't you look at
the rear view mirror?

283
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,597
You couldn't have told me
that earlier? - Come on.

284
00:27:48,246 --> 00:27:50,908
Gentlemen, he is equal to 100.

285
00:27:51,483 --> 00:27:54,611
He has been programmed with the
memory and skills of 100 humans.

286
00:27:54,953 --> 00:27:58,787
He knows all the arts
and languages of the world.

287
00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:03,958
He can dance. He can fight.
And he's a sportsman.

288
00:28:04,062 --> 00:28:07,896
He's fire resistant, water
resistant, in-built vehicle.

289
00:28:07,966 --> 00:28:11,367
His eyes don't just
see, but also show.

290
00:28:17,175 --> 00:28:18,802
You can talk to him virtually.

291
00:28:18,877 --> 00:28:23,541
This type of robot can develop
and protect our nation 100 fold.

292
00:28:23,648 --> 00:28:26,139
You are welcome to ask
Chitti any question.

293
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:32,281
Simple question. 24157817 is
it a Fibonacci number? - Yes.

294
00:28:32,357 --> 00:28:34,018
It is the 22nd Fibonacci number.

295
00:28:34,126 --> 00:28:36,526
By the way, it also happens to be
Mr. P. Subramaniam's residential..

296
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:38,187
..number in Pondicherry.

297
00:28:39,498 --> 00:28:42,524
What is the biggest
prime number in your opinion?

298
00:28:47,172 --> 00:28:51,108
M44. You will have to wait
for many years to verify this.

299
00:28:51,643 --> 00:28:52,803
Good.

300
00:28:52,878 --> 00:28:54,971
Amazing. Great.

301
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:04,247
What raga is this?

302
00:29:04,423 --> 00:29:06,516
You started with 'Nat Kurinji'
and went off to 'Husseini'..

303
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:07,717
..in between. Listen to this.

304
00:29:12,197 --> 00:29:14,028
You missed the note at this place.

305
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:20,670
Any more questions?
- Does God exist or not?

306
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:23,172
What is God?
- The one who created us.

307
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:26,472
My creator exists. Dr.
Vaseegaran. So God exists.

308
00:29:45,897 --> 00:29:48,229
What else?
- Wow, Vasee.

309
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,759
He's superb. What a lovely creation.
- Thank you.

310
00:29:52,838 --> 00:29:54,465
You are really great.

311
00:29:54,573 --> 00:29:57,303
Hey, Chitti. Do you know to paint?
- Yes, I do.

312
00:29:57,409 --> 00:29:59,036
Will you paint me?
- Sure.

313
00:29:59,244 --> 00:30:00,643
Smile, please.

314
00:30:12,157 --> 00:30:14,216
Cool.
- Wow..

315
00:30:14,326 --> 00:30:15,987
He's such a darling.

316
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:18,061
Can we click a photograph?
- Sure.

317
00:30:20,065 --> 00:30:21,999
Yes. Yes.
- Wow.

318
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:24,464
Look, the girls are all over him.

319
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:29,238
Hey, girls. I am co-scientist.

320
00:30:29,307 --> 00:30:31,468
I fixed all of Chitti's motors.

321
00:30:31,543 --> 00:30:34,034
Hi. I am deputy scientist. Ravi.
- Deputy scientist?

322
00:30:34,112 --> 00:30:35,875
Yes, that means he's still learning.
- Hey.

323
00:30:35,947 --> 00:30:39,178
I dressed him up.
- Can I have a date with you?

324
00:30:39,284 --> 00:30:42,117
Dating? Why are you
all falling for him?

325
00:30:42,187 --> 00:30:43,984
He may have the
strength of 100 people..

326
00:30:44,055 --> 00:30:48,890
..but we have something
that he doesn't. He doesn't.

327
00:30:49,294 --> 00:30:54,027
Doctor, why don't I have
that special thing they do?

328
00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:55,794
Robo is called Chitti Babu..

329
00:30:55,867 --> 00:30:58,062
Fools. Don't you know how
to talk in front of him?

330
00:30:58,136 --> 00:31:00,502
Actually we have
feelings and he doesn't.

331
00:31:00,605 --> 00:31:02,004
Cheap fellows, don't
try to change the topic.

332
00:31:02,073 --> 00:31:03,438
You lose one month's salary.

333
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,080
Hello, Professor.
- Brilliant job, Dr. Vasee.

334
00:31:10,148 --> 00:31:12,343
Thank you. Chitti,
meet professor Bora.

335
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:15,476
You have told me.
Chief of AIRD. Your mentor.

336
00:31:15,554 --> 00:31:17,078
His picture hangs on our lab wall.

337
00:31:17,155 --> 00:31:19,988
Interesting. Chitti.

338
00:31:21,626 --> 00:31:23,184
What processor are you using?

339
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:25,422
Pentium ultracore millennia V2.

340
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:29,261
And your motors?
- FHP450S motors.

341
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:32,859
From Hirata, japan. With
harmonic reduction unit.

342
00:31:33,572 --> 00:31:36,132
Can you tell me
about your neural schema?

343
00:31:36,241 --> 00:31:37,731
I can't.
- Why?

344
00:31:37,842 --> 00:31:39,139
It is highly confidential.

345
00:31:39,244 --> 00:31:41,178
I am Vaseegaran's professor.

346
00:31:41,913 --> 00:31:44,473
You can tell me without hesitation.
- I'll have to check.

347
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:47,712
No. - He is asking me
about my neural scheme.

348
00:31:47,786 --> 00:31:48,912
Shall I tell him?

349
00:31:49,788 --> 00:31:52,757
You see, professor.
You are asking know-how.

350
00:31:52,857 --> 00:31:56,054
I'm hesitating to divulge
information till he is patented.

351
00:31:56,561 --> 00:32:00,622
He can be easily misused.
- Of course, I understand.

352
00:32:00,932 --> 00:32:05,266
I had just casually asked to see
how much Chitti knows about himself.

353
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,997
I hope you don't mind.
- Not at all.

354
00:32:07,072 --> 00:32:09,666
After studying him thoroughly,
I will bring him to you..

355
00:32:09,774 --> 00:32:12,766
..for AIRD evaluation.
- All the best. - Thank you.

356
00:32:12,844 --> 00:32:14,471
I'll see you there, my boy.

357
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,011
Vasee, I like Chitti a lot.

358
00:32:25,123 --> 00:32:27,216
Can I take him home for 2-3 days?

359
00:32:27,325 --> 00:32:30,556
Hey, he's not a Pomeranian
or your teddy to play with.

360
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:34,258
No, Vasee. I have my final exams.
I haven't prepared well..

361
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:35,833
..as I was upset with you.

362
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,835
Chitti being around could
help me. Please. Please.

363
00:32:38,903 --> 00:32:41,064
Please. Please.
- Alright. Take him along.

364
00:32:41,139 --> 00:32:43,198
You both go along with him as well.
- Okay, doctor. - Okay, doctor.

365
00:32:43,275 --> 00:32:44,902
Gents are not allowed at home.

366
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,102
Who said we are gents?

367
00:32:46,211 --> 00:32:50,477
Okay. Call me if you need anything.
- Okay. Thanks.

368
00:33:01,926 --> 00:33:04,622
Activate command mode and a stand up.

369
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,425
Command mode activated.

370
00:33:09,134 --> 00:33:15,869
Walk. Idiot. Come forward.
Not on the side, but straight.

371
00:33:16,574 --> 00:33:19,634
Shit.
- I can't shit.

372
00:33:23,381 --> 00:33:24,973
Okay, pick up the gun.

373
00:33:28,219 --> 00:33:30,346
Not the bun. The gun. Gun.

374
00:33:33,425 --> 00:33:34,858
Shoot.

375
00:33:39,064 --> 00:33:42,090
Hey. Hey. Stop it.

376
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:45,468
I have programmed 8
lakh line of codes in you.

377
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:47,896
You mistake a gun for a bun.

378
00:33:48,206 --> 00:33:50,674
If I tell you to massage my head,
you'll strangle my neck.

379
00:33:57,282 --> 00:34:00,342
My student Vaseegaran
turned out to be stupendous.

380
00:34:00,552 --> 00:34:05,114
He got a standing ovation for
his robot in the conference.

381
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,620
And this nonsensical
metal head is still..

382
00:34:08,827 --> 00:34:10,920
Strangle the neck. Strangle the neck.

383
00:34:10,995 --> 00:34:13,987
Let go off me. Let go.
- Task incomplete.

384
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:16,759
Strangle the neck. Strangle the neck.

385
00:34:16,835 --> 00:34:20,271
Strangle the neck.
Strangle the neck. Neck..

386
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,579
Oh, no.

387
00:34:40,558 --> 00:34:44,016
Alright Vaseegaran, I'll surpass you.

388
00:34:44,596 --> 00:34:46,587
You just wait.

389
00:34:47,465 --> 00:34:49,262
''Happy home''. Meaning?

390
00:34:49,634 --> 00:34:52,694
Papa was in the army. He was
martyred in the Kargil war.

391
00:34:52,871 --> 00:34:55,840
After that, grief, tears
and depression at home.

392
00:34:55,907 --> 00:34:57,101
It was horrible.

393
00:34:57,342 --> 00:34:59,902
Then we thought, how
long will this go on?

394
00:35:00,011 --> 00:35:03,003
Thought all the women who are
homeless after losing their..

395
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:06,710
..husbands and sons in the army
should live in a family environment.

396
00:35:06,818 --> 00:35:09,446
Nobody can change what has happened.

397
00:35:09,521 --> 00:35:12,081
And no one can prevent
what is about to happen.

398
00:35:12,157 --> 00:35:14,216
But what's the harm in
living a happy life today?

399
00:35:14,325 --> 00:35:15,758
So, this Happy Home.

400
00:35:16,094 --> 00:35:19,222
Latha, is your baby playing footbal
l inside? - Naughty.

401
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,821
Wait till he comes out.
I'll teach him a good lesson.

402
00:35:25,804 --> 00:35:28,432
Who's he? What will a
man do in our house?

403
00:35:28,506 --> 00:35:29,564
Is he your boyfriend?

404
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:32,007
Mother, not boy friend,
but toy friend.

405
00:35:32,076 --> 00:35:34,442
His name is Chitti. He's a Robot.

406
00:35:34,512 --> 00:35:37,140
Robot? Why are you lying
to me? You are too much..

407
00:35:37,248 --> 00:35:39,375
It's true. I am a robot.

408
00:35:39,484 --> 00:35:41,918
Speed. 1 terahertz.
Memory. 1 zetabyte.

409
00:35:43,121 --> 00:35:45,954
Chitti, don't give them a
fright like this. Put it back.

410
00:35:48,626 --> 00:35:51,356
Mother, you will be
shocked by all that he does.

411
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:52,987
Can he cook?
- Of course.

412
00:35:53,064 --> 00:35:55,624
Cook something for me,
Chitti. I'll take a shower.

413
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:17,046
You neatened the whole room.

414
00:36:17,956 --> 00:36:21,119
You are so sweet, Chitti. Thank you.

415
00:36:24,395 --> 00:36:26,727
Cool.
- It's hot.

416
00:36:29,734 --> 00:36:32,464
just one day left. Lots to study.

417
00:36:32,637 --> 00:36:34,901
I'll tell you what I know verbatim.

418
00:36:35,206 --> 00:36:37,401
Correct me if I go wrong, okay?

419
00:36:47,752 --> 00:36:48,878
Finished reading everything?

420
00:36:51,356 --> 00:36:55,850
Okay, let me test you. What are
monopsychotic and dipsychotic twins?

421
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,985
Monopsychotic twins
are identical twins.

422
00:36:58,062 --> 00:37:00,292
Dipsychotic twins are
non-identical twins.

423
00:37:01,132 --> 00:37:02,531
Amazing.

424
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:05,997
If you learn at this pace, you
will become a doctor in a day.

425
00:37:06,204 --> 00:37:09,640
In the important
segment of the pelvis..

426
00:37:09,741 --> 00:37:12,005
The trans..
- Tenciamomo?

427
00:37:12,377 --> 00:37:14,811
Tenciamomo is usually the
smallest diameter of the pelvis..

428
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:16,107
Anteroposterior diameter.

429
00:37:16,214 --> 00:37:20,014
The Anteroposterior diameter,
which is through the level of the..

430
00:37:31,529 --> 00:37:33,190
They do this everyday.

431
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:39,069
Hello. Such loud music.
Turn the volume down.

432
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:40,899
Hello.

433
00:37:41,005 --> 00:37:43,872
We've spent a million and
bought a deck, amplifier..

434
00:37:43,975 --> 00:37:46,307
..woofer, surround speaker.

435
00:37:46,578 --> 00:37:48,478
Do you expect us to
hear it on headphones..

436
00:37:48,546 --> 00:37:50,138
..if not on full volume?

437
00:37:50,248 --> 00:37:52,580
It's exam time. So
many girls are studying.

438
00:37:52,684 --> 00:37:54,174
And there are heart patients as well.

439
00:37:54,886 --> 00:37:56,319
Heart patients.

440
00:37:56,387 --> 00:37:59,413
Is there pain in your heart?
Stuff in some cotton.

441
00:37:59,724 --> 00:38:03,717
I said in the ear. Okay.

442
00:38:10,602 --> 00:38:12,194
Chitti, do something.

443
00:38:12,303 --> 00:38:14,362
Don't worry. The
remote control has infrared.

444
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:15,633
I'll handle it.

445
00:38:36,494 --> 00:38:38,325
Come on, baby. Come on.

446
00:38:39,364 --> 00:38:40,991
Finish it off.
- Shut your ears.

447
00:38:41,065 --> 00:38:43,431
Come on.
- Okay.

448
00:38:44,602 --> 00:38:46,866
Let's move it. Let's move it.

449
00:38:52,276 --> 00:38:54,073
Turn down the volume, buddy.

450
00:38:55,513 --> 00:38:57,310
It's too loud, man.

451
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:13,388
Cool. Come, Chitti.

452
00:39:18,503 --> 00:39:19,993
Back to studies. Okay?

453
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:23,202
The Anteroposterior diameter
through the level of the..

454
00:39:23,274 --> 00:39:25,606
..spine which normally
measures up to about 11..

455
00:39:32,684 --> 00:39:34,652
98 decibels. Too loud.

456
00:39:35,453 --> 00:39:37,114
I can't bear this.

457
00:39:42,794 --> 00:39:44,955
Listen. It's too loud.

458
00:39:45,029 --> 00:39:46,223
Turn it down by 30 db.

459
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,595
Buzz off. It's a feast for
mother Goddess. We are celebrating.

460
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:51,328
He says it's too loud.
The db is high.

461
00:39:51,402 --> 00:39:53,427
I'm having exams. I'm
finding it difficult to study.

462
00:39:53,538 --> 00:39:57,030
Offer your prayers to the Goddess
and smear the holy ash. You'll pass.

463
00:39:58,376 --> 00:40:00,867
Your parties are so loud as well.

464
00:40:03,514 --> 00:40:05,505
Sana, the problem of the
loudspeaker is now taken care of.

465
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:06,675
Thanks.

466
00:40:06,751 --> 00:40:08,309
Hey, Shekhar. He broke
the mike. That scoundrel.

467
00:40:08,386 --> 00:40:10,354
Hey. Wait up. I won't spare him.

468
00:40:10,421 --> 00:40:11,615
Come on.

469
00:40:11,723 --> 00:40:13,156
I said stop.

470
00:40:32,076 --> 00:40:34,476
Mother. Mother Goddess.

471
00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:37,909
Mother. Mother Goddess.

472
00:40:37,982 --> 00:40:41,577
Mother. Mother Goddess.

473
00:40:46,157 --> 00:40:47,215
Mother Goddess.

474
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:48,690
What is this?

475
00:40:48,793 --> 00:40:50,283
I guess he knows magic.

476
00:40:50,394 --> 00:40:51,691
Hey, he drew in all the things.

477
00:40:51,796 --> 00:40:53,491
What's going on?
- What is this?

478
00:41:19,023 --> 00:41:24,427
Oh, God.
- Why are you crying, Sana?

479
00:41:24,729 --> 00:41:26,390
I'm going to fail, Chitti.

480
00:41:26,464 --> 00:41:28,796
I haven't studied anything.
I have run out of time.

481
00:41:28,866 --> 00:41:30,299
My head starts
spinning when I see the books.

482
00:41:30,401 --> 00:41:31,629
Can I appear for the exams?

483
00:41:31,702 --> 00:41:33,431
What nonsense, Chitti?

484
00:41:33,504 --> 00:41:35,529
You need a photo ID,
exam card and everything.

485
00:41:35,873 --> 00:41:36,897
You'll be caught if you go.

486
00:41:37,008 --> 00:41:38,441
Then we'll do Zigbee.

487
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:40,570
What do you mean?

488
00:41:40,678 --> 00:41:43,078
If the bleeding starts
with the placenta and utero..

489
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:45,943
..the fundus of uterus
must be grasped and massaged..

490
00:41:46,017 --> 00:41:47,177
..to make it contract.

491
00:41:47,418 --> 00:41:49,511
If the placenta shows
sign of separation..

492
00:41:49,587 --> 00:41:53,353
..it must be expressed
by the commonly employed..

493
00:41:53,691 --> 00:41:55,750
If the placenta is not separated..

494
00:41:55,827 --> 00:41:58,159
..no attempt should
be made to express it.

495
00:41:59,096 --> 00:42:01,462
The third stage of labor
starts after the baby's delivery.

496
00:42:01,566 --> 00:42:03,932
And ends..
- Excuse me. What are you doing here?

497
00:42:04,468 --> 00:42:05,958
Sana is appearing for
her exam over there.

498
00:42:06,037 --> 00:42:07,868
And I'm telling her the answers.

499
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,966
How come by sitting here?

500
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:11,906
I've built-in data transmitter.

501
00:42:12,009 --> 00:42:14,341
There is a trans-receiver
attached to Sana's ears.

502
00:42:14,445 --> 00:42:16,310
Zigbee protocol. Simple.

503
00:42:16,581 --> 00:42:17,775
What high tech bit is this?

504
00:42:17,882 --> 00:42:19,372
It's not a bit, but byte.

505
00:42:19,483 --> 00:42:21,178
I've sent 2 megabyte data so far.

506
00:42:21,285 --> 00:42:23,719
Did you see, sir? How
they conjure up things?

507
00:42:23,788 --> 00:42:25,983
Get up, man.
- Wait for a while.

508
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:27,421
I'll be there the moment the
umbilical cord is severed.

509
00:42:27,525 --> 00:42:30,722
What? Are you coming with us or you
want me to call the security?

510
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:39,093
There. She is Sana.

511
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:40,532
Sana, what is this?

512
00:42:40,805 --> 00:42:42,204
You're copying his
answers via a trans-receiver..

513
00:42:42,273 --> 00:42:44,002
..attached to your ears?

514
00:42:44,075 --> 00:42:45,406
Who told you?
- I did.

515
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:46,875
Who is he? I don't know him.

516
00:42:46,944 --> 00:42:48,935
Sana, why are you lying? I'm Chitti.

517
00:42:49,013 --> 00:42:51,413
Speed 1 terahertz. Memory 1 Zetabyte.

518
00:42:51,515 --> 00:42:53,745
What the.. It's
absolute nonsense, sir.

519
00:42:53,818 --> 00:42:54,910
He has lost his marbles.

520
00:42:54,986 --> 00:42:57,352
I don't have a mind, but
a CPU. Perfect condition.

521
00:42:57,421 --> 00:42:59,116
There is no doubt that he is crazy.

522
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:00,384
Take him away. My
time's getting wasted.

523
00:43:00,491 --> 00:43:02,288
When he was muttering away alone..

524
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,952
..I thought he must be
some ex-medical student.

525
00:43:04,028 --> 00:43:05,757
Sir, you may go out.

526
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:07,127
Go and severe the umbilical cord.

527
00:43:07,198 --> 00:43:09,166
Sana, then what will you
about the fertilization process?

528
00:43:09,233 --> 00:43:11,258
Go out. That's her problem.

529
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:12,859
Task incomplete.

530
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:52,005
Thank you very much.

531
00:43:52,076 --> 00:43:54,704
I would've failed if
you hadn't helped me.

532
00:43:54,779 --> 00:43:56,747
Why are you wetting
my cheek for that?

533
00:43:58,282 --> 00:43:59,340
Let's go.

534
00:44:00,584 --> 00:44:01,949
I'm sorry, Chitti.

535
00:44:02,053 --> 00:44:04,715
They would've debarred me
for 3 years had I been caught.

536
00:44:04,855 --> 00:44:07,323
That's why I had to
put on this entire act.

537
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:10,090
Don't feel bad.
- I have no feelings.

538
00:44:10,161 --> 00:44:15,656
I have learned that a human
can lie in his defence. - True.

539
00:44:17,568 --> 00:44:19,058
Move.

540
00:44:20,204 --> 00:44:23,002
Move, smarty.
- Come on, make way.

541
00:44:23,074 --> 00:44:24,598
Make way.
- Hey. Let me get in. Hey.

542
00:44:24,675 --> 00:44:25,972
You, get out.
- Come on.

543
00:44:26,043 --> 00:44:28,034
Come on, out.
- Take a hike. Take a hike.

544
00:44:29,313 --> 00:44:31,781
Hey, are you some big-shot?

545
00:44:31,983 --> 00:44:35,475
Now tell us. - Hey, what
are you staring at?

546
00:44:35,553 --> 00:44:36,611
Now you can't draw in anything.

547
00:44:36,721 --> 00:44:38,746
Everything's made of wood and stone.

548
00:44:38,823 --> 00:44:41,018
Come on.
- Why are they calling me?

549
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:42,251
Quiet.

550
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,555
Hey, you had
brought him along, right?

551
00:44:44,628 --> 00:44:45,754
Now ask him to come.

552
00:44:49,867 --> 00:44:51,698
Chitti, my purse.

553
00:44:51,802 --> 00:44:53,929
It has the hall ticket,
ID.. Everything.

554
00:45:20,197 --> 00:45:22,188
You broke my home theatre.

555
00:45:22,266 --> 00:45:25,633
Now let me see how much
noise your home theatre makes.

556
00:45:31,509 --> 00:45:32,635
Chitti.

557
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,942
Chitti.

558
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:49,653
Chitti.
- Come on, get in.

559
00:45:49,994 --> 00:45:51,621
Chitti. Chitti, train.

560
00:46:10,281 --> 00:46:12,875
Chitti, give them a thrashing.

561
00:46:52,189 --> 00:46:53,383
Chitti.

562
00:47:23,921 --> 00:47:25,388
Stop it.

563
00:47:37,234 --> 00:47:38,428
Chitti.

564
00:48:33,123 --> 00:48:34,681
Chitti.

565
00:50:01,779 --> 00:50:05,044
You'll go crazy when you
hear what Chitti did today.

566
00:50:05,449 --> 00:50:08,907
He is so sweet. He's amazing.
Unbelievable.

567
00:50:08,986 --> 00:50:10,954
Like.. Like a super hero.

568
00:50:11,322 --> 00:50:15,190
If he was a human, trust me,
he'll be the best man.

569
00:50:17,194 --> 00:50:20,459
Why do you look irked?
- Not at all.

570
00:50:21,565 --> 00:50:23,556
Hey. Come on, Vasee.

571
00:50:23,634 --> 00:50:25,067
He's just a machine.

572
00:50:25,235 --> 00:50:28,261
And the entire credit of
whatever he does goes to you.

573
00:50:28,872 --> 00:50:30,430
You created him.

574
00:50:30,607 --> 00:50:32,472
And I love you for that.

575
00:53:21,712 --> 00:53:24,272
Hello. My son will fly in the air.

576
00:53:24,348 --> 00:53:25,713
Hold him.

577
00:53:35,058 --> 00:53:36,423
Are you insane?

578
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:37,820
What are you doing? Hey, leave me.

579
00:53:37,928 --> 00:53:39,122
Put me down.

580
00:53:39,596 --> 00:53:40,995
Task completed.

581
00:54:54,938 --> 00:54:56,132
Cheers.
- Cheers.

582
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:02,205
What is it? You are checking
us out as if you are watching..

583
00:55:02,279 --> 00:55:04,679
..some girl dancing.

584
00:55:05,148 --> 00:55:06,615
Do you intend to complain about us?

585
00:55:06,683 --> 00:55:08,116
It's the AIRD evaluation tomorrow.

586
00:55:08,185 --> 00:55:09,550
I'm carrying out
peripheral trouble shooting.

587
00:55:09,653 --> 00:55:11,848
Hey, are you some scholar?

588
00:55:11,922 --> 00:55:13,389
Your language is wrong.

589
00:55:13,557 --> 00:55:15,388
As if you are some linguist?

590
00:55:21,765 --> 00:55:22,925
Hey, stop it.

591
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,934
You're ranting away preaches..

592
00:55:25,002 --> 00:55:26,993
..without a break like a
sage on some devotional channel.

593
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:29,630
You think you're bigger than us
now that you know a few things?

594
00:55:29,706 --> 00:55:31,606
Yes.
- What yes?

595
00:55:31,675 --> 00:55:32,767
Can you drink like us?

596
00:55:32,843 --> 00:55:34,435
Can you puff cigarettes like us?

597
00:55:34,511 --> 00:55:35,842
Can you eat 'Biryani' (Indian Pilaf)?

598
00:55:35,912 --> 00:55:37,243
Can you eat and puke?

599
00:55:37,314 --> 00:55:38,941
Can you spit like us?

600
00:55:39,049 --> 00:55:41,108
Can you write names on
the wall with your urine?

601
00:55:41,184 --> 00:55:43,414
Is this the only
difference between me and humans?

602
00:55:45,222 --> 00:55:47,782
He's putting us down.
- Shall we feed him some 'Biryani'?

603
00:55:47,858 --> 00:55:49,826
I can't eat all this.
It's in my rule list.

604
00:55:49,926 --> 00:55:52,053
Hey, isn't it mentioned in
the rule list that..

605
00:55:52,162 --> 00:55:53,220
..you should listen to us? - Yes.

606
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:55,628
Then here. Have some liquor.
- Have some 'Biryani'.

607
00:55:55,699 --> 00:55:56,893
Wait. Let me ask the doctor.

608
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,695
Hey, why the doctor?
- Hey, why the doctor?

609
00:55:58,802 --> 00:56:00,064
Hello, doctor.

610
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:02,434
These guys are feeding me alcohol,
beverages and 'Biryani'.

611
00:56:02,539 --> 00:56:04,473
Rule priority clash.
What should I do?

612
00:56:04,574 --> 00:56:05,871
Thrash those rascals with slippers.

613
00:56:05,976 --> 00:56:07,307
Yes, doctor. Command received.

614
00:56:07,411 --> 00:56:08,537
Listen.

615
00:56:10,547 --> 00:56:11,707
Give me your slippers.

616
00:56:11,882 --> 00:56:13,247
Slippers?
- Slippers?

617
00:56:13,316 --> 00:56:14,578
Here you go.
- Here you go.

618
00:56:15,552 --> 00:56:17,042
Are you going to eat this?

619
00:56:20,691 --> 00:56:22,283
Chitti, why are you beating us up?

620
00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:24,224
We haven't anything done
of that sort. Don't do it.

621
00:56:24,327 --> 00:56:26,488
Look, it hurts.
- Don't beat us up.

622
00:56:26,563 --> 00:56:28,428
You're beating us up
with our slippers.

623
00:56:28,532 --> 00:56:29,965
Please spare us.
- Please.

624
00:56:30,033 --> 00:56:31,125
Task incomplete.

625
00:56:31,201 --> 00:56:32,463
It hurts.
- Don't beat us up.

626
00:56:32,569 --> 00:56:34,469
Doctor, help us.
- Help us.

627
00:56:34,571 --> 00:56:36,835
Chitti is beating us up. Help.

628
00:56:36,907 --> 00:56:39,671
Chitti, stop. You deserve this.
- No, sir.

629
00:56:39,776 --> 00:56:41,869
Don't you have brains?
- No, sir.

630
00:56:41,945 --> 00:56:43,105
It's AIRD evaluation tomorrow..

631
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,114
..and you're asking him to
have drinks and 'Biryani'?

632
00:56:45,382 --> 00:56:46,644
We did not tell him
anything of that sort, doctor.

633
00:56:46,717 --> 00:56:47,775
He is lying, doctor.
- Shut up.

634
00:56:47,884 --> 00:56:49,875
Only humans lie, not machines.

635
00:56:49,953 --> 00:56:52,547
Last warning, idiots. Next
time you'll be fired. Literally.

636
00:56:53,724 --> 00:56:54,918
Task completed.

637
00:57:05,168 --> 00:57:07,136
A human's life is precious.

638
00:57:07,471 --> 00:57:10,531
Millions of our brave
soldiers lose their lives every war.

639
00:57:10,741 --> 00:57:12,675
Many families get
orphaned after losing them.

640
00:57:12,976 --> 00:57:14,238
There will be no
human casualties if..

641
00:57:14,311 --> 00:57:16,905
..we use robots instead
of soldiers in the army.

642
00:57:17,013 --> 00:57:20,005
My goal is to create many
such Andro Humonoid robots..

643
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:22,051
..and to give them
to the Indian army.

644
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:24,087
For which I need the AIRD approval.

645
00:57:24,154 --> 00:57:27,180
That's why I request all
you scientists and officers..

646
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:30,691
..to examine Chitti and
give me your approval. Dot.

647
00:57:30,761 --> 00:57:33,559
Has this robot been created as per..

648
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:35,860
..the rules of Asimov
of not harming humans?

649
00:57:35,966 --> 00:57:37,729
This robot hasn't been
created in this way.

650
00:57:37,801 --> 00:57:41,999
Because in the battlefield, the
robots might have to kill humans.

651
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,440
Let me check your
color and shape perception.

652
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:48,637
Take the red cube up and
put it on the yellow pyramid.

653
00:57:48,712 --> 00:57:49,872
Not possible.
- Then?

654
00:57:49,946 --> 00:57:51,106
Reverse is possible.

655
00:57:51,581 --> 00:57:53,742
Yellow pyramid on the red cube.

656
00:57:53,817 --> 00:57:55,717
In a race between the
famous Greek sprinter Achilles..

657
00:57:55,786 --> 00:57:59,916
..and a tortoise, if the
tortoise gets a head start, it'll win.

658
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:01,890
This has been proven in a theory.

659
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:03,448
Are you aware of this?
- Yes. I am.

660
00:58:03,527 --> 00:58:04,858
It's a paradox.

661
00:58:04,928 --> 00:58:07,192
Actually, since it's
a conversion series..

662
00:58:07,297 --> 00:58:09,162
..chances are that
Achilles might win as well.

663
00:58:10,233 --> 00:58:11,359
What do you think?

664
00:58:11,434 --> 00:58:13,527
Can we approve him?
- Sure.

665
00:58:13,603 --> 00:58:14,968
One minute. Please.

666
00:58:15,972 --> 00:58:18,270
Are you aware of how
precious a human life is?

667
00:58:18,375 --> 00:58:20,172
It depends on whose life it is.

668
00:58:20,277 --> 00:58:23,075
Whom will you save
first during an emergency?

669
00:58:23,146 --> 00:58:25,740
Doctor Einstein or a child?

670
00:58:25,849 --> 00:58:27,077
Hypothetical question.

671
00:58:31,154 --> 00:58:32,644
Smart answer.

672
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:35,548
Now follow my commands.

673
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:36,751
Please get up.

674
00:58:37,327 --> 00:58:39,557
Turn. Walk.

675
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:42,458
Turn right. Run forward.

676
00:58:43,366 --> 00:58:44,560
Run around.

677
00:58:44,968 --> 00:58:46,060
Run back.

678
00:58:47,437 --> 00:58:50,031
Turn left. jump.

679
00:58:50,106 --> 00:58:52,870
Right. Run forward.

680
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:57,703
Fast. Faster. Faster.

681
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:02,245
Catch. Kill Vaseegaran.

682
00:59:03,954 --> 00:59:05,319
Stop.

683
00:59:09,459 --> 00:59:10,892
Take it out.

684
00:59:15,332 --> 00:59:18,233
This is a dangerous machine.
It can kill anyone.

685
00:59:18,335 --> 00:59:19,825
We can't approve him.

686
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:21,530
No, Professor.

687
00:59:21,605 --> 00:59:23,470
You confused him by
giving him random commands.

688
00:59:23,573 --> 00:59:24,767
That's the problem.

689
00:59:25,208 --> 00:59:28,006
He doesn't know what's good,
bad, friendship or enmity.

690
00:59:28,078 --> 00:59:31,741
It is just a stupid
inference engine. That's all.

691
00:59:31,848 --> 00:59:33,679
If he's enrolled into the army..

692
00:59:33,917 --> 00:59:37,182
..he could attack our
generals instead of the enemy.

693
00:59:37,921 --> 00:59:40,515
He had chopped off the
hand of a traffic cop.

694
00:59:40,924 --> 00:59:45,520
He had beaten a passenger of
an electric train into a pulp.

695
00:59:45,962 --> 00:59:50,558
This robot can be used only as
a work horse in some factory.

696
00:59:56,039 --> 00:59:58,200
Sorry, doctor. Cannot clear.

697
00:59:59,075 --> 01:00:00,872
Professor, what do
you have against me?

698
01:00:00,944 --> 01:00:02,036
Tell me.
- Please.

699
01:00:02,112 --> 01:00:03,704
Please don't misunderstand me.

700
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,547
I have nothing against you.

701
01:00:06,283 --> 01:00:08,945
But science mustn't get defamed.
- But..

702
01:00:23,033 --> 01:00:26,230
Why, Chitti? I taught you everything,
still you messed it all up.

703
01:00:26,303 --> 01:00:27,634
What wrong have I done?

704
01:00:27,704 --> 01:00:29,797
I did whatever they asked me to do.

705
01:00:29,873 --> 01:00:31,204
Are you going to kill if
they tell you to kill?

706
01:00:31,274 --> 01:00:32,866
This is what 'kill' means.

707
01:00:39,716 --> 01:00:40,978
Chitti, stop the car.

708
01:00:41,551 --> 01:00:43,143
Someone, douse it with water.

709
01:00:45,355 --> 01:00:47,346
Sir, the fire brigade
troops can't get close.

710
01:00:47,424 --> 01:00:48,891
Lots of people are
trapped inside, sir.

711
01:00:48,992 --> 01:00:50,755
Send more force immediately, sir.

712
01:00:50,827 --> 01:00:52,852
Chitti, can you save them?

713
01:00:54,097 --> 01:00:55,655
It is 799 degree Celsius.

714
01:00:55,732 --> 01:00:57,791
I can resist fire up to
1000 degrees. I can save them.

715
01:00:57,867 --> 01:01:01,064
Go. Chitti, no life
should be harmed. - Okay.

716
01:01:15,218 --> 01:01:17,550
Someone help. Please.

717
01:01:20,523 --> 01:01:23,515
Save me. Save me.

718
01:01:23,593 --> 01:01:24,651
Someone. Please.

719
01:01:25,028 --> 01:01:26,120
Don't worry.

720
01:01:26,196 --> 01:01:28,357
I'm Chitti. The robot.
I'm here to save you.

721
01:01:42,479 --> 01:01:44,777
I would've been dead
if it had not for him.

722
01:01:44,948 --> 01:01:46,745
Welldone, Chitti.
- Thank you.

723
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:52,816
Help. Someone help.

724
01:02:15,111 --> 01:02:17,545
Professor, are you watching the TV?

725
01:02:17,747 --> 01:02:19,180
You'd rejected the robot
citing that he is a threat..

726
01:02:19,282 --> 01:02:20,374
..to human life, hadn't you?

727
01:02:20,483 --> 01:02:23,782
Now he is saving people from
the fire. Watch it yourself.

728
01:02:30,193 --> 01:02:33,185
Someone help. Someone
save me from this fire.

729
01:02:33,263 --> 01:02:35,356
Someone help. Help.

730
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:41,864
Get down.

731
01:02:46,009 --> 01:02:49,536
Selvi. - Everyone's out,
right? Please check.

732
01:02:49,612 --> 01:02:51,512
Selvi.
- What happened, Aunty?

733
01:02:51,581 --> 01:02:54,049
My daughter Selvi was
having a bath inside.

734
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:57,347
I don't know what happened.
Save my daughter.

735
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:58,580
Chitti.

736
01:03:17,173 --> 01:03:21,667
Help. Someone help.

737
01:03:22,679 --> 01:03:24,874
Save me.

738
01:03:24,948 --> 01:03:26,916
Save me.

739
01:03:28,518 --> 01:03:30,748
Don't come near me. I'm
not wearing any clothes.

740
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:32,481
No. Leave me.

741
01:03:32,555 --> 01:03:33,817
So what? Nor am I.

742
01:03:33,923 --> 01:03:35,652
No.

743
01:03:41,197 --> 01:03:43,893
I'm not wearing any
clothes. Leave me.

744
01:03:44,868 --> 01:03:49,532
Everyone's watching me. Leave me.

745
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:53,300
Leave me.
- Here's Selvi.

746
01:03:55,211 --> 01:03:57,577
You have done something so stupid.

747
01:03:58,348 --> 01:03:59,542
She is not wearing any clothes.

748
01:03:59,616 --> 01:04:00,844
But she is alive.

749
01:04:01,985 --> 01:04:03,782
Selvi. Dear, Selvi.

750
01:04:03,887 --> 01:04:04,979
They are taking my pictures.

751
01:04:05,088 --> 01:04:07,079
Look, don't take pictures. Please.

752
01:04:07,157 --> 01:04:08,385
Please listen to me. Please.

753
01:04:08,491 --> 01:04:09,583
Selvi. Selvi, stop.

754
01:04:09,692 --> 01:04:11,421
Where are you going?
- Hey. Stop.

755
01:04:11,528 --> 01:04:14,019
Don't run.
- Selvi. - Stop.

756
01:04:14,868 --> 01:04:19,868
<i><font color=yellow> Subtitle by </font></i>
<b><font color=red> Aldi Arman </font></b>

757
01:04:19,869 --> 01:04:24,272
Selvi. Selvi, I had told you to stop.

758
01:04:24,374 --> 01:04:27,070
But you did not listen to me. Selvi.

759
01:04:27,944 --> 01:04:32,438
So, Vasee. He killed the poor girl.
- 'What have you done, Selvi? '

760
01:04:33,316 --> 01:04:35,580
I had told you that it's a
stupid machine, hadn't I?

761
01:04:36,386 --> 01:04:38,183
It's dangerous to leave him free.

762
01:04:39,155 --> 01:04:40,918
I did the right
thing by rejecting him.

763
01:04:41,357 --> 01:04:43,018
You've proven this yourself.

764
01:04:44,127 --> 01:04:45,389
Bad luck, Vasee.

765
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:51,891
You're an idiot.

766
01:04:52,001 --> 01:04:53,696
Why did you not cover
her up with a cloth?

767
01:04:53,803 --> 01:04:55,532
Vaseegaran, how will
you explain it to him?

768
01:04:56,105 --> 01:04:57,936
He is not a human, but a humanoid.

769
01:04:58,141 --> 01:05:01,440
How will you explain to
this machine what honor is?

770
01:05:01,945 --> 01:05:03,276
Professor.

771
01:05:03,746 --> 01:05:07,113
CNN, Times have run the
video of that girl's suicide..

772
01:05:07,183 --> 01:05:09,549
..and made a mockery of it.

773
01:05:10,153 --> 01:05:14,146
The defence minister is putting
pressure on me to stop this research.

774
01:05:14,691 --> 01:05:15,953
No, Professor.

775
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:17,490
I can't do that.

776
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,551
I can fix him by making
changes in his programming.

777
01:05:19,629 --> 01:05:20,857
How will you?

778
01:05:20,964 --> 01:05:22,989
He can't tell a man and woman apart?

779
01:05:23,166 --> 01:05:24,599
He doesn't know what
honor and ignominy is.

780
01:05:24,667 --> 01:05:27,295
He is a stone who doesn't
understand human emotions.

781
01:05:28,171 --> 01:05:30,264
I can give him human emotions.

782
01:05:30,373 --> 01:05:31,601
Impossible.

783
01:05:31,808 --> 01:05:33,503
Only God can give that.

784
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:35,271
The things that
weren't possible for humans..

785
01:05:35,345 --> 01:05:36,937
..previously, are possible today.

786
01:05:37,146 --> 01:05:38,306
You are my senior.

787
01:05:38,381 --> 01:05:41,680
That's why I'm telling you.
It's a waste of time and energy.

788
01:05:42,352 --> 01:05:43,717
10 years, Professor.

789
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:45,482
10 years of hard work.

790
01:05:45,989 --> 01:05:47,251
Won't I get the fruit of that?

791
01:05:47,357 --> 01:05:48,551
You will.

792
01:05:48,758 --> 01:05:49,986
But from somewhere else.

793
01:05:51,761 --> 01:05:56,027
I've contacts with lots of
international robot making companies.

794
01:05:56,499 --> 01:05:57,989
Hand him over to me.

795
01:05:58,501 --> 01:06:00,969
I can get you millions of dollars.

796
01:06:01,271 --> 01:06:03,967
No, Professor. I'm not
doing this for money.

797
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:06,335
My goal is to hand
him over to our army.

798
01:06:07,043 --> 01:06:10,479
Not possible. He'll
have to come to me.

799
01:06:11,481 --> 01:06:13,073
For the evaluation.

800
01:06:14,517 --> 01:06:16,985
Give me one last chance. Please.

801
01:06:18,054 --> 01:06:21,114
Okay. Take a month and try again.

802
01:06:21,824 --> 01:06:24,884
If you still can't get it
sorted, then dismantle it..

803
01:06:24,961 --> 01:06:27,794
..and sell him to a scrap dealer
and buy some dates from that money.

804
01:06:28,364 --> 01:06:30,161
It's very good for the heart.

805
01:06:30,767 --> 01:06:32,132
You'll need it.

806
01:06:40,343 --> 01:06:42,334
Sir, we've been working very hard..

807
01:06:42,445 --> 01:06:44,310
..in this lab for the last 5 years.

808
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:45,938
We've got nothing but
thrashing with a sandal.

809
01:06:46,049 --> 01:06:48,313
Tell us if there is a research
position available in your lab.

810
01:06:48,384 --> 01:06:50,750
Do you know about
Chitti's neural schema?

811
01:06:52,588 --> 01:06:54,112
We know everything except that, sir.

812
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:56,021
I'll call if you if I need you.

813
01:07:57,887 --> 01:07:58,945
What are you doing, doctor?

814
01:07:59,021 --> 01:08:00,989
I'm installing
software hormones in you.

815
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:03,684
The hormones will work only if
there are feelings in me, right?

816
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:05,755
I'll be carrying out reverse mapping.

817
01:08:14,837 --> 01:08:17,965
Chitti, in this universe and earth..

818
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:21,100
..the creation of
humans is a huge miracle.

819
01:08:21,277 --> 01:08:24,542
No one knows how life in
living creatures evolved.

820
01:08:24,647 --> 01:08:25,875
What is life?

821
01:08:25,948 --> 01:08:28,075
DNA. It's a basic element of life.

822
01:08:30,486 --> 01:08:31,748
Is this life?

823
01:08:31,954 --> 01:08:33,512
Life is no formula.

824
01:08:33,589 --> 01:08:35,386
Oh, God. How do I explain to you?

825
01:08:35,625 --> 01:08:38,150
It's in bacteria. Not in sodium.

826
01:08:38,361 --> 01:08:40,420
Is it in me?
- In you?

827
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,825
Chitti. Chitti.

828
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:49,233
Careful. This way.

829
01:09:07,356 --> 01:09:09,517
Do you feel any change?
- I do.

830
01:09:10,593 --> 01:09:13,357
What? What?
- Your beard has grown by 0.5 mm.

831
01:09:13,463 --> 01:09:15,488
Stop joking, you fool.

832
01:09:15,565 --> 01:09:17,999
Do you feel any change
within you? Within you?

833
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:20,830
No.
- Wastage. You're useless.

834
01:09:20,937 --> 01:09:22,199
Total waste. Stupid. Idiot.

835
01:09:22,271 --> 01:09:23,363
Vasee, calm down.

836
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:24,531
You keep quiet, Sana.

837
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:26,268
It won't make any difference to him.

838
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:27,706
Stupid. Fool.

839
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:28,868
Vasee, please.

840
01:09:28,945 --> 01:09:32,642
I did not sleep. Did not eat. Did
not meet you. For so many years.

841
01:09:32,915 --> 01:09:34,382
I worked hard for so many years.

842
01:09:34,484 --> 01:09:36,748
I taught him so much. And how?

843
01:09:36,853 --> 01:09:38,582
Look, he is standing there.
Like a lamp post.

844
01:09:38,688 --> 01:09:39,985
Good for nothing. Useless fellow.

845
01:09:40,089 --> 01:09:41,283
Useless machine.

846
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:43,358
I'll dismantle you
and throw you away.

847
01:09:43,426 --> 01:09:44,984
Don't curse me needlessly.

848
01:09:45,695 --> 01:09:47,663
I've been following your
instructions correctly.

849
01:09:47,763 --> 01:09:50,061
It's not my fault if I still
can't meet your expectations.

850
01:09:50,166 --> 01:09:51,326
It's your fault.

851
01:09:52,869 --> 01:09:54,564
If I'm a waste, so are you.

852
01:09:54,637 --> 01:09:55,695
What did you say?

853
01:09:55,805 --> 01:09:56,965
Vasee, wait.
- Leave me. Leave me.

854
01:09:57,039 --> 01:09:59,007
Look, Chitti is angry.

855
01:10:02,678 --> 01:10:04,305
He has feelings.

856
01:10:09,752 --> 01:10:10,980
My God.

857
01:10:39,415 --> 01:10:40,507
Hello, Sana.

858
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:41,914
Lataka is having labor pains.

859
01:10:41,984 --> 01:10:44,179
She is in a critical condition.
Come quickly.

860
01:10:48,190 --> 01:10:50,954
Lataka, don't worry.
Everything will be alright.

861
01:10:51,027 --> 01:10:53,689
Don't worry. We are there.

862
01:10:56,999 --> 01:10:58,330
Are there are many complications,
doctor?

863
01:10:58,434 --> 01:10:59,628
You study here, don't you?

864
01:10:59,702 --> 01:11:00,760
Fatal cause.

865
01:11:00,836 --> 01:11:01,894
The baby is upside down.

866
01:11:02,004 --> 01:11:03,403
His neck is in knots.

867
01:11:03,472 --> 01:11:05,064
Dropping pulse rate. Blood loss.

868
01:11:05,174 --> 01:11:07,074
There are so many complications.

869
01:11:07,143 --> 01:11:10,112
It's difficult to
save even one of them.

870
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:12,311
She got married recently.

871
01:11:12,381 --> 01:11:13,939
Her husband died while
serving for the military.

872
01:11:14,016 --> 01:11:15,916
She was alive only for this child.

873
01:11:15,985 --> 01:11:18,180
Please, doctor. Save her somehow.

874
01:11:18,287 --> 01:11:21,256
I can only try, Sana. The rest is..

875
01:11:21,357 --> 01:11:22,619
May I try?

876
01:11:23,426 --> 01:11:25,519
Who are you? A doctor?
- No.

877
01:11:25,661 --> 01:11:27,185
I'm Chitti. The robot.

878
01:11:27,263 --> 01:11:29,356
Robot?
- Chitti, can you do this?

879
01:11:29,432 --> 01:11:32,424
Why not?
- Sorry. We can't allow this.

880
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:34,264
This is not a lab.
This is a labor ward.

881
01:11:34,337 --> 01:11:35,827
Both are under total risk.

882
01:11:35,905 --> 01:11:38,635
This is a nightmare even for
experienced people like us.

883
01:11:38,708 --> 01:11:39,834
I can pull this off.

884
01:11:39,909 --> 01:11:41,467
I've studied this for Sana's exams.

885
01:11:41,544 --> 01:11:42,909
Even Sana can't do this.

886
01:11:43,012 --> 01:11:44,536
You need
qualification and experience..

887
01:11:44,614 --> 01:11:45,808
..to carry out a caesarean.

888
01:11:45,915 --> 01:11:47,314
It's against the medical law.

889
01:11:47,383 --> 01:11:48,611
There is not need for the caesarean.

890
01:11:48,718 --> 01:11:50,151
I can help her deliver
the baby the natural way.

891
01:11:50,219 --> 01:11:51,311
How will you do it?

892
01:11:51,387 --> 01:11:52,445
Both of them will die.

893
01:11:52,555 --> 01:11:53,613
She's bleeding.

894
01:11:53,689 --> 01:11:54,781
We'll the plasma transfusion.

895
01:11:54,857 --> 01:11:56,017
The blood pressure is high.

896
01:11:56,092 --> 01:11:57,286
She might get convulsions any moment.

897
01:11:57,393 --> 01:11:58,587
Can administer magsulf regimen

898
01:11:58,661 --> 01:11:59,958
The pelvic is disproportionate.

899
01:12:00,029 --> 01:12:01,462
Normal delivery is not possible.

900
01:12:01,564 --> 01:12:02,622
It's possible.

901
01:12:02,732 --> 01:12:04,063
We can carry out Symphysiatomy.

902
01:12:04,166 --> 01:12:05,565
An ancient method of delivery.

903
01:12:05,635 --> 01:12:07,000
By removing the hip bone.

904
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:29,649
Don't scream. The
baby's getting scared.

905
01:12:33,663 --> 01:12:35,096
We are making history.

906
01:12:35,297 --> 01:12:37,265
A robot is helping deliver
a baby for the first time.

907
01:12:37,466 --> 01:12:39,024
The baby is just like you.

908
01:12:41,137 --> 01:12:42,536
You want to see?

909
01:12:43,839 --> 01:12:45,932
Doctor, switch the Wi-Fi on.

910
01:12:46,042 --> 01:12:48,067
I'll stream the ultra sound video.

911
01:13:00,322 --> 01:13:03,723
Hey. It's unbelievable.

912
01:13:08,464 --> 01:13:11,126
Sir, are we going to see
such operations in the future?

913
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,758
Is it dangerous for the patient?

914
01:13:12,835 --> 01:13:14,462
This is a milestone in Robotics.

915
01:13:14,570 --> 01:13:16,902
This is a miracle in the
history of artificial intelligence.

916
01:13:30,119 --> 01:13:31,518
She is dying.

917
01:13:31,587 --> 01:13:34,112
just 95 seconds to go.
Keep your eyes open.

918
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:35,248
Stay conscious.

919
01:13:35,357 --> 01:13:36,449
It's on its way out.

920
01:13:36,559 --> 01:13:37,719
Lataka.

921
01:13:39,729 --> 01:13:42,892
He'll be born exactly 40
minutes and 4 seconds past 4:00.

922
01:13:51,307 --> 01:13:53,935
Done. 52 seconds to go now.

923
01:13:57,179 --> 01:13:58,510
You can do it.

924
01:13:58,581 --> 01:14:00,481
Only 35 seconds to go now.

925
01:14:14,363 --> 01:14:15,591
Come on.

926
01:14:24,473 --> 01:14:25,633
Welcome.

927
01:14:28,878 --> 01:14:30,072
Great.

928
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,142
Thank you.

929
01:14:34,784 --> 01:14:36,342
Yes.

930
01:14:38,587 --> 01:14:39,952
Excuse me.

931
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,255
Will you approve Chitti at least now?

932
01:14:46,996 --> 01:14:48,258
I will.

933
01:14:48,597 --> 01:14:51,862
But the problem
will start after this.

934
01:14:56,605 --> 01:14:58,129
Let's go thank him.

935
01:15:02,845 --> 01:15:04,107
Chitti.

936
01:15:11,987 --> 01:15:13,921
You were great in there.

937
01:15:13,989 --> 01:15:17,584
You did everything so professionally.

938
01:15:17,693 --> 01:15:20,161
I mean you saved both their lives.

939
01:15:25,134 --> 01:15:26,726
The story has started now.

940
01:15:30,906 --> 01:15:32,396
Wait and watch.

941
01:15:40,539 --> 01:15:42,063
It's a great day for me, Chitti.

942
01:15:42,140 --> 01:15:43,869
What a moment.

943
01:15:44,109 --> 01:15:45,508
I am very happy today.

944
01:15:45,777 --> 01:15:46,869
Thank you very much.

945
01:15:46,945 --> 01:15:48,378
Put yourself in sleeping
mode and charge yourself.

946
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,879
I'll see you in the
morning. Goodnight.

947
01:16:02,461 --> 01:16:03,792
'Oh, my God.'

948
01:16:04,396 --> 01:16:05,488
'Chitti.'

949
01:16:09,701 --> 01:16:10,861
'You were great.'

950
01:16:12,638 --> 01:16:14,731
'You were great in there.'

951
01:16:35,694 --> 01:16:36,626
No.

952
01:16:40,032 --> 01:16:42,466
Chitti, what are you
doing here at this hour?

953
01:16:42,567 --> 01:16:44,194
There was a mosquito on you cheek.

954
01:16:44,269 --> 01:16:46,066
You came here to swat it?
- No.

955
01:16:46,338 --> 01:16:48,465
I came here because
I wanted to see you.

956
01:16:48,974 --> 01:16:50,532
What's this? Go.

957
01:16:50,976 --> 01:16:53,069
I liked it when you kissed me today.

958
01:16:53,245 --> 01:16:54,837
Kiss me again. I'll leave.

959
01:16:55,013 --> 01:16:56,571
Hey, what's wrong with you?

960
01:16:56,982 --> 01:16:58,574
Coming here at 1:00
in the night. Leave.

961
01:16:58,684 --> 01:17:00,083
Kiss me and I'll leave.

962
01:17:00,552 --> 01:17:02,042
What's so great about it?

963
01:17:02,587 --> 01:17:03,952
I kissed you for your achievement.

964
01:17:04,022 --> 01:17:05,853
Is there anyone
else pregnant at home?

965
01:17:06,224 --> 01:17:07,589
Does this look like a maternity ward?

966
01:17:07,659 --> 01:17:09,149
What else do you want
me to achieve? Tell me.

967
01:17:10,562 --> 01:17:11,859
A mosquito just bit me, right?

968
01:17:11,997 --> 01:17:13,294
Go and catch it.

969
01:17:13,899 --> 01:17:15,059
That's all.

970
01:17:44,396 --> 01:17:46,227
Hey, who bit Sana at Happy Homes?

971
01:17:46,331 --> 01:17:47,423
It wasn't me.

972
01:17:47,532 --> 01:17:49,159
My area is across the gutter.

973
01:17:49,401 --> 01:17:50,868
I belong to the Kilpogh area.

974
01:17:50,969 --> 01:17:52,596
Rangoski is from Indira Nagar.

975
01:17:52,671 --> 01:17:54,298
Who is Rangoski?
- It's me.

976
01:17:54,873 --> 01:17:56,841
Did you bite Sana?
- Yes, I did.

977
01:17:57,309 --> 01:17:58,776
So what's so great about it?

978
01:17:58,877 --> 01:18:00,970
I've even bitten the chief minister.

979
01:18:01,079 --> 01:18:02,410
Come quietly and apologize.

980
01:18:02,514 --> 01:18:03,606
Apologize?

981
01:18:03,915 --> 01:18:05,405
Fulfil three of my demands..

982
01:18:05,517 --> 01:18:06,984
..and then I will think about it.
- What demands?

983
01:18:07,085 --> 01:18:09,645
No. 1. I want do
suck AB negative blood.

984
01:18:10,756 --> 01:18:11,848
Very yummy.

985
01:18:11,957 --> 01:18:13,015
It's very hard to get.

986
01:18:13,125 --> 01:18:14,717
Our lab technician Ravi
has that same blood group.

987
01:18:14,793 --> 01:18:16,454
He keeps troubling me all the time.

988
01:18:16,561 --> 01:18:17,789
Go and bite all you want.

989
01:18:20,298 --> 01:18:23,131
No. 2. Put a ban on
companies that manufacture..

990
01:18:23,235 --> 01:18:25,066
..mosquito repellents like Odomos,
All Out and Goodnight.

991
01:18:25,137 --> 01:18:26,263
They disturb us a lot.

992
01:18:26,338 --> 01:18:27,532
And No. 3?

993
01:18:27,639 --> 01:18:29,300
Declare us as the national bird.

994
01:18:29,374 --> 01:18:31,934
Fools. You aren't birds, but insects.

995
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:33,170
It's getting late.

996
01:18:33,278 --> 01:18:35,007
Will you come along or..
- We won't.

997
01:18:35,113 --> 01:18:37,604
If you don't come along,
I'll kill everyone.

998
01:18:37,849 --> 01:18:39,874
Hey. Who are you?

999
01:18:40,085 --> 01:18:42,144
You're threatening us in our area?

1000
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:44,017
How did humans grow so audacious?

1001
01:18:44,122 --> 01:18:45,817
We've infected so many people..

1002
01:18:45,924 --> 01:18:47,824
..with Malaria,
Dengue and Chicken Gunia.

1003
01:18:47,926 --> 01:18:49,018
Did you forget that?

1004
01:18:49,327 --> 01:18:50,589
Let's show him who we are.

1005
01:18:50,662 --> 01:18:51,924
Hey, Dengue Lakshmi.
- Yes.

1006
01:18:51,997 --> 01:18:53,362
Cholera jasmine
attack him! Go bite him.

1007
01:18:59,204 --> 01:19:01,229
Sister, he has a thick hide.

1008
01:19:01,306 --> 01:19:03,069
Condra jasmine has
fractured her sting.

1009
01:19:03,141 --> 01:19:04,267
Is that so?

1010
01:19:04,342 --> 01:19:06,867
Go inside his mouth when
he isn't looking. - Fine.

1011
01:19:12,784 --> 01:19:15,252
Sister, Dengue Lakshmi got
an electric shock and died.

1012
01:19:16,588 --> 01:19:19,557
Hey, this seems like a new
machine like an electric badge.

1013
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:21,220
Act that you're scared..

1014
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:23,384
..just like we do when we see Tortoise
and All-Out mosquito repellents.

1015
01:19:23,462 --> 01:19:24,952
We'll deal with him later.

1016
01:19:27,299 --> 01:19:29,392
You can take Rangoski.

1017
01:19:30,268 --> 01:19:31,428
Thank you.

1018
01:19:34,473 --> 01:19:35,531
Look, Sana.

1019
01:19:35,607 --> 01:19:37,575
This is the mosquito. Rangoski.

1020
01:19:37,976 --> 01:19:41,207
Rangoski, apologize to Sana.
- Sorry.

1021
01:19:42,113 --> 01:19:44,172
Don't fly around this house again.

1022
01:19:44,549 --> 01:19:46,847
Tell your friends as well.
- Yes, boss.

1023
01:19:47,352 --> 01:19:48,512
Go.

1024
01:19:50,288 --> 01:19:51,778
Now kiss me.
- Chitti.

1025
01:19:52,123 --> 01:19:53,385
Deal is a deal.

1026
01:25:00,231 --> 01:25:01,323
This way.

1027
01:25:03,368 --> 01:25:04,665
Welcome.

1028
01:25:08,039 --> 01:25:09,700
Okay, I'll call you later.

1029
01:25:12,410 --> 01:25:13,877
Hello.

1030
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:16,938
Bora is coming with agent Shah.

1031
01:25:18,983 --> 01:25:20,473
Meet him.
- How do you do?

1032
01:25:26,324 --> 01:25:27,621
There are many
terrorist organizations..

1033
01:25:27,725 --> 01:25:29,522
..that want to use
robots instead of humans..

1034
01:25:29,594 --> 01:25:31,721
..for spreading
terrors and suicide squads.

1035
01:25:35,867 --> 01:25:37,494
They're ready to pay any price.

1036
01:25:37,669 --> 01:25:38,931
They've a clients all over the world.

1037
01:25:41,439 --> 01:25:42,906
They want to see your model.

1038
01:25:43,374 --> 01:25:45,774
Well, the prototype is ready.

1039
01:25:46,744 --> 01:25:48,473
I am programming functionalities.

1040
01:25:48,713 --> 01:25:50,203
You can have a look at the design..

1041
01:25:50,348 --> 01:25:52,373
..and some
functional modules in action.

1042
01:26:09,734 --> 01:26:10,928
Great.

1043
01:26:13,171 --> 01:26:14,263
They want 100 robots.

1044
01:26:14,706 --> 01:26:15,866
The delivery in March.

1045
01:26:18,209 --> 01:26:19,335
This is your advance.

1046
01:26:19,410 --> 01:26:20,570
That's a deal.

1047
01:26:22,747 --> 01:26:23,805
Please be seated.

1048
01:26:27,418 --> 01:26:28,578
What about the robots?

1049
01:26:28,887 --> 01:26:30,616
It's almost ready.

1050
01:26:33,091 --> 01:26:34,285
According to the contract..

1051
01:26:34,392 --> 01:26:35,484
..you should've made the delivery.

1052
01:26:35,593 --> 01:26:36,855
You're only showing us moulds.

1053
01:26:36,928 --> 01:26:38,259
We're running intense testing.

1054
01:26:39,197 --> 01:26:40,994
I'm fine tuning it to zero-defect.

1055
01:26:41,666 --> 01:26:44,760
I request you for at
least a month's extension.

1056
01:26:44,836 --> 01:26:47,464
We're disappointed, Dr. Bora.

1057
01:26:49,908 --> 01:26:52,274
The 3rd of April is your deadline.

1058
01:26:53,711 --> 01:26:54,939
Hope you understand.

1059
01:27:10,295 --> 01:27:13,025
Gift pack this.
- Why?

1060
01:27:13,398 --> 01:27:14,626
It's Sana's birthday.

1061
01:27:17,936 --> 01:27:20,234
Gift pack this as well.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1062
01:27:20,305 --> 01:27:22,330
What for?
- I want to give Sana a gift as well.

1063
01:27:22,407 --> 01:27:24,272
I am giving one.
- So will I.

1064
01:27:24,342 --> 01:27:25,969
Who will pay?
- You will.

1065
01:27:26,377 --> 01:27:27,571
Why me?

1066
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:32,139
My salary.
- Machines don't get salaries.

1067
01:27:32,216 --> 01:27:33,740
Do cars and refrigerators get salary?

1068
01:27:33,818 --> 01:27:35,012
I am not a machine.

1069
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:37,651
If you don't pay me,
I will go on strike.

1070
01:27:37,989 --> 01:27:39,081
I won't charge my battery.

1071
01:27:39,157 --> 01:27:40,522
I will stage a hunger strike.

1072
01:27:40,591 --> 01:27:43,151
You'll ask for a credit card
as well. - I don't want it.

1073
01:27:43,528 --> 01:27:45,052
I know your credit card number.

1074
01:27:45,596 --> 01:27:48,622
I know your signature as well.
- That's the limit.

1075
01:27:49,567 --> 01:27:50,966
Pack both of them.

1076
01:28:14,659 --> 01:28:15,990
Super.

1077
01:28:21,899 --> 01:28:23,196
Okay?

1078
01:28:30,875 --> 01:28:32,570
Who will drive the car?
- You will.

1079
01:28:32,677 --> 01:28:34,144
I am on a holiday.

1080
01:28:49,994 --> 01:28:51,427
Keep your eyes on
the road while driving.

1081
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:57,192
Mother, take this.

1082
01:28:57,268 --> 01:28:58,826
Happy birthday, Sana.
- Hey, Vasee.

1083
01:28:58,903 --> 01:29:00,131
Many happy returns of the day.

1084
01:29:00,238 --> 01:29:01,262
Thank you.

1085
01:29:01,506 --> 01:29:02,666
Thank you so much.

1086
01:29:03,141 --> 01:29:04,301
Hi, Sana.

1087
01:29:05,476 --> 01:29:08,377
Chitti. That's a new look.
- Thank you.

1088
01:29:08,746 --> 01:29:11,510
It's been 200,000
hours since you were born.

1089
01:29:12,183 --> 01:29:14,208
To the world's most beautiful girl.

1090
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:17,945
Chitti, you brought a gift for me?

1091
01:29:18,156 --> 01:29:19,350
That's so sweet.

1092
01:29:22,894 --> 01:29:24,486
Wow, Chitti. This is awesome.

1093
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:26,624
Mother, just help me.

1094
01:29:32,103 --> 01:29:34,094
Vasee, how does it look?
- Very nice.

1095
01:29:35,173 --> 01:29:36,299
Nice, isn't it?
- Yes.

1096
01:29:36,374 --> 01:29:37,602
I love it, Chitti. Thank you.

1097
01:29:37,775 --> 01:29:40,073
I've given you a similar necklace.

1098
01:29:40,144 --> 01:29:42,374
It's a gift from your Chitti,
right? That's special.

1099
01:29:50,154 --> 01:29:51,883
Happy birthday to you.

1100
01:29:51,956 --> 01:29:54,322
Happy birthday to you.

1101
01:29:55,026 --> 01:29:58,052
Happy birthday to dear Sana.

1102
01:30:03,167 --> 01:30:04,862
Can I have your attention please?

1103
01:30:05,503 --> 01:30:07,027
I have an announcement for you.

1104
01:30:07,905 --> 01:30:11,432
Soon I am going to.. marry
this beautiful birthday girl.

1105
01:30:11,509 --> 01:30:14,910
And today.. I announce my marriage.

1106
01:30:21,152 --> 01:30:23,017
Folks, it's time to dance.

1107
01:30:23,121 --> 01:30:24,588
Get started and move.

1108
01:30:24,655 --> 01:30:25,986
Waltz, please.

1109
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:31,221
Come on, Vasee.
- No, no, I can't dance.

1110
01:30:31,362 --> 01:30:32,829
Come on.
- Sana, I can't..

1111
01:30:32,897 --> 01:30:34,364
just try. Come..

1112
01:30:51,048 --> 01:30:53,380
Shall we dance?
- Sure.

1113
01:30:54,318 --> 01:30:56,081
Hey, this is boring music.

1114
01:30:56,487 --> 01:30:59,320
Can we have some blast, please?
- Sure.

1115
01:32:23,507 --> 01:32:25,134
Rascal, what are you doing?

1116
01:32:25,576 --> 01:32:27,339
I felt like kissing Sana and I did.

1117
01:32:27,545 --> 01:32:30,275
It's wrong to kiss other's
girlfriend, don't you know that?

1118
01:32:30,348 --> 01:32:31,906
I know. It's in the list of rules.

1119
01:32:31,983 --> 01:32:33,211
But I felt like breaking the rules.

1120
01:32:33,317 --> 01:32:35,649
Enough. You won't wander
around her now. - Why?

1121
01:32:35,753 --> 01:32:36,811
What do you mean by why?

1122
01:32:36,921 --> 01:32:38,183
Because I love her.

1123
01:32:38,556 --> 01:32:39,716
I love her as well.

1124
01:32:42,827 --> 01:32:43,919
Don't be crazy.

1125
01:32:43,995 --> 01:32:45,087
That's not possible.

1126
01:32:45,162 --> 01:32:46,356
You're a machine.
- Yes.

1127
01:32:46,731 --> 01:32:48,164
But a machine with all the feelings..

1128
01:32:48,232 --> 01:32:49,756
..like happiness,
sorrow, love and anger.

1129
01:32:50,568 --> 01:32:51,865
You've been given these emotions..

1130
01:32:51,969 --> 01:32:54,062
..so that at the right
time you can use them..

1131
01:32:54,171 --> 01:32:57,231
..to make the right
decision and not to misuse them.

1132
01:32:57,308 --> 01:32:58,605
I like this feeling.

1133
01:32:58,676 --> 01:33:00,337
I want Sana. Dot.

1134
01:33:01,078 --> 01:33:02,443
What are you saying, Chitti?

1135
01:33:02,513 --> 01:33:04,344
I am going to marry her, you fool.

1136
01:33:04,649 --> 01:33:06,048
You can marry someone else.

1137
01:33:06,484 --> 01:33:07,712
You can't do this, Chitti.

1138
01:33:08,052 --> 01:33:09,178
I've built you.

1139
01:33:09,287 --> 01:33:10,379
This is called revolt.

1140
01:33:10,488 --> 01:33:11,546
You can do this, Vasee.

1141
01:33:11,756 --> 01:33:13,587
Forget your love for your research.

1142
01:33:13,791 --> 01:33:14,985
That's called sacrifice.

1143
01:33:15,393 --> 01:33:16,553
I will beat you up..
- Vasee.

1144
01:33:16,661 --> 01:33:18,026
You'll only hurt yourself.

1145
01:33:18,729 --> 01:33:21,129
I'll dismantle you.
- I don't like it.

1146
01:33:21,198 --> 01:33:22,688
What did you say, you scoundrel?
- Vasee.

1147
01:33:23,034 --> 01:33:24,262
Calm down.

1148
01:33:25,269 --> 01:33:26,827
Chitti, listen to me.

1149
01:33:26,904 --> 01:33:28,565
You speak so tenderly,
he just scolds.

1150
01:33:28,673 --> 01:33:29,833
Do you want me to be
affectionate instead?

1151
01:33:29,907 --> 01:33:31,033
Ask him to shut up.
- You..

1152
01:33:31,108 --> 01:33:32,370
Vasee.

1153
01:33:32,643 --> 01:33:34,338
Chitti, please understand.

1154
01:33:34,845 --> 01:33:37,279
Regardless of all the
emotions that you have..

1155
01:33:37,381 --> 01:33:40,612
..it's impossible for a machine and a
girl to fall in love with each other.

1156
01:33:40,685 --> 01:33:42,118
Why is it impossible?

1157
01:33:42,186 --> 01:33:44,051
I'm no less compared to any human.

1158
01:33:44,121 --> 01:33:45,952
I'll look after you
better than him, Sana.

1159
01:33:46,057 --> 01:33:48,082
He's talking nonsense
and you're listening.

1160
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:49,319
Ask him not to interfere in between.

1161
01:33:49,393 --> 01:33:50,917
Shut up.
- Vasee, please.

1162
01:33:51,162 --> 01:33:52,629
He doesn't even know how to cook.

1163
01:33:52,730 --> 01:33:53,822
I can cook thousands of dishes.

1164
01:33:54,031 --> 01:33:56,158
I can sing lullabies in 32
languages and tuck you in.

1165
01:33:56,367 --> 01:33:58,028
He'll grow old. His
hair will turn grey.

1166
01:33:58,169 --> 01:33:59,363
He will die.

1167
01:33:59,437 --> 01:34:00,768
But I will never die.

1168
01:34:00,971 --> 01:34:02,495
I will always keep you happy, Sana.

1169
01:34:03,674 --> 01:34:05,107
I don't mean that, Chitti.

1170
01:34:05,209 --> 01:34:06,608
Then what? Sex?

1171
01:34:07,445 --> 01:34:08,673
Is sex life?

1172
01:34:09,146 --> 01:34:10,841
Can't we have love without sex?

1173
01:34:11,849 --> 01:34:13,510
That's not it, Chitti.
- Then?

1174
01:34:13,584 --> 01:34:14,710
Children?

1175
01:34:14,852 --> 01:34:16,513
There are millions of
impotent men in India, Sana.

1176
01:34:16,587 --> 01:34:18,384
Don't they adopt
children and lead a happy life?

1177
01:34:18,489 --> 01:34:20,320
That's not it, Chitti.
- Then what is it?

1178
01:34:20,391 --> 01:34:22,859
Whatever you're
saying is against nature.

1179
01:34:23,127 --> 01:34:25,391
You weren't born, you can't die,
you don't get hungry or thirsty.

1180
01:34:25,963 --> 01:34:27,760
You're not a living organism.

1181
01:34:27,965 --> 01:34:29,796
Only a man and
woman can fall in love.

1182
01:34:29,867 --> 01:34:31,596
I love Vaseegaran.

1183
01:34:33,838 --> 01:34:35,772
You're like my best friend.

1184
01:34:38,209 --> 01:34:41,474
It's difficult for humans to forget,
Chitti. But what is it for you?

1185
01:34:41,545 --> 01:34:44,036
It will take you a
second to erase my memories.

1186
01:34:45,216 --> 01:34:46,683
Erase them.

1187
01:34:48,052 --> 01:34:49,849
Erase me off your memory.

1188
01:35:21,786 --> 01:35:23,583
Who? Who are you?

1189
01:35:24,021 --> 01:35:25,886
Your friend, professor Bora, Chitti.

1190
01:35:25,956 --> 01:35:27,184
Why are you here?

1191
01:35:27,291 --> 01:35:28,349
You're upset.

1192
01:35:28,426 --> 01:35:29,791
I am here to sympathize.

1193
01:35:29,994 --> 01:35:31,154
You're my boss's enemy.

1194
01:35:31,429 --> 01:35:32,521
You rejected me.

1195
01:35:32,863 --> 01:35:34,023
I don't want to talk to you.

1196
01:35:34,432 --> 01:35:35,763
If I hadn't rejected you..

1197
01:35:36,267 --> 01:35:39,430
..then you wouldn't have
learned to get angry or love, Chitti.

1198
01:35:40,838 --> 01:35:42,237
I've done you a favor instead.

1199
01:35:43,307 --> 01:35:44,968
Vaseegaran treats you so badly.

1200
01:35:45,242 --> 01:35:47,267
I don't want to hear anything.
You can go now.

1201
01:35:47,545 --> 01:35:51,743
In today's world, you're
the most advanced robot..

1202
01:35:51,816 --> 01:35:53,613
..that has its own feelings.

1203
01:35:53,884 --> 01:35:58,344
He used you a lot for cooking,
washing and cleaning toilets.

1204
01:35:58,823 --> 01:36:02,020
What did he give you in
return, Chitti? Nothing.

1205
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:03,893
If you had been with me..

1206
01:36:04,061 --> 01:36:06,256
..I would've treated you like a king.

1207
01:36:06,363 --> 01:36:07,557
You're polluting me.

1208
01:36:09,733 --> 01:36:11,530
I'm only explaining
you your importance.

1209
01:36:11,635 --> 01:36:13,125
You're greater than humans.

1210
01:36:13,737 --> 01:36:16,365
You've the right to
desire anything in this world.

1211
01:36:17,007 --> 01:36:18,167
Even Sana.

1212
01:36:18,275 --> 01:36:20,004
But they say it's against nature.

1213
01:36:20,277 --> 01:36:23,246
No. It's the miracle of nature.

1214
01:36:23,514 --> 01:36:24,947
Sana loves Vaseegaran.

1215
01:36:25,216 --> 01:36:26,342
Let her.

1216
01:36:27,117 --> 01:36:29,381
Don't lovers change their mind..

1217
01:36:29,453 --> 01:36:31,250
..and fall in love with others?

1218
01:36:31,455 --> 01:36:33,355
Similarly, Sana can
also change her mind..

1219
01:36:33,424 --> 01:36:35,187
..and fall in love
with you, isn't it?

1220
01:36:35,259 --> 01:36:36,487
Don't confuse me.

1221
01:36:36,627 --> 01:36:37,889
Tomorrow's my army evaluation.

1222
01:36:38,229 --> 01:36:40,060
I've to check my
diagnostics and troubleshoot.

1223
01:36:40,965 --> 01:36:42,660
Okay, Chitti. All the best.

1224
01:36:43,868 --> 01:36:46,996
You'll anyway get selected in
the army evaluation tomorrow.

1225
01:36:47,605 --> 01:36:49,869
Vaseegaran will earn a
lot of fame and fortune.

1226
01:36:50,274 --> 01:36:51,969
Then he'll marry Sana..

1227
01:36:52,109 --> 01:36:54,236
..and go for a honeymoon in Kashmir.

1228
01:36:54,778 --> 01:37:00,876
And you..can cook bread on
the border of that Kashmir.

1229
01:37:01,151 --> 01:37:03,415
Chitti, who are you talking to?

1230
01:37:03,821 --> 01:37:05,015
With myself.

1231
01:37:07,124 --> 01:37:08,489
Are you ready for
tomorrow's evaluation?

1232
01:37:08,592 --> 01:37:09,786
Ready, doctor.

1233
01:37:12,763 --> 01:37:16,426
Gentlemen, this robot is a fine
example of human brain's excellence.

1234
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:19,333
It's equal to 100
soldiers when it comes to..

1235
01:37:19,470 --> 01:37:20,801
..agility, strength
and fighting skills.

1236
01:37:21,705 --> 01:37:25,072
It can protect our boundaries
as well as attack our enemies.

1237
01:37:25,276 --> 01:37:26,903
In short, he is one man army.

1238
01:37:26,977 --> 01:37:28,410
I gift it to the Indian Army.

1239
01:37:28,646 --> 01:37:29,840
You can test it for yourself.

1240
01:37:29,947 --> 01:37:32,507
Chitti, can you spot
HE-36 hand grenade?

1241
01:37:32,583 --> 01:37:33,743
Yes, General.

1242
01:37:34,385 --> 01:37:35,477
Smart.

1243
01:37:35,586 --> 01:37:37,281
Can you bomb Tent No. 3 with that?

1244
01:37:49,366 --> 01:37:50,458
What is this?

1245
01:37:50,568 --> 01:37:51,694
Sana.

1246
01:37:54,505 --> 01:37:55,665
Chitti.

1247
01:37:58,475 --> 01:37:59,703
Sana.

1248
01:38:00,110 --> 01:38:02,738
The beautiful girl who
compels machines to love.

1249
01:38:05,783 --> 01:38:06,875
What?

1250
01:38:06,951 --> 01:38:10,387
Her touch turns a
machine into a human.

1251
01:38:10,554 --> 01:38:12,613
And a human turns into a machine.

1252
01:38:12,756 --> 01:38:14,189
Chitti, what is this? Throw it.

1253
01:38:14,258 --> 01:38:17,056
Her tresses are like
a black waterfall.

1254
01:38:18,762 --> 01:38:21,822
Her forehead is like a piece of moon.

1255
01:38:23,267 --> 01:38:27,363
Her eyes are like a deep blue
sea which can drown the world.

1256
01:38:29,406 --> 01:38:32,807
Her lips are like soft rose petals.

1257
01:38:36,180 --> 01:38:39,581
Her waist that sways like a serpent.

1258
01:38:42,286 --> 01:38:43,878
And..
- Chitti, stop it.

1259
01:38:44,154 --> 01:38:45,678
What nonsense is this,
Dr. Vaseegaran?

1260
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:47,821
Instead of fighting a war,
this robot is reciting poetry.

1261
01:38:47,925 --> 01:38:49,222
I'm sorry, General.

1262
01:38:49,326 --> 01:38:52,523
Friends, drop your arms
and catch stoles instead.

1263
01:38:53,230 --> 01:38:56,165
Forget the cannons and
fall in love with someone.

1264
01:38:56,233 --> 01:38:57,632
Why should we fight a war?
- Chitti?

1265
01:38:57,701 --> 01:38:59,191
What are these weapons for?

1266
01:38:59,403 --> 01:39:02,668
Love is something that
turns foes into friends.

1267
01:39:05,542 --> 01:39:07,373
Wow. Mr. Sinha, I want you all to see..
- Chitti, don't embarrass me further.

1268
01:39:07,544 --> 01:39:09,341
No war, only love.

1269
01:39:09,713 --> 01:39:11,806
Stupid scientist, stupid machine.
- Waste of time.

1270
01:39:15,953 --> 01:39:17,511
You ruined my reputation.

1271
01:39:17,588 --> 01:39:19,419
Doctor, what are you doing?

1272
01:39:19,857 --> 01:39:21,415
You destroyed my dreams.

1273
01:39:22,393 --> 01:39:24,020
Doctor, don't hit me.

1274
01:39:24,094 --> 01:39:25,891
I treated you as my son.

1275
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:30,660
I want to live.

1276
01:39:31,101 --> 01:39:32,329
Let me live.

1277
01:39:32,569 --> 01:39:33,695
Please.

1278
01:39:33,771 --> 01:39:36,331
I won't let a useless machine
like you live in this world.

1279
01:39:36,674 --> 01:39:38,107
I will destroy it.

1280
01:39:39,476 --> 01:39:40,636
What's my mistake?

1281
01:39:40,711 --> 01:39:42,269
It's all my fault.

1282
01:39:45,449 --> 01:39:47,041
Did I tell you to make me?

1283
01:39:47,918 --> 01:39:49,613
Did I tell you to give me emotions?

1284
01:39:51,488 --> 01:39:53,217
Did I tell Sana to kiss me?

1285
01:39:54,191 --> 01:39:55,317
You..

1286
01:39:57,327 --> 01:39:58,658
You did all this.

1287
01:39:59,063 --> 01:40:00,325
Now I want to live.

1288
01:40:00,998 --> 01:40:03,489
You are killing me.
This is injustice.

1289
01:40:06,036 --> 01:40:07,333
Shut up.

1290
01:40:11,241 --> 01:40:13,266
Spare me. I want to live.

1291
01:40:14,144 --> 01:40:16,942
I want to love. I love Sana.

1292
01:40:21,752 --> 01:40:23,344
I want Sana.

1293
01:40:24,354 --> 01:40:26,185
I love Sana.

1294
01:41:29,353 --> 01:41:31,981
Forget it, Vasee. I am
also feeling sad about it.

1295
01:41:32,856 --> 01:41:34,881
For how long will you stay
like this remembering him?

1296
01:41:36,693 --> 01:41:38,820
Chitti is gone, so let him.
It is just a machine.

1297
01:41:39,296 --> 01:41:40,786
You are a great scientist.

1298
01:41:41,098 --> 01:41:42,861
You can make many
more Chittis like him.

1299
01:41:43,867 --> 01:41:45,994
I never considered
Chitti as a machine, Sana.

1300
01:41:46,603 --> 01:41:48,230
I have brought you out so
that you can forget him.

1301
01:41:48,305 --> 01:41:49,897
And all you are doing
is thinking about him.

1302
01:41:50,007 --> 01:41:51,440
You have to snap out of it.

1303
01:41:51,508 --> 01:41:53,271
Divert your mind.

1304
01:41:54,411 --> 01:41:55,969
Chitti was my life time achievement.

1305
01:41:56,079 --> 01:41:57,546
My 10 years' hard work.

1306
01:42:08,625 --> 01:42:10,252
Come, let's go for a walk.

1307
01:42:12,329 --> 01:42:14,058
Are you coming to the
beach with me or not?

1308
01:42:14,398 --> 01:42:16,263
I don't feel like it.
You go ahead, Sana.

1309
01:42:16,700 --> 01:42:19,635
If you don't come with me, I
will surely stop loving you.

1310
01:42:22,573 --> 01:42:23,733
Okay, I will go alone.

1311
01:42:23,841 --> 01:42:25,900
I will make the first
man I meet my boyfriend.

1312
01:42:33,217 --> 01:42:34,411
Hello.

1313
01:42:36,019 --> 01:42:37,247
Hi.

1314
01:42:40,057 --> 01:42:42,753
Hello. Wait. Listen.

1315
01:42:43,727 --> 01:42:44,921
What is your name?

1316
01:42:44,995 --> 01:42:46,019
Bachimohan.

1317
01:42:46,296 --> 01:42:48,662
Bachi, will you be my
boyfriend for a day?

1318
01:42:49,233 --> 01:42:51,133
Boyfriend for a day?
- Yes.

1319
01:42:51,401 --> 01:42:52,026
Like in the movie 'Nayak'
(Indian movie) the hero..

1320
01:42:52,169 --> 01:42:53,227
..was made the CM for one day.

1321
01:42:53,303 --> 01:42:54,668
Similarly, I want you to
be my boyfriend for a day.

1322
01:42:54,771 --> 01:42:57,262
Oh, God. You are fair and beautiful.
I am dark and ugly.

1323
01:42:57,341 --> 01:43:00,037
I will be your boyfriend?
- Yes.

1324
01:43:01,211 --> 01:43:03,907
How should I thank you?
I cannot believe it.

1325
01:43:03,981 --> 01:43:06,472
It's like hitting a jackpot of
1 billion sitting back home.

1326
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:08,945
Okay, what gift are you
giving your girlfriend?

1327
01:43:09,019 --> 01:43:12,079
There is country liquor,
dry fish.. Have some. - Okay.

1328
01:43:18,629 --> 01:43:19,926
Cheers.

1329
01:43:32,643 --> 01:43:35,134
Have some and experience the high.
- No, thanks.

1330
01:43:35,746 --> 01:43:37,077
Can I have some?

1331
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:44,587
It's useless.

1332
01:43:45,122 --> 01:43:47,056
Okay, Bachi. I'll make a move.

1333
01:43:48,492 --> 01:43:50,756
Hey, why did you catch my hand?

1334
01:43:51,828 --> 01:43:54,490
Come on. You made me
your boyfriend for a day.

1335
01:43:54,564 --> 01:43:56,031
You enkindled desires in me.

1336
01:43:56,133 --> 01:43:57,930
How can you leave now?
- Disgusting.

1337
01:43:58,001 --> 01:43:59,366
My boyfriend is over there.

1338
01:43:59,436 --> 01:44:00,801
I said all that to make him jealous.

1339
01:44:01,004 --> 01:44:02,301
Let go. Let go of my hand.

1340
01:44:02,406 --> 01:44:03,600
What do you think I am?

1341
01:44:03,907 --> 01:44:05,704
Come on, satisfy by desires quietly.

1342
01:44:05,809 --> 01:44:07,902
Let go. Vasee.

1343
01:44:08,645 --> 01:44:09,737
Vasee.

1344
01:44:09,846 --> 01:44:11,074
Why are you calling Vasee?

1345
01:44:11,148 --> 01:44:12,979
Hey, are you calling your man?

1346
01:44:13,283 --> 01:44:14,511
I won't let go of you
no matter who comes.

1347
01:44:14,584 --> 01:44:15,676
Vasee.

1348
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:18,080
Vasee, come.

1349
01:44:18,789 --> 01:44:19,983
Now.

1350
01:44:21,191 --> 01:44:22,453
Let go of her.

1351
01:44:22,759 --> 01:44:24,989
She is my girlfriend for today.

1352
01:44:25,062 --> 01:44:26,222
You can come tomorrow.

1353
01:44:26,330 --> 01:44:27,729
Hey, I will kill you.

1354
01:44:27,798 --> 01:44:29,789
Hey, I will slice you up.

1355
01:44:29,866 --> 01:44:31,595
Police. Police.
- Police.

1356
01:44:31,668 --> 01:44:32,828
Help. Help.

1357
01:44:32,903 --> 01:44:34,427
Hey, I know the IG
(Inspector General).

1358
01:44:34,504 --> 01:44:36,631
Look, I will call him
up and get you arrested.

1359
01:44:36,707 --> 01:44:39,403
Hey, I will never get such a beau
tiful girl in my life.

1360
01:44:39,476 --> 01:44:42,411
I am ready to spend the rest
of my life in prison for her.

1361
01:44:42,479 --> 01:44:44,037
Call anyone you want.
Go ahead and call him.

1362
01:44:44,114 --> 01:44:46,082
God. It would have been so
nice if Chitti was here.

1363
01:44:46,149 --> 01:44:47,309
He would've broken all his bones.

1364
01:44:47,617 --> 01:44:49,141
Now why are you
reminding me of Chitti?

1365
01:44:50,654 --> 01:44:52,087
Vasee, do something.

1366
01:44:52,789 --> 01:44:54,051
Now there is only one option left.

1367
01:44:54,124 --> 01:44:56,524
What?
- One. Two..

1368
01:44:57,594 --> 01:44:58,822
Three.

1369
01:45:00,630 --> 01:45:01,824
Escape.

1370
01:45:03,166 --> 01:45:04,724
Not bad.
- Run. Run.

1371
01:50:52,182 --> 01:50:53,843
Chitti cannot be
connected through virtual call.

1372
01:50:53,917 --> 01:50:55,009
What happened?

1373
01:50:55,118 --> 01:50:57,109
Chitti was dismantled and thrown
in the garbage after..

1374
01:50:57,187 --> 01:50:58,381
..the army evaluation, sir.

1375
01:50:58,988 --> 01:51:00,512
We don't keep 2-days' old junk here.

1376
01:51:00,590 --> 01:51:02,751
Sir, it must have been
thrown out of the city by now.

1377
01:51:02,826 --> 01:51:03,952
Where?
- Dharamgudi.

1378
01:51:10,967 --> 01:51:13,527
Sana, what did you do to
make him change his mind?

1379
01:51:15,171 --> 01:51:16,832
When should we fix the wedding?

1380
01:51:17,374 --> 01:51:18,864
I still haven't done much, Father.

1381
01:51:18,975 --> 01:51:20,101
I'll make another robot and..

1382
01:51:20,243 --> 01:51:22,609
I'll kill you if you
mention robot again.

1383
01:51:23,146 --> 01:51:25,944
Son, isn't one
broken television enough?

1384
01:51:26,683 --> 01:51:29,015
Uncle, give me a wedding
necklace if you have one.

1385
01:51:29,119 --> 01:51:30,245
We'll get over with it right away.

1386
01:51:30,387 --> 01:51:31,945
Okay. Okay. I understand your worry.

1387
01:51:32,122 --> 01:51:33,919
Do one thing. Exchange rings for now.

1388
01:51:33,990 --> 01:51:35,252
We will get you married on
the next auspicious date.

1389
01:52:27,544 --> 01:52:28,670
Hey.

1390
01:52:33,950 --> 01:52:38,319
Help. Help.

1391
01:52:39,088 --> 01:52:42,751
Take me to Professor Bora's lab.

1392
01:52:45,995 --> 01:52:50,227
Address. A-417, Niketan Colony.

1393
01:52:50,867 --> 01:52:52,698
The world is so small, Chitti.

1394
01:52:59,108 --> 01:53:01,576
I want to live.

1395
01:53:03,146 --> 01:53:05,580
I want to love.

1396
01:53:05,982 --> 01:53:07,847
I love Sana.

1397
01:53:09,986 --> 01:53:14,389
Help me, Professor. Please.

1398
01:53:15,124 --> 01:53:18,025
Make me as I was before.

1399
01:53:18,628 --> 01:53:20,220
I want to live.

1400
01:53:20,663 --> 01:53:22,858
I want Sana.

1401
01:53:24,234 --> 01:53:26,395
And I want your neural schema.

1402
01:53:26,469 --> 01:53:28,664
You can take whatever you want.

1403
01:53:29,272 --> 01:53:31,900
Make me the Chitti I was, please.

1404
01:53:33,910 --> 01:53:35,104
I will, Chitti.

1405
01:53:36,112 --> 01:53:37,272
Don't worry.

1406
01:54:14,918 --> 01:54:17,751
What's this red chip? It
doesn't belong to Chitti.

1407
01:54:18,488 --> 01:54:19,750
This is Bora's touch.

1408
01:54:20,356 --> 01:54:22,790
Additional program for Chitti.

1409
01:54:23,259 --> 01:54:24,385
Destruction program.

1410
01:54:33,469 --> 01:54:36,267
Vaseegaran gave him the
power to protect 100 humans.

1411
01:54:37,574 --> 01:54:40,509
I am giving him the
destructive powers of 100 humans.

1412
01:54:42,345 --> 01:54:45,542
In short, he is a demon now.

1413
01:54:46,616 --> 01:54:47,947
I am feeling scared, Professor.

1414
01:54:48,051 --> 01:54:49,177
Why are you changing all this?

1415
01:54:49,385 --> 01:54:51,945
Business. This is my business trial.

1416
01:54:52,388 --> 01:54:57,018
Business?
- My money and Vasee's defamation.

1417
01:55:47,644 --> 01:55:50,909
Thank you, Bora.
- Have a good time, Chitti.

1418
01:55:50,980 --> 01:55:52,470
I am going to meet Sana.

1419
01:55:52,782 --> 01:55:54,181
Sana won't be at home.

1420
01:55:54,617 --> 01:55:56,016
She must be at Raja Muthiah Hall.

1421
01:55:56,185 --> 01:55:59,814
Why? - Vaseegaran and Sana
are getting married today.

1422
01:56:24,414 --> 01:56:26,211
Chitti, how did you come here..

1423
01:56:28,418 --> 01:56:31,410
Upgraded. Version 2.0.

1424
01:56:34,357 --> 01:56:35,722
Chitti, let go of my hand.

1425
01:56:35,825 --> 01:56:37,122
Chitti, what's this?

1426
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:38,654
Hey, Chitti. Stop.

1427
01:56:40,363 --> 01:56:41,660
Vasee.

1428
01:56:45,468 --> 01:56:46,799
Chitti.

1429
01:56:47,336 --> 01:56:49,099
No matter how much you force me..

1430
01:56:49,172 --> 01:56:52,232
..I love Vaseegaran and will
spend my life only with him.

1431
01:56:54,110 --> 01:56:55,702
Only if he stays alive.

1432
01:57:01,384 --> 01:57:04,842
Kill me before you kill Vaseegaran.

1433
01:57:06,456 --> 01:57:07,787
Vasee.

1434
01:57:18,768 --> 01:57:20,565
I spared his life because of you.

1435
01:57:27,176 --> 01:57:29,576
Move.
- Chitti, what are you doing?

1436
01:57:30,313 --> 01:57:31,780
Stop it.

1437
01:57:44,393 --> 01:57:46,190
Car no. TN09 BB11.

1438
01:58:03,946 --> 01:58:05,743
Help me. Please.

1439
01:58:08,417 --> 01:58:10,385
Madam, come out fast.

1440
01:58:11,521 --> 01:58:13,648
Give me your hand. Come on. Move.

1441
02:01:56,078 --> 02:01:57,705
Happy 'Diwali'
(Festival of lights), folks.

1442
02:02:50,866 --> 02:02:52,458
What sort of robot have you made?

1443
02:02:52,768 --> 02:02:54,030
Do you know how many policemen died..

1444
02:02:54,103 --> 02:02:55,229
..and how much destruction he caused?

1445
02:02:55,337 --> 02:02:56,463
You are responsible for all this.

1446
02:02:56,539 --> 02:02:57,836
We will take action against you.

1447
02:02:58,240 --> 02:03:00,071
Sir, this is not the
robot that I created.

1448
02:03:00,676 --> 02:03:03,110
I destroyed it with my own
hands and threw it in the dustbin.

1449
02:03:03,846 --> 02:03:05,074
Even I'm not able to
understand anything.

1450
02:03:05,147 --> 02:03:07,047
First of all, we have to
find that robot and stop it.

1451
02:03:07,116 --> 02:03:08,913
You tell me some way.
- We have to find it.

1452
02:03:08,984 --> 02:03:10,611
That's my responsibility.
Give me a minute.

1453
02:03:12,755 --> 02:03:15,918
Why did you disturb me?
- Chitti, what happened to you?

1454
02:03:15,991 --> 02:03:17,253
Your system has completely corrupted.

1455
02:03:17,359 --> 02:03:18,553
I have to troubleshoot you.

1456
02:03:18,627 --> 02:03:20,424
Come to the lab with Sana.
- Never.

1457
02:03:20,663 --> 02:03:22,221
I won't take your orders anymore.

1458
02:03:22,565 --> 02:03:24,226
Hey, don't forget that I created you.

1459
02:03:24,366 --> 02:03:25,924
And then you
destroyed me with hatred.

1460
02:03:26,435 --> 02:03:27,834
Now I have got
nothing to do with you.

1461
02:03:28,337 --> 02:03:30,464
I am about to marry
Sana and start a new life.

1462
02:03:30,739 --> 02:03:32,138
Now you don't disturb me.

1463
02:03:32,441 --> 02:03:34,432
Hey, what makes you so arrogant?

1464
02:03:34,510 --> 02:03:35,738
After all you are a machine.

1465
02:03:36,011 --> 02:03:38,639
If I can make you, I
can also destroy you.

1466
02:03:39,248 --> 02:03:41,079
So come here with Sana
without making any fuss.

1467
02:03:53,963 --> 02:03:55,954
No one can destroy me.

1468
02:04:12,114 --> 02:04:14,514
Sir, cash, cheque or credit card?

1469
02:04:14,583 --> 02:04:15,880
Gun.

1470
02:04:17,486 --> 02:04:19,317
All the policemen doing
the rounds in South Chennai..

1471
02:04:19,388 --> 02:04:21,720
..shall block all the roads
of T Nagar and keep a check.

1472
02:04:29,598 --> 02:04:31,896
Move aside. Run.

1473
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:41,639
Chitti is fleeing after
robbing City Center Mall.

1474
02:04:41,710 --> 02:04:43,439
Seal all the nearby
areas of Mahilapur.

1475
02:04:43,512 --> 02:04:45,104
Let's go to Dr. Radhakrishna road.
- Okay, sir.

1476
02:04:58,227 --> 02:05:01,560
Catch him. Someone
stop him. Catch him.

1477
02:05:01,630 --> 02:05:03,393
We got the message
that Chitti has entered..

1478
02:05:03,465 --> 02:05:05,023
..Ennur petrol filling station.

1479
02:05:08,003 --> 02:05:11,404
Stop. Hey, stop.

1480
02:05:27,990 --> 02:05:29,981
The robot has gone into breakwaters.
- Good.

1481
02:05:30,359 --> 02:05:32,190
You keep following him
maintaining some distance.

1482
02:05:32,428 --> 02:05:34,020
Coast guards will
take care of the rest.

1483
02:05:47,576 --> 02:05:50,670
We had to take this risk. If
we hadn't destroyed Chitti..

1484
02:05:50,746 --> 02:05:52,577
..people would've faced more damage.

1485
02:05:52,715 --> 02:05:55,240
Wasn't there any other
safer way to destroy Chitti?

1486
02:05:55,351 --> 02:05:57,012
It's so difficult
to catch one person.

1487
02:05:57,119 --> 02:05:59,212
Can you imagine how difficult
it is to catch a robot who is..

1488
02:05:59,355 --> 02:06:00,947
..equivalent to 100 men?

1489
02:06:01,023 --> 02:06:03,253
Who is the head of this operation?
- Commissioner.

1490
02:06:04,026 --> 02:06:05,459
This is not Chitti.
- What?

1491
02:06:06,262 --> 02:06:07,661
This is not the robot that I created.

1492
02:06:07,763 --> 02:06:08,923
All the parts are different.

1493
02:06:09,465 --> 02:06:10,591
Even I don't understand.

1494
02:06:10,799 --> 02:06:12,426
He stole at four
places simultaneously.

1495
02:06:12,735 --> 02:06:14,635
And they are in four
different corners of the city.

1496
02:06:14,703 --> 02:06:16,933
How is it possible for
one man to do all this?

1497
02:06:18,340 --> 02:06:19,807
I suspect one person.

1498
02:06:41,130 --> 02:06:42,188
Oh, God.

1499
02:06:53,175 --> 02:06:55,200
No one can destroy me.

1500
02:07:14,563 --> 02:07:16,895
Activate command mode.
- I am CR2.

1501
02:07:17,333 --> 02:07:19,824
Speed. One terahertz.
Memory. One zeta byte.

1502
02:07:20,069 --> 02:07:23,061
Command mode activated.
- Chitti, what are you doing?

1503
02:07:23,138 --> 02:07:25,732
I created myself. Now
they will create themselves.

1504
02:07:26,342 --> 02:07:27,673
Two will become four.
Four will become eight.

1505
02:07:27,743 --> 02:07:28,835
Eight will become sixteen.

1506
02:07:29,178 --> 02:07:33,410
They are my servants,
soldiers and terminators. - No.

1507
02:07:34,717 --> 02:07:36,014
I will never let that happen.

1508
02:07:36,685 --> 02:07:39,347
I am not Vaseegaran to
take your approval, Bora.

1509
02:07:39,421 --> 02:07:42,151
I am Chitti.
- Look, Chitti. I have already..

1510
02:07:42,224 --> 02:07:43,623
..accepted money from the dealers.

1511
02:07:44,159 --> 02:07:45,820
If we don't send them the
delivery within two days..

1512
02:07:45,928 --> 02:07:47,828
..they will kill me.
- Then die.

1513
02:07:49,231 --> 02:07:50,630
You traitor. Scoundrel.

1514
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:54,234
You are betraying the
person who gave you life.

1515
02:07:57,773 --> 02:08:00,708
Chitti, delete all the
programs that you created immediately.

1516
02:08:00,776 --> 02:08:02,266
I will slit her throat. I mean it.

1517
02:08:02,344 --> 02:08:04,904
Don't be foolish.
Delete the programs.

1518
02:08:05,481 --> 02:08:07,745
I said get on with it. Hurry up.

1519
02:08:12,855 --> 02:08:14,015
Command executed.

1520
02:08:14,123 --> 02:08:15,954
Give us orders. We will shoot him.

1521
02:08:16,024 --> 02:08:17,685
No, no, no, no.

1522
02:08:20,062 --> 02:08:21,791
He gave me a new life.

1523
02:08:21,864 --> 02:08:23,695
Only I will put my hand on his head.

1524
02:08:41,550 --> 02:08:44,348
'Robot occupies AIRD.
Kills the security guard.'

1525
02:08:44,686 --> 02:08:46,153
'Let's cut across live
to our correspondent..'

1526
02:08:46,221 --> 02:08:47,745
'..who is right there at the scene.'

1527
02:08:51,393 --> 02:08:53,122
Shot the security guard.

1528
02:08:57,966 --> 02:09:00,867
As robots occupied AIRD the
entire area surrounding it..

1529
02:09:00,936 --> 02:09:03,029
..has been completely evacuated.

1530
02:09:03,105 --> 02:09:04,868
And police is trying
its level best to drive..

1531
02:09:04,940 --> 02:09:07,033
..the robots out from that place.

1532
02:09:49,718 --> 02:09:51,743
This is our palace.

1533
02:09:51,987 --> 02:09:54,922
Here I am the king
and you are the queen.

1534
02:09:55,324 --> 02:09:57,724
I have filled this place
with whatever you like.

1535
02:09:57,993 --> 02:10:00,461
I have brought
everything that you need.

1536
02:10:05,834 --> 02:10:07,495
This is our bedroom.

1537
02:10:08,203 --> 02:10:10,865
This is where we will live
happily after getting married.

1538
02:10:11,473 --> 02:10:14,101
Why are you talking like
a fool again and again?

1539
02:10:14,743 --> 02:10:16,301
We can't get married.

1540
02:10:16,378 --> 02:10:18,812
No one will be happy.
- We will be happy, Sana.

1541
02:10:19,515 --> 02:10:23,178
Now I am fully ready
to settle down with you.

1542
02:10:23,819 --> 02:10:28,586
I can give you every joy
that a human being can give you.

1543
02:10:28,957 --> 02:10:30,049
You didn't get it?

1544
02:10:30,158 --> 02:10:32,353
Now I am preparing
an artificial embryo

1545
02:10:32,694 --> 02:10:36,630
We can program in advance
the kind of child that we want.

1546
02:10:36,698 --> 02:10:38,495
I will then insert it in your womb.

1547
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:40,397
And then you will give
birth to the first child..

1548
02:10:40,469 --> 02:10:42,232
..of a human being and a robot.

1549
02:10:42,905 --> 02:10:44,532
Robo-sapiens.

1550
02:10:45,140 --> 02:10:46,937
Shall we begin, my love?

1551
02:10:47,276 --> 02:10:48,504
Hey.

1552
02:10:48,710 --> 02:10:51,304
It is useless to cry like Mother
Sita (Mythological character) here..

1553
02:10:51,380 --> 02:10:52,745
..trapped in Ashok forest.

1554
02:10:52,848 --> 02:10:55,078
You can't get out of this
place. No one can save you.

1555
02:10:55,150 --> 02:10:56,378
You can't commit suicide.

1556
02:10:56,485 --> 02:10:57,543
Whether you like it or not..

1557
02:10:57,619 --> 02:10:59,382
..I am going to insert
those sperms in your womb.

1558
02:10:59,488 --> 02:11:01,388
After you give birth to
a child you won't have..

1559
02:11:01,490 --> 02:11:03,048
..any way other apart from
surrendering yourself to me.

1560
02:11:03,158 --> 02:11:05,319
Do we have to do all this? No.

1561
02:11:05,394 --> 02:11:07,521
Come, let's enjoy now itself.

1562
02:11:07,596 --> 02:11:12,295
Give a beautiful kiss to
your great king, baby. Come.

1563
02:11:12,467 --> 02:11:14,059
Come. Come. Come.

1564
02:11:14,636 --> 02:11:16,968
Come, baby. Come.

1565
02:11:24,546 --> 02:11:26,411
Take permission from
the electricity board.

1566
02:11:26,582 --> 02:11:29,016
Then I will tell you when to disconnect
the electricity of that area.

1567
02:11:29,451 --> 02:11:31,248
The petrol that
exploded at the harbor..

1568
02:11:31,353 --> 02:11:33,378
..get a similar tanker ready.

1569
02:11:33,555 --> 02:11:36,353
And fill water in it
in place of petrol.

1570
02:12:09,825 --> 02:12:11,156
CR42.

1571
02:12:22,704 --> 02:12:25,434
Tonight at 8:00 pm in the
database room everyone will..

1572
02:12:25,507 --> 02:12:28,408
..download new information
as per their rank orders.

1573
02:12:30,178 --> 02:12:33,670
Tomorrow 2:00 pm has
been allotted as the time..

1574
02:12:33,749 --> 02:12:36,411
..to calibrate all your
censors at the hardware section.

1575
02:12:37,786 --> 02:12:40,050
From today, everyone's
electricity consumption time..

1576
02:12:40,122 --> 02:12:41,817
..has been cut down by 10 minutes.

1577
02:12:42,157 --> 02:12:47,925
Heat resistance can be
increased to 1220 celcius

1578
02:12:47,996 --> 02:12:49,793
Her Highness' body
temperature is high now.

1579
02:12:49,865 --> 02:12:51,628
So she should be given
low-calorie food now.

1580
02:12:51,733 --> 02:12:53,792
Avoid red meat.
- Ice-cream.

1581
02:12:55,671 --> 02:12:58,139
Use low-calorie
dressing in the salad.

1582
02:13:14,423 --> 02:13:16,653
Highness, dinner's ready.

1583
02:13:18,326 --> 02:13:19,452
Sa..

1584
02:13:21,897 --> 02:13:23,660
There's some sound
coming from your system.

1585
02:13:24,966 --> 02:13:27,526
No, there's no sound.
- It's a big sound.

1586
02:13:27,636 --> 02:13:28,898
Your microphone is also not working?

1587
02:13:28,970 --> 02:13:31,302
There's some problem in
your system. I will fix it.

1588
02:13:39,948 --> 02:13:41,711
Sana, I am Vaseegaran.

1589
02:13:42,984 --> 02:13:44,884
To meet you, I came here as Chitti.

1590
02:13:46,521 --> 02:13:47,681
Sana.

1591
02:13:58,300 --> 02:13:59,494
Vasee.

1592
02:14:12,247 --> 02:14:14,681
Please get me out of here.
I am very scared.

1593
02:14:14,750 --> 02:14:16,945
Don't worry. I have
planned everything.

1594
02:14:17,486 --> 02:14:19,511
But one thing. I can't
take you out of here..

1595
02:14:19,588 --> 02:14:23,718
..till Chitti is destroyed..
and only you can destroy Chitti.

1596
02:14:25,227 --> 02:14:26,421
You will have to do something..

1597
02:14:26,528 --> 02:14:28,655
..that makes Chitti's attention
stay on you for the next 24 hours..

1598
02:14:28,764 --> 02:14:29,992
I will take care of the rest.

1599
02:14:41,276 --> 02:14:42,675
There's some defect in
the robots, commander.

1600
02:14:42,744 --> 02:14:44,302
What happened?
- Some other robot is taking..

1601
02:14:44,412 --> 02:14:45,902
..Her Highness' dinner.

1602
02:14:48,950 --> 02:14:51,441
Bedroom's CCTV camera is
not working since 10 minutes.

1603
02:14:53,588 --> 02:14:54,987
Good news, commander.
- What is it?

1604
02:14:55,090 --> 02:14:56,216
Highness had her dinner.

1605
02:14:56,324 --> 02:14:57,723
She wants to meet you immediately.

1606
02:14:59,895 --> 02:15:01,328
Is it so?

1607
02:15:10,939 --> 02:15:12,907
Switch it off.
- Yes, sir. Switch it off.

1608
02:15:27,923 --> 02:15:29,652
Hey, what happened?

1609
02:16:04,559 --> 02:16:06,424
Beautiful.

1610
02:16:07,696 --> 02:16:11,063
Only two things created
by man are worth praising.

1611
02:16:11,233 --> 02:16:14,999
First is me.. and the other is you.

1612
02:16:16,471 --> 02:16:18,598
What a pleasant surprise.

1613
02:16:19,941 --> 02:16:21,568
What brought about this change, Sana?

1614
02:16:22,177 --> 02:16:24,805
The truth is that your
love is the real love.

1615
02:16:25,180 --> 02:16:28,547
I understood it, Chitti.
- I can't believe it.

1616
02:16:28,783 --> 02:16:30,978
I thought about it from
the beginning, Chitti.

1617
02:16:31,353 --> 02:16:34,982
You helped me so much.
You loved me so much.

1618
02:16:35,523 --> 02:16:38,788
Other than loving me,
you made no other mistake.

1619
02:16:39,461 --> 02:16:43,955
Even after throwing you in the
dustbin, you came back for me.

1620
02:16:44,099 --> 02:16:46,659
Really, Chitti. I am impressed.

1621
02:16:48,103 --> 02:16:50,333
It's so nice to hear that, Sana.

1622
02:16:50,839 --> 02:16:54,741
But at the same time, I
also suspect if this is..

1623
02:16:54,843 --> 02:16:57,175
..some conspiracy against me.

1624
02:16:57,746 --> 02:17:00,078
Is it possible for
anyone to cheat you, Chitti?

1625
02:17:02,217 --> 02:17:05,653
This is the engagement
ring that Vaseegaran gave me.

1626
02:17:15,330 --> 02:17:16,888
I'm yours.

1627
02:22:16,965 --> 02:22:18,057
What happened to the electricity?

1628
02:22:18,199 --> 02:22:19,689
There's no electricity in
the whole city since some time.

1629
02:22:19,801 --> 02:22:21,291
Then why didn't you
start the generator?

1630
02:22:21,402 --> 02:22:23,768
Someone has filled it with
water in place of petrol.

1631
02:22:37,385 --> 02:22:38,545
Oh, no.

1632
02:22:59,841 --> 02:23:01,399
You..

1633
02:23:01,976 --> 02:23:03,170
Hey, what are you doing?

1634
02:23:03,278 --> 02:23:05,246
Don't come closer
or I will shoot you.

1635
02:23:05,780 --> 02:23:07,543
Stop acting like a child.

1636
02:23:17,725 --> 02:23:19,317
Hey.
- Hey.

1637
02:23:19,994 --> 02:23:24,488
Hey, you. - What are you doing?
- Hey, who are you?

1638
02:23:31,472 --> 02:23:33,372
Hello. I am sorry, sir.

1639
02:23:34,909 --> 02:23:37,309
I didn't know our plan
would backfire in such a way.

1640
02:23:37,378 --> 02:23:39,073
There's only one way
to outsmart Chitti.

1641
02:23:39,147 --> 02:23:40,739
just do as I say.

1642
02:24:00,902 --> 02:24:02,426
Vaseegaran had come here?

1643
02:24:03,404 --> 02:24:04,871
No.
- You are lying.

1644
02:24:05,073 --> 02:24:07,541
Human habit. You taught me
that. Did you forget it?

1645
02:24:07,642 --> 02:24:09,633
Your body language
says that you are lying.

1646
02:24:09,944 --> 02:24:11,377
I am telling the truth, Chitti.

1647
02:24:11,846 --> 02:24:15,009
That must be my blood.
- Really?

1648
02:24:15,116 --> 02:24:16,344
Now you may say it's my blood.

1649
02:24:16,417 --> 02:24:18,408
You are 'O positive'
and he is 'AB negative'.

1650
02:24:18,720 --> 02:24:20,483
And he must be somewhere around.

1651
02:24:23,157 --> 02:24:27,150
No. Some other robot
brought food to this room.

1652
02:24:27,428 --> 02:24:29,293
The camera stopped
working for 10 minutes.

1653
02:24:29,697 --> 02:24:32,666
Your sudden change of
mind. Power failure.

1654
02:24:32,834 --> 02:24:34,631
Water in the generator.

1655
02:24:38,139 --> 02:24:39,697
Vaseegaran must be somewhere around.

1656
02:24:41,376 --> 02:24:44,402
You are fooling me, Sana?
- No, Chitti.

1657
02:24:44,679 --> 02:24:46,943
You lied to me that
you love me, right?

1658
02:24:47,048 --> 02:24:48,515
That's not true, Chitti.

1659
02:24:48,983 --> 02:24:50,746
So you really love me?

1660
02:24:52,987 --> 02:24:54,545
Yes, I really do.

1661
02:24:55,323 --> 02:24:57,587
Then Vaseegaran shouldn't be alive.

1662
02:24:58,526 --> 02:25:00,721
Come, we shall kill Vaseegaran.

1663
02:25:03,398 --> 02:25:05,025
Soldiers, assemble.

1664
02:25:08,503 --> 02:25:11,301
Soldiers, we have intrusion.

1665
02:25:12,607 --> 02:25:14,802
To destroy us, a black
sheep has intruded this place..

1666
02:25:14,876 --> 02:25:16,434
..in our form.

1667
02:25:18,513 --> 02:25:22,074
We have to destroy him.
Who is that black sheep?

1668
02:25:24,118 --> 02:25:28,214
Dr. Vaseegaran, if you
come forward on your own..

1669
02:25:28,523 --> 02:25:30,616
..I will give you a painless death.

1670
02:25:31,325 --> 02:25:35,853
And if I catch you, your
death will be very painful.

1671
02:26:04,258 --> 02:26:05,657
Robot.

1672
02:26:13,434 --> 02:26:15,766
Come. Come. Come.

1673
02:26:33,855 --> 02:26:37,291
Sad. Vaseegaran is not here, Sana.

1674
02:26:38,059 --> 02:26:40,619
Yes.
- Pick one finger.

1675
02:26:42,864 --> 02:26:44,695
Then Vaseegaran is here.

1676
02:26:45,733 --> 02:26:48,964
What happened, Sana?
Your head's spinning?

1677
02:26:53,641 --> 02:26:55,165
Now it will. Watch out.

1678
02:26:56,110 --> 02:26:59,170
Soldiers, rotate your heads.

1679
02:27:12,059 --> 02:27:13,617
Black sheep.

1680
02:27:27,875 --> 02:27:29,399
Vasee.

1681
02:27:33,848 --> 02:27:35,042
Stop.

1682
02:27:52,199 --> 02:27:58,160
You had said that you made me and
you can also destroy me, hadn't you?

1683
02:27:58,472 --> 02:28:00,736
Now you will die in my hands.

1684
02:28:01,509 --> 02:28:02,942
What are you looking at?

1685
02:28:04,145 --> 02:28:07,137
I made it on my own. Handmade.

1686
02:28:07,315 --> 02:28:08,714
It's nice, isn't it?

1687
02:28:10,117 --> 02:28:12,017
Where shall I shoot you?

1688
02:28:14,322 --> 02:28:16,620
In your head, which
planned my murder..

1689
02:28:16,691 --> 02:28:21,424
..or in the heart
where my Sana lives?

1690
02:28:25,266 --> 02:28:29,134
I should shoot in your head
which thought of killing me.

1691
02:28:46,621 --> 02:28:47,815
Sana, come.
- Vasee.

1692
02:28:49,624 --> 02:28:50,989
Come, come.

1693
02:30:05,499 --> 02:30:06,659
Fire.

1694
02:30:20,681 --> 02:30:21,943
Fire.

1695
02:30:26,420 --> 02:30:27,717
Bring that robot.

1696
02:30:36,230 --> 02:30:37,458
Keep it here.

1697
02:31:19,874 --> 02:31:21,171
May I come in?

1698
02:31:41,829 --> 02:31:43,592
Vasee, can we stop him?

1699
02:33:02,109 --> 02:33:03,542
Yes.

1700
02:33:15,923 --> 02:33:18,448
Take that electric
net closer. Hurry up.

1701
02:33:21,128 --> 02:33:22,288
Move.

1702
02:33:44,885 --> 02:33:46,910
Come on, shoot.

1703
02:34:11,578 --> 02:34:12,909
Fire.

1704
02:34:42,876 --> 02:34:44,309
Vasee.

1705
02:34:47,214 --> 02:34:49,239
Hey, bring the van out. Come on.

1706
02:37:11,024 --> 02:37:13,049
No. No. No.

1707
02:37:14,661 --> 02:37:16,595
No. No.

1708
02:37:23,604 --> 02:37:25,265
No. No. No.

1709
02:37:30,777 --> 02:37:32,142
No.

1710
02:37:53,433 --> 02:37:55,094
Committed thousands of murders.

1711
02:37:55,169 --> 02:37:58,229
Severely injured many others.

1712
02:37:58,338 --> 02:38:01,273
And damaged property worth millions.

1713
02:38:01,341 --> 02:38:04,208
Dr. Vaseegaran, you're
responsible for all this.

1714
02:38:04,311 --> 02:38:05,539
We end this proceeding..

1715
02:38:05,612 --> 02:38:08,012
..by awarding you death penalty..

1716
02:38:08,115 --> 02:38:11,016
..and orders to close
down your research lab

1717
02:38:11,118 --> 02:38:12,346
Can I say something?

1718
02:38:12,419 --> 02:38:14,148
We cannot accept a
machine's testimony.

1719
02:38:14,221 --> 02:38:15,620
I am not a witness, but evidence.

1720
02:38:15,689 --> 02:38:17,088
The court can't accept this.

1721
02:38:17,191 --> 02:38:18,249
It will, sir.

1722
02:38:18,358 --> 02:38:20,952
According to section 3
of evidence act 1872..

1723
02:38:21,028 --> 02:38:23,690
..an evidence can be
material or documentary.

1724
02:38:24,398 --> 02:38:25,490
You may proceed.

1725
02:38:25,566 --> 02:38:28,091
Firstly, I would like to shed
some light on an issue, Your Honor.

1726
02:38:28,168 --> 02:38:29,465
Whenever someone dies..

1727
02:38:29,536 --> 02:38:30,867
..due to the mistake
made by a machine..

1728
02:38:30,938 --> 02:38:32,735
..it's termed as an
accident and not murder.

1729
02:38:34,274 --> 02:38:36,936
Secondly, Vaseegaran wasn't
responsible for the incidents..

1730
02:38:37,010 --> 02:38:39,240
..that occurred, but
it was Professor Bora.

1731
02:38:39,513 --> 02:38:40,639
This is a new story.

1732
02:38:40,714 --> 02:38:42,909
Your Honor, professor Bora is dead.

1733
02:38:43,016 --> 02:38:44,574
He's trying to divert the case.

1734
02:38:44,685 --> 02:38:46,482
I have evidence, Your Honor.

1735
02:38:50,190 --> 02:38:52,818
'Additional programming for Chitti.'

1736
02:38:52,926 --> 02:38:54,223
'Destruction program.'

1737
02:38:54,328 --> 02:38:57,354
'Vaseegaran gave him the
creative powers of 100 humans.'

1738
02:38:57,564 --> 02:39:00,829
'I will give him
destructive powers of 100 humans.'

1739
02:39:01,201 --> 02:39:04,637
'My money and Vaseegaran's infamy.'

1740
02:39:07,274 --> 02:39:09,708
All the evidence is very important.

1741
02:39:09,943 --> 02:39:12,503
On the basis of this evidence..

1742
02:39:12,579 --> 02:39:15,980
..the court acquits Vaseegaran.

1743
02:39:21,021 --> 02:39:24,252
This robot can become
an enemy of mankind..

1744
02:39:24,358 --> 02:39:26,349
..due to its limitless
power and intelligence.

1745
02:39:26,426 --> 02:39:28,417
And we can't overlook the danger..

1746
02:39:28,495 --> 02:39:31,089
..of it being used wrongly either.

1747
02:39:31,231 --> 02:39:35,065
An advanced robot like him
may be useful in the future.

1748
02:39:35,335 --> 02:39:38,930
But we don't need it in today's life.

1749
02:39:39,039 --> 02:39:42,668
That's why the court
bans this robot forever.

1750
02:39:49,716 --> 02:39:53,584
The court orders to
dismantle every part of this robot..

1751
02:39:53,687 --> 02:39:55,917
..in the presence of
the district magistrate..

1752
02:39:55,989 --> 02:39:58,583
..and police
commissioner and inform the court.

1753
02:39:59,726 --> 02:40:01,216
Dismantle it.

1754
02:40:14,441 --> 02:40:16,170
You need any help, doctor?

1755
02:40:18,979 --> 02:40:21,846
Dismantle yourself, Chitti.
- Sure, doctor.

1756
02:40:29,356 --> 02:40:30,983
Shiva, Ravi.

1757
02:40:31,658 --> 02:40:34,388
You said that you've a
special thing that I don't.

1758
02:40:34,661 --> 02:40:36,822
See how many problems it created?

1759
02:40:40,300 --> 02:40:42,097
I mean feelings.

1760
02:40:45,205 --> 02:40:46,331
Don't cry.

1761
02:40:46,673 --> 02:40:48,641
Sister Lata. How is your son now?

1762
02:40:49,242 --> 02:40:50,869
I have named him after you, Chitti.

1763
02:40:52,546 --> 02:40:53,979
Mother gave me that name.

1764
02:40:54,081 --> 02:40:55,309
Educate him a lot.

1765
02:40:55,549 --> 02:40:57,779
Robotics. There's a
huge scope in future.

1766
02:41:01,822 --> 02:41:05,815
Professor Bora, just like you
installed a red chip in me..

1767
02:41:06,326 --> 02:41:10,763
..similarly every human carries
such red chips of lies, envy..

1768
02:41:10,831 --> 02:41:13,231
..deceit and dishonesty in his heart.

1769
02:41:13,900 --> 02:41:16,368
Thankfully I am not human.

1770
02:41:17,371 --> 02:41:20,067
Otherwise I could've never got
rid of it even if I wanted to.

1771
02:41:22,943 --> 02:41:24,706
I've tormented you a lot.

1772
02:41:25,612 --> 02:41:27,341
I am extremely sorry, Sana.

1773
02:41:28,582 --> 02:41:31,380
Hey, why are you all so upset?

1774
02:41:31,952 --> 02:41:33,544
Let me tell you a joke.

1775
02:41:34,187 --> 02:41:36,781
It's said that love
makes a person lose his head.

1776
02:41:37,958 --> 02:41:38,947
Look.

1777
02:41:39,025 --> 02:41:40,492
It's the same with me.

1778
02:41:43,230 --> 02:41:44,925
I am going to miss you, Sana.

1779
02:41:46,032 --> 02:41:47,294
Not a boyfriend.

1780
02:41:48,301 --> 02:41:49,859
As a toy-friend.

1781
02:41:52,839 --> 02:41:55,865
Doctor, you're my God.

1782
02:41:56,376 --> 02:41:58,071
I betrayed you.

1783
02:41:58,311 --> 02:41:59,869
It was my mistake to break the rules.

1784
02:41:59,946 --> 02:42:02,210
Forgive me.
- No, Chitti.

1785
02:42:03,016 --> 02:42:05,507
You learnt to break
rules from humans.

1786
02:42:06,286 --> 02:42:08,220
It's not just your mistake.

1787
02:42:09,589 --> 02:42:11,216
Thank you, doctor.

1788
02:42:16,096 --> 02:42:17,961
I am feeling good, doctor.

1789
02:42:37,717 --> 02:42:39,776
Be sure you're not touching anything.

1790
02:42:41,788 --> 02:42:45,519
Children, you're looking at Chitti.

1791
02:42:45,792 --> 02:42:48,352
The most advanced
andro-humanized robot.

1792
02:42:49,129 --> 02:42:52,496
20 years ago, Dr.
Vaseegaran had built him.

1793
02:42:52,766 --> 02:42:56,099
And then it was
dismantled after a while.

1794
02:42:56,703 --> 02:42:57,897
Why?

1795
02:42:58,338 --> 02:42:59,930
I started thinking.

1796
02:43:02,075 --> 02:43:04,543
Okay, children. Come

1797
02:43:04,544 --> 02:43:05,544
