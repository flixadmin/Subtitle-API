1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,929
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,771
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,447
<i>I returned home with only
one goal, to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,604
<i>But my old approach wasn't enough.</i>

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,524
<i>I had to become someone else.</i>

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,127
<i>I had to become something else.</i>

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,127
<i>I had to become the Green Arrow.</i>

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,410
Previously on Arrow...

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,887
<i>So, when 're you gonna pop the question?</i>

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,360
<i>O LIVE RI Tonight.</i>

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,769
This is a map of Lian Yu.

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,884
And I think that it leads to
whatever Reiter is looking for.

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,127
To get there I'll need your help.

14
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,090
The restoration of Starling Bay.
Leave the Bay as it is.

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,441
What if I refuse?

16
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,291
The fight to save Star City isn't
gonna be fought in the shadows.

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,771
It's gonna be fought in the light of day.

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,961
And I promise you,

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,487
that I will never stop fighting
to save this city.

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,928
<i>There was a time
I would've thought this was my fault.</i>

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,487
<i>It's not my fault. It's my responsibility.</i>

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,486
<i>Ollie?</i>

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,405
Hey. How we doing?

24
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,001
It's actually a pretty great turnout.

25
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,970
<i>Who knew people would
rather pick up garbage</i>

26
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,286
than celebrate the holidays, huh?

27
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,721
Not bad for a hippie-crunchy
campaign proposal, huh?

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,450
Nobody likes an "I told you so."

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,405
Except apparently Star City.
Your approval rating is up 10 points.

30
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,847
- I have an approval rating.
- Yes. Yes, you do.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,604
Welcome to politics, Mr. Queen.

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,321
- Mr. Queen.
- Yes! Excuse Me.

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,284
How do you feel about inspiring
so many people to come out here today?

34
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,330
Oh... I didn't inspire anyone.

35
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,171
This is the city that I know,
it's the city I remembered,

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,011
- and it's the city that we can be again.
- Nice. Thank you for your time.

37
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,009
- Thank you.
- Nice line.

38
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,685
Did you give him that one?

39
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,611
I might've given a note or two.

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,490
<i>Well,
you have people picking up garbage</i>

41
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,920
when they should be picking up presents.

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,681
<i>- You missed your calling.
- How are you doing?</i>

43
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,963
I have my brother home with me
for the holidays, Oliver.

44
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,200
He's in a cage...

45
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,841
But he's here.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,128
We're gonna get Andy out
from under Darhk's influence, John.

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,010
That is a promise.

48
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,884
If we can reduce just 40%
of the toxicity that's produced

49
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,731
by the bacterial microorganisms
that have just sprung up here...

50
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,291
We can swim in just 12 more days

51
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,000
- if the restitution rate stays consistent.
- Yes.

52
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,124
- She's like a mini-you. That's so cute.
- That's awesome.

53
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,006
Everybody get down!

54
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,643
Go! Go! Go! Go! Take cover!

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,330
Let's go! Let's go! Get down!

56
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,889
I think I can power
the drones down remotely!

57
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,406
I think now would be a good time for that.

58
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,846
GO! Go!

59
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,640
Hurry!

60
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,571
Hurry up! Everybody get down!

61
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,086
You all right?

62
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,285
<i>A day of hope for a better tomorrow
has turned into another day of despair</i>

63
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,607
<i>for Star City.</i>

64
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,969
<i>A terrorist attack has left
dozens in critical condition</i>

65
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,122
<i>after people showed up
to help Oliver Queen</i>

66
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,806
<i>and his campaign staff
clean up the Star City Bay.</i>

67
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,090
<i>In the meantime, SCPD
and national authorities</i>

68
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,362
<i>are searching for
the individuals responsible,</i>

69
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,801
<i>but so far, there are no suspects.</i>

70
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,126
Any news on the victims?

71
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,488
Some are being released.
Some are still in surgery.

72
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,484
- It's a miracle that no one died.
- Despite Darhk's best efforts.

73
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,728
Are we sure that this was HIVE?

74
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,124
Yeah, that's what I thought.

75
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,241
- Are you okay?
- There were kids there.

76
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,448
It's Alex.

77
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,608
He's saying that every
news network in the country

78
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,167
- is looking for a comment from you.
- No comment.

79
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,164
- Ollie, we have to give them something.
- What do you want me to say?

80
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,007
I asked people to come and help,
they almost died because of it.

81
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,167
It's when we have a plan to get Darhk,
then I will talk to the press.

82
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,811
I know HIVE wants this city to die
but going after a volunteer event,

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,321
ltjust seems a little overkill.

84
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,604
Two weeks ago, Darhk told me
to back off my plan to clean up the Bay.

85
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,966
Today, he went after civilians.

86
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,688
This is important to him for some reason.
We need to understand what it is.

87
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,128
Last time I tried to talk to my brother
it didn't go too well.

88
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,691
Try to talk to him again.

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,608
A couple of weeks in a cage
will change your perspective. Trust me.

90
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,168
All right. Almost there.
Maybe two more miles.

91
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,682
Since when does two more miles
mean almost there?

92
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,451
- Taiana, we need to push forward.
- No.

93
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,166
That's what you want.

94
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,727
My brother's dead and
you have me marching to the sea.

95
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,041
I thought you wanted to
get back at Reiter.

96
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,362
I want to kill the bastards
who killed my brother.

97
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,363
Conklin is just an extension of Reiter.

98
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,881
You want to hurt them,
you keep them from getting what they want.

99
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,840
Your idea of revenge
is a bit more indirect than mine.

100
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,010
You're right. I'm using you.

101
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,562
You said you were a dive instructor.
I need those skills.

102
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,406
But I'm promising you,
if I get what I want,

103
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,161
Reiter and Conklin will suffer.

104
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,731
What would Vlad want you to do?

105
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,004
My friends seem to think
you're ready to talk,

106
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,846
but I know better.

107
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,207
You were always
one stubborn son of a bitch.

108
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,248
Pictures of Carly and Andy Junior.

109
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,890
A real man would've asked for them by now.

110
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,890
You know Carly cried for months
because she thought you were killed?

111
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,726
Andy Junior grew up without a father.

112
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,527
- And you let them.
- It wasn't me, it was HIVE.

113
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,043
They fake our deaths so we're untraceable.

114
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,762
Floyd Lawton shot me
with ammo supplied by HIVE.

115
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,121
He didn't even know.

116
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,964
You destroyed your family, Andy!

117
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,130
<i>And you never reached out to them.
Not even once.</i>

118
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,045
How could you do that?

119
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,602
<i>I get it.
You didn't care then, you don't care now.</i>

120
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,081
Just so you know,
your good friend, Damien Darhk,

121
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,243
attacked the Star City Bay this morning.

122
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,130
Hurt a whole lot of people.

123
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,605
And the neuro-blockers he was using on you
were no longer in your system.

124
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,804
So, chemically speaking, Andy,
you're no longer his bitch.

125
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,801
I'm not anyone's bitch. And I'm not yours.

126
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,445
<i>What happened to you, Andy?</i>

127
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,569
If Damien Darhk brainwashed you,
I could get it.

128
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,331
But according to Darhk...

129
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,722
Were you running drugs
and weapons in the 'Stan?

130
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,331
I had to do what I had to do.

131
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,085
I'm giving you a chance here, man.

132
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,491
A chance, Andy, to redeem yourself
for all that you've done.

133
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,322
'Cause I have to believe that
someplace deep inside of you,

134
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,010
you want to make the right choice.

135
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,367
So I'm asking whatever's left
of the brother I loved,

136
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,366
the one I still love, Andy,
one last time, man.

137
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,930
What does Darhk want with the Bay?

138
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,520
I don't know.

139
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,690
Hey, Mom.

140
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,287
- Thank God you're okay, baby.
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm fine.

141
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,527
Oh...

142
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,364
It's so awful. It's just, like...

143
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,121
Who shoots up a bunch of people
during the holidays?

144
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,124
That's what makes it awful?

145
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,290
Why does it look like
Santa Claus threw up in here?

146
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,131
It's for Oliver's campaign holiday party.

147
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,281
I wanted to make sure your
Jewish heritage was represented.

148
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,289
Yeah, I'm not so sure
that's still gonna be happening.

149
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,522
What? Humbug. No, no, no.

150
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,043
That's ridiculous, sweetie. No.
You can't let the terrorists win.

151
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,847
- I'm gonna take a shower.
- Okay.

152
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,325
Mom? Mom? Are you okay?
Are you okay? Are you okay?

153
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,401
- In the Christmas lights...
- Uh-huh.

154
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,846
In a ring box I found...

155
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,920
I found this.

156
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,571
Three carats. Princess cut.
No cloudiness at all.

157
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,850
I knew Oliver loved you,
but not this much.

158
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,688
He's gonna propose.

159
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,690
He's gonna propose. Oh, my gosh!

160
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,002
Honey, I don't know who's more excited,
you or me.

161
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,083
I think it's me.

162
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,085
Thanks for coming.

163
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,522
I'm trying to figure out
how to deal with them.

164
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,602
I sort of think our best bet
is telling the truth.

165
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,201
It's the only play we got, man.

166
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,209
<i>The HIVE has us outnumbered.</i>

167
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,922
If we have any chance of stopping Darhk,
we need to ask the city for help.

168
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,681
If we do this, it is gonna
paint a target on all of our backs.

169
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,127
- We can take care of ourselves
- Let's light 'em up.

170
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,648
Thank you for coming, everyone. Thank you.

171
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,884
As today's tragedy has reminded us,
we are at war.

172
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,081
For six months, we have been besieged

173
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,167
by a nameless, and a faceless organization

174
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,767
that seems hell-bent
on destroying our city.

175
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,166
You know them as the Ghosts.

176
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,244
And while they may be anonymous,
their leader is not.

177
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,802
He has a face. He has a name,
and I think that it is high time

178
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,402
the people of Star City
know the truth about who he is.

179
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,845
His name is Damien Darhk.

180
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,808
He controls the Ghosts on behalf
of an organization known as HIVE.

181
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,651
HIVE wants this city to die.

182
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,322
Now I will be distributing this,
the only known photograph of Mr. Darhk,

183
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,080
to every news outlet and
social media feed in the country.

184
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,370
<i>For months, this man
has made us afraid to walk the streets.</i>

185
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,364
<i>I suggest that we return the favor.</i>

186
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,523
<i>We will also be setting up a hotline.</i>

187
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,331
<i>Now, individually,
Mr. Darhk may be able to defeat us.</i>

188
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,681
<i>But united...</i>

189
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,771
<i>He doesn't stand a chance.</i>

190
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,450
Congratulations, Damien. You're famous.

191
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,127
Well, that should get
his attention at the very least.

192
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,130
- You good with the hotline?
- I'm on it.

193
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,524
- Happy hunting.
- That is a whole lot of Hanukkah.

194
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,961
Yeah. For your campaign holiday party.

195
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,044
You better believe that my faith is
going to be well-represented.

196
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,802
Felicity, we just waved
a red flag in front of a bull.

197
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,729
That doesn't mean the bull
is gonna charge right away.

198
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,804
And it doesn't mean we can put
our entire lives on hold in the meantime.

199
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,245
- But... Help me out here, man.
- No can do.

200
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,528
- Can't throw a grenade then go to ground.
- John is right.

201
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,326
As much as your speech
was about outing Darhk,

202
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,330
it was also about sending the message
that you're not afraid anymore.

203
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,325
- And canceling your Christmas party...
- Holiday. Holiday.

204
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,050
Your holiday party

205
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,769
is sending the opposite message.

206
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,730
Okay. Talk to Lance,
see if he can get some extra security

207
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,849
<i>- for this holiday party.</i>
- Yes.

208
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,730
Could I ask you a question?

209
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,283
Now? Here? I mean...

210
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,446
What's the question?

211
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,291
Did we do the right thing?

212
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,446
You mean with Darhk?

213
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,568
Yeah. Well, he's gonna retaliate.

214
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,361
Somewhere. Some place and...

215
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,087
When he does, we'll be ready.

216
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,407
I think the drugs Reiter has
you and the other captives growing

217
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,971
is just funding his bigger plan,

218
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,202
searching for some sort of
mystical artifact.

219
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,570
- He likes his prayers and trinkets.
- And maps.

220
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,044
But I cannot make that one without
detailed survey maps of the island.

221
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,123
- Reiter doesn't have them?
- Not that I've seen.

222
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,483
But Reiter is not the first person to come
to this island while I've been here.

223
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,004
If you're here to give me
a Christmas present

224
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,563
you can keep whatever knife
or torture device you plan on giving me.

225
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,246
No presents.
Nothing gift-wrapped, at any rate.

226
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,404
I just wanted to check
and see how you're feeling.

227
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,411
I'm great.
Haven't wanted to snap anybody's neck

228
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,962
who's given me the wrong look
since Damien Darhk whammied me.

229
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,248
I think I might be cured, Dad.

230
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,801
So, you can keep whatever file
you have on a pedophile,

231
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,367
or meter maid, or politician,

232
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,285
whoever it is
that you think I'm gonna kill.

233
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,126
Since you told me about
your encounter with Damien Darhk,

234
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,523
- I had my minions looking into it.
- You love having minions.

235
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,286
Darhk's effect on you
had nothing to do with his exposure

236
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,681
to waters from the Lazarus Pit.

237
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,042
Then why do you think
he's affecting my bloodlust?

238
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,363
I don't know. There are very few things
in this world that scare me, Thea.

239
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,967
But I'm beginning to suspect
we're dealing with something

240
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,731
- that might fall into that category.
- Just cheer up, Dad.

241
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,730
Okay? It's Christmas.

242
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,890
We are dealing with universal forces
that I don't understand yet.

243
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,122
Please, promise me
that you will be careful.

244
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,645
I pinky promise.

245
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,005
You look good.

246
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,923
You were not kidding
about the extra security.

247
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,646
- Where did you find all these guys?
- Well, a friend of mine is a SEAL.

248
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,490
He knows someone, who knew someone,
who knew someone.

249
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,728
Really big somebodies.
These guys are like three of me.

250
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,921
Yeah. Where's Laurel?

251
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,889
Probably fielding
a million calls on the hotline.

252
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,241
She must love you right now.

253
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,325
Is it just me or did you hire
the U.S. Army as your caterers?

254
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,726
Actually, they're marines.

255
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,888
I am John Diggle.
I work security for Mr. Queen.

256
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,162
Curtis Holt,
I work for Mr. Queen's girlfriend.

257
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,006
- This is my husband, Paul.
- A hottie. Nice work, Curtis.

258
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,284
- What? Was? Wait, was that weird?
- A little.

259
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,000
Don't worry. You're handsome,
duh, but you bat for the other team.

260
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,287
And I'm practically engaged.

261
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,047
And, by practically engaged,
I mean not engaged at all. Right?

262
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,251
I mean anything could happen eventually
in, like, years. In another galaxy.

263
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,365
Excuse me. Can I steal you for a second?
The fire department chief's here.

264
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,046
- Very nice to meet you.
- You too.

265
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,605
- Curtis.
- Oliver.

266
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,724
- How long have you two been married?
- Five years, right about now.

267
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,361
Oh, winter wedding.
That must've been beautiful.

268
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,801
It was the summer, actually.

269
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,451
We got married on a scuba-diving boat

270
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,721
- near the Great Barrier Reef.
- Whoa...

271
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,042
I hid the ring in a seashell
at the bottom of the reef.

272
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,486
And you are lucky I found it.

273
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,802
Well, you never would've found it
if I'd put it in a dessert

274
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,121
<i>like straight people do.</i>

275
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,324
Have you seen him eat a piece of cake?
He doesn't chew, he inhales.

276
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,960
Soufflé.

277
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,810
- Felicity? Are you okay?
- Yeah. Just got to find my mom.

278
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,923
Oh, my gosh! No, it was awesome.

279
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,841
- Mom?
- Oh.

280
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,561
Uh... Hmm.

281
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,245
I am never gonna be able to un-see this.

282
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,005
Sorry, honey. Um...

283
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,767
Sweetie, I would like you
to meet my boyfriend, Quentin.

284
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,490
- She is your mother?
- He's your boyfriend?

285
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,081
What?

286
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,765
- Did you say boyfriend?
- I'm sorry. Do you...

287
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,771
- Do you guys know each other?
- I thought it was just, like, a date or...

288
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,364
Can I talk to my mom for a second?

289
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,128
Oh, yeah, listen... Um...

290
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,527
- Laurel doesn't know.
- Yeah.

291
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,444
I'm gonna hit myself over the head
with something very heavy

292
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,642
so that I don't know either.

293
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,127
- All right. Yeah. Okay. Bye, honey.
- Bye, honey.

294
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,368
Isn't Quentin amazing? Oh, my gosh.

295
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,889
Oliver was gonna propose to me
three months ago.

296
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,362
- What?
- Three months ago.

297
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,045
- How do you know?
- It's a long story.

298
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,282
But he was gonna propose
and then we moved back here.

299
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,450
So why didn't he just pop the question
once you settled back in?

300
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,850
- Yes.
- No.

301
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,047
Excuse me.

302
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,806
Hey, hey. hey, hey. What's going on?

303
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,047
- I don't know.
- Is it Darhk?

304
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,244
Inasmuch as that he's the reason that
Laurel and Thea showed up on our doorstep

305
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,846
three months ago.
Right before you were going to propose.

306
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,481
And before you say anything,
you should know that my morn found the ring

307
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,723
- in the decorations box.
- It's not what you think.

308
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,081
Well, that depends on whether or not

309
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,209
you think that I think that
you were gonna propose

310
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,648
- and then that you changed your mind.
- I didn't change my mind.

311
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,370
- Well, something changed.
- Everything changed.

312
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,007
Where we live. What we do. Who we are.

313
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,528
- I was gonna propose.
- Hmm.

314
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,489
But then we came back to Star City.

315
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,091
And then I just needed
some time to rethink things.

316
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,607
Because you thought
I wasn't gonna say yes?

317
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,560
No. Because what we're doing is dangerous.
And I...

318
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,603
But I chose this life. And I chose you.

319
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,922
And I don't understand
why we can't have both.

320
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,605
What do we have here?

321
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,250
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

322
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,085
Malbec. Nice.

323
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,925
<i>How did you know that was my favorite red?</i>

324
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,250
So full-bodied, so full of life,
unlike your security outside.

325
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,647
Oh... And in my defense, they fired first.

326
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,129
I guess my invitation
was lost in the mail?

327
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,567
I'm only kidding,
it's not my kind of scene anyway.

328
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,480
Hmm.

329
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,485
I'm only here to have a word
with the man of the hour.

330
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,486
What do you want?

331
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,804
Well, something I can't have, apparently.

332
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,481
Your loyalty, your allegiance.

333
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,926
I told you there'd be
a price to pay if you refused.

334
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,284
I made that decision, not these people.

335
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,485
- Let them go.
- Ooh.

336
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,768
I wish I could do that, I really do.

337
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,402
But sometimes the best way
to teach someone a lesson

338
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,931
isn't to punish them.

339
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,686
It's to punish the ones
he cares about the most.

340
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,680
Bye-bye.

341
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,091
Take them.

342
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,848
- Oliver? Oliver, they took her.
- What?

343
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,204
They took my baby girl.

344
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,526
It's okay. It's okay. I'll get her back.

345
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,161
- They took Thea, too.
- She's gonna be okay.

346
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,362
- What happened?
- It was all over before it started.

347
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,681
John and Thea, they didn't stand a chance,

348
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,887
and I couldn't make a move,

349
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,963
because then Darhk would know
that I was playing for your side.

350
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,730
And I'm not sure that was the right call.

351
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,530
You made the right call.
But we need to track Darhk.

352
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,688
You need to dig up everything
that you can find, okay?

353
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,723
- Yeah. I'm on it.
- Alex?

354
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,724
The police are gonna wanna
ask you about what happened.

355
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,644
Take care of these people.
Get them home if they need it,

356
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,205
get them medical attention
if they need it,

357
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,847
- and pay for it out of the campaign fund.
- Of course. What about the police...

358
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,326
Stall the police.

359
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,729
Tell me where to find Damien Darhk.

360
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,249
Oliver, we'll find them.

361
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,089
Not even the Ghosts know where they are.

362
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,410
Did you learn anything from the hotline?

363
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,249
Only how many
crazy/bored people are in this city.

364
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,091
- Don't go there.
- Where?

365
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,886
Your go-to place.

366
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,602
Where you sit there
and you say that it's all your fault.

367
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,569
Well, it is my fault.
I'm the one who outed Darhk.

368
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,604
I know. I seem to remember us
all being there when you did.

369
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,609
I ran for mayor
because I can protect myself,

370
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,048
- and I thought that all of you could, too.
- And you were right. We can.

371
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,129
I know. But you didn't sign up for this.

372
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,964
Oliver, we can take care of ourselves.

373
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,090
And that's including Felicity.
You inspired a lot of people.

374
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,565
Well, Thea and John and Felicity,
inspiration is not what they need tonight.

375
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,410
Hmm.

376
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,725
But somewhere, someplace,
there is a Ghost that's gonna talk to me.

377
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,720
And what if there isn't?

378
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,610
Then I'm gonna take great pleasure
in trying to make them.

379
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,040
Are you ready?

380
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,881
I hope so.

381
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,930
I don't see how you can free-dive
after only an hour's instruction.

382
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,766
Well, since coming to this island,
I've learned I could do a lot of things

383
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,445
I didn't think I could.
Plus, you're a good teacher.

384
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,449
- I could go with you.
- I know the ship.

385
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,650
I'll be back in a few minutes.

386
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,649
I want every uniform canvassing leads.

387
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,683
I want every detective
talking to every Cl we got.

388
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,285
You get it?

389
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,091
Hey, baby. What's, what's going on?
Something happen?

390
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,164
Got a message from the office.
A tip came through the hotline.

391
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,681
- Yeah. Something we can move on?
- About you.

392
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,847
Come here. Come here.

393
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,804
Are you working for Damien Darhk?

394
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,682
- It's not what you think.
- You don't know what I think.

395
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,371
Darhk threatened you, okay?

396
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,211
I did what I had to do
to keep you safe, honey.

397
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,691
Oh, really? And what's that, Dad?

398
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,009
How many people died?
How many fathers' daughters?

399
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,725
None. I hope. None, I...

400
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,048
I just been eyes and ears, all right?

401
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,887
First for Darhk and then,
for the past month or so, Oliver.

402
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,848
- Oliver knew about this?
- Yeah. He found out.

403
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,488
Didn't take it too well at first,
but then, I think he understood.

404
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,040
Understood what?

405
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,844
That there is nothing I wouldn't do
to protect my baby girl.

406
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,687
Oliver?

407
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,242
- You got something?
- Just a lot of suicidal Ghosts.

408
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,250
- Yeah, and where's that leave us?
- Nowhere.

409
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,524
Honestly, Oliver, this place is even
easier to break into than your last lair.

410
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,841
What the hell is going...

411
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,246
- Dad!
- Malcolm!

412
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,440
We're pressed for time.

413
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,445
Suffice it to say, I'm a little less dead
than most people think.

414
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,367
- What are you doing here?
- My daughter's in danger.

415
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,762
Shouldn't your first question be,
"What took you so long?"

416
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,201
What is this?

417
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,404
HIVE used polyphasic-encrypted
satellite phones to communicate.

418
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,523
- That is one of them.
- And where'd you get it?

419
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,121
I'm Ra's al Ghul.

420
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,691
Maybe we can use the phone to track Darhk.

421
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,769
If Felicity were here, maybe.

422
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,522
But, as it is, our only play
is trading me for them.

423
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,604
Okay, listen, I'm not going to pretend
to understand what is going on here.

424
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,206
But the idea of you
turning yourself over to Darhk,

425
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,890
that's the worst idea
I've heard in a while.

426
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,809
Maybe, but it's our only play.

427
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,481
I brought all this on. I have to end it.

428
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,488
Well, I hope you're all enjoying the city.

429
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,564
You know, we have a lovely symphony

430
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,762
and the best coffee
on the western seaboard.

431
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,602
Wonderful. Ms. Fayad said
you liked to play games, Damien.

432
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,564
- Games?
- Yes, games.

433
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,410
Now you're just wasting our time.

434
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,728
We came here to check
on your progress with Genesis,

435
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,962
not to watch you exercise
a personal vendetta.

436
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,401
Oh. You're talking about
Oliver Queen's friends.

437
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,325
We have greater concerns
than some mayoral campaign.

438
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,004
That campaign's involvement in the
Star City Bay turned out to be a concern.

439
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,080
Well, folks.

440
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,761
Turns out things are
gonna get real interesting.

441
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,806
Real fast.

442
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,324
<i>"DARHK". I was surprised to get your call.</i>

443
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,768
<i>And on one of our secure phones, no less.</i>

444
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,442
You are more than you seem, Oliver.

445
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,808
Oh, you really better hope
that isn't true.

446
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,446
What's the word for a man
who threatens the man

447
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,642
who's holding his
nearest and dearest captive?

448
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,484
I don't know, "idiot"?

449
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,882
You didn't kill my friends.
You took them to make a point.

450
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,323
- You've made it.
- No.

451
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,685
Not yet I haven't.

452
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,161
I'm here. Let my friends go.

453
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,966
I'm sorry, did you think this was
quid pro quo, Mr. Queen?

454
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,527
We had a deal. Now, let my friends go.

455
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,726
Pafience.

456
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,369
Do you know who perfected the gas chamber?

457
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,846
The Nazis.

458
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,364
For years, I wondered why the world would
allow those monsters to exist,

459
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,080
let alone thrive.

460
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,408
<i>And then I realized,
the world needed them to.</i>

461
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,481
As horrible as it sounds,
every now and then humanity needs a reset.

462
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,046
A do-over.

463
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,084
<i>That time has come.</i>

464
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,563
- What is this?
- A demonstration...

465
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,244
Of the project
that you're gonna help us with,

466
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,244
once we install you as mayor.

467
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,211
Think of it as your friends
and family's life insurance policy.

468
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,728
Oh...

469
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:20,250
Thank you for your service,
your mind and your belief in me.

470
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,286
You will forever be part of our HIVE.

471
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,960
<i>"DARHK". The bloom is active.</i>

472
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,966
Good.

473
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,080
Oh, and by the way, thank you for
doing the legwork on skimming the bay.

474
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,966
My people were using the harbor
to create a certain type of algae.

475
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,926
One that would allow us
to do this undetected.

476
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,043
Hmm? Aw, bummer.

477
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,928
Well, at least he lasted longer
than the previous one.

478
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,451
I guess that's something.

479
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,442
All right, let's continue to adjust
the ratio of the bloom.

480
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,403
If you told me I'd ever get used to
seeing you dressed up like that, I'd...

481
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,084
Excellent, you've got your
bondage outfit on.

482
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,240
No mask for you?

483
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,971
Not my thing.

484
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,842
If we're going after Oliver,
wouldn't it make sense for you

485
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,162
to bring along a few of
your little ninja friends?

486
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,243
I can't afford to pit
the League against HIVE.

487
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,840
Do you have Oliver's location?

488
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,686
An abandoned industrial complex
outside Pennytown.

489
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,491
You'd think Darhk would've checked to see
if he was tagged with a tracker.

490
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,126
Well, I'm sure he did.
Damien's very thorough.

491
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,924
But Oliver had me tag him with
the same particulate nanotechnology

492
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,766
- he used on me last year.
- What about me?

493
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,204
- No. You'll blow your cover with Darhk.
- It's pretty much already blown.

494
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,849
- Can you give us the room?
- Happily.

495
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,600
I have enough father and daughter drama
in my life as it is.

496
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,046
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

497
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,805
Remember, we're on a clock.

498
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,003
Okay. if this is about you not trusting me
anymore after working with Darhk...

499
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,804
No. It's just the opposite.

500
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,006
You've done things.

501
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,725
Things that you'll
never forgive yourself for,

502
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,007
because you were protecting me.

503
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,044
But I'm the one who gets to decide
whether I need anyone's protection.

504
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,324
That's not how
parenting works, sweetheart.

505
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,722
I think that you and I can both agree that

506
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,642
our relationship
is a little unconventional.

507
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,403
I guess the mask
should've been the first clue.

508
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,971
Listen, sweetheart.

509
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,889
You just be careful out there, all right?

510
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,371
'Cause I don't know what I'd do
if anything were to happen to you.

511
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,962
In fact, that's not true,
I know exactly what I would do.

512
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,166
And it'd be ugly.

513
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,243
These people. They're volunteers?

514
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,921
True believers. Every last one.

515
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,846
Oliver!

516
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,240
<i>DARHK'. AW...</i>

517
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,326
Well, I'll give you guys some privacy
to say your farewells.

518
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,962
- Are John and Thea all right?
- Yeah. I think so.

519
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,847
Please, don't tell me that
you traded your life for ours

520
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,849
because that would be
extremely Old Oliver.

521
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,320
I had to turn myself in.

522
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,010
It was the only way to know
where you were being held.

523
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,207
One little problem,

524
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,727
two if you think that Darhk is gonna
keep up his end of the bargain.

525
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,691
But what happens when the cavalry shows up
and the Green Arrow's not present?

526
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,246
Darhk is evil, not stupid.

527
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,044
I have that handled, Felicity.

528
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,130
It had to be this way.

529
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,121
Why? Because you think that we're in
this situation because of your decisions?

530
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,044
Look, I really hate to be the one
to break this to you, Oliver,

531
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,044
but you are not the boss of me.

532
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,643
And I am the one who decides
whether I need anyone's protection.

533
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,206
I know.

534
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,882
Back at the Christmas party from hell,
you said you were gonna propose

535
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,003
and you didn't because you weren't sure

536
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,402
our relationship
could survive this kind of life.

537
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,366
It was a holiday party.

538
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,082
And I had more to say,
but we were attacked.

539
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,411
And here we are, fighting...

540
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,242
Fighting our way through the danger
instead of running away from it.

541
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,209
Isn't that the whole point of marriage?

542
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,248
To get through the hard times because
we're together, not in spite of it?

543
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,760
Um...

544
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,128
Just so you know, if you had asked me...

545
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,920
I would've said yes.

546
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,566
- Ah... Thank you for coming.
- Oh, my God.

547
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,807
<i>What's going on?</i>

548
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,288
The deal is that I bring myself here
and you let my friends go.

549
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,006
Hey!

550
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,325
- Let me go!
- I am so sorry about this.

551
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,601
We had a deal!

552
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,280
Well, I think if you replay
our conversation in your mind,

553
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,929
our bargain was only, at best, implied.
Even so... Bad guy, remember?

554
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,891
- You let them go.
- I will. Existentially speaking.

555
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,970
You do this and you lose any leverage
that you have over me.

556
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,130
Wrong. As long as they're alive
you have something to fight for.

557
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,607
That is what I'm taking away from you,
but don't worry.

558
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,086
It's painless.

559
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,320
Well, mostly.

560
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,884
Look for seams, this place
may not be 100% sealed.

561
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,371
Oh, Oliver, don't worry.
There are plenty of fish.

562
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,331
If it's blondes you like, I can have one
at your house in 20 minutes.

563
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,926
<i>One that I won't kill.</i>

564
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,565
Hey! Come on. Let's go.

565
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,404
- Hey. I thought I'd lost you.
- I'm here. I'm here.

566
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,445
Is this guy my father?

567
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,683
Really? And here I was ready
to just call it even for the night.

568
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,486
You may go.

569
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,084
As the kids say, "I got this."

570
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,763
You really haven't learned anything,
have you?

571
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,088
Oh... I might've learned a little.

572
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,091
Where's Malcolm?

573
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,560
There you go.

574
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,284
I am dying to see
what's beneath that mask.

575
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,768
Seems like you're dying a bit, too.

576
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,769
We shouldn't leave all these guys here.

577
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,645
If they're anything like Darhk's guy
in the gas chamber, we probably should.

578
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,521
Okay, they're definitely like
Darhk's guy in the gas chamber.

579
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,611
Is that the best you've got?

580
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,128
There's four of you and a lot more of us.

581
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,926
Yeah, well, now there's five.

582
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,522
I guess you decided
you didn't need anyone's protection.

583
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,285
I brought the cavalry.
Hope you don't mind.

584
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,040
Let's go!

585
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,441
Good news.

586
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:21,565
I'm gonna let you live long enough
to watch me kill your little green buddy.

587
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,320
Get clear!

588
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,121
Are you sure that Darhk
didn't make it out of the explosion?

589
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,931
Have you seen any horror movies?

590
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,724
These guys don't stay dead.

591
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,883
Especially if you can't find a body.

592
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,249
Whoa! Glass half-empty much?

593
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,207
Good news is,
whatever Darhk had going on there,

594
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,370
- we lit it up pretty good.
- Where is Merlyn?

595
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,403
Said he had to attend to League business.

596
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,682
Can't believe I'm gonna say this,
but I owe him one.

597
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,923
- I helped out a little bit, too.
- Yes, you did.

598
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,924
Wait. Aren't we supposed to
go to that thingy?

599
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,560
What thingy?

600
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,890
It's a surprise. You're not the only one
who can keep a secret.

601
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,446
- What happened?
- Shark!

602
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,204
Guess I don't taste very good.

603
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,010
On!

604
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,129
That is gonna leave a scar.

605
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,000
Ahhh...

606
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,486
What?

607
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,160
Well, hey, Taiana.

608
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,360
You're a little less dead
than you're supposed to be.

609
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,482
And you, you may not be a spy
but you're definitely a liar.

610
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,286
Which means you're probably
lying about being a spy.

611
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,248
I'm gonna enjoy taking pieces out of you.

612
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,529
- What do you want?
- To talk.

613
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,089
- Thought you gave up on that.
- I did.

614
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,687
Until I met your cult leader,
Damien Darhk.

615
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,086
It's not a cult.

616
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,645
The man has people, regular people,

617
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,531
honest people, I'm thinking,
so brainwashed.

618
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,451
They're willing to die for him. Cult.

619
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,529
You know what?
Think what you wanna think.

620
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,883
It's a free country. For now.

621
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,720
This isn't you, Andy.

622
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,720
The man I knew...

623
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,364
Pulled me out of dark waters...

624
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,888
Convinced me to keep going
when I didn't see the point.

625
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,323
No. What you didn't see,
what you failed to see

626
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,806
is the man I really am.

627
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,166
Right in front of you. The whole time.

628
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,885
So my brother's a Ghost.

629
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,007
Fine. We'll treat you like a Ghost.

630
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,363
Your vigilante problem's getting worse.

631
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,484
Oh, relax, Ms. Nixon.
Focus on the here and now.

632
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,001
There's concerns that
you're leading us off the rails.

633
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:09,165
No. I'm leading us
exactly where we need to be.

634
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,806
Beautiful, isn't it?

635
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,009
And I don't even like corn.

636
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:20,362
Go ahead. Breathe. Drink it in.
Tell me what it reminds you of.

637
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,922
- It seems so real.
- Ah. I liken it to the air on Everest.

638
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,767
A little thin, maybe but just enough
to keep things interesting.

639
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,809
I thought the tests had failed.

640
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,320
Not the last one.

641
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,167
Thanks to the algae
we engineered from Star City Bay,

642
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,045
the air down here
is now perfectly breathable.

643
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,009
<i>We are right on schedule.</i>

644
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,649
- Phase four begins now.
- And what of Oliver Queen?

645
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,768
This was all Alex's idea.

646
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,247
Here to show the people
that you're not backing down.

647
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,528
All you got to do is flick a switch
and give a speech.

648
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,807
That's it?

649
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,690
We'll be here waiting for you
when you're done.

650
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,329
- You're coming with me.
- No.

651
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,161
Oh... Please. Hey.

652
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,522
Oh, thank you.

653
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,251
<i>Thank you everyone.</i>

654
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,370
This week,

655
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,446
an event just like this was
interrupted by terrorists.

656
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,570
But all of us are here tonight

657
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,561
to send those people
a very simple message.

658
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,368
We're not gonna let the darkness win.

659
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,406
So all of us are here
to light a candle together.

660
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,880
United.

661
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,449
This right there is possible
because of all of you.

662
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,081
And I am grateful for each one of you.

663
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,684
There is one person in particular
that I am grateful for.

664
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,806
You.

665
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,844
<i>Someone that has stood beside me</i>

666
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,011
when times were darkest.

667
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,208
She's the one who lights my way.

668
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,920
Felicity Smoak...

669
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,485
Would you make me...

670
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,769
The happiest man on the face of the Earth?

671
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,523
- Yes?
- Yes.

672
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,242
It looks even bigger in here.

673
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,760
Ooh...

674
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,363
You know what? To tell you the truth,
I don't even care about the bling.

675
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,084
All I care about is you.

676
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,690
What's going on?

677
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,005
Felicity!

678
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,281
English - SDH
