1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,228
# Watching your footsteps #

2
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:04,361
Shit! Hey! Pull up, man!
Come on! Pull up!

3
00:00:24,456 --> 00:00:28,085
- # Look at me #
- Unh! Shit!

4
00:00:28,127 --> 00:00:29,094
- # There is someone #
- Back up!

5
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:30,152
Back up!

6
00:00:31,196 --> 00:00:33,187
# Who really loves you #

7
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,895
# Here's my heart #

8
00:00:36,935 --> 00:00:38,095
Watch your eyes!
Watch your eyes! Come here!

9
00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:40,332
# In my hand #

10
00:00:40,372 --> 00:00:44,103
# Turn around #

11
00:00:44,143 --> 00:00:45,474
- # Look at me #
- Come on. Let's go!

12
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:46,808
Come on, come on, come on.

13
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:54,016
Unh!

14
00:01:31,623 --> 00:01:32,988
- Oh!
- Unh!

15
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:44,500
We're all done here.
You need a ride?

16
00:01:44,536 --> 00:01:47,004
Um, we can walk to my house...

17
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:49,405
and then I'll give you
a ride to yours.

18
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:52,038
No, thanks. We'll be OK.

19
00:01:57,049 --> 00:01:58,107
Will we?

20
00:02:00,552 --> 00:02:01,985
Yeah. We'll be all right.

21
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,545
I mean...

22
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,683
how Frank...

23
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:08,522
God, it... it's not only horrible...

24
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,791
but can you feel...
can you feel how vicious it was?

25
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,195
Easy.

26
00:02:13,232 --> 00:02:15,166
OK? Easy.

27
00:02:16,868 --> 00:02:18,460
Let's just...

28
00:02:18,503 --> 00:02:20,334
let's just take a step back.

29
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,004
All right? He was behind
Ashley and Ashlyn on the ride...

30
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:26,135
but there was no ladder here.
You know, there was no rope.

31
00:02:26,178 --> 00:02:28,703
Nothing in that picture pointed to this.

32
00:02:28,747 --> 00:02:30,510
We were wrong about the photos.

33
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:33,416
I should've left town.
It's better not knowing.

34
00:02:33,452 --> 00:02:36,444
No, it's never better
staying ignorant.

35
00:02:36,488 --> 00:02:38,547
Willful ignorance
is surrendering control.

36
00:02:39,558 --> 00:02:43,358
What, did you read that somewhere
in Mrs. Brooks' English class?

37
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:47,258
No. I... you know, I'm not...

38
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:49,665
I'm not the total idiot
you think I am.

39
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:53,201
OK, that's Lewis after Frank...

40
00:02:53,238 --> 00:02:55,297
then lan and Erin.

41
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,467
There's a couple of kids behind them,
but I can't make them out...

42
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:59,568
because this guy's arm's
in the way. Can you?

43
00:02:59,611 --> 00:03:00,600
No.

44
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:02,511
All right, you know what?

45
00:03:02,547 --> 00:03:04,981
We'll ask Lewis, lan, and Erin
if they remember.

46
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:06,575
OK?

47
00:03:06,618 --> 00:03:09,143
Are there any more pictures
from the roller coaster?

48
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:25,164
I guess...

49
00:03:25,203 --> 00:03:26,761
that kind of thing
is gonna happen to us

50
00:03:26,805 --> 00:03:27,999
for the rest of our lives.

51
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,632
Yeah.

52
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:33,407
You know, I was gonna...

53
00:03:33,445 --> 00:03:35,606
I was gonna ask her to marry me.

54
00:03:37,182 --> 00:03:39,150
Right after graduation.

55
00:03:39,184 --> 00:03:40,981
Heh.

56
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:54,532
Oh.

57
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:02,573
No, wait.

58
00:04:02,607 --> 00:04:04,040
Look, behind Stacy.

59
00:04:05,043 --> 00:04:06,237
That's Frank.

60
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:08,971
This picture shows how he died.

61
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:14,383
All right, go back to Lewis.

62
00:04:14,386 --> 00:04:16,377
All right, go back to Lewis.

63
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,823
OK, he's got that hammer.

64
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,725
And the weight looks like
it's coming down...

65
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:24,558
on his head.

66
00:04:24,596 --> 00:04:25,585
No, no, no, check this out.

67
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,724
Right now Lewis is down at State
for football training camp.

68
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:31,167
State's team is called the Sultans.

69
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:32,829
That's it. That's the clue.

70
00:04:32,871 --> 00:04:35,840
We have to tell him.
Show him these pictures.

71
00:04:40,111 --> 00:04:41,135
Wouldn't you want to know?

72
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:44,079
Wait, there's pictures of us in there?

73
00:04:44,115 --> 00:04:45,810
Yeah.

74
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,112
Yeah, of course.

75
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:49,143
Huh. No.

76
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:51,951
No. I don't want to see mine.
No. Huh.

77
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,287
What about willful ignorance?

78
00:04:53,324 --> 00:04:55,986
Well, I'm full of shit, all right?!

79
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:57,722
I mean, I never thought
I could see my own death...

80
00:04:57,762 --> 00:04:59,024
before it happened, Wendy.

81
00:05:00,198 --> 00:05:02,359
No, you know what?
We can tell Lewis, but...

82
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,369
Seriously, if there's any way
to beat this thing...

83
00:05:05,403 --> 00:05:06,995
I gotta stay focused...

84
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:08,596
and if I look at that picture,
all I'm gonna do is obsess.

85
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,200
So, you know what?
No, I don't want to see it.

86
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:15,472
I mean, unless we have to.

87
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:19,211
You mean until we have to.

88
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,817
One more thing.

89
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,827
Is it bad?

90
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:32,126
I mean, is it, like,
painful or embarrassing?

91
00:05:32,397 --> 00:05:34,661
I mean, there's nothing, like,
up my ass or anything, right?

92
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:36,291
I'll see you tomorrow.

93
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:01,883
You on crack. Both of you.

94
00:06:01,925 --> 00:06:04,257
Just listen, OK?
Ashley and Ashlyn were first.

95
00:06:04,294 --> 00:06:05,921
Then Frankie Cheeks
and then you. This is the...

96
00:06:05,962 --> 00:06:07,486
- Aw, come on, Kevin.
- Listen.

97
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,020
McKinley and Erin
were next, all right?

98
00:06:09,065 --> 00:06:11,192
And there were two people in front of us.
Do you remember who they were?

99
00:06:11,234 --> 00:06:13,498
Fuck no, and I don't care.
And you shouldn't care either, man...

100
00:06:13,536 --> 00:06:15,834
'cause what you're tellin' me
right now is straight bullshit.

101
00:06:15,872 --> 00:06:16,930
Just listen, Lewis.

102
00:06:16,973 --> 00:06:19,339
Kevin, it's like those stories.

103
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:23,209
Like this guy was killed
by a car he sold 10 years ago.

104
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:26,545
Two sisters, right, were killed when
they were driving to visit each other.

105
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,710
You know, shit like that, man.

106
00:06:28,751 --> 00:06:30,218
Fuck the Bruins!

107
00:06:30,253 --> 00:06:32,483
Oh, yeah! Fuck the Bruins!

108
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:34,285
Bruin faggots!

109
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:35,916
Yeah! Fuck the Bruins!

110
00:06:38,928 --> 00:06:42,261
Man, you're reading into this shit
like them damn urban legends.

111
00:06:42,298 --> 00:06:44,266
Three people have died, Lewis.

112
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,631
I mean, if you think
this can be written off...

113
00:06:45,668 --> 00:06:47,636
as a simple coincidence
and it ends there...

114
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,501
you're in serious denial.

115
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:51,029
Unh! What about you two, huh?

116
00:06:51,074 --> 00:06:52,336
What?

117
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:55,503
You both lost people real close
to you in a fucked-up way.

118
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:57,479
And in order to feel
less guilty or whatever...

119
00:06:57,514 --> 00:06:59,243
seeing signs and patterns, man.

120
00:06:59,282 --> 00:07:03,048
I don't blame you.
But it's wrong, dawg.

121
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:05,577
Unh! It's wrong.

122
00:07:07,056 --> 00:07:08,819
That's denial.

123
00:07:08,858 --> 00:07:10,689
Unh!

124
00:07:11,694 --> 00:07:14,060
- Unh!
- You got it!

125
00:07:14,097 --> 00:07:16,361
OK, what about what happened
at the roller coaster? Huh?

126
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,388
Wendy saw it.

127
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:20,300
Man, she got a hunch.
Fuckin' intense, but she got a hunch.

128
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:22,770
Man, I'm here because I get
good hunches before every down.

129
00:07:22,805 --> 00:07:24,796
No, you know
they're either gonna run or pass.

130
00:07:24,841 --> 00:07:26,433
Hers came to her from nowhere.

131
00:07:26,476 --> 00:07:28,205
You're here and alive because of her.

132
00:07:28,244 --> 00:07:29,734
No, I'm alive because of me.

133
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:31,303
No, listen.
You don't get it, man.

134
00:07:31,347 --> 00:07:32,712
Does that make sense to you?

135
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:34,546
There's nothing to get, Kevin!
It's bullshit.

136
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:36,347
No, just hear me out, all right?

137
00:07:36,386 --> 00:07:37,410
Unh.

138
00:07:37,453 --> 00:07:38,818
# Yeah #

139
00:07:44,027 --> 00:07:47,053
Talk about a vision.
Man, I seen my whole life played out...

140
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:49,496
and it sure as hell
ain't gonna end now. Unh!

141
00:07:49,532 --> 00:07:50,760
It's going just as I saw it.

142
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,031
35 high school games
without an injury.

143
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,402
<i>- USA Today</i> All-American.
- Second team.

144
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:58,407
- Free ride to play for the Sultans!
- The Bruins passed on you.

145
00:07:58,441 --> 00:07:59,965
Man, fuck the Bruins!

146
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:01,499
- Fuck 'em!
- You goddamn right!

147
00:08:01,544 --> 00:08:03,603
What the fuck is a Bruin anyway?

148
00:08:03,646 --> 00:08:05,238
Aah!

149
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:07,613
Unh! Unh! Unh!

150
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,242
Four years from now...

151
00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:11,810
Lewis Romero goin' in
the second round to Oakland.

152
00:08:11,854 --> 00:08:13,515
Unh!

153
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:15,683
He's gonna romp and stomp.

154
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:19,718
15 seasons, with four Super Bowl
rings on his fingers.

155
00:08:19,762 --> 00:08:21,889
Lewis ain't afraid of no death.
Fuck Death!

156
00:08:21,931 --> 00:08:24,331
Death is a fuckin' Denver fan.

157
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:26,062
Death wear blue and orange.

158
00:08:26,102 --> 00:08:28,900
Real men wear black.

159
00:08:28,938 --> 00:08:30,098
Lewis ain't afraid of no Death.

160
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:32,437
Death is afraid of me!

161
00:08:32,475 --> 00:08:33,942
Death fears me!

162
00:08:33,977 --> 00:08:35,205
Kevin.

163
00:08:35,244 --> 00:08:37,337
'Cause, baby, I just win.
I just win, Kevin!

164
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,282
That's all I know how to do!
I just win! Unh!

165
00:08:41,317 --> 00:08:42,614
Fuck Death!

166
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:44,586
- Fuck the Bruins!
- Yeah!

167
00:08:44,621 --> 00:08:46,521
Aah!

168
00:08:46,556 --> 00:08:47,989
- Look out!
- Lewis!

169
00:08:50,126 --> 00:08:51,593
Man, that was close, Lewis.

170
00:08:51,628 --> 00:08:53,619
Hey, did you see that?

171
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:57,121
Whoo! What I tell you,
Kevin, huh?

172
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,100
Fuck Death! I just win!

173
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,534
That's all I know
how to do, Kevin.

174
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,662
Baby, I just win!

175
00:09:02,805 --> 00:09:03,897
Aaaaah!

176
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,238
- Ooooh!
- God!

177
00:09:15,985 --> 00:09:18,453
Did I do something...

178
00:09:20,622 --> 00:09:22,317
to bring this on everybody?

179
00:09:22,357 --> 00:09:24,450
Don't, Wendy.

180
00:09:24,493 --> 00:09:27,485
But why me?

181
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:29,793
All those people out there
wanting to have a premonition...

182
00:09:29,831 --> 00:09:32,664
or see a ghost or whatever,
and I don't.

183
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,534
I just want it to stop.

184
00:09:38,573 --> 00:09:40,404
Just stop.

185
00:09:40,442 --> 00:09:43,138
I don't know why, Wendy...

186
00:09:43,178 --> 00:09:45,738
but you didn't do anything.

187
00:09:46,882 --> 00:09:49,407
All right? This is just...

188
00:09:49,451 --> 00:09:51,351
I don't know. I mean,
I wish I knew why, you know?

189
00:09:51,386 --> 00:09:54,116
I wish I could... I could
come up with a guess even...

190
00:09:54,155 --> 00:09:56,350
to make you feel OK, but...

191
00:09:58,827 --> 00:10:01,227
You know, I can't.

192
00:10:03,532 --> 00:10:04,931
Yeah.

193
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:07,595
There's nothing I can do.

194
00:10:11,973 --> 00:10:13,406
Can you drive?

195
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:16,001
Heh.

196
00:10:16,044 --> 00:10:17,306
Yeah.

197
00:10:22,117 --> 00:10:23,709
You know, by the way,
that... that picture of me.

198
00:10:23,752 --> 00:10:28,052
My, uh, my head's not, like,
through the windshield or anything?

199
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:30,455
You know,
crushed by a steering wheel?

200
00:10:30,492 --> 00:10:32,323
Lmpaled by a gear shift?

201
00:10:35,664 --> 00:10:36,824
Right?

202
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:52,274
Zip, it's Pip.

203
00:10:52,314 --> 00:10:53,747
Have you cut
those plywood orders yet?

204
00:10:53,782 --> 00:10:55,272
Uh, that's a big no, Pip.

205
00:10:55,317 --> 00:10:58,684
Osama bin Supervisor wants me
to get rid of these pigeons first.

206
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,312
They keep settin' off the alarms.

207
00:11:13,434 --> 00:11:15,459
Hello, babies.

208
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:45,191
Ha ha ha!

209
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,132
Oh, ha ha ha! Heh.

210
00:11:52,971 --> 00:11:56,270
Hey. After I, uh, restock
this stuff...

211
00:11:56,308 --> 00:11:58,299
that these pinhead customers
can't manage...

212
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,243
to return to the shelves
themselves...

213
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:01,677
we can blow out of here, OK?

214
00:12:01,713 --> 00:12:03,340
Righty-o, babe.

215
00:12:07,652 --> 00:12:08,812
Aah!

216
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:10,583
Erin, it's Wendy and Kevin.

217
00:12:10,622 --> 00:12:12,214
Shit!

218
00:12:12,257 --> 00:12:14,157
You scared the shit out of me!

219
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,387
Yeah, wait till you hear
what we have to tell you.

220
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,905
Zip, it's Pip. Come over here.

221
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:30,669
You are gonna trip
when you hear this.

222
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:33,906
Well, paint me intrigued, Pip.
I'm on my way.

223
00:12:33,945 --> 00:12:37,381
So let me get this straight.
I'm gonna O.D. On nail polish...

224
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,385
and lan is gonna be
embarrassed to death?

225
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:42,046
You saw what happened
to Wendy, right?

226
00:12:42,087 --> 00:12:44,988
What's happened to the others?
I mean, you just saw their pictures.

227
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:58,001
Oh, my God, guys,
what's going on?

228
00:12:58,036 --> 00:13:01,301
What's going on?
That's crazy! That's crazy!

229
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:03,170
Ha ha!

230
00:13:04,276 --> 00:13:06,972
We need to know who was sitting
behind you on the roller coaster.

231
00:13:07,012 --> 00:13:10,379
OK, who was sitting behind us
on the roller coaster?

232
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:13,384
Oh! Oh, wait! Wasn't it
that one guy who got voted...

233
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,251
most likely to become
manager at Red Lobster?

234
00:13:16,288 --> 00:13:17,482
Oh, no. You know what?
God, I remember.

235
00:13:17,522 --> 00:13:19,285
There was this guy,
uh, black cloak...

236
00:13:19,324 --> 00:13:20,848
I didn't see his face, but, um...

237
00:13:20,892 --> 00:13:23,087
the ride attendant
did take his sickle...

238
00:13:23,128 --> 00:13:26,495
before the ride started
if that's helpful in any way.

239
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:28,396
Do you think we care
if you laugh at us?

240
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,923
This is our lives, OK?

241
00:13:29,968 --> 00:13:32,232
What choice do we have?
Just give into it?

242
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,067
Oh, God. You know what?
There is no "it."

243
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:37,006
OK, wait, are you guys saying
that Death is, like, a person?

244
00:13:37,042 --> 00:13:39,670
No. It's like... like a force.

245
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,408
Yeah. Well, you know what?
A force is just a force.

246
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,916
It's nothing else.
Just transferred energy.

247
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:49,409
I mean, it has no goals,
no awareness that is a force.

248
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,115
But there is awareness, McKinley.

249
00:13:51,156 --> 00:13:53,590
In fact, in past cases,
if the next in line is saved...

250
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,889
it'd skip that person.
That's why we're here.

251
00:13:55,927 --> 00:13:57,690
Oh, man,
what have you been smoking?

252
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,963
Ha ha!

253
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:06,737
- Top shelf.
- OK.

254
00:14:14,746 --> 00:14:17,476
Kevin! Those banners.
They're in the picture.

255
00:14:19,117 --> 00:14:20,641
Lan, watch those boxes!

256
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,623
What the fuck, man?
You said those boxes were falling!

257
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,423
No, I said watch the boxes.

258
00:14:30,462 --> 00:14:32,089
Really? What for?
They're not doing anything.

259
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,065
We're not gonna apologize
for trying to save you.

260
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,968
You haven't seen or been through
what we have... yet.

261
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,596
Oh. Yet.

262
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,870
OK, so who's next in this theory
you have, me or lan?

263
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:46,275
Well, we know the order of how
we were sitting on the roller coaster...

264
00:14:46,311 --> 00:14:48,745
but not how it works
with people who sat together.

265
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,578
OK, we don't know
if Ashley or Ashlyn died first.

266
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:54,244
Hmm. God, Death is
fucking complicated.

267
00:14:54,286 --> 00:14:55,719
Ha ha!

268
00:14:55,754 --> 00:14:57,847
No, you know what?
It's not complicated.

269
00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:00,449
It's simple. People die.

270
00:15:00,492 --> 00:15:01,891
That's just part of life.

271
00:15:01,927 --> 00:15:04,691
150,000 people a day, actually.

272
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:06,629
You know? I mean...

273
00:15:06,665 --> 00:15:08,690
we're biological entities,
and death is just...

274
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:11,031
- Top shelf.
- The end of biological function.

275
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:12,058
It's as simple as that.

276
00:15:18,977 --> 00:15:21,445
How can you explain
what happened to us as simple?

277
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:23,276
I mean, if Wendy never had
that premonition...

278
00:15:23,315 --> 00:15:25,806
and none of us had gotten off that ride,
we'd all be dead right now.

279
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,182
- Does that not make sense to you?
- Oh, yeah.

280
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:32,121
Kevin, how come when a guy dies
of a plain heart attack...

281
00:15:32,157 --> 00:15:33,784
no one goes, like...

282
00:15:33,825 --> 00:15:36,953
"Oh, wow, he was
eating French toast...

283
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:38,792
"when Princess Diana
died in Paris...

284
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,993
"and then he saw her funeral on TV,
and now he's dead"?

285
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:43,557
You know why?
Because they'd sound crazy...

286
00:15:43,602 --> 00:15:47,060
so guess how you two
sound right now? Crazy.

287
00:15:47,105 --> 00:15:49,505
Zip, I'm done.
So finish cutting those orders...

288
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,872
- so we can get out of here.
- OK!

289
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:39,879
Unh!

290
00:16:42,394 --> 00:16:43,383
Heh heh!

291
00:16:56,407 --> 00:16:57,840
Ugh!

292
00:16:57,875 --> 00:16:59,467
Sick.

293
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:36,576
OK.

294
00:17:36,614 --> 00:17:38,582
Let's go with
what you guys are saying.

295
00:17:38,616 --> 00:17:39,913
Let's just say, you know...

296
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,384
that Death does have
a conscious plan...

297
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,752
and that it's been
set into motion. Great.

298
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:47,952
So, Newton's third law of motion,
and, well, look...

299
00:17:47,992 --> 00:17:49,823
I'm just guessing
that it goes for Death, too...

300
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,691
when he's working in our world.

301
00:17:51,729 --> 00:17:55,665
Newton says that every action
has an equal and opposite reaction.

302
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,760
So, that means that...

303
00:17:58,803 --> 00:18:02,705
if Death has taken action,
so can we.

304
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,935
And that that action
we take might have...

305
00:18:04,975 --> 00:18:07,535
an opposite reaction
that thwarts Death's intent.

306
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:09,307
You're being a fucker, but go on.

307
00:18:09,346 --> 00:18:12,213
OK. OK.

308
00:18:12,249 --> 00:18:15,480
What if, for example...

309
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:20,320
the last in line were to make
the utilitarian choice...

310
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:22,819
Kill themselves.

311
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:27,429
Wow! Wow! That's pretty much
gonna ruin any plan...

312
00:18:27,465 --> 00:18:30,161
that Death's put in motion.
And even better...

313
00:18:30,201 --> 00:18:34,069
hey, it's gonna save
five skipped lives.

314
00:18:40,177 --> 00:18:41,769
Any takers?

315
00:18:44,381 --> 00:18:46,679
Nah, I didn't think so.

316
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,827
There! Those!

317
00:19:01,332 --> 00:19:03,061
Ugh!

318
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,465
Aah!

319
00:19:07,138 --> 00:19:08,696
Ooh!

320
00:19:16,013 --> 00:19:17,002
Aah!

321
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:19,004
Unh! Unh!

322
00:19:21,218 --> 00:19:22,446
Unh!

323
00:19:35,699 --> 00:19:37,963
Aah!

324
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,847
I didn't say anything.
I mean, I think...

325
00:19:58,889 --> 00:20:00,356
they were trying to scare us
into saying something...

326
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:02,382
but they had nothing
to keep me there.

327
00:20:02,426 --> 00:20:03,859
What'd you tell 'em?

328
00:20:03,894 --> 00:20:06,124
Everything.
I didn't do anything.

329
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,960
I told them about
the pictures in the camera...

330
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,158
and Flight 180
and Frankie and Lewis...

331
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,566
and why we went to see
lan and Erin and...

332
00:20:11,602 --> 00:20:13,035
Did they believe you?

333
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,095
Yeah, right.
Would you believe me?

334
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:17,630
No, they looked at me
like I was crazy.

335
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:20,109
10 hours they had us in there.

336
00:20:20,144 --> 00:20:21,509
For all we know...

337
00:20:21,545 --> 00:20:23,410
whoever was sitting
behind Erin is already dead.

338
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:25,005
And we're next.

339
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:26,573
Now.

340
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:33,516
Lan almost died first,
but we intervened.

341
00:20:33,557 --> 00:20:36,924
So it skipped lan.
That's... that's how we regain control.

342
00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:38,258
If someone intercedes...

343
00:20:38,295 --> 00:20:40,160
the life that was supposed
to be next is skipped.

344
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,425
All right, wait, wait, wait.

345
00:20:41,465 --> 00:20:43,956
So, going by the way we sat
on the roller coaster...

346
00:20:45,436 --> 00:20:48,599
Well, I'm next... and then you.

347
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:51,802
We can beat this.

348
00:20:51,842 --> 00:20:54,606
We're so close.
We can't give up.

349
00:20:55,846 --> 00:20:59,077
All right, my dad's here.
He's gonna give me a ride back.

350
00:20:59,116 --> 00:21:02,085
But are you sure
we shouldn't stick together?

351
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,984
It's just for a couple of hours.

352
00:21:04,021 --> 00:21:05,010
All right? A couple of hours.

353
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,990
Go back, look at the pictures,
see if you can find any more clues...

354
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:11,756
and I'll ask everybody I see if they know
if anyone else got off the ride.

355
00:21:11,795 --> 00:21:13,854
OK?

356
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,498
Was there something
I should know about going?

357
00:21:20,337 --> 00:21:22,498
No, it's just...

358
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:25,030
I'll just be freaking out
every second...

359
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,009
hoping you're OK.

360
00:21:27,044 --> 00:21:29,035
Why?

361
00:21:30,314 --> 00:21:32,248
I mean,
we don't even like each other.

362
00:21:32,283 --> 00:21:34,911
Heh.

363
00:21:35,986 --> 00:21:37,476
Come here.

364
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,588
I got my cell, OK?

365
00:21:45,629 --> 00:21:47,392
Kevin!

366
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,296
Kevin!

367
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:52,568
Kev... get me a lawyer.

368
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:55,037
Find out if there's a law against
impersonating a slut!

369
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,972
Whoa! You're leaving a mark!

370
00:22:11,354 --> 00:22:12,616
Hey, Wen?

371
00:22:12,655 --> 00:22:14,418
So we're meeting some guys
at that centennial thing...

372
00:22:14,457 --> 00:22:18,621
and I could really use
my good-luck... bracelet.

373
00:22:35,445 --> 00:22:36,434
Mmm.

374
00:22:48,157 --> 00:22:49,283
Huh.

375
00:23:19,522 --> 00:23:23,390
Hey, this is Julie.
Leave a message.

376
00:23:23,426 --> 00:23:25,326
Call me on my cell right away.

377
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,129
Hello?

378
00:23:32,168 --> 00:23:34,068
Do you remember Julie
being on the roller coaster?

379
00:23:34,103 --> 00:23:35,934
What, your sister? No.

380
00:23:35,972 --> 00:23:37,303
No, she would've said
something by now.

381
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,898
The person sitting
behind lan and Erin...

382
00:23:38,942 --> 00:23:40,569
was wearing the exact same
charm bracelet...

383
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,339
our grandmother gave her.

384
00:23:42,378 --> 00:23:44,369
Amber or Perry
were probably with her...

385
00:23:44,414 --> 00:23:46,143
so they're next.

386
00:23:46,182 --> 00:23:47,547
I gotta find Julie.

387
00:23:47,584 --> 00:23:48,676
She went to
the tricentennial thing.

388
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,709
Well, I... I'm here now,
working security.

389
00:23:50,753 --> 00:23:52,380
I'll start looking for her.

390
00:23:52,422 --> 00:23:54,356
- I'm on my way.
- Wen, wait.

391
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,085
Look, after them, we're next.

392
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:58,389
So in case somethin'
happens to 'em...

393
00:23:58,428 --> 00:24:00,089
before we meet up...

394
00:24:00,129 --> 00:24:01,858
remember that time
we talked about?

395
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,593
When to look at our pictures?

396
00:24:03,633 --> 00:24:05,362
It's now.

397
00:24:14,944 --> 00:24:16,673
Great. Mine has no clue.

398
00:24:16,713 --> 00:24:19,477
It's just me standing in front of
a blank background...

399
00:24:19,515 --> 00:24:21,881
with Jason at
the amusement park.

400
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:24,887
Wait. McKinley.

401
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:28,015
Lan? Is he in the picture?

402
00:24:28,057 --> 00:24:31,652
No, but it... it feels like a clue.

403
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:35,261
And yours is the picture
that I took...

404
00:24:35,298 --> 00:24:37,027
when I flashed the camera
in your face.

405
00:24:37,066 --> 00:24:41,025
It's all out of focus
and overexposed, like...

406
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:48,304
Like a firework
went off in my face?

407
00:25:13,836 --> 00:25:17,033
# There is someone #

408
00:25:17,073 --> 00:25:20,201
# Walking behind you #

409
00:25:23,446 --> 00:25:26,677
# Look at me #

410
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:28,547
# There is someone #

411
00:25:28,584 --> 00:25:32,486
# Watching your footsteps #

412
00:25:35,224 --> 00:25:37,124
# Look at me #

413
00:25:38,728 --> 00:25:42,095
# There is someone #

414
00:25:42,131 --> 00:25:44,361
# Who really loves you #

415
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,527
The British are coming!
The British are coming!

416
00:25:46,569 --> 00:25:49,094
- Whoo!
- Yay!

417
00:25:49,138 --> 00:25:50,730
Get 'em while they're hot!

418
00:25:55,445 --> 00:25:57,606
Take it to those Redcoats!

419
00:25:57,647 --> 00:25:59,945
Column, advance!

420
00:26:11,994 --> 00:26:13,894
The kite is aloft.

421
00:26:15,364 --> 00:26:18,162
Now, let us hope
for some lightning.

422
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,761
Fuck you, Ben Franklin.

423
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:32,208
But he kept insisting.
"Get over here," right?

424
00:26:34,417 --> 00:26:36,510
This is awesome, dude!

425
00:26:36,552 --> 00:26:37,814
Heh heh.

426
00:26:37,854 --> 00:26:39,219
Whoa. Hey!

427
00:26:39,255 --> 00:26:40,688
Ha ha! Come on!

428
00:26:40,723 --> 00:26:42,714
Hey, get out of here with those, man!
You're gonna set these off!

429
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:44,226
Hurry, dude.

430
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,659
Come on, man, let's go!
Hurry up!

431
00:26:47,163 --> 00:26:50,894
Ladies and gentlemen,
to celebrate McKinley's tricentennial...

432
00:26:50,933 --> 00:26:53,663
the fireworks extravaganza
will begin shortly.

433
00:26:58,808 --> 00:27:00,332
Oh, my God. Julie.

434
00:27:00,376 --> 00:27:01,343
- What?
- Look.

435
00:27:01,377 --> 00:27:03,277
There's Kahlil.

436
00:27:03,312 --> 00:27:04,904
Should we?

437
00:27:04,947 --> 00:27:06,608
Hey, guys. I'm sorry,
but you can't be here, OK?

438
00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:08,947
The viewing site is over there.
You too, sir. Come on.

439
00:27:08,985 --> 00:27:10,816
They're not gonna
make us move, are they?

440
00:27:10,853 --> 00:27:12,445
I don't fucking believe them.

441
00:27:12,488 --> 00:27:14,979
- OK, we gotta clear out.
- Mm-hm.

442
00:27:21,564 --> 00:27:23,054
Excuse me.

443
00:27:48,191 --> 00:27:49,715
- Ladies.
- Boys.

444
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:50,748
What's going on?

445
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,792
Hey, Julie.

446
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,264
- You three need to come with me.
- What did we do?

447
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,994
Look, it's for your own safety,
Julie, all right?

448
00:27:58,034 --> 00:27:59,865
I'll tell you about it as soon as
we get away from here, OK?

449
00:27:59,902 --> 00:28:01,733
Let go of me!

450
00:28:01,771 --> 00:28:02,829
Julie.

451
00:28:02,872 --> 00:28:04,066
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

452
00:28:04,106 --> 00:28:05,266
Julie!

453
00:28:33,069 --> 00:28:34,093
Heh heh heh!

454
00:28:35,638 --> 00:28:37,071
- Sweet.
- Ha ha!

455
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,332
Yeah!

456
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,942
Light it! Light it!
Go, go, go, man!

457
00:28:51,687 --> 00:28:53,484
Julie!

458
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,750
Uh! Oh!

459
00:29:03,165 --> 00:29:04,723
- Oh, shit!
- Dude, we gotta bail!

460
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,512
- Aah!
- Unh!

461
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:22,881
Unh! Hey!

462
00:29:24,353 --> 00:29:27,550
Julie! No, wait, wait.

463
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,058
You're in danger, OK?
I'm trying to explain something.

464
00:29:30,092 --> 00:29:32,822
Let me explain this to you.

465
00:29:36,732 --> 00:29:38,165
Julie, look out!

466
00:29:39,535 --> 00:29:41,332
- Aah!
- Unh!

467
00:29:42,872 --> 00:29:44,669
Aah!

468
00:29:44,707 --> 00:29:45,799
Julie!

469
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:48,333
Unh!

470
00:29:48,377 --> 00:29:50,208
Aah! Unh!

471
00:29:52,114 --> 00:29:53,638
Cut him off!

472
00:29:58,554 --> 00:29:59,851
Unh!

473
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:02,413
Aah!

474
00:30:05,695 --> 00:30:06,684
Aah!

475
00:30:09,165 --> 00:30:10,564
Aah!

476
00:30:18,074 --> 00:30:19,405
OK, OK.

477
00:30:21,777 --> 00:30:23,142
Stay back! He's dangerous!

478
00:30:26,582 --> 00:30:27,708
I got him.

479
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,945
- Just let me go.
- No, Julie.

480
00:30:29,986 --> 00:30:31,180
You have to tell me,
you have to listen.

481
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,484
Tell me who was sitting next to you
on the roller coaster!

482
00:30:33,522 --> 00:30:35,387
Oh, my God,
Julie, are you all right?

483
00:30:37,093 --> 00:30:38,390
Listen to me!
You have to tell me...

484
00:30:38,427 --> 00:30:40,292
who was sitting next to you
on the roller coaster!

485
00:30:40,329 --> 00:30:42,729
Who? She's next!

486
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,998
Aah!

487
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,681
Kevin.

488
00:31:12,762 --> 00:31:14,252
Aah!

489
00:31:14,296 --> 00:31:15,957
Fire!

490
00:31:15,998 --> 00:31:18,193
Kevin.

491
00:31:18,234 --> 00:31:21,761
You saved my life.

492
00:31:27,476 --> 00:31:28,875
Thanks for that, McKinley.

493
00:31:28,911 --> 00:31:30,879
- Shut up, McKinley!
- No!

494
00:31:30,913 --> 00:31:32,380
We have to get out of here now.

495
00:31:32,415 --> 00:31:33,575
What's the deal?

496
00:31:33,616 --> 00:31:36,210
Lan McKinley.
He causes my death.

497
00:31:36,252 --> 00:31:38,379
In my picture I was wearing
the McKinley grad night shirt.

498
00:31:38,421 --> 00:31:40,184
- He's the clue.
- What?

499
00:31:40,222 --> 00:31:42,213
There's a first aid tent,
there should be security.

500
00:31:44,393 --> 00:31:46,361
Get the fuck outta here, McKinley!

501
00:31:46,395 --> 00:31:50,456
Hey, I'm just celebrating
our town's tricentennial.

502
00:31:53,569 --> 00:31:54,627
You followed me!

503
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,570
Oh! You are paranoid.

504
00:31:56,605 --> 00:31:58,664
But, hey, I saw what happened.

505
00:31:58,707 --> 00:32:01,471
You're next, right?
You're the end of it, aren't you?

506
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,909
Man, I would be paranoid, too.

507
00:32:02,945 --> 00:32:04,742
You didn't even believe me!

508
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,840
Yeah, well, seeing is believing.

509
00:32:07,883 --> 00:32:09,578
Then you have
to stay away from me!

510
00:32:09,618 --> 00:32:12,849
"Have to"?
Wow, that's extreme.

511
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,687
Oh, no way.

512
00:32:21,363 --> 00:32:23,058
Do I cause your death?

513
00:32:24,733 --> 00:32:26,667
Just like you caused Erin's?

514
00:32:27,703 --> 00:32:29,694
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, what? What?

515
00:32:29,738 --> 00:32:32,605
You have a vision? Was I in it?

516
00:32:32,641 --> 00:32:34,541
Was I in a picture?

517
00:32:36,812 --> 00:32:39,246
Just tell me how to start it off!

518
00:32:39,281 --> 00:32:41,943
Let's get this over with!

519
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,714
You'll save me
if you just stay away!

520
00:32:44,753 --> 00:32:46,050
Then it'll all be over!

521
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:49,057
What do I care? It skipped me.

522
00:32:49,091 --> 00:32:50,888
For me, it is over.
I'm not dying.

523
00:32:50,926 --> 00:32:53,793
I'm not dying!

524
00:33:04,306 --> 00:33:06,001
Ha ha ha!

525
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:08,100
You see?

526
00:33:08,144 --> 00:33:09,406
I'm not gonna die!

527
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,743
It's you, Wendy! You're dead!

528
00:34:06,434 --> 00:34:09,631
# Came back down
from this fight #

529
00:34:09,671 --> 00:34:11,161
- Hi!
- # Will get ya deeper #

530
00:34:11,206 --> 00:34:12,571
# And make you right #

531
00:34:12,607 --> 00:34:13,631
Thank you.

532
00:34:13,675 --> 00:34:16,439
# Bruno's drops
threaten her... #

533
00:34:16,478 --> 00:34:17,706
Wait, what about
that great curry place?

534
00:34:17,746 --> 00:34:19,145
Don't we get off at Booth?

535
00:34:19,181 --> 00:34:21,046
Oh, you mean Gupta's.
You get off at Oswald.

536
00:34:21,082 --> 00:34:22,640
Oh, that's right.

537
00:34:23,885 --> 00:34:26,353
You know, if I can't be home
for Thanksgiving...

538
00:34:26,387 --> 00:34:29,151
I need some semblance
of a traditional dinner.

539
00:34:29,189 --> 00:34:31,384
Turkey, stuffing, pie.

540
00:34:50,543 --> 00:34:51,840
If you don't have turkey
for one Thanksgiving...

541
00:34:51,878 --> 00:34:53,505
is that really gonna kill you?

542
00:34:54,514 --> 00:34:57,642
# There is someone #

543
00:34:57,683 --> 00:35:01,141
# Walking behind you #

544
00:35:01,187 --> 00:35:04,486
# Turn around #

545
00:35:04,524 --> 00:35:08,221
# Look at me #

546
00:35:08,261 --> 00:35:11,628
# There is someone #

547
00:35:11,664 --> 00:35:15,532
# Watching your footsteps #

548
00:35:15,568 --> 00:35:16,830
# Turn around #

549
00:35:24,377 --> 00:35:27,642
# There is someone #

550
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,810
# Who really needs you #

551
00:35:31,851 --> 00:35:34,718
# Here's my heart #

552
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:06,476
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

553
00:36:09,288 --> 00:36:10,653
This is Booth Street.

554
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:15,127
Next stop is Oswald.
End of the line.

555
00:36:15,161 --> 00:36:19,222
The next stop
is the end of the line.

556
00:36:20,266 --> 00:36:23,030
Wendy! Next stop after this.

557
00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:25,333
- Let's just walk.
- It's freezing out.

558
00:36:25,371 --> 00:36:26,998
Yeah, but the air'll feel good.

559
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:29,803
I could use some air.

560
00:36:32,345 --> 00:36:34,905
Yeah!

561
00:36:34,947 --> 00:36:36,175
Ha ha ha! Yeah, man!

562
00:36:36,215 --> 00:36:37,546
All right, man. See ya.

563
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:38,607
Let's go, Bruins!

564
00:36:38,651 --> 00:36:39,640
Bruins, yeah!

565
00:36:55,534 --> 00:36:57,058
Hey, man, peace out!

566
00:36:57,103 --> 00:36:58,627
- Come on.
- Excuse me.

567
00:36:58,671 --> 00:37:01,071
- Watch out!
- Hey, Bruins!

568
00:37:01,107 --> 00:37:03,098
You missed the beginning.
Did you see that?

569
00:37:03,142 --> 00:37:04,268
This is it!

570
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:07,939
Yo, comin' through. Excuse me.

571
00:37:09,982 --> 00:37:11,916
Oh, my God.

572
00:37:12,918 --> 00:37:16,684
I can't believe this. Here.

573
00:37:18,424 --> 00:37:21,393
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

574
00:37:21,427 --> 00:37:24,089
I thought you weren't
coming till tonight.

575
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,564
Well, Dad's car just, like,
dies out of nowhere...

576
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:28,396
and he couldn't get it fixed
anywhere on a holiday...

577
00:37:28,434 --> 00:37:29,799
so instead of sitting around
for a few hours...

578
00:37:29,835 --> 00:37:31,769
I lucked out and caught
an early train.

579
00:37:31,804 --> 00:37:33,567
I hope I'm not messing you up or...

580
00:37:33,606 --> 00:37:35,767
No, no, it's just, um...

581
00:37:35,808 --> 00:37:39,539
I think I had a sense
that you were coming now.

582
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:45,883
I was just...

583
00:37:45,918 --> 00:37:49,251
I was feeling like I did that night.

584
00:37:50,256 --> 00:37:52,247
No. No, it's over.

585
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:55,158
You, me, Kevin went over
a thousand scenarios.

586
00:37:55,194 --> 00:37:56,491
Lan was gonna cause your death...

587
00:37:56,529 --> 00:37:58,326
you intervened,
and it skipped us.

588
00:38:05,004 --> 00:38:07,734
Look, I'm not worried.

589
00:38:07,773 --> 00:38:10,708
I ran into Kevin at home.
He's not worried.

590
00:38:10,743 --> 00:38:12,005
And, if I were you...

591
00:38:12,044 --> 00:38:14,410
until something happens
to me and then Kevin...

592
00:38:14,447 --> 00:38:16,074
you've got nothing
to worry about.

593
00:38:17,416 --> 00:38:19,247
You're right.

594
00:38:19,285 --> 00:38:21,116
Uhh.

595
00:38:21,153 --> 00:38:23,314
Hey, I... I want you to meet
my roommate and my friend, OK?

596
00:38:23,355 --> 00:38:24,447
Yeah.

597
00:38:26,392 --> 00:38:27,791
Hey, guys. This is Julie, my...

598
00:38:39,438 --> 00:38:41,770
What are you doing here?

599
00:38:41,807 --> 00:38:44,002
Wendy! Julie!

600
00:38:44,043 --> 00:38:45,943
What are the chances?

601
00:38:45,978 --> 00:38:47,343
How long have you been
on this train?

602
00:38:47,379 --> 00:38:48,971
Uh, since home.

603
00:38:49,014 --> 00:38:50,845
I was headin' up
to check out the game.

604
00:38:50,883 --> 00:38:52,441
I was gonna look you up
afterwards.

605
00:38:55,054 --> 00:38:56,282
You OK?

606
00:38:56,322 --> 00:38:58,085
Is something wrong?

607
00:39:06,699 --> 00:39:07,688
Aah!

608
00:39:19,044 --> 00:39:20,705
Aah!

609
00:39:26,952 --> 00:39:28,214
Aah!

610
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:33,486
- Aah!
- Unh!

611
00:39:36,028 --> 00:39:38,019
- Julie, stay down!
- Aah!

612
00:39:38,063 --> 00:39:40,293
Julie!

613
00:39:40,332 --> 00:39:41,321
Aah!

614
00:39:46,472 --> 00:39:47,939
- Kevin!
- Unh!

615
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:50,634
Aaaaaah!

616
00:39:51,644 --> 00:39:53,475
Oh, God!

617
00:39:53,512 --> 00:39:54,638
Aah!

618
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:58,048
Aah!

619
00:40:44,763 --> 00:40:46,856
Aah! Unh!

620
00:41:05,384 --> 00:41:08,979
No!

621
00:41:09,021 --> 00:41:12,320
I was gonna look you up
afterwards, but...

622
00:41:13,726 --> 00:41:14,784
You OK?

623
00:41:14,827 --> 00:41:17,318
Is somethin' wrong?

624
00:41:18,397 --> 00:41:20,592
The train...

625
00:41:20,633 --> 00:41:23,659
Oh, shit. Not again.

626
00:41:23,702 --> 00:41:25,294
We gotta get out!

627
00:41:25,337 --> 00:41:28,363
It's not working.
Somebody stop the train!

628
00:41:44,123 --> 00:41:46,648
