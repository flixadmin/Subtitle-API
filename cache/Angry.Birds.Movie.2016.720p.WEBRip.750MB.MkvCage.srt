2
00:01:12,878 --> 00:01:15,120
Okay, come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

3
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,653
Oh, boy. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go, buddy.

4
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:20,782
Come on. Come on.
We got to move. We got to move.

5
00:01:23,252 --> 00:01:24,545
Whoa!

6
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:28,078
Oh...!

7
00:01:28,103 --> 00:01:30,166
Yes, yes, yes...
No, no, no...

8
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:31,577
Ahhh!

9
00:01:31,602 --> 00:01:32,703
Aw!

10
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:38,733
Uh!
What!

11
00:01:38,758 --> 00:01:39,817
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

12
00:01:39,842 --> 00:01:42,747
Egg! Egg!
Got you.

13
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,570
Ow.
Ow.

14
00:01:46,595 --> 00:01:49,430
Ow. Ow. Ow.
Ow. Ow.

15
00:01:50,147 --> 00:01:52,733
I don't like it!
I don't like it!

16
00:02:05,301 --> 00:02:06,715
Beak.
Wing.

17
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,863
Tail.
Ribs.

18
00:02:08,888 --> 00:02:10,640
Giblets.

19
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:17,607
I'm flying.
No, still can't fly.

20
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,875
Notta dodbly leees.
(Not the top of my list.)

21
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:24,108
Breathe.
Breathe.

22
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,682
Bottom feeder.

23
00:02:29,707 --> 00:02:31,498
Up... and over.

24
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:34,662
Woo.
Huh!

25
00:02:37,042 --> 00:02:38,716
Ta-da!

26
00:02:38,717 --> 00:02:39,743
No, no, no...

27
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:42,102
Look, it's okay.
I'm just a clown.

28
00:02:42,252 --> 00:02:44,524
Oh boy.
That's loud.

29
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:46,595
You're loud.
You're... very scared of me.

30
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,465
Here, come here.
No? Okay. No, never mind.

31
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,068
Uh.
Happy Hatchday.

32
00:02:50,093 --> 00:02:51,643
Oh.
Hi, pal.

33
00:02:51,668 --> 00:02:55,383
You must be so disappointed
in yourself for being this late.

34
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,036
Oh, no.
No. No, no, no.

35
00:02:57,061 --> 00:02:58,436
I'm not late.
Look at the time.

36
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:00,783
See.
The order said, "Before noon."

37
00:03:02,043 --> 00:03:04,497
Okay.
Now, you're late.

38
00:03:04,522 --> 00:03:06,534
- What?
- Where have you been?

39
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:08,633
- It's funny you ask. I was...
- You missed the party.

40
00:03:08,658 --> 00:03:10,198
- What is that?
- Oh, that.

41
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:12,842
Uh, yes.
I fell on the box.

42
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:15,328
Oh, the squirrel.
That's on us.

43
00:03:15,353 --> 00:03:18,170
You know, I tried to keep my body
between the ground and the box,

44
00:03:18,195 --> 00:03:19,903
but...
No, I think I got a little bruise.

45
00:03:19,928 --> 00:03:21,687
You see anything back there?

46
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,754
Hear that, honey?
The clown we paid

47
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:27,428
to be here an hour ago,
fell on our son's hatchday cake.

48
00:03:27,453 --> 00:03:30,104
That's why our son's hatchday
party is ruined.

49
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:32,227
- Oh.
- And the next time you messed up.

50
00:03:32,252 --> 00:03:36,963
Don't tell me a story.
Just take responsibility.

51
00:03:36,988 --> 00:03:38,799
Hey, man.
It wasn't a story.

52
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:41,285
I'm a screw up
that woke up late

53
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,859
and fell on the thing
you paid for!

54
00:03:43,884 --> 00:03:46,438
It wasn't a story,
I almost drown.

55
00:03:46,463 --> 00:03:50,529
Why don't we just settle this out
and say the cake's on you.

56
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:56,984
I'm sorry.
It's on me?

57
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:59,407
Well, who else will it be on?

58
00:04:01,396 --> 00:04:03,271
Well, you know, I...

59
00:04:03,295 --> 00:04:04,804
I'm not sure you're
going to like this.

60
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:07,160
Um...
but, since you asked.

61
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:10,642
Rather than being on me
as you suggested.

62
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,643
This cake...

63
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,399
... is on YOU!

64
00:04:16,114 --> 00:04:17,492
So, you want to hear a story?

65
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:20,207
I run my butt off,
literally, mind you.

66
00:04:20,232 --> 00:04:22,427
To get the "gluten free cake."

67
00:04:22,452 --> 00:04:25,935
What the heck is gluten?
I mean, does gluten even exist?

68
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,840
Who are you?

69
00:04:27,865 --> 00:04:29,511
- Get out of here!
- Already.

70
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:32,096
But, you're the only one
that has cake.

71
00:04:33,182 --> 00:04:34,498
Oh, that's good stuff.

72
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:36,793
Anybody want to eat some cake
off their dad or husband?

73
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,522
Who needs plates when
you got this guy's face, right?

74
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:42,091
Oh, oh, oh, mm.
Oh, wait. I almost forgot.

75
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:44,575
You know, I'm suppose to do a
quick customer satisfaction survey

76
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,144
before I... weet weet split, okay.

77
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:48,153
So, on a scale of 1 to 3 stars,

78
00:04:48,178 --> 00:04:49,442
what would you say
about my performance.

79
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:51,134
And don't forget,
the squirrel was...

80
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:56,313
... free.

81
00:04:56,999 --> 00:05:00,637
- Sorry about this.
- No!

82
00:05:00,662 --> 00:05:04,278
My bad.

83
00:05:05,156 --> 00:05:06,381
Huh?

84
00:05:15,758 --> 00:05:17,056
Congratulations!

85
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:18,316
- Huh?
- Oh...!

86
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:20,231
It's a boy.

87
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,863
Hey.
Eyebrows.

88
00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:58,768
Eyebrows.

89
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:01,091
- Eyebrows.
- Eyebrows.

90
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,591
- Eyebrows.
- Eyebrows.

91
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:35,803
Oh...

92
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,085
Hm.

93
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,575
Oh.

94
00:06:45,244 --> 00:06:46,488
Oh.

95
00:07:08,753 --> 00:07:09,931
Your Honor.

96
00:07:09,956 --> 00:07:14,497
Our family has always practice
natural child attach,

97
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:18,346
the risk of having a scramble
infant are too great.

98
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,941
There was going to be music

99
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:23,753
The nest was going to be full
of beautiful fresh cut flowers.

100
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:27,249
And the first 2 faces
he was going to see

101
00:07:27,287 --> 00:07:31,905
were the loving faces of 
his mother and his father.

102
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:36,152
We can never get
that moment back.

103
00:07:36,177 --> 00:07:40,516
Ma'am, I never wanted my face
to the first face your the baby saw.

104
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:44,362
What are we talking about here.
He probably doesn't even remember me.

105
00:07:44,387 --> 00:07:45,687
Daddy!

106
00:07:45,712 --> 00:07:47,502
No, no, no. No.
Shhh, shut up.

107
00:07:47,527 --> 00:07:50,055
Shut up.
Cool it!

108
00:07:51,127 --> 00:07:54,296
Ladies and gentlemen.
Am I a passionate bird?

109
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:56,689
Yes.
Guilty as can be.

110
00:07:56,714 --> 00:07:58,930
It was a quality cake.

111
00:07:58,955 --> 00:08:03,010
Look, I worked very hard
to get it there, on time.

112
00:08:03,035 --> 00:08:06,854
And he wouldn't even try it.

113
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,079
Mr. Red.

114
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:14,672
We are a happy happy bird community.
Under the protection of Mighty Eagle.

115
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:17,978
We work, we play, we laugh.

116
00:08:18,003 --> 00:08:22,041
We love and we live our lives
free from conflict and strife, sir.

117
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:24,640
We love the sound of our
own voice too, evidently.

118
00:08:24,665 --> 00:08:28,091
Perhaps you've never heard the joke,
"Why don't birds fly?"

119
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:29,538
I'm going to tell you why.

120
00:08:29,563 --> 00:08:32,970
Because, where else
would we ever want to go?

121
00:08:34,016 --> 00:08:36,000
- Wow. Not a good joke.
- It kills me every time, guys.

122
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:40,135
So now, what am I
to make of the likes of you.

123
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,590
There seems to be
a recurring issue here.

124
00:08:43,615 --> 00:08:45,169
Anger.

125
00:08:45,194 --> 00:08:47,781
I don't think I have an anger issue,
I think you got an anger issue.

126
00:08:47,806 --> 00:08:49,364
- Oh.
- Oh.

127
00:08:49,388 --> 00:08:51,289
Anger...

128
00:08:51,314 --> 00:08:55,560
is a weed growing in our garden.

129
00:08:55,585 --> 00:08:59,006
And what do you do
when you find a weed?

130
00:08:59,031 --> 00:09:01,208
I don't know.
But I bet you're going to tell me.

131
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:03,201
You pluck it out!

132
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:05,039
Oh my gosh.

133
00:09:05,064 --> 00:09:06,501
Mr. Red.

134
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:09,081
When you moved your house
outside of our village,

135
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:12,281
did you notice that
nobody tried to stop you?

136
00:09:12,306 --> 00:09:15,096
Birds, they may smile
at you on the street

137
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:19,058
but, that doesn't mean
they like you.

138
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:20,826
Mm-Hm.

139
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,613
Hey, you know what?
I got a question for you.

140
00:09:22,638 --> 00:09:26,469
Are you aware that, that robe
you're wearing isn't fooling anybody?

141
00:09:26,494 --> 00:09:30,627
We all see you prancing
along the street, your Honor.

142
00:09:30,652 --> 00:09:33,067
And, you're what?
And I'm just approximating here.

143
00:09:33,092 --> 00:09:34,396
Like an inch tall!

144
00:09:34,421 --> 00:09:35,798
You...
What are you doing?

145
00:09:35,823 --> 00:09:38,288
- Viola.
- Ah-choo!

146
00:09:39,725 --> 00:09:41,639
- What the?
- Daddy.

147
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,965
Mr. Red, given the
severity of the crimes,

148
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:49,577
I have no choice but to
impose the maximum penalty

149
00:09:49,602 --> 00:09:52,075
allowed by the law.

150
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,421
Anger management class.

151
00:09:55,446 --> 00:09:58,448
Aw.
Pluck my life.

152
00:10:00,705 --> 00:10:02,413
- Fresh worms, caught today.
- Huh?

153
00:10:02,438 --> 00:10:03,684
Hey, Red.
How are you?

154
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:04,964
Oh, I'm horrible.

155
00:10:04,989 --> 00:10:07,260
Oh. Hi, Red.
It's good to see you.

156
00:10:07,285 --> 00:10:09,342
I wish I could
say the same.

157
00:10:09,645 --> 00:10:12,139
- Ups-a-daisy
- Aw! Ow.

158
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:13,595
Thank you.

159
00:10:15,352 --> 00:10:16,718
Huh?

160
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,100
- Huh?
- Mm-nm.

161
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,377
- Let's go.
- Oh.

162
00:10:20,546 --> 00:10:23,014
How are you, Suzie?
You good?

163
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,216
No running.
No running.

164
00:10:25,804 --> 00:10:27,450
- Oop.
- Come on.

165
00:10:27,475 --> 00:10:31,162
Hey.
How's that nap schedule coming along?

166
00:10:31,187 --> 00:10:32,565
Oh boy.

167
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,046
Y'guys ever thought about bird control.

168
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:39,089
Left, right, left, right,
there you go.

169
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:45,006
Hi.
Hi.

170
00:10:51,534 --> 00:10:53,456
Alright.
Oop!

171
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:55,916
Girlie. Girlie.
You got this.

172
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,478
We don't want you to fall now,
take your time.

173
00:10:58,705 --> 00:11:00,696
Here we go.
That's it.

174
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:05,114
Oh, you're doing it.

175
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,559
- Seriously?
- I'm almost there.

176
00:11:11,749 --> 00:11:13,854
<font color="#379bff">(HUG TRADER)</font>

Crane pose.

182
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,470
Wow.

183
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:41,152
Mighty Might Eagle soaring free.
Defender of our homes and liberty.

184
00:11:41,177 --> 00:11:43,856
Hi, Red.
Is one of those yours?

185
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:44,953
What?

186
00:11:44,978 --> 00:11:47,090
Yeah.
When birds fly.

187
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:49,937
Mighty Eagle is a legend.

188
00:12:34,418 --> 00:12:37,102
You think that's funny.
Ha ha ha. This is funny.

189
00:12:39,147 --> 00:12:40,487
Oh oh.

190
00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:00,193
What?

191
00:13:19,972 --> 00:13:21,946
Don't look, Bobby.

192
00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:24,331
The anger might be contagious.

193
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:26,062
Let's go.

194
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:27,702
He started it.

195
00:13:30,357 --> 00:13:31,842
There you go.

196
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,907
Ah-hah.

197
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:48,980
Oh, look at this.
This is going to be awful.

198
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,120
Okay, I guess that's art.

199
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:54,578
That's garbage.

200
00:13:54,603 --> 00:13:58,517
And that's,
exotic.

201
00:14:00,744 --> 00:14:03,390
- Free rage what?
- Oh, hi.

202
00:14:03,415 --> 00:14:04,861
- Hi, there. Welcome...
- Hello.

203
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,077
... to the Infinity Acceptance Group.

204
00:14:07,102 --> 00:14:08,648
- I, am Matilda.
- Okay.

205
00:14:08,673 --> 00:14:13,138
And I'm just super psych to be
taking this journey with you.

206
00:14:13,163 --> 00:14:15,463
Oh.
You're gonna have a blast!

207
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:19,113
I'm really fun.
Everybody says that about me.

208
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:22,065
Hey, guys.
Say hello to Red, everyone.

209
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,595
Hello.

210
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,979
Hi, Red.

211
00:14:25,004 --> 00:14:27,056
Hello, birds I won't
get to know well.

212
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:29,593
Hey, apparently somebody didn't get
the memo that we like to start on time.

213
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,561
Because you're about 2 minutes late,
don't let it happen again.

214
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:33,720
Hi, my name is Chuck. I'm sorry
we got off on the wrong foot.

215
00:14:33,745 --> 00:14:35,556
I like you a lot.
I can tell.

216
00:14:35,581 --> 00:14:37,287
Okay.
Now, Red.

217
00:14:37,312 --> 00:14:40,574
Would you like to share
your story with us?

218
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:41,699
No.
Not really.

219
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:44,841
Well, the court mentioned
something about a rage episode

220
00:14:44,866 --> 00:14:47,392
at a child's birthday party.

221
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:49,319
How long is this class anyway?

222
00:14:49,344 --> 00:14:51,718
As long as you make it.

223
00:14:51,743 --> 00:14:53,220
Really?
Oh, okay.

224
00:14:53,245 --> 00:14:55,424
Uh, gentlemen,
very nice to see you.

225
00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:57,299
And uh, almost meet you.

226
00:14:57,324 --> 00:14:59,140
Probably the nicest part of it
is not getting to meet you.

227
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:00,325
You know,
in some weird away.

228
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,551
Alright.
So, I'm gonna go ahead and

229
00:15:02,576 --> 00:15:06,645
scoot on back out, past
those creepy statues and...

230
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,325
HAH!
Back you go.

231
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,240
Sure. No, I can...
take a seat.

232
00:15:10,265 --> 00:15:12,508
So, in another sense,

233
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:15,486
you are here until I
notify the court

234
00:15:15,511 --> 00:15:19,046
that your anger issues
have been resolved.

235
00:15:19,615 --> 00:15:20,723
Oh boy.

236
00:15:20,748 --> 00:15:23,257
Chuck!
Share your story with Red.

237
00:15:23,282 --> 00:15:25,475
Me? I'm the last guy
that should be here.

238
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,814
Simple speeding ticket.

239
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:28,091
Judge tells me
I was going too fast,

240
00:15:28,116 --> 00:15:30,852
So I say, "Your Honor.
To be honest. I was"

241
00:15:30,877 --> 00:15:33,037
You caught me.
I'm not angry. I'm honest.

242
00:15:33,068 --> 00:15:35,524
So, shouldn't I be in
honesty management class?

243
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:37,991
'Cause we got to
manage my honesty.

244
00:15:38,016 --> 00:15:39,195
Mm-hmm.

245
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,972
My one problem,

246
00:15:40,997 --> 00:15:44,086
that's a different story
than you told last time.

247
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:45,778
Uh-uh...

248
00:16:08,674 --> 00:16:09,707
<font color="#ff9933">Officer
Bill Beakins</font>

249
00:16:09,732 --> 00:16:12,075
Drinks on me, guys!

250
00:16:19,695 --> 00:16:20,958
Chuck...

251
00:16:20,983 --> 00:16:23,006
Okay.
Maybe, it wasn't ice cream.

252
00:16:23,031 --> 00:16:24,898
Alright, Chuck.
Thanks, we got it.

253
00:16:24,923 --> 00:16:28,505
And this is Terence.

254
00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:31,418
Woof.
More like, terrifying

255
00:16:31,443 --> 00:16:34,780
No.
It says here in the little filey.

256
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:52,236
Terence uh, seems to have an
incident.

257
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,530
Now Bomb, started
with us 2 weeks ago

258
00:16:55,555 --> 00:16:58,512
Tell us your story, Bomb.

259
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,715
Okay.
Well, sometimes when I get upset,

260
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,754
I... have been known to...
blow up.

261
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:09,254
So, like uh. Like what?
Like you get mad, you mean.

262
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,272
Well. No.
I literally blow up, okay.

263
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:15,556
I explode like a bomb.

264
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:21,650
Hence the name.

265
00:17:24,218 --> 00:17:26,380
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

266
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:32,391
Excuse me.
Party foul.

267
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:33,580
Ow!

268
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:37,573
- Do it!
- No can do.

269
00:17:37,597 --> 00:17:39,287
I just went boom-boom
before class.

270
00:17:39,312 --> 00:17:40,631
Hey, look.
I don't want to be here and all,

271
00:17:40,656 --> 00:17:42,913
but this can maybe make it
a little more interesting to me.

272
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:44,640
So.
Please, explode.

273
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:46,742
- You can't do it, can you?
- Yes, I can.

274
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:50,077
But, I'm having back issues today,
so...

275
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,519
I'm gonna have to
take a rain check.

276
00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:52,907
Aw...
Do it!

277
00:17:52,932 --> 00:17:54,659
Not the time or place,
little amigo.

278
00:17:54,684 --> 00:17:57,185
These guys are all nuts,
huh, big man?

279
00:17:59,544 --> 00:18:02,762
Are we speaking telepathically
or you're just...

280
00:18:04,598 --> 00:18:06,004
Good talk.

281
00:18:06,815 --> 00:18:08,618
Nice chatting with you.

282
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:14,367
Managing our anger
through movement.

283
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:18,439
The first pose is
the dancer pose.

284
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,327
Great form, Terence.

285
00:18:20,352 --> 00:18:22,438
Eagle. Parrot.
Peacock? Warrior.

286
00:18:22,463 --> 00:18:24,536
Mountain. Tree. Rabbit.
Fish. Locust. King pigeon.

287
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,939
And of course, downward duck.

288
00:18:28,765 --> 00:18:30,593
- Excuse me, boring hippy lady.
- Uh-huh.

289
00:18:30,618 --> 00:18:32,238
Looks like the explodey
guy's gonna puke.

290
00:18:32,263 --> 00:18:34,039
And have you done this before?

291
00:18:34,064 --> 00:18:36,674
Uh, yes, I have.
But, usually not for free.

292
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:37,947
- Didn't think so.
- Awesome.

293
00:18:37,972 --> 00:18:39,523
And how are we
doing over here, Bomb?

294
00:18:39,548 --> 00:18:42,439
Doing wonderful.
Stretching out the core.

295
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:45,949
Just remember to breathe,
up to your feathers,

296
00:18:45,974 --> 00:18:50,218
and from your talons.

297
00:18:50,243 --> 00:18:51,678
Bomb?

298
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:57,668
Nice.

299
00:18:58,316 --> 00:18:59,893
I don't know what happened.

300
00:18:59,918 --> 00:19:02,957
I was doing the poses.
I was feeling all zen.

301
00:19:02,982 --> 00:19:04,748
Matilda was digging it!

302
00:19:04,773 --> 00:19:06,246
Then I lost my grip on it.

303
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:08,458
I let it slipped and
it just squeaked out.

304
00:19:08,483 --> 00:19:09,756
Hey.
So, where are we going?

305
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,294
I'm sorry.
We?

306
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,331
Yes, we.

307
00:19:12,356 --> 00:19:15,788
There's a new happiness exhibit
at the Museum of Happiness

308
00:19:15,813 --> 00:19:17,661
that I'm dying to see.

309
00:19:17,686 --> 00:19:20,080
Uh, you know what?
I... I mean I got a...

310
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:21,991
- I got a thing.
- A thing?

311
00:19:22,016 --> 00:19:23,278
Like a disease?

312
00:19:23,303 --> 00:19:25,209
Huh! Is it bird flu?
Chicken pox?

313
00:19:25,234 --> 00:19:26,551
Huh!
Cardinal sin?

314
00:19:26,576 --> 00:19:32,032
No. By thing, I mean like...
desire not to hang out, with you.

315
00:19:32,057 --> 00:19:33,400
Oh.

316
00:19:33,425 --> 00:19:35,278
Oh, yeah. Well, may... you know.
Maybe for the best, you know.

317
00:19:35,302 --> 00:19:37,951
Because... I got something too.

318
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,859
Ha!
How did I forget?

319
00:19:39,884 --> 00:19:43,448
Even if you'd say yes,
I probably couldn't have gone.

320
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:49,287
I'm busy too,
I have a...

321
00:19:49,312 --> 00:19:52,851
Business offer... deal
that is...

322
00:19:52,876 --> 00:19:54,764
No, Bomb.
You're not good at this, buddy.

323
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:58,573
It's-It's charming up to a point
and now it's just sad.

324
00:19:59,377 --> 00:20:01,491
It's a guy I know.

325
00:20:01,516 --> 00:20:08,365
And he's opening up a brand new
luxury class reunion.

326
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,829
Okay, good.
Good, good, good.

327
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:15,013
Looks like it's just us.
Want to go get a bite?

328
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:18,909
Oh, but what about your class reunion,
where everybody brings a business offer.

329
00:20:18,934 --> 00:20:22,970
Oh. No, no, no.
Chuck, I was lying.

330
00:20:22,995 --> 00:20:25,059
 I'm sorry if I've fooled you.

331
00:20:29,697 --> 00:20:31,987
Nah-uh.
No means no.

332
00:20:33,606 --> 00:20:35,611
I love your eye.

333
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:37,294
Cheers.

334
00:20:38,368 --> 00:20:39,972
- Hey!
- Huh?

335
00:20:39,997 --> 00:20:43,637
- Get over here!
- Hey, pecker heads.

336
00:20:43,662 --> 00:20:44,671
- What's up?
- Yo.

337
00:20:44,696 --> 00:20:45,959
Hey, man.

338
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,431
Oh.

339
00:20:52,303 --> 00:20:53,439
Oh.

340
00:20:53,464 --> 00:20:55,886
- Oh, I felt a peck.
- Whoa.

341
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,582
Ah...

342
00:21:13,863 --> 00:21:16,941
This is the legendary Mighty Eagle.

343
00:21:16,966 --> 00:21:21,868
Our protector and hero, but
no one has seen him for years.

344
00:21:21,893 --> 00:21:24,774
Mighty Eagle is missing.

345
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,138
When's Mighty Eagle
going to come back.

346
00:21:27,163 --> 00:21:29,428
Eyebrows, didn't your parents
ever tell you,

347
00:21:29,453 --> 00:21:31,133
Mighty Eagle isn't real?

348
00:21:31,158 --> 00:21:35,287
Shhh. He doesn't know that.
He doesn't have parents.

349
00:21:35,312 --> 00:21:38,664
- He does not have parents.
- Yeah, or even friends.

350
00:22:26,021 --> 00:22:29,424
Ah ha!
Eureka!

351
00:22:33,716 --> 00:22:34,962
Say bye to daddy.

352
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:36,294
- Bye bye!
- Bye bye!

353
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:37,984
- Goodbye, hatchlings.
 - Bye!

354
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:40,029
- Have a happy day.
- Bye.

355
00:22:40,054 --> 00:22:42,956
- Good morning.
- Morning, your Honor.

356
00:22:43,913 --> 00:22:45,405
Here you go.

357
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,815
- Ah-Choo!
- Bless you.

358
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,705
- Yes!
- Bye, daddy's making dinner.

359
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:00,869
If my name were Bobby,
would you ask about my hobbies.

360
00:23:00,894 --> 00:23:03,030
- Wow
- Or if my name were Judas,

361
00:23:03,055 --> 00:23:05,738
would you ask me
what my mood is?

362
00:23:05,763 --> 00:23:09,475
I laugh, I cry,
I love, I hate.

363
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:14,294
I do so much more
than detonate.

364
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:15,891
Think about it.

365
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:18,565
That was beautiful.

366
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,310
You're gonna make me cry.

367
00:23:20,335 --> 00:23:22,998
Yeah, that was some real
clever symbolism.

368
00:23:23,023 --> 00:23:25,835
Ah! Red, why don't
we hear you poem?

369
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,004
I don't have a poem.

370
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:28,635
Uh-huh.
Why not?

371
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,369
Because I didn't write one.

372
00:23:31,394 --> 00:23:34,557
Right, uh-huh.
And, is there a reason?

373
00:23:34,582 --> 00:23:36,092
Well. You know,
I was gonna do it.

374
00:23:36,117 --> 00:23:37,691
But then I thought about it,

375
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:40,722
and I realized,
"Oh, this is a huge waste of my time."

376
00:23:40,747 --> 00:23:42,411
So I didn't do it.

377
00:23:42,436 --> 00:23:46,272
Deep breath. Deep breath.
DEEP BREATH!

378
00:23:46,961 --> 00:23:49,569
And we're back in the now.
Chuck!

379
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,713
- You had your hand up the whole time.
- Um-Hm.

380
00:23:53,401 --> 00:23:56,890
My poem,
is about a hate crime.

381
00:23:58,273 --> 00:24:00,364
- How did it...?
- Oh oh.

382
00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:02,640
Oh no.

383
00:24:02,665 --> 00:24:04,866
A lot of sickos out there.
A lot of sickos.

384
00:24:04,891 --> 00:24:09,411
What? Oh what,
did I make you of?

385
00:24:09,436 --> 00:24:11,146
- I made you out of love.
- Oh.

386
00:24:11,171 --> 00:24:14,599
But, wait. Too late.
Now I see your fate.

387
00:24:14,624 --> 00:24:19,874
Some very troubled somebody
destroyed you out of hate.

388
00:24:21,371 --> 00:24:27,664
What could have made him so despised
your happy smile, your laughing eyes.

389
00:24:28,027 --> 00:24:31,083
Your soul was pure.
Your heart was true.

390
00:24:31,124 --> 00:24:35,863
And someone hated that.
But, who?

391
00:24:35,888 --> 00:24:37,322
Oh!

392
00:24:41,945 --> 00:24:43,384
Terence.

393
00:24:45,436 --> 00:24:46,740
Whoa!
<font color="#ff8080">[ HANG IN THERE ]</font>

394
00:24:46,765 --> 00:24:49,039
Yeah, I deserve that.
Oh.

395
00:24:49,064 --> 00:24:52,923
Billy has passed
to a high plane of existence.

396
00:24:52,948 --> 00:24:55,653
Everyone join wings.

397
00:24:55,684 --> 00:24:58,277
Let us,
all say our goodbyes.

398
00:24:58,302 --> 00:25:00,324
Yeah. Let me get in here,
I got to say goodbye...

399
00:25:00,349 --> 00:25:01,640
Okay.

400
00:25:02,897 --> 00:25:05,292
Okay. You know, I'll just mourn
from back here, that's fine.

401
00:25:05,317 --> 00:25:07,713
You know, if there is one thing
Billy always hated, it was goodbyes.

402
00:25:07,738 --> 00:25:09,543
Hey.
What's going on out there?

403
00:25:09,568 --> 00:25:11,111
Huh?

404
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:12,828
Class dismiss.

405
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,692
Very moving.

406
00:25:15,717 --> 00:25:17,072
Come on, everybody.
Let's go!

407
00:25:17,097 --> 00:25:18,611
Hey.
Where's everybody going?

408
00:25:18,636 --> 00:25:20,182
Hurry, something's coming!

409
00:25:20,207 --> 00:25:22,842
- Last one to the beach is a rotten egg!
- Let's go.

410
00:25:22,867 --> 00:25:25,032
Coming through. Pardon me.
Excuse me.

411
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:29,300
What?

412
00:25:32,632 --> 00:25:34,659
Aw.
Again?

413
00:25:34,684 --> 00:25:36,629
Let's get down to the beach!

414
00:25:36,654 --> 00:25:39,211
- Follow me.
- Let's get a better view.

415
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,193
What?

416
00:25:48,283 --> 00:25:49,285
Huh?

417
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,811
I didn't mean to photo bomb you,
sorry about it

418
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,870
What is that thing?

419
00:25:54,895 --> 00:25:58,998
It looks like an UFO.
An unidentified floating object.

420
00:25:59,023 --> 00:26:00,670
Daddy!

421
00:26:00,695 --> 00:26:03,492
Stop it.
No, I'm not your daddy.

422
00:26:03,786 --> 00:26:05,668
- What is that?
- Look at the size of that thing.

423
00:26:05,693 --> 00:26:07,000
Where is it going?

424
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:09,477
I don't know,
but it's not stopping.

425
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,758
My house.
My house.

426
00:26:15,397 --> 00:26:17,837
Slow down!
Stop!

427
00:26:24,615 --> 00:26:25,940
Oh.

428
00:26:28,652 --> 00:26:30,135
Phew.

429
00:26:33,185 --> 00:26:34,794
What the?

430
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:40,263
That house took me
5 years to build.

431
00:26:40,288 --> 00:26:41,353
Wow.

432
00:26:41,378 --> 00:26:45,759
It's such a shame when you create
something and someone just destroys it.

433
00:26:46,494 --> 00:26:49,506
Ladies and gentlemen.

434
00:26:49,531 --> 00:26:52,702
- We have a very special guest for you.
- Huh?

435
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:55,541
- He's a green marine sailing machine.
- Here we go.

436
00:26:55,566 --> 00:26:58,588
And he's keen to let you know,
he's not mean.

437
00:26:58,613 --> 00:27:03,680
Put your wings together for
Leonard!

438
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,900
Oh.
Thank you so much.

439
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:09,650
Please hold your applause.

440
00:27:09,675 --> 00:27:15,407
Greetings from my world,
the world of the pigs.

441
00:27:15,432 --> 00:27:17,171
What's a pig?

442
00:27:17,196 --> 00:27:20,247
I am a pig!

443
00:27:24,492 --> 00:27:27,353
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

444
00:27:28,437 --> 00:27:31,207
Oh, where're we going?
Wrong way.

445
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,351
Oopsie.
Not working.

446
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,700
We practiced this a hundred times.

447
00:27:35,725 --> 00:27:37,344
- Oh, man.
- Give it to me.

448
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:39,354
- Oh.
- We're gonna come in again.

449
00:27:39,379 --> 00:27:40,996
I'm so sorry.

450
00:27:43,821 --> 00:27:47,298
My name is Leonard,
but my friends call me Chuckles.

451
00:27:47,323 --> 00:27:49,684
- Oh, ho ho ho! Very generous.
- Yeah.

452
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:50,697
- Thank y...
- Oh.

453
00:27:50,722 --> 00:27:52,771
- We mean no harm.
- Aw. Ow.

454
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:56,824
We saw your island across the sea
and we thought,

455
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:58,339
"I wonder what they're up to?"

456
00:27:58,364 --> 00:28:00,989
But, there's no other place
besides here.

457
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:04,090
Yes, there is.
And we are from there.

458
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:06,521
We call it, Piggy Island.

459
00:28:06,546 --> 00:28:07,872
Oh my gosh.

460
00:28:07,897 --> 00:28:11,834
P-I-GG-Y Island.

461
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:13,339
Who else is out there?

462
00:28:13,364 --> 00:28:16,595
My first officer, Ross and I
have sailed everywhere.

463
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,388
One brave soul against the sea,
and Ross.

464
00:28:20,413 --> 00:28:21,625
Ah, excuse me.

465
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:25,068
Have you come to smash
all of our houses or just mine?

466
00:28:25,093 --> 00:28:28,491
- Oh, man.
- Ho ho. Somebody want a gift basket.

467
00:28:28,516 --> 00:28:31,100
Please. Please.
Don't be afraid.

468
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:34,669
My partner and I request
the honor of your friendship.

469
00:28:34,693 --> 00:28:36,958
- Ross, show them how'd we do it.
- Oh?

470
00:28:36,983 --> 00:28:39,262
Don't worry, he's had all his shots.

471
00:28:39,287 --> 00:28:41,145
- Well, I'll say now.
- Hi! Uhh!

472
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,574
Hi, friends.

473
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,346
Oh, not a hugger.

474
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:50,594
Welcome to Bird Island.

475
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:53,810
Welcome to our new friends,
the Pigs.

476
00:28:53,834 --> 00:28:56,993
- Let us have a celebration!
- Put it there!

477
00:28:57,019 --> 00:28:58,481
- Welcome
- Oh.

478
00:28:58,506 --> 00:28:59,707
What?
Sorry.

479
00:28:59,732 --> 00:29:00,898
And a hoof to a wing.

480
00:29:00,923 --> 00:29:04,852
We would like to honor the pig's
with a special performance.

481
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:11,384
Oh, watch out.
Shaking my bacon.

482
00:29:11,409 --> 00:29:12,579
They don't have feathers?

483
00:29:12,604 --> 00:29:15,867
You know, they're just walking around
naked just presenting themselves.

484
00:29:15,892 --> 00:29:17,738
I'm looking at all
their business here.

485
00:29:17,763 --> 00:29:19,445
That part about them,
I really admire.

486
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:23,278
Now we would like to welcome
our special guest, the PIGS!

487
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,161
- Yay.
- Alright.

488
00:29:25,186 --> 00:29:28,172
Thank you for your kindness
and hospitality.

489
00:29:28,197 --> 00:29:30,946
- Our king sends his warmest regards.
- King?

490
00:29:30,971 --> 00:29:36,150
You have shared with us the wonders
of your quaint simple little island.

491
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:38,319
Drop the banner, Ross!

492
00:29:38,763 --> 00:29:39,801
Ah!
Whoa!

493
00:29:39,826 --> 00:29:44,279
Now, we would love to humbly share
some of the wonders of our world.

494
00:29:44,304 --> 00:29:46,431
Ha! Yeah.
Humble my bird butt.

495
00:29:46,456 --> 00:29:47,497
Language.

496
00:29:47,522 --> 00:29:50,307
A 100 years from now,
everyone will ask,

497
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:54,457
"How do the friendship between
the pigs and the birds start?"

498
00:29:54,482 --> 00:29:55,744
Who cares!

499
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:57,212
- Oh no.
- Hey.

500
00:29:57,237 --> 00:30:00,813
Well, let them say us,
"We lite up the night!"

501
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,638
Holy moley!

502
00:30:07,415 --> 00:30:08,865
Yeah!
Woo-hoo!

503
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,817
Hey, look. They destroyed more of
the stuff we worked hard to build.

504
00:30:11,842 --> 00:30:13,790
- But, there's more!
- More?

505
00:30:13,815 --> 00:30:15,826
Has gravity gone haywire?

506
00:30:15,851 --> 00:30:20,905
No! Even better, your friends,
the pigs, proudly give you...

507
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:24,627
- The trampoline!
- Oh.

508
00:30:24,652 --> 00:30:25,926
Those are my assistance.

509
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:28,733
- Oinky and John Ham!
- Hello.

510
00:30:28,758 --> 00:30:32,144
Hey, hold on a second. I thought there's
only suppose to be 2 of these guys.

511
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:36,349
What goes?
Look at those jiggly pigglies!

512
00:30:36,374 --> 00:30:40,447
But, that's not all, throwing things
just got a whole lot easier.

513
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,415
Say hello to...

514
00:30:42,446 --> 00:30:45,348
- "The Slingshot!"
- Ta-da!

515
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,511
- I can't see.
- This is crazy.

516
00:30:47,538 --> 00:30:48,068
Wow!

517
00:30:48,093 --> 00:30:50,200
- Tired of carrying things from place to place?
- Yeah!

518
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:51,966
Wish you could just get it there?

519
00:30:51,991 --> 00:30:53,036
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

520
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:54,711
Well, now you can!

521
00:30:54,736 --> 00:30:56,153
- Waiters, do me a favor.
- Huh!

522
00:30:56,178 --> 00:30:57,681
- Take the rest of the night off.
- Okay.

523
00:30:57,706 --> 00:31:00,354
Hey, if you got the night off
why don't you fix my house.

524
00:31:00,379 --> 00:31:02,926
Yeah.
It's the same guy.

525
00:31:02,951 --> 00:31:07,405
Well, the slingshot does it all
in 3 easy steps.

526
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,119
Ready.
Aim!

527
00:31:09,143 --> 00:31:10,978
- Fire!
- I got it.

528
00:31:12,855 --> 00:31:15,582
- Floating fish!
- Me! Me! I want fruit!

529
00:31:15,686 --> 00:31:19,665
Guys. It's the same fruit sitting
on the plates in front of you.

530
00:31:22,592 --> 00:31:24,745
And now, for our
last gift to you.

531
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:27,295
Shut up and fix my house!

532
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,325
We don't know him.

533
00:31:29,635 --> 00:31:33,522
I'm going to ask for a volunteer
from the audience.

534
00:31:33,547 --> 00:31:34,552
- Me!
- Me!

535
00:31:34,577 --> 00:31:36,214
Who should I pick?

536
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:37,899
- Who, who, who.
- Pick me, Mr. Pig.

537
00:31:37,924 --> 00:31:40,719
How about the red guy,
with the enormous eyebrows?

538
00:31:40,744 --> 00:31:41,796
- Aw.
- Ha ha ha ha.

539
00:31:41,821 --> 00:31:43,629
- Me?
- Mm-hm.

540
00:31:43,654 --> 00:31:45,414
Oh.
No, no, no, no.

541
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:46,661
Yes, you sir.

542
00:31:46,686 --> 00:31:48,973
Come on up here,
it's your lucky day.

543
00:31:49,005 --> 00:31:50,467
Are you sure you don't
want to choose

544
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,340
one of the 100s of birds
that had their wings up?

545
00:31:52,365 --> 00:31:55,433
- Get him up here!
- Come on, Red. Have some fun!

546
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:57,199
- Go!
- Go!

547
00:31:57,224 --> 00:31:59,396
Oh, he's shy.

548
00:31:59,421 --> 00:32:01,416
You hear that?
They're cheering for you!

549
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:02,801
Aw.
You got to be kidding me.

550
00:32:02,826 --> 00:32:04,974
Red guy with the eyebrows!

551
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:06,750
I would have sat closer
had I known

552
00:32:06,775 --> 00:32:08,588
that I was going to be
part of the show.

553
00:32:08,619 --> 00:32:11,700
- Okay. Now what?
- Come on, give him a hand.

554
00:32:12,142 --> 00:32:14,671
Right this way, come on.
Relax, deep breathe.

555
00:32:14,696 --> 00:32:15,677
Ready!

556
00:32:15,702 --> 00:32:16,829
Who? Me?
Yeah. No. I'm ready.

557
00:32:16,854 --> 00:32:18,325
- Aim!
- Aim at what?

558
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,573
Everybody on this one.

559
00:32:19,598 --> 00:32:21,921
- Fire!
- Fire!

560
00:32:23,297 --> 00:32:25,323
Who says birds don't fly

561
00:32:25,348 --> 00:32:27,365
This seems really unnatural!

562
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,848
- Huh!
- Aw. I hope he's okay.

563
00:32:29,873 --> 00:32:31,106
Ow.

564
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,141
Hey, don't worry!
I'm fine!

565
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,756
Thanks for the lift!

566
00:32:41,781 --> 00:32:44,479
I wished they would have
done that 10 minutes ago.

567
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:48,377
Huh.

568
00:32:49,212 --> 00:32:51,533
You know you want to
search their boat.

569
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:53,822
What?
No, I don't.

570
00:32:54,085 --> 00:32:55,984
Yeah, you're right, I do.

571
00:32:56,491 --> 00:33:00,030
Bomb's on his way.
Mm. Mmm.

572
00:33:00,233 --> 00:33:02,807
Come on.
Let's go!

573
00:33:02,832 --> 00:33:05,315
And remember, keep it quiet.

574
00:33:06,062 --> 00:33:08,897
Oh, yeah.

575
00:33:11,112 --> 00:33:12,781
Whoa!
This is an impressive ship.

576
00:33:12,806 --> 00:33:15,814
Shh. No. Inside voice.
Inside voice. Come on.

577
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:18,134
Sorry.

578
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,822
Piggy fitness.

579
00:33:20,847 --> 00:33:21,941
- Mm?
- Nmm?

580
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:23,183
Mm-hm.

581
00:33:25,656 --> 00:33:27,437
<font color="#80ff80">FIFTY SHADES
OF GREEN</font>

582
00:33:27,462 --> 00:33:28,913
Ack!

583
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:36,241
Very strange.

584
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,169
- Huh?
- Aw!

585
00:33:40,765 --> 00:33:43,860
Who are these weirdos?
Huh?

586
00:33:48,911 --> 00:33:50,893
What are you doing,
we're trying to sneak around.

587
00:33:50,918 --> 00:33:52,216
We didn't rent this place out.

588
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:54,445
Wow, you can rent this place?

589
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,170
- Hm.
- Give me that!

590
00:33:59,739 --> 00:34:00,934
- Huh!
- Huh!

591
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:02,529
Hey, guys!

592
00:34:04,992 --> 00:34:07,962
Looks like there's some more
stuff down here.

593
00:34:13,221 --> 00:34:14,906
We were hiding.

594
00:34:17,964 --> 00:34:20,129
When I say "Hey."
You say "Ho."

595
00:34:20,154 --> 00:34:21,913
- Hey!
- Ho!

596
00:34:21,938 --> 00:34:23,360
- Hey!
- Ho!

597
00:34:23,385 --> 00:34:24,631
- Hey!
- Ho!

598
00:34:24,656 --> 00:34:26,434
There's more of them!

599
00:34:26,459 --> 00:34:29,123
- Hey!
- Ho...!

600
00:34:29,148 --> 00:34:31,457
That's right.
I'm back, uh-huh.

601
00:34:31,482 --> 00:34:33,099
Enjoying the party, everyone?

602
00:34:33,124 --> 00:34:38,488
Because while you were living it up,
I snuck up onto their boat.

603
00:34:38,513 --> 00:34:40,091
- What!
- What did he say?

604
00:34:40,116 --> 00:34:42,935
And look at what I found.

605
00:34:43,145 --> 00:34:45,366
There's more of them!
Than we thought.

606
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:48,388
Which is uh... mysterious and weird.
Am I right?

607
00:34:48,413 --> 00:34:49,794
Ho ho ho ho.
Ho ho.

608
00:34:49,819 --> 00:34:51,312
Hi.

609
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:52,877
- How're you doing?
- Oh.

610
00:34:52,902 --> 00:34:55,955
You remember. He said there
were only 2 pigs on board,

611
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,116
- but he was obviously lying.
- Hmm.

612
00:34:59,141 --> 00:35:02,351
Oh, and there's strange
devices on their boat!

613
00:35:02,376 --> 00:35:05,206
So clearly there's... you know,
some messed up stuff going on here.

614
00:35:05,231 --> 00:35:06,703
How messed up?
I don't know

615
00:35:06,728 --> 00:35:08,960
What's specifically?
I don't know that either.

616
00:35:08,985 --> 00:35:10,865
Any questions?

617
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,433
You snuck onto their boat?

618
00:35:15,457 --> 00:35:17,419
You know.
I don't need a award.

619
00:35:17,444 --> 00:35:19,865
If you guys are trying to think of
what honor to bestow upon me

620
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,463
- Don't need it.
- Boo!

621
00:35:21,488 --> 00:35:22,878
Yeah, boo them.

622
00:35:22,903 --> 00:35:24,307
- Boo!
- Boo.

623
00:35:24,332 --> 00:35:25,710
- You're booing them or me?
- You.

624
00:35:25,735 --> 00:35:27,117
Oh, it's me.

625
00:35:27,142 --> 00:35:29,767
Perhaps, I can explain.

626
00:35:29,792 --> 00:35:33,373
You see, my cousins
are simple folk.

627
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:37,409
Watch.
A, B, C...

628
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:40,024
Nothing.
See, nothing.

629
00:35:40,049 --> 00:35:41,826
I didn't want to risk their lives

630
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:45,384
until I found out that the...
the new world was safe.

631
00:35:45,408 --> 00:35:48,230
We were gonna put on
a cowboy show for you.

632
00:35:48,255 --> 00:35:52,133
Let her go, boys!
Yee-haw!

633
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:55,492
- Ha ha, yeah!
- Yoo!

634
00:35:55,517 --> 00:35:56,966
Shhh.

635
00:35:57,667 --> 00:35:59,428
Ixnay on the ongsay.

636
00:35:59,453 --> 00:36:00,954
- That was Piglatin.
- Oh.

637
00:36:00,979 --> 00:36:03,563
But perhaps,
it wasn't meant to be.

638
00:36:03,588 --> 00:36:04,313
Oh.

639
00:36:04,338 --> 00:36:08,493
I believe that birds and pigs
are meant to be friends.

640
00:36:08,518 --> 00:36:13,304
But if we crossed boundaries
that were not meant to be crossed...

641
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,221
- Oh.
- Oh.

642
00:36:15,246 --> 00:36:18,152
Mr. Red,
you shamed not only yourself,

643
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:20,272
but our entire community.

644
00:36:20,297 --> 00:36:21,709
Oh, I think you messed up there.

645
00:36:21,734 --> 00:36:23,786
You said shamed when
you meant saved, right?

646
00:36:23,811 --> 00:36:27,204
I sent you to treatment
to deal with your problems.

647
00:36:27,229 --> 00:36:29,837
Clearly, more treatment is required.

648
00:36:29,862 --> 00:36:31,239
- No!
- No!

649
00:36:31,264 --> 00:36:34,738
Do not trouble
our honored guests again!

650
00:36:34,763 --> 00:36:39,601
My friends, we would love
to see your cowboy show.

651
00:36:39,626 --> 00:36:42,542
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

652
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,910
Come on, everybody!
Put your hands together!

653
00:36:44,935 --> 00:36:46,022
- Woo-Hoo!
- Yeah!

654
00:36:46,047 --> 00:36:47,924
Whatever.
Don't listen to me.

655
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:50,849
Body train coming through.
Choo-choo.

656
00:36:59,863 --> 00:37:02,532
Ah! I can't see.
I can't see.

657
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:04,122
Whoa!

658
00:37:23,402 --> 00:37:24,813
- This is fun!
- Piggyback rides?

659
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:26,795
Yee-haw!
Let's move it there.

660
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,740
Oh boy.

661
00:37:27,765 --> 00:37:29,725
Group picture.
Group picture.

662
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,229
Everybody say cheese.

663
00:37:31,254 --> 00:37:32,548
-Cheese...
- Cheese.

664
00:37:32,573 --> 00:37:34,838
- ... omelet.
- Cheese omelet.

665
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,221
Woo.
Spoiler alert.

666
00:37:38,246 --> 00:37:39,972
- Hello.
- Jump!

667
00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:52,409
- I am famish... Whoa.
- It's chow time!

668
00:37:56,265 --> 00:37:57,660
Yuck.

669
00:37:57,685 --> 00:38:01,408
Hanging tough through thick and thin.

670
00:38:04,459 --> 00:38:06,164
Yeah!

671
00:38:06,502 --> 00:38:07,830
Ow!

672
00:38:08,594 --> 00:38:09,977
What?

673
00:38:15,963 --> 00:38:17,922
What the heck?

674
00:38:17,947 --> 00:38:20,493
Who invited you to move in?

675
00:38:20,518 --> 00:38:22,867
Hey! Whoa!
That's my toothbrush.

676
00:38:22,892 --> 00:38:24,192
Get it out!

677
00:38:24,217 --> 00:38:26,806
- Woo!
- Yee-haw!

678
00:38:30,398 --> 00:38:31,673
Huh?

679
00:38:38,209 --> 00:38:40,123
Alright, class.
Thought for the day.

680
00:38:40,148 --> 00:38:42,064
"Water is the softest thing,

681
00:38:42,089 --> 00:38:46,029
yet it can penetrate
mountains and earth.

682
00:38:46,054 --> 00:38:47,967
Here's my thought of the day,
"When are we done?"

683
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,241
Aw.
Red.

684
00:38:49,266 --> 00:38:53,490
What the caterpillar calls the end,
the world calls a butterfly.

685
00:38:53,515 --> 00:38:57,319
Can I just say, I never understand
a single thing you are talking about.

686
00:39:03,496 --> 00:39:06,230
Wow, that's very life like.

687
00:39:06,255 --> 00:39:08,307
Ah...!
Ha ha!

688
00:39:08,332 --> 00:39:10,408
- Woo. Ho ho ho.
- So deep.

689
00:39:10,433 --> 00:39:13,042
And Terence, let's see your...

690
00:39:13,067 --> 00:39:16,136
Oh, my goodness.

691
00:39:16,161 --> 00:39:18,784
I did not know
you felt that way.

692
00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:20,055
Uh.
Class dismiss.

693
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:24,027
And now, we've come
to the prestigious Palm Cistern.

694
00:39:24,052 --> 00:39:26,451
Where birds of all feathers
flock together

695
00:39:26,476 --> 00:39:28,857
for the 8 kinds of
fruit and nut trees.

696
00:39:28,882 --> 00:39:31,311
Suck those bellies in.
Instaham!

697
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:33,813
Hmm.
Is that what I think it is?

698
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:36,990
That's an egg.
That's how our children are born.

699
00:39:37,015 --> 00:39:39,605
You guys don't lay eggs?

700
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:42,862
Aye.
Wished we did.

701
00:39:44,752 --> 00:39:46,868
Enchanté.

702
00:39:48,911 --> 00:39:52,578
You look delicious, my dear.

703
00:40:03,856 --> 00:40:05,798
That's us.

704
00:40:09,351 --> 00:40:11,731
Hey! Hello!
Excuse me. Buddy?

705
00:40:11,756 --> 00:40:12,861
Those are fragile.

706
00:40:12,886 --> 00:40:14,682
Maybe you shouldn't pick them up, alright?
Not yours.

707
00:40:14,707 --> 00:40:17,792
Oh.
My friend from the banquet.

708
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,532
Now that's a very good painting.
Very good.

709
00:40:20,556 --> 00:40:21,718
Oh.
Yeah uh.

710
00:40:21,743 --> 00:40:25,869
The assignment was, "Paint your pain."
So I... painted your pain.

711
00:40:25,894 --> 00:40:28,090
It's actually the first
in a series.

712
00:40:28,115 --> 00:40:29,562
- Here you go.
- Uh-huh.

713
00:40:29,587 --> 00:40:31,210
- This one is nice.
- Oh.

714
00:40:31,242 --> 00:40:34,076
I call this one, "Catharsis."

715
00:40:34,393 --> 00:40:37,824
And, oh, I call this one,
"Bye bye."

716
00:40:37,848 --> 00:40:39,451
Wonderful likeness.

717
00:40:39,476 --> 00:40:42,359
I thought you said you stored
your nuts for winter.

718
00:40:42,384 --> 00:40:44,475
- Ha ha ha...
- Burn.

719
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,717
Alright, what's going on here?

720
00:40:45,742 --> 00:40:47,874
Are you explorers
or are you staying?

721
00:40:47,899 --> 00:40:51,129
Because if you are explorers, then
why are there more of you coming, huh?

722
00:40:51,154 --> 00:40:53,237
Hi there, everybody!

723
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:59,158
Not my house again.
Tha-That's my home.

724
00:40:59,183 --> 00:41:00,684
And you know what?
If you are staying,

725
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:02,689
why don't you just say so?
And why did you leave your home?

726
00:41:02,714 --> 00:41:04,951
How do we know you're not
fugitives of the law?

727
00:41:04,976 --> 00:41:07,581
You are making our guests
feel unwelcome.

728
00:41:07,606 --> 00:41:09,703
And you're not asking
basic questions!

729
00:41:09,728 --> 00:41:13,586
Maybe I wasn't clear enough.
Your opinion is not needed!

730
00:41:13,611 --> 00:41:14,754
Why do we have to agree?

731
00:41:14,779 --> 00:41:16,241
Why does it matter that
we're not the same?

732
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:19,586
Anger, is not always the answer!

733
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:20,985
Continue the tour.

734
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:22,912
Umm.
Surfs up, you guys.

735
00:41:22,937 --> 00:41:26,449
- So, get ready to hang loose.
- That went well, if you're me.

736
00:41:26,474 --> 00:41:27,763
Ha ha ha...

737
00:41:27,788 --> 00:41:29,198
Dummy.

738
00:41:33,377 --> 00:41:35,995
We could really use you
right about now.

739
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,234
Wait.
Actually...

740
00:41:39,141 --> 00:41:42,068
Hey, Chuck.
It's Red, zip on down here.

741
00:41:43,445 --> 00:41:47,389
Oh. Hey, Chuck's mom,
can your son come out to play?

742
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:51,542
All of this, does not
just happen on it's own.

743
00:41:53,713 --> 00:41:55,682
BOMB'S
SHELTER

744
00:41:55,882 --> 00:41:58,627
Oh, hey.
Just taking a shower.

745
00:41:58,652 --> 00:42:00,710
- Bomb, buddy, TMI.
- Ah ha ha!

746
00:42:00,735 --> 00:42:04,444
Now, I'm telling you.
Something isn't kosher with these pigs.

747
00:42:04,469 --> 00:42:06,991
And it's up to us
to figure it out.

748
00:42:07,016 --> 00:42:08,572
Figure what out exactly?

749
00:42:08,597 --> 00:42:10,392
I don't know.
Maybe they are just being innovative.

750
00:42:10,417 --> 00:42:12,997
- Go ahead.
- All aboard.

751
00:42:13,659 --> 00:42:15,742
It does seem a little odd though.

752
00:42:18,532 --> 00:42:20,364
- Weee!
- Nailed it.

753
00:42:20,389 --> 00:42:22,109
Flawless.

754
00:42:22,134 --> 00:42:25,192
Come on. Does none of this
seem wrong to you guys?

755
00:42:25,427 --> 00:42:28,241
I'll tell you this, if anyone knows
what these pigs are up to,

756
00:42:28,266 --> 00:42:30,485
- Hey!
- it's Mighty Eagle.

757
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:33,819
MIGHTY EAGLE!

758
00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:36,375
Oh yeah.

759
00:42:45,417 --> 00:42:47,215
Take that, tree.

760
00:42:47,318 --> 00:42:49,091
Eat my foot.

761
00:42:50,661 --> 00:42:52,969
Tasty.
Yum yum yum.

762
00:42:55,598 --> 00:42:56,634
Whoa.

763
00:42:56,659 --> 00:42:59,602
MIGHTY EAGLE!

764
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,372
Peek-a-boo.

765
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:06,104
Hello, Bird Island!

766
00:43:10,819 --> 00:43:13,313
Mighty Eagle xo
- Heh heh, you're welcome.

767
00:43:14,143 --> 00:43:16,954
- Does Mighty Eagle still live?
- Did he ever lived.

768
00:43:16,979 --> 00:43:18,593
And if he did live,
where would he live?

769
00:43:18,618 --> 00:43:21,454
By the Lake of Wisdom
in the ancient tree.

770
00:43:21,488 --> 00:43:22,637
It's a fairy tale.

771
00:43:22,662 --> 00:43:25,360
I've run all over this island,
where could that possibly be?

772
00:43:25,385 --> 00:43:27,789
Way up high.

773
00:43:29,513 --> 00:43:33,619
It's a long up that mountain,
and if I'm being honest...

774
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:35,734
Well. I mean, you know,
I can kind of use your help.

775
00:43:35,758 --> 00:43:37,453
What's that?
What are you trying to say?

776
00:43:37,478 --> 00:43:40,199
Nothing. I was just saying that I can
you know, I can use your help.

777
00:43:40,224 --> 00:43:42,645
Oh. I'm sorry, I couldn't quite
hear you over your ego.

778
00:43:42,669 --> 00:43:44,640
Could you enunciate
that last word a little bit.

779
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:46,063
I need your help!

780
00:43:46,088 --> 00:43:48,873
Oh.
Why didn't you say so?

781
00:43:48,913 --> 00:43:52,014
- Bomb?
- Let's... do it!

782
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,380
Oh gosh.

783
00:43:56,405 --> 00:43:58,192
If there is a Mighty Eagle,

784
00:43:58,217 --> 00:44:00,835
well, how come we don't
ever hear his battle cry?

785
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,988
- I don't know.
- Maybe we have.

786
00:44:03,013 --> 00:44:05,595
What would a Mighty Eagle
battle cry sound like?

787
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,957
You know what?
I think I got an idea.

788
00:44:06,982 --> 00:44:08,848
Maybe it's something like...

789
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,579
No!
That's more like...

790
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:16,605
That's theoretically what
it's more like, scientifically.

791
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:17,874
Oh, I got one.

792
00:44:22,544 --> 00:44:24,201
Not bad.
It's a good impression.

793
00:44:24,226 --> 00:44:27,791
But, in my head, I'm kind of
imagining it something more like a...

794
00:44:34,793 --> 00:44:36,072
That sounds about right.

795
00:44:36,097 --> 00:44:38,223
No. I'm thinking it maybe
it's a little bit more subtle.

796
00:44:38,248 --> 00:44:40,893
Like a little bit,
just more majestic like...

797
00:44:55,219 --> 00:44:57,972
- I'm cAlling for yOu!
- I'm coming foR You so OpeN your door!

798
00:44:57,997 --> 00:45:00,827
Stop making Mighty Eagle noises!

799
00:45:00,852 --> 00:45:03,829
It's like running a nursery.
Absolute childcare.

800
00:45:03,856 --> 00:45:07,796
Someone has anger issues.

801
00:45:13,007 --> 00:45:16,241
This uh.
This is the wrong mountain.

802
00:45:18,151 --> 00:45:20,055
My calves are killing me.

803
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,785
Aw!

804
00:45:47,053 --> 00:45:48,793
- Oh, wow.
- Whoa.

805
00:45:48,818 --> 00:45:51,389
That is simply unreal.

806
00:45:51,414 --> 00:45:53,572
The Lake of Wisdom.

807
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:59,530
What are you guys waiting for?

808
00:46:01,231 --> 00:46:02,953
Guys, hurry up!

809
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:06,707
This is what Mama talked about.

810
00:46:07,458 --> 00:46:09,375
Wow.

811
00:46:13,707 --> 00:46:16,603
Ah. Be honest.
Do I sound any wiser?

812
00:46:16,628 --> 00:46:18,394
Oh, way wiser.

813
00:46:18,419 --> 00:46:20,613
You were kind of dumb before,
I can say that now.

814
00:46:20,638 --> 00:46:22,391
That water is no joke.

815
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:25,961
I can literally taste the
intelligence and wisdom...

816
00:46:25,986 --> 00:46:28,740
- ... circulating through my body now.
- Hey, guys. Nobody's here.

817
00:46:28,765 --> 00:46:31,512
I mean, nobody's used
this place in years.

818
00:46:32,695 --> 00:46:34,451
What are you doing?

819
00:46:35,173 --> 00:46:37,017
Get out of there!

820
00:46:43,797 --> 00:46:45,401
Aww.

821
00:46:46,788 --> 00:46:48,548
Don't spit in his mouth!

822
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:50,916
No, don't spit it back!

823
00:46:51,154 --> 00:46:53,024
Uh, don't swallow it.

824
00:46:53,049 --> 00:46:55,724
Ew.
Ack.

825
00:47:04,486 --> 00:47:05,796
Whoa!

826
00:47:07,228 --> 00:47:09,453
Get out. Let's go.
Come on.

827
00:47:09,478 --> 00:47:11,643
Shh, shh, Bomb.
Take your time, will you.

828
00:47:11,668 --> 00:47:13,276
Red.
I found the meaning of life.

829
00:47:13,301 --> 00:47:15,587
- It's...
- Shut your worm hole!

830
00:47:36,667 --> 00:47:39,393
Oh, wow, it's him.

831
00:48:04,063 --> 00:48:05,770
Oh man.

832
00:48:13,747 --> 00:48:17,706
No, no, no.
Ack!

833
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:21,811
Horrible turn of events, horrible.

834
00:48:37,212 --> 00:48:38,447
Well.

835
00:48:38,472 --> 00:48:41,523
Not so much the Lake of Wisdom,
it's more like the Lake of Wizz.

836
00:48:41,548 --> 00:48:45,081
Did you just come here
to look at me?

837
00:48:45,106 --> 00:48:48,796
Or did you have
something to say?

838
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:52,148
- I think he saw us.
- Oh, you think so?

839
00:48:53,395 --> 00:48:56,153
You have passed the first test!

840
00:48:56,178 --> 00:48:57,954
You have found me.

841
00:48:57,994 --> 00:48:59,194
- Whoa!
- Look out. Whoa!

842
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:03,026
Behold.
Gaze upon.

843
00:49:03,051 --> 00:49:07,339
Mighty Eagle!

844
00:49:10,225 --> 00:49:14,237
I see all and know all.

845
00:49:14,262 --> 00:49:16,658
- What are your names?
- If you know all,

846
00:49:16,683 --> 00:49:18,540
why don't you know where we are?

847
00:49:18,565 --> 00:49:19,578
Ow!

848
00:49:19,603 --> 00:49:22,004
I know very well
who you are.

849
00:49:22,029 --> 00:49:27,000
You are lost souls, who have
come here, seeking wisdom.

850
00:49:27,025 --> 00:49:29,255
- Whoa!
- Can we have some?

851
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,347
Wisdom is not something
that is given.

852
00:49:33,372 --> 00:49:36,475
It is something that is...
attain.

853
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,929
Okay.
Goodbye.

854
00:49:37,954 --> 00:49:41,277
No no no...
Will I help you attain wisdom?

855
00:49:41,302 --> 00:49:42,909
- Whoa! Ha ha!
- Yes!

856
00:49:42,934 --> 00:49:44,955
That, I will do.

857
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,554
Right. So, the reason we've climbed
the mountain is that we want to know...

858
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:49,590
- Prepare!
- Okay.

859
00:49:49,615 --> 00:49:52,900
... to have your minds Blown.

860
00:49:52,925 --> 00:49:54,478
Aw!
Son of a...

861
00:49:54,503 --> 00:49:56,644
This guy is good.

862
00:49:56,669 --> 00:49:59,948
Welcome, to the Hall of Heroism.

863
00:49:59,973 --> 00:50:02,801
Wow.
It's really amazing to meet you.

864
00:50:02,826 --> 00:50:04,788
You know, I actually
have your poster up uh...

865
00:50:04,813 --> 00:50:09,172
You might want to shield your eyes
from the sprinkle of those trophies.

866
00:50:09,197 --> 00:50:10,818
How many?
I have no idea.

867
00:50:10,843 --> 00:50:12,813
Countless, I'm sure.
13.

868
00:50:12,838 --> 00:50:16,052
Wow. This is way nicer than
my Hall of Wimpiness.

869
00:50:16,077 --> 00:50:18,568
Bring it home, mamacita.

870
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:21,345
Get out of town.
Ha ha ha ha!

871
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:22,914
What the?

872
00:50:31,095 --> 00:50:33,001
Those are some
old school moves there.

873
00:50:33,026 --> 00:50:34,732
Yeah.

874
00:50:38,927 --> 00:50:40,071
What?

875
00:50:40,096 --> 00:50:41,416
...
Wow.

876
00:50:41,714 --> 00:50:43,222
YES!

877
00:50:43,247 --> 00:50:44,391
Yeah.

878
00:50:47,297 --> 00:50:49,006
So, he's kind of a wackadoodle.

879
00:50:49,031 --> 00:50:51,551
That, you know,
it doesn't mean he's not wise.

880
00:50:54,115 --> 00:50:57,171
Hey. Are you tired of filling
your balloons with heavy old air?

881
00:50:57,196 --> 00:50:59,379
Finally, there's a better way.

882
00:50:59,404 --> 00:51:00,595
- Helium.
- Helium.

883
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,378
It's a gas.

884
00:51:02,403 --> 00:51:04,716
Aw.
Don't worry about your balloon.

885
00:51:04,741 --> 00:51:08,690
It will just land in the ocean.
The fish love it.

886
00:51:08,715 --> 00:51:11,093
It's good for their tummy.

887
00:51:14,507 --> 00:51:16,226
Free party.
Free party.

888
00:51:16,251 --> 00:51:19,307
It's going to be the
piggiest party of the year.

889
00:51:19,591 --> 00:51:21,765
Party!
Get a bird sitter.

890
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:23,396
Let's go, piggies.

891
00:51:23,421 --> 00:51:26,130
Well now, that,
is some fine handy work.

892
00:51:26,155 --> 00:51:28,303
- Hey, judge, you're under arrest.
- What?

893
00:51:28,329 --> 00:51:29,985
For looking too good.

894
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:31,236
Hello.
What about me?

895
00:51:31,261 --> 00:51:34,043
Do I get a plus one?
Oh! Thank you.

896
00:51:34,068 --> 00:51:35,671
Let me see.
Let me see.

897
00:51:35,696 --> 00:51:38,358
Ah-choo!
Oh, that was a wet one.

898
00:51:44,757 --> 00:51:46,903
- Ooo.
- Ooo.

899
00:51:46,928 --> 00:51:50,108
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

900
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,662
Almost there.
Don't rush me.

901
00:51:53,812 --> 00:51:57,176
- Oop. Slow down there.
- Deep breath. Deep breath.

902
00:51:58,441 --> 00:52:00,154
And we're back.
And now...

903
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:01,871
Who's ready for trust falls?

904
00:52:01,903 --> 00:52:03,616
- I got you.
- No no no no no.

905
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:11,513
Mighty Mighty Eagle soaring free.

906
00:52:11,538 --> 00:52:16,028
Defender of our homes and liberty.

907
00:52:16,053 --> 00:52:20,703
Bravery, humility, and honesty.

908
00:52:20,728 --> 00:52:24,696
You must have grown up
singing this song in school.

909
00:52:24,721 --> 00:52:27,225
Uhh.
Yeah.

910
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:30,850
- Yes, we did.
- Um. Right. Yeah.

911
00:52:30,996 --> 00:52:37,473
Mighty, Mighty Eagle, rescue me.

912
00:52:37,498 --> 00:52:39,706
Now you do the second verse.

913
00:52:39,731 --> 00:52:41,891
- Uh. I.. I...
- Come on.

914
00:52:41,916 --> 00:52:43,624
- Me?
- Yes.

915
00:52:43,649 --> 00:52:46,356
Do it.

916
00:52:46,381 --> 00:52:50,386
- Mighty, Mighty Eagle flap your wings.
- Oh yeah!

917
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:53,938
And fill up your big cave
with all your fancy things.

918
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:54,848
That's it.

919
00:52:54,873 --> 00:52:57,377
- Politeness, Good sportsmanship.
- That's no me.

920
00:52:57,402 --> 00:52:59,397
- and the long attention span.
- What?

921
00:52:59,422 --> 00:53:03,653
Mighty, Mighty Eagle, yeah.

922
00:53:03,678 --> 00:53:05,478
Take it away, Charles.

923
00:53:05,503 --> 00:53:09,520
Oh great heroic Mighty Eagle.

924
00:53:09,545 --> 00:53:15,078
- With finer plumage than a sea gull.
- Oh, sing it.

925
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:20,891
Uh.
Ambidexterity, pottery,

926
00:53:20,916 --> 00:53:23,201
- ... and bankruptcy
- Ouch.

927
00:53:23,226 --> 00:53:27,601
Mighty, Mighty Eagle...
Harmonize. Harmonize.

928
00:53:27,626 --> 00:53:33,077
- Rescue me.
- Rescue me.

929
00:53:37,618 --> 00:53:40,569
Wow.
You know it better than me.

930
00:53:40,594 --> 00:53:44,748
So, anyway, the other day,
these pigs showed up out of nowhere.

931
00:53:44,773 --> 00:53:47,342
And, it caused me
a great deal of suspicion.

932
00:53:47,367 --> 00:53:49,788
And he's walking
out of the room.

933
00:53:49,813 --> 00:53:51,402
Unbelie...
I don't get this.

934
00:53:51,427 --> 00:53:53,381
This guy sits here on
his butt, all alone.

935
00:53:53,406 --> 00:53:54,889
clearly doesn't leave the house.

936
00:53:54,914 --> 00:53:58,093
He talk's a good game, but, he
doesn't care about anyone but himself.

937
00:53:58,118 --> 00:53:59,717
Sounds a lot like you.

938
00:53:59,742 --> 00:54:03,018
Oh good.
Thank you for your opinion, Chuck.

939
00:54:06,734 --> 00:54:08,016
Well, hello.

940
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:10,518
- Hello. Mighty Eagle.
- What?

941
00:54:10,543 --> 00:54:12,104
- What are you doing?
- Uh.

942
00:54:12,129 --> 00:54:14,871
- I am bird watching.
- What?

943
00:54:15,301 --> 00:54:17,110
- Ah.
- Take a peek.

944
00:54:19,739 --> 00:54:22,476
- Oh you're disgusting
- Oh yeah.

945
00:54:22,501 --> 00:54:24,517
Look.
Are you gonna help us or not?

946
00:54:24,542 --> 00:54:26,898
- I am helping you!
- No. This is you helping.

947
00:54:26,923 --> 00:54:29,283
Looking through binoculars.
Spying on old ladies.

948
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:31,031
Whoa, whoa.
What is that?

949
00:54:32,145 --> 00:54:33,869
Wait.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

950
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:37,645
Oh my.

951
00:54:37,854 --> 00:54:40,380
Huh!
I was right.

952
00:54:40,405 --> 00:54:41,986
I was right.
I knew it!

953
00:54:42,011 --> 00:54:43,771
Bomb, Chuck, hurry up!
Get out here!

954
00:54:43,796 --> 00:54:44,877
Oh oh.

955
00:54:44,902 --> 00:54:47,913
Mighty Eagle, hey.
Fly us down there, now.

956
00:54:52,057 --> 00:54:54,036
- No.
- I'm sorry. What?

957
00:54:54,061 --> 00:54:56,380
I don't do that anymore.
I'm retired.

958
00:54:56,405 --> 00:54:57,828
Mostly just tired.

959
00:54:57,853 --> 00:54:59,043
Go handle it yourself.

960
00:54:59,074 --> 00:55:02,227
This is everything
I've prepared you for.

961
00:55:02,252 --> 00:55:03,860
What?
Prepared us for?

962
00:55:03,885 --> 00:55:05,211
Hold on.
Did I missed something?

963
00:55:05,236 --> 00:55:07,146
Let me just go through
my notes really quick. Let's see.

964
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:09,640
Crazy stuff, bragging,
crazy stuff, karaoke.

965
00:55:09,665 --> 00:55:12,200
No. See, I don't see
anything useful here.

966
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:15,498
The whole world,
everyone we know, is in danger.

967
00:55:15,523 --> 00:55:17,106
Yes, it is.

968
00:55:17,131 --> 00:55:20,103
- So, off you go.
- Hey. You know what?

969
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,063
I used to believe in you.

970
00:55:24,069 --> 00:55:27,393
When I was a kid, I believed
nothing really bad could ever happen

971
00:55:27,418 --> 00:55:29,006
because you were here.

972
00:55:29,031 --> 00:55:33,189
And now I see the fate of
the world hangs on idiots like me.

973
00:55:33,214 --> 00:55:37,173
And that, sir,
is sort of terrifying.

974
00:55:37,716 --> 00:55:39,622
It's time for you to go.

975
00:55:39,647 --> 00:55:43,057
You know, it's really upsetting to me
that you're the only bird that can fly.

976
00:55:43,082 --> 00:55:45,055
And you're too afraid to do it.

977
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,834
- Huh!
- Huh?

978
00:55:46,865 --> 00:55:49,181
Hey, guys. Come on, let's go.
We're done here. He's no hero.

979
00:55:49,206 --> 00:55:51,386
So, uh, I'm having
a party next Tuesday.

980
00:55:51,411 --> 00:55:53,817
Could you just
do a little pop in?

981
00:55:58,367 --> 00:56:00,696
Come on, run faster!

982
00:56:00,721 --> 00:56:01,683
- Whoa!
- Ah!

983
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:03,580
- Ow. Ow. Ow.
- Whoa!

984
00:56:06,456 --> 00:56:08,513
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Let's go!

985
00:56:09,635 --> 00:56:11,472
- Woo!
- Yeah!

986
00:56:11,913 --> 00:56:13,013
- Woo.
- Woo.

987
00:56:13,038 --> 00:56:14,964
I love this song.

988
00:56:19,244 --> 00:56:23,468
I sentence you all
to 4 hours of hard partying.

989
00:56:25,797 --> 00:56:27,459
Look out below!

990
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:28,643
- Huh?
- Huh?

991
00:56:28,668 --> 00:56:32,305
- Huh! They're taking the eggs!
- Follow them.

992
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,995
Gangway!

993
00:56:38,683 --> 00:56:40,717
Oh man.

994
00:56:48,625 --> 00:56:53,932
Right on time. Excellent.
Ah ha ha... !

995
00:56:53,957 --> 00:56:56,037
Chuck, go shut
that party down, now!

996
00:56:56,062 --> 00:56:59,113
Ee. But I only know
how to get party STARTED.

997
00:56:59,138 --> 00:57:00,440
- Go!
- On it.

998
00:57:00,465 --> 00:57:02,823
- Bomb, we got to stop them.
- Yeah!

999
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:09,711
Got to get more speeeeed!

1000
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:12,309
Ah!
Whoa!

1001
00:57:12,334 --> 00:57:14,800
It's Chuck time!

1002
00:57:15,485 --> 00:57:17,263
Get to the ship!

1003
00:57:21,474 --> 00:57:22,739
Eggs.

1004
00:57:25,554 --> 00:57:30,182
Can everybody please stop partying?
There are eggs being stolen!

1005
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:33,660
Matilda, we need your help.

1006
00:57:33,685 --> 00:57:35,704
- The pigs are stealing our eggs!
- What?

1007
00:57:35,729 --> 00:57:38,527
- I'm airborne!
- We have to get back to the village!

1008
00:57:38,552 --> 00:57:39,216
Whoa!

1009
00:57:39,241 --> 00:57:42,350
Stop dancing and start running!

1010
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:45,170
Huh!
Hors d'oeuvres, my weakness.

1011
00:57:45,401 --> 00:57:47,719
Come on, let's wrap it up.

1012
00:57:47,849 --> 00:57:49,919
- We got to get the eggs off the ship!
- Yeah, let's go!

1013
00:57:49,944 --> 00:57:51,443
- Is everyone on board?
- Let's go. Let's go!

1014
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,533
Use the trampolines!

1015
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:56,470
Can you get up there?

1016
00:57:56,495 --> 00:57:58,025
We got an intruder!

1017
00:57:58,050 --> 00:57:59,573
What the heck are they doing?

1018
00:57:59,598 --> 00:58:01,749
Untie the ropes.
Drop the eggs in the water.

1019
00:58:01,774 --> 00:58:05,383
Get rid of them.
Get him off of there.

1020
00:58:05,725 --> 00:58:07,886
It's too strong,
I can't break it.

1021
00:58:07,911 --> 00:58:10,499
Huh!
Bomb, blow off the chain.

1022
00:58:10,717 --> 00:58:12,441
Knock them down!

1023
00:58:13,461 --> 00:58:15,449
Come on, Bomb.
You can do this.

1024
00:58:17,838 --> 00:58:19,417
Come on, Bomb.
You got this.

1025
00:58:19,442 --> 00:58:21,540
- Blow up.
- You got to get me mad.

1026
00:58:21,565 --> 00:58:23,404
Okay. Well then,
what makes you mad?

1027
00:58:23,429 --> 00:58:26,151
Try insulting me
on a personal level.

1028
00:58:26,178 --> 00:58:28,829
Oh, oh, uh.
Your poetry stinks!

1029
00:58:28,854 --> 00:58:31,115
You're just a bad poet.
And you know it!

1030
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,734
Oh. I know.
I know!

1031
00:58:33,759 --> 00:58:36,225
Hey.
Who wants a birdie bath?

1032
00:58:44,065 --> 00:58:46,161
Oh. I'm sorry, Red.
I couldn't do it.

1033
00:58:46,186 --> 00:58:47,997
Don't give up.
This isn't over!

1034
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:50,589
Thanks for your hospitality.

1035
00:58:50,614 --> 00:58:53,581
- Ha ha ha... !
- Yeah.

1036
00:58:53,606 --> 00:58:56,809
Set sail for Piggy Island!

1037
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:03,335
- Huh!
- Huh!

1038
00:59:15,488 --> 00:59:18,849
<font color="#ff8080">WORLD MAP
BIRD ISLAND</font>

1039
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,651
Huh!
Oh no!

1040
00:59:30,676 --> 00:59:32,401
We'll find them

1041
00:59:32,426 --> 00:59:34,624
Oh.
Oh.

1042
00:59:34,649 --> 00:59:38,587
Oh.
They're all gone.

1043
00:59:39,014 --> 00:59:40,620
<font color="#ff8040">DAYCARE</font>

1044
00:59:41,442 --> 00:59:43,957
Shh, shh.
It's okay.

1045
00:59:50,233 --> 00:59:52,351
Mr. Red!

1046
00:59:57,944 --> 01:00:00,233
What do we do now?

1047
01:00:00,816 --> 01:00:02,421
Wait, hold on.
You're asking me?

1048
01:00:02,446 --> 01:00:05,363
You knew.
You try to tell us.

1049
01:00:05,388 --> 01:00:07,585
But we didn't listen.

1050
01:00:07,789 --> 01:00:10,850
I didn't hear

1051
01:00:11,559 --> 01:00:13,426
Red, we need a leader.

1052
01:00:13,451 --> 01:00:15,142
- What do we do now?
- What do we do?

1053
01:00:15,167 --> 01:00:17,402
Wait a minute.
I'm not a leader.

1054
01:00:17,427 --> 01:00:19,501
Okay. Pigs stole our kids.
That sucks.

1055
01:00:19,526 --> 01:00:22,810
Made all you guys looked like idiots.
You know what we got to do?

1056
01:00:22,835 --> 01:00:25,773
We start replacing those kids.

1057
01:00:25,798 --> 01:00:28,560
Ladies, get busy!

1058
01:00:28,585 --> 01:00:30,684
We're going to be laying
some eggs tonight!

1059
01:00:30,709 --> 01:00:32,513
No. No, stop.
No no no...

1060
01:00:32,538 --> 01:00:34,511
We're not going to
replace those kids.

1061
01:00:34,536 --> 01:00:37,556
- We're gonna get them back.
- How are we going to do that?

1062
01:00:37,581 --> 01:00:40,258
What do you mean how?
The pigs already showed us how.

1063
01:00:40,557 --> 01:00:42,399
That, is where they went!

1064
01:00:42,424 --> 01:00:44,834
And, so that,
is where we are going!

1065
01:00:44,859 --> 01:00:47,005
But how do we get from here
to there?

1066
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:48,998
I'm not aquatic,
in the least.

1067
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:51,315
Well.
You know

1068
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:53,073
We're gonna build our own boat.

1069
01:00:53,098 --> 01:00:54,540
- Huh?
- What are you talking about?

1070
01:00:54,565 --> 01:00:56,329
They stole your kids.

1071
01:00:56,354 --> 01:01:00,449
No. They stole our kids.
I mean, who does that?

1072
01:01:00,474 --> 01:01:03,018
Have you ever stolen
any one's children?

1073
01:01:03,043 --> 01:01:05,396
Huh?
Have you?

1074
01:01:05,626 --> 01:01:07,483
I mean, you look like you would.

1075
01:01:07,508 --> 01:01:10,251
And you know what?
I'm a little bit angry.

1076
01:01:10,276 --> 01:01:13,036
Correction.
I'm really angry.

1077
01:01:13,061 --> 01:01:15,095
And I don't think
I'm the only one.

1078
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:18,680
Come on, we're birds!
We're descendants from dinosaurs!

1079
01:01:18,705 --> 01:01:21,478
We're not supposed to be nice!
Right?

1080
01:01:25,159 --> 01:01:28,074
Uh.
Yeah, point-point made.

1081
01:01:28,099 --> 01:01:29,595
- Who else here is angry?
- I! -I!

1082
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:31,776
- I am.
- Yeah, you are!

1083
01:01:31,801 --> 01:01:34,536
We're getting our kids back,
and I don't need any

1084
01:01:34,561 --> 01:01:37,407
- ... calm, detach, happy birds.
- No.

1085
01:01:37,432 --> 01:01:39,405
Not going to help us.
Don't need it.

1086
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:43,044
I need some angry flocking birds.

1087
01:01:43,069 --> 01:01:44,899
You hear me!
Now, who's angry!

1088
01:01:44,924 --> 01:01:46,286
- Yeah!
- Angry!

1089
01:01:46,311 --> 01:01:47,931
Well, let's go!

1090
01:01:47,956 --> 01:01:50,492
Bring me everything that floats.

1091
01:01:50,517 --> 01:01:52,386
Yeah. Yeah.
That's perfect, yeah.

1092
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:04,351
With every single feather
of my being,

1093
01:02:04,376 --> 01:02:08,987
I am not going to let any of these
eggs be taken from their parents.

1094
01:02:18,051 --> 01:02:19,793
Chuck, I need you to
tie those crates together.

1095
01:02:19,818 --> 01:02:21,147
You got it.

1096
01:02:21,896 --> 01:02:24,458
- Done, and done.
- Uh. A little help here?

1097
01:02:24,483 --> 01:02:26,161
Let's go!
Move it, everybody!

1098
01:02:26,186 --> 01:02:28,063
- Push with your upper body.
- Put your back into it.

1099
01:02:28,088 --> 01:02:30,874
I have no upper body!

1100
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:33,272
Darn good for a bunch of birds.

1101
01:02:33,297 --> 01:02:36,450
- Woo! Woo!
- Yay!

1102
01:02:45,785 --> 01:02:47,171
Go Leonard!

1103
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:50,440
When I say, "Eat the".
You say, "eggs."

1104
01:02:50,465 --> 01:02:53,849
- Eat the.
- Eggs!

1105
01:02:53,874 --> 01:02:55,749
Wow, what a reception.

1106
01:02:55,774 --> 01:02:58,317
Alright, snouts up!

1107
01:02:59,529 --> 01:03:03,628
My, it's a snout staircase.
Who thinks of that?

1108
01:03:04,706 --> 01:03:09,770
Welcome home,
King Mudbeard!

1109
01:03:11,741 --> 01:03:16,145
My father, and my father's father,
and my weird Aunt Chloe,

1110
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:18,402
have all searched for the eggs.

1111
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:20,530
But only I,

1112
01:03:20,555 --> 01:03:23,833
- King Mudbeard, have found them.
- Oh. My pom-pom.

1113
01:03:23,858 --> 01:03:27,328
I present to you,
the EGGS!

1114
01:03:30,256 --> 01:03:31,776
Say goodbye to Harvey.

1115
01:03:31,801 --> 01:03:33,600
- A feast!
- Huh!

1116
01:03:33,625 --> 01:03:36,896
I proclaim a feast!
2 nights heads.

1117
01:03:36,921 --> 01:03:38,241
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1118
01:03:38,266 --> 01:03:39,666
- I ♥ cholesterol!
- Let's EAT.

1119
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:42,690
Let's go make some omelets!

1120
01:03:51,265 --> 01:03:54,007
Oh. I feel a little nervous inside,
but that's normal, right?

1121
01:03:54,032 --> 01:03:56,344
Yeah.
Yeah, I think so.

1122
01:03:57,592 --> 01:04:00,389
Uh. Anybody else got
butterflies in the stomach?

1123
01:04:00,414 --> 01:04:01,431
Yeah.

1124
01:04:01,456 --> 01:04:03,932
Probably because you ate
too many caterpillars.

1125
01:04:06,161 --> 01:04:08,708
Drop your nuts
and move your butts!

1126
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:11,154
Come on, let's go!

1127
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:18,849
- Oh no.
- Whoa.

1128
01:04:20,334 --> 01:04:22,801
I wasn't expecting this.

1129
01:04:25,575 --> 01:04:27,303
Well.
Hold on a second.

1130
01:04:27,328 --> 01:04:29,522
That guy is the king?

1131
01:04:29,742 --> 01:04:32,278
He's got to have the eggs
with him in the castle.

1132
01:04:32,303 --> 01:04:34,288
- What the heck is a castle?
- And that's where we're going.

1133
01:04:34,313 --> 01:04:37,826
Hey, guys. Do you remember
everything you learned in my class?

1134
01:04:37,851 --> 01:04:38,949
- Yep.
- Nope.

1135
01:04:38,974 --> 01:04:41,107
- What class?
- Well, forget all of it for now.

1136
01:04:41,132 --> 01:04:42,931
Now it's time to let loose.

1137
01:04:42,956 --> 01:04:44,840
Oh good.
Because I never learn anything anyway.

1138
01:04:44,865 --> 01:04:46,652
Oh, me neither.
I actually just came to socialize.

1139
01:04:46,677 --> 01:04:47,996
I came for the snacks.

1140
01:04:48,021 --> 01:04:50,165
You don't happen to have
any of it now, do you?

1141
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:52,204
Deep breath. Deep breath.
DEEP BREATH.

1142
01:04:52,229 --> 01:04:54,740
How are we going to
get over those walls?

1143
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:56,064
Uh.

1144
01:04:56,850 --> 01:05:00,287
I'll tell you how.
We're gonna fly.

1145
01:05:00,692 --> 01:05:02,635
Remember.
The goal is the castle.

1146
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:05,448
Get to the castle.
Who wants to go first?

1147
01:05:05,473 --> 01:05:06,806
- Over here!
- I do!

1148
01:05:06,831 --> 01:05:09,228
- Me. Me. Me.
- Hey. Alright, Matilda.

1149
01:05:09,253 --> 01:05:10,867
Always a brides-space.

1150
01:05:10,892 --> 01:05:12,993
Step right up.
Keep your wings, legs and beak

1151
01:05:13,018 --> 01:05:14,556
- inside the slingshot at all times.
- Shoot it!

1152
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:16,741
Okey-doke.
Fire!

1153
01:05:20,134 --> 01:05:21,685
And one,
and a whoa...

1154
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:23,021
Take that, porkers!

1155
01:05:23,046 --> 01:05:25,047
Incoming!

1156
01:05:25,374 --> 01:05:27,869
Boom, baby, boom!

1157
01:05:27,894 --> 01:05:30,727
Well, how about that? My teacher
can shoot fireballs out of her butt.

1158
01:05:30,752 --> 01:05:32,228
You, what's your name?
Hal?

1159
01:05:32,253 --> 01:05:33,759
I've seen you do something
strange before, right?

1160
01:05:33,784 --> 01:05:34,766
Well, let's see.

1161
01:05:34,791 --> 01:05:38,228
- I'm really good at...
- It doesn't matter. Launch him.

1162
01:05:38,948 --> 01:05:40,829
Oh, this guys looks good.

1163
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:42,561
He's gonna make it.

1164
01:05:43,129 --> 01:05:46,336
This is incredible.
We're witnessing history right now.

1165
01:05:46,361 --> 01:05:47,829
No, he's coming back.

1166
01:05:47,854 --> 01:05:49,021
- He's coming, duck.
- Whoa whoa whoa...

1167
01:05:49,046 --> 01:05:50,711
Get down.
DUCK!

1168
01:05:50,736 --> 01:05:52,399
Whoa whoa whoa...

1169
01:05:52,424 --> 01:05:54,304
Uh.
Did we win?

1170
01:05:54,329 --> 01:05:56,042
Uh, no.
Not quite yet, buddy.

1171
01:05:56,067 --> 01:05:59,190
Uh, we're still tied.
Hey, can we get an ice pack for Hal?

1172
01:05:59,215 --> 01:06:01,433
- Medic!
- Alright. Who's up next!

1173
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:03,122
Whoa whoa whoa...
What can you do?

1174
01:06:03,147 --> 01:06:05,013
Ah-choo!

1175
01:06:05,038 --> 01:06:08,367
- Uh... Yuck.
- Uh, need a tissue?

1176
01:06:13,749 --> 01:06:17,445
Calvin Swine.

1177
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:19,942
Who's next?
We need flyers, not standbyers!

1178
01:06:19,967 --> 01:06:21,295
Let's go!

1179
01:06:21,453 --> 01:06:24,391
You go out there and you show them
how frightening mimes can be.

1180
01:06:24,416 --> 01:06:25,412
Yeah!

1181
01:06:25,437 --> 01:06:27,326
Oh my gosh!

1182
01:06:27,351 --> 01:06:29,925
We're having a feast.
We're eating the eggs.

1183
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:33,477
Going to have a big feast.
Going to eat all the eggs.

1184
01:06:33,502 --> 01:06:35,616
Huh?
What?

1185
01:06:36,585 --> 01:06:38,494
- What is that?
- Whoa!

1186
01:06:40,985 --> 01:06:42,115
Fire!

1187
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:44,078
That guy again.

1188
01:06:44,103 --> 01:06:46,712
HAMNESTY INTERNATIONAL
- Citizens of Pig Island.

1189
01:06:46,737 --> 01:06:49,756
If you spot any birds
destroying your neighbourhood,

1190
01:06:49,781 --> 01:06:52,624
- please capture them.
- What did he say?

1191
01:06:52,648 --> 01:06:57,392
There's been a change of plan.
We will eat the eggs for lunch.

1192
01:06:57,417 --> 01:07:00,274
Did he say eat the eggs?

1193
01:07:11,187 --> 01:07:13,691
Okay. I want you to curl up
into a little ball, alright?

1194
01:07:13,716 --> 01:07:16,382
- Make yourself aerodynamic.
- Like this?

1195
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:17,904
To the left!
To the left!

1196
01:07:17,929 --> 01:07:19,841
- Let me at em!
- Launch!

1197
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:26,223
Don't mess with Bubbles!

1198
01:07:26,822 --> 01:07:30,512
- Get him!
- Heat pile. Hog pile.

1199
01:07:30,641 --> 01:07:33,483
I TOLD YOU
NOT TO MESS WITH ME!

1200
01:07:33,508 --> 01:07:36,663
Wow, that blows.
Uh, in a good way.

1201
01:07:36,688 --> 01:07:38,339
- To the left!
- Oh. Hold on, wait.

1202
01:07:38,364 --> 01:07:40,031
My left of your left?

1203
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:43,305
My left is your left.
We are facing the same direction.

1204
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:44,427
Right.
Good call.

1205
01:07:44,452 --> 01:07:47,492
Just look where the last bird went
and adjust from there.

1206
01:07:47,517 --> 01:07:49,894
- I got this, you guys.
- Alright.

1207
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:11,006
She got far,
but not far enough.

1208
01:08:11,031 --> 01:08:12,458
- Get her out of our town!
- Oh oh.

1209
01:08:12,483 --> 01:08:14,957
We have to get closer.

1210
01:08:15,783 --> 01:08:19,827
Judge power!

1211
01:08:22,778 --> 01:08:24,705
Trial by fire!

1212
01:08:24,745 --> 01:08:28,205
No, literally he's on fire right now.
Can somebody please help him?

1213
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:42,767
Mighty Eagle!

1214
01:08:49,666 --> 01:08:51,905
Terence.
I got an idea.

1215
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:54,254
Do you think you can pull
the slingshot back far enough

1216
01:08:54,279 --> 01:08:56,227
to hit that giant boulder?

1217
01:08:56,252 --> 01:08:59,686
Okay. Launch me right towards
the top of that thing.

1218
01:09:02,666 --> 01:09:04,233
Ready.

1219
01:09:05,438 --> 01:09:07,830
Red, I'm not going to lie to you.
I am...

1220
01:09:08,204 --> 01:09:10,104
... going to miss you
when you die.

1221
01:09:10,129 --> 01:09:13,249
Rest in peace, my friend.
Rest in peace.

1222
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:15,525
Hey, guys.
Let's not get cheesy, okay?

1223
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:17,826
Ready.
Fire!

1224
01:09:25,519 --> 01:09:27,365
This is gonna hurt.

1225
01:09:28,263 --> 01:09:30,315
What was that?
Huh?

1226
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:32,768
- My roof!
- Oh oh.

1227
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:36,101
- Did he make it?
- I hope he's okay.

1228
01:09:36,273 --> 01:09:40,035
- I'm in!
- Yeah. I knew he would make it.

1229
01:09:41,426 --> 01:09:43,751
Send everyone else!

1230
01:09:43,776 --> 01:09:47,438
Guards!
There's a red bird in these walls.

1231
01:09:47,463 --> 01:09:49,136
Bring him to me.

1232
01:09:49,161 --> 01:09:51,268
- Aye aye, sir.
- Roger that, boss.

1233
01:09:53,241 --> 01:09:55,094
Not in these walls.

1234
01:09:55,119 --> 01:09:57,227
In the castle!
Come on, you guys.

1235
01:09:57,252 --> 01:10:00,104
Here, pretty bird.
Here, pretty bird.

1236
01:10:03,516 --> 01:10:06,117
Transport the eggs!

1237
01:10:11,242 --> 01:10:12,585
<font color="#ff8080">NO EGGS
IN HERE</font>

1238
01:10:12,711 --> 01:10:15,914
Launch me exactly the same way
you did for Red...!

1239
01:10:15,939 --> 01:10:20,256
I wasn't ready!
Uh, faster!

1240
01:10:35,497 --> 01:10:36,962
Chuck, is that you?

1241
01:10:36,987 --> 01:10:39,373
Is this the house of horrors?

1242
01:10:39,398 --> 01:10:41,487
I got to be honest.
You look a little... fine.

1243
01:10:41,512 --> 01:10:44,742
- You look fine, come on.
- Bomb's on his way.

1244
01:10:50,154 --> 01:10:51,802
Ouchy.

1245
01:10:51,827 --> 01:10:55,381
Ah! Ha!
Call in the Piggy Air Force!

1246
01:10:55,406 --> 01:10:56,954
What is that?

1247
01:10:58,057 --> 01:11:00,039
My loyal subjects.

1248
01:11:00,071 --> 01:11:03,181
The treacherous birds
have repaid our friendship

1249
01:11:03,206 --> 01:11:06,031
with an unprovoked act of aggression!

1250
01:11:06,056 --> 01:11:08,186
The attack will fail!

1251
01:11:08,211 --> 01:11:13,015
We have glass! We have wood!
We have TNT.

1252
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:17,335
We tried to kill them with kindness
and now we're just gonna have to...

1253
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,396
Well, you know.

1254
01:11:19,421 --> 01:11:21,185
Run!

1255
01:11:22,872 --> 01:11:24,858
Who's gonna go next?

1256
01:11:31,058 --> 01:11:32,653
Aim for that ram.

1257
01:11:32,678 --> 01:11:33,836
- Yes.
- Yeah!

1258
01:11:33,861 --> 01:11:38,871
- Terence.
- Terence.

1259
01:11:39,006 --> 01:11:40,428
Get them!

1260
01:11:43,584 --> 01:11:45,973
- No.
- What happened?

1261
01:11:49,379 --> 01:11:51,512
No eggs in here.
No. Nope. No. No.

1262
01:11:51,537 --> 01:11:53,827
Hey! Whoa.
I'm on this.

1263
01:11:55,859 --> 01:11:57,890
Red-rum.

1264
01:11:57,916 --> 01:12:00,478
Uh.
Never mind.

1265
01:12:02,512 --> 01:12:04,367
Backup engine.

1266
01:12:09,128 --> 01:12:10,741
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Wait. Hold on a second.

1267
01:12:10,766 --> 01:12:12,459
Wait, I know that rear end.
That's Bomb.

1268
01:12:12,484 --> 01:12:15,217
Yeah. Chuck, that's not his rear end.
That's his face, man.

1269
01:12:15,249 --> 01:12:16,858
- Sorry, Bomb.
- No problem.

1270
01:12:16,883 --> 01:12:18,750
It's a shaky week.

1271
01:12:18,775 --> 01:12:20,144
Thanks for getting me out.

1272
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:26,790
- We want egg!
- We want egg!

1273
01:12:28,363 --> 01:12:30,883
He was sick.
But, then he got cured.

1274
01:12:31,273 --> 01:12:34,736
No eggs in... huh!
Ooo, these are clever pigs.

1275
01:12:34,761 --> 01:12:37,127
Okay, look. I'm gonna run up
and tackle the pig on the left.

1276
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:40,030
Bomb, you can handle too.
Chuck, I don't know if you can help?

1277
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:44,778
We got to figure out a way
to get into that room...

1278
01:12:52,029 --> 01:12:53,311
<font color="#ff8080">FART
FACE</font>

1279
01:13:02,848 --> 01:13:05,508
... room
Anyone have any bright ideas?

1280
01:13:08,767 --> 01:13:12,921
- Uh. Huh?
- You are gonna pay for that.

1281
01:13:13,895 --> 01:13:15,208
What just happened?

1282
01:13:15,233 --> 01:13:17,468
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were saying.

1283
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:19,737
And here we are?

1284
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:21,665
We found them!
Oh oh.

1285
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:23,720
Oh, come on

1286
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:28,316
- Red!
- Guys, come on!

1287
01:13:28,341 --> 01:13:29,880
Quick, follow him.

1288
01:13:30,283 --> 01:13:33,265
Things are looking sunny side up!

1289
01:13:33,603 --> 01:13:35,701
Guys, I'm here.
Everything is going to be okay.

1290
01:13:35,726 --> 01:13:37,291
- We are gonna get you out of here.
- Hurry up, Bomb!

1291
01:13:37,316 --> 01:13:38,615
- Come on!
- I'm coming!

1292
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,593
Don't lose me!

1293
01:13:40,618 --> 01:13:42,355
Goodness, they made a harem!

1294
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:44,030
Oh boy.

1295
01:13:44,055 --> 01:13:46,072
- We want egg!
- We want egg!

1296
01:13:46,097 --> 01:13:50,299
What is he doing up there?
This is a civilize buffet.

1297
01:13:57,076 --> 01:13:59,899
Don't hatch now.
Do not hatch now.

1298
01:13:59,924 --> 01:14:02,089
Get that red skank off my eggs.

1299
01:14:02,114 --> 01:14:04,101
- Hey!
- Oh man.

1300
01:14:04,126 --> 01:14:07,056
- Bomb, are you okay?
- Oh, I've been better.

1301
01:14:08,211 --> 01:14:10,352
I'm going to get
a running start!

1302
01:14:11,508 --> 01:14:14,477
- It's show time!
- Oh.

1303
01:14:14,502 --> 01:14:16,549
Fine.
Boil him too!

1304
01:14:16,574 --> 01:14:18,429
Let's pig out.

1305
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,927
Looks like it's just
you and me, pork belly!

1306
01:14:20,952 --> 01:14:22,245
I'll be taking that!

1307
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:24,418
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa.

1308
01:14:27,228 --> 01:14:30,684
- Hey? Oh.
- No!

1309
01:14:33,247 --> 01:14:35,944
- We're coming.
- Deep breath.

1310
01:14:40,683 --> 01:14:43,603
Ow! I'm in!
Classy joint.

1311
01:14:43,628 --> 01:14:45,385
- HELLO!
- Huh!

1312
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:48,650
- Where is everyone?
- Mighty Eagle. Where's he going?

1313
01:14:48,675 --> 01:14:50,998
I can't believe
I'm about to do this.

1314
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:55,631
Oh, my battle cry?

1315
01:14:58,068 --> 01:14:59,852
Coming in.
Coming in.

1316
01:14:59,877 --> 01:15:03,915
Mighty Eagle!

1317
01:15:07,937 --> 01:15:09,206
Oh oh.

1318
01:15:09,231 --> 01:15:11,072
Whoa!

1319
01:15:18,433 --> 01:15:20,840
Mighty-Mighty Eagle.
Might Eagle, wake up, come on.

1320
01:15:20,865 --> 01:15:22,111
Oh, that's bad breath.

1321
01:15:22,136 --> 01:15:25,488
I can sleep late, Mom.
It's not a school day.

1322
01:15:25,512 --> 01:15:29,397
Throw him in the pot too.
I'll have the big turkey.

1323
01:15:32,122 --> 01:15:33,760
- Red!
- What!

1324
01:15:33,785 --> 01:15:35,778
- Huh!
- Whoa! What did I miss.

1325
01:15:35,803 --> 01:15:38,383
- You got to fly those eggs to safety.
- I got this.

1326
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:40,241
Here we go!

1327
01:15:43,522 --> 01:15:47,415
- Whoa. Whoooaaa.
- Yes! Yes. Yes!

1328
01:15:50,831 --> 01:15:52,051
My eggs!

1329
01:15:52,076 --> 01:15:54,312
- Don't forget Chuck and Bomb.
- Who?

1330
01:15:54,337 --> 01:15:56,697
- Those guys.
- Right. Right.

1331
01:15:57,946 --> 01:15:59,602
Got you.

1332
01:16:05,138 --> 01:16:07,466
You're not getting away that easy.

1333
01:16:10,915 --> 01:16:12,419
No!

1334
01:16:17,315 --> 01:16:18,948
- Save yourselves.
- Hold on, Red!

1335
01:16:18,973 --> 01:16:21,847
- I'm gonna save that egg.
- Red, don't be a hero.

1336
01:16:21,872 --> 01:16:24,319
- Red, no.
- No!

1337
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:28,939
Huh?

1338
01:16:28,964 --> 01:16:32,118
- Get out of town, everybody.
- Whoa.

1339
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,406
There's just so many of them,
we're outnumbered.

1340
01:16:35,431 --> 01:16:37,276
What?
How many?

1341
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:38,933
Oh, not that many.
Just the right amount really.

1342
01:16:38,958 --> 01:16:40,788
No need to look back.
Just keep flying.

1343
01:16:40,813 --> 01:16:42,471
FASTER!

1344
01:16:42,619 --> 01:16:45,403
- I'll take that!
- No, you won't!

1345
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:47,268
Give me that!

1346
01:16:49,817 --> 01:16:52,165
You just don't know
when to stop, do you?

1347
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:54,498
Here's a 2 word answer,
"Uh-uh!"

1348
01:16:54,523 --> 01:16:57,730
Looks like your little
slingshot game ends here.

1349
01:16:57,755 --> 01:16:59,868
- Give me that!
- Not going to happen!

1350
01:16:59,893 --> 01:17:01,189
Huh!

1351
01:17:02,736 --> 01:17:04,048
Oh no.

1352
01:17:05,103 --> 01:17:06,867
Get out of my way.

1353
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:11,658
- Every pig for himself.
- I quit!

1354
01:17:11,683 --> 01:17:15,901
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1355
01:17:15,926 --> 01:17:18,933
I know what I got to do.
I got to blow up that ram.

1356
01:17:18,958 --> 01:17:21,705
And that would be a good plan
if you were good at blowing up.

1357
01:17:21,730 --> 01:17:23,385
I need to stop those planes!

1358
01:17:23,410 --> 01:17:25,376
Remember me, Chuck.
Remember me.

1359
01:17:25,401 --> 01:17:28,073
Bomb's away!

1360
01:17:32,956 --> 01:17:35,817
- Oh, hi there.
- Here, chicky chicky chicky.

1361
01:17:35,842 --> 01:17:38,032
This little piggy popped!

1362
01:17:38,057 --> 01:17:40,239
This little piggy exploded.

1363
01:17:40,264 --> 01:17:42,641
And this little piggy went
wee, wee, wee,

1364
01:17:42,666 --> 01:17:44,951
"I want my mother!"

1365
01:17:47,839 --> 01:17:49,939
Come on, Bomb,
you can you do this!

1366
01:17:49,964 --> 01:17:52,363
Blow up.
Blow up.

1367
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:56,594
- Oh oh.
- Ah ha ha ha!

1368
01:17:56,619 --> 01:17:58,775
Oh no.

1369
01:17:59,384 --> 01:18:02,971
Think explosive thoughts.
Surprise parties!

1370
01:18:03,837 --> 01:18:05,878
Yoga poses!

1371
01:18:06,751 --> 01:18:09,484
PIG CITY AIRPLANES!

1372
01:18:14,043 --> 01:18:17,178
I blew up, on purpose!

1373
01:18:17,311 --> 01:18:19,521
You're wrecking my house.
What's wrong with you?

1374
01:18:19,546 --> 01:18:21,993
- You wrecked my house!
- Your house was ugly!

1375
01:18:22,018 --> 01:18:23,994
Well, now we're even.

1376
01:18:30,678 --> 01:18:32,206
Strike!

1377
01:18:34,385 --> 01:18:36,181
Run!
Run!

1378
01:18:38,866 --> 01:18:40,961
Guys, look out!

1379
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:44,509
Everyone, stand back!

1380
01:18:50,019 --> 01:18:51,519
Terence?

1381
01:18:51,807 --> 01:18:54,832
Put on your seat belts, everyone.
Trust me.

1382
01:18:59,871 --> 01:19:03,108
Well.
This is dynamite.

1383
01:19:10,048 --> 01:19:11,386
Aw.
There you are.

1384
01:19:11,411 --> 01:19:14,319
Not by the hair on
my chinny-chin-chin!

1385
01:19:17,495 --> 01:19:20,296
Delicious bird eggy wiggy.
Ooo.

1386
01:19:20,321 --> 01:19:21,722
You can't eat eggs!

1387
01:19:21,747 --> 01:19:24,198
What are you going to do?
I'm a foodie.

1388
01:19:27,326 --> 01:19:29,748
It's over.
You're finished, eyebrows.

1389
01:19:29,773 --> 01:19:32,188
Ah ha ha ha...!

1390
01:19:34,516 --> 01:19:38,197
Anger, is not always the answer!

1391
01:19:39,884 --> 01:19:43,344
Well, you know what,
I guess you win.

1392
01:19:43,369 --> 01:19:44,834
What?

1393
01:19:45,257 --> 01:19:48,797
That was an awesome plan.
Mind blower.

1394
01:19:49,384 --> 01:19:51,746
Really?
Well, thank you.

1395
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:55,080
You know, a lot of hard work
goes in my sinister plans.

1396
01:19:55,105 --> 01:19:56,598
It does.

1397
01:19:58,150 --> 01:20:00,156
No, I mean your plan was great.

1398
01:20:00,181 --> 01:20:02,727
But you didn't plan for THIS!

1399
01:20:19,557 --> 01:20:22,469
You have annoyed me
for the last time.

1400
01:20:22,494 --> 01:20:23,811
Yep.

1401
01:20:24,006 --> 01:20:25,273
Huh?

1402
01:20:27,911 --> 01:20:29,729
FASTER!

1403
01:20:29,754 --> 01:20:31,751
Whoa!

1404
01:20:41,411 --> 01:20:43,641
Cramp.
Cramp.

1405
01:20:44,252 --> 01:20:46,052
- It's them!
- Look at that.

1406
01:20:46,077 --> 01:20:47,718
Are you seeing
what I am seeing?

1407
01:20:47,743 --> 01:20:49,536
- It's Mighty Eagle.
- It's him!

1408
01:20:49,561 --> 01:20:51,803
Well. This guy looks
nothing like his statue.

1409
01:20:51,828 --> 01:20:54,352
- Honey.
- Our eggs!

1410
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:10,024
- Are you okay?
- Chuck, my man.

1411
01:21:10,049 --> 01:21:12,462
- Did you see what I did back there?
- Yeah.

1412
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:16,922
Oh.
This egg is a splitting image of you.

1413
01:21:16,947 --> 01:21:20,013
There, safe and sound.

1414
01:21:27,112 --> 01:21:28,410
- Oh!
- Huh!

1415
01:21:28,435 --> 01:21:30,742
- Where is he?
- Red.

1416
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:33,249
Where is he?

1417
01:21:42,271 --> 01:21:43,360
Huh!

1418
01:21:43,385 --> 01:21:45,973
I think he might be dead.

1419
01:21:59,762 --> 01:22:01,852
Daddy!

1420
01:22:02,047 --> 01:22:05,711
- He's alive!
- He's alive!

1421
01:22:05,736 --> 01:22:07,538
Woo-hoo!

1422
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:15,633
- Oh!
- What?

1423
01:22:23,746 --> 01:22:25,171
- Yeah!
- Oh ho ho!

1424
01:22:25,196 --> 01:22:26,720
I'm glad you're alive.

1425
01:22:26,745 --> 01:22:29,606
I thought you died
or defected to the pig's side.

1426
01:22:29,631 --> 01:22:32,490
- Hey, buddy, way to not be dead.
- Oh.

1427
01:22:32,515 --> 01:22:35,370
- It's good to see you guys.
- Come on.

1428
01:22:36,556 --> 01:22:39,780
- Yay!
- Yay!

1429
01:22:39,896 --> 01:22:42,422
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- Glad you're back!

1430
01:22:42,642 --> 01:22:46,110
- You did it, great job!
- You're the bird!

1431
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,162
Sir.
Ma'am.

1432
01:22:54,416 --> 01:22:56,639
I think these belong to you.

1433
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:59,354
Oh.
Oh.

1434
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:06,113
Thank you.

1435
01:23:06,894 --> 01:23:10,040
Oh, Crimson, Woody, Ash.

1436
01:23:10,065 --> 01:23:11,508
- Who?
- Is he talking to us?

1437
01:23:11,533 --> 01:23:13,909
You learn your lessons well.

1438
01:23:13,934 --> 01:23:16,167
Come on, bring it in.

1439
01:23:16,346 --> 01:23:17,876
No.
I'm not the really affectionate type.

1440
01:23:17,901 --> 01:23:20,102
Uh.
Okay

1441
01:23:20,127 --> 01:23:22,732
Does it feel like this is
crossing the line, anyone else?

1442
01:23:22,757 --> 01:23:24,968
- Yep.
- No.

1443
01:23:25,206 --> 01:23:28,033
- You're my prize pupils.
- Your prize what?

1444
01:23:28,058 --> 01:23:29,855
Ho ho, don't you see?

1445
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,246
I had to make you
lose faith in me.

1446
01:23:32,271 --> 01:23:34,755
So you can learn to have
faith in yourself.

1447
01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:37,559
- That's not really how it felt.
- Tell them, Rosie.

1448
01:23:37,584 --> 01:23:39,522
Yeah. I don't think
that's what happened, man.

1449
01:23:39,547 --> 01:23:42,836
Oh look, he's blushing.

1450
01:23:43,133 --> 01:23:46,137
I'm not blushing,
I'm just red.

1451
01:23:49,351 --> 01:23:52,462
Okay, who wants an autograph?

1452
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:02,122
Go get him.

1453
01:24:02,147 --> 01:24:03,413
Hoist it up.

1454
01:24:03,842 --> 01:24:05,257
Nice.

1459
01:24:17,945 --> 01:24:19,998
Well done indeed.

1460
01:24:23,066 --> 01:24:25,911
Wow.
Is that you right there, Red?

1461
01:24:25,936 --> 01:24:27,201
Aw, really?
Where?

1462
01:24:27,226 --> 01:24:30,186
No, they didn't have to...
Oh. Yeah.

1463
01:24:30,211 --> 01:24:33,385
That's funny. I don't remember
crying on my knees like that.

1464
01:24:33,410 --> 01:24:35,660
But, you know,
it's nice.

1465
01:24:35,685 --> 01:24:38,982
Look at that.
They gave Mighty Eagle all the credit.

1466
01:24:39,007 --> 01:24:42,003
They made him look so much
more handsome than you.

1467
01:24:42,028 --> 01:24:44,292
You know,
back when I was angry.

1468
01:24:44,317 --> 01:24:46,358
That would have
really ticked me off.

1469
01:24:46,383 --> 01:24:48,017
Ah, forget about that.

1470
01:24:48,042 --> 01:24:50,006
You know what we should do?
Let's go to the village.

1471
01:24:50,031 --> 01:24:51,754
- Let's do it.
- No. Actually I love to go...

1472
01:24:51,779 --> 01:24:53,550
... hang out with you guys.
But you know I got this thing.

1473
01:24:53,575 --> 01:24:55,271
And I have another thing
after that thing

1474
01:24:55,296 --> 01:24:58,237
- and there's all these things in a row.
- Would you look at that.

1475
01:25:00,425 --> 01:25:02,088
What the?

1476
01:25:15,483 --> 01:25:17,605
HOME TWEET HOME

1477
01:25:23,108 --> 01:25:27,407
Mr. Red.
Welcome back, to the village.

1478
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:51,643
Ta-da!

1479
01:25:56,115 --> 01:26:00,759
Mighty Mighty Red
You rescued me.

Defender of our homes and liberty.

1481
01:26:05,819 --> 01:26:11,291
Bravery. Humility. Angery.

1482
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:18,898
Mighty Mighty Red
You rescued me.

1483
01:26:18,923 --> 01:26:21,708
Me...

1484
01:26:21,733 --> 01:26:28,513
lalalalaa laalala lalalalaa

1485
01:26:29,419 --> 01:26:37,782
Lalalaa
Lalalalaaaaaaaaa.

1486
01:26:39,907 --> 01:26:42,573
Oh my gosh.

1487
01:26:51,022 --> 01:26:53,628
How did you guys find
the time to pull this off?

1488
01:26:53,653 --> 01:26:55,874
This is why we went to
go get pedicure, isn't it?

1489
01:26:55,905 --> 01:26:58,406
Nope. We got pedicures
because we are worth it.

1490
01:26:58,431 --> 01:27:00,434
- I got gels.
- You guys are something else.

1491
01:27:00,459 --> 01:27:02,642
To be honest with you,
I'm going to miss the beach view.

1492
01:27:02,667 --> 01:27:04,141
But, so what.
It's still there.

1493
01:27:04,166 --> 01:27:07,074
It's just not... right there when
I wake up and look out my window.

1494
01:27:07,099 --> 01:27:09,610
Well, you can still look out your
window and see me and Bomb.

1495
01:27:09,635 --> 01:27:10,815
Right.

1496
01:27:10,854 --> 01:27:12,858
So you know,
pluses and minuses.

1497
01:27:12,883 --> 01:27:14,924
Okay, see you later.

1498
01:27:15,421 --> 01:27:16,718
Oh.

1499
01:27:17,974 --> 01:27:21,836
- Well, this just got awkward.
- That's really insensitive.

1500
01:27:22,079 --> 01:27:23,654
Want to go get a bite?

1501
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:26,534
Forget it, let's just go home.

1502
01:27:29,559 --> 01:27:32,205
Guys, I'm just messing with you.

1503
01:27:32,230 --> 01:27:33,865
Get in here!

1504
01:27:34,529 --> 01:27:36,835
- Ha ha ha ha! I knew it!
- Let's be roomies.

1505
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:39,631
Room mates. Boy, I can't wait
to make a chores list.

1506
01:27:39,656 --> 01:27:41,602
- Wait, hold on a second.
- I'll move my nest into the master bedroom.

1507
01:27:41,627 --> 01:27:43,316
- Bomb, you can stay in the guest half.
- No no no...

1508
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:45,880
- Ah! Can we get a bunk nest?
- Oh, this is going to be perfect.

1509
01:27:45,905 --> 01:27:48,651
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Guys... No!

Moving out.

1513

Watch this.

Come on, Leonard.

1518
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:15,530
Leonard can't dance.
He's hatching a new plan.

1519
01:29:22,157 --> 01:29:24,499
Okay, maybe I'll dance
for just a sec.

1520
01:29:29,266 --> 01:29:30,122
- Woo!
- Yee-haw!

1521
01:29:30,147 --> 01:29:31,889

- Nice try.
