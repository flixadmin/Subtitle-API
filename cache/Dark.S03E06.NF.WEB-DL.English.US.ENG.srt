1
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:24,125
I promise you.

2
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:25,916
I'll make this right.

3
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,458
<i>Dear Jonas,</i>

4
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:34,458
<i>you promised
to make everything right again.</i>

5
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,541
<i>I want you to know you will do that.</i>

6
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,666
<i>You must never lose hope
that there is a way out of this maze.</i>

7
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,666
<i>A way to save me...</i>

8
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,458
<i>and you.</i>

9
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,416
<i>But we both have to make sacrifices,</i>

10
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,166
<i>do unimaginable things,</i>

11
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,083
<i>to untie the knot at the end.</i>

12
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:19,291
<i>Each fate in this knot
is tied to the next.</i>

13
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,291
<i>A thread,</i>

14
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,000
<i>red like blood,</i>

15
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,375
<i>that connects all our deeds.</i>

16
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:30,791
<i>In light...</i>

17
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,375
<i>and in shadow.</i>

18
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,833
Why is Adam doing this?

19
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,583
Why are you locking me up?

20
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,833
<i>But the apocalypse</i>

21
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,291
<i>must take place.</i>

22
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,583
<i>You must let me die</i>

23
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,666
<i>so I can live.</i>

24
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,166
<i>We have to let some things go
before they find their way back to us.</i>

25
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,375
<i>We are a perfect match.</i>

26
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,833
<i>Never believe anything else.</i>

27
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:27,000
LIGHT AND SHADOW

28
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:48,000
DAY OF THE APOCALYPSE

29
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,166
Martha?

30
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,166
Man, where were you?

31
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,083
Mom cried all night long.

32
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,375
Is everything okay?

33
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:22,791
Hey.

34
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,583
What happened?

35
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,166
What's wrong?

36
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,666
He was absolutely right.

37
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,500
Bartosz was right.

38
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,833
What he said in the forest...

39
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,875
about the end of the world.

40
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,291
The nuclear power plant. Today.

41
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,708
Bartosz's father is trying
to cover up an accident.

42
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,916
The barrels.
I know this sounds totally crazy, but...

43
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,875
the world's coming to an end today.

44
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,291
Have you got a screw loose?

45
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,250
When did you last sleep?

46
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,041
Are you even listening?

47
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,125
The...

48
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:15,750
I haven't got time for your psycho crap.

49
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,875
I don't know what's going on with you.

50
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,583
But it's not fair
to let Mom down like that.

51
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,541
She doesn't deserve that.

52
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,375
He had to die.

53
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,500
You two are wrong...

54
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,791
in his world.

55
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,375
And in ours.

56
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,375
I know what you're feeling.

57
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,500
But you'll learn to let him go.

58
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,333
Everything will run its course,

59
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,750
just as fate determined...

60
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,500
for our world...

61
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,125
and his.

62
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,375
Why did you lock me up?

63
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:08,291
You promised me there would be a way
to change everything...

64
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,125
so that the apocalypse doesn't happen.

65
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,541
You lied to me
just like my older self lied to me.

66
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,000
Sic Mundus.

67
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,791
Old Tannhaus.

68
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:35,125
He firmly believed
he was creating a paradise,

69
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,041
where we would all be free
from our destiny...

70
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,625
and free of pain.

71
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,875
A world beyond your world and my world.

72
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,041
But I...

73
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,833
have finally realized
what paradise really is.

74
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:58,375
Eternal darkness,

75
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,041
in which nothing exists.

76
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,083
But for that...

77
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
the apocalypse must happen.

78
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,041
In my world...

79
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,666
and in yours.

80
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,541
Jonas!

81
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:17,625
Jonas!

82
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,625
Let me out! Jonas!

83
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:30,708
6 HOURS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

84
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,375
<i>Where are the barrels?</i>

85
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,458
<i>I want you to wait.</i>

86
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,041
I don't care about that.

87
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,458
You do what I say, Obendorf.

88
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:41,666
Got it?

89
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,416
Dad? Is everything okay?

90
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:54,500
I know I said I'd stay home today,
but something came up.

91
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,708
I'm sorry.

92
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,625
It's all right.

93
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,250
I have to tell you something.

94
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,250
Someone is blackmailing me.

95
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,500
What?

96
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,291
With something...

97
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,166
that happened a very long time ago.

98
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:39,250
MURDER IN MARBURG
STILL UNSOLVED 33 YEARS LATER

99
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,708
Sometimes we make decisions in our lives
that we can never undo.

100
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,750
My name isn't Aleksander.

101
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,375
It's Boris.

102
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,125
Boris Niewald.

103
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,791
But it was an accident.
You have to believe me.

104
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:03,666
I am not a murderer.

105
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,625
What about Mom?

106
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,541
Did Mom know about this?

107
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:22,125
Your mother is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

108
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,458
She saved me from all that.

109
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,333
And I never even told her the truth.

110
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,166
Bartosz.

111
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:35,916
I'm sorry.

112
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,708
Charlotte.

113
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,541
May I come in for a second?

114
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:01,333
Thanks.

115
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,500
I need to speak to Ulrich. Is he here?

116
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,208
No. He's still in the shower.

117
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:15,541
Could I maybe wait? It's important.

118
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,291
How are you?

119
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,958
Okay.

120
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,625
And at home? Is everything fine?

121
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,416
Now you listen to me...

122
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,708
Ulrich belongs to me.

123
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,458
And that's not going to change.

124
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,458
Charlotte.

125
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,333
- What are you doing here?
- I just wanted to show you something.

126
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,583
Drop by with Peter sometime.

127
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,958
We can all go out together.
While I still can.

128
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:14,708
- Are you done in the bathroom?
- Of course.

129
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,291
- What are you doing here?
- Your cell was off.

130
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,708
Don't ever do this again.
Never come here uninvited.

131
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,625
The microscopic examinations
of the two pennies are in.

132
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,250
And...

133
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,500
And?

134
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,583
And what?

135
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,875
WINDEN POLICE
EVIDENCE

136
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:54,416
This is the penny I found in the bunker.

137
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,833
And this is the penny Helge had on him.

138
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:03,166
At first I thought it must be a mistake,
that the photos were labeled incorrectly.

139
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,916
But this here,

140
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,916
this little groove.

141
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,541
It is exactly identical.

142
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,666
I don't know how,
but it's one and the same coin.

143
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,958
But this one here, Helge has had it
as long as I've known him.

144
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,125
I know it makes no sense at all,

145
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,125
but...

146
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:25,916
But?

147
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,958
It's as if the penny...

148
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,666
had somehow traveled through time.

149
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,000
- Where's Helge now?
- Still in pre-trial custody.

150
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,375
Ulrich!

151
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,375
Oh, you startled me.

152
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,375
Where were you?

153
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,666
Did you cut your hair?

154
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,041
What happened?

155
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,958
Do you believe in fate?

156
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,958
I don't know.

157
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,458
No.

158
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,666
I believe we take our lives
into our own hands.

159
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,541
That we decide which path we take.

160
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,250
I know I...

161
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,708
I'm probably the last person
you want to talk to, but...

162
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,750
if you do want to...

163
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,500
I'm here.

164
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,291
Your dad and I...

165
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,916
A lot of things may be different now...

166
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,708
but that doesn't necessarily mean
it's bad.

167
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,750
No, it doesn't.

168
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,708
Are you going somewhere?

169
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,291
I promised someone
I'd take care of something.

170

171
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,875
GOD PARTICLE

172
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,791
FOLLOW THE SIGNAL

173
00:21:58,375 --> 00:21:59,375
Stop!

174
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,250
Jonas.

175
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,625
You're alive.

176
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:34,916
I killed him.

177
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,625
Why is he still alive in his world?

178
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,541
The switch point...

179
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,916
at the junction in the loop of time.

180
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,708
<i>The moment</i>

181
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:06,458
<i>that allows things to run
in one direction or the other.</i>

182
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,958
<i>You bring him to our world,</i>

183
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,166
or you don't.

184
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:20,458
A line that meets itself again in a loop.

185
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,125
<i>Two possible paths:</i>

186
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:29,333
<i>along the outer edge of the line,
or along the inner edge of the line.</i>

187
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,875
<i>And yet it is the same line.</i>

188
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:37,125
<i>Two overlapping realities.</i>

189
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,333
On one of these paths, he dies.

190
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:47,208
On the other, he doesn't.

191
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,875
Both possibilities recur in the loop

192
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,791
again and again.

193
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:59,250
One triggers the other.

194
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:05,541
Quantum entanglement.

195
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:14,083
Adam has tried to sever
this entanglement for the past 33 years,

196
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:17,125
so what is growing inside you

197
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:19,000
will never come to be.

198
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,625
But it is impossible.

199
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:27,708
Our worlds

200
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,916
cannot be separated from one another.

201
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:35,291
Every step Jonas takes is guided by us.

202
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,750
He cannot escape his fate.

203
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:44,583
What is this?

204
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:49,375
This was left over...

205
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:52,541
after the catastrophe.

206
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:57,833
The God Particle.

207
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:03,708
And this here?

208
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:05,541
What is this?

209
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,875
I've seen what it will become,

210
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,375
in the future.

211
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:18,500
There's no way back now.
The cave collapsed. There's nothing left.

212
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,500
The passage no longer exists.

213
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:21,916
But this here...

214
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:25,291
if I find out how it works, I can go back.

215
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:27,541
Then I can save them. Martha and Mikkel.

216
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:29,958
I can save them all.

217
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,208
How did you even find me?

218
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:43,583
How did you know I was here?

219
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:48,041
The device.

220
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:52,125
- The matter it needs...
- The device. Do you still have it?

221
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,250
Where is it?

222
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:11,583
It doesn't work.

223
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:15,958
Maybe it all had to happen this way first,

224
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:19,458
for things to change next time.

225
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,083
The substance in the device,

226
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,750
you and I brought it
into the passage again.

227
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:31,875
We changed the variables of the equation.

228
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:36,583
- Maybe it will work next time.
- I don't have time to wait 33 years!

229
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:41,041
Am I supposed to lie to myself again
to have things happen the same way?

230
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:44,208
But this time I'll be on the other side
of the bunker door?

231
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:54,041
Why didn't she say anything?

232
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:56,291
Your older self.

233
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:00,666
She knew Martha would die.

234
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:03,875
How she'd die.

235
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:09,625
Why should I trust you?

236
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:15,166
The matter in the nuclear power plant.

237
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,583
I know what it is.

238
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,250
I can help you save Martha,

239
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:28,708
to save them all.

240
00:27:31,541 --> 00:27:36,291
3 HOURS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

241
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,625
Bartosz?

242
00:27:57,083 --> 00:27:58,166
Martha?

243
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,750
Can I come in?

244
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:04,791
Yes.

245
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:11,000
33 years ago, there was an accident
at the nuclear power plant.

246
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:15,416
Somehow the accident caused
some strange substance to form.

247
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:19,541
And your father helped
cover everything up.

248
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:25,958
The whole time,
that stuff has been in the caves.

249
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:28,791
It's all connected.

250
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,583
The substance...

251
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:34,333
it triggers it.

252
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:36,041
Today.

253
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:38,125
We have to talk to him.

254
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:39,708
Triggers what?

255
00:28:42,791 --> 00:28:44,375
The apocalypse.

256
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:51,291
POLICE

257
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:53,125
IDENTITY UNKNOWN

258
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:58,041
The time of death must have been
just before the body was found.

259
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,625
Is it possible
that he's been dead for a long time?

260
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:17,500
That his body had been preserved somehow?

261
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:20,083
Preserved?

262
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:22,041
What do you mean "preserved"?

263
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:35,750
Everything okay?

264
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:38,000
The scar on his chin...

265
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:45,375
Ulrich?

266
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:14,916
The boy in the bunker.

267
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:17,625
You said you killed him.

268
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:21,250
But you didn't mean him.

269
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:23,166
You meant Mads.

270
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:27,666
The boy from the bunker
looks just like Mads.

271
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:31,000
How can that be?

272
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:34,250
She... she said I had to do it.

273
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,125
Who?

274
00:30:38,208 --> 00:30:39,625
Do what?

275
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:41,958
Send him to the future.

276
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:44,375
To fill the gaps.

277
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:01,666
The pennies.

278
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:04,875
What does this mean?

279
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,666
- I have to stop him.
- Stop who?

280
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:15,375
Stop who?

281
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:22,000
You.

282
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:46,291
You can go.

283
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:13,958
<i>And this Jonas guy is dead now?</i>

284
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:18,416
And you killed him.

285
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:22,333
Well, not you, but...

286
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:24,958
some other you?

287
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:28,291
I was there.

288
00:32:29,125 --> 00:32:30,583
In the future.

289
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,375
Nothing's left.

290
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:38,291
Nothing.

291
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,875
It all has something to do
with your father.

292
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:44,541
He can't be allowed to open the barrels.

293
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:51,750
Bartosz.

294
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:54,916
Please.

295
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,291
Charlotte, it's Aleksander.

296
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,916
I...

297
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:53,791
Can you come to the nuclear power plant?

298
00:33:55,583 --> 00:33:57,291
I want to show you something.

299
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:09,958
Come on out!

300
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:12,583
Adam's waiting for you.

301
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:31,416
Stop.

302
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:42,625
Take it off!

303
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,458
- What?
- Your clothing.

304
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:47,458
Take it all off.

305
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:59,166
Why are you doing as he says?

306
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:02,833
We, the chosen few, must fill the gaps.

307
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:06,250
So you can find your way here,
and Adam his...

308
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,166
and we'll finally find salvation.

309
00:36:17,416 --> 00:36:20,333
We have waited
a long time for this moment.

310
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:28,625
You know what to do.

311
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:54,416
1 HOUR UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

312
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,000
What do you think it means?

313
00:36:57,875 --> 00:37:00,083
The birds? The light?

314
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:01,958
The boy in the bunker?

315
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:05,333
Martha is losing it.

316
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:10,208
She thinks
the apocalypse will happen today.

317
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:27,708
If we die today, then together.

318
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:32,541
Together.

319
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:55,958
What's this about?

320
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:02,166
It's better if you see it yourself.

321
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,541
Tick, tock.

322
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:11,833
Tick, tock.

323
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:16,875
Tick...

324
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:18,416
tock.

325
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:35,541
Charlotte, it's me.
Listen, the stuff with the pennies...

326
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:39,791
I know it sounds crazy, but the same thing
happened with the body in the bunker.

327
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:42,125
Have them run a DNA test.

328
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:43,875
I don't know how, but...

329
00:38:44,166 --> 00:38:45,625
the boy in the bunker,

330
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:48,500
he's my brother. It's Mads.

331
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:51,458
Call me back when you get this.

332
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:18,916
Who are you?

333
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:23,875
Can't you guess that?

334
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:33,291
Magnus?

335
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,708
You're from the future.

336
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,500
But not from yours.

337
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:50,666
What's going on?

338
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:52,958
They lied to you.

339
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:55,041
Your older selves.

340
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:58,291
They don't want to prevent the apocalypse.

341
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:02,583
They're the ones
who are responsible for it happening.

342
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,041
But there is a way to change everything.

343
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:08,875
But you have to choose our world...

344
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:11,125
and trust him;

345
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:13,458
Jonas.

346
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:17,375
Jonas is alive?

347
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,708
In our world.

348
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:24,458
And he knows where the origin is.

349
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:30,666
But before that, you must save Jonas
from the apocalypse in his world,

350
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,791
and bring him into your world.

351
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,833
You're all out of your minds.

352
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:40,000
You can't stop
what's happening here, but...

353
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,625
if you come with us,

354
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:44,916
you can prevent it...

355
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:46,916
another time.

356
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:51,500
What is that?

357
00:41:05,541 --> 00:41:08,625
Martha, what's this all about?

358
00:41:12,916 --> 00:41:14,250
Martha?

359
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:19,000
You have to come with us.

360
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,916
- Come where?
- He doesn't belong with us.

361
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:25,208
He belongs with the others.

362
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:30,500
They will save him.

363
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,083
I'm sorry.

364
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,250
Martha, wait!

365
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:56,416
<i>It's time.</i>

366
00:41:57,291 --> 00:42:01,333
<i>Adam has moved
each of his pieces into position.</i>

367
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:04,583
It's time

368
00:42:05,291 --> 00:42:06,958
that we do the same.

369
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:14,333
This knot has given us all life,

370
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:16,875
and we are its keepers.

371
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:19,666
In both worlds.

372
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,541
He'll never be able

373
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:27,250
to untie the knot.

374
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:30,666
In all these years, he hasn't understood

375
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,875
how everything is really connected.

376
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:36,458
How everything ends and begins.

377
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:39,625
Not only in our world,

378
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,333
but also in his.

379
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:45,333
We are...

380
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:47,625
destiny.

381
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:51,041
We build the walls...

382
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:53,541
of this labyrinth.

383
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:55,750
Each of us shapes the paths

384
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:57,666
and extends their hand.

385
00:43:00,791 --> 00:43:05,250
Bartosz, you must save yourself
to save our lives.

386
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:11,541
Claudia, you must guide yourself
to be our eyes in Adam's world.

387
00:43:11,666 --> 00:43:17,791
Egon, you must create your past
to preserve the family tree.

388
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:19,583
Noah...

389
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,291
you bring love

390
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:26,416
to make everything new.

391
00:43:29,125 --> 00:43:31,875
Every darkness is followed by light.

392
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:35,041
With every death comes a life.

393
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:03,416
You brought me into your world.

394
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:07,916
You promised me I could change it.

395
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,666
Why are you doing this?

396
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:20,208
Where are the others?

397
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,041
Where did you send them?

398
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:27,208
They are all fulfilling their destinies.

399
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:30,083
Magnus and Franziska.

400
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:31,958
Charlotte and Elisabeth.

401
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,125
Silja and Agnes.

402
00:44:35,375 --> 00:44:37,666
They're perpetuating the cycle,

403
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:41,083
so that you and I can be here now.

404
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:45,083
What's that supposed to mean?

405
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:50,125
That we've come to the end.

406
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:54,041
What's growing inside you,

407
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,250
the origin,

408
00:44:57,583 --> 00:44:59,208
must die.

409
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:03,583
But it can't be killed by normal means.

410
00:45:04,541 --> 00:45:07,083
It's born of both worlds,

411
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:10,500
and the energy of both worlds is necessary

412
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,666
to destroy it.

413
00:45:13,666 --> 00:45:15,750
The apocalypse in my world,

414
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:19,041
and the apocalypse in your world.

415
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:23,458
This here is the end.

416
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:29,250
A machine that not only crosses time,
but also space.

417
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:33,208
It focuses the energy of both apocalypses

418
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:36,875
onto this one point.

419
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:41,083
Your son only exists

420
00:45:41,916 --> 00:45:43,875
because the matter exists.

421
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:47,958
And now he will die through the matter,
and all of us with him.

422
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:49,916
None of this...

423
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:52,000
will exist anymore.

424
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:56,833
Both worlds will extinguish one another.

425
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:01,208
Absolute annihilation.

426
00:46:03,958 --> 00:46:05,458
You're insane.

427
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:19,666
There is no hope.

428
00:46:20,625 --> 00:46:22,000
No salvation.

429
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:24,458
No paradise.

430
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:35,166
We're wrong,

431
00:46:36,291 --> 00:46:37,625
you and I...

432
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:42,583
in your world

433
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:44,958

Jonas!

436
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,083
Jonas, please don't do it.

437
00:46:56,625 --> 00:46:57,750
Jonas!

438

Don't. Jonas, please!

00:47:05,958 --> 00:47:06,958
Jonas!

442
00:47:09,958 --> 00:47:10,958
Jonas, please!

443
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,125
No!

444
