1
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:29,061
Can I help you?

2
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:53,052
<i>I have to go back a bit.</i>

3
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:55,187
<i>I was 12 years old</i>

4
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:57,389
<i>and on a school trip in the hills.</i>

5
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,205
Are you making fun of me?

6
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:54,606
What do you mean?

7
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:56,775
You have this orgasm, not only an orgasm,

8
00:02:56,777 --> 00:03:00,112
- ...but a spontaneous orgasm.
- Yes, it was an orgasm,

9
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:02,614
though the doctor described it as a...

10
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,183
An epileptic seizure.

11
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,617
And during that orgasm,

12
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,252
you have this vision

13
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:10,622
<i>of these two women on each side of you?</i>

14
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:14,259
Was she holding the veil with two fingers like this?

15
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,501
What's the matter?

16
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:25,837
You don't even--
you don't even know who these women were, do you?

17
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:31,143
No, but one of them did look like the Virgin Mary,

18
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:32,911
<i>now that you mention it.</i>

19
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:35,647
Well, it wasn't the Virgin Mary, I can tell you that.

20
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:38,183
<i>From your description, it must've been</i>

21
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:39,918
<i>Valeria Messalina,</i>

22
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,521
the wife of Emperor Claudius,

23
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:45,924
the most notorious nymphomaniac in history.

24
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,726
<i>And the other woman,</i>

25
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,162
<i>the one astride the creature,</i>

26
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:53,465
<i>that was no one else but the great whore of Babylon</i>

27
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:56,001
<i>riding on Nimrod in the form of a bull.</i>

28
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,241
Your story is like a...

29
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:05,377
Blasphemous retelling

30
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:08,013
of the transfiguration of Jesus on the mount...

31
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,850
<i>Which is one of the eastern church's</i>

32
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:13,785
<i>holiest passages.</i>

33
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,389
It's when the humanity of Christ

34
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:20,292
is illuminated by the divine light of eternity.

35
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,731
If anyone else would have told me that story,

36
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:28,800
I would've seen it as a blasphemous joke,

37
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,969
spiced up with a biblical light

38
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:35,040
emanating from nothing less than a spontaneous orgasm.

39
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:41,446
And then later, you lost your orgasm altogether.

40
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,821
<i>Wagner.</i>
"Das Rheingold,

41
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,990
<i>the descent into Nibelheim."</i>

42
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:54,226
<i>Was it that bad?</i>

43
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:57,596
<i>Try to imagine that in one fell swoop,</i>

44
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:59,965
<i>you lost all desire to read</i>

45
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,968
<i>and all your love and passion for books and letters.</i>

46
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,071
<i>I don't even know if I can imagine that.</i>

47
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:44,710
<i>This is nothing less than Zeno's paradox.</i>

48
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,946
<i>You are Achilles</i>

49
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:50,682
<i>and the tortoise is the orgasm.</i>

50
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:51,983
Oh, come on.

51
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:54,019
Because you were giving chase,

52
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:56,822
you couldn't reach satisfaction.
That's the paradox.

53
00:05:56,824 --> 00:06:00,425
I'm sorry, but it seems as if you're
not taking this very seriously.

54
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:03,528
<i>I'm telling you about the worst
thing that's happened to me,</i>

55
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,831
<i>that I, at that point within seconds,</i>

56
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:08,367
<i>lost all sexual sensation.</i>

57
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:11,303
<i>My cunt simply went numb!</i>

58
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:13,071
And immediately we have to hear

59
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:16,007
about this ridiculous mathematical problem.

60
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,810
<i>In fact, I'm in doubt whether</i>

61
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,112
you're even listening.

62
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,382
Why do you doubt that?

63
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:27,085
Whenever I've told other men about experiences,

64
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:30,021
episodes in my sex life,

65
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:34,059
it was easy to see that they became quite excited.

66
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:36,428
I got excited.

67
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,730
Yes, about the mathematical crap,

68
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,432
not about the story.

69
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:51,176
What kind of a person are you actually?

70
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,517
I...

71
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,887
You wouldn't know.

72
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,492
No, but I can guess.

73
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,764
<i>Why didn't I get that earlier?</i>

74
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,903
The fact you don't get excited over my dirty stories

75
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,440
is because you can't relate to them.

76
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,577
<i>You've never been with a woman.</i>

77
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,225
That's quite accurate.

78
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,462
Not with a man either.

79
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,239
Are you sorry about that?

80
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,513
Well yeah, but...

81
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:04,549
Out of curiosity.

82
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,653
Not out of lust, as you would think.

83
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:18,697
I consider myself...
Asexual.

84
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,901
Of course I...
Experimented

85
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,971
with masturbation when I was a teenager, but...

86
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,740
It didn't do much for me.

87
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:35,146
So there's nothing sexual about me.

88
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,555
<i>It's not as uncommon as you would think.</i>

89
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,124
And of course I've...

90
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:49,194
I've read a lot about sexual subjects:

91
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,830
<i>"Canterbury tales,"
"Decameron,"</i>

92
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,498
<i>"thousand and one nights."</i>

93
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,867
<i>You name it</i>

94
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:59,738
and I've read it with great interest and enjoyment...

95
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,675
But only literary enjoyment.

96
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,913
<i>But I... but I think</i>
<i>maybe it makes me</i>

97
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:10,315
<i>a better listener to your story.</i>

98
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,120
I have no preconceived notions or...

99
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:17,689
Or preferences.

100
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:21,226
I'm actually the best judge you could give your story to.

101
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,562
And when it comes to deciding whether you're

102
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,096
a bad human being or not, I'm...

103
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,799
<i>I have no problems with that.</i>

104
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,769
<i>Because I don't look at you through the glasses</i>

105
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:33,271
colored by sexuality

106
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,807
or sexual experience.

107
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,711
I'm a virgin.

108
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,348
I'm innocent.

109
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,071
She's looking at me.

110
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,307
Yes.

111
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,543
<i>It's an icon.</i>

112
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:13,311
<i>Is it russian?</i>

113
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,246
Yes, it's...

114
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,915
It's a skilled copy,

115
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,985
maybe in the manner of rublev.

116
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,027
<i>Icons are usually connected to the eastern church.</i>

117
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,862
<i>The eastern church?</i>

118
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,932
I might become a bit theoretical.

119
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,168
You may.

120
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,904
I'd like you to tell me about your picture.

121
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,208
Although the Christian church

122
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:47,212
was split up in 1054 because of differences in opinion

123
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:49,914
between the eastern church and the western church...

124
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,717
What we today call the orthodox church

125
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,886
and the roman catholic church.

126
00:10:56,355 --> 00:11:00,659
This is a typical eastern church icon.

127
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:03,762
And it usually depicts the Virgin Mary

128
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,897
and the infant Jesus, and more rarely,

129
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,066
for instance, the crucifixion,

130
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:11,136
which in the western church was much more prevalent.

131
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:13,738
If you generalize, you could say that

132
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,641
the western church is the church of suffering,

133
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:20,612
and the eastern church is the church of happiness.

134
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:23,715
If you imagine a mental journey from Rome eastward,

135
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:26,651
you feel how you move away

136
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:30,021
from guilt and pain towards joy and light.

137
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,824
But you say you didn't believe in God.

138
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:37,162
No, but the concept of religion is interesting...

139
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:40,398
Like the concept of sex.

140
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,903
But you won't find me on my knees
with the regards to either.

141
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,840
Let's call this chapter,

142
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:52,744
um, "the eastern church
and the western church."

143
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:56,147
<i>But it won't be...</i>
<i>It won't be a story</i>

144
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,249
about traveling east from Rome

145
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:01,252
towards the light, but rather the opposite.

146
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,190
<i>So in order not to make it too sad,</i>

147
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:09,194
<i>I've pepped up the name of the
chapter with an extra title.</i>

148
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:18,670
<i>In spite of my tireless efforts,</i>

149
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:21,072
<i>my cunt totally failed to respond.</i>

150
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,141
<i>I have to admit there came a time</i>

151
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:25,410
<i>when we had fun together.</i>

152
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,481
I'll give you a fiver...

153
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,283
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

154
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,219
...if you can put this

155
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,288
<i>up inside your cunt.</i>

156
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,724
A fiver?

157
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,059
Right.

158
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:56,941
Shit.

159
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,243
Thank you.

160
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,112
You're welcome.

161
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,151
- Didn't get any spoons?
- No, we didn't.

162
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:20,158
The most grotesque thing was
that it was during that period

163
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,828
where every sexual sensation was denied me...

164
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,164
A period, I must admit,

165
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,867
of secure and restful domestic comfort...

166
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,436
We had moved in together and so on...

167
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:33,338
That I became pregnant,

168
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,441
because I was careless about my birth control pills.

169
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:39,310
<i>Consciously or unconsciously,</i>

170
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:42,380
<i>it was important for me to have a caesarean.</i>

171
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:46,017
<i>I mean, I was hoping that my cunt
was going to fucking work again,</i>

172
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,486
<i>and I had a feeling that</i>

173
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:51,222
<i>a haphazard birth wouldn't make things better.</i>

174
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,592
<i>I may have been imagining things,</i>

175
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:58,296
<i>but as I lay there the noise from the instruments</i>

176
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,131
<i>rang out in a chord like</i>

177
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,033
<i>the one from the little flock.</i>

178
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,836
<i>Yes.</i>

179
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:07,105
<i>And it wasn't fear.</i>

180
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:09,908
<i>More like a kind of disgust.</i>

181
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,292
<i>I could've sworn I saw him laughing.</i>

182
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,261
A laughing son?

183
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:34,432
In "Doctor Faustus," Thomas Mann
describes the birth of Noah's son Ham,

184
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,935
who was laughing when he was born.

185
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,471
Another satanic omen.

186
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,979
Incidentally, the innocent child was named Marcel,

187
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:50,648
after Mars, the roman God of war.

188
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,483
And motherhood?

189
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,652
I assume maternal love

190
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:57,388
didn't quite live up to its expectations.

191
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,657
No, I didn't have any expectations.

192
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:03,127
And maternal love wasn't a problem.

193
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,463
It was just that each time

194
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,598
I looked into the child's eyes,

195
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,301
I had this unsettling feeling

196
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,004
of having been found out.

197
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,675
<i>I know it's probably a strange thing</i>

198
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:19,510
<i>to say about a child...</i>

199
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:22,013
<i>That my love wasn't being returned...</i>

200
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,982
<i>But it was my perception.</i>

201
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,669
<i>If Jerome had hoped for a break</i>

202
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:48,172
<i>from what was for him now mostly strenuous work,</i>

203
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,441
<i>he could forget about it.</i>

204
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,650
Fill all my holes.

205
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,552
I can't, Joe.

206
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,288
I'm sorry.

207
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,692
I'm sorry.

208
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,298
Can we talk about it?

209
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,134
Of course.

210
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,108
I love you, I love your wildness and your desire.

211
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,315
At the moment I don't seem to satisfy
you in the way that I'd like to.

212
00:17:33,507 --> 00:17:36,387
Don't get upset, Joe. It doesn't mean
we won't continue with our sex life,

213
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,256
which is very important to me.

214
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,659
<i>Very important to me.</i>

215
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,263
Mmm, when you buy a tiger,

216
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,033
right?
You also have to feed it.

217
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:52,537
Um, satisfy it,

218
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,472
<i>right?</i>

219
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,713
Long story short:

220
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:05,550
I have a tiger on my hands.

221
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:07,351
- You mean I'm too much for you.
- No.

222
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,688
You're just the way you should be.

223
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,657
I was just thinking if you would consider

224
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:15,093
that I get a little help with the feeding, that's all.

225
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,631
You're saying I should have sex with others as well.

226
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,508
That's a rather cruel way of putting it, Joe, but...

227
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,778
- But exact.
- ...Exact.

228
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,459
<i>For a long time I'd been playing around</i>

229
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,395
<i>with the idea that the concept</i>
<i>of the fuck-me-now clothes</i>

230
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:53,164
<i>could be improved...</i>

231
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,600
You look nice.

232
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:57,735
<i>...and became the piano teacher.</i>

233
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,486
You okay?

234
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,821
No.

235
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,289
What's the matter?

236
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,824
Well, I'm such an idiot with cars.

237
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,426
I don't really know what to do.
Do you mind helping me?

238
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,730
<i>Well, of course it won't work.</i>

239
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:27,598
Sparkplug caps have been removed.

240
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,467
Yes, I did that.

241
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:31,536
Was that wrong?

242
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:33,738
<i>For the first time I had</i>

243
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,374
<i>the pleasure of having</i>
<i>an 8-cylinder car.</i>

244
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:39,677
<i>The possible combinations</i>
<i>of eight spark-plug caps</i>

245
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,148
<i>on eight spark plugs are 40,320,</i>

246
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,350
<i>if I remembered my math correctly.</i>

247
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,153
<i>And only one of these</i>

248
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,888
<i>will make the car run,</i>

249
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,324
<i>which gave me all the time I needed.</i>

250
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:54,892
<i>Beethoven, huh?</i>

251
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:56,861
He was certainly very good, but, you know,

252
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,263
- ...he couldn't write a fugue.
- You think so?

253
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:01,532
Well...

254
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,234
Yeah, I think so.

255
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:21,652
It would be more precise to say that Beethoven

256
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,888
renewed the fugue...

257
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:29,160
But he was such a visionary that the old Bach purists,

258
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:31,562
they accused him of not mastering it.

259
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:55,953
Good day?

260
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,388
<i>And now to reach the heart</i>

261
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,356
<i>of your suffering western church,</i>

262
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:34,925
<i>I have to jump ahead three years in the story</i>

263
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,395
<i>and talk about my meeting</i>

264
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:39,297
<i>with what I would call</i>

265
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,065
<i>"the dangerous men."</i>

266
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:49,440
<i>I was alone with Marcel a lot during this period,</i>

267
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:52,410
<i>as Jerome was traveling most of the time.</i>

268
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:54,612
<i>And when he was finally home,</i>

269
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:57,815
<i>he spent most of the time accusing
me of neglecting Marcel,</i>

270
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:59,850
<i>which in my opinion</i>

271
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:03,487
<i>was just a cover for his anger over my lovers.</i>

272
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:07,258
<i>Any sexual satisfaction, let alone orgasm,</i>

273
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,860
<i>was further away than ever before.</i>

274
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,806
<i>I had to make a change.</i>

275
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:24,809
<i>And somehow the inspiration had been right there</i>

276
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:28,012
<i>beneath my window the whole time.</i>

277
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,948
<i>I could feel that it turned me on enormously</i>

278
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,951
<i>to imagine a sexual situation</i>

279
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:37,888
<i>in which verbal communication was impossible.</i>

280
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,760
- Hello.
- Hello.

281
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:44,562
I'm Tobias, the interpreter.

282
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:47,365
Hello, I'm Joe.
Come in.

283
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:50,034
I understand that you master the african languages.

284
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,103
I do have a basis.

285
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,406
Who and what needs interpretation?

286
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:57,808
Um, that man...

287
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,845
<i>The one with the green jacket?</i>

288
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:04,849
You are to ask him if he wants to have sex with me.

289
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,551
Yeah? Um...

290
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,378
Is it a go?

291
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,580
It's hard to say.

292
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,450
I've written down the time and the place,

293
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:41,051
but, um...

294
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,889
Honestly I wouldn't like to take responsibility

295
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:47,057
for the precise wording in this case,

296
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:49,126
which I think, uh,

297
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:51,495
accidentally may belong

298
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:53,764
to a grey zone in my profession.

299
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:59,136
<i>It was the address of a cheap hotel.</i>

300
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,447
<i>Why were there two?</i>

301
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,148
<i>My words exactly.</i>

302
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,919
<i>Apparently n had brought his brother along.</i>

303
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:16,854
Very sorry.
Sorry sorry sorry.

304
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,249
<i>Why was he so angry?</i>

305
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:28,619
<i>Clearly it was something personal between them,</i>

306
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:31,288
<i>but later I heard that performing a sandwich</i>

307
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,824
<i>requires great sensitivity,</i>

308
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:36,994
<i>since the men apparently can feel
each other through the tissue.</i>

309
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:40,064
<i>I imagine the quarrel had already started</i>

310
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:43,667
<i>on the stairs and that one or the other party</i>

311
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:46,604
<i>had laid claim to one or the other of my holes</i>

312
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:49,340
<i>in conflict with his negro brother's interests.</i>

313
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:52,276
You shouldn't use that word.

314
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:55,012
It's not what you call politically correct...

315
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:58,248
- <i>"Negro."</i>
- Well, excuse me,

316
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,317
but in my circles

317
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,220
it's always been a mark of honor to call a spade a spade.

318
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:07,124
Each time a word becomes prohibited,

319
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:10,160
you remove a stone from the democratic foundation.

320
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:13,030
<i>Society demonstrates its impotence</i>

321
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:15,065
in the face of a concrete problem

322
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:17,134
by removing words from the language.

323
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,336
I think society would claim that...

324
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:22,606
That politically correctness is a very precise expression

325
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:25,275
of democratic concern for minorities.

326
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:27,945
And I say that society

327
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:30,581
is as cowardly as the people in it,

328
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:34,385
who in my opinion are also too stupid for democracy.

329
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:39,690
I understand your point, but I totally disagree.

330
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:41,925
I have no doubt in the human qualities.

331
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:44,728
The human qualities

332
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,830
can be expressed in one word:

333
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,999
Hypocrisy.

334
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:52,302
We elevate those who say "right" but mean "wrong"

335
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:55,973
and mock those who
say "wrong" but mean "right."

336
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:03,747
<i>By the way, I can assure you</i>

337
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:07,084
that women who claim that negros don't turn them on,

338
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:09,887
- ...they're lying.
- So did they satisfy you?

339
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,956
Those ne-negros?

340
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,026
No.

341
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,062
But they showed me that there was a world

342
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:20,330
far from mine I had to explore.

343
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,868
And there, or perhaps on the other side,

344
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,404
get my life back.

345
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,479
<i>Who are you?</i>

346
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,449
I know what you do.

347
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:14,718
I'd like to be

348
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,453
one of the women you see.

349
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,226
That's of no interest.

350
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:29,933
Madame.

351
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,845
Princess,

352
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:16,814
I specifically said five days,

353
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:18,916
and five days haven't gone yet.

354
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,019
So...

355
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:23,987
You'll have to leave.

356
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,088
I'm sorry.

357
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,168
I, um...

358
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,071
I don't think this is for you.

359
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,349
<i>How mysterious.</i>

360
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:56,220
<i>Will you give me a reasonable explanation now</i>

361
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:58,922
<i>or shall we wait?</i>

362
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,359
I can't give you an explanation,

363
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,494
and certainly not a reasonable...

364
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:08,432
What exactly were the rumors about him?

365
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:11,802
That he was violent.

366
00:31:11,804 --> 00:31:13,937
How can that be inciting?

367
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,811
I think the easiest way to understand it

368
00:31:20,813 --> 00:31:23,614
is to refer to my rebellious nature.

369
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,317
This business of K's was

370
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:30,120
something I was completely against.

371
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:33,223
So the fact that I was now contacting him was

372
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,292
a last, desperate attempt

373
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:37,361
to rehabilitate my sexuality.

374
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:42,366
The system was the overriding factor with K.

375
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:45,202
A system of violence?

376
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:49,573
Well, you were the one

377
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:53,143
who insisted on the western church, right?

378
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:56,079
And I...
I seem to remember

379
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:59,182
that the systematic approach

380
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:02,119
to the crucifixion is of a violent

381
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:04,221
and not to say sadistic nature.

382
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:06,089
Oh yes, the passion of Christ

383
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:08,091
is full of systematic violence...

384
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,493
The Via Dolorosa,

385
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:11,261
the nine stations of the cross

386
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,696
and the 39 lashes.

387
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:38,722
You are beginning to irritate me.

388
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,068
Stand up.

389
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,282
<i>I just want you to sit</i>

390
00:33:05,284 --> 00:33:07,751
<i>completely relaxed...</i>

391
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,555
<i>While I hit you in the face.</i>

392
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:14,057
Nothing special.

393
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:16,093
<i>It's just a...</i>

394
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:18,328
<i>It's just a slap.</i>

395
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,135
Are you ready?

396
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,091
Let me tell you the rules then.

397
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,463
The first rule is that I don't fuck you

398
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:56,533
and that there isn't any discussions about that.

399
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,737
Then what do you get out of it?

400
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:02,439
That's my business

401
00:34:02,441 --> 00:34:05,742
<i>and I don't want you to mention it again.</i>

402
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:08,478
The second rule is that we have no safe word.

403
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:13,250
<i>Meaning that if you, uh, go inside with me,</i>

404
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:15,685
<i>there is nothing that you can say</i>

405
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:17,454
<i>that will make me stop</i>

406
00:34:17,456 --> 00:34:20,090
<i>any plan or procedure.</i>

407
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:25,328
You must bring a brown used leather riding crop.

408
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,600
<i>And not one from a shop selling sex toys.</i>

409
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,703
<i>It's not a masquerade.</i>

410
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,408
Third rule:

411
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,777
If I choose to let you in,

412
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:43,780
you have to be sitting out here.

413
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:46,083
In other words, you...

414
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:48,218
You won't know when.

415
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,786
<i>Only that it will be</i>

416
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:51,521
<i>sometime between...</i>

417
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:54,357
2:00 and 6:00 at night.

418
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,493
I can't stay here that late.

419
00:34:56,495 --> 00:34:59,329
My babysitter's not reliable and...

420
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:00,864
I can't leave my child.

421
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,302
You don't even know my name!

422
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:07,304
I'm not interested in your name.

423
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:10,874
Here your name is...

424
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,178
Fido.

425
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:31,328
<i>Marcel's awake.</i>

426
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,497
<i>D'you want to say goodbye to your mom?</i>

427
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,266
Goodbye.

428
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,312
I'll take your coat.

429
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,801
I'd like you to have your hair up.

430
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,804
You can use this.

431
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,175
Just in case it becomes necessary for me

432
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:19,543
to hit you in the face.

433
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,479
Should I take my clothes off?

434
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:26,149
I'll tell you what to do...

435
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:27,884
And when.

436
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,522
<i>Now you may bend down.</i>

437
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,191
How?

438
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:37,794
Approach the chair.

439
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:40,931
Now bend from the hips.

440
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,503
Look forward.
Look forward.

441
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:48,738
With your head up.
Head up.

442
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,640
Keep looking forward.

443
00:36:57,249 --> 00:36:59,382
Keep looking forward.

444
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:05,488
You may stand up.

445
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,226
We have to use the couch.

446
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,230
Come this way.

447
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,368
Take it easy, take it easy.

448
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:21,905
Bend over.

449
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,643
Lay your arms out straight.

450
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:38,722
Take it easy.

451
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:41,024
Take it easy.

452
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:06,416
Take it easy.

453
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,417
Next time don't wear knickers.

454
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:08,078
Your ass is not high enough.

455
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,348
I don't think we can do this today.

456
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,982
What?

457
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,891
I'd like to see you again on Thursday.

458
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,067
What's wrong?

459
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:33,603
I think we should see how it goes on Thursday.

460
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:48,885
<i>Hi, I can't come to the phone right now.</i>

461
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,754
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

462
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:53,990
Yes, this is Marcel's mother again.

463
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:56,593
Uh, it's now 1:30.

464
00:39:56,595 --> 00:39:58,995
We had an agreement.

465
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:02,766
I hope you get this message
and come as quickly as you can.

466
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:07,604
Uh, Marcel is sleeping.

467
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:09,539
Um...

468
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:11,541
I have to go now.

469
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:09,032
Better.

470
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,687
Also so much better.

471
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:32,755
So much better.

472
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:42,131
I am now going to hit you 12 times

473
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:44,667
no matter how much you scream...

474
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,903
<i>'Cause no one can hear you down here.</i>

475
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,845
That's, uh...

476
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:58,281
That's not how it goes.

477
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,685
Most people don't scream until I hit them.

478
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,226
Oh!

479
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:06,015
That's it.

480
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:11,321
Thank you.

481
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:13,856
You're very welcome.

482
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:23,199
<i>I don't know where we get our sexuality from</i>

483
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:26,603
or where tendencies of this kind come from.

484
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:31,541
Probably a perversion created in our childhood

485
00:43:31,543 --> 00:43:34,043
that never manifested itself before.

486
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:36,079
Well, oddly enough,

487
00:43:36,081 --> 00:43:38,648
Freud says the opposite.

488
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:42,085
He talks about the polymorphic perversion of a child.

489
00:43:42,087 --> 00:43:44,554
Meaning that in a child,

490
00:43:44,556 --> 00:43:46,990
all kinds of perversions exist.

491
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:50,193
<i>And then we use the childhood</i>

492
00:43:50,195 --> 00:43:52,295
<i>to diminish or remove some of them.</i>

493
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,899
Basically a child is sexually polymorphic

494
00:43:56,901 --> 00:43:59,936
and everything is sexuality in an infant.

495
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,040
And yet it was deeply bizarre

496
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:06,175
to lie there

497
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:08,311
and especially to want to lie there.

498
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:11,881
It is an interesting point that you actually lubricated

499
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:14,851
in expectation for a pain

500
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:16,886
that you hadn't experienced.

501
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,790
Your body prepared itself

502
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:23,793
for an intercourse that you knew wouldn't happen.

503
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:29,065
<i>I can only describe the mood as sexual.</i>

504
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:32,802
<i>As I twisted and turned</i>

505
00:44:32,804 --> 00:44:34,904
<i>while he was whipping me,</i>

506
00:44:34,906 --> 00:44:37,340
<i>I could feel how clever his knots were.</i>

507
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:41,711
If I fought them, they would get tighter,

508
00:44:41,713 --> 00:44:44,047
and as I relaxed,

509
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:45,815
it seemed they did too.

510
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,252
I don't know what kind of knot

511
00:44:49,254 --> 00:44:51,988
K used...

512
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:54,857
But I know of a knot

513
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:58,161
that tightens when force is exerted

514
00:44:58,163 --> 00:45:00,930
<i>and vice versa.</i>
<i>It's called a Prusik knot.</i>

515
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,069
It's after a man called Prusik.
He was a mountain climber.

516
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:08,271
And he and a friend were out climbing

517
00:45:08,273 --> 00:45:10,773
and they had an accident

518
00:45:10,775 --> 00:45:12,709
and his friend died.

519
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:15,845
And he ended up hanging at the end of a rope

520
00:45:15,847 --> 00:45:19,115
<i>with no possibility of getting up.</i>

521
00:45:19,117 --> 00:45:22,652
<i>You know, you can't climb up</i>
<i>a mountain-climber rope.</i>

522
00:45:22,654 --> 00:45:24,787
<i>It's too thin.</i>

523
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:26,689
But he was an intelligent man,

524
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:30,259
and with his back to the wall he was a genius.

525
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,997
And he took the shoelaces out of his boots

526
00:45:34,999 --> 00:45:39,435
and made two loops and affixed them to the rope.

527
00:45:39,437 --> 00:45:41,404
<i>And he could move these up</i>

528
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:43,372
<i>when they weren't under tension.</i>

529
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:45,808
<i>And then he could step into them</i>

530
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,044
<i>and climb the rope and save himself.</i>

531
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,748
<i>Prusik.</i>

532
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:58,154
I think this was one of your weakest digressions.

533
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:04,193
May I continue?

534
00:46:04,195 --> 00:46:06,529
Well, be my guest.

535
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:54,944
I sometimes give a Christmas present.

536
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,448
<i>But, uh, you have to do the work yourself.</i>

537
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:16,299
This is called a blood knot.

538
00:47:16,301 --> 00:47:19,101
You have to make nine ropes

539
00:47:19,103 --> 00:47:21,170
with three blood knots on each.

540
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:23,172
<i>Let me see you do it.</i>

541
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:25,842
You decide whether to make four,

542
00:47:25,844 --> 00:47:28,010
five or six turns

543
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:29,579
in the various knots.

544
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:27,790
Joe?

545
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,427
Hello.

546
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:43,272
Marcel?

547
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,244
Marcel!

548
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,213
Are you fond of me still?

549
00:51:24,215 --> 00:51:27,349
- Yes.
- More fond of me than the others?

550
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,720
- Yes?
- Yes.

551
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:35,843
You're not thinking of leaving again tonight, are you?

552
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,427
- <i>No.</i>
- No?

553
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,763
- <i>No no. Not at all.</i>
- Are you sure?

554
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:43,799
<i>Yeah.</i>

555
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:45,601
Are you lying to me, Joe?

556
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:48,370
- No.
- Be honest.

557
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:50,439
It's all right.

558
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:53,776
Just fucking say it.

559
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:56,045
No, I-- I just
want to be here.

560
00:51:56,047 --> 00:51:57,346
Why?

561
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:03,352
I don't know.

562
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:11,360
If you leave tonight...

563
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:16,165
You'll never see me or Marcel ever again in your life.

564
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:21,737
Do you understand?

565
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:39,949
Is this goodbye?

566
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:45,521
Is that what you're saying?

567
00:53:45,523 --> 00:53:47,623
Marcel, get up.

568
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:49,758
- Stop it.
- <i>Is that what you want?</i>

569
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:53,362
Here, so you could see him.

570
00:53:53,364 --> 00:53:54,897
<i>Look at him, Joe.</i>

571
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:03,372
Let's face it, Joe, you're not a mother.

572
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:07,509
<i>Let's wake him up.</i>

573
00:54:07,511 --> 00:54:10,312
Marcel, baby boy,

574
00:54:10,314 --> 00:54:12,815
say, "bye, Mom."

575
00:54:12,817 --> 00:54:15,417
- Please put him back.
- Is this what you want?

576
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,653
Hmm?

577
00:54:17,655 --> 00:54:20,289
- Ma.
- <i>You see?</i>

578
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:22,825
You see, he wants you.

579
00:54:22,827 --> 00:54:25,394
Come.

580
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:29,531
It's Christmas.
It's fucking Christmas.

581
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:54,623
What is this?

582
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:59,028
Today it's madame who must wait.

583
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:09,905
Madame, I'm very sorry,

584
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:13,342
but I have to have a few words with Fido first.

585
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:35,397
I really ought to send you home.

586
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:59,021
Happy Christmas, Fido.

587
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:03,719
I want your cock.

588
00:57:03,721 --> 00:57:05,120
What did you say?

589
00:57:05,122 --> 00:57:08,357
I want your cock.

590
00:57:08,359 --> 00:57:10,025
No. No, you don't.

591
00:57:10,027 --> 00:57:11,927
No, you don't. No.

592
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,999
What's the matter with you today?

593
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:41,490
On account of the holidays

594
00:57:41,492 --> 00:57:43,859
and your behavior today,

595
00:57:43,861 --> 00:57:47,029
I'm going to give you the original roman maximum

596
00:57:47,031 --> 00:57:49,765
of 40 lashes.
Are you ready, Fido?

597
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:53,669
I'm ready.

598
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:01,143
One.

599
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:04,546
<i>Two.</i>

600
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:07,816
<i>Three.</i>

601
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,787
<i>Four.</i>

602
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,156
<i>Five.</i>

603
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:17,860
<i>Six.</i>

604
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:33,709
<i>I'd seen through K's knot technique,</i>

605
00:58:33,711 --> 00:58:37,579
<i>so I was able to loosen my
position a bit to move my pelvis,</i>

606
00:58:37,581 --> 00:58:41,283
<i>and thereby stimulate my clitoris</i>
<i>against the cover of the book.</i>

607
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:21,623
And when you came home,

608
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:24,026
Jerome and the child were gone?

609
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:33,735
I haven't seen Marcel since.

610
00:59:37,975 --> 00:59:40,042
The sentimentality of...

611
00:59:40,044 --> 00:59:41,843
I hate it.

612
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:46,915
Why?

613
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:49,251
Because it's a lie.

614
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:55,023
Are you sure?

615
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:04,633
<i>Jerome understood that he couldn't prioritize</i>

616
01:00:04,635 --> 01:00:07,869
his life according to a child either.

617
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:11,607
So he put him in a foster home.

618
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:18,113
My only contact to the boy is the thousand pounds

619
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:20,082
I put in his account every month.

620
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:23,051
<i>Anonymously.</i>

621
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:27,222
<i>As a penance.</i>

622
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:47,376
After all this sadness, may I ask...

623
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:52,247
What happened to the silent duck?

624
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:54,616
Oh shit.

625
01:00:54,618 --> 01:00:58,854
The silent duck.
I'd forgotten all about it.

626
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:03,592
<i>One night K had been in what was for him</i>

627
01:01:03,594 --> 01:01:05,360
<i>an unusually good mood.</i>

628
01:01:05,362 --> 01:01:08,030
<i>I don't know what caused it, but he didn't hit hard</i>

629
01:01:08,032 --> 01:01:10,699
<i>and he joked that he would introduce me</i>

630
01:01:10,701 --> 01:01:13,869
<i>to the concept of the silent duck.</i>

631
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:34,690
<i>One hardly dare imagine</i>

632
01:01:34,692 --> 01:01:36,825
<i>"the quacking duck."</i>

633
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:47,469
Oh.

634
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:54,109
Well, deep down, little K seems to have been

635
01:01:54,111 --> 01:01:57,746
a jolly man with versatile talents.

636
01:01:57,748 --> 01:02:00,182
<i>But he got that bit about</i>

637
01:02:00,184 --> 01:02:02,951
roman punishment and the 40 lashes wrong.

638
01:02:02,953 --> 01:02:06,822
Because it's true that the highest
punishment was 40 lashes,

639
01:02:06,824 --> 01:02:09,391
but it had to be delivered in series of three.

640
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:13,195
<i>That's why Jesus only got 39 lashes,</i>

641
01:02:13,197 --> 01:02:15,163
because three goes into 39

642
01:02:15,165 --> 01:02:18,133
but not into 40.

643
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,473
You have a mirror.

644
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,075
Yes.

645
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:29,311
<i>It's like a thought, isn't it?</i>

646
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:36,351
Are you ready for another chapter?

647
01:02:36,353 --> 01:02:38,086
Go on.

648
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:06,081
<i>Some years later, the bodily abuse</i>

649
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:08,116
<i>began to have an effect.</i>

650
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:11,753
<i>First, rare bleedings from my clitoris,</i>

651
01:03:11,755 --> 01:03:14,556
<i>but then they became more and more frequent.</i>

652
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:25,901
<i>Come in.</i>

653
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:30,272
Have you heard any of the rumors about yourself?

654
01:03:34,343 --> 01:03:37,012
They say you see men every evening.

655
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:42,751
And spend all night with them.

656
01:03:42,753 --> 01:03:45,487
They say you can't be trusted--
all of them.

657
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,892
Why do they say that?

658
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:55,430
I suppose they're afraid that I...

659
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:58,300
I can't keep away from their men.

660
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:03,405
Right.

661
01:04:03,407 --> 01:04:06,141
- And can you?
- No.

662
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:12,180
I've spoken with a psychologist.

663
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:16,351
He says you're addicted, but that it's not

664
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:18,954
the kind of addiction that can't be treated.

665
01:04:18,956 --> 01:04:20,922
They have some groups.

666
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:24,793
I know about these kinds of groups.

667
01:04:24,795 --> 01:04:28,129
I don't have anything to say to a psychologist.

668
01:04:28,131 --> 01:04:30,599
I'm not suggesting therapy.
I'm demanding it.

669
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:35,036
Even if you leave us, it'll be the same at your next job

670
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:36,905
and the one after that.

671
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:46,448
My name is Joe...

672
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:48,083
Hi, Joe.

673
01:04:48,085 --> 01:04:49,885
...and I'm a nymphomaniac.

674
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:51,920
<i>Sex addict.</i>

675
01:04:51,922 --> 01:04:54,389
My name is Joe and I'm a nymphomaniac.

676
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:56,291
We say sex addict.

677
01:04:56,293 --> 01:04:57,993
Here everyone's the same.

678
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:03,431
You should only speak when you feel you have to.

679
01:05:06,002 --> 01:05:07,836
What you're saying is that

680
01:05:07,838 --> 01:05:10,305
no one can remove their sexuality

681
01:05:10,307 --> 01:05:12,974
even though it's destroying everything for them.

682
01:05:12,976 --> 01:05:15,143
<i>I wouldn't say no one.</i>

683
01:05:15,145 --> 01:05:17,512
But let's say, at most, one in a million

684
01:05:17,514 --> 01:05:20,181
manage to live a life without sexuality.

685
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:23,251
But you can't be basing your therapy

686
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:25,220
- ...on that one in a million.
- <i>No.</i>

687
01:05:25,222 --> 01:05:28,323
<i>The first and most important step</i>

688
01:05:28,325 --> 01:05:31,593
is to remove incentive and to reduce exposure.

689
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:37,032
You have to ask yourself what kind of incentives you have

690
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:40,902
and then make it difficult for yourself
to come into contact with them.

691
01:05:40,904 --> 01:05:43,471
<i>Basically anything that makes you think about sex.</i>

692
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:59,407
Joe has something she'd like to share.

693
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:03,111
My name is Joe...

694
01:08:03,113 --> 01:08:04,212
<i>Hi, Joe.</i>

695
01:08:04,214 --> 01:08:06,514
...and I'm a sex addict,

696
01:08:06,516 --> 01:08:10,018
but I haven't had sex for three weeks and five days.

697
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:15,023
<i>Tell us how you did it, Joe.</i>

698
01:08:15,025 --> 01:08:17,525
- You brought notes?
- Yes.

699
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:25,066
"Dear everyone,

700
01:08:25,068 --> 01:08:27,402
don't think it's been easy,

701
01:08:27,404 --> 01:08:31,573
but I understand now
that we are all alike."

702
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:48,690
<i>Are you okay, Joe?</i>

703
01:08:48,692 --> 01:08:50,725
Yes yes.

704
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:54,596
<i>Would you like a glass of water?</i>

705
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:58,133
Thank you.

706
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,407
Would you rather share another time?

707
01:09:12,548 --> 01:09:14,349
No, I'd like to speak.

708
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:22,190
Dear everyone,

709
01:09:22,192 --> 01:09:25,160
don't think it's been easy,

710
01:09:25,162 --> 01:09:27,529
but I understand now

711
01:09:27,531 --> 01:09:29,464
that we're not

712
01:09:29,466 --> 01:09:31,933
and never will be alike.

713
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:36,404
I'm not like you,

714
01:09:36,406 --> 01:09:38,740
who fucks to be validated

715
01:09:38,742 --> 01:09:41,643
and might just as well give up putting cocks inside you.

716
01:09:41,645 --> 01:09:43,711
And I'm not like you.

717
01:09:43,713 --> 01:09:46,247
All you want is to be filled up,

718
01:09:46,249 --> 01:09:48,750
and whether it's by a man or by tons

719
01:09:48,752 --> 01:09:52,587
of disgusting slop makes no difference.

720
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:56,524
And I'm definitely not like you.

721
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:58,893
<i>That empathy you claim</i>

722
01:09:58,895 --> 01:10:00,762
<i>is a lie,</i>

723
01:10:00,764 --> 01:10:04,599
because all you are is society's morality police,

724
01:10:04,601 --> 01:10:08,369
whose duty is to erase my obscenity

725
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:09,904
from the surface of the earth

726
01:10:09,906 --> 01:10:12,540
so that the bourgeoisie won't feel sick.

727
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:15,777
I'm not like you.

728
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:19,180
I am a nymphomaniac,

729
01:10:19,182 --> 01:10:21,749
and I love myself for being one.

730
01:10:21,751 --> 01:10:23,851
<i>But above all,</i>

731
01:10:23,853 --> 01:10:25,820
I love my cunt

732
01:10:25,822 --> 01:10:28,890
and my filthy, dirty lust.

733
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:36,464
<i>♪ Watch out ♪</i>

734
01:10:36,466 --> 01:10:38,700
<i>♪ you might get what you're after ♪</i>

01:10:38,702 --> 01:10:40,568
<i>♪ cool, babies ♪</i>

736
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:43,438
<i>♪ strange, but not a stranger ♪</i>

737
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:47,909
<i>♪ I'm an ordinary guy ♪</i>

738
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:50,011
<i>♪ burning down the house! ♪</i>

739
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:55,183
What just happened?

740
01:10:55,185 --> 01:10:56,818
I didn't get that...

741
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:58,720
With the car that burned.

742
01:10:58,722 --> 01:11:01,189
No, I'm sorry.

743
01:11:01,191 --> 01:11:04,592
I was just in too much of a hurry
to get to the last chapter.

744
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:15,303
I understood that society had no room for me,

745
01:11:15,305 --> 01:11:18,239
and I had no room for society

746
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:20,008
and never had.

747
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,618
<i>I'm sure it was quite natural for you</i>

748
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,920
<i>to furnish your room as a monk's cell,</i>

749
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:37,292
<i>but as an inspiration for the story chapter headings,</i>

750
01:11:37,294 --> 01:11:39,527
<i>it hasn't been easy.</i>

751
01:11:39,529 --> 01:11:43,531
There's simply nothing left for me to use.

752
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:47,335
Well, I'm sorry about that.

753
01:11:47,337 --> 01:11:50,371
But if I may, I can give you a tip.

754
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:53,341
Yes, please.

755
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:56,978
You know, I occupy myself mostly with text,

756
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:59,614
but sometimes the text can seem so...

757
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:04,619
So empty, so unfathomably empty.

758
01:12:04,621 --> 01:12:08,723
It could be the best text by the most famous author.

759
01:12:08,725 --> 01:12:11,959
The solution might be to change your point of view.

760
01:12:13,862 --> 01:12:15,563
I-I don't get that.

761
01:12:15,565 --> 01:12:17,799
Things hide...

762
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:20,768
When they become familiar.

763
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:23,705
But if you look at them from another angle,

764
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:27,775
<i>they might take on a new meaning.</i>

765
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:41,022
You're right.

766
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:43,491
Before this was just

767
01:12:43,493 --> 01:12:45,793
the stain from the tea I threw.

768
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:50,064
<i>Can you see what it could be?</i>

769
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:53,701
<i>A revolver.</i>

770
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:56,971
No, a revolver has a drum that revolves.

771
01:12:56,973 --> 01:12:59,674
It's a pistol.

772
01:12:59,676 --> 01:13:01,743
<i>Can you see what kind it could be?</i>

773
01:13:01,745 --> 01:13:03,578
<i>No, I don't remember</i>

774
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:05,546
anything like that from my literature.

775
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:08,082
Oh, but it's something I can remember from mine.

776
01:13:08,084 --> 01:13:09,150
Ian Fleming.

777
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:12,086
Not familiar.

778
01:13:12,088 --> 01:13:15,590
If you haven't read that, you
haven't read anything at all.

779
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:20,461
This could be, with a little imagination,

780
01:13:20,463 --> 01:13:23,698
a walther P.P.K. Automatic,

781
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:26,434
the same gun that was issued to bond

782
01:13:26,436 --> 01:13:29,904
<i>after his preferred pistol, the beretta, had jammed.</i>

783
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,641
Is that something you can use?

784
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:37,612
Oh yes, it is.

785
01:13:37,614 --> 01:13:39,046
<i>♪ Burning down the house! ♪</i>

786
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:42,784
<i>♪ Hold tight ♪</i>

01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:46,721
<i>♪ hold tight... ♪</i>

01:13:46,723 --> 01:13:48,556
<i>Whether I left society,</i>

790
01:13:48,558 --> 01:13:50,958
<i>or it left me, I cannot say.</i>

791
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:54,128
<i>I suppose you could make an argument for both sides.</i>

792
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:56,063
<i>♪ Burning down the house! ♪</i>

793
01:13:56,065 --> 01:13:58,132
<i>I was on my way to the shady side</i>

794
01:13:58,134 --> 01:14:00,034
<i>of the debt-collecting business,</i>

795
01:14:00,036 --> 01:14:02,870
<i>which among other things involved stuff</i>

796
01:14:02,872 --> 01:14:04,972
<i>like burning people's cars.</i>

797
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:10,578
<i>I had for a long time known about this man, L.</i>

798
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:17,819
Hi, my name is Joe.

799
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:20,688
I know that.

800
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:22,757
Come in.

801
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:28,896
I'm looking for a job.

802
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:32,533
I've been working in an office,

803
01:14:32,535 --> 01:14:34,469
and I was never really good at it.

804
01:14:34,471 --> 01:14:36,771
I can understand that.
I mean,

805
01:14:36,773 --> 01:14:38,806
what's the point?

806
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:41,476
I believe I possess some qualifications

807
01:14:41,478 --> 01:14:44,145
and that I'm rather unscrupulous.

808
01:14:44,147 --> 01:14:46,013
<i>I know all about your qualifications</i>

809
01:14:46,015 --> 01:14:47,748
and they're excellent.

810
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,817
<i>I would suggest</i>

811
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:52,954
that you start your own little business

812
01:14:52,956 --> 01:14:54,755
with my help.

813
01:14:54,757 --> 01:14:56,524
<i>I understand</i>

814
01:14:56,526 --> 01:14:59,427
<i>you possess a great deal of insight</i>

815
01:14:59,429 --> 01:15:01,896
<i>about a rather broad spectrum of men.</i>

816
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:06,734
This could be... or should
be capitalized on.

817
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:09,837
<i>I need sub-contractors who can put</i>

818
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:12,006
<i>moderate pressure on individuals</i>

819
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:14,842
<i>with whom my clients rightly or wrongly</i>

820
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:17,211
have a bone to pick.
Understand?

821
01:15:17,213 --> 01:15:19,046
Extortion.

822
01:15:19,048 --> 01:15:20,281
No.
No no no no.

823
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:24,485
<i>I always prefer the term</i>

824
01:15:24,487 --> 01:15:26,053
"debt collection."

825
01:15:27,623 --> 01:15:29,190
- Yeah.
- I refrain from judging

826
01:15:29,192 --> 01:15:31,158
whether my clients' wishes

827
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,594
are legitimate or otherwise.

828
01:15:33,596 --> 01:15:35,496
A point of view

829
01:15:35,498 --> 01:15:38,299
I strongly recommend you follow.

830
01:15:40,168 --> 01:15:41,969
<i>My main qualification of course</i>

831
01:15:41,971 --> 01:15:44,739
<i>was my considerable experience with men and sex.</i>

832
01:15:44,741 --> 01:15:48,309
<i>But even my more specialized skills came in handy.</i>

833
01:16:11,501 --> 01:16:14,535
No, now this is not how it goes.

834
01:16:14,537 --> 01:16:16,871
You have to wait until you're hit.

835
01:16:20,109 --> 01:16:23,244
<i>The two helpers that L had recommended were okay,</i>

836
01:16:23,246 --> 01:16:26,948
<i>but they were predisposed to a
rather repetitive technique,</i>

837
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:31,118
<i>which consisted of creating as much havoc as possible</i>

838
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,254
<i>with a pair of iron bars.</i>

839
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:52,206
Destroying your things doesn't
seem to have much effect on you.

840
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:54,642
<i>Here was a man</i>

841
01:16:54,644 --> 01:16:56,744
<i>I was unable to read sexually,</i>

842
01:16:56,746 --> 01:16:58,746
<i>so I became persistent.</i>

843
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:01,382
Tie him to the chair.

844
01:17:03,018 --> 01:17:05,086
Don't hurt him.

845
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:10,591
I can't find a stain on you,

846
01:17:10,593 --> 01:17:14,729
but my experience tells me that no man is spotless.

847
01:17:14,731 --> 01:17:16,764
<i>Luckily, you're equipped</i>

848
01:17:16,766 --> 01:17:19,333
with a very reliable truth-detector.

849
01:17:29,746 --> 01:17:32,780
I'm going to tell you a few stories.

850
01:17:32,782 --> 01:17:35,216
All you have to do is listen.

851
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:41,055
You're in a bar watching a couple...

852
01:17:41,057 --> 01:17:43,357
<i>I now meticulously went through the catalog</i>

853
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:46,293
<i>of sexual deviations in fictional form.</i>

854
01:17:46,295 --> 01:17:49,897
<i>Stories about sadomasochism,</i>

855
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:52,767
<i>fetishism, homosexuality,</i>

856
01:17:52,769 --> 01:17:54,635
<i>you name it.</i>

857
01:17:54,637 --> 01:17:56,237
<i>But he didn't react.</i>

858
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:59,040
<i>And I'd almost given up</i>

859
01:17:59,042 --> 01:18:02,777
on your way home, you walk through the park.

860
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:09,984
<i>And something makes you stop.</i>

861
01:18:11,286 --> 01:18:13,220
You hear something.

862
01:18:27,202 --> 01:18:28,936
Yes, that's it.

863
01:18:28,938 --> 01:18:31,772
You can hear the children on the playground.

864
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:35,643
<i>You sit on a bench nearby</i>

865
01:18:35,645 --> 01:18:37,878
and watch them play.

866
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:41,148
There's a little boy in shorts.

867
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:45,086
He's playing in the sandpit.

868
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:49,023
He looks at you

869
01:18:49,025 --> 01:18:51,859
with his blue eyes.

870
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,429
<i>He smiles at you.</i>

871
01:18:55,431 --> 01:18:57,965
<i>I think he comes to you.</i>

872
01:18:57,967 --> 01:19:01,001
<i>He sits on your lap</i>

873
01:19:01,003 --> 01:19:02,770
and looks up at your face.

874
01:19:03,872 --> 01:19:05,372
<i>He says</i>

875
01:19:05,374 --> 01:19:08,075
he'd like to come home with you.

876
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:15,015
At home you can't fight the idea

877
01:19:15,017 --> 01:19:17,184
<i>of being naked together.</i>

878
01:19:17,186 --> 01:19:19,887
He crawls all over you.

879
01:19:19,889 --> 01:19:24,058
- <i>You get an erection.</i>
- Won't you please stop?

880
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:27,728
He lies on his stomach.

881
01:19:27,730 --> 01:19:29,864
<i>You pull down his pants.</i>

882
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:32,266
<i>I'll pay!</i>

883
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:06,567
You did what?

884
01:20:07,502 --> 01:20:09,170
<i>I gave him a blowjob.</i>

885
01:20:09,172 --> 01:20:11,205
Why?
That pig?!

886
01:20:11,207 --> 01:20:14,008
- I took pity on him.
- <i>Pity?</i>

887
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:17,344
Yes.
I had just destroyed his life.

888
01:20:17,346 --> 01:20:20,247
Nobody knew his secret,

889
01:20:20,249 --> 01:20:22,483
most probably not even himself.

890
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:25,553
<i>He sat there with the shame.</i>

891
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:30,057
<i>I suppose I sucked him off as a kind of apology.</i>

892
01:20:30,059 --> 01:20:31,325
That's unbelievable.

893
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:34,328
No, listen to me.
This is a man

894
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:37,798
who'd succeeded in repressing his own desire,

895
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,167
<i>who had never before given into it</i>

896
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:43,003
<i>right up until I forced it out.</i>

897
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:45,406
He had lived a life full of denial

898
01:20:45,408 --> 01:20:47,808
and had never hurt a soul.

899
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:49,543
I think that's laudable.

900
01:20:51,079 --> 01:20:52,513
No matter how hard I try,

901
01:20:52,515 --> 01:20:55,049
I can't find anything laudable in pedophilia.

902
01:20:55,051 --> 01:20:56,784
That's because you think about

903
01:20:56,786 --> 01:21:00,187
the perhaps 5% who actually hurt children.

904
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:02,790
The remaining 95%

905
01:21:02,792 --> 01:21:05,793
never live out their fantasies.

906
01:21:05,795 --> 01:21:08,395
<i>Think about their suffering.</i>

907
01:21:08,397 --> 01:21:11,198
<i>Sexuality is the strongest force</i>

908
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,067
<i>in human beings.</i>

909
01:21:13,069 --> 01:21:15,903
<i>To be born with a forbidden sexuality</i>

910
01:21:15,905 --> 01:21:17,638
must be agonizing.

911
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:21,575
The pedophile who manages to get through life

912
01:21:21,577 --> 01:21:24,245
with the shame of his desire

913
01:21:24,247 --> 01:21:28,182
while never acting on it deserves a bloody medal.

914
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:35,990
<i>But there was another reason for my sympathy,</i>

915
01:21:35,992 --> 01:21:38,292
<i>which you find so mysterious.</i>

916
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:44,098
<i>I saw a man who was carrying the same cross as myself.</i>

917
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:49,303
Loneliness.

918
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:55,109
We were both sexual outcasts.

919
01:22:04,052 --> 01:22:06,553
<i>In any case, some years passed,</i>

920
01:22:06,555 --> 01:22:08,389
<i>during which my business grew,</i>

921
01:22:08,391 --> 01:22:11,926
<i>enabling me to step up my anonymous deposits</i>

922
01:22:11,928 --> 01:22:13,494
<i>to Marcel.</i>

923
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:17,598
Your business is doing great...

924
01:22:19,334 --> 01:22:22,436
You complete all the jobs I give you to perfection

925
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:25,339
<i>and I hear only words of praise from your other clients.</i>

926
01:22:25,341 --> 01:22:27,308
<i>But...</i>

927
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:30,144
- But what?
- ...We aren't getting any younger.

928
01:22:30,146 --> 01:22:32,980
Oh.
No, that's for sure.

929
01:22:32,982 --> 01:22:35,516
I think you're getting to that age

930
01:22:35,518 --> 01:22:38,385
where you have to start thinking about a successor.

931
01:22:38,387 --> 01:22:40,421
Ohhh.

932
01:22:40,423 --> 01:22:42,723
- I don't need a fucking successor.
- <i>Listen.</i>

933
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:47,328
A person should take their crime seriously.

934
01:22:47,330 --> 01:22:49,930
You need someone

935
01:22:49,932 --> 01:22:52,299
to be your right hand, someone to help you.

936
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:54,601
<i>A crown princess.</i>

937
01:22:56,571 --> 01:22:59,106
The normal process

938
01:22:59,108 --> 01:23:01,275
<i>is to find out what colleagues</i>

939
01:23:01,277 --> 01:23:03,677
are in prison or are drug addicts,

940
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:05,913
and thereby unable to fulfill

941
01:23:05,915 --> 01:23:07,481
their roles as parents.

942
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:12,453
<i>Then you find out where their kids play football...</i>

943
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:15,556
<i>And you get involved.</i>

944
01:23:15,558 --> 01:23:17,591
<i>You cheer them on for a couple of years</i>

945
01:23:17,593 --> 01:23:20,494
<i>no matter how bad they are.</i>
<i>Actually, the worse, the better.</i>

946
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:22,563
<i>That way</i>

947
01:23:22,565 --> 01:23:25,466
gradually you take on the role of the parent

948
01:23:25,468 --> 01:23:27,601
<i>until in the end</i>

949
01:23:27,603 --> 01:23:31,305
<i>you have a loyal helper that
will walk through fire for you.</i>

950
01:23:32,707 --> 01:23:34,475
<i>Even do time for you.</i>

951
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,280
It sounds like a...

952
01:23:40,282 --> 01:23:43,050
Kind of an entrapment you're suggesting.

953
01:23:43,052 --> 01:23:46,220
- An unsavory entrapment.
- Call it what you want,

954
01:23:46,222 --> 01:23:48,622
but if you believe at all

955
01:23:48,624 --> 01:23:50,724
in the effects of good parenting,

956
01:23:50,726 --> 01:23:53,260
that kid will have much greater opportunities

957
01:23:53,262 --> 01:23:55,496
with you as a mentor than without.

958
01:23:56,998 --> 01:23:59,066
<i>And since I like you,</i>

959
01:23:59,068 --> 01:24:02,302
<i>I've been looking around for a suitable subject.</i>

960
01:24:02,304 --> 01:24:05,272
<i>She's 15 years old</i>

961
01:24:05,274 --> 01:24:08,375
from a family of hardened criminals,

962
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:10,677
and she's been through a lot.

963
01:24:10,679 --> 01:24:13,580
<i>Last couple of years she's been institutionalized.</i>

964
01:24:13,582 --> 01:24:17,051
Her father is in prison and her
mother died of an overdose.

965
01:24:17,053 --> 01:24:18,619
She's a smart girl.

966
01:24:18,621 --> 01:24:20,754
<i>And although she doesn't play football,</i>

967
01:24:20,756 --> 01:24:23,323
she does play basketball...
Very badly.

968
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:27,294
She's chosen a team sport

969
01:24:27,296 --> 01:24:29,296
because she's lonely.

970
01:24:33,002 --> 01:24:36,303
<i>Her right ear is slightly deformed...</i>

971
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:40,441
<i>Which she's very ashamed of,</i>

972
01:24:40,443 --> 01:24:43,510
and of course this serves to isolate her even more.

973
01:24:43,512 --> 01:24:45,446
It makes her an easy target

974
01:24:45,448 --> 01:24:48,615
<i>for even the slightest bit of attention</i>

975
01:24:48,617 --> 01:24:52,386
or sign of empathy from you.

976
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:59,026
<i>Despite my protests,</i>

977
01:24:59,028 --> 01:25:00,694
<i>the clever L somehow talked me</i>

978
01:25:00,696 --> 01:25:02,563
<i>into actually having a look at P.</i>

979
01:25:05,101 --> 01:25:08,102
<i>The longer I watched the poor girl with the deformed ear,</i>

980
01:25:08,104 --> 01:25:11,238
<i>the more repulsive I found the whole plan.</i>

981
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:41,168
<i>But as if L had foreseen this,</i>

982
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:45,139
<i>the meeting with P filled me with pity and emotion.</i>

983
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:48,609
<i>And without wanting to,</i>

984
01:25:48,611 --> 01:25:51,478
<i>I found myself, weekend after weekend,</i>

985
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:55,182
<i>at her games supporting the poor player.</i>

986
01:26:10,698 --> 01:26:12,366
Thanks for cheering me on.

987
01:26:12,368 --> 01:26:13,901
You're welcome.

988
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:17,271
You played really well today.

989
01:26:19,307 --> 01:26:22,176
- No, I didn't.
- You did.

990
01:26:22,178 --> 01:26:24,545
You really improved yourself lately.

991
01:26:27,882 --> 01:26:30,284
<i>I was proud to introduce P</i>

992
01:26:30,286 --> 01:26:32,452
<i>to my father's passion...</i>

993
01:26:32,454 --> 01:26:34,221
<i>And to his world.</i>

994
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:40,394
It's actually...

995
01:26:42,263 --> 01:26:43,830
The souls of the trees

996
01:26:43,832 --> 01:26:45,766
<i>that we see in the winter.</i>

997
01:26:52,774 --> 01:26:54,775
I think they look like human souls.

998
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:00,881
You're right.

999
01:27:00,883 --> 01:27:03,884
They do look like human souls.

1000
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:06,920
<i>Twisted souls,</i>

1001
01:27:06,922 --> 01:27:09,289
<i>regular souls, crazy souls.</i>

1002
01:27:10,825 --> 01:27:13,594
All depending on the kind of lives human beings lead.

1003
01:27:18,766 --> 01:27:20,467
I found my tree,

1004
01:27:20,469 --> 01:27:22,569
my soul tree.

1005
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,274
This is my tree.

1006
01:27:30,812 --> 01:27:32,946
<i>It's not an ash tree.</i>

1007
01:27:32,948 --> 01:27:34,781
<i>No, it's an oak tree.</i>

1008
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:48,395
<i>My father found his soul tree,</i>

1009
01:27:48,397 --> 01:27:50,731
but I've...
I've never found mine.

1010
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,368
"You will know it when you see it,"

1011
01:27:54,370 --> 01:27:56,536
that's what he said.

1012
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:04,478
<i>When P reached the age of majority</i>

1013
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,980
<i>and I became her personal advisor,</i>

1014
01:28:06,982 --> 01:28:09,583
<i>I asked her to move in with me.</i>

1015
01:28:16,457 --> 01:28:18,292
I've never seen you with your hair up.

1016
01:28:19,227 --> 01:28:21,328
It's so pretty.

1017
01:28:33,742 --> 01:28:37,010
<i>All this time all my sexual activity had stopped.</i>

1018
01:28:37,012 --> 01:28:40,580
<i>My groin was one big sore from my abuse</i>

1019
01:28:40,582 --> 01:28:42,416
<i>that wouldn't heal</i>

1020
01:28:42,418 --> 01:28:44,785
<i>and made even masturbation impossible.</i>

1021
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:52,426
<i>I experienced definite abstinence symptoms:</i>

1022
01:28:52,428 --> 01:28:54,494
<i>Fever and cramps.</i>

1023
01:29:08,976 --> 01:29:10,544
Joe, what's going on?

1024
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:15,749
- Careful.
- We need to clear this up.

1025
01:29:25,426 --> 01:29:27,427
I just get this sometimes.

1026
01:29:30,998 --> 01:29:32,632
It's okay, it's okay.

1027
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:36,002
<i>Perhaps she really loved you.</i>

1028
01:29:37,739 --> 01:29:39,773
I couldn't accept it.

1029
01:29:39,775 --> 01:29:42,976
Perhaps because you really wanted it to be true.

1030
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:47,547
Perhaps I hoped it.

1031
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:49,983
<i>It's very touching, all this about P.</i>

1032
01:29:52,787 --> 01:29:55,455
Then you've probably misunderstood the whole thing.

1033
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:26,052
Don't.

1034
01:30:27,622 --> 01:30:28,955
I wanna see you.

1035
01:30:28,957 --> 01:30:30,857
- Don't.
- Why?

1036
01:30:30,859 --> 01:30:32,626
- Please don't.
- Why not?

1037
01:30:32,628 --> 01:30:35,695
No.
No, I have a wound.

1038
01:30:35,697 --> 01:30:38,031
- I have a wound.
- It doesn't matter.

1039
01:30:38,033 --> 01:30:39,900
No, you don't understand.

1040
01:30:39,902 --> 01:30:42,602
I have that thing with my ear.

1041
01:30:42,604 --> 01:30:44,538
<i>I'm so ashamed.</i>

1042
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:24,077
D'you like me?

1043
01:31:28,082 --> 01:31:29,816
You're so beautiful.

1044
01:33:00,675 --> 01:33:02,742
There's one thing I don't understand.

1045
01:33:04,512 --> 01:33:06,713
Did she know what you did for a living?

1046
01:33:07,848 --> 01:33:09,783
P was very discreet

1047
01:33:09,785 --> 01:33:12,052
and a girl of few words.

1048
01:33:13,554 --> 01:33:16,189
Oddly, although I worked strange hours,

1049
01:33:16,191 --> 01:33:18,658
she never asked about my work.

1050
01:33:20,294 --> 01:33:22,162
<i>But one day she had a question.</i>

1051
01:33:24,198 --> 01:33:26,166
Joe?

1052
01:33:31,105 --> 01:33:34,240
Why did you start coming to my basketball matches?

1053
01:33:36,944 --> 01:33:39,045
It wasn't a coincidence, was it?

1054
01:33:45,553 --> 01:33:47,687
No, it wasn't a coincidence.

1055
01:33:51,926 --> 01:33:54,194
I didn't tell you because I...

1056
01:33:55,563 --> 01:33:57,864
I thought you'd be upset...

1057
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:01,635
And that you'd get angry at me.

1058
01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:04,337
I won't get angry.

1059
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:11,177
What I do...

1060
01:34:13,247 --> 01:34:15,582
My job isn't a normal job.

1061
01:34:15,584 --> 01:34:17,784
It's not legal.

1062
01:34:17,786 --> 01:34:20,654
No one in my family does anything legal.

1063
01:34:26,694 --> 01:34:28,895
<i>A man that's helped me in my business</i>

1064
01:34:28,897 --> 01:34:30,530
<i>suggested that I watched you.</i>

1065
01:34:33,968 --> 01:34:35,869
The plan was that I...

1066
01:34:35,871 --> 01:34:38,371
I should look at you

1067
01:34:38,373 --> 01:34:40,907
to see whether one day

1068
01:34:40,909 --> 01:34:42,409
I could use you in my work.

1069
01:34:43,377 --> 01:34:45,679
I should make friends with you,

1070
01:34:45,681 --> 01:34:49,149
because I knew you didn't have a mother or a father.

1071
01:34:49,151 --> 01:34:50,817
What's wrong with that?

1072
01:34:51,986 --> 01:34:54,754
Don't you see how evil that plan was?

1073
01:34:54,756 --> 01:34:57,090
<i>I felt terrible.</i>

1074
01:34:57,092 --> 01:34:59,092
You shouldn't have.

1075
01:34:59,094 --> 01:35:00,960
Why not?

1076
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:06,032
Because if you hadn't...

1077
01:35:07,968 --> 01:35:09,769
We'd never have met.

1078
01:35:15,409 --> 01:35:18,144
I'd like to go with you to work

1079
01:35:18,146 --> 01:35:20,346
- ...next time.
- No.

1080
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:31,725
Will you think about it?

1081
01:35:31,727 --> 01:35:33,693
- No.
- Yes.

1082
01:35:33,695 --> 01:35:34,861
No.

1083
01:35:34,863 --> 01:35:37,664
She didn't take no for an answer.

1084
01:35:37,666 --> 01:35:39,699
No, of course not.

1085
01:35:39,701 --> 01:35:43,136
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

1086
01:35:46,173 --> 01:35:49,142
With the risk of being too clever for myself,

1087
01:35:49,144 --> 01:35:51,745
social inheritance

1088
01:35:51,747 --> 01:35:54,147
is an irrefutable fact.

1089
01:35:54,149 --> 01:35:57,383
If anyone knew about the laws of the street,

1090
01:35:57,385 --> 01:35:59,085
it must've been P.

1091
01:36:01,222 --> 01:36:03,490
You're more right than you know.

1092
01:36:05,693 --> 01:36:07,927
Let's shoot the fucker.

1093
01:36:08,996 --> 01:36:10,964
Stop! Stop!

1094
01:36:15,402 --> 01:36:17,270
We don't use firearms.

1095
01:36:19,006 --> 01:36:22,976
- I'd like to have the gun.
- The others have weapons too.

1096
01:36:23,944 --> 01:36:25,912
Well, I didn't know that.

1097
01:36:25,914 --> 01:36:28,047
But in any case, you're not to have one.

1098
01:36:28,049 --> 01:36:30,383
But guns aren't dangerous.

1099
01:36:30,385 --> 01:36:33,186
It depends on how you use them.

1100
01:36:33,188 --> 01:36:34,888
Yes, exactly.

1101
01:36:34,890 --> 01:36:36,823
<i>I wasn't going to shoot him.</i>

1102
01:36:36,825 --> 01:36:39,959
We wouldn't have gotten any money out of him that way.

1103
01:36:39,961 --> 01:36:41,427
<i>Can I have the gun?</i>

1104
01:36:45,966 --> 01:36:47,901
Thank you.

1105
01:37:07,955 --> 01:37:09,289
You're evil.

1106
01:37:14,328 --> 01:37:17,864
<i>And now I'm afraid one of those coincidences</i>

1107
01:37:17,866 --> 01:37:19,365
<i>you have such a hard time with</i>

1108
01:37:19,367 --> 01:37:22,135
<i>occurred with a very special person.</i>

1109
01:37:24,038 --> 01:37:26,906
<i>It was P's job to take us to the debtors,</i>

1110
01:37:26,908 --> 01:37:29,075
<i>so until I saw the name on the door,</i>

1111
01:37:29,077 --> 01:37:31,611
<i>I had no idea whose house we were at.</i>

1112
01:37:35,916 --> 01:37:37,951
Are you sure this is the right place?

1113
01:37:37,953 --> 01:37:39,352
<i>Yeah.</i>

1114
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:48,328
I was thinking maybe it's time

1115
01:37:48,330 --> 01:37:51,931
for you to do this one on your own.

1116
01:37:51,933 --> 01:37:53,466
Yeah?

1117
01:37:55,502 --> 01:37:56,870
Thank you, Joe.

1118
01:37:56,872 --> 01:37:59,072
I don't want anything destroyed

1119
01:37:59,074 --> 01:38:01,274
and I don't want anybody hurt.

1120
01:38:01,276 --> 01:38:04,244
Okay?
You just show yourself

1121
01:38:04,246 --> 01:38:07,146
and offer him a reasonable payment plan.

1122
01:38:08,148 --> 01:38:10,116
If you say so.

1123
01:38:10,118 --> 01:38:11,651
Of course that's how I'll do it.

1124
01:38:27,167 --> 01:38:29,602
<i>Whether the feeling when I saw Jerome again</i>

1125
01:38:29,604 --> 01:38:31,404
<i>was love, I couldn't say.</i>

1126
01:38:34,475 --> 01:38:36,509
<i>But it was a feeling,</i>

1127
01:38:36,511 --> 01:38:39,345
<i>and far stronger than I liked.</i>

1128
01:38:51,358 --> 01:38:54,160
<i>I was actually walking home through the alley here.</i>

1129
01:38:55,596 --> 01:38:58,264
<i>No two neighborhoods are totally different</i>

1130
01:38:58,266 --> 01:39:00,366
<i>but still so close together</i>

1131
01:39:00,368 --> 01:39:02,635
<i>that the shortest route from Jerome's house</i>

1132
01:39:02,637 --> 01:39:05,471
<i>towards the center was through the alley.</i>

1133
01:39:12,614 --> 01:39:14,881
Hello!

1134
01:39:14,883 --> 01:39:16,883
How did it go?

1135
01:39:16,885 --> 01:39:18,985
Brilliant.

1136
01:39:18,987 --> 01:39:20,586
<i>Yeah, really well.</i>

1137
01:39:22,222 --> 01:39:25,024
I made a reasonable payment plan like you told me to.

1138
01:39:25,026 --> 01:39:26,526
How did he look?

1139
01:39:27,895 --> 01:39:29,963
Scared.

1140
01:39:29,965 --> 01:39:32,498
How old did he look?

1141
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:34,434
I dunno.

1142
01:39:34,436 --> 01:39:36,002
Ancient?

1143
01:39:55,389 --> 01:39:59,625
<i>Jerome was to pay off his debt in six payments.</i>

1144
01:39:59,627 --> 01:40:02,528
<i>Every time P went to Jerome to collect,</i>

1145
01:40:02,530 --> 01:40:04,664
<i>I paced around restlessly</i>

1146
01:40:04,666 --> 01:40:07,033
<i>until she was back home again.</i>

1147
01:40:09,236 --> 01:40:13,006
<i>I even had to find my mother's sad old solitaire cards</i>

1148
01:40:13,008 --> 01:40:15,641
<i>in order to make the hours pass.</i>

1149
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:26,319
<i>Each night I was less reassured by her coming home</i>

1150
01:40:26,321 --> 01:40:28,154
<i>than the night before.</i>

1151
01:40:28,156 --> 01:40:31,557
<i>The question of whether jealousy is the fear of sharing</i>

1152
01:40:31,559 --> 01:40:34,961
<i>or the fear of losing was of little interest to me.</i>

1153
01:40:34,963 --> 01:40:37,230
<i>But yes, it was a fact</i>

1154
01:40:37,232 --> 01:40:41,100
<i>that this unworthy feeling I had
managed to suppress for so long</i>

1155
01:40:41,102 --> 01:40:43,136
<i>was creeping up on me.</i>

1156
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:49,075
<i>The evening she was to collect the final payment</i>

1157
01:40:49,077 --> 01:40:50,977
<i>she didn't kiss me.</i>

1158
01:40:50,979 --> 01:40:53,346
<i>I took it to be forgetfulness,</i>

1159
01:40:53,348 --> 01:40:56,783
<i>but the hours passed and she didn't return.</i>

1160
01:41:04,658 --> 01:41:07,026
<i>Every time I saw car lights,</i>

1161
01:41:07,028 --> 01:41:09,462
<i>I thought it was P being driven home.</i>

1162
01:42:11,792 --> 01:42:14,560
<i>I had decided to flee.</i>

1163
01:42:14,562 --> 01:42:18,164
<i>I couldn't stay in this town with her and him.</i>

1164
01:42:19,766 --> 01:42:23,136
<i>I had cowardly made a plan to escape and head south,</i>

1165
01:42:23,138 --> 01:42:26,472
<i>like from some ice age I didn't have the guts</i>

1166
01:42:26,474 --> 01:42:29,142
<i>to turn around and face.</i>

1167
01:42:29,144 --> 01:42:33,446
<i>But the goodbye was sad and strangely unfulfilling.</i>

1168
01:42:33,448 --> 01:42:35,648
<i>And something called me on</i>

1169
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:37,850
<i>to seek further up the Mountain.</i>

1170
01:43:52,359 --> 01:43:55,494
It's said to be difficult to take someone's life.

1171
01:43:55,496 --> 01:43:59,498
<i>I would've said that it's more difficult not to.</i>

1172
01:44:00,867 --> 01:44:02,535
For a human being,

1173
01:44:02,537 --> 01:44:04,971
killing is the most natural thing in the world.

1174
01:44:06,273 --> 01:44:08,541
We're created for it.

1175
01:44:10,510 --> 01:44:12,545
Wonderful.

1176
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:04,530
<i>No, get off!</i>

1177
01:45:04,532 --> 01:45:07,366
Sorry.

1178
01:45:14,408 --> 01:45:16,542
Fireman's grip.

1179
01:47:37,018 --> 01:47:39,785
Oh. Oh yeah.

1180
01:49:08,174 --> 01:49:11,577
Fill all my holes please.

1181
01:49:32,766 --> 01:49:35,634
I still don't know why the gun didn't work.

1182
01:49:35,636 --> 01:49:37,169
<i>I did check to make sure</i>

1183
01:49:37,171 --> 01:49:39,204
<i>that there were bullets in the magazine.</i>

1184
01:49:40,507 --> 01:49:42,675
<i>It simply malfunctioned,</i>

1185
01:49:42,677 --> 01:49:45,878
<i>just like bond's beretta.</i>

1186
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:47,913
<i>I think I know enough to say that</i>

1187
01:49:47,915 --> 01:49:51,150
<i>even if you had rounds in the
magazine of the walther P.P.K.,</i>

1188
01:49:51,152 --> 01:49:53,586
and you'd taken off the safety...

1189
01:49:54,854 --> 01:49:57,823
You cannot shoot until you rack the gun.

1190
01:49:57,825 --> 01:50:01,994
You pull and release the sliding mechanism.

1191
01:50:03,630 --> 01:50:05,931
And P hadn't done it because, as she said,

1192
01:50:05,933 --> 01:50:08,601
she had no intention of shooting the man.

1193
01:50:10,670 --> 01:50:13,606
I don't know about bond, but I
assume it has to be apparent

1194
01:50:13,608 --> 01:50:15,874
from his books and his films that

1195
01:50:15,876 --> 01:50:18,877
you have to rack an automatic pistol.

1196
01:50:19,946 --> 01:50:22,214
Of course, you're right.

1197
01:50:23,783 --> 01:50:26,785
I've seen it in films a thousand times.

1198
01:50:32,058 --> 01:50:33,292
It's morning.

1199
01:50:36,129 --> 01:50:37,830
And the snow is gone.

1200
01:50:37,832 --> 01:50:39,999
So the sun must be out?

1201
01:50:40,001 --> 01:50:42,301
Yes, there is sun.

1202
01:50:48,241 --> 01:50:51,010
I've never managed to figure out where it comes from.

1203
01:50:52,646 --> 01:50:54,747
<i>It must be some interplay</i>

1204
01:50:54,749 --> 01:50:57,349
<i>between windows</i>

1205
01:50:57,351 --> 01:51:00,352
<i>and towers and high buildings.</i>

1206
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:05,658
It's not much,

1207
01:51:05,660 --> 01:51:08,694
but it's the sun you get here at my place.

1208
01:51:13,099 --> 01:51:14,667
It's beautiful.

1209
01:51:25,245 --> 01:51:27,746
<i>In the beginning you said that</i>

1210
01:51:27,748 --> 01:51:30,949
<i>your only sin was that you asked more of the sunset.</i>

1211
01:51:32,852 --> 01:51:34,820
Meaning, I suppose, that you wanted

1212
01:51:34,822 --> 01:51:36,922
more from life than was good for you.

1213
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:42,961
<i>You were a human being demanding your right.</i>

1214
01:51:42,963 --> 01:51:45,698
<i>And more than that,</i>

1215
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:48,834
<i>you were a woman demanding her right.</i>

1216
01:51:51,871 --> 01:51:54,173
Does that pardon everything?

1217
01:51:55,975 --> 01:51:57,676
Do you think if two men

1218
01:51:57,678 --> 01:52:00,012
would've walked down a train looking for women,

1219
01:52:00,014 --> 01:52:03,215
<i>do you think anybody would have raised an eyebrow?</i>

1220
01:52:04,651 --> 01:52:07,419
<i>Or if a man had led the life you had?</i>

1221
01:52:09,089 --> 01:52:11,857
<i>And the story about Mrs. h</i>

1222
01:52:11,859 --> 01:52:15,294
<i>would've been extremely banal if you'd been a man</i>

1223
01:52:15,296 --> 01:52:18,197
and your conquest would have been a woman.

1224
01:52:19,733 --> 01:52:22,201
When a man leaves his children

1225
01:52:22,203 --> 01:52:24,870
<i>because of desire,</i>

1226
01:52:24,872 --> 01:52:27,673
<i>we accept it with a shrug, but you as a woman,</i>

1227
01:52:27,675 --> 01:52:31,810
<i>you had to take on a...</i>
<i>A guilt, a burden of guilt</i>

1228
01:52:31,812 --> 01:52:33,846
<i>that could never be alleviated.</i>

1229
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:40,352
<i>And all in all, all the blame and guilt</i>

1230
01:52:40,354 --> 01:52:43,956
that piled up over the years became too much for you,

1231
01:52:43,958 --> 01:52:47,426
you reacted aggressively--
almost like a man I have to say...

1232
01:52:47,428 --> 01:52:49,194
<i>And you fought back.</i>

1233
01:52:50,463 --> 01:52:52,998
You fought back against the gender that had been

1234
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
oppressing and mutilating

1235
01:52:55,002 --> 01:52:57,536
and killing you and billions of women.

1236
01:52:59,806 --> 01:53:02,541
But I wanted to kill a human being.

1237
01:53:05,979 --> 01:53:08,113
<i>But you didn't.</i>

1238
01:53:10,016 --> 01:53:12,184
<i>Because of a chance event.</i>

1239
01:53:12,186 --> 01:53:15,053
<i>You call it a chance event.</i>

1240
01:53:16,122 --> 01:53:19,124
I call it subconscious resistance.

1241
01:53:19,126 --> 01:53:21,960
On the surface you wanted to kill,

1242
01:53:21,962 --> 01:53:25,097
but deep down you celebrated human worth

1243
01:53:25,099 --> 01:53:27,866
and a veil of forgetfulness

1244
01:53:27,868 --> 01:53:31,170
draped itself over your knowledge of how to rack a gun.

1245
01:53:34,141 --> 01:53:38,310
Although all this sounds frighteningly
close to the cliches of our times...

1246
01:53:40,147 --> 01:53:41,980
And I'm predisposed

1247
01:53:41,982 --> 01:53:44,216
to knock holes in your arguments...

1248
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:48,754
<i>I'm too tired.</i>

1249
01:53:48,756 --> 01:53:50,823
Well, that's good.

1250
01:53:53,293 --> 01:53:55,394
Why don't you lay down?

1251
01:53:57,964 --> 01:54:00,132
Yes.

1252
01:54:11,110 --> 01:54:14,446
Let me just say that telling my story

1253
01:54:14,448 --> 01:54:16,882
as you insisted...

1254
01:54:16,884 --> 01:54:19,251
Or permitted...

1255
01:54:19,253 --> 01:54:21,954
<i>Has put me at ease.</i>

1256
01:54:23,823 --> 01:54:26,158
At this moment

1257
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:29,895
my addiction is very clear to me...

1258
01:54:32,198 --> 01:54:34,499
And I've come to a decision.

1259
01:54:36,536 --> 01:54:40,405
<i>Even though only one in a million,</i>

1260
01:54:40,407 --> 01:54:43,876
as my dubious therapist said,

1261
01:54:43,878 --> 01:54:45,878
succeed in...

1262
01:54:47,213 --> 01:54:50,382
Mentally, bodily...

1263
01:54:51,584 --> 01:54:54,219
And in her heart

1264
01:54:54,221 --> 01:54:58,323
of ridding herself of her sexuality,

1265
01:54:58,325 --> 01:55:01,126
this is now my goal.

1266
01:55:02,428 --> 01:55:05,130
<i>But is that a life worth living?</i>

1267
01:55:07,967 --> 01:55:10,602
<i>It's the only way I can live it.</i>

1268
01:55:14,841 --> 01:55:18,644
I will stand up against all odds...

1269
01:55:23,182 --> 01:55:26,685
Just like a deformed tree on a hill.

1270
01:55:34,494 --> 01:55:37,162
I will muster

1271
01:55:37,164 --> 01:55:39,531
all my stubbornness...

1272
01:55:42,602 --> 01:55:44,536
My strength...

1273
01:55:47,206 --> 01:55:49,574
My masculine aggression.

1274
01:55:52,011 --> 01:55:56,214
<i>But most of all I want to say thanks</i>

1275
01:55:56,216 --> 01:55:59,718
<i>to my new, and maybe first friend.</i>

1276
01:56:01,220 --> 01:56:03,355
Thank you, seligman...

1277
01:56:05,158 --> 01:56:09,328
Who perhaps is happy when all is said and done.

1278
01:56:15,435 --> 01:56:18,236
I'm happy at any rate

1279
01:56:18,238 --> 01:56:21,239
that the shot didn't go off

1280
01:56:21,241 --> 01:56:23,475
<i>and made me a murderer.</i>

1281
01:56:29,148 --> 01:56:32,584
If I may, I'd like to sleep now.

1282
01:56:36,422 --> 01:56:38,757
I'll make sure you won't be disturbed.

1283
01:56:49,535 --> 01:56:51,370
Good night, Joe.

1284
01:56:52,372 --> 01:56:54,639
Good night, seligman.

1285
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:22,661
No!

1286
01:58:25,732 --> 01:58:28,567
