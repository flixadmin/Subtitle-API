1
00:00:05,831 --> 00:00:07,964
Deon, what's happening to me?

2
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,880
The temporal mutations
I've been tracking?

3
00:00:10,923 --> 00:00:13,752
It turns out every one of them
leads to you.

4
00:00:13,796 --> 00:00:15,295
I know I've been treating
your time sickness

5
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:17,408
like it's a virus
that's giving you symptoms.

6
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:19,062
The gaps in time...

7
00:00:20,977 --> 00:00:23,414
And now I've been noticing
that things

8
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:25,634
are there one minute
and they're gone the next.

9
00:00:25,677 --> 00:00:27,201
There's something about you

10
00:00:27,244 --> 00:00:29,942
that's causing time
to fracture around you.

11
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:32,728
Iris, this isn't a virus
that you have.

12
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:34,338
Whatever this time sickness is...

13
00:00:34,382 --> 00:00:36,819
It's coming from me.

14
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:49,832
What is it?

15
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:52,574
What's wrong?

16
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,113
How do you feel right now?

17
00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:11,767
Well, I mean,
that's what's so weird.

18
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,117
I feel fine.

19
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:15,466
And this is all because

20
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,704
of what happened
in the other timeline?

21
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:18,121
Yeah.

22
00:01:18,165 --> 00:01:19,838
I should've never
reversed your treatments.

23
00:01:19,862 --> 00:01:21,429
No.
It's not your fault, Deon.

24
00:01:21,472 --> 00:01:22,778
I asked you to do it.

25
00:01:22,821 --> 00:01:24,127
And it was
the right thing to do.

26
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:26,173
There... there was no other way

27
00:01:26,216 --> 00:01:27,565
to prove Barry's innocence

28
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:29,219
and to save my dad's life.

29
00:01:29,263 --> 00:01:31,023
Yeah, but these anomalies
you're experiencing?

30
00:01:31,047 --> 00:01:33,397
I mean, who knows what's next?

31
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:34,703
Well, we have to find a cure.

32
00:01:34,746 --> 00:01:36,139
And we will.

33
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:39,142
Right now,
we gotta get you stabilized.

34
00:01:39,186 --> 00:01:42,580
I'm sorry,
but you gotta stay put.

35
00:01:42,624 --> 00:01:46,323
Well, I mean, there are
worse places to hang out.

36
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:48,282
How long do I have to stay?

37
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:50,240
Well, considering the universe

38
00:01:50,284 --> 00:01:52,286
is like a zillion
light years large,

39
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:54,157
I'd say staying put
is a relative thing

40
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:55,898
when it comes
to Earthly movements,

41
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:58,379
so I'm thinking that
if you confine your movements

42
00:01:58,422 --> 00:02:01,730
to Coast City for a while,
it should lessen the risk.

43
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:04,341
Or at least I hope so.

44
00:02:04,385 --> 00:02:05,734
Good, because there's still

45
00:02:05,777 --> 00:02:07,997
someone here that needs my help.

46
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,477
What if she has
another episode?

47
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,087
Well, I'm gonna have
to do something

48
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,177
a little more radical this time
to patch you up.

49
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:16,092
Look, I won't lie to you guys.

50
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,224
This is gonna hurt.

51
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:29,714
Ah!

52
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:32,674
You all right?

53
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:34,328
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

54
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:36,199
I'll be back as soon as I can.

55
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:39,159
Iris, if you have any blackouts
or anything weird happens,

56
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:40,247
you let me know ASAP.

57
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:52,563
Okay, I'm gonna go grab
a few of my things from home.

58
00:02:52,607 --> 00:02:54,261
I'll be back in a few seconds.

59
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:56,088
No, no, Barry, you can't.

60
00:02:56,132 --> 00:02:58,197
I mean, remember what you said
about that black fire.

61
00:02:58,221 --> 00:02:59,677
There are people that are
still in danger.

62
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:01,181
You have to stop it.

63
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:02,723
But I can't just
leave you here alone.

64
00:03:02,747 --> 00:03:04,247
I'm not.
I mean, Sue will be back soon.

65
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:08,710
And besides, I mean,
I have work to do too.

66
00:03:08,753 --> 00:03:10,364
Your whole world
is falling apart

67
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:13,410
and you're still worried
about helping other people.

68
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:16,848
Okay, just call me
if you need anything.

69
00:03:16,892 --> 00:03:18,633
I will.

70
00:03:18,676 --> 00:03:20,069
Okay.

71
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,128
I'm dropping my frame
to the floor

72
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:38,740
Banging this beat on my stereo

73
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:40,785
So come and ride with me

74
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:43,266
Ride with me, yeah

75
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,964
I ain't got nowhere to go

76
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:47,618
Pah!

77
00:03:47,662 --> 00:03:49,011
I'm gonna get back for sure

78
00:03:49,054 --> 00:03:52,319
Now that is what you call art.

79
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:56,410
Dropping my frame to the floor

80
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:59,021
Banging this beat on my stereo

81
00:03:59,064 --> 00:04:00,588
Come on and ride with me

82
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:02,459
Since when do I sweat?

83
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:04,331
Come on and ride

84
00:04:04,374 --> 00:04:06,681
I ain't got nowhere to go

85
00:04:06,724 --> 00:04:08,639
I'm gonna get back for sure

86
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:23,263
What the hell?

87
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:31,575
- Is Iris okay?
- Yeah.

88
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:34,665
I mean, you know,
as well as she can be.

89
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:37,320
Well, Barry,
are you sure you don't wanna...

90
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:39,670
I mean, Team Flash
can hold down the fort

91
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:40,932
if you need to be with her.

92
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:42,673
No, thanks.
Iris is right.

93
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:44,371
I mean, as long as she's stable,

94
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:48,418
keeping everyone safe in
Central City is the priority.

95
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:50,159
Joe, Cecile,
have you guys found anything?

96
00:04:50,202 --> 00:04:51,856
Uh, well,

97
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,598
besides all suffering
recent personal losses, no.

98
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:57,166
None of our fire victims
had anything in common.

99
00:04:57,209 --> 00:04:59,821
Yeah, Bar, I triple checked
the victims' files.

100
00:04:59,864 --> 00:05:01,866
Stan Mullen, Donna Winters,

101
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,043
that yoga instructor,
Parker DeStefano.

102
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:07,524
At first, we thought
all these freaky flames

103
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:09,285
were feeding on people who
recently mourned,

104
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,267
like Mullens...
But then it attacked me.

105
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,095
And my dad died
when I was a kid.

106
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:15,010
Which doesn't
follow the pattern.

107
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:17,118
Maybe it's looking for people
who don't face their grief.

108
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:18,492
No, I don't think so.

109
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:20,232
DeStefano had completed
grief counseling

110
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:21,712
after her fiancé died,

111
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:23,888
and she was already
seeing somebody new.

112
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:25,934
Well, I've assigned
Vanya and Aariz

113
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:27,805
to dig into the backgrounds
of our victims

114
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:29,894
for secondary similarities, so.

115
00:05:29,938 --> 00:05:31,243
You sound just like Iris.

116
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:33,420
No wonder she put you in charge.

117
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:35,378
Speaking of similarities,

118
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:39,208
Kramer pulled files for every
suspicious fire-related crime

119
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:41,297
since the particle
accelerator exploded,

120
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,995
so me and Cecile have
to go through all of it.

121
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:47,477
And there's a ton.
So you ready, babe?

122
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:49,261
Mm. Later.

123
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,924
What's an SR37 Alert?

124
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:01,752
Someone just entered
the Med Lab.

125
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:03,232
Well, is Caitlin back

126
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:04,644
from her wine country tour
with Marcus?

127
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:07,062
No, not yet.
Stay here.

128
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:16,419
Hey.

129
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:18,378
Any idea where
Caity keeps the bandages?

130
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:20,399
It seems more like a top shelf
kind of thing, if you ask me.

131
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:22,120
What... what happened
to your arm?

132
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:25,515
Oh, a freaking fire
attacked me at the apartment.

133
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:27,256
And before you ask,

134
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:31,042
no, I don't know why
it didn't kill me.

135
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:32,696
- Were you...
- Grieving? Nope.

136
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,003
I was perfectly happy
working on a new piece.

137
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:37,440
Could be the best thing
I've ever done.

138
00:06:37,484 --> 00:06:38,963
But that does not explain

139
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:41,749
why our sentient Smokey Joe
would attack me.

140
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,794
And only leave me with this.

141
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:44,795
Ow.

142
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:45,796
Frost, come here.

143
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,928
Let me help.

144
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:48,495
Ah.

145
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:51,149
You make a good
Caity substitute.

146
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:53,195
Maybe it's like Joe says.

147
00:06:53,238 --> 00:06:55,327
There's gotta be something more.

148
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:57,242
It's after something
we're missing.

149
00:06:57,286 --> 00:06:59,506
Something I have?

150
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:00,898
I don't know.

151
00:07:00,942 --> 00:07:04,946
But, I mean,
this fire attacked you

152
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:06,600
and me here at S.T.A.R. Labs

153
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:10,473
and then follows you home
less than 24 hours later?

154
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:13,607
That... you know,
it can't be a coincidence.

155
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:17,349
So if we can figure out

156
00:07:17,393 --> 00:07:18,892
why the flames
think I'd be a tasty snack...

157
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,702
Maybe that could tell us
how to stop it.

158
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:23,530
Frost, if it's okay,

159
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:25,706
I'd like to search
your apartment top to bottom,

160
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:28,448
see if there's any clues as to
why the fire's targeting you.

161
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:30,667
- Go for it.
- Okay.

162
00:07:41,286 --> 00:07:43,550
Frost, it's been a while
since we've caught up.

163
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:44,942
What's wrong?

164
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:46,346
It's about
Team Flash's new case.

165
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:48,032
This one's a little creepy.

166
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:51,296
Over the last few weeks,
three bodies have turned up,

167
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,473
all of them burnt to a crisp.

168
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:54,952
So this is an arson case?

169
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:57,477
Mm, more like a ghost story.

170
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,523
The fires that did the damage
were black,

171
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:03,874
and so cold that they burned
the victims like frostbite,

172
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:05,615
only a thousand times
more lethal.

173
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:07,269
And you need my help

174
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:08,725
to figure out
what's causing this phenomenon?

175
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:10,490
Not exactly.

176
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:13,928
The flames are alive,
and they're attacking people.

177
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:15,538
And I think
they're coming after me.

178
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:18,193
My God.
Of course.

179
00:08:18,236 --> 00:08:20,674
I'll do whatever I can
to help keep you safe.

180
00:08:20,717 --> 00:08:25,069
Actually, I need you
to do just the opposite.

181
00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:29,247
I want you to help me catch
this thing using me as bait.

182
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:41,477
You wanna use yourself as bait

183
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,870
to capture the black fire?

184
00:08:42,913 --> 00:08:45,568
I know how it sounds,
but hear us out.

185
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:48,484
If this homicidal stuff
is after me now,

186
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,225
why not use it to our advantage?

187
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:52,575
But Carla, you can't actually
be considering this?

188
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:54,185
I wasn't at first.

189
00:08:54,229 --> 00:08:55,859
And then Frost laid out
the facts in the case.

190
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:57,798
How it's killing
innocent people,

191
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:59,539
and now it's
coming after her too,

192
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:02,672
with flames that generate
a cold so intense, it burns?

193
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:04,718
That last item is almost
an exact description

194
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:06,284
of how cold fusion works.

195
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:08,939
But why is the fire
attracted to Frost?

196
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:11,202
I believe it's because
her meta-abilities

197
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:14,597
are cryo-kinetic,
just like our cold fusion fire.

198
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:18,296
So you think it's hunting her
for fuel to recharge itself?

199
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,297
Correct.

200
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:21,212
So the key to catching it

201
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:23,495
is to wait until it comes after
her again and then trap it.

202
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,390
Frost, we're not
using you as bait.

203
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,978
Look, this is
a perfectly good plan

204
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:29,351
that could save lives.

205
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:30,831
Why won't you at least
let us try?

206
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:32,963
Because this feels
like a last resort.

207
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:34,985
Besides, there's still so much
we don't know about this fire.

208
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:36,967
I mean, even if we tried this,

209
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:38,490
we still
have no way to capture it.

210
00:09:38,534 --> 00:09:40,449
Cold fusion is still
a fusion reaction,

211
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:43,191
one that occurs
at a low molecular temperature.

212
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:46,542
If we could build some kind of
fusion containment housing...

213
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,589
Then all we'd need to do
is recalibrate the unit

214
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:52,156
to absorb and amplify
Frost's cryo-kinetic signature.

215
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,898
Yes. Then as long as Frost
is in proximity,

216
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:57,684
the unit can amplify
her cryo-kinetic signature

217
00:09:57,727 --> 00:09:59,076
and attract the fire,

218
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,080
allowing us to capture
and imprison it.

219
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:04,647
Of course,
building a unit like that

220
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:07,084
could take weeks or longer,
but...

221
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:11,654
Well, not that I'm saying
we should do this at all,

222
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:15,832
but we kind of already have
what you're describing.

223
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:17,268
We do?

224
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:19,662
The Fusion Sphere
from the A.S.F.

225
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:21,316
It can already handle
the entire output

226
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:23,144
of the Artificial Speed Force.

227
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:25,929
If Dr. Tannhauser and I
recalibrate it

228
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:29,672
for a cryo-kinetic signature,
we'd be in business.

229
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:31,239
Great.
Then it's settled.

230
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:33,067
Chester, you and Mom
work on the nerd stuff.

231
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,503
Allegra, you and I will...

232
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:37,506
Wait around
for you to get killed?

233
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:38,942
Barry, whatever this thing is,

234
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:40,770
it's coming after me
no matter what,

235
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:42,554
so I'm not gonna sit around

236
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:47,559
and do nothing when
we have a plan to fight back.

237
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:50,475
Barry, it's your call.

238
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,130
Ditto that.

239
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:56,656
I'm sorry,
but I can't support this.

240
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:59,789
I know we don't have
another plan right now,

241
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,923
but putting you in harm's way?

242
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:04,446
Look, there's gotta be
another option.

243
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,410
I still think this could work.

244
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:14,804
Get started.
I'll be back.

245
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:21,593
Look, I'm not gonna
change my mind.

246
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:23,508
Okay, fine.
But just hear me out.

247
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:25,206
Before this,

248
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:26,879
you were telling us
about Iris and her condition.

249
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:28,011
How she wants to help Tinya,

250
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:31,603
but Deon told her to stay put.

251
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:34,650
Do you really think that's
what she's doing right now?

252
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,173
'Cause if I know Iris...

253
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:38,698
She's gonna try
and help Tinya find her mom.

254
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:40,177
Instead of sitting in a hotel,

255
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:42,527
doing nothing
and helping no one.

256
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:44,573
But she's not
endangering herself, either.

257
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:47,707
But she is doing what
this whole team does best:

258
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,406
helping people, despite what
it could mean for themselves.

259
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:57,412
Sound familiar?

260
00:11:57,455 --> 00:12:00,850
Look, my mom is the world's
top specialist in cold fusion

261
00:12:00,894 --> 00:12:02,199
and she thinks this will work.

262
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:03,984
Chester agrees.

263
00:12:04,027 --> 00:12:06,508
So why won't you give me
the chance to make a difference

264
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:07,988
that you're giving Iris?

265
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:13,296
Okay.

266
00:12:14,995 --> 00:12:16,779
But if anything goes wrong...

267
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:19,173
You'll pull the plug.
Got it.

268
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:22,698
Yes!

269
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:27,529
I've finished
fine-tuning the sphere

270
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:29,836
to amplify Frost's
cryo-kinetic signature.

271
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,795
Now, make sure to calibrate
the containment housing...

272
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:34,405
To compensate
for the possibility

273
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:36,799
of a reconfiguration flip
at the subatomic level.

274
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:38,627
Already done.

275
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,281
Really?

276
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:41,978
Well, when this is over,

277
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:44,459
there's a job waiting for you
at Tannhauser Labs.

278
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:46,766
Spoiler: I pay better.

279
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:49,812
For real?

280
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:53,163
I mean... I mean, nah.

281
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:55,818
No, I actually kinda
like it here.

282
00:12:55,862 --> 00:12:57,341
Suit yourself.

283
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,518
We're ready. Frost?

284
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:09,701
Okay, what next?

285
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:13,183
Chester, activate
the Cold Fusion Sphere.

286
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:19,320
Now remember,
the sphere will amplify

287
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:22,453
your cryo-kinetic signature,
drawing the fire near.

288
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:24,064
But you need
to stay in the gurney

289
00:13:24,107 --> 00:13:26,022
until the fire
is pulled into that sphere

290
00:13:26,066 --> 00:13:28,677
and we've trapped it.

291
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,854
Okay,
so now we just wait around

292
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:34,857
for some sentient fire
to come get its dinner?

293
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:37,686
That could take forever.
Not if Carla's right.

294
00:13:37,729 --> 00:13:39,079
The sphere will amplify

295
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:41,211
Frost's cryo-signature
exponentially,

296
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:43,866
like an animal's scent getting
broadcast to a larger area

297
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,216
to entice a predator
and draw them in.

298
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,176
Making Frost
honey on a flytrap.

299
00:13:49,219 --> 00:13:50,960
Once it senses her, it'll pounce

300
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:53,006
and then we got it.

301
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:56,879
If this spooky thing is looking
for fuel instead of just grief,

302
00:13:56,923 --> 00:13:59,012
this is the place to find it.

303
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:01,492
Frost...

304
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:03,146
About what you're doing,

305
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,583
I don't know if I'd have
the strength to do the same.

306
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:07,194
I mean, I'm...

307
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:09,152
I'm just saying
you're very brave.

308
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:11,111
Thanks.

309
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:13,330
Although right now,

310
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:15,395
kinda feel like the stupid
person in the horror movie

311
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:19,641
who runs into the house instead
of running away from it.

312
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:23,993
Uh, folks, our intelligent
ignition source

313
00:14:24,037 --> 00:14:27,170
just popped back up on the grid
and it's heading here, fast.

314
00:14:29,346 --> 00:14:31,131
Somebody turned up the heat.

315
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:32,306
It's here.

316
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:41,315
It's working.

317
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:55,851
Why'd it stop?

318
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,983
Something's not right.

319
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:02,292
What are you waiting for?
Come and get me!

320
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:05,382
It knows what we're planning.

321
00:15:11,736 --> 00:15:13,434
Frost!

322
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:31,582
Thank goodness
you're all right.

323
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:36,892
We're lucky your boss
is a superhero.

324
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,547
- Is she gonna be okay?
- I'm fine.

325
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,828
I thought you were on vacation.

326
00:15:40,852 --> 00:15:42,811
I was, and then Allegra called

327
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:44,726
and said you were
using yourself as bait

328
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:47,511
to summon an uncontrollable
fire to S.T.A.R. Labs?

329
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:49,296
What the hell were you thinking?

330
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:52,821
That we could end this
and save folks' lives?

331
00:15:52,864 --> 00:15:54,866
Also, your bedside manner
is terrible.

332
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,710
Frost, she's right.
We're worried about you.

333
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:58,609
Barry says
you antagonized the flames.

334
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:00,089
Was that part of your plan too?

335
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:01,482
I mean, it didn't
take the bait.

336
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:02,633
What else was I supposed to do?

337
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:04,050
Okay, what happened out there

338
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:05,834
after the Babadook Blaze
went postal?

339
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:07,444
Once we got you back
to the Med Lab,

340
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:09,229
I did a grid search
of the entire city.

341
00:16:09,272 --> 00:16:10,970
There's no sign of it.

342
00:16:12,884 --> 00:16:13,949
We need to get back out there.

343
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,080
What we need to do is find

344
00:16:15,104 --> 00:16:16,671
another way to stop this thing.

345
00:16:16,714 --> 00:16:18,474
Frost, we know how dangerous
this thing is.

346
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:21,023
I mean, it's killed three
people already that we know of.

347
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:24,331
It came after me. Again.
We can do this.

348
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:26,091
I hear the Cold Fusion Sphere
didn't even work.

349
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:27,638
More precisely,

350
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:29,814
we never had a chance
to see if it would work.

351
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:32,774
The fire hesitated,
so it didn't get close enough.

352
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:34,341
If only there was a way

353
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:37,039
to make Frost more attractive
to the flames.

354
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,712
Sounds like something
Chester can help us with.

355
00:16:38,736 --> 00:16:40,105
I'll have him meet us
in the Speed lab.

356
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:41,783
Sit down.

357
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:47,093
Can I have the room, please?

358
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:48,920
You, stay.

359
00:16:56,537 --> 00:16:57,712
I don't understand.

360
00:16:57,755 --> 00:16:59,366
You said over the phone

361
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:00,647
that you could give me
the information in person.

362
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,412
I'm sorry, Mrs. West-Allen.

363
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:06,112
- You said you'd fix this.
- And I will.

364
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:08,244
Look, I've worked stories
like this before

365
00:17:08,288 --> 00:17:09,439
and I've never had a problem.

366
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:10,768
I know, but after your call,

367
00:17:10,812 --> 00:17:12,640
I checked the files in question.

368
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:15,947
Turns out there's
a no-contact rule in play.

369
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:18,472
Wait, you mean
someone doesn't want me

370
00:17:18,515 --> 00:17:20,996
to find my own birth mother?

371
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,738
Uh, who?
I wanna know right now!

372
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:26,262
Okay.
Tinya, hi.

373
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:27,674
Why don't you just
give us a few minutes

374
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:30,179
so that we can work things out?

375
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:31,920
All right, she's my mom.
All right?

376
00:17:31,963 --> 00:17:33,574
I have a right
to know the truth!

377
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:36,968
Okay.

378
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,409
Look, is there
anyone we could talk to

379
00:17:42,452 --> 00:17:44,454
about overriding
a no-contact order?

380
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:46,152
No one.

381
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:47,912
I mean, I'd need approval
from our Board of Directors

382
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:50,025
for something like that.

383
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,463
Oh, is that all?
I got this.

384
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:57,902
Hi, Uncle Leroy.

385
00:17:57,946 --> 00:17:59,426
Yes, it's Sue.

386
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:00,992
Yeah, I'm in town for the day.

387
00:18:01,036 --> 00:18:04,126
Oh, yeah,
I am so glad that you asked.

388
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,520
I just need a little favor

389
00:18:06,563 --> 00:18:09,479
from the R.A.A.
chairman of the board.

390
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:12,830
Yes, it's a no-contact order.
It's really important.

391
00:18:12,874 --> 00:18:14,658
I'm trying to help an orphan.

392
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:18,401
I know, just like you.

393
00:18:18,445 --> 00:18:19,576
It's for you.

394
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:25,452
Yes, sir?

395
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:27,497
Of course.

396
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,586
No problem.

397
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:30,935
Thank you.

398
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:35,375
Yeah? Okay.

399
00:18:35,418 --> 00:18:37,159
Just a sec.

400
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:45,689
Sorry about that.

401
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:47,169
Oh, no. No. No problem.

402
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:48,431
You were just doing your job.

403
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:49,780
Thanks.

404
00:18:49,824 --> 00:18:50,825
Thank you.

405
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,787
I need a break.

406
00:19:20,898 --> 00:19:23,640
Okay, ready for the next step?

407
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:29,516
How about
I go pull up the car?

408
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:37,828
What's wrong?

409
00:19:37,872 --> 00:19:39,308
I thought this
is what you wanted.

410
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:46,359
Um, what if my mom
doesn't want to meet me?

411
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:50,450
She will.

412
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:54,193
Iris, she gave up on me
the moment I was born.

413
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:55,846
So what if nothing's changed?

414
00:19:58,153 --> 00:20:01,330
Tinya, look,
when I was your age,

415
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:03,506
my mom wasn't in my life either,

416
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,900
and there was
so much trauma around it.

417
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:07,423
All the lies I had been told,

418
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:12,559
the feelings of abandonment,
how much it hurt.

419
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:15,344
And it got so bad that
when I finally had the chance

420
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:18,956
to reconcile with my mom,
I almost lost the opportunity.

421
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:22,830
And then someone made me realize

422
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:26,442
that reconnecting with my mom,
no matter how or why,

423
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:28,052
was a gift.

424
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:31,534
And let me tell you,

425
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:36,626
I am really glad
that I listened to them,

426
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:40,500
because I barely got to heal
my relationship with my mother

427
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:41,675
before she passed.

428
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:47,376
Oh. Um...

429
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,877
Hey, I'm really sorry.
I didn't know that...

430
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:52,425
No, no, it's okay.

431
00:20:52,468 --> 00:20:55,297
I'm just saying that
I almost made a mistake

432
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:58,039
that I would have regretted
for the rest of my life.

433
00:20:58,082 --> 00:21:00,302
How did you do it? I mean,
where did you even start?

434
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:03,610
I told her I was scared.
I told her I was angry.

435
00:21:03,653 --> 00:21:06,874
And also, that I...

436
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:08,745
loved her
even though I didn't know why.

437
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,534
And Tinya, whatever you do,
everything is gonna be okay,

438
00:21:14,577 --> 00:21:18,015
'cause you're not
gonna do it alone.

439
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:19,495
I won't let you.

440
00:21:25,371 --> 00:21:26,371
Come on.

441
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:32,116
Frost, why do you
keep doing this?

442
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,814
You need to stop

443
00:21:33,857 --> 00:21:35,357
putting your personal safety
in danger for nothing.

444
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:37,557
Like when you stabbed yourself
just to get

445
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,254
Chillblaine arrested
that first time.

446
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,908
That turned out okay.
This will too.

447
00:21:40,951 --> 00:21:42,431
You don't know that.
Damn it, Frost.

448
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:44,148
It's like you don't
even care about yourself.

449
00:21:44,172 --> 00:21:46,566
I'm trying to help people.

450
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:48,481
Right, okay,
but at some point,

451
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:51,484
you need to realize that you
could also get yourself killed.

452
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:52,833
And then you need to think,

453
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:54,574
"Hmm, maybe I shouldn't do this.

454
00:21:54,617 --> 00:21:56,552
Or, "Hmm, maybe I should
come up with a different plan",

455
00:21:56,576 --> 00:21:59,405
one that doesn't
get me killed."

456
00:21:59,448 --> 00:22:01,668
And you.
Mom, seriously.

457
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:03,147
How could you
go along with this?

458
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:04,801
Frost's powers
presented an opportunity

459
00:22:04,845 --> 00:22:06,542
to take this thing
off the streets,

460
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:08,457
and that's where our focus
has been ever since.

461
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:11,112
You put her life at risk.
You realize that, right?

462
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:12,374
Because she asked me to.

463
00:22:12,418 --> 00:22:14,550
- And that makes it okay?
- Hey!

464
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:17,466
Hey, we made a decision today
to try to protect people.

465
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,903
I would think that you
would be fine with that.

466
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:21,470
What I am not fine with

467
00:22:21,514 --> 00:22:22,906
is losing Frost forever,

468
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,908
which is what could have
happened today.

469
00:22:24,952 --> 00:22:27,607
You used your child
as bait for a monster.

470
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,435
Well, that's not how I see it.

471
00:22:29,478 --> 00:22:30,914
No, you don't, because you're

472
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,655
looking at Frost
as a science experiment

473
00:22:32,699 --> 00:22:33,830
instead of as your daughter.

474
00:22:36,703 --> 00:22:39,401
Frost, please listen to me.

475
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:41,534
You need to learn
to value your own life.

476
00:22:51,326 --> 00:22:55,417
Carla, you still think
that fusion globe will work?

477
00:22:55,461 --> 00:22:57,158
Yes, if we can find a way

478
00:22:57,201 --> 00:22:59,290
to make sure
it gets closer next time.

479
00:22:59,334 --> 00:23:01,094
Great. I'll have Chester
start working on it.

480
00:23:01,118 --> 00:23:02,903
Frost, wait. I...

481
00:23:04,905 --> 00:23:05,993
Our plan will work.

482
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:10,998
You better hope it does.

483
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:12,826
Because right now,
you have two daughters.

484
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:14,523
But if something
happens to Frost

485
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:16,830
because of something
you helped her with,

486
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:17,961
you'll have none.

487
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:40,288
Bar, I ran into
Carla Tannhauser.

488
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:42,856
She told me about her plan
to stop these devil flames.

489
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:44,118
Mm-hmm.

490
00:23:44,161 --> 00:23:47,687
And your objection.

491
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,645
Yeah.

492
00:23:49,689 --> 00:23:51,255
You wanna tell me your side?

493
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,016
Because I'm pretty sure
I'm not the only one

494
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,452
that wants to get these
damn things off the street.

495
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:55,714
Look, I know
why she's doing this,

496
00:23:55,738 --> 00:23:57,348
and she's not wrong.

497
00:23:57,392 --> 00:23:59,022
If there's something out there
hurting people,

498
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:00,502
then we need to do everything
we can to stop it.

499
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:02,528
Right.
So what's the problem?

500
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:06,009
She's found a way
to use Frost's powers

501
00:24:06,053 --> 00:24:07,489
to lure the black fire here

502
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:09,230
by boosting Frost's powers
to trap it.

503
00:24:09,273 --> 00:24:12,363
And that's a bad plan
because...

504
00:24:12,407 --> 00:24:14,148
It's too dangerous.

505
00:24:14,191 --> 00:24:15,889
I mean, Frost has already
been hurt once.

506
00:24:15,932 --> 00:24:18,132
If we try this again, something
even worse could happen.

507
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:25,246
That's not all
you're concerned about, is it?

508
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:26,963
I mean, my gut told me
this was a bad idea.

509
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:28,094
I should have listened to it.

510
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:30,469
And now you're worried about

511
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:31,948
not being able to stop it

512
00:24:31,992 --> 00:24:33,535
because these things
were set in motion?

513
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:35,691
I'm... I'm team leader.

514
00:24:35,735 --> 00:24:38,564
Having a plan that keeps
everybody safe is my job.

515
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:41,697
Only today, I don't know how.

516
00:24:41,741 --> 00:24:43,220
And now our only solution

517
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,309
is putting a team member's
life in jeopardy.

518
00:24:45,353 --> 00:24:47,790
Mm.

519
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:50,489
Are you talking about Frost
or Iris?

520
00:24:53,796 --> 00:24:55,885
Mm-hmm.

521
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:58,932
I'm worried about her too.

522
00:24:58,975 --> 00:25:01,804
But you were the one who also
left your wife in Coast City

523
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:04,938
asking the same question
you're asking about Frost.

524
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:10,247
Is it safe for her to continue
her mission or pull the plug?

525
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:12,206
Look, I'm not the boss here,

526
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:16,471
so I can't make the decision
for you.

527
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,473
But I can tell you this.

528
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:22,521
Sometimes, the hardest part
about being a leader

529
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:24,087
is letting go

530
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:26,568
and trusting
the ones you've trained

531
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:29,615
to make the call themselves.

532
00:25:29,658 --> 00:25:33,357
And then you be there for them
in a blink of an eye.

533
00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:44,194
Took you long enough.
Jeez.

534
00:25:44,238 --> 00:25:47,371
Where's Chester?
We got a lot of work to do.

535
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:50,723
He's not coming.

536
00:25:50,766 --> 00:25:52,159
Frost, I talked to Caitlin.

537
00:25:52,202 --> 00:25:54,422
Oh, let me guess.

538
00:25:54,465 --> 00:25:57,251
She changed your mind.
So what?

539
00:25:57,294 --> 00:25:59,645
Now you're here to give me
some sort of mom talk?

540
00:25:59,688 --> 00:26:02,996
Seriously?
Yes, I am.

541
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,867
Because I am your mom,

542
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:08,523
and it's time
I start acting like it.

543
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,351
Frost, I think it's wonderful

544
00:26:10,394 --> 00:26:13,310
that you have such a strong
instinct to protect people.

545
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:15,748
But from what Caitlin shared
and what I saw

546
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:20,013
with my own eyes today, I...
I think your sister's right.

547
00:26:20,056 --> 00:26:21,884
You need to stop
being so reckless.

548
00:26:21,928 --> 00:26:23,843
You don't get it.
This is Team Flash.

549
00:26:23,886 --> 00:26:26,410
Protecting people?
Kinda in the job description.

550
00:26:26,454 --> 00:26:30,023
No, youdon't get it.

551
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:34,070
You can't help anyone
if you're dead.

552
00:26:34,114 --> 00:26:37,552
I swear sometimes
you remind me of your father.

553
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,294
Oh, a murderous psychopath?
Gee, thanks.

554
00:26:40,337 --> 00:26:43,950
No, not Icicle.
Thomas.

555
00:26:43,993 --> 00:26:46,082
Your father would do
whatever it took

556
00:26:46,126 --> 00:26:47,693
to protect his family too,

557
00:26:47,736 --> 00:26:51,087
including creating you
to save Caitlin.

558
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:53,394
But he took it too far,
and it cost him a future

559
00:26:53,437 --> 00:26:54,937
with the people
who loved him the most,

560
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:56,832
and I don't wanna see you
go down that road.

561
00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:58,617
Neither do I.

562
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,271
Look, you people think
I have some sort of death wish

563
00:27:01,315 --> 00:27:04,057
or something, but it's not that.

564
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,669
I was literally born
to be Caity's bodyguard.

565
00:27:07,713 --> 00:27:09,497
Asking me not to jump
in the line of fire,

566
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,542
it's like asking the sky
not to be freaking blue.

567
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:17,548
Frost,
you're more than a bodyguard.

568
00:27:17,592 --> 00:27:18,985
You're an incredible young woman

569
00:27:19,028 --> 00:27:22,989
and a vital part of Team Flash.

570
00:27:23,032 --> 00:27:26,514
And of the Snow family too.

571
00:27:26,557 --> 00:27:28,255
Because you're my daughter.

572
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,087
And as your mother,
it's my job to protect you,

573
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,523
which is why I'm telling you

574
00:27:35,566 --> 00:27:37,568
there's a time
for protecting others

575
00:27:37,612 --> 00:27:40,006
and there's a time
for protecting yourself.

576
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:43,009
And now is the time
to do the latter.

577
00:27:44,924 --> 00:27:48,797
I... I should have seen it before
and I hope you do now.

578
00:27:51,452 --> 00:27:53,367
Yeah, I do.

579
00:27:57,284 --> 00:28:01,854
But what about
the Phantom Flicker?

580
00:28:01,897 --> 00:28:03,769
I still think your plan
would work.

581
00:28:03,812 --> 00:28:05,596
We just need to keep you safe,

582
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,557
so the way to do that
is to trap the fire quickly.

583
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,386
I think if we add a secondary
cryo-kinetic signature,

584
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:15,476
it would make the meal
more appetizing.

585
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:17,739
- Like frosting on a cake?
- Mm.

586
00:28:17,783 --> 00:28:21,221
But I'm unique.
No one has cryo powers like me.

587
00:28:23,223 --> 00:28:25,791
I do.

588
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:28,968
After your fa... after Icicle

589
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:30,404
put me in his cryo-chamber,

590
00:28:30,447 --> 00:28:32,101
Caitlin and I did a test

591
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:35,409
for any residual meta-genome
signatures in my body.

592
00:28:35,452 --> 00:28:38,064
Yeah, I remember.
It came back negative.

593
00:28:38,107 --> 00:28:40,196
Mm. It was wrong.

594
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,155
According to my research,

595
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:45,375
my exposure in Icicle's chamber
activated a latent cryo-gene.

596
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:48,422
I don't have ice powers yet,

597
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:49,785
but I have
the potential for them.

598
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:52,643
Frost, if we combine

599
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:54,143
your cryo-kinetic signature
with mine...

600
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:56,125
It would be impossible
for it to resist us.

601
00:28:56,169 --> 00:28:57,518
Yes, and there'll be less risk

602
00:28:57,561 --> 00:28:58,867
because the fire won't hesitate

603
00:28:58,911 --> 00:29:01,217
and we'll be able
to trap it quickly.

604
00:29:03,306 --> 00:29:05,700
What do you say?

605
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,702
I'm in.

606
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,487
There's just one more person
we need to get on board.

607
00:29:10,531 --> 00:29:13,012
Not anymore.

608
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:16,667
I'm still not thrilled with
how dangerous this plan is,

609
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:18,626
but Mom's right.

610
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:21,107
If the two of you work together,

611
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:24,458
the fire won't hesitate,
and then we can trap it.

612
00:29:24,501 --> 00:29:26,199
And that will keep
everyone safe.

613
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:31,813
Guys, the black fire's back.

614
00:29:31,857 --> 00:29:33,554
It just landed downtown.

615
00:29:33,597 --> 00:29:35,227
Yeah, so whatever you guys
are gonna do,

616
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:37,036
it's now or never.

617
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,994
Okay.

618
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:42,084
Let's take this thing out
once and for all.

619
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:50,963
How long have you known?

620
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,052
That I have my own
cryo-kinetic signature?

621
00:29:53,095 --> 00:29:54,314
For a while now.

622
00:29:54,357 --> 00:29:55,706
Turns out it runs in the family.

623
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,230
Can't believe
you didn't tell us

624
00:29:57,273 --> 00:29:58,860
there's two ice queens
in the Snow family.

625
00:29:58,884 --> 00:30:00,537
And if you ever need
to learn more about

626
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:02,080
how to control your powers,
we're here for you.

627
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:04,846
Thanks.
It means a lot.

628
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,630
Now, let's get to work.
Yes.

629
00:30:08,415 --> 00:30:09,546
Okay, we're ready.

630
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,983
And Mom, just so you know,

631
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:12,941
the tests I ran
confirm your findings.

632
00:30:12,985 --> 00:30:15,901
Your latent genome plus Frost's
meta-signature should amplify

633
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:18,381
the sphere's cryo-kinetic
output exponentially.

634
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:21,297
Giving our bonfire from hell
an offer it can't refuse.

635
00:30:21,341 --> 00:30:22,908
And then some.

636
00:30:22,951 --> 00:30:24,605
Listen, Barry,

637
00:30:24,648 --> 00:30:26,568
I know you've never been
on board with this plan.

638
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:28,304
So if anything goes wrong...

639
00:30:28,348 --> 00:30:30,567
I know, you'll pull the plug.

640
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:34,397
I trust you. All of you.
Don't worry.

641
00:30:34,441 --> 00:30:36,269
If it comes to that,

642
00:30:36,312 --> 00:30:38,593
I'll still be ready to get us
all out of here in a second.

643
00:30:41,491 --> 00:30:43,319
Do you do this kind of thing
all the time?

644
00:30:43,363 --> 00:30:45,452
- Do what?
- Be a hero.

645
00:30:45,495 --> 00:30:47,280
What can I say?
It's a living.

646
00:30:47,323 --> 00:30:51,501
Yeah, they just don't
tell you how intense it can be.

647
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:53,155
You're gonna do great.

648
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:55,897
And remember, what you're doing
will save lives.

649
00:30:55,941 --> 00:30:57,551
I know.

650
00:30:57,594 --> 00:30:59,161
And after this,
we can get dinner.

651
00:30:59,205 --> 00:31:01,990
Okay,
but only if you let me buy.

652
00:31:02,034 --> 00:31:03,687
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

653
00:31:07,126 --> 00:31:10,129
Okay, your vitals look good.

654
00:31:11,304 --> 00:31:12,435
Activating the sphere.

655
00:31:17,614 --> 00:31:19,573
Okay, focus on your powers.

656
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:23,229
Like this.

657
00:31:28,843 --> 00:31:32,934
Oh, I feel strange.

658
00:31:32,978 --> 00:31:34,216
That means
you're doing it right.

659
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,240
Okay.

660
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,376
Caitlin, how are they doing?

661
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,378
Their bio signatures
are in sync.

662
00:31:42,422 --> 00:31:44,685
Okay, well the containment
system's active.

663
00:31:44,728 --> 00:31:46,382
Chester?

664
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:49,298
Oh, great Otis Boykin.

665
00:31:49,342 --> 00:31:50,430
It just changed direction.

666
00:31:50,473 --> 00:31:52,388
And heading straight for us.

667
00:31:52,432 --> 00:31:54,738
Contact in five,

668
00:31:54,782 --> 00:31:56,175
four,

669
00:31:56,218 --> 00:31:57,524
three,

670
00:31:57,567 --> 00:31:58,786
two,

671
00:31:58,829 --> 00:31:59,961
one.

672
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,768
It's working.

673
00:32:55,712 --> 00:32:57,976
The sphere's
losing its integrity.

674
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:00,326
It's trying to break free.
We have to abort!

675
00:33:00,369 --> 00:33:03,416
No, no, I can do this.

676
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:07,072
Barry, we can't do this.

677
00:33:07,115 --> 00:33:08,595
She's going into cardiac arrest.

678
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:10,292
Carla, we have to let it go!

679
00:33:10,336 --> 00:33:13,078
No, it's worth it
to sacrifice me.

680
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:41,367
- What happened?
- It's gone again.

681
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:44,413
And we still have no idea why.

682
00:33:50,332 --> 00:33:53,335
- Did we get it?
- No.

683
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:54,467
And that's okay.

684
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:16,750
So you just let
that hellfire go?

685
00:34:16,793 --> 00:34:18,665
It's on me.
I made the call.

686
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:20,145
And it was
the right thing to do.

687
00:34:20,188 --> 00:34:22,016
You put Carla
and your own safety first.

688
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,279
- And you saved Mom's life.
- But Joe's right.

689
00:34:24,323 --> 00:34:26,412
We had a chance to stop it,
and we didn't.

690
00:34:26,455 --> 00:34:28,849
No, that was before
I knew you made

691
00:34:28,892 --> 00:34:30,894
a judgment call, Frost,
and a good one.

692
00:34:30,938 --> 00:34:31,982
Look, don't worry.

693
00:34:32,026 --> 00:34:33,375
We will stop that thing.

694
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:35,943
That's what we do.
Yeah.

695
00:34:35,986 --> 00:34:38,206
Your mom sounds
like she's a fighter.

696
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,555
She is.

697
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,557
She's gonna make a great meta.

698
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:45,648
Just one thing, though.
We're back to square one.

699
00:34:45,692 --> 00:34:48,651
Joe, Cecile, have you found
anything that can help us

700
00:34:48,695 --> 00:34:49,826
in Captain Kramer's files?

701
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,480
I wish.

702
00:34:51,524 --> 00:34:53,830
We're almost through them all,
and still nothing.

703
00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:57,921
So we failed?

704
00:34:57,965 --> 00:34:59,358
No, we didn't fail.

705
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:01,011
Thanks to Frost, now we know

706
00:35:01,055 --> 00:35:02,970
the Cold Fusion Sphere
can contain that thing.

707
00:35:03,013 --> 00:35:05,103
- And that's a win.
- Barry's right.

708
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:07,017
That means we can try again
to capture it.

709
00:35:07,061 --> 00:35:08,584
And this time, it'll work.

710
00:35:08,628 --> 00:35:10,456
If we could create
a strong enough signal,

711
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:12,240
the sphere could work

712
00:35:12,284 --> 00:35:14,721
without someone's cryo-kinetic
RNA in close proximity.

713
00:35:14,764 --> 00:35:16,244
Good, so no bait.

714
00:35:16,288 --> 00:35:18,420
Yeah, which shall keep
Frost and Carla safe.

715
00:35:18,464 --> 00:35:20,118
And then we can catch
the fire again.

716
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:22,859
Take the fight to it this time.

717
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:28,996
I'm telling you, I'm okay.
Really.

718
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,913
- Caity says you need to rest.
- Fine, I'll stay the night.

719
00:35:32,956 --> 00:35:35,698
But then I promise I'll be out
of your hair in the morning.

720
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:37,613
It's really no problem.

721
00:35:37,657 --> 00:35:41,791
Also, I'm sorry
I yelled at you two.

722
00:35:41,835 --> 00:35:44,098
Don't be.
I needed to hear it.

723
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,144
Both of us did.

724
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:48,320
Thank you for keeping us safe.

725
00:35:48,363 --> 00:35:50,800
Like you always do.

726
00:35:50,844 --> 00:35:53,107
Good thing too,
'cause I couldn't lose you.

727
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,456
Either one of you.

728
00:35:57,372 --> 00:35:59,374
Oh, shoot, it's Marcus.

729
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:02,769
He has no idea
what happened today.

730
00:36:02,812 --> 00:36:05,206
What happened to going all in?

731
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,600
Yeah, I really do need
to tell him everything,

732
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:10,211
just not tonight.

733
00:36:11,256 --> 00:36:13,867
Hey, no, I'm fine.

734
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:17,218
Just crazy day at work.
How are you?

735
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:25,792
So about that dinner
we were supposed to have,

736
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:27,465
how about we make it brunch
in the morning?

737
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:29,926
Absolutely.

738
00:36:31,972 --> 00:36:34,670
And Frost, I...

739
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:38,239
I need to apologize too.

740
00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:41,416
I should have told you
about my condition sooner.

741
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,592
I just...

742
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:45,899
I guess I was just worried about

743
00:36:45,942 --> 00:36:47,901
what it could mean for me.

744
00:36:49,511 --> 00:36:51,252
Maybe if we talked more,

745
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:53,496
you would have felt more
comfortable sharing it with me.

746
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,954
Yeah.

747
00:36:57,998 --> 00:36:59,869
It's okay.
Something to work on.

748
00:36:59,913 --> 00:37:01,219
Yeah.

749
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:09,314
I've missed
so much of your life,

750
00:37:09,357 --> 00:37:12,055
and that's my fault.

751
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:17,496
There's so much about you
that I don't know,

752
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:21,064
and so much that I want to know.

753
00:37:21,108 --> 00:37:24,329
- Really?
- Yes, of course.

754
00:37:24,372 --> 00:37:27,854
It's like I said before.
You're my daughter.

755
00:37:31,423 --> 00:37:34,774
And I love you, Frost.

756
00:37:34,817 --> 00:37:37,385
You do?

757
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:38,734
More than you could ever know.

758
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:54,837
You're okay.

759
00:38:08,938 --> 00:38:09,938
Can I help you?

760
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,467
Are you Renee Wazzo?

761
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,598
Who's asking?

762
00:38:18,905 --> 00:38:20,950
Your daughter.

763
00:38:28,218 --> 00:38:31,265
All the adoption websites
warn you about days like this.

764
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,832
That's not what...

765
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:35,356
I mean, it's just...

766
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,359
I guess I knew
this might happen eventually.

767
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:39,795
Maybe even wanted it.

768
00:38:42,015 --> 00:38:43,190
Yeah, me too.

769
00:38:45,845 --> 00:38:47,126
Look, I'm sure you have
so many questions.

770
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:51,372
Just one, actually.

771
00:38:56,421 --> 00:38:58,510
Um...

772
00:38:58,553 --> 00:39:00,381
why didn't you want me?

773
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:08,868
I always wanted you, Tinya.

774
00:39:08,911 --> 00:39:12,175
I want you to know that.

775
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:14,439
The truth is I wanted to be
your mom more than anything,

776
00:39:14,482 --> 00:39:19,008
but I was so young.

777
00:39:19,052 --> 00:39:24,405
I was 16 and confused,
and my parents were furious.

778
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:27,843
They convinced me that
the best thing for both of us

779
00:39:27,887 --> 00:39:32,370
was to sign that clause,
then give you away.

780
00:39:36,722 --> 00:39:38,288
They were wrong.

781
00:39:41,988 --> 00:39:43,748
I swear to you, I've never
regretted anything more

782
00:39:43,772 --> 00:39:45,600
than letting you go.

783
00:39:48,211 --> 00:39:49,604
The only way I could get through

784
00:39:49,648 --> 00:39:51,780
this crap life of mine
that came after

785
00:39:51,824 --> 00:39:55,654
was the hope that you
were living a good life.

786
00:39:57,569 --> 00:39:59,962
A better life without me.

787
00:40:04,663 --> 00:40:08,101
Well, I'm not.

788
00:40:08,144 --> 00:40:09,537
I needed you.

789
00:40:12,497 --> 00:40:14,586
I needed my mother.

790
00:40:17,893 --> 00:40:19,025
Tinya, I...

791
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:24,596
Iris?

792
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:26,902
Whoa.
What is wrong with her?

793
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:28,382
I don't know.

794
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,036
Are you okay?

795
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,741
What the hell?

796
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,918
Mom?

797
00:40:44,572 --> 00:40:46,139
Mom?

798
00:40:46,182 --> 00:40:47,532
Mom!

799
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:52,362
What did you do to my mom?

800
00:41:09,728 --> 00:41:10,946
Frost?

801
00:41:14,646 --> 00:41:15,864
Frost, that isn't funny.

802
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:31,401
Cait, Cait, Cait...
the world's different now.

803
00:41:31,445 --> 00:41:34,056
There is no normal life for us.

804
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,449
Oh, my God.

805
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,539
Cait,
the world's different now.

806
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:40,802
Look, I thought
we could get away,

807
00:41:40,846 --> 00:41:42,325
start a normal life together,

808
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:44,414
but there is no normal life
for us.

809
00:41:46,678 --> 00:41:47,678
Ronnie?

810
00:42:15,968 --> 00:42:17,535
Greg, move your head.
