1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,241
Previously on Gotham:

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,962
Killing Falcone would only create
chaos. I need to siphon his strength.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,291
So when the time is right, taking over his
organization will be like slipping on a glove.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,444
I'm so angry all the time.
Will it ever go away?

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,440
Alfred, can you teach me how to fight?

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,166
- You've been through a lot.
- I'm scared, Jim.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,523
Everywhere I go,
I can feel that monster Zsasz.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,162
Gordon, some unis
brought in a perp. Claims to know you.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,203
Hey, detective.

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,761
Miss me?

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,883
Barbara?

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,247
Whoa.

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,163
Sweet crib.

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,529
You must be one rich cop.

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,641
- It's my girlfriend's place.
- Where is she?

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,764
I don't know. Barbara?

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,764
So, what? I get to stay here alone?

18
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,609
I'm hungry.

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,251
<i>Dear Jim, I thought I could
be strong and brave for you, but I can't.</i>

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,281
<i>Every place I go, I see Falcone and Zsasz.</i>

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,326
<i>I'm nervous and needy and screwed up.
I know that's not what you need or want.</i>

22
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,966
<i>So I'm going away
for a while to get myself together.</i>

23
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,528
This is Gordon.

24
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,684
Oh. Uh, right, yeah. We're in
the penthouse. Come on up.

25
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,363
Sounds like your girlfriend's
not coming back, huh?

26
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,529
Why is she worried about Falcone?

27
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,006
None of your business.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,606
What happens now?
You gonna get the charges dropped?

29
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,610
I will, but you're my only witness
to the Wayne murders.

30
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,808
You gonna cuff me to a drainpipe again?

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,447
I'm not gonna hold you against your will.
G.C.P.D., juvie, you'd break out.

32
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,409
So I do get to stay here.

33
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,404
No. I have someplace else in mind.

34
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,161
That's the sketch artist. I need you
to describe the man who shot the Waynes.

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,483
Wait, where am I going to stay?

36
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,041
Wayne Manor.

37
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,921
Don't speak to the inmate. Don't touch
the inmate unless in service of your job.

38
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,970
Don't accept anything from the inmate
under any circumstances.

39
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,446
Who is this guy, anyway?

40
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,881
Ian Hargrove. Some genius bomb maker.

41
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,162
Took out over a dozen buildings
in Gotham.

42
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,362
The one that blew up the commissary?

43
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,166
Yeah. He did it with match shavings
and apple cider vinegar.

44
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,124
So no mistakes today, got it?

45
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,169
Raise your hands up.

46
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,131
She said this is the man
who killed your parents.

47
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,848
She said she saw his face.

48
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,203
Do you recognize him, Bruce?

49
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,684
No.

50
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,691
What's her name?

51
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,211
Selina Kyle.

52
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,841
- Do you believe her?
- Yes, I do.

53
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,849
So she saw everything?

54
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,888
And you want her to live here with us,
do you?

55
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,880
Common street criminal.

56
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,045
She's hardly older than Bruce.
She's just a kid who's seen too much.

57
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,562
This is for her safety.
G.C.P.D. is full of moles.

58
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,888
How long would you have us
put her up, then?

59
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,320
I don't know.

60
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,161
No, the answer is no. Her being
here will put Master Bruce in great danger.

61
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,521
Alfred.

62
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,810
She is the witness to a murder, Master
Bruce. You do understand that, don't you?

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,881
She's also the best chance we have at
finding who killed my parents. Isn't she?

64
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,048
Yes, she is.

65
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,727
Then she can stay.

66
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,045
As long as it takes.

67
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,201
I've made my decision.

68
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,723
Yes, Master Bruce.

69
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,971
Look, I know this is a lot,
but I'm doing everything I can.

70
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,528
Montoya, Allen and I are meeting
with an ADA they trust this afternoon.

71
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,284
Oh, a trustworthy lawyer. In Gotham.

72
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,889
Look, if we find this guy, we'll need her.

73
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,243
She'll have to testify before a judge.

74
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,967
Won't be easy.
Witnesses back out all the time.

75
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,084
The ones that stick it out
do so because they care about the victims.

76
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,764
We'll do our best to be nice to her, then,
won't we?

77
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,364
That's from the Chinese Ming Dynasty.

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,240
Five.

79
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,565
Five hundred years old.

80
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,211
You can get one just like it
for 5 bucks in Chinatown.

81
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,649
I'm Bruce Wayne.

82
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,484
Selina Kyle.

83
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,249
People call me Cat.

84
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,010
Nice to meet you, Cat.

85
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,009
What are you doing?

86
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,129
- Nothing.
- What's in your hand?

87
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,322
I said, what's in--?

88
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,725
What the hell?

89
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,968
Hargrove!

90
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,362
Ian Hargrove, time to go.

91
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,687
Kid, you screwed up, bigtime.

92
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,044
But you're still young. You deserve
a second chance. I have a bet for you.

93
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,486
You call heads or tails.

94
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,728
You lose, you go to jail.

95
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,001
You win, we let you go.

96
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,363
- Bet.
- Hold on, there's a catch.

97
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,170
You have to make a promise to God. If you
win, you're gonna take this as a sign...

98
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,684
...that you need to go back to school and
get your life straight. Can you promise?

99
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,009
- Do you promise that?
- Yes, sir.

100
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,930
Okay, then.

101
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,969
- Call.
- Heads.

102
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,005
Walk away, kid.
Somebody up there loves you.

103
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,924
Hey, Harvey.

104
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,688
Go. Remember your promise.

105
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,284
Jim Gordon, G.C.P.D.
I hear good things about you, counselor.

106
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,608
Harvey Dent. Likewise about you, detective.

107
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,368
Was some trick with the coin. What if he
guesses wrong? Gonna send him to jail?

108
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,370
Teenagers, they nearly always call heads.
Don't know why.

109
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,964
Two-headed coin.

110
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,200
Whatever works, right?

111
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,082
So who is he, Jim?
Who really killed the Waynes?

112
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,408
Well, this is what we have.

113
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,884
No ID.

114
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,890
But this is from an eyewitness
that you have in custody.

115
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,209
It's not enough to go to the law with.
Even if we had ID...

116
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,368
...it's the people who hired him we want.

117
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,121
I agree.
Your eyewitness is useless in a courtroom.

118
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,008
But the idea of your witness
could be immensely valuable.

119
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,330
Ever hear the name Dick Lovecraft?

120
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,047
Sure. Billionaire.
Property. Construction. Chemicals.

121
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,366
As corrupt as they come.

122
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,769
Falcone, Maroni, even Wayne Enterprises.
Lovecraft has dealings with all of them.

123
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,480
Since the Waynes' deaths, he's doubled his
fortune, including a piece of the Arkham deal.

124
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,286
Lovecraft had a long feud
with Thomas Wayne over deals and politics.

125
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,807
They couldn't have had
a more different vision for Gotham.

126
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,685
I'd bet my career
on his involvement in the Wayne murders.

127
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,927
That's a big bet.

128
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,600
I want to use your witness
to go after Lovecraft.

129
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,644
How? My witness can't connect
Lovecraft to the perp.

130
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,761
Lovecraft doesn't know that.

131
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,525
I'll let it leak out...

132
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,247
...that we have a secret eyewitness
who's going to blow the case wide open...

133
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,568
...and connect Lovecraft
to the Wayne killings.

134
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,086
Lovecraft will get very nervous.

135
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,649
The people around him will get nervous.
And that's when people start talking.

136
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,842
Unless Lovecraft wasn't involved.

137
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,122
If so, which I doubt, we still win.

138
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,642
Whoever was involved
will get their cage rattled, won't they?

139
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,684
- Bet he makes a move.
- You like to bet a lot.

140
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,966
What have we got to lose?

141
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,083
- My witness becomes a target.
- No.

142
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,769
That's the beauty of it. We never
file papers. We never name names.

143
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,328
It's just a powerful story.
Your witness is perfectly safe.

144
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,726
You're on board with this?

145
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,491
We've been on board, Jim.
Harvey's one of us.

146
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,445
I want what you want, Jim.

147
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,049
I want to make this city a better place.

148
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,802
No names. Not mine.
Not my witness. Nothing. Just a story.

149
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,480
Just a story.

150
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,040
All right. Let's try something.

151
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,409
Thought I was gonna have to
work this without you. Where you been?

152
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,082
You know what? On second thought,
never mind, I don't want to know.

153
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,322
- What we got?
- A biggie.

154
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,047
Blackgate prisoner escaped
while in transit for psychiatric care.

155
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,802
Name's Ian Hargrove. Clinically insane,
with a compulsion for blowing things up.

156
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,364
Exploded a bunch of old buildings around
Gotham. Last one, two janitors were killed.

157
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,562
Says here
he was busted out by four gunmen.

158
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,690
Yeah, which is odd.
Hargrove never used accomplices.

159
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,400
All right. Who did he spend time with at
Blackgate? Who did he communicate with?

160
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,008
His entire stretch
he was isolated from gen pop.

161
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,406
Never made or received calls.

162
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,291
Only one visitor in two years,
his brother, John.

163
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,841
- Got an address?
- We do.

164
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,443
Unis are bringing him now for questioning.
We're lucky you deigned to show up.

165
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,644
- Yeah, sorry.
- No problem.

166
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,206
Girl trouble?

167
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,721
Yeah.

168
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,490
I told you, those high-society dames
get you all twisted.

169
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,968
Get your guard up. I'll knock lumps
out of you. Watch your feet.

170
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,525
Right. Jab, jab, right.

171
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,001
Jab, jab, right.

172
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,646
Keep that guard up.

173
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,566
Jab, jab, right.

174
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,321
Jab, jab, right.

175
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,246
Yes.

176
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,528
- Oy!
- Sorry, Alfred.

177
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,882
- Hello.
- Bruce.

178
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,002
- That hurt.
- Yeah, it was supposed to.

179
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,767
Taking a punch is just as important
as throwing one, Master Bruce.

180
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,045
- What you doing?
- Alfred's teaching me to fight.

181
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,121
- Why?
- I'll be prepared if something bad happens.

182
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,287
Yeah, because you live
in a pretty rough neighborhood.

183
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,084
Not here. In Gotham.

184
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,642
In Gotham,
people don't fight with gloves.

185
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,771
How's your room? Good?

186
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,365
It'll do. I'm hungry, though.

187
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,084
Right. Well, breakfast was served at 8,
which you slept through.

188
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,120
- Lunch will be served at 12.
- There's plenty in the kitchen.

189
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,486
Alfred would be happy to fix--

190
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,251
No, he won't be, will he?
He's not a bloody hotel.

191
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,290
Relax, old man. I'll figure it out.

192
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,370
You can mind your manners as well,
you cheeky little minx.

193
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,642
Be nice to her, Alfred. She's our guest.

194
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,523
I'm terribly sorry, Master Bruce.
Didn't realize you fancied her.

195
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,402
What do you mean? No.

196
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,128
It's nothing to be embarrassed about. It's
only natural, isn't it? But you watch her.

197
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,080
She's a lairy one.
All right. Left, left, right.

198
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,526
Keep your guard up, son.

199
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,529
You know about girls, do you, Alfred?

200
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,329
A sight more than you.
And she, mate, is trouble.

201
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,124
Oy. Oy, oy!

202
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,605
Liza, Liza. What are you up to?

203
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,050
Mm.

204
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,969
Lilacs.

205
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,571
I don't know anything about his escape.
I haven't talked to him.

206
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,684
Your baby brother busts out of prison
and doesn't call you?

207
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,168
The only person he's talked to
in two years. What happened?

208
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,885
- You two have a falling-out?
- No.

209
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,043
Ian and I are close. Always have been.

210
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,083
Even after he bombed those janitors?

211
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,361
That was an accident.

212
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,087
<i>- That's what they all say.
- It's the truth.</i>

213
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,091
My brother's not a killer. He never was.

214
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,760
He blew up 12 buildings in Gotham.

215
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,770
Yes. Munitions factories and their offices.

216
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,486
<i>Places that made guns
and bullets and missiles.</i>

217
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,931
<i>I know he was wrong. But Ian thought
that what he was doing was good.</i>

218
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,490
<i>He didn't hurt a soul
until the last bombing.</i>

219
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,730
He felt terrible about it.
Practically handed himself in to the cops.

220
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,962
And pleaded guilty. Ian has had
mental problems since he was a kid.

221
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,010
My parents didn't have money to get him
help. He sure wasn't getting it at Blackgate.

222
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,846
Look, my brother's not a bad man.

223
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,361
Then what is he?

224
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,321
He's sick.

225
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,603
<i>There's a difference.</i>

226
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,730
<i>Okay. So who would want to bust him out?</i>

227
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,251
I don't know.

228
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,723
But my brother needs help.
You have to find him.

229
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,651
It's done.

230
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,850
I have a delivery for you.

231
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,923
I'll take that.

232
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,610
- Whoa. Who sent this, anyway?
- Who cares?

233
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,046
Mm.

234
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,006
Wait a second. You hear that?

235
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,842
Sounds like ticking.

236
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,008
- Good morning.
- Uh-huh.

237
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,642
- How'd you sleep?
- Your house makes noise.

238
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,121
It's old.

239
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,447
You didn't come here with much. If you
want, Alfred can buy you some clothes.

240
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,051
Pass.

241
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,251
Detective Gordon told me
you live on the streets.

242
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,529
Yeah. So?

243
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,442
- What's it like?
- Not as nice as here.

244
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,126
- Do you live alone?
- You gonna ask me questions all morning?

245
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,161
- Aren't you supposed to be in school?
- I'm developing my own curriculum.

246
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,928
It lets me move at my own speed
and focus on areas that interest me.

247
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,764
- Why? You're a billionaire. What's to learn?
- That's a strange attitude.

248
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,280
So where are your parents?

249
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,246
They alive?

250
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,200
Um...

251
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,726
Sure. They're around.

252
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,361
- Where?
- What's that to you?

253
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,206
- Nothing. I just thought--
- Well, you thought wrong.

254
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,691
I'm not an orphan. I got family all over.

255
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,607
This was bad enough
when it was a prison escape.

256
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,328
Now we got five dead security guards, and
the press is calling Hargrove a terrorist.

257
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,249
Get anything from the bombing site?

258
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,922
Forensics is looking into it,
but the entire office was destroyed.

259
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,726
- Including all security footage.
- Yeah.

260
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,323
We do know that Hargrove and his guys
made off with a compound called HMX.

261
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,530
It's military grade.
Ten times more powerful than C4.

262
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,007
- Nasty stuff.
- Using explosives...

263
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,807
...to steal explosives. What's that about?
- Trading up?

264
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,401
- Must be another target that's hard to crack.
- You know what I'm gonna say.

265
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,409
So go. Do it.

266
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,927
This is Gordon.

267
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,004
<i>Yes, detective. It's Alfred.</i>

268
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,086
Alfred. ls everything all right?
Selina okay?

269
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,805
Well, she's safe.

270
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:45,241
- But?
- But I'm afraid this isn't going to work out.

271
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,128
She's a tough nut, this one.

272
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,166
Well, look, we need her help if we have
any chance at catching the Waynes' killer.

273
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,648
Hold on to her for now. I'll be out
to check on her as soon as I can.

274
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,083
We shall patiently await your arrival...

275
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,681
<i>...detective.</i>

276
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,209
- Everything good?
- Right as rain.

277
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,247
- Sure you want to go through with this?
- Butch, don't go getting scared on me now.

278
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,487
Never, boss.

279
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,050
- Oswald, you're back.
- Ha, ha.

280
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,483
I'm starting to think you enjoy being hurt.

281
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,646
I was passing by. Thought I'd say hello.

282
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,606
Well, you've said it.
Now, why are you here?

283
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,769
Honestly, I'm just trying to be friendly.

284
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,364
Mm.

285
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,370
Lilacs. Mm.

286
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,971
You smell good.

287
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,247
You don't.

288
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,684
Snappy as ever. Oh. Ha, ha.

289
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,007
Well, goodbye, then.
Sorry you're still grumpy with me.

290
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:12,882
But you know,
reaching out in friendship is never wrong.

291
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,809
Man, that dude's creepy.

292
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,120
Forget him. He's nothing.

293
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,809
Hargrove's contacts and phone records
from before Blackgate.

294
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,365
Oh.

295
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,720
- You all right?
- Yeah.

296
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,281
Barbara left.

297
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,608
- "Left" left?
- Yeah.

298
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,446
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know.

299
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:57,168
It's a ploy. She wants you to set a date.
It's a standard move. She'll be back.

300
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,647
- Do you play video games?
- Ed.

301
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,411
Don't ever do that again.

302
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,331
My apologies.
Do either of you play video games?

303
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,046
I do. I-- Ha, ha. I love video games.

304
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,365
Each one presents a new challenge.
A puzzle. A lot like detective work.

305
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,404
- Ed.
- Oh. Sorry. I had a chance to analyze...

306
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,524
...the shrapnel from the securities office.
I found something.

307
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,123
It's a name plate. It was damaged,
but you can still read the information.

308
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,529
It's from an abandoned metal factory
here in Gotham.

309
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,282
That's really good work, Ed. Thanks.

310
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,689
- Thank you, detective.
- Let's go check this out.

311
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,131
G.C.P.D. Freeze!

312
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,209
Don't shoot.

313
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,610
- You found the name plate. Thank God.
- Ls anyone else here?

314
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,366
No, but they'll be back soon.
Please help me.

315
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:19,361
They broke me out. They kidnapped me. Said
they'd kill my brother if I didn't help.

316
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,161
- Who's they?
- Russians. One of their names is Kasyanov.

317
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,250
- Planning something against Falcone.
- Falcone?

318
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,166
Yeah, it's a big job. A vault. That's why
they needed me to build explosives.

319
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,811
What's this?

320
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,685
Behind you. Get down! Get down!

321
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,045
Keep them pinned down!

322
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,964
- Get out of here.
- Help me!

323
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,207
Move, move.

324
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,760
Come on.

325
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,569
If you want to go somewhere,
we can call you a taxi.

326
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,450
- You move quiet.
- So do you.

327
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,644
Are you leaving?

328
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,481
Thinking about it.

329
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,201
I'm sorry if talking about your family
upset you.

330
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,606
I wasn't upset.

331
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,684
You seemed kind of upset.

332
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,120
That's your mom, huh?

333
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,731
She looks nice.

334
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,447
She was.

335
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,284
You saw her.

336
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,086
The night she was killed.

337
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,085
Uh-huh.

338
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,365
And you saw me?

339
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,326
What I did. What I didn't do.

340
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,248
What are you talking about?
What could you have done?

341
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,720
I don't know. Something.

342
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,002
You're dreaming, kid.

343
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,764
A gun's a gun.

344
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,687
My mom's in show business.

345
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,527
Oh?

346
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,883
Yeah. She sings and dances
and does magic tricks.

347
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,887
Gets paid like millions.

348
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,085
But that's just a cover. Really,
she's a secret agent for the government.

349
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,404
Wow.

350
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,089
Yeah. She's on a secret mission.

351
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,002
But when she's done,
she's coming back to get me.

352
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,403
That's good.

353
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,090
Yeah.

354
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,968
Did you ever kiss a girl?

355
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,366
No.

356
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,130
Do you want to?

357
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,049
Why do you ask?

358
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,530
Just curious.

359
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,646
Time for your studies, Master Bruce.

360
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,327
Thank you, Alfred.

361
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,122
You're more than welcome to join,
Ms. Kyle.

362
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,330
Right.

363
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,371
I'll see you later.

364
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,521
Do you have any idea how many angry
phone calls we've been getting this week?

365
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,007
- Got a terrorist out there.
- That's our fault?

366
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,725
Jim.

367
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,044
No. Please.

368
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,286
You tell me, detective.
How is this my fault?

369
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,802
For starters, you have the mentally ill
housed at Blackgate.

370
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,249
A prison with no facilities for them.
You send them out for treatment.

371
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,490
Which was exactly where Hargrove was
headed when he was broken out.

372
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,528
- I want him found.
- Yes, sir.

373
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,808
- Today.
- Yes, sir.

374
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,051
What is wrong with you?

375
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:35,170
Hargrove's brother, John? I put him
and his family in protective custody.

376
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,606
That'll help.

377
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,929
Only problem is,
Hargrove doesn't know that.

378
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,644
All right, Dent. You drag me down here.
Now what?

379
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,724
I got the last piece of the puzzle in
place. I'm bringing charges against you.

380
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,284
Oh, that old song again.
You will never prove fraud.

381
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,131
You know that, and I know that.

382
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,163
Fraud charges are only part of it.

383
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,523
Oh, really? What, then, jaywalking?

384
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,367
Conspiracy to commit
first-degree murder.

385
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,241
Murder? So tell me, Dent. Who did I kill?

386
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,445
Thomas and Martha Wayne.

387
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,404
Oh, my God.

388
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,401
I have an eyewitness who can tie you to
the crime. You and all the others involved.

389
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,364
It's absurd.

390
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,364
Help yourself out here, Dick.

391
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,924
Think about your options.
This is going to get ugly.

392
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,530
You're a fool.

393
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,971
And you have no idea who or what
you're even dealing with.

394
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:55,564
Don't threaten me! I will rip you open.

395
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,891
It's good to see you, Dick.

396
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,967
- Jim. Got it.
- Yeah.

397
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,410
Meet Gregory Kasyanov. Long rap sheet.
Worked for Nikolai before he died.

398
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,207
- Who's he work for now?
- Beats me.

399
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,689
All right. Hargrove said it was a big job,
a vault. Somebody's gotta be bankrolling it.

400
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,161
Someone with cash and pull
and beef with Falcone.

401
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,728
Problem is, in Gotham, anyone with
cash and pull has beef with Falcone.

402
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,922
Hmm. So who is it?

403
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,563
You kept me waiting.

404
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,685
Ran into a little trouble.
Nothing to worry about.

405
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,201
Good. I've got a lot riding on this job.

406
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,806
You've said.

407
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:07,011
Your boss, Nikolai,
is dead because of Falcone.

408
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,489
You want to get back at him,
you hit him where it hurts, his money.

409
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,246
- Ain't that right, Butch?
- Yup.

410
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,965
The root of all evil.

411
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,130
We'll take his money. No problem.

412
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,607
As long as it's there, like you said.

413
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:28,046
Oh, it's there. I'm positive.
The truck you needed.

414
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,962
And Gregor?

415
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,324
Break a leg.

416
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,162
You're the weirdest kid I've ever met.

417
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,487
- Why are you doing that?
- Training.

418
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,489
Oh.

419
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,409
Like the boxing.

420
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,650
So if anyone mugs you with a diving board,
you'll be ready? Huh?

421
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,208
Yes. I mean no.

422
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,802
- I'm developing self-discipline and willpower.
- Why?

423
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,886
So I can be strong.

424
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,204
I get you. But it won't work.

425
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,166
- Not on the streets. Not in Gotham.
- Why's that?

426
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,170
Out there on the streets,
it's not enough to be strong.

427
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,686
You gotta be mean.
You gotta be ruthless.

428
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,000
Know what ruthless means?

429
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,967
- Of course I do.
- Yeah?

430
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,329
Well, you ain't. You're a nice kid.

431
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,807
Five minutes on the street,
you'll be mincemeat.

432
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,566
And holding your breath
won't do a damn thing.

433
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,444
<i>The subject for today's
category is numbers. Here we go.</i>

434
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,603
<i>How many bones in the human arm?</i>

435
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,961
Thirty-two.

436
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,845
<i>- Thirty-two.
- Correct.</i>

437
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,011
<i>Next, how many
elements in the periodic table?</i>

438
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,281
One hundred eighteen.

439
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,771
<i>- Uh, 118.
- Yes, again.</i>

440
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,249
<i>Now for a tough one.
How many eyes are there on cards in a deck?</i>

441
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,566
Forty-two.

442
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,807
<i>Twenty-one.</i>

443
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:51,251
<i>No, sorry.
The number you were looking for is 42.</i>

444
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,887
<i>You forgot to double it for two eyes.</i>

445
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,081
Whoo! Ha, ha.

446
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,841
<i>That concludes our show for today.
We'd like to thank all our contestants...</i>

447
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,682
<i>...and those of you playing along at home.
We'll be right back after this.</i>

448
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,326
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What about the explosives?

449
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,608
It's a very specific type.

450
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,202
It's highly volatile,
and it's very difficult to manufacture.

451
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,410
It's for one use, and one use only.

452
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,331
- To penetrate iron.
- Like a vault in a bank.

453
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,567
Mm-mm. No, they're steel.

454
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,481
No one makes anything out of iron anymore.
Not for a hundred years.

455
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,685
The Gotham Armory.

456
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,561
Yeah. They have those iron vaults
they used to keep the gunpowder in.

457
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,240
A few years ago,
a private investment group bought it.

458
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,124
Ten to one Falcone's behind it.

459
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,169
Mm-hm. Do you--?

460
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,768
How much longer?

461
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,690
It's ready.

462
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,769
It didn't work.

463
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,727
Hey, hey. Promise me
nobody else is going to get hurt.

464
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,686
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.
No problem. Cross my heart.

465
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,080
You're surrounded.

466
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,886
There's no way out.

467
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,728
Drop your weapons!

468
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,769
Don't do it. Get back.

469
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,330
Hargrove!

470
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,243
Ian Hargrove,
your brother and his family are safe.

471
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,920
We have them in protective custody.

472
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,729
- If he runs, shoot him.
- Don't shoot!

473
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,969
- You shoot him, they shoot us.
- Drop your weapons.

474
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,411
Get away from the truck!

475
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,726
Everybody down!

476
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,281
Mm.

477
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,531
- Why'd you do that?
- Bet you can't hit me.

478
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,481
I could. Why would I want to?

479
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,648
- Try.
- What for?

480
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,602
Hit me, and...

481
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,481
...hmm, I'll let you kiss me.

482
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,246
Ha!

483
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,847
- You didn't get me.
- Oh, no.

484
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,084
- Oh!
- Ha-ha-ha.

485
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,200
Stop it! No, hey--!

486
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,247
- Morning, Alfred.
- Detective.

487
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,171
I've been trying to get out there.
Sorry. Everything okay?

488
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,887
<i>- Is she behaving herself?</i>
- Well, not really, no.

489
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,242
- It's all right.
- It is?

490
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,650
Yes, well,
she's a breath of fresh air, I might say.

491
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,371
Glad to hear it.
I'll be out there as soon as I can.

492
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,642
Very good, sir.

493
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,443
Oh.

494
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,564
Forgive me for the intrusion,
but it's urgent I speak with you.

495
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,926
You know who I am.

496
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,849
Yeah.

497
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,767
Falcone would kill you
if he knew you were here.

498
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,324
Perhaps.

499
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,890
But what would he do if I told him
you were spying on him for Fish Mooney?

500
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,170
You don't have any proof.

501
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,851
No.

502
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:08,569
But suspicion, it's a funny thing. Heh.

503
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,561
Falcone might not choose to believe me at
first, but every time he looked at you...

504
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,651
...he'd ask himself, "Is she?

505
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,003
Could she? Would she?"

506
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,965
You're wrong. He cares about me.

507
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,166
Let's call him and find out, shall we?

508
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,127
Stop!

509
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,201
Your secret is safe with me.

510
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,402
I won't tell...

511
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,965
...because you are going
to keep working for Fish.

512
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:03,166
And you are not gonna tell anyone,
or you'll die.

513
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,282
Messages for Gordon? Thanks.

514
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,603
- Jim, you have a minute?
- Uh, yeah.

515
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,801
- I met with Lovecraft.
- How'd it go?

516
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,002
He was scared. He's involved, all right.

517
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,282
- Scared isn't proof.
- You didn't see him.

518
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,809
Told the same story in a few other spots.
All the players know. Someone will talk.

519
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,403
If and when they do, no one makes a move
without talking first. Move together on this.

520
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,410
Absolutely.
Nice work on the Hargrove case.

521
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,568
You saved his life. You're a regular saint.

522
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,082
- Thanks. We'll talk again soon, I hope?
- You bet.

523
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,441
Thanks, counselor.

524
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,844
- Finish up with Hargrove?
- Yeah.

525
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,044
- He's on his way to Arkham.
- Arkham?

526
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,449
Mayor's directive. He's taking
all the criminally insane inmates...

527
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,524
...and sending them to Arkham
for appropriate treatment.

528
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,889
That's nuts. The building's 200 years old.

529
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,491
Welcome to Gotham.

530
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:06,162
Oh. Hargrove said the bomb
that blew up the money wasn't his.

531
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,801
- Whose was it?
- He didn't know.

532
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,085
How did it go?

533
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,041
Cops were everywhere.
My guys had no way out.

534
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,564
- Had to make the call.
- Is everybody dead? Gregor? All his men?

535
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,451
Every last one.

536
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,407
Good. I can't stand loose strings.

537
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,730
You're not mad?
That's a hell of a lot of money we lost.

538
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,844
Mad? I couldn't be happier.

539
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,090
The point wasn't to steal that money.
It was to hurt Falcone.

540
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,929
Well, that you did, Fish. That you did.

541
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,442
Good afternoon.
Thank you all for coming.

542
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:58,205
As you know, the people of Gotham have
been shaken by tragedy in recent days.

543
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,042
<i>Tragedy no citizen should have to endure.</i>

544
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:08,690
<i>What has happened these past few days is
a result of Gotham's criminally insane...</i>

545
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:14,051
<i>...not getting the appropriate treatment
and help that we owe them.</i>

546
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:20,486
<i>That is why I am moving forward with plans
to turn the renovated Arkham Asylum...</i>

547
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,931
<i>...into a remedial facility
for the criminally insane.</i>

548
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,446
Barbara, it's me.

549
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,406
I got your letter, and I, um...

550
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:39,208
<i>...know you said you needed
some time away from Gotham.</i>

551
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,289
<i>From me.</i>

552
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,609
But I want you to come back.

553
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,765
<i>I need you to come back.</i>

554
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,207
<i>I don't have anything without you.</i>

555
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,169
And I love you.
