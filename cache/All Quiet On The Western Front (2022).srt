1
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:04,040
Attack!

2
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,082
Attack!

3
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:10,749
-Go! Come on! Get out there!
-To the ladders!

4
00:03:11,332 --> 00:03:12,332
Get out!

5
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,999
Heinrich, come on, move! Let's go!

6
00:03:16,082 --> 00:03:17,623
To the ladders!

7
00:03:17,707 --> 00:03:19,290
On my command!

8
00:03:19,374 --> 00:03:20,457
-Charge!
-Hans?

9
00:03:22,624 --> 00:03:25,040
Attack! Get out there!

10
00:03:25,124 --> 00:03:27,457
Go! Charge!

11
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,666
-Hans?
-Go, Heinrich! Get out there!

12
00:03:34,874 --> 00:03:35,874
Attack!

13
00:03:39,749 --> 00:03:41,124
Keep going!

14
00:03:41,749 --> 00:03:42,915
Keep going!

15
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,457
Faster! Go! Faster!

16
00:04:02,332 --> 00:04:03,332
Take cover!

17
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:09,332
Heinrich!

18
00:04:12,457 --> 00:04:13,665
Heinrich!

19
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:07,749
ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT

20
00:08:10,499 --> 00:08:14,665
NORTHERN GERMANY
SPRING 1917

21
00:08:16,332 --> 00:08:19,498
THIRD YEAR OF WAR

22
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:39,748
-Paul!
-Paul!

23
00:08:42,749 --> 00:08:43,874
Paul. Hey.

24
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,749
Well?

25
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,374
-So, what now?
-Don't know.

26
00:08:50,457 --> 00:08:52,373
-Does he know we're all going?
-Of course.

27
00:08:52,457 --> 00:08:53,457
You're staying home?

28
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:56,041
My God, staying tied
to your mummy's apron-strings?

29
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,166
Here, I'll sign it for you.

30
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:02,332
-His parents have to do that.
-But they didn't. Give it here.

31
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,582
-It won't work. They'll find out.
-How?

32
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:07,624
How? Are they pen pals with his father?

33
00:09:11,582 --> 00:09:13,457
-Give me your pen.
-I don't have one.

34
00:09:14,582 --> 00:09:15,832
Ludwig.

35
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:18,124
You'll be in trouble.
You'll get a thrashing.

36
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:21,290
Got a better idea?
I won't be the only one left behind.

37
00:09:34,832 --> 00:09:35,665
Yeah!

38
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,832
Congratulations, Private Baumer.
You're going to the front.

39
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,082
I'm a dead man.

40
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,457
You're standing here
on the threshold of existence.

41
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:49,374
Remember this moment.

42
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:52,707
It's an important moment.

43
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:57,291
In years to come, you will be judged
on what you dared to become today.

44
00:09:59,124 --> 00:10:00,915
The Iron Youth of Germany.

45
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,457
My friends,

46
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,207
you are fortunate
to be living in great times.

47
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,749
Your deeds will be the water

48
00:10:08,832 --> 00:10:12,123
that will nourish a strong and noble root.

49
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:14,623
Stand still and listen, Leinemann!

50
00:10:14,707 --> 00:10:16,873
The Kaiser needs soldiers, not children.

51
00:10:19,249 --> 00:10:23,624
I am sure that I will see most of you
here at home again soon,

52
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,748
your sword returned
to its scabbard with honour.

53
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:32,124
With an Iron Cross
pinned to your proud chest.

54
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:34,540
But don't be fooled.

55
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:39,416
During the darkest hours out there
as you await an attack,

56
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,457
you may start to harbour doubts.

57
00:10:43,707 --> 00:10:46,457
But this is no time for weakness of mind!

58
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:51,332
Any wavering, any hesitation
is a betrayal of the Fatherland!

59
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:55,624
Modern warfare is like a game of chess.

60
00:10:55,707 --> 00:10:59,540
It's never about the individual.
It's always about the whole.

61
00:11:01,624 --> 00:11:04,540
You will prove yourselves
worthy of your uniforms

62
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:08,165
and break through
the enemy front in Flanders.

63
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:11,707
And then, in just a few weeks,

64
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:14,957
you will finally march on Paris!

65
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,707
-Yes!
-Yes!

66
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,041
Our future,

67
00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:20,332
the future of Germany,

68
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,166
lies in the hands
of its greatest generation.

69
00:11:25,374 --> 00:11:27,832
My friends, that's you!

70
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:28,874
Yes!

71
00:11:28,957 --> 00:11:30,915
So, off to battle!

72
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:34,082
For Kaiser, God and Fatherland!

73
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,249
Yes!

74
00:11:37,707 --> 00:11:39,790
-Bravo!
-Yes!

75
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,166
Next.

76
00:11:49,082 --> 00:11:50,082
Next.

77
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:51,832
Next.

78
00:11:52,332 --> 00:11:53,332
Next.

79
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:56,374
Next.

80
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:59,415
Baumer, Paul. 53 Wiesengrund.

81
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:01,665
Born 18th November '99.

82
00:12:01,749 --> 00:12:03,707
-Correct?
-Yes, sir.

83
00:12:08,874 --> 00:12:09,874
Next.

84
00:12:11,124 --> 00:12:11,957
Paul?

85
00:12:13,874 --> 00:12:16,290
Here. Your father can be proud of you.

86
00:12:16,374 --> 00:12:17,874
-Yes.
-Next.

87
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,874
Everything all right?

88
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:24,540
-Yes, I just want to get going at last.
-Next.

89
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:25,457
Off you go.

90
00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:27,582
Next.

91
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:31,832
Excuse me.

92
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:33,249
This belongs to someone.

93
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:34,790
Next.

94
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:39,082
Yes. It was probably too small
for the fellow. Happens all the time.

95
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:40,791
Here. Take care.

96
00:12:41,457 --> 00:12:42,582
Thank you.

97
00:12:59,457 --> 00:13:01,415
Blimey, as if they were tailor-made!

98
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:05,915
Well, Ludwig,
are you going to get all the girls now?

99
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:06,999
Yeah.

100
00:13:07,082 --> 00:13:08,873
As long as you don't shoot us.

101
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:14,040
Girl, I do love you

102
00:13:14,124 --> 00:13:17,249
But I can't marry you just yet

103
00:13:17,332 --> 00:13:19,873
Wait another year
Then it will...

104
00:13:19,957 --> 00:13:21,290
She won't wait, Franz.

105
00:13:22,957 --> 00:13:23,873
She won't wait.

106
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,332
You lady killer, you.

107
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:38,582
Drink a cup of tea, sugar and coffee

108
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,916
Drink a cup of tea, sugar and coffee

109
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:45,790
And a glass of wine

110
00:13:45,874 --> 00:13:49,040
And a glass of wine

111
00:13:50,082 --> 00:13:53,290
Girl, I do love you

112
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:57,082
But I can't marry you just yet

113
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:01,249
Wait another year
Then it will come true

114
00:14:01,332 --> 00:14:04,623
Wait another year
Then it will come true...

115
00:14:12,582 --> 00:14:16,498
LA MALMAISON, NORTHERN FRANCE
25 KM TO THE WESTERN FRONT

116
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,041
What's your name, soldier?

117
00:14:30,124 --> 00:14:32,249
Kropp. Albert Kropp, sir.

118
00:14:32,332 --> 00:14:34,165
Do you like dirty girls, Kropp?

119
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,791
Do you like dirty girls?

120
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,124
No, sir.

121
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:44,123
Why did you sleep with one then?

122
00:14:44,832 --> 00:14:46,707
Report for guard duty at 3 a.m.

123
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,832
Gentlemen, you'll be fighting
in an absolute shithole.

124
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:54,207
And you'd better do it with a clean G98.

125
00:14:55,124 --> 00:14:56,207
You'll pamper it.

126
00:14:56,874 --> 00:14:57,915
You'll love it.

127
00:14:58,957 --> 00:15:02,332
And damn it, you'll keep it as spotless
as the Holy Virgin's thighs.

128
00:15:02,957 --> 00:15:05,915
-Do we understand each other?
-Yes, sir!

129
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:08,790
Welcome
to the 78th Infantry Reserve Regiment.

130
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,124
We're on the Western Front now.

131
00:15:13,332 --> 00:15:15,665
Welcome to Paris!

132
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:16,582
Yes!

133
00:15:46,707 --> 00:15:48,165
Damn it, what happened?

134
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,374
I have to deliver the company
to the front by 6 p.m.

135
00:15:51,457 --> 00:15:54,582
You can, but on foot.
We need the trucks, Lieutenant.

136
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:58,457
-With all due respect, my orders...
-You can stick your orders up your arse!

137
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,874
I've got 40 men here dying in the mud.
Get out right now!

138
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:05,999
Everyone out!

139
00:16:07,582 --> 00:16:09,290
Come on. Make it snappy.

140
00:16:10,374 --> 00:16:11,957
You heard the staff surgeon.

141
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:17,249
Faster, soldiers! Don't fall asleep here!

142
00:16:20,582 --> 00:16:21,707
Come on!

143
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:29,624
-Franz Muller, right?
-Yes.

144
00:16:30,374 --> 00:16:33,957
The commander-in-chief expects you
to survive at least six weeks.

145
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,499
-Do you want to be alive in six weeks?
-Yes, sir.

146
00:16:36,582 --> 00:16:39,623
Then stop dragging your feet
and get a move on!

147
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,832
-Did you hear me?
-Yes.

148
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:44,249
Hurry up!

149
00:16:44,832 --> 00:16:46,457
We're not at a tea dance!

150
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,874
Gas!

151
00:16:55,624 --> 00:16:57,499
-Gas!
-Gas!

152
00:16:57,999 --> 00:16:59,665
Gas!

153
00:16:59,749 --> 00:17:00,957
Gas!

154
00:17:02,249 --> 00:17:03,832
Gas masks on!

155
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:06,832
That, gentlemen, was a fat pig.

156
00:17:07,332 --> 00:17:09,165
If the French could aim better,

157
00:17:09,249 --> 00:17:13,749
they'd be scraping us off the road now
with a spoon and burying us in a mess tin.

158
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:17,415
But one thing is as sure as eggs is eggs.

159
00:17:18,082 --> 00:17:21,415
Fat pigs don't carry gas.

160
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:23,957
Eyes front!

161
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:40,665
-Have you got cloth ears?
-No, sir.

162
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,416
I was just trying to put on my mask.

163
00:17:50,874 --> 00:17:54,499
You, Paul Baumer,
will almost certainly be dead by dawn.

164
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,541
You should eat something, damn it.

165
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,207
Attention! Gas masks off!

166
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:03,332
Gas masks off!

167
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,957
Not you. You keep yours on
until guard duty tonight.

168
00:18:07,957 --> 00:18:09,373
With that bonehead there.

169
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,624
Line up! March!

170
00:18:13,457 --> 00:18:16,290
Stick together and get moving!

171
00:18:17,374 --> 00:18:19,457
Come on, hurry up!

172
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:40,416
Paul! Paul, come on.
Give me your backpack.

173
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:42,249
You can carry mine next time.

174
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,249
Congratulations, soldiers.

175
00:18:56,332 --> 00:18:58,248
This is your new home.

176
00:18:58,332 --> 00:18:59,248
Helmets off!

177
00:19:00,624 --> 00:19:03,374
I see the men have been enjoying
my absence, Steinberger.

178
00:19:03,457 --> 00:19:05,248
There was gunfire all night.

179
00:19:05,332 --> 00:19:06,582
Their nerves are shot.

180
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,582
Dry boots are a good remedy for that.

181
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:10,832
Do you want us all to drown?

182
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,457
Everyone pitches in! Bail out the trench.

183
00:19:19,582 --> 00:19:21,248
What are you waiting for, Baumer?

184
00:19:21,957 --> 00:19:23,665
Why are you still standing around?

185
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,832
Throw a dog a bone,

186
00:19:29,374 --> 00:19:30,790
it will always snap it up.

187
00:19:32,707 --> 00:19:34,082
Give a man power...

188
00:19:38,207 --> 00:19:39,248
Man is a beast.

189
00:19:40,832 --> 00:19:41,832
Drink.

190
00:19:45,582 --> 00:19:48,165
Katczinsky, come over here. Lend a hand.

191
00:19:53,707 --> 00:19:55,332
We'll get hit hard tonight.

192
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:25,916
Sorry.

193
00:20:27,207 --> 00:20:28,207
Forget about it.

194
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,957
This isn't how I imagined it.

195
00:20:31,582 --> 00:20:32,540
Shut up, Ludwig.

196
00:20:33,624 --> 00:20:36,374
My hands. I can't feel my hands any more.

197
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:47,249
Stick them down your trousers.
That's what I always do.

198
00:21:27,624 --> 00:21:29,582
You think that will make it shoot better?

199
00:21:44,082 --> 00:21:45,582
-Did you hear that?
-What?

200
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:48,374
That sound. Listen.

201
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:49,999
There's nothing there.

202
00:22:00,582 --> 00:22:01,832
Our first Frenchmen.

203
00:22:02,457 --> 00:22:03,623
Calm down, Paulie.

204
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:10,666
I hear it now too.

205
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:22,915
Who's there?

206
00:22:24,332 --> 00:22:25,540
Hey.

207
00:22:27,874 --> 00:22:28,874
Show yourself!

208
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:48,332
No!

209
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:51,332
I got hit!

210
00:22:52,082 --> 00:22:54,457
-No, Paul. No.
-What's going on there?

211
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,541
Oh, no.

212
00:23:02,957 --> 00:23:03,957
What is it?

213
00:23:04,624 --> 00:23:06,540
They shot at me from over there.

214
00:23:12,332 --> 00:23:14,123
They saw your muzzle flash.

215
00:23:16,374 --> 00:23:17,665
Keep your heads down.

216
00:23:17,749 --> 00:23:21,290
Unless you want to catch the next bullet
with your teeth, move ten metres.

217
00:23:21,374 --> 00:23:24,124
Shoot, then move.
Shoot, then move. Understood?

218
00:23:25,874 --> 00:23:26,707
Yes.

219
00:23:42,207 --> 00:23:43,040
Come on.

220
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:35,957
Take cover!

221
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:40,082
In here!

222
00:24:40,957 --> 00:24:43,332
Baumer, Kropp! You two, in here. Quick!

223
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:44,916
In the bunker!

224
00:24:47,999 --> 00:24:50,207
Get in!

225
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,457
"Watch what you eat."

226
00:25:11,332 --> 00:25:12,957
That's what my mother said.

227
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:18,124
-We'll stick together, Paul.
-Yeah.

228
00:25:18,207 --> 00:25:19,790
-We'll stick together.
-Yeah.

229
00:25:21,707 --> 00:25:24,582
I can't do this, Paul.
I can't do this. I want to go home.

230
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:26,249
I want to go home.

231
00:25:47,457 --> 00:25:48,748
Creeping barrage.

232
00:25:52,082 --> 00:25:53,207
What?

233
00:25:54,457 --> 00:25:57,457
Every few minutes,
the artillery barrage moves forward,

234
00:25:58,624 --> 00:25:59,999
and directly behind it,

235
00:26:00,957 --> 00:26:02,582
the infantry advances.

236
00:26:04,332 --> 00:26:05,457
What does that mean?

237
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:07,207
They're coming.

238
00:26:28,207 --> 00:26:30,498
-Where are you going?
-I'll be right back.

239
00:26:31,124 --> 00:26:32,749
The barrage is nearly over.

240
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:36,041
-No. Let me go.
-Calm down.

241
00:26:36,124 --> 00:26:38,624
-Let me out. I want to get out of here.
-Calm down!

242
00:26:40,082 --> 00:26:41,082
Calm down.

243
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:46,374
No!

244
00:26:50,874 --> 00:26:52,374
Get out!

245
00:26:52,457 --> 00:26:53,915
Get out!

246
00:27:00,207 --> 00:27:01,498
Move! Get out!

247
00:27:01,582 --> 00:27:02,748
Get out of here!

248
00:27:02,832 --> 00:27:04,040
Everyone, get out!

249
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,499
Paul. That's Paul.

250
00:27:57,582 --> 00:27:58,748
Albert!

251
00:27:58,832 --> 00:28:00,665
Albert, we've found Paul!

252
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:04,707
We have to move that beam.

253
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:08,624
Paul.

254
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:10,249
Paul.

255
00:28:12,707 --> 00:28:13,707
Are you okay?

256
00:28:14,874 --> 00:28:15,999
Are you okay, Paul?

257
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:19,290
Come on. Paul, come on. I'll help you.

258
00:28:19,874 --> 00:28:22,207
Come on. Up you come. Sit down.

259
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:23,832
-Are you injured?
-Keep going.

260
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:25,041
Paul, are you injured?

261
00:28:25,624 --> 00:28:27,165
-Can you hear me?
-Albert Kropp, we need help!

262
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:29,374
-See you later, Paul.
-See you later, Paul.

263
00:29:46,707 --> 00:29:48,665
Katczinsky, get on with it!

264
00:29:48,749 --> 00:29:50,707
And you? Are you injured?

265
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:51,624
No.

266
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,249
Then start collecting.

267
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:55,416
Oh, man!

268
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:06,291
Hard work pays off.

269
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:04,666
Come on! Keep moving now!

270
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:06,749
We haven't got all day.

271
00:34:21,249 --> 00:34:22,915
Albrecht, Karl. Diepholz.

272
00:34:22,999 --> 00:34:24,624
18 MONTHS LATER

273
00:34:24,707 --> 00:34:28,707
14th September 1898.

274
00:34:32,666 --> 00:34:35,707
Blumenthal, Samuel.

275
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:40,707
Dresden, 6th November 1900.

276
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:43,416
It was his birthday yesterday.

277
00:34:46,874 --> 00:34:49,332
Von Gallwitz, Gustav.

278
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:54,791
Osnabriick, 20th June '99.

279
00:34:56,166 --> 00:34:57,666
Gotz Luttwitz...

280
00:34:57,749 --> 00:34:58,624
That's enough.

281
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:12,791
GERMAN HIGH COMMAND
7 NOVEMBER 1918

282
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:37,624
Mr. Erzberger.

283
00:35:47,124 --> 00:35:48,332
May God be with us.

284
00:35:49,499 --> 00:35:52,374
Again more than 40,000 dead
in the last weeks alone.

285
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:56,249
That should convince the general staff.

286
00:35:57,791 --> 00:35:59,999
I think the gentlemen know it's over.

287
00:36:02,499 --> 00:36:03,499
We all know.

288
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,041
The Field Marshal.

289
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:36,040
CHAMPAGNE, FRANCE
OCCUPIED TERRITORY

290
00:36:56,457 --> 00:36:57,790
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

291
00:37:10,791 --> 00:37:14,666
If we keep up this pace, Paul,
we'll have conquered France in 180 years.

292
00:37:15,832 --> 00:37:17,040
I worked it out.

293
00:37:18,749 --> 00:37:20,124
Don't get caught, Kat.

294
00:37:22,332 --> 00:37:23,623
Never.

295
00:37:33,082 --> 00:37:34,165
Listen.

296
00:37:37,207 --> 00:37:39,832
What do you think, Paul?
Is it worth dying for?

297
00:37:41,457 --> 00:37:43,165
It is when you're hungry.

298
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:41,916
Kat?

299
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:45,374
Kat?

300
00:38:46,874 --> 00:38:47,707
Run!

301
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:49,124
Hey! Dirty Kraut!

302
00:38:49,957 --> 00:38:50,790
Run!

303
00:39:11,874 --> 00:39:14,165
Men, you're heroes.

304
00:39:14,249 --> 00:39:16,374
Shut the door,
or the others will smell it.

305
00:39:19,249 --> 00:39:22,040
-Password.
- I don't know. I've forgotten everything.

306
00:39:22,124 --> 00:39:24,957
-Use your Prussian brain.
-Here. Eyes wide, long fingers.

307
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:26,832
-Exactly.
-Mouth open, goose in.

308
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:29,874
A piece of goose from the goose.
From Franz to Franz.

309
00:39:29,957 --> 00:39:30,957
I'll have a wing.

310
00:39:31,041 --> 00:39:32,957
Do I have to share? I'll have the rest.

311
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:34,041
Well, in with it!

312
00:39:35,249 --> 00:39:38,165
Come here, you blind hen.
Wide-mouthed frog.

313
00:39:38,249 --> 00:39:40,707
-May we rest in peace under the barrage.
-Oh, God.

314
00:39:41,707 --> 00:39:44,623
Oh, God.
Hey, boys, I'll never forget this.

315
00:40:11,416 --> 00:40:12,582
Does it taste good?

316
00:40:13,499 --> 00:40:14,332
Yes.

317
00:40:15,624 --> 00:40:17,374
-And you?
-Yes, good.

318
00:40:20,457 --> 00:40:21,498
Good, Paul?

319
00:40:21,582 --> 00:40:22,457
Good, Kat.

320
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:23,457
Life is short.

321
00:40:24,416 --> 00:40:28,624
Where's Emil when you need him?
Emil, bring over the coffee and caviar!

322
00:40:28,707 --> 00:40:31,082
Yes, and run a foot bath.
I need a foot bath.

323
00:40:32,374 --> 00:40:33,374
Kat?

324
00:40:33,874 --> 00:40:34,749
What is it?

325
00:40:36,124 --> 00:40:39,415
You stole the goose
Give it back

326
00:40:39,499 --> 00:40:41,290
Give it back

327
00:40:41,374 --> 00:40:43,290
-Or the hunter will get you...
-The farmer!

328
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:44,749
The farmer! Yes!

329
00:40:44,832 --> 00:40:49,332
Or the farmer will get you
With his rifle...

330
00:41:16,457 --> 00:41:20,915
Tjaden sits very quietly and says,
"All I ever hear about is crosses."

331
00:41:20,999 --> 00:41:23,082
"My father was Captain of Nazareth.”

332
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:25,916
"Captain of Nazareth?" asks the teacher.

333
00:41:26,624 --> 00:41:30,082
"Never heard of it.
Tjaden, go home and ask again, okay?"

334
00:41:30,582 --> 00:41:33,957
The next morning,
Tjaden rushes into the classroom and says,

335
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:37,291
"I'm so sorry,
my father wasn't Captain of Nazareth."

336
00:41:37,832 --> 00:41:39,957
"My father had the clap in a lazaret."

337
00:41:45,749 --> 00:41:47,374
Tjaden didn't even go to school.

338
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:51,374
Look!

339
00:42:15,707 --> 00:42:16,790
Hey! Hello!

340
00:42:18,082 --> 00:42:19,082
Come here!

341
00:42:19,999 --> 00:42:21,207
Fresh baguette!

342
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:23,123
For you!

343
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,207
Leberwurst, love!

344
00:42:25,707 --> 00:42:26,873
Lots of love!

345
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:42,916
Hey, Franz, where are you going?

346
00:42:44,124 --> 00:42:46,249
-Take me with you!
-Come on then!

347
00:42:53,207 --> 00:42:54,082
Look!

348
00:42:54,582 --> 00:42:56,498
Now he's making a fool of himself.

349
00:42:57,457 --> 00:43:00,957
Ooh la la! You're very beautiful, my love.

350
00:43:02,374 --> 00:43:03,207
Franz!

351
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:05,124
The skinny dark-haired one is mine!

352
00:43:15,124 --> 00:43:16,582
Where's he going now?

353
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:22,999
Franz?

354
00:43:23,749 --> 00:43:25,249
Goodbye!

355
00:43:25,874 --> 00:43:27,124
Goodbye, my friends!

356
00:43:39,332 --> 00:43:40,373
Damn.

357
00:43:42,541 --> 00:43:45,499
If it was all over now,
you know what I'd do?

358
00:43:45,582 --> 00:43:47,332
There's no peace. It's not over.

359
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:48,416
But if it was.

360
00:43:49,124 --> 00:43:52,207
-Bloody hell, there'd be girls again.
-Yes, indeed.

361
00:43:53,124 --> 00:43:55,582
I wouldn't wear any trousers for a week.

362
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:58,832
I should smack your arses
for bringing that up.

363
00:43:58,916 --> 00:43:59,999
What about you, Paul?

364
00:44:01,499 --> 00:44:05,082
-No idea. Can't think of anything.
-I'd stay with the Prussians.

365
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:06,416
You're crazy, Tjaden.

366
00:44:07,082 --> 00:44:08,873
Have you ever dug peat?

367
00:44:08,957 --> 00:44:09,957
Try it one day.

368
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:12,082
Can't be worse than digging trenches.

369
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:15,582
Takes longer than digging trenches.
And you can't slack off either.

370
00:44:16,832 --> 00:44:19,582
In the army during peacetime,
you have no worries.

371
00:44:20,082 --> 00:44:22,540
Food's there every morning,
or you raise a stink.

372
00:44:23,249 --> 00:44:26,457
Then you've got your nice bed,
fresh sheets every week.

373
00:44:26,957 --> 00:44:27,790
And then...

374
00:44:29,499 --> 00:44:31,124
Then you make NCO.

375
00:44:32,082 --> 00:44:35,165
Imagine that. I'll be a police ranger.

376
00:44:35,249 --> 00:44:37,582
A cognac here, a pint there.

377
00:44:37,666 --> 00:44:40,249
Everyone wants to be friends
with a ranger. Everyone.

378
00:44:40,332 --> 00:44:41,998
There's just one catch, Tjaden.

379
00:44:43,374 --> 00:44:44,415
What's that?

380
00:44:44,999 --> 00:44:46,582
You'll never make NCO.

381
00:44:56,374 --> 00:44:58,415
You always ask such nonsense questions.

382
00:44:58,499 --> 00:45:00,040
It won't change anything.

383
00:45:16,332 --> 00:45:17,998
-Kat! Kat!
-Here!

384
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:19,123
-Kat!
-Here!

385
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:17,374
"My dumpling.”

386
00:46:18,249 --> 00:46:20,832
"You asked for a food parcel."

387
00:46:20,916 --> 00:46:23,832
"Four helpings of wurst
and lard are on their way...

388
00:46:26,166 --> 00:46:28,082
a few cakes,

389
00:46:29,207 --> 00:46:30,915
sauerkraut and bockwurst,

390
00:46:31,957 --> 00:46:32,790
and...

391
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:34,832
Hing...

392
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:37,166
Hingfong essence with sugar cubes,

393
00:46:38,666 --> 00:46:41,082
some eggs and a jar of plum jam."

394
00:46:41,916 --> 00:46:45,166
"Make it last because I don't want
to have to send more too soon."

395
00:46:45,874 --> 00:46:47,957
"Better not share it with your comrades."

396
00:46:49,457 --> 00:46:52,665
"My dear dumpling,
I have another question for you."

397
00:46:53,457 --> 00:46:55,415
"How much money have you saved so far?"

398
00:46:56,374 --> 00:46:58,249
"Can you maybe send some home?"

399
00:46:59,207 --> 00:47:02,040
"They say that the war will be over soon,

400
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:04,832
so it would be good
to have some left over."

401
00:47:05,999 --> 00:47:09,499
"Now you'll think,
listen to the old lady, how cheeky!"

402
00:47:10,374 --> 00:47:11,790
"But no of fence."

403
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:14,666
"You know me, I can't get enough."

404
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,624
"Give me an inch and I'll take a mile."

405
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:20,666
"So don't keel over on the home stretch."”

406
00:47:22,624 --> 00:47:25,999
"Karl Lemmer is already
in a field hospital in the East."

407
00:47:26,499 --> 00:47:30,332
"Something to do with his stomach.
He was hardly out there three weeks."

408
00:47:31,957 --> 00:47:34,415
"Can't you get off too,
with your rheumatism?"

409
00:47:35,832 --> 00:47:37,332
"You've done your bit."

410
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:42,249
If only she could see you now,
sitting here with your cigar!

411
00:47:46,457 --> 00:47:47,957
"On Sunday, I'm visiting..."

412
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:57,499
"On Sunday,
I'm visiting our little boy's grave."

413
00:48:00,707 --> 00:48:04,040
"I'm going to read to him.
He always liked that so much."

414
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:09,624
"Next year, we'll go together
and celebrate his tenth birthday."

415
00:48:12,124 --> 00:48:14,040
"Well, that's all I had to say."

416
00:48:14,582 --> 00:48:16,707
"Kisses from your wife."

417
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:18,499
"Goodbye."

418
00:48:24,957 --> 00:48:25,957
I didn't know.

419
00:48:35,374 --> 00:48:36,665
Oh, Paul.

420
00:48:41,916 --> 00:48:43,291
What's going to happen?

421
00:48:45,249 --> 00:48:46,582
Going home someday...

422
00:48:47,999 --> 00:48:49,582
Going back to our old lives.

423
00:48:51,082 --> 00:48:54,082
And all they'll want to know is
if we fought in close combat.

424
00:48:56,999 --> 00:49:00,249
We'll walk around like travellers
in a landscape from the past.

425
00:49:03,457 --> 00:49:04,623
I ask myself...

426
00:49:06,832 --> 00:49:10,165
if I wouldn't just rather
sit around a campfire with you

427
00:49:10,707 --> 00:49:11,957
and Tjaden and Kropp

428
00:49:13,249 --> 00:49:15,040
and Muller...

429
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:18,249
and eat fried potatoes.

430
00:49:19,166 --> 00:49:20,416
With the skin on.

431
00:49:27,082 --> 00:49:28,123
Yeah...

432
00:49:39,874 --> 00:49:40,832
I'm bored.

433
00:49:44,374 --> 00:49:46,082
How long until we get going again?

434
00:49:46,957 --> 00:49:48,665
How long until we get going again?

435
00:50:08,332 --> 00:50:09,165
Franz?

436
00:50:10,166 --> 00:50:10,999
Yeah?

437
00:50:12,457 --> 00:50:15,873
We have to leave at six tomorrow.
To look for some kids.

438
00:50:16,707 --> 00:50:17,707
What happened?

439
00:50:19,041 --> 00:50:20,624
They should have arrived today.

440
00:50:21,291 --> 00:50:22,499
An entire company.

441
00:50:27,249 --> 00:50:28,499
How was it?

442
00:50:32,416 --> 00:50:33,541
-Nice.
-Yeah?

443
00:50:34,499 --> 00:50:35,332
Yeah.

444
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:38,499
Here.

445
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:44,832
Smell.

446
00:50:57,374 --> 00:50:58,332
What's her name?

447
00:50:58,832 --> 00:50:59,832
Eloise.

448
00:51:02,707 --> 00:51:03,582
Eloise.

449
00:51:04,582 --> 00:51:07,248
Her skin was as white as milk.

450
00:51:10,332 --> 00:51:11,665
And her breasts...

451
00:51:13,249 --> 00:51:14,082
Hey.

452
00:51:15,124 --> 00:51:16,040
I want a turn.

453
00:51:18,707 --> 00:51:20,457
Albert.

454
00:51:20,541 --> 00:51:22,332
-Kropp. Let me have it.
-Here.

455
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:24,582
-Oh, my!
-Tjaden.

456
00:51:24,666 --> 00:51:27,541
A girl like that never has
dirty fingernails.

457
00:51:27,624 --> 00:51:30,207
-No.
-At most, a bit of sand from the beach.

458
00:51:30,791 --> 00:51:31,957
Tjaden.

459
00:51:32,041 --> 00:51:35,291
-Come on, give it to me.
-I'm sure she has a bath twice a day.

460
00:51:37,291 --> 00:51:38,249
Tjaden.

461
00:51:38,957 --> 00:51:41,165
Please. It's mine.

462
00:51:41,749 --> 00:51:43,957
-Tjaden!
-No, it's mine now.

463
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:47,291
That was one hell of a blast.

464
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:49,416
Trench mortar.

465
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:52,582
It blasted him right out of his uniform.

466
00:52:58,124 --> 00:53:00,249
Is he one of those we're looking for?

467
00:53:00,332 --> 00:53:02,582
No, they've only been missing
since yesterday.

468
00:53:03,582 --> 00:53:04,873
He's been up there a while.

469
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:07,165
Not funny.

470
00:53:07,957 --> 00:53:09,457
Don't start getting soft, men.

471
00:53:10,082 --> 00:53:13,040
-How many are we looking for?
-Sixty young recruits.

472
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:23,916
Turnip bread for breakfast.
Turnip bread for lunch.

473
00:53:23,999 --> 00:53:26,582
Turnip bread all the time.
I've had enough.

474
00:53:27,166 --> 00:53:30,041
Tell me when you've found them.
I'm not taking another step.

475
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:31,749
Gas.

476
00:53:35,082 --> 00:53:36,165
There was gas here.

477
00:54:18,749 --> 00:54:19,665
Yes.

478
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:56,791
Hello, madam.

479
00:55:00,291 --> 00:55:01,291
I'm Kropp.

480
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:06,707
And you?

481
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:20,082
Do you want to...

482
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:25,749
Do you want to come with me?

483
00:55:28,041 --> 00:55:28,916
Not a problem.

484
00:56:23,332 --> 00:56:24,165
Kat.

485
00:56:27,082 --> 00:56:27,915
Kat!

486
00:56:29,749 --> 00:56:30,582
Kat!

487
00:56:40,582 --> 00:56:41,582
Shit.

488
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:49,666
-Bloody kids.
-Yeah.

489
00:56:50,624 --> 00:56:52,915
They took their masks off too soon.

490
00:56:56,707 --> 00:56:58,373
Soon, Germany will be empty.

491
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:19,791
COMPIEGNE, FRANCE
8 NOVEMBER 1918

492
00:58:21,374 --> 00:58:22,249
Sir.

493
00:58:24,707 --> 00:58:26,498
Well, Brixdorf, what's the latest?

494
00:58:26,582 --> 00:58:28,415
The French are putting the pressure on.

495
00:58:28,499 --> 00:58:31,207
Early this morning,
our scouts intercepted orders

496
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:33,332
summoning entire divisions to Latierre.

497
00:58:33,416 --> 00:58:36,082
A fleet of tanks
is still stuck in Fernancourt.

498
00:58:36,166 --> 00:58:37,999
We need to prepare for an attack.

499
00:58:39,416 --> 00:58:42,207
The Social Democrats will be
the end of mankind, Brixdorf.

500
00:58:44,832 --> 00:58:45,873
Sir?

501
00:58:50,374 --> 00:58:53,499
I just put the German delegation
on the train to Compiegne

502
00:58:53,582 --> 00:58:55,082
to negotiate a ceasefire.

503
00:59:02,041 --> 00:59:05,374
These people, Brixdorf,
are selling off our fatherland.

504
00:59:06,916 --> 00:59:08,666
My order is war.

505
00:59:09,749 --> 00:59:13,332
And as long as that's the case,
I'll fight tooth and nail.

506
00:59:15,541 --> 00:59:17,999
We have to hold firm
and wait for fresh troops.

507
00:59:18,082 --> 00:59:20,915
New recruits are due in a few months.

508
00:59:22,124 --> 00:59:26,499
The French are trying
to force their shitty terms on us.

509
00:59:29,207 --> 00:59:30,957
I will not surrender.

510
00:59:33,832 --> 00:59:36,790
We have to strike now with all our might.

511
00:59:42,041 --> 00:59:42,916
Sir.

512
01:00:05,499 --> 01:00:06,665
For our part,

513
01:00:08,124 --> 01:00:09,582
I have to insist...

514
01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:12,291
we have to insist...

515
01:00:13,499 --> 01:00:14,874
For God's sake!

516
01:00:15,457 --> 01:00:16,332
Shit.

517
01:00:49,457 --> 01:00:50,290
Sir!

518
01:01:00,457 --> 01:01:02,123
Soldiers, pack your bags,

519
01:01:02,207 --> 01:01:04,832
roll up your bedding
and wash your mess Kits.

520
01:01:05,374 --> 01:01:08,540
The entire regiment
is being sent to the front line.

521
01:01:08,624 --> 01:01:10,874
We're taking anyone
who can stand on two legs.

522
01:01:12,749 --> 01:01:14,832
Line up, damn it!

523
01:01:15,374 --> 01:01:18,665
You think the French will wait
for you to comb your pubes?

524
01:01:18,749 --> 01:01:19,874
Here we go again.

525
01:01:19,957 --> 01:01:21,665
-Move it!
-Where to?

526
01:01:21,749 --> 01:01:23,040
Where to?

527
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:24,541
Into battle.

528
01:02:59,666 --> 01:03:01,707
Monsieur le Marechal is expecting you.

529
01:04:09,374 --> 01:04:10,582
I'll be back soon.

530
01:04:26,082 --> 01:04:27,082
Jealous?

531
01:04:44,874 --> 01:04:46,540
I stand before you

532
01:04:47,124 --> 01:04:50,624
in the hope that you will take
our presence as an opportunity

533
01:04:51,124 --> 01:04:53,374
to suspend all hostilities.

534
01:04:55,207 --> 01:04:56,832
In the name of humanity,

535
01:04:57,624 --> 01:05:00,374
I ask you to agree
to an immediate ceasefire

536
01:05:00,457 --> 01:05:02,957
for the duration of our negotiations

537
01:05:03,749 --> 01:05:06,957
in order to spare our nations
any unnecessary losses.

538
01:05:09,166 --> 01:05:12,416
Matthias Erzberger,
head of the German delegation.

539
01:05:26,749 --> 01:05:29,665
Marshal Foch asks
what brings us gentlemen to him.

540
01:05:33,624 --> 01:05:35,582
We look forward to your suggestions

541
01:05:36,457 --> 01:05:40,957
for bringing about a permanent ceasefire
at sea, on land and in the air.

542
01:05:46,416 --> 01:05:48,666
I don't have any suggestions for you.

543
01:05:51,707 --> 01:05:52,790
What does he mean?

544
01:05:53,624 --> 01:05:56,540
I think he might not like
how you phrased it.

545
01:05:58,332 --> 01:05:59,207
Yes.

546
01:05:59,791 --> 01:06:01,082
Okay, then...

547
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:05,624
Monsieur le Maréchal,

548
01:06:05,707 --> 01:06:09,582
if you please,
we would like to know the conditions...

549
01:06:18,416 --> 01:06:20,624
He wants you to formally ask for it.

550
01:06:28,124 --> 01:06:29,374
Monsieur le Maréchal,

551
01:06:31,666 --> 01:06:33,791
I'm asking you for an armistice.

552
01:06:35,416 --> 01:06:37,957
We're asking for an armistice.

553
01:06:46,207 --> 01:06:49,832
You have 72 hours to accept
our conditions. They are non-negotiable.

554
01:06:49,916 --> 01:06:52,999
-72 hours?
-The war will continue until you sign.

555
01:06:53,082 --> 01:06:54,332
Monsieur le Maréchal,

556
01:06:54,832 --> 01:06:58,123
in the name of God,
don't let 72 hours go by.

557
01:06:59,624 --> 01:07:01,499
People are dying out there.

558
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:08,957
Sign then.

559
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:25,749
Understood.

560
01:07:45,291 --> 01:07:46,457
Soldiers, march.

561
01:07:49,749 --> 01:07:50,749
Soldiers, march.

562
01:07:52,332 --> 01:07:53,332
March, soldiers.

563
01:07:56,207 --> 01:07:57,207
Soldiers, march.

564
01:07:58,374 --> 01:07:59,707
Let's go. Out of here!

565
01:08:01,082 --> 01:08:02,040
March, soldiers.

566
01:08:03,832 --> 01:08:04,665
March.

567
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:06,790
Soldiers, march.

568
01:08:08,332 --> 01:08:09,957
March, soldiers. Out of here!

569
01:08:22,707 --> 01:08:24,748
Charge!

570
01:08:24,832 --> 01:08:26,873
-Faster!
-Hooray!

571
01:08:26,957 --> 01:08:29,373
-Faster!
-Hooray!

572
01:08:30,124 --> 01:08:31,499
Onwards, men!

573
01:08:33,082 --> 01:08:34,082
Charge!

574
01:08:38,291 --> 01:08:40,624
Hooray!

575
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:43,374
Keep ranks!

576
01:08:44,082 --> 01:08:44,915
Keep going!

577
01:09:00,207 --> 01:09:01,998
Go, go, go!

578
01:10:30,499 --> 01:10:32,999
Let's go, Paul. Come on. Paul!

579
01:12:05,374 --> 01:12:06,249
Get out!

580
01:12:48,916 --> 01:12:50,291
Open fire!

581
01:12:51,082 --> 01:12:52,332
Open fire!

582
01:13:34,541 --> 01:13:36,166
Get down!

583
01:13:36,249 --> 01:13:37,374
Get down!

584
01:13:38,207 --> 01:13:39,457
Take cover!

585
01:13:57,707 --> 01:13:59,707
Get out of here! Get out!

586
01:14:02,291 --> 01:14:04,832
Stay where you are and close ranks!

587
01:14:27,457 --> 01:14:28,707
Hand grenades!

588
01:14:28,791 --> 01:14:31,707
Aim for the tracks when they're above us.

589
01:14:56,749 --> 01:14:58,499
Let's go, men! Go! Franz!

590
01:14:58,582 --> 01:14:59,415
Franz!

591
01:14:59,916 --> 01:15:01,374
Follow me!

592
01:15:10,666 --> 01:15:11,499
Franz!

593
01:15:11,582 --> 01:15:13,082
Come on! Follow me!

594
01:15:15,207 --> 01:15:16,082
Franz!

595
01:15:16,166 --> 01:15:17,291
Go! Come on!

596
01:15:17,374 --> 01:15:18,290
Paul!

597
01:15:34,082 --> 01:15:34,915
Charge!

598
01:16:02,416 --> 01:16:03,582
Paul.

599
01:16:03,666 --> 01:16:04,707
Paul!

600
01:16:20,749 --> 01:16:21,957
Open fire!

601
01:16:35,999 --> 01:16:36,999
Retreat!

602
01:16:37,832 --> 01:16:38,915
Retreat!

603
01:17:54,332 --> 01:17:57,123
No, don't shoot! No!

604
01:17:57,207 --> 01:17:58,582
No!

605
01:17:58,666 --> 01:18:00,124
No!

606
01:18:00,791 --> 01:18:03,249
Don't! Don't shoot!

607
01:18:03,332 --> 01:18:04,248
Albert.

608
01:18:12,582 --> 01:18:14,707
-Albert.
-Come on!

609
01:18:14,791 --> 01:18:15,916
Come on!

610
01:18:21,957 --> 01:18:22,873
Keep going!

611
01:18:49,166 --> 01:18:50,332
Where's Franz?

612
01:18:50,416 --> 01:18:51,666
I've lost Franz!

613
01:18:59,249 --> 01:19:02,165
Katczinsky!
Secure the machine gun and retreat!

614
01:19:02,249 --> 01:19:05,582
We'll regroup in Eguisac,
two kilometres northeast of here.

615
01:19:07,791 --> 01:19:10,499
I am missing my comrades, Sergeant!

616
01:19:10,582 --> 01:19:12,832
And I miss my mother, damn it!

617
01:19:12,916 --> 01:19:15,249
Grenades! Ammunition! Let's go!

618
01:19:17,541 --> 01:19:18,541
Paul, come on!

619
01:19:46,791 --> 01:19:49,374
This isn't a negotiation.
This is a diktat.

620
01:19:49,457 --> 01:19:52,707
Maybe we should return to Spa
to consult with the general staff.

621
01:19:52,791 --> 01:19:54,166
And what good will that do?

622
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:56,666
Even if we end up losing,

623
01:19:57,249 --> 01:19:59,624
we won't be any worse off
than with this surrender.

624
01:19:59,707 --> 01:20:01,665
Besides a few hundred thousand
more deaths.

625
01:20:01,749 --> 01:20:05,874
Alsace-Lorraine, occupation of the Rhine,
artillery, locomotives, trains.

626
01:20:05,957 --> 01:20:08,248
This is total capitulation!

627
01:20:08,332 --> 01:20:12,457
250,000 Americans are landing
in Europe every month.

628
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:15,957
Marne, Cantigny, Cambrai, all lost.

629
01:20:17,166 --> 01:20:20,207
The only thing separating us
from a ceasefire is false pride.

630
01:20:20,832 --> 01:20:24,290
It's time to deal with the mess
you and your generals have left us.

631
01:20:24,374 --> 01:20:26,582
But if you'd rather leave now, go ahead.

632
01:20:27,082 --> 01:20:28,207
We're staying here.

633
01:20:34,707 --> 01:20:35,707
It's winter.

634
01:20:36,999 --> 01:20:40,124
Without trains and provisions,
the Bolsheviks will overrun us.

635
01:20:40,874 --> 01:20:42,874
The men will starve on the way home,

636
01:20:42,957 --> 01:20:45,373
instead of dying with honour
on the battlefield.

637
01:20:46,582 --> 01:20:47,415
Honour?

638
01:20:49,457 --> 01:20:52,123
My son was killed in this war.
Where's his honour?

639
01:20:58,582 --> 01:20:59,623
Von Helldorf.

640
01:21:00,707 --> 01:21:04,873
Get a few copies of the Allied demands
and telegraph them to headquarters.

641
01:21:05,457 --> 01:21:06,915
Inform the government.

642
01:21:10,291 --> 01:21:12,624
We have 72 hours, gentlemen,

643
01:21:12,707 --> 01:21:16,040
and every minute we waste talking here,
another soldier dies.

644
01:21:17,207 --> 01:21:20,748
Let's find mercy where we can,
but for God's sake,

645
01:21:21,541 --> 01:21:23,291
let's end this war.

646
01:22:07,916 --> 01:22:10,249
Retreat!

647
01:22:14,749 --> 01:22:17,749
They're retreating! Barrage!

648
01:22:17,832 --> 01:22:19,665
Barrage!

649
01:23:19,082 --> 01:23:20,082
Be quiet!

650
01:24:04,541 --> 01:24:05,541
Shut up.

651
01:24:08,749 --> 01:24:09,749
Shut up!

652
01:26:05,332 --> 01:26:06,707
No!

653
01:26:07,207 --> 01:26:08,123
Comrade.

654
01:26:09,249 --> 01:26:11,040
Comrade.

655
01:26:15,249 --> 01:26:16,249
Comrade.

656
01:27:13,624 --> 01:27:14,540
I'm sorry.

657
01:27:15,999 --> 01:27:16,999
I'm sorry.

658
01:27:18,082 --> 01:27:20,207
I'm so sorry.

659
01:28:15,332 --> 01:28:16,165
House...

660
01:28:18,249 --> 01:28:19,165
Your wife...

661
01:28:20,624 --> 01:28:22,124
I promise.

662
01:28:24,082 --> 01:28:25,040
I pro...

663
01:30:12,416 --> 01:30:14,166
When were you born, Brixdorf?

664
01:30:16,332 --> 01:30:17,915
1877, in June.

665
01:30:20,207 --> 01:30:21,582
A summer child.

666
01:30:22,791 --> 01:30:23,791
Yes.

667
01:30:26,874 --> 01:30:28,165
What does your father do?

668
01:30:30,499 --> 01:30:32,624
My family owns a manufactory in Holstein.

669
01:30:34,666 --> 01:30:35,541
What kind?

670
01:30:37,541 --> 01:30:39,124
Riding saddles, sir.

671
01:30:39,207 --> 01:30:40,290
Riding saddles.

672
01:30:41,999 --> 01:30:43,249
They'll always sell.

673
01:30:44,332 --> 01:30:45,457
Your future is safe.

674
01:30:47,124 --> 01:30:48,207
I'm very lucky.

675
01:30:50,832 --> 01:30:51,665
Well?

676
01:30:52,666 --> 01:30:54,207
Looking forward to going home?

677
01:30:55,499 --> 01:30:58,415
-When we're not needed here any more?
-Yes.

678
01:30:59,832 --> 01:31:02,040
There's a job waiting for me
after the war.

679
01:31:03,832 --> 01:31:05,248
I'll take over the business.

680
01:31:06,957 --> 01:31:07,957
Congratulations.

681
01:31:08,582 --> 01:31:09,915
What about you?

682
01:31:11,957 --> 01:31:13,165
I'm a soldier.

683
01:31:14,832 --> 01:31:17,040
My father was an officer in this regiment.

684
01:31:18,374 --> 01:31:20,749
He fought in three wars under Bismarck.

685
01:31:21,249 --> 01:31:22,665
He won all three.

686
01:31:23,291 --> 01:31:25,582
In 1871, he marched on Paris.

687
01:31:26,332 --> 01:31:28,040
He came home a hero.

688
01:31:32,082 --> 01:31:34,290
I was born too late, Brixdorf.

689
01:31:35,791 --> 01:31:37,624
Half a century without war.

690
01:31:39,124 --> 01:31:41,290
What is a soldier without war?

691
01:31:47,874 --> 01:31:49,915
Were you close to your father?

692
01:31:50,999 --> 01:31:52,415
As a child, perhaps.

693
01:31:54,541 --> 01:31:56,791
A man is born alone,

694
01:31:57,457 --> 01:31:58,457
he lives alone,

695
01:31:59,666 --> 01:32:00,957
and he dies alone.

696
01:32:31,166 --> 01:32:32,916
THE KAISER HAS ABDICATED

697
01:32:32,999 --> 01:32:33,999
Come in.

698
01:32:35,416 --> 01:32:37,041
Von Helldorf, what is it?

699
01:32:37,624 --> 01:32:38,499
Hindenburg.

700
01:32:38,582 --> 01:32:39,790
Open it then.

701
01:32:46,416 --> 01:32:47,624
He urges us to sign.

702
01:32:50,916 --> 01:32:52,041
It's over!

703
01:33:03,916 --> 01:33:06,707
"...the sin of the world, have mercy on us."

704
01:33:06,791 --> 01:33:10,624
"Lamb of God,
you take away the sin of the world..."

705
01:33:16,582 --> 01:33:18,665
Knock on the monastery door,

706
01:33:18,749 --> 01:33:21,415
and you'll find only
thieves and scoundrels.

707
01:33:21,499 --> 01:33:24,790
It's over. The fat pigs have realised.

708
01:33:24,874 --> 01:33:28,665
They're negotiating at last.
We're going home soon, soldier!

709
01:33:33,499 --> 01:33:34,832
Where's the infirmary?

710
01:33:43,707 --> 01:33:45,665
-No!
-Just chloroform the man!

711
01:34:00,499 --> 01:34:01,332
Baumer.

712
01:34:02,791 --> 01:34:03,624
Baumer.

713
01:34:07,582 --> 01:34:08,498
Baumer.

714
01:34:09,916 --> 01:34:12,041
-Tjaden.
-Baumer.

715
01:34:13,874 --> 01:34:16,082
What happened? Where did you get hit?

716
01:34:16,582 --> 01:34:17,623
Above the knee.

717
01:34:18,749 --> 01:34:19,665
I think.

718
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:21,791
I can't feel anything.

719
01:34:22,707 --> 01:34:24,498
How far above the knee was I shot?

720
01:34:25,457 --> 01:34:27,123
I can't lift my head.

721
01:34:28,666 --> 01:34:30,291
Ten centimetres at least.

722
01:34:34,874 --> 01:34:36,957
-You're going home, Tjaden.
-You think so?

723
01:34:37,041 --> 01:34:38,041
Yes, of course.

724
01:34:42,832 --> 01:34:45,123
How can I be a ranger like this?

725
01:34:47,166 --> 01:34:48,332
For Christ's sake!

726
01:34:49,541 --> 01:34:50,749
You still can.

727
01:34:53,124 --> 01:34:54,249
You'll see.

728
01:34:54,957 --> 01:34:56,790
I won't let them amputate.

729
01:34:58,374 --> 01:35:00,207
I won't live as a cripple.

730
01:35:00,916 --> 01:35:02,041
You won't have to.

731
01:35:02,124 --> 01:35:04,165
They've patched up much worse here.

732
01:35:08,957 --> 01:35:10,290
Oh, Paul.

733
01:35:11,041 --> 01:35:12,666
I'm supposed to give you something.

734
01:35:44,332 --> 01:35:45,332
Is he dead?

735
01:35:51,041 --> 01:35:52,666
You have to be brave now.

736
01:35:54,457 --> 01:35:55,623
You're alive.

737
01:35:55,707 --> 01:35:57,498
You have to be grateful for that.

738
01:35:57,582 --> 01:35:58,540
For us.

739
01:35:59,041 --> 01:36:00,791
For those who didn't make it.

740
01:36:00,874 --> 01:36:01,749
Be quiet.

741
01:36:01,832 --> 01:36:04,332
Listen, you can't say that. Not you.

742
01:36:56,957 --> 01:36:58,498
That would really suit you.

743
01:36:58,582 --> 01:36:59,790
Not until everyone's here...

744
01:36:59,874 --> 01:37:02,082
They're in the infirmary or mass graves.

745
01:37:02,166 --> 01:37:04,957
-Dish it up. We can smell it's done.
-I can't.

746
01:37:05,041 --> 01:37:06,499
Why not, you vagrant?

747
01:37:06,582 --> 01:37:10,415
I've cooked for 150.
| can't serve 80 men food for 150!

748
01:37:10,499 --> 01:37:12,915
Are you thick as pig shit?

749
01:37:13,457 --> 01:37:16,082
You've received provisions
for the second company.

750
01:37:16,166 --> 01:37:18,791
-We're the second company!
-Yes!

751
01:37:18,874 --> 01:37:20,957
So dish it out, full stop!

752
01:37:21,541 --> 01:37:22,374
Kat!

753
01:37:22,957 --> 01:37:23,998
-Kat!
-Paul!

754
01:37:24,082 --> 01:37:24,915
Kat!

755
01:37:25,707 --> 01:37:26,540
Paul!

756
01:37:27,166 --> 01:37:28,832
-Paul!
-Kat, you're alive!

757
01:37:29,707 --> 01:37:30,665
You're alive!

758
01:37:30,749 --> 01:37:32,040
Paul!

759
01:37:39,957 --> 01:37:40,998
Tjaden got hit.

760
01:37:41,499 --> 01:37:42,582
He's in the church.

761
01:37:44,082 --> 01:37:45,790
He'll get a double helping from us.

762
01:37:45,874 --> 01:37:46,874
-Yes.
-Come on.

763
01:37:47,707 --> 01:37:48,540
Careful.

764
01:37:51,249 --> 01:37:52,249
And one here too.

765
01:37:55,499 --> 01:37:57,707
Bloody hell, I thought you were dead.

766
01:37:59,541 --> 01:38:01,207
We'll all die at some point.

767
01:38:02,041 --> 01:38:03,666
But not on the home stretch.

768
01:38:06,124 --> 01:38:08,207
If you die before me, I'll kill you.

769
01:38:13,916 --> 01:38:14,916
Tjaden.

770
01:38:16,791 --> 01:38:17,791
Tjaden.

771
01:38:23,874 --> 01:38:24,874
Kat?

772
01:38:29,082 --> 01:38:30,082
Kat.

773
01:38:31,082 --> 01:38:32,498
We brought you some soup.

774
01:38:32,582 --> 01:38:34,290
Did you bring some cutlery?

775
01:38:34,874 --> 01:38:36,540
Yes, we brought some cutlery too.

776
01:38:41,499 --> 01:38:42,915
Enjoy it.

777
01:39:06,582 --> 01:39:09,332
No! Tjaden, stop! Stop it, Tjaden!

778
01:39:09,832 --> 01:39:11,165
Tjaden, no!

779
01:39:15,416 --> 01:39:16,666
We need help here!

780
01:39:17,374 --> 01:39:18,582
Why did you do that?

781
01:39:19,499 --> 01:39:20,332
Why?

782
01:39:20,916 --> 01:39:22,957
It's over, boys, it's over.

783
01:39:23,041 --> 01:39:24,416
He's bleeding out!

784
01:39:25,832 --> 01:39:26,665
Quiet.

785
01:39:29,374 --> 01:39:30,207
Tjaden.

786
01:39:35,916 --> 01:39:36,749
Tjaden.

787
01:41:10,957 --> 01:41:11,790
What is it?

788
01:41:14,124 --> 01:41:15,124
I've lost something.

789
01:41:19,957 --> 01:41:21,290
Kat, can you speak French?

790
01:41:28,707 --> 01:41:30,540
My mother wanted me to learn French.

791
01:41:35,041 --> 01:41:36,041
And piano.

792
01:41:38,541 --> 01:41:40,499
She didn't want me to go to war.

793
01:41:41,541 --> 01:41:44,832
"It's not for you," she always said.
"You'll be dead in no time."

794
01:41:47,082 --> 01:41:48,915
I wanted to show them I could do it.

795
01:41:49,874 --> 01:41:51,207
How does that help us now?

796
01:41:54,707 --> 01:41:56,582
"In a few weeks, we'll be in Paris."

797
01:41:59,207 --> 01:42:02,373
I can't discard two years
of hand grenades like a pair of socks.

798
01:42:02,457 --> 01:42:05,123
-Paul...
-We'll never get rid of the stench.

799
01:42:05,207 --> 01:42:07,123
-Enough.
-Ludwig's dead, Franz, Albert...

800
01:42:07,207 --> 01:42:08,540
What's it to us now?

801
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:12,707
At least they're at peace. We're alive.

802
01:42:20,874 --> 01:42:22,540
All of this is like a fever.

803
01:42:23,291 --> 01:42:25,707
No one actually wants it,
but suddenly it's here.

804
01:42:26,624 --> 01:42:28,832
We didn't want it,
the others didn't want it.

805
01:42:28,916 --> 01:42:31,832
And yet, here we are.
And yet, half the world is here.

806
01:42:31,916 --> 01:42:33,082
And God watches on

807
01:42:34,791 --> 01:42:36,166
as we slaughter each other.

808
01:42:40,624 --> 01:42:41,624
Well...

809
01:42:45,332 --> 01:42:46,332
But what do I know?

810
01:42:46,957 --> 01:42:47,957
I know nothing.

811
01:42:48,749 --> 01:42:50,415
I'm a pair of boots with a rifle.

812
01:42:52,624 --> 01:42:54,082
Get some sleep. We got lucky.

813
01:42:54,874 --> 01:42:55,707
Yes.

814
01:43:13,832 --> 01:43:14,665
Kat?

815
01:43:18,832 --> 01:43:20,332
What did your son die of?

816
01:43:25,749 --> 01:43:26,957
Smallpox.

817
01:43:34,999 --> 01:43:36,540
I'm afraid of what's to come.

818
01:43:44,166 --> 01:43:45,166
Don't be.

819
01:44:17,207 --> 01:44:18,040
Henri.

820
01:44:21,707 --> 01:44:22,623
Taste it.

821
01:44:26,832 --> 01:44:27,832
Are they fresh?

822
01:44:30,916 --> 01:44:32,874
I'm sorry, sir, but I don't think so.

823
01:44:57,207 --> 01:44:58,540
Monsieur le Maréchal.

824
01:45:05,874 --> 01:45:07,207
I'm listening.

825
01:45:07,291 --> 01:45:09,041
The Kaiser has abdicated.

826
01:45:09,124 --> 01:45:13,624
Soldiers are refusing to obey orders.
Deserters are roaming the countryside.

827
01:45:13,749 --> 01:45:18,249
The new government will do its utmost
to fulfil the duties imposed on it,

828
01:45:18,916 --> 01:45:23,291
but the population,
through no fault of its own,

829
01:45:23,374 --> 01:45:25,749
risks descending into famine and anarchy.

830
01:45:25,832 --> 01:45:29,040
This is a disease of the defeated,
not of the victorious.

831
01:45:29,124 --> 01:45:32,207
I don't fear it. I reject any compromise.

832
01:45:33,957 --> 01:45:35,748
Monsieur le Marechal, please.

833
01:45:37,207 --> 01:45:40,498
Be fair to your enemy,
otherwise he will hate this peace.

834
01:45:40,582 --> 01:45:41,582
Fair?

835
01:45:44,874 --> 01:45:46,874
You speak of fairness?

836
01:46:00,624 --> 01:46:01,749
Sign it.

837
01:47:06,457 --> 01:47:08,707
Let the minutes record

838
01:47:08,791 --> 01:47:12,957
that the armistice
will take effect in six hours

839
01:47:13,041 --> 01:47:16,791
at the 11th hour
on the 11th day of the 11th month.

840
01:47:19,249 --> 01:47:20,082
Very good.

841
01:47:21,249 --> 01:47:22,415
The war is over.

842
01:47:36,707 --> 01:47:37,915
What will you do now?

843
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:41,999
What do you see here, Brixdorf?

844
01:47:44,249 --> 01:47:46,040
The plains of Latierre, sir.

845
01:47:46,124 --> 01:47:46,999
Eguisac.

846
01:47:47,999 --> 01:47:49,165
I see them too.

847
01:47:50,457 --> 01:47:53,040
And German soldiers
running away like rabbits.

848
01:47:55,041 --> 01:47:57,332
The French are farting
into our posts in Latierre,

849
01:47:57,416 --> 01:47:59,957
and out there is a train
full of horse fuckers,

850
01:48:00,041 --> 01:48:01,499
selling off our homeland.

851
01:48:05,541 --> 01:48:10,041
Withdraw the recruits from all posts.
Have them assemble in the courtyard.

852
01:48:10,749 --> 01:48:13,040
We're going to sort out this shitty mess!

853
01:48:24,582 --> 01:48:27,665
Any communication with the enemy
remains prohibited.

854
01:48:28,541 --> 01:48:33,041
Firstly, hostilities
on the entire front will cease today,

855
01:48:33,499 --> 01:48:36,332
11th November,
at 11 o'clock in the morning.

856
01:48:36,999 --> 01:48:41,499
Secondly, troops will not cross the lines
held on this day, at this hour.

857
01:48:44,624 --> 01:48:46,499
The lines will be accurately marked...

858
01:48:49,499 --> 01:48:50,499
What time is it?

859
01:48:56,499 --> 01:48:58,374
-Why aren't you sleeping?
-Listen.

860
01:49:01,999 --> 01:49:03,124
It's so quiet here.

861
01:49:05,707 --> 01:49:06,998
I think I've gone deaf.

862
01:49:13,416 --> 01:49:14,707
They've signed, Paul.

863
01:49:19,541 --> 01:49:20,999
The war's over.

864
01:49:22,541 --> 01:49:23,749
It's over.

865
01:49:29,249 --> 01:49:30,249
Are you hungry?

866
01:49:31,457 --> 01:49:32,457
I'm hungry.

867
01:49:37,457 --> 01:49:38,790
Where are you going?

868
01:49:38,874 --> 01:49:40,790
Come on, before the bastard wakes up.

869
01:49:43,124 --> 01:49:45,874
-What are you doing for Christmas, Paul?
- I don't know.

870
01:49:46,832 --> 01:49:47,915
I'm roasting a goose.

871
01:49:48,624 --> 01:49:50,124
With red cabbage, potatoes.

872
01:49:50,207 --> 01:49:52,915
Then I'll light all the candles
and kiss my wife.

873
01:49:52,999 --> 01:49:55,207
My God, Paul. My wife, she's beautiful.

874
01:49:56,124 --> 01:49:57,040
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

875
01:49:57,124 --> 01:49:59,290
-What does she look like?
-Well...

876
01:49:59,999 --> 01:50:02,082
Long, dark, curly hair.

877
01:50:02,832 --> 01:50:04,832
And she's round and strong.

878
01:50:05,374 --> 01:50:06,374
Yeah?

879
01:50:08,582 --> 01:50:09,707
Christmas.

880
01:50:10,374 --> 01:50:11,665
It's all so far away.

881
01:50:12,249 --> 01:50:14,249
But it isn't. It's very soon.

882
01:50:17,999 --> 01:50:20,207
We want another child. Children, Paul.

883
01:50:21,166 --> 01:50:23,916
Because what's Christmas without children?
It's nothing.

884
01:50:27,207 --> 01:50:28,207
You know, once...

885
01:50:28,916 --> 01:50:30,582
Once we're back home, then...

886
01:50:31,291 --> 01:50:32,957
-Yeah?
-We'll do something big.

887
01:50:33,832 --> 01:50:35,373
The two of us together, okay?

888
01:50:35,874 --> 01:50:36,707
Well...

889
01:50:38,791 --> 01:50:39,624
What?

890
01:50:40,457 --> 01:50:43,290
I'm a cobbler, Paul. I repair shoes.

891
01:50:43,374 --> 01:50:46,957
Yeah? You can read, write.
You have your school diplomas.

892
01:50:48,124 --> 01:50:49,457
Didn't do me any good.

893
01:50:50,541 --> 01:50:51,749
What are we going to do?

894
01:50:52,332 --> 01:50:53,915
Nail soles on shoes together?

895
01:50:54,832 --> 01:50:56,290
Are you trying to insult me?

896
01:50:57,207 --> 01:50:59,165
I can't even read a letter from my wife.

897
01:51:00,249 --> 01:51:01,624
Go to college, Paul.

898
01:51:02,582 --> 01:51:04,082
Or I'll shoot you right here.

899
01:51:06,374 --> 01:51:07,915
My trousers are falling down.

900
01:51:10,332 --> 01:51:11,457
My trousers are loose.

901
01:51:14,124 --> 01:51:15,790
You'll just have to eat a little.

902
01:51:17,124 --> 01:51:19,499
Soon we'll be home,
then we can eat what we want.

903
01:51:20,499 --> 01:51:21,582
Whatever we want.

904
01:51:46,416 --> 01:51:47,416
It's your turn.

905
01:51:48,249 --> 01:51:50,124
If the farmer catches me again,

906
01:51:50,207 --> 01:51:51,540
he'll shoot me.

907
01:51:56,582 --> 01:51:58,248
Watch out for the damn dog.

908
01:51:58,332 --> 01:51:59,165
Yeah.

909
01:53:13,207 --> 01:53:14,040
Look.

910
01:53:17,207 --> 01:53:18,540
It's really good.

911
01:53:21,916 --> 01:53:22,749
Want some?

912
01:53:25,332 --> 01:53:26,207
Shit.

913
01:54:17,291 --> 01:54:18,124
Hey!

914
01:54:19,166 --> 01:54:20,207
Stop!

915
01:54:29,291 --> 01:54:31,791
Kat! Run!

916
01:54:34,249 --> 01:54:35,249
Bastard!

917
01:54:40,999 --> 01:54:41,874
Damn.

918
01:55:02,041 --> 01:55:03,249
Oh, crap.

919
01:55:03,749 --> 01:55:04,957
Look at this.

920
01:55:05,041 --> 01:55:06,041
What is it?

921
01:55:06,124 --> 01:55:08,082
- I got lucky.
-He hit the eggs?

922
01:55:09,957 --> 01:55:11,373
-Press on it.
-Okay.

923
01:55:15,999 --> 01:55:17,457
Come on, get it all in there.

924
01:55:19,041 --> 01:55:19,916
All of it.

925
01:55:22,916 --> 01:55:23,999
We can fry them.

926
01:55:24,666 --> 01:55:27,416
Nonsense. We'll eat them right now.
Like this is fine too.

927
01:55:46,374 --> 01:55:47,957
Doesn't get better than that.

928
01:55:49,207 --> 01:55:50,123
I'll be right back.

929
01:57:27,499 --> 01:57:28,332
Kat?

930
01:57:33,416 --> 01:57:34,499
Kat?

931
01:57:38,957 --> 01:57:39,790
Kat!

932
01:57:41,999 --> 01:57:42,999
What happened?

933
01:57:43,916 --> 01:57:44,749
Let's go.

934
01:57:46,707 --> 01:57:49,540
-Who fired the shot?
-The little shit from the farm.

935
01:57:50,624 --> 01:57:51,832
The farmer's boy.

936
01:57:53,874 --> 01:57:54,790
Kat!

937
01:57:56,249 --> 01:57:57,207
What a mess.

938
01:58:05,291 --> 01:58:06,166
How big?

939
01:58:06,832 --> 01:58:08,998
Little finger. I'll get the bullet out.

940
01:58:09,082 --> 01:58:11,040
No, just give me a cigarette.

941
01:58:11,707 --> 01:58:13,457
Leave that to the medic.

942
01:58:32,332 --> 01:58:34,623
They stuck me
in a class of seven-year-olds.

943
01:58:36,082 --> 01:58:37,582
I had already started shaving.

944
01:58:39,457 --> 01:58:40,665
Find a word...

945
01:58:42,666 --> 01:58:44,207
that rhymes with trifle.

946
01:58:48,416 --> 01:58:50,582
Nothing rhymes with trifle. Nothing.

947
01:58:56,916 --> 01:58:58,582
For Christ's sake!

948
01:58:59,791 --> 01:59:02,082
Did it have to happen now, of all times?

949
01:59:05,916 --> 01:59:07,416
-We have to keep going.
-Yeah.

950
01:59:08,374 --> 01:59:09,374
Keep going.

951
01:59:14,749 --> 01:59:16,457
Okay? Kat?

952
01:59:18,332 --> 01:59:19,540
Rifle.

953
01:59:20,541 --> 01:59:22,166
Rifle rhymes with trifle.

954
01:59:32,582 --> 01:59:36,165
When we get home, you're going
to make me a new pair of boots.

955
01:59:36,249 --> 01:59:37,790
I'm walking my feet bloody.

956
01:59:52,291 --> 01:59:53,166
Stop!

957
01:59:56,624 --> 01:59:57,457
Stop!

958
01:59:59,332 --> 02:00:00,207
Stop!

959
02:00:00,874 --> 02:00:01,749
Stop!

960
02:00:03,416 --> 02:00:04,249
Stop!

961
02:00:52,291 --> 02:00:53,291
Medic!

962
02:00:55,916 --> 02:00:57,041
Medic!

963
02:01:25,832 --> 02:01:27,665
You could've saved yourself the trouble.

964
02:01:30,749 --> 02:01:32,165
He's dead.

965
02:01:37,166 --> 02:01:39,499
It's... It's just a small bullet wound.

966
02:01:40,166 --> 02:01:42,916
Yes, black blood. Straight into the liver.

967
02:01:43,499 --> 02:01:44,957
His organs are poisoned.

968
02:01:51,374 --> 02:01:52,415
Unconscious.

969
02:01:54,749 --> 02:01:55,790
He's dead.

970
02:01:56,457 --> 02:01:58,040
I know more about these things.

971
02:01:58,999 --> 02:02:00,999
That... That's impossible. I was...

972
02:02:01,541 --> 02:02:03,291
I was just talking to him.

973
02:02:03,374 --> 02:02:04,374
He's unconscious.

974
02:02:06,374 --> 02:02:07,374
He's unconscious.

975
02:02:14,791 --> 02:02:15,999
You see?

976
02:02:17,624 --> 02:02:18,749
He was just unlucky.

977
02:02:19,374 --> 02:02:20,374
So close to the end.

978
02:02:56,166 --> 02:02:59,791
Drink a cup of tea, sugar and coffee

979
02:02:59,874 --> 02:03:03,290
Drink a cup of tea, sugar and coffee

980
02:03:03,374 --> 02:03:07,082
And a glass of wine

981
02:03:07,166 --> 02:03:09,791
And a glass of wine

982
02:03:10,999 --> 02:03:14,749
Girl, I do love you...

983
02:03:44,541 --> 02:03:46,249
Come along, soldier!

984
02:03:46,332 --> 02:03:49,415
The General's sending us home!
We're going home!

985
02:03:50,082 --> 02:03:51,790
We're going home!

986
02:04:09,707 --> 02:04:12,082
Go on, keep going!

987
02:04:12,874 --> 02:04:13,999
Step it up a notch!

988
02:04:32,499 --> 02:04:34,207
Attention!

989
02:04:40,416 --> 02:04:41,374
Soldiers,

990
02:04:41,999 --> 02:04:44,124
we stand here as brothers

991
02:04:45,332 --> 02:04:48,915
in a world of enemies, forced to watch

992
02:04:48,999 --> 02:04:53,499
as German social democrats render
our beloved people defenceless

993
02:04:54,207 --> 02:04:57,832
by accepting a perfidious armistice.

994
02:04:59,207 --> 02:05:00,040
Comrades,

995
02:05:01,332 --> 02:05:03,123
you will be going home soon

996
02:05:03,207 --> 02:05:05,290
to parents, wives and children.

997
02:05:06,499 --> 02:05:07,582
The war is over.

998
02:05:08,374 --> 02:05:12,874
After years of sacrifice and suffering,
you can now look forward to your reward.

999
02:05:13,749 --> 02:05:18,124
The reward of admiration
for everything you've achieved here.

1000
02:05:19,416 --> 02:05:20,957
But, comrades,

1001
02:05:22,457 --> 02:05:25,248
do you want to be welcomed
as soldiers and heroes,

1002
02:05:27,291 --> 02:05:28,166
or as cowards

1003
02:05:28,249 --> 02:05:31,415
who chickened out
when it really came down to it?

1004
02:05:32,624 --> 02:05:33,499
Soldiers,

1005
02:05:34,499 --> 02:05:38,332
we're going to strike now
with all our rig our and might.

1006
02:05:38,957 --> 02:05:41,707
Latierre belongs in German hands.

1007
02:05:42,666 --> 02:05:45,332
We will seize the plains before 11 a.m.

1008
02:05:45,416 --> 02:05:48,957
and end this war with a victory!

1009
02:05:49,999 --> 02:05:54,499
Onwards with God who will be with us,
as He was with our fathers.

1010
02:05:56,666 --> 02:05:59,332
I'm not going back into battle. Not me!

1011
02:05:59,416 --> 02:06:00,416
Shut up!

1012
02:06:09,624 --> 02:06:10,457
Take aim!

1013
02:06:11,707 --> 02:06:13,165
-No!
-Fire!

1014
02:06:50,707 --> 02:06:52,665
Company, halt!

1015
02:06:57,457 --> 02:06:59,123
Order arms!

1016
02:06:59,666 --> 02:07:01,457
Fix bayonets!

1017
02:07:17,416 --> 02:07:18,416
What time?

1018
02:07:19,124 --> 02:07:20,332
Fifteen minutes to go.

1019
02:07:57,624 --> 02:07:58,707
Belonged to Lefevre.

1020
02:08:00,291 --> 02:08:02,707
Poor bastard. He saved it for the end.

1021
02:08:02,791 --> 02:08:05,082
-He won't need it any more.
-Thank you, sir.

1022
02:08:09,374 --> 02:08:11,040
Here's to you and to Lefevre.

1023
02:08:17,541 --> 02:08:18,541
Well, it's good.

1024
02:08:22,166 --> 02:08:23,291
The nightmare is over.

1025
02:09:23,374 --> 02:09:26,332
Enemy attack!

1026
02:09:26,416 --> 02:09:28,082
-In position!
-In position!

1027
02:09:31,166 --> 02:09:32,082
Fire!

1028
02:09:32,957 --> 02:09:34,165
Fire!

1029
02:09:41,832 --> 02:09:43,165
Fire!

1030
02:10:09,374 --> 02:10:10,749
Grenades!

1031
02:10:21,791 --> 02:10:22,957
Charge!

1032
02:11:19,207 --> 02:11:20,498
No, no! Please!

1033
02:11:25,957 --> 02:11:27,123
No! Don't! No!

1034
02:13:11,624 --> 02:13:13,332
Cease fire!

1035
02:13:13,416 --> 02:13:14,957
It's eleven o'clock!

1036
02:13:16,041 --> 02:13:19,791
Cease fire!

1037
02:13:20,291 --> 02:13:21,874
It's eleven o'clock!

1038
02:16:20,124 --> 02:16:21,499
Are you all right, soldier?

1039
02:16:22,874 --> 02:16:23,915
Yes.

1040
02:16:23,999 --> 02:16:24,915
Well, then...

1041
02:16:25,791 --> 02:16:27,041
Start collecting, please.

1042
02:19:48,541 --> 02:19:51,624
SHORTLY AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR
IN OCTOBER 1914,

1043
02:19:51,707 --> 02:19:54,957
THE WESTERN FRONT BECAME BOGGED DOWN
IN TRENCH WARFARE.

1044
02:19:56,624 --> 02:20:01,124
AT THE END OF THE WAR IN NOVEMBER 1918,
THE FRONT LINE HAD BARELY MOVED.

1045
02:20:04,416 --> 02:20:07,124
MORE THAN THREE MILLION SOLDIERS
DIED HERE,

1046
02:20:07,207 --> 02:20:10,790
OFTEN WHILE FIGHTING TO GAIN
ONLY A FEW HUNDRED METRES OF GROUND.

1047
02:20:12,541 --> 02:20:17,041
DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR,
ALMOST 17 MILLION PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES.

1048
02:20:20,749 --> 02:20:25,249
ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT

1049
02:26:51,374 --> 02:26:55,874
