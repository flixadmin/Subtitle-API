00:00:01,133 --> 00:00:02,883
<i>Time travel is real.</i>

2
00:00:02,908 --> 00:00:04,346
<i>And all of history is vulnerable</i>

3
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:06,475
<i>to the attack of rogue time travelers.</i>

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,199
<i>But one group travels throughout time</i>

5
00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:11,036
<i>to stop the spread of these
so-called Time Aberrations</i>

6
00:00:11,038 --> 00:00:12,921
<i>and erase their damage to history.</i>

7
00:00:12,953 --> 00:00:14,786
<i>A group of outcasts and misfits.</i>

8
00:00:14,788 --> 00:00:16,562
<i>These individuals aren't heroes,</i>

9
00:00:16,594 --> 00:00:19,173
<i>they're something else, they're Legends.</i>

10
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:22,389
<i>Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

11
00:00:22,414 --> 00:00:24,781
Heywood, Dr. Nate Heywood.
I'm a historian.

12
00:00:24,783 --> 00:00:27,417
I specialize in deductive
historical reconstruction.

13
00:00:27,419 --> 00:00:30,120
In layman's terms, I'm a time detective.

14
00:00:30,122 --> 00:00:31,822
Ingestible translator.

15
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:32,990
You'll be able to speak and understand

16
00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:34,391
any language spoken to you.

17
00:00:34,393 --> 00:00:36,727
You know how fragile
we historians can be.

18
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:38,195
I know my cuts and bruises.

19
00:00:38,197 --> 00:00:40,330
You're a hemophiliac.
You can bleed to death.

20
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,232
So your superpower is wearing the suit.

21
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:43,901
<i>Without that fancy suit,</i>

22
00:00:43,903 --> 00:00:45,469
you're nothing but a
self-righteous rich guy.

23
00:00:48,474 --> 00:00:49,973
Mr. Heywood's vitals are dropping.

24
00:00:49,975 --> 00:00:51,375
I think I can save him.

25
00:00:51,377 --> 00:00:53,710
<i>I did a little tinkering to the formula.</i>

26
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:56,647
Hello, Rex.

27
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:57,681
Rex!

28
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,317
- Time traveler.
- Rex!

29
00:01:10,061 --> 00:01:12,729
- So how's our patient?
- Still stable.

30
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:15,299
Gideon has him under sedation.

31
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:17,668
Any side effects from
the Nazi super-serum

32
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,069
you injected him with?

33
00:01:19,071 --> 00:01:20,938
No, but that may have a
little something to do

34
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,472
with the work I did altering the serum

35
00:01:22,474 --> 00:01:23,674
to remove the Nazi parts.

36
00:01:23,676 --> 00:01:25,375
Yes, it would be a tad inconvenient

37
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,411
to have a monster roaming the ship.

38
00:01:35,086 --> 00:01:37,087
Gideon, can you pilot for a little bit?

39
00:01:37,089 --> 00:01:38,755
I need a break.

40
00:02:07,785 --> 00:02:10,087
Where are all the knives?

41
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,925
Oh, there's one.

42
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:18,028
Look, if this is about me
taking all the mayonnaise,

43
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,830
you might be slightly overreacting.

44
00:02:19,832 --> 00:02:21,698
You killed him!

45
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,035
Killed him? I've killed lots of people.

46
00:02:25,037 --> 00:02:27,604
You're gonna have to be
a bit more specific.

47
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:02,673
What the hell happened to you?

48
00:03:04,276 --> 00:03:06,610
I really don't know.

49

<i>You injected me with Nazi serum?</i>

51
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:20,123
Which I'd redesigned to
quintuple my own strength

52
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,192
and transform my skin into an alloy

53
00:03:22,194 --> 00:03:23,293
a hundred times stronger than steel.

54
00:03:23,295 --> 00:03:26,029
Steel, that's a cool name.

55
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:28,165
Yeah, especially since my grandfather

56
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,866
was called Commander Steel.

57
00:03:29,868 --> 00:03:31,435
But what does that make me?

58
00:03:31,437 --> 00:03:33,136
Corporal Steel? Mr. Steel?

59
00:03:33,138 --> 00:03:34,404
Citizen Steel?

60
00:03:34,406 --> 00:03:36,873
Who cares? You got
superpowers now, dude.

61
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,176
Except I don't know
how I turned to steel

62
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:41,411
- in the first place.
- Ray'll teach you.

63
00:03:41,413 --> 00:03:43,513
- He will?
- You said it yourself,

64
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:46,717
you redesigned the serum.
Which I did beautifully,

65
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,519
but it's not like I have some
sort of instruction manual.

66
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,021
Guess you'll have to wing it.

67
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,856
Now, I'm gonna go have a chat

68
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,926
with our stowaway.

69
00:03:55,928 --> 00:03:57,394
This is gonna be so much fun!

70
00:03:57,396 --> 00:03:58,695
Hm.

71
00:04:06,637 --> 00:04:10,273
You stowed away before we
time-jumped from 1942.

72
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:11,541
I'm gonna get out of here,

73
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,977
and I'm gonna finish what I started.

74
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:16,413
You mean, killing Mick?

75
00:04:16,415 --> 00:04:20,016
Not that I haven't thought
of it myself, but why?

76
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,340
He killed Rex.

77
00:04:22,365 --> 00:04:24,265
What?

78
00:04:24,352 --> 00:04:25,785
Rex Tyler?

79
00:04:25,937 --> 00:04:28,003
As in Hourman?

80
00:04:28,075 --> 00:04:30,943
His killer stole the Askaran Amulet.

81
00:04:32,798 --> 00:04:35,312
Look, I'm sorry. I am.

82
00:04:35,337 --> 00:04:38,138
But Mick didn't do it.

83
00:04:38,437 --> 00:04:40,593
He is a thief and a murderer.

84
00:04:40,618 --> 00:04:42,718
He's also a Legend,

85
00:04:42,743 --> 00:04:44,410
and Mick hasn't been off the ship

86
00:04:44,435 --> 00:04:46,768
since we dropped your
team off at the JSA.

87
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:48,222
With his last words,

88
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,680
he told me his killer
was a time traveler.

89
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,351
You know, we've been tracking someone

90
00:04:54,353 --> 00:04:56,086
who's been trying to alter history.

91
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,454
We think it's the same person

92
00:04:57,456 --> 00:04:58,989
that gave Krieger the super-serum.

93
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:01,591
This might be your time traveler.

94
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,494
Look, if I let you out of here,

95
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:07,631
you promise not to hurt Mick
unless he really deserves it?

96
00:05:15,506 --> 00:05:17,641
Sorry for knocking you out.

97
00:05:17,643 --> 00:05:19,843
Sorry for locking you up.

98
00:05:19,845 --> 00:05:23,213
Call it even?

99
00:05:23,215 --> 00:05:24,781
When I was a kid, I used to play

100
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,683
JSA versus Nazis with my dolls.

101
00:05:26,685 --> 00:05:28,552
Well, they were action figures, really.

102
00:05:28,554 --> 00:05:30,687
But it doesn't matter 'cause
I got superpowers now

103
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:32,022
and it's awesome.

104
00:05:32,024 --> 00:05:33,457
Your powers manifested

105
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:35,325
as a result of a heightened
adrenal response.

106
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:38,628
Basically, Amaya threatened
you and you reacted.

107
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,930
So now

108
00:05:39,932 --> 00:05:41,731
what we need to do is
duplicate the conditions

109
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:44,668
which caused you to, you know, steel on?

110
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,303
Wait, so you want to threaten me?

111
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,805
- Not exactly.
- Wait, let's discuss this.

112
00:05:50,242 --> 00:05:51,908
I thought this was a time machine.

113
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,678
You saved the Justice Society.
Why can't you save Rex?

114
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,013
Because we're dealing with
another time traveler.

115
00:05:57,015 --> 00:05:59,416
If we go back and save Rex,
the time traveler will just

116
00:05:59,418 --> 00:06:01,084
go back before then and kill Rex again,

117
00:06:01,086 --> 00:06:02,519
so instead of chasing our own tails,

118
00:06:02,521 --> 00:06:04,087
we need to identify
who we're up against.

119
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:05,388
I don't understand any of this.

120
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,591
Look, I just need you to trust us.

121
00:06:07,593 --> 00:06:09,593
We're gonna find who do this.
I promise you.

122
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:11,661
In the meantime, Gideon
will fly you home.

123
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,897
I'm not going back until Rex's killer

124
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:15,999
is brought to justice.

125
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,468
We don't know how long that will take.

126
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,871
Don't worry, we're professionals.

127
00:06:20,873 --> 00:06:21,972
We know what we're doing.

128
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:32,349
Yeah, come on!

129
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:35,118
If Grandpa Heywood could see me now.

130
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,189
- Professional?
- Ish.

131
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:40,724
I know you not

132
00:06:40,726 --> 00:06:43,326
gonna take that, Ray.
Go crush this Tin Man.

133
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,065
- Nice try.
- Come on.

134
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,804
Hold on, I'll close it!

135
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,176
Ah!

136
00:07:04,282 --> 00:07:05,515
Nate!

137
00:07:05,517 --> 00:07:08,218
Ray, get inside! We
have to close the door.

138
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,287
No, I got to go after him.

139
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:12,556
Gideon, shut the cargo door.

140
00:07:23,835 --> 00:07:25,769
What's happening to the ship?

141
00:07:25,771 --> 00:07:27,904
Jax, what's our status?

142
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,473
<i>I've rerouted power from
the secondary manifolds.</i>

143
00:07:30,475 --> 00:07:32,475
Where are Dr. Palmer and Dr. Heywood?

144
00:07:32,477 --> 00:07:35,812
- Did you check out the window?
- What?

145
00:07:35,814 --> 00:07:38,381
How is it you people haven't
managed to kill yourselves yet?

146
00:07:38,383 --> 00:07:40,917
The day is still young.

147
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,054
- Jax?
- Yeah, I'm working on it.

148
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:51,628
Gideon, I need you
to track down Ray and Nate

149
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,197
- and take us to their position.
<i>- The explosive decompression</i>

150
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,899
<i>caused us to lose corrective altitude,</i>

151
00:07:55,901 --> 00:07:58,468
<i>which put too much strain on
the station-keeping thrusters.</i>

152
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,670
For God's sake, say it how it is.

153
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:01,871
We're screwed.

154
00:08:01,873 --> 00:08:04,174
<i>We're screwed.</i>

155
00:08:32,603 --> 00:08:35,071
Edo Period.

156
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,709
Mid-17th century Japan.

157
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,980
That's cool.

158
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:57,238
Well...

159
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,340
I'm still alive.

160
00:09:00,943 --> 00:09:03,744
So far, so good.

161
00:09:09,218 --> 00:09:10,484
Whoa, Samurais.

162
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:12,987
_

163
00:09:13,198 --> 00:09:15,464
_

164
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,091
Oh right, almost forgot.

165
00:09:25,101 --> 00:09:27,101
Can you understand me now?

166
00:09:27,103 --> 00:09:28,502
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

167
00:09:28,504 --> 00:09:29,870
Okay, he fell from the sky.

168
00:09:29,872 --> 00:09:32,673
He's about yea tall.

169
00:09:32,675 --> 00:09:34,208
Made out of metal.

170
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,076
No?

171
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:48,222
You're alive.

172
00:09:48,224 --> 00:09:51,825
Um, hi. How did I get here?

173
00:09:51,827 --> 00:09:54,695
I found you lying at
the bottom of a crater

174
00:09:54,697 --> 00:09:58,399
like you had been dropped from the sky.

175
00:09:58,401 --> 00:10:01,001
Dropped from the sky?

176
00:10:01,003 --> 00:10:03,570
That's the craziest
thing I've ever heard.

177
00:10:03,572 --> 00:10:06,507
Yeah, I sailed here,

178
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:08,509
you know, across the ocean

179
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,977
with some friends.

180
00:10:09,979 --> 00:10:13,247
Who hopefully are gonna find me.

181
00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:14,815
By the looks of it, I'm gonna say

182
00:10:14,817 --> 00:10:17,117
we're on the island of...

183
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:20,854
Honshu, in the vicinity of Kyoto?

184
00:10:20,856 --> 00:10:23,090
Yes.

185
00:10:23,092 --> 00:10:25,292
How did you learn to speak my language?

186
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:28,762
I studied it for many years.

187
00:10:28,764 --> 00:10:32,733
You know, so I could trade
with your countrymen.

188
00:10:32,735 --> 00:10:36,236
Yep, feudal Japan is my jam.

189
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:41,809
Masako,

190
00:10:41,811 --> 00:10:43,610
what are you doing

191
00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:45,546
talking to this <i>gaijin?</i>

192
00:10:45,548 --> 00:10:47,348
He was hurt, Father.

193
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,516
I brought him home so
you could care for him.

194
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:52,653
And who would care for us
when the Shogun finds out

195
00:10:52,655 --> 00:10:56,123
- we're aiding a foreigner?
- Please, Father.

196
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,125
You know what they would do to him.

197
00:11:01,897 --> 00:11:03,864
Very well.

198
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:06,867
Get him inside quickly.

199
00:11:09,637 --> 00:11:12,272
My name is Nate, by the way.

200
00:11:12,274 --> 00:11:16,443
- My name is Masako.
- Masako.

201
00:11:16,445 --> 00:11:19,480
That's a pretty name.

202
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:31,859
The Shogun asked you a question.

203
00:11:31,861 --> 00:11:34,728
Where did you find your armor?

204
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,897
I made it.

205
00:11:46,675 --> 00:11:48,475
Your armor is mine now.

206
00:11:48,477 --> 00:11:51,845
You don't understand.

207
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:55,616
I designed the suit
specifically for my body.

208
00:11:55,618 --> 00:11:57,985
Take the armor away.

209
00:11:59,755 --> 00:12:01,989
You're making a big mistake.

210
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:03,490
It could kill you!

211
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,761
Too hot?

212
00:12:07,763 --> 00:12:10,798
Are you, um, sure your old man's cool

213
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,600
with you giving me a bath?

214
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:16,737
- Mm.
- My father is not home.

215
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,807
I'm only giving you a bath

216
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:21,842
because you are dirty and injured.

217
00:12:21,844 --> 00:12:23,143
About that. I'm, uh...

218
00:12:23,145 --> 00:12:26,513
I'm more durable than it looks.

219
00:12:26,515 --> 00:12:28,949
You still have not told
where you are from.

220
00:12:28,951 --> 00:12:31,718
The United States,

221
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,220
which you've never heard of

222
00:12:33,222 --> 00:12:36,523
because it doesn't exist
for another 200 years.

223
00:12:36,525 --> 00:12:38,025
You are a strange man.

224
00:12:38,027 --> 00:12:41,328
You have no idea.

225
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,429
Enough about me,

226
00:12:42,431 --> 00:12:45,899
I overheard your father
talk about the Shogun.

227
00:12:45,901 --> 00:12:48,535
Is that Tokugawa lemitsu, by any chance?

228
00:12:48,537 --> 00:12:53,140
Historians view him as a
particularly brutal warlord

229
00:12:53,142 --> 00:12:55,642
and...

230
00:12:58,881 --> 00:13:01,381
Did I say something?

231
00:13:03,017 --> 00:13:06,820
Tomorrow I'm to be married
to Tokugawa lemitsu.

232
00:13:06,822 --> 00:13:10,290
Then my life is over.

233
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:18,132
How can you bring a thug
on a rescue mission?

234
00:13:18,134 --> 00:13:20,033
I've known men like you.

235
00:13:20,035 --> 00:13:21,568
Men who take and prey on the weak.

236
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,936
Listen, girly,

237
00:13:22,938 --> 00:13:24,972
I'm risking my neck for two morons

238
00:13:24,974 --> 00:13:26,874
who fell out of a ship. Why?

239
00:13:26,876 --> 00:13:28,442
'Cause they'd do the same for me.

240
00:13:28,444 --> 00:13:30,210
Why are you on the ship?

241
00:13:30,212 --> 00:13:32,312
'Cause I'm a member of the
Justice Society of America.

242
00:13:32,314 --> 00:13:35,048
- It's my job to protect everyone.
- Except for me.

243
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,352
You snuck up behind me and
sliced my throat like a ninja.

244
00:13:38,354 --> 00:13:40,354
There's no such thing
as ninjas, you idiot.

245
00:13:40,356 --> 00:13:42,289
- Tell that to Chuck Norris.
- Who's that?

246
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,590
- And I'm the idiot.
- And by the way,

247
00:13:43,592 --> 00:13:45,125
- I'm not your girly.
- All right,

248
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:46,493
if you two don't quit your squabbling,

249
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:47,728
I am going to maroon you

250
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,097
in a time period of my choosing.

251
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:52,966
Together.

252
00:14:00,543 --> 00:14:02,609
Not to brag, but...

253
00:14:02,611 --> 00:14:04,077
Between the
docking stabilizers

254
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,179
and the blast doors,

255
00:14:05,181 --> 00:14:07,114
I think this might be
my best patchwork ever.

256
00:14:07,116 --> 00:14:08,682
Well, charming as your confidence is,

257
00:14:08,684 --> 00:14:10,284
I think we better consult the expert.

258
00:14:10,286 --> 00:14:14,087
Gideon, would you be so kind
as to run a diagnostic report?

259
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:16,390
<i>Mr. Jackson's work has done the trick.</i>

260
00:14:16,392 --> 00:14:17,591
<i>A scan has revealed that</i>

261
00:14:17,593 --> 00:14:19,393
<i>all 36 compartments of the ship</i>

262
00:14:19,395 --> 00:14:21,295
<i>are in optimal condition.</i>

263
00:14:21,297 --> 00:14:22,863
That's weird.

264
00:14:22,865 --> 00:14:24,798
Actually, I think it's astonishing given

265
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,533
the considerable abuse
we've been under...

266
00:14:26,535 --> 00:14:28,769
No, no, not... not that.

267
00:14:28,771 --> 00:14:31,939
Gideon, did you say 36 compartments?

268
00:14:31,941 --> 00:14:34,875
<i>Correct. The entirety of the ship.</i>

269
00:14:34,877 --> 00:14:37,978
Before Rip, you know, disappeared,

270
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,480
he made me learn every
inch of the Waverider,

271
00:14:40,482 --> 00:14:42,216
and of those inches,

272
00:14:42,218 --> 00:14:44,484
35 compartments.

273
00:14:44,486 --> 00:14:46,119
So either I miscalculated or...

274
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:48,789
Captain Hunter had a secret compartment

275
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:50,857
he failed to tell you about.

276
00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:53,560
Gideon, please pull up the
schematics of the ship.

277
00:14:53,562 --> 00:14:56,129
No, we still have to fix the time drive.

278
00:14:56,131 --> 00:14:57,965
And we will.

279
00:14:57,967 --> 00:15:00,801
After.

280
00:15:00,803 --> 00:15:04,037
Please, don't tell me
you're not intrigued.

281
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:06,039
Masako, <i>san,</i>

282
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,174
a word please.

283
00:15:07,176 --> 00:15:09,576
What's wrong?

284
00:15:09,578 --> 00:15:11,245
The Shogun's men are here.

285
00:15:11,247 --> 00:15:13,180
Please come outside.

286
00:15:25,293 --> 00:15:28,028
<i>Konnichiwa.</i> How can I help you?

287
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,897
We found a <i>gaijin</i> in the forest.

288
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,332
The Shogun wants to make sure

289
00:15:32,334 --> 00:15:34,601
there are not any other
foreigners around

290
00:15:34,603 --> 00:15:38,639
to bother you. Oh, that
is very kind of him,

291
00:15:38,641 --> 00:15:40,941
but you are the only
visitor we've had today.

292
00:15:40,943 --> 00:15:42,576
Good.

293
00:15:42,578 --> 00:15:44,444
The last thing the Shogun wants

294
00:15:44,446 --> 00:15:46,847
before his wedding is surprises.

295
00:15:46,849 --> 00:15:50,317
Too late!

296
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:51,418
What are you doing?

297
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,120
Relax, I got this.

298
00:15:53,122 --> 00:15:55,689
- Who are you?
- I'm the guy telling you

299
00:15:55,691 --> 00:15:57,991
that your Shogun's wedding
has been canceled

300
00:15:57,993 --> 00:16:00,260
on account that he's an asshat.

301
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,133
But seriously.

302
00:16:06,135 --> 00:16:09,336
Why don't you boys mosey on
back to your big bad boss

303
00:16:09,338 --> 00:16:11,171
and tell him the news?

304
00:16:11,173 --> 00:16:13,774
Or what?

305
00:16:13,776 --> 00:16:15,309
Or it's gonna get ugly.

306
00:16:15,311 --> 00:16:18,111
I am wearing a Samurai's armor.

307
00:16:18,113 --> 00:16:19,446
You are not.

308
00:16:19,448 --> 00:16:21,815
I wear my armor on the inside.

309
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:25,319
Nate, stop insulting him. I beg of you.

310
00:16:25,321 --> 00:16:28,355
Relax, I got this.

311
00:16:33,562 --> 00:16:34,928
He caught me off guard.

312
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,797
Ah, he caught me off guard.

313
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,832
He caught me off guard.

314
00:16:42,371 --> 00:16:43,737
Come at me now.

315
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,707
It's not turning on.

316
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:48,742
Stop! Stop! Please!

317
00:16:48,744 --> 00:16:50,077
You're going to kill him.

318
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,513
That is entirely up to him.

319
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:55,315
Stay down, <i>gaijin.</i>

320
00:16:55,317 --> 00:16:57,284
She doesn't want to marry him.

321
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:08,662
We will return tomorrow to
take you to the castle.

322
00:17:08,664 --> 00:17:11,598
I trust there will be no more...

323
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,467
surprises.

324
00:17:28,016 --> 00:17:31,317
The sword did not cut any vital organs

325
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:33,119
but the blood loss...

326
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:35,154
Tell me about it.

327
00:17:35,156 --> 00:17:36,823
What were you thinking?

328
00:17:36,825 --> 00:17:39,158
I didn't mean to cause
you any more trouble.

329
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,427
I was just trying to help.

330
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:44,130
No one can help me.

331
00:17:44,132 --> 00:17:46,699
We have that in common.

332
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:49,602
Nate? Nate!

333
00:17:49,604 --> 00:17:53,339
The Signal from Ray's ATOM
suit is getting stronger.

334
00:17:53,341 --> 00:17:55,408
Doesn't exactly look inviting, does it?

335
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,077
The Domination."

336
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,612
Never took you for a cinephile.

337
00:17:59,614 --> 00:18:02,648
All I know is ninjas
like to hide in trees.

338
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,852
- I don't see anything.
- Exactly.

339
00:18:05,854 --> 00:18:08,020
You don't find them, they find you.

340
00:18:08,022 --> 00:18:10,089
Just because you saw ninjas in a movie,

341
00:18:10,091 --> 00:18:11,891
that doesn't make them real.

342
00:18:11,893 --> 00:18:13,593
I have to side with Mick on this one.

343
00:18:13,595 --> 00:18:15,128
They're real.

344
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,829
You think there's a
secret brotherhood of men

345
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:18,765
trained in the art of assassination?

346
00:18:18,767 --> 00:18:20,099
I hate to break it to you, Amaya,

347
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:22,435
but I'm basically a ninja.

348
00:18:25,507 --> 00:18:28,808
I miss the JSA.

349
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,911
Compartment 36 should
be right about here.

350
00:18:33,013 --> 00:18:34,347
What are you doing, Grey?

351
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:36,048
I'm looking for any hidden doors.

352
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,784
We don't
have time for this.

353
00:18:37,786 --> 00:18:40,019
Nate and Ray are lost in Feudal Japan.

354
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:42,555
Let's just fix the ship and go.

355
00:18:44,459 --> 00:18:47,360
Shh, did you hear that, Jefferson?

356
00:18:47,362 --> 00:18:49,228
Move.

357
00:18:57,638 --> 00:19:00,506
- Oh my god.
- Secret hatch.

358
00:19:00,508 --> 00:19:02,208
With a sequencing lock.

359
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:05,511
Clearly, Captain Hunter didn't
want anyone getting in.

360
00:19:05,513 --> 00:19:08,848
Or maybe he was trying to keep
something from getting out.

361
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,950
If I've learned one thing from "Lost,"

362
00:19:10,952 --> 00:19:13,719
it's you don't go
opening secret hatches.

363
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,358
Ray's close. Look sharp.

364
00:19:24,365 --> 00:19:26,799
Haircut, let's get out of here.

365
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:29,469
We're saving your ass, again.

366
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:34,140
It is you who need rescuing.

367
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:42,915
Fellas, getting a little cold
in here without my suit.

368
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:56,095
You are already defeated
before you have even begun.

369
00:19:56,097 --> 00:19:59,932
I have been trained in the art
of war by Shimura himself.

370
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:03,903
League of Assassins, class of '09.

371
00:20:03,905 --> 00:20:05,905
Don't take it easy on me.

372
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:42,275
We got to go.

373
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:48,481
Oh, hey, guys!

374
00:20:48,483 --> 00:20:51,918
- Wrong way, Haircut.
- What about my suit?

375
00:20:55,356 --> 00:20:57,890
We can get it later.

376
00:21:09,016 --> 00:21:11,450
My friend's serum,

377
00:21:11,452 --> 00:21:14,620
it's cured my hemophilia.

378
00:21:14,622 --> 00:21:17,122
Uh, long story.

379
00:21:17,124 --> 00:21:18,424
Short version,

380
00:21:18,426 --> 00:21:21,060
my blood didn't clot like normal people,

381
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:23,395
so if I were to cut myself shaving

382
00:21:23,397 --> 00:21:24,463
or get a paper cut,

383
00:21:24,465 --> 00:21:27,599
I could... die.

384
00:21:28,696 --> 00:21:32,265
So every day, you were afraid to live?

385
00:21:32,267 --> 00:21:34,367
Pretty much.

386
00:21:37,104 --> 00:21:39,005
In the Samurai tradition,

387
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:42,141
a warrior is always prepared for death.

388
00:21:42,143 --> 00:21:45,645
A woman celebrates when her
husband dies with honor.

389
00:21:46,748 --> 00:21:49,982
Wow. That's hardcore.

390
00:21:49,984 --> 00:21:53,953
A Samurai who fights without armor,

391
00:21:53,955 --> 00:21:56,856
that is hardcore.

392
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,030
Nate, you're alive.

393
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,798
Oh, hey, guys! You found me.

394
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,000
- Bad timing?
- Nope.

395
00:22:08,002 --> 00:22:09,835
Nope.

396
00:22:09,837 --> 00:22:11,837
Masako, these are,

397
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:14,607
uh, my friends I was telling you about.

398
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:16,242
<i>Hajimemashite.</i>

399
00:22:16,244 --> 00:22:17,643
Can I get you something to drink?

400
00:22:17,645 --> 00:22:19,212
Sake, lots of it.

401
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:21,681
What he meant to say is
thanks for your hospitality,

402
00:22:21,683 --> 00:22:23,149
but we must be going.

403
00:22:23,151 --> 00:22:24,884
- No, I didn't.
- Amaya's right.

404
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,385
Nate, let's go.

405
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:29,188
I can't.

406
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,224
We can't leave.

407
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:34,594
Masako's supposed to marry
the Shogun Tokugawa lemitsu.

408
00:22:34,596 --> 00:22:36,162
Yeah, met him. Not a fan.

409
00:22:36,164 --> 00:22:38,231
Well, the reason he sticks
out in the history books is

410
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:39,932
because he likes to murder his wives,

411
00:22:39,934 --> 00:22:41,968
and I can't leave Masako to his mercy.

412
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:44,036
Especially since he stole my ATOM suit.

413
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:45,938
Exactly. Wait, what?

414
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,341
You let the Shogun steal a
21st century super-suit?

415
00:22:48,343 --> 00:22:51,077
After I crash-landed
trying to rescue you.

416
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:53,980
How does the Shogun even know
how to operate your ATOM suit?

417
00:22:53,982 --> 00:22:56,215
I designed it so an idiot could use it.

418
00:22:56,217 --> 00:22:57,984
An idiot does.

419
00:22:57,986 --> 00:23:01,020
Guys, bottom line is, if the
Shogun has the ATOM suit,

420
00:23:01,022 --> 00:23:03,456
it's not just Masako and the
village we have to protect.

421
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:05,324
He can use it to conquer
the whole region.

422
00:23:05,326 --> 00:23:08,127
You said the Shogun's coming
for your new girlfriend.

423
00:23:08,129 --> 00:23:09,895
- Uh-huh.
- Easier to defend a village

424
00:23:09,897 --> 00:23:11,964
- than to attack a castle.
- But anyone who tries

425
00:23:11,966 --> 00:23:13,799
to fight the Shogun will be cut down.

426
00:23:13,801 --> 00:23:16,335
Except if that person

427
00:23:16,337 --> 00:23:19,071
- is made of steel.
- About that,

428
00:23:19,073 --> 00:23:22,375
I'm having a little problem
accessing my powers.

429
00:23:22,377 --> 00:23:24,877
Sounds like you're having
performance issues,

430
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:27,179
and it looks like you're
not done training him yet.

431
00:23:27,181 --> 00:23:29,015
Now the rest of us need to figure out

432
00:23:29,017 --> 00:23:31,250
how we can defend a village.

433
00:23:31,252 --> 00:23:32,551
Not me.

434
00:23:32,553 --> 00:23:34,553
Wake me up when the action starts.

435
00:23:47,034 --> 00:23:50,136
Whoa, what is this place?

436
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:53,139
It appears to be some sort of armory.

437
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:55,541
There's a reason why Rip
didn't want us in here.

438
00:23:55,543 --> 00:23:57,710
Some things you can't un-see.

439
00:23:57,712 --> 00:23:59,812
But why the big secret?

440
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:01,147
Rip didn't trust us to know that

441
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:03,449
there were heavy-duty weapons on board?

442
00:24:03,451 --> 00:24:06,118
Well, would you?

443
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:13,125
Look, Jefferson,

444
00:24:13,127 --> 00:24:17,463
our old friend has hailed the Waverider.

445
00:24:17,465 --> 00:24:20,166
Let's play it.

446
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:23,002
<i>Sorry to contact you like
this, Captain Hunter.</i>

447
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:24,970
<i>But I can't risk putting
any more lives in danger.</i>

448
00:24:24,972 --> 00:24:26,205
Thought this was from Barry Allen?

449
00:24:26,207 --> 00:24:27,206
It is.

450
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:28,641
Only from 40 years in the future.

451
00:24:28,643 --> 00:24:30,543
- And neither can this.
- Fascinating.

452
00:24:30,545 --> 00:24:33,412
<i>Which is why you'll keep what
I'm about to tell you a secret.</i>

453
00:24:33,414 --> 00:24:36,749
<i>Even from the rest of your team.</i>

454
00:24:38,285 --> 00:24:41,454
The ATOM suit is made of and
powered by dwarf star alloy.

455
00:24:41,456 --> 00:24:45,291
It's strong enough to withstand
bullets, arrows, and explosives.

456
00:24:45,293 --> 00:24:48,561
- So it's impenetrable?
- Not quite.

457
00:24:48,563 --> 00:24:51,163
Underneath the left thruster
is the alpha-stabilizer.

458
00:24:51,165 --> 00:24:54,200
- Alpha-stabilizer, got it.
- If you destroy it,

459
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:56,802
the photons that stream
from suit's weapons systems

460
00:24:56,804 --> 00:24:58,304
will overheat,

461
00:24:58,306 --> 00:25:00,773
theoretically causing somatic overload.

462
00:25:00,775 --> 00:25:03,275
Theoretically, that's...
that's comforting.

463
00:25:03,277 --> 00:25:05,177
You have to get close to the Shogun,

464
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:07,213
and in order to do that, you
have to be able to harden.

465
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:10,616
Well, when you're putting it in
those terms it isn't helping.

466
00:25:10,618 --> 00:25:12,051
Ow! Neither is that.

467
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:13,819
It worked the last time.

468
00:25:13,821 --> 00:25:15,154
Ow.

469
00:25:15,156 --> 00:25:17,890
Come on. My serum is flawless.

470
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:19,658
Your lack of focus is the problem.

471
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,227
You think I'm not focusing?

472
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:23,129
Like... enough!

473
00:25:23,131 --> 00:25:25,064
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can.

474
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,632
You don't think I don't
want to save the girl,

475
00:25:26,634 --> 00:25:29,935
spare the village, and be a
hero for once in my damn life?

476
00:25:29,937 --> 00:25:32,405
I spent half of my
childhood in the hospital

477
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:33,706
where it didn't even occur to me

478
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:35,341
to dream about having superpowers.

479
00:25:35,343 --> 00:25:38,277
But guess what? I got 'em, I lost 'em,

480
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:40,780
now I really, really need 'em,
and I can't get 'em back.

481
00:25:40,782 --> 00:25:43,249
This isn't all about you.

482
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:45,584
I worked for years, spent
billions of dollars

483
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:47,052
to develop the ATOM suit.

484
00:25:47,054 --> 00:25:49,188
I nearly died learning to shrink,

485
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:53,159
and now, I have to teach you
to destroy the very thing,

486
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:57,196
the only thing, that makes me a hero.

487
00:25:57,198 --> 00:25:58,964
Wait?

488
00:25:58,966 --> 00:26:01,667
"Somatic overload" means
destroy the suit?

489
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:05,371
Yeah, Nate.

490
00:26:05,373 --> 00:26:08,107
We can't beat the Shogun
while he's wearing the suit,

491
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:10,309
so we have to blow the suit up.

492
00:26:12,313 --> 00:26:14,780
Your powers are within you.

493
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,749
After today,

494
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:20,319
I'll have nothing left.

495
00:26:20,321 --> 00:26:22,421
Ray...

496
00:26:34,334 --> 00:26:37,169
You should all be safe here.

497
00:26:42,909 --> 00:26:45,444
They've never seen foreigners before.

498
00:26:45,446 --> 00:26:46,779
I was once just like them.

499
00:26:46,781 --> 00:26:49,648
My village was also small and isolated.

500
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,351
Some would say that my
people were superstitious,

501
00:26:52,353 --> 00:26:54,320
but in truth,

502
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:55,754
we were protected.

503
00:26:55,756 --> 00:26:59,358
Protected by that?

504
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,961
Legend has it that this
totem was one of five

505
00:27:01,963 --> 00:27:03,295
created by the gods

506
00:27:03,297 --> 00:27:06,932
and given to the five
great tribes of Zambesi.

507
00:27:06,934 --> 00:27:09,001
This totem harnesses the ashe,

508
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:10,703
or the... the life force,

509
00:27:10,705 --> 00:27:12,705
of the animal kingdom.

510
00:27:12,707 --> 00:27:14,507
It was passed down to me from my mother

511
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:16,642
and from hers before that.

512
00:27:16,644 --> 00:27:18,944
And why did you leave?

513
00:27:18,946 --> 00:27:21,547
I was recruited by the JSA,

514
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:23,282
and I realized that

515
00:27:23,284 --> 00:27:26,118
the world was much larger
than just my village,

516
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,487
and that there were
people beyond its borders

517
00:27:28,489 --> 00:27:31,156
who also needed protection.

518
00:27:31,158 --> 00:27:34,460
Sometimes I can't help but worry

519
00:27:34,462 --> 00:27:36,462
that with me gone,

520
00:27:36,464 --> 00:27:39,999
there's no one left to guard my home.

521
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:42,601
From people like Mr. Rory.

522
00:27:42,603 --> 00:27:44,003
At the end of the day,

523
00:27:44,005 --> 00:27:47,072
Mick does the right thing.

524
00:27:47,074 --> 00:27:48,874
Usually.

525
00:27:56,717 --> 00:28:00,586
You remind me of my son.

526
00:28:00,588 --> 00:28:01,954
Why?

527
00:28:01,956 --> 00:28:03,989
Was he a terrible teacher, too?

528
00:28:06,516 --> 00:28:10,618
He was a great Samurai.

529
00:28:12,823 --> 00:28:17,727
I built him the strongest
and most formidable armor

530
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,862
in all of Japan.

531
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,131
Forged him a sword

532
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:25,401
fit for an Emperor.

533
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,504
What happened to him?

534
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:31,708
My son was popular

535
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,211
with the men who served under him,

536
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:38,181
and the Shogun resented him for it.

537
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:41,050
So he ordered Oda

538
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,453
to commit <i>seppuku.</i>

539
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,755
We will make sure that the Shogun pays

540
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:48,057
for what he's done to your family.

541
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,959
Maybe.

542
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:51,961
Maybe not.

543
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:53,696
But I ask you,

544
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:57,267
would I rather hold my son again

545
00:28:57,269 --> 00:29:00,303
or his armor?

546
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:02,105
Your son, obviously.

547
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:06,175
An armor is nothing but
iron, leather, and silk.

548
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:08,211
It can be replaced,

549
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,980
but the man

550
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:13,750
who wears the armor is...

551
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,451
I get it.

552
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,053
You're saying I don't
need a suit of armor

553
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,388
to defeat the Shogun.

554
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,490
Don't be ridiculous.

555
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:24,127
He'll kill you in seconds.

556
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,062
Follow me.

557
00:29:28,532 --> 00:29:30,266
I'm gonna die.

558
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,535
Yeah, probably.

559
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:35,705
That was actually your
cue to cheer me up.

560
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,407
Oh, if you accept death

561
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:40,076
you have nothing to fear.

562
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:43,746
I'm more afraid of what's
gonna happen to you if I die.

563
00:29:44,915 --> 00:29:47,917
I know I have these powers inside me.

564
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,286
I just can't figure out how to use them.

565
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,355
Does a child learn to laugh?

566
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:55,158
Does he sit and practice laughing?

567
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,392
No.

568
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:58,099
He just laughs.

569
00:29:58,124 --> 00:29:59,656
Hmm.

570
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:03,132
"Do or do not, there is no try."

571
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,467
Exactly.

572
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,969
Where did you learn that?

573
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,540
From a great sensei

574
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,709
from where I'm from.

575
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:14,544
Yoda.

576
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:17,914
Ah, this Master Yoda is very wise.

577
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,620
The Shogun approaches.

578
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:26,589
Get to the temple.

579
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:56,586
Where is my bride?

580
00:30:56,587 --> 00:30:58,569
She's not leaving.

581
00:30:58,695 --> 00:31:00,195
Not with you.

582
00:31:07,303 --> 00:31:10,805
I'm just gonna need a second.

583
00:31:21,154 --> 00:31:22,662
_

584
00:31:22,687 --> 00:31:24,146
_

585
00:31:29,593 --> 00:31:33,194
Find the villagers. Kill them.

586
00:31:39,136 --> 00:31:41,569
Your form is all wrong.

587
00:31:49,316 --> 00:31:51,851
I ordered Ichiro to destroy that blade

588
00:31:51,853 --> 00:31:54,589
after the death of his son.

589
00:31:54,683 --> 00:31:56,783
Very well.

590
00:31:56,786 --> 00:32:00,421
I will destroy it myself.

591
00:32:03,987 --> 00:32:06,921
<i>Konnichiwa,</i> scumbag.

592
00:32:08,324 --> 00:32:11,692
Go get him.

593
00:32:14,196 --> 00:32:16,129
I will kill you

594
00:32:16,131 --> 00:32:19,633
with your own armor.

595
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:23,705
Check the temple.

596
00:32:23,706 --> 00:32:25,739
Rematch?

597
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:30,978
- Who is your master?
- I have no master.

598
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:34,415
A ronin. You're not
worthy of the effort.

599
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,318
You have fought with honor.

600
00:33:00,343 --> 00:33:02,176
Now you will die with it.

601
00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:04,111
About that.

602
00:33:13,755 --> 00:33:15,522
This village is under our protection.

603
00:33:15,524 --> 00:33:18,458
Leave now and we'll spare your lives.

604
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,749
A sword is only as deadly
as the man who wields it.

605
00:33:52,193 --> 00:33:54,828
And armor is only as strong
as the man who wears it.

606
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:19,252
I don't want to shoot you guys.

607
00:34:19,254 --> 00:34:21,154
I love ninjas.

608
00:34:45,714 --> 00:34:47,114
That was the armature relay.

609
00:34:47,116 --> 00:34:49,349
It enhances the limbs' reaction time.

610
00:35:07,402 --> 00:35:08,802
Where the hell is Mick?

611
00:35:08,804 --> 00:35:11,471
Probably ransacking the village himself.

612
00:35:19,714 --> 00:35:22,282
Told you ninjas were real.

613
00:35:24,452 --> 00:35:25,719
That's the cooling system.

614
00:35:25,721 --> 00:35:27,387
Trust me, it gets hot in there. I know.

615
00:35:27,389 --> 00:35:29,289
You think you are clever.

616
00:35:40,234 --> 00:35:43,870
You dishonor my family
and torture my village.

617
00:35:43,872 --> 00:35:46,473
I will enjoy killing you.

618
00:35:52,914 --> 00:35:56,183
Your family will be
extinguished from history.

619
00:36:02,491 --> 00:36:04,224
We haven't been introduced.

620
00:36:04,226 --> 00:36:06,126
Name's Steel.

621
00:36:30,918 --> 00:36:33,019
- Remember, you got to hit...
- I remember!

622
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,363
Do it!

623
00:37:02,517 --> 00:37:05,585
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

624
00:37:05,587 --> 00:37:08,889
You did it. I did it.

625
00:37:08,891 --> 00:37:10,724
Yeah...

626
00:37:10,726 --> 00:37:12,592
you blew up the ATOM suit.

627
00:37:19,001 --> 00:37:22,135
I am so sorry.

628
00:37:22,137 --> 00:37:24,171
It's okay.

629
00:37:24,173 --> 00:37:26,339
You steeled on.

630
00:37:26,341 --> 00:37:29,242
Kind of proud of you.

631
00:37:40,474 --> 00:37:42,509
Master Yoda taught you well.

632
00:37:43,912 --> 00:37:46,980
Right, uh, Yoda. Well, thank you.

633
00:37:46,982 --> 00:37:48,882
Um...

634
00:37:48,884 --> 00:37:51,117
I was thinking now that,

635
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,620
uh, your wedding is canceled...

636
00:37:57,225 --> 00:38:00,059
You come from the sky.

637
00:38:00,061 --> 00:38:03,430
Something tells me you have to return.

638
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:13,106
I, um...

639
00:38:13,108 --> 00:38:16,643
I'm glad the katana sword
found a worthy owner.

640
00:38:16,645 --> 00:38:18,578
Me too.

641
00:38:20,848 --> 00:38:22,882
You.

642
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:26,052
Don't think I didn't see how
you stood up to the Shogun.

643
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,220
Even though he's gone,

644
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:30,056
your village still needs a protector.

645
00:38:33,928 --> 00:38:36,162
That sword,

646
00:38:36,164 --> 00:38:38,965
what did you say your family name was?

647
00:38:38,967 --> 00:38:40,366
Yamashiro.

648
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:48,508
Thank you for loaning
me your son's armor.

649
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:51,845
I'm sorry it got a bit
dinged up in the battle.

650
00:38:51,847 --> 00:38:54,814
Then it served its purpose.

651
00:38:54,816 --> 00:38:57,016
Haircut. Steel.

652
00:38:57,018 --> 00:39:01,020
Sara says we got to clear out.

653
00:39:01,022 --> 00:39:04,457
- Good-bye, Masako.
- Good-bye, Nate.

654
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,662
What an amazing time period.

655
00:39:09,664 --> 00:39:12,999
Definitely my favorite,
besides the Old West.

656
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:15,602
Why are you two goofy bastards so happy?

657
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:17,937
You lost your damn suit, the food sucks,

658
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:21,407
and I've got no proof ninjas exist.

659
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:37,223
What are you staring at?

660
00:39:37,225 --> 00:39:39,125
I've figured you out.

661
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,160
Congratulations.

662
00:39:41,162 --> 00:39:44,531
You act like this selfish meathead,

663
00:39:44,533 --> 00:39:48,101
but secretly, you're not so bad.

664
00:39:48,103 --> 00:39:51,237
You know, you might even
have the makings of a hero.

665
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:53,907
Well, that proves one thing.

666
00:39:53,909 --> 00:39:56,943
You don't know me.

667
00:39:56,945 --> 00:39:59,045
Perhaps not.

668
00:40:00,948 --> 00:40:02,749
Trying to kill me again?

669
00:40:02,751 --> 00:40:04,484
Trying to give you a present.

670
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:08,087
In case you ever need proof
you met an actual ninja.

671
00:40:22,603 --> 00:40:25,905
All right. What's your secret?

672
00:40:27,374 --> 00:40:28,608
What on earth do you mean?

673
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,410
Well, you two must be magicians

674
00:40:30,412 --> 00:40:32,512
considering how badly
damaged the Waverider was

675
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:34,581
- before we left.
- Oh, that.

676
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:37,917
Well, Jefferson and I went
over the ship top to bottom.

677
00:40:37,919 --> 00:40:41,654
And safe to say there are no
surprises left on the Waverider.

678
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:46,192
Great. I'll go prep for takeoff.

679
00:40:50,297 --> 00:40:51,998
So are we gonna say something

680
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,700
about future-Barry's message or not?

681
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:55,101
Barry was very clear

682
00:40:55,103 --> 00:40:57,136
about the team not knowing
what he told Captain Hunter.

683
00:40:57,138 --> 00:40:59,839
Except now we know.

684
00:40:59,841 --> 00:41:01,708
Indeed.

685
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,876
You were right, Jefferson.

686
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:07,680
Some things you just can't un-see.

687
00:41:11,853 --> 00:41:14,220
I think it's time we said sayonara

688
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:16,789
to Feudal Japan. Now, where to next?

689
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:20,426
I could always open the hatch,
jump out, and see where I land.

690
00:41:20,428 --> 00:41:22,962
I say we just sit back and see
where the timestream takes us.

691
00:41:22,964 --> 00:41:25,798
Aren't you forgetting that Rex's
killer is still at-large?

692
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,302
Not my problem.

693
00:41:29,304 --> 00:41:32,338
I mean, we should find the
bastard and kill him.

694
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:35,375
Perhaps we can enjoy a
little takeoff music.

695
00:41:36,845 --> 00:41:38,778
Ah, nice one, Gideon.

696
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:42,181
<i>Captain Hunter always enjoyed this song.</i>

697
00:41:42,183 --> 00:41:44,384
<i>- ♪ Time...</i>
- Speaking of problems.

698
00:41:44,386 --> 00:41:46,152
Don't worry. We're gonna find Rip

699
00:41:46,154 --> 00:41:47,587
and Hourman's killer.

700
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:49,789
In the meantime, everyone just shut up

701
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:51,591
and let me do the flying.

702
00:41:56,865 --> 00:41:59,576
