00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:36,907
She had red hair.

00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:39,910
Oh?

00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:42,496
- How big were her feet?
- What do you want me to say?

7
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,250
I want you to tell me
what it was like to have someone.

8
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,127
To be with someone.

9
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,587
To love someone
and have them love you back.

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,020
So you and Gilly never?

13
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,564
No. She just had a baby.

14
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:13,819
And she never offered.

15
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,238
But if she had,

16
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,283
you would have?

17
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,119
You'd have broken your vows?

18
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:28,667
The interesting thing is,

19
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:33,339
our vows never specifically forbid
intimate relations with women.

20
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:34,632
What?

21
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:38,010
"I shall take no wife."
Yes, that's in there. There's no denying that.

22
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:40,679
"I shall father no children." It's very specific.

23
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:44,433
But what our vows have to say
about other activities

24
00:03:44,517 --> 00:03:46,727
is open to interpretation.

25

I don't think Ser Alliser
cares much for interpretation.

26

ever got to a wildling was this very library.

He didn't listen, and neither did you.

Which is why you've abandoned
your watch atop the Wall

113

to come here and read
about the terrible things

- No.

Yes, you do.

I'm sorry, Maester.

126
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,032
I didn't mean it like that.

A future king always does.

132
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:40,224
Some of them were quite forward
in their attempts to win my affections.

133
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,228
One of them succeeded.

Ah.

137
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:54,655
I could tell you everything about her.

138
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:57,908
Who she was, how we met,

139
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:02,788
the colour of her eyes
and the shape of her nose.

140
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,583

141
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:09,920
right in front of me.

142
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,716
She's more real than you are.

143

We could spend all night
trading tales of lost loves.

a sweeter place to visit

Aye.

492
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:48,436
You should have.

493
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:50,856

494
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:54,609
(DOOR OPENS)

495
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,404
Whoa, it's me.

496
00:45:01,783 --> 00:45:03,076
I promised you, didn't I?

497
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,248
(SCUFFLES)

498
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:20,468
SAMWELL: We held them off.

499
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:22,178
JON: For one night.

500
00:45:22,262 --> 00:45:24,598
This is a great victory.

501
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:26,725
A great victory?

502
00:45:28,435 --> 00:45:32,397
Mance was testing our defences.
He almost made it through.

503
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,191
And he has more giants.
He has more mammoths.

504
00:45:35,275 --> 00:45:37,861
He has 1,000 times as many men.

505
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:44,034
They'll hit us again tonight.

506
00:45:44,117 --> 00:45:47,871
Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two,
but we'll never beat them.

507
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:50,415
Where are we going?

508
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:52,250
Going to find Mance.

509
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:54,836
You can't do that.

510
00:45:55,003 --> 00:45:56,755
No one gave you any orders.

511
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,758
Who's left to give orders?

512
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:03,595
The wildling army's only an army
because of Mance.

513
00:46:04,346 --> 00:46:06,765
He united 100 warring tribes.

514
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:08,391
Without Mance, they lose their leader.

515
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:11,311
They lose their purpose.
They go back to fighting each other.

516
00:46:11,394 --> 00:46:12,896
Scatter back to their homes.

517
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:15,523
Without Mance?

518
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:16,608
You're going to kill him?

519
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:17,859
I'm gonna try.

520
00:46:17,943 --> 00:46:20,111
They'll never let you within 100 yards of him.

521
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:22,238
And even if they did,
even if you managed to kill him...

522
00:46:22,322 --> 00:46:24,699
They'll kill me?
If I don't go, they'll kill me anyway.

523
00:46:24,783 --> 00:46:26,326
They'll kill the rest of us, too.

524
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,036
SAMWELL: They won't just kill you.

525
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:32,040
They'll boil you, flay you, make it last days.

526
00:46:35,085 --> 00:46:38,338
You're right. It's a bad plan.

527
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:42,592
What's your plan?

528
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:28,263
They held the gate.

529
00:47:37,564 --> 00:47:39,941
Get some brothers down here to help you.

530
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:44,070
We need to burn the bodies.

531
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,469
Raise the outer gate.

532
00:48:08,178 --> 00:48:10,597
Then lower it again as soon as I'm out.

533
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:22,233
(METAL CLINKING)

534
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:23,526
What are you doing?

535
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,154
I promised Mormont I'd never lose it again.

536
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:32,702
In case I don't come back.

537
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:42,378
Jon.

538
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:48,885
Come back.
