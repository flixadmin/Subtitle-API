No. We agreed that we wouldn't.

<i>You never call me "Sara."

<i>Well, turn it over in the library.

61
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,107
A bit vulgar for a Time Master...

62
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,448
Time pirate, we're thinking.

63
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,905
He activated a beacon.
We have to go after him.

64
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,911
He's a time pirate.
Why would we rescue him?

65
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,746
Because if he ends up
somewhere he shouldn't...

66
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,160
And does something he shouldn't...

67
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,795
It's Aberration-palooza.

68
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:27,128
So where do we think he's going to end up?

69
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:33,472
Looks like Mississippi, 1863.

If you don't mind.

76
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:49,859
Someone has to stay behind as backup.

No suit, no powers, no tech.

79
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,113
I mean, I guess Sara had no choice
but to bench him.

80
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,954
Well, I'm sure
she was just trying to keep him safe.

81
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:05,792
This time period
is replete with various perils.

82
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,540
Perhaps, it might be easier

83
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:13,338
if you were to remain behind
and keep Dr. Palmer company.

84
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,385
Perhaps you should remain behind.

85
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,722
No? Because you're not black?

86
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,721
Because you think that
me going back to 1863,

87
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:23,889
I can't handle it?

88
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,813
That doesn't mean there's a need for you
to subject yourself

89
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,819
to the horrors that await you in that era.

90
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:31,897
Okay.

91
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,193
Now I get, it might be
difficult for you to understand this.

92
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,571
But I've been black my entire life, Grey.

93
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,408
And honestly, I can't think of a
time period we could go to

94
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,372
where I wouldn't face some sort of racism.

95
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,500
So don't worry, okay?

96
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,221
Along with comms devices,
I've also packed sack lunches.

97
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,057
I figure the food in 1863 is pretty lousy.

98
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,180
All right. The operation is simple.

99
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,896
We isolate the target,
we eliminate the time ship

100
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,105
and we get out of there.

101
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,065
And all while wearing this dress...

102
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:12,854

I can't believe it.

111
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,011
It looks to be some kind of escape pod.

112
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,804
No doubt,
it fell out of the temporal zone.

113

No sign of anyone.

the plans Scott stole helped Grant win
the Battle of Champion Hill.

And I'm guessing none of that happened

because Scott was bayonetted

the bravest man I've ever had
in my ranks...

644

Was I just trying to kiss you?

I can only hope, Mr. Rory.

657

I think I'm gonna be sick.

This is a godsend.

673
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,872
We know how the rebels
are planning to take Champion Hill.

674
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,708
And when they do,
we'll be there to give 'em hell.

Yes, sir.

Henry Scott.

680
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:19,227
Mr. Scott, thank you
for your incredible bravery

681
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:21,263
and your service to the United States.

682
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,766
You may have just won this war for us.

683
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,111
And are these men and women
from the Collins Plantation?

684
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,396
Yes, they are, sir.

685
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:34,284
We will care for anyone seeking refuge
in our camp from the Confederate states.

686
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,912
We have plenty of food and water
for everyone.

687
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:39,614
Thank you.

688
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,163
We've spread the vaccine
our friends worked up.

689
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,499
The only Confederates
you'll have to worry about now

690
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,634
are the living ones.

691
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:52,965
I'm obliged.

692
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:58,808
Your man, Colonel Sanders,
he, uh, tells me you're his captain?

693
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:02,809
In any case, he mentioned
something about you having regrets

694
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:06,517
about putting men in harm's way.

695
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:10,312
I don't think that's something
I can ever get used to.

696
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,030
You know,

697
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:15,446
by the time
I had taken over this division,

698
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:19,329
there had already been
three other generals in place before me.

699
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,491
They'd all stepped down and given up.

700
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,206
But I believe in my men.

701
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:29,506
And I believe
in the good that we're doing.

702
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,665
Do you?

703
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:34,632
Do you believe in your mission,
Captain Lance?

704
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:36,509
I do.

705
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,142
Then don't regret
making those tough decisions.

706

- Hey.

I don't feel like eating anyone's brains,
so...

710
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:08,703
Thank you.

711
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,414
Well, maybe you feel like eating a burger.

712
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:13,750
No sprouts.

713
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,721
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

714
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:24,765
Well, there's a little something.

715
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:27,056
- I had to ask, didn't I?
<i>- It's just...</i>

716
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,725
I don't think it's any secret
that without my suit,

717
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,768
I've been wondering
what my place on the team is.

(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
If I even have a place, you know?

719
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,074
Being an outsider is a good thing.
It's a great thing.

720
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,281
I've been an outsider my whole life.

721

Cool.

730
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,337
What on earth are you doing?

731
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,422
Oh, uh...

732
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,055
Scrimshaw. It was my mom's thing.

733
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,639
She taught me a little.

734
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,263
Makes me think of her.

735
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:50,847
Oh.

736
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,974
I had no idea.

737
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:56,561
Are you homesick?

738
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:01,445
You checking up on me, Grey?

739
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,200
Given what you've witnessed,
what you've endured...

740
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,160
Would that really be so bad?

741
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:10,992
No.

742
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:16,632
You've just witnessed
the very worst of humanity.

743

<i>We share a psychic connection</i>

744
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,303
but I still can't even begin to fathom
what you must be feeling.

745
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:28,969
It must be like your heart is broken.

746
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,095
Yeah.

747
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:33,397
It is.

748
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:37,186
But I saw something
in those people's eyes...

749
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,526
I didn't expect to see.

750
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,574
I saw hope.

751
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,864
I saw dignity.

752
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:47,866
These men and women...

<i>They were treated worse than animals.</i>

754
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:54,954
But they never let anybody
stop them from being people.

755
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,371
You know?

756
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:03,095
I suppose there will always be
those who seek to dehumanize us,

757
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:06,139
but I believe there are more

758
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:11,394
that cling to hope despite the darkness.

759
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:16,938
Yeah, that's exactly how they were.

760
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,193
I was actually thinking of you, Jefferson.
