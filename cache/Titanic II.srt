1
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:49,966
Costgard Sector Command.
How I can take your call?

2
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:54,635
Sir.
- Do not have a new...

3
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,735
...baby to be home to?

4
00:03:58,052 --> 00:04:01,818
I'll stay as you have a 456 line 4...

5
00:04:03,857 --> 00:04:08,317
Captain Maine.
- What?

6
00:04:10,364 --> 00:04:12,364
How big?

7
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:17,169
OK. On my way.

8
00:04:17,538 --> 00:04:22,043
Problems sir? - Bring me to Snives
- Mr immediately...

9
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:36,071
'He called me sir?
- No, Snives...

10
00:04:36,171 --> 00:04:40,366
But since no one else.
- Sorry sir, good morning.

11
00:04:40,694 --> 00:04:44,264
I think this morning there is nothing good.

12
00:05:37,851 --> 00:05:39,851
Watch where you walk.

13
00:05:41,555 --> 00:05:47,127
I'd rather see someone die rather than
give mouth to mouth resuscitation...

14
00:05:47,227 --> 00:05:51,800
Still not sure
- I am sure is coming.

15
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:55,033
You're a hopeless case.

16
00:05:57,905 --> 00:06:00,030
Your boyfriend is here...

17
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:46,680
It's so great.
- The planes are great girl.

18
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:50,615
This is monumental.

19
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,759
Are we?

20
00:06:56,363 --> 00:07:00,322
I changed my mind, your
dad has to come now.

21
00:07:00,701 --> 00:07:02,782
Really, why?

22
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:06,158
Well, I think you have to know someone.

23
00:07:09,343 --> 00:07:11,300
What?
I thought you had...

24
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,532
...it in your hands.

25
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,267
Besides does not like your dad?

26
00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:20,062
No, I would hate if I met him, believe me.

27
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:25,555
Good is the boat owner.

28
00:07:25,993 --> 00:07:27,993
Well to address.

29
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:38,441
How are you?
How are you, having a good time?

30
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:42,588
Enjoy, How are you? Hello, hello...

31
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,425
Look at this, hi.
- Can I have your...

32
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:48,348
...autograph please...

33
00:07:48,448 --> 00:07:53,378
Sure, what's your name honey? - Tamy.
- I like that name...

34
00:07:54,187 --> 00:07:55,656
Tamy Here.
- I also could have your...

35
00:07:55,756 --> 00:07:56,523
...autograph please?

36
00:07:56,623 --> 00:07:59,513
Sure, what's your name?
- Bruneo...

37
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:05,465
I like that name.
- Now make safer than old.

38
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,480
Only bad children for safety
are not permitted...

39
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:28,317
Hi, Dad. - Amy
- Let me guess, work.

40
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:33,493
There is a glacier that want to investigate.

41
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:38,940
Dad the boat is amazing there
is nothing to worry about.

42
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,520
Not that I worry about the outside.

43
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,530
We talked about this, how
much is in that boat?

44
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:49,076
We agreed that it was good for me.

45
00:08:49,176 --> 00:08:51,044
Yes, but that was before I realized...

46
00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:55,224
...the rush to put him on
the anniversary was...

47
00:08:56,883 --> 00:09:01,133
Dad, the boat passed inspection?
- With the just...

48
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,225
We M.
- Baby I have to hang...

49
00:09:06,325 --> 00:09:08,325
...up, then talk...

50
00:09:10,397 --> 00:09:12,397
Bye.
- Te Quie...

51
00:09:30,951 --> 00:09:34,096
What's wrong sir?
- No, that's fine...

52
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:49,378
Hi Glen. - Amy Maine, Good to see you.
- Ditto...

53
00:09:51,338 --> 00:09:54,342
Welcome aboard the Titanic II.
- Thank you, you have good day.

54
00:09:54,442 --> 00:09:56,442
You also.

55
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:07,542
Amy, that good that could come.

56
00:10:08,422 --> 00:10:12,502
Yes, everything looks nice
you did a great job...

57
00:10:12,793 --> 00:10:14,793
How is your dad?
- OK...

58
00:10:16,997 --> 00:10:18,997
See ya.
- Bye.

59
00:10:33,814 --> 00:10:37,724
Ladies and gentlemen I thank
you all for coming.

60
00:10:37,784 --> 00:10:41,922
On this day come with me to
the history of this country.

61
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:46,612
And that he sees a good future
and establish a new path.

62
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:53,956
A day in which the loss of the lives
of the predecessor of this boat.

63
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:59,230
Will be replaced with the memory of the
larger boat, fast, and sophisticated...

64
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,795
...ever built, the Titanic II.

65
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,520
I want to introduce the man
who will guide this ship.

66
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,134
Will ship's Captain Howard.

67
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:24,505
I hope you all enjoy as we all.

68
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:28,619
And we enter the history book...

69
00:11:50,257 --> 00:11:55,102
Will not you come to lunch?
- I had lunch 5 minutes ago...

70
00:11:55,262 --> 00:11:59,505
How dull.
- Do not let them bite you...

71
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:17,692
All passengers are on board sir.
- Well...

72
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:21,736
Let's make history.
- Yes sir.

73
00:14:58,011 --> 00:15:02,091
Control tower this is the
6565 Coast Guard change.

74
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:06,574
How will 6565 Copy Captain?

75
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:09,932
We will land in a couple
of minutes, during...

76
00:15:10,032 --> 00:15:14,754
The Coast Guard will be on hold.
- Do you have another bad...

77
00:15:14,854 --> 00:15:16,831
...presentimiendo Captain?

78
00:15:16,931 --> 00:15:18,931
You could say...

79
00:15:25,405 --> 00:15:28,465
There is the camp.
- Yes sir I see...

80
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:40,722
The Coast Guard is here.
- Really?

81
00:16:03,243 --> 00:16:06,531
They should give a smaller...

82
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:11,126
It is very far
- I'll leave it on just in case...

83
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:15,201
Dr Kim Patterson.
- Nice.

84
00:16:25,965 --> 00:16:30,870
Insurance will wonder why you asked to
come but his reputation precedes him.

85
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:35,675
And I need someone serious when I
say that we are on a time bomb.

86
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:37,775
I'm listening.

87
00:16:39,212 --> 00:16:43,785
The wave of collapse yesterday
went to northern Canada.

88
00:16:44,951 --> 00:16:49,327
The piece of ice that fell from collapse,
is the size of Manhattan.

89
00:16:49,427 --> 00:16:52,325
I figured it would make a
piece of ice that size.

90
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:55,531
I guess we push to mid-Atlantic.

91
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:57,995
Across the Atlantic.

92
00:16:58,631 --> 00:17:00,842
These measures are mass balance.

93
00:17:00,942 --> 00:17:03,570
That when the temperature increases
the balance shifts.

94
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,010
The ice show.

95
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,809
These tests tell us that the
ice in which we are now.

96
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:13,513
Thickness has decreased
60 meters in a year...

97
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:15,865
It's awesome.
- Exactly.

98
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:22,510
I think there is anything you
would like to see follow me.

99
00:17:31,731 --> 00:17:35,216
Of course there is global warming true...

100
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:42,269
Can you tell me what
the hell am I watching?

101
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:44,506
The collapse of yesterday.

102
00:17:50,884 --> 00:17:52,884
God.

103
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:58,431
Have you ever thought of
Captain Armageddon?

104
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:03,596
If yesterday's collapse was only a trifle
the following will be colossal.

105
00:18:03,696 --> 00:18:06,699
Now imagine the Atlantic Ocean.

106
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:38,730
Do you admire your masterpiece?

107
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:44,511
Yes, I did Do not be late for your party?

108
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:54,828
It's my boat, I think I will wait also
would like to enter with a girl...

109
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:04,425
You know, I called you.
- Yes.

110
00:19:04,691 --> 00:19:07,156
If only be delayed six months.

111
00:19:10,096 --> 00:19:14,006
Your dad gave me a punch
in the nose you expect.

112
00:19:15,335 --> 00:19:17,681
I found driving his boat at
2 am without his consent...

113
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:22,201
I think he was right.
- You're still the Daddy's girl.

114
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:25,109
Look Who's Talking.

115
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:38,326
I did not speak, I feel what happened to
your dad, I know how much he wanted.

116
00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:40,725
Do not mention it.

117
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:46,094
Looks like you left in charge.

118
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:49,927
COA industries.

119
00:19:51,404 --> 00:19:54,804
I always thought you'd end as coastguard.

120
00:19:55,408 --> 00:19:58,876
Yeah, well...
when you give the keys of an...

121
00:19:58,976 --> 00:20:01,271
...empire is hard to refuse.

122
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:08,539
You still have the earrings that I gave you.

123
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:11,568
Yes, I have so many earrings.

124
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:15,941
Well, those like me.

125
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:22,986
You could have answered the call.

126
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:29,566
And then what...
pretend that all was as before?

127
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:37,183
Accept that you care more about your boat
and your money than you care about me.

128
00:20:37,283 --> 00:20:42,978
Yeah well, your father did not need
controlling all my life paranoid.

129
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:47,275
Not talking about my father, talked to us.

130
00:20:47,994 --> 00:20:51,989
You chose a different life
is fine, I understand.

131
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,645
And it seems that you are happy
with the decision you made.

132
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,930
You better back in does not
want to miss your party.

133
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,099
Good lord the Titanic time goes well.

134
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,054
Wait, hold it steady.

135
00:21:37,154 --> 00:21:41,064
We are stable, naval
readings to 31 degrees...

136
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:46,917
Is it true?.
- How so?

137
00:21:47,887 --> 00:21:50,692
The same reading as 100 years ago.

138
00:21:52,158 --> 00:21:55,898
Well, only this time we
have enough lifeboats.

139
00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:01,134
I also believe that this time
also avoid the icebergs.

140
00:22:01,234 --> 00:22:03,234
Yes sir.

141
00:22:05,438 --> 00:22:09,730
Lord, I have to remind.

142
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,818
We have not yet deployed the propellers...

143
00:22:11,918 --> 00:22:14,893
Yes... we need to accelerate
- Relax.

144
00:22:15,281 --> 00:22:19,786
May resemble its predecessor
but inside is much better.

145
00:22:20,553 --> 00:22:23,101
Yes sir...

146
00:22:27,894 --> 00:22:31,694
How long before we collapse?
- Hard to say.

147
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:38,539
But when you do the North Atlantic
will be devastated by the wave.

148
00:23:03,262 --> 00:23:05,262
What was that?

149
00:23:13,472 --> 00:23:15,472
Go back.

150
00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:52,409
Upload.

151
00:24:01,554 --> 00:24:03,554
Now Mr...

152
00:25:02,214 --> 00:25:04,825
...is tracking the satellite.

153
00:25:04,925 --> 00:25:07,669
But we do not have much time to report...

154
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:11,281
A tsunami alert.
- James I already did.

155
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:15,039
The warning is being given at this time.

156
00:25:15,828 --> 00:25:18,742
We will need the navy, coast
guard, national guard...

157
00:25:18,842 --> 00:25:22,564
...and all we can when this thing hit...

158
00:25:23,202 --> 00:25:26,979
How long do we have
- I can see.

159
00:25:27,406 --> 00:25:28,520
No time.

160
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,045
Hand me the alert center readers
are going to need SNA.

161
00:25:32,145 --> 00:25:35,248
We have to find out how
fast this thing moves.

162
00:25:35,348 --> 00:25:39,683
And send me all the information
we need to move fast.

163
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:42,208
Sir and vessels are at sea?

164
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:45,342
The boats are well, the
Tsunami is dangerous...

165
00:25:45,442 --> 00:25:47,360
...only when it reaches the coast.

166
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,435
Ships at sea should not be affected.

167
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:55,847
That's not entirely true captain
of the surface ships maybe yes.

168
00:25:55,947 --> 00:25:58,531
But everything below will
be affected particularly...

169
00:25:58,631 --> 00:26:00,172
...throughout the north Atlantic...

170
00:26:00,272 --> 00:26:02,584
Ice?
- Exactly.

171
00:26:02,684 --> 00:26:06,652
There may be a layer of ice beneath the
surface in several feet produndidad.

172
00:26:06,752 --> 00:26:08,991
So if the wave strikes, can push.

173
00:26:09,091 --> 00:26:10,950
Okay.

174
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,086
Abo, listen.

175
00:26:13,186 --> 00:26:15,577
We need to send a warning.

176
00:26:15,677 --> 00:26:21,427
All the ships of the Atlantic tell them
not to come to any signs of ice.

177
00:26:21,527 --> 00:26:24,563
Again tell them to stay away
from the ice blocks...

178
00:26:24,663 --> 00:26:28,234
Consider it done James
- And one more thing...

179
00:26:28,334 --> 00:26:32,972
Do you also have a view on the Titanic?.
- We are monitoring all James...

180
00:26:33,072 --> 00:26:34,914
What you need
- check what is the...

181
00:26:35,014 --> 00:26:35,975
...marina in the area...

182
00:26:36,075 --> 00:26:39,590
Check your position
- Copying...

183
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:52,006
Sir, we have redirected.
- Where?

184
00:26:52,106 --> 00:26:57,137
North Latitude 40 Ñ” 45
West Longitude 50 Ñ” 14.

185
00:26:57,237 --> 00:26:59,812
We'll confirm it's okay.

186
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:03,567
Let's move.

187
00:27:15,214 --> 00:27:19,719
Speak the Coast Guard is a Tsunami
alert in the North Atlantic.

188
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:22,744
Again there is a warning...

189
00:27:22,844 --> 00:27:24,623
Captain.

190
00:27:24,723 --> 00:27:30,696
Did you know that the Titanic was warned
six times on icebergs and did nothing?

191
00:27:30,796 --> 00:27:32,338
Ignoring his position was true.

192
00:27:32,438 --> 00:27:35,378
On hate...

193
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:39,218
Nursing.
- Ladies I need one...

194
00:27:39,318 --> 00:27:40,573
...of you in the port...

195
00:27:40,673 --> 00:27:43,343
We are in the midst of an
important conversation.

196
00:27:43,443 --> 00:27:44,443
No matter.

197
00:27:44,543 --> 00:27:47,795
I need one of you to get passengers.

198
00:27:47,895 --> 00:27:49,895
We are on track.

199
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:55,400
Why are escorting passengers
to the lower chambers?

200
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:47,571
Yes sir.

201
00:29:03,489 --> 00:29:06,759
Good evening ladies and gentlemen can
provide me your attention please.

202
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:10,802
All passengers of the Titanic please.

203
00:29:10,902 --> 00:29:13,844
Come by my front door and
go to the elevators.

204
00:29:13,944 --> 00:29:18,545
And go to the ground floor
this is a precaution.

205
00:29:18,645 --> 00:29:20,959
No need to worry thanks...

206
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,682
How long?.
- Just M.

207
00:29:28,782 --> 00:29:31,369
The Coast Guard gave the alert.
- Coast Guard...

208
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:34,730
What the hell caused it?
- An iceberg collapsed...

209
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:38,691
On the coast of Greenland
- We are ready for icebergs.

210
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:43,581
Not the lord but the Tsunami
iceberg coming fast sir.

211
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:49,637
How long?

212
00:29:49,737 --> 00:29:52,797
We are waiting for the Coast Guard.
- Captain, that we...

213
00:29:52,897 --> 00:29:53,739
...will pass under...

214
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:56,583
Do not even feel.
- Coast Guard Captain...

215
00:29:56,683 --> 00:29:57,743
...communication...

216
00:29:57,843 --> 00:30:00,814
Here the Captain Howard.
- Captain James Howard here on.

217
00:30:00,914 --> 00:30:02,281
Maine Coast Guard Captain.

218
00:30:02,381 --> 00:30:04,381
We listened...

219
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:08,854
Do you see any iceberg in your area?
- Mr Negative.

220
00:30:08,954 --> 00:30:13,034
Lord I need to reverse the
direction of your boat.

221
00:30:13,258 --> 00:30:15,258
Mr.

222
00:30:15,828 --> 00:30:19,331
This wave is moving with
incredible strength.

223
00:30:19,431 --> 00:30:22,236
Any ice on the way the wave moves.

224
00:30:23,168 --> 00:30:27,333
I need you to contact the
West as soon as possible.

225
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:30,431
It is the only chance to avoid ice.

226
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:33,876
For God's sake James I know
this looks dangerous.

227
00:30:33,976 --> 00:30:36,248
But I remind you that this is the Titanic II.

228
00:30:36,348 --> 00:30:41,854
Equipped with radar ice that are activated
within a radius of 5 yards.

229
00:30:41,954 --> 00:30:45,436
Hayden this wave travels
at 842 miles per hour.

230
00:30:45,536 --> 00:30:48,766
Now 5 yards will not make a difference.

231
00:30:48,842 --> 00:30:52,400
If any ice will reach you flip the boat.

232
00:30:55,134 --> 00:30:58,194
Do what it says.
How long do we have?

233
00:30:58,671 --> 00:31:02,505
How long for the impact?
- 15 minutes maximum.

234
00:31:03,575 --> 00:31:06,282
They have 15 minutes maximum.

235
00:31:07,546 --> 00:31:09,546
God...

236
00:31:26,665 --> 00:31:29,392
What is our distance?
- 40 degrees and heading...

237
00:31:29,492 --> 00:31:30,669
...northeast at 30 miles...

238
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:33,048
How long?.
- Mr Anytime...

239
00:31:33,148 --> 00:31:35,698
Shoot. - Lord if you do...
- Do.

240
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:03,118
Mr. 2000... 5000 meters Lord strike us.

241
00:32:06,939 --> 00:32:08,939
Prepare for impact...

242
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:35,407
Captain at 50 knots.
- We're in 40...

243
00:32:35,507 --> 00:32:38,454
It's not fast enough.
- Mr Walsh, I can remember...

244
00:32:38,554 --> 00:32:40,776
The engines are not well tested yet...

245
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:43,860
If the press...
- They have been built...

246
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,000
...to withstand speed...

247
00:32:49,181 --> 00:32:53,254
Put them in 50.
- Yes sir...

248
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:00,809
Put in 50 knots
- Yes sir.

249
00:33:15,707 --> 00:33:19,914
All to please the ground floor
there is no need to panic...

250
00:33:20,014 --> 00:33:22,214
Madeleine.
- People are going crazy...

251
00:33:22,314 --> 00:33:25,289
What?
- You think climate caution...

252
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:29,002
Is all this fuss about the weather?.
- That's all they told me.

253
00:33:29,102 --> 00:33:31,102
If something is wrong.

254
00:33:58,183 --> 00:34:00,183
We answer Amy.

255
00:34:03,755 --> 00:34:06,202
Hello, just call Amy Maine leave
a message after the tone.

256
00:34:06,302 --> 00:34:08,761
Amy talks to you about your dad, listen.

257
00:34:08,861 --> 00:34:14,199
Something is happening, there is a tsunami
that will go through the North Atlantic.

258
00:34:14,299 --> 00:34:18,437
Your boat will reach in a few minutes
I want you to pay attention.

259
00:34:18,537 --> 00:34:20,846
Away from the ground floor.

260
00:34:21,106 --> 00:34:23,750
There are chunks of ice in your direction.

261
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:27,845
Take as many people as possible
to higher levels.

262
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:32,671
Stay in the center of the boat.

263
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:38,773
And if something happens, permance
calm and get on a lifeboat...

264
00:34:39,825 --> 00:34:42,885
Be careful honey.
- Is your daughter?

265
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:47,127
Yes, a nurse.
- Lord.

266
00:34:47,227 --> 00:34:49,522
We have very little fuel M.

267
00:34:50,702 --> 00:34:52,581
Where you can stock up?
- In the Canadian coast...

268
00:34:52,681 --> 00:34:56,047
In the San Juan hub.
- Take us there faster.

269
00:34:56,147 --> 00:34:58,147
Yes sir...

270
00:35:03,015 --> 00:35:06,500
We are at 50 knots Captain.
- Very well...

271
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:16,338
Lord lost the first mover.
- Turn it off...

272
00:35:16,438 --> 00:35:18,201
We can not.
- We can not lose the other.

273
00:35:18,301 --> 00:35:20,681
We can not stop this ship...

274
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:30,987
This boat has three engines.
- Do you want to...

275
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,244
...fly the other 3?

276
00:35:32,344 --> 00:35:35,025
We both know that the
engines have not been...

277
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:37,449
...properly installed, have to be cooled...

278
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:38,771
Turbines.
- The turbine will...

279
00:35:38,871 --> 00:35:39,751
...consume more fuel.

280
00:35:39,851 --> 00:35:41,851
We can not let go slow.

281
00:35:53,165 --> 00:35:55,165
We are adrift.

282
00:36:03,442 --> 00:36:06,332
We turn on the alarm being dragged.

283
00:36:08,914 --> 00:36:11,464
Keep calm happens all the time.

284
00:36:13,018 --> 00:36:16,154
Happens all the time make
it right and climb...

285
00:36:16,254 --> 00:36:18,279
...the pattern is well.

286
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:22,854
Attention, Captain speaking.

287
00:36:23,328 --> 00:36:26,354
All passengers please lifejackets.

288
00:36:27,265 --> 00:36:30,471
All passengers please lifejackets.

289
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:34,056
This is not a drill I repeat, not a drill.

290
00:36:34,773 --> 00:36:37,367
Attention, attention.

291
00:36:38,076 --> 00:36:39,337
Your captain speaking.

292
00:36:39,437 --> 00:36:42,757
All passengers please lifejackets.

293
00:36:43,515 --> 00:36:46,761
All passengers please lifejackets.

294
00:36:46,861 --> 00:36:50,261
This is not a drill,
I repeat not a drill.

295
00:36:52,391 --> 00:36:55,791
This is not a drill,
I repeat not a drill.

296
00:36:59,965 --> 00:37:03,846
I know the same thing I'm sorry
you'll find information.

297
00:37:03,946 --> 00:37:06,496
Talk to them and let you know.

298
00:37:06,596 --> 00:37:08,881
No, no panic stop.

299
00:37:37,369 --> 00:37:39,369
Captain.

300
00:38:03,662 --> 00:38:05,662
Everybody Moving...

301
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:08,608
A starboard now
- We hit.

302
00:38:56,214 --> 00:38:59,352
Maidem, maidem this is the
Titanic II calling the U.S.

303
00:38:59,452 --> 00:39:00,452
Coast Guard.

304
00:39:00,552 --> 00:39:04,977
Maidem, maidem this is the
Titanic II calling the U.S.

305
00:39:05,077 --> 00:39:06,958
Coast Guard.

306
00:39:07,058 --> 00:39:09,021
Titanic II, Captain James
Maine speaks of the U.S.

307
00:39:09,121 --> 00:39:09,634
Coast Guard...

308
00:39:09,734 --> 00:39:14,447
What is your situation?
- Mr collided with an iceberg...

309
00:39:14,547 --> 00:39:18,593
We need immediate assistance.
- Captain I think we...

310
00:39:18,693 --> 00:39:20,693
...have another problem.

311
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,130
We filled it with water.

312
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:57,290
All the bow water is filling up fast.

313
00:39:57,442 --> 00:40:01,856
That will cut the power
to lower the lifeboats...

314
00:40:02,747 --> 00:40:04,747
How many?
- Of all...

315
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:07,819
We have a dinghy.
- And the boats tied?

316
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:10,355
They are small or even float...

317
00:40:10,455 --> 00:40:12,075
The little pot.
- They were not designed...

318
00:40:12,175 --> 00:40:13,125
...to withstand a collision...

319
00:40:13,225 --> 00:40:17,662
Not anticipate being beaten by his side.
- What is he saying?

320
00:40:17,762 --> 00:40:19,762
We must continue...

321
00:40:20,065 --> 00:40:23,835
If we keep filling our water we will sink.
- How long?

322
00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:26,740
2 hours, maybe three.
- What else?

323
00:40:28,673 --> 00:40:30,673
We sink...

324
00:40:32,043 --> 00:40:36,588
Prepare all is well and evacuate
all the boats that we have.

325
00:40:36,688 --> 00:40:38,728
Women and children first.

326
00:40:39,951 --> 00:40:43,011
It seems that history repeats itself.

327
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:09,781
Mr Walsh have to remove it.
Come on, we need him to safety.

328
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:11,881
Let...

329
00:41:26,931 --> 00:41:29,736
Between sir.
- And the passengers?

330
00:41:30,402 --> 00:41:32,541
We have to upload the fix.

331
00:41:52,223 --> 00:41:56,861
Listen to me, goes to most people
as possible in the helicopter...

332
00:41:56,961 --> 00:41:59,931
Mr Walsh is the procedure
- the procedure I do not care...

333
00:42:00,031 --> 00:42:02,807
It's my boat, do it
- Yes sir.

334
00:42:04,736 --> 00:42:07,286
Okay, you catch me out of here.

335
00:42:17,716 --> 00:42:19,716
Arise.

336
00:42:24,789 --> 00:42:28,541
I have received under the glacier activity.

337
00:42:28,641 --> 00:42:30,766
Near the area of collapse.

338
00:42:30,962 --> 00:42:34,447
If successful will mean that unstable ice.

339
00:42:34,566 --> 00:42:36,566
What are you saying?

340
00:42:37,135 --> 00:42:38,621
If collapses.

341
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:41,089
A greater mass of ice fall into the Atlantic.

342
00:42:41,189 --> 00:42:45,143
Creating a mega tsunami toward
the Atlantic Coast.

343
00:42:45,243 --> 00:42:47,243
How big?

344
00:42:48,813 --> 00:42:51,950
Everything in its path will be devastated.

345
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:55,705
We have to get people out of the Titanic II.

346
00:42:59,391 --> 00:43:01,095
James we have a rescue squad.

347
00:43:01,195 --> 00:43:04,170
The marina is 40 miles west of them.

348
00:43:04,262 --> 00:43:07,098
They will find the Titanic in an hour.

349
00:43:07,198 --> 00:43:10,185
That boat does not have an hour.

350
00:43:10,285 --> 00:43:14,572
We need planes and helicopters
in the area immediately.

351
00:43:14,672 --> 00:43:18,072
Captain of the Titanic have enough boats.

352
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:22,714
We may not have seen the
end of this collapse...

353
00:43:22,814 --> 00:43:28,254
...if there is another wave, these
boats will not change anything.

354
00:43:28,653 --> 00:43:31,288
And my daughter is in that boat.

355
00:43:34,092 --> 00:43:36,092
I understand.

356
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:46,681
Everyone calm.

357
00:43:46,781 --> 00:43:50,014
No, please sir.

358
00:43:50,475 --> 00:43:53,774
Let me let go...

359
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,159
Lord have to go back.
- Please Lord ago.

360
00:43:59,884 --> 00:44:01,884
Come women we.

361
00:44:03,755 --> 00:44:05,139
Sorry we have to go.

362
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:08,318
Madeline helps...

363
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,727
Amy.
- Come.

364
00:44:12,163 --> 00:44:14,163
Let me help you.

365
00:44:16,901 --> 00:44:18,901
Ladies first.

366
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:22,073
No, I'm staying here I'll stay.

367
00:44:22,407 --> 00:44:24,407
One more go.

368
00:44:25,176 --> 00:44:27,176
Only women...

369
00:44:54,205 --> 00:44:56,205
How far?
- 30 minutes Mr.

370
00:44:57,008 --> 00:44:57,942
We will supply us.

371
00:44:58,042 --> 00:45:01,697
There's a boat on the way
if we do not reach.

372
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:05,283
It is good that we refuel
and go back to the boat.

373
00:45:05,383 --> 00:45:07,383
Yes sir.

374
00:45:08,353 --> 00:45:10,353
Patterson.

375
00:45:22,734 --> 00:45:24,734
Gone.

376
00:45:30,642 --> 00:45:34,807
I want to put them all aircraft
that we fly now...

377
00:45:34,913 --> 00:45:36,913
Mr.
- What?

378
00:45:38,216 --> 00:45:40,341
I think this has to do...

379
00:45:42,387 --> 00:45:45,754
This is a pre-existing right.
- No, sir.

380
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:49,125
Is twice.

381
00:46:09,547 --> 00:46:11,297
I need another group of
women going around here.

382
00:46:11,397 --> 00:46:14,284
We girls have to take them out.

383
00:46:14,752 --> 00:46:16,752
Put on lifejackets...

384
00:46:17,488 --> 00:46:19,783
I have to go...
- Sign in...

385
00:46:20,058 --> 00:46:21,779
Come on ladies.
- Madeline...

386
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:25,874
Where is Kelli?
- I have not seen, is in nursing.

387
00:46:26,197 --> 00:46:28,197
I'll see...

388
00:46:31,436 --> 00:46:33,436
Get off me.
- Amy...

389
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:36,020
Are you okay? - Yes I'm okay
- You have to go on a boat.

390
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,823
No I have to go to the nurse
I think Kelly is there.

391
00:46:37,923 --> 00:46:39,918
It's in the basement will not get last time.

392
00:46:40,018 --> 00:46:42,313
I will not go without it...

393
00:46:43,147 --> 00:46:46,802
Okay I'll go with you.
- It's all your fault.

394
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:48,871
What is it, Get off me.

395
00:46:48,971 --> 00:46:54,359
There are more important things like
wear a life jacket and board a boat...

396
00:46:54,459 --> 00:46:56,459
Are you okay?
- Yes, we.

397
00:47:03,801 --> 00:47:05,801
I know another way...

398
00:47:38,469 --> 00:47:40,790
Kelly.
- God.

399
00:47:41,072 --> 00:47:43,072
Kelly...

400
00:47:46,177 --> 00:47:48,697
It hurts.
- Okay we will remove you.

401
00:47:48,797 --> 00:47:50,220
Hence we will remove you'll be fine...

402
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,901
Only resists

403
00:47:52,001 --> 00:47:54,976
Press the wound.

00:47:55,253 --> 00:47:57,253
Okay.

405
00:47:58,256 --> 00:47:59,691
Hurry.

406

I need a card...

407
00:48:08,166 --> 00:48:11,057
Cover the wound. - Yes
- Do.

408
00:48:11,157 --> 00:48:14,253
Let's hurry.

409
00:48:15,139 --> 00:48:16,827
Where is the tape?
'Where's the tape?

410
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:20,784
You have to relax Kelly, resists.

411
00:48:20,884 --> 00:48:22,884

00:48:28,886 --> 00:48:31,821
You'll be fine.
- You have to hurry.

414
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:34,990
Breathe...

415
00:48:35,526 --> 00:48:38,161
Kelly are you okay?.
- Stay here.

416
00:48:40,131 --> 00:48:42,131
We need you out of here.

417
00:48:44,335 --> 00:48:47,480
Put your arm around me You'll be fine.

418
00:48:49,474 --> 00:48:51,939
We shall produce from here...

419
00:48:52,777 --> 00:48:56,092
Are there any boats?
- We have to let go.

420
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:14,630
Help, please.

421
00:49:16,901 --> 00:49:19,142
Carefully.

422
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:34,815
Chief Engineer Speaks Daniels if anyone
here I can hear the turbine hall.

423
00:49:43,895 --> 00:49:47,570
Let's hurry up, we all come, come.

424
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,531
Sign in...

425
00:49:49,631 --> 00:49:53,541
If someone else has to go with you
- Yes sir...

426
00:49:54,105 --> 00:49:58,212
Are you okay?
- Yes.

427
00:50:46,023 --> 00:50:49,299

428
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,800
Please.
- Are all inside?

429
00:50:55,733 --> 00:50:57,837
Hold on strong.

430
00:51:08,312 --> 00:51:10,621
What was that? Carefully...

431
00:51:14,185 --> 00:51:17,688
Is there another way?
- Yes, we can use the elevators...

432
00:51:17,788 --> 00:51:20,253
Elevators?
- We have no choice.

433
00:51:33,437 --> 00:51:35,987
U.S. Coast Guard to Titanic II.

434
00:51:37,208 --> 00:51:39,208
U.S.
Coast Guard to the.

435
00:51:39,259 --> 00:51:41,259
Titanic II, change.

436
00:51:43,047 --> 00:51:47,484
Again the U.S.
Coast Guard to Titanic II.

437
00:51:47,785 --> 00:51:49,785
Change...

438
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:57,170
Captain Maine.
- Captain, talk.

439
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:59,822
We are sinking.

440
00:52:01,532 --> 00:52:05,527
Captain has to get his people
from the lifeboats.

441
00:52:06,437 --> 00:52:08,817
Half of the boats have been evacuated.

442
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,182
The lifeboats are traps.

443
00:52:30,528 --> 00:52:32,528
Enter.

444
00:52:38,736 --> 00:52:42,137
I understand Captain comes another wave.

445
00:53:07,698 --> 00:53:09,698
God does not.

446
00:53:18,376 --> 00:53:20,376
Are you there?

447
00:53:21,512 --> 00:53:23,512
Captain.

448
00:53:24,882 --> 00:53:27,180
Lord's time to resupply.

449
00:53:40,965 --> 00:53:44,514
We must do this fast friends...

450
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:49,264
...6565's copy.
- Roger.

451
00:54:00,785 --> 00:54:02,785
Mr.

452
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:09,958
My God...

453
00:54:11,395 --> 00:54:14,625
We must go up.
- Climb, climb repeat...

454
00:55:43,821 --> 00:55:46,005
Baby you okay?
- If...

455
00:55:48,058 --> 00:55:50,098
Kelly are you okay?.
- If.

456
00:55:54,965 --> 00:55:56,965
Take my shirt.

457
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:01,670
What happened?

458
00:56:03,007 --> 00:56:06,343
I do not know, I think they flew turbines.

459
00:56:06,443 --> 00:56:09,526
Everything will collapse...

460
00:56:10,581 --> 00:56:14,452
You're bleeding. - I'm fine.
- I have to get points.

461
00:56:14,552 --> 00:56:17,146
I'll tell you if we leave it alive.

462
00:56:17,246 --> 00:56:21,751
I'll let me put all the points
you want, we have to go.

463
00:56:21,926 --> 00:56:24,731
Put your foot in my hands, let...

464
00:56:25,496 --> 00:56:29,899
On the count of three list.
- One. two... three...

465
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:36,425
Push it going, keep pushing.
- You are stuck.

466
00:56:39,977 --> 00:56:43,207
It should have collapsed this is wrong.

467
00:56:53,724 --> 00:56:55,724
My cell phone.

468
00:56:56,493 --> 00:56:59,155
My dad, answer.

469
00:57:02,399 --> 00:57:05,550
Dad
- Amy...

470
00:57:06,403 --> 00:57:10,260
Are you in a lifeboat?
- No, we are caught.

471
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:14,353
The ship is sinking How do you catch?

472
00:57:15,479 --> 00:57:19,134
Kelly Hayden and I are stuck in an elevator.

473
00:57:21,452 --> 00:57:25,422
Hear, hear help is on the way.

474
00:57:25,789 --> 00:57:27,789
I also.

475
00:57:28,259 --> 00:57:31,829
I want them to stay away
from the lifeboats...

476
00:57:31,929 --> 00:57:34,819
Do not get any.
- What do you mean?

477
00:57:36,934 --> 00:57:40,571
CariÑ

478
00:57:40,671 --> 00:57:43,849
This really is the worst.
- What?

479
00:57:43,949 --> 00:57:48,255
When it wipe out everything
including lifeboats.

480
00:57:48,355 --> 00:57:50,355
Not survive.

481
00:57:52,449 --> 00:57:55,600
Your best bet is to stay in the boat.

482
00:57:56,220 --> 00:58:01,271
You can flip but it is strong
and the wave drag is not.

483
00:58:03,093 --> 00:58:05,388
James 'how long do we have?

484

Okay, we will resist until we get there.

488
00:58:24,348 --> 00:58:27,833
Once I did think you were
an honorable man.

489
00:58:29,486 --> 00:58:33,056
Let me think again my daughter is there...

490
00:58:36,026 --> 00:58:39,814

Do as I say and you will be well...

492
00:58:45,402 --> 00:58:48,292
If we do not?
- Not even mention it.

493
00:58:48,539 --> 00:58:51,702
Okay we'll get there baby on the way.

494
00:58:53,344 --> 00:58:55,344
Goodbye Dad.

495
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:06,492
James, if you do what
you say has a chance.

496
00:59:07,291 --> 00:59:09,291
Yes.

497
00:59:14,331 --> 00:59:16,331
Care...

498
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:20,127
Get out of here.
- We will remove you.

499
00:59:36,954 --> 00:59:38,954
Give me your hands...

500
00:59:44,661 --> 00:59:46,310

You have to hurry up.

01:00:52,429 --> 01:00:54,429

The door is locked.

516
01:01:33,103 --> 01:01:37,244
Supposedly.
- Is to protect the boats.

517
01:01:53,524 --> 01:01:55,524
Fast Pass.

518
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,829

Spend.

520
01:02:03,867 --> 01:02:06,077
I can not spend too narrow.

521
01:02:06,703 --> 01:02:08,703

522
01:02:08,739 --> 01:02:10,274
Let.

523
01:02:10,374 --> 01:02:12,374
We will be closed.

524
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:14,910
Let.

525
01:02:19,883 --> 01:02:23,330

532
01:03:08,131 --> 01:03:11,055
We must go, please.

533
01:03:11,768 --> 01:03:14,063
If we have died for nothing.

534
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,080
Come on, get out of here.

535
01:03:25,582 --> 01:03:27,582
Waiting.

01:03:31,655 --> 01:03:33,655
Let.

537
01:03:51,608 --> 01:03:53,733
The ship is falling apart.

538
01:03:56,013 --> 01:04:00,688
We fry them, we must think
in a way we can not return...

539
01:04:06,056 --> 01:04:09,760
We will have to go up
- What would you change that?

540
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:13,375
Until we touch the wires or the ground.

541
01:04:14,297 --> 01:04:16,507
We do not electrocute a...

542
01:04:18,468 --> 01:04:19,948
Do not know.
- You are a nurse.

543
01:04:20,048 --> 01:04:23,788
I am not technical I do not know electricity.

544
01:04:24,775 --> 01:04:27,580
There is only one way to find out.

545
01:05:16,993 --> 01:05:18,085
Let's your turn.

546
01:05:18,185 --> 01:05:21,447
I do not know if I can not
know if I can jump as high.

547
01:05:21,547 --> 01:05:23,006
Amy can do it we have to hurry.

548
01:05:23,106 --> 01:05:24,743

Let your dad come soon Amy...

550

Hurry please.

564
01:06:28,832 --> 01:06:30,832
Give me your hand.

I'll leave you where did your
father and come to aydudarles...

574
01:07:15,355 --> 01:07:18,670
No, we do not have time for that.

575
01:07:19,249 --> 01:07:21,249

582
01:07:48,578 --> 01:07:50,578
Curse...

01:08:05,428 --> 01:08:09,080
Damn, I can not.
- It is stifling.

584
01:08:10,233 --> 01:08:14,568

I killed him
- Hayden's not your fault...

589
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:59,266
It's my fault
- Listen Hayden.

590
01:09:01,451 --> 01:09:04,431
I made a promise to my father.

591
01:09:06,723 --> 01:09:09,339
Now come on, move.

592

01:09:36,619 --> 01:09:40,236
What now?
- We came here for you...

596
01:09:40,336 --> 01:09:43,660
Quick put this on. - And you?
- Do not worry about me...

597
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:46,395
The water is frozen
- Put it Amy.

598
01:09:48,732 --> 01:09:50,732
Hurry.

599
01:09:54,237 --> 01:09:56,876

600
01:09:58,475 --> 01:10:00,475
'Hurry?

601
01:10:03,646 --> 01:10:05,646
Arms.

602
01:10:18,328 --> 01:10:20,328
We have to go...

603
01:11:35,405 --> 01:11:36,856
How much is missing?
- We are close to Mr.

604
01:11:36,956 --> 01:11:39,931
Within 30 miles of the east side...

605
01:11:39,943 --> 01:11:42,696
Think I'll make it
- We are near.

606
01:11:47,584 --> 01:11:49,584
Amy you ok?

607
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:53,550
Yes What happened?

608
01:11:54,491 --> 01:11:57,767
We headed the ship is upside down...

609
01:11:58,061 --> 01:12:00,450
Can you move?
- Yes.

610
01:12:01,464 --> 01:12:03,464
We have to go, stop...

611
01:12:09,772 --> 01:12:12,237
Give me your hand.
- Is frozen.

612
01:12:13,376 --> 01:12:16,011
We have to go give me your hand.

613
01:12:16,713 --> 01:12:18,713
Are you okay?
- Yes...

614
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:28,000
Something is blocking the door.
- What can we do?

615
01:12:34,097 --> 01:12:38,073
The water will rise faster
- Everything will be under...

616
01:12:38,173 --> 01:12:39,602
...water in 5 minutes.

617
01:12:39,702 --> 01:12:41,702
You have to get it.

618
01:12:42,539 --> 01:12:45,167
Amy Turn around.

619
01:12:47,210 --> 01:12:49,210
You have to leave...

620
01:12:54,417 --> 01:12:57,108
Those are the planes?
- Yes if you came...

621
01:12:57,208 --> 01:12:58,288
...to the room dive.

622
01:12:58,388 --> 01:13:00,388
They will be there.

623
01:13:06,462 --> 01:13:08,462
No good.

624
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:14,397
Each unit has a diving emergency tracker...

625
01:13:15,538 --> 01:13:18,141
How it works
- have a tracking signal.

626
01:13:18,241 --> 01:13:21,017
A low frequency we have.

627
01:13:23,913 --> 01:13:24,920
Hayden is frozen water.

628
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:28,030
I'll keep you warm.

629
01:13:29,752 --> 01:13:32,607
Do you?

630
01:13:34,424 --> 01:13:38,674
I think the temperature is
the least of my concerns.

631
01:13:43,066 --> 01:13:46,211
Lord I have a low frequency signal...

632
01:13:46,302 --> 01:13:49,624
Seems to come from the Titanic II
- Mira.

633
01:13:58,348 --> 01:14:00,348
How to get there?

634
01:14:02,051 --> 01:14:04,346
Listen, I take off the suit.

635
01:14:04,413 --> 01:14:07,470
Why? I use it not Forget.

636
01:14:07,570 --> 01:14:09,570
Freeze to death.

637
01:14:09,859 --> 01:14:11,859
First I'll drown.

638
01:14:12,629 --> 01:14:15,610
We will share the oxygen
tank to keep breathing...

639
01:14:15,710 --> 01:14:19,999
No. - Why?
- Freeze to death anyway.

640
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:22,970
So what's your plan?

641
01:14:26,643 --> 01:14:29,988
Listen, this boat has air bags.

642
01:14:30,647 --> 01:14:32,647
Caught.

643
01:14:33,049 --> 01:14:37,611
Stop the sinking air that will give me.

644
01:14:39,188 --> 01:14:41,873
Breathe deep and try to get...

645
01:14:43,092 --> 01:14:44,739
Wait...
- Insurance and picked...

646
01:14:44,839 --> 01:14:45,628
...up your signal...

647
01:14:45,728 --> 01:14:46,842
Wait.
- You can find...

648
01:14:46,942 --> 01:14:49,237
What about you?
- I'll drown.

649
01:14:49,966 --> 01:14:52,810
If they can survive rapid...

650
01:14:53,369 --> 01:14:56,783
No. - It is the only way
- No, Hayden.

651
01:14:56,883 --> 01:14:59,224
Listen, be wise.

652
01:14:59,324 --> 01:15:03,371
If we share the tank will die anyway.

653
01:15:03,746 --> 01:15:05,786
And half of the air will.

654
01:15:06,949 --> 01:15:08,949
I swear can relive.

655
01:15:08,956 --> 01:15:12,649
You have more chance of survival.

656
01:15:13,923 --> 01:15:15,963
But I do not like you...

657
01:15:21,064 --> 01:15:23,430
This is my fault.
- No.

658
01:15:25,201 --> 01:15:27,581
Come on, give me your arm...

659
01:15:45,154 --> 01:15:48,299
What is your plan?
- I have to find...

660
01:15:48,391 --> 01:15:52,131
How will you know where?
- No need to know...

661
01:15:52,929 --> 01:15:57,184
James if the ship sinks,
the pressure will increase.

662
01:15:57,284 --> 01:15:58,368
I know...

663
01:15:58,468 --> 01:16:03,398
Everything that is below...
- Yes, you have to take care...

664
01:16:03,773 --> 01:16:08,278
Here, take the end of it, and let me go
- What's this?

665
01:16:08,444 --> 01:16:12,551
To find the way back there
you have 1000 feet.

666
01:16:13,049 --> 01:16:15,734
Just let it go I'll be fine...

667
01:16:19,856 --> 01:16:22,140
What if the string ends?
- I'll be dead...

668
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:24,898
Then cut the rope.
- M. Ready.

669
01:16:26,362 --> 01:16:28,362
Now...

670
01:16:38,508 --> 01:16:41,466
Hayden
- Sorry...

671
01:16:43,045 --> 01:16:47,641
No holding out.
- No, no, no.

672
01:16:49,218 --> 01:16:53,382
Amy, I did what did you
do what you gotta do...

673
01:16:56,626 --> 01:16:58,626
Yes
- Then I wake up.

674
01:17:07,503 --> 01:17:09,585
Put it.

675
01:17:23,853 --> 01:17:25,853
Put the controller.

676
01:18:33,489 --> 01:18:35,489
You'll have to jump.

677
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:42,720
There is a lifesaving equipment
you have to hurry back...

678
01:18:43,766 --> 01:18:46,246
What about you?
- I will do my.

679
01:18:46,636 --> 01:18:48,636
Go.

680
01:18:53,042 --> 01:18:55,044
You have to hurry, jump.

681
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:39,900
Post it...

682
01:22:44,173 --> 01:22:46,173
...1... 2...

683
01:22:50,246 --> 01:22:52,246
Hayden Resist.

684
01:22:55,417 --> 01:22:57,417
We breathe.

685
01:23:07,763 --> 01:23:09,763
We Hayden.

686
01:23:22,978 --> 01:23:24,978
Hayden breathes.

687
01:23:34,390 --> 01:23:36,390
Damn.

688
01:23:36,492 --> 01:23:38,492
Breathe.

689
01:23:40,629 --> 01:23:42,629
We Hayden.

690
01:23:47,570 --> 01:23:49,570
We Hayden.

691
01:24:06,055 --> 01:24:08,055
Breathe.

692
01:24:10,993 --> 01:24:14,326
Hayden Breathe, breathe,
we breathe.

693
01:24:18,634 --> 01:24:20,634
Hayden, no.

694
01:24:24,907 --> 01:24:26,907
We Hayden.
