1
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,956
<i>Before time began...</i>

2
00:00:54,957 --> 00:00:57,270
<i>There was The Cube.</i>

3
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:01,595
<i>We know not where it comes from.
Only that it holds</i>

4
00:01:01,596 --> 00:01:06,323
<i>the power to create worlds,
and fill them with life.</i>

5
00:01:06,827 --> 00:01:09,844
<i>That is how our race was born.</i>

6
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:12,359
<i>For a time we lived in harmony.</i>

7
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,472
<i>But like all great power...</i>

8
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:17,288
<i>Some wanted it for good...</i>

9
00:01:17,388 --> 00:01:19,401
<i>Others for evil.</i>

10
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:22,418
<i>And so began The War.</i>

11
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,650
<i>A war that ravaged our planet
until it was consumed by death.</i>

12
00:01:28,152 --> 00:01:32,780
<i>And The Cube was lost to
the far reaches of space.</i>

13
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:39,519
<i>We scattered across the galaxy,
hoping to find it and rebuild our home.</i>

14
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,543
<i>Searching every star, every world...</i>

15
00:01:44,449 --> 00:01:47,567
<i>And just when all hope seemed lost...</i>

16
00:01:47,768 --> 00:01:52,898
<i>Message of a new discovery
took us to an unknown planet called...</i>

17
00:01:53,603 --> 00:01:55,614
<i>Earth.</i>

18
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:04,467
<i>But we were already too late...</i>

19
00:02:17,745 --> 00:02:21,266
Oh God, four months of this...
Can't wait to get a little taste of home.

20
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:26,003
Play with mama's alligators...
- You've been talking about barbecued

21
00:02:26,003 --> 00:02:29,338
gators and crickets for the last 2 weeks.
I'm never going to your mama's house, Vic,

22
00:02:29,338 --> 00:02:30,220
I promise.

23
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,337
Bobby, gators are known to have
the most secular meat.

24
00:02:33,338 --> 00:02:35,149
I understand.

25
00:02:38,093 --> 00:02:39,195
English, please.

26
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:40,477
English.

27
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,641
I mean how many times...
We don't speak Spanish. I told ya--

28
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,564
You ruin it for me, man.
That's my heritage...

29
00:02:48,265 --> 00:02:50,309
Okay, fine. Go with the Spanish,
whatever.

30
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,852
Hey you guys remember weekends?

31
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,976
Sox and Filmway, cold hotdog
and flat beer?

32
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,988
Perfect day...

33
00:02:59,592 --> 00:03:02,308
What about you captain?
You got a perfect day?

34
00:03:02,811 --> 00:03:05,326
I just can't wait to hold
my baby girl for the first time.

35
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:08,227
Shut up.

36
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:39,327
Watch this crossover man,
like Jordan in his prime...

37
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:43,250
Step aside mates.

38
00:03:43,954 --> 00:03:45,966
Danny!
- Hey, what are you doing?

39
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,790
Water?

40
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:50,794
Thank you.
Are you gonna help me with the gear?

41
00:03:57,735 --> 00:04:00,954
Colonel Sharp, we have an inbound
unidentified infiltrator.

42
00:04:00,955 --> 00:04:02,865
10 miles out.

43
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:11,214
Unidentified aircraft, you are in
restricted US military airspace.

44
00:04:11,215 --> 00:04:14,434
Walk indent, and proceed East out of the area.

45
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:20,167
Raptors 1 and 2, snap to
heading 250 and intercept.

46
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:22,883
Bogey's in the weeds,
10 miles out, not squawking.

47
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:32,641
Unidentified aircraft, we will
escort you to US SOCCENT airbase.

48
00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:36,061
If you do not comply,
we will use deadly force.

49
00:04:37,873 --> 00:04:41,393
<i>Copy on the bogey.
Tail, 4500 X-ray.</i>

50
00:04:41,996 --> 00:04:44,511
Sir, it says here 4500X
was shot down 3 months ago.

51
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:45,233
Afghanistan.

52
00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:47,932
That's got to be a mistake,
check again and recheck.

53
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:50,087
I did, sir. Friend of mine
was on that chopper.

54
00:04:51,185 --> 00:04:54,606
<i>Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT.<i/></i>

55
00:04:57,488 --> 00:04:59,902
Radar, where's the inbound?
- Bogey's 5 miles out sir.

56
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,806
My wife phoned?
- Yes, captain.

57
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,257
Hi my ladies!

58
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:12,275
Oh my goodness, look at her,
she's getting so big.

59
00:05:12,276 --> 00:05:14,361
Look at those cheeks,
I just want to chew on them.

60
00:05:15,394 --> 00:05:17,104
Baby we've got a
good looking kid.

61
00:05:17,105 --> 00:05:19,316
I know that people say
that all the time...

62
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:21,831
Wow, we made one good looking kid.
Nice work.

63
00:05:21,832 --> 00:05:24,649
She has your laugh.
- She laughs?

64
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,560
Her first one, yeah.

65
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:27,462
You look--

66
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,477
Are you sure she
didn't just fart?

67
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:31,589
No, she's a lady.

68
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,903
She doesn't know you yet,
but she will.

69
00:05:35,714 --> 00:05:37,826
4500X, something's not right.

70
00:05:43,624 --> 00:05:44,614
<i>Bogey's on the deck.<i/></i>

71
00:05:45,296 --> 00:05:46,902
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa..

72
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:48,791
Radar's jammed.

73
00:05:49,696 --> 00:05:51,406
It's coming from the chopper.

74
00:05:51,957 --> 00:05:54,035
Well--
- Sarah..

75
00:05:54,636 --> 00:05:55,637
Hey.

76
00:05:55,637 --> 00:05:57,542
Sarah, if you can hear me,
I love you and I'll be home soon.

77
00:06:01,383 --> 00:06:04,508
<i>Move out, move out!
Check fire! Get your field!<i/></i>

78
00:06:07,904 --> 00:06:11,123
MH53 pilot, power down now.

79
00:06:14,844 --> 00:06:17,359
Have your crew step out
or we will kill you.

80
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,726
<i>Hold your fire! Stand by to engage!<i/></i>

81
00:06:36,673 --> 00:06:38,585
My God...

82
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:57,395
They bombed that ten-oh-four!
We're under attack!

83
00:07:25,624 --> 00:07:27,729
Go! Move, move!

84
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:38,334
They're going after the files!
- Cut the hard lines!

85
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:40,347
I need a key, it's locked!

86
00:08:06,925 --> 00:08:07,878
Behind here!

87
00:08:09,058 --> 00:08:10,068
Oh my god!

88
00:08:26,294 --> 00:08:27,696
What the f...!

89
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:38,691
Epps, let's go!

90
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,977
Ok, Mr. Witwicky you're up.

91
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,240
Sorry, I got a lot of stuff.

92
00:09:04,307 --> 00:09:05,223
Watch.

93
00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:06,786
Okay.

94
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:09,096
For my family gen--

95
00:09:09,473 --> 00:09:11,296
Who did--
Who did that?

96
00:09:11,898 --> 00:09:14,235
People...
Responsibility.

97
00:09:19,532 --> 00:09:21,947
So, for my family genealogy
report, I decided to do it

98
00:09:21,948 --> 00:09:23,858
on my great great grandfather.

99
00:09:24,461 --> 00:09:27,278
Who was a famous man.
Captain Archibald Witwicky.

100
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:30,669
Very famous explorer,
in fact, he was one of the first

101
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:33,107
to explore...

102
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:35,825
The arctic circle,
which is a big deal.

103
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:43,168
In 1897, he took 41 brave
sailors straight into the arctic shelf.

104
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,215
The ice is freezing faster
than it's melting!

105
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,026
Chop faster!

106
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,760
No sacrifice, no victory!

107
00:09:58,761 --> 00:10:01,174
We'll get to the arctic circle, lads!

108
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,393
So that's the story, right?

109
00:10:04,494 --> 00:10:06,908
And here we have some of
the basic instruments and tools

110
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:09,320
used by 19th century seamen.

111
00:10:10,127 --> 00:10:11,851
This here is the quadrant,
which should be around $80 bucks.

112
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:15,920
It's all for sale by the way.
Like the sextant here.

113
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,175
$50 dollars for this,
this is a bargain.

114
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:21,184
These are pretty cool.
These are my grandfather's glasses.

115
00:10:21,192 --> 00:10:23,488
I haven't quite gotten them appraised yet,
but they've seen many cool things.

116
00:10:23,488 --> 00:10:25,719
Are you going to sell me
his liver?

117
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,057
Mr. Witwicky, this isn't show and sell.

118
00:10:28,057 --> 00:10:30,099
It's the 11th grade, I don't
think your grandfather would be

119
00:10:30,099 --> 00:10:32,626
particularly proud of what you're doing.
- I know, I'm sorry. I just--

120
00:10:32,627 --> 00:10:34,378
You know, this all is going toward
my car fund.

121
00:10:34,478 --> 00:10:38,151
You can tell your folks, it's on eBay.
I take PayPal, cold hard cash works too.

122
00:10:38,195 --> 00:10:40,508
And the compass makes a great gift
for Columbus Day.

123
00:10:40,546 --> 00:10:41,747
Sam!
- I'm sorry.

124
00:10:42,118 --> 00:10:44,815
Unfortunately, my great great
grandfather, the genius that he was...

125
00:10:44,816 --> 00:10:47,856
Wound up going blind
and crazy on a psycho ward.

126
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:51,341
Drawing these strange symbols,
and babbling on about some...

127
00:10:51,342 --> 00:10:53,797
Giant ice man that he thought
he discovered...

128
00:10:54,598 --> 00:10:57,887
OK, might be a pop quiz tomorrow,
might not!

129
00:10:58,263 --> 00:10:59,323
Sleep in fear tonight.

130
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,375
$50? $40? $30?
- Sam..

131
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,877
Sorry.. Sorry.

132
00:11:02,935 --> 00:11:04,333
Okay..

133
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:06,964
Pretty good right?

134
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:09,881
I'd say a solid B minus.

135
00:11:12,094 --> 00:11:14,272
A B minus?
- You were hawking your great

136
00:11:14,272 --> 00:11:16,418
grandfather's crap
in my classroom.

137
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:18,158
Look, can you do me a favor?

138
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:20,009
Can you look out the window
for a second and see my father?

139
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,750
He's the guy in the green car.

140
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:24,367
I'll tell you about a dream,
a boy's dream.

141
00:11:24,368 --> 00:11:25,975
And a man's promise to that boy.

142
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:29,128
He looked him in the eyes and said:
"Son, I'm gonna buy you a car.

143
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:32,062
But I want you to bring me
$2,000 dollars and 3 A's."

144
00:11:32,063 --> 00:11:34,437
I got the $2,000 and
I got the 2 A's.

145
00:11:34,437 --> 00:11:38,205
Here's the dream.
Your B minus... dream gone.

146
00:11:38,751 --> 00:11:40,964
Sir, just ask yourself...

147
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,580
What would Jesus do?

148
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,080
Yes!

149
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,560
Well?
- A minus. It's an A though.

150
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,066
Wait, wait, I can't see. It's an A.

151
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:52,434
So I'm good?
- You're good.

152
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:55,891
I got a little surprise
for you son.

153
00:11:55,953 --> 00:11:59,574
What kind of surprise?
- Yeah, little surprise.

154
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:01,304
No...

155
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:03,887
No, no, no, no!
Dad!

156
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:08,331
Oh, you got to be kidding me!
- Yeah, I am.

157
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:09,136
You're not getting a Porsche.

158
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:13,907
You think that's funny?

159
00:12:13,908 --> 00:12:15,951
Yeah, I think it's funny.
- What's wrong with you?

160
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:17,482
What, you think I'd really get you
a Porsche?

161
00:12:18,076 --> 00:12:19,707
For your first car?
- I don't want to talk to you

162
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:20,710
for the rest of my life.

163
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:25,068
Come on, it's just a practical joke.
- It's not a funny joke.

164
00:12:27,568 --> 00:12:30,126
Manny!
- What?

165
00:12:30,127 --> 00:12:33,565
Get your cousin out of that damn clown suit,
he's having a heat stroke again.

166
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:36,740
Scaring away folks.
- I'm hot, makeup's melting, hurts my eyes.

167
00:12:36,741 --> 00:12:38,921
Here? No, no, no,
what is this?

168
00:12:38,922 --> 00:12:41,188
You said half of car,
not half of piece of crap, dad.

169
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:44,385
When I was your age, I'd be happy
with 4 wheels and an engine.

170
00:12:44,386 --> 00:12:46,786
Let me explain something to you.
You ever seen '40 year old virgin'?

171
00:12:46,787 --> 00:12:50,407
That's what this is,
and this is 50 year old virgin.

172
00:12:50,408 --> 00:12:51,949
Okay.
- You want me to live that life?

173
00:12:51,951 --> 00:12:54,469
No sacrifice...
- No victory, you know, I got it.

174
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,600
The old Witwicky motto.

175
00:12:56,113 --> 00:12:57,039
Gentlemen.

176
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,806
Bobby Bolivia, like the country
except without the runts.

177
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,059
How can I help?

178
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,847
Well my son here, is looking
to buy his first car.

179
00:13:06,471 --> 00:13:09,145
You come to see me?
- I had to.

180
00:13:09,146 --> 00:13:12,377
That practically makes us family.
Uncle Bobby B baby.

181
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,525
Uncle Bobby B.
- Sam.

182
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:15,827
Sam. Let me talk to you.

183
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:18,862
Sam, your first enchilada
of freedom...

184
00:13:19,063 --> 00:13:21,095
awaits underneath
one of those hoods.

185
00:13:21,796 --> 00:13:25,006
Let me tell you something son.
A driver don't pick a car.

186
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,780
A car picks the driver.

187
00:13:27,381 --> 00:13:30,476
Some mystical bond between
a man and a machine.

188
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,542
Son, I'm a lot of things,
liar is not one of them.

189
00:13:33,543 --> 00:13:35,373
Especially not in front
of my mammy.

190
00:13:35,374 --> 00:13:37,030
That's my mammy.

191
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:38,547
Hey, mammy!

192
00:13:38,764 --> 00:13:43,116
Oh, don't be like that... If I had a rock,
I'd bust your ass bitch.

193
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,556
She's deaf, you know.

194
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,675
Over here...

195
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,124
Every piece of car man
might want or need.

196
00:13:55,093 --> 00:13:57,680
So it's got racing stripes.
- Yeah, it's got racing...

197
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:02,350
What the heck is this?
I know nothing about this car.

198
00:14:02,552 --> 00:14:04,268
Manny!
- What?

199
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:06,776
What is this?
This car, check it out.

200
00:14:06,777 --> 00:14:08,744
I don't know boss.
I've never seen that.

201
00:14:08,745 --> 00:14:09,746
<i>That's loco!<i/></i>

202
00:14:09,747 --> 00:14:11,583
Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me,
Manny. Find out!

203
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:13,615
Feels good.

204
00:14:16,643 --> 00:14:18,364
How much?
- Well...

205
00:14:20,257 --> 00:14:23,324
Considering the semi classic
nature of the vehicle...

206
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:26,034
With the slick wheel and a
custom paint job--

207
00:14:26,035 --> 00:14:27,520
But the paint's faded.

208
00:14:28,052 --> 00:14:30,960
Yeah, but it's custom.
- It's custom faded?

209
00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:33,166
Well it's your first car,
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

210
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:36,680
$5 grand.
- No, I'm not paying over $4. Sorry.

211
00:14:36,681 --> 00:14:40,280
Kid, come on get out of the car.
- No, you said cars pick their drivers.

212
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,522
Well, sometimes it picks a driver
with a cheap ass father, out of the car.

213
00:14:43,523 --> 00:14:46,244
Now, this one's here $4 G is a beauty.

214
00:14:46,956 --> 00:14:50,839
There's a Fiesta with racing stripes over there.
- No, I don't want a Fiesta racing stripes.

215
00:14:51,896 --> 00:14:55,877
This is a classic engine right here.
I sold a car the other day...

216
00:14:59,103 --> 00:15:01,286
Holy cow. Are you all right?

217
00:15:01,288 --> 00:15:03,519
I guess slugs have might knock
this right out.

218
00:15:03,526 --> 00:15:04,526
Hey, Manny!

219
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:08,928
Get your clown cousin and get some hammers
to come bang this stuff out baby!

220
00:15:11,184 --> 00:15:13,618
That one's my favorite.
It drove all the way from Alabama.

221
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,734
$4,000.

222
00:15:46,472 --> 00:15:47,422
Hello Mr. Secretary.

223
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:53,972
They're so young.
-They're the top subject matter experts, sir.

224
00:15:53,974 --> 00:15:56,268
NSA is recruiting right out of
high schools these days.

225
00:15:56,669 --> 00:16:03,181
Guys, that's the Secretary of Defense.
- I'm so underdressed.

226
00:16:03,181 --> 00:16:05,655
Ladies and gentlemen,
Secretary of Defense.

227
00:16:08,151 --> 00:16:09,358
Please be seated.

228
00:16:10,944 --> 00:16:12,257
I'm John Keller.

229
00:16:12,913 --> 00:16:16,025
Obviously you've wondered why
you're here, so these are the facts.

230
00:16:17,146 --> 00:16:20,931
At 1900 local time yesterday,
SOCCENT forward operations

231
00:16:20,932 --> 00:16:22,273
base in Qatar was attacked.

232
00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:25,312
So far as we know,
there were no survivors.

233
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:28,798
The objective of the attack was
to hack our military network.

234
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,982
We're not sure exactly
what they were after,

235
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,801
but we do know, that they were
cut off during the assault.

236
00:16:35,886 --> 00:16:38,928
Which would leads us to assume
that they're going to try it again.

237
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,848
No one has taken the
responsibility for the attack.

238
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:45,068
And the only real lead
we have so far...

239
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,506
Is this sound.

240
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,554
That's the signal
that hacked our network.

241
00:16:57,646 --> 00:17:00,597
NSA is working at full capacity
to analyze it,

242
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:02,162
and intercept further
communications.

243
00:17:02,163 --> 00:17:04,533
But we need your help
to find out who did this.

244
00:17:05,122 --> 00:17:08,882
You've all shown considerable ability
in the area of signals analysis.

245
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:11,742
We're on a hair trigger here people.

246
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:15,826
The president has dispatched battle
groups to the Arabian Gulf

247
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:18,452
and the Yellow Sea. This is as real
as it ever gonna get.

248
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:21,056
I'm gonna leave you
to your officer in charge,

249
00:17:21,057 --> 00:17:22,844
you break up into teams
and you start your work.

250
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:25,747
Good luck to us all.

251
00:17:34,998 --> 00:17:37,325
Alright, Mojo. I got the car,
now I need a girl.

252
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:42,517
I need money to take out
the girls with what in here.

253
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:45,502
0 bids.

254
00:17:46,171 --> 00:17:48,295
Great, broke.

255
00:17:49,405 --> 00:17:50,852
Come on Mojo,
you want your pain pill?

256
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,604
It's like clockwork.

257
00:18:03,043 --> 00:18:04,276
All right. I know you're wasting
these things,

258
00:18:04,276 --> 00:18:06,353
but if you piss in my bed again,
you're sleeping outside.

259
00:18:07,739 --> 00:18:10,345
That's it for today. No more.
Crack head.

260
00:18:10,348 --> 00:18:14,329
Ron, this one is uneven.
- Yeah, probably.

261
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,345
This one is wobbling.
- Yeah, I'll take care of that.

262
00:18:17,878 --> 00:18:19,765
Couldn't we have hired
a professional?

263
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:21,394
Oh, Sam.
- What?

264
00:18:21,395 --> 00:18:25,179
I do not like footprints on my grass.
- There's no footprints.

265
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:25,913
That's why I built my path.

266
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:28,555
So why don't you go from
my grass on to my path, okay?

267
00:18:28,556 --> 00:18:29,513
It's family grass dad.

268
00:18:29,514 --> 00:18:31,263
When you own your own grass,
you'll understand.

269
00:18:31,264 --> 00:18:32,605
This, I can't do it anymore.

270
00:18:32,607 --> 00:18:34,816
You're putting girl jewellery
on a boy dog.

271
00:18:34,804 --> 00:18:37,277
He's got enough self esteem
issues, he's a Chihuahua.

272
00:18:37,277 --> 00:18:38,750
That's his bling.

273
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:41,101
I want you home by
11 o' clock.

274
00:18:41,316 --> 00:18:43,097
Yeah, alright.
- 11 o' clock.

275
00:18:43,098 --> 00:18:45,110
Please, for the love of God
drive safely.

276
00:18:45,112 --> 00:18:47,211
Seatbelts, on.

277
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:54,417
Wow.

278
00:18:55,454 --> 00:18:56,425
You are so cheap.

279
00:18:57,951 --> 00:19:00,501
That's his first car.
It's supposed to be like that.

280
00:19:05,575 --> 00:19:10,907
At this time, we can't confirm,
whether there were any survivors.

281
00:19:12,013 --> 00:19:15,132
Our bases worldwide are as
of now DEFCON Delta.

282
00:19:15,635 --> 00:19:17,847
Our highest readiness level.

283
00:19:18,652 --> 00:19:20,765
We're dealing with a very effective
weapon system

284
00:19:20,766 --> 00:19:22,274
that we have not come across before.

285
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,953
Both our prayers are
with the families

286
00:19:24,954 --> 00:19:28,007
of the brave men and women...
- Daddy's going to be ok.

287
00:19:29,014 --> 00:19:31,126
I've never seen a weapon
system like this.

288
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:35,411
Thermal shows this weird aura around
the exoskeleton like it's cloaked

289
00:19:35,412 --> 00:19:37,564
by some kind of invisible force field.

290
00:19:37,565 --> 00:19:39,978
That's impossible. There's no such thing
as invisible force fields

291
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:41,990
except in like comic books stuff,
right?

292
00:19:41,991 --> 00:19:42,964
Man, I don't know.

293
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:44,908
My momma, she had a gift,
you know.

294
00:19:45,612 --> 00:19:48,818
She saw things.
I got the gene too, and I--

295
00:19:49,032 --> 00:19:50,943
That thing that attacked us...

296
00:19:50,944 --> 00:19:52,393
I got a feeling it ain't over.

297
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:57,079
How about you use those magic voodoo
powers and get us the hell out of here.

298
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,908
When I took that picture,
I think it saw me.

299
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,731
It looked right at me.

300
00:20:06,636 --> 00:20:08,638
We got to get this thing back
to the Pentagon right away,

301
00:20:08,639 --> 00:20:10,044
they're gonna know what
we're dealing with here.

302
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:13,576
Our radio's fried.
I got no communication with Aerial.

303
00:20:14,684 --> 00:20:17,500
How far do you live from here?
- Not far, just up that mountain.

304
00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:19,210
Do you have a phone?
- Yes.

305
00:20:19,211 --> 00:20:20,517
All right, let's hit it.

306
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,453
Dude, are you sure
we're invited to this party?

307
00:20:26,955 --> 00:20:30,074
Of course Miles, it's a lake.
Public property.

308
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:35,506
Oh my God. Oh my God, dude.
Mikaela's here.

309
00:20:35,507 --> 00:20:37,116
Just don't do anything weird,
all right?

310
00:20:37,117 --> 00:20:38,927
I'm good right?
- Yeah, you're good.

311
00:20:38,928 --> 00:20:39,929
Okay.

312
00:20:43,755 --> 00:20:45,365
Hey guys, check it out.

313
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:50,193
Hey bro, that car...
It's nice.

314
00:20:51,294 --> 00:20:52,294
Hey..

315
00:20:57,334 --> 00:20:59,346
So what are you guys doing here?

316
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,162
We're here to climb this tree.

317
00:21:03,068 --> 00:21:04,778
I see that, it looks fun.

318
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:06,958
I thought I recognized you,

319
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,166
you tried out for the football team
last year right?

320
00:21:11,215 --> 00:21:12,499
Let's go call your mum.

321
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,134
Oh, no, no, no.
That? No.

322
00:21:14,234 --> 00:21:18,057
That wasn't like a real try out.
I was researching a book I was writing.

323
00:21:19,376 --> 00:21:20,469
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

324
00:21:20,471 --> 00:21:22,784
Yeah, what's it about?
Sucking at sports?

325
00:21:24,494 --> 00:21:27,009
No, it's about the link between
brain damage and football.

326
00:21:28,216 --> 00:21:30,228
I tell you, it's a good book,
your friends will love it.

327
00:21:30,229 --> 00:21:35,459
It's got mazes in it, little coloring areas,
sections, pop up pictures...

328
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,873
A lot of fun.
- That's funny.

329
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:41,074
Okay, okay. You know what?
Stop.

330
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:50,045
You got to get off the tree right now.
Just, get off the tree right now, please.

331
00:21:51,855 --> 00:21:53,868
What are you doing?
- You said it's fun.

332
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,483
All the chicks were watching...
- You're making me look like an idiot.

333
00:21:56,484 --> 00:21:57,790
We both look like idiots.

334
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:01,211
How about you let me drive?
- Oh no, this is not a toy.

335
00:22:01,212 --> 00:22:03,726
These 22's, I don't want you
grind them.

336
00:22:03,727 --> 00:22:06,714
Why doesn't my little bunny
just hop in the back seat?

337
00:22:07,589 --> 00:22:08,589
Oh God,

338
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,472
I can't even tell you how much
I'm not your little bunny.

339
00:22:13,337 --> 00:22:14,323
Okay.

340
00:22:15,196 --> 00:22:17,207
You'll call me.

341
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:27,969
Hey man, what's wrong
with your radio?

342
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,981
I'm driving her home tonight.
- What?

343
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:32,696
She's an evil jock concubine man,
let her hitchhike.

344
00:22:32,697 --> 00:22:34,608
She lives 10 miles from here, okay?
It's my only chance.

345
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:37,425
You got to be understanding here, alright?
- Alright, we'll put her in the back, I'll be quiet.

346
00:22:37,426 --> 00:22:39,839
Did you said put her in the back?
Miles, I'm not putting her in the back!

347
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,354
You got to get out of my car right now.
What rules?

348
00:22:42,355 --> 00:22:45,170
Bros before hoes.
- Miles, I beg you to get out of my car.

349
00:22:45,874 --> 00:22:48,605
You can't do this to me.
- You got to get out of my car right now.

350
00:22:55,894 --> 00:22:56,881
Mikaela!

351
00:22:57,546 --> 00:22:59,860
It's Sam...
Witwicky.

352
00:23:00,465 --> 00:23:02,007
Hope you're not stranded
or anything...

353
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:03,982
You sure?

354
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:05,591
So listen, I was wondering if I
could ride you home...

355
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:09,112
I mean, give you a ride home,
in my car to your house.

356
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:11,456
Here you go.

357
00:23:14,738 --> 00:23:15,729
Thanks.

358
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,297
So, uh..

359
00:23:23,198 --> 00:23:25,109
I can't believe that I'm here right now.

360
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,633
You can drop down if you want,
it won't hurt my feelings.

361
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,441
Oh, no, no, no.

362
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,208
I didn't mean here with you,
I just mean here like,

363
00:23:34,209 --> 00:23:35,367
in this situation.

364
00:23:35,869 --> 00:23:39,232
Same situation that I'm always in.
I don't know, I guess I just have a

365
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:44,420
weakness for hot guys, for tight
abs and really big arms.

366
00:23:44,782 --> 00:23:46,233
Big arms?

367
00:23:48,746 --> 00:23:50,859
There's couple of new additions in the car.

368
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,575
Like, I've just put in that
light there...

369
00:23:53,675 --> 00:23:58,318
And that disco ball, so the light
reflects off the disco ball.

370
00:23:59,454 --> 00:24:00,439
Yeah.

371
00:24:03,535 --> 00:24:07,224
Are you new to school this year?
Is this your first year?

372
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:11,399
No, we've been in the same
school since first grade.

373
00:24:11,401 --> 00:24:12,598
Really?
- Yeah.

374
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,889
No.
- Yeah, long time.

375
00:24:14,499 --> 00:24:18,121
Do we have any classes together?
- Yeah, History...

376
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:22,353
Language Arts, Math, Science...
- Sam...

377
00:24:22,354 --> 00:24:23,373
Sam, yeah...

378
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:24,751
Sam Wilckeky...

379
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,577
Witwicky.
- I know, I'm so sorry.

380
00:24:27,578 --> 00:24:29,372
I just--
- No, it's cool.

381
00:24:29,373 --> 00:24:32,276
I just didn't recognize you.
- Yeah, well, that's understandable.

382
00:24:33,994 --> 00:24:36,335
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
What's going on?

383
00:24:36,336 --> 00:24:37,295
Come on.

384
00:24:38,139 --> 00:24:40,352
Just started working out the cakes,
you know..

385
00:24:43,671 --> 00:24:46,527
This radio is like... you know,
it's an old radio..

386
00:24:48,502 --> 00:24:50,112
Look this isn't something...

387
00:24:51,721 --> 00:24:53,432
Look I wouldn't try this on you.

388
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:56,559
This is like a romantic thing
that I'm not trying to do.

389
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,189
You know, it's not that you're not worthy
of trying something like this on--

390
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,181
No, of course not.

391
00:24:59,182 --> 00:25:00,719
I'm a friend of yours, I'm
not a romantic friend.

392
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,508
Romantic friends do this.
I mean, I'm not that friend.

393
00:25:04,593 --> 00:25:06,522
I mean we...
I could be if--

394
00:25:06,908 --> 00:25:09,021
Just pop the hood.

395
00:25:09,512 --> 00:25:11,674
Shut up. Shut up, shut up,
shut up, shut up!

396
00:25:14,955 --> 00:25:17,771
Nice headers... You got a hi-res
double pump carburetor...

397
00:25:17,772 --> 00:25:20,286
That's pretty impressive Sam.

398
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:21,792
Double pump?

399
00:25:21,794 --> 00:25:24,209
It squirts the fuel in,
so you can go faster.

400
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,211
Oh.

401
00:25:26,321 --> 00:25:28,333
I like to go faster.

402
00:25:28,334 --> 00:25:32,155
It looks like your distributor cap
is a little loose.

403
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,978
Yeah? How did you know that?

404
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:40,707
My dad, he was a real grease monkey.
Taught me all about this.

405
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:43,523
I could take it all apart, clean it,
put it back together.

406
00:25:43,924 --> 00:25:46,237
That's weird, I just wouldn't
pay you for mechanical.

407
00:25:47,244 --> 00:25:49,378
Well you know,
I don't really broadcast it.

408
00:25:49,379 --> 00:25:51,905
Guys don't like it when you know more
about cars than they do.

409
00:25:51,907 --> 00:25:54,387
Especially not Trent.
He hates it.

410
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:57,996
I'm cool with females
working on my engine.

411
00:25:57,998 --> 00:25:59,617
I prefer it actually.

412
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:01,956
Ok, you want to fire it up for me?

413
00:26:01,957 --> 00:26:02,958
Oh, yeah. No problem.

414
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:04,468
I was thinking,

415
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,207
if Trent is such a jerk,
why do you hang out with him?

416
00:26:10,281 --> 00:26:12,394
You know what, I'm gonna walk.

417
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:15,411
Good luck with your car.

418
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,636
All right.
Walking's healthy, right?

419
00:26:22,302 --> 00:26:24,594
Oh no, no, no,
no, no.

420
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:26,992
Come on, please...
Please stay work for me now.

421
00:26:26,994 --> 00:26:29,084
Don't let her walk away,
come on.

422
00:26:29,085 --> 00:26:30,086
Please... Please...

423
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:35,178
Hey!

424
00:26:44,889 --> 00:26:45,891
Hey!

425
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,216
Wait a second!

426
00:26:55,749 --> 00:26:57,459
There it is.

427
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:02,190
I had fun, so...
Thanks for listening.

428
00:27:02,195 --> 00:27:03,185
Oh, yeah.

429
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:07,418
You think I'm shallow?

430
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:09,149
No. No, no, no.

431
00:27:09,649 --> 00:27:13,456
I think... There's a lot
more than meets the eye...

432
00:27:14,557 --> 00:27:15,568
With you.

433
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,230
Okay.

434
00:27:19,592 --> 00:27:22,107
Alright, I'll see you at school.

435
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:23,410
Alright.

436
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:32,066
Stupid...
That was a stupid line.

437
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:34,228
"There's more than meets
the eye with you.."

438
00:27:34,229 --> 00:27:35,230
Stupid.

439
00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:39,460
Oh, God.

440
00:27:40,516 --> 00:27:42,629
God, I love my car.

441
00:27:53,292 --> 00:27:56,365
Guys, I think the other team
figured it out.

442
00:27:57,898 --> 00:27:58,899
Iran.

443
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,609
Come on, man. This is way too smart
for Iranian scientists.

444
00:28:03,113 --> 00:28:05,134
Think about it.
- What do you think, Kim?

445
00:28:05,135 --> 00:28:06,136
Chinese?

446
00:28:06,537 --> 00:28:08,919
No way, this is nothing like what
the Chinese are using.

447
00:28:40,335 --> 00:28:41,590
Yes, Mr. President?

448
00:28:41,592 --> 00:28:44,353
Yeah, can you rangle me up
some ding-dongs darling?

449
00:28:56,462 --> 00:28:58,977
Join the Air Force to
serve him ding-dongs.

450
00:28:58,978 --> 00:29:00,989
I'll be in storage.

451
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,931
Shoot...

452
00:29:40,932 --> 00:29:42,533
Oh, gross.

453
00:30:09,594 --> 00:30:11,808
Did you hear that?

454
00:30:14,323 --> 00:30:15,985
Are you getting this?

455
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:18,448
I think they are hacking
the network again.

456
00:30:33,438 --> 00:30:36,924
Oh my God, this is a direct match
to the signal in Qatar.

457
00:30:36,926 --> 00:30:38,746
Are you running a diagnostic?
- Should I be?

458
00:30:38,748 --> 00:30:40,836
Yes, you should.
- Slam.

459
00:30:52,046 --> 00:30:54,522
Someone! They are hacking into
Air Force One.

460
00:30:54,522 --> 00:30:55,949
We need a senior analysts.

461
00:30:55,984 --> 00:30:58,211
I think they're planting a virus.
- A virus?

462
00:30:58,211 --> 00:30:59,234
Streaming right now.

463
00:30:59,236 --> 00:31:00,738
They are planting a virus,

464
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,006
and stealing a whole lot of data
from your system at the same time.

465
00:31:04,007 --> 00:31:05,579
Code Red, we have a breach.

466
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,519
<i>Air Force One, someone's aboard
have breached the military network.<i/></i>

467
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,521
I'm in the cargo hold.

468
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:11,501
Clear!

469
00:31:15,685 --> 00:31:17,321
You got to cut the hard lines.
- What?!

470
00:31:17,323 --> 00:31:19,166
Whatever they want,
they are getting it.

471
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:22,326
Sir, permission to take down
the defense network.

472
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:27,911
Cut all server hard lines now.
- Cut all server hard lines now.

473
00:31:49,382 --> 00:31:51,772
Someone's tampered with
the POTUS mainframe.

474
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:53,072
What the...!

475
00:31:58,886 --> 00:32:01,046
<i>Shot fired in the inner deck.
Repeat, shot fired.<i/></i>

476
00:32:01,618 --> 00:32:03,503
<i>Crew, prepare for emergency
descend.<i/></i>

477
00:32:22,678 --> 00:32:24,489
I want our president
in that bunker.

478
00:32:24,491 --> 00:32:27,135
And I don't want to discuss
a damn thing other,

479
00:32:27,137 --> 00:32:28,712
till that becomes reality.

480
00:32:29,434 --> 00:32:31,715
That's our first priority,
that's our only priority right now.

481
00:32:32,437 --> 00:32:33,737
Air Force One is on the ground.

482
00:33:37,845 --> 00:33:39,863
No, no, no, no,
no, no!

483
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:42,350
Halt! That's my car!

484
00:33:43,805 --> 00:33:45,007
No!

485
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,240
Dad call the cops!

486
00:34:00,248 --> 00:34:00,948
Where are you going with
my car buddy?

487
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:01,666
Where are you going?

488
00:34:02,785 --> 00:34:06,485
Hello? 911 emergency?!
My car's been stolen!

489
00:34:06,487 --> 00:34:10,241
I'm in pursuit, I need all units,
the whole squadron!

490
00:34:10,243 --> 00:34:11,541
Bring everyone!

491
00:34:11,543 --> 00:34:13,049
No, don't ask me questions,
all right?

492
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:14,669
My father is the head of a
neighborhood watch.

493
00:34:48,001 --> 00:34:49,339
Oh my God...

494
00:35:06,615 --> 00:35:09,734
My name is Sam Witwicky.
Whoever finds this, my car is alive.

495
00:35:09,735 --> 00:35:10,636
Okay?

496
00:35:11,524 --> 00:35:12,239
You saw that?

497
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:15,049
These are my last words ever.
I just want to say mom, dad I love you.

498
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:16,639
And if you find "Busty Beauties"
under my bed

499
00:35:16,641 --> 00:35:18,355
it wasn't mine,
I'm holding it for Miles.

500
00:35:18,357 --> 00:35:22,465
Okay, that's not true, it's mine and
uncle Charles gave it to me, I'm sorry.

501
00:35:22,943 --> 00:35:23,844
Mojo, I love you.

502
00:35:44,286 --> 00:35:45,287
Good dog, good dog!

503
00:35:45,288 --> 00:35:46,596
Oh my God.

504
00:35:58,712 --> 00:36:00,079
Please don't kill me,
I'm sorry.

505
00:36:00,865 --> 00:36:02,775
Take the keys, I don't want them.
The car's yours.

506
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:07,840
Listen, listen.
Good you're here.

507
00:36:07,842 --> 00:36:08,813
Let me see your hands!

508
00:36:08,814 --> 00:36:09,999
No, no, no..
- Let me see your hands!

509
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,384
It's not me, the guy's inside.
- Shut up!

510
00:36:12,386 --> 00:36:13,751
Walk towards the car.

511
00:36:15,747 --> 00:36:16,962
Put your head on the hood.

512
00:36:30,424 --> 00:36:33,277
Whoever did this finally managed
to infiltrate our defense network

513
00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:35,980
which is what they've tried to do
in Qatar, only this time it worked.

514
00:36:35,982 --> 00:36:37,539
What did they get?
- We still don't know.

515
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:38,589
Talk to me about the virus.

516
00:36:39,595 --> 00:36:42,127
It's a spider bug virus. We're not sure
what it's going to do

517
00:36:42,129 --> 00:36:44,190
but it may cripple the system.
- Can we stop it?

518
00:36:44,192 --> 00:36:47,104
Every time we try an antivirus
it adapts and speeds up.

519
00:36:47,113 --> 00:36:49,380
It's like it's not a virus anymore,
it's become the system.

520
00:36:49,652 --> 00:36:52,970
Obviously the first phase
of major attack against the US.

521
00:36:52,971 --> 00:36:57,196
Only countries with this kind of capability
are Russia, North Korea, maybe China.

522
00:36:57,197 --> 00:36:59,408
I'm sorry, that's not correct.

523
00:36:59,409 --> 00:37:01,421
Excuse me young lady, I didn't
see you standing there

524
00:37:01,422 --> 00:37:02,510
You would be who?

525
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,438
I'm just an analyst who
detected the hack.

526
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:06,651
Hold on, it was you?

527
00:37:07,053 --> 00:37:08,965
You did it?
- Her team.

528
00:37:08,966 --> 00:37:12,989
Sir, I was trying to say...
They hacked your firewall in 10 seconds.

529
00:37:13,592 --> 00:37:18,119
Even a supercomputer with a brute force
attack would take 20 years to do that.

530
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,735
Maybe you can explain then,
how our latest satellite imagery

531
00:37:20,736 --> 00:37:23,149
shows North Korea doubling
its naval activities?

532
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:26,066
Maybe it's a precaution, because
isn't that what we're doing?

533
00:37:26,971 --> 00:37:31,196
The signal pattern is learning, it's evolving
on its own and you need to move past

534
00:37:31,197 --> 00:37:34,818
fury air transfers and start
considering quantum mechanics.

535
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:37,232
There is nothing on Earth
that complex.

536
00:37:37,233 --> 00:37:40,652
What about an organism?
A living organism, maybe some kind of

537
00:37:40,653 --> 00:37:43,871
DNA based computer,
I know that that sounds crazy--

538
00:37:43,872 --> 00:37:45,883
That's enough.

539
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:49,002
We have 6 floors of men who's
working on this thing.

540
00:37:49,003 --> 00:37:51,617
Now if you can find proof,
to back up your theory

541
00:37:51,618 --> 00:37:53,327
I'm going to be happy to
listen to you.

542
00:37:53,427 --> 00:37:55,741
But if you don't put a filter
on that brain-mouth thing,

543
00:37:55,742 --> 00:37:57,955
you're going to be off the team.
You understand?

544
00:38:03,588 --> 00:38:07,411
Look, I can't be any clearer,
on how crystal clear I am being.

545
00:38:07,914 --> 00:38:10,227
It just stood up.
- Just stood up?

546
00:38:11,607 --> 00:38:12,527
Wow.

547
00:38:12,742 --> 00:38:14,351
It's really neat.

548
00:38:14,352 --> 00:38:16,866
Ok, time to fill her up.

549
00:38:16,867 --> 00:38:18,567
And no drippy, drippy.

550
00:38:19,536 --> 00:38:23,503
What you're rolling? Weapons? Goofballs?
Little wowie sauce with the--

551
00:38:23,505 --> 00:38:25,417
No, I'm not on any drugs.
- What's this?

552
00:38:26,624 --> 00:38:28,938
Found it in your pocket.
Mojo...

553
00:38:30,246 --> 00:38:31,687
Is that what the kids
are doing now?

554
00:38:31,689 --> 00:38:32,760
A little bit of Mojo?

555
00:38:32,762 --> 00:38:36,181
Those are my dog's pain pills.
- Yeah, Chihuahua...

556
00:38:40,908 --> 00:38:42,920
What was that?
- Huh?

557
00:38:43,725 --> 00:38:45,435
You're eyeballing my peace
50 Cent?

558
00:38:48,151 --> 00:38:50,967
You want to go?
Make something happen, do it.

559
00:38:51,069 --> 00:38:54,891
Because I promise you,
I will bust you up.

560
00:38:56,098 --> 00:38:58,009
Are you on drugs?

561
00:39:06,168 --> 00:39:07,454
Let's hope this
telephone line works.

562
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,541
What the heck was that?

563
00:39:28,649 --> 00:39:31,299
English dude, English.

564
00:39:39,494 --> 00:39:40,607
Watch out!

565
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:51,217
Everybody quiet! Settle!
- Whoa, mother...!

566
00:39:51,218 --> 00:39:53,134
What the hell was that?!

567
00:40:10,256 --> 00:40:12,071
Go! Move it!

568
00:40:33,617 --> 00:40:36,350
Vic, cover the rear ass!
Cover the rear doorway!

569
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:37,768
Come on!

570
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:39,668
Give me the map!

571
00:40:40,921 --> 00:40:43,215
Where's your papa?!
- Papa!

572
00:40:44,325 --> 00:40:47,688
Sir, I need a telephone...
- Telephone?

573
00:40:47,689 --> 00:40:48,691
Yeah, telephone.
Yes.

574
00:40:50,279 --> 00:40:52,039
Cell phone.
- All right, thank you.

575
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:55,786
This is an emergency Pentagon call...
I need you to..

576
00:40:55,788 --> 00:40:58,137
Do you understand,
this is an emergency Pentagon...

577
00:41:01,627 --> 00:41:02,811
I don't have a credit card!

578
00:41:03,841 --> 00:41:07,261
Sir, the attitude is not going to
speed things up, any deed at all.

579
00:41:07,262 --> 00:41:10,480
I'm going to ask you to speak
into the mouth piece very clearly...

580
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:12,794
I'm in a middle of a war!

581
00:41:12,795 --> 00:41:14,504
Pretty ridiculous!

582
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:20,338
I need a credit card!

583
00:41:22,048 --> 00:41:24,362
Epps, where's your wallet?!
- Pocket!

584
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:28,486
Which pocket?
- My back pocket!

585
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:32,812
You got 10 back pockets!
- Left jinks!

586
00:41:33,714 --> 00:41:36,617
Keep shooting! Keep shooting!
- Okay, it's a Visa...

587
00:41:37,942 --> 00:41:41,462
Also sir, have you heard about our
Premium Plus world service call package?

588
00:41:41,463 --> 00:41:43,676
No, I don't want a premium package!

589
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,144
Epps, it's the Pentagon!

590
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:50,843
Give me a status.

591
00:41:50,845 --> 00:41:53,894
Sir, we're tracking a Special Ops team
under fire in Qatar.

592
00:41:53,937 --> 00:41:55,741
They say they're survivors of
the base attack.

593
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:57,042
Survivors?

594
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:04,296
I've never seen this in my life!
Need gunships on station ASAP!

595
00:42:04,297 --> 00:42:07,196
Predators coming up in a minute.
- Link in the call to the nearest AWACS.

596
00:42:13,247 --> 00:42:16,408
I don't know man... Man,
if you've seen this shit...

597
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,681
Predator ETA 2 minutes.

598
00:42:34,676 --> 00:42:36,687
What is that?
- I don't know...

599
00:42:41,717 --> 00:42:43,531
We need air support and
we need it now.

603

said us to clear kill box One Alpha,

604
00:42:57,091 --> 00:42:57,813
Send the Hogs, sir.

605
00:42:57,814 --> 00:43:00,179
Ok, send the Hogs over to kill box
One Alpha to danger...

606
00:43:01,717 --> 00:43:03,580
<i>...kill box One Alpha, 300 feet,

you're cleared hot!

611
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:21,390
Strike, tell me status--

612
00:43:21,394 --> 00:43:23,086
Bravo 1, Dark Star, status?

613
00:43:26,067 --> 00:43:29,198
Lennox, the heat's coming!
- Laser target!

614

We got to beam light it for incoming!
Light target!

615

in the city of target.<i/></i>

617
00:44:01,186 --> 00:44:02,896
No freaking way!
That thing is still not down!

618
00:44:02,897 --> 00:44:06,015
Bookie 32, use .105 shells.
Bring the rain.

619
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:11,245
<i>Be advised, ground team is
requesting .105 Sable rounds.</i>

620
00:44:40,113 --> 00:44:43,735
Did we lose it?
- Warthog 1, confirm visual on frendlies.

621
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,571
Where is Fig?

622
00:44:50,226 --> 00:44:51,835
Fig.

623
00:44:53,293 --> 00:44:55,204
Get a medic!

624
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,953
He's got a pulse. Hit in there.

625
00:45:05,263 --> 00:45:06,973
Bring them home.

626
00:45:08,784 --> 00:45:11,629
You get those men,
stateside right now.

627
00:45:11,887 --> 00:45:13,566
I want them debriefed,
in 10 hours.

628
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:23,471
There's only one hacker in the world
who can break this code.

629
00:45:34,242 --> 00:45:35,783
Wait! Taxi!

630
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:42,483
I'm sorry to bother you.
- Maggie...

631
00:45:42,484 --> 00:45:45,099
I need your help.
- No, this is my private area...

632
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,989
my place of zen and peace.

633
00:45:47,991 --> 00:45:51,433
Glenn, who is it?
- Shut up grandma!

634
00:45:51,434 --> 00:45:54,348
What are you doing here?!
- Just give me a break will you?

635
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:56,063
Grandma, cut your prune juice!

636
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:03,507
What level are you on?
- Sixth...

637
00:46:06,577 --> 00:46:08,377
Oh, here comes The Matrix,
here comes The Matrix!

638
00:46:12,661 --> 00:46:16,685
Glenn, seriously, don't you want to
see something classified?

639
00:46:22,218 --> 00:46:26,007
I need a moment... please.
- Sorry.

640
00:46:26,943 --> 00:46:28,164
And save my game.

641
00:46:28,341 --> 00:46:30,064
How classified?

642
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:34,154
Like, I will go to jail
for the rest of my life,

643
00:46:34,156 --> 00:46:36,810
for showing you classified.
- Yes!

644
00:46:36,814 --> 00:46:37,910
One quick peak.

645
00:46:38,714 --> 00:46:42,232
Special Ops got a thermal snapshot
of whatever hit the base in Qatar.

646
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:45,048
I want to see it.
- All the imager was damaged, sir.

647
00:46:45,049 --> 00:46:48,669
The Rangers are en route with the imager,
but we also have a security issue.

648
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:51,386
Server logs indicate one of the
analysts made a copy of the network

649
00:46:51,388 --> 00:46:52,340
intrusion signal.

650
00:46:55,414 --> 00:46:58,869
The signal strength is through the roof,
where did you say you got this?

651
00:46:58,871 --> 00:47:02,154
Hacked the national military air guard
frequency in less than a minute.

652
00:47:02,633 --> 00:47:04,065
No way...

653
00:47:06,189 --> 00:47:09,191
Looks like there's a message
embedded in the signal.

654
00:47:09,192 --> 00:47:10,905
Let me work my magic.

655
00:47:17,344 --> 00:47:20,161
Project 'Iceman'?
- What's Sector-7?

656
00:47:20,685 --> 00:47:22,172
Who is captain Witwicky?

657
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:25,334
Are you playing those
video games again?

658
00:47:26,655 --> 00:47:28,610
Cops!

659
00:47:28,611 --> 00:47:30,463
FBI! Clear right!

660
00:47:33,088 --> 00:47:34,584
Mark them down!
Mark them down!

661
00:47:40,729 --> 00:47:42,891
I'm just a cousin!
I'm just a cousin!

662
00:47:43,547 --> 00:47:47,353
Get off my grandmama's carpet!
She don't like nobody on her carpet!

663
00:47:47,355 --> 00:47:48,930
Especially police!

664
00:47:49,723 --> 00:47:52,657
<i>It was an awesome spectacle here,
an hour ago,<i/></i>

665
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:56,551
<i>when over 40 C-17s lifted off

<i>We were not told where

Stop with the barking Mojo,
it's too early please.

670
00:48:12,569 --> 00:48:16,668
Miles, listen to me.
My car, it stole itself ok?

671
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:19,954
What are you talking about man?
- Satan's Camaro in my yard.

672
00:48:19,956 --> 00:48:20,918
It's stalking me.

673
00:48:28,496 --> 00:48:29,686
Stop!!

674
00:48:39,703 --> 00:48:41,438
Sam?

675
00:48:43,572 --> 00:48:44,573
Hi...

676
00:48:45,075 --> 00:48:47,204
That was really...

677
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,481
Awesome.

678
00:48:48,751 --> 00:48:51,058
It felt awesome.
- Are you ok?

679
00:48:51,058 --> 00:48:52,569
I'm not ok, I'm loosing
my mind a little bit.

680
00:48:52,571 --> 00:48:54,597
Getting chased by my car
right now, I got to go.

681
00:48:55,021 --> 00:48:57,064
You know what, I'm gonna catch up
with you guys later.

682
00:49:30,063 --> 00:49:31,530
Oh, great, the cops.

683
00:49:36,828 --> 00:49:37,989
Officer!

684
00:49:39,507 --> 00:49:40,422
Listen...

685
00:49:42,678 --> 00:49:44,420
Oh... that hurt.

686
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,963
Listen to me.
Thank God you're here.

687
00:49:49,566 --> 00:49:51,220
I've had the worst day ever.
I've been--

688
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,843
I've been followed here,
on my mother's bike.

689
00:49:53,844 --> 00:49:54,745
Right.

690
00:49:54,747 --> 00:49:57,031
And my car is right there
and it has been following me here.

691
00:49:57,318 --> 00:49:58,692
So get out of the car.

692
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:02,433
Stop! Oh God.

693
00:50:02,435 --> 00:50:05,957
Okay, all right!
All right, I'm sorry!

694
00:50:18,005 --> 00:50:18,740
Please!

695
00:50:18,742 --> 00:50:20,299
Okay, what do you want
from me?!

696
00:50:23,057 --> 00:50:24,058
Okay.

697
00:50:30,012 --> 00:50:31,013
Oh, God. No!

698
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:32,116
No!

699
00:50:33,372 --> 00:50:35,141
Oh shit, oh shit!

700
00:50:35,522 --> 00:50:36,444
Oh, my God!

701
00:50:36,945 --> 00:50:38,445
Oh, shit...!

702
00:50:42,188 --> 00:50:43,557
This is a bad dream.

703
00:50:45,968 --> 00:50:47,928
Are you username LadiesMan217?

704
00:50:47,932 --> 00:50:49,102
I don't know what you're
talking about!

705
00:50:49,104 --> 00:50:51,088
Are you username LadiesMan217?!

706
00:50:51,662 --> 00:50:52,709
Yeah...

707
00:50:52,709 --> 00:50:56,832
Where is the eBay item 21153?!
Where are the glasses?!

708
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,686
Get back!

709
00:51:10,396 --> 00:51:11,397
Go!

710
00:51:16,551 --> 00:51:18,211
What is your problem Sam?!

711
00:51:18,213 --> 00:51:20,171
There's a monster right there,
it just attacked me!

712
00:51:20,466 --> 00:51:21,814
Here it comes!

713
00:51:23,821 --> 00:51:24,815
You have to run!

714
00:51:32,444 --> 00:51:34,372
Sam what is that thing?
- You have to get in the car.

715
00:51:34,556 --> 00:51:36,261
Get in the car.
Trust me, trust me!

716
00:51:36,462 --> 00:51:37,263
Sam!

717
00:51:37,791 --> 00:51:38,972
Get in!

718
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,221
Go, go, go, go,
go, go!

719
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:54,775
Go, go, go, go!

720
00:51:58,901 --> 00:52:02,883
My God! We're gonna die!
- No, we're not gonna die!

721
00:52:03,651 --> 00:52:04,886
Watch him.
He's a kick-ass driver!

722
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:07,787
We're gonna die!!

723
00:52:15,081 --> 00:52:16,071
Oh, my God!

724
00:52:33,103 --> 00:52:34,913
We're locked in.

725
00:52:36,724 --> 00:52:37,913
The car won't start.

726
00:52:37,915 --> 00:52:40,244
At least we've ditched
the monster, right?

727
00:52:46,089 --> 00:52:47,090
Okay.

728
00:52:48,894 --> 00:52:49,895
Now it's time...

729
00:53:54,122 --> 00:53:56,504
Oh, he's got me!
He's got me!

730
00:54:02,628 --> 00:54:04,842
He's gonna kill me!

731
00:54:23,866 --> 00:54:25,163
Get off!

732
00:54:40,483 --> 00:54:41,780
Get him, get him!

733
00:54:48,703 --> 00:54:51,215
Not so tough without
a head, are you?!

734
00:54:57,052 --> 00:54:58,661
Come on.

735
00:55:13,246 --> 00:55:15,460
What is it?

736
00:55:16,164 --> 00:55:17,975
It's a robot.

737
00:55:19,081 --> 00:55:23,508
Like a... different... you know,
like a super advanced robot.

738
00:55:25,419 --> 00:55:26,742
It's probably Japanese.

739
00:55:26,744 --> 00:55:29,543
Yeah, it's definitely
Japanese.

740
00:55:30,851 --> 00:55:32,863
What are you doing?

741
00:55:33,265 --> 00:55:35,578
I don't think he wants to hurt us.
He would've done that already.

742
00:55:36,383 --> 00:55:37,306
Really?

743
00:55:37,308 --> 00:55:38,735
Well, do you speak robot?

744
00:55:38,737 --> 00:55:41,513
Because they just had like a--
giant twin death match.

745
00:55:43,727 --> 00:55:46,543
I think he wants something from me.
- What?

746
00:55:46,544 --> 00:55:49,360
Because the other one was talking
about my eBay page.

747
00:55:50,165 --> 00:55:53,182
You're the strangest boy
I have ever met.

748
00:55:53,585 --> 00:55:54,582
Can you talk?

749
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:57,280
<i>XM Satellite radio... the broadcast--
digital cable brings you--<i/></i>

750
00:55:57,282 --> 00:55:59,212
<i>...broadcasting system.<i/></i>

751
00:55:59,219 --> 00:56:01,531
So you talk through the radio?

752
00:56:01,532 --> 00:56:04,154
<i>How do you do? You're wonderful,
you're wonderful.<i/></i>

753
00:56:04,349 --> 00:56:06,360
So what was that last night?
What was that?

754
00:56:06,361 --> 00:56:09,539
<i>...message from stars reach up--
throughout the anonymous vessels of--<i/></i>

<i>...bring down like a visitors
from heaven, hallelujah!<i/></i>

756
00:56:12,295 --> 00:56:14,508
"Visitors from heaven"...
What?

757
00:56:14,509 --> 00:56:16,923
What, are you like an alien
or something?

758
00:56:23,056 --> 00:56:25,268
<i>Any more questions
you want to ask?<i/></i>

759
00:56:25,872 --> 00:56:27,985
He wants us to get in the car.

760
00:56:29,292 --> 00:56:31,305
And go where?

761
00:56:31,306 --> 00:56:33,637
50 years from now, when you're
looking back at your life,

762
00:56:33,639 --> 00:56:34,671
don't you want to be able
to see here

763
00:56:34,672 --> 00:56:36,267
the guts that get you in the car?

764
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:07,921
This car is a pretty
good driver.

765
00:57:11,743 --> 00:57:13,655
Why don't you go sit
in that seat there?

766
00:57:13,656 --> 00:57:15,968
I'm not gonna sit in his seat,
he's driving.

767
00:57:18,572 --> 00:57:20,271
Yeah, you're right.

768
00:57:21,501 --> 00:57:23,483
Maybe you should sit
in my lap.

769
00:57:23,485 --> 00:57:24,720
Why?

770
00:57:25,726 --> 00:57:28,744
I have the only seatbelt here,
you know-- safety first.

771
00:57:31,842 --> 00:57:33,246
Yeah, alright.
- Alright?

772
00:57:33,247 --> 00:57:34,244
Yeah..

773
00:57:34,247 --> 00:57:35,941
Thank you.

774
00:57:37,395 --> 00:57:39,407
See, that's better.

775
00:57:44,437 --> 00:57:47,275
You know, that seatbelt thing
was a pretty smooth move.

776
00:57:48,762 --> 00:57:50,573
Thank you.

777
00:57:50,874 --> 00:57:53,188
You know what I don't understand...

778
00:57:53,189 --> 00:57:56,540
Why if he's supposed to be like
this super advanced robot,

779
00:57:56,542 --> 00:57:59,526
does he transform back into
this piece of crap Camaro?

780
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:03,628
Oh, see.
No, that doesn't work.

781
00:58:03,629 --> 00:58:04,630
See?

782
00:58:04,631 --> 00:58:06,901
<i>Move it you moron!<i/></i>

783
00:58:06,902 --> 00:58:08,684
Great, now see?

784
00:58:09,283 --> 00:58:12,400
Fantastic!
Now you've pissed him off!

785
00:58:12,904 --> 00:58:16,022
That car is sensitive. I mean,
$4,000 dollars just drove off.

786
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:31,301
What?

787
00:59:56,525 --> 00:59:58,498
It's the coolest thing
I've ever seen!

788
00:59:58,500 --> 00:59:59,719
Explosives everywhere!

789
00:59:59,766 --> 01:00:02,033
This is easily a hundred times
cooler than Armageddon,

790
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:04,321
I swear to God!

791
01:00:20,647 --> 01:00:23,131
Sweet... Oh dude,
I hope this guy's got

792
01:00:23,131 --> 01:00:25,075
ass-drilling insurance
coz he is so boned.

793
01:00:28,656 --> 01:00:29,657
What is that?

794
01:00:30,567 --> 01:00:33,108
Exactly in the tree.
- You got to get out of here!

795
01:00:33,109 --> 01:00:35,004
There's got to be
something by the tree!

796
01:00:35,005 --> 01:00:36,421
You guys! Could you
gave me a space slot?

797
01:01:11,046 --> 01:01:13,964
Excuse me, are you the tooth fairy?

798
01:01:15,369 --> 01:01:18,186
Hey sweetheart, what are you
doing out here by yourself?

799
01:01:18,587 --> 01:01:20,599
Holy cow, what happened
to the pool?

800
01:02:53,649 --> 01:02:57,874
Are you Samuel James Witwicky,
descendant of Archibald Witwicky?

801
01:02:59,182 --> 01:03:00,439
They know your name.

802
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:02,803
Yeah...

803
01:03:02,804 --> 01:03:05,318
My name is Optimus Prime.

804
01:03:05,319 --> 01:03:09,242
We are autonomous robotic organisms
from the planet Cybertron.

805
01:03:09,342 --> 01:03:11,957
But you can call us Autobots for short.

806
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:13,366
Autobots?

807
01:03:13,367 --> 01:03:16,284
What's cracking' little bitches?
- My first lieutenant...

808
01:03:16,888 --> 01:03:20,509
Designation Jazz...
- This looks like a cool place to kick it.

809
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,633
How did he learn to talk like that?

810
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:28,254
We've learned Earth's languages
through the World Wide Web.

811
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,487
My weapons specialist, Ironhide.

812
01:03:32,491 --> 01:03:36,804
You feeling lucky punk?
- Easy Ironhide.

813
01:03:36,805 --> 01:03:39,622
Just kidding, I just wanted
to show him my canons.

814
01:03:41,231 --> 01:03:43,544
Our medical officer Ratchett.

815
01:03:43,545 --> 01:03:47,467
The boy's pheromone levels suggest
he wants to mate with the female.

816
01:03:49,982 --> 01:03:52,698
You already know your
guardian Bumblebee.

817
01:03:53,733 --> 01:03:56,009
Bumblebee, right?

818
01:03:57,024 --> 01:03:58,935
You're my guardian,
huh?

819
01:03:59,539 --> 01:04:04,770
His vocal processor was damaged in battle.
We've been still working on him.

820
01:04:09,397 --> 01:04:13,119
Why are you here?
- We are here looking for the Allspark.

821
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:16,036
And we must find it before Megatron.

822
01:04:16,539 --> 01:04:18,149
Mega what?

823
01:04:27,706 --> 01:04:30,321
Our planet was once
a powerful empire.

824
01:04:31,527 --> 01:04:33,540
Peaceful and just.

825
01:04:34,345 --> 01:04:39,273
Until we were betrayed by Megatron,
leader of the Decepticons.

826
01:04:40,078 --> 01:04:42,794
All who defied them were destroyed.

827
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:50,036
Our war finally consumed the planet,
and the Allspark was lost to the stars.

828
01:04:50,841 --> 01:04:53,658
Megatron followed it to Earth.

829
01:04:54,261 --> 01:04:56,374
When Captain Witwicky found him.

830
01:04:57,883 --> 01:04:59,392
My grandfather...

831
01:04:59,393 --> 01:05:03,718
It was an accident that
intertwined our fates.

832
01:05:07,037 --> 01:05:08,948
Come back!

833
01:05:11,262 --> 01:05:13,476
I think the dogs have found
something.

834
01:05:14,783 --> 01:05:17,097
The ice is cracking.

835
01:05:25,848 --> 01:05:28,587
Captain! Grab the rope captain!

836
01:05:29,771 --> 01:05:31,582
I'm alright lads!

837
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:35,049
<i>Can we throw you a rope,
captain?<i/></i>

838
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:47,577
Megatron crash-landed before
he could retrieve The Cube.

839
01:05:51,701 --> 01:05:54,718
Men, we've made a discovery!

840
01:05:55,021 --> 01:05:58,742
He accidentally activated
his navigation system.

841
01:06:13,127 --> 01:06:15,844
The coordinates to The Cube's
location on Earth

842
01:06:15,845 --> 01:06:18,861
were imprinted on his glasses.

843
01:06:18,862 --> 01:06:20,974
How did you know about
his glasses?

844
01:06:20,975 --> 01:06:23,656
eBay.
- eBay.

845
01:06:23,657 --> 01:06:26,507
If the Decepticons find the Allspark...

846
01:06:26,508 --> 01:06:30,228
They will use its power to
transform Earth's machines

847
01:06:30,229 --> 01:06:35,359
and build a new army.
- And the human race will be extinguished.

848
01:06:36,163 --> 01:06:41,092
Sam Witwicky, you hold
the key to Earth's survival.

849
01:06:44,713 --> 01:06:47,027
Please tell me that
you have those glasses.

850
01:06:51,555 --> 01:06:54,672
It's like a self regenerating
molecular armor.

851
01:06:54,774 --> 01:06:57,087
Look at the scorch mark
where the Sable round hit.

852
01:06:57,088 --> 01:06:58,696
Melted right through.

853
01:06:58,697 --> 01:07:01,915
Aren't Sables hot loaded for like a
6,000 degree magnesium burn?

854
01:07:01,916 --> 01:07:04,028
Close to it,
it melts tank armor.

855
01:07:04,029 --> 01:07:06,341
This metal skin must react
to extreme heat...

856
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:11,774
I thought you said
that thing was dead, man!

857
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:14,590
Strap it down!
Strap it!

858
01:07:14,792 --> 01:07:16,602
This thing is wicked!

859
01:07:16,603 --> 01:07:19,517
Alright, get on a horn of Northern Command,
tell them that our effective weapon

860
01:07:19,517 --> 01:07:20,969
is high heat Sable rounds.

861
01:07:21,071 --> 01:07:22,734
Recommend we load
them on all the gunships, go.

862
01:07:26,863 --> 01:07:29,780
You want that piece?
Ok, Maggie, look.

863
01:07:29,781 --> 01:07:31,983
Let me break your time,
tell you how's it gonna happen.

864
01:07:32,093 --> 01:07:34,106
They're gonna come through
that door, play good cop, bad cop.

865
01:07:34,107 --> 01:07:36,117
Don't fall for that, alright?

866
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,727
That's why I ate their food.

867
01:07:37,728 --> 01:07:39,940
See, they put the plate of donuts
out here to test your guilt.

868
01:07:40,442 --> 01:07:42,455
If you don't touch, it you're guilty.

869
01:07:42,857 --> 01:07:46,161
I ate the whole plate.
The whole plate.

870
01:07:46,198 --> 01:07:48,100
Okay?
It's me and you.

871
01:07:48,202 --> 01:07:50,701
They walk through that door,
you don't say nothing.

872
01:08:05,388 --> 01:08:08,104
She did it! She did it!
She's the one you want!

873
01:08:08,105 --> 01:08:10,355
I was just sitting home
watching cartoons,

874
01:08:10,357 --> 01:08:11,223
playing video games
with my cousin

875
01:08:11,224 --> 01:08:13,537
and she came in there, alright?
- Glenn, you freak!

876
01:08:13,538 --> 01:08:15,448
Hey, I am not going to jail
for you or anybody else.

877
01:08:15,449 --> 01:08:17,962
I have done nothing bad
my entire life.

878
01:08:18,868 --> 01:08:20,780
Hey man, I'm still a virgin.

879
01:08:20,781 --> 01:08:23,495
Ok, so what, I've downloaded a couple
of thousand songs off the internet,

880
01:08:23,496 --> 01:08:25,507
who hasn't?!

881
01:08:25,508 --> 01:08:27,720
Glenn, shut up!
- No, you shut up!

882
01:08:27,721 --> 01:08:30,235
Don't talk to me!
Don't talk to me, criminal!

883
01:08:32,951 --> 01:08:34,762
Sugar rush.
- This is not his fault.

884
01:08:35,265 --> 01:08:36,975
Can I go home now?

885
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:38,987
Just listen to me.

886
01:08:38,988 --> 01:08:42,407
Whoever hacked into your
military system, downloaded a file.

887
01:08:42,508 --> 01:08:45,123
It was something about
someone named Witwicky...

888
01:08:45,124 --> 01:08:47,728
And some government group, right?

889
01:08:47,730 --> 01:08:48,644
Named Sector-7.

890
01:08:48,645 --> 01:08:50,880
You have to let me talk to
Defense Secretary Keller

891
01:08:50,882 --> 01:08:52,969
before you go to war
with the wrong country.

892
01:08:53,563 --> 01:08:56,086
<i>Whatever fell out of the sky,
ended up right behind...<i/></i>

893
01:08:56,088 --> 01:08:57,597
What did he say?
- What?

894
01:08:57,599 --> 01:08:58,401
Did he hear it too?

895
01:08:58,402 --> 01:09:00,676
Yeah, Jack heard it too.
- What does he think it is?

896
01:09:00,712 --> 01:09:02,321
He thinks it's a military experiment.

897
01:09:02,322 --> 01:09:04,132
Well I think it's a plane.

898
01:09:08,981 --> 01:09:11,220
<i>...still no official words
as to what happened...<i/></i>

899
01:09:11,878 --> 01:09:14,389
Call Sam, he should be
home in 15 minutes.

900
01:09:14,392 --> 01:09:17,309
Well, I'll call him in 15 minutes.
- If you wait 15 minutes, he'll be late

901
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:20,126
and you'll have to ground him.
- I can't ground him if he's not late, can I?

902
01:09:24,955 --> 01:09:27,672
I need you to stay here, alright?
You have to stay here and watch them.

903
01:09:28,074 --> 01:09:30,287
You hear what I'm saying?
5 minutes, alright?

904
01:09:31,293 --> 01:09:33,406
Thanks for staying on my path.

905
01:09:34,512 --> 01:09:36,524
Oh the path, I'm sorry I
forgot about the path.

906
01:09:36,525 --> 01:09:38,335
I'm gonna sweep the whole thing
right now, how about that?

907
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:42,016
I buy half of your car,
I bail you out of jail,

908
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:43,867
and then I just decided to
do all your chores.

909
01:09:44,668 --> 01:09:46,497
The chores...
- Yeah, life is great.

910
01:09:46,499 --> 01:09:49,295
Well, life is fantastic,
that's how good it is.

911
01:09:50,401 --> 01:09:52,514
The trash can, sorry dad,
I'm gonna do the trash cans, alright?

912
01:09:52,515 --> 01:09:54,022
No, I don't want you
to strain yourself.

913
01:09:54,928 --> 01:09:56,638
Dad, you'll hurt my feelings
if you do it.

914
01:09:56,639 --> 01:09:59,354
I promise... No, no, I'm gonna do it.

915
01:09:59,355 --> 01:10:02,975
I'm gonna do the trash cans and I'm gonna
scrape the grill and I'm gonna...

916
01:10:03,177 --> 01:10:05,692
Sweep up the whole house
right now.

917
01:10:05,693 --> 01:10:07,911
Right now?
- Right now.

918
01:10:10,722 --> 01:10:13,236
I love you.
God I love you.

919
01:10:13,839 --> 01:10:15,662
Just so much right now.
- You know, your mom wanted

920
01:10:15,664 --> 01:10:18,669
me to ground you.
You're 3 minutes late.

921
01:10:18,869 --> 01:10:20,419
Just another thing you did
for me dad,

922
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:22,089
because you're such a swell guy.

923
01:10:22,792 --> 01:10:25,811
Alright, I love you.
Sleep good, handsome man.

924
01:10:27,118 --> 01:10:28,627
What are you doing?

925
01:10:28,628 --> 01:10:30,337
Watch the path!

926
01:10:30,338 --> 01:10:32,082
Please! Please!

927
01:10:32,083 --> 01:10:34,536
No, wait!
No!

928
01:10:34,589 --> 01:10:36,274
Sorry, my bad.

929
01:10:36,675 --> 01:10:41,201
You couldn't wait for 5 minutes,
I told you to stay.

930
01:10:45,426 --> 01:10:47,608
I told you...
- Ok, you know what?

931
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:49,050
They seem to be in a little bit
of a rush.

932
01:10:49,051 --> 01:10:50,052
Well, this is bad.

933
01:10:50,254 --> 01:10:52,267
Mojo no!
No! Stop!

934
01:10:52,769 --> 01:10:55,184
Mojo, off the robot!
God.

935
01:10:56,709 --> 01:10:59,212
No, no! Easy, easy,
hold on!

936
01:10:59,308 --> 01:11:01,722
This is Mojo, he's a friend of mine,
he's a pet.

937
01:11:01,723 --> 01:11:03,835
Okay? That's all.

938
01:11:03,836 --> 01:11:05,646
Just put the guns away,
put them away.

939
01:11:05,647 --> 01:11:08,763
You have a rodent infestation,
shall I terminate?

940
01:11:09,166 --> 01:11:11,882
He's not a rodent, he is a Chihuahua.
This is my Chihuahua.

941
01:11:11,883 --> 01:11:16,912
We love Chihuahuas, don't we?
- He's leaked lubricant's all over my foot.

942
01:11:18,421 --> 01:11:21,540
He peed on you?
Bad Mojo!

943
01:11:21,545 --> 01:11:23,161
Bad Mojo!
- I'm sorry,

944
01:11:23,163 --> 01:11:24,893
he's got a male dominance,
that's all there is.

945
01:11:26,066 --> 01:11:27,876
It's gonna rust.

946
01:11:29,962 --> 01:11:31,177
Okay, okay.

947
01:11:32,303 --> 01:11:34,617
Just hurry.

948
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:39,545
Autobots, recon.

949
01:11:41,913 --> 01:11:43,501
I hope he's okay.
He's in the kitchen,

950
01:11:44,503 --> 01:11:47,392
got some ice on his nose,
I had to slap him around a little bit.

951
01:11:48,599 --> 01:11:50,611
You did not.

952
01:11:51,114 --> 01:11:53,528
You didn't even ground him.
- Almost, almost.

953
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:55,131
Where are you?

954
01:11:58,984 --> 01:12:00,234
Come on.

955
01:12:04,791 --> 01:12:05,792
What?

956
01:12:06,005 --> 01:12:07,007
What is this?

957
01:12:07,008 --> 01:12:10,029
Time is short.
- They really want those glasses.

958
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:14,653
Please hurry.

959
01:12:16,363 --> 01:12:18,274
No, no, it's definitely gone.
- What do you mean?

960
01:12:18,275 --> 01:12:20,272
My glasses were in the bag,
they were in the backpack,

961
01:12:20,274 --> 01:12:21,591
and now the backpack
isn't here.

962
01:12:21,611 --> 01:12:22,902
Well, they're gonna be pissed,
so what do you want to do?

963
01:12:22,903 --> 01:12:25,316
What I think you should do,
you should check this whole--

964
01:12:25,317 --> 01:12:27,428
--this whole section here.
Just give it a clean sweep.

965
01:12:27,429 --> 01:12:29,138
And I'll get the corner here.

966
01:12:29,541 --> 01:12:32,357
Not there, that's my private.
Sorry.

967
01:12:32,861 --> 01:12:34,370
You just told me...

968
01:12:34,372 --> 01:12:36,080
I didn't mean to look inside
of my treasure chest.

969
01:12:36,081 --> 01:12:38,840
You should be way more specific,
so I don't, getting trouble over

970
01:12:38,841 --> 01:12:40,641
your room, because I've had
just about enough.

971
01:12:41,936 --> 01:12:42,937
What now?

972
01:12:45,054 --> 01:12:48,451
No, no, no.

973
01:12:48,452 --> 01:12:50,264
This isn't hiding. This isn't hiding.

974
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:52,074
This is my backyard, not a truck stop.

975
01:12:52,849 --> 01:12:54,077
Oh, God. Oh!

976
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:57,517
<i>I saw it. The UFO landed right here
and now it's gone.</i>

977
01:12:57,807 --> 01:13:00,222
<i>My moped is under there man,
who's gonna pay for that?</i>

978
01:13:01,534 --> 01:13:03,115
Sam, Sam, Sam.

979
01:13:03,317 --> 01:13:05,388
Sam, he's back.
- Ok, I'll deal with this.

980
01:13:06,157 --> 01:13:09,676
What?! Oh no, no, no
these are my mother's flowers.

981
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:11,287
Listen, you got to listen to me.
If my parents come out here

982
01:13:11,288 --> 01:13:12,803
and they see you,
they're gonna freak out.

983
01:13:12,807 --> 01:13:14,094
My mom's got a temper,
okay?

984
01:13:14,104 --> 01:13:16,820
We must have the glasses.
- I know you need the glasses.

985
01:13:16,821 --> 01:13:18,487
I've been looking everywhere,
they're not here,

986
01:13:18,489 --> 01:13:19,536
they're definitely not here.

987
01:13:20,038 --> 01:13:23,157
Keep searching.
- I need you to be quiet for 5 minutes.

988
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:24,161
10 Minutes.
Okay?

989
01:13:24,163 --> 01:13:27,081
Please, I'm begging you.
I can't concentrate.

990
01:13:27,082 --> 01:13:29,193
You want me to look...
- Calm down.

991
01:13:29,194 --> 01:13:31,004
You got to do something.

992
01:13:31,005 --> 01:13:33,720
Autobots, fall back.
- Please, for 5 minutes.

993
01:13:35,601 --> 01:13:37,169
Move!
- Give a way!

994
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:39,156
What's the matter with you,
can't you be quiet?

995
01:13:39,156 --> 01:13:40,760
He wants us to be quiet...

996
01:13:44,685 --> 01:13:47,502
Earthquake! Move, move,
move, earthquake!

997
01:13:48,605 --> 01:13:51,624
Judy, get under the table,
move it!

998
01:13:51,724 --> 01:13:54,440
Duck and cover right now!
- How did you get over there so fast?

999
01:13:55,647 --> 01:13:57,961
Wow!
That was tingling.

1000
01:13:58,863 --> 01:14:00,774
Yeah, that looks fun.

1001
01:14:05,617 --> 01:14:06,836
Sam?

1002
01:14:06,988 --> 01:14:07,990
Sammy?

1003
01:14:10,335 --> 01:14:12,649
What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

1004
01:14:13,158 --> 01:14:14,157
Sam?

1005
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:15,152
That's weird.

1006
01:14:15,154 --> 01:14:15,868
Sam!

1007
01:14:15,869 --> 01:14:18,383
Ratchett, point the light.
- Come on, hurry.

1008
01:14:18,384 --> 01:14:20,193
We've got a major issue here.
What's with the light?

1009
01:14:20,194 --> 01:14:22,809
You got to stop the light.
You got to tell him to shut it off.

1010
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:25,022
Sam are you in there?
How come the door's locked?

1011
01:14:25,023 --> 01:14:28,772
You know the rules,
no doors locked in my house!

1012
01:14:29,046 --> 01:14:30,487
You know he'll start counting

1013
01:14:30,488 --> 01:14:31,561
if you don't open the door.
- One more chance.

1014
01:14:31,562 --> 01:14:33,271
5... 4...
- Oh dear.

1015
01:14:33,272 --> 01:14:34,780
Sam he's counting.
- It's coming of the hinge pal.

1016
01:14:34,781 --> 01:14:37,295
Sam just open the door.
- 3... 2...

1017
01:14:37,596 --> 01:14:39,037
Stand back.

1018
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:41,620
What's up?
What's with the bat?

1019
01:14:41,621 --> 01:14:43,531
Who were you talking to?

1020
01:14:43,532 --> 01:14:46,449
I'm talking to you.
- Why are you so sweaty and filthy?

1021
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:50,070
I'm a child, teenager.
- We heard voices and noises...

1022
01:14:50,071 --> 01:14:51,780
We thought maybe...
- It doesn't matter what we thought.

1023
01:14:51,781 --> 01:14:53,389
What was that light?
- What light?

1024
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:55,402
There's no light, dad, you've
got 2 lights in your hand.

1025
01:14:55,403 --> 01:14:57,415
There was a light coming
underneath the door.

1026
01:14:57,514 --> 01:14:59,627
Look, you can't just bounce
into my room like that.

1027
01:14:59,628 --> 01:15:01,236
You got to knock,
you got to communicate.

1028
01:15:01,237 --> 01:15:03,147
We did, we knocked...
- We knocked!

1029
01:15:03,148 --> 01:15:05,058
You didn't knock, you were
screaming at me, okay?

1030
01:15:05,461 --> 01:15:06,774
This is repression,
what you're doing here.

1031
01:15:06,874 --> 01:15:07,976
You're ruining my youth, okay?

1032
01:15:07,977 --> 01:15:10,792
Oh, for Pete's sakes,
you are so defensive.

1033
01:15:11,295 --> 01:15:14,414
Were you masturbating?

1034
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,978
Judy...
- Was I... No, mum!

1035
01:15:18,236 --> 01:15:20,349
No, I don't masturbate!
- That's not something for you to bring up.

1036
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:22,561
That's a father and son thing.
- Father and son thing.

1037
01:15:22,562 --> 01:15:24,976
We don't have to call it that word
if that makes you uncomfortable.

1038
01:15:24,977 --> 01:15:28,295
You can call it...
"Sam's Happy Time".

1039
01:15:28,296 --> 01:15:33,124
Or "My Special Alone Time".
- Stop, Judy, stop.

1040
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:36,755
I'm sorry, it's just been a weird night,
I had a little bit to drink.

1041
01:15:37,248 --> 01:15:38,658
Well, we saw a light.

1042
01:15:38,849 --> 01:15:40,065
Oh, parents.

1043
01:15:41,473 --> 01:15:43,486
Whatever it was, but we saw it.

1044
01:15:45,497 --> 01:15:49,219
Earthquake, another one!
Another earthquake! Get the doorway!

1045
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:51,935
Okay!
- Aftershock, aftershock.

1046
01:15:51,937 --> 01:15:54,651
God, I hate these.
- Quick hide!

1047
01:16:00,888 --> 01:16:04,510
Oh no, look at the yard,
the yard is destroyed.

1048
01:16:09,841 --> 01:16:13,482
Judy, better call the city,
we've got a blown transformer.

1049
01:16:13,483 --> 01:16:15,474
Power pole's sparkling
all over the place...

1050
01:16:15,978 --> 01:16:20,303
Oh man, the yard's a waste.
Crashed, gone.

1051
01:16:20,505 --> 01:16:22,012
It's all gone. The whole yard.
- You kidding?

1052
01:16:22,013 --> 01:16:25,433
The parents are very irritating.
Can I take them out?

1053
01:16:25,434 --> 01:16:28,585
Ironhide, you know we don't
harm humans.

1054
01:16:29,109 --> 01:16:30,059
What is with you?

1055
01:16:30,271 --> 01:16:33,481
Well, I'm just saying we could.
It's an option.

1056
01:16:33,482 --> 01:16:36,096
We heard you talking to somebody
Sam, we want to know who.

1057
01:16:37,303 --> 01:16:39,717
Hi, I'm Mikaela.

1058
01:16:39,718 --> 01:16:43,122
I'm a friend of Sam's.

1059
01:16:43,741 --> 01:16:45,854
Gosh, you're gorgeous.

1060
01:16:46,557 --> 01:16:49,776
She can hear you talking mom.
- Thank you.

1061
01:16:49,777 --> 01:16:52,895
Oh my goodness, I'm sorry you had
to hear our little family discussion.

1062
01:16:53,599 --> 01:16:56,618
Where's my backpack mom?
- It's in the kitchen.

1063
01:17:16,233 --> 01:17:18,245
Your mom's so nice.

1064
01:17:18,246 --> 01:17:21,766
I want you to distract my parents,
while I sneak out these glasses, okay?

1065
01:17:28,665 --> 01:17:31,280
Ronald Wickedy?
- It's Witwicky, who are you?

1066
01:17:31,281 --> 01:17:33,191
We're the government, Sector-7.

1067
01:17:33,192 --> 01:17:35,002
Never heard of it.
- Never will.

1068
01:17:35,706 --> 01:17:38,221
Your son is the great grandson of
captain Archibald Wickedy, is he not?

1069
01:17:38,222 --> 01:17:39,630
It's Witwicky.

1070
01:17:39,631 --> 01:17:42,748
May I enter the premises sir?

1071
01:17:42,749 --> 01:17:45,565
Ron, there's guys all over
the front yard.

1072
01:17:45,866 --> 01:17:49,085
What the heck is going on here?
- Your son filed a stolen car report last night,

1073
01:17:49,086 --> 01:17:51,399
we think it's involved in a
national security matter.

1074
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:54,117
National security?
- That's right, national security.

1075
01:17:54,117 --> 01:17:55,179
My God Ron, they're everywhere.

1076
01:17:55,181 --> 01:17:57,738
There's guys in suits all around
the house!

1077
01:17:57,739 --> 01:17:59,850
Look at this!
- Could you stay off the grass?!

1078
01:17:59,851 --> 01:18:02,868
Get me a sample and some
isotops readings.

1079
01:18:03,285 --> 01:18:04,287
Good lord!

1080
01:18:04,678 --> 01:18:06,589
They got to get their hands
off my bush.

1081
01:18:06,590 --> 01:18:09,507
Drop the bat ma'am,
I'm carrying a loaded weapon.

1082
01:18:09,508 --> 01:18:11,236
You better get those guys
out of my garden,

1083
01:18:11,236 --> 01:18:13,429
or I'm gonna beat the crap
out of them.

1084
01:18:13,429 --> 01:18:15,515
Are you experiencing any
flu-like symptoms?

1085
01:18:15,515 --> 01:18:17,351
Eating joints, fever?
- No!

1086
01:18:17,351 --> 01:18:19,866
What is this?
- How you doing son!

1087
01:18:19,867 --> 01:18:21,978
Is your name Sam?
- Yeah...

1088
01:18:21,979 --> 01:18:24,493
I need you to come with us...
- You're way out of line!

1089
01:18:24,494 --> 01:18:28,517
Sir, I am asking politely.
Back off.

1090
01:18:28,518 --> 01:18:30,429
You're not taking my son.
- Really?

1091
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:33,044
You're gonna try to get rough with us?
- No, but I'm gonna call the cops.

1092
01:18:33,045 --> 01:18:35,559
Because there's something fishy
going on around here.

1093
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:39,280
There's something a little fishy about you,
your son, your little Taco Bell dog

1094
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:41,293
and this whole operation
you've got going on here.

1095
01:18:42,198 --> 01:18:44,310
What operation?
- That is what we are gonna find out.

1096
01:18:44,311 --> 01:18:47,228
I think, direct contact.

1097
01:18:52,129 --> 01:18:54,446
Son?
- Yeah?

1098
01:18:54,873 --> 01:18:56,683
Step forward please.

1099
01:18:56,684 --> 01:18:57,685
I'm just standing..

1100
01:19:03,725 --> 01:19:05,938
14 rads...

1101
01:19:06,642 --> 01:19:08,453
Bingo!
Tag 'em and bag 'em!

1102
01:19:08,956 --> 01:19:11,270
You hurt my dog,
I'll kick your ass!

1103
01:19:11,471 --> 01:19:14,790
Sam, do not say anything!

1104
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:16,400
Not a word until we get a lawyer.

1105
01:19:20,205 --> 01:19:21,854
So...

1106
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:27,041
LadiesMan217...

1107
01:19:27,142 --> 01:19:30,159
That is your eBay username right?

1108
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:33,277
Yeah, but it was a typo,
then I ran with it.

1109
01:19:33,278 --> 01:19:34,298
What do you make of this?

1110
01:19:34,298 --> 01:19:36,795
<i>My name is Sam Witwicky, okay.
And my--<i/></i>

1111
01:19:36,797 --> 01:19:40,016
Is that him?
- Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.

1112
01:19:40,419 --> 01:19:44,945
Last night at the station you told
the officer your car "transformed"...

1113
01:19:46,353 --> 01:19:48,264
Enlighten me.
- Here's what I said, okay?

1114
01:19:49,170 --> 01:19:52,892
'Cause this is a total misunderstanding
that my car had been stolen.

1115
01:19:53,093 --> 01:19:55,810
Really?
- From me, from my home

1116
01:19:55,811 --> 01:19:58,022
but it's fine now because
it's back, it came back.

1117
01:19:58,626 --> 01:20:00,537
Well, not by itself.
- Well, no.

1118
01:20:00,538 --> 01:20:03,354
Because cars don't do that,
because that would be crazy.

1119
01:20:08,685 --> 01:20:11,603
So, what do you kids know
about the aliens?

1120
01:20:12,608 --> 01:20:14,821
You mean like a martian?
Like what? ET?

1121
01:20:15,626 --> 01:20:18,141
It's an urban legend.
- You see this?

1122
01:20:18,342 --> 01:20:20,555
This is I-can-do-whatever-I-want
and-get-away-with-it badge.

1123
01:20:20,556 --> 01:20:21,448
Right.

1124
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:24,324
I'm gonna lock you up, forever.
- Oh God, you know what?

1125
01:20:24,324 --> 01:20:25,584
Don't listen to him, he's just pissed

1126
01:20:25,585 --> 01:20:27,496
because he's got to get back
to guarding the mall.

1127
01:20:27,497 --> 01:20:30,514
You, in the training bra.
Do not test me.

1128
01:20:30,515 --> 01:20:32,928
Especially when your
daddy's parole coming up.

1129
01:20:32,929 --> 01:20:34,437
What?
Parole?

1130
01:20:34,438 --> 01:20:36,751
It's nothing...
- A grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?

1131
01:20:37,757 --> 01:20:40,071
You know those cars my dad
used to teach me to fix...

1132
01:20:40,072 --> 01:20:42,887
Well they weren't always his.
- You stole cars?

1133
01:20:42,888 --> 01:20:46,509
We couldn't always afford a babysitter,
so sometimes he had to take me along.

1134
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:49,024
She's got her own juvie
record to prove it!

1135
01:20:49,025 --> 01:20:51,840
She's a criminal!
Criminals are hot.

1136
01:20:53,047 --> 01:20:55,782
It would be a real shame
if he had to rot in jail

1137
01:20:55,784 --> 01:20:57,574
for the rest of his natural life.

1138
01:20:57,775 --> 01:21:00,189
It is time to talk!

1139
01:21:15,308 --> 01:21:16,775
I can't see it!
I can't see it!

1140
01:21:16,776 --> 01:21:18,078
Shift your weight towards the front!

1141
01:21:33,586 --> 01:21:36,101
You're loser in trouble now.

1142
01:21:36,302 --> 01:21:37,911
Gentlemen...

1143
01:21:37,912 --> 01:21:40,326
I want to introduce you
to my friend.

1144
01:21:41,433 --> 01:21:43,645
Optimus Prime.

1145
01:21:45,054 --> 01:21:48,675
Taking the children,
was a bad move.

1146
01:21:49,178 --> 01:21:52,498
Autobots, relieve them
of their weapons.

1147
01:21:55,599 --> 01:21:56,825
Freeze!

1148
01:21:58,836 --> 01:22:00,747
Whoa, whoa!
- Give me those!

1149
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:03,451
Whoa..

1150
01:22:13,824 --> 01:22:15,836
Hi there...

1151
01:22:15,837 --> 01:22:20,362
You don't seem afraid.
Are you not surprised to see us?

1152
01:22:22,374 --> 01:22:24,889
There are S-7 protocols.

1153
01:22:25,487 --> 01:22:26,528
Okay?

1154
01:22:26,628 --> 01:22:28,510
I'm not authorized to communicate
with you except to tell you

1155
01:22:28,511 --> 01:22:32,233
I can't communicate with you.
- Get out of the car!

1156
01:22:33,038 --> 01:22:35,049
Me?
- Now!

1157
01:22:37,262 --> 01:22:39,777
I'm getting out, you see?

1158
01:22:39,778 --> 01:22:43,599
Very nifty how you put us down
without really killing us.

1159
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:45,712
You're good with handcuffs too now?

1160
01:22:46,014 --> 01:22:47,825
You weren't supposed to
hear all that.

1161
01:22:47,826 --> 01:22:48,827
Yeah..

1162
01:22:49,528 --> 01:22:50,928
This is real.

1163
01:22:53,659 --> 01:22:57,426
Sam, I have a record because
I wouldn't turn my dad in...

1164
01:22:57,884 --> 01:23:02,142
When did you have to sacrifice
anything in your perfect little life?

1165
01:23:03,618 --> 01:23:05,328
Big guys, big guys with big guns.

1166
01:23:05,329 --> 01:23:06,799
What is Sector-7?

1167
01:23:08,055 --> 01:23:09,470
Answer me!
- I'm the one who asks

1168
01:23:09,472 --> 01:23:10,961
questions around here,
not you young man!

1169
01:23:10,962 --> 01:23:13,174
How did you know about the aliens?
- Where did you take my parents?

1170
01:23:13,175 --> 01:23:15,858
I am not at liberty to discuss...
- No?

1171
01:23:15,878 --> 01:23:17,098
Hey, you touch me,
that's a federal offense.

1172
01:23:17,099 --> 01:23:19,109
Do whatever you want,
get away with the badge, right?

1173
01:23:19,713 --> 01:23:22,228
Brave now all of a sudden with his big
alien friends standing over there.

1174
01:23:22,229 --> 01:23:24,239
Where is Sector-7?
- Wouldn't you like to know.

1175
01:23:31,583 --> 01:23:34,802
Bumblebee, stop lubricating
the man.

1176
01:23:34,803 --> 01:23:36,713
Get that thing to stop!

1177
01:23:38,121 --> 01:23:40,837
Alright, tough guy, take it off.
- What are you talking about?

1178
01:23:41,341 --> 01:23:44,359
Your clothes, all of it, off.
- For what?

1179
01:23:45,264 --> 01:23:48,080
For threatening my dad.

1180
01:23:50,192 --> 01:23:51,199
Little lady...

1181
01:23:51,701 --> 01:23:54,116
This is the beginning...

1182
01:23:54,216 --> 01:23:56,128
Of the end of your life.

1183
01:23:57,838 --> 01:24:00,152
You're a criminal.

1184
01:24:00,252 --> 01:24:03,069
Let's face facts,
it's in your gene pool.

1185
01:24:04,074 --> 01:24:05,684
Those are nice.

1186
01:24:06,187 --> 01:24:08,548
Now get behind the pole.
- All right.

1187
01:24:08,549 --> 01:24:10,009
This is such a felony,
what you're doing.

1188
01:24:12,524 --> 01:24:14,637
I will hunt you down.
- Hunt you down.

1189
01:24:15,159 --> 01:24:17,051
Without any remorse!
- No remorse.

1190
01:24:17,437 --> 01:24:18,354
Okay?

1191
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:21,880
We've got to alert everyone.
- They already know.

1192
01:24:22,081 --> 01:24:23,892
Speaker.

1193
01:24:29,448 --> 01:24:31,574
Optimus, incoming!

1194
01:24:38,981 --> 01:24:40,590
Roll out!

1195
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:50,722
<i>Okay, I'm picking up rads signal
from radio down there.<i/></i>

1196
01:24:53,776 --> 01:24:56,162
<i>Okay, we really need to get
that rad reading point higher.<i/></i>

1197
01:24:56,816 --> 01:24:58,609
Hop kick at.

1198
01:25:03,224 --> 01:25:04,549
<i>Okay, we'll drop this.<i/></i>

1199
01:25:14,932 --> 01:25:17,862
<i>That's it, right there.
Fog him, fog him.<i/></i>

1200
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:28,672
<i>Okay, I got 'em.<i/></i>

1201
01:25:31,483 --> 01:25:33,175
<i>Got him going down the street.<i/></i>

1202
01:25:37,250 --> 01:25:39,289
<i>Where'd he go guys?
I'm lost.<i/></i>

1203
01:25:39,689 --> 01:25:41,862
<i>I got no IR signature.
Where'd he gone?<i/></i>

1204
01:25:42,464 --> 01:25:44,248
<i>Okay, hold up, hold up.<i/></i>

1205
01:25:45,538 --> 01:25:46,765
<i>We're coming around.<i/></i>

1206
01:26:10,215 --> 01:26:11,925
Easy, you two.

1207
01:26:29,391 --> 01:26:30,645
Hold on!

1208
01:26:42,529 --> 01:26:43,937
<i>Alright, we got 'em again,
we got 'em again.<i/></i>

1209
01:26:43,938 --> 01:26:44,909
<i>In the river.<i/></i>

1210
01:26:45,351 --> 01:26:46,318
<i>I'm in for the shot.<i/></i>

1211
01:26:46,448 --> 01:26:48,276
Stop! Stop!

1212
01:26:49,505 --> 01:26:51,177
Wait! No!

1213
01:26:54,228 --> 01:26:56,538
<i>Take the shot, Reef.
Give it a good shot.</i>

1214
01:26:57,405 --> 01:26:58,541
No!!

1215
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:17,061
Stop!

1216
01:27:17,416 --> 01:27:18,463
Stop!

1217
01:27:19,323 --> 01:27:22,711
Get down on the ground!
Get down! Get down!

1218
01:27:26,567 --> 01:27:28,582
Look, he's not fighting back!

1219
01:27:38,202 --> 01:27:39,493
Somebody, help!

1220
01:28:21,122 --> 01:28:22,744
Happy to see me again?

1221
01:28:24,706 --> 01:28:27,121
Put him in the car with his
little criminal friend.

1222
01:28:33,159 --> 01:28:35,973
I want that thing frozen
and ready for transport!

1223
01:28:44,267 --> 01:28:46,610
Hang back,
let me check it out.

1224
01:28:49,256 --> 01:28:51,167
Optimus...

1225
01:28:52,978 --> 01:28:55,650
Are we just gonna
stand here and do nothing?

1226
01:28:55,693 --> 01:28:58,611
There's no way to free Bumblebee
without harming the humans.

1227
01:28:59,314 --> 01:29:01,327
But it's not right...
- Let them leave.

1228
01:29:14,202 --> 01:29:15,925
Chinese and the Russians
are nearing

1229
01:29:15,925 --> 01:29:17,761
our area of operations in
the western Pacific.

1230
01:29:17,765 --> 01:29:20,138
We feel like this could get
out of hand real fast.

1231
01:29:20,139 --> 01:29:23,659
At the next couple of hours,
they justified its presents here.

1232
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:31,803
US and Chinese task forces are approaching
100 nautical miles of cruise missile range.

1233
01:29:32,306 --> 01:29:35,625
Tell the strike group commander that
he's not to engage, unless fired on first.

1234
01:29:35,626 --> 01:29:37,738
Yes, sir.
- Mr. Secretary...

1235
01:29:40,152 --> 01:29:41,244
Tom Banachek.

1236
01:29:41,523 --> 01:29:44,578
I'm with Sector-7,
advanced research division.

1237
01:29:45,383 --> 01:29:46,298
Never heard of it.

1238
01:29:46,299 --> 01:29:48,301
I'm a little busy Tom,
I think you can see that.

1239
01:29:57,661 --> 01:29:59,111
Siegfried!

1240
01:29:59,970 --> 01:30:01,981
Talk to me!
- The whole room's going down, sir.

1241
01:30:01,982 --> 01:30:04,697
I can see that.
- Virus was coded to shut us down.

1242
01:30:04,698 --> 01:30:05,700
General!

1243
01:30:06,005 --> 01:30:08,118
I'll take a seat.

1244
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:10,733
What do you mean shut us down?
- They used our network to spread

1245
01:30:10,734 --> 01:30:11,989
out to the whole world.

1246
01:30:12,350 --> 01:30:13,650
The blackout's global.

1247
01:30:13,651 --> 01:30:16,668
We have no communication.
Satellite and land lines are dead.

1248
01:30:16,669 --> 01:30:20,490
You mean to tell me that I can not
pick up this telephone and call my family...

1249
01:30:27,129 --> 01:30:28,419
Mr. Secretary...

1250
01:30:29,042 --> 01:30:31,657
I'm here under direct order
from the president.

1251
01:30:33,467 --> 01:30:35,479
You really need to see
what I have in the case.

1252
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:40,469
You'll have to accept that
there are certain things

1253
01:30:40,471 --> 01:30:42,722
you won't understand
right away.

1254
01:30:42,723 --> 01:30:45,437
Sector-7 is a special access division
of the government.

1255
01:30:46,142 --> 01:30:49,461
Conveined in secret under president
Hoover 80 years ago.

1256
01:30:50,568 --> 01:30:54,390
You might remember a NASA JPL
lost the Beagle 2 Mars rover?

1257
01:30:55,799 --> 01:30:57,911
We told them to report
the mission a complete failure.

1258
01:30:58,817 --> 01:31:02,338
It wasn't.
Beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds.

1259
01:31:03,344 --> 01:31:05,858
This was classified above top secret.

1260
01:31:21,373 --> 01:31:23,461
<i>ETA ended at 117 hours..</i>

1261
01:31:23,462 --> 01:31:26,179
More than just a pile of Martian rocks.

1262
01:31:27,486 --> 01:31:30,101
This is the image from Mars.

1263
01:31:30,404 --> 01:31:34,326
Here's the image your Special Ops team
was able to retrieve from the base attack.

1264
01:31:35,835 --> 01:31:39,255
We believe they are of the
same exoskeletal type.

1265
01:31:39,859 --> 01:31:42,173
And obviously not Russian
or North Korean.

1266
01:31:42,776 --> 01:31:45,593
Are we talking about
an invasion?

1267
01:31:45,594 --> 01:31:47,907
We intercepted the message
from your Special Ops team.

1268
01:31:48,913 --> 01:31:51,829
These things can be hurt by our weapons,
and now they know it.

1269
01:31:52,433 --> 01:31:54,298
That's why the virus shut us down,

1270
01:31:54,398 --> 01:31:56,859
so we can't coordinate
against their next attack.

1271
01:31:57,664 --> 01:32:00,682
Which I would bet my ridiculous
government salary is coming.

1272
01:32:01,386 --> 01:32:02,596
Soon.

1273
01:32:06,215 --> 01:32:08,327
Get word to our fleet commanders
over national guard frequencies

1274
01:32:08,328 --> 01:32:11,345
short wave radio channel,
it might be still working.

1275
01:32:11,847 --> 01:32:14,765
Tell them to turn their ships around
and come home, ASAP.

1276
01:32:15,369 --> 01:32:18,588
And inform all commands,
to prepare for imminent attack.

1277
01:32:28,547 --> 01:32:29,717
Captain Lennox,

1278
01:32:29,717 --> 01:32:31,867
we need you and your team
to come with us right now!

1279
01:32:31,868 --> 01:32:32,869
Let's go!

1280
01:32:37,902 --> 01:32:39,512
She's in here.

1281
01:32:39,813 --> 01:32:41,523
What's going on?

1282
01:32:42,026 --> 01:32:43,284
You're coming with me.

1283
01:32:44,145 --> 01:32:45,446
You're gonna be my advisor.

1284
01:32:45,748 --> 01:32:47,458
Me too?

1285
01:32:47,861 --> 01:32:49,047
Who's this?

1286
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:51,482
He's my advisor.

1287
01:32:52,588 --> 01:32:53,777
He comes too.

1288
01:33:04,564 --> 01:33:05,565
So..

1289
01:33:05,766 --> 01:33:07,476
What did they get you for?

1290
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:09,991
I bought a car...

1291
01:33:10,595 --> 01:33:12,708
Turned out to be an
alien robot.

1292
01:33:13,914 --> 01:33:15,213
Who knew.

1293
01:33:44,796 --> 01:33:48,016
Please, let this work.

1294
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:50,731
Fire it up Optimus.

1295
01:33:51,939 --> 01:33:54,554
The code...
The code on these glasses

1296
01:33:54,555 --> 01:33:59,383
indicates the Allspark is
230 miles from here.

1297
01:34:00,389 --> 01:34:04,111
I sense the Deceptions are getting
ready to mobilize.

1298
01:34:05,418 --> 01:34:08,637
They must know it's here as well.
- What about Bumblebee?

1299
01:34:08,638 --> 01:34:12,460
We can't just leave him to die.
He'll become some human experiments.

1300
01:34:12,961 --> 01:34:16,483
He'll die in vain if we
don't accomplish our mission.

1301
01:34:16,884 --> 01:34:20,811
Bumblebee is a brave soldier,
this is what he would want.

1302
01:34:20,912 --> 01:34:24,531
Why are we fighting
to save the humans?

1303
01:34:25,637 --> 01:34:28,756
They are primitive,
violent race.

1304
01:34:31,170 --> 01:34:35,910
Were we so different?
They are young species.

1305
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:40,627
They have much to learn.
But I've seen goodness in them.

1306
01:34:41,532 --> 01:34:45,454
Freedom is the right
of all sentient beings.

1307
01:34:45,857 --> 01:34:49,881
You all know there's only
one way to end this war.

1308
01:34:49,882 --> 01:34:53,301
We must destroy The Cube.

1309
01:34:53,703 --> 01:34:58,331
If all else fails, I will unite it
with the spark in my chest.

1310
01:34:58,332 --> 01:35:03,361
That's suicide, The Cube is raw
power, it could destroy you both.

1311
01:35:03,763 --> 01:35:07,987
A necessary sacrifice to
bring peace to this planet.

1312
01:35:07,988 --> 01:35:11,710
We cannot let the humans
pay for our mistakes.

1313
01:35:12,816 --> 01:35:15,331
It's been an honor
serving with you all.

1314
01:35:15,734 --> 01:35:18,751
Autobots, roll out!

1315
01:35:18,752 --> 01:35:19,754
We roll!

1316
01:35:35,476 --> 01:35:37,810
At ease.
Captain, sergeant.

1317
01:35:37,965 --> 01:35:41,586
I got your intel, excellent work.
- Thank you sir, what about the gunships?

1318
01:35:41,587 --> 01:35:45,207
It's being retrofitted with Sable rounds now.
The heat skin will be ready for them.

1319
01:35:45,208 --> 01:35:48,426
But, it won't do us much good if we can't
get world communications back up.

1320
01:35:49,735 --> 01:35:51,344
Hey kid.

1321
01:35:51,947 --> 01:35:55,066
I think we got off to a bad start.

1322
01:35:55,067 --> 01:35:58,586
You must be hungry. You want a latte,
double vatte macchiato?

1323
01:35:58,587 --> 01:36:01,604
Where's my car?
- Son...

1324
01:36:01,605 --> 01:36:03,792
I need you to listen to me
very carefully.

1325
01:36:04,579 --> 01:36:06,066
People could die here.

1326
01:36:06,469 --> 01:36:09,048
We need to know everything you
know, we need to know it now.

1327
01:36:09,049 --> 01:36:10,050
Okay.

1328
01:36:10,357 --> 01:36:13,374
But first, I'll take my car, my parents...
Maybe you should write that down.

1329
01:36:14,379 --> 01:36:16,995
Oh, and her juvie record.
That's got to be gone.

1330
01:36:17,699 --> 01:36:19,912
Like, forever.

1331
01:36:20,717 --> 01:36:23,232
Come with me,
we'll talk about your car.

1332
01:36:23,836 --> 01:36:25,445
Thank you.

1333
01:36:26,451 --> 01:36:28,966
Man's an extortionist.

1334
01:36:29,971 --> 01:36:31,782
All right, here's the situation.

1335
01:36:31,783 --> 01:36:34,376
You've all had direct contact
with the NBEs.

1336
01:36:34,378 --> 01:36:35,402
NBEs?

1337
01:36:35,557 --> 01:36:38,421
Non Biological Extra-terrestrial.
Try and keep up with the acronyms.

1338
01:36:39,423 --> 01:36:42,345
What you are about to see,
is totally classified.

1339
01:36:51,799 --> 01:36:53,712
Dear God, what is this?

1340
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:58,902
We think, when he made his approach
over the North Pole

1341
01:36:58,903 --> 01:37:01,257
our gravitational field
screwed up his telemetry.

1342
01:37:02,062 --> 01:37:05,281
He crashed in the ice,
probably a few thousand years ago.

1343
01:37:06,085 --> 01:37:09,304
We shipped him here to this
facility in 1934.

1344
01:37:09,305 --> 01:37:11,718
Call him NBE-1.

1345
01:37:12,121 --> 01:37:15,138
Sir, I don't mean to correct you on
everything you think you know, but...

1346
01:37:15,541 --> 01:37:17,855
That's Megatron.

1347
01:37:17,856 --> 01:37:20,067
He's the leader of the Decepticons.

1348
01:37:20,068 --> 01:37:23,085
He's been in cryostasis since 1935.

1349
01:37:23,186 --> 01:37:27,546
Your great great grandfather,
made one of the greatest discoveries

1350
01:37:27,548 --> 01:37:28,756
in the history of mankind.

1351
01:37:28,758 --> 01:37:31,625
Fact is, you're looking at the source
of the modern age.

1352
01:37:31,992 --> 01:37:36,737
Microchip, lasers, space flight,
cars, all reverse engineered

1353
01:37:37,065 --> 01:37:40,829
by studying him, NBE-1.

1354
01:37:41,031 --> 01:37:42,702
That's what we call it.

1355
01:37:42,703 --> 01:37:45,830
And you didn't think the United States
military might need to know

1356
01:37:45,832 --> 01:37:48,422
that you're keeping a hostile
alien robot frozen in the basement?

1357
01:37:48,424 --> 01:37:51,910
Until these events, we had no
credible threat to national security.

1358
01:37:52,569 --> 01:37:54,068
Well, you got one now.

1359
01:37:55,273 --> 01:37:57,687
So why Earth?
- It's the Allspark.

1360
01:37:57,688 --> 01:37:59,397
Allspark?
What is that?

1361
01:37:59,398 --> 01:38:01,610
They came here looking for
some sort of cube looking thing.

1362
01:38:02,113 --> 01:38:05,533
And Mr. NBE-1 here, aka Megatron,

1363
01:38:05,734 --> 01:38:08,148
That's what they called him.
Who's pretty much the harbinger of death

1364
01:38:08,149 --> 01:38:12,373
wants to use The Cube, to transform
human technology to take over the universe.

1365
01:38:12,374 --> 01:38:15,592
That's their plan.
- Are you sure about that?

1366
01:38:15,593 --> 01:38:16,795
Yeah.

1367
01:38:19,012 --> 01:38:21,527
You guys know where it is,
don't you?

1368
01:38:22,534 --> 01:38:24,244
Follow me.

1369
01:38:27,664 --> 01:38:30,783
You're about to see
our crown jewel.

1370
01:38:38,930 --> 01:38:42,250
Carbon dating puts the Cube here
around 10,000 B.C.

1371
01:38:43,658 --> 01:38:47,179
The First Seven didn't find it
until 1913.

1372
01:38:47,682 --> 01:38:52,812
They knew it was alien, because of the matching
hieroglyphics on the cube as well as NBE-1.

1373
01:38:53,316 --> 01:38:55,730
President Hoover had the dam
built around it.

1374
01:38:55,931 --> 01:39:00,457
4 football fields thick with concrete,
perfect way to hide its energy

1375
01:39:00,458 --> 01:39:05,789
from being detected by anyone
or any alien species on the outside.

1376
01:39:44,517 --> 01:39:48,038
Wait, back up, you said the dam hides
The Cube's energy...

1377
01:39:48,642 --> 01:39:51,257
What kind exactly?
- Good question.

1378
01:39:56,177 --> 01:39:58,994
Please step inside,
they have to lock us in.

1379
01:40:06,740 --> 01:40:08,877
Has Freddy Kruger have been
up here or something?

1380
01:40:08,879 --> 01:40:11,468
Oh, no man,
Freddy Kruger have 4 blades man.

1381
01:40:11,469 --> 01:40:13,680
That's only 3, that's Wolverine.

1382
01:40:14,406 --> 01:40:15,684
Right? That's Wolverine!

1383
01:40:15,894 --> 01:40:17,805
That's very funny.

1384
01:40:19,113 --> 01:40:22,030
Anybody have any mechanical devices,
Blackberries, cell phone?

1385
01:40:22,031 --> 01:40:23,841
I got a phone.

1386
01:40:26,561 --> 01:40:29,176
Nokia's are real nasty.

1387
01:40:29,177 --> 01:40:33,602
You got to respect the Japanese.
They know the way of the samurai.

1388
01:40:34,305 --> 01:40:36,618
Nokia's from Finland.

1389
01:40:36,619 --> 01:40:38,832
Yes, but he's, you know...

1390
01:40:39,555 --> 01:40:41,729
He's French.
He's a little strange.

1391
01:40:44,564 --> 01:40:47,078
We're able to take The Cube radiation...

1392
01:40:48,486 --> 01:40:50,800
Bundle it into that box.

1393
01:41:03,575 --> 01:41:06,996
Mean little sucker.
- That thing is freaky!

1394
01:41:06,997 --> 01:41:10,114
Kinda like the Energizer
bunny from hell.

1395
01:41:20,828 --> 01:41:22,526
Oh, he's breaking the box.

1396
01:41:52,263 --> 01:41:54,979
Gentlemen, they know
The Cube is here.

1397
01:41:55,683 --> 01:41:57,393
Banachek.
What's going on?

1398
01:41:57,394 --> 01:42:01,015
The NBE-1 hangar has lost power.
And backup generator, it's just not gonna cut!

1399
01:42:01,016 --> 01:42:03,027
Do you have an arms room?

1400
01:42:11,979 --> 01:42:14,796
Get everyone to the
NBE-1 chamber now!

1401
01:42:16,110 --> 01:42:17,306
<i>Move it, move it!
Let's go!<i/></i>

1402
01:42:17,814 --> 01:42:19,926
They're popping our generators.

1403
01:42:35,507 --> 01:42:36,746
We're losing pressure.

1404
01:42:39,430 --> 01:42:40,547
We're losing pressure!

1405
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:44,371
Cryogenic system is failing.
We're losing NBE-1.

1406
01:42:49,501 --> 01:42:52,519
40mm Sable rounds
on that table!

1407
01:43:01,572 --> 01:43:03,383
You got to take me to my car.

1408
01:43:03,384 --> 01:43:04,538
You have to take me to my car,

1409
01:43:04,539 --> 01:43:05,546
he's gonna know what to do
with The Cube.

1410
01:43:05,548 --> 01:43:08,106
Your car? It's confiscated.
- Unconfiscate it.

1411
01:43:08,108 --> 01:43:09,903
We do not know what will happen
if we let him near this thing.

1412
01:43:09,905 --> 01:43:11,716
Maybe you know, but I don't know.
- You just want to sit here,

1413
01:43:11,717 --> 01:43:13,530
and wait and see what happens?
- I have people lives

1414
01:43:13,532 --> 01:43:15,009
at stake here young man!

1415
01:43:17,466 --> 01:43:18,874
Drop it.

1416
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:25,916
Drop your weapon soldier.

1417
01:43:26,117 --> 01:43:28,503
There's an alien war going on
and you're gonna shoot me?

1418
01:43:28,504 --> 01:43:29,584
No, we didn't asked to be here.

1419
01:43:29,585 --> 01:43:31,887
I'm ordering you under S-7
executive jurisdiction.

1420
01:43:31,888 --> 01:43:33,076
S-7 don't exist!

1421
01:43:33,077 --> 01:43:34,785
That's right. We don't take orders
from people that don't exist.

1422
01:43:34,786 --> 01:43:36,981
I'm gonna count to 5.
- I'm gonna count to 3.

1423
01:43:40,701 --> 01:43:42,501
Simmons?
- Yes, sir?

1424
01:43:42,503 --> 01:43:43,531
I'd do what he says.

1425
01:43:44,155 --> 01:43:46,936
Losing is really not an option
for these guys.

1426
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:52,648
All right. Okay.

1427
01:43:53,479 --> 01:43:56,496
You want to lay the faith of the world
on the kids Camaro...

1428
01:43:56,498 --> 01:43:58,005
That's cool.

1429
01:44:03,940 --> 01:44:06,153
Stop! You got to stop!
Stop! Stop!

1430
01:44:06,154 --> 01:44:07,530
No, no. Stop! Stop!

1431
01:44:07,630 --> 01:44:08,970
Let him go!

1432
01:44:10,378 --> 01:44:12,088
You ok?

1433
01:44:13,798 --> 01:44:15,710
They didn't hurt you, right?

1434
01:44:25,062 --> 01:44:27,677
Listen to me, The Cube is here,
the Decepticons are coming.

1435
01:44:30,998 --> 01:44:33,391
Don't worry about them,
they're ok, right?

1436
01:44:33,621 --> 01:44:35,122
They're not gonna hurt you.

1437
01:44:35,827 --> 01:44:38,743
Just back up a little bit.
He's friendly, he's fine.

1438
01:44:39,245 --> 01:44:40,346
Okay, come on.

1439
01:44:40,555 --> 01:44:42,566
Put the guns down,
they're not gonna hurt you.

1440
01:44:42,968 --> 01:44:44,880
Come with me,
we'll take you to the Allspark.

1441
01:45:06,307 --> 01:45:09,525
Ok, here we go.
He's doing something.

1442
01:45:30,195 --> 01:45:31,449
Oh my God...

1443
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:39,000
<i>Message from Starfleet captain.
Let's get to it.<i/></i>

1444
01:45:39,001 --> 01:45:42,015
He's right, if we stay here we're screwed
with Megatron in the other hangar.

1445
01:45:42,217 --> 01:45:44,654
Mission City is 22 miles away.
We're gonna sneak that cube

1446
01:45:44,655 --> 01:45:46,343
out of here and we're gonna hide it
somewhere in the city.

1447
01:45:46,344 --> 01:45:47,345
Good. Right.

1448
01:45:47,672 --> 01:45:49,964
But we cannot make a stand
without the air force.

1449
01:45:50,366 --> 01:45:52,379
This place must have
some kind of radio link...

1450
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:53,320
Yes.

1451
01:45:53,321 --> 01:45:54,492
Short waves...
- Right.

1452
01:45:54,492 --> 01:45:56,901
Sir, you got to figure out some way
to get word out in the open.

1453
01:45:57,003 --> 01:45:57,893
Let's move!

1454
01:45:57,894 --> 01:46:01,029
In the alien archives, sir.
There's an old army radio constant.

1455
01:46:01,030 --> 01:46:02,085
Will it work?

1456
01:46:02,086 --> 01:46:04,002
Anything's possible.
You just see that...

1457
01:46:04,045 --> 01:46:06,965
All right, Sam, get in the car!
Mr. Secretary, get our broods in the air

1458
01:46:06,966 --> 01:46:10,833
when we get to the city, we're gonna
find a radio on a F specter romero, ok?

1459
01:46:11,214 --> 01:46:12,383
Affirmative!

1460
01:46:12,689 --> 01:46:16,582
<i>Warning! NBE-1,
cryo chamber failing.<i/></i>

1461
01:46:17,561 --> 01:46:18,663
<i>Check that backup system!<i/></i>

1462
01:46:23,670 --> 01:46:24,967
<i>Well, get out of here!<i/></i>

1463
01:46:27,486 --> 01:46:29,699
Set up perimeter around
the yellow sealed door!

1464
01:46:30,595 --> 01:46:31,802
This way, this way,
this way!

1465
01:46:43,279 --> 01:46:46,297
I am Megatron!

1466
01:47:05,119 --> 01:47:07,122
The Cube's okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

1467
01:47:07,124 --> 01:47:08,417
Put its seatbelts on.

1468
01:47:22,610 --> 01:47:27,136
I live to serve you Lord Megatron.
- Where is The Cube?

1469
01:47:27,247 --> 01:47:29,553
The humans have taken it.

1470
01:47:32,669 --> 01:47:36,793
You fail me yet again, Starscream.
Get them!

1471
01:47:39,509 --> 01:47:41,521
Over here sir.

1472
01:47:43,538 --> 01:47:45,023
Give me a minute.
Give me a minute.

1473
01:47:45,925 --> 01:47:47,026
Come to me, now.
Come to me!

1474
01:47:50,072 --> 01:47:53,089
We're hot, we're alive!
- Where are the mics?

1475
01:47:54,196 --> 01:47:55,189
Mics?

1476
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:57,115
This doesn't work without
the mics, Simmons!

1477
01:47:57,116 --> 01:47:58,117
No, no, no,
no!

1478
01:47:58,544 --> 01:47:59,632
Let's find them.

1479
01:48:00,233 --> 01:48:03,451
Get in the chair.

1480
01:48:03,855 --> 01:48:06,470
How do we get the signal out?
How do we call the air force?!

1481
01:48:07,373 --> 01:48:12,403
Glenn, can you hotwire this computer
to transmit a tone, through the radio?

1482
01:48:12,404 --> 01:48:13,449
What good is that?

1483
01:48:13,461 --> 01:48:16,064
Morse code, you can use this
to transmit it through that.

1484
01:48:16,074 --> 01:48:17,936
Ok, I'll do it!
Turn around.

1485
01:48:18,238 --> 01:48:19,239
Ok, let's see..

1486
01:48:19,646 --> 01:48:22,060
Simmons, I need a screwdriver!

1487
01:48:33,326 --> 01:48:34,735
It's Optimus.

1488
01:48:52,842 --> 01:48:54,351
Almost done.

1489
01:48:55,860 --> 01:48:57,570
What the hell was that?

1490
01:49:00,689 --> 01:49:02,399
Barricade the door.

1491
01:49:06,625 --> 01:49:07,703
Watch out!

1492
01:49:08,304 --> 01:49:09,305
It's 5-4-6-3...

1493
01:49:15,375 --> 01:49:17,085
Here, put some rounds in it.

1494
01:49:22,316 --> 01:49:25,718
I got it, we're transmitting!
- Send exactly what I say!

1495
01:49:25,747 --> 01:49:27,120
Get out of the way,
get out of the way!

1496
01:49:28,047 --> 01:49:30,188
Burn you, sucker!
Burn!!

1497
01:49:30,189 --> 01:49:31,909
It's the Defense Secretary Keller.

1498
01:49:32,211 --> 01:49:33,552
In the North Com commander.

1499
01:49:36,803 --> 01:49:37,963
What was that?!

1500
01:49:38,078 --> 01:49:41,833
Authenticate emergency action,
Blackbird 1195...

1501
01:49:42,926 --> 01:49:45,656
Sir, I have authenticated air strike
order from Sector.

1502
01:50:10,302 --> 01:50:12,108
No, no, no!
- What?

1503
01:50:12,113 --> 01:50:13,422
Same cop.

1504
01:50:14,592 --> 01:50:15,825
Block 'em, block 'em,
block 'em!

1505
01:50:36,752 --> 01:50:38,049
Oh, my God.

1506
01:51:06,228 --> 01:51:07,938
Cool mom!

1507
01:51:33,391 --> 01:51:35,101
This is so not good.

1508
01:51:53,741 --> 01:51:55,019
He's behind the pillar.

1509
01:52:01,757 --> 01:52:03,240
Shoot that mother...

1510
01:52:03,267 --> 01:52:05,277
Maggie, cover fire!

1511
01:52:07,893 --> 01:52:09,805
The air force!
They're responding!

1512
01:52:14,533 --> 01:52:16,009
Sucker, burn!!

1513
01:52:23,485 --> 01:52:26,421
Yes, they're sending F-22's
to the city!

1514
01:52:27,223 --> 01:52:29,069
<i>Roger that. Scramble,
scramble, scramble!<i/></i>

1515
01:52:30,371 --> 01:52:31,869
<i>Strike, Dark Star, roll call.<i/></i>

1516
01:52:34,704 --> 01:52:36,172
<i>Is that looking up at a bright side?<i/></i>

1517
01:52:37,379 --> 01:52:38,872
<i>Push to kill box One Alpha.<i/></i>

1518
01:52:46,482 --> 01:52:47,980
All right, let's go!

1519
01:52:48,670 --> 01:52:49,683
Moving out!

1520
01:52:50,343 --> 01:52:52,356
Here, I've got short wave radios.

1521
01:52:53,261 --> 01:52:57,283
What am I supposed to do with these?
- Use them, that's all we got.

1522
01:52:58,090 --> 01:53:01,007
This is like, radio shack,
dinosaur radio stuff, man.

1523
01:53:01,008 --> 01:53:03,587
I'm only gonna get 20-30 miles
out of this thing.

1524
01:53:04,326 --> 01:53:06,338
Are there any aircraft
orbiting the city?

1525
01:53:07,847 --> 01:53:09,054
F-22 12 o'clock.

1526
01:53:09,055 --> 01:53:12,273
I want planes for air cover
and get Black Hawks on station

1527
01:53:12,274 --> 01:53:14,184
to extract that cube, got it?

1528
01:53:16,607 --> 01:53:18,713
Air force has arrived, pop smoke!

1529
01:53:19,114 --> 01:53:20,723
Raptor, Raptor, do you copy?

1530
01:53:22,232 --> 01:53:24,043
We have you on visual.

1531
01:53:25,048 --> 01:53:29,777
Green smoke is the mark. Provide air cover,
and vector Black Hawks for extraction.

1532
01:53:34,403 --> 01:53:36,617
It's Starscream!

1533
01:53:37,124 --> 01:53:38,629
Please tell me you copy.

1534
01:53:38,830 --> 01:53:41,957
Back up! Take cover!
Bumblebee.

1535
01:53:44,784 --> 01:53:46,659
No, no, no, no,
move!!

1536
01:53:46,978 --> 01:53:50,197
Back up! Back up!
- Retreat! Fall back!

1537
01:53:50,499 --> 01:53:52,009
Incoming!

1538
01:54:16,653 --> 01:54:18,565
Anybody hurt?!
Everyone okay?!

1539
01:54:28,121 --> 01:54:29,831
Bumblebee...

1540
01:54:30,100 --> 01:54:33,016
Your legs...

1541
01:54:34,976 --> 01:54:36,818
Back, back, back,
back!

1542
01:54:37,385 --> 01:54:38,784
You all right?

1543
01:54:39,689 --> 01:54:42,204
Please, God...
Bumblebee, get up!

1544
01:54:43,807 --> 01:54:45,105
Ratchett!

1545
01:54:46,529 --> 01:54:48,239
What the hell was that?!
- What are you talking about?!

1546
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:49,673
What do you mean what
I'm talking about?!

1547
01:54:49,674 --> 01:54:52,108
They shot at us!
- F-22 pilots will never fly

1548
01:54:52,108 --> 01:54:54,970
below buildings.
That's alien, that ain't friendly.

1549
01:54:54,979 --> 01:54:57,393
You got to get up.
You're ok.

1550
01:54:59,299 --> 01:55:00,200
Come on!

1551
01:55:00,410 --> 01:55:02,423
<i>Army Black Hawk inbound
to your location, over.</i>

1552
01:55:04,232 --> 01:55:09,288
Alpha 273, 10 miles.
November Victor, 1.2 clicks north.

1553
01:55:27,180 --> 01:55:28,277
Move out, let's go!

1554
01:55:43,264 --> 01:55:45,376
I'm not gonna leave you.

1555
01:56:23,805 --> 01:56:26,326
Come on, Decepticon punk!

1556
01:56:46,537 --> 01:56:48,148
Concentrate your fire!

1557
01:57:03,055 --> 01:57:04,764
Megatron.

1558
01:57:09,474 --> 01:57:13,041
It's Megatron, retreat!
Move! Fall back!

1559
01:57:17,119 --> 01:57:18,829
Fall back!

1560
01:57:28,488 --> 01:57:31,481
Move out!
- We need air cover down here, now!

1561
01:57:37,639 --> 01:57:39,150
Sam, help me with this.

1562
01:57:43,273 --> 01:57:47,466
Oh, you got me Megatron.
- Come here, you little creepner.

1563
01:57:47,568 --> 01:57:50,067
You want a piece of me?!
You want a piece?!

1564
01:57:50,069 --> 01:57:52,730
No, I want two!

1565
01:57:54,034 --> 01:57:55,946
What's going on?

1566
01:57:57,152 --> 01:57:59,967
Sir, that tank thing is
getting back up!

1567
01:58:00,688 --> 01:58:02,789
These things just don't die.

1568
01:58:06,226 --> 01:58:07,950
Now a second..

1569
01:58:07,953 --> 01:58:09,552
Wrap it around the head.

1570
01:58:09,552 --> 01:58:10,712
Sam!

1571
01:58:11,126 --> 01:58:12,545
Where's The Cube?
- Right there.

1572
01:58:12,913 --> 01:58:15,360
Okay, you got to wrap it around
the base and around his neck.

1573
01:58:15,986 --> 01:58:18,021
Epps, get those Black Hawks here!

1574
01:58:19,322 --> 01:58:20,347
That building...

1575
01:58:24,660 --> 01:58:25,651
Okay.

1576
01:58:26,125 --> 01:58:29,107
All right, I can't leave my guys
back there, so here, take this flare.

1577
01:58:29,143 --> 01:58:31,910
There's a tall white building
with statues on top

1578
01:58:31,912 --> 01:58:35,129
go to the roof, set the flare,
signal the chopper.

1579
01:58:35,133 --> 01:58:37,392
I can't do it!
- Listen to me, you're a soldier now!

1580
01:58:38,341 --> 01:58:39,390
All right?

1581
01:58:39,391 --> 01:58:42,886
I need you to take this Cube, get it into
military hands while we hold them off.

1582
01:58:42,887 --> 01:58:44,535
Or a lot of people are gonna die.

1583
01:58:44,964 --> 01:58:47,419
You got to go. You got to go.
You need to go.

1584
01:58:47,420 --> 01:58:50,017
No, I'm not leaving until I get
Bumblebee out of here, okay?

1585
01:58:52,378 --> 01:58:56,121
Army Black Hawk, requesting immediate evac,
a civilian boy with precious cargo,

1586
01:58:56,125 --> 01:58:57,913
Headed to rooftop marked by flare.

1587
01:58:58,416 --> 01:59:01,333
Sam, we will protect you.
- Ok.

1588
01:59:03,729 --> 01:59:05,356
<i>Epps, where are those planes?<i/></i>

1589
01:59:05,630 --> 01:59:07,369
Sam...

1590
01:59:10,085 --> 01:59:14,109
No matter what happens, I'm
really glad I got in that car with you.

1591
01:59:17,529 --> 01:59:20,446
Sam, get to the building!
- Move!

1592
01:59:22,822 --> 01:59:24,047
Hit it!

1593
01:59:27,052 --> 01:59:28,349
Cover fire!

1594
01:59:35,432 --> 01:59:36,641
Watch out!

1595
01:59:42,372 --> 01:59:45,071
Girl, get that tow truck out of here!
- I'm going, I'm going!

1596
01:59:45,410 --> 01:59:46,903
Get out of here, now!

1597
02:00:15,067 --> 02:00:17,382
Megatron!
- Prime!

1598
02:00:43,361 --> 02:00:48,069
Humans don't deserve to live.
- They deserve to choose for themselves!

1599
02:00:48,231 --> 02:00:50,681
Then, you will die with them!

1600
02:00:56,410 --> 02:00:59,453
Join them in extinction!

1601
02:01:17,938 --> 02:01:19,047
Keep moving Sam.

1602
02:01:20,517 --> 02:01:21,647
Don't stop!

1603
02:01:54,052 --> 02:01:55,964
Sam, get to the building!

1604
02:02:04,212 --> 02:02:06,325
Give me that Cube, boy!

1605
02:02:19,099 --> 02:02:21,311
That jerk just damped my car.

1606
02:02:42,189 --> 02:02:44,547
You're not gonna get me,
you're not gonna get me!

1607
02:02:49,399 --> 02:02:54,806
Surprise!
I smell you, boy!

1608
02:03:06,407 --> 02:03:07,993
Maggots!

1609
02:03:52,634 --> 02:03:54,847
I'll drive, you shoot!

1610
02:04:15,469 --> 02:04:18,084
This isn't going well.
- Shoot! Shoot!

1611
02:05:03,802 --> 02:05:05,264
Nice shot.

1612
02:05:05,465 --> 02:05:08,583
Ok, he's definitely dead now.
- Let's go, we've got business.

1613
02:05:24,134 --> 02:05:27,914
Hey! I'm over here!

1614
02:05:39,892 --> 02:05:41,327
We got the boy.

1615
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:47,513
Watch out!

1616
02:05:48,028 --> 02:05:49,116
Missile!

1617
02:05:59,531 --> 02:06:01,295
Hang on Sam!

1618
02:06:16,886 --> 02:06:23,006
Is it fear or courage that compels you,
fleshling?

1619
02:06:38,312 --> 02:06:42,637
Give me the Allspark and
you may live to be my pet.

1620
02:06:49,178 --> 02:06:51,592
I'm never giving you this Allspark!

1621
02:06:51,827 --> 02:06:55,415
Oh, so unwise.

1622
02:07:06,579 --> 02:07:08,389
I got you boy.

1623
02:07:09,798 --> 02:07:11,810
Hold on to The Cube.

1624
02:07:32,737 --> 02:07:34,234
Disgusting.

1625
02:07:39,173 --> 02:07:40,682
Sam...

1626
02:07:44,404 --> 02:07:47,724
You risked your life,
to protect The Cube.

1627
02:07:48,327 --> 02:07:50,640
No sacrifice...

1628
02:07:51,043 --> 02:07:54,700
No victory.
- If I cannot defeat Megatron,

1629
02:07:54,763 --> 02:07:57,479
You must push The Cube into my chest.

1630
02:07:57,680 --> 02:08:01,503
I will sacrifice myself
to destroy it.

1631
02:08:01,504 --> 02:08:03,715
Get behind me.

1632
02:08:04,722 --> 02:08:10,254
It's you and me, Megatron.
- No, it's just me, Prime.

1633
02:08:12,977 --> 02:08:17,798
At the end of this day,
one shall stand, one shall fall.

1634
02:08:23,631 --> 02:08:28,568
You still fight for the weak,
that is why you lose!

1635
02:08:47,171 --> 02:08:49,183
Fighter jets in 60 seconds.

1636
02:08:49,485 --> 02:08:52,302
We got friendlies mixed with bad guys,
targets will be marked.

1637
02:08:54,634 --> 02:08:55,824
Bring the rain.

1638
02:08:57,431 --> 02:08:58,960
Let's kill these things.

1639
02:09:01,303 --> 02:09:02,361
Move, move, move!

1640
02:09:02,362 --> 02:09:04,660
Remember, aim blow.
Armor's weak out in the chest.

1641
02:09:14,735 --> 02:09:18,361
Target marked, still waiting.
- Coming on target, 20 seconds.

1642
02:09:25,196 --> 02:09:27,711
That's F-22, so stay away.

1643
02:09:32,964 --> 02:09:34,048
Move out!

1644
02:09:38,054 --> 02:09:39,351
Incoming!

1645
02:09:47,488 --> 02:09:49,313
<i>Weapon's armed.
Status green.<i/></i>

1646
02:10:08,303 --> 02:10:10,636
Roll out! Roll!

1647
02:10:17,358 --> 02:10:19,144
<i>Second wave's on approach.<i/></i>

1648
02:10:22,649 --> 02:10:24,466
<i>What is that?
Take it off!<i/></i>

1649
02:10:25,329 --> 02:10:26,820
<i>...there are massive amount
of break around...<i/></i>

1650
02:10:35,583 --> 02:10:37,830
<i>8 o'clock, on that guy!<i/></i>

1651
02:10:41,635 --> 02:10:44,044
<i>I can see on him.
Keep him in your sight.<i/></i>

1652
02:10:44,216 --> 02:10:45,269
Take 'em out!

1653
02:10:59,888 --> 02:11:00,869
<i>He's down!<i/></i>

1654
02:11:10,081 --> 02:11:13,522
Before I kill you...
Mine...

1655
02:11:13,761 --> 02:11:15,225
...Allspark!

1656
02:11:15,849 --> 02:11:19,068
Sam, put The Cube in my chest now!

1657
02:11:19,570 --> 02:11:20,571
Sam!

1658
02:11:21,480 --> 02:11:22,674
No, Sam!

1659
02:11:48,442 --> 02:11:50,253
Hold up.

1660
02:11:52,667 --> 02:11:56,289
You left me no choice, brother.

1661
02:12:05,242 --> 02:12:08,259
Sam, I owe you my life.

1662
02:12:09,366 --> 02:12:11,881
We are in your debt.

1663
02:12:30,490 --> 02:12:35,420
Prime, we couldn't save him.
- Oh Jazz...

1664
02:12:38,135 --> 02:12:40,953
We lost a great comrade.

1665
02:12:41,858 --> 02:12:46,485
But gained new ones, thank you,
all of you.

1666
02:12:46,486 --> 02:12:49,201
You honor us with your bravery.

1667
02:12:50,005 --> 02:12:52,219
Permission to speak, sir.

1668
02:12:52,521 --> 02:12:56,544
Permission granted, old friend.
- You speak now?

1669
02:12:57,752 --> 02:13:00,568
I wish to stay with the boy.

1670
02:13:00,569 --> 02:13:03,083
If that is his choice.

1671
02:13:07,308 --> 02:13:09,018
Yes.

1672
02:13:29,238 --> 02:13:32,557
Gentlemen, the president has
ordered Sector-7

1673
02:13:32,959 --> 02:13:36,480
be terminated, and the remains
of the dead aliens

1674
02:13:36,481 --> 02:13:38,291
disposed of.

1675
02:13:38,292 --> 02:13:42,817
The Laurencian Abyss, is 7 miles below
sea level, deepest place on our planet.

1676
02:13:44,024 --> 02:13:47,344
Massive depth and pressure there,
coupled with subfreezing temperatures

1677
02:13:47,345 --> 02:13:49,658
will crush them totally.

1678
02:13:51,468 --> 02:13:53,782
Leaving no evidence.

1679
02:14:00,120 --> 02:14:04,345
<i>With the Allspark gone,
we cannot return life to our planet.</i>

1680
02:14:05,854 --> 02:14:09,374
<i>And faith has yielded it's reward.</i>

1681
02:14:10,280 --> 02:14:12,465
<i>A new world to call...</i>

1682
02:14:12,512 --> 02:14:13,902
<i>Home.</i>

1683
02:14:19,434 --> 02:14:23,759
<i>We live among it's people now,
hiding in plain sight.</i>

1684
02:14:23,760 --> 02:14:26,073
<i>But watching over them in secret.</i>

1685
02:14:26,878 --> 02:14:29,721
<i>Waiting...
Protecting...</i>

1686
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:33,416
<i>I have witnessed their
capacity for courage.</i>

1687
02:14:34,322 --> 02:14:36,880
<i>And though we are worlds apart,</i>

1688
02:14:37,726 --> 02:14:42,168
<i>like us, there's more to them
than meets the eye.</i>

1689
02:14:43,777 --> 02:14:50,115
<i>I am Optimus Prime, and I send this message
to any surviving Autobots</i>

1690
02:14:50,116 --> 02:14:53,133
<i>taking refuge among the stars.</i>

1691
02:14:54,239 --> 02:14:56,553
<i>We are here...</i>

1692
02:14:56,554 --> 02:14:58,868

Can you shed any light on the
recent so called alien activity?

1695
02:15:26,322 --> 02:15:28,961
You know what... I think that...

1696
02:15:29,312 --> 02:15:31,962
If there was some sort of an alien...

1697
02:15:32,472 --> 02:15:33,918
..infestation..
- Yeah.

1698
02:15:34,564 --> 02:15:37,136
I think the government would be
the first to let you know. They...

1699
02:15:37,137 --> 02:15:40,143
The government would let us know.
- I mean, this is America...

1700
02:15:40,344 --> 02:15:44,983
You know that's how we know we live in
a free land because there's no secret.

1701
02:15:44,984 --> 02:15:47,550
They would say:
"Hey, duck and cover!"

1702
02:15:57,114 --> 02:16:00,967
Your head, is kind of different size
than it is on the television.
