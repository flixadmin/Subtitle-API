1
00:00:01,211 --> 00:00:04,115
My name is Oliver Queen.
For 5 years,

2
00:00:04,116 --> 00:00:08,067
I was stranded on an island
with only one goal--

3
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:09,736
survive.

4
00:00:09,738 --> 00:00:11,538
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,206
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:15,709
to use the list
of names he left me

7
00:00:15,711 --> 00:00:18,911
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:18,913 --> 00:00:21,881
To do this, I must
become someone else.

9
00:00:21,883 --> 00:00:25,669
I must become
something else.

10
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:27,514
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

11
00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:30,601
Felicity, I want you to find out
all you can about that notebook.

12
00:00:30,603 --> 00:00:32,603
I'll be driving your mother
around for a few days.

13
00:00:32,605 --> 00:00:34,254
She's not a suspect.

14
00:00:34,256 --> 00:00:36,223
Oliver, something's going on
in this city. You know it.

15
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:38,925
Walter, please. You've got
to stop looking into this.

16
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:40,194
It's not safe.

17
00:00:40,196 --> 00:00:42,062
Well, accidents tend
to befall people

18
00:00:42,064 --> 00:00:44,531
who are too curious.

19
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:46,984
And he won't be harmed?
It's done.

20
00:00:46,986 --> 00:00:49,570
Nor will ever discover your
involvement. You have my word.

21
00:00:49,572 --> 00:00:51,462
I'm not sure I'm ready
for the kind of commitment

22
00:00:51,487 --> 00:00:53,574
- that you're looking for.
- You can't be serious.

23
00:00:53,576 --> 00:00:55,125
This is me serious,
Laurel.

24
00:01:03,636 --> 00:01:04,835
Call Cayman Fidelity.

25
00:01:04,837 --> 00:01:06,420
Tell them their
favorite accountant

26
00:01:06,422 --> 00:01:09,256
is flying in to make
a special deposit

27
00:01:09,258 --> 00:01:12,426
for a <i>special</i> client.

28
00:01:16,064 --> 00:01:17,798
That elevator's supposed
to be on a key.

29
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,933
Go. Check it out.

30
00:01:49,297 --> 00:01:51,382
Harold Backman,

31
00:01:51,384 --> 00:01:53,717
you have failed
this city.

32
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,302
I'm only an accountant.

33
00:01:55,304 --> 00:01:56,970
I'm just the money.

34
00:01:56,972 --> 00:01:58,505
The money that leads
to extortion,

35
00:01:58,507 --> 00:02:00,307
kidnapping, and drugs.

36
00:02:00,309 --> 00:02:03,444
It's the destruction
of innocent lives!

37
00:02:03,446 --> 00:02:06,980
You think you scare me
more than the people I work for?

38
00:02:06,982 --> 00:02:09,850
No.

39
00:02:09,852 --> 00:02:11,852
They can deal with you.

40
00:02:16,524 --> 00:02:18,959
Hmm. Let me guess.

41
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:21,378
Some bad guy missing
his fancy new laptop.

42
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,864
Harold Backman. He's who
Starling City's worst call

43
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:26,050
when they want to
launder money in the Caymans.

44
00:02:26,052 --> 00:02:28,168
Shouldn't we just
turn this over to,

45
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,920
I don't know, the IRS?

46
00:02:29,922 --> 00:02:32,039
We will. Just as soon
as you return the money

47
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,924
to the rightful owners.

48
00:02:33,926 --> 00:02:36,310
Well, it sounds like
a very nice idea.

49
00:02:36,312 --> 00:02:37,511
Backman's files
are all protected

50
00:02:37,513 --> 00:02:39,480
with an asymmetric
encryption algorithm.

51
00:02:39,482 --> 00:02:43,000
Really? So it's gonna
take a while to break in.

52
00:02:43,002 --> 00:02:44,651
Days, at least.

53
00:02:44,653 --> 00:02:46,854
Better get started, then.

54
00:02:50,325 --> 00:02:53,911
At the risk of ending up
with an arrow in my eye,

55
00:02:53,913 --> 00:02:55,696
can I ask...

56
00:02:55,698 --> 00:02:57,581
When are you planning
on making peace with Diggle?

57
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,333
He's the one who left,
Felicity.

58
00:02:59,335 --> 00:03:01,034
I did everything I could
to stop him.

59
00:03:01,036 --> 00:03:02,953
Except apologize.

60
00:03:02,955 --> 00:03:05,539
You promised you'd help him track
down Floyd Lawton and then you--

61
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,574
Made a choice
that I can life with.

62
00:03:07,576 --> 00:03:10,127
If he can't,
then I don't need him.

63
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:11,912
I need to get back to the club.
Oliver--

64
00:03:11,914 --> 00:03:13,514
Let me know
when you break in.

65
00:03:16,851 --> 00:03:19,436
I wish someone would
send me off to the Caymans.

66
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,275
Yes, I know it's been
6 months. But--

67
00:03:27,562 --> 00:03:30,697
I am very well aware
of the statistics.

68
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:34,601
But I haven't given up hope
and neither should you.

69
00:03:34,603 --> 00:03:38,104
That didn't sound
too good.

70
00:03:38,106 --> 00:03:39,606
Oh, it's fine.

71
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:41,125
Who were you talking to?

72
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:44,128
Just the insurance company.

73
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,465
They insist on paying out
Walter's life insurance policy.

74
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:50,951
I know we haven't talked
about Walter in a while,

75
00:03:50,953 --> 00:03:54,087
but I--I miss him, too.

76
00:03:54,089 --> 00:03:57,307
It's like losing dad
all over again.

77
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:03,063
You look radiant.

78
00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:04,798
Flatterer.

79
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,651
I think you're
the last to arrive.

80
00:04:07,653 --> 00:04:09,153
How's Tommy?

81
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:11,071
Tommy is Tommy.
How's Oliver?

82
00:04:11,073 --> 00:04:12,823
Still in bed.
It's only noon.

83
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,360
Well, look who
I just found.

84
00:04:16,362 --> 00:04:18,612
Get lost trying
to find the house?

85
00:04:18,614 --> 00:04:20,030
You say that as if
your driveway's

86
00:04:20,032 --> 00:04:21,481
not longer
than most roads.

87
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:22,616
Can I get anyone
anything else? Frank?

88
00:04:22,618 --> 00:04:23,667
We're fine, dear,
thank you.

89
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,336
Oh, excuse me.

90
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:32,042
Hello, Mrs. Queen.
I'm sorry to bother you at home.

91
00:04:32,044 --> 00:04:35,345
Oh, no, no. Don't be silly, Walter.
Come in, please.

92
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:39,883
You're here
to see Robert.

93
00:04:39,885 --> 00:04:41,852
Yes. There's just some
papers he needs to sign

94
00:04:41,854 --> 00:04:43,470
for the stock offering.

95
00:04:43,472 --> 00:04:45,055
Well, he's in some
private meeting right now,

96
00:04:45,057 --> 00:04:46,506
but you're welcome
to wait for him in his study.

97
00:04:46,508 --> 00:04:47,691
Thank you.

98
00:04:47,693 --> 00:04:48,842
Unless you'd like
to help me

99
00:04:48,844 --> 00:04:50,343
get my children
out of the house.

100
00:04:50,345 --> 00:04:52,345
You don't have
children, do you, Walter?

101
00:04:52,347 --> 00:04:53,947
Not yet, I'm afraid.

102
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:55,949
Well, save yourself
the trouble and don't.

103
00:04:55,951 --> 00:04:57,868
They eventually
all turn into teenagers.

104
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:02,122
Adam Hunt
was reluctant at first,

105
00:05:02,124 --> 00:05:04,625
but was more cooperative
upon being informed

106
00:05:04,627 --> 00:05:06,326
we knew about
his embezzlement.

107
00:05:06,328 --> 00:05:08,328
Police communication system
could use an upgrade.

108
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,964
I think Mr. Hunt
can be persuaded

109
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:13,083
to make an anonymous
donation.

110
00:05:13,085 --> 00:05:16,253
Well, that will certainly
cure what ails this city.

111
00:05:16,255 --> 00:05:18,338
What's that, Malcolm?

112
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,258
We're emptying the Atlantic
with a tablespoon.

113
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,311
For years we've been forcing
the city's worst to do what is best,

114
00:05:24,313 --> 00:05:26,346
leverage them to help us
save the city.

115
00:05:26,348 --> 00:05:28,214
But it's... not working.

116
00:05:28,216 --> 00:05:30,884
Crime in the Glades
is rising.

117
00:05:30,886 --> 00:05:32,269
The cancer is spreading.

118
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:35,055
We just need to...
Take some more time.

119
00:05:35,057 --> 00:05:37,858
Did Rebecca get more time?
Did the man who raped Frank's daughter

120
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,027
give her any quarter?

121
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:43,280
Everyone in this room has lost
something or someone to the Glades.

122
00:05:43,282 --> 00:05:46,366
And we have committed
ourselves to fixing it.

123
00:05:46,368 --> 00:05:49,703
But what have we truly
accomplished?

124
00:05:49,705 --> 00:05:51,788
Nothing.

125
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,707
Maybe it's because
the Glades can't be fixed.

126
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:56,260
You're saying we should
abandon the project?

127
00:05:56,262 --> 00:05:57,911
Yes.

128
00:05:57,913 --> 00:06:00,764
In favor of a new
undertaking.

129
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:03,934
Like Ben Tre in Vietnam.

130
00:06:03,936 --> 00:06:07,854
The village must be destroyed
before it can be saved.

131
00:06:07,856 --> 00:06:10,357
Are you suggesting
we somehow...

132
00:06:10,359 --> 00:06:12,258
level the Glades?

133
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,744
Down to the bedrock.

134
00:06:13,746 --> 00:06:16,563
Only then can we truly

135
00:06:16,565 --> 00:06:19,816
rebuild Starling City
and make it safer for everyone.

136
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:21,702
That's 24 square blocks.

137
00:06:21,704 --> 00:06:23,070
And if we did--

138
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:24,771
and I'm not saying
we should--

139
00:06:24,773 --> 00:06:25,989
if we did,

140
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:28,375
wouldn't suspicion
fall on us?

141
00:06:28,377 --> 00:06:29,876
Not if the destruction

142
00:06:29,878 --> 00:06:32,329
appears to be caused
by a natural disaster.

143
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:34,464
You've always had something of
a God complex, Malcolm.

144
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:36,449
It's part of your charm.

145
00:06:36,451 --> 00:06:39,086
But even you can't create
a natural disaster.

146
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:42,622
Have you ever heard of
Unidac Industries?

147
00:06:42,624 --> 00:06:44,641
It's a small company.

148
00:06:44,643 --> 00:06:47,961
They have an idea...

149
00:06:47,963 --> 00:06:51,098
An idea that will serve
our purposes.

150
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,400
My sources tell me they're
5 years away from prototype.

151
00:06:53,402 --> 00:06:57,654
And any undertaking of value
is worthy of patience.

152
00:06:57,656 --> 00:06:58,805
And restraint.

153
00:06:58,807 --> 00:07:00,073
One man alone

154
00:07:00,075 --> 00:07:01,307
can't save this city,
Robert,

155
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:02,943
and we both know that.

156
00:07:13,538 --> 00:07:17,290
Of all the gin joints
in all the towns in all the world,

157
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:18,675
she walks into mine.

158
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:21,628
This coffee's terrible,
Oliver.

159
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,598
That's what you get
for ordering coffee in a bar.

160
00:07:28,936 --> 00:07:30,437
You look tired.

161
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:32,589
Too much work?

162
00:07:32,591 --> 00:07:34,340
Too much crying.

163
00:07:34,342 --> 00:07:37,527
Tommy broke up with me.

164
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,864
What happened?

165
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:41,982
I have no idea.

166
00:07:41,984 --> 00:07:44,484
Things were good.
They were...

167
00:07:44,486 --> 00:07:47,537
Great, and then suddenly
he's packing up his things

168
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:50,690
and telling me
that it's over.

169
00:07:50,692 --> 00:07:53,026
Did he say anything
to you?

170
00:07:53,028 --> 00:07:56,797
No. Tommy and I haven't
talked very much since he quit.

171
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:59,699
But he'll come around.

172
00:07:59,701 --> 00:08:02,185
It's probably
just cold feet.

173
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:06,206
Like it was with you.

174
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:10,143
Oliver, you don't sleep with
your girlfriend's sister

175
00:08:10,145 --> 00:08:13,046
unless you're looking
to blow the relationship up.

176
00:08:13,048 --> 00:08:15,315
If you still want
to be with Tommy,

177
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:18,568
do what
we should have done.

178
00:08:20,304 --> 00:08:21,638
Talk to each other

179
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,240
and be honest.

180
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,494
Oliver,
I need to show you what--

181
00:08:27,496 --> 00:08:31,531
I just totally walked in
on a thing, didn't I?

182
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:33,200
I'm sorry, uh,
who are you?

183
00:08:33,202 --> 00:08:34,868
Nobody. I mean,
I'm not nobody.

184
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,153
I'm someone,
obviously.

185
00:08:36,155 --> 00:08:39,122
And so are you.
You're Laurel, right?

186
00:08:39,124 --> 00:08:41,842
That Laurel.
Gorgeous Laurel.

187
00:08:41,844 --> 00:08:44,461
This is Felicity.
She's setting up my Internet.

188
00:08:44,463 --> 00:08:46,847
Router. And I need
to show Oliver

189
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:48,799
something very important
related to it.

190
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:51,885
I'll let you go, then.

191
00:08:51,887 --> 00:08:54,420
Thank you for the coffee...

192
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:56,589
and the advice.

193
00:09:03,197 --> 00:09:04,314
Tell me you got in.

194
00:09:04,316 --> 00:09:06,233
Better. I hacked
Cayman Fidelity

195
00:09:06,235 --> 00:09:08,485
and put together a list all the
deposits Backman made last year.

196
00:09:08,487 --> 00:09:10,120
Felicity, what good
does that do us

197
00:09:10,122 --> 00:09:11,705
if we don't know
whose money it was?

198
00:09:11,707 --> 00:09:13,540
Look at the biggest deposit
Backman made last year.

199
00:09:13,542 --> 00:09:14,607
Bottom page.

200
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:17,110
$2 million on Decem--

201
00:09:17,112 --> 00:09:20,163
December 12.

202
00:09:20,165 --> 00:09:21,381
That's...

203
00:09:21,383 --> 00:09:22,999
The day Walter
disappeared.

204
00:09:23,001 --> 00:09:25,952
What if one of Backman's clients
was paid 2 million

205
00:09:25,954 --> 00:09:27,170
to kidnap Walter?

206
00:09:27,172 --> 00:09:30,456
Then we find out
which client it was...

207
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:32,476
And we use them
to find Walter.

208
00:09:35,918 --> 00:09:39,918

www.addic7ed.com

210
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,695
Ok, back-trace the account,
follow the money,

211
00:09:46,697 --> 00:09:48,647
hopefully it will lead us
to whoever kidnapped Walter.

212
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:51,331
After all this time,
do you think Walter might

213
00:09:51,332 --> 00:09:52,212
still really be alive?

214
00:09:52,373 --> 00:09:53,539
I don't know.

215
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,007
Got it.

216
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:57,009
Dominic Alonzo.

217
00:09:57,011 --> 00:09:58,678
- Name ring any bells?
- Yeah.

218
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,747
Alonzo runs the biggest
underground casino in Starling City

219
00:10:01,749 --> 00:10:03,716
when he's not busy
kidnapping.

220
00:10:03,718 --> 00:10:07,419
He looks like the kind of lowlife
someone would hire to kidnap Walter.

221
00:10:07,421 --> 00:10:09,088
How many arrows do you think
you'll have to put in him

222
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,641
before he gives up Walter's location?
Say a lot?

223
00:10:11,643 --> 00:10:13,025
It's not that simple.

224
00:10:13,027 --> 00:10:14,810
That casino has
its own private army.

225
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:16,812
We need to access
Alonzo's computer,

226
00:10:16,814 --> 00:10:19,598
but without setting off
any alarms.

227
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,767
Looks like we're gonna need
all the help we can get.

228
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:24,403
It's too bad there's not
someone else we could call.

229
00:10:24,405 --> 00:10:26,605
That's enough. We can
do this on our own.

230
00:10:26,607 --> 00:10:30,159
Well, then... Looks like someone's
going gambling tonight.

231
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:32,628
Those guys would make me
the minute that I walked in there.

232
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,665
Oliver Queen would never be
caught dead in a place like that.

233
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,550
I wasn't talking about you.

234
00:10:37,552 --> 00:10:38,634
Absolutely not.

235
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:40,119
I can count cards.

236
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:42,788
It's all probability theory
and mathematics.

237
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,090
Have you met me?

238
00:10:44,092 --> 00:10:45,891
Bottom line--I know my way
around a casino.

239
00:10:45,893 --> 00:10:47,426
Felicity, I'm not
letting you walk--

240
00:10:47,428 --> 00:10:48,961
The reason I joined you
in the first place

241
00:10:48,963 --> 00:10:50,730
was to find Walter,
and for the first time,

242
00:10:50,732 --> 00:10:54,567
we have a real chance
of finding him.

243
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:56,235
You have to let me do this.

244
00:11:01,141 --> 00:11:02,975
All right.

245
00:11:02,977 --> 00:11:06,112
But we do it my way.

246
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:09,999
Come on.

247
00:11:11,318 --> 00:11:13,319
I'm sorry I had to
pull you away

248
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:15,087
from whoever
you were meeting.

249
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:17,707
Oh, it's nothing.
Everyone's left already.

250
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:21,043
Besides, it's my fault for forgetting
to sign the K-5s this morning.

251
00:11:21,045 --> 00:11:24,597
I hope you don't mind me asking,
but is everything all right?

252
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:28,217
Just, uh, taking care
of some odds and ends.

253
00:11:28,219 --> 00:11:30,720
Well, if ever you need
a friendly ear.

254
00:11:30,722 --> 00:11:32,521
You're a good man, Walter.

255
00:11:43,867 --> 00:11:46,152
I thought you'd left.

256
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:48,788
I'm still waiting
for your answer.

257
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,740
How can you even think
of doing this?

258
00:11:50,742 --> 00:11:53,042
That place took
your soul, Robert.

259
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:56,329
Doing this won't give it back.

260
00:11:56,331 --> 00:11:58,664
It won't bring back
Rebecca, either.

261
00:12:06,506 --> 00:12:10,142
It still feels like
yesterday, that day.

262
00:12:10,144 --> 00:12:13,012
When she called my cell
phone for the first time,

263
00:12:13,014 --> 00:12:15,514
I remember being annoyed.

264
00:12:15,516 --> 00:12:19,051
She knew I was busy,
so I just let it ring.

265
00:12:20,354 --> 00:12:23,906
When she called back
a minute later,

266
00:12:23,908 --> 00:12:28,060
I shut my phone off.

267
00:12:28,062 --> 00:12:30,996
A little after midnight,
two SCPD officers

268
00:12:30,998 --> 00:12:33,565
showed up in my office.

269
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:37,837
All I remember them
saying was...

270
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,923
She'd been shot.

271
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:44,576
Murdered in the Glades.

272
00:12:46,046 --> 00:12:50,466
After the cops left, I sat in my
office the rest of the night

273
00:12:50,468 --> 00:12:52,852
listening to Rebecca's messages.

274
00:12:59,109 --> 00:13:02,611
She kept calling my name...

275
00:13:02,613 --> 00:13:04,563
Asking for help...

276
00:13:04,565 --> 00:13:08,033
until she was just
struggling to breathe,

277
00:13:08,035 --> 00:13:11,404
gasping for air.

278
00:13:11,406 --> 00:13:13,622
I listened to my wife die

279
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:15,741
over and over

280
00:13:15,743 --> 00:13:18,377
and over again.

281
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,465
I can't imagine, Malcolm.

282
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:23,916
Try.

283
00:13:23,918 --> 00:13:26,785
Imagine it was Moira
lying on that pavement,

284
00:13:26,787 --> 00:13:29,121
bleeding, calling your name.

285
00:13:29,123 --> 00:13:32,791
And then tell me you wouldn't
be prepared to do what I am.

286
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:44,570
What do you want?

287
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:46,021
Is that any way
to treat a girl

288
00:13:46,023 --> 00:13:49,408
who just walked up
6 flights of stairs?

289
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,477
No, it's not. Where are my manners?
Come on in.

290
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:53,479
Thank you.

291
00:13:56,616 --> 00:13:59,001
Welcome.

292
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,621
Did you do these?

293
00:14:02,623 --> 00:14:04,061
You know, Felicity,

294
00:14:04,086 --> 00:14:06,086
Oliver and I don't need
a relationship counselor.

295
00:14:06,844 --> 00:14:09,545
That hasn't been
my experience.

296
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:10,930
We have a lead
on Walter.

297
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:14,300
I need you to come back
and help us find him.

298
00:14:14,302 --> 00:14:15,684
Oliver put you up to this?

299
00:14:15,686 --> 00:14:17,269
No.

300
00:14:17,271 --> 00:14:19,171
He doesn't even know
I'm here.

301
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:22,107
Look.

302
00:14:22,109 --> 00:14:23,692
I know Oliver
didn't help you

303
00:14:23,694 --> 00:14:24,894
find your brother's killer

304
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:27,446
and that hurts.
It sucks. But...

305
00:14:27,448 --> 00:14:30,232
You gotta know
if it was your life on the line

306
00:14:30,234 --> 00:14:33,685
on not just your...
very understandable vendetta,

307
00:14:33,687 --> 00:14:35,704
he would be there
for you.

308
00:14:35,706 --> 00:14:37,039
No hesitation.

309
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,474
And I don't want
a partnership

310
00:14:38,476 --> 00:14:41,060
with those kind
of qualifications, Felicity.

311
00:14:41,062 --> 00:14:46,398
I know Oliver's religiously
against admitting he's wrong.

312
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,869
Truth is, he needs you.

313
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:55,307
Yeah.

314
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:58,043
And when Oliver
is ready to say that,

315
00:14:58,045 --> 00:15:01,013
he knows where I live.

316
00:15:04,986 --> 00:15:06,402
Sorry for bothering you.

317
00:15:06,404 --> 00:15:08,821
It's no bother.
I hope you find him.

318
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:28,574
Wow, you really
look like your father.

319
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:31,544
I never thought so before,

320
00:15:31,546 --> 00:15:33,412
but just now
I saw him in you.

321
00:15:33,414 --> 00:15:36,081
What are you doing here?

322
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,466
We need to talk.

323
00:15:37,468 --> 00:15:39,735
I said everything
I have to say.

324
00:15:39,737 --> 00:15:41,587
Well, I haven't.
Tommy, I love you,

325
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:43,522
and I think that
you still love me,

326
00:15:43,524 --> 00:15:45,357
so whatever problems
that you think that we have,

327
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:47,309
I know that if we
face them together--

328
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:48,944
You don't understand.

329
00:15:48,946 --> 00:15:50,229
Then help me understand.

330
00:15:50,231 --> 00:15:52,565
If our relationship
is gonna end, at least

331
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:54,366
let it end with honesty.

332
00:15:56,603 --> 00:15:58,937
Ok, Laurel.

333
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:02,207
Honestly...

334
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:05,044
You belong with Oliver.

335
00:16:06,263 --> 00:16:08,113
Excuse me?

336
00:16:08,115 --> 00:16:10,916
He's still in love
with you.

337
00:16:10,918 --> 00:16:13,953
I have a meeting.

338
00:16:23,157 --> 00:16:24,624
You ready?

339
00:16:24,626 --> 00:16:25,858
I think so.

340
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:27,452
Just to be clear,

341
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,120
the plan is for me
to get caught counting cards

342
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,756
in an underground casino
filled with hardened criminals.

343
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,758
So you can get a friendly
warning from Alonzo

344
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,544
and plant a bug
on his office computer.

345
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:39,764
Right. Which will
hopefully lead us to Walter.

346
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:43,000
That is assuming I get
the friendly warning

347
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,137
and not a bullet.

348
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,589
You don't
have to do this.

349
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:49,674
Yes, I do.

350
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,643
Ok. If anything happens,

351
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:53,445
I'm right outside.

352
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:55,513
Ok.

353
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:04,823
Password?

354
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:06,791
Snapdragon.

355
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:10,662
Password is snapdragon.

356
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,466
Password?

357
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:15,867
Snapdragon.

358
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,321
What do you see?

359
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:39,691
6 armed guards,
2 pit bosses,

360
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:41,943
and a floor man.

361
00:17:41,945 --> 00:17:43,862
No slot machines.
How do you call yourself a casino

362
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:45,196
without any Lucky 7s?

363
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,498
Stay focused, please.

364
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,583
I'll be with you
the entire time.

365
00:17:48,585 --> 00:17:50,418
Thanks.

366
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,838
It feels really good
having you inside me.

367
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,874
And by "you,"
I mean your voice.

368
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:58,176
And by "me," I mean my ear.

369
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:59,527
I'm gonna stop talking
right now.

370
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:01,179
That would be my preference.

371
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:11,589
One stack of High Society,
please.

372
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,566
Thank you for stopping by.

373
00:18:21,568 --> 00:18:23,234
Of course.

374
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:26,604
Uh, you said
you had news.

375
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:27,739
I do.

376
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:29,874
It's ready.

377
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:33,545
The Markov device passed its final
beta test this morning.

378
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:36,280
Applied Sciences
is loading it on a truck

379
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:40,802
bound for Starling City
as we speak.

380
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:44,505
Well...

381
00:18:44,507 --> 00:18:47,425
Congratulations
are in order, then.

382
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:49,126
To both of us.

383
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,513
Moira, you may be
surprised to know

384
00:18:52,515 --> 00:18:55,516
that I sometimes
waver in my convictions.

385
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:58,686
But your friendship,
your endless support...

386
00:18:58,688 --> 00:19:02,690
always gives me
the strength to carry on.

387
00:19:02,692 --> 00:19:06,494
After all, you and I
will always have a connection.

388
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,582
I'm just sorry that
Robert's not here

389
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:12,917
to celebrate with us.

390
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:18,155
I'm sorry I had to
take him from you.

391
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:22,844
If anyone's to blame
for his death, it's me.

392
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:28,466
To Robert.

393
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:30,351
To Rebecca.

394
00:19:30,353 --> 00:19:33,104
Are you feeling all right?

395
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:36,724
I know tonight was
just another Ted Kord fund-raiser,

396
00:19:36,726 --> 00:19:40,511
but you were
surprisingly quiet.

397
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:44,232
Moira, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

398
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:46,367
Robert, if this
is what I think it is,

399
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:47,986
I don't want to know
her name. I don't--

400
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:51,539
No, it's about Malcolm.

401
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,409
He wants to level the Glades.

402
00:19:54,411 --> 00:19:57,078
And how does Malcolm
propose to evacuate

403
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,048
an entire section
of the city?

404
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,417
He doesn't.

405
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:07,472
Robert, that doesn't
sound like you.

406
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:11,676
Because I'm not the man
you think I am.

407
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,816
About a month before
the opening of Steele factory,

408
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,384
the one in the Glades,

409
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,404
I was approached
by a local councilman.

410
00:20:23,406 --> 00:20:25,406
He wanted money.

411
00:20:25,408 --> 00:20:28,226
Told me that's the way
everything was done in the Glades.

412
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:32,080
I told him I'd never
paid a bribe in my life.

413
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:34,515
We got into an argument.

414
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,236
I didn't want to hurt him.

415
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,106
I swear, Moira.

416
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,758
But he fell.

417
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,544
Oh, dear God.

418
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:48,429
Oh, dear God.

419
00:20:48,431 --> 00:20:54,102
The work I'm doing
with Malcolm, with the list,

420
00:20:54,104 --> 00:20:55,436
it's my penance, Moira.

421
00:20:55,438 --> 00:20:57,254
What, so you'll atone
for one murder

422
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,558
by committing hundreds,
thousands?

423
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,361
Oh...

424
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:05,063
Robert.

425
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:07,431
You listen to me.

426
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:10,985
Whatever wrongs
you've committed,

427
00:21:10,987 --> 00:21:13,488
whatever mistakes
you've made,

428
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:18,760
preventing this horror
is your chance to make it right.

429
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,747
Please...

430
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:27,802
Please, Robert, promise me
you won't let this happen.

431
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,767
Oh!

432
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:43,901
Blackjack!

433
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,608
Miss...

434
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,909
Can you come with me?

435
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,144
Is something wrong?

436
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:54,779
Get up.

437
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:57,648
Oh, since you ask
so nicely.

438
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,697
Oh, there's the bathroom.

439
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:04,256
I should have known
the manager's office

440
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:07,925
would be down the hall
and to the right of the bathroom.

441
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,326
Mr. Alonzo.

442
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:15,600
Have a seat.

443
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,772
What's your name?

444
00:22:20,774 --> 00:22:22,523
Megan.

445
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:27,962
Do you know where the term
"86" comes from, Megan?

446
00:22:27,964 --> 00:22:30,114
As it happens, I do.
It's from prohibition.

447
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:32,784
There was a--
an illegal casino,

448
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:35,119
not like this one,

449
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:37,789
located at 86 Bedford
street in New York,

450
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:41,292
and... God, you know,
I'm just gonna stop talking.

451
00:22:41,294 --> 00:22:43,244
Now it means
to ban someone,

452
00:22:43,246 --> 00:22:46,130
someone who's cheating.
You're 86'd.

453
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:47,965
Leave your chips and go.

454
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:49,834
Thank you.

455
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:52,336
Thank you.

456
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:57,925
Oh, yeah, Megan,
one more thing.

457
00:22:57,927 --> 00:23:00,645
You see, the thing
about card counters is, uh...

458
00:23:00,647 --> 00:23:04,065
sometimes they work...

459
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:07,318
with a partner.

460
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:14,325
You're gonna be really upset
when you meet my partner.

461
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,096
Aah!

462
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:01,973
I heard you never miss.

463
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:03,607
I don't.

464
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:09,997
Uhh!

465
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:11,949
Where's Walter Steele?

466
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,285
What? What a you
talking about, huh?

467
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,954
6 months ago
you had him kidnapped!

468
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,506
It was just a job.
I was given a name.

469
00:24:18,508 --> 00:24:20,725
I didn't ask
any questions.

470
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:23,644
Last chance.

471
00:24:23,646 --> 00:24:24,896
Where is he?

472
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:26,831
Below ground.

473
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:27,882
You're lying!

474
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:28,983
I'm not.
I delivered him

475
00:24:28,985 --> 00:24:30,968
and they killed him.

476
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,654
I heard the gunshot.

477
00:24:33,656 --> 00:24:36,140
He's dead.

478
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:06,356
Oh, let's see that blouse
in that violet shade.

479
00:25:06,357 --> 00:25:09,061
You're
a miracle worker, Thea.

480
00:25:09,062 --> 00:25:12,896
Oh, when it comes to shopping,
it's not work, really.

481
00:25:15,517 --> 00:25:19,686
Hey. I'm teaching mom
the joys of online clothes shopping.

482
00:25:20,655 --> 00:25:22,990
Ollie?

483
00:25:22,992 --> 00:25:25,742
Are you ok?

484
00:25:29,764 --> 00:25:32,899
I need to talk to you both.

485
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:34,584
What is it?

486
00:25:34,586 --> 00:25:37,087
It's about Walter.

487
00:25:39,207 --> 00:25:42,059
Did the police
contact you?

488
00:25:43,695 --> 00:25:46,513
One of Mr. Diggle's
army buddies

489
00:25:46,515 --> 00:25:49,232
works for the FBI now.

490
00:25:49,234 --> 00:25:51,418
And they got news tonight.

491
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,469
No.

492
00:25:52,471 --> 00:25:55,222
I'm very sorry.

493
00:25:55,224 --> 00:25:57,474
No, no, no, no, no.

494
00:25:57,476 --> 00:26:01,812
There must be
some mistake.

495
00:26:01,814 --> 00:26:04,097
Who did Mr. Diggle
talk to?

496
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:05,615
Did they find a body?

497
00:26:05,617 --> 00:26:08,318
Mom...

498
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,569
Walter's gone.

499
00:26:09,571 --> 00:26:10,904
No. This isn't right.

500
00:26:10,906 --> 00:26:12,956
- Where are you going?
- Out.

501
00:26:12,958 --> 00:26:14,324
- It's 10:00 at night.
- I need some air.

502
00:26:14,326 --> 00:26:15,709
Mom, you're in shock.

503
00:26:15,711 --> 00:26:18,712
Don't tell me what
or how I feel, Oliver.

504
00:26:18,714 --> 00:26:21,781
Why is she acting
like that?

505
00:26:21,783 --> 00:26:23,633
Come here.

506
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:36,396
I suspect I know
what this is about.

507
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:39,632
You and I got in bed
with Malcolm

508
00:26:39,634 --> 00:26:42,152
to cure what ails
this city.

509
00:26:46,441 --> 00:26:48,909
But I think you agree,
killing thousands of people

510
00:26:48,911 --> 00:26:50,193
is not the answer.

511
00:26:50,195 --> 00:26:52,245
Indeed. If we
were to wage a war

512
00:26:52,247 --> 00:26:55,315
with Malcolm Merlyn,
we will lose.

513
00:26:55,317 --> 00:26:58,618
My family has already
suffered enough.

514
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,588
And I have no desire
to endanger mine.

515
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,174
Fortunately,
there's another option.

516
00:27:05,993 --> 00:27:09,629
6 months ago, Malcolm
started buying up buildings

517
00:27:09,631 --> 00:27:11,098
in the Glades

518
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,233
through an offshore company
called Sagittarius.

519
00:27:13,235 --> 00:27:15,769
And he made it sound as if this
undertaking of his

520
00:27:15,771 --> 00:27:17,687
was a recent inspiration.

521
00:27:17,689 --> 00:27:19,890
If you're right,

522
00:27:19,892 --> 00:27:21,808
he has been thinking
about this for months.

523
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,677
If he can't rebuild it,

524
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:26,229
he'll abandon the project.

525
00:27:26,231 --> 00:27:29,649
How much of the Glades
does he already have?

526
00:27:29,651 --> 00:27:31,318
About a third.

527
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,188
Now, if we can quietly
buy up the rest before he can,

528
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,991
he won't be able to gain
the control he needs.

529
00:27:37,993 --> 00:27:40,427
We will need capital.

530
00:27:40,429 --> 00:27:42,245
Do you still have
your contacts in China?

531
00:27:42,247 --> 00:27:45,799
I already have a flight planned
for Shanghai tomorrow.

532
00:27:45,801 --> 00:27:47,534
Come with me.

533
00:27:47,536 --> 00:27:50,086
We shouldn't travel together.
Malcolm might get worried.

534
00:27:50,088 --> 00:27:52,806
He already knows
I have my doubts.

535
00:27:52,808 --> 00:27:55,392
Besides, I'm getting the urge
to take out the "Queen's Gambit"

536
00:27:55,394 --> 00:27:56,560
for another voyage.

537
00:27:56,562 --> 00:27:59,813
Dad! Do you have any cash?

538
00:27:59,815 --> 00:28:02,599
Jerk pizza guy
can't break a 100.

539
00:28:02,601 --> 00:28:04,518
Oliver, you remember
Mr. Chen?

540
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,019
- Hi.
- Hey.

541
00:28:06,021 --> 00:28:08,905
Waiting. Thank you.

542
00:28:12,493 --> 00:28:14,578
♪ 1, 2, 3, 4, tell me...

543
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,247
Pizza.

544
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,084
My hero.

545
00:28:21,086 --> 00:28:22,502
I'm starved.

546
00:28:26,908 --> 00:28:29,876
- Hey, Ollie.
- Yeah.

547
00:28:29,878 --> 00:28:31,845
Where do you keep
the bottle opener in this thing?

548
00:28:31,847 --> 00:28:34,581
Bottom drawer.

549
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:36,383
Did you talk to Ray today?

550
00:28:36,385 --> 00:28:38,468
About the ski trip?

551
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:41,588
No. He asked Jean
to move in with him last night.

552
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:44,608
Oh. Guess they've
been together forever.

553
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:47,444
We've been together longer.

554
00:28:49,447 --> 00:28:50,947
Guess we have.

555
00:28:52,984 --> 00:28:56,236
I only bring this up because your
mom busted me yesterday.

556
00:28:56,238 --> 00:28:59,606
And obviously we can't
hang out at my house.

557
00:28:59,608 --> 00:29:01,208
Why? Because your father
threatened to tase me

558
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,210
the last time that I closed
the door to your bedroom?

559
00:29:03,212 --> 00:29:05,712
So wouldn't it be nice
to have a little place of our own?

560
00:29:05,714 --> 00:29:08,081
Yeah.

561
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:09,683
Maybe.

562
00:29:09,685 --> 00:29:12,669
This is a little fast,
Laurel.

563
00:29:12,671 --> 00:29:14,954
I know that you like
to think of yourself

564
00:29:14,956 --> 00:29:18,291
as a bad boy,
Oliver Queen, but...

565
00:29:18,293 --> 00:29:21,278
I feel like we're ready
to take the next step.

566
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,246
Yeah.

567
00:29:24,982 --> 00:29:26,933
Let's do it.

568
00:29:31,822 --> 00:29:33,573
Mm.

569
00:29:40,665 --> 00:29:42,315
You lied to me.

570
00:29:42,317 --> 00:29:43,816
We had a deal.

571
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:48,922
Gong dag. Gong-pa-ma-tsom.

572
00:29:50,925 --> 00:29:52,292
What are you talking about?

573
00:29:52,294 --> 00:29:53,927
You promised if I cooperated

574
00:29:53,929 --> 00:29:56,379
with the Undertaking,
Walter wouldn't be harmed!

575
00:29:56,381 --> 00:29:57,881
He hasn't been.
I'm a man of my word, Moira.

576
00:29:57,883 --> 00:30:00,133
We both know
better than that.

577
00:30:00,135 --> 00:30:03,103
And I know...

578
00:30:03,105 --> 00:30:05,639
I know you've
had him killed.

579
00:30:06,942 --> 00:30:08,358
Turn on the camera.

580
00:30:16,183 --> 00:30:18,451
Oh, Walter...

581
00:30:18,453 --> 00:30:21,037
Like you said, Moira,
we have an agreement.

582
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,645
Walter would stay
in my custody until

583
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,037
the Undertaking was complete.

584
00:30:25,877 --> 00:30:28,011
We're both in this together.

585
00:30:40,877 --> 00:30:42,761
I've been sitting
in the dark all night , too.

586
00:30:42,763 --> 00:30:44,763
All these months
I kept thinking

587
00:30:44,765 --> 00:30:47,716
if I could find a clue,
I could get a lead on him.

588
00:30:48,118 --> 00:30:51,219
Guess it wouldn't
have mattered.

589
00:30:57,143 --> 00:30:59,594
I can't imagine what
your family's going through.

590
00:31:01,831 --> 00:31:04,933
Walter's alive.

591
00:31:04,935 --> 00:31:06,668
What?

592
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,403
But Alonzo said--

593
00:31:08,405 --> 00:31:11,640
I need you to pull up
Malcolm Merlyn's phone records.

594
00:31:11,642 --> 00:31:14,142
He made a call
from his office

595
00:31:14,144 --> 00:31:17,479
to wherever Walter
is being kept at 10:30 p.m.

596
00:31:17,481 --> 00:31:18,914
Malcolm Merlyn?

597
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:21,983
Tommy's father?
Why would he kidnap Walter?

598
00:31:21,985 --> 00:31:24,152
Felicity.

599
00:31:33,829 --> 00:31:36,131
L.U.D. showed he made a call
to a tenement complex

600
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:37,665
located in Bludhaven.

601
00:31:40,103 --> 00:31:42,354
Can you pull up
a satellite view?

602
00:31:42,356 --> 00:31:43,805
Ok.

603
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,628
That's a lot of security
for low-income housing.

604
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:53,148
There's two guards
stationed at all access points.

605
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,783
There's just one
on the roof.

606
00:31:54,785 --> 00:31:56,518
Exactly. There's no other
buildings in that area.

607
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,153
If you want to get
onto the roof,

608
00:31:58,155 --> 00:32:01,490
you're going to have to
jump off of something.

609
00:32:01,492 --> 00:32:03,492
I've got something.

610
00:32:41,948 --> 00:32:44,065
There's a problem in quadrant 4.

611
00:34:04,664 --> 00:34:07,249
Mr. Steele.

612
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:10,669
Walter.

613
00:34:10,671 --> 00:34:12,871
What?

614
00:34:12,873 --> 00:34:15,473
What's happening?

615
00:34:15,475 --> 00:34:17,292
You're going home.

616
00:34:32,101 --> 00:34:34,269
I thought I'd never
see you again.

617
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,725
I'm all right.

618
00:34:43,262 --> 00:34:45,113
Welcome home, Walter.

619
00:34:45,115 --> 00:34:46,597
Thank you, son.

620
00:34:48,767 --> 00:34:52,770
Thea.

621
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:57,709
This is totally
a family thing, isn't it?

622
00:34:59,295 --> 00:35:01,112
I'm sorry, who are you?

623
00:35:01,114 --> 00:35:03,181
This is Felicity.

624
00:35:03,183 --> 00:35:05,133
She's my friend.

625
00:35:05,135 --> 00:35:06,251
Mine, too.

626
00:35:06,253 --> 00:35:07,886
It's good to see you.

627
00:35:07,888 --> 00:35:09,287
You, too.

628
00:35:09,289 --> 00:35:11,622
I'll let you guys
get back to your hugging.

629
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,485
Oliver.

630
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:25,603
We're all together again.

631
00:35:25,605 --> 00:35:27,638
Everything's
gonna be all right.

632
00:35:30,443 --> 00:35:33,144
Robert, I don't like
the idea of this.

633
00:35:33,146 --> 00:35:34,913
It's gonna be ok.

634
00:35:34,915 --> 00:35:37,148
Yeah, well, how long
will you be gone?

635
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:39,617
A few weeks. Maybe more,
depending on what I--

636
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:41,169
Why can't you just
fly to China?

637
00:35:41,171 --> 00:35:43,588
I think it's better
the less you know.

638
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,490
I just hate
that stupid boat.

639
00:35:45,492 --> 00:35:48,093
Look at me.

640
00:35:48,095 --> 00:35:51,129
I love you.

641
00:35:51,131 --> 00:35:52,497
Everything's gonna be fine.

642
00:35:52,499 --> 00:35:54,832
Ok.

643
00:35:54,834 --> 00:35:56,801
Hey.

644
00:35:56,803 --> 00:35:58,970
Got room for one more?

645
00:35:58,972 --> 00:36:00,338
No.

646
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,023
Mom, let me keep dad company.

647
00:36:02,025 --> 00:36:03,191
Oliver, you're in school.

648
00:36:03,193 --> 00:36:04,509
Not really.

649
00:36:04,511 --> 00:36:06,811
I tried to tell you that.

650
00:36:06,813 --> 00:36:09,514
I could use an extra hand
on the ship.

651
00:36:09,516 --> 00:36:10,681
Robert...

652
00:36:10,683 --> 00:36:12,650
Moira, let the kid

653
00:36:12,652 --> 00:36:15,487
take the boat out
with the old man.

654
00:36:15,489 --> 00:36:18,189
All right.

655
00:36:18,191 --> 00:36:19,574
All right.
But you promise me

656
00:36:19,576 --> 00:36:21,025
that you'll behave yourself.

657
00:36:21,027 --> 00:36:22,710
All right. I promise.

658
00:36:24,363 --> 00:36:26,131
I love you so much.

659
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:27,499
I love you, too.

660

♪ Everywhere you go

661
00:36:32,139 --> 00:36:33,338
I totally spaced.

662
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,672
I gotta call Tommy
and let him know

663
00:36:34,674 --> 00:36:36,424
I'm out of town
for a few weeks.

664
00:36:36,426 --> 00:36:39,310
I'll see you on board in 5.

665
00:36:43,232 --> 00:36:45,567
Sara? You here?

666
00:36:45,569 --> 00:36:49,487
Yeah, you might want to circle
around the block a few times,

667
00:36:49,489 --> 00:36:51,556
because your sister
just showed up.

668
00:36:53,075 --> 00:36:56,995
Hi. What are you doing here?

669
00:36:56,997 --> 00:36:58,229
You're leaving
for 3 weeks.

670
00:36:58,231 --> 00:37:01,732
I wanted to come say bye
to you in person.

671
00:37:05,754 --> 00:37:07,905
I'm glad you did.

672
00:37:07,907 --> 00:37:10,291
And...

673
00:37:10,293 --> 00:37:12,410
I wanted to bring you
something.

674
00:37:14,246 --> 00:37:16,131
Oh.

675
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:20,018
In case you get
lonely at sea.

676
00:37:25,192 --> 00:37:27,358
Thank you.

677
00:37:29,761 --> 00:37:31,929
Hey, is everything ok?

678
00:37:31,931 --> 00:37:33,865
I mean, I didn't totally
freak you out

679
00:37:33,867 --> 00:37:37,118
when I brought up the whole
apartment thing earlier, did I?

680
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,287
No.

681
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:40,938
Good.

682
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,106
No.

683
00:37:42,108 --> 00:37:43,774

00:37:51,468 --> 00:37:54,752
Yeah.

688
00:37:59,124 --> 00:38:00,391
Is it done?

689
00:38:00,393 --> 00:38:04,095
Yes. The bomb
is in place.

690
00:38:04,097 --> 00:38:05,897
And there's
a storm front

691
00:38:05,899 --> 00:38:08,983
moving in along the "Gambit's"
projected course.

692
00:38:08,985 --> 00:38:10,318
Ok.

693
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,354
When the "Queen's Gambit"
goes down,

694
00:38:13,356 --> 00:38:16,824
no one will suspect it's anything
other than an act of God.

695
00:38:35,461 --> 00:38:37,178
Oliver.

696
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,048
Ah. What a miracle.

697
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,799
How's Walter?

698
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:45,770
The police are saying that he
was rescued by the Vigilante.

699
00:38:45,772 --> 00:38:47,338
Yes, he was.

700
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,006
Has he said anything
about his ordeal?

701
00:38:49,008 --> 00:38:52,143
Was he able to identify
any of his captors?

702
00:38:52,145 --> 00:38:53,361
No.

703
00:38:53,363 --> 00:38:54,679
Hmm.

704
00:38:54,681 --> 00:38:57,448
That's too bad.

705
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,984
They'll get
what's coming to them.

706
00:39:02,154 --> 00:39:05,189
I'm just glad that
my family is back together.

707
00:39:05,191 --> 00:39:07,458
We all are.

708
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,361
Ollie.

709
00:39:10,363 --> 00:39:13,214
Excuse me.

710
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,671
Is Walter ok?

711
00:39:19,673 --> 00:39:21,973
I saw it on the news.

712
00:39:21,975 --> 00:39:23,625
Yeah.

713
00:39:25,194 --> 00:39:26,644
Are you ok?

714
00:39:26,646 --> 00:39:28,379
Of course.

715
00:39:28,381 --> 00:39:31,899
I promise you
now is not the time.

716
00:39:31,901 --> 00:39:34,218
It's you and Tommy.

717
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,653
You and me, actually.

718
00:39:35,655 --> 00:39:37,054
I talked to Tommy yesterday,

719
00:39:37,056 --> 00:39:38,856
and the reason
he broke up with me

720
00:39:38,858 --> 00:39:42,076
is because he thinks that you
and I still belong together.

721
00:39:42,078 --> 00:39:43,494
What did you say?

722
00:39:43,496 --> 00:39:45,196
Nothing.

723
00:39:45,198 --> 00:39:47,498
He walked out on me.

724
00:39:49,501 --> 00:39:53,454
I just want you
to be happy.

725
00:39:53,456 --> 00:39:55,957
It's what
I've always wanted.

726
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:59,910
Then will you please
go talk to Tommy for me?

727
00:39:59,912 --> 00:40:01,296
And say what?

728
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:02,913
Say that you and I
are over.

729
00:40:02,915 --> 00:40:06,551
That you're not
still in love with me.

730
00:40:06,553 --> 00:40:09,086
I can't do that.

731
00:40:09,088 --> 00:40:10,989
Why not?

732
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:15,092
Because it wouldn't be true.

733
00:40:17,262 --> 00:40:20,365
And I have enough lies
in my life already.

734
00:40:40,002 --> 00:40:41,969
I guess you do know
where I live.

735
00:40:41,971 --> 00:40:43,721
I've always known
where you live.

736
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:47,058
May I?

737
00:40:53,799 --> 00:40:55,817
I'm sorry.

738
00:41:00,138 --> 00:41:02,490
You were right.

739
00:41:02,492 --> 00:41:04,659
And I was wrong.

740
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:06,027
About Deadshot?

741
00:41:06,029 --> 00:41:07,845
About everything.

742
00:41:07,847 --> 00:41:11,816
About my mother and about her
involvement in the Undertaking.

743
00:41:11,818 --> 00:41:14,819
She lied to me.

744
00:41:14,821 --> 00:41:16,621
To Thea.

745
00:41:19,091 --> 00:41:21,843
She's working with
Malcolm Merlyn.

746
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:31,335
They're planning something.

747
00:41:31,337 --> 00:41:34,004
Something...

748
00:41:34,006 --> 00:41:36,023
Terrible.

749
00:41:36,025 --> 00:41:38,843
I don't know what yet.

750
00:41:41,196 --> 00:41:44,348
But I just know one thing.

751
00:41:46,034 --> 00:41:48,119
I need your help to stop them.
