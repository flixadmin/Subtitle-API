Brother?

10
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,689
Did you send the ravens?

11
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:34,195
Tarly, look at me.

12
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,783
Did you send the ravens?

13
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:44,539
<i>That was your job.</i>

14
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,208
Your only job.

15
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:58,261
We need to get
back to the Wall.

16
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,180
<i>It's a long march.</i>

17
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,850
<i>We know what's out there,</i>

18
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:07,854
but we have to make it,
have to warn them

19
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,440
or before winter's done,

20
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,775
everyone you've ever known

21
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,444
will be dead.

( people talking

25
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,369
First time you've seen
a giant, Jon Snow?

26
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,917
Well, don't stare too long.
They're shy.

27
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:21,547
When they stop being shy,
they get angry.

28
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,841
And when they're angry,

29
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,969
I've seen them pound a man
straight into the ground

30
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,888
like a hammer on a nail.

31
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,897

Girl:
<i>Crow! Look over here!</i>
<i>Look!</i>

Woman:
<i>Ah, look, crow coming!</i>

36
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,161
Boy:
<i>Crow!</i>

37
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,499
Ygritte:
You're wearing
the wrong color.

38
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,085
Mance was a ranger.

39
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:04,382
In your hearts,
all you crows want
to fly free.

40
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,134
When I'm free,
will I be free to go?

41
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,468
- Crow!
- Crow!

42
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,678
Sure, you will.

43
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,848
- Oh!
- ( laughter )

44
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,892
And I'll be free
to kill you.

45
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,396
<i>Got no respect, this lot.</i>

46
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,440
Got no fathers to slap 'em
when they're foul.

47
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,901
What happened
to their fathers?

48
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,239
Some of them were killed
by crows like you.

49
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,785
Don't look so grim,
Jon Snow.

50
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,705
If Mance Rayder likes you,
you'll live another day.

51
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,791
And if he don't...

52
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,065
I smell a crow.

53
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,775
We killed his friends.

54
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,736
Thought you'd want
to question this one.

55
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,906
What do we want
with a baby crow?

56
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,909
This baby killed
Qhorin Halfhand.

57
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,162
<i>He wants to be</i>
<i>one of us.</i>

58
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,879
That half-handed cunt
killed friends of mine.

59
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,340
Friends twice your size.

60
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,762
My father told me
big men fall just as quick
as little ones

61
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:36,349
<i>if you put a sword</i>
<i>through their hearts.</i>

62
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,227
Plenty of little men

63
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,230
tried to put their swords
through my heart.

64
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,066
And there's plenty
of little skeletons

65
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,609
<i>buried in the woods.</i>

66
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,697
-<i> What's your name, boy?</i>
<i>- Jon Snow.</i>

67
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,081
Your Grace.

68
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,416
( laughter )

69
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,710
- Your Grace?
- ( laughter )

70
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,504
Did you hear that?

71
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,507
From now on, you'd better
kneel every time I fart.

72
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,010
( laughs )
Stand, boy.

73
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,182
We don't kneel for anyone
beyond the Wall.

74
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:25,982
So, you're
Ned Stark's bastard.

75
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,109
Thank you for the gift,
Lord of Bones.

76
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,861
You can leave us.

77
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,122
The girl likes you.

78
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,499
You like her back, Snow?

79
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:45,793
That why you want
to join us?

80
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,545
Bearded warrior:
<i>Don't panic, boy.</i>

81
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,839
This isn't the damned
Night's Watch

82
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,966
where we make you
swear off girls.

83
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:55,845
This chicken eater
you thought was king
is Tormund Giantsbane.

84
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,347
Can't believe this pup

85
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,599
<i>killed the Halfhand.</i>

86
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,018
He was our enemy

87
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,646
and I'm glad he's dead.

88
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:18,242
He was my brother once.

89
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,870
Back when he had
a whole hand.

90
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,457
What were you
doing with him?

91
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,877
The Lord Commander sent me
to the Halfhand for seasoning.

92
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,587
Why?

93
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,505
He wants me to lead
one day.

94
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,759
But here you are,
a traitor

95
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,595
kneeling before
the King-beyond-the-Wall.

96
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:41,057
If I'm a traitor,
then you are, too.

97
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,817
Why do you want
to join us, Jon Snow?

98
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,617
I want to be free.

99
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,787
No, I don't think so.

100
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,915
I think what you want
most of all

101
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,084
is to be a hero.

102
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:12,338
I'll ask you
one last time--

103
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,341
why do you want
to join us?

104
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:23,391
We stopped
at Craster's Keep
on the way north.

105
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,144
I saw...

106
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,771
You saw what?

107
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,275
I saw Craster take
his own baby boy

108
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,070
and leave it
in the woods.

109
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,322
I saw what took it.

110
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,871
You're telling me
you saw one of them?

111
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,293
And why would that make you
desert your brothers?

112
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,296
Because when I told
the Lord Commander,

113
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,465
he already knew.

114
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,803
Thousands of years ago,
the First Men

115
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:04,306
battled the White Walkers
and defeated them.

116
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,394
I want to fight for the side
that fights for the living.

117
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,399
Did I come
to the right place?

118
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,823
We'll need to find you
a new cloak.

119
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,583
( children chattering )

120
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,472
What if you took off
that bit there?

121
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:50,019
Don't you want to leave
something to the imagination?

122
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,981
Trouble is, I've never
had much imagination.

123
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,195
I want you to take it off.

124
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,033
( tsks )

125
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,495
Mouth.

126
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,958
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

127
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,212
Podrick:
Ser Bronn.
Ser Bronn.

128
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,924
I didn't hear that.

129
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,009
- Apologies, ser.
- Bronn:<i> Back away.</i>

130
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,887
Keep backing away
till you're outside
this establishment.

131
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,641
- Then back away some more.
- Lord Tyrion sent me.

132
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,560
I will murder you, boy.

133
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,188
He said it was a matter
of life and death.

134
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,955
<i>( knocking )</i>

135
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:54,208
- Pod?
- Cersei:<i> It's your sister.</i>

136
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,711
<i>The queen.</i>

137
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,809
<i>What are they doing here?</i>

138
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:15,062
Protecting me, I assume.
Will you let me in?

139
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,940
No, I don't think so.

140
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,525
If I wanted to kill you,
do you think

141
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:22,361
I'd let a wooden door
stop me?

142
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,743
They stay outside.

143
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,079
I'm not afraid of you,
little brother.

144
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,472
- Why are you here?
- I wanted to see your face.

145
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:54,101
They said you'd lost
your nose, but it's not
as gruesome as all that.

146
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,771
The man who cut me
lost more than his nose.

147
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,648
I should hope so.

148
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,110
The rebels came
for Joffrey's head,
they lost their own.

149
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,237
Thanks to Father.

150
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,740
Thanks to Father.

151
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,493
Of course, it wasn't a rebel
who tried to kill me.

152
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,204
No? Curious.

153
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:18,042
Bit of a comedown
from chamber of the Hand.

154
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,336
But then I don't suppose
you need much room.

155
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,213
Grand Maester Pycelle
made the same joke.

156
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,675
You must be proud to be
as funny as a man whose
balls brush his knees.

157
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,510
You're meeting
Father today?

158
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,763
How do you know that?

159
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,599
<i>Because I have hundreds</i>
<i>of spies in my employ.</i>

160
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:37,061
The Master of Whisperers
owes me a favor or two.

161
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,607
Father told me.
What do you want from him?

162
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,484
What do I want from him?
He's my father.

163
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,861
Do I need
to want something?

164
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,491
I'm sure
he loves me dearly,

165
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,242
as any father loves
his child,

166
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,037
his baby boy.

167
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,664
Yet he hasn't come
to visit once

168
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,207
<i>since arriving</i>
<i>in King's Landing.</i>

169
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,794
<i>I lay here,</i>
<i>my face split in half,</i>

170
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,380
but Father never came.

171
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,887
You're going
to make me cry.

172
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,181
Why do you care
what I want from him?

173
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,810
Because you've slandered me
to Father before.

174
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,062
Slandered?
When?

175
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,231
<i>You told him</i>
<i>I had my guards</i>

176
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,149
beat that servant girl
at Casterly Rock.

177
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,193
<i>You did have</i>
<i>your guards beat her.</i>

178
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,444
A girl of nine,
I believe.

179
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,238
<i>I was nine, too.</i>

180
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,156
She lost an eye,
if I remember correctly.

181
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,616
If I remember correctly,

182
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,952
she never stole
a necklace again.

183
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,665
It's not slander
if it's true.

184
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,251
And what's this truth
you plan on telling him today?

185
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,086
<i>Why are you so nervous</i>

186
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,255
<i>about what I'm going</i>
<i>to say to Father?</i>

187
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,507
Because you're a liar.

188
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,510
I expect you'll tell lies
about me, about Joffrey.

189
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,054
Any lies in particular?

190
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,183
You're a clever man,

191
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,644
but you're not half as clever
as you think you are.

192
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,731
Still makes me
more clever than you.

193
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,691
<i>( door opens )</i>

194
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:10,529
Oh, look at these two
shining warriors.

195
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:14,032
Ser Taryn Mant and...

196
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,784
Ser Whosit of Whocares.

197
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,244
Ser Meryn Trant.

198
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,705
Ser Bronn
of the Blackwater.

199
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,291
- You're no knight.
- Pod.

200
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,834
Ser Bronn
of the Blackwater

201
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,794
was anointed
by the king himself.

202
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,505
You're an up-jumped
cutthroat,

203
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,048
nothing more.

204
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,925
That's exactly who I am.

205
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,969
And you're a grub
in fancy armor

206
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:37,264
<i>who's better</i>
<i>at beating little girls</i>
<i>than fighting men.</i>

207
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,142
Now, I have an appointment
with Lord Tyrion.

208
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,978
You put your hand
on that door,

209
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:45,647
you lose the hand.

210
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:04,124
As much as I appreciate
a walk in the sunshine,
your lordship,

211
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,293
I am wondering
why you sent for me.

212
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,337
A number of people
in this city want to kill me.

213
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,671
You're here to protect me.

214
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,007
I've been doing that
for a while now.

215
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,759
Do you grow bored
protecting me?

216
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,177
I grow poor
protecting you.

217
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,262
Poor?
Poor?

218
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,223
Under my patronage
you've become a knight,

219
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,183
you've served as Commander
of the City Watch.

220
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,269
- Briefly.
- I'm sure you
filled your pockets.

221
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,188
And now my pockets
are empty.

222
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,524
You've given me a taste
for the finer things.

223
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,692
And if you want me
to carry on protecting you,

224
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,069
you'll need to pay more.

225
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,363
- I thought
we were friends.
- We are.

226
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,241
But I'm a sellsword.
I sell my sword.

227
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,034
I don't loan it out
to friends as a favor.

228
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:40,536
- How much?
- Double.

229
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,871
- Double?
- I'm a knight now.

230
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,373
Knights
are worth double.

231
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,708
I don't even know how much
I'm paying you now.

232
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,752
Which means
you can afford it.

233
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,175
- ( breathing heavily )
-<i> ( waves lapping )</i>

234
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,683
( seabirds calling )

235
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,376
Here. Here!

236
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,137
Help me!

237
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:53,650
<i>( horn blowing )</i>

238
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,077
Who are you?

239
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:10,751
I was in the battle
at Blackwater.

240
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:15,797
I was a captain
and a knight.

241
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,676
Aye, ser,
and serving which king?

242
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,101
The one true king
of Westeros--

243
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,731
Stannis Baratheon.

244
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,992
I thought you were dead.

245
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,787
Everyone thought
you were dead.

246
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,125
And your son?

247
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,425
He may have swam
ashore as you did.

248
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,637
No, the wildfire took him.
I saw it.

249
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,149
I'm so sorry,
my friend.

250
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,777
I, too, have lost a son.

251
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,279
There is nothing worse
in this world.

252
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:26,118
But, Davos, you were
a good father.

253
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:29,871
If I was a good father,
he'd still be here.

254
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,376
Stannis lives?

255
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,545
He licks his wounds
at Dragonstone.

256
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,422
Will you take me there?

257
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,632
There is nothing for me
at Dragonstone.

258
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,217
This war is not over.

259
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,468
Not for you, maybe.

260
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,388
But for Salladhor Saan,
the war is over.

261
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,390
We're both sworn
to King Stannis.

262
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,059
I am sworn to no man.

263
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,855
I promised you 30 ships
and you promised me
riches and glory.

264
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,189
I delivered the ships.

265
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,608
Stannis never gives up.
Never.

266
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,902
- Now he will regroup--
-<i> He's a broken man.</i>

267
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,488
His fleet lies at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay.

268
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,240
They say he sees no one--

269
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:07,409
not his generals,
not even his wife.

270
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,454
Only the Red Woman

271
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,913
whispering in his ear,

272
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,583
telling him what
she sees in the flames

273
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,376
and burning men alive.

274
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,669
What?

275
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:21,548
They built a great fire
when Stannis returned.

276
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,342
All those who spoke
against her she called

277
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,012
servants of darkness.

278
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,641
They say she sang
to them as they burned.

279
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,773
I'm a pirate.

280
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,941
<i>You're a smuggler.</i>

281
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,777
<i>Servants of darkness.</i>

282
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,072
I'm thinking
Dragonstone is a good
place for us to avoid.

283
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,365
Take me back there, please.

284
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,284
You cannot turn
Stannis against her.

285
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,995
Maybe not, but I could
carve her heart out.

286
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,455
You could try.

287
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,916
If you fail,
they will burn you.

288
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,794
If you succeed,
they'll burn you.

289
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,962
And you've only
just come back to life.

290
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,298
Stay alive a little
longer, my friend.

291
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:06,093
You call me friend.
You drank with me
on my wedding day.

292
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,512
And you drank with me
on four of my wedding days,

293
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,514
but I don't ask you
for favors.

294
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,307
I have to stop her.

295
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,435
Please, do this for me.

296
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,482
When you are dead,

297
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,984
I will gather your bones
in a little sack

298
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,071
and let your widow
wear them around her neck.

299
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:42,295
We should set the siege lines
1,000 yards from Harrenhal.

300
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,881
There won't be a siege.
The Mountain can't
defend a ruin.

301
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,383
I imagine the Mountain
will defend

302
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,343
whatever Tywin Lannister
tells him to defend.

303
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,804
The Lannisters have been
running from us since Oxcross.

304
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,515
I'd love a fight.
The men would love a fight.

305
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,476
I don't think
we're going to get one.

306
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,823
<i>( flies buzzing )</i>

307
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:48,695
200 Northmen
slaughtered like sheep.

308
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:51,865
The debt will be
repaid, my friend.

309
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,743
For them
and for your sons.

310
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,953
Will it?

311
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:59,164
They rot in the ground

312
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,458
<i>while their killer</i>
<i>runs free.</i>

313
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:04,294
The Kingslayer won't
remain free for long.

314
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:07,339
My best hunters
are after him.

315
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:29,861
- Robb:<i> A Mallister?</i>
<i>- Ser Jeremy.</i>

316
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,614
My father's bannerman.

317
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,637
Find her a chamber
that will serve as a cell.

318
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,442
Talisa:
<i>She's your mother.</i>

319
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,153
She freed
Jaime Lannister.

320
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,614
The Lannisters robbed
them of their sons

321
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,324
and she robbed them
of their justice.

322
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,410
( coughing )

323
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,828
<i>Water.</i>

324
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,415
Water.

325
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,709
This needs to be
cleaned and closed.

326
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,507
What's your name, friend?

327
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,259
Qyburn.

328
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,677
You're lucky to be alive.

329
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,516
Lucky?

330
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,185
<i>( birds cawing )</i>

331
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,375
( sighs )

332
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,377
The badge
looks good on you.

333
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,049
Almost as good
as it looked on me.

334
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:19,220
Are you enjoying
your new position?

335
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,223
Am I enjoying it?

336
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,809
I was very happy
as Hand of the King.

337
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,895
( chuckles )
Yes.

338
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,064
I heard how happy you were.

339
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,732
( blows )

340
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,401
You brought a whore
into my bed.

341
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,987
It wasn't your bed
at the time.

342
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,451
I sent you here
to advise the king.

343
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:45,330
I gave you real power
and authority.

344
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,916
You chose
to spend your days

345
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,876
as you always have,

346
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,420
bedding harlots

347
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,839
and drinking with thieves.

348
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,677
Occasionally I drank
with the harlots.

349
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,013
What do you want, Tyrion?

350
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,225
Why does everyone assume
I want something?

351
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:08,103
Can't I simply visit
with my beloved father?

352
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,689
My beloved father who

353
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,359
somehow forgot to visit
his wounded son

354
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,403
after he fell
on the battlefield.

355
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,989
Maester Pycelle assured me
your wounds were not fatal.

356
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,951
I organized
the defense of this city

357
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:26,204
while you held court
in the ruins of Harrenhal.

358
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,998
I led the foray
when the enemies
were at the gate

359
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,376
while your grandson,
the king,

360
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:34,003
quivered in fear
behind the walls.

361
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:37,715
I bled in the mud
for our family.

362
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,051
And as my reward,

363
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:43,388
I was trundled off
to some dark little cell.

364
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,390
But what do I want?

365
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,935
A little bloody gratitude
would be a start.

366
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:52,147
Jugglers and singers
require applause.

367
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,816
You are a Lannister.

368
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,652
<i>Do you think I demanded</i>
<i>a garland of roses</i>

369
00:28:57,735 --> 00:29:00,530
<i>every time I suffered</i>
<i>a wound on a battlefield?</i>

370
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,490
Hmm?

371
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:06,536
Now, I have seven kingdoms
to look after

372
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,830
and three of them
are in open rebellion.

373
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:13,751
So tell me what you want.

374
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:20,383
I want what is mine
by right.

375
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:25,346
Jaime is your eldest son,
heir to your lands and titles.

376
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:29,726
But he is a Kingsguard,
forbidden from marriage
or inheritance.

377
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,686
The day Jaime put on
the white cloak,

378
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:35,523
he gave up his claim
to Casterly Rock.

379
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,568
I am your son
and lawful heir.

380
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,239
You want Casterly Rock?

381
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,325
It is mine by right.

382
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,787
( sighs )

383
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,956
We'll find you
accommodations

384
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,791
more suited
to your name

385
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,377
<i>and as a reward</i>
<i>for your accomplishments</i>

386
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,963
during the battle
of Blackwater Bay.

387
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,926
And when the time is right,
you will be given a position

388
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,469
<i>fit for your talents</i>

389
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,263
so that you can
serve your family

390
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,390
and protect our legacy.

391
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,059
<i>And if you serve</i>
<i>faithfully,</i>

392
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,520
<i>you will be rewarded</i>
<i>with a suitable wife.</i>

393
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:17,315
And I would let myself
be consumed by maggots

394
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,858
<i>before mocking</i>
<i>the family name</i>

395
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,819
<i>and making you</i>
<i>heir to Casterly Rock.</i>

396
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,199
- Why?
- Why?

397
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,243
You ask that?

398
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,538
You, who killed your mother
to come into the world?

399
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:35,833
You are an ill-made,
spiteful little creature

400
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:39,754
full of envy, lust,
and low cunning.

401
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:42,423
<i>Men's laws give you</i>
<i>the right to bear my name</i>

402
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:47,136
and display my colors
since I cannot prove
that you are not mine.

403
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:50,974
<i>And to teach me humility,</i>
<i>the gods have condemned me</i>

404
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:54,686
to watch you waddle about
wearing that proud lion

405
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:58,523
that was my father's sigil
and his father's before him.

406
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,275
But neither gods nor men

407
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,444
will ever compel me
to let you turn Casterly Rock

408
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,447
<i>into your whorehouse.</i>

409
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,200
Go, now.

410
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:16,124
Speak no more of your rights
to Casterly Rock.

411
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,545
Go.

412
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,681
Oh, one more thing.

413
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:37,103
The next whore I catch
in your bed I'll hang.

414
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,739
Sansa:<i> Dorne.</i>
<i>It's going to Dorne.</i>

415
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,658
- Shae:<i> Why Dorne?</i>
<i>- It's carrying silk</i>

416
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:54,329
and it's supposed to bring
back wine in exchange.

417
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,627
But it's not
coming back.

418
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,296
The captain's tired
of risking his life

419
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,506
so King's Landing
lords and ladies

420
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,635
can get drunk
on better wine
than they deserve.

421
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:12,055
He's going
to stay in Dorne.

422
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:15,475
Wait out the winter
where it's beautiful
and warm.

423
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:19,187
I met some people
in Dorne who weren't
so beautiful and warm.

424
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,356
Don't ruin the game.

425
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,025
I told you,
I don't want to play.

426
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,111
What about that one there?

427
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,696
That one?

428
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,865
It's going to Volantis.

429
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:32,200
Why?

430
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,035
Because when I got
on a ship in Volantis,

431
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,371
it looked like that one.

432
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,289
That's not how
the game works.

433
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,918
You're not supposed to just
blurt out the right answer.

434
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,419
You've got
to invent a story

435
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:46,964
about where the ship
is going and why.

436
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:50,051
Why should I make up a story
when I know the truth?

437
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,011
Because the truth

438
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,555
is always either
terrible or boring.

439
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,308
Lovely day for it.

440
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,352
Watching the ships.

441
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:02,397
Lord Baelish.

442
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,400
Might I speak
with Lady Sansa

443
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,984
alone for a moment?

444
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,541
I saw your mother
not long ago.

445
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,169
She's very eager
to see you.

446
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:30,133
And your sister.

447
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,551
Arya's alive?

448
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,890
You said
you'd take me home.

449
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:41,352
You said King's Landing
was your home.

450
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,980
You are the property
of the crown.

451
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,440
Stealing you
would be treason.

452
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,066
If you were to tell
just one person--

453
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,694
- I won't tell anyone.
- How do I know?

454
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,654
Because I'm a terrible liar.

455
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,282
You said so yourself.

456
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,660
Please, Lord Baelish.
Tell me what to do.
Tell me when.

457
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,415
I'm waiting for word
on an assignment

458
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:05,668
that will take me far away
from the capital.

459
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,420
When I set sail,

460
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:10,006
I might be able
to take you with me.

461
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,925
But you'll need
to be ready to leave
on a moment's notice.

462
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,805
You're her handmaiden?

463
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,435
Yes.
And you're his...?

464
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:25,980
I help manage
his affairs.

465
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:29,150
- He's an important person.
- So is she.

466
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,028
I grew up in the shadow
of her father's castle.

467
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:34,155
The day she was born,
they rang the bells

468
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,616
from sunrise till sunset.

469
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,621
We've both done
rather well, you and I.

470
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:45,875
Yes.

471
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:49,253
Given where we started.

472
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,464
And where is that?

473
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,009
It's not easy
for girls like us

474
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:57,136
to dig our way out.

475
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,477
Ros:
<i>Watch out for her.</i>

476
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,563
I always do.

477
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,941
Watch out for her
with him.

478
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,582
<i>( dragon screeching )</i>

479
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,548
( screeches )

480
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,553
( screeches )

481
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,518
( screeching )

482
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:04,412
They're growing fast.

483
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,083
Not fast enough.

484
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:12,628
I can't wait that long.

485
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,425
I need an army.

486
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,676
<i>( dragon screeching )</i>

487
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,720
We'll be in Astapor
by nightfall.

488
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,266
Some say the Unsullied
are the greatest soldiers
in the world.

489
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:28,060
The greatest slave-soldiers
in the world.

490
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,521
The distinction means
a good deal to some people.

491
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,315
Do those people
have any better ideas

492
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:35,484
about how to put you
on the Iron Throne?

493
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,030
It's too beautiful
a day to argue.

494
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,324
<i>( man vomiting )</i>

495
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,577
You're right.

496
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,624
Another lovely day
on the high seas.

497
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,459
Daenerys:
<i>Don't mock them.</i>

498
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,878
They're the first Dothraki
who have ever been on a ship.

499
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,297
They followed me
across the poison water.

500
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,840
If they'll do it,
others will.

501
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,300
And with a true
khalasar--

502
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:03,387
The Dothraki follow strength
above all, khaleesi.

503
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:07,099
You'll have a true
khalasar when you prove
yourself strong.

504
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,518
And not before.

505
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:16,275
<i>( seabirds calling )</i>

506
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,214
Your Grace.

507
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,852
I heard you were dead.

508
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,562
Not yet.

509
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:58,567
I had hoped to speak
to you alone, Your Grace.

510
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,737
We are alone.

511
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:15,042
Your Grace, you are
the rightful king.

512
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,837
<i>Not only by blood.</i>

513
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,881
You're an honorable man,
a just man.

514
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,134
And there is still
a war to fight.

515
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,970
I am fighting.

516
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,514
By burning
prisoners alive?

517
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,601
How would you punish
the infidels, Ser Davos?

518
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,187
I do not judge people
for the gods they worship.

519
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,356
If I did, I'd have
thrown you in the sea

520
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,109
before you ever set foot
on Dragonstone.

521
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,737
- I'm not your enemy.
- You are my enemy.

522
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,076
Was it me you fought
on Blackwater Bay?

523
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:52,913
<i>Did I set</i>
<i>your ships ablaze?</i>

524
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,713
I wasn't there
when the wildfire killed
our men by the thousands.

525
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,176
I could have
saved those men.

526
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,761
You would have
taken the city,

527
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,888
Stannis would now sit
upon his rightful throne,

528
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,556
and you would
stand beside him.

529
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:13,142
<i>But I wasn't there</i>

530
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:16,771
because you convinced
your king to leave me behind.

531
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,907
Do you hear them screaming?

532
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,327
All those burning men
in the water

533
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,704
crying for their mothers,

534
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,957
for their gods for help?

535
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,710
Until the moment
the Blackwater swallowed them.

536
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,508
( gasps )

537
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,095
Don't despair, Ser Davos.

538
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,472
What I told
your son is true.

539
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,933
Death by fire

540
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,643
is the purest death.

541
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,394
( growls )

542
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,772
This woman is evil!

543
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,357
She's the mother of demons.

544
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,276
Take him to the dungeon
and lock him in a cell.

545
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,569
- Your Grace!
- Come on.

546
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,154
You've chosen
the darkness, Ser Davos.

547
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,116
- She will destroy us all!
- I will pray for you.

548
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,201
Davos:
<i>Your Grace!</i>

549
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,536
<i>( door closes )</i>

550
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,664
( guards shouting )

551
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:42,148
Guard:
<i>Halt. Down.</i>

552
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:46,235
Guard #2:
<i>Halt. Down.</i>

553
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,617
Why have we stopped?

554
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,161
It's Lady Margaery,
Your Grace.

555
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,710
Joffrey:
<i>What is she doing?</i>
<i>Who gave her permission?</i>

556
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:06,422
Maid: My lady.
We should have
guards, my lady.

557
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,757
Why?

558
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,596
Pardon me.

559
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:24,064
Stop, my lady.
You'll ruin your dress.

560
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,858
I have others.

561
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,074
Would you like
to speak with her,
Your Grace?

562
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,996
No.

563
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,165
He was a soldier.

564
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,042
He went to fight
on the walls

565
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,628
when the ships came
into Blackwater Bay.

566
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,796
He never came back.

567
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,506
And your mother?

568
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,009
She died
when she had me.

569
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:56,764
Bad men wanted
to come into this city

570
00:41:56,847 --> 00:42:00,684
and do terrible things,
but your father stopped them.

571
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,525
Whenever you look
at this knight,

572
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,612
I want you to remember
your father.

573
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,033
He wasn't a knight.

574
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,952
He was just a soldier.

575
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,412
And what do knights
swear to do?

576
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:23,624
Protect the weak
and uphold the good.

577
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:27,586
Your father did that.
Be proud of him.

578
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:33,467
Was your father
a soldier, too?

579
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:37,388
You should be proud, too.

580
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,392
Under King Joffrey's
leadership,

581
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:44,270
your fathers
saved the city.

582
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,730
They saved us all.

583
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,942
From now on, we're going
to take care of you.

584
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,530
All of you.

585
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:58,158
( children laughing )

586
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,414
Come to me for whatever
you need to feed them,

587
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,499
clothe them,
or house them.

588
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,378
Directly to me.

589
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,932
<i>( doors open )</i>

590
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,186
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

591
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,730
Please, sit.
Sit.

592
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:30,149
I do apologize,
my lady.

593
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:32,526
Small council meetings.

594
00:43:32,609 --> 00:43:34,778
At what point
does it become treason

595
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,697
to waste the king's time?

596
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,991
( laughs )

597
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,162
That's a lovely gown,
my lady.

598
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,164
Yes, it suits you
perfectly.

599
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:47,541
I imagine you might
be rather cold.

600
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:51,045
The climate is a bit
more forgiving back in
Highgarden, Your Grace.

601
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:54,590
Shall I have them bring
you a shawl, my lady?

602
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:57,176
I am touched by your
concern, Your Grace.

603
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:00,304
Luckily for us Tyrells,
our blood runs quite warm.

604
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,598
-<i> Doesn't it, Loras?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

605
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,517
Loras, isn't the queen's
gown magnificent?

606
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,479
The fabric,
the embroidery,
the metalwork.

607
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,230
I've never seen
anything like it.

608
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,191
You might find a bit
of armor quite useful

609
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:14,818
once you become queen.
Perhaps before.

610
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:18,530
<i>Joffrey tells me you</i>
<i>stopped your carriage</i>
<i>at Flea Bottom</i>

611
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,532
on your way back from
the sept this morning.

612
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:24,370
Yes. I paid a visit
to an orphanage

613
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,372
the High Septon
told me about.

614
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:29,166
Margaery does a great
deal of work with the poor
back in Highgarden.

615
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:33,545
The lowest among us are no
different from the highest
if you give them a chance

616
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,589
and approach them
with an open heart.

617
00:44:35,672 --> 00:44:37,883
Cersei:
<i>An open heart is what</i>
<i>you'll get in Flea Bottom</i>

618
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,551
<i>if you're not careful,</i>
<i>my dear.</i>

619
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:43,389
Not long ago, we were
attacked by a mob there.

620
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:46,141
We had a full complement
of guards that didn't stop them.

621
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:49,311
The king barely escaped
with his life.

622
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:52,773
My mother's always had
a penchant for drama.

623
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,484
Facts become less and less
important to her

624
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,569
<i>as she grows older.</i>

625
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,489
Our lives were never
truly in danger.

626
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,283
You're right, of course.

627
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,620
But you are
your father's son.

628
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:08,872
We can't all have
a king's bravery.

629
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:19,216
Hunger turns men
into beasts.

630
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:23,095
I'm glad House Tyrell
has been able to help
in this regard.

631
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:26,974
They tell me
100 wagons arrive
daily now from the Reach.

632
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:30,394
<i>Wheat, barley, apples.</i>
<i>We've had a blessed harvest.</i>

633
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:33,063
And, of course,
it's our duty to
assist the capital

634
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,232
in time of need.

635
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,067
Well, as Ser Loras said,

636
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,362
Lady Margaery has done
this sort of...

637
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,990
charitable work before.

638
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,451
I'm sure she knows
what she's doing.

639
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,704
I'm sure she does.

640
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,764
( speaking Valyrian )

641
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,902
The Unsullied have stood here
for a day and a night

642
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:22,154
with no food or water.

643
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:25,115
( speaking Valyrian )

644
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:30,204
They will stand
until they drop.

645
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,414
( speaking Valyrian )

646
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,541
Such is their
obedience.

647
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,504
They may suit my needs.

648
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,547
Tell me of their training.

649
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,467
( speaking Valyrian )

650
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,645
( speaking Valyrian )

651
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:03,362
They begin their
training at five.

652
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,572
Every day they drill
from dawn to dusk

653
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,741
until they have mastered
the shortsword,

654
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:10,035
the shield,
and the three spears.

655
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:13,789
Only one boy in four survives
this rigorous training.

656
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,832
( speaking Valyrian )

657
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:19,878
Missandei:
<i>Their discipline</i>
<i>and loyalty are absolute.</i>

658
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,547
<i>They fear nothing.</i>

659
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,716
Even the bravest men
fear death.

660
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,761
( speaking Valyrian )

661
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:45,696
( continues in Valyrian )

662
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:48,782
Missandei:
<i>My master says</i>
<i>the Unsullied are not men.</i>

663
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:51,076
Death means nothing
to them.

664
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:54,454
( speaking Valyrian )

665
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:02,671
He begs you attend to this
carefully, Your Grace.

666
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,676
( speaking Valyrian )

667
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,479
Tell the good master
there is no need.

668
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,982
( speaking Valyrian )

669
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:30,115
Missandei:
<i>My master points out</i>
<i>that men don't need nipples.</i>

670
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,038
( speaking Valyrian )

671
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:38,415
( speaking Valyrian )

672
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:45,964
( speaking Valyrian )

673
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,008
To win his shield,

674
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:51,887
an Unsullied must go
to the slave marts
with a silver mark,

675
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:56,850
find a newborn and kill it
before its mother's eyes.

676
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:01,605
<i>This way, my master says,</i>
<i>we make certain</i>

677
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:03,607
<i>there is no weakness</i>
<i>left in them.</i>

678
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:07,861
You take a babe
from its mother's arms,

679
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:12,240
kill it as she watches,
and pay for her pain
with a silver coin?

680
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:14,534
( speaking Valyrian )

681
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,213
( continues in Valyrian )

682
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,840
My master would
like you to know
that the silver is paid

683
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:31,385
to the baby's owner,
not the mother.

684
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,393
How many do you
have to sell?

685
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,562
<i>( Missandei speaking</i>
<i>Valyrian )</i>

686
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,191
8,000.

687
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,157
Master Kraznys asks
that you please hurry.

688
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,993
Many other buyers
are interested.

689
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:10,048
8,000 dead babies.

690
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:12,926
The Unsullied
are a means to an end.

691
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:15,220
Once I own them,
these men--

692
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:17,764
They're not men.
Not anymore.

693
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:21,268
Once I own
an army of slaves,
what will I be?

694
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,353
Do you think these slaves
will have better lives

695
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:26,773
serving Kraznys
and men like him
or serving you?

696
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,038
You'll be fair to them.

697
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,791
You won't mutilate them
to make a point.

698
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,715
You won't order them
to murder babies.

699
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:54,593
You'll see they're properly
fed and sheltered.

700
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:57,304
A great injustice
has been done to them.

701
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,016
Closing your eyes
will not undo it.

702
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,905
( grunts )

703
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,202
( chittering )

704
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,094
( hisses )

705
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:59,783
The warlocks.

706
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:06,164
I owe you my life, ser.

707
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,874
The honor is mine,

708
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,168
my queen.

709
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,799
You know this man?

710
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,717
I know him

711
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:22,222
as one of the greatest
fighters the Seven Kingdoms
has ever seen

712
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,640
and as the Lord Commander

713
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:26,643
of Robert Baratheon's
Kingsguard.

714
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:29,938
King Robert is dead.

715
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:32,941
I have been searching
for you, Daenerys Stormborn,

716
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:35,610
to ask your forgiveness.

717
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:38,655
I was sworn to protect
your family.

718
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,242
I failed them.

719
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:49,916
I am Barristan Selmy,

720
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,252
Kingsguard to your father.

721
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,588
<i>Allow me to join</i>
<i>your Queensguard</i>

722
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,924
and I will not
fail you again.

723
00:53:11,897 --> 00:54:30,350
