Right now, we have to get
the knife before Ra's does.

We're gonna need guns,
smoke grenades to cause a diversion.

324

If I may, there may be another option.

325
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,415
But you got to guarantee
not to stab us in the back.

Again.

327
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,633
So, in short, we'd like to thank you
very much.

Both of us would like to
thank you for taking such good...

Such good care of her.

330

But now we'd like to
take the knife home. Please.

It was never yours
to begin with, Mr. Pennyworth.

That's why you returned it to us.

Yeah. But it was a loan,
wasn't it, mate?

343

Now, are you in or are you out?

480
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,163
If it's suicide by Ra's, I'm out.

481
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,491
Fine, then go.

482
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:55,385
What if she's right?

483
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,717
I can't control The Demon's Head.

484
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,599
Maybe it's like Ra's said. Maybe...

485
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,431
I am just a nightclub owner.

486
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,642
I should have never
trusted those men.

487
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,772
I didn't want you to have
The Demon's Head.

488
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,065
Not even sure I want it now.

489
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,900
Three years we've been together,
on and off.

490
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,616
And I've never seen you
doubt yourself.

491
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,790
So, however you
wanna play this, I'm in.

492
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,042
But if you're saying
you're not worthy,

493
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,790
that's where I jump ship.

494
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,379
Let's do this.

495
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,404
I suppose on the bright side,
you won't have to kill him.

496
00:26:58,575 --> 00:26:59,691
Again.

497
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:03,077
- Except, I'm the only one who can.
- Well, so said Ra's.

498
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,240
I mean, no disrespect to your
magical daggers and all of that,

499
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,324
but I'd love to see what would happen

500
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,829
if I pulled his head off
his bloody shoulders.

501
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,496
I can't believe
Selina gave Barbara the knife.

502
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:14,956
(SCOFFS)

503
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,551
Yeah, well, at least
we know where she stands.

504
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:19,961
That's what you think.

505
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,513
Oh, you got a bloody cheek
turning up here.

506
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,144
I gave Barbara the knife
because if there was a chance

507
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,566
she could use it, I wanted her to.

508
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,768
That way,
Bruce didn't have to kill him.

509
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,187
I would've done what I had to do.

510
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:38,612
And you would've gone straight back

511
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,486
to being the douchebag
you've been the last few months.

512
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,408
So, no, thank you.

513
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,076
She's got a point there,
Master Bruce.

514
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,155
Thanks for the explanation.
You can leave now.

515
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,364
- Bruce...
- You sided with them.

516
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,994
(SIGHS) Why does it have
to be about sides?

517
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,079
There is somebody,

518
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,256
something out there
that needs to be stopped.

519
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,503
So why can't we focus on that?

520
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:00,964
Another good point.

521
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,880
Barbara and Tabitha
are gonna get themselves killed.

522
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,716
And I don't want that to happen.

523
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,558
GORDON: There were easier banks to hit.

524
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,691
- Why yours?
- I keep telling you.

525
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:21,489
I have no idea.

526
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,741
I'm the victim.
You're treating me like a criminal.

527
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,660
Yeah, I wonder
where we'd get that from.

- We did some digging,

and your bank has been
investigated for redlining,

usury, illegal foreclosures.

531
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:36,671
And cleared on all counts.

532
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:38,623
You have good lawyers.

533
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,795

give us a second, please?

Look, brother,
I know what this is about.

541
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,901
You went down to The Narrows
and came back all fired up, okay?

But alienating her
is not gonna help us.

we got to stop it before it goes bad.

Which of your branches
are the most vulnerable?

546
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,084
As of this afternoon, none of them.

547
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,170

- You indulge me.

555
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,986
Breaking open the vault
is the last detail.

556
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,949
Big detail. How did you solve it?

557
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,580
A little help from some friends.

what I want.

But I want you to admit
we had a connection.

And that those things you said to me

were just mind games
