was in the NCCU.

163
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:43,751
This is cold fusion radiation,

164
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:46,318
but these readings are
10-to-the-negative 28 watts.

165
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:49,104
- That's Hawking radiation.

166
00:06:49,147 --> 00:06:50,279
You can only pick up
rads like that

167
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:52,542
from inside a Singularity.

168
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:55,023
- Ronnie died
in a Singularity...

169
00:06:57,765 --> 00:06:59,723
- On our wedding day.

170
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:02,987
The only way to close it

171
00:07:03,031 --> 00:07:04,902
was to merge the inner
and outer horizons.

172
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:06,774
- Right.
Ronnie and Professor Stein

173
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:09,124
came together, made Firestorm,

174
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:11,126
then separated in that thing.

175
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:16,827
- Ronnie!

176
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:18,133
Professor!

177
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:21,353
No!

178
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:26,750
Only Ronnie didn't make it.
- Right.

179
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:29,013
But matter cannot be
created or destroyed,

180
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:30,145
only changed,

181
00:07:30,188 --> 00:07:32,626
so maybe Ronnie's still alive.

182
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:35,933
I mean, maybe the pressure
from when the horizons merged

183
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:37,457
broke down
his biological matter

184
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,415
into pure thermodynamic energy.

185
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,504
- That could account
for the radiation,

186
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:42,853
but it still doesn't explain

187
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:44,159
why the fire's
been killing people,

188
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:45,769
why it tortured Chester.

189
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:47,510
- And if Ronnie knew
what he was doing,

190
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:49,033
he would hate it,

191
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:52,036
which is why I don't think
he's in control.

192
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,518
When Ronnie died, his brain
was flooded with ACTH.

193
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:57,433
It's the hormone
the human brain creates

194
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,087
when it experiences grief.

195
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,394
So maybe when he was reborn
as a sentient fire,

196
00:08:02,438 --> 00:08:04,048
that same process gave him

197
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:06,224
an overwhelming attraction
to the same hormone.

198
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:09,184
- So he's been eating
people's grief

199
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:11,926
because of some primal urge?

200
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:13,797
- I think he needs it
to survive,

201
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:15,407
which is why he's been trying
to reconnect with me

202
00:08:15,451 --> 00:08:16,496
so I can help him.

203
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:18,106
- Did he say anything else?

204
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:20,848
- A few words.
"Joining, togetherness."

205
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:24,504
I think he was trying to get me
to remember something.

206
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:26,375
- The Quantum splicer?

207
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:29,944
- It's what made him Firestorm
in the first place.

208
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:33,034
I think if we can use it
to make Ronnie human again,

209
00:08:33,077 --> 00:08:34,992
his mind will regain control.

210
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:38,169
- And the killings will stop.

211
00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:41,216
- Even if you are right
about this,

212
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,435
the splicer needs two people
to work,

213
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,481
and we can't ask anybody
to volunteer.

214
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,222
It's too dangerous.
- Yeah.

215
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:49,093
But we wouldn't need
another person

216
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:51,356
if we use one of
Eva McCulloch's R-CEM chips,

217
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,621
'cause if we fuse one of Eva's
chips to the splicer,

218
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:56,971
it'll do all the heavy lifting
by duplicating Ronnie cells

219
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:58,842
and coalescing another body
for him, right?

220
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:00,148
- Like it did
with Katie and me.

221
00:09:00,191 --> 00:09:02,542
- Okay, but raising the dead,

222
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:04,544
that's intense, even for us.

223
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:06,502
- Turned out okay
for Lazarus, right?

224
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,939
- And if Chester and Caitlin
both think it might work...

225
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:10,680
