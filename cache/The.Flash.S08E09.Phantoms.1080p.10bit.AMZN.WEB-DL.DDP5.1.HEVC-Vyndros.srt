forgetting things.

12

13
00:00:39,256 --> 00:00:42,303
Dad? Weren't you just upstairs?

14
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:47,090
Yeah, and then I went to the
garage because you asked me

15
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:50,572
to get the files from
the old Scarpulla case.

19
00:00:56,621 --> 00:00:59,146

for a couple of minutes,

weird, and so the Still Force
took a look at me

321
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:16,671
and discovered that I had
contracted a time sickness.

322
00:16:16,714 --> 00:16:20,980
Now, what that means and how
I got it is still a mystery,

323
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,025
but I don't know.

324
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:27,725
Recently, I feel like
I'm starting to lose time.

325
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:32,861
Okay, okay.
I see why you're freaking.

326
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:35,995
Yeah, and then this morning,
I checked in with Deon,

327
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:38,736
and he found something
that he had never seen before.

328
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,044
And even though he told me to
relax while he looks into it,

329
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:44,003
I mean, I can't help
but feeling that

330
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,743
something is really wrong.

331
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:49,095
And that's why you
threw yourself into this story?

332
00:16:49,138 --> 00:16:50,792
Yeah, I needed a distraction.

333
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:52,576
Believe me, I understand.

334
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,666
I did the same thing when
I found out that my parents

335
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:59,192
volunteered to work
for Black Hole.

336
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:03,587
At first, I was so mad
I just looked the other way.

337
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:06,155
I mean, seriously,
I did everything to avoid

338
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,724
facing the consequences
of their actions.

339
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:14,816
But I had to stop running away
and face my parents.

340
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:17,993
And Iris, you have to do
the same thing

341
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,083
about this fear around
this time sickness thing.

342
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:24,260
Yeah, but I mean,

343
00:17:24,304 --> 00:17:26,741
what if Deon shows up tomorrow
with bad news?

344
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:31,659
Yeah, that could happen.
You could also be fine.

345
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:33,443
Either way,
you have to stop running

346
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:34,923
from the fear of the unknown.

347
00:17:34,966 --> 00:17:38,057
It's--it's a race
you can't win.

348
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:41,669
What?
- Tinya.

349
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,544
What if I'm not
the only one running?

350
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:51,722
I think I know
where to find her.

351
00:18:06,346 --> 00:18:08,957
Got enough for a second cup?

352
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,612
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

353
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:16,182
I'm not gonna lie,
you look more stressed now

354
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:19,489
than you did during the
"Trials of Gyntarri" campaign.

355
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:21,578
Yeah.

356
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:23,754
That was a tough one.

357
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:25,278
Wow.

358
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:27,323
Even D&D talk
isn't gonna perk you up?

359
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:29,369
I'm sorry.

360
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:31,284
I'm a little out of it.

361
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:36,027
I know this new fire meta
case is pretty intense,

362
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:39,030

science guru,

you're in it pretty deep.

364
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:43,644
I mean, you have to
examine victims

365
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:46,299
and run tests on bodies.
That's a lot of pressure.

366
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:52,261
I guess what I'm saying is,
you're not alone.

Joe, did you find anything?

I did some digging,
and I called in a few favors.

672
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:40,546
Turns out our first victim,
Stan Mullen,

673
00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:43,026
recently lost all
his belongings to foreclosure.

I've been at lately.

Yeah, that's not terrifying.

But the fire created that.

687
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:20,150
And when I spoke to it,
it heard me

688
00:37:20,194 --> 00:37:22,152
like it could understand
or something.

689

Chester's right.

With all of that sorrow
that I felt coming out

of that thing,
I also felt other emotions:

determination, passion, desire.
