00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:10,260
Have a good one.

00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,440
Donna?

[groans in pain]

8
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:34,837
If you're trying to scare me,
it won't work.

9
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:38,039
I told you I ain't paying you
a damn cent more.

10
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:42,502
[jukebox clicking]

11
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,382
[rock music playing on jukebox]

12
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,513
Come on, man. That's enough.

[screaming]

17
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,674
[sighs] Ooh!

18
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,302
- Fresh java. Thank you, baby.
- Yeah.

19
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:35,388
Hey, I was thinking that we could get
an early dinner reservation tonight.

20
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:37,931
Sure.

21
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:45,607
Actually, um,

22
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:50,069
you know what? Why don't we stay in,
have a quiet night, just the two of us?

23
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:51,778
That feels better...

24
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:53,156
Thank you. I'm okay.

25
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:56,117
You know, I got to get
used to it eventually.

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,200
It's just another day.

27
00:01:57,327 --> 00:01:58,703
I can clear my schedule.

28
00:01:58,786 --> 00:01:59,787
I'm fine, really.

29
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:02,540
Besides, things are...
things are busy at CCC.

30
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,624
You need to be there.

31
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:06,461
And I need to get to work.

32
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:08,588
I'm just a phone call away.

33
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,048
I know.

34
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:16,094
[exhales]

35
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:22,809
Is it that bad?

36
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:27,440
[clears throat] Sorry. The fire
just kinda weirds me out, is all.

37
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:31,444
[clears throat]
The vic's name is Stanley Mullen.

38
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:35,907
Uh... He's the manager
of this local watering hole.

39
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:37,741
[Barry] That's weird.

40
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:41,579
The body's burnt through, but the ground
underneath isn't even charred.

41
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:44,123
Yeah, this was definitely a meta attack.

42
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,709
Dark matter levels are off the charts.

43
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:50,713
Whoever the meta is, they produce fire
that ignores the laws of physics.

44
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,548
Oh, man. Now this is giving me,

45
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:57,428
like, Goodbye-Armageddon-But-Hello-
<i>Dante's-Inferno</i> type of vibe.

46
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:00,264
- Morning, Allen, Runk.
- [Barry] Morning.

47
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:03,142
Find anything that can help us
piece this together?

48
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:07,730
Uh, no, not yet.
Were there any witnesses?

49
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,525
The bartender, Donna Winters,
didn't see the crime,

50
00:03:10,942 --> 00:03:14,153
but, she said our victim got into
a pretty nasty argument last night

51
00:03:14,237 --> 00:03:16,280
with a recently paroled ex-convict.

52
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:17,865
Apparently, the guy had a bad temper.

53
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:23,913
Oh, and he was wearing a Lips concert
t-shirt. You know, as in the rock band.

54
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,893
I was gonna ask her
some follow up questions.

55
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:30,628
Would it be okay if I,
um, showed her a picture

56
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:32,152
of someone who could be our suspect?

57
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:33,548
Sure.

58
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:42,390
Donna, this is CSI Barry Allen
and C.C.P.D. Consultant, Chester Runk.

59
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,769
Miss Winters, the person you saw arguing
with the victim, was this him?

60
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:51,023
That's him. That's the guy.

61
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:54,652
Jaco Birch. I'll put out an APB.

62
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:56,653
This way, ma'am.

63
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:00,324
The Hotness did this?

64
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:04,328
I thought it was all about the moolah,
not cold-blooded murder.

65
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:07,790
Plus, how do you kill someone
without burning half the place down?

66
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:10,984
Looks like we're not
the only ones who leveled up this year.

67
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:20,803
Here you go, boss lady.
This is every suggestion

68
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:24,599
the Bullpen brainstormed for who should
be our first CC Citizen of the Week.

69
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:25,682
Nice work.

70
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:29,270
Only, this is every suggestion...

71
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:31,773
except the winning one.

72
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:34,901
- Rosie Levin?
- Hmm?

73
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:39,864
Uh... Boss, I don't think launching
our first profile section

74
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:43,743
on some shallow social media influencer
is the way to go.

75
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:46,788
I just thought we were supposed to be
the voice of the people.

76
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:48,414
I hear you.

77
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:51,459
But Rosie Levin is who
the people are interested in.

78
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:53,795
Five hundred thousand of them,
to be exact.

79
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:55,797
And if we can bring those eyeballs
to CCC,

80
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,591
then, hopefully, people will read
the stories that matter.

81
00:05:03,596 --> 00:05:05,431
Is there something
that you want to tell me?

82
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:08,184
Yeah. Okay, fine.

83
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:12,188
Taylor brought this to me earlier,
and I told her it wasn't right for us.

84
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,482
And she went behind my back.

85
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:19,028
She believed in the story,
and she followed protocol

86
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,322
and made an appeal
to the editor-in-chief.

87
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:22,405
And I approved it.

88
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:24,074
Is that a problem?

89
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:26,327
Yes. I mean, no.

90
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:30,665
I just mean if the Bullpen
knows they can come to you

91
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:33,668
when I say no, my word means nothing.

92
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,462
Look, you're still their boss.

93
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:38,798
But I'm also yours.

94
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:42,552
And that means that sometimes
we are going to disagree on the stories

95
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:44,470
that we tell.
It's a part of the process.

96
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:47,723
Yeah, you're right. Of course, I...

97
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:52,353
Actually, you know what?
Why don't you both interview Rosie?

98
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:55,356
You want Taylor and me to work together?

99
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:58,025
You are my Supervising Editor.
Go supervise.

100
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:01,362
Plus, opposing perspectives
make for better stories.

101
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,282
And keep an open mind. I mean, you might

102
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:06,450
be surprised at what the two of you
can do together.

103
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:10,037
Yeah. You got it.

104
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,010
Whoa, whoa.
Easy with the guitars, roadies.

105
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:27,263
You're unloading the gilded weapons
of true rock gods. Come on.

106
00:06:28,264 --> 00:06:29,974
Trust your old man, Harold.

107
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:32,643
Watching the Lips concert
is gonna blow your freaking mind.

108
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:33,728
Yeah. Whatever, dude.

109
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:35,354
Hey, I'm sorry I couldn't land

110
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:37,398
the backstage passes
I promised. All right?

111
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:40,026
I kind of ran into
a little bit of a cash flow issue.

112
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,641
You bribe me here with stuff
you couldn't even get, Jaco.

113
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:44,614
Even more lame than usual.

114
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:48,534
I know, right? [chuckles nervously]

115
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:53,581
But, uh, hey, look, maybe after
the show, we could grab some food. Huh?

116
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,958
I could tell you some stories
about these crazy things

117
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:57,585
these bands I'm working with get into.

118
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:01,714
You aren't with the bands, Jaco. You're
arena security. Anyone can do that.

119
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:04,508
I'm gonna go for a walk.

120
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:09,847
Look... Look, Harold...

121
00:07:09,931 --> 00:07:11,057
[siren wailing]

122
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:12,891
Whoa.

123
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,317
Jaco Birch, you're under arrest
for the murder of Stanley Mullen.

124
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:23,319
I think you got the wrong guy.

125
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:24,570
What's going on?

126
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:26,155
Take him somewhere safe.

127
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:27,447
Hey...

128
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:28,865
Let go of me, jerk.

129
00:07:28,908 --> 00:07:30,576
Hey, hey, hey.
Get your hands off my son!

130
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,745
Calm down and put your hands
behind your back.

131
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:35,706
Nobody's taking my kid away from me.

132
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,875
Never again!

133
00:07:42,088 --> 00:07:43,088
[groans]

134
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,554
Thanks, Flash. We've got it from here.

135
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:54,934
Harold, I'm innocent, I swear.
I'm innocent.

136
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:56,102
Please, believe me.

137
00:07:56,227 --> 00:07:57,579
Flash, you've got to help me. Please.

138
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:58,604
I didn't do anything.

139
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,898
Please! I can't lose my son! Please.

140
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,443
I didn't do this. I swear to God,
I didn't do this.

141
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:06,463
- Where's Mom?
- What's going to happen to my son?

142
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:07,822
- Dad!
- Barry!

143
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:08,905
Dad!

144
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:11,659
Harold, I didn't do anything, I swear.

145
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:13,995
I swear. Please, believe me. Please!

146
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,594
Okay. I got to be honest.

147
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:33,347
Eh... Based on these police reports,

148
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:36,517
I'd advise Mr. Birch here to start
thinking about a plea bargain.

149
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:38,602
[sighs] Okay.

150
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,358
I'm guessing you feel differently.

151
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,861
I... I just want to make sure
they got the right guy.

152
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,279
Well, it seems like they do.

153
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,990
He had an argument with the victim
hours before he was killed.

154
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,158
He's got no alibi.

155
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:54,660
The crime matches his powers,
and the guy is an ex-con.

156
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:57,496
Who was released early
for good behavior.

157
00:08:57,872 --> 00:08:59,457
Korber and those other officers

158
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,435
could have been killed, too,
if you hadn't intervened.

159
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:04,003
[stammers]
I know how it looks for Birch,

160
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:07,214
but there isn't any hard evidence
that he's guilty.

161
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,675
And last night,
he supposedly killed a man.

162
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,428
And then, instead of laying low,
he went back to work this morning?

163
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:14,472
As a security guard, of all things?

164
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:16,474
It's just... It doesn't add up.

165
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,517
Yeah. Stranger things have happened.

166
00:09:19,185 --> 00:09:23,147
I know. Look, I've worked
hundreds of cases like this,

167
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,275
and I'm telling you something about this

168
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,194
just... it doesn't feel right to me.

169
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:33,074
Okay. Okay, but you know
that Birch had motive

170
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:34,992
and opportunity to commit this murder.

171
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,590
You didn't see the look on his face
when they took him from his son.

172
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:40,706
He was...

173
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:44,835
He was begging for me
to believe that he's innocent.

174
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:46,544
And you do.

175
00:09:47,797 --> 00:09:48,797
I'm not sure yet.

176
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:54,178
Look, would you be willing
to meet with him?

177
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:56,180
To get a read on his emotions?

178
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:02,103
Yes, of course, I'll meet with him.

179
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:04,563
Guilty or not,
everyone deserves proper representation.

180
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:05,647
But, Barry...

181
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:10,027
using my powers to read a client?

182
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:13,489
It's an ethical line that I can't cross.

183
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:15,241
Yeah, of course. I'm sorry. I...

184
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,452
I just don't want to see someone

185
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:21,122
go to prison for a murder
they might not have committed.

186
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,126
[Taylor] So, Rosie,

187
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:31,048
dropping out of Cornell to become
a social media influencer took guts.

188
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:34,552
What inspired you
to make such a bold decision?

189
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:38,264
Let's just say
institutionalized learning

190
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,224
felt like a total prison.

191
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:41,767
Uh! Mm-hmm.

192
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:43,894
Trust me, it's not.

193
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:46,772
What my supervisor means

194
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:51,277
is that our readers are just so eager
to get to know the real Rosie Levin.

195
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:53,612
So sorry. Will you excuse me?

196
00:10:53,863 --> 00:10:55,072
Uh... [sighs]

197
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:58,242
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what her problem is.

198
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,662
Uh, now, uh, why don't you take me
through a typical day?

199
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,290
Lydia.

200
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:08,251
Garcia.

201
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:09,794
[scoffs]

202
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:14,009
Oh, my God, it's so good to see you.
How are you?

203
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,341
[chuckles]

204
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:18,387
Well, look who decided to come say hi.

205
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:22,516
I haven't seen you since Iron Heights.
At least, not in person.

206
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:25,936
Then, again, your face is plastered
all over that news website.

207
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:30,399
CCC Media. Yeah, I... I work there now.

208
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:34,028
These days, I'm writing the headlines,
not starring in them. [chuckles]

209
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,403
Must be nice.

210
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:41,452
So, you've been working here
since you got out?

211
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:46,248
No. Um, my first gig was cleaning out
porta potties. That was fun.

212
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,586
I guess this is kind of like
a promotion for me.

213
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:52,963
Not that you care.

214
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:54,506
What's that supposed to mean?

215
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,051
I get it. You're too busy
to help out old friends.

216
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,012
You're mad because I'm a reporter now?

217
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:04,558
Look. You got out, walked into
a legit career. Good for you.

218
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:09,063
Meanwhile, I busted my butt
to get my GED in prison

219
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:10,397
and look where it got me.

220
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:11,815
[chuckles nervously]

221
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:15,444
This is just temporary.
I mean, I'm sure you can do better.

222
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:18,405
Gee, thanks.

223
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:19,823
I didn't mean it like that.

224
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:20,949
I know what you meant.

225
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,246
The truth is, cleaning floors
is the best job I can get

226
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:26,580
with a record like mine.

227
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:30,751
People like you don't see
who I'm trying to be, only who I was.

228
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:33,712
Makes it really hard, you know.

229
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,632
No. I don't know.

230
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,471
Not yet. But...
I'd like to try and help you.

231
00:12:43,097 --> 00:12:44,598
How could you possibly help me?

232
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,977
Let me share your story with the world.

233
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:51,897
Trust me.

234
00:12:57,653 --> 00:13:00,114
Before we get into this,
I need to know my son's okay.

235
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:01,852
The cops won't tell me anything.

236
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:02,907
Yeah, Harold is fine.

237
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:05,388
He's with Social Services
just until they can track down his mom.

238
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:07,788
Good luck with that.
She's been in and out of his life

239
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:10,124
since he was born.
No telling when she'll turn up again.

240
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,253
<i>Harold's mother, she took care of him
while you were in Iron Heights, right?</i>

241
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:15,379
Barely.

242
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,810
That's why I got my act together
and got the hell out of that place.

243
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:23,470
But Harold, he never forgave me for
abandoning him, and I don't blame him.

244
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:27,433
Every second of the four years
I spent in that prison,

245
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:29,393
it was like he was serving time, too.

246
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,856
The thing is, Harold's a good kid.

247
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:37,776
I don't know what he did
to deserve a father like me.

248
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,197
Okay. Why don't you tell me
what happened last night?

249
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,325
Stan and I got into it at the bar.

250
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,452
I sold him a guitar
so I could buy Harold

251
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,120
backstage passes to the Lips concert.

252
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:51,623
And, at the last minute, Stan decided to
only pay me half of what we agreed on.

253
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,125
Then what happened?

254
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,002
Sure, we argued.

255
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:58,547
And, yeah, I told him this wasn't over.
But then I went home.

256
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:01,091
That's the last I saw of Stan.

257
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,028
Is there anybody that can confirm that?

258
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:05,262
Anybody? Was your son home
with you last night?

259
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:06,597
No, he was out with friends.

260
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:08,766
So, unless my vinyl collection
can talk...

261
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:11,893
I got nothing.

262
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:17,982
<i>All right.</i>

263
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:21,487
Listen, I've been around long enough
to know

264
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,322
you're about to tell me I'm screwed.

265
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:27,493
But I'm telling you, I'm innocent.

266
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:32,831
Jaco, the bartender
places you at the scene

267
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:34,416
moments before the crime.

268
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,503
Any jury is going to see that

269
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,588
as more than enough evidence to convict.

270
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:40,671
No!

271
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:44,676
I won't leave my son
without a dad again, okay?

272
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:46,219
You got that?

273
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:51,284
[Cecile] <i>Look, I wish I had
something better to tell you, Barry,</i>

274
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:56,230
but Birch just doesn't have the pieces
that you need to build a strong defense,

275
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:59,858
and all of the evidence, it's still
pointing to him as the killer.

276
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:02,528
I... I know you didn't use
your abilities in there,

277
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,279
but what does your gut tell you?

278
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,659
It's telling me that whether
he is actually innocent or not,

279
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:12,371
he definitely believes that he is.

280
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:15,332
But it's not nearly enough.

281
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:19,169
Yeah, but look, if there is any chance
he is innocent, we have to help him.

282
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:20,545
[gate opening]

283
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,008
What's going on?

284
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:29,179
Jaco Birch just escaped custody
en route to holding.

285
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,223
- Was anybody hurt?
- Thankfully, no.

286
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,475
But so much for
his "I'm innocent" sob story, huh?

287
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,026
[Donna gasps]

288
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,698
You told the cops I killed Stan?

289
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,617
Come on, man.
I only told them what I saw.

290
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,829
And when you think about it,
I really didn't see anything.

291
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:56,874
Hey, you and me are... are good, right?

292
00:15:56,957 --> 00:16:00,502
I'm gonna lose my son because of you.
Because of what you said!

293
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:03,255
Hey, man, relax.
Maybe I didn't see anything.

294
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,717
Damn straight,
'cause you're gonna take it back.

295
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:10,012
You're gonna take it all back right now!

296
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:11,722
Wait, man, please! [screams]

297
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:17,519
[system beeping]

298
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,772
- Nothing on the satellites yet.
- Okay, keep trying.

299
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:23,293
We have to figure out where Birch
is going before C.C.P.D. does.

300
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,503
It's the only way we'll have a chance
to prove he's innocent.

301
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:27,714
I'm sorry, are we talking about the guy
who just burned his way

302
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:29,823
through a C.C.P.D. transport convoy?

303
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:32,409
The fact that Birch ran away
doesn't change the evidence.

304
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:34,870
There's still nothing directly tying him
to Mullen's death.

305
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:40,292
Sure. Barry, sure, but fleeing custody
is not exactly exculpatory.

306
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,752
And I'm saying that as his lawyer.

307
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,922
She's right, Barr,
if Jaco Birch is innocent, why run?

308
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:47,508
Why did Frost run
when Chillblaine framed her?

309
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:49,903
Because, unfortunately,
sometimes people don't get a fair shot

310
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,011
from the justice system.

311
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,764
Yeah, and, as a former DA, I know.

312
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,475
I know that sometimes it's true,
they don't.

313
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:59,686
Okay, but how do we know Birch isn't
the same hothead he's always been?

314
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,664
I mean, he'd be halfway across
the country by now.

315
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,607
No, he didn't skip town.
Not without his son.

316
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,900
And you know this how?

317
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,194
- I just do.
- Okay.

318
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:11,406
Uh, guys, emergency dispatch
is getting calls about a fire

319
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:13,742
right outside O'Shaughnessy's.

320
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:14,867
[Cecile] What?

321
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:16,954
Why would Birch go back
to the scene of the crime?

322
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,079
If it's really Birch.

323
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:20,373
Yeah, I'll find out.

324
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:25,379
I'll go with you for backup.

325
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:31,551
Holy crap.

326
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,645
What kind of fire is this?

327
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:44,815
I think I know who this is.

328
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:48,902
Is that the witness who pinned it
on Birch? The bartender?

329
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,074
You know, your innocent man, Barr,
is not looking so innocent anymore.

330
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,945
I thought we were supposed
to be working together on this.

331
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,502
Next time. Right now,
I am in the zone.

332
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,701
I thought I saw you two were back.
How'd the interview go?

333
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:12,301
Great. I feel like the story
is exploding out of me.

334
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:15,304
So, everything went well?

335
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:18,098
[sighs in exasperation] Yeah. Peachy.

336
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,643
Seriously, you're gonna love
what I'm doing here. I promise.

337
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:25,188
[clears throat] Excuse me,
I just need to get some air.

338
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:26,272
[chuckles awkwardly]

339
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,660
All right.
Well, I'll let you get back to it.

340
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:32,776
I'm looking forward
to reading the finished product.

341
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:34,697
Roger that.

342
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:40,078
I got back the tomography reports
from the crime lab.

343
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,623
Donna Winters, the bartender who died,

344
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:46,460
the thermal lesions on her body match
the marks on Stan Mullen's body exactly.

345
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:47,711
Too exactly.

346
00:18:47,712 --> 00:18:50,398
I mean, there's no pyrokinetic meta
who could replicate burns like that

347
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:51,423
even if they tried.

348
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,678
I... I... I told you. Something about
Birch's case just wasn't adding up.

349
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,428
Barry, we're the ones who told Birch

350
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:58,114
that Donna blamed him
for the first murder

351
00:18:58,138 --> 00:18:59,222
and now Donna is dead.

352
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,682
She's dead.

353
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,559
You have gotta see
how that looks, right?

354
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:05,062
Yeah, but the facts are still
on Birch's side.

355
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:08,023
Neither crime scene
has any direct evidence tying him to it.

356
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,317
No DNA, no fingerprints, no witnesses...

357
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:11,818
That are still alive.

358
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:15,405
Barry, you gotta admit,
Birch has motive.

359
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:20,619
And the more emotional he gets,
the stronger his powers are.

360
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:23,705
Like, you know, earth-shattering.

361
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,757
Thank goodness
he wasn't in a bad mood today.

362
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,031
That doesn't make him a killer.

363
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,002
[Cecile sighs]

364
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:31,272
Okay, look, we know that you're just

365
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:33,048
trying to do the right thing here,
we do.

366
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:38,178
But, Barry, we can't help but wonder if
just maybe you're not thinking clearly

367
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:39,471
about this case.

368
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:42,224
Oh, so that's it.

369
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:46,770
You've already decided.
You're giving up on him.

370
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:49,648
No, we're just looking at
the facts, man.

371
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:50,732
So am I.

372
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:54,111
And two exact fire signatures
makes me think Birch is not our guy.

373
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,048
Chester, could you please
at least take a look at this

374
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:58,112
and see what you can find?

375
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:03,577
Yeah, okay.

376
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,724
Look, I know that you've all thought
Birch was guilty from the start...

377
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,348
[Cecile] No, we haven't.
That's not true.

378
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,420
Each of us have been trying
to help him from the beginning.

379
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:12,879
But then Birch ran off.

380
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:14,589
He was just trying to protect his son.

381
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,008
What about other suspects?

382
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:18,260
There are none.

383
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:21,847
Both victims worked at O'Shaughnessy's.

384
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:26,017
Maybe they, uh, owed somebody money
or pissed off the wrong person.

385
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:30,689
I... I get Birch is a known fire-meta
and an ex-con.

386
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:32,607
That also makes him
the perfect fall guy.

387
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:34,359
Okay, now you think he's being framed.

388
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:35,527
I'm saying it's possible.

389
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,989
Look, Birch is the freaking Hotness
and a bad guy.

390
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,282
It feels like he's changed.

391
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:41,450
Not to us.

392
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:43,827
And, honestly,
it feels like you're asking us

393
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,370
to believe in something impossible.

394
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:46,454
Yeah, I am.

395
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,210
'Cause if anyone had when I was a kid,
my dad wouldn't have gone to jail.

396
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:53,669
Barry.

397
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,255
Barry, honey.

398
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:58,008
Look, we're... We're sorry.

399
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,760
We weren't thinking.

400
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:00,927
Look, here's the deal.

401
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:03,180
I believe Birch is innocent.

402
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,349
So, with or without your help,

403
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:09,311
I'm gonna do everything
within my power to clear his name.

404
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,534
[Joe] That looks familiar.

405
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:30,957
It's been, what, seven, eight years
since I've seen this board.

406
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,003
Except, the last time it was covered
with photos of a different man.

407
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:38,965
Cecile told me what happened.

408
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:41,968
The team is worried about you.

409
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:43,637
No, they don't have to be. I'm fine.

410
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:44,846
No, you're not.

411
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:48,475
They don't know what today is.

412
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:50,060
I do.

413
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:54,689
February 1st. Henry's birthday.

414
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:06,701
You remember, when he was turning 45...

415
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,080
and your mom threw that surprise party?

416
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:15,877
The whole block showed up,
and you were baking cupcakes for weeks.

417
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:19,923
And when the big night came,
before he can even take off his coat...

418
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,092
his pager went off.

419
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:23,969
A patient needed him.

420
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:26,555
He had to miss his own party.

421
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:30,767
And you were disappointed,
of course, but you understood.

422
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:35,313
He was helping save
people's lives, right?

423
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:36,815
Yeah.

424
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:42,404
But Henry, he was crushed.

425
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:46,867
He was worried that he was missing
all these moments

426
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:48,952
with you and your mom.

427
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,079
But I told him,

428
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,124
"Those cupcakes might be stale now,

429
00:22:56,293 --> 00:23:01,590
but... you'll have more birthdays
with both of them."

430
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,883
Only, there weren't.

431
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,469
That was the last one
before it happened.

432
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:07,971
- Barry!
- Dad!

433
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:09,180
Stay out of the house!

434
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:11,348
Barry!

435
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:14,853
Joe, the look in my dad's eyes
that night...

436
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:19,691
it was the same look in Birch's eyes
when they arrested him.

437
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:27,157
Look of an innocent man
desperate not to lose his son.

438
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:30,649
Begging someone to believe him.

439
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:32,370
And you do?

440
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:34,539
Yeah, I do.

441
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:37,834
I just keep thinking about
all the time my dad lost.

442
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,084
[sighs wearily]

443
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:42,088
All the birthdays we spent
separated by Plexiglas.

444
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:47,510
I can't let Birch and his son
go through that if he's innocent.

445
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:52,617
I don't know, maybe the team's right.

446
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,559
Maybe I'm making something
out of nothing.

447
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:59,648
Do you think maybe I've had blinders up
this whole time?

448
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:01,482
Maybe.

449
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:02,733
Or...

450
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:06,237
you can see something they can't.

451
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,280
Look...

452
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:11,660
what you went through,
I wouldn't wish on anyone.

453
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:20,835
But what it did was it gave you
the ability to believe in the underdog

454
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:24,714
when no one else is willing to.

455
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:29,051
So...

456
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:33,139
if your gut tells you...

457
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,352
to not give up on Birch...

458
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:43,024
then, for Henry's sake, don't.

459
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:47,529
Not yet.

460
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,322
[cell phone chirps]

461
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,168
[Allegra] So, what do you think?

462
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,216
I think the lede is in the second graph,
not the first.

463
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,762
But, besides that, it is a very engaging

464
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:14,556
and beautifully written article.

465
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,641
I think it's gonna open a lot of eyes.

466
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:18,351
Seriously, you like it?

467
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:19,643
Yes, I do.

468
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:21,908
But, Allegra,
as strong as that article is,

469
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:23,398
that's not what I assigned you.

470
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:28,486
I know, but I have
a unique insight into Lydia,

471
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,322
and me connecting
with the story so much

472
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:33,450
is what's gonna make it connect
with our audience.

473
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:34,533
Agreed.

474
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:37,996
But I wanted you
to make this special

475
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:39,664
and to help support a colleague.

476
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:42,751
There's some decent writing in Taylor's
article, but it's all surface.

477
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:43,752
There's no context.

478
00:25:43,753 --> 00:25:47,213
There's no examination
of Rosie's influence on young women.

479
00:25:48,423 --> 00:25:50,359
Allegra, you could have made
this story so much better

480
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:52,153
if you would have helped her,
like I asked you to do.

481
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:54,471
Yeah, Iris, I'm so sorry.

482
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:58,308
The interview with Rosie,
it wasn't going anywhere.

483
00:25:58,558 --> 00:25:59,684
So, you abandoned it?

484
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:01,561
I followed my instinct.

485
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,189
I... I thought that's what
you'd want me to do.

486
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:07,025
What I want is for you to learn
how to be a supervisor.

487
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:09,819
That's why I'm trying to teach you
how to mentor her.

488
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:11,988
Instead, you did just the opposite.

489
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:17,202
But... I have an obligation
to our readers

490
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:19,537
to publish the best articles that I can,

491
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:25,251
and your profile on Lydia is amazing.

492
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:27,754
I think it's gonna start
an important conversation.

493
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:31,091
So, we're gonna go with it.

494
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:35,595
But, next time, please run
any changes this big by me first.

495
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:38,473
And another thing,
I want you to talk to Taylor.

496
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,142
You're her immediate boss,

497
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:44,354
so it's up to you to fix this,
not the other way around.

498
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:50,086
[Barry] Chester, what'd you find?

499
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,986
- You were right.
- Yeah, check this out.

500
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,840
[Chester] So, I cross referenced
the heat signature from O'Shaughnessy's

501
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:57,464
to the one in the alleyway
from the second victim, like you asked.

502
00:26:58,118 --> 00:26:59,118
Guess what I found.

503
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:02,205
Both signatures produced
an anomalous heat effect

504
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:05,542
created by non-composites reacting
to hydrogen isotopes.

505
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:06,918
Nuclear fusion.

506
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:10,380
What you're describing is cold fusion.

507
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:14,634
But Birch's powers come
from absorbing heat, not nuclear fusion,

508
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:15,717
meaning...

509
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,302
He's innocent.

510
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:21,891
Yeah. We get this data to C.C.P.D.,
we can clear his name.

511
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:24,811
Okay, Chester,
put everything you have on a drive.

512
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,105
I need to get this
to Captain Kramer fast.

513
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:28,773
I need to find Birch.

514
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:31,525
[computer chirping]

515
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:33,088
Let's hope he doesn't do
anything else stupid

516
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:34,271
before we can clear his name.

517
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:48,418
Harold, I know this is tough, but we're
gonna find you a place to stay.

518
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,672
I'm here to make sure your transition
is as easy as possible. Okay?

519
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,551
Whatever.
I'm used to Jaco being a screw up.

520
00:27:57,552 --> 00:27:58,970
Especially since he got his powers.

521
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,356
I want my son!

522
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:12,733
Now!

523
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:19,407
Harold, get out of the car.

524
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:24,930
Get down on your knees
with your hands above your head.

525
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:27,707
I'm not letting you cart my son off
to a bunch of strangers. Harold!

526
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,251
Birch, I said get down.

527
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:34,589
Why won't you leave me alone?

528
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:40,428
C.C.P.D. scanners have Birch
at Hastings Avenue and Nicola Lane.

529
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:46,976
Oh. Man, satellites just picked up
a city vehicle at the exact same spot.

530
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,520
It's a Social Services SUV.

531
00:28:49,604 --> 00:28:51,439
He's trying to get his son.

532
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:53,792
Barry, C.C.P.D. still doesn't know
that Birch is innocent.

533
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:56,416
- If he tries to take his kid by force...
- We have to stop him...

534
00:28:57,028 --> 00:28:58,548
before he does something he'll regret.

535
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:01,991
- Birch, listen to me.
- No, you listen.

536
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:04,202
I just want my son.

537
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:05,954
Now get out of my way.

538
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:07,830
[low rumbling]

539
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:11,918
Wait. Wait. No, wait, wait.

540
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:15,922
- Harold, stay back.
- She's right, son.

541
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:17,650
- It's too dangerous.
- I'm not scared of him.

542
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:19,550
[rumbling continues]

543
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:22,679
Look, Harold, I know how bad this looks,

544
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:25,265
but I swear I'd never hurt anyone.

545
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:26,766
What's wrong with you?

546
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,185
You get that
you're a total loser, right?

547
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,022
I am a total loser.

548
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:35,566
Have been since the day I was born.

549
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:38,212
I thought having powers
would change all that,

550
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:39,796
but all they did was make things worse.

551
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:43,215
And now they've turned the only
good thing in my life against me.

552
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:44,993
My own kid!

553
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:46,828
[rumbling intensifies]

554
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:49,330
All I wanted

555
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:52,041
when I got out of Iron Heights
was a clean start,

556
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,919
to get my life together
so we can be a family.

557
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:04,387
This is your final warning.

558
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:07,724
Who cares? No matter what I do,
you'll always think I'm a killer.

559
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:10,435
And now you want to take
my son away forever?

560
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:13,187
Well, I won't let you!

561
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:19,485
[panting]

562
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:21,237
You can't keep me from my family, Flash.

563
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:22,530
No one's taking Harold away.

564
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:24,741
I know you didn't kill anyone, Birch,

565
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:26,468
your lawyer found evidence
to prove you're innocent.

566
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:29,370
But you have to stop what you're doing
before anyone gets hurt.

567
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:32,289
Okay.

568
00:30:36,878 --> 00:30:37,878
All right?

569

Oh, come on.

I'm not doing anything.

00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,519
It's not what you're doing,
it's what you already did.

Officer, get them to safety!

00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:13,581
Thanks for the save.

Birch, your heat abilities,

577
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:23,025
they're connected to the earth
beneath wherever you're standing.

578
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:27,011
Yeah, science is not my strong suit, but
yeah, okay, I'll buy that for a dollar.

He means emotionally.

Ooh.

- Right.
- Chester,

582
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,434
can you scan
for thermal activity below us?

Yeah, yeah.

When Birch was upset,

589
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:46,197
he must've absorbed so much heat
from the planet's core that

590
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:48,366
he opened up a lava channel.

Flash, you got to do something.
I know this is all my fault.

595
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,807
But everyone in this city,

596
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:17,478
my son, he can't die because of me.
You got to save him.

00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:21,023
No, you have to save him.
Look, I've got an idea.

598

If it works, there's gonna be a huge
release of pressure forming beneath us.

599

When that happens, I need you
to absorb the remaining heat.

600

I've never done
anything like that before.

then released it
directly into the lava channel.

I stopped the meltdown,

but not the massive heat exchange
that was being released.

00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:03,143
Mark and I are
going to Mardi Gras next year.

627
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:04,167
Okay.

628
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:07,088
Wait. So, saving hundreds of lives...

629
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:08,297
Try thousands.

630
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:11,008
...saving that many lives
is what I just did?

631
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:12,092
Yeah.

632
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:15,221
Looks like you're
the father Harold deserves after all.

633
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:17,472
You okay?

634
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:19,183
You used your powers again.

635
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,019
I know. I know...

636
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:23,187
To save us.

637
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:29,902
Thanks, Dad.

638
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:32,697
I love you. I love you.

639
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:03,269
Okay. Okay.

640
00:35:03,728 --> 00:35:05,448
Social Services is
on their way with Harold.

641
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,898
They should be here any minute.

642
00:35:09,025 --> 00:35:10,025
[exhales]

643
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:12,707
I can't believe they're actually
letting me have custody of my son.

644
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:15,364
That evidence you found saved my ass.

645
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:18,909
Plus, Harold is almost 18

646
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:22,538
and Judge Hankerson
let him decide where he wanted to be.

647
00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:25,249
- And, you know, with his mom being...
- MIA as always?

648
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:29,420
You and Harold are getting
another chance. A real one this time.

649
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:32,048
It's all because of you two.

650
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:33,798
And The Flash.

651
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:35,133
Yeah, but...

652
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:36,259
[sighs]

653
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,180
you're the one
who told him not to give up on me.

654
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:40,847
[chuckles]

655
00:35:40,848 --> 00:35:42,350
- I'm just really grateful.
- Yeah.

656
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:43,434
Thanks. Thank you.

657
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:46,312
And if there's ever anything
I can do for you, just let me know.

658
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:48,439
Uh... Just be there for Harold.

659
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:00,242
- Are you okay?
- I will be.

660
00:36:01,786 --> 00:36:02,787
Hey there, kiddo.

661
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:04,162
Hey.

662
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:06,122
Come on.

663
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:13,172
Dinner is on me.
We've got a lot to catch up on.

664
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:23,348
[exhales]

665
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:26,519
Barry, they are gonna be all right.

666
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:33,734
I guess the real question is...

667
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:35,902
are you?

668
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:48,082
Come to gloat?

669
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:51,127
No. Kind of the opposite.

670
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:55,631
I guess you saw the first article
for our new profile section.

671
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:57,550
- You mean yours?
- Taylor,

672
00:36:57,633 --> 00:36:59,260
I know how this looks and...

673
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,221
I want to apologize.

674
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:06,142
Yes, Iris loves the Sanchez story,
but we are running

675
00:37:06,225 --> 00:37:08,310
your piece on Rosie Levin next week.

676
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:11,439
And our audience deserves to read it.

677
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:12,857
Thanks.

678
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:16,193
So, tell me, what did I do to deserve

679
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:18,529
getting stabbed in the back
by my own supervisor?

680
00:37:19,864 --> 00:37:21,240
Iris assigned you to help me,

681
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:24,493
not run me over,
which is exactly what you did.

682
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:29,081
I didn't mean to. And you're right,
I shouldn't have done that.

683
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:33,294
I just... I got excited,
and I guess I felt like

684
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:36,589
Lydia's story was something
our readers needed right now.

685
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:38,215
And that's how I felt about my story.

686
00:37:38,758 --> 00:37:42,678
Iris did, too, until you called in
a favor with the boss.

687
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,139
Guess you learned that in prison.

688
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:47,432
[scoffs]

689
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:52,605
You're right.
I got lost in a great story.

690
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:54,648
You stole my byline.

691
00:37:54,732 --> 00:37:56,984
Taylor, we are still publishing
your article.

692
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:59,403
Because Iris is a journalist
with ethics.

693
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:01,530
Something you are clearly lacking.

694
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:04,408
Fine. Good to know.

695
00:38:04,742 --> 00:38:08,704
Look, I messed up. I said I'm sorry.

696
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:10,956
It won't happen again.

697
00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:14,084
But I am still your supervisor.

698
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:17,129
So I'm hoping we can get past this.

699
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:19,047
Okay?

700
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:25,638
I'm gonna destroy you. Yeah?

701
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:38,901
Shouldn't we be toasting with champagne?

702
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:42,822
Mm-mm. Plain old light beer,
that was Henry's favorite.

703
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:44,705
And I used to give him hell about it.
I'd say,

704
00:38:44,782 --> 00:38:46,867
"You're a doctor,
you should have better taste."

705
00:38:46,951 --> 00:38:48,786
Then he'd laugh and he'd say,

706
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:52,331
"Well, I'll drink something
more expensive when you buy it."

707
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:53,874
[all laughing]

708
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:59,255
Do you guys remember when Henry
filled in on Dad's softball team?

709
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:01,382
Oh, my gosh, what a disaster.

710
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:02,800
What? What happened?

711
00:39:02,883 --> 00:39:03,883
Well, even as a kid,

712
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:06,364
I knew that you're not supposed
to catch a ball with your face.

713
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:08,055
[Cecile] Oh, no.

714
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:09,138
No. Really?

715
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:10,349
Yeah. Right in the nose.

716
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:13,126
Good thing he was a doctor.
He was able to reset it himself.

717
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:17,022
Hey, babe, are you okay?

718
00:39:18,816 --> 00:39:22,611
Yeah, no, it's... you know, it's nice to
hear everybody remembering him this way.

719
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:24,905
What do you remember the most?

720
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:28,576
Yeah, little things, mostly.

721
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,160
[chuckles]

722
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:33,621
Um...

723
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:35,791
Like, [stutters] he never made me

724
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:40,629
clean my plate at dinner,
even when all I'd eat were carbs,

725
00:39:40,713 --> 00:39:44,925
like mac and cheese
or those Hawaiian dinner rolls.

726
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:46,677
[Iris West] Mm.

727
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:49,305
I... I kept asking him

728
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:52,892
to read me the same bedtime story
over and over.

729
00:39:53,726 --> 00:39:57,646
It was one about
the hippo who went to school

730
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,774
and made cookies for everyone,
and then became their friends.

731
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:05,321
I can see how ridiculous
that must have been now.

732
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:08,073
No, I'm sure he enjoyed it.

733
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:10,743
[exhales]

734
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:13,245
Mostly, I just remember being loved.

735
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:19,001
I still miss him, every day.

736
00:40:19,335 --> 00:40:22,004
And that is okay.

737
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:23,212
Yeah.

738
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:26,507
Well...

739
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,803
happy birthday, Dad.

740
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:49,073
So if Birch didn't kill those two,
then who did?

741
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:51,742
I've checked
every fire-based meta human in here,

742
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:55,704
everyone's either still at Iron Heights
or alibied up.

743
00:40:55,788 --> 00:40:58,207
So, what do we do now?

744
00:40:58,749 --> 00:40:59,959
I know what Joe would say.

745
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:04,588
No suspects? Then shift your focus
to where it matters.

746
00:41:04,672 --> 00:41:05,672
The victims.

747
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:09,802
But Stan and Donna were different ages,
races and genders.

748
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:12,030
But they both worked at O'Shaughnessy's.

749
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:13,681
So the killer's a disgruntled employee?

750
00:41:13,764 --> 00:41:16,475
Or they were chosen at random,
and we're still missing something.

751
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,521
What are you thinking?

752
00:41:21,063 --> 00:41:23,357
Chester, the cold fusion data
we pulled off the bodies,

753
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,560
could you program those variables
into the satellites?

754
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:27,152
Sure. What am I looking for?

755
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:31,490
More victims.

756
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:38,261
If there's a meta serial killer
out there, we need to find them...

757
00:41:39,707 --> 00:41:41,067
...before somebody else gets hurt.
