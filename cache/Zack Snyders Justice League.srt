1
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,600
Alert the queen.

2
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,590
Hyah!

3
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,150
Bruce vayne.

4
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,940
Bruce Wayne.

5
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,380
Talk.

6
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,510
I believe there is a stranger.

7
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,220
Comes to this village
from the sea.

8
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,140
He comes in the winter
when the people are hungry.

9
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,530
He brings fish.

10
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,310
He comes on the king tide.

11
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,730
That was last night.

12
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,570
You have eyes, so see.

13
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,490
Icebergs in the harbor.

14
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,660
It's four months since
the last ship got through.

15
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,880
Well, this stranger
doesn't come by ship.

16
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,470
There are enemies
coming from far away.

17
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,430
I need warriors.

18
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,140
This stranger, others like him.

19
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,810
I'm building an alliance
to defend ourselves.

20
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,650
It's very important
that I see this man.

21
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,110
If this stranger exists,

22
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,370
he'll give him your message.

23
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,750
$5,000 American.

24
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,750
Look, I'll give you $25,000

25
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,370
to talk to this man
right now, outside.

26
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,090
How dare this dog
speak to us like children.

27
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,560
Ooh, magical man from the sea.

28
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,440
We are poor, not stupid.

29
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,440
Get out.

30
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,810
I'm sorry.

31
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,780
Can't do that.

32
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,150
I'll leave after we've spoken.

33
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,120
He said, "get out."

34
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,260
Arthur curry.

35
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,180
Also known as
protector of the oceans.

36
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,520
The aquaman.

37
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,950
So, let me get this straight.

38
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,610
You do it dressed like a bat?
Like an actual bat?

39
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,450
Worked for 20 years in Gotham.

40
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,450
Oh, that shithole.

41
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,410
When the fight comes,
we'll need you.

42
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,330
- Don't count on it, Batman.
- Why not?

43
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,230
'Cause I don't like you coming
here, digging into my business

44
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,790
and getting into my life.
I want to be left alone.

45
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,970
Is that why you do this?

46
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,360
Why you help these people out
here in the middle of nowhere?

47
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,390
I've read the stories.

48
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,840
Your good deeds
you think no one sees.

49
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,470
You'll join us.

50
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,350
"Strong man is strongest alone."

51
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,760
You ever heard that?

52
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,600
You ever hear of Superman?

53
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,310
He died fighting next to me.

54
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,060
My point exactly.

55
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,440
He believed we were stronger together.

56
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,640
We owe it to him.

57
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,520
I don't owe anyone anything.

58
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,070
Dressed like a bat.

59
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,790
You're out of your mind, Bruce Wayne.

60
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,550
Move over, dusty.

61
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,520
My god, master Wayne,
but this is cold.

62
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:13,030
Maybe we can catch
the next king tide in Jamaica?

63
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,440
Might be a metahuman or two in Fiji.

64
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,230
Costa Rica's nice.

65
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,820
I found him.

66
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,160
He said no.

67
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,250
So the draft stands at naught for two?

68
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:31,460
Maybe a man who broods
in a cave for a living

69
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,130
isn't cut out to be a recruiter. Hmm?

70
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,560
That's $10, please.

71
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,700
Let us go now

72
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:12,410
my darling companion

73
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:25,060
Set out for the

74
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:32,350
distant skies...

75
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,820
Good morning, miss Lane.

76
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,190
Jerry, hi.

77
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,280
Wow.

78
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,360
You don't miss a day, do you?

79
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,790
Like it here.

80
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,300
They told us our gods would outlive us

81
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:04,010
they told us our dreams would outlive us

82
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:12,520
they told us our gods would outlive us

83
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:20,700
but they lied

84
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,420
Excuse me.

85
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,100
Move!

86
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,280
Move it! Move it!

87
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,670
- No, mate, don't shoot!
- Move, move!

88
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,830
Get the fuck over there!

89
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,370
Move! All of yal!

90
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,980
Line them up along the wall.

91
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,680
Keep them quiet.

92
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,310
- Keep quiet!
- Shut up! Shut up!

93
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,850
Shut them up too!

94
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,480
We'll be making
a statement shortly.

95
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,490
Until then,
if I see any movement,

96
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,620
you'll have a lot of dead kids
on your hands.

97
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,220
Should I take him?

98
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,970
Hold your fire.

99
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,600
They've got kids in there.

100
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,300
Yeah, he's not bluffing, chief.

101
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,390
St. brigid's had a school trip today.

102
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,580
Quiet! Shut up!

103
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,970
Down with the modern world.

104
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,680
Back to the dark ages.

105
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,190
Quiet!

106
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,810
I said shut your fucking mouth.

107
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,660
Who are you?

108
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,670
The lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.

109
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,960
Now, who are you?

110
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,580
We're a small group
of reactionary terrorists

111
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,380
who wanna turn back
the clock in Europe

112
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,800
- a thousand years.
- Boring. Why the hostages?

113
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,560
We have no demands.

114
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,250
We're just stalling the police
while we do it.

115
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,760
While you do what?

116
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:21,140
You're too late.
The countdown's already begun.

117
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,400
In a few minutes, four city blocks...

118
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,990
While the world watches.

119
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,630
Nol

120
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,750
like lambs to the slaughter.

121
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,220
I don't believe it.

122
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:03,690
Believe it.

123
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,090
Is everyone all right?
Are you okay?

124
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,340
Good. It's okay.

125
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,770
It's okay. It's over.
You can stand up.

126
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,020
It's all good.

127
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,810
It's over now. Are you okay?

128
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,480
You okay? Good.

129
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,440
Are you okay, Princess?

130
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,700
Can I be like you someday?

131
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,460
You can be anything you want to be.

132
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,750
Come on. Let's go.

133
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,760
Any changes today?

134
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,380
No, my queen.

135
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,710
The mother box has awoken,

136
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,050
yet nothing has happened.

137
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,300
It has slept for thousands of years

138
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,440
since the first age.

139
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,940
Why did it wake at all?

140
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,690
This is the first time it's gone quiet

141
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,990
since the crack appeared.

142
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,820
Maybe it's going back to sleep.

143
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,620
Evil does not sleep.

144
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,950
It waits.

145
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,920
Something is coming.

146
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,640
Prepare for battle!

147
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,540
Amazons, on your marks!

148
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,200
Ready!

149
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,440
Defenders.

150
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,360
They have failed 100,000 worlds.

151
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:49,360
They always fail.

152
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:56,000
I've come to enlighten you
to the great darkness.

153
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:59,080
I will bathe in your fear.

154
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,050
Daughters of Themyscira,

155
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,970
show him your fear!

156
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,550
We have no fear!

157
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,440
Gather the legions!

158
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,530
Go with her!

159
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,790
You must seal the cage!

160
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,410
Gol - phillipus!

161
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,230
No!

162
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,950
Behind youl!

163
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,370
Ahhh!

164
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,500
Epione.

165
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,510
Honor us. It's right.

166
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,810
Seal it.

167
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,650
Ready the hammers!

168
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,700
Seal it now!

169
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,090
Guard it with your life.

170
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,060
- Yes, my queen.
- Keep it moving.

171
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,460
Hyah! Hyah!

172
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,590
Hyah!

173
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,630
Got it! Gol

174
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,890
hyah!

175
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:48,750
Oh, noble queen.
Why do you fight?

176
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,530
You can't save her.

177
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,170
You can't save any of them.

178
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,090
The great darkness begins.

179
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,220
Amazons!

180
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,480
Yes, we will find the others.

181
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,850
Draw!

182
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,490
Loose!

183
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,250
He's gone back to his universe.

184
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,350
No.

185
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:32,300
He's gone to the lands of men

186
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,590
to find the other two boxes.

187
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:38,150
We have to light
the ancient warning fire.

188
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,480
The fire has not burned
for 5,000 years.

189
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,190
Men won't know what it means.

190
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,400
Men won't.

191
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,570
She will.

192
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,930
It's toxic.

193
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,820
That's good.

194
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,970
Go!

195
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,130
Follow the scent of the mother boxes.

196
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,840
Find the missing two.

197
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:54,880
Once they are found,
the unity will be formed.

198
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,800
This world will join the others.

199
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,720
He will be pleased.

200
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,810
He will see my worth again.

201
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:08,600
Hey.

202
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,990
Anything on that kid
from the liquor store?

203
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,570
Possibly.

204
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,530
"Possibly."

205
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,290
If I had a dollar for every "possibly."

206
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,080
Yeah, it would make you
even more insufferable.

207
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,760
Facial scan might have
got a hit on him,

208
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,760
our disappearing man.

209
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:35,100
One Mr. Barry Allen from central city.

210
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,680
Might be another false positive,

211
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,170
you'll have to give me
a little time

212
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,560
- to confirm.
- We don't have any more time.

213
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,010
Master Wayne,

214
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,520
you've been working
as if there's no tomorrow

215
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,690
to build this team

216
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,690
of people you can't even find.

217
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,950
I found one.
I found two, including Diana.

218
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,240
Just because Lex Luthor says

219
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:56,110
the planet's in danger of attack?

220
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,280
This has nothing to do with Lex Luthor.

221
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,660
It has to do with him.

222
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,250
I made a promise to him on his grave.

223
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:07,250
I spent a lot of time
trying to divide us.

224
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,210
I need to bring us together
and make this right.

225
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,590
Well, it's been some time
since Luthor's warning.

226
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:16,960
No attacks.
No barbarians at the gate.

227
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,840
Maybe these barbarians don't use a gate.

228
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,390
Maybe they're already here.

229
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,140
Keep looking. What else do you have?

230
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,690
Lab's all yours, Howard.

231
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,440
11:30.

232
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:12,940
Early night for you, Silas.

233
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,200
Yes, early night.

234
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,070
Tell your family I said hello.

235
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,940
What the...

236
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,030
Jesus.

237
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,110
The arrow of Artemis.

238
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:17,730
It will reach the lands of men.

239
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:28,660
Sky torch,

240
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,370
hero beacon,

241
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,250
scatter the darkness.

242
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,660
Burn as you burned in days before.

243
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,720
Show her the darkness before
the daylight of history.

244
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,800
Warn my daughter that war has come

245
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,890
and protect her.

246
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,910
Return to me, Diana.

247
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,160
What did you do
this weekend, Diana?

248
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,840
Nothing very interesting.

249
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,510
That's all you ever tell us.

250
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:05,050
What can I do?
I'm not that exciting.

251
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:08,680
You might as well disappear
when you walk out of here.

252
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,560
Again?

253
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,600
- What is it?
- Now what?

254
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,100
Budget cuts, tomb raiders.

255
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,770
Now add to the list "arson."

256
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:25,840
Yes, good morning

257
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:27,430
from the isle of crete.

258
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,220
As you can see behind me,

259
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,990
an enormous bonfire is burning.

260
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,280
This fire has been burning
through the night.

261
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,740
We're now into the morning

262
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,250
and we are at least five miles away.

263
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,750
And we can still
see it burning as we speak.

264
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,920
This has baffled locals
and government authorities alike

265
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,000
here at this historical site

266
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,630
of the so-called shrine of the Amazons.

267
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:51,700
Now, locals and government
officials are baffled as to

268
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,760
what may have caused this.
Invasion.

269
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,940
Ryan.

270
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,480
- Hiya, doc.
- Is the...

271
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:07,490
No damage to the electron-laser.

272
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,820
- Uh, Dr. Silas stone?
- Yeah.

273
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:11,230
- Ryan choi?
- That's us.

274
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:14,290
Um, who did this?
Did they steal anything?

275
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:16,030
They took whatever was in here.

276
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,080
That? Oh, that wasn't stolen.
Was it, Dr. stone?

277
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,380
No. That was misplaced a while ago.

278
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,800
Object 6-1-9-8-2.
Department of defense archives.

279
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,750
Mmm-hmm. “What was it?

280
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,180
I don't know.

281
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,330
You don't know?

282
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:33,590
I don't know,
which was why I was studying it.

283
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:35,260
What's your rank, doctor?

284
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:37,680
Ryan, would you, uh, do the honors?

285
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,520
- Sure. Okay.
- Thanks.

286
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:42,020
Civilian. Starlabs
is a private contractor.

287
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,220
We work for the dod.

288
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,980
We advise them on xeno-science.

289
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,360
"Xeno-science'"?

290
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:49,860
Alien technology.

291
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,040
For example,

292
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:00,750
the Superman ship.

293
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,160
Eight people

294
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,020
never signed out
of the lab last night, doctor.

295
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:13,590
Cleaning staff, guards,

296
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,390
a few of your research scientists.

297
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:16,770
They were abducted.

298
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,150
Are you sure?

299
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:21,850
Witness saw it all. He escaped.

300
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:25,140
He's here in quarantine now,
working on an ID sketch.

301
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,490
Any idea who or what that might be?

302
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,670
The box isn't safe here.

303
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,640
Victor,

304
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,090
they came looking for it at the lab.

305
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:05,690
People were taken by
some kind of monster or something.

306
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,400
You know a lot about monsters,

307
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:12,440
don't you?

308
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:20,950
Especially how to make 'em.

309
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,170
Mayday! Mayday, mayday!

310
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:29,060
My hull is breached. I'm going down.

311
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,360
Mayday!

312
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:39,610
Is there anybody out there?

313
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,030
Ahh!

314
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:21,230
Whiskey.

315
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:32,960
Tell him to respect the storm next time.

316
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,140
It's on him.

317
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,200
The starry heavens above me

318
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:15,200
the moral law within

319
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,340
so the world appears

320
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:28,720
through this mist of tears

321
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:36,220
there is a kingdom
there is a king

322
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:42,480
and he lives without
and he lives within

323
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:48,360
there is a kingdom
there is a king

324
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:55,160
there is a king
and he is everything

325
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:13,450
King who would be man.

326
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:16,780
Son of a human father
and queen of the seas.

327
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:19,410
All the time I've wasted

328
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:22,620
trying to keep the promise
I made to your mother.

329
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,110
Are you finished, old man?

330
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:28,590
You never sleep
in the same place twice,

331
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,500
yet you keep coming back here.

332
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,430
I like it. It's quiet.

333
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,390
It's your inheritance.

334
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,680
You're the rightful king of Atlantis.

335
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:41,930
Our people suffer.

336
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:44,060
Your people.

337
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:47,770
A brutal, petty, superstitious race.

338
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:49,150
Is the surface any different?

339
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,270
Nobody calls me king of the surface.

340
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:55,070
What do you want, vulko?

341
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,020
Guards near the stronghold

342
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,540
have been disappearing.

343
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:00,120
Snatchers from above.

344
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:01,500
Talk to king orm.

345
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,190
- Your brother?
- Half-brother.

346
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:06,250
He's trying to fan the flames
of war with the surface.

347
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:08,040
He lies.

348
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:11,630
The snatchers have come
from the dark place.

349
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,510
They're looking for it.

350
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:17,680
The mother box
our people guard is not safe.

351
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:21,100
Go to the stronghold of Atlantis.

352
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:22,680
Protect the box.

353
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:24,900
The time has come.

354
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:29,020
Take up your mother's trident.

355
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:43,870
You can't turn your back
on the world forever, Arthur.

356
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,830
Above or below.

357
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:18,580
Desaad.

358
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:22,700
Desaad! I call to thee.

359
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,920
Steppenwolf,
have you begun the conquest?

360
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,420
This world is divided.

361
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,720
They are a primitive species.

362
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:44,230
Unevolved and at war with one another.

363
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,230
Too separate to be one.

364
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,730
Their free will
must be ripped from them,

365
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:51,650
like the other worlds.

366
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:55,940
Given absolution in one glorious belief,

367
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,820
to serve him.

368
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,530
The mother boxes?

369
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:04,030
I have found one of the three.

370
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:06,660
The one that woke and called to me.

371
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,330
The other two still sleep,

372
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:12,340
but the parademons feel their presence.

373
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:13,960
They fly,

374
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:17,720
they search, they take prisoners
who carry the scent,

375
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:22,800
while I build a stronghold
in the name of his glory.

376
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:25,220
Yes.

377
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:28,980
Mighty steppenwolf,

378
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,850
who might have sat here
by the side of the great one.

379
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:41,370
But undone by his self-pride.

380
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:43,900
Desaad...

381
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,360
I fall before you.

382
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:49,910
Let me make a plea to him

383
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:52,000
that I may come home

384
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:54,960
after I take this world in his name.

385
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:57,550
You betrayed him.

386
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:00,460
Your own family.

387
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,850
I saw my mistake.

388
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:05,600
I slaughtered those
who sought his throne.

389
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:10,890
You still owe the great one
50,000 more worlds.

390
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,820
He will hear your plea

391
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,520
when you pay your debt.

392
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:22,490
The mother boxes
will be found and united.

393
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:25,570
No protectors here.

394
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:29,160
No lanterns, no Kryptonian.

395
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:32,950
This world will fall,
like all the others.

396
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,750
For darkseid.

397
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:41,180
For darkseid.

398
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:04,410
You know, I paid millions of dollars

399
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:06,030
for this building's security.

400
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,600
You got your money's worth.

401
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,360
Took me almost a minute to disable it.

402
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,250
Hi there.

403
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:15,920
A new toy?

404
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,000
Prototype troop carrier.

405
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,590
I once knew a man

406
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,340
who would have loved to fly it.

407
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:26,760
The best minds at Wayne aerospace

408
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:27,930
couldn't make it fly.

409
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:30,600
But you can?

410
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:32,430
I have no choice.

411
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:35,350
I need more range
and I need more cargo.

412
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,110
I think there's an attack coming.

413
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:39,270
Not coming, Bruce.

414
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:42,030
It's already here.

415
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:44,690
From what I've learned,

416
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:47,370
they are things from another universe.

417
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,870
They serve a dark power.

418
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,750
An old power.

419
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,330
What do they want?

420
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:56,500
To invade. To conquer.

421
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:01,870
They came here once before, long ago.

422
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,430
A great armada appeared in the sky,

423
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,220
laying waste to all who opposed it.

424
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,480
The leader of the invaders
was a being called darkseid.

425
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:20,890
A name cursed and feared
in every universe.

426
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:25,610
Darkseid was met in battle
by earth's defenders.

427
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:28,280
The old gods, men...

428
01:00:28,870 --> 01:00:31,990
Atlanteans before
their descent into the sea...

429
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:38,130
Amazons before their betrayal
and enslavement

430
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:40,830
and guardians from the stars.

431
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:42,920
Their histories had taught them

432
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:44,590
not to trust each other,

433
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,920
not to hope for an alliance.

434
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:49,090
To fight apart.

435
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:40,860
As darkseid waged war on earth,

436
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,440
he found a secret there.

437
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:46,350
A power hidden in the infinity of space.

438
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:48,020
He called forth mystics

439
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,320
who worshipped and controlled
three objects...

440
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:52,530
The mother boxes.

441
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:54,280
Wait, wait, wait.

442
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,460
"Mother boxes"?

443
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:58,160
Indestructible living machines,

444
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,540
made from a science so advanced,

445
01:02:01,630 --> 01:02:03,790
it looks like sorcery.

446
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,580
To conquer,
three boxes have to synchronize

447
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:10,000
and join together into the unity.

448
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:13,220
The unity cleanses a planet with fire,

449
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:16,980
transforming it into a copy
of the enemy's world.

450
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:20,640
All who live
become servants of darkseid.

451
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,730
Alive but drained of life.

452
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,280
Parademons.

453
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:28,570
Amazons!

454
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:36,160
With me!

455
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,980
But before the unity
could synchronize,

456
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:10,190
the defenders of earth attacked

457
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,520
and fought as one.

458
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,110
Amazons alongside atlanteans.

459
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:16,990
Zeus and his son Ares

460
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,790
alongside the guardians from the sky.

461
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:23,960
A golden age of heroes fighting together

462
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,460
to defend life on earth.

463
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:24,910
They did what no world
had ever done.

464
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:27,240
Sent the enemies back into the stars.

465
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,040
The three mother boxes
never synchronized.

466
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:36,800
The unity never came fo pass.

467
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:39,180
But, in their retreat,

468
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:42,920
the boxes were left behind on earth.

469
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:46,810
They grew weak.
Dogs without masters

470
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:50,230
falling asleep,

471
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,860
awaiting their return.

472
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:55,360
Fading from the view of the enemy,

473
01:05:55,530 --> 01:05:58,690
anonymous among a trillion worlds.

474
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:18,760
The defenders of earth made a vow.

475
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:22,380
Men, atlanteans, and Amazons.

476
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,390
Each would enshrine and guard

477
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,430
one of the three sleeping mother boxes

478
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:30,100
according to the rites
and rituals of their culture

479
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:33,020
in case a box should ever wake again

480
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:34,720
to call out to the planet apokolips

481
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,640
to return and conquer

482
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:40,610
the only world darkseid had ever lost.

483
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:59,230
Something woke the box my people guard.

484
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:01,980
It called out to the dark place...

485
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,570
To one of darkseid's conquerors.

486
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:07,360
The enemy is here.

487
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:09,530
If he's here, where is he?

488
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:11,790
He'll be searching
for the other two boxes.

489
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,920
Hiding until he has all three.
Until he's ready.

490
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:22,510
They said the age of heroes
would never come again.

491
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:23,920
No, it will.

492
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:25,970
It has to.

493
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:31,220
The others. Where are they?

494
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:54,250
Am I late?

495
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:56,830
No, I'm so late. I'm very late.

496
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,380
Oh, hey, buddy. Hey.

497
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:00,040
Oh. No.

498
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:02,710
Okay, bye. Okay.

499
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:05,500
I'm so sorry.

500
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:07,170
I'm late.

501
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:13,720
- Are you, uh...
- I'm

502
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,140
I'm so sorry I'm so late.
I didn't mean to be so late.

503
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:17,960
I'm me and I'm here
and I'm so sorry I'm late.

504
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:19,130
Essentially, the bus didn't come,

505
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:20,150
then the bus did come,

506
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:21,550
but then there was this old woman

507
01:09:21,570 --> 01:09:22,730
counting change for the fare,

508
01:09:22,780 --> 01:09:24,050
like, nickel, penny, nickel, penny.

509
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:25,830
Like, jeez Louise,
let this woman on the bus.

510
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:26,990
She's 107 years old,

511
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:28,970
these are some of her
last few moments of life.

512
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:30,030
Résumeé.

513
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:31,490
Résumeé.

514
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:35,830
Come on.

515
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:40,250
Come on.

516
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:41,960
From the French, of course.

517
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:45,170
"Resume, ” I believe,
is a past participle of...

518
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,090
Uh, wow. That's no good.

519
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,200
It's like,
what lives in my pocket, right?

520
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:56,850
"Paper monster hungry.” uh...

521
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:07,730
Come on. Supposed to be friends now.

522
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,320
Yes.

523
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:26,750
Central city college,
I'm a criminal justice major.

524
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:28,110
You said you had experience

525
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,170
walking dogs.

526
01:11:18,730 --> 01:11:20,390
Long afloat

527
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,770
on shipless oceans

528
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:33,860
I did all my best to smile

529
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:41,790
"til your singing eyes and fingers

530
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:49,710
drew me loving into your eyes

531
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:56,970
then I dreamed, you dreamed about me

532
01:11:58,270 --> 01:12:04,600
were you here when I was for sail?

533
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:19,030
Broken lovelorn on your rocks

534
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:23,160
here I am

535
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:27,040
here I am

536
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:35,890
waiting to hold you

537
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:11,670
Oh, gosh, I hope everyone's okay.

538
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,460
See, in times of crisis, for dog work,

539
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:16,540
I always bring a meat snack.

540
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:17,960
'Cause it makes them feel calm.

541
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,140
'Cause you never know

542
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:20,330
what's going to happen in this city.

543
01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:21,890
I mean, oh, my gosh.

544
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:24,600
Right? I start on Monday?

545
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:05,600
You have been near a mother box.

546
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:08,800
The scent is on you.

547
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:10,640
Where is it?

548
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:13,930
No son or daughter of Atlantis
will ever tell you.

549
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:31,200
Our people have guarded the mother box

550
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,380
for thousands of years.

551
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:41,170
I will never betray my own people.

552
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:55,220
You already have.

553
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:57,800
This was taken
in the deepest trench on earth.

554
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:00,460
He must be an atlantean.

555
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:01,750
A water-breather.

556
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:03,740
He was breathing air
when I talked to him.

557
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,550
Mixed-blood, then.

558
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,590
He said he'll fight with us?

559
01:16:07,770 --> 01:16:09,100
More or less.

560
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,560
More more or more less?

561
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:13,980
Probably more less.

562
01:16:14,150 --> 01:16:15,930
- He said no?
- He said no.

563
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,110
Atlanteans can be tricky.

564
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:21,770
My people went to war with them once.

565
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:24,990
I'm not sure we can trust him.

566
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:26,340
Diana, if we're gonna do this,

567
01:16:26,370 --> 01:16:27,470
you're gonna need to be open

568
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:28,760
to more things that we didn't...

569
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:29,790
You know...

570
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:31,630
- I'm sorry. That's okay.
- Sorry. My fault.

571
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:32,930
Don't worry about it.

572
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,240
- Let's...
- I1t happens.

573
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:35,440
So...

574
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:37,450
This is the third person.

575
01:16:37,630 --> 01:16:40,040
Disappears for 1/30 of a second here.

576
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:41,710
One frame of video, see?

577
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:44,500
Barry Allen. Central city.

578
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,600
Go to him.

579
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,390
I'll work on number four.

580
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:50,670
Organic and biomechatronic body parts.

581
01:16:53,230 --> 01:16:55,220
He's a cyborg.

582
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,330
- Ready!
- Break!

583
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:32,850
Three...

584
01:17:33,230 --> 01:17:34,760
Eighty...

585
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,940
Set... go!

586
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,440
Your son may be captain
of the football team

587
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:56,610
and a certified genius, Mrs. stone...

588
01:17:56,790 --> 01:17:58,870
Dr. stone.

589
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:03,460
But that doesn't mean
he can hack into our system

590
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:05,420
to change his friend's grades.

591
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:09,720
Sarah's family
lost their house this year.

592
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:12,720
How could that child pass her classes?

593
01:18:14,310 --> 01:18:17,350
Victor helped her
'cause he's got a good heart.

594
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,560
What did you do to help her?

595
01:19:43,690 --> 01:19:46,600
- Your father...
- Mom, mom, don't.

596
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,940
He got held up at the lab.

597
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:54,150
Okay. He always does.

598
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:57,750
He wanted to be here.

599
01:19:58,290 --> 01:19:59,900
You always say that.

600
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:02,010
Ma, you gotta stop
making excuses for him.

601
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:05,080
You're just as busy as he is,
but you still make the time.

602
01:20:05,170 --> 01:20:08,210
He just has difficulty
showing it, but...

603
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,710
I know he's proud of you.

604
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:13,220
We both are, Victor.

605
01:20:13,890 --> 01:20:16,050
Hey, hey, hey.

606
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:20,310
With everything I know you can do today,

607
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,220
I can't wait to see
what you're gonna be tomorrow.

608
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:30,280
Dr. stone, I'm sorry,

609
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,150
your wife didn't survive.

610
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,910
I'm afraid your son won't either.

611
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:52,750
I won't let you die.

612
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:57,260
I won't allow it.

613
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:05,300
I won't allow it.

614
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:09,780
Victor.

615
01:21:11,150 --> 01:21:13,900
Victor, you're not stuck in here.

616
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:17,480
You still have a life ahead of you.

617
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:21,530
Your mother would have
wanted you to live that life.

618
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,620
If you were there,

619
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,870
mom would still be alive.

620
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,630
All right, look,

621
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:37,420
you don't have to give me
a second chance,

622
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:39,050
but give yourself one.

623
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:44,140
If you can't stand looking at me,

624
01:21:45,850 --> 01:21:47,470
try listening.

625
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:18,210
What you can do now, Victor.

626
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:22,590
Your physical strength
is just the tip of the iceberg.

627
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:25,300
The tip of the tip.

628
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:57,500
In the world of ones and zeroes,

629
01:22:57,590 --> 01:23:00,260
you are the absolute master.

630
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:03,010
No firewall can stop you.

631
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:05,470
No encryption can defy you.

632
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:08,380
We're all at your mercy, Vic.

633
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,930
From our power grids
to our telecommunications,

634
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:13,140
everyone's lives are controlled

635
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:16,280
and dominated
by complex digital networks

636
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:20,530
that will bend
without effort to your will.

637
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,490
The fate of the world

638
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:35,370
will literally rest in your hands.

639
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:45,340
Its entire nuclear arsenal,

640
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:48,220
you could launch with a thought.

641
01:23:59,030 --> 01:24:00,520
The world's monetary systems

642
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:02,200
and its complex interactions

643
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:05,150
will seem as easy
fo manipulate for you

644
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,830
as a child's plaything.

645
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:44,610
The question... no, the challenge

646
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:47,950
won't be doing it.

647
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:50,690
It will be not doing.

648
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:52,860
Not seeing.

649
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:57,200
It is the burden of this responsibility

650
01:24:57,380 --> 01:25:00,670
that will define you
and who you choose to be.

651
01:25:32,290 --> 01:25:33,370
Now, make a wish.

652
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:35,660
One more time.

653
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:38,990
Good job. Wave to grandma!

654
01:25:39,170 --> 01:25:40,330
Hi. Grandma!

655
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:41,730
What?

656
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:45,350
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

657
01:26:46,610 --> 01:26:47,980
Oh, my god.

658
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:49,900
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!

659
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:56,610
Victor...

660
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:01,620
Victor, these are the words
and deductions of a scientist.

661
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,960
That's how I've been speaking to you.

662
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:06,670
Now,

663
01:27:09,050 --> 01:27:11,030
let me speak to you from my heart,

664
01:27:11,050 --> 01:27:12,720
not as a scientist,

665
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:14,470
as a father.

666
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:29,940
Hey.

667
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:32,740
Hey, you!

668
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:51,550
Because you are
holding yourself back.

669
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:55,260
You're going in circles, man.

670
01:27:55,430 --> 01:27:57,590
Holding down three dead-end jobs,

671
01:27:57,770 --> 01:27:58,770
going on four.

672
01:27:58,850 --> 01:28:00,390
Where do you even find the time?

673
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:01,680
I make the time.

674
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:03,120
- I just need one more gig...
- Barry.

675
01:28:03,150 --> 01:28:04,250
Then I'm gonna pay
for my own tuition.

676
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:05,270
You can't.

677
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:06,540
Like I always said I would.

678
01:28:06,570 --> 01:28:07,800
You cannot keep doing this to yourself.

679
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:09,630
Okay. I really don't wanna
talk about this again.

680
01:28:09,650 --> 01:28:11,590
- Please, we have 10 minutes.
- And this is all to pay

681
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:12,760
for a criminal justice degree, huh?

682
01:28:12,780 --> 01:28:13,780
Yeanh.

683
01:28:13,950 --> 01:28:14,950
For what?

684
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:18,330
Huh, let's see.
As I talk to my father,

685
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,030
who's still in prison for the murder

686
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:21,430
of my mother, which he didn't commit.

687
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:23,460
Yeah, how did I get interested
in criminal justice?

688
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:25,120
I can't remember.

689
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,300
Oh, boy.

690
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:28,920
This path has clearly chosen me, dad.

691
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:31,010
Give me your hand, man.

692
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:39,850
I want you
to listen to me, Barry.

693
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:43,510
I want you to listen to me,
because I mean this.

694
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:51,350
I want you to give all that up.

695
01:28:54,370 --> 01:28:57,400
And I want you to stop coming to see me.

696
01:28:59,790 --> 01:29:02,780
I am a drag on your life.

697
01:29:08,210 --> 01:29:09,330
Okay. Um...

698
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:13,370
Please don't ever say that to me again.

699
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,040
Please.

700
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:18,340
Hey, you know what criminal justice
would be for me?

701
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:23,310
My son not wasting his life.

702
01:29:24,730 --> 01:29:26,470
You can be whatever you wanna be.

703
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:27,900
You're brilliant, man.

704
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:33,230
Absolute best of the best.

705
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:39,780
I can't sit here and watch you
run in place in central city

706
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:41,690
for some old dude

707
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:45,040
who's not going anywhere.

708
01:29:45,210 --> 01:29:46,690
- Dad, that's not true.
- It's time.

709
01:29:46,710 --> 01:29:47,710
That's not true.

710
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:49,400
Let's go, Allen. Allen!

711
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:51,210
I want you to make your own future.

712
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:53,190
You're living in the past.
Make your own future.

713
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:54,710
Open gate.

714
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:55,840
Great.

715
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:02,260
"You're living in the past.
Make your own future, Barry."

716
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:03,850
Clear. Close the gate.

717
01:30:56,530 --> 01:30:59,190
Barry Allen. Bruce Wayne.

718
01:31:00,030 --> 01:31:01,690
You said that like it explains

719
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:03,990
why there's a total stranger in my place

720
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:06,950
sitting in the dark,
in my second favorite chair.

721
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,830
Tell me about this.

722
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:17,670
This is a person
who looks exactly like me,

723
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,550
but who is definitely not me.

724
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:23,550
Somebody... I don't know.

725
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:25,550
Hippie, long hair.

726
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:28,470
Very attractive Jewish boy.

727
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:31,980
Who drinks milk, I don't drink milk.

728
01:31:32,770 --> 01:31:34,310
I know you have abilities.

729
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:36,320
I just don't know what they are.

730
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:37,820
My special skills

731
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:40,650
include viola, web design,

732
01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:43,610
fluent in sign language,
gorilla sign language.

733
01:31:43,790 --> 01:31:47,120
Silica-based sand quartz fabric.

734
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:49,620
Abrasion resistant, heat resistant.

735
01:31:49,790 --> 01:31:51,660
Uh, yeah, I do competitive ice dancing.

736
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,700
It's what they use on the space shuttle

737
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,440
to prevent it from burning up
on re-entry.

738
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:58,080
I do very competitive ice dancing.

739
01:31:59,470 --> 01:32:01,460
Look, man.
I don't know who you are,

740
01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:03,540
but whoever you're looking for,

741
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:04,720
it's not me.

742
01:32:04,850 --> 01:32:06,300
Uh...

743
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,140
You're the Batman?

744
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:50,300
So, you're fast.

745
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,140
That feels like an oversimplification.

746
01:32:53,310 --> 01:32:55,050
I'm putting together a team.

747
01:32:55,230 --> 01:32:57,310
People with special abilities.

748
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:58,970
You see,
I believe enemies are coming.

749
01:32:59,150 --> 01:33:01,230
Stop right there. I'm in.

750
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:03,360
You are?

751
01:33:03,740 --> 01:33:04,780
Just like that?

752
01:33:04,950 --> 01:33:06,060
Yeah.

753
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:10,120
I need friends.

754
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:13,580
Great. Great.

755
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:15,870
Can I keep this?

756
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:18,330
It's like this layer
of dimensional reality,

757
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:20,080
and it seems to manipulate space-time.

758
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:21,460
I call it the speed force.

759
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:23,550
Causes me to burn a tremendous
amount of calories

760
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:26,250
so I am just a black hole of snacks.

761
01:33:26,430 --> 01:33:28,260
I am a snack hole.

762
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:31,970
How many people are
on this special fight team?

763
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:34,050
- Three, including you.
- Three?

764
01:33:34,230 --> 01:33:36,090
Against what?

765
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:38,440
I'll tell you on the plane.

766
01:33:39,070 --> 01:33:40,270
Plane?

767
01:33:40,940 --> 01:33:42,680
What are your superpowers again?

768
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:44,570
I'm rich.

769
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:09,470
Oh, miss prince, let me do that.

770
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:11,630
No, that's okay.
I can do it myself.

771
01:34:12,770 --> 01:34:14,300
Would you like to have some?

772
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:15,760
Uh, no, thank you.

773
01:34:17,150 --> 01:34:19,140
If you put the water in first.

774
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:22,850
- Of course.
- So we don't scald the tea.

775
01:34:25,780 --> 01:34:27,320
- Yes.
- Great.

776
01:34:27,490 --> 01:34:29,450
No, that's probably enough tea.

777
01:34:29,620 --> 01:34:30,980
All right.

778
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:33,640
Are you sure you don't
wanna have some?

779
01:34:33,790 --> 01:34:37,030
I won't, thank you.
And then leave it to mash.

780
01:34:37,790 --> 01:34:40,580
I will. I will, definitely will.

781
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:43,090
Uh... what are you working on?

782
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:44,590
It's a gauntlet

783
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:48,790
lined with specialized
polymer solar cells.

784
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:51,180
- Wow.
- Here, let me show you.

785
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:54,670
We borrowed this
from the Kryptonian scout ship.

786
01:34:56,270 --> 01:34:57,680
Oh, maybe you should, uh...

787
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:00,350
- A fraction. Thank you, thank you.
- Of course.

788
01:35:05,490 --> 01:35:07,270
Ah.

789
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:10,360
Ah, now, let's see how that did.

790
01:35:10,530 --> 01:35:12,270
Ha! Yes.

791
01:35:12,950 --> 01:35:14,570
Not to be sneezed at.

792
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:17,160
A gauntlet that captures
and dissipates energy.

793
01:35:17,330 --> 01:35:18,820
It's master Wayne's idea.

794
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:21,370
Maybe you should work on a lasso, too?

795
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:24,160
- In black, of course.
- Oh.

796
01:35:31,140 --> 01:35:34,100
All right. Victor stone.

797
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:52,360
Something is not working.

798
01:35:52,830 --> 01:35:54,440
Mmm.

799
01:36:04,170 --> 01:36:06,580
Looks like you have a date, miss prince.

800
01:37:03,650 --> 01:37:06,730
Why are you looking for me, Diana?

801
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:08,140
You know who I am.

802
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:10,650
I know more than
you can possibly imagine.

803
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:13,400
Then maybe you already know
I need your help.

804
01:37:14,070 --> 01:37:15,070
The world does.

805
01:37:16,450 --> 01:37:18,160
Fuck the world.

806
01:37:19,790 --> 01:37:22,150
You've obviously
been through a great deal.

807
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:25,910
I can't begin to imagine what.

808
01:37:26,630 --> 01:37:29,990
But whatever happened to you,
you have gifts now.

809
01:37:30,260 --> 01:37:31,960
Gifts?

810
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:34,290
What part of this
looks like a gift to you?

811
01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:35,630
We need you, Victor.

812
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:37,890
And maybe you need us.

813
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:39,720
I don't need anyone.

814
01:37:41,930 --> 01:37:42,970
Not anymore.

815
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:45,640
I told myself the same for a long time.

816
01:37:52,490 --> 01:37:55,190
I lost someone I loved once.

817
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:02,870
I shut myself off from everyone.

818
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:07,210
But I had to learn
to open back up again.

819
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:13,330
The truth is, I'm still working on it.

820
01:38:13,510 --> 01:38:16,720
And if you asked to meet me...

821
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:20,340
You're working on it, too.

822
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:34,040
You were right about the metal sample

823
01:39:34,130 --> 01:39:35,710
from the Superman ship.

824
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:39,000
When we bombard it with x-rays
from the electron-laser,

825
01:39:39,430 --> 01:39:40,880
look what happens.

826
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:51,810
3.5 million Kelvin.

827
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:54,940
The inner core of the metal
becomes superheated.

828
01:39:55,110 --> 01:39:57,440
Hot, dense matter.

829
01:40:00,740 --> 01:40:03,530
You're looking at
the hottest thing on earth.

830
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:05,610
Exact words I said to my prom date.

831
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,530
She dumped me anyway.

832
01:40:07,660 --> 01:40:08,900
Yeanh.

833
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:14,090
Hey, doc,

834
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:16,120
do you think Batman is connected

835
01:40:16,210 --> 01:40:18,710
to the object the cid is looking for?

836
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:22,880
You know, 6-1-9-8-2?

837
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:25,140
No...

838
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:27,350
I don't.

839
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:04,260
Oh, Victor.

840
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:23,320
All right! Let's go!

841
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:25,930
Commissioner Gordon?

842
01:41:25,950 --> 01:41:27,110
Come on!

843
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:28,410
Your messages.

844
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:29,650
Hey, hey!

845
01:41:32,830 --> 01:41:35,410
Don't have to see the sky
to know it's a full moon.

846
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:38,420
Half of Gotham's
reality-challenged community showed up.

847
01:41:38,590 --> 01:41:40,750
Say they saw flying monsters
by the harbor.

848
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:42,960
You were right, ma. Police academy.

849
01:41:43,050 --> 01:41:44,670
What's wrong with dental school?

850
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:50,050
"Attacked by a flying vampire.”

851
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:54,020
"Looked like a giant bat
with huge fangs."

852
01:41:54,190 --> 01:41:55,970
On a possibly related note,

853
01:41:56,150 --> 01:41:58,480
sketch of the suspect in the abductions

854
01:41:58,570 --> 01:41:59,730
at the lab across the harbor.

855
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:02,440
- Looks like...
- I know what it looks like, crispus.

856
01:42:03,650 --> 01:42:06,110
Come on, you think he fights
criminals for 20 years here

857
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:08,940
and then he goes to Metropolis
and kidnaps eight people?

858
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:11,070
I'll talk to him tonight.

859
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:14,410
How do you think?

860
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:33,890
Silas?

861
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:35,350
Hey, hey.

862
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:36,850
Hey, hey!

863
01:42:41,650 --> 01:42:43,850
- Oh, my goodness.
- Where's the cyborg?

864
01:42:43,990 --> 01:42:45,150
His name is Victor.

865
01:42:45,950 --> 01:42:48,690
We met, spoke.

866
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:51,070
Give him time.

867
01:42:51,870 --> 01:42:53,830
You must be Barry. I'm Diana.

868
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,740
Hi, Barry. I'm Diana.
That's not right. Great.

869
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:00,030
- So, this is us.
- Yeah, this is us.

870
01:43:00,210 --> 01:43:01,250
Oh!

871
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:04,420
Awesome! It's the bat-signal.
That's your...

872
01:43:04,590 --> 01:43:06,670
Oh, sorry. That's your signal.

873
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:08,050
That means we have to go now.

874
01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:12,010
- Yeah, that's what that means.
- It's so cool.

875
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:11,100
Commander mera, I told the king

876
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:12,810
the perimeter guards were taken.

877
01:44:13,030 --> 01:44:14,570
He won't send reinforcements.

878
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:17,360
He says all the reserves are needed
in the rebel regions.

879
01:44:17,540 --> 01:44:21,280
He's as shortsighted
as he is cruel.

880
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:23,540
All right, take what men we have left

881
01:44:23,710 --> 01:44:25,450
and form a phalanx
around the mother box.

882
01:46:05,310 --> 01:46:07,350
You can't escape.

883
01:46:08,110 --> 01:46:10,060
I'm not trying to.

884
01:48:12,650 --> 01:48:14,510
Vulko told me you would come.

885
01:48:15,030 --> 01:48:17,730
The firstborn of beloved queen atlanna.

886
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:21,650
Wait.

887
01:48:23,660 --> 01:48:24,740
Please.

888
01:48:28,330 --> 01:48:29,660
I knew her.

889
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:33,540
Well, that makes one of us.

890
01:48:34,420 --> 01:48:36,000
My parents died in the wars.

891
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:39,130
She took me in.

892
01:48:39,510 --> 01:48:40,750
What a Saint.

893
01:48:41,470 --> 01:48:43,580
You dare speak of
queen atlanna that way?

894
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:46,380
Your queen left me
on my father's doorstep

895
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:48,140
and never gave me another thought.

896
01:48:48,310 --> 01:48:50,520
Your mother left you to save your life.

897
01:48:51,650 --> 01:48:54,100
You cannot imagine how it hurt her.

898
01:48:55,690 --> 01:48:57,730
What it cost her.

899
01:48:58,990 --> 01:49:01,150
But you're not a defenseless child now.

900
01:49:03,570 --> 01:49:05,160
It would have been her responsibility

901
01:49:05,330 --> 01:49:08,490
to follow that monster
to the surface and stop him.

902
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:10,160
Now,

903
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:12,790
it's yours.

904
01:50:17,150 --> 01:50:18,600
Yes.

905
01:50:41,550 --> 01:50:42,910
Steppenwolf,

906
01:50:43,090 --> 01:50:45,000
tell me what you've learned.

907
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:47,790
Two boxes found and awake.

908
01:50:47,970 --> 01:50:50,930
With the combined power
of the two mother boxes,

909
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:54,090
I've been able to finish
the stronghold's defenses.

910
01:50:54,270 --> 01:50:56,680
Where is the third mother box?

911
01:50:56,850 --> 01:51:00,970
The parademons sense its presence
and search for the third.

912
01:51:01,150 --> 01:51:04,390
They have taken prisoners
who carry its scent.

913
01:51:05,150 --> 01:51:06,190
Go.

914
01:51:07,030 --> 01:51:08,940
Interrogate the prisoners.

915
01:51:09,740 --> 01:51:11,610
Find the third.

916
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:15,320
They will tell me what they know,

917
01:51:16,580 --> 01:51:19,070
or I will rip it from them.

918
01:52:02,420 --> 01:52:04,000
How many of you are there?

919
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:05,950
Not enough.

920
01:52:08,050 --> 01:52:10,290
Dozens of witnesses
all over Gotham.

921
01:52:10,470 --> 01:52:13,180
Description matches the suspect
in the Metropolis abductions.

922
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:14,800
Parademons.

923
01:52:15,430 --> 01:52:16,670
Okay.

924
01:52:16,850 --> 01:52:19,180
The demons must have caught
the scent of a mother box.

925
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:20,440
At the lab.

926
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:22,940
They carried people away
to find out what they know.

927
01:52:23,110 --> 01:52:24,290
So the eight may still be alive.

928
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:25,320
Nine.

929
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:26,640
Oh.

930
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:29,850
The head of starlabs was taken tonight.

931
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:37,610
Wow, okay. So, another scientist.

932
01:52:37,790 --> 01:52:39,070
So, how do we find him?

933
01:52:39,250 --> 01:52:40,910
There must be a nest nearby.

934
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:45,170
I plotted all the sightings
in Metropolis, Gotham.

935
01:52:45,340 --> 01:52:47,450
No discernable pattern I can see.

936
01:52:47,630 --> 01:52:49,070
The lines on the map don't converge.

937
01:52:49,090 --> 01:52:50,420
On land.

938
01:52:50,630 --> 01:52:52,070
These lead back to stryker's island,

939
01:52:52,090 --> 01:52:53,170
between the two cities.

940
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:55,760
These are air vents.
They all lead down to the tunnel

941
01:52:55,930 --> 01:52:58,300
to a Metropolis project
that was abandoned in '29.

942
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:00,060
The nest could be there.

943
01:53:00,850 --> 01:53:02,760
Uh, is he coming with us now,

944
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:04,660
because we're not all
gonna fit in your car.

945
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:06,230
I have something bigger.

946
01:53:07,570 --> 01:53:09,180
Do you really think that...

947
01:53:10,530 --> 01:53:14,070
Oh, wow, they just...
They really just vanish, huh?

948
01:53:14,160 --> 01:53:16,610
Oh. That's rude.

949
01:53:55,320 --> 01:53:57,410
We're close.

950
01:53:57,580 --> 01:53:59,570
The scent of the enemy.

951
01:54:00,290 --> 01:54:01,450
Of absence.

952
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:03,580
Darkness.

953
01:54:04,290 --> 01:54:05,290
Death.

954
01:54:05,710 --> 01:54:06,790
Where are we, Alfred?

955
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:08,100
Stryker's island.

956
01:54:08,130 --> 01:54:10,370
You should be directly under

957
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:12,670
the venting tower for the tunnel.

958
01:54:13,260 --> 01:54:14,460
Now look to your left,

959
01:54:14,550 --> 01:54:16,670
you'll see a staircase
to the machine room.

960
01:54:16,890 --> 01:54:19,420
Thermal scan shows
a cluster of people there.

961
01:54:19,510 --> 01:54:20,510
That's it.

962
01:54:20,890 --> 01:54:21,890
Let's go.

963
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:38,810
Right.
Is there... is there a plan?

964
01:54:40,370 --> 01:54:41,650
Either of you?

965
01:54:41,830 --> 01:54:43,190
Don't engage alone.

966
01:54:43,790 --> 01:54:45,030
We do this together.

967
01:54:54,010 --> 01:54:55,840
I heard about you.

968
01:54:57,640 --> 01:54:58,800
Didn't think you were real.

969
01:54:59,260 --> 01:55:00,800
I'm real when it's useful.

970
01:55:11,070 --> 01:55:12,900
I grow tired of your silence.

971
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:15,190
Now tell me, where is the mother box?

972
01:55:21,990 --> 01:55:24,200
Please. We have families.

973
01:55:24,370 --> 01:55:26,450
Then you have weakness.

974
01:55:26,620 --> 01:55:28,080
Steppenwolf.

975
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:32,410
Okay, I'm guessing that's the bad guy.

976
01:55:32,590 --> 01:55:33,620
Good guess.

977
01:55:34,170 --> 01:55:37,630
I'm really, really missing Superman
right now.

978
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:39,960
Circle to the other side.

979
01:55:40,140 --> 01:55:42,130
We'll surround them and surprise him.

980
01:55:46,690 --> 01:55:48,270
You have been near a mother box.

981
01:55:48,730 --> 01:55:50,430
The scent is on you.

982
01:55:50,610 --> 01:55:52,170
I don't know what you're talking about.

983
01:55:52,230 --> 01:55:54,060
- Where is it?
- Leave him alone!

984
01:55:54,230 --> 01:55:56,480
He... he doesn't know.

985
01:56:00,070 --> 01:56:01,860
Wait, please, please!

986
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:10,160
You carry
the scent, too. But stronger.

987
01:56:10,540 --> 01:56:12,660
I will die before I tell you.

988
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:14,670
You'll die if you don't.

989
01:56:15,090 --> 01:56:16,090
Nol

990
01:56:25,430 --> 01:56:26,470
Victor.

991
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:27,930
Kill them both.

992
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:33,560
Ah, Amazon.

993
01:56:33,980 --> 01:56:36,470
But not like your sisters.

994
01:56:36,650 --> 01:56:37,890
Stronger.

995
01:57:08,850 --> 01:57:11,060
Amazon.

996
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:14,890
Hold!

997
01:57:15,270 --> 01:57:17,480
This one will be mine.

998
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:21,860
I belong to no one.

999
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:37,910
Guys, this is not together.

1000
01:57:44,930 --> 01:57:46,240
Help get those people out of here.

1001
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:48,350
I'll make sure these things
follow me.

1002
01:57:58,360 --> 01:57:59,770
Everybody, move!

1003
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:10,030
A little quicker.

1004
01:58:12,410 --> 01:58:13,780
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

1005
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:16,370
I've got this. Keep moving.

1006
01:58:18,380 --> 01:58:19,380
This way.

1007
01:58:55,750 --> 01:58:57,160
The energy is dissipating.

1008
01:58:57,330 --> 01:58:58,820
My gauntlet worked!

1009
01:59:00,090 --> 01:59:02,370
Celebrate later, Alfred.
I need the nightcrawler.

1010
01:59:02,550 --> 01:59:04,160
Thought you'd never ask.

1011
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:06,590
Crawler's on the way.
Initiating remote mode.

1012
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:38,040
Thank you, Alfred.

1013
01:59:38,210 --> 01:59:39,570
Don't mention it.

1014
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:03,320
Nol

1015
02:00:06,990 --> 02:00:07,990
whew.

1016
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:12,800
They're safe. Get back to the tunnel.

1017
02:00:12,950 --> 02:00:16,030
Tunnel. Right.
Aliens, bad guy, sword lady.

1018
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:29,210
My turn.

1019
02:01:51,590 --> 02:01:53,240
Catastrophic failure
of all systems.

1020
02:01:53,260 --> 02:01:55,670
Are you all right, master Wayne?

1021
02:01:55,850 --> 02:01:56,850
Are you all right?

1022
02:02:07,570 --> 02:02:11,060
You have the blood
of the old gods in you.

1023
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:26,380
You okay?

1024
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:28,290
Mm.

1025
02:02:28,380 --> 02:02:29,990
Wasn't sure you'd come.

1026
02:02:31,050 --> 02:02:32,330
You're my father.

1027
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:36,840
Go.

1028
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:51,480
Nol

1029
02:03:36,990 --> 02:03:39,320
Relax, Alfred.
I'll take it from here.

1030
02:03:40,910 --> 02:03:42,740
Uh, do I know you?

1031
02:04:13,650 --> 02:04:14,890
What are we under, right now?

1032
02:04:15,650 --> 02:04:16,940
Gotham harbor.

1033
02:04:55,650 --> 02:04:56,940
Who is that?

1034
02:05:22,260 --> 02:05:23,420
Come on.

1035
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:29,760
Diana, get on!

1036
02:06:31,660 --> 02:06:33,150
What is it?

1037
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:42,370
Show me.

1038
02:07:21,550 --> 02:07:23,160
It is here.

1039
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:26,880
On this world.

1040
02:08:00,790 --> 02:08:03,750
Sir, you're gonna be in quarantine
for possible alien microbes.

1041
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:05,580
U.S. government protocols
require that...

1042
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:08,540
I know the requirements. I wrote them.

1043
02:08:13,100 --> 02:08:14,430
It called to him.

1044
02:08:14,600 --> 02:08:16,140
The mother box.

1045
02:08:16,310 --> 02:08:17,670
The one he already has.

1046
02:08:18,020 --> 02:08:21,060
He has two.
He took the mother box from Atlantis.

1047
02:08:21,230 --> 02:08:23,520
All he needs now is the lost box of men.

1048
02:08:23,690 --> 02:08:24,890
If he doesn't already have it.

1049
02:08:28,530 --> 02:08:29,940
He doesn't have it.

1050
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:34,320
I do.

1051
02:08:44,880 --> 02:08:46,960
Have you finished the conquest?

1052
02:08:47,130 --> 02:08:48,370
Not yet, desaad.

1053
02:08:48,550 --> 02:08:50,790
Then why do you summon me?

1054
02:08:50,970 --> 02:08:52,630
I bring news.

1055
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:55,720
Before mighty darkseid
came to the throne,

1056
02:08:55,890 --> 02:09:00,380
he searched the universe
for the ultimate weapon.

1057
02:09:01,020 --> 02:09:03,180
The anti-life equation.

1058
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:05,440
The key to controlling all life

1059
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:08,020
and all will throughout the multiverse.

1060
02:09:08,190 --> 02:09:10,190
He found it hidden
on a primitive planet,

1061
02:09:10,280 --> 02:09:11,280
but before...

1062
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:14,230
The story of the defiance is well-known.

1063
02:09:14,410 --> 02:09:16,900
I have found the primitive planet.

1064
02:09:17,080 --> 02:09:19,110
The world that fought back.

1065
02:09:19,290 --> 02:09:21,150
It 1s earth.

1066
02:09:21,330 --> 02:09:23,540
The anti-life equation is carved

1067
02:09:23,710 --> 02:09:27,580
into the surface of this very world.

1068
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:32,670
Are you certain?

1069
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:33,880
I have seen it.

1070
02:09:34,050 --> 02:09:37,420
I have looked with my own eyes.

1071
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:40,120
Anti-life.

1072
02:10:20,810 --> 02:10:22,390
My lord.

1073
02:10:23,940 --> 02:10:27,470
Oh, steppenwolf.

1074
02:10:28,150 --> 02:10:31,230
My lord,
I am but your humble servant.

1075
02:10:32,240 --> 02:10:35,070
Can it be true that you have found it?

1076
02:10:35,240 --> 02:10:37,400
I have, great one.

1077
02:10:38,160 --> 02:10:41,120
The lost world is earth.

1078
02:10:41,290 --> 02:10:44,280
Anti-life 1s here.

1079
02:10:45,620 --> 02:10:48,960
If it is redemption you seek,
find the third box,

1080
02:10:49,130 --> 02:10:52,090
synchronize the unity,
and when this world is scorched,

1081
02:10:52,260 --> 02:10:55,460
I will come for my great prize.

1082
02:10:56,430 --> 02:10:58,630
You will come to earth?

1083
02:10:59,680 --> 02:11:03,920
I have turned 100,000 worlds to dust

1084
02:11:04,100 --> 02:11:05,590
looking for anti-life.

1085
02:11:05,770 --> 02:11:08,980
Looking for those
who robbed me of my glory.

1086
02:11:09,150 --> 02:11:12,390
I will stride across their bones

1087
02:11:12,490 --> 02:11:14,900
and bask in the glow of anti-life.

1088
02:11:15,070 --> 02:11:17,780
And all of existence

1089
02:11:17,950 --> 02:11:21,410
shall be mine.

1090
02:11:24,830 --> 02:11:28,740
It shall be so, my master.

1091
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:34,620
So cool.

1092
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:35,720
From the outside,

1093
02:11:35,800 --> 02:11:37,440
it looks like this building
was abandoned.

1094
02:11:41,100 --> 02:11:42,840
It wants to fly.

1095
02:11:44,060 --> 02:11:45,920
You talk to machines?

1096
02:11:46,230 --> 02:11:48,220
I speak to intelligence.

1097
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:51,260
This one's saying she can't fly
because of a software issue,

1098
02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:53,400
but I could fix it with a little time.

1099
02:12:03,160 --> 02:12:05,370
There's a dark spot in my data stream.

1100
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:07,950
I could feel the other two boxes.

1101
02:12:08,120 --> 02:12:09,960
I know they're awake,

1102
02:12:10,130 --> 02:12:11,620
but I can't see where they are.

1103
02:12:11,790 --> 02:12:13,940
Well, we can't attack unless
we know where the base is.

1104
02:12:13,960 --> 02:12:16,200
Even if we knew,

1105
02:12:16,380 --> 02:12:19,220
I've never seen a being
as strong as steppenwolf.

1106
02:12:21,430 --> 02:12:22,760
Maybe one.

1107
02:12:22,850 --> 02:12:24,550
Hmm, Superman.

1108
02:12:25,470 --> 02:12:27,190
As long
as the third box is asleep,

1109
02:12:27,230 --> 02:12:29,510
they can't see it, only sense it.

1110
02:12:29,690 --> 02:12:31,720
We need to keep moving
so they can't catch up.

1111
02:12:31,900 --> 02:12:35,060
No. That's just a strategy
to lose more slowly, not to win.

1112
02:12:35,690 --> 02:12:37,680
Remind me,
are flamethrowers not a thing?

1113
02:12:38,570 --> 02:12:39,730
Why don't we just destroy it?

1114
02:12:39,820 --> 02:12:41,900
Fire doesn't destroy the boxes.

1115
02:12:42,070 --> 02:12:43,780
They're an unknown form of matter.

1116
02:12:43,870 --> 02:12:45,150
Oh, they love heat.

1117
02:12:45,240 --> 02:12:47,450
They absorb it, hold it in their cores.

1118
02:12:47,620 --> 02:12:49,740
Well, you know a lot about these boxes.

1119
02:12:50,330 --> 02:12:51,570
Makes you think.

1120
02:12:51,750 --> 02:12:53,460
Where'd you find the box, Victor?

1121
02:12:54,420 --> 02:12:55,830
Are you trying to say something?

1122
02:12:56,130 --> 02:12:57,620
Oh, I'm saying it.

1123
02:12:58,220 --> 02:13:00,080
How do we know
you're not working for them?

1124
02:13:01,970 --> 02:13:03,630
It's a long story.

1125
02:13:04,100 --> 02:13:06,010
You got somewhere else to be?

1126
02:13:13,400 --> 02:13:17,230
The Nazis found the box
at the end of the second world war,

1127
02:13:17,400 --> 02:13:20,440
buried under an Italian monastery.

1128
02:13:20,610 --> 02:13:22,980
The allies intercepted it
on its way to Hitler.

1129
02:13:23,160 --> 02:13:25,360
They brought it back
to the states in '44.

1130
02:13:25,950 --> 02:13:29,490
Unknown object 6-1-9-8-2.

1131
02:13:30,370 --> 02:13:33,830
It collected dust
in the Pentagon archives for 70 years

1132
02:13:34,380 --> 02:13:37,580
till dod began to study
the Superman ship.

1133
02:13:39,130 --> 02:13:41,540
A researcher at starlabs
made a connection

1134
02:13:41,630 --> 02:13:42,630
between the ship...

1135
02:13:43,930 --> 02:13:45,460
And 6-1-9-8-2.

1136
02:13:46,350 --> 02:13:49,180
He understood
they were both alien technologies.

1137
02:13:49,850 --> 02:13:51,430
Different civilizations,

1138
02:13:52,020 --> 02:13:54,140
similar properties.

1139
02:13:55,480 --> 02:13:58,220
And though the box had slept
for thousands of years,

1140
02:13:58,900 --> 02:14:01,730
the researcher formulated
a theory on how to awaken it.

1141
02:14:02,360 --> 02:14:04,100
And so did.

1142
02:14:06,410 --> 02:14:07,410
Then...

1143
02:14:09,540 --> 02:14:11,450
I had an accident
that should've killed me.

1144
02:14:12,790 --> 02:14:16,000
But in an act of desperation
or madness,

1145
02:14:16,170 --> 02:14:18,500
the researcher harnessed
the power of the mother box.

1146
02:14:34,690 --> 02:14:36,770
He unleashed an alien technology

1147
02:14:36,940 --> 02:14:39,600
he didn't fully understand.

1148
02:14:39,780 --> 02:14:42,140
He used that power to keep me alive.

1149
02:14:45,740 --> 02:14:47,320
A life...

1150
02:14:47,870 --> 02:14:49,820
That turned into this.

1151
02:14:52,620 --> 02:14:54,910
The box went back to sleep

1152
02:14:55,830 --> 02:14:57,490
and he never returned it.

1153
02:15:00,130 --> 02:15:02,170
That researcher was Silas stone.

1154
02:15:03,880 --> 02:15:05,540
My father.

1155
02:15:08,850 --> 02:15:10,510
Wait,

1156
02:15:10,680 --> 02:15:14,050
your father saved your life
with one of these things?

1157
02:15:14,230 --> 02:15:16,430
Aren't they psycho murder machines?

1158
02:15:16,600 --> 02:15:18,970
They're change machines.

1159
02:15:19,150 --> 02:15:21,810
The boxes don't think
in terms of healing or killing,

1160
02:15:22,230 --> 02:15:24,320
alive or dead.

1161
02:15:24,490 --> 02:15:26,730
They rearrange matter
at the will of their masters,

1162
02:15:26,910 --> 02:15:28,490
regenerate, reinstate.

1163
02:15:28,660 --> 02:15:30,070
Reinstate?

1164
02:15:30,160 --> 02:15:31,220
A box has the power

1165
02:15:31,240 --> 02:15:33,660
to reinstate anterior
particle relationships.

1166
02:15:33,830 --> 02:15:35,710
So, you mean in the way
that particles of matter

1167
02:15:35,790 --> 02:15:37,000
can't be created or destroyed,

1168
02:15:37,080 --> 02:15:39,070
their relations just transform.

1169
02:15:39,250 --> 02:15:41,990
Burn down a house,
the particles still exist.

1170
02:15:42,170 --> 02:15:44,630
Particles of house
become particles of smoke.

1171
02:15:44,800 --> 02:15:48,840
Anybody with a match
can turn a house to smoke.

1172
02:15:50,890 --> 02:15:52,630
But a mother box...

1173
02:15:52,810 --> 02:15:55,010
Turns smoke back into a house.

1174
02:16:01,020 --> 02:16:03,510
I know we're all thinking
the same thing right now.

1175
02:16:04,990 --> 02:16:07,480
Who's gonna say it?
I'm not gonna say it.

1176
02:16:34,770 --> 02:16:35,850
Who is it?

1177
02:16:36,560 --> 02:16:37,760
Martha.

1178
02:16:42,480 --> 02:16:43,720
Hi

1179
02:16:45,610 --> 02:16:46,970
Hi.

1180
02:16:56,120 --> 02:16:57,660
I went to the daily planet

1181
02:16:57,750 --> 02:17:01,110
to finally pick up Clark's things.

1182
02:17:02,630 --> 02:17:05,910
I don't know why,
nowhere to put them now.

1183
02:17:08,720 --> 02:17:10,330
I lost the farm.

1184
02:17:11,970 --> 02:17:14,090
I'd been behind on the payments
for a while.

1185
02:17:15,470 --> 02:17:17,010
Truth is, the house is too big

1186
02:17:17,100 --> 02:17:19,340
for me to live in by myself anyway.

1187
02:17:19,890 --> 02:17:22,680
Well, you know you're welcome
to stay here any time

1188
02:17:22,860 --> 02:17:24,810
for as long as you need.

1189
02:17:26,020 --> 02:17:28,640
Thank you, Lois. That's very kind.

1190
02:17:30,320 --> 02:17:32,440
But I've found a little place
that suits me just fine,

1191
02:17:32,570 --> 02:17:34,030
right by the diner.

1192
02:17:34,660 --> 02:17:36,020
I'm not here for help.

1193
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:39,070
I'm here because

1194
02:17:39,910 --> 02:17:42,330
when I saw Mr. Perry, he told me that

1195
02:17:43,790 --> 02:17:46,700
you haven't been to work
since Clark died.

1196
02:17:51,510 --> 02:17:53,120
I can't.

1197
02:18:00,020 --> 02:18:02,350
The whole world is mourning.

1198
02:18:03,980 --> 02:18:06,390
Grieving over a symbol.

1199
02:18:06,570 --> 02:18:10,350
Everywhere I go, everywhere I l00k,
I see that "s."

1200
02:18:11,490 --> 02:18:13,480
I hear what people say.

1201
02:18:13,660 --> 02:18:15,490
They talk like they knew him.

1202
02:18:16,700 --> 02:18:18,940
But they didn't know Clark.

1203
02:18:20,500 --> 02:18:22,830
And I can't stop them

1204
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:24,360
and look at them and tell them

1205
02:18:24,540 --> 02:18:27,280
how proud I am of my son.

1206
02:18:29,300 --> 02:18:31,790
You're the only one who knows.

1207
02:18:31,970 --> 02:18:34,380
Who feels what I do.

1208
02:18:35,720 --> 02:18:38,680
Burdened by a secret on top of grief.

1209
02:18:41,850 --> 02:18:45,140
I came all this way because I wanted...

1210
02:18:45,310 --> 02:18:47,300
Because I wanted to see you.

1211
02:18:48,570 --> 02:18:50,520
Tell you...

1212
02:18:50,690 --> 02:18:52,520
I understand.

1213
02:18:56,820 --> 02:19:00,360
Will never love anybody
the way that I love your son.

1214
02:19:04,120 --> 02:19:06,110
And I just miss him.

1215
02:19:07,290 --> 02:19:09,500
I miss him so much.

1216
02:19:16,220 --> 02:19:17,880
So do I, sweetheart.

1217
02:19:22,470 --> 02:19:27,340
Martha, you know if there's
anything you need, I'm here.

1218
02:19:30,940 --> 02:19:33,520
There is something
you can do for me, honey.

1219
02:19:35,950 --> 02:19:38,190
Come back to the living.

1220
02:20:18,200 --> 02:20:21,030
The world needs you, too, Lois.

1221
02:20:24,830 --> 02:20:25,990
The dead are dead.

1222
02:20:26,330 --> 02:20:28,070
The box brought Victor back.

1223
02:20:28,250 --> 02:20:29,780
Victor wasn't dead.

1224
02:20:29,960 --> 02:20:31,700
Life is either one or zero.

1225
02:20:31,880 --> 02:20:34,790
It's to be or not to be. Not both.

1226
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:36,580
Can you operate this box, Victor?

1227
02:20:36,670 --> 02:20:37,670
Of course.

1228
02:20:38,090 --> 02:20:40,500
But we don't know enough
about Kryptonian biology.

1229
02:20:40,680 --> 02:20:42,510
There's no telling what's gonna happen.

1230
02:20:44,470 --> 02:20:45,960
Okay, but...

1231
02:20:46,140 --> 02:20:49,760
I mean, we have to try.
Don't we? We have to try.

1232
02:20:50,400 --> 02:20:51,480
What do we have to lose?

1233
02:20:51,650 --> 02:20:54,180
We cannot try
unless we activate the box.

1234
02:20:54,360 --> 02:20:55,810
As soon as it wakes up...

1235
02:20:58,530 --> 02:21:01,070
Activates the unity. The end.

1236
02:21:01,240 --> 02:21:03,610
So, what we have to lose
is the entire planet

1237
02:21:03,780 --> 02:21:05,820
to a bunch of genocidal aliens.
That's good to know.

1238
02:21:05,910 --> 02:21:08,400
Even if Superman could return,

1239
02:21:08,580 --> 02:21:10,450
who's to say that he could defeat them?

1240
02:21:10,620 --> 02:21:12,490
The mother box did.

1241
02:21:12,790 --> 02:21:16,130
Victor's father activated a mother box
more than a year ago.

1242
02:21:16,210 --> 02:21:17,950
When Superman was still alive.

1243
02:21:18,130 --> 02:21:20,000
Didn't call out to steppenwolf.

1244
02:21:20,090 --> 02:21:21,550
None of the boxes did. Not until...

1245
02:21:21,720 --> 02:21:26,380
Not until Superman died.

1246
02:21:26,560 --> 02:21:28,510
It's like they were afraid of him?

1247
02:21:28,600 --> 02:21:31,470
Yes, they were afraid of him.

1248
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:36,180
This is the only way.

1249
02:21:37,860 --> 02:21:41,600
There are six, not five.
There is no us without him.

1250
02:22:11,140 --> 02:22:14,930
Exhume Superman from the grave. Check.

1251
02:22:16,980 --> 02:22:19,390
You know we could do this
in a nanosecond, right?

1252
02:22:20,110 --> 02:22:21,480
We could.

1253
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:30,650
He was my hero.

1254
02:22:33,290 --> 02:22:34,500
All right.

1255
02:22:38,130 --> 02:22:41,170
An Amazon working with an atlantean.

1256
02:22:41,340 --> 02:22:42,580
Half-atlantean.

1257
02:22:44,470 --> 02:22:47,210
How many thousands of years
since our people spoke?

1258
02:22:47,890 --> 02:22:50,760
I don't know.
I'm not exactly close to mine.

1259
02:22:51,980 --> 02:22:54,680
I hate atlanteans
as much as you Amazons do.

1260
02:22:54,850 --> 02:22:56,890
Hate is useless.

1261
02:23:00,030 --> 02:23:01,360
Yep.

1262
02:23:02,650 --> 02:23:04,230
No, thank you.

1263
02:23:08,780 --> 02:23:11,740
You know, my father told me
there's a saying in Atlantis...

1264
02:23:13,500 --> 02:23:15,700
"None are taken back from the darkness.

1265
02:23:15,790 --> 02:23:18,580
- "Not without..."
- "Not without giving one up in return."

1266
02:23:20,840 --> 02:23:22,420
We say the same thing.

1267
02:23:25,050 --> 02:23:26,380
How about that?

1268
02:23:26,890 --> 02:23:28,750
Wonder woman.

1269
02:23:30,140 --> 02:23:31,140
What do you think, man?

1270
02:23:31,220 --> 02:23:34,090
You think she'd ever go
for a younger guy?

1271
02:23:34,480 --> 02:23:37,060
She's 5,000 years old, Barry.

1272
02:23:38,940 --> 02:23:40,770
Every guy's a younger guy.

1273
02:23:42,780 --> 02:23:43,860
Jesus.

1274
02:23:45,360 --> 02:23:47,070
Oh, Christ.

1275
02:23:49,620 --> 02:23:52,030
Oh, bloody...

1276
02:23:53,410 --> 02:23:54,410
Any luck?

1277
02:23:54,580 --> 02:23:55,660
If by "luck" you mean

1278
02:23:55,830 --> 02:23:58,910
“chance in hell
we'll get it flying today,"

1279
02:23:59,080 --> 02:24:01,080
then, no. No luck.

1280
02:24:01,960 --> 02:24:03,500
It's okay.

1281
02:24:03,670 --> 02:24:05,530
It doesn't matter.
We're just gonna take the body

1282
02:24:05,550 --> 02:24:06,550
to the Kryptonian ship.

1283
02:24:06,630 --> 02:24:07,940
It's basically an organic computer.

1284
02:24:07,970 --> 02:24:09,960
It can talk directly to the mother box.

1285
02:24:10,140 --> 02:24:12,590
What? The way it talked to Lex Luthor?

1286
02:24:12,760 --> 02:24:13,880
Something like that.

1287
02:24:13,970 --> 02:24:17,810
Huh.
What could possibly go wrong?

1288
02:24:24,440 --> 02:24:25,930
Master Wayne...

1289
02:24:28,030 --> 02:24:29,240
You did it!

1290
02:24:29,610 --> 02:24:32,900
You put the team together
to fight this war.

1291
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:35,410
You've fulfilled your promise.

1292
02:24:36,500 --> 02:24:39,910
But to try to do that... I mean...

1293
02:24:40,540 --> 02:24:42,370
Your guilt's overcome your reason.

1294
02:24:43,590 --> 02:24:45,700
Not all the king's horses
nor all the king's men...

1295
02:24:45,880 --> 02:24:48,960
Alfred, for once,
I'm operating strictly on faith,

1296
02:24:49,130 --> 02:24:50,970
not on reason.

1297
02:24:51,760 --> 02:24:55,970
But if you start playing
with this little box of tricks,

1298
02:24:56,140 --> 02:24:58,220
I mean, it could be
the end of everything.

1299
02:24:58,390 --> 02:25:00,260
How do you know
your team's strong enough?

1300
02:25:01,520 --> 02:25:03,850
If you can't bring down
the charging bull,

1301
02:25:04,020 --> 02:25:05,730
then don't wave the red cape at it.

1302
02:25:05,900 --> 02:25:07,480
You do when it's this red cape.

1303
02:25:07,650 --> 02:25:09,810
This red cape charges back.

1304
02:25:24,540 --> 02:25:25,700
Okay.

1305
02:25:32,680 --> 02:25:35,040
You were right, Dr. stone.
The tests came back negative.

1306
02:25:35,220 --> 02:25:36,840
Everyone's clear, including you.

1307
02:25:37,020 --> 02:25:39,600
Just to be on the safe side,
we swept the entire facility.

1308
02:25:39,770 --> 02:25:41,500
Well, thank you, Thomas.
That means I'm free to go?

1309
02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:42,520
Absolutely.

1310
02:25:46,520 --> 02:25:47,810
- Thanks.
- Listen up, everyone.

1311
02:25:47,980 --> 02:25:50,440
You're all clear.
So, gather your things.

1312
02:25:50,610 --> 02:25:52,150
If you need more medical attention...

1313
02:25:52,320 --> 02:25:55,990
Arthur, yes, your opinion.
Less preposterous. Option "a"?

1314
02:25:56,160 --> 02:25:57,400
- Definitely not "a."
- Okay.

1315
02:25:57,580 --> 02:26:00,690
Or... "B"?

1316
02:26:02,330 --> 02:26:03,570
Let me see "a" again?

1317
02:26:09,210 --> 02:26:12,330
Right. We should get dressed.

1318
02:26:14,470 --> 02:26:16,430
I'm always dressed.

1319
02:26:43,580 --> 02:26:44,580
ID?

1320
02:26:44,830 --> 02:26:45,990
ID.

1321
02:26:49,170 --> 02:26:50,290
Aye, aye.

1322
02:26:52,630 --> 02:26:53,840
"Aye, aye"?

1323
02:27:17,070 --> 02:27:18,400
Okay.

1324
02:27:18,580 --> 02:27:20,660
"Okay"? Oh, gee, okay!

1325
02:27:27,630 --> 02:27:28,710
Doc!

1326
02:27:28,880 --> 02:27:30,120
They let you out of quarantine.

1327
02:27:30,170 --> 02:27:31,690
Yeah, I finally got them
to listen to reason.

1328
02:27:31,710 --> 02:27:33,950
Now, let's take a look and see
what progress we've made

1329
02:27:34,130 --> 02:27:35,130
with the electron-laser.

1330
02:27:35,300 --> 02:27:37,630
We've made some real progress.
Let me show you.

1331
02:27:52,730 --> 02:27:55,230
Victor, clear this place out.

1332
02:27:55,570 --> 02:27:56,810
Done.

1333
02:28:01,030 --> 02:28:03,700
Code red. Contamination breach.

1334
02:28:03,790 --> 02:28:07,120
All personnel evacuate immediately.

1335
02:28:07,210 --> 02:28:09,320
Bio red five.

1336
02:28:09,500 --> 02:28:11,870
The sensor's picking up
a microbe of alien origin.

1337
02:28:12,050 --> 02:28:14,660
A microbe of alien origin?
That doesn't make any sense.

1338
02:28:14,840 --> 02:28:15,960
It's gotta be a false alarm.

1339
02:28:16,010 --> 02:28:18,370
All right, people, shut it down.
Let's go.

1340
02:28:18,470 --> 02:28:19,950
- Ryan, we just had it swept.
- We have to go, doc.

1341
02:28:19,970 --> 02:28:21,320
Think about it.
It's gotta be a false alarm.

1342
02:28:21,350 --> 02:28:22,410
- Let's go, doc.
- Think about it.

1343
02:28:22,430 --> 02:28:23,820
Full base evacuation!
Everyone out!

1344
02:28:23,850 --> 02:28:26,090
Look, wait! Wait! Shit!

1345
02:28:26,270 --> 02:28:29,010
Remain calm
and proceed to the nearest exit.

1346
02:28:35,490 --> 02:28:37,190
Attention, all personnel.

1347
02:28:37,360 --> 02:28:40,150
Go! Go! Everybody out!
Come on! Move!

1348
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:41,940
Move! Come on! Go, go!

1349
02:28:42,120 --> 02:28:43,610
Everybody out! Go!

1350
02:29:04,060 --> 02:29:06,640
Yes! Gotchal

1351
02:29:07,020 --> 02:29:09,680
post commander, this is Dr. Silas stone,
do you read?

1352
02:29:09,850 --> 02:29:12,310
- Go ahead, Dr. stone.
- This is a false alarm.

1353
02:29:12,480 --> 02:29:15,020
Someone has hacked into the system.
We must alert...

1354
02:29:24,990 --> 02:29:26,400
Victor.

1355
02:29:28,160 --> 02:29:30,320
Dr. stone, you there?
I don't copy.

1356
02:29:31,370 --> 02:29:32,370
I was mistaken.

1357
02:29:32,540 --> 02:29:33,750
The alarm's legit.

1358
02:29:33,920 --> 02:29:35,500
Everybody out.
And nobody, I repeat,

1359
02:29:35,670 --> 02:29:38,410
nobody comes back inside
without my say-so.

1360
02:29:38,590 --> 02:29:39,830
Roger that, sir.

1361
02:29:50,480 --> 02:29:51,830
Get the civilians out!

1362
02:29:51,850 --> 02:29:53,090
Let's go! Let's go!

1363
02:29:57,280 --> 02:29:58,630
- Everybody got out okay?
- I think so.

1364
02:29:58,650 --> 02:29:59,650
- Everybody?
- Yes.

1365
02:30:32,980 --> 02:30:34,220
This way.

1366
02:30:44,820 --> 02:30:46,780
It knows he's here.

1367
02:30:47,950 --> 02:30:49,940
Ooh, that's intense.

1368
02:30:54,420 --> 02:30:56,280
This is amazing.

1369
02:30:57,130 --> 02:30:58,330
This is crazy.

1370
02:30:58,500 --> 02:31:00,370
Oh, what? Now it's crazy?

1371
02:31:00,550 --> 02:31:02,910
You two lunatics
better know what you're doing.

1372
02:33:28,900 --> 02:33:30,730
Systems coming online.

1373
02:33:33,660 --> 02:33:35,360
Welcome, Victor.

1374
02:33:36,120 --> 02:33:37,830
Would you like to assume command?

1375
02:33:37,910 --> 02:33:38,910
I'm in.

1376
02:33:48,340 --> 02:33:50,550
The ship says the mother box is hostile.

1377
02:33:50,720 --> 02:33:52,380
I can override the security protocols,

1378
02:33:52,550 --> 02:33:54,320
but there's no time to repair
all the electrical damage

1379
02:33:54,350 --> 02:33:56,710
that Luthor's power surges caused
to the primary capacitors.

1380
02:33:56,810 --> 02:33:57,970
English.

1381
02:33:58,140 --> 02:34:00,180
There's not enough charge
to wake the box.

1382
02:34:00,690 --> 02:34:02,550
I might be able to do it.

1383
02:34:04,900 --> 02:34:06,810
I mean, I might be able
to jump-start it.

1384
02:34:06,980 --> 02:34:08,170
I don't like to break this rule,

1385
02:34:08,190 --> 02:34:10,100
but when I approach
the speed of light, I...

1386
02:34:10,280 --> 02:34:11,770
Look, crazy things happen to time,

1387
02:34:11,950 --> 02:34:14,530
but if I do it,
I create massive electrical power.

1388
02:34:14,700 --> 02:34:16,580
I could backtrack,
if I can get enough distance,

1389
02:34:16,620 --> 02:34:18,780
I can conduct
a significant electrical current.

1390
02:34:18,950 --> 02:34:21,290
I might be able to wake the box,
if that's...

1391
02:34:21,710 --> 02:34:23,290
Still what we want?

1392
02:34:23,460 --> 02:34:24,870
Its. Do it.

1393
02:34:29,710 --> 02:34:30,920
Hey, miss Lane.

1394
02:34:31,010 --> 02:34:32,010
Morning.

1395
02:34:32,090 --> 02:34:33,330
I didn't think you were coming.

1396
02:34:34,470 --> 02:34:35,960
One last time.

1397
02:34:53,110 --> 02:34:56,480
I see engines, so this must be
the end of the line. So I'm...

1398
02:34:56,990 --> 02:34:58,090
I'm in position.

1399
02:35:00,950 --> 02:35:03,040
Ready to initiate drop sequence.

1400
02:35:03,500 --> 02:35:05,110
The mother box is ready.

1401
02:35:24,640 --> 02:35:26,480
The ship's begging me
not to wake the box.

1402
02:35:26,560 --> 02:35:27,920
This action is irreversible.

1403
02:35:27,940 --> 02:35:29,830
It's afraid.
It knows steppenwolf will come for it.

1404
02:35:29,860 --> 02:35:31,600
We know that already. Continue.

1405
02:35:31,940 --> 02:35:34,400
I strongly advise
against activation.

1406
02:35:34,570 --> 02:35:36,110
Barry, I'm initiating the countdown.

1407
02:35:36,280 --> 02:35:37,940
This action is irreversible.

1408
02:35:38,030 --> 02:35:39,150
- Five...
- Five...

1409
02:35:39,240 --> 02:35:40,470
- Five...
- Apokoliptian technology

1410
02:35:40,490 --> 02:35:41,550
- 1s hostile.
- This is a bad idea.

1411
02:35:41,580 --> 02:35:42,580
No, it isn't. Keep going.

1412
02:35:43,750 --> 02:35:44,810
- Four...
- Four...

1413
02:35:44,830 --> 02:35:46,060
I strongly advise
against activation.

1414
02:35:46,080 --> 02:35:47,990
We need to abort, now.
Just do it.

1415
02:35:48,330 --> 02:35:49,480
- Three...
- Three...

1416
02:35:49,500 --> 02:35:50,500
Three...

1417
02:35:50,590 --> 02:35:52,500
- Two...
- Two...

1418
02:35:52,670 --> 02:35:54,380
- Two...
- This course is irreversible.

1419
02:35:54,470 --> 02:35:55,670
- One.
- One.

1420
02:35:56,720 --> 02:35:59,500
- One.
- This action is irreversible.

1421
02:37:28,430 --> 02:37:30,020
- Victor?
- No.

1422
02:37:31,060 --> 02:37:32,060
Go?

1423
02:39:02,610 --> 02:39:05,520
The future
has taken root in the present.

1424
02:39:05,610 --> 02:39:07,230
Get down!

1425
02:40:51,350 --> 02:40:52,880
He's back.

1426
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:22,620
Something's wrong.
He's scanning us.

1427
02:41:24,750 --> 02:41:26,160
What?

1428
02:41:41,190 --> 02:41:42,190
Victor?

1429
02:41:43,480 --> 02:41:44,480
Victor?

1430
02:41:46,780 --> 02:41:48,310
- Shit.
- What are you doing?

1431
02:41:48,780 --> 02:41:50,310
It's my auto-defense system.

1432
02:41:50,490 --> 02:41:51,520
It senses danger.

1433
02:41:51,700 --> 02:41:52,860
Victor, no! Victor!

1434
02:41:53,030 --> 02:41:54,860
- I can't control it.
- Don't!

1435
02:42:07,300 --> 02:42:08,460
Kal-El, no!

1436
02:42:16,850 --> 02:42:18,800
He's confused.
He doesn't know who he is.

1437
02:42:25,980 --> 02:42:28,600
Arthur, we need to restrain him.

1438
02:42:59,180 --> 02:43:02,800
Kal-El, the last son of Krypton...

1439
02:43:03,890 --> 02:43:06,100
Remember who you are.

1440
02:43:07,730 --> 02:43:09,100
Tell me who you...

1441
02:44:43,950 --> 02:44:46,990
Let's go!

1442
02:44:54,210 --> 02:44:55,830
You should probably move.

1443
02:44:59,130 --> 02:45:00,130
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1444
02:45:00,300 --> 02:45:02,760
Get up. Take cover back there. Go.

1445
02:45:55,190 --> 02:45:57,230
Please don't make me do this.

1446
02:46:29,930 --> 02:46:31,050
Clark.

1447
02:46:32,140 --> 02:46:33,300
Clark, no.

1448
02:46:44,870 --> 02:46:45,870
Clark.

1449
02:46:46,280 --> 02:46:47,440
No.

1450
02:46:48,290 --> 02:46:50,030
This world needs you.

1451
02:46:55,250 --> 02:46:56,250
Clark.

1452
02:46:56,630 --> 02:46:57,830
Clark.

1453
02:46:57,920 --> 02:46:59,960
Whoa! Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

1454
02:47:01,590 --> 02:47:02,710
Clark.

1455
02:47:06,090 --> 02:47:07,460
Please.

1456
02:47:41,710 --> 02:47:42,830
Please.

1457
02:47:54,060 --> 02:47:55,220
Please.

1458
02:47:55,980 --> 02:47:57,760
Just go.

1459
02:47:58,230 --> 02:47:59,230
Yeanh.

1460
02:48:00,110 --> 02:48:01,390
Let's go.

1461
02:48:33,970 --> 02:48:35,970
I'm so sorry.

1462
02:48:45,360 --> 02:48:46,360
Take cover!

1463
02:48:46,610 --> 02:48:49,100
- He's coming.
- The mother box.

1464
02:48:49,280 --> 02:48:50,320
Where is it?

1465
02:49:01,040 --> 02:49:02,250
Come on.

1466
02:49:03,170 --> 02:49:04,460
Come on.

1467
02:49:33,620 --> 02:49:35,780
Sector four, level three.

1468
02:49:35,950 --> 02:49:38,740
Implement lockdown procedures
immediately.

1469
02:50:07,320 --> 02:50:08,900
Give me the mother box.

1470
02:50:22,080 --> 02:50:23,490
No, no, no.

1471
02:50:26,040 --> 02:50:27,750
Dad, wait! Don't!

1472
02:51:08,090 --> 02:51:10,950
So begins the end.

1473
02:51:16,720 --> 02:51:18,010
Victor?

1474
02:51:20,560 --> 02:51:23,670
Vic... whoa, Victor.
Are you okay, man? Come on.

1475
02:51:29,690 --> 02:51:30,850
Victor?

1476
02:51:31,990 --> 02:51:33,440
He's dead.

1477
02:51:33,610 --> 02:51:34,610
What?

1478
02:51:35,700 --> 02:51:36,900
My father.

1479
02:51:38,370 --> 02:51:41,320
I didn't save him. I couldn't.

1480
02:51:42,120 --> 02:51:43,410
Oh, my god.

1481
02:51:50,340 --> 02:51:52,420
His father's dead 'cause of us.

1482
02:51:52,590 --> 02:51:54,190
I told you waking that box
was a bad idea.

1483
02:51:54,220 --> 02:51:55,800
It wasn't a bad idea.

1484
02:51:55,970 --> 02:51:58,300
We needed Superman. We still do.

1485
02:51:58,470 --> 02:52:00,760
Well, whatever returned,
it isn't Superman.

1486
02:52:00,930 --> 02:52:03,920
His body and powers, maybe.
But it ain't him.

1487
02:52:04,100 --> 02:52:05,720
It is him.

1488
02:52:05,890 --> 02:52:08,010
He recognized Lois Lane.

1489
02:52:08,400 --> 02:52:10,310
- Who?
- The woman he loves.

1490
02:52:10,690 --> 02:52:12,680
- He remembers her.
- Nah.

1491
02:52:13,240 --> 02:52:15,080
He went to her
'cause she wasn't afraid of him.

1492
02:52:15,150 --> 02:52:16,560
It's called instinct, Diana.

1493
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:25,830
Walt, where did steppenwolf go?

1494
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:27,600
He's gone back to his base

1495
02:52:27,670 --> 02:52:29,330
to assemble the three boxes.

1496
02:52:29,500 --> 02:52:31,020
And we don't know
where his base is.

1497
02:52:31,040 --> 02:52:32,600
- Or how long until...
- Hours.

1498
02:52:32,750 --> 02:52:34,420
The boxes synchronize, unity forms,

1499
02:52:34,590 --> 02:52:36,830
we don't get there in time
to stop it, the planet dies.

1500
02:52:37,760 --> 02:52:39,420
This is not your...

1501
02:52:41,970 --> 02:52:43,460
He knew.

1502
02:52:43,770 --> 02:52:45,350
He knew, he knew, he knew.

1503
02:52:45,520 --> 02:52:47,040
He wasn't trying to destroy the box...

1504
02:52:47,350 --> 02:52:49,260
He was trying to superheat it.

1505
02:52:49,440 --> 02:52:50,800
He made the core the hottest thing

1506
02:52:50,900 --> 02:52:52,040
on earth outside of a nuclear reactor.

1507
02:52:52,070 --> 02:52:53,290
Now, anything that hot would have to...

1508
02:52:53,320 --> 02:52:54,460
Blink off the charts

1509
02:52:54,480 --> 02:52:56,690
on a thermal imaging system.

1510
02:52:56,860 --> 02:53:00,230
Your father sacrificed himself
to Mark that box.

1511
02:53:00,410 --> 02:53:02,410
We have to get back to my lab
and use the satellite

1512
02:53:02,450 --> 02:53:04,440
to scan the earth for thermal anomalies.

1513
02:53:04,620 --> 02:53:05,730
I'm already on it.

1514
02:53:05,910 --> 02:53:07,900
- I'm sorry.
- You have a satellite?

1515
02:53:08,080 --> 02:53:09,080
I have six.

1516
02:53:09,580 --> 02:53:10,620
Right.

1517
02:53:12,420 --> 02:53:14,410
Let's go find the son of a bitch.

1518
02:53:38,990 --> 02:53:41,070
You brought us here.

1519
02:53:41,240 --> 02:53:42,400
You remembered.

1520
02:53:43,330 --> 02:53:44,940
This is home.

1521
02:53:46,870 --> 02:53:48,080
You spoke.

1522
02:53:52,130 --> 02:53:53,990
Did I not before?

1523
02:54:27,990 --> 02:54:30,530
Your mother got behind on the payments.

1524
02:54:32,040 --> 02:54:34,030
She never told anyone.

1525
02:54:35,710 --> 02:54:37,450
I don't understand.

1526
02:54:40,550 --> 02:54:42,960
She's a proud woman, Clark.

1527
02:54:46,100 --> 02:54:47,460
Here.

1528
02:55:02,400 --> 02:55:04,070
She loved it here.

1529
02:55:14,870 --> 02:55:16,490
So did I.

1530
02:55:18,500 --> 02:55:19,910
So did I.

1531
02:55:45,570 --> 02:55:46,860
Wow!

1532
02:55:47,030 --> 02:55:48,650
This is awesome.

1533
02:55:48,830 --> 02:55:50,320
Brought some friends.

1534
02:55:56,880 --> 02:55:59,460
Oh, gosh, yes! Yes!

1535
02:55:59,630 --> 02:56:02,120
Everyone, this is Alfred.
I work for him.

1536
02:56:02,300 --> 02:56:04,500
- Alfred.
- Good day, ma'am.

1537
02:56:06,510 --> 02:56:07,590
Oh...

1538
02:56:10,970 --> 02:56:12,840
It's badass, Alfred.

1539
02:56:15,640 --> 02:56:18,060
Well, I'll put on the tea.

1540
02:56:18,230 --> 02:56:19,230
Great.

1541
02:56:19,400 --> 02:56:21,230
I don't know where
we're gonna find the cups.

1542
02:56:24,150 --> 02:56:26,990
There's the mother box,
right there.

1543
02:56:27,160 --> 02:56:28,940
Go to visible spectrum.

1544
02:56:30,990 --> 02:56:32,650
Pozharnov.

1545
02:56:33,240 --> 02:56:36,080
Ghost city not far from Moscow.

1546
02:56:36,250 --> 02:56:37,250
It's been abandoned since

1547
02:56:37,330 --> 02:56:38,910
the nuclear accident there
30 years ago.

1548
02:56:39,080 --> 02:56:40,290
Not even the army goes in.

1549
02:56:40,460 --> 02:56:41,900
Right,
it's probably so radioactive

1550
02:56:41,920 --> 02:56:44,080
that you grow an extra foot
outta your neck.

1551
02:56:44,170 --> 02:56:45,170
Not anymore.

1552
02:56:45,260 --> 02:56:47,250
He's harvested the radiation
to build his base.

1553
02:56:47,340 --> 02:56:48,380
Oom.

1554
02:56:52,430 --> 02:56:53,800
What the hell is he building?

1555
02:56:53,970 --> 02:56:55,210
The unity's in there.

1556
02:56:55,390 --> 02:56:56,800
We'll attack from above.

1557
02:56:56,980 --> 02:56:59,560
Explosives won't separate the boxes,

1558
02:56:59,730 --> 02:57:01,560
only strengthen their bond.

1559
02:57:01,730 --> 02:57:03,000
What? So we can't blow it up?

1560
02:57:03,020 --> 02:57:04,480
Not from the outside.

1561
02:57:06,070 --> 02:57:08,440
I want to plug into the unity,
one-on-one.

1562
02:57:09,160 --> 02:57:10,570
Fuse with it.

1563
02:57:10,740 --> 02:57:11,980
Weaken its bond from the inside

1564
02:57:12,080 --> 02:57:13,430
so we can break it back into three.

1565
02:57:13,450 --> 02:57:15,660
No, you don't know
what you'd be up against.

1566
02:57:15,830 --> 02:57:19,370
You'd have to stream
into the unity by yourself.

1567
02:57:19,540 --> 02:57:21,870
These boxes together
are world destroyers.

1568
02:57:22,040 --> 02:57:23,450
A billion years old.

1569
02:57:23,630 --> 02:57:25,740
They'll get inside you
and find your weaknesses

1570
02:57:25,920 --> 02:57:28,080
and your fears,
and use them to destroy you.

1571
02:57:28,260 --> 02:57:30,250
Just get me in and get me time.

1572
02:57:30,510 --> 02:57:31,670
You could die, Victor.

1573
02:57:31,850 --> 02:57:34,130
If I don't, we all die. Period.

1574
02:57:38,890 --> 02:57:40,630
I got nothing left.

1575
02:57:46,030 --> 02:57:47,980
You wanted me to use these gifts, right?

1576
02:57:51,070 --> 02:57:52,560
That's what I'm gonna do.

1577
02:57:52,740 --> 02:57:54,610
Okay. So...

1578
02:57:55,330 --> 02:57:56,940
If Victor wants to try to save the world

1579
02:57:57,040 --> 02:57:58,570
by fusing with the doom boxes,

1580
02:57:58,790 --> 02:58:00,950
I say we put him in the doom boxes.

1581
02:58:01,290 --> 02:58:04,080
But getting him in
means attacking that base.

1582
02:58:04,250 --> 02:58:06,460
Fighting the devil and his army

1583
02:58:06,630 --> 02:58:07,660
in hell.

1584
02:58:07,840 --> 02:58:10,080
I mean,
this guy's probably fought

1585
02:58:10,260 --> 02:58:12,590
hundreds of thousands
of other superbeings

1586
02:58:12,680 --> 02:58:14,360
on the other planets
he's destroyed, right?

1587
02:58:14,390 --> 02:58:15,880
And we have to assume he's won.

1588
02:58:16,060 --> 02:58:19,170
I don't care how many demons he's fought
in how many hells...

1589
02:58:19,350 --> 02:58:22,840
He's never fought us. Not us united.

1590
02:59:13,320 --> 02:59:14,940
Take that as a "yes."

1591
02:59:15,070 --> 02:59:16,400
What?

1592
02:59:19,870 --> 02:59:21,110
The ring.

1593
02:59:24,830 --> 02:59:26,370
You're really back.

1594
02:59:59,870 --> 03:00:02,070
I have a second chance, lo.

1595
03:00:04,370 --> 03:00:06,830
And I am not gonna waste it.

1596
03:01:05,100 --> 03:01:06,260
Are you really you?

1597
03:01:06,430 --> 03:01:08,140
I'm really me, ma.

1598
03:01:26,160 --> 03:01:28,200
Listen, ma.

1599
03:01:29,790 --> 03:01:31,830
They wanted me back for a reason.

1600
03:01:33,590 --> 03:01:35,120
I need to find out why.

1601
03:01:55,270 --> 03:01:56,680
How's Victor doing?

1602
03:02:01,070 --> 03:02:03,810
You know, wanted to be by himself.

1603
03:02:05,410 --> 03:02:08,570
We're asking a kid
who just lost his father

1604
03:02:08,750 --> 03:02:10,310
to go up against
the most powerful machines

1605
03:02:10,330 --> 03:02:11,540
in the universe.

1606
03:02:13,380 --> 03:02:14,870
It's not fair.

1607
03:02:16,630 --> 03:02:18,240
I thought you didn't care?

1608
03:02:19,670 --> 03:02:21,160
I never said that.

1609
03:02:34,110 --> 03:02:35,520
What is it?

1610
03:02:37,320 --> 03:02:38,680
Uh...

1611
03:02:39,440 --> 03:02:42,440
I had a dream, like, I don't know,

1612
03:02:42,530 --> 03:02:44,440
almost like a premonition.

1613
03:02:45,410 --> 03:02:48,200
It was the end of the world

1614
03:02:48,370 --> 03:02:51,200
and Barry Allen was right here

1615
03:02:51,370 --> 03:02:55,240
and he said to me,
"Lois Lane is the key."

1616
03:02:57,920 --> 03:03:01,130
She is... to Superman.

1617
03:03:02,180 --> 03:03:03,790
Every heart has one.

1618
03:03:04,430 --> 03:03:06,290
I think it's something more.

1619
03:03:07,180 --> 03:03:09,050
Something darker.

1620
03:03:13,230 --> 03:03:14,230
Master Wayne.

1621
03:03:14,400 --> 03:03:15,890
Master Wayne!

1622
03:03:16,730 --> 03:03:18,390
You need to see this.

1623
03:03:41,670 --> 03:03:43,380
You fixed it.

1624
03:03:43,550 --> 03:03:45,260
It wanted to fly.

1625
03:03:46,510 --> 03:03:47,840
Flight is its nature.

1626
03:03:48,010 --> 03:03:49,300
Yours, too.

1627
03:03:56,100 --> 03:03:58,060
He'll be here, Alfred, I know it.

1628
03:03:58,230 --> 03:03:59,850
What makes you so sure?

1629
03:04:00,610 --> 03:04:03,190
Faith, Alfred. Faith.

1630
03:04:25,300 --> 03:04:26,880
At last.

1631
03:04:28,720 --> 03:04:31,430
Prepare for his arrival.

1632
03:04:33,270 --> 03:04:37,380
My redemption is nigh.

1633
03:04:45,280 --> 03:04:46,730
Unite.

1634
03:04:51,910 --> 03:04:54,400
Synchronize.

1635
03:05:38,750 --> 03:05:41,660
The satellites revealed
he's created a defensive dome.

1636
03:05:41,830 --> 03:05:42,990
It's a design flaw.

1637
03:05:43,170 --> 03:05:45,410
Take out the tower, the dome will fall.

1638
03:05:45,590 --> 03:05:47,580
The enemy never anticipated
a frontal assault.

1639
03:05:47,760 --> 03:05:49,320
Right,
probably 'cause he didn't think

1640
03:05:49,340 --> 03:05:51,250
anyone would be that nuts.

1641
03:05:52,260 --> 03:05:53,550
Bruce is right.

1642
03:05:53,720 --> 03:05:55,300
We've got to destroy
the defensive dome

1643
03:05:55,470 --> 03:05:57,760
so we can reach the unity
before it synchronizes.

1644
03:05:57,930 --> 03:05:59,640
What if the dome's not destroyed?

1645
03:05:59,810 --> 03:06:00,810
It'll be destroyed.

1646
03:06:00,980 --> 03:06:02,980
Once Victor is linked with the unity

1647
03:06:03,110 --> 03:06:04,310
with Barry's help,

1648
03:06:04,400 --> 03:06:06,350
he'll break through
the unity's defenses.

1649
03:06:06,530 --> 03:06:08,050
Remind me, how's that again?

1650
03:06:08,150 --> 03:06:09,770
Uh, with the power of love.

1651
03:06:09,950 --> 03:06:12,560
- Barry.
- With a catastrophic energy surge.

1652
03:06:12,740 --> 03:06:13,740
Good.

1653
03:06:13,910 --> 03:06:15,930
You'll have to run faster
than you've ever attempted

1654
03:06:15,950 --> 03:06:18,110
to generate a charge of that size.

1655
03:06:18,660 --> 03:06:20,650
And then you make
physical contact with Victor.

1656
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:23,870
That force should propel him
inside the unity.

1657
03:06:24,040 --> 03:06:25,910
And, Victor, it's all up to you.

1658
03:06:26,090 --> 03:06:28,830
Take it apart from the inside
before it synchronizes.

1659
03:06:29,510 --> 03:06:32,540
Whew.
We actually finally have a plan.

1660
03:06:33,090 --> 03:06:34,800
We have a plan.

1661
03:06:50,150 --> 03:06:52,190
The symbol of the house of El
means hope.

1662
03:06:52,360 --> 03:06:54,520
Embodied within that hope
is the fundamental belief

1663
03:06:54,700 --> 03:06:58,410
in the potential of every person
to be a force for good.

1664
03:06:58,580 --> 03:06:59,580
Clark...

1665
03:06:59,660 --> 03:07:01,010
That's what you can bring them.

1666
03:07:01,040 --> 03:07:02,990
You were sent here for a reason.

1667
03:07:03,170 --> 03:07:05,080
You will give
the people of earth

1668
03:07:05,170 --> 03:07:07,030
an ideal to strive towards.

1669
03:07:07,710 --> 03:07:09,690
And even if it takes you
the rest of your life,

1670
03:07:09,710 --> 03:07:13,460
you owe it to yourself
to find out what that reason is.

1671
03:07:13,630 --> 03:07:16,250
They will stumble,
they will fall.

1672
03:07:16,430 --> 03:07:18,230
You're gonna
have to make a choice.

1673
03:07:18,560 --> 03:07:20,970
They will join you
in the sun, kal.

1674
03:07:21,140 --> 03:07:23,050
A choice
of whether to stand proud

1675
03:07:23,140 --> 03:07:25,100
in front of the human race or hot.

1676
03:07:25,270 --> 03:07:28,430
You will help them
accomplish wonders.

1677
03:07:45,580 --> 03:07:50,080
All the hopes and dreams
of Krypton live in you now.

1678
03:07:50,250 --> 03:07:52,500
I'm so proud of you, son.

1679
03:07:53,840 --> 03:07:55,880
Your mother and I loved you.

1680
03:07:56,550 --> 03:07:58,010
Your mother and I knew

1681
03:07:58,100 --> 03:08:00,090
you would change the world.

1682
03:08:01,390 --> 03:08:03,220
Your heart was tested.

1683
03:08:04,520 --> 03:08:06,470
I know it's been hard, Clark.

1684
03:08:07,230 --> 03:08:10,140
But you gave hope
to their world.

1685
03:08:10,320 --> 03:08:12,980
You need
to show them who you are.

1686
03:08:13,690 --> 03:08:15,400
Love them, kal.

1687
03:08:16,030 --> 03:08:18,150
The way we loved you.

1688
03:08:20,620 --> 03:08:21,730
Fly, son.

1689
03:08:22,790 --> 03:08:23,990
It's time.

1690
03:09:27,770 --> 03:09:29,220
I'm gonna take out that tower

1691
03:09:29,310 --> 03:09:30,890
and knock down that shield dome.

1692
03:09:31,060 --> 03:09:32,180
Whatever you see,

1693
03:09:33,520 --> 03:09:34,640
stick to the plan.

1694
03:09:37,360 --> 03:09:39,270
It's why I brought you together.

1695
03:10:19,360 --> 03:10:21,100
Bruce, pull back.
You're not gonna make it.

1696
03:10:24,240 --> 03:10:26,950
Just have to knock
a little louder.

1697
03:10:51,940 --> 03:10:52,940
Kill him!

1698
03:10:53,690 --> 03:10:56,430
Get to the carriage. Defend the unity.

1699
03:11:01,650 --> 03:11:02,650
Oh, shit.

1700
03:11:22,800 --> 03:11:23,880
The tower's down.

1701
03:11:26,220 --> 03:11:27,220
Do you read me?

1702
03:11:27,550 --> 03:11:28,670
Uh, yeah, loud and clear.

1703
03:11:29,770 --> 03:11:31,130
Are you okay?

1704
03:11:32,390 --> 03:11:34,980
Bruce? Bruce?

1705
03:11:35,270 --> 03:11:36,390
Get to the reactor.

1706
03:11:36,480 --> 03:11:37,670
I'll lure as many of these monsters

1707
03:11:37,690 --> 03:11:39,810
away from you as I can.
“What does that mean?

1708
03:11:42,820 --> 03:11:44,810
Don't worry about me.
Get to the unity.

1709
03:11:47,490 --> 03:11:48,610
They're here.

1710
03:11:48,700 --> 03:11:49,860
Bruce?

1711
03:11:52,870 --> 03:11:54,160
Comm went dead.

1712
03:11:55,870 --> 03:11:57,110
Let's go.

1713
03:12:36,040 --> 03:12:37,870
Come on, follow me, you damn insects.

1714
03:13:57,830 --> 03:13:59,190
Critical damage.

1715
03:14:39,000 --> 03:14:40,240
You really are outta your mind.

1716
03:15:07,150 --> 03:15:08,260
You're welcome.

1717
03:15:08,440 --> 03:15:09,730
My man.

1718
03:16:42,830 --> 03:16:44,440
Yeah, we got this.

1719
03:16:44,620 --> 03:16:45,990
You go do your thing.

1720
03:17:41,800 --> 03:17:43,290
I'm assuming you're Alfred.

1721
03:17:45,180 --> 03:17:46,470
Master Kent.

1722
03:17:48,520 --> 03:17:50,010
He said you'd come.

1723
03:17:51,730 --> 03:17:55,140
Now, let's hope you're not too late.

1724
03:18:05,990 --> 03:18:08,280
Hey!

1725
03:18:16,380 --> 03:18:17,710
Remember me?

1726
03:18:20,260 --> 03:18:21,670
Round two?

1727
03:18:22,390 --> 03:18:23,550
Hell yeah.

1728
03:18:45,080 --> 03:18:46,440
Shall we?

1729
03:18:47,410 --> 03:18:49,700
Tell me, Amazon,

1730
03:18:49,870 --> 03:18:53,160
why did you abandon your own sisters

1731
03:18:54,080 --> 03:18:56,540
only to cast your lot
with these creatures

1732
03:18:56,710 --> 03:18:59,950
clinging to their puny lives?

1733
03:19:00,170 --> 03:19:03,010
You weren't there
to protect them from me.

1734
03:19:03,260 --> 03:19:05,300
And, sadly, you could have.

1735
03:19:46,260 --> 03:19:47,970
Barry, I'm in position.

1736
03:20:06,740 --> 03:20:09,450
Okay. I built the charge.

1737
03:20:10,080 --> 03:20:11,160
You call it.

1738
03:20:12,330 --> 03:20:13,570
Barry, on one.

1739
03:20:14,250 --> 03:20:16,200
Three, two...

1740
03:20:19,380 --> 03:20:20,740
Get the hell off me!

1741
03:20:21,250 --> 03:20:22,590
Victor!

1742
03:20:58,670 --> 03:21:00,200
Victor!

1743
03:21:04,050 --> 03:21:06,540
I watched your island burn,

1744
03:21:06,720 --> 03:21:10,170
your sisters begging for their lives.

1745
03:21:10,350 --> 03:21:12,590
As did your mother.

1746
03:21:12,970 --> 03:21:13,970
Liar.

1747
03:21:39,710 --> 03:21:41,700
I can't maintain this!

1748
03:21:42,590 --> 03:21:43,590
Victor!

1749
03:22:05,820 --> 03:22:08,020
Victor, I can't hold this!

1750
03:22:14,700 --> 03:22:16,940
For darkseid.

1751
03:22:20,920 --> 03:22:23,280
Not impressed.

1752
03:23:07,800 --> 03:23:08,910
All right.

1753
03:23:09,090 --> 03:23:10,670
Kal-El.

1754
03:23:49,210 --> 03:23:51,420
Barry, I'm connected to the unity.

1755
03:23:51,590 --> 03:23:53,550
I need the charge to get inside.

1756
03:24:15,610 --> 03:24:16,610
Barry?

1757
03:24:17,530 --> 03:24:19,190
Barry, are you okay?

1758
03:24:20,830 --> 03:24:21,870
Barry!

1759
03:24:21,910 --> 03:24:23,320
I got the wind knocked out of me.

1760
03:24:23,410 --> 03:24:25,400
Need a few seconds, that's alll

1761
03:24:42,520 --> 03:24:45,350
Barry, where are you?
It's almost synchronized!

1762
03:24:45,600 --> 03:24:47,340
Okay, okay.

1763
03:24:47,730 --> 03:24:50,350
Oh, my god. Gotta heal, Barry.

1764
03:24:50,520 --> 03:24:52,180
Heal heal.

1765
03:25:18,050 --> 03:25:19,590
Barry!

1766
03:25:32,520 --> 03:25:34,230
It's too late.

1767
03:25:35,570 --> 03:25:36,980
Oh, no.

1768
03:25:41,200 --> 03:25:42,860
He's here!

1769
03:26:12,360 --> 03:26:13,390
Okay.

1770
03:26:13,480 --> 03:26:14,920
Just gotta go faster
than the speed of light.

1771
03:26:14,940 --> 03:26:16,090
Far beyond the speed of light.

1772
03:26:16,110 --> 03:26:17,290
You gotta break the rule, Barry,

1773
03:26:17,320 --> 03:26:19,350
and you gotta do it now.

1774
03:26:32,420 --> 03:26:34,120
Dad...

1775
03:26:37,960 --> 03:26:40,300
Whatever happens, I want you to know

1776
03:26:43,010 --> 03:26:45,000
your kid was one of them, dad.

1777
03:26:48,220 --> 03:26:50,140
One of the best of the best.

1778
03:27:45,570 --> 03:27:48,110
Make your own future.

1779
03:27:54,580 --> 03:27:56,540
Make your own past.

1780
03:28:01,130 --> 03:28:04,670
It's all right now.

1781
03:28:51,720 --> 03:28:53,880
We've been waiting for you, Victor.

1782
03:28:55,020 --> 03:28:57,100
My broken boy.

1783
03:28:59,520 --> 03:29:01,510
You don't have to be alone anymore.

1784
03:29:01,690 --> 03:29:03,350
We'll be together again.

1785
03:29:11,200 --> 03:29:13,280
We can put it back, Vic.

1786
03:29:17,620 --> 03:29:19,740
Make you whole again.

1787
03:29:31,600 --> 03:29:33,340
I'm not broken.

1788
03:29:43,070 --> 03:29:44,930
And I'm not alone.

1789
03:30:01,750 --> 03:30:02,750
Superman!

1790
03:31:33,430 --> 03:31:35,380
I told you

1791
03:31:36,970 --> 03:31:39,590
steppenwolf would fail.

1792
03:31:40,560 --> 03:31:44,220
Yes. Yes, you did.

1793
03:31:44,900 --> 03:31:46,260
My master,

1794
03:31:46,360 --> 03:31:49,390
now that the mother boxes
have been destroyed,

1795
03:31:50,280 --> 03:31:54,020
how will you retrieve your great prize?

1796
03:31:54,280 --> 03:31:57,690
Anti-life is found, desaad.

1797
03:31:57,870 --> 03:32:02,530
And we will stop at nothing
to possess it.

1798
03:32:05,710 --> 03:32:07,200
Ready the armada.

1799
03:32:08,130 --> 03:32:10,540
We will use the old ways.

1800
03:34:34,900 --> 03:34:37,020
Your father twice over.

1801
03:34:44,330 --> 03:34:46,780
Now, let me speak to you
from my heart,

1802
03:34:46,870 --> 03:34:48,660
not as a scientist,

1803
03:34:48,830 --> 03:34:50,490
as a father.

1804
03:34:50,620 --> 03:34:53,740
Your father twice over.

1805
03:34:56,300 --> 03:34:59,710
I brought you into the world
and back to it.

1806
03:34:59,880 --> 03:35:03,500
You can't imagine how proud I am
of who you are.

1807
03:35:04,050 --> 03:35:05,710
Have always been.

1808
03:35:07,850 --> 03:35:09,210
So many years with you I wasted.

1809
03:35:09,310 --> 03:35:12,720
So many wrongs I've left un-righted.

1810
03:35:15,190 --> 03:35:17,050
Everything breaks, Victor.

1811
03:35:17,650 --> 03:35:19,890
Everything changes.

1812
03:35:30,580 --> 03:35:32,660
I gotta go see my father.

1813
03:36:08,240 --> 03:36:10,070
The world is hurt.

1814
03:36:10,240 --> 03:36:11,320
Broken.

1815
03:36:11,500 --> 03:36:13,280
Unexchangeable.

1816
03:36:14,080 --> 03:36:15,740
Ship's all yours now, kid.

1817
03:36:15,830 --> 03:36:17,160
You're the boss.

1818
03:36:19,460 --> 03:36:22,630
"Ryan choi, director of nanotechnology."

1819
03:36:22,800 --> 03:36:24,290
That's your thing.

1820
03:36:24,970 --> 03:36:26,380
Uh, yep.

1821
03:36:26,970 --> 03:36:28,550
That's my thing.

1822
03:36:33,600 --> 03:36:37,690
But the world's
not fixed in the past,

1823
03:36:37,770 --> 03:36:38,930
only the future.

1824
03:36:40,820 --> 03:36:44,680
The not yet. The now.

1825
03:36:44,860 --> 03:36:47,820
Wow. Must be 100, 150 feet.

1826
03:36:48,410 --> 03:36:49,740
Must be.

1827
03:36:50,870 --> 03:36:52,480
Big round table.

1828
03:36:52,660 --> 03:36:54,820
Six chairs, right there.

1829
03:36:55,960 --> 03:36:57,570
But room for more.

1830
03:37:00,000 --> 03:37:01,620
But room for more.

1831
03:37:02,630 --> 03:37:04,370
God help us.

1832
03:37:06,180 --> 03:37:08,170
The now is you.

1833
03:37:11,890 --> 03:37:13,250
What?

1834
03:37:13,430 --> 03:37:16,220
It's actually the worst job
you can get in a crime lab.

1835
03:37:16,390 --> 03:37:18,760
But, uh, my foot's in the door.

1836
03:37:18,940 --> 03:37:20,520
This is like a "job" job?

1837
03:37:21,320 --> 03:37:22,430
"Job" job.

1838
03:37:26,110 --> 03:37:28,690
Your foot's in the door.

1839
03:37:31,030 --> 03:37:32,230
Isn't that a thing people say?

1840
03:37:32,330 --> 03:37:34,240
Your foot's in the door.

1841
03:37:34,410 --> 03:37:36,700
Yeah, that's something people say, man.

1842
03:37:36,870 --> 03:37:38,560
His foot's in the door!

1843
03:37:38,580 --> 03:37:41,040
- That's my boy, right there!
- Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

1844
03:37:41,250 --> 03:37:42,580
Taught him nothing he knows.

1845
03:37:42,750 --> 03:37:45,110
- Yes!
- Dad, you're gonna get maced again.

1846
03:37:48,300 --> 03:37:50,010
No stopping you now.

1847
03:37:52,140 --> 03:37:53,380
Thanks, dad.

1848
03:37:53,560 --> 03:37:54,590
Now.

1849
03:37:54,770 --> 03:37:57,850
Now's your time, Victor, to rise.

1850
03:37:58,140 --> 03:38:01,100
"Thank you" is not enough
for what you did.

1851
03:38:01,270 --> 03:38:04,640
I just undid a mistake, that's all.

1852
03:38:15,080 --> 03:38:17,530
How did you get the house
back from the bank?

1853
03:38:18,000 --> 03:38:19,990
I bought the bank.

1854
03:38:22,420 --> 03:38:24,700
Congratulations, by the way.

1855
03:38:25,050 --> 03:38:26,580
Do this. Be this.

1856
03:38:26,960 --> 03:38:31,130
The man I never was. The hero you are.

1857
03:38:32,300 --> 03:38:34,590
Take your place among the brave ones.

1858
03:38:34,760 --> 03:38:39,680
The ones that were, that are,
that are yet to be.

1859
03:39:12,340 --> 03:39:15,260
It's time you stand,

1860
03:39:19,020 --> 03:39:20,510
fight,

1861
03:39:23,150 --> 03:39:24,560
discover,

1862
03:39:29,320 --> 03:39:31,400
heal, love,

1863
03:39:34,990 --> 03:39:36,030
win.

1864
03:40:02,640 --> 03:40:04,220
The time

1865
03:40:04,520 --> 03:40:05,890
is how.

1866
03:40:15,070 --> 03:40:16,310
Ready?

1867
03:40:16,490 --> 03:40:17,780
Come on, Stevens.

1868
03:40:21,410 --> 03:40:23,250
All right, let's keep it moving.

1869
03:40:24,620 --> 03:40:25,740
Keep going.

1870
03:40:27,540 --> 03:40:29,280
Come on, Luthor. Let's go.

1871
03:40:32,970 --> 03:40:34,080
Luthor.

1872
03:40:39,100 --> 03:40:40,140
Open up two, Carl, please.

1873
03:40:49,270 --> 03:40:50,560
Luthor.

1874
03:40:55,610 --> 03:40:57,230
All right, stop jerking around, Luthor,

1875
03:40:57,320 --> 03:40:58,810
or I'm gonna have to come in there.

1876
03:42:27,450 --> 03:42:29,370
Ah, there he is.

1877
03:42:30,120 --> 03:42:31,360
Welcome aboard.

1878
03:42:31,540 --> 03:42:33,330
Care for a glass of gout de diamants?

1879
03:42:33,500 --> 03:42:35,370
I was just celebrating god's return.

1880
03:42:35,550 --> 03:42:37,830
Out of the ground
and back up into the sky.

1881
03:42:38,220 --> 03:42:39,280
I heard you were

1882
03:42:39,300 --> 03:42:40,540
a few clowns short of a circus.

1883
03:42:40,680 --> 03:42:42,340
I was, thank you,

1884
03:42:42,510 --> 03:42:44,630
until the good doctors
at arkham helped me

1885
03:42:44,720 --> 03:42:46,800
find some much needed clarity.

1886
03:42:46,970 --> 03:42:49,180
Now, you volunteered
to destroy the bat

1887
03:42:49,270 --> 03:42:50,270
free of charge.

1888
03:42:50,440 --> 03:42:51,930
Why the pro bono work?

1889
03:42:52,310 --> 03:42:53,770
It's personal.

1890
03:42:54,440 --> 03:42:57,230
Ah, let me guess, an eye for an eye?

1891
03:42:59,320 --> 03:43:01,030
You said you had something I'd want?

1892
03:43:01,200 --> 03:43:02,640
You'd better not be wasting my time.

1893
03:43:03,030 --> 03:43:04,860
Ooh. And endure your wrath, Mr. Wilson?

1894
03:43:04,950 --> 03:43:06,690
No, I wouldn't think of it.

1895
03:43:06,870 --> 03:43:08,200
Uh, I have too much to live for.

1896
03:43:08,290 --> 03:43:10,450
And more important things to do.

1897
03:43:11,420 --> 03:43:14,870
But if you want the Batman,

1898
03:43:15,040 --> 03:43:18,130
here is something that can help you.

1899
03:43:19,460 --> 03:43:23,580
His name is Bruce Wayne.

1900
03:43:26,810 --> 03:43:29,220
Hmm. On second thought,

1901
03:43:31,560 --> 03:43:33,470
we do have something to celebrate.

1902
03:43:34,610 --> 03:43:36,020
Good boy.

1903
03:44:40,340 --> 03:44:41,540
Clear.

1904
03:44:47,050 --> 03:44:48,540
How much further?

1905
03:44:49,810 --> 03:44:51,010
We're almost there.

1906
03:44:53,270 --> 03:44:54,800
Well, we need to hurry.

1907
03:44:54,980 --> 03:44:56,580
We can't be out in the open much longer.

1908
03:44:56,650 --> 03:44:58,260
He'll come for us.

1909
03:45:01,230 --> 03:45:02,850
Let him come.

1910
03:45:03,360 --> 03:45:04,980
I et the bastard come.

1911
03:45:06,450 --> 03:45:08,530
I'll stab this through his heart

1912
03:45:08,620 --> 03:45:10,230
for what he did to Arthur.

1913
03:45:11,030 --> 03:45:12,950
I want to make him pay.

1914
03:45:14,660 --> 03:45:16,950
I understand how you feel, mera.

1915
03:45:17,460 --> 03:45:19,950
You have no idea how I feel.

1916
03:45:20,460 --> 03:45:22,330
But we have to stick to the plan

1917
03:45:22,420 --> 03:45:24,580
to have any chance to make this right.

1918
03:45:32,510 --> 03:45:35,930
Who have you ever loved?

1919
03:45:50,070 --> 03:45:53,240
Au contraire,
my little fish stick.

1920
03:45:57,000 --> 03:45:58,610
He knows exactly what it's like

1921
03:45:58,710 --> 03:46:00,410
to lose someone he loves.

1922
03:46:02,380 --> 03:46:04,620
You know, like, uh,

1923
03:46:05,960 --> 03:46:07,330
a father,

1924
03:46:08,800 --> 03:46:10,130
like a mother.

1925
03:46:11,140 --> 03:46:14,170
Be very careful
with the next thing you say.

1926
03:46:15,850 --> 03:46:17,840
Like an adopted son.

1927
03:46:21,610 --> 03:46:23,220
Isn't that right,

1928
03:46:24,780 --> 03:46:26,230
Batman?

1929
03:46:29,490 --> 03:46:30,900
Maybe, in a way,

1930
03:46:30,990 --> 03:46:32,700
that smelly old flounder is right.

1931
03:46:34,530 --> 03:46:37,280
Because how many can die in your arms

1932
03:46:37,370 --> 03:46:38,830
before you grow numb to death?

1933
03:46:40,420 --> 03:46:42,280
That's not very careful.

1934
03:46:43,540 --> 03:46:46,660
And how many dead eyes
can you look into

1935
03:46:47,380 --> 03:46:49,750
before you die inside yourself?

1936
03:46:50,300 --> 03:46:53,960
I've been dead inside a long time,

1937
03:46:54,140 --> 03:46:56,050
but even I have a limit.

1938
03:46:56,220 --> 03:46:58,080
And if you cross that line,
I swear to god, I will...

1939
03:46:58,100 --> 03:47:00,390
Before what, Bruce? Kill me?

1940
03:47:01,100 --> 03:47:02,890
You won't kill me.

1941
03:47:03,770 --> 03:47:05,730
I'm your best friend.

1942
03:47:06,230 --> 03:47:10,270
Besides, who's gonna give you
a reach-around?

1943
03:47:12,280 --> 03:47:13,650
Anyway,

1944
03:47:14,950 --> 03:47:16,490
you heed me.

1945
03:47:17,540 --> 03:47:19,030
You

1946
03:47:19,580 --> 03:47:22,450
need me to help you undo this world

1947
03:47:22,540 --> 03:47:25,200
you created by letting her die.

1948
03:47:27,800 --> 03:47:29,040
Poor Lois.

1949
03:47:29,840 --> 03:47:32,630
How she suffered so!

1950
03:47:38,520 --> 03:47:39,970
I often wonder

1951
03:47:40,930 --> 03:47:42,800
how many alternate timelines

1952
03:47:42,890 --> 03:47:45,060
do you destroy the world because...

1953
03:47:46,230 --> 03:47:50,400
Frankly, you don't have
the cojones to die yourself.

1954
03:47:51,400 --> 03:47:52,810
Hmm?

1955
03:47:54,990 --> 03:47:58,780
So, as usual, I'll be the bigger man.

1956
03:48:02,620 --> 03:48:04,080
A truce,

1957
03:48:04,920 --> 03:48:06,200
Bruce.

1958
03:48:08,960 --> 03:48:13,050
As long as you have this card, a truce.

1959
03:48:16,090 --> 03:48:18,090
But all you have to do
is tear it in half

1960
03:48:18,180 --> 03:48:19,450
and I'm happy to discuss with you

1961
03:48:19,470 --> 03:48:22,460
in any way you like,
why you sent a boy wonder...

1962
03:48:24,230 --> 03:48:26,060
To do a man's job.

1963
03:48:29,480 --> 03:48:31,270
You know, it's funny

1964
03:48:31,440 --> 03:48:32,810
that you would talk about people

1965
03:48:32,900 --> 03:48:34,480
who died in my arms

1966
03:48:34,650 --> 03:48:36,360
because when I held Harley Quinn

1967
03:48:36,530 --> 03:48:38,990
and she was bleeding and dying,

1968
03:48:39,160 --> 03:48:42,700
she begged me with her last breath

1969
03:48:42,870 --> 03:48:45,110
that when I killed you,

1970
03:48:45,290 --> 03:48:48,700
and make no mistake,
I will fucking kill you...

1971
03:48:48,880 --> 03:48:50,710
That I'd do it slow.

1972
03:48:51,920 --> 03:48:53,880
I'm gonna honor that promise.

1973
03:49:24,500 --> 03:49:27,240
Oh. You're good.

1974
03:49:31,540 --> 03:49:33,130
You almost had me.

1975
03:49:52,610 --> 03:49:53,690
Where are we holing up?

1976
03:49:53,860 --> 03:49:56,100
Somewhere he'll never suspect.

1977
03:49:56,570 --> 03:49:59,480
Still think it was a good idea
bringing him along?

1978
03:49:59,570 --> 03:50:02,110
What do you think?

1979
03:50:08,210 --> 03:50:09,210
He's found us.

1980
03:51:38,380 --> 03:51:39,840
Can I help you?

1981
03:51:41,220 --> 03:51:44,710
I'm sure you know darkseid
is not finished with earth.

1982
03:51:44,890 --> 03:51:47,880
The anti-life equation
is here somewhere.

1983
03:51:48,060 --> 03:51:50,840
We have to find it before he does.

1984
03:51:51,020 --> 03:51:52,720
There's a war coming.

1985
03:51:53,020 --> 03:51:54,760
And I'm here to help.

1986
03:51:54,940 --> 03:51:57,180
I'm sorry, who are you again?

1987
03:51:57,360 --> 03:51:59,560
I've gone by many names

1988
03:51:59,650 --> 03:52:02,440
and taken many forms. And like you,

1989
03:52:03,070 --> 03:52:05,690
I've realized
I have a stake in this world

1990
03:52:05,870 --> 03:52:08,320
and it's time I started fighting for it.

1991
03:52:09,080 --> 03:52:10,190
Oh.

1992
03:52:11,870 --> 03:52:13,990
Well, we could definitely use the help.

1993
03:52:14,210 --> 03:52:17,420
So, glad you're here.

1994
03:52:18,670 --> 03:52:19,670
You know, I never thought

1995
03:52:19,750 --> 03:52:20,950
I'd see the defenders of earth

1996
03:52:21,010 --> 03:52:23,170
united and fighting as one.

1997
03:52:24,180 --> 03:52:26,540
It wouldn't have happened
without you, Bruce.

1998
03:52:28,010 --> 03:52:30,380
Your mother and father would be proud.

1999
03:52:31,770 --> 03:52:32,930
I hope so.

2000
03:52:38,980 --> 03:52:41,940
Well, I'll be in touch.

2001
03:52:42,990 --> 03:52:47,030
Oh, and some have called me

2002
03:52:47,200 --> 03:52:49,480
the martian manhunter.

2003
03:52:57,210 --> 03:52:59,540
I guess I'll see you around.

2004
03:56:42,140 --> 03:56:45,880
['Ve heard there was a secret chord

2005
03:56:47,110 --> 03:56:51,060
that David played
and it pleased the lord

2006
03:56:51,900 --> 03:56:57,360
but you don't really care
for music, do ya?

2007
03:56:59,910 --> 03:57:03,530
It goes like this
the fourth, the fifth

2008
03:57:03,620 --> 03:57:07,530
the minor fall, the major lift

2009
03:57:07,630 --> 03:57:13,790
the baffled king composing "hallelujah"

2010
03:57:15,630 --> 03:57:21,760
hallelujah

2011
03:57:23,020 --> 03:57:31,020
hallelujah

2012
03:57:35,150 --> 03:57:39,190
your faith was strong
but you needed proof

2013
03:57:39,780 --> 03:57:43,200
you saw her bathing on the roof

2014
03:57:43,290 --> 03:57:47,830
her beauty and the moonlight
overthrew ya

2015
03:57:50,790 --> 03:57:54,160
she tied you to a kitchen chair

2016
03:57:54,340 --> 03:57:58,300
she broke your throne
and she cut your hair

2017
03:57:58,380 --> 03:58:04,930
and from your lips
she drew the hallelujah

2018
03:58:05,180 --> 03:58:11,940
hallelujah

2019
03:58:12,940 --> 03:58:20,940
hallelujah

2020
03:58:25,040 --> 03:58:29,000
well, baby, I've been here before

2021
03:58:29,420 --> 03:58:33,660
I've seen this room
and I've walked this floor

2022
03:58:33,750 --> 03:58:38,370
I used to live alone before I knew you

2023
03:58:41,430 --> 03:58:45,300
and I've seen your flag
on the marble arch

2024
03:58:45,390 --> 03:58:49,100
and love is not a victory march

2025
03:58:49,350 --> 03:58:56,060
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

2026
03:58:56,650 --> 03:59:03,200
hallelujah

2027
03:59:04,490 --> 03:59:12,490
hallelujah

2028
03:59:17,880 --> 03:59:21,460
Well, there was a time
when you would let me know

2029
03:59:22,590 --> 03:59:26,680
what's really going on below

2030
03:59:27,100 --> 03:59:32,180
but now you never
show that to me, do you?

2031
03:59:35,270 --> 03:59:38,810
And remember when I moved in you

2032
03:59:38,900 --> 03:59:42,640
the holy dove was moving, too

2033
03:59:42,780 --> 03:59:49,320
and every breath we drew was hallelujah

2034
03:59:50,660 --> 03:59:56,960
hallelujah

2035
03:59:58,340 --> 04:00:06,340
hallelujah

2036
04:00:23,990 --> 04:00:28,650
Well, maybe there's a god above

2037
04:00:31,290 --> 04:00:36,030
but all I've ever learned from love

2038
04:00:37,920 --> 04:00:40,540
was how to shoot at somebody

2039
04:00:41,920 --> 04:00:45,710
who outdrew you

2040
04:00:47,720 --> 04:00:51,680
and it's not a cry
that you hear at night

2041
04:00:51,890 --> 04:00:55,930
it's not somebody who's seen the light

2042
04:00:56,100 --> 04:00:57,890
it's a cold

2043
04:00:57,980 --> 04:01:04,770
and it's a broken hallelujah

2044
04:01:05,240 --> 04:01:13,240
hallelujah

2045
04:01:22,550 --> 04:01:28,830
Hallelujah

2046
04:01:30,600 --> 04:01:32,630
hallelujah

2047
04:01:34,230 --> 04:01:40,470
hallelujah
