1
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,378
<i>This is the Asgardian
refugee vessel.</i>

2
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,688
<i>We are under assault. I
repeat, we are under assault.</i>

3
00:00:20,962 --> 00:00:23,727
<i>Aliens are dead, sliced open...</i>

4
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:28,470
<i>Requesting aid from any
vessel within range...</i>

5
00:00:31,704 --> 00:00:36,449
<i>Our crew is made of Asgardian
families, we have very few soldiers here.</i>

6
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,451
<i>This is not a war craft, I
repeat, this is not a war craft.</i>

7
00:00:53,514 --> 00:00:56,732
Hear me... and rejoice.

8
00:01:00,318 --> 00:01:02,520
You have had the privilege

9
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,599
of being saved
by the Great Titan.

10
00:01:08,292 --> 00:01:10,846
You may think this is suffering.

11
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,251
No.

12
00:01:13,451 --> 00:01:16,004
It is salvation.

13
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,112
Universal scales

14
00:01:22,312 --> 00:01:25,899
tipped toward balance
because of your sacrifice.

15
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:28,741
Smile

16
00:01:28,941 --> 00:01:31,585
for even in death

17
00:01:31,885 --> 00:01:34,822
you have become
Children of Thanos.

18
00:01:49,823 --> 00:01:52,728
I know what it's like to lose.

19
00:01:53,764 --> 00:01:57,680
To feel so desperately
that you're right,

20
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,328
yet to fail nonetheless.

21
00:02:08,327 --> 00:02:10,455
As lightning

22
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:13,673
turns the legs to jelly.

23
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,804
I ask you
to what end?

24
00:02:19,359 --> 00:02:22,640
Dread it, run from it...

25
00:02:22,902 --> 00:02:25,464
Destiny arrives all the same.

26
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:28,493
And now, it's here.

27
00:02:28,803 --> 00:02:30,769
Or should I say...

28
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:33,800
I am.

29
00:02:38,938 --> 00:02:41,133
You talk too much.

30
00:02:41,758 --> 00:02:43,305
The Tesseract.

31
00:02:43,505 --> 00:02:45,992
Or, your brother's head.

32
00:02:50,405 --> 00:02:52,647
I assume you have a preference?

33
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:55,412
Oh, I do.

34
00:02:57,834 --> 00:02:59,169
Kill away.

35
00:03:14,016 --> 00:03:15,664
All right, stop!

36
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:22,991
We don't have the Tesseract.
It was destroyed on Asgard.

37
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:37,171
You really are the worst, brother.

38
00:03:41,344 --> 00:03:45,703
I assure you, brother. The
sun will shine on us again.

39
00:03:47,218 --> 00:03:50,586
Your optimism is
misplaced, Asgardian.

40
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,897
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.

41
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:56,409
And for another...

42
00:03:57,957 --> 00:03:59,941
we have a Hulk.

43
00:04:11,821 --> 00:04:13,719
Let him have his fun.

44
00:05:05,616 --> 00:05:07,366
Forefathers...

45
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:13,790
Let the dark magic, flow
through me one last... time.

46
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:30,849
That was a mistake.

47
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:37,540
No!

48
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:50,129
You are going to die for that!

49
00:06:01,042 --> 00:06:03,448
My humble personage...

50
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,089
bows before your grandeur.

51
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:13,028
No other being, has
ever had the might,

52
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:15,097
nay, the nobility,

53
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:20,737
to wield not one,
but two Infinity Stones.

54
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:25,329
The Universe,

55
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:28,645
lies within your grasp.

56
00:07:07,312 --> 00:07:10,999
There are two more
Stones on Earth.

57
00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:15,294
Find them, my Children, and
bring them to me on Titan.

58
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:19,521
- Father, we will not fail you.
- If I might, interject...

59
00:07:19,553 --> 00:07:21,006
If you're going to Earth,

60
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:23,631
you might want a guide.

61
00:07:23,632 --> 00:07:26,351
I do have a bit of
experience in that arena.

62
00:07:26,398 --> 00:07:28,835
If you consider failure experience.

63
00:07:29,035 --> 00:07:31,538
I consider experience, experience.

64
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:34,506
Almighty Thanos.

65
00:07:34,785 --> 00:07:39,773
I, Loki, Prince of Asgard...

66
00:07:43,093 --> 00:07:45,366
Odin-son...

67
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:50,617
The rightful king of Jotunheim,

68
00:07:50,881 --> 00:07:53,405
God of Mischief...

69
00:07:53,452 --> 00:07:55,703
Do hereby pledge to you,

70
00:07:56,402 --> 00:08:00,263
my undying fidelity.

71
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:13,043
"Undying"?

72
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:19,410
You should choose your
words more carefully.

73
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,308
You...

74
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:45,003
will never be...

75
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:48,128
a god.

76
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:17,115
No resurrections this time.

77
00:09:39,853 --> 00:09:42,673
No... Loki...

78
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:24,104
Seriously? You don't
have any money?

79
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:27,433
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.

80
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,817
I'll tell the guys at the deli.

81
00:10:28,853 --> 00:10:31,418
Maybe they'll make you a
metaphysical Ham and Rye.

82
00:10:31,443 --> 00:10:33,955
- Wait, wait. I think I got a 200.
- Dollars?

83
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,926
- Rupees.
- Which is?

84
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,795
I wouldn't say no
to a Tuna Melt.

85
00:10:53,997 --> 00:10:55,747
Thanos is coming.

86
00:10:56,325 --> 00:10:57,926
We've got to...

87
00:11:02,017 --> 00:11:03,143
Who?

88
00:11:12,448 --> 00:11:14,151
Slow down. I'm
totally not kidding.

89
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:15,441
- No, I'm not.
- Your rambling lost me.

90
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:18,510
Look, you know how you're having a
dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?

91
00:11:18,535 --> 00:11:19,275
Yeah.

92
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:21,542
Okay, then you're like, my
God, there's no bathroom,

93
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:22,996
what am I gonna do? Oh!
Someone's watching!

94
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,991
Right. And then you wake up, and in
real life you actually have to pee.

95
00:11:26,016 --> 00:11:27,356
- Yes.
- Yeah.

96
00:11:27,383 --> 00:11:28,440
Everybody has that.

97
00:11:28,452 --> 00:11:30,844
Right. That's the point
I'm trying to make.

98
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,687
Last night, I dreamt,
we had a kid.

99
00:11:34,907 --> 00:11:36,306
So real.

100
00:11:36,506 --> 00:11:38,375
We named him after
your eccentric uncle.

101
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:41,375
- What was his name? Porsey. Morgan.
- Right.

102
00:11:41,696 --> 00:11:45,283
So you woke up,
and we were...

103
00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:46,558
- Expecting.
- Yeah.

104
00:11:46,566 --> 00:11:47,473
- Yes?
- No.

105
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,951
- I had a dream about it. It was so real.
- If you wanted to have a kid...

106
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:53,019
You wouldn't have done that.

107
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:54,249
I'm glad you brought this up

108
00:11:54,326 --> 00:11:56,958
cause it's nothing,
just a housing unit for nano-parts.

109
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:59,681
- It's not helping your case. OK?
- It's an attachment. It's not a...

110
00:11:59,705 --> 00:12:02,290
- You don't need that.
- I know. I had the surgery.

111
00:12:02,314 --> 00:12:05,363
I'm just trying to protect us.
The future, as is, and that's it.

112
00:12:05,388 --> 00:12:08,075
Just in case there's a monster in
the closet. Just letting you know.

113
00:12:08,106 --> 00:12:09,693
Shirts.

114
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:12,512
You know me so well.

115
00:12:12,911 --> 00:12:14,766
You finish all my sentences.

116
00:12:15,021 --> 00:12:17,887
You should have shirts
in your closet.

117
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:20,686
Yeah. You know what
there should be?

118
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:23,625
No more surprises. We'll
have a nice dinner tonight.

119
00:12:25,898 --> 00:12:28,907
We should have no more surprises.
Ever. I should promise you.

120
00:12:28,932 --> 00:12:30,588
- Yeah.
- I will.

121
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,466
Tony Stark,
I'm Dr. Stephen Strange.

122
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,048
I need you to come with me.

123
00:12:40,048 --> 00:12:42,813
Oh. Congratulations on
the wedding, by the way.

124
00:12:42,838 --> 00:12:44,896
I'm sorry. You giving
out tickets or something?

125
00:12:44,906 --> 00:12:46,222
We need your help.

126
00:12:46,806 --> 00:12:50,266
Look, it's not overselling it to say that
the fate of the Universe is at stake.

127
00:12:50,283 --> 00:12:52,821
And who's "we"?

128
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:56,290
- Hey, Tony.
- Bruce!

129
00:13:00,415 --> 00:13:02,633
You okay?

130
00:13:03,726 --> 00:13:05,776
From the dawn of the Universe,

131
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:09,632
there was nothing.
Then, boom!

132
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:13,702
The Big Bang sends
six elemental crystals,

133
00:13:13,902 --> 00:13:16,855
hurdling across the virgin Universe.

134
00:13:17,777 --> 00:13:19,251
These Infinity Stones

135
00:13:19,351 --> 00:13:22,244
each control an essential
aspect of existence.

136
00:13:23,246 --> 00:13:24,745
Space.

137
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,284
Reality.

138
00:13:28,338 --> 00:13:29,908
Power.

139
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,111
Soul.

140
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:34,729
Mind.

141
00:13:36,128 --> 00:13:38,135
And Time.

142
00:13:47,055 --> 00:13:49,640
- Tell me his name again.
- Thanos.

143
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,094
He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

144
00:13:53,118 --> 00:13:57,000
He wipes out half the population.
He sent Loki.

145
00:13:57,758 --> 00:14:00,430
The attack on New York. That's him.

146
00:14:03,575 --> 00:14:05,434
- What's our time line?
- No telling.

147
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:07,109
He has the Power and Space Stones,

148
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:09,785
that only makes him the strongest
creature in the whole Universe.

149
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,709
If he gets his hands, on
all six Stones, Tony...

150
00:14:12,734 --> 00:14:16,615
He can destroy life on a scale
of hitherto hundredth of.

151
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,491
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto hundredth of"?

152
00:14:18,515 --> 00:14:20,848
Are you seriously leaning on
the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

153
00:14:20,948 --> 00:14:21,959
Is that what that is?

154
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:26,906
I'm going to allow that.

155
00:14:28,964 --> 00:14:30,129
If Thanos needs all six,

156
00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:32,262
why don't we just stick this
one down the garbage disposal?

157
00:14:32,362 --> 00:14:33,097
No can do.

158
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:36,338
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.

159
00:14:36,363 --> 00:14:39,713
And I swore off dairy, but Ben &
Jerry's named a flavor after me, so...

160
00:14:39,722 --> 00:14:41,501
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- It's not bad.

161
00:14:41,526 --> 00:14:42,777
A bit chalky.

162
00:14:42,977 --> 00:14:44,776
"A Hunka-Hulka Burning
Fudge" is our favorite.

163
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:47,463
- That's a thing?
- Whatever. Point is, things change.

164
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:50,144
Our oath to protect the
Time Stone cannot change.

165
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:52,359
This Stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.

166
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:55,418
And still conversely, it may also be
his best chance against us!

167
00:14:55,443 --> 00:14:57,088
Only if we don't do our jobs.

168
00:14:57,113 --> 00:15:00,238
What is your job exactly,
besides making balloon animals?

169
00:15:00,594 --> 00:15:03,366
Protecting your
reality, douche bag.

170
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:06,531
Okay guys, can we quick cable
this discussion right now?

171
00:15:06,556 --> 00:15:09,930
The fact is we have the stone.
We know where it is.

172
00:15:09,947 --> 00:15:12,415
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone.

173
00:15:12,418 --> 00:15:14,447
And we have to find him now.

174
00:15:14,892 --> 00:15:17,540
- Yeah, that's the thing.
- What do you mean?

175
00:15:17,564 --> 00:15:21,001
Two weeks ago, Vision turned off
his transponder. He's offline.

176
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,189
What?

177
00:15:22,362 --> 00:15:25,985
- Tony, you lost another super bot?
- I didn't lose him. He's more than that.

178
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,908
- He's evolving.
- Who could find Vision, then?

179
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,733
- Probably Steve Rogers.
- Oh, great.

180
00:15:35,757 --> 00:15:38,530
Maybe. But...

181
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,695
Call him.

182
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,655
It's not that easy.

183
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,572
God, we haven't caught up in a spell,
have we?

184
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,586
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.

185
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:53,327
Broke up?

186
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:59,093
- Like a band? Like The Beatles?
- Cap and I fell out hard.

187
00:15:59,703 --> 00:16:01,921
We're not on speaking terms.

188
00:16:02,414 --> 00:16:05,218
Tony, listen to me.

189
00:16:05,922 --> 00:16:08,249
Thor's gone.

190
00:16:08,984 --> 00:16:12,804
Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.

191
00:16:51,034 --> 00:16:54,518
Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to
be moving your hair, would you?

192
00:16:54,611 --> 00:16:57,033
Not at the moment, no.

193
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:30,627
You okay?

194
00:17:32,253 --> 00:17:35,120
- Help him. Wong, Doc.
- Got it.

195
00:17:35,145 --> 00:17:38,152
- Friday, what am I looking at?
- Not sure. I'm working on it.

196
00:17:38,177 --> 00:17:41,598
You better not put that Time
Stone in your back pocket, Doc!

197
00:17:41,623 --> 00:17:43,520
I might wanna use it.

198
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:12,740
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.

199
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,060
Holy shit!

200
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,590
We're all gonna die!
There's a spaceship!

201
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:28,493
What's the matter with you kids?

202
00:18:28,532 --> 00:18:31,042
You never seen a spaceship before?

203
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:46,544
Friday, evac anyone south of 43rd
Street, notify first responders.

204
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,724
Will do.

205
00:19:15,778 --> 00:19:19,215
Hear me, and rejoice!

206
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:24,372
You are about to die at the hands
of the Children of Thanos.

207
00:19:24,676 --> 00:19:29,293
Be thankful, that your meaningless
lives are now contributing to...

208
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:32,340
I'm sorry, Earth is closed today.

209
00:19:32,356 --> 00:19:35,187
You better pack it up
and get outta here.

210
00:19:35,287 --> 00:19:36,699
Stone keeper...

211
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,412
Does this chattering
animal speak for you?

212
00:19:39,437 --> 00:19:41,368
Certainly not. I speak for myself.

213
00:19:41,646 --> 00:19:44,897
There's no trespassing in
this city and on this planet.

214
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:48,515
- You need to get lost, Squidward!
- They exhaust me.

215
00:19:48,585 --> 00:19:50,389
Bring me the Stone.

216
00:19:51,726 --> 00:19:53,780
Hey, do you want a piece?

217
00:19:54,522 --> 00:19:58,061
No, not really. But when
do I ever get what I want.

218
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:03,779
Been a while. Good
to have you, buddy.

219
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:07,630
I just... I need to
concentrate for a second.

220
00:20:07,655 --> 00:20:09,613
Come on, come on, Max.

221
00:20:12,282 --> 00:20:14,492
Where's your guy?

222
00:20:14,962 --> 00:20:16,735
I don't know. We're
certainly having a thing.

223
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,385
There's no time for a thing. That's
the thing right there. Let's go.

224
00:20:26,465 --> 00:20:29,183
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.

225
00:20:29,215 --> 00:20:31,683
- I can't... He won't...
- It's okay. Stand down.

226
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,950
- Can I leave you with him? Thank you.
- I have him.

227
00:21:02,412 --> 00:21:07,012
- Where'd that come from?
- It's nano-tech. You like it? A little...

228
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:13,354
Dr. Banner, if the rest of your
green friend won't be joining us...

229
00:21:22,602 --> 00:21:25,711
- You gotta get that stone outta here, now.
- It stays with me.

230
00:21:25,736 --> 00:21:27,368
Exactly. Bye!

231
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:39,135
Tony, you okay? How we doing?
Good, bad?

232
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,341
Really good. Do you plan on helping out?

233
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:43,354
I'm trying. He won't come out.

234
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:55,893
Come on, Hulk. What
are you doing?

235
00:21:55,963 --> 00:21:58,338
Come on. Come on! Come on!

236
00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:00,806
No!

237
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:07,283
What do you mean, "no"?

238
00:22:12,018 --> 00:22:15,166
- Hey, man! What's up, Mr. Stark?
- Kid, where'd you come from?

239
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,385
The field trip.

240
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,075
What is this guy's problem, Mr.
Stark?

241
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,701
He's from space, came here to
steal a necklace from a wizard.

242
00:22:50,851 --> 00:22:55,546
Your powers are quaint. You
must be popular with children.

243
00:22:57,374 --> 00:22:59,677
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.

244
00:22:59,677 --> 00:23:01,888
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.

245
00:23:13,923 --> 00:23:19,704
You wouldn't. Removing a dead
man's spell... Troublesome.

246
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,102
You'll only wish you were dead.

247
00:23:31,721 --> 00:23:33,143
No!

248
00:23:36,518 --> 00:23:39,111
- Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.
- On it!

249
00:23:47,254 --> 00:23:49,613
Not cool.

250
00:24:03,747 --> 00:24:08,637
- Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up.
- Hang on, kid.

251
00:24:28,282 --> 00:24:31,110
Wong, you're invited
to my wedding.

252
00:24:37,723 --> 00:24:39,871
Give me a little juice, Friday.

253
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:49,966
Unlock 17-A.

254
00:25:02,191 --> 00:25:04,823
Kid, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.

255
00:25:04,835 --> 00:25:06,675
But you said save the wizard!

256
00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:08,496
I can't breathe!

257
00:25:08,521 --> 00:25:11,261
You're too high up. You're
running out of air.

258
00:25:12,425 --> 00:25:14,682
That makes sense.

259
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,066
Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here.

260
00:25:33,091 --> 00:25:36,364
- Happy trails, kid. Friday, send him home.
- Yup.

261
00:25:36,372 --> 00:25:37,981
Oh, come on!

262
00:25:45,905 --> 00:25:48,201
Boss, incoming call
from Miss Potts.

263
00:25:48,227 --> 00:25:50,727
Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right?
What's going on?

264
00:25:50,752 --> 00:25:53,758
Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we
might have to push our 8:30 res.

265
00:25:53,774 --> 00:25:54,476
Why?

266
00:25:54,476 --> 00:25:57,821
Just 'cause I'll probably
not make it back for awhile.

267
00:25:58,244 --> 00:26:00,626
- Tell me you're not on that ship.
- Yeah.

268
00:26:00,651 --> 00:26:02,976
God, no. Please tell me
you're not on that ship.

269
00:26:02,988 --> 00:26:04,408
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

270
00:26:04,424 --> 00:26:05,871
I don't know how to say this. Pep...

271
00:26:05,971 --> 00:26:07,799
Come back here, Tony. I swear to God...
Come back here right now!

272
00:26:08,713 --> 00:26:10,087
Come back!

273
00:26:10,088 --> 00:26:14,634
Boss, we're losing her.
I'm going, too...

274
00:26:23,127 --> 00:26:25,408
Oh, my God.

275
00:26:28,815 --> 00:26:31,620
I should have stayed on the bus.

276
00:26:45,106 --> 00:26:48,535
- Where you going?
- Time Stone's been taken.

277
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,850
The Sanctum remains unguarded.

278
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,348
What will you do?

279
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,961
I'm gonna make a call.

280
00:27:35,081 --> 00:27:37,127
Sing it, Drax!

281
00:27:48,939 --> 00:27:50,493
Why are we doing this again?

282
00:27:50,518 --> 00:27:53,213
It's a distress signal, Rocket.
Someone could be dying.

283
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:57,221
- I get that, but why are we doing it?
- 'Cause we're nice.

284
00:27:57,385 --> 00:28:00,169
And maybe whoever it is will give us a
little cheddar cheese for our help...

285
00:28:00,193 --> 00:28:03,784
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point... I mean...

286
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:05,944
- If he doesn't pony up...
- We'll take his ship.

287
00:28:05,969 --> 00:28:09,918
- Exactly! Alright!
- B-b-b-bingo!

288
00:28:11,964 --> 00:28:14,097
We are arriving.

289
00:28:14,122 --> 00:28:16,588
All right, Guardians.
Don't forget, this might

290
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,026
be dangerous, so let's
put on our mean faces.

291
00:28:23,805 --> 00:28:27,621
Groot, put that thing away. Now.
I don't wanna tell you again. Groot.

292
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,301
I am Groot!

293
00:28:29,325 --> 00:28:31,606
- Whoa! Language!
- Wow!

294
00:28:31,631 --> 00:28:33,450
You got some acorns on you, kid.

295
00:28:33,475 --> 00:28:36,959
Ever since you got little
sap, you're a total d-hole.

296
00:28:36,991 --> 00:28:40,694
Keep it up, and I'm gonna
smash that thing to pieces!

297
00:28:47,436 --> 00:28:50,139
What happened?

298
00:28:52,792 --> 00:28:55,182
Oh, my God.

299
00:29:00,104 --> 00:29:02,635
Looks like we're
not getting paid.

300
00:29:04,346 --> 00:29:07,689
Wipers! Wipers! Get it off.

301
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:17,067
How the hell is this
dude still alive?

302
00:29:17,091 --> 00:29:20,716
He is not a dude. You're a dude.

303
00:29:20,818 --> 00:29:24,333
This... This is a man.

304
00:29:24,404 --> 00:29:28,029
- Handsome, muscular man.
- I'm muscular.

305
00:29:28,037 --> 00:29:31,029
Who are you kidding, Quill? You're
one sandwich away from fat.

306
00:29:31,037 --> 00:29:35,106
- Yeah, right. What?
- It's true. You have little weight...

307
00:29:36,724 --> 00:29:39,067
Gamora, do you think I'm...

308
00:29:41,216 --> 00:29:44,171
He is anxious. Angry.

309
00:29:44,371 --> 00:29:48,317
He feels tremendous
loss and guilt.

310
00:29:48,507 --> 00:29:51,499
It's like a pirate had
a baby with an angel.

311
00:29:51,524 --> 00:29:54,290
Wow. This is a real wake-up
call for me. Okay.

312
00:29:54,315 --> 00:29:55,560
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.

313
00:29:55,784 --> 00:29:58,269
I'm gonna commit.
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

314
00:29:58,365 --> 00:29:59,925
You know you can't eat
dumbbells, right?

315
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:03,813
It's like his muscles are
made of Cotati metal fiber.

316
00:30:03,825 --> 00:30:05,839
Stop massaging his muscles.

317
00:30:07,127 --> 00:30:08,962
Wake him up.

318
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,193
Wake.

319
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:32,235
Who the hell are you guys?

320
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:38,368
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal:

321
00:30:38,376 --> 00:30:42,172
To bring balance to the Universe
by wiping out half of all life.

322
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:47,251
He used to kill people planet by
planet, massacre by massacre.

323
00:30:47,267 --> 00:30:50,334
- Including my own.
- If he gets all six Infinity Stones,

324
00:30:50,373 --> 00:30:53,279
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers, like this.

325
00:30:53,596 --> 00:30:57,638
You seem to know a
great deal about Thanos.

326
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:01,088
Gamora... is the
daughter of Thanos.

327
00:31:04,246 --> 00:31:07,659
- Your father killed my brother.
- Oh, boy.

328
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:12,324
Stepfather. Technically, she
hates him as much as you do.

329
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,279
Thanos can be tough.

330
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:20,495
Look. Before my father died,
he told me I had a half-sister...

331
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,647
that he imprisoned in Hell.
Then she returned

332
00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:27,308
home, and stabbed me in the eye,
so... I had to kill her.

333
00:31:27,508 --> 00:31:29,311
It's life, there was nothing else.

334
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,264
- And I feel your pain.
- I feel your pain, as well.

335
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:37,844
I mean it's not a competition,
but I've been through a lot.

336
00:31:37,869 --> 00:31:42,900
My father killed my mother, then I had
to kill my father. And that was hard.

337
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:45,864
Probably even harder than
having to kill a sister.

338
00:31:45,889 --> 00:31:49,123
Plus, I, came out
with both of my eyes.

339
00:31:49,139 --> 00:31:51,896
I need a hammer, not a spoon...

340
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,839
How do I open this thing?

341
00:31:53,867 --> 00:31:57,921
Is there some sort of a
four-digit code maybe...

342
00:31:58,121 --> 00:32:00,968
- Maybe a birth date or something...
- What are you doing?

343
00:32:00,969 --> 00:32:02,216
Taking your pod.

344
00:32:03,712 --> 00:32:05,516
No, you're not!

345
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:11,590
You'll not, be taking
our pod today, sir.

346
00:32:12,122 --> 00:32:15,237
Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?

347
00:32:16,805 --> 00:32:18,186
- No.
- You are.

348
00:32:18,386 --> 00:32:21,155
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.

349
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,490
- No I'm not.
- He just did it again!

350
00:32:23,515 --> 00:32:26,469
This is my voice!

351
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:33,754
- Are you mocking me?
- Are you mocking me?

352
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:35,857
You just did it again.

353
00:32:35,904 --> 00:32:37,950
He's trying to copy me.

354
00:32:37,975 --> 00:32:41,333
Enough! We need to stop Thanos.

355
00:32:41,358 --> 00:32:44,153
Which means we need to find
out where he's going next.

356
00:32:44,165 --> 00:32:45,185
Nowhere.

357
00:32:45,366 --> 00:32:49,951
- He must be going somewhere.
- No. Nowhere? It's a place.

358
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:51,625
We've been there. It sucks.

359
00:32:51,825 --> 00:32:53,483
Excuse me, that's our food.

360
00:32:53,499 --> 00:32:55,788
- Not anymore.
- Thor...

361
00:32:55,813 --> 00:32:58,365
Why would he go to nowhere?

362
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:01,237
Because for years,
reality stone has been safely stored,

363
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,508
there with a man
we call the collector.

364
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,487
If it's with the Collector,
then it's not safe.

365
00:33:05,687 --> 00:33:07,312
Only an idiot would
give that man a stone.

366
00:33:07,355 --> 00:33:08,364
Or a genius.

367
00:33:08,464 --> 00:33:11,175
How do you know he's not going
for one of the other stones?

368
00:33:11,308 --> 00:33:14,136
There's six stones out there.

369
00:33:14,152 --> 00:33:17,996
Thanos already has the Power Stone
because he stole it last week,

370
00:33:18,021 --> 00:33:19,940
when he decimated Xandar.

371
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,265
He stole the Space Stone from me.

372
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,225
When he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.

373
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,234
The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth.
They're with the Avengers.

374
00:33:28,259 --> 00:33:30,580
- The Avengers?
- They're Earth's Mightiest Heroes.

375
00:33:30,605 --> 00:33:33,582
- Like Kevin Bacon?
- He may be on the team. I don't know.

376
00:33:33,782 --> 00:33:34,814
Haven't been there in a while.

377
00:33:35,168 --> 00:33:37,105
As for the Soul Stone,
no one's ever seen that.

378
00:33:37,305 --> 00:33:38,610
No one even knows where it is.

379
00:33:38,681 --> 00:33:42,188
Therefore, Thanos can't get it.
Therefore, he's going to Nowhere.

380
00:33:42,197 --> 00:33:45,610
Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone.
You're welcome.

381
00:33:45,626 --> 00:33:48,641
- Then we have to go to Nowhere now.
- Wrong.

382
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:52,252
- Where we have to go, is Nivadellir.
- That's a made up word.

383
00:33:52,277 --> 00:33:56,316
- Oh what's made up?
- Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

384
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,399
I mean, that place is a legend. They
make the most powerful,

385
00:33:59,411 --> 00:34:01,816
horrific weapons to ever
torment the Universe.

386
00:34:01,841 --> 00:34:03,991
I would very much like
to go there, please.

387
00:34:04,016 --> 00:34:06,271
The rabbit is correct, and
clearly the smartest one.

388
00:34:06,691 --> 00:34:07,592
Rabbit?

389
00:34:07,615 --> 00:34:10,125
Only Eitri the dwarf king can
make me the weapon I need.

390
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:12,567
- I assume you're the captain, sir?
- You're very perceptive.

391
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,810
You seem like a noble leader. Will you
join me on my quest to Nivadellir?

392
00:34:15,835 --> 00:34:19,613
Lemme just ask the captain. Wait a
second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go.

393
00:34:19,813 --> 00:34:22,256
- Wonderful.
- Except that I'm the captain.

394
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:23,812
- Quiet!
- And that's my backpack.

395
00:34:23,836 --> 00:34:26,413
- Quill, sit down.
- Look, this is my ship.

396
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:28,147
And I'm not going to...

397
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:31,553
Wait, what kind of weapon
are we talking about here?

398
00:34:31,562 --> 00:34:33,569
The Thanos killing kind.

399
00:34:33,594 --> 00:34:35,440
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

400
00:34:35,464 --> 00:34:37,635
No. You simply lack the
strength to wield them.

401
00:34:37,652 --> 00:34:40,195
Your bodies will crumble as you
minds collapse to the madness.

402
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:42,104
Is it weird that I wanna
do it even more now?

403
00:34:42,116 --> 00:34:43,239
A little bit. Yeah.

404
00:34:43,439 --> 00:34:46,088
If we don't go to Nowhere and
Thanos retrieves another stone,

405
00:34:46,112 --> 00:34:48,658
- he'll be too powerful to stop.
- He already is.

406
00:34:48,682 --> 00:34:50,469
I got it figured out.

407
00:34:50,494 --> 00:34:53,986
We got two ships, and the
largest go with the morons.

408
00:34:54,003 --> 00:34:56,310
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate-angel here,

409
00:34:56,335 --> 00:34:59,655
and the morons will go to
Nowhere to try and stop Thanos.

410
00:34:59,983 --> 00:35:02,249
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.

411
00:35:02,273 --> 00:35:04,022
For the record...

412
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:06,742
I know that you're only going with
him because it's where Thanos isn't.

413
00:35:06,766 --> 00:35:11,117
You know, you shouldn't talk
that way to your captain, Quill.

414
00:35:11,508 --> 00:35:13,327
Come on, Groot.

415
00:35:13,527 --> 00:35:15,984
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.

416
00:35:20,307 --> 00:35:23,885
I bid you farewell and
good luck, morons. Bye.

417
00:35:38,601 --> 00:35:39,734
Vis?

418
00:35:40,278 --> 00:35:42,036
Is it the stone again?

419
00:35:42,082 --> 00:35:44,319
It's as if it's speaking to me.

420
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,562
What does it say?

421
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:50,500
I don't... I don't know.
Something...

422
00:36:02,852 --> 00:36:05,227
Tell me what you feel.

423
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,706
I just feel you.

424
00:36:23,532 --> 00:36:25,484
So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow

425
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,828
to give us more time together
before you went back.

426
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,852
- What if I miss that train?
- There is an 11.

427
00:36:30,883 --> 00:36:33,633
What if I missed all the trains?

428
00:36:34,532 --> 00:36:36,625
What if this time,
I didn't go back?

429
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:39,275
- You gave Stark your word.
- I'd rather give it to you.

430
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,745
There are people who are expecting me
too, you know. We both made promises.

431
00:36:42,753 --> 00:36:44,440
Not to each other.

432
00:36:45,278 --> 00:36:46,721
Wanda...

433
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:50,660
Two years, we've stolen these moments,
trying to see if this could work.

434
00:36:50,685 --> 00:36:55,246
And... I don't know. You know what,
I'm just gonna speak for myself.

435
00:36:55,271 --> 00:36:59,763
- I, I... I think... It works.
- It works. It works.

436
00:37:02,201 --> 00:37:04,005
Stay.

437
00:37:10,963 --> 00:37:14,158
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

438
00:37:21,134 --> 00:37:23,196
What are they?

439
00:37:23,306 --> 00:37:26,493
What the stone was
warning me about.

440
00:37:35,543 --> 00:37:40,261
- I have to go.
- No. Vision. If that's true...

441
00:37:40,434 --> 00:37:43,371
Then maybe going isn't
the best idea.

442
00:37:43,965 --> 00:37:45,551
Wanda, I...

443
00:38:15,098 --> 00:38:18,425
The blade. It stopped
me from phasing.

444
00:38:18,809 --> 00:38:22,209
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.

445
00:38:29,647 --> 00:38:31,131
Vis!

446
00:38:39,779 --> 00:38:43,841
Give up the Stone,
and she lives.

447
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:22,534
Hands off.

448
00:39:39,572 --> 00:39:43,564
Come on. You gotta get up.
You gotta get up. Come on.

449
00:39:45,251 --> 00:39:47,633
We have to go.

450
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,961
- Please leave.
- You asked me to stay.

451
00:39:53,876 --> 00:39:56,126
I'm staying.

452
00:41:06,411 --> 00:41:08,137
- Get up.
- I can't.

453
00:41:08,184 --> 00:41:10,981
We don't wanna kill you.
But we will.

454
00:41:11,028 --> 00:41:14,106
You'll never get
the chance again.

455
00:41:29,063 --> 00:41:30,766
Can you stand?

456
00:41:35,523 --> 00:41:38,351
Thank you, Captain.

457
00:41:39,464 --> 00:41:42,062
Let's get you on the jet.

458
00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:48,430
I thought
we had a deal.

459
00:41:48,485 --> 00:41:52,344
Stay close, check in.
Don't take any chances.

460
00:41:52,438 --> 00:41:56,445
I'm sorry. We just wanted time.

461
00:41:58,633 --> 00:42:00,727
Where to, Cap?

462
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,500
Home.

463
00:42:07,531 --> 00:42:09,749
We'll be safe.

464
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:36,965
- Zen-Whoberians...
- Mother!

465
00:42:37,005 --> 00:42:40,278
- Choose a side, or die.
- Mother!

466
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:45,870
One side, for reservation.
The other, an honor...

467
00:42:46,917 --> 00:42:49,220
What's wrong, little one?

468
00:42:49,245 --> 00:42:53,213
My mother. Where is my mother?

469
00:42:57,009 --> 00:42:59,247
What's your name?

470
00:42:59,615 --> 00:43:01,763
Gamora.

471
00:43:01,896 --> 00:43:05,216
You're quite the
fighter, Gamora.

472
00:43:05,614 --> 00:43:09,512
Come. Let me help you.

473
00:43:21,341 --> 00:43:23,231
Look.

474
00:43:26,185 --> 00:43:30,309
Pretty, isn't it?
Perfectly balanced.

475
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:32,450
As all things should be.

476
00:43:32,482 --> 00:43:37,426
Too much to one side,
or the other...

477
00:43:39,727 --> 00:43:43,648
Here. You try.

478
00:43:46,698 --> 00:43:51,104
Now go in peace, and
meet your maker.

479
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:57,436
Concentrate.

480
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:03,560
There! You've got it.

481
00:44:11,761 --> 00:44:13,448
Gamora.

482
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:17,917
You know these grenades are the
"blow off your junk" kind or the gas kind?

483
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,619
'Cause I was thinking I might hang
a couple on my belt right here.

484
00:44:20,643 --> 00:44:23,666
- But I don't want to...
- I need to ask a favor.

485
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:25,596
Yeah, sure.

486
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:30,443
One way or another, the path
that we're on leads to Thanos.

487
00:44:31,643 --> 00:44:34,369
Which is what the
grenades are for.

488
00:44:34,596 --> 00:44:36,796
I'm sorry. What's the favor?

489
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,899
If things go wrong...

490
00:44:41,188 --> 00:44:43,758
If Thanos gets me...

491
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:52,345
I want you to promise me...
you'll kill me.

492
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:54,134
What?

493
00:44:56,783 --> 00:44:59,751
I know something he doesn't.

494
00:45:01,752 --> 00:45:03,923
If he finds it out...

495
00:45:03,948 --> 00:45:07,244
- The entire Universe could be at risk.
- What do you know?

496
00:45:07,268 --> 00:45:10,174
If I tell you, you'd know, too.

497
00:45:12,148 --> 00:45:15,882
If it's so important,
shouldn't I?

498
00:45:15,907 --> 00:45:17,075
Only if you wanna die.

499
00:45:17,087 --> 00:45:19,938
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?

500
00:45:20,016 --> 00:45:21,446
Just...

501
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:26,446
trust me. And
possibly, kill me.

502
00:45:26,478 --> 00:45:30,790
I mean, I'd like to.
I really would...

503
00:45:30,938 --> 00:45:33,149
Swear to me.

504
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:38,604
Swear to me on your mother.

505
00:45:45,213 --> 00:45:47,025
Okay.

506
00:46:09,784 --> 00:46:12,526
Dude! How long have you
been standing there?

507
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:15,292
- An hour.
- An hour?

508
00:46:15,347 --> 00:46:17,010
Are you serious?

509
00:46:17,027 --> 00:46:22,831
I've mastered the ability, of
standing so incredibly still...

510
00:46:23,222 --> 00:46:27,830
That I've become invisible
to the eye. Watch.

511
00:46:31,211 --> 00:46:35,288
- You're eating a zark nut.
- But my movement...

512
00:46:35,414 --> 00:46:37,710
So slow...

513
00:46:37,758 --> 00:46:42,046
- And it's imperceptible.
- No.

514
00:46:42,101 --> 00:46:45,015
- I'm sure I'm invisible.
- Hi, Drax.

515
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:49,093
Damn it.

516
00:47:08,247 --> 00:47:11,863
- This place looks deserted.
- I'm reading movement.

517
00:47:11,888 --> 00:47:15,630
- From the third quadrant.
- Yeah. I'm picking that up, too.

518
00:47:16,576 --> 00:47:19,342
Let's put it down over here.

519
00:47:47,997 --> 00:47:50,677
I know you have the Reality Stone.

520
00:47:50,907 --> 00:47:55,512
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.

521
00:47:58,312 --> 00:48:02,522
I told you. I sold it.

522
00:48:04,456 --> 00:48:09,690
- Why would I lie?
- I imagine it's like breathing for you.

523
00:48:10,104 --> 00:48:13,994
- Like suicide.
- So you do understand.

524
00:48:14,034 --> 00:48:16,877
Not even you will surrender
something so precious.

525
00:48:16,909 --> 00:48:19,041
I didn't know what it was.

526
00:48:19,049 --> 00:48:22,182
Then you're more of a
fool than I took you for.

527
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:25,244
Last chance, Charlotte.

528
00:48:26,054 --> 00:48:28,054
Where's the Stone?

529
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:33,155
Today, he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

530
00:48:33,187 --> 00:48:34,803
Drax, wait!

531
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:37,546
Whoa, not yet!

532
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:47,013
He doesn't have the Stone yet.

533
00:48:47,045 --> 00:48:49,349
We get it, and then
we can stop him.

534
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:52,233
We have to get the Stone first.
Yeah.

535
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:57,663
No. No. For Ovette.
For Camaria.

536
00:48:57,695 --> 00:48:59,577
Sleep.

537
00:49:10,801 --> 00:49:16,019
Okay. Gamora, Mantis,
you go right.

538
00:49:16,035 --> 00:49:19,339
I'm... The other right!

539
00:49:42,617 --> 00:49:45,195
Why?

540
00:49:54,171 --> 00:49:58,624
Why you? Daughter...

541
00:50:17,101 --> 00:50:19,288
That was quick.

542
00:50:23,824 --> 00:50:29,261
Magnificent! Magnificent!

543
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:34,769
Is it sadness I sense
in you, daughter?

544
00:50:36,941 --> 00:50:40,566
In my heart, I knew
you still cared.

545
00:50:46,772 --> 00:50:49,951
No one ever knows for sure.

546
00:50:59,328 --> 00:51:02,914
Reality is often disappointing.

547
00:51:05,377 --> 00:51:08,619
That is, it was.

548
00:51:09,611 --> 00:51:11,197
Now...

549
00:51:13,046 --> 00:51:16,499
Reality can be whatever I want.

550
00:51:17,163 --> 00:51:20,764
- You knew I'd come.
- I counted on it.

551
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:25,018
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.

552
00:51:28,806 --> 00:51:30,821
Thanos!

553
00:51:43,751 --> 00:51:47,477
- Let her go, Grimace!
- Peter...

554
00:51:48,158 --> 00:51:51,001
- I told you to go right.
- Now...

555
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,532
- You let her go!
- Ah, the boyfriend.

556
00:51:56,235 --> 00:52:00,453
I like to think of myself more as a
Titan-killing long term booty call.

557
00:52:00,477 --> 00:52:02,438
- Let her go.
- Peter...

558
00:52:02,462 --> 00:52:07,110
Or I'm gonna blow that nut-sack
of a chin right off your face!

559
00:52:07,509 --> 00:52:10,430
Not him.

560
00:52:19,613 --> 00:52:22,542
You promised!

561
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:32,099
Oh, daughter. You expect
too much from him.

562
00:52:35,386 --> 00:52:38,323
She's asked, hasn't she?

563
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,401
Do it.

564
00:52:48,136 --> 00:52:49,971
Do it!

565
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:59,174
I told you to go right!

566
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:03,041
I love you, more than anything.

567
00:53:05,947 --> 00:53:08,589
I love you, too.

568
00:53:21,575 --> 00:53:23,504
I like you.

569
00:53:53,598 --> 00:53:55,331
Still no word from Vision?

570
00:53:55,364 --> 00:53:58,020
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.

571
00:53:58,036 --> 00:54:02,004
On a stolen quinjet with four of
the world's most wanted criminals.

572
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,226
You know they're only criminals

573
00:54:03,426 --> 00:54:05,450
because you've chosen to call them that,
right, sir?

574
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:09,890
My God, Rhodes, your talent
for horseshit rivals my own.

575
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:13,357
If it weren't for those Accords,
Vision would've been right here.

576
00:54:13,365 --> 00:54:16,865
I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.

577
00:54:17,107 --> 00:54:18,722
That's right.

578
00:54:20,369 --> 00:54:22,122
And I'm pretty sure
I've paid for that.

579
00:54:22,147 --> 00:54:25,451
- Do you have second thoughts?
- Not anymore.

580
00:54:31,097 --> 00:54:34,370
Mr. Secretary.

581
00:54:37,043 --> 00:54:40,761
You got some nerve.
I'll give you that.

582
00:54:41,217 --> 00:54:43,730
You could use some
of that right now.

583
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:46,761
The world's on fire.

584
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:50,418
And you think, all is forgiven?

585
00:54:50,512 --> 00:54:55,277
I'm not looking for forgiveness. And
I'm way past asking for permission.

586
00:54:56,395 --> 00:55:01,378
Earth just lost her best defender.
So we're here to fight.

587
00:55:01,691 --> 00:55:04,300
And if you wanna
stand in our way...

588
00:55:04,887 --> 00:55:07,043
We'll fight you, too.

589
00:55:10,102 --> 00:55:13,664
- Arrest them.
- All over it.

590
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:21,030
That's a court-martial.

591
00:55:22,788 --> 00:55:26,492
- It's great to see you, Cap.
- You too, Rhodey.

592
00:55:26,517 --> 00:55:27,846
Hey.

593
00:55:29,587 --> 00:55:34,157
Well. You guys, really
look like crap.

594
00:55:34,212 --> 00:55:35,977
Must've been a rough
couple of years.

595
00:55:35,993 --> 00:55:39,125
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.

596
00:55:39,134 --> 00:55:41,438
I think you look great.

597
00:55:48,264 --> 00:55:50,599
Yeah. I'm back.

598
00:55:51,873 --> 00:55:53,482
Hi, Bruce.

599
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,978
Nat.

600
00:56:02,798 --> 00:56:05,368
This is awkward.

601
00:56:06,832 --> 00:56:08,733
We gotta assume they're
coming back, right?

602
00:56:08,745 --> 00:56:10,075
And they can clearly find us.

603
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:12,519
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?

604
00:56:12,527 --> 00:56:14,895
After the whole Accords
situation, he and Scott

605
00:56:14,907 --> 00:56:17,237
took a deal. It's too
tough on their families.

606
00:56:17,262 --> 00:56:18,808
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.

607
00:56:18,832 --> 00:56:21,230
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?

608
00:56:21,254 --> 00:56:22,254
Okay, look...

609
00:56:22,277 --> 00:56:25,277
Thanos has the biggest
army in the Universe.

610
00:56:25,293 --> 00:56:29,237
And he is not gonna
stop until he... He gets...

611
00:56:30,928 --> 00:56:31,935
Vision's stone.

612
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:35,912
- Well then, we have to protect it.
- No, we have to destroy it.

613
00:56:37,253 --> 00:56:41,706
I've been giving a good deal of thought to
this entity in my head about its nature.

614
00:56:41,722 --> 00:56:43,987
But also, its composition.

615
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:46,681
I think if it were exposed
to a sufficiently

616
00:56:46,693 --> 00:56:48,764
powerful energy
source, something,

617
00:56:48,789 --> 00:56:52,554
very similar to its own
signature, perhaps...

618
00:56:53,562 --> 00:56:56,484
Its molecular
integrity could fail.

619
00:56:56,617 --> 00:56:58,937
And you, with it.

620
00:56:59,031 --> 00:57:00,687
We're not having
this conversation.

621
00:57:00,699 --> 00:57:03,288
Eliminating the stone is the
only way to be certain that

622
00:57:03,313 --> 00:57:07,881
- Thanos can't get it.
- That's too high a price.

623
00:57:11,817 --> 00:57:15,348
Only you, have the
power to pay it.

624
00:57:18,497 --> 00:57:20,639
Thanos threatens
half the Universe.

625
00:57:20,664 --> 00:57:24,095
One life cannot stand in
the way of defeating him.

626
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,254
But it should.

627
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:28,490
We don't trade lives, Vision.

628
00:57:28,515 --> 00:57:32,873
Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down
your life to save millions of people.

629
00:57:32,898 --> 00:57:35,007
Tell me, why is
this any different?

630
00:57:35,038 --> 00:57:38,374
Because you might have a choice.

631
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:42,686
Your mind is made up of a
complex construct of overlays.

632
00:57:42,695 --> 00:57:46,431
Jarvis, Ultron, Tony,
me, the stone.

633
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:50,264
All of them mixed together. All of
them learning from one another.

634
00:57:50,289 --> 00:57:53,459
- You're saying Vision isn't just a stone?
- I'm saying that...

635
00:57:53,484 --> 00:57:57,194
If we take out the stone, there's
still a whole lot of Vision left.

636
00:57:57,203 --> 00:58:00,390
- Perhaps the best parts.
- Can we do that?

637
00:58:00,709 --> 00:58:02,443
Not me. Not here.

638
00:58:02,769 --> 00:58:05,787
Well you better find someone
and somewhere fast.

639
00:58:05,829 --> 00:58:09,704
Ross isn't just gonna let you
guys have your old rooms back.

640
00:58:11,212 --> 00:58:13,922
I know somewhere.

641
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:30,471
The Kingsguard and the Dora
Milaje have been alerted.

642
00:58:30,496 --> 00:58:32,315
And the Border Tribe?

643
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,784
Those that are left.

644
00:58:33,809 --> 00:58:36,527
Send word to the
Jabari as well.

645
00:58:36,567 --> 00:58:39,129
M'Baku likes a good fight.

646
00:58:40,512 --> 00:58:42,910
And what of this one?

647
00:58:43,159 --> 00:58:45,690
This one may be tired of war.

648
00:58:45,715 --> 00:58:49,636
But the White Wolf has
rested long enough.

649
00:59:11,461 --> 00:59:13,211
Where's the fight?

650
00:59:13,891 --> 00:59:15,679
On its way.

651
00:59:33,832 --> 00:59:37,339
In all the time I
have served Thanos...

652
00:59:38,266 --> 00:59:40,742
I have never failed him.

653
00:59:45,045 --> 00:59:48,443
If I were to reach our
rendezvous on Titan,

654
00:59:48,468 --> 00:59:52,225
with the Time Stone still attached
to your vaguely irritating person...

655
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:55,132
There would be judgment.

656
01:00:03,573 --> 01:00:05,494
Give me...

657
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:11,307
the Stone.

658
01:00:22,662 --> 01:00:25,599
Wow. You are a seriously
loyal piece of hardware.

659
01:00:25,615 --> 01:00:27,716
Speaking of loyalty...

660
01:00:28,076 --> 01:00:30,808
- I know what you're gonna say to me.
- You should not be here.

661
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:31,833
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it!

662
01:00:31,849 --> 01:00:34,547
But it was such a long way
down and I just thought about...

663
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:35,739
And now I gotta hear it.

664
01:00:35,763 --> 01:00:38,895
And this suit is, ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.

665
01:00:38,909 --> 01:00:42,020
So, if anything, its kind of
your fault that I'm here.

666
01:00:42,045 --> 01:00:43,646
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.

667
01:00:43,662 --> 01:00:45,209
And now I'm here in space.

668
01:00:45,221 --> 01:00:47,783
Yeah. Right where I
didn't want you to be.

669
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:50,081
This isn't Coney Island,
or some field trip.

670
01:00:50,093 --> 01:00:52,205
This is a one-way ticket.
Do you hear me?

671
01:00:52,229 --> 01:00:55,473
- Don't pretend you thought this through.
- I did think this through.

672
01:00:55,498 --> 01:00:59,810
You can't be a friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood.

673
01:01:01,162 --> 01:01:04,708
Okay, that didn't make sense but
you know what I'm trying to say.

674
01:01:06,363 --> 01:01:09,406
Come on. We got a situation.

675
01:01:09,558 --> 01:01:13,089
See him down there? He's in trouble.
What's your plan? Go.

676
01:01:13,613 --> 01:01:15,440
Okay, okay.

677
01:01:15,753 --> 01:01:18,581
OK, you ever see this
really old movie Aliens?

678
01:01:22,049 --> 01:01:24,768
Painful, aren't they?

679
01:01:25,173 --> 01:01:28,588
They were originally
designed for microsurgery.

680
01:01:28,712 --> 01:01:30,930
And any one of them...

681
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,406
I could end your friend's
life in an instant.

682
01:01:38,438 --> 01:01:40,555
I gotta tell you, he's
not really my friend.

683
01:01:40,563 --> 01:01:44,164
Saving his life is more of
a professional courtesy.

684
01:01:44,883 --> 01:01:46,735
You've saved nothing.

685
01:01:47,696 --> 01:01:51,289
Your powers are inconsequential
compared to mine.

686
01:01:51,305 --> 01:01:53,961
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.

687
01:02:06,238 --> 01:02:07,870
Yes!

688
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:10,393
Wait, what are those?

689
01:02:24,803 --> 01:02:27,178
Hey, we haven't officially met.

690
01:02:27,881 --> 01:02:29,014
Cool.

691
01:02:30,568 --> 01:02:34,427
- We gotta turn this ship around.
- Yeah. Now he wants to run.

692
01:02:34,443 --> 01:02:36,257
Great, I want to protect the stone.

693
01:02:36,282 --> 01:02:39,055
And I want you to thank me now.
Go ahead, I'm listening.

694
01:02:39,071 --> 01:02:42,039
For what? Nearly
blasting me to space?

695
01:02:42,048 --> 01:02:44,828
Who just saved your magical ass?
Me.

696
01:02:44,837 --> 01:02:47,080
I seriously don't know how you
fit your head into that helmet.

697
01:02:47,104 --> 01:02:49,423
Admit it. You should've ducked
out when I told you to.

698
01:02:49,431 --> 01:02:51,251
I tried to bench
you, you refused.

699
01:02:51,276 --> 01:02:53,509
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.

700
01:02:53,534 --> 01:02:56,052
And due to that fact,
we're now in a flying doughnut,

701
01:02:56,252 --> 01:02:57,405
billions of miles from Earth,

702
01:02:57,465 --> 01:02:58,629
- with no back-up.
- I'm back-up!

703
01:02:58,654 --> 01:03:01,632
No. You're a stowaway.
The adults are talking.

704
01:03:01,657 --> 01:03:05,898
I'm confused as to the relationship
here, I mean, what is he? Your ward?

705
01:03:05,923 --> 01:03:09,633
- No. I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.

706
01:03:09,658 --> 01:03:12,079
Oh, we're using our
made-up names.

707
01:03:12,104 --> 01:03:13,916
I'm Spider-Man, then.

708
01:03:14,135 --> 01:03:16,893
The ship is self-correcting its course.
Thing's on autopilot.

709
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:20,502
Can we control it? Fly us home?

710
01:03:23,827 --> 01:03:24,850
- Stark.
- Yeah?

711
01:03:24,874 --> 01:03:27,655
- Can you get us home?
- Yeah. Heard you.

712
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:31,936
I'm not so sure we should.

713
01:03:32,046 --> 01:03:36,240
Under no circumstances can we
bring the Time Stone to Thanos.

714
01:03:36,311 --> 01:03:38,873
I don't think you quite
understand what's at stake here.

715
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:41,232
No. It's you who doesn't
understand that

716
01:03:41,244 --> 01:03:43,819
Thanos has been inside
my head for six years

717
01:03:43,851 --> 01:03:47,194
since he sent an army to New
York, and now he's back!

718
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:49,289
And I don't know what to do.

719
01:03:49,448 --> 01:03:52,925
So I'm not so sure if it's a better
plan to fight him on our turf or his.

720
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:56,379
But you saw. What they
did, what they can do.

721
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,031
At least, let's hope
he's not expecting it.

722
01:03:59,067 --> 01:04:03,139
So I say we take the
fight to him, Doctor.

723
01:04:04,497 --> 01:04:06,629
Do you concur?

724
01:04:08,647 --> 01:04:11,889
All right, Stark. We go to him.

725
01:04:12,155 --> 01:04:14,342
But you have to understand...

726
01:04:14,515 --> 01:04:19,015
If it comes to saving you, the
kid, or the Time Stone...

727
01:04:19,070 --> 01:04:22,665
I will not hesitate to
let either of you die.

728
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:26,846
I can't. Because the
universe depends on it.

729
01:04:26,871 --> 01:04:30,347
Nice. Good. Moral compass.

730
01:04:33,197 --> 01:04:35,915
All right, kid...

731
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:39,414
You're an Avenger now.

732
01:05:14,012 --> 01:05:16,715
I thought you might be hungry.

733
01:05:28,435 --> 01:05:30,676
I always hated that chair.

734
01:05:30,691 --> 01:05:32,489
So I've been told.

735
01:05:32,765 --> 01:05:37,140
Even so, I hoped you'd
sit in it one day.

736
01:05:37,573 --> 01:05:41,354
I hated this room, this ship...

737
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:44,164
I hated my life.

738
01:05:47,413 --> 01:05:50,161
You told me that, too.

739
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:55,302
Everyday.

740
01:05:57,267 --> 01:05:59,985
For almost twenty years.

741
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,966
I was a child when you took me.

742
01:06:05,113 --> 01:06:07,488
I saved you.

743
01:06:09,957 --> 01:06:15,993
No. We were happy
on my home planet.

744
01:06:16,041 --> 01:06:19,907
Going to bed hungry?
Scrounging for scraps?

745
01:06:19,932 --> 01:06:24,822
Your planet was on the brink of collapse.
I'm the one who stopped that.

746
01:06:25,258 --> 01:06:27,422
You know what's happened since then?

747
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:31,494
The children born, have
known nothing but full

748
01:06:31,506 --> 01:06:35,126
bellies and clear skies.
It's a paradise.

749
01:06:36,706 --> 01:06:39,120
Because you murdered
half the planet.

750
01:06:39,145 --> 01:06:41,926
A small price to
pay for salvation.

751
01:06:42,043 --> 01:06:45,340
- You're insane.
- Little one, it's a simple calculus.

752
01:06:45,365 --> 01:06:48,575
This universe is finite.
Its resources, finite.

753
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:52,834
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

754
01:06:53,105 --> 01:06:57,097
- It needs correction.
- You don't know that!

755
01:06:57,269 --> 01:07:00,144
I'm the only one who knows that.

756
01:07:00,152 --> 01:07:04,839
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

757
01:07:06,114 --> 01:07:08,785
For a time...

758
01:07:09,489 --> 01:07:10,629
You...

759
01:07:11,918 --> 01:07:14,144
had that same will,

760
01:07:15,384 --> 01:07:19,817
as you fought by my side,
daughter.

761
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:23,210
I'm not your daughter.

762
01:07:24,633 --> 01:07:27,890
Everything I hated about
myself, you taught me.

763
01:07:28,094 --> 01:07:32,182
And in doing so, made you the
fiercest woman in the galaxy.

764
01:07:34,765 --> 01:07:38,382
It's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

765
01:07:40,945 --> 01:07:44,405
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

766
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:46,890
I am disappointed.

767
01:07:47,090 --> 01:07:49,937
But not because
you didn't find it.

768
01:07:53,754 --> 01:07:56,293
But because you did.

769
01:07:56,865 --> 01:07:59,089
And you lied.

770
01:08:15,742 --> 01:08:17,445
Nebula!

771
01:08:24,006 --> 01:08:25,522
Don't do this.

772
01:08:25,650 --> 01:08:29,954
Sometime ago, your sister snuck
aboard this ship to kill me.

773
01:08:29,979 --> 01:08:33,384
- Please, don't do this.
- She very nearly succeeded.

774
01:08:33,882 --> 01:08:38,569
So, I brought her here...
to talk.

775
01:08:45,447 --> 01:08:48,587
Stop. Stop it.

776
01:08:53,868 --> 01:08:56,469
I swear to you, on my life...

777
01:08:56,544 --> 01:09:00,396
I never found the Soul Stone.

778
01:09:03,197 --> 01:09:04,728
Accessing memory files.

779
01:09:04,753 --> 01:09:06,596
You know what he's about to do.

780
01:09:06,612 --> 01:09:09,674
He's finally ready, and he's going
for the stones. All of them.

781
01:09:09,683 --> 01:09:13,784
He'll never get them all.
He can't, Nebula.

782
01:09:13,809 --> 01:09:17,902
Because I found the map to the Soul
Stone, and I burned it to ash.

783
01:09:17,935 --> 01:09:20,583
I burned it.

784
01:09:24,052 --> 01:09:26,872
You're strong.

785
01:09:27,692 --> 01:09:29,731
Me...

786
01:09:31,583 --> 01:09:35,387
The generous... me...

787
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:40,062
But I never taught you to lie.

788
01:09:40,078 --> 01:09:42,999
That's why you're so bad at it.

789
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:49,187
Where is the Soul Stone?

790
01:10:06,601 --> 01:10:08,522
Vormir.

791
01:10:25,784 --> 01:10:27,987
The stone is on Vormir.

792
01:10:30,597 --> 01:10:33,518
Show me.

793
01:10:35,003 --> 01:10:36,229
I am Groot.

794
01:10:36,429 --> 01:10:38,647
Tinkle in the cup.
We're not looking for...

795
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:41,354
What's a twig?
Everybody's seen a twig.

796
01:10:41,358 --> 01:10:42,615
I am Groot!

797
01:10:42,715 --> 01:10:44,382
You can pour what's
in the cup out in space

798
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:45,639
then go in the cup again.

799
01:10:45,664 --> 01:10:46,799
You speak Groot?

800
01:10:46,999 --> 01:10:48,937
Yes, the tone on Asgard,
that was an elective.

801
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:52,062
- I am Groot.
- You'll know when we're close.

802
01:10:52,066 --> 01:10:56,769
Nivadellir's forge harnesses the
blazing power of the Neutron star.

803
01:10:59,197 --> 01:11:00,899
It's the birthplace of my hammer.

804
01:11:01,851 --> 01:11:03,261
It's truly awesome.

805
01:11:09,558 --> 01:11:12,902
Okay. Time to be the captain.

806
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:21,775
So dead brother, huh? Yeah,
that could be annoying.

807
01:11:22,198 --> 01:11:25,300
Well, he's been dead before.

808
01:11:25,339 --> 01:11:28,659
Now this time, I think
it really might be true.

809
01:11:28,667 --> 01:11:32,565
- And you said your sister and your dad...
- Both dead.

810
01:11:32,896 --> 01:11:36,560
- But still got a mom, though?
- Killed by a Dark Elf.

811
01:11:36,607 --> 01:11:40,286
- A best friend?
- Stabbed through the heart.

812
01:11:42,456 --> 01:11:46,096
You sure you're up to
this particular mission?

813
01:11:47,889 --> 01:11:49,249
Absolutely!

814
01:11:49,449 --> 01:11:52,209
The rage and vengeance, anger...

815
01:11:52,217 --> 01:11:55,116
Loss, regret, they're all
tremendous motivators.

816
01:11:55,128 --> 01:11:57,920
They really clear the
mind, so I'm good to go.

817
01:11:58,108 --> 01:12:01,038
Yeah, but this Thanos
we're talking about,

818
01:12:01,238 --> 01:12:03,061
he's the toughest there is.

819
01:12:03,086 --> 01:12:05,281
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.

820
01:12:05,306 --> 01:12:06,953
He's never fought me twice.

821
01:12:07,284 --> 01:12:09,852
I'm getting a new
hammer, don't forget.

822
01:12:09,877 --> 01:12:12,627
It better be some hammer.

823
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:19,115
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

824
01:12:19,139 --> 01:12:21,253
I've killed twice as many
enemies as that, and

825
01:12:21,265 --> 01:12:23,256
every one of them
would've rather killed me

826
01:12:23,281 --> 01:12:24,906
but none succeeded.

827
01:12:24,931 --> 01:12:27,899
I'm only alive because
fate wants me alive.

828
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,093
Thanos is just the, latest
in a long line of bastards

829
01:12:31,118 --> 01:12:35,302
and he will be the latest to feel
my vengeance. Fate wills it so.

830
01:12:36,296 --> 01:12:39,139
And what if you're wrong?

831
01:12:41,561 --> 01:12:44,076
Well, if I'm wrong, then...

832
01:12:44,458 --> 01:12:47,896
What more could I lose?

833
01:12:59,294 --> 01:13:03,754
I could lose a lot. Me
personally, I could lose a lot.

834
01:13:07,389 --> 01:13:08,951
Okay.

835
01:13:09,873 --> 01:13:13,676
Well, if fate does want you
to kill that crapsack,

836
01:13:13,701 --> 01:13:16,240
- you need more than one stupid eyeball.
- What's this?

837
01:13:16,265 --> 01:13:17,401
What's it look like?

838
01:13:17,824 --> 01:13:20,679
Some jerk lost a bet
with me in Contraxia.

839
01:13:20,687 --> 01:13:23,108
- He gave you his eye?
- No, he gave me 100 credits.

840
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:26,655
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.

841
01:13:27,921 --> 01:13:30,749
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

842
01:13:37,383 --> 01:13:39,821
I would've washed that.

843
01:13:39,846 --> 01:13:42,867
The only way I could sneak it
off Contraxia was on my...

844
01:13:43,379 --> 01:13:45,072
Hey, we're here.

845
01:13:49,265 --> 01:13:52,757
I don't think this thing works.
Everything seems dark.

846
01:13:53,894 --> 01:13:56,464
But it ain't the eye.

847
01:14:09,019 --> 01:14:13,800
Something's wrong.
The star's gone out.

848
01:14:13,831 --> 01:14:17,354
And the rings are frozen.

849
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:40,617
I hope these dwarfs are better at
forging than they are at cleaning.

850
01:14:44,827 --> 01:14:48,318
Maybe they realized they live in a
junk pile in the middle of space.

851
01:14:48,334 --> 01:14:51,756
The forge hasn't gone
dark in centuries.

852
01:14:53,374 --> 01:14:57,623
- You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?
- Yes. Why?

853
01:14:57,639 --> 01:15:00,670
Did it look anything like that?

854
01:15:02,959 --> 01:15:07,271
- I am Groot.
- Get back to the pod.

855
01:15:10,708 --> 01:15:13,856
Eitri, wait! Stop!

856
01:15:16,415 --> 01:15:17,907
Thor?

857
01:15:20,207 --> 01:15:25,191
- What happened here?
- You were supposed to protect us.

858
01:15:25,394 --> 01:15:31,286
- Asgard was supposed to protect us.
- Asgard is destroyed.

859
01:15:32,814 --> 01:15:36,689
Eitri, what did you do?

860
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:53,240
300 dwarfs lived on this ring.

861
01:15:53,419 --> 01:15:57,013
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.

862
01:15:59,044 --> 01:16:01,864
I made what he wanted.

863
01:16:02,201 --> 01:16:07,255
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.

864
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:14,128
And he killed everyone anyway.

865
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:18,441
All except me.

866
01:16:18,565 --> 01:16:21,846
"Your life is yours," he said.

867
01:16:21,871 --> 01:16:26,605
"But your hands. Your
hands are mine alone."

868
01:16:26,683 --> 01:16:29,394
Eitri, this isn't
about your hands.

869
01:16:29,714 --> 01:16:31,613
Every weapon you've
ever designed,

870
01:16:31,638 --> 01:16:35,793
every axe, hammer, sword,
it's all inside your head.

871
01:16:36,144 --> 01:16:39,933
Now I know it feels like all hope is lost.
Trust me, I know.

872
01:16:40,222 --> 01:16:46,121
But together, you and
I, we can kill Thanos.

873
01:17:25,394 --> 01:17:27,979
Mantis, listen very carefully.

874
01:17:27,988 --> 01:17:30,769
I need you to meet me on Titan.

875
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:39,343
- What's going on?
- I think we're here.

876
01:17:39,368 --> 01:17:42,344
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.

877
01:17:43,211 --> 01:17:45,859
Get your hand inside this.

878
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:51,905
Then, we got one big dodge, so we
gotta move at the same time.

879
01:17:56,672 --> 01:18:00,679
We might wanna turn, turn, turn.
Turn!

880
01:18:28,655 --> 01:18:30,678
You all right?

881
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:34,467
That was close.

882
01:18:34,663 --> 01:18:36,506
I owe you one.

883
01:18:36,538 --> 01:18:40,850
Let me just say, if aliens wind up
implanting eggs in my chest or something,

884
01:18:40,888 --> 01:18:43,553
- and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.
- I don't want another single,

885
01:18:43,578 --> 01:18:45,858
pop-culture reference outta you for
the rest of the trip. Understand?

886
01:18:45,882 --> 01:18:48,280
I'm trying to say that,
something is coming.

887
01:18:54,558 --> 01:18:56,386
Thanos!

888
01:19:16,461 --> 01:19:19,273
Oh, my God! Please don't
put your eggs in me!

889
01:19:27,656 --> 01:19:30,765
Die, Blanket of Death!

890
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:39,280
Everybody stay where you
are, chill the F out...

891
01:19:39,898 --> 01:19:42,577
I'm gonna ask you
this one time...

892
01:19:42,602 --> 01:19:43,958
Where is Gamora?

893
01:19:43,983 --> 01:19:46,717
Yeah, I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?

894
01:19:46,742 --> 01:19:49,959
I'll do you one better!
Why is Gamora?

895
01:19:49,984 --> 01:19:52,982
Let him go, or I swear to you, I'm
gonna french fry this little freak.

896
01:19:53,007 --> 01:19:56,649
Let's do it. You shoot my guy and
I'll blast him. Let's go!

897
01:19:56,748 --> 01:20:00,339
- Do it, Quill. I can take it.
- No, he can't take it.

898
01:20:00,364 --> 01:20:01,323
She's right. You can't.

899
01:20:01,423 --> 01:20:03,177
Oh yeah? You don't wanna
tell me where she is?

900
01:20:03,201 --> 01:20:07,115
That's fine. I'll kill all three of you
and I'll beat it out of Thanos myself!

901
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:09,474
- Starting with you.
- Wait what, Thanos? All right...

902
01:20:09,490 --> 01:20:11,716
Let me ask you this one time...

903
01:20:11,741 --> 01:20:13,842
What master do you serve?

904
01:20:13,866 --> 01:20:17,266
What master do I serve? Am
I supposed to say Jesus?

905
01:20:17,343 --> 01:20:19,532
- You're from Earth.
- Not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.

906
01:20:19,556 --> 01:20:22,141
Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.
What are you hassling us for?

907
01:20:22,166 --> 01:20:26,735
- So you're not with Thanos?
- With Thanos?

908
01:20:26,859 --> 01:20:29,608
No! I'm here to kill Thanos.

909
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,435
He took my girl. Wait, who are you?

910
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:33,740
We're the Avengers, man.

911
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:37,462
- You're the ones Thor told us about!
- You know Thor?

912
01:20:37,836 --> 01:20:41,554
Yeah. Tall guy, not
that good-looking.

913
01:20:41,718 --> 01:20:44,561
Where is he now?

914
01:20:58,201 --> 01:21:00,093
This the plan? We'll
hit him with a brick?

915
01:21:00,196 --> 01:21:01,912
It's a mold.

916
01:21:02,542 --> 01:21:06,863
A king's weapon. Meant to
be the greatest in Asgard.

917
01:21:07,457 --> 01:21:09,775
In theory, it could
even summon the Bifrost.

918
01:21:10,036 --> 01:21:11,715
Does it have a name?

919
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,318
Storm breaker.

920
01:21:14,483 --> 01:21:17,531
Yeah. It's a bit much.

921
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:20,180
So how do we make it?

922
01:21:20,941 --> 01:21:22,774
You'll have to restart the forge.

923
01:21:24,232 --> 01:21:27,511
Awaken the heart of the dying star.

924
01:21:28,852 --> 01:21:32,812
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

925
01:21:34,617 --> 01:21:37,156
What the hell happened
to this planet?

926
01:21:37,181 --> 01:21:38,942
It's 8 degrees off its axis.

927
01:21:39,033 --> 01:21:41,946
Gravitational pull is
all over the place.

928
01:21:42,617 --> 01:21:46,304
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

929
01:21:46,344 --> 01:21:49,327
We'll use it. Alright,
I have a plan.

930
01:21:50,575 --> 01:21:53,215
It's pretty simple. We draw him in,
pin him down, get what we need.

931
01:21:53,422 --> 01:21:56,921
We definitely don't want to dance with
this guy, we just want the gauntlet.

932
01:21:56,946 --> 01:21:58,292
Are you yawning?

933
01:21:59,397 --> 01:22:01,577
In the middle of this,
while I'm breaking it down?

934
01:22:01,602 --> 01:22:03,313
Did you hear what I said?

935
01:22:03,399 --> 01:22:06,024
I stopped listening after you
said that we need a plan.

936
01:22:06,032 --> 01:22:07,057
Okay, Mr. Clean's
on his own page.

937
01:22:07,148 --> 01:22:09,555
See, not winging it isn't
really what they do.

938
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:11,751
What exactly is it that they do?

939
01:22:11,776 --> 01:22:14,947
Kick names, take ass.

940
01:22:21,305 --> 01:22:22,870
All right, just get over here, please?

941
01:22:23,419 --> 01:22:25,736
Mr. Lord,
can you get your folks to circle up?

942
01:22:25,761 --> 01:22:28,948
Star-Lord is fine.

943
01:22:30,106 --> 01:22:31,283
We've gotta coalesce.

944
01:22:31,483 --> 01:22:33,356
Because if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...

945
01:22:33,364 --> 01:22:37,379
Dude, don't call us plucky.
We don't know what it means.

946
01:22:37,395 --> 01:22:41,254
All right, we're optimistic, yes.
I like your plan, except it sucks.

947
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:44,693
So let me do the plan, and that
way, it might be really good.

948
01:22:44,718 --> 01:22:46,748
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the Universe.

949
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:47,817
What dance-off?

950
01:22:47,917 --> 01:22:50,562
- It's not a, it's not a...
- Like in Footloose? The movie?

951
01:22:50,586 --> 01:22:54,265
Exactly like Footloose! Is it still
the greatest movie in history?

952
01:22:54,290 --> 01:22:56,008
It never was.

953
01:22:56,657 --> 01:22:59,438
- We're getting no help with Flash Gordon.
- Flash Gordon?

954
01:22:59,463 --> 01:23:02,072
By the way? That's a compliment.
Don't forget.

955
01:23:02,103 --> 01:23:05,204
I'm half-human. So that's
50% of me that's stupid,

956
01:23:05,406 --> 01:23:08,359
- And that's 100% you.
- Your math is blowing my mind.

957
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,812
Excuse me?

958
01:23:10,469 --> 01:23:14,656
But does your friend
often do that?

959
01:23:15,125 --> 01:23:18,140
Strange! You all right?

960
01:23:27,675 --> 01:23:31,245
- You're back. You're all right.
- Hey, what was that?

961
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:35,426
I went forward in time, to
view alternate futures...

962
01:23:35,731 --> 01:23:39,606
To see all the possible
outcomes of the coming conflict.

963
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,715
- How many did you see?
- 14,000,605.

964
01:23:45,161 --> 01:23:47,981
How many did we win?

965
01:23:51,589 --> 01:23:53,081
One.

966
01:24:14,630 --> 01:24:17,888
The Stone had
better be up there.

967
01:24:19,404 --> 01:24:22,974
For your sister's sake.

968
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:47,756
Welcome, Thanos, son of Eros.

969
01:24:49,108 --> 01:24:52,545
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

970
01:24:52,669 --> 01:24:54,020
You know us?

971
01:24:54,052 --> 01:24:58,856
It is my curse to know
all who journey here.

972
01:24:58,943 --> 01:25:01,364
Where is the Soul Stone?

973
01:25:01,389 --> 01:25:03,498
You should know,

974
01:25:03,698 --> 01:25:07,170
it extracts a terrible price.

975
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:10,630
I'm prepared.

976
01:25:12,294 --> 01:25:16,005
We all think that at first.

977
01:25:19,107 --> 01:25:22,122
We are all wrong.

978
01:25:32,893 --> 01:25:35,635
How is it you know
this place so well?

979
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:40,253
A lifetime ago, I, too,
sought the stones.

980
01:25:40,285 --> 01:25:45,324
I even held one in my hand.
But it cast me out.

981
01:25:45,379 --> 01:25:47,597
Banished me here.

982
01:25:47,605 --> 01:25:51,855
Guiding others to a
treasure I cannot possess.

983
01:26:00,001 --> 01:26:03,633
What you seek lies
in front of you.

984
01:26:03,790 --> 01:26:06,992
As does what you fear.

985
01:26:07,118 --> 01:26:10,469
- What's this?
- The price.

986
01:26:10,555 --> 01:26:15,461
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

987
01:26:16,122 --> 01:26:20,758
You might say it is,
a certain wisdom.

988
01:26:21,793 --> 01:26:23,533
Tell me what it needs.

989
01:26:24,042 --> 01:26:27,301
To ensure
whoever possesses it,

990
01:26:27,348 --> 01:26:30,809
understands its power...

991
01:26:30,848 --> 01:26:34,739
The Stone demands a sacrifice.

992
01:26:34,823 --> 01:26:36,363
Of what?

993
01:26:36,563 --> 01:26:38,682
In order to take the Stone...

994
01:26:38,714 --> 01:26:42,049
You must lose that
which you love.

995
01:26:44,143 --> 01:26:48,682
A soul, for a soul.

996
01:27:03,146 --> 01:27:06,325
All my life, I
dreamed of a day...

997
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:08,888
a moment...

998
01:27:09,125 --> 01:27:11,977
when you got
what you deserved.

999
01:27:13,148 --> 01:27:16,687
And I was always
so disappointed.

1000
01:27:19,093 --> 01:27:21,225
But, now...

1001
01:27:24,460 --> 01:27:27,905
You kill, and torture,

1002
01:27:29,507 --> 01:27:32,670
and you call it mercy.

1003
01:27:35,452 --> 01:27:38,483
The Universe has judged you.

1004
01:27:39,419 --> 01:27:42,515
You asked it for a prize and

1005
01:27:42,715 --> 01:27:44,926
and it told you, no.

1006
01:27:45,497 --> 01:27:47,754
You failed.

1007
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:50,919
And do you wanna know why?

1008
01:27:51,153 --> 01:27:53,133
Because you love nothing.

1009
01:27:53,769 --> 01:27:55,194
No one.

1010
01:28:06,366 --> 01:28:10,506
Really? Tears?

1011
01:28:10,663 --> 01:28:13,053
They are not for him.

1012
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,838
No.

1013
01:28:29,345 --> 01:28:31,985
This isn't love.

1014
01:28:32,010 --> 01:28:35,494
I ignored my destiny once.

1015
01:28:36,752 --> 01:28:39,026
I cannot do that again.

1016
01:28:39,681 --> 01:28:41,370
Even...

1017
01:28:41,630 --> 01:28:43,628
for you.

1018
01:29:07,090 --> 01:29:09,941
I'm sorry, little one.

1019
01:30:51,317 --> 01:30:54,692
Drop to 2,600. Heading 030.

1020
01:30:54,762 --> 01:30:56,517
I hope you're right about this,

1021
01:30:56,539 --> 01:30:59,606
or we're gonna land a lot
faster than you want to.

1022
01:31:14,984 --> 01:31:17,646
When you sad we were going
to open Wakanda to the

1023
01:31:17,658 --> 01:31:20,226
rest of the world, this
is not what I imagined.

1024
01:31:20,234 --> 01:31:22,210
What did you imagine?

1025
01:31:22,235 --> 01:31:25,991
The Olympics. Even a Starbucks.

1026
01:31:39,538 --> 01:31:42,866
- Should we bow?
- Yeah, he's a king.

1027
01:31:42,897 --> 01:31:46,022
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.

1028
01:31:46,701 --> 01:31:50,576
- What are you doing?
- We don't do that here.

1029
01:31:50,601 --> 01:31:53,173
So how big of an assault
should we expect?

1030
01:31:53,185 --> 01:31:55,827
Sir, I think you should expect
quite a big assault.

1031
01:31:55,843 --> 01:31:58,608
- How are we looking?
- You will have my Kingsguard.

1032
01:31:58,648 --> 01:32:02,522
The Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje.
And...

1033
01:32:02,882 --> 01:32:06,491
A semi-stable 100-year old man.

1034
01:32:08,609 --> 01:32:10,288
How have you been, Buck?

1035
01:32:10,313 --> 01:32:13,777
Not bad, for the
end of the world.

1036
01:32:26,354 --> 01:32:28,924
The structure is polymorphic.

1037
01:32:28,963 --> 01:32:32,127
Right. We had to attach each
neuron non-sequentially.

1038
01:32:32,143 --> 01:32:37,213
Why didn't you just reprogram the
synapses to work collectively?

1039
01:32:37,322 --> 01:32:41,017
Because... we didn't think of it?

1040
01:32:41,033 --> 01:32:44,400
- I'm sure you did your best.
- Can you do it?

1041
01:32:44,579 --> 01:32:47,961
Yes, but there are more than
2 trillion neurons here.

1042
01:32:48,001 --> 01:32:51,625
One misalignment could cause a
cascade of circuit failures.

1043
01:32:51,696 --> 01:32:55,297
- It will take time, brother.
- How long?

1044
01:32:55,322 --> 01:32:58,368
As long as you can give me.

1045
01:33:01,408 --> 01:33:05,790
Something's entered
the atmosphere.

1046
01:33:20,332 --> 01:33:22,894
Hey Cap, we got a
situation here.

1047
01:33:32,067 --> 01:33:34,512
God, I love this place.

1048
01:33:34,528 --> 01:33:39,183
Don't start celebrating yet, guys. We
got more incoming outside the dome.

1049
01:33:57,177 --> 01:34:00,882
It's too late. We need to
destroy the Stone now.

1050
01:34:00,907 --> 01:34:04,507
- Vision, get your ass back on the table.
- We will hold them off.

1051
01:34:04,509 --> 01:34:09,258
Wanda, as soon as that stone's out
of his head, you blow it to hell.

1052
01:34:09,283 --> 01:34:10,352
I will.

1053
01:34:10,399 --> 01:34:13,953
Evacuate the city,
engage all defenses...

1054
01:34:13,970 --> 01:34:17,461
and get this man a shield!

1055
01:34:25,849 --> 01:34:28,483
I don't think you get
the scientifics here.

1056
01:34:28,508 --> 01:34:31,298
These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving,

1057
01:34:31,310 --> 01:34:33,742
you need something bigger
to yank them loose!

1058
01:34:33,758 --> 01:34:35,875
- Leave that to me.
- Leave it to you?

1059
01:34:35,883 --> 01:34:39,937
Buddy, you're in space. All
you got is a wrong plan...

1060
01:34:47,367 --> 01:34:49,936
Fire the engines!

1061
01:35:05,893 --> 01:35:09,369
More power, rabbit!

1062
01:35:40,056 --> 01:35:42,516
Well done, boy.

1063
01:35:43,150 --> 01:35:46,939
That's Nidavellir!

1064
01:36:05,716 --> 01:36:08,762
- Damn it.
- What's damn it?

1065
01:36:08,787 --> 01:36:10,849
- The mechanism is crippled.
- What?

1066
01:36:10,864 --> 01:36:13,086
With the iris closed, I
can't heat the metal.

1067
01:36:13,111 --> 01:36:17,126
- How long will it take to heat it?
- A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

1068
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:21,703
- I'm gonna hold it open.
- That's suicide.

1069
01:36:21,728 --> 01:36:24,845
So is facing Thanos
without that axe.

1070
01:36:33,605 --> 01:36:37,620
- How are we looking, Bruce?
- Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it.

1071
01:36:40,017 --> 01:36:44,923
It's so amazing! It's like being
the Hulk without actually...

1072
01:36:47,746 --> 01:36:49,527
I'm okay.

1073
01:36:51,253 --> 01:36:54,987
I got two heat signatures
breaking through the treeline.

1074
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,396
Thank you for standing with us.

1075
01:37:24,428 --> 01:37:26,412
Of course, brother.

1076
01:37:46,103 --> 01:37:48,540
Where's the other friend?

1077
01:37:48,564 --> 01:37:51,423
He will pay for his
life with yours.

1078
01:37:51,837 --> 01:37:54,688
Thanos will have that stone.

1079
01:37:54,759 --> 01:37:56,226
That's not gonna happen.

1080
01:37:56,251 --> 01:37:58,782
You are in Wakanda now.

1081
01:37:58,822 --> 01:38:03,321
Thanos will have nothing
but dust, and blood.

1082
01:38:03,447 --> 01:38:05,121
We,

1083
01:38:05,321 --> 01:38:08,071
have blood to spare.

1084
01:38:18,821 --> 01:38:23,047
- They surrender?
- Not exactly.

1085
01:38:33,068 --> 01:38:35,903
- Yibambe!
- Yibambe!

1086
01:38:36,029 --> 01:38:37,706
Yibambe!

1087
01:38:49,049 --> 01:38:51,837
What the hell?

1088
01:38:53,555 --> 01:38:56,289
Looks like we pissed her off.

1089
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:08,868
They're killing themselves.

1090
01:39:44,048 --> 01:39:45,561
See the teeth on those things?

1091
01:39:45,573 --> 01:39:48,290
Alright, back up, Sam. They
ain't get your wings yet.

1092
01:40:00,145 --> 01:40:02,701
Cap, if these things circle the
perimeter and get in behind us,

1093
01:40:02,870 --> 01:40:04,621
there's nothing between
them and Vision.

1094
01:40:04,821 --> 01:40:06,747
Then we better keep
them in front of us.

1095
01:40:06,772 --> 01:40:09,168
How do we do that?

1096
01:40:10,416 --> 01:40:12,604
We open the barrier.

1097
01:40:14,216 --> 01:40:18,662
On my signal, open
northwest section 17.

1098
01:40:18,710 --> 01:40:20,989
<i>Requesting confirmation, my King.</i>

1099
01:40:20,999 --> 01:40:22,881
<i>You said open the barrier?</i>

1100
01:40:22,890 --> 01:40:26,522
- On my signal.
- This will be the end of Wakanda.

1101
01:40:27,116 --> 01:40:31,498
Then it will be the noblest
ending in history.

1102
01:40:43,616 --> 01:40:47,553
- Wakanda forever!
- Wakanda forever!

1103
01:40:57,803 --> 01:40:58,846
Now!

1104
01:41:29,136 --> 01:41:32,109
- How much longer, Shuri?
- We've barely begun, brother.

1105
01:41:32,267 --> 01:41:34,859
You might want to
pick up the pace.

1106
01:41:41,127 --> 01:41:43,244
All fathers, give me strength.

1107
01:41:43,269 --> 01:41:44,646
You understand, boy?

1108
01:41:44,961 --> 01:41:48,394
You're about to take the
full force of a star.

1109
01:41:49,050 --> 01:41:51,050
It'll kill you.

1110
01:41:51,269 --> 01:41:53,761
And if I die?

1111
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:58,839
Yes, that's what,
killing you means.

1112
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:28,539
Hold it, hold it, Thor!

1113
01:43:17,932 --> 01:43:21,025
Thor? Say something, come on.

1114
01:43:21,284 --> 01:43:23,978
Thor, you okay?

1115
01:43:27,494 --> 01:43:31,829
- I think he's dying.
- He needs the axe.

1116
01:43:32,563 --> 01:43:35,281
Where's the handle?

1117
01:43:36,883 --> 01:43:40,555
Tree! Help me find the handle.

1118
01:44:48,198 --> 01:44:50,182
There's too many of them!

1119
01:45:17,684 --> 01:45:20,380
You guys are so screwed now!

1120
01:45:23,622 --> 01:45:26,848
Bring me Thanos!

1121
01:45:58,325 --> 01:46:00,161
Oh, yeah.

1122
01:46:02,780 --> 01:46:06,093
You're much more of a Thanos.

1123
01:46:07,225 --> 01:46:10,233
I take it that Maw is dead?

1124
01:46:11,334 --> 01:46:14,708
This day extracts a heavy toll.

1125
01:46:15,850 --> 01:46:18,529
Still, he accomplished
his mission.

1126
01:46:18,537 --> 01:46:20,075
You may regret that.

1127
01:46:20,275 --> 01:46:24,326
He brought you face-to-face with
a Master of the Mystic Arts.

1128
01:46:26,849 --> 01:46:29,982
Where do you think
he brought you?

1129
01:46:30,026 --> 01:46:34,236
Let me guess.
Your home?

1130
01:46:37,511 --> 01:46:39,410
It was.

1131
01:46:41,410 --> 01:46:44,410
And it was beautiful.

1132
01:46:45,402 --> 01:46:47,601
Titan was like most planets.

1133
01:46:47,801 --> 01:46:50,910
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.

1134
01:46:50,933 --> 01:46:55,050
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.

1135
01:46:55,136 --> 01:46:57,300
Genocide?

1136
01:46:57,325 --> 01:47:01,645
At random. Dispassionate, fair.
The rich and poor alike.

1137
01:47:02,301 --> 01:47:05,121
And they called me a madman.

1138
01:47:05,263 --> 01:47:09,465
And what I predicted,
came to pass.

1139
01:47:10,451 --> 01:47:12,796
Congratulations. You're a prophet.

1140
01:47:13,139 --> 01:47:14,529
I'm a survivor.

1141
01:47:14,545 --> 01:47:16,974
Who wants to murder trillions.

1142
01:47:17,053 --> 01:47:21,060
With all six Stones, I could
simply snap my fingers.

1143
01:47:21,123 --> 01:47:26,258
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.

1144
01:47:27,610 --> 01:47:30,399
And then what?

1145
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:32,436
I finally rest.

1146
01:47:32,636 --> 01:47:36,516
And watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.

1147
01:47:37,165 --> 01:47:41,383
The hardest choices require
the strongest wills.

1148
01:47:41,673 --> 01:47:47,532
I think you'll find our
will equal to yours.

1149
01:47:47,852 --> 01:47:49,781
"Our"?

1150
01:47:54,724 --> 01:47:59,427
- Piece of cake, Quill.
- Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off!

1151
01:48:36,773 --> 01:48:38,702
Boom!

1152
01:48:39,171 --> 01:48:41,671
Don't let him close his fist.

1153
01:48:45,257 --> 01:48:48,522
Magic! More magic!

1154
01:48:48,757 --> 01:48:49,892
Magic with a kick!

1155
01:48:50,214 --> 01:48:52,245
Magic with a...

1156
01:48:52,486 --> 01:48:54,267
Insect.

1157
01:49:31,415 --> 01:49:33,843
- Well, well.
- You should have killed me.

1158
01:49:34,005 --> 01:49:37,153
Would have been a
waste of parts!

1159
01:49:41,084 --> 01:49:43,631
Where's Gamora?

1160
01:50:23,284 --> 01:50:24,744
Is he under? Don't let up.

1161
01:50:24,769 --> 01:50:27,581
Be quick. He is very strong.

1162
01:50:27,597 --> 01:50:31,506
Parker, help. Get over here. She
can't hold him much longer. Let's go.

1163
01:50:38,755 --> 01:50:41,475
I thought you'd be harder to catch.
For the record, this was my plan.

1164
01:50:42,393 --> 01:50:44,174
Not so strong now, huh?

1165
01:50:44,612 --> 01:50:47,111
Where's Gamora?

1166
01:50:47,306 --> 01:50:50,829
- My Gamora!
- Oh, bullshit!

1167
01:50:50,861 --> 01:50:53,251
Where is she?

1168
01:50:53,298 --> 01:50:56,524
- He is in anguish.
- Good.

1169
01:50:57,430 --> 01:50:58,430
He...

1170
01:50:58,455 --> 01:51:00,178
He mourns.

1171
01:51:00,202 --> 01:51:04,577
What does this monster
have to mourn?

1172
01:51:04,850 --> 01:51:06,811
Gamora...

1173
01:51:09,397 --> 01:51:10,865
What?

1174
01:51:10,889 --> 01:51:17,818
He took her to Vormir. He came back
with the Soul Stone. She didn't.

1175
01:51:18,934 --> 01:51:22,941
Okay, Quill? You gotta cool
it right now, you understand?

1176
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:26,800
Don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!

1177
01:51:27,933 --> 01:51:31,214
Tell me she's lying.

1178
01:51:31,378 --> 01:51:34,808
Asshole! Tell me
you didn't do it.

1179
01:51:35,862 --> 01:51:39,541
I had to...

1180
01:51:39,743 --> 01:51:42,744
No you didn't.

1181
01:51:45,697 --> 01:51:49,158
- No! No, you didn't!
- Quill!

1182
01:51:49,307 --> 01:51:50,820
Just stop! Stop!

1183
01:51:51,020 --> 01:51:54,385
It's coming, I got it, I got it!

1184
01:51:57,203 --> 01:51:59,281
Oh, God.

1185
01:52:57,367 --> 01:53:00,898
Come and get some, face-dogs!

1186
01:53:02,992 --> 01:53:05,929
Come on! Get some, get some!

1187
01:53:08,179 --> 01:53:10,952
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.

1188
01:53:10,999 --> 01:53:13,702
Okay, how much for the arm?

1189
01:53:14,593 --> 01:53:17,155
Oh, I'll get that arm.

1190
01:53:25,466 --> 01:53:29,059
- New haircut?
- I notice you've copied my beard.

1191
01:53:30,778 --> 01:53:33,223
Oh, by the way, this is a
friend of mine. A tree.

1192
01:53:33,248 --> 01:53:35,802
I am Groot!

1193
01:53:36,412 --> 01:53:38,802
I am Steve Rogers.

1194
01:53:57,986 --> 01:54:00,977
Fall back! Fall back now!

1195
01:54:09,342 --> 01:54:11,927
Focus all fire on the
left flank, Sam.

1196
01:54:11,952 --> 01:54:14,068
I'm doing it.

1197
01:54:36,737 --> 01:54:39,002
Why was she up there
all this time?

1198
01:54:39,057 --> 01:54:42,518
She's on the field. Take it.

1199
01:55:13,325 --> 01:55:16,762
Guys, we got a Vision
situation here.

1200
01:55:18,661 --> 01:55:21,778
- Somebody get to Vision!
- I got him.

1201
01:55:21,803 --> 01:55:23,310
On my way.

1202
01:55:28,059 --> 01:55:30,996
He'll die alone. As will you.

1203
01:55:31,004 --> 01:55:32,965
She's not alone.

1204
01:55:58,356 --> 01:56:00,363
Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't.

1205
01:56:00,388 --> 01:56:02,535
This isn't gonna be like
New York, pal. This

1206
01:56:02,547 --> 01:56:04,802
suit's already kicked the
crap outta the Hulk.

1207
01:56:09,226 --> 01:56:12,554
Guys. Vision needs back-up now.

1208
01:56:13,764 --> 01:56:17,490
Hulk? I know you're not making your
entrance 'till the last second.

1209
01:56:17,498 --> 01:56:21,529
This is it, man. This is
the last, last second.

1210
01:56:24,685 --> 01:56:28,435
Hulk! Hulk!
Shit, Hulk!

1211
01:56:29,029 --> 01:56:34,763
- No!
- Screw you, you big, green asshole!

1212
01:56:34,771 --> 01:56:38,333
I'll do it myself. Come on.

1213
01:56:51,008 --> 01:56:53,179
See ya!

1214
01:57:03,807 --> 01:57:06,705
Hulk, we got a lot
to figure out, pal.

1215
01:57:17,395 --> 01:57:19,715
I thought you were a formidable machine.

1216
01:57:20,575 --> 01:57:23,225
But you're dying, like any man.

1217
01:57:31,507 --> 01:57:33,592
Get outta here!

1218
01:57:36,304 --> 01:57:38,233
Go!

1219
01:57:55,788 --> 01:57:57,967
That's really gross.

1220
01:58:24,555 --> 01:58:27,297
I thought I told you to go.

1221
01:58:27,375 --> 01:58:30,070
We don't trade lives, Captain.

1222
01:58:40,214 --> 01:58:42,917
I got you, I got you!

1223
01:58:42,948 --> 01:58:45,698
Sorry I can't remember
any of your names.

1224
01:59:30,123 --> 01:59:32,974
You're full of tricks, wizard.

1225
01:59:33,467 --> 01:59:38,256
But you never once used
your greatest weapon.

1226
01:59:39,766 --> 01:59:41,961
A fake.

1227
01:59:48,915 --> 01:59:52,704
You throw another moon at
me, and I'm gonna lose it.

1228
01:59:52,774 --> 01:59:55,196
- Stark.
- You know me?

1229
01:59:55,672 --> 02:00:00,500
I do. You're not the only
one cursed with knowledge.

1230
02:00:01,250 --> 02:00:03,398
My only curse is you.

1231
02:00:33,854 --> 02:00:37,244
All that for a drop of blood.

1232
02:01:19,909 --> 02:01:22,478
You have my respect, Stark.

1233
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:27,494
When I'm done, half of
humanity will still be alive.

1234
02:01:32,189 --> 02:01:35,337
I hope they remember you.

1235
02:01:44,339 --> 02:01:46,331
Stop.

1236
02:01:51,722 --> 02:01:56,682
Spare his life, and I
will give you the Stone.

1237
02:01:59,281 --> 02:02:01,796
No tricks.

1238
02:02:05,554 --> 02:02:07,616
Don't!

1239
02:02:58,077 --> 02:03:00,342
One to go.

1240
02:03:09,568 --> 02:03:11,997
Where is he?

1241
02:03:19,845 --> 02:03:22,946
Did we just lose?

1242
02:03:25,283 --> 02:03:28,391
Why would you do that?

1243
02:03:30,368 --> 02:03:33,766
We're in the endgame now.

1244
02:03:58,516 --> 02:04:00,836
Are you okay?

1245
02:04:01,758 --> 02:04:04,976
What? What is it?

1246
02:04:06,031 --> 02:04:08,461
He's here.

1247
02:04:18,398 --> 02:04:23,140
Everyone on my position.
We have incoming.

1248
02:04:23,999 --> 02:04:27,030
What the hell?

1249
02:04:52,171 --> 02:04:55,460
Cap. That's him.

1250
02:04:56,959 --> 02:05:00,693
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

1251
02:05:24,351 --> 02:05:27,429
Wanda. It's time.

1252
02:05:27,468 --> 02:05:28,562
No.

1253
02:05:28,762 --> 02:05:30,874
They can't stop him,
Wanda. But we can.

1254
02:05:30,921 --> 02:05:34,156
Look at me. You have the
power to destroy the stone.

1255
02:05:34,181 --> 02:05:37,069
- Don't.
- You must. Please...

1256
02:05:38,236 --> 02:05:41,588
We are out of time.

1257
02:05:41,613 --> 02:05:46,222
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. You can.

1258
02:05:47,521 --> 02:05:51,552
If he gets this stone,
half the Universe dies.

1259
02:05:52,083 --> 02:05:53,469
It's not fair.

1260
02:05:54,923 --> 02:05:57,739
It shouldn't be you,
but it is.

1261
02:05:58,466 --> 02:05:59,988
It's all right.

1262
02:06:00,947 --> 02:06:03,661
You could never hurt me.

1263
02:06:12,097 --> 02:06:15,448
I just feel you.

1264
02:07:53,163 --> 02:07:55,373
I love you.

1265
02:08:24,132 --> 02:08:26,928
I understand, my child.

1266
02:08:27,609 --> 02:08:30,578
Better than anyone.

1267
02:08:30,875 --> 02:08:33,234
You could never.

1268
02:08:37,661 --> 02:08:41,543
Today, I lost more
than you can know.

1269
02:08:42,387 --> 02:08:45,972
But now is no time to mourn.

1270
02:08:47,239 --> 02:08:49,168
Now...

1271
02:08:49,239 --> 02:08:52,809
is no time at all.

1272
02:09:14,755 --> 02:09:17,520
No!

1273
02:10:13,615 --> 02:10:16,177
I told you...

1274
02:10:16,396 --> 02:10:20,122
You'd die for that.

1275
02:10:32,893 --> 02:10:35,284
You should have...

1276
02:10:36,947 --> 02:10:39,602
You...

1277
02:10:40,712 --> 02:10:44,813
You should have
gone for the head!

1278
02:10:46,198 --> 02:10:48,588
No!

1279
02:11:20,273 --> 02:11:22,710
Daughter?

1280
02:11:29,196 --> 02:11:31,438
Did you do it?

1281
02:11:32,530 --> 02:11:34,936
Yes.

1282
02:11:41,947 --> 02:11:44,845
What did it cost?

1283
02:11:47,039 --> 02:11:50,164
Everything.

1284
02:11:59,018 --> 02:12:00,986
What did you do?

1285
02:12:01,916 --> 02:12:04,540
What did you do?!

1286
02:12:16,994 --> 02:12:19,181
Where did he go?

1287
02:12:21,572 --> 02:12:23,619
Thor...

1288
02:12:25,682 --> 02:12:27,291
Where did he go?

1289
02:12:27,393 --> 02:12:29,650
Steve?

1290
02:13:03,359 --> 02:13:05,529
Up, General, up!

1291
02:13:06,322 --> 02:13:07,858
This is no place to die.

1292
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:24,870
I am Groot...

1293
02:13:24,894 --> 02:13:26,151
No.

1294
02:13:26,964 --> 02:13:31,307
No. No. No. No! Groot...

1295
02:13:31,595 --> 02:13:33,563
No...

1296
02:13:46,043 --> 02:13:48,769
Sam?

1297
02:13:51,301 --> 02:13:54,808
Sam, where you at?

1298
02:14:02,148 --> 02:14:05,663
Something's happening...

1299
02:14:16,443 --> 02:14:18,927
Quill?

1300
02:14:25,032 --> 02:14:28,539
- Stay, Quill.
- Oh, man...

1301
02:14:31,735 --> 02:14:33,430
Tony.

1302
02:14:36,212 --> 02:14:40,274
There was no other way.

1303
02:14:44,601 --> 02:14:46,710
Mr. Stark?

1304
02:14:49,859 --> 02:14:53,405
I don't feel so good...

1305
02:14:53,585 --> 02:14:57,507
- You're all right.
- I don't, I don't know what's happening...

1306
02:14:58,725 --> 02:15:02,131
I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go.
Mr. Stark, please...

1307
02:15:02,156 --> 02:15:04,889
Please. I don't wanna go.
I don't wanna go.

1308
02:15:08,957 --> 02:15:12,121
I'm sorry.

1309
02:15:25,275 --> 02:15:27,744
He did it.

1310
02:15:51,509 --> 02:15:55,400
What is this? What the
hell is happening?

1311
02:16:11,668 --> 02:16:14,527
Oh, God.

1312
02:16:58,031 --> 02:17:02,375
Subbed by: iamdepressed
Resynched+fixed by Clarity.

1313
02:27:09,793 --> 02:27:10,849
Search for Stark.

1314
02:27:10,949 --> 02:27:11,982
No not yet.

1315
02:27:12,082 --> 02:27:15,070
I'm watching every satellite above
kind of searching. Still nothing.

1316
02:27:16,184 --> 02:27:19,651
- What is it?
- Multiple bogets over wakanda.

1317
02:27:19,851 --> 02:27:21,589
Same energy signatures
as in New York?

1318
02:27:21,789 --> 02:27:23,210
10 times bigger.

1319
02:27:24,401 --> 02:27:26,260
Call Clint. We'll meet him...

1320
02:27:40,571 --> 02:27:42,269
They okay?

1321
02:27:42,469 --> 02:27:44,099
There is no one here.

1322
02:27:54,306 --> 02:27:56,174
Call control.

1323
02:27:56,374 --> 02:27:58,133
Code RED.

1324
02:27:58,333 --> 02:27:59,956
Nick.

1325
02:28:01,072 --> 02:28:02,108
No!

1326
02:28:17,175 --> 02:28:18,933
Oh no!

1327
02:28:29,256 --> 02:28:34,723
SENDING...

1328
02:28:40,658 --> 02:28:41,919
Captain Marvel.
