1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:07,300
My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,000
When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
by something impossible.
Run, Barry, run!

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
My father went to prison
for her murder.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,400
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,800
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,000
but secretly I use my speed

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,600
to fight crime
and find others like me.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,400
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,200
and get justice for my father.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,500
I am...The flash.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,400
Previously on <i>The Flash...</i>

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,200
I'm sorry
I didn't believe you.

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,300
But you really did see something
that night your mom died

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,100
and your dad <i>is</i> innocent.

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,400
The explosion that put you
in a coma also killed my fiance.

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,600
Can you imagine if
you could control his power?

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,900
If you could harness it,

19
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,400
you could change
what it means to be human.

20
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,100
He's called the flash.

21
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,500
Or, at least,
he will be one day.

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,600
He must be kept safe.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It doesn't matter
if you're the slowest kid

24
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,200
in gym class
or the fastest man alive.

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,000
Every one of us is running.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,200
Being alive means running--

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,800
running from something,

28
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,300
running to something

29
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,300
or someone.

30
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,300
And no matter how fast you are,

31
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,300
there's some things
you can't outrun.

32
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,300
Some things always manage
to catch up to you.

33
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,000
Regular movie scale,
that was a seven or an eight.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,200
Zombie movie scale,
it was, like, a four, tops.

35
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,900
There's a zombie movie scale?

36
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,300
Did you know that zombies
exist in nature?

37
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,100
There's a species of fungi
that infects ants,

38
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,100
causing the ants
to attack plants

39
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,500
that can release spores
which in turn infect new hosts.

40
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,900
I'm going full nerd again,
aren't I?

41
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,000
- Yep.
- Yeah.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,500
Yeah.
It's okay though.

43
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,600
You are still the cutest nerd
that I know.

44
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,300
Anyways,
I'm a lot more interested

45
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,900
in the amazing as of late.

46
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,800
You mean 'cause of
this "Streak" thing?

47
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,600
He's out there.
People are talking about him.

48
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,900
How do you even know
he's a he?

49
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,900
Maybe it's a she.

50
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,700
It's a man, okay?

51
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,900
You know I am really intuitive
about this kind of stuff.

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,300
Someone even posted a picture

53
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,900
after being yanked
from a car accident.

54
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,600
It's a red blur
leaving the scene.

55
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,000
Here, what do you see?

56
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,700
I see
your boyfriend's calling.

57
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,100
Oh,
I should probably get this.

58
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,800
I'm crashing at his place
tonight,

59
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,700
and he's supposed to leave
a key for me somewhere.

60
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,400
Hey, babe.
What's up?

61
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,900
Not much,
just hanging out with Barry.

62
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,900
You off yet?

63
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,000
Hello.

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,300
Code 237 on Waid Boulevard.

65
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,100
Public indecency?

66
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,800
Wait, I think I meant a 239.

67
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Dog leash violation?

68
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,400
Bad man with a gun
in a getaway car.

69
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,000
Go.

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,700
You don't have a mat.
Do you have a planter?

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
He's got a gun.
Look out!

72
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,200
Where'd he go?

73
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,000
What the--

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,300
Key's in the mailbox.

75
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,900
I'll see you later.
Bye.

76
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,800
Eddie says hi.
Nice of him.

77
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,100
You wanna grab a bite?

78
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,900
I'm feeling a little famished.

79
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,100
After the Mongolian barbecue
we had before the movie

80
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,900
and the extra large popcorn
you had at the movie?

81
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,300
How are you not fat?

82
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,400
I've been jogging.

83
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,600
Oh, okay.

84
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,300
Why so public a meeting,
Uncle?

85
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,700
We're dining out to show
our enemies we're not afraid.

86
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,300
Relax, nephew.

87
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,500
We've replaced the windows
with bulletproof glass.

88
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,800
Close it up.

89
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Come.

90
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,000
Have a drink.

91
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,000
Our own drivers
are ripping us off.

92
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,700
Someone is paying them

93
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,500
to steal from us.

94
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,900
None of you will sleep
until we find out who.

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,200
And then those thieves...

96
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,900
Those thieves...

97
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,300
will draw

98
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,600
their last breath.

99
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,700
Uncle!

100
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,600
<font color=#00FF00>?Flash 1x03 ?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Thing You Can't Outrun</font>
Original Air Date on October 21, 2014

101
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

102
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,500
- Where'd you cut him off?
- So we cut him off at Eighth.

103
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,500
I mean, the perp was in
the backseat of the cruiser

104
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,900
before he even knew
what happened.

105
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,100
Congratulations, Paulson,

106
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,500
on that arrest last night.

107
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,200
Hell of a job.
You come by later, Joe.

108
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,900
I'll give you a driving lesson,
okay?

109
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,000
Wasn't even him last night.
It was me.

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,100
I figured.

111
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,400
I just didn't realize

112
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,000
you were helping people
for the glory.

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,700
It's not like I want a museum
built in my name.

114
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,300
Keeping what I can do a secret
from Iris and everyone,

115
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,700
it's harder than I thought.

116
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,400
I know,
but it is safer that way.

117
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,300
Besides, me and you
got work to do.

118
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,900
The evidence
from my mom's case.

119
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,600
I had it brought up
from storage.

120
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,500
I've been through this box
1,000 times.

121
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,300
Before, your story about what
really happened that night--

122
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,200
the lightning storm,
the man in the middle of it--

123
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,700
I thought that was a kid

124
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,400
trying to protect his father
from prison.

125
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,000
But now that I know it's true,

126
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,800
we're gonna go through
every scrap of evidence

127
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,400
until we find something
that helps us.

128
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
It took the jury 52 minutes
to come back

129
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,700
with a verdict of guilty.

130
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
They moved too fast,

131
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,500
which is why we got to
take our time.

132
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,200
Barry, Joe,
we got multiple homicides.

133
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,700
Do you know
the Darbinyan crime family?

134
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,200
Barry?

135
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,400
Ah.
Anything?

136
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,900
Signs of histotoxic hypoxia.

137
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,800
The cells in their bodies
were unable to utilize oxygen.

138
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,200
It's consistent with exposure
to poison gas.

139
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,500
What kind of poison?

140
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,900
I'll need to take
a lung sample,

141
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,600
see if I can narrow it down.

142
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,100
The only other exit was bolted
from the inside.

143
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,700
They were trapped.

144
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,100
I was thinking someone
pumped gas in from the outside,

145
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,600
but witnesses say
the street was empty.

146
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,200
So it was from the inside.

147
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,900
That means there should be
a canister

148
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,900
or a container left behind.

149
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,100
The gas just didn't
come in by itself.

150
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,300
Unless it had
a mind of its own.

151
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,500
Eddie, would you mind
canvassing again?

152
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,100
Somebody had to have seen
something suspicious.

153
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,000
Okay, explain.

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,600
The boss collapsed
by the table.

155
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,500
This guy made it 10 feet away.

156
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,000
That guy had a chance
to move off

157
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,400
and fire three shots
into the window

158
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,800
trying to break the glass.

159
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,000
But they all started
in the same spot,

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,200
which means they should have
all been affected by the gas

161
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,900
at the same time, but instead,
it's as if...

162
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,700
They were attacked one by one.

163
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,200
My gut feeling,
if we're gonna solve this one,

164
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,900
you and me are gonna need...

165
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,400
Backup.
Yeah.

166
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,000
Fascinating, a meta-human
that can manipulate poison gas.

167
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,400
Is it just poisonous gas,

168
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,100
or can he control
all aerated substances?

169
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,200
And how is he able
to formulate the connection?

170
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,100
Is it physiological
or psychological?

171
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,600
This individual can create

172
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,200
a mental nexus
using gaseous substances.

173
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,200
You mean connect with gases
on a molecular level?

174
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,700
- Yes.
- That is ridiculously cool.

175
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,400
They get really excited
about this stuff.

176
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,800
The only thing
I'm excited about

177
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,600
is putting criminals
behind bars.

178
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,200
Except Iron Heights
isn't exactly equipped

179
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,700
to handle meta-humans.

180
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,400
Then I guess it's fortunate
the ones

181
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,900
you've encountered so far
are no longer with us.

182
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,900
Well, unless we're planning
on executing

183
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,100
every super criminal we stop,

184
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,700
you geniuses are gonna have to
come up

185
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,600
with someplace else
to hold them.

186
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,500
A meta-human prison.
Sweet.

187
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,300
Until we figure a way
to remove their powers.

188
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,900
There is one place here
that might hold them.

189
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,400
You can't be serious.

190
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,000
I mean, we haven't been
down there since--

191
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,400
it's cordoned off.

192
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Cisco is right.

193
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
It could be modified to act

194
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,600
as a makeshift prison.

195
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
What could?

196
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,300
The particle accelerator.

197
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,800
Tonight, the future begins.

198
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,100
The work my team and I
will do here

199
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,600
will change our understanding
of physics,

200
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,800
will bring about
advancements in power,

201
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,000
advancements in medicine.

202
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,900
And trust me,
that future

203
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,600
will be here faster
than you think.

204
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,900
Dr. Wells, we just got
the latest weather report.

205
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,400
A big thunderstorm
is rolling in.

206
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,000
We're not launching
a space shuttle.

207
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,700
We'll be fine.

208
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,200
Tahiti?

209
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,700
I know it's a long flight,
Ronnie,

210
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,700
but we can binge watch
<i>Orange is the New Black.</i>

211
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,900
Oh, okay.

212
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,700
But what about Italy?

213
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,700
Pizza and wine and more pizza.

214
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,400
Yes, but Italy
doesn't have Mai Tais,

215
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,100
and a honeymoon
isn't a honeymoon

216
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,800
without Mai Tais.

217
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
Dr. Wells,
the accelerator is primed

218
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,300
and ready
for particle injection.

219
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,200
Well, I feel I should
say something profound

220
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,900
like "one small step for man,"

221
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,100
but all I can think of
to say is,

222
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,300
I feel like I've waited
for this day for centuries.

223
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,000
That's it?

224
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,300
You'd think there'd be, like,
a loud bang.

225
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,400
If there was a loud bang,
we'd all be in big trouble.

226
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
Take it from the guy
who helped build it.

227
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,700
Ladies and gentlemen,
we did it.

228
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,700
Mai Tais it is.

229
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,600
Was that...

230
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,500
A loud bang.

231
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Caitlin.

232
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,900
Caitlin.

233
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,500
Did you hear me?

234
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,500
We're going down
to the accelerator ring.

235
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,600
Actually, Dr. Wells,
I could use Caitlin's help

236
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,400
identifying the poison gas.

237
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,900
Okay.

238
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,300
If that's okay with you?

239
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,800
Let's go.

240
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,400
Welcome to the CCPD.

241
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,600
So this is your day job.

242
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,000
Mm-hmm.

243
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,300
I'm gonna rip out your hearts

244
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,800
and eat 'em for lunch.

245
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,200
Delightful.

246
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,600
Lab rat, I need prints
off this gun pronto.

247
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,300
Allen!

248
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,500
Where the hell is the fiber
analysis on the Orloff case?

249
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,000
Upstairs.
It's all finished.

250
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,500
I can just run up
and bring it down.

251
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,300
With you, that could be
three days from now.

252
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,900
I'll go with you.
Who are you?

253
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,800
Dr. Caitlin Snow,

254
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,700
Barry's personal physician.

255
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,800
The fiber analysis
for the Orloff case,

256
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,300
like you asked for,

257
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,300
sir.

258
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,900
Clean up your lab.

259
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,300
It's a mess.

260
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,100
The lightning
was in the house.

261
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,400
I told my son to run,

262
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,300
he disappeared,

263
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,800
and that's when
I saw the blood.

264
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,500
Your prints were
on the murder weapon.

265
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,100
I needed
to stabilize the knife.

266
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,800
I'm a doctor.

267
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,600
I was trying to save her.

268
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,900
I didn't kill my wife.

269
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,700
Joe, tell them.

270
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,500
You know me.
Our kids are friends.

271
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,000
You tell them, Joe.

272
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,000
Do I even want to know
what you were looking at?

273
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,700
It's just work.

274
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,500
Some old cases
weren't filed properly.

275
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,300
Detective.
What are you doing here?

276
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,800
Joe, I thought
you were at the morgue.

277
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,000
I decided
to bring some work home.

278
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,700
Why are you here?

279
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,100
Yes, well,
I've been looking for you.

280
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I thought maybe we could
go back to the crime scene,

281
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
re-canvass,
see if we missed anything.

282
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,400
Always work the case, right?

283
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,000
That's what you taught me.

284
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,300
Wow, you've been listening.

285
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,200
Okay, let's hit it.

286
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,100
You mind
if I use your bathroom?

287
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,700
It's the first door
on the right.

288
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,900
I'll be in the car.

289
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,400
Bye, baby.

290
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,800
Bye, Dad.

291
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,900
Okay, this has got to stop.

292
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,500
I came here
to surprise my girlfriend,

293
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,000
and now I'm going
to a crime scene with her dad--

294
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,800
not exactly the afternoon
I was planning on.

295
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,100
I know, I know,
it's just--

296
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,500
it's not the right time
to tell him.

297
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,800
When is, Iris?

298
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,400
I know my dad.
He'll kill us.

299
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,300
Right now,
you're killing us.

300
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,400
The copper in the tube
is arranged to form cavities,

301
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,900
and we can use those cavities
as containment cells.

302
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,900
Of course, we'll have to
design them to counteract

303
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,700
meta-human abilities, but--

304
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,900
might just work.

305
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,000
First, we have to decouple
the main injection system

306
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
on the gantry level.

307
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,200
I'll be right back.

308
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,000
Why don't I do that?

309
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,600
I need the exercise.

310
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,400
There's an anomaly
in the core chamber.

311
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,100
The ring's
structural integrity is holding.

312
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,700
It's started a chain reaction.

313
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,600
The system is collapsing.
We need to shut it down.

314
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,100
We can't ramp down
the accelerator from here.

315
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,400
We need to do it manually.
Go.

316
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,600
- I'll come with.
- Ronnie, no.

317
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,100
I'm the lead engineer.

318
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,700
I know how to operate
the shutdown valve.

319
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,700
- It's not safe.
- Cait, I have to go.

320
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,900
Okay, you stay here.

321
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,000
We've only got a few minutes
before this thing blows,

322
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,200
and if I'm not back in time,
you need to initiate lockdown.

323
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,000
No way.
I am not closing this door.

324
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,400
I won't be able
to open it again.

325
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,000
Cisco, if you don't seal off
the blast,

326
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,500
everyone in this building
will die,

327
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,900
including Caitlin.

328
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,400
Okay, now promise me.

329
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,000
Set your watch.

330
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,100
Two minutes.

331
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,700
You're coming back.

332
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,900
Cisco.

333
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,800
Cisco, we're ready to go.

334
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,200
Must be hard,
coming back down here.

335
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,200
A lot happened that night.

336
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,400
If you feel the need to talk--

337
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
I was just thinking,

338
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,600
we need to nail
those voltage calculations.

339
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,600
One fault,
and the helium blowback

340
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,500
could damage the mountings.

341
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,400
Smart.

342
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,000
Can I ask you something

343
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,500
that you don't have to answer?

344
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,700
My least favorite
kind of question.

345
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,900
Shoot.

346
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,700
Ronnie.
What was he like?

347
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,800
You just never talk about him
that much.

348
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,800
We met when we were working
on the particle accelerator.

349
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,200
He was the structural engineer.

350
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,600
He liked to joke
that he was basically

351
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,700
a very high-priced plumber.

352
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,100
We were very different.

353
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,600
You might have noticed
I can be a bit...

354
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,400
guarded.

355
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,500
Ronnie knew how
to make me laugh.

356
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,500
He used to say we were
like fire and ice.

357
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,600
He wasn't supposed to be there
that night.

358
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,800
He was just there for me.

359
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,100
If he hadn't--

360
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,100
This says that there was
no residue of gas in the tissue,

361
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,000
poisonous or otherwise.

362
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,200
It must have evaporated.

363
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,500
We'll need to get
a fresh sample.

364
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
Wait, this can't be right.

365
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,500
This says that there are
two distinct strands of DNA

366
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,900
inside the tissue.

367
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,600
How did someone else's DNA
get inside the victim's lungs?

368
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,000
Well, my docket was clear,
so I stopped by the mall

369
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,500
to pick up
your homecoming dress.

370
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,000
I <i>am</i> a great mom.

371
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'll see you for dinner,
sweetie.

372
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,200
There's no DNA match
in the database.

373
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,500
I don't understand.

374
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,300
Why would a chemical attack

375
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,800
leave behind another person's
DNA inside the victim?

376
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,500
What if the meta-human
we're looking for

377
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,600
doesn't control gas?

378
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,800
What if he becomes it?

379
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,000
Judge Howard.

380
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,700
It's nice to see you again.

381
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,300
You died.

382
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,400
You say that like
it was an accident.

383
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,100
You remember the last thing
you said to me

384
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,700
in the courtroom?

385
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,100
May god have mercy
on <i>your</i> soul.

386
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,200
All available units,
we have a report

387
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,500
of a toxic gas attack

388
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,900
in the Central City
shopping mall.

389
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,000
Barry, don't.

390
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,500
We don't know enough
about what we're facing yet.

391
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,700
It's not safe.

392
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,300
Caitlin, I have to go.

393
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I patched into
the mall's security system.

394
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,600
According to witnesses,
the gas attack

395
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,700
was in the main elevator
in the north wing.

396
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,000
Which one is the north wing?

397
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,600
The one
with the Big Belly Burger.

398
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,500
I eat.

399
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,000
Back up.
Please, keep back.

400
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,700
Why did you kill that woman?

401
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,300
She deserved to die.

402
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,700
Now go run away.

403
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,000
I still have one more name
on my list.

404
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,200
don't make me add you to it.

405
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,200
Barry.

406
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,900
Barry, can you hear me?

407
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,900
His vitals are weak,
but he's alive, Dr. Wells.

408
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,200
I'm sure he's fine.

409
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,000
I can't breathe.

410
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
He needs oxygen.
Get the crash cart!

411
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,000
Barry!

412
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,800
Barry.
Cut me open.

413
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,100
The poison's still in me.
He brought us a sample.

414
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,400
Caitlin, we need to do
a pulmonary biopsy,

415
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,900
extract an active portion
of that gas.

416
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,400
I can't give you
any anesthetic.

417
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,200
Your metabolism will burn
right through it.

418
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,100
I heal quick, remember?

419
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,400
Do it.

420
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,600
Cisco, give me the syringe.

421
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,700
This is gonna hurt a lot.

422
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,800
It's a small needle.
You probably won't even feel it.

423
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,100
You're definitely
going to feel it.

424
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,600
The streak lives.

425
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,000
You'd be dead
if your lung cells

426
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,500
didn't regenerate
so quickly.

427
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,400
My chest feels like
that one time

428
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,000
I had a cigarette.

429
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,800
Yeah, teen me lived for danger.

430
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,100
This isn't funny.
You could've--

431
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,300
I didn't.

432
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,400
Now that we have a sample,
we'll get to work analyzing it,

433
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,900
figure out the makeup
of the poison,

434
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,000
maybe get a clue as to
his human identity.

435
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,200
Or at least a way to stop him
from turning into a mist.

436
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,100
The Mist.
Okay, that's his name.

437
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,500
End of discussion.

438
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,800
I have to get
to the station.

439
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,500
You should be resting.

440
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,000
I have to talk to Joe.

441
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,500
Joe.
I had him.

442
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,200
The meta-human.
We were wrong.

443
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,000
He's not controlling
airborne toxins.

444
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,800
He can literally transform
himself into poison gas.

445
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,800
That's new.

446
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,300
The victim was a judge.

447
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,900
We're going through
some of her old cases

448
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,200
to see if there's a connection.

449
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,500
It's too late.

450
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,900
I should have been faster.

451
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,500
Focus on the job.

452
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,200
Don't think about that
right now.

453
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,600
You don't want to know
what I'm thinking about.

454
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,700
My dad has spent 14 years

455
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,600
in a 6x8-foot cell
for a crime he didn't commit.

456
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,900
I couldn't save my mom,
but I can save him.

457
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,500
Didn't I promise you

458
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,100
that we would get your father
out of prison together?

459
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,500
I don't need your help, Joe.

460
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,100
I could be in and out of there
with him

461
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,700
before anyone even sees me.

462
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,700
Okay.

463
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,600
You break him out of there.

464
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,100
Then what?

465
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,200
He's on the run
for the rest of his life.

466
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,400
And something tell me
he's not as fast as you are.

467
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,800
You don't know
what it's like there.

468
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,400
You think I don't understand

469
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,300
what you're feeling?

470
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,600
I have been a cop
for almost as long

471
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,400
as you've been alive.

472
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,000
So you should know,
putting on that suit

473
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,100
does not make everybody safe.

474
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,600
For every person you save,

475
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,300
there's gonna be somebody
you can't.

476
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,100
And the hardest thing
you're gonna have to face

477
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,200
is not some monster out there
with powers.

478
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,600
It's gonna be that feeling
of uselessness

479
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,800
when you can't do anything.

480
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,700
Or the guilt that weighs on you
when you make a mistake.

481
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,900
Some things, Barry,
you can't fight.

482
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:28,500
Some things
you just have to live with.

483
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,600
Yes, I'm writing this down.

484
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,500
Red streak at the mall

485
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,600
during the gas attack.

486
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,900
Thank you for calling.

487
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,600
Never fails.

488
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,700
Tip lines bring out
the potheads and the crazies.

489
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,800
Did they get a good look
at the streak's face?

490
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,500
Not you too.

491
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,700
What are you doing here anyway?

492
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,100
We need to talk.

493
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,500
I thought about what you said,
and--

494
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,600
I know what you're gonna say.

495
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,800
I understand.

496
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,200
I'm your dad's partner.

497
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,400
No, no, no,
you don't understand.

498
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,300
I have never really had
a serious boyfriend.

499
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,700
Between dad and Barry and work,

500
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,300
my life has been full.

501
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,700
And I really like you,

502
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,800
but I thought that if I told
my dad about us,

503
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,600
then it would make this real,

504
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,400
and suddenly, it's something
that I could lose

505
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,200
or screw up.

506
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,600
I wanted it to be real.

507
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,000
Eddie.

508
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,100
I'm sorry.

509
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,900
I didn't mean to scare you,
leaving like that.

510
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,400
It's okay.
I get it.

511
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,900
You had to go.

512
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,900
It's just--

513
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,400
that's the last thing that
Ronnie said to me that night.

514
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,200
My mother died
14 years ago.

515
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,400
I used to think that
the further away I got from it,

516
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,900
the less it would hurt.

517
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,300
But some days, the pain,

518
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,600
it's worse than the day
that it happened.

519
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,500
Some things you can't fight.

520
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,900
For so long,

521
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:09,000
I've been terrified
of going into that hole.

522
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,300
What if I went with you?

523
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Where's Ronnie?
Cisco, where is he?

524
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,200
- He's still inside.
- What? Open the door.

525
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,000
I can't.
We're in lockdown mode.

526
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Cisco, we have to get him
out of there or he'll die.

527
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,600
- Cisco, can you hear me?
- Ronnie, it's me.

528
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,200
Caitlin.

529
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,500
Is Cisco there?

530
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,400
Yeah, Ronnie, I'm here.
I'm listening.

531
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,700
I adjusted the magnets
to redirect the beam

532
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,100
to try and vent the system

533
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
so the blast goes up
and not out.

534
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I'll need to reset
the particle parameters

535
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
to compensate.

536
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,400
Cisco's doing it.

537
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,000
There has to be another way
out of there.

538
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,200
You have to find it.

539
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,200
Cait, the chain reaction,

540
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,200
I can't reverse it.

541
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,500
The doors need to stay shut
to protect you.

542
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,700
You still there?

543
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,000
I'm here.

544
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,900
Caitlin, whatever happens--

545
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,900
Ronnie.

546
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,400
Ronnie!

547
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,900
He saved so many lives
that day,

548
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,400
and no one will ever know
what he did.

549
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,800
I do.

550
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,400
He was a hero.

551
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,600
I didn't want him
to be a hero.

552
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
I wanted him to be my husband.

553
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,600
Barry, Caitlin,
you down there?

554
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,500
You got to come look at this.

555
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,800
Hey, check this out.

556
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,800
It's a 3-D molecular model
of the gas

557
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,000
we retrieved from your lungs.

558
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,800
We have identified the toxin.

559
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,500
Hydrogen cyanide?

560
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,300
What's interesting
is what's mixed in

561
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,900
with the cyanide--
a sedative.

562
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,800
Of course.

563
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,400
The night of the explosion,
find out if anyone was executed.

564
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,900
Why?

565
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,900
That sedative is given
to criminals on death row

566
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,200
before they go
to the gas chamber

567
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,500
and breathe in hydrogen cyanide.

568
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,700
That's right.

569
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,100
There was someone executed.

570
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,700
Kyle Nimbus.
That's him.

571
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,200
He was a hit man
for the Darbinyan crime family.

572
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,100
They turned on him
and testified.

573
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,000
Judge Theresa Howard
was the judge at his trial.

574
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
She sentenced him to death.

575
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,400
He must have been affected

576
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,500
by the explosion
while he was being gassed.

577
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,700
Records indicate
the execution was completed.

578
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,300
That's why
there wasn't a match.

579
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,100
The DNA database only has
records of the living.

580
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,700
Right.

581
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,500
He said there was
one more person on his list.

582
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,400
Check the arrest record.
Who caught him?

583
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,100
That could be his next attack.

584
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,400
Barry, the lead detective...

585
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,300
Here to see Henry Allen.

586
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,700
Sign here.

587
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,100
Personal effects here.

588
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,700
- Eddie.
- Barry, what's up?

589
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,100
Hey, do you know
where Joe went?

590
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,300
He's not picking up his cell.

591
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,300
Uh, not sure.

592
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,100
Eddie, it's really important
I speak to him.

593
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,600
I need to know
where he went.

594
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,400
He went to Iron Heights
to see your dad.

595
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,100
Barry.

596
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,400
I reverse-engineered
an antidote to the toxin.

597
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,200
I hope you won't need it.

598
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,700
What are you doing here?
Is Barry all right?

599
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,100
He's fine.

600
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,000
Then to what
do I owe this visit?

601
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,700
I know I should have
come to see you sooner.

602
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,000
You just weren't up
for a little chitchat

603
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,300
with a man who murdered his wife
in front of his own son?

604
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,600
Except now I know
you didn't kill your wife.

605
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,500
Barry, I pulled up the specs
on Iron Heights prison.

606
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,200
It's maximum security,

607
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,300
but I think I can talk you
through breaking in there.

608
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,200
Don't bother.

609
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,200
I've been figuring out

610
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,300
how to break into that place

611
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,100
since I was 11.

612
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,100
Some new evidence
has come to light.

613
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,300
I can't go into detail.

614
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,400
It's just--

615
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,700
look, the important thing is,

616
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,100
I'm reopening the case.

617
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,300
I'm gonna find out
who really killed Nora,

618
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,600
and I promise you, Henry,

619
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,400
I'm going to get you
out of here.

620
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,800
I am so sorry.

621
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,500
It doesn't matter
that you didn't believe in me...

622
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,700
Because you always believed
in my son.

623
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,700
Nimbus.

624
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,900
You're supposed to be dead.
Same to you.

625
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:14,000
Joe?

626
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Joe!

627
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Help!

628
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,500
Guards!

629
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,800
Somebody help!

630
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,600
Go get him.

631
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,500
So you've come to finish
what the gas chamber couldn't?

632
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,900
You're going somewhere you
can't hurt anyone ever again.

633
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,100
Wrong.

634
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,900
He used the antidote on Joe.

635
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,000
You need to stay away from him,
Barry.

636
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,500
Do not breathe him in.

637
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,800
I'm not sure
how that helps me, guys.

638
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,700
You can't fight him, Barry.

639
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,500
Just keep him coming at you.

640
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,900
That should sap his strength.

641
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,000
Gas is the least stable form
of matter.

642
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,200
This meta-human will not be able

643
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,600
to stay in his mist form
for long.

644
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,400
His particles will need
to reform.

645
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,500
Barry.

646
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,300
Barry.

647
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,800
We win.

648
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,700
It's been a while
since I watched you sleep.

649
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,400
Rescuing you is exhausting.

650
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,500
I really miss the ability

651
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,600
to be able to ground you.

652
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,300
Sorry I went and grew up.

653
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,900
I could have got my dad
out of Iron Heights tonight.

654
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,900
I know.

655
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,100
But you were right.

656
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,200
That's not the way.

657
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,400
- Daddy.
- Oh.

658
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,100
Baby, I'm fine.
don't worry.

659
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,500
I'll let you guys talk.

660
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:03,300
Partner.

661
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,000
You two arrive at the same time?

662
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,000
Dad, we have something
that we need to tell you.

663
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,200
Dad, the thing is--

664
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,200
You two are dating.

665
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,700
I know.
You do?

666
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,800
I'm a detective, remember?

667
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,700
And both of you
are lousy liars.

668
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,000
So you're not mad?

669
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Oh, I'm mad.

670
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,900
And if the doctor
hadn't confiscated my gun,

671
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,200
we'd be having an entirely
different conversation.

672
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,900
Well, I should let
you two talk,

673
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,700
and I'll just be outside

674
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,000
looking into
the Witness Protection program.

675
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,400
I'm sorry.

676
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,300
Iris,
this is going to be complicated.

677
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,600
You know
I don't like complicated.

678
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,200
Do you like him?

679
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,400
Yeah, I do.

680
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,600
Then I will do my damnedest
not to shoot him.

681
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,800
That is all I ask.

682
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,400
Will it hold?

683
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,800
The barrier is powered by

684
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,700
an 8.3 Tesla superconducting
electromagnet,

685
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,300
which is about 100,000 times
the strength

686
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,900
of earth's magnetic field.

687
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,600
In other words, yes.

688
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,000
Hmm.
He's mad.

689
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,800
Well, good night.

690
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,900
So we're just supposed
to get used to

691
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,100
working above a makeshift prison

692
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,500
housing evil people
with superpowers.

693
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,000
You'd be surprised what
you can get used to, Caitlin.

694
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,000
Caitlin.

695
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,700
Could I talk to you
for a second?

696
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,800
Sure.
What's up?

697
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,000
It's about the night
that Ronnie died.

698
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I--

699
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,300
Look, Cisco, I'm okay.

700
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,200
I thought coming down here
would undo me,

701
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,800
but thinking about
what Ronnie did to protect us...

702
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,500
It just made me love him more.

703
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,100
Come on.

704
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,100
I need ice cream or a drink.

705
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,900
Let's see which one
we hit first.

706
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,600
Joe's gonna be okay.

707
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,400
You know, lately I've been
thinking about mom.

708
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,800
A lot.

709
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,100
I miss her.

710
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,300
Did I ever tell you about
the time you learned to walk?

711
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,500
A couple times.

712
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,200
Everyone was walking
before you.

713
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,400
All the little babies
running around the neighborhood,

714
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,100
not you.

715
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,300
But your mom was never worried.

716
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,500
She just said,
"he'll walk

717
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:22,100
when he has someplace to go."

718
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,100
And sure enough, the first time
you took a few steps,

719
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:30,000
you moved so quick,
you didn't just walk,

720
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
you started...

721
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,600
To run.

722
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,300
And you ran to your mom,
Barry.

723
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,800
Right into her arms.

724
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,900
You had someplace to go.

725
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,400
I thought being
the fastest man alive

726
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,500
would make my life easier--

727
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,600
that I could outrun anything.

728
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,500
Turns out,
no one can outrun pain.

729
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,100
Somebody help!
Please, somebody!

730
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,700
Life is tragic.

731
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,500
but it's also precious...

732
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,800
and sweet...

733
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,500
and extraordinary.

734
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,900
and the only way I know
to honor my mom's life

735
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,000
is to keep running.

736
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,700
Dr. Wells.

737
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,200
Dr. Wells, Ronnie did it.

738
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,600
He vented the system.

739
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,100
S.T.A.R. Labs should hold.

740
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,200
Good man.

741
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,800
I'm on my way down.

742
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,800
See you soon, Barry.
