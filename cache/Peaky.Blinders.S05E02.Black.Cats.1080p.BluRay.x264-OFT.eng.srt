1
00:00:01,005 --> 00:00:02,725
<i>In New York City, at 6am,</i>

2
00:00:02,845 --> 00:00:06,205
<i>the Wall Street Stock Exchange crashed.</i>

3
00:00:06,325 --> 00:00:09,245
<i>I told Michael on Friday
this was going to happen.</i>

4
00:00:09,365 --> 00:00:11,485
We were most definitely on board.

5
00:00:14,045 --> 00:00:16,365
But you have to listen
to the voices that you hear.

6
00:00:22,285 --> 00:00:24,725
My name is Mosley. Oswald Mosley.

7
00:00:24,845 --> 00:00:26,365
Yeah, I know who you are.

8
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:28,365
You have come to my attention.

9
00:00:30,085 --> 00:00:32,925
Mr Shelby?
Mr Levitt from the <i>London Times.</i>

10
00:00:33,045 --> 00:00:35,925
Ten years ago, I was a journalist
on the <i>Birmingham Evening Mail.</i>

11
00:00:36,045 --> 00:00:37,845
Course, working in that city,

12
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:39,965
it was impossible not to know your name.

13
00:00:40,085 --> 00:00:42,725
And your... reputation.

14
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:45,885
What is your Tory newspaper
more afraid of?

15
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:49,165
Is it evolution or revolution?

16
00:05:19,765 --> 00:05:23,365
Dad! There's a phone call for you!

17
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:31,685
Dad! There's a phone call for you!

18
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:34,205
Charlie!

19
00:05:35,725 --> 00:05:39,045
Charlie! Wait!

20
00:05:39,165 --> 00:05:40,365
Charlie!

21
00:05:56,285 --> 00:05:58,405
Giddy-up, horsey, giddy-up!

22
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:08,205
- Dad, there's a phone call for you.
- Good boy.

23
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:10,085
Good boy.

24
00:06:10,205 --> 00:06:12,165
Will you go back to the house?

25
00:06:12,285 --> 00:06:14,365
And, er, whoever's calling,

26
00:06:14,485 --> 00:06:17,005
the operator will have their number,

27
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,085
and I'll call them back, eh?

28
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:23,725
Oh, look, Charlie.

29
00:06:23,845 --> 00:06:25,525
You must have violin practice.

30
00:06:25,645 --> 00:06:27,045
It's Mrs Milligan.

31
00:06:27,165 --> 00:06:28,165
Go on.

32
00:06:29,485 --> 00:06:30,645
And, Charlie!

33
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,165
Charlie, you play loudly.

34
00:06:33,285 --> 00:06:35,005
You might hear some bangs.

35
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,405
Go on.

36
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,405
<i>Mr Shelby?</i>

37
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:33,605
Maggie, yeah, it's me.

38
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:35,925
<i>- Yes, Mr Shelby.</i>
- I just missed a call.

39
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:37,325
Where was it from?

40
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:39,045
<i>Belfast.</i>

41
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:42,485
Belfast. Where in Belfast?

42
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,605
<i>Um, I'm not sure.</i>

43
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,445
Do you have the number?

44
00:08:46,565 --> 00:08:47,965
Yeah.

45
00:08:50,445 --> 00:08:51,965
Yeah, can you put me through?

46
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,285
<i>Tommy, don't believe...</i>

47
00:09:06,925 --> 00:09:08,925
Mr Shelby.

48
00:09:09,045 --> 00:09:10,525
My name is Captain Swing,

49
00:09:10,645 --> 00:09:12,485
calling from the occupied Six Counties.

50
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:15,085
And there are some people
from the other side

51
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:18,525
of our neat little city
that want you dead.

52
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:24,485
<i>You should also know that this boy,
this Michael, your kin,</i>

53
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:28,205
was in his cabin
aboard the SS Monroe in Belfast dock,

54
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:30,925
making deals with the very men
who want you dead.

55
00:09:31,045 --> 00:09:32,045
Tommy, they're lying!

56
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:35,565
Now, if you want, we can put
a bullet in his head here and now...

57
00:09:36,645 --> 00:09:38,765
...or we can send him home,
and you can deal with him.

58
00:09:45,005 --> 00:09:46,605
Send him home.

59
00:09:47,885 --> 00:09:49,565
Very well, Mr Shelby.

60
00:09:49,685 --> 00:09:53,885
But be informed that this kin of yours
was talking to representatives

61
00:09:54,005 --> 00:09:57,165
from the County Tyrone and Glasgow UVF

62
00:09:57,285 --> 00:09:59,205
about how they'd divide up
the English racetracks

63
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:02,885
- after they'd blown away your legs.
- Tommy, they're lying!

64
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:06,485
And may I ask...

65
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:09,525
...why you are doing me this favour?

66
00:10:12,805 --> 00:10:13,965
Because, Mr Shelby,

67
00:10:14,085 --> 00:10:16,885
we've been informed
by people at the very highest level

68
00:10:17,005 --> 00:10:19,845
that, since your conversion to socialism,

69
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:22,405
you are now on the side of the angels.

70
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:25,645
And angels can be useful to us.

71
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:52,925
Come.

72
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:04,845
Mr Shelby, the violin teacher
wants to know what all those bangs were.

73
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,285
Fireworks.

74
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:09,045
Was trying them out for Saturday.

75
00:11:12,325 --> 00:11:15,085
You promised the doctor
not until after dark.

76
00:11:16,365 --> 00:11:18,205
Oh, it's pretty dark, Frances.

77
00:11:21,485 --> 00:11:22,925
Also,

78
00:11:23,045 --> 00:11:26,325
will Mrs Shelby and Ruby be home
for dinner tonight?

79
00:11:26,445 --> 00:11:27,725
I don't know.

80
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,165
Dad?

81
00:11:39,245 --> 00:11:41,445
I've learned something this morning.

82
00:11:41,565 --> 00:11:42,965
Have you?

83
00:11:45,845 --> 00:11:47,085
So have I.

84
00:11:48,405 --> 00:11:49,765
And what have you learned, my boy?

85
00:12:12,685 --> 00:12:15,805
Let's get this over with.
I've got a train to catch.

86
00:12:15,925 --> 00:12:17,805
Go get your train, Tom.
I can deal with this.

87
00:12:17,925 --> 00:12:18,925
Oi.

88
00:12:19,045 --> 00:12:21,725
Get it!

89
00:12:41,045 --> 00:12:42,845
Go home.

90
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:46,805
Come here, you.

91
00:12:46,925 --> 00:12:49,045
Put this on.

92
00:12:49,165 --> 00:12:51,685
There you go.
Look at that, it looks great on you.

93
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,485
Wrap up warm.

94
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:06,605
Ah!

95
00:13:06,725 --> 00:13:07,885
Wake up.

96
00:13:09,165 --> 00:13:11,165
Rise and shine.

97
00:13:11,285 --> 00:13:12,285
What are you doing here?

98
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:14,405
Wasting our fucking time on you.

99
00:13:18,805 --> 00:13:20,405
Sit down, Finn.

100
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:22,565
Sit down.

101
00:13:29,565 --> 00:13:30,805
What do I have to do...

102
00:13:32,085 --> 00:13:34,205
...to make you fucking listen to me?

103
00:13:34,325 --> 00:13:37,325
You took a bullet.

104
00:13:37,445 --> 00:13:40,245
You've been running around the streets
with a fucking gun in your hand.

105
00:13:42,085 --> 00:13:43,565
Somebody has to.

106
00:13:46,165 --> 00:13:48,565
Finn, we've got people
for that kind of work.

107
00:13:48,685 --> 00:13:52,325
Soldiers. Captains and corporals.

108
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:53,725
Well, then, what am I?

109
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:56,325
"What am I?" Jesus Christ.

110
00:13:56,445 --> 00:13:59,605
Yeah, what am I, Tom, huh?

111
00:13:59,725 --> 00:14:01,485
I'm the brother you never got round to.

112
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:05,005
You're a general, Finn.

113
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,285
You understand?

114
00:14:06,405 --> 00:14:09,605
You're a fucking Shelby,
so you're a general.

115
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:13,725
When did you last see a general
anywhere near the blood and the puke, eh?

116
00:14:15,085 --> 00:14:17,285
He's fucking right.

117
00:14:17,405 --> 00:14:19,165
That's what you are.

118
00:14:19,285 --> 00:14:21,685
So on your feet, soldier.

119
00:14:21,805 --> 00:14:23,405
Come on, on your feet.

120
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:26,125
I thought you just said I was a general.

121
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:27,885
I did just say you were.

122
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:29,365
So get on your fucking feet!

123
00:14:29,485 --> 00:14:31,165
Arthur...

124
00:14:31,285 --> 00:14:33,565
Finn. Finn.

125
00:14:33,685 --> 00:14:34,805
Look at this.

126
00:14:34,925 --> 00:14:38,925
This is the bullet
that Aberama Gold cut from you.

127
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,485
First and last.

128
00:14:42,885 --> 00:14:45,365
First and last.

129
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:51,685
Don't lose it.

130
00:14:52,965 --> 00:14:55,685
Go and clean up, put some clothes on.

131
00:14:55,805 --> 00:14:57,445
A nice suit.

132
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:59,965
I've got some trouble
that'll keep you out of trouble.

133
00:15:01,645 --> 00:15:04,085
- Oh, and, erm, Tom...
- Yeah?

134
00:15:04,205 --> 00:15:05,605
...while you're here,

135
00:15:05,725 --> 00:15:07,965
erm, I've met this girl

136
00:15:08,085 --> 00:15:10,301
- and I'd like to get married.
- Fuck off. Go, get dressed.

137
00:15:10,325 --> 00:15:11,325
Go on, move.

138
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:12,685
Go!

139
00:15:12,805 --> 00:15:14,845
Finn, this girl you're trying to impress,

140
00:15:14,965 --> 00:15:16,365
tell me about her.

141
00:15:17,405 --> 00:15:18,805
She likes the life.

142
00:15:18,925 --> 00:15:21,045
She likes the life, eh?

143
00:15:21,165 --> 00:15:22,485
Well, find one that hates it.

144
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:25,645
Look at him, that's what he did.
Now he's chairman of the board.

145
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:29,685
Go on. Hurry up.

146
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:31,845
Arthur?

147
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:35,525
Lizzie and Ruby, are they still at yours?

148
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:40,445
Yes, Tom, they're still there.

149
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,085
She's coming home today, she said, so...

150
00:15:43,205 --> 00:15:44,605
...she'll be home later.

151
00:15:45,685 --> 00:15:48,365
Hm. Has she been talking about me?

152
00:15:48,485 --> 00:15:51,325
I mean, they talk a lot,
you know what women are like.

153
00:15:51,445 --> 00:15:54,325
The kitchen and, you know,
kids running around.

154
00:15:54,445 --> 00:15:56,445
I... I don't pay 'em no mind, Tom.

155
00:15:56,565 --> 00:15:58,445
- I don't listen to 'em 'alf the time.
- Yeah.

156
00:15:59,685 --> 00:16:01,125
Well, everything she says is true.

157
00:16:05,285 --> 00:16:06,565
Well...

158
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:10,125
...you like the life, Tommy.

159
00:16:10,245 --> 00:16:12,205
I don't like the fucking life.

160
00:16:12,325 --> 00:16:14,045
I don't like the fucking life,

161
00:16:14,165 --> 00:16:16,445
I don't like
that Michael is coming back today.

162
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:22,125
Train arrives from Liverpool at three.

163
00:16:22,245 --> 00:16:23,525
Polly will be there.

164
00:16:23,645 --> 00:16:24,765
Take a weapon.

165
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:28,085
Tell Moss to clear the station of coppers.

166
00:16:28,205 --> 00:16:29,445
You hear me?

167
00:16:29,565 --> 00:16:30,605
Yes, sir.

168
00:16:32,965 --> 00:16:34,765
Hey, Tommy.

169
00:16:36,485 --> 00:16:38,445
I heard 'em say one thing, though.

170
00:16:39,725 --> 00:16:42,965
Just talking, you know,
they were saying that, er,

171
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:46,565
you... you don't sleep or something.

172
00:16:46,685 --> 00:16:48,165
You can't sleep.

173
00:16:50,245 --> 00:16:53,405
When I do sleep, I dream.

174
00:16:54,685 --> 00:16:58,485
And in my dream,
someone wants my crown.

175
00:16:58,605 --> 00:17:00,965
I think it might be Michael.

176
00:17:02,085 --> 00:17:03,925
Call me at three.

177
00:17:10,925 --> 00:17:13,045
Arthur, I'm gonna put
that bullet on a necklace

178
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,365
and wear it as a reminder.

179
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,885
Arthur?

180
00:17:17,005 --> 00:17:19,365
- I heard you.
- You got trouble for me, then?

181
00:17:19,485 --> 00:17:20,965
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

182
00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:38,645
Mr Shelby,
the... the police are here to see you.

183
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:40,165
Police aren't allowed in here.

184
00:17:40,285 --> 00:17:43,285
Er, he's not in uniform
and said it's very unofficial.

185
00:17:48,805 --> 00:17:51,325
Afternoon. Someone get you some tea?

186
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,765
No, I'm fine, Mr Shelby.

187
00:17:52,885 --> 00:17:54,165
- This won't take long.
- Good.

188
00:17:55,245 --> 00:17:57,125
You've got five minutes.

189
00:17:57,245 --> 00:18:01,685
Mr Shelby,
there was a shooting two days ago.

190
00:18:01,805 --> 00:18:03,525
A man died.

191
00:18:03,645 --> 00:18:05,045
It was a murder.

192
00:18:07,165 --> 00:18:08,205
In Maida Vale.

193
00:18:09,645 --> 00:18:10,725
Of all places.

194
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,325
- His name was Levitt.
- Uh-huh.

195
00:18:18,005 --> 00:18:19,525
He was a journalist.

196
00:18:30,365 --> 00:18:33,365
The night before he was shot,
he came here to see you.

197
00:18:33,485 --> 00:18:37,845
We found a Commons pass
and your name in his diary.

198
00:18:37,965 --> 00:18:42,365
I was wondering
what his business here was.

199
00:18:43,685 --> 00:18:44,845
And I'm wondering...

200
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:47,965
...what your business here is.

201
00:18:49,845 --> 00:18:52,605
According to his diary,
you knew him from Birmingham.

202
00:18:52,725 --> 00:18:53,965
What's your name?

203
00:18:55,245 --> 00:18:56,285
Stacker.

204
00:18:56,405 --> 00:18:58,205
Stacker. OK.

205
00:19:00,645 --> 00:19:03,805
Mr Shelby, Mr Levitt was a queer.

206
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:05,925
Some may think
it was one of his queer friends...

207
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:07,605
Mr Stacker,

208
00:19:07,725 --> 00:19:11,285
I get the feeling that,
with a little provocation,

209
00:19:11,405 --> 00:19:13,245
you could be very persistent.

210
00:19:13,365 --> 00:19:15,565
Only within my remit.

211
00:19:15,685 --> 00:19:17,965
Well, your Chief Constable Wyatt,

212
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:21,565
he has clear views about persistence,
which he has shared with me.

213
00:19:21,685 --> 00:19:22,725
Mr Shelby...

214
00:19:22,845 --> 00:19:26,485
He likes persistence, as do I.
And thoroughness.

215
00:19:26,605 --> 00:19:27,845
But not frivolity.

216
00:19:29,445 --> 00:19:35,565
A man who walks in the park with other men
dies in Maida Vale.

217
00:19:35,685 --> 00:19:37,805
And you come to me?

218
00:19:37,925 --> 00:19:40,725
As well as his diary,
we have his notebook.

219
00:19:43,365 --> 00:19:46,045
Your time's up, Mr Stacker.

220
00:19:55,325 --> 00:19:56,565
Thank you.

221
00:20:36,605 --> 00:20:37,725
Hello, Mum.

222
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:41,925
This is Gina.

223
00:20:43,045 --> 00:20:44,525
Gina Gray.

224
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,085
The captain married us on board.

225
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:52,725
She's my wife, Mum. At least look at her.

226
00:20:52,845 --> 00:20:56,565
Tommy said to ask you
to tell me the truth.

227
00:20:57,645 --> 00:21:00,245
We've been travelling for 15 days,
Mrs Gray.

228
00:21:00,365 --> 00:21:01,861
Maybe we could talk about this
at another time.

229
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:02,885
Yes.

230
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:04,205
Let's go home and we can talk.

231
00:21:04,325 --> 00:21:08,685
You have no home
until you tell me the truth.

232
00:21:08,805 --> 00:21:10,245
Here?

233
00:21:10,365 --> 00:21:12,285
Yeah.

234
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:16,285
Michael!

235
00:21:19,085 --> 00:21:20,445
Hello, love.

236
00:21:22,005 --> 00:21:25,005
Welcome to Birmingham, eh?

237
00:21:26,365 --> 00:21:28,165
Michael?

238
00:21:29,645 --> 00:21:30,845
OK.

239
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:35,205
Our ship docked at Belfast.

240
00:21:35,325 --> 00:21:36,965
I was then taken off the ship by two men.

241
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,045
At gunpoint.

242
00:21:38,085 --> 00:21:40,125
I'm speaking to my son.

243
00:21:40,245 --> 00:21:41,405
Fuck you.

244
00:21:42,925 --> 00:21:44,605
Fuck you too, Arthur.

245
00:21:44,725 --> 00:21:49,285
This is my fucking wife.
I bring her home... To this?

246
00:21:52,085 --> 00:21:54,365
Come on, Gina.

247
00:21:57,605 --> 00:22:00,165
Well, where are you going now, eh? Hmm?

248
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:02,005
Introduce me at least.

249
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,325
- Excuse me.
- Look at this.

250
00:22:04,445 --> 00:22:06,365
Look at this.

251
00:22:06,485 --> 00:22:08,405
This is it, Gina.

252
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:11,685
This is my fucking people.

253
00:22:11,805 --> 00:22:13,965
Do you want to know the truth, Arthur?

254
00:22:14,085 --> 00:22:15,485
Do you want to know the truth, Mum?

255
00:22:16,645 --> 00:22:22,045
I did not betray my fucking family!

256
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:25,405
Now, Mum...

257
00:22:26,765 --> 00:22:27,885
...I want to go home.

258
00:22:29,685 --> 00:22:32,605
I've booked you a suite
at the Midland Hotel.

259
00:22:34,085 --> 00:22:36,445
Was that Tommy's orders, then, was it?

260
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:39,725
See, the Midland Hotel
is Tommy's little kingdom.

261
00:22:41,165 --> 00:22:44,125
Where all the porters keep an eye,

262
00:22:44,245 --> 00:22:47,725
where all the telephone exchange girls
are reporting on my calls.

263
00:22:47,845 --> 00:22:54,125
Yeah, well, why don't you think of it
like, er, quarantine, Michael, eh?

264
00:22:54,245 --> 00:22:57,725
We'll treat you like a fucking dog, hmm?

265
00:22:59,405 --> 00:23:00,885
Smelly one.

266
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,285
Stinking one.

267
00:23:03,285 --> 00:23:08,005
Until we know you're clean, hmm?

268
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,085
Fuck you, Arthur.

269
00:23:10,205 --> 00:23:12,005
Stand aside, Arthur.

270
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,685
No, Poll.

271
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:22,605
Come on, baby.

272
00:23:22,725 --> 00:23:24,445
Forget about 'em.

273
00:23:24,565 --> 00:23:27,645
Go and phone Tommy, tell him.

274
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:30,485
Polly says Michael's telling the truth.

275
00:23:30,605 --> 00:23:33,125
It's all right. Forget about 'em.

276
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,245
All right, Poll.

277
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:38,885
Nice coat.

278
00:23:39,005 --> 00:23:40,805
What are you like? Camel, right?

279
00:23:43,645 --> 00:23:44,645
Oh.

280
00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:50,685
Welcome to the family, Gina Gray.

281
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:57,565
I applaud the attempt by Mr Rowley
in the Education Bill

282
00:23:57,685 --> 00:24:00,485
to raise the school leaving age to 15.

283
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,365
I also support...

284
00:24:18,005 --> 00:24:20,525
...as regards means-testing of any kind,

285
00:24:20,645 --> 00:24:22,245
- we are the people...
- Yeah!

286
00:24:22,365 --> 00:24:25,325
- ...we've had enough.
- Yeah!

287
00:24:25,445 --> 00:24:28,445
"We are the people,
and we've had enough."

288
00:24:28,565 --> 00:24:30,285
I move in favour of the amendment.

289
00:24:46,045 --> 00:24:47,245
Mr Shelby.

290
00:24:48,925 --> 00:24:52,325
I must say,
you sing like a songbird in the House.

291
00:24:54,005 --> 00:24:56,125
And who is this pretty finch?

292
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:57,245
My sister.

293
00:24:57,285 --> 00:24:58,325
Who's pregnant.

294
00:24:58,445 --> 00:24:59,605
And dangerous.

295
00:24:59,725 --> 00:25:02,285
Oh, we adore dangerous.

296
00:25:02,405 --> 00:25:03,805
Who's <i>we?</i>

297
00:25:03,925 --> 00:25:06,245
It's a collective noun,

298
00:25:06,365 --> 00:25:10,525
in this case describing a group of people
who are impatient and young and,

299
00:25:10,645 --> 00:25:13,085
as I have said, adore dangerous.

300
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:18,125
Mr Shelby, you had a horse of that name.

301
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,645
Whiskey. Irish.

302
00:25:21,765 --> 00:25:24,165
Give him one from my bottle.

303
00:25:24,285 --> 00:25:26,605
And one for myself.
In fact, bring the bottle.

304
00:25:27,765 --> 00:25:28,765
And the lady?

305
00:25:28,845 --> 00:25:30,365
Isn't thirsty.

306
00:25:30,485 --> 00:25:32,125
How do you know about the horse?

307
00:25:34,005 --> 00:25:36,045
We have a mutual acquaintance.

308
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:38,245
May Carleton.

309
00:25:38,365 --> 00:25:42,165
When I asked about you, she said,
"Oh, my goodness, where do I begin?"

310
00:25:43,565 --> 00:25:45,965
And why were you asking after me?

311
00:25:46,085 --> 00:25:48,525
Because, as I have said,

312
00:25:48,645 --> 00:25:50,485
I adore dangerous.

313
00:25:51,565 --> 00:25:53,245
And where did she begin?

314
00:25:53,365 --> 00:25:56,285
You know, I was rather hoping
we might have this meeting alone.

315
00:25:56,405 --> 00:25:58,845
My sister is my political adviser.

316
00:25:58,965 --> 00:26:02,325
And my advice just now was,
"Don't meet Mr Mosley."

317
00:26:02,445 --> 00:26:04,245
Because I am dangerous?

318
00:26:04,365 --> 00:26:06,245
No.

319
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:09,005
What is it you are impatient for,
Mr Mosley?

320
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:12,845
I'm impatient for my fucking whiskey.

321
00:26:15,405 --> 00:26:16,645
Bennett!

322
00:26:18,925 --> 00:26:20,925
May Carleton spoke about you

323
00:26:21,045 --> 00:26:24,805
the way I imagine one might
about a party they barely remember,

324
00:26:24,925 --> 00:26:27,725
where you crash the car
into the dovecote

325
00:26:27,845 --> 00:26:31,205
and live on champagne and cocaine
for three whole days.

326
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:32,845
You know, that kind of party.

327
00:26:32,965 --> 00:26:35,005
Only three days?

328
00:26:36,325 --> 00:26:37,445
Hmm.

329
00:26:41,405 --> 00:26:44,645
My sister advised against meeting you

330
00:26:44,765 --> 00:26:49,205
because it appears
you are moving away from the party...

331
00:26:50,725 --> 00:26:52,805
...in a different direction.

332
00:26:52,925 --> 00:26:55,125
And which direction is that?

333
00:26:55,245 --> 00:26:57,365
Towards fascism.

334
00:26:57,485 --> 00:27:01,645
"We are the people,
and we have had enough."

335
00:27:03,565 --> 00:27:05,285
I thought that was excellent.

336
00:27:06,565 --> 00:27:09,925
In which direction are you heading,
Mr Shelby?

337
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,765
I am my own revolution.

338
00:27:12,885 --> 00:27:15,565
And you prefer Irish to Scotch.

339
00:27:17,485 --> 00:27:18,725
As do I.

340
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:22,725
Like all things regarding Ireland,
it is... complex.

341
00:27:22,845 --> 00:27:23,885
Yes?

342
00:27:31,165 --> 00:27:32,805
Oh!

343
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:36,805
Where do you stand
on the Irish question, Mr Shelby?

344
00:27:36,925 --> 00:27:39,645
Never been asked it.

345
00:27:39,765 --> 00:27:41,965
Then perhaps it's time you were.

346
00:27:42,085 --> 00:27:46,885
Tommy, I am the people,
and I have had enough.

347
00:27:47,005 --> 00:27:49,565
We are looking for someone
to begin a dialogue...

348
00:27:49,685 --> 00:27:51,965
...with certain elements in Belfast

349
00:27:52,085 --> 00:27:54,925
with whom
we don't officially have any dealings.

350
00:27:55,045 --> 00:27:58,485
I'll be too busy singing in the House.

351
00:27:58,605 --> 00:28:00,725
It would involve a promotion.

352
00:28:02,365 --> 00:28:05,765
Junior Minister to the Duchy of Lancaster.

353
00:28:06,845 --> 00:28:08,565
Birmingham is my concern.

354
00:28:08,685 --> 00:28:13,645
Ireland bores me.
Thanks for the whiskey, Mr Mosley.

355
00:28:20,605 --> 00:28:22,405
Hmm.

356
00:28:22,525 --> 00:28:24,645
What the fuck was that about?

357
00:28:24,765 --> 00:28:27,805
Ireland. It's been Ireland's day
all fucking day long.

358
00:28:27,925 --> 00:28:28,925
What do you mean?

359
00:28:28,965 --> 00:28:32,565
Ada, go home and start calling
anyone who had dealings

360
00:28:32,685 --> 00:28:35,165
with Shelby Company Limited
while you were in Boston.

361
00:28:35,285 --> 00:28:36,445
Ask them about Michael.

362
00:28:38,205 --> 00:28:40,205
Ask them what about him?

363
00:28:40,325 --> 00:28:42,605
Who he's been seeing,
who he's been meeting,

364
00:28:42,725 --> 00:28:45,405
- what deals he's made.
- Why?

365
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:50,085
Ask 'em especially about people
he's met from Glasgow or Belfast.

366
00:28:50,205 --> 00:28:53,565
Tommy,
why don't you come back with me, eh?

367
00:28:53,685 --> 00:28:55,565
You can play chess with Karl.

368
00:28:55,685 --> 00:28:57,525
I'll make some calls,
you can listen in.

369
00:28:57,645 --> 00:28:58,645
Drive home tomorrow.

370
00:28:58,725 --> 00:29:01,325
That bastard starts talking
about Irish whiskey.

371
00:29:01,445 --> 00:29:02,685
The fuck does he know? Eh?

372
00:29:02,805 --> 00:29:05,645
More than me, Tommy.
What are you talking about?

373
00:29:05,765 --> 00:29:08,925
I'm talking about an empty chair, Ada.

374
00:29:09,045 --> 00:29:11,245
My chair. My throne.

375
00:29:11,365 --> 00:29:12,925
People thinking I'm gonna fall,

376
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:15,445
they start behaving
in a different way around you.

377
00:29:15,565 --> 00:29:16,925
Who thinks that?

378
00:29:17,045 --> 00:29:19,205
They start to circle.

379
00:29:19,325 --> 00:29:21,325
Who's going to take the throne, eh?

380
00:29:21,445 --> 00:29:23,765
Linda, she wants some for Arthur,

381
00:29:23,885 --> 00:29:26,325
Aberama Gold, people in the north,
Michael...

382
00:29:31,045 --> 00:29:34,205
Just go home, make some calls.

383
00:29:34,325 --> 00:29:36,205
Protestants are coming, I think.

384
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:38,325
I need to get back to Birmingham.

385
00:29:51,245 --> 00:29:52,845
Polly.

386
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:54,445
Are you armed?

387
00:29:55,805 --> 00:29:57,725
Yeah.

388
00:29:57,845 --> 00:29:59,045
Yeah.

389
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:01,565
Would you please consider
putting your weapons behind the bar

390
00:30:01,605 --> 00:30:04,005
in case feelings begin to run high?

391
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:05,685
Behind the bar, Poll, eh?

392
00:30:06,925 --> 00:30:08,725
Behind my own bar, yeah?

393
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,645
I prefer it there.

394
00:30:19,325 --> 00:30:21,045
Thomas?

395
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,045
I had a dream...

396
00:30:31,165 --> 00:30:34,605
...about a black cat last night, Poll.

397
00:30:36,485 --> 00:30:39,925
A black cat dream
means there is a traitor close by.

398
00:30:40,045 --> 00:30:41,685
It was you who taught me that.

399
00:30:41,805 --> 00:30:44,205
Black cat can mean lots of things.

400
00:30:44,325 --> 00:30:46,765
Can mean you're hurting yourself.

401
00:30:46,885 --> 00:30:48,005
Betraying yourself.

402
00:30:49,485 --> 00:30:51,685
Are you seeing things, Thomas?

403
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:55,205
Yes, I am.

404
00:30:57,045 --> 00:30:59,445
Yes, I am. Very clearly.

405
00:31:01,165 --> 00:31:02,965
Coming from every fucking direction.

406
00:31:17,245 --> 00:31:18,325
Tommy.

407
00:31:19,805 --> 00:31:21,685
I'd like to introduce you to my wife.

408
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:26,245
I would also like to, er, say something.

409
00:31:26,365 --> 00:31:28,885
- Sit down, Michael.
- I betrayed you.

410
00:31:29,005 --> 00:31:31,645
- Michael.
- But only in my heart.

411
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,445
There was a time,

412
00:31:33,565 --> 00:31:35,005
in America,

413
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,445
and there was a lot of money in that bank.

414
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:39,685
And I wondered
if I could... I could leave,

415
00:31:39,805 --> 00:31:41,725
move to California.

416
00:31:41,845 --> 00:31:43,845
Someone said I should invest in pictures.

417
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:46,245
Hollywood.

418
00:31:47,485 --> 00:31:48,925
But Gina stopped me.

419
00:31:50,245 --> 00:31:53,205
- Gina said...
- I told you to sit down, Michael.

420
00:32:01,965 --> 00:32:03,005
Now, tell me...

421
00:32:04,765 --> 00:32:06,885
...what happened on that ship

422
00:32:07,005 --> 00:32:08,725
in Belfast harbour.

423
00:32:11,685 --> 00:32:14,925
On the journey back from New York,
we got married.

424
00:32:15,045 --> 00:32:16,805
But we needed to find a witness.

425
00:32:16,925 --> 00:32:18,125
A purser.

426
00:32:18,245 --> 00:32:19,645
He was from Belfast.

427
00:32:19,765 --> 00:32:20,845
We got friendly.

428
00:32:20,965 --> 00:32:22,365
What happened when the ship docked?

429
00:32:24,605 --> 00:32:29,125
This purser had friends who ran
a whiskey distillery in County Tyrone.

430
00:32:29,245 --> 00:32:31,605
They wanted a way
of getting their stuff into America.

431
00:32:31,725 --> 00:32:34,365
So I said, "OK, invite them aboard."

432
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:37,765
When they came in, I realised
that they didn't make whiskey.

433
00:32:37,885 --> 00:32:39,725
They were Scottish. From Glasgow.

434
00:32:39,845 --> 00:32:42,405
Couldn't understood
a fucking word they were saying.

435
00:32:42,525 --> 00:32:45,045
They started swearing,

436
00:32:45,165 --> 00:32:46,765
so I asked Gina to leave.

437
00:32:47,845 --> 00:32:50,765
That was when they started talking
about you, Tom.

438
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:54,365
They said that Tommy Shelby
was a spent force,

439
00:32:54,485 --> 00:32:56,685
that politics had got to him...

440
00:32:58,205 --> 00:33:00,005
...that he was spent in the head,

441
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:02,685
that now was a good time to move in

442
00:33:02,805 --> 00:33:04,805
and did I want to be part of it.

443
00:33:04,925 --> 00:33:07,485
They knew about the money we lost
in America.

444
00:33:07,605 --> 00:33:09,221
They said that you were going to blame me.

445
00:33:09,245 --> 00:33:11,605
That you had a bullet with my name on it.

446
00:33:14,085 --> 00:33:15,565
What did you say, Michael?

447
00:33:15,685 --> 00:33:17,085
I didn't have time to say anything.

448
00:33:18,245 --> 00:33:20,045
Coppers came on board.

449
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,525
Well, I thought they were coppers.

450
00:33:21,565 --> 00:33:22,725
They, er...

451
00:33:24,205 --> 00:33:25,765
They were IRA.

452
00:33:25,885 --> 00:33:27,045
Exactly.

453
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:35,805
And the first men from Glasgow?

454
00:33:37,605 --> 00:33:42,645
The IRA commander said the men
from Glasgow were called Billy Boys.

455
00:33:43,645 --> 00:33:45,045
Fucking Billy Boys.

456
00:33:45,165 --> 00:33:47,205
I don't know who the fuck Billy Boys are.

457
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:53,045
They run every man in every coalmine,
on every shipyard east of Glasgow.

458
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:57,125
Ties with Belfast, UVF.

459
00:33:57,245 --> 00:33:59,085
Protestant razor gang.

460
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:02,045
They also dabble in politics.

461
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:06,485
You know, muscle for fascist rallies.

462
00:34:06,605 --> 00:34:09,285
But you did no deal, Michael?

463
00:34:09,405 --> 00:34:11,405
You didn't even know who they were?

464
00:34:11,525 --> 00:34:14,245
I was too busy looking forward
to giving you the good news.

465
00:34:15,925 --> 00:34:19,685
The reason Gina and I got married
on the ship was because Gina is pregnant.

466
00:34:21,165 --> 00:34:23,045
You're going to be a grandmother.

467
00:34:31,485 --> 00:34:32,765
OK, Michael.

468
00:34:34,365 --> 00:34:35,725
I believe you.

469
00:34:35,845 --> 00:34:37,165
Welcome home.

470
00:34:38,445 --> 00:34:39,525
Congratulations.

471
00:34:40,685 --> 00:34:42,645
Just remember...

472
00:34:42,765 --> 00:34:47,245
Your unborn child has witnessed
what you said.

473
00:34:47,365 --> 00:34:49,805
- Thomas!
- And it will be born according to...

474
00:34:49,925 --> 00:34:50,925
You fuck!

475
00:34:51,045 --> 00:34:54,405
Where the fuck are you going, hmm?

476
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:56,445
Are you fucking mad, hmm?

477
00:34:58,925 --> 00:35:03,925
- You are free to fucking leave, Michael.
- You fucking bastard.

478
00:35:04,045 --> 00:35:06,245
But you're not free, Michael, are you?

479
00:35:07,965 --> 00:35:10,085
You lost this company a lot of money.

480
00:35:10,205 --> 00:35:11,525
I told you to sell...

481
00:35:13,365 --> 00:35:14,685
...but you held on,

482
00:35:14,805 --> 00:35:19,525
and now I want you to pay me back
what you owe me.

483
00:35:19,645 --> 00:35:23,805
There is work you can do,
there are risks you can take.

484
00:35:23,925 --> 00:35:25,845
We were close before.

485
00:35:25,965 --> 00:35:27,805
Now I want you closer still.

486
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:32,165
Michael, honey.

487
00:35:33,845 --> 00:35:35,205
Look at your cousin.

488
00:35:36,445 --> 00:35:37,805
He's in trouble, huh?

489
00:35:39,245 --> 00:35:40,565
He needs you.

490
00:35:43,365 --> 00:35:45,285
Come on, baby, let's go.

491
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:11,605
Fucking cheek of her, eh?

492
00:36:13,565 --> 00:36:15,645
Mad Dog Jimmy.

493
00:36:15,765 --> 00:36:17,845
Coming south.

494
00:36:22,605 --> 00:36:24,125
Not so mad any more.

495
00:36:24,245 --> 00:36:26,285
He's got friends in high places
these days.

496

A broken broom stops

Ah!

Who the fuck are you?

Did you not hear my song?

These gentlemen are the Billy Boys.

00:38:10,685 --> 00:38:12,405
And me?

508
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,205
I'm Jimmy.

Ah, fuck, fuck.

510
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:21,325
Good.

511
00:38:21,445 --> 00:38:23,925
Mouth broke, so you can't talk.

512
00:38:24,045 --> 00:38:26,525
But you don't need to.

513
00:38:26,645 --> 00:38:29,365
Your body will be the lesson.

514
00:38:30,565 --> 00:38:35,685
You work in a particular capacity
for Mr Thomas Shelby, OBE.

515
00:38:35,805 --> 00:38:37,125
Am I right?

516
00:38:43,925 --> 00:38:45,045
I heard you're a fighter.

517
00:38:47,045 --> 00:38:48,045
The best.

518
00:38:49,805 --> 00:38:52,405
But your fighting days are over.

519
00:38:55,005 --> 00:38:58,605
Because I need Mr Shelby to understand...

520
00:38:58,725 --> 00:39:02,005
...that his best...

521
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:06,445
...is not...good enough.

522
00:39:57,285 --> 00:39:58,285
Bonnie!

523
00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:01,885
Farewell, fighter boy. You died well.

524
00:40:12,325 --> 00:40:14,405
Bonnie...

525
00:40:14,525 --> 00:40:16,125
Bonnie!

526
00:40:29,925 --> 00:40:33,405
Tell Tommy Shelby
it's time to fucking share.

527
00:40:35,645 --> 00:40:38,565
We'll take all the tracks out
as far as Nottingham.

528
00:40:38,685 --> 00:40:40,525
We'll take Cheltenham as well.

529
00:40:42,005 --> 00:40:46,085
Otherwise, it will be Thomas Shelby
who's crucified,

530
00:40:46,205 --> 00:40:48,805
and there will be no resurrection.

531
00:40:52,445 --> 00:40:54,125
Come on, boys.

534
00:41:38,805 --> 00:41:41,725
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm just going to
take a short break. Thank you.

535
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,965
Yeah. Good man.

536
00:41:51,725 --> 00:41:56,565
Beautiful, Billy, beautiful.
Really nice. Really nice.

537
00:42:00,925 --> 00:42:04,245
Really meaningful, you know?
A heartfelt song.

538
00:42:04,365 --> 00:42:07,085
I like it. I really do.

539
00:42:07,205 --> 00:42:11,285
Boys, this here is Billy Grade.

540
00:42:12,525 --> 00:42:14,005
Man I was telling you about, son.

541
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:18,445
- Billy, this here's my kid brother, Finn.
- Hey.

542
00:42:19,885 --> 00:42:22,765
Have a drink, Billy.

543
00:42:22,885 --> 00:42:24,165
I can't, my voice is...

544
00:42:24,285 --> 00:42:26,605
Drink, Bill.

545
00:42:26,725 --> 00:42:27,965
Yeah.

546
00:42:29,085 --> 00:42:30,245
Yeah.

547
00:42:35,405 --> 00:42:37,245
You boys won't remember...

548
00:42:38,365 --> 00:42:42,245
...but I remember when Billy here
made a living on the football pitch.

549
00:42:43,405 --> 00:42:45,885
Oh, yeah, that was a long time ago,
Mr Shelby.

550
00:42:46,005 --> 00:42:47,525
- Yeah, what a left foot, eh?
- Yeah.

551
00:42:49,085 --> 00:42:53,965
And then what? Manager, right? Hmm?

552
00:42:54,085 --> 00:42:56,645
Well, yeah, and now I'm a singer.

553
00:42:56,765 --> 00:42:57,925
Are you?

554
00:42:59,005 --> 00:43:03,925
Every football team in England
knows Billy Grade.

555
00:43:04,045 --> 00:43:07,805
And he knows a few people, too.
Don't you, Bill, eh? Hmm?

556
00:43:07,925 --> 00:43:10,165
- One or two.
- Useful.

557
00:43:11,325 --> 00:43:13,685
Very useful.

558
00:43:13,805 --> 00:43:15,805
But what do you do, Bill, eh?

559
00:43:15,925 --> 00:43:17,685
Hmm?

560
00:43:17,805 --> 00:43:22,285
You're in here, singing -
or whatever the fuck you call it -

561
00:43:22,405 --> 00:43:25,645
in shit-hole pubs in Birmingham.

562
00:43:28,605 --> 00:43:30,885
It's no way to make a living, boys.

563
00:43:31,965 --> 00:43:34,165
- Degrading.
- I love it.

564
00:43:34,285 --> 00:43:36,445
I really do, I love it.

565
00:43:37,605 --> 00:43:40,805
And thank you, by the way,
for inviting me here tonight.

566
00:43:40,925 --> 00:43:42,581
I really appreciate it,
so thank you very much.

567
00:43:42,605 --> 00:43:44,045
Don't thank me.

568
00:43:44,165 --> 00:43:46,085
I didn't invite you here to sing.

569
00:43:48,205 --> 00:43:52,605
If I wanted to listen to music,
I'd buy an Al Jolson record. Hmm?

570
00:43:52,725 --> 00:43:54,885
That's what I'd do.

571
00:43:55,005 --> 00:43:57,325
Real singer, you know?

572
00:43:57,445 --> 00:43:58,925
Melody.

573
00:43:59,045 --> 00:44:00,845
Tune.

574
00:44:02,925 --> 00:44:05,645
So what is it that you want... exactly?

575
00:44:09,325 --> 00:44:13,165
Finn will explain
the nature of my proposition.

576
00:44:14,725 --> 00:44:16,805
You'll listen to him, won't you, Bill, eh?

577
00:44:16,925 --> 00:44:19,645
- You'll be attentive, won't you?
- Yeah, of course, course.

578
00:44:19,765 --> 00:44:20,765
Because Isiah here,

579
00:44:20,805 --> 00:44:24,125
he'll show you the fucking consequences
if you don't.

580
00:44:26,605 --> 00:44:27,845
All right?

581
00:44:30,925 --> 00:44:33,205
I'll leave you with the bottle, hmm?

582
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:49,285
What proposition?

583
00:44:49,405 --> 00:44:52,325
Right, what I want from you, Billy,

584
00:44:52,445 --> 00:44:57,165
is for you to write down
a name and a number

585
00:44:57,285 --> 00:44:59,925
next to every one of those football teams,
yeah?

586
00:45:00,045 --> 00:45:01,725
- Why?
- Why?

587
00:45:01,845 --> 00:45:03,901
People like to bet on those kind of things
these days.

588
00:45:03,925 --> 00:45:06,045
- We are a gambling enterprise.
- I know who you are.

589
00:45:06,165 --> 00:45:09,925
To fix a horse race,
you give the outsider a bit of cocaine.

590
00:45:10,045 --> 00:45:11,805
- Jesus!
- To fix a football match,

591
00:45:11,925 --> 00:45:14,285
you give the goalkeeper £20.

592
00:45:25,685 --> 00:45:28,565
You're a Peaky Blinder now, Billy.

593
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:29,845
Hmm?

594
00:45:38,005 --> 00:45:40,005
What have you got there?

595
00:45:41,565 --> 00:45:42,885
I've written a letter.

596
00:45:43,005 --> 00:45:44,405
Oh.

597
00:45:47,525 --> 00:45:48,885
Who for?

598
00:45:49,005 --> 00:45:50,765
For you.

599
00:45:50,885 --> 00:45:52,925
And Lizzie's written one to Tommy.

600
00:45:55,765 --> 00:45:57,005
Well...

601
00:45:58,125 --> 00:45:59,445
...can I read it?

602
00:45:59,565 --> 00:46:00,965
It's not finished yet.

603
00:46:02,285 --> 00:46:04,445
I'm getting rid of the parts
I wrote when I was drunk.

604
00:46:06,165 --> 00:46:08,085
By the way, I've stopped drinking.

605
00:46:08,205 --> 00:46:11,045
And your bottles of snow
I poured down the lavatory.

606
00:46:12,565 --> 00:46:14,325
When I was drunk, I was too hard on you.

607
00:46:14,445 --> 00:46:15,965
It's... it's not your fault.

608
00:46:21,165 --> 00:46:22,525
So...

609
00:46:24,685 --> 00:46:26,445
That letter's about me, is it?

610
00:46:26,565 --> 00:46:27,645
Yeah.

611
00:46:28,925 --> 00:46:30,725
- Hmm.
- And about me.

612
00:46:31,965 --> 00:46:33,885
About the future. About the company.

613
00:46:35,925 --> 00:46:37,005
Lizzie and I...

614
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:40,245
Sat here and made things worse
the last few hours, hmm?

615
00:46:40,365 --> 00:46:42,365
Yeah, and we've come up with a plan.

616
00:46:42,485 --> 00:46:44,525
Oh, you've come up with a plan, eh?

617
00:46:44,645 --> 00:46:47,341
Lizzie says Tommy won't live
two more years if he carries on like this.

618
00:46:47,365 --> 00:46:48,365
He's gone too far.

619
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:49,965
Is that what Lizzie says, hmm?

620
00:46:50,085 --> 00:46:51,245
Really now?

621
00:46:51,365 --> 00:46:54,005
Well, how far has he gone, hmm, Linda?
How far?

622
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:56,325
He's lost all the legitimate money
in America.

623
00:46:56,445 --> 00:46:58,685
No. No, that was Michael.

624
00:46:58,805 --> 00:47:01,685
He's fixing races. He's fixing football.

625
00:47:01,805 --> 00:47:04,725
Following the financial crisis,
the Shelby Company Limited

626
00:47:04,845 --> 00:47:08,045
has to find other sources of cash income.

627
00:47:08,165 --> 00:47:09,845
Tommy went into Chinatown.

628
00:47:09,965 --> 00:47:13,445
He's selling out the Communists
to the British intelligence.

629
00:47:13,565 --> 00:47:16,325
And all the time, every day,
he gets more and more famous.

630
00:47:16,445 --> 00:47:17,645
But that's OK.

631
00:47:17,765 --> 00:47:19,925
Because if anyone puts
two and two together...

632
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:21,245
That wasn't us.

633
00:47:21,365 --> 00:47:22,925
It's not fucking us!

634
00:47:23,045 --> 00:47:25,805
It's going to blow up, Arthur!
It can't sustain.

635
00:47:25,925 --> 00:47:28,285
- You know it.
- Oh, yeah? And what do you know, eh?

636
00:47:28,405 --> 00:47:29,965
You've worked it all out.

637
00:47:30,085 --> 00:47:32,125
You and fucking Lizzie, eh?

638
00:47:32,245 --> 00:47:35,845
Got it all planned out, is that right?

639
00:47:35,965 --> 00:47:38,045
And I tell you,

640
00:47:38,165 --> 00:47:42,125
all you're gonna do
is you're gonna be the good fucking wife.

641
00:47:42,245 --> 00:47:44,925
Yeah, like the perfect couple.

642
00:47:45,045 --> 00:47:47,045
We'll go upstairs, hmm?

643
00:47:47,165 --> 00:47:49,765
We'll go upstairs.

644
00:47:49,885 --> 00:47:52,405
Yeah, make love, hmm?

645
00:48:03,045 --> 00:48:06,525
I spent my day writing two letters
and deciding which one to give.

646
00:48:08,605 --> 00:48:10,445
Looks like I'll have to give
the other one.

647
00:48:13,205 --> 00:48:14,485
What other one?

648
00:48:15,485 --> 00:48:17,445
What fucking other one?!

649
00:48:20,525 --> 00:48:22,005
What did you do with my letter?

650
00:48:34,285 --> 00:48:35,445
I burnt it.

651
00:48:37,525 --> 00:48:38,685
So did Arthur.

652
00:48:40,845 --> 00:48:43,365
- Did you read it first?
- Yes.

653
00:48:44,565 --> 00:48:45,845
That's more than Arthur did.

654
00:48:51,685 --> 00:48:53,725
Didn't help that you can't fucking spell.

655
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:56,965
I left school too early.

656
00:48:58,165 --> 00:49:00,205
Did you read the bit about the lawyers?

657
00:49:00,325 --> 00:49:01,485
Do you want to fuck?

658
00:49:02,925 --> 00:49:04,045
Didn't think so.

659
00:49:06,685 --> 00:49:08,325
- You don't want to eat?
- No.

660
00:49:09,525 --> 00:49:10,845
- You've got calls?
- Yeah.

661
00:49:19,725 --> 00:49:21,685
It's Ruby's birthday today, Tommy.

662
00:49:25,125 --> 00:49:27,965
Do you know why I took her to Arthur's?

663
00:49:28,085 --> 00:49:29,845
Because she said she's scared of you.

664
00:49:31,645 --> 00:49:34,365
When she knows you're not coming home,
she's a different kid.

665
00:49:36,485 --> 00:49:38,005
But I've bought a cake.

666
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:39,365
And I want you there.

667
00:49:40,525 --> 00:49:41,765
We're in the drawing room.

668
00:49:46,325 --> 00:49:47,325
Lizzie...

669
00:49:52,845 --> 00:49:54,165
I'm in a room...

670
00:49:55,565 --> 00:49:57,605
...and they're coming at me.

671
00:49:59,765 --> 00:50:01,485
It's OK. I want 'em to.

672
00:50:03,365 --> 00:50:05,045
Last thing I want is silence.

673
00:50:07,285 --> 00:50:08,925
Standing up there, in silence,

674
00:50:09,045 --> 00:50:10,365
and someone says...

675
00:50:13,245 --> 00:50:15,685
..."Sorry about all that noise.

676
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:19,245
"Sorry about all that... dust.

677
00:50:20,285 --> 00:50:22,365
"Sorry about all that mud.

678
00:50:22,485 --> 00:50:24,525
"And all that fucking blood."

679
00:50:26,085 --> 00:50:28,405
And you say, "Don't be sorry.

680
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,525
"Don't be sorry. It's all I can do now."

681
00:50:35,005 --> 00:50:37,125
You want me to write this down?

682
00:50:39,885 --> 00:50:41,845
Do you want me
to write you a fucking letter?

683
00:50:44,725 --> 00:50:46,525
Me and Arthur can't write it down...

684
00:50:48,005 --> 00:50:50,325
...cos they haven't invented
the fucking words.

685
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:56,405
We don't have the fucking words.

686
00:50:59,845 --> 00:51:01,125
And the worst thing is...

687
00:51:03,245 --> 00:51:04,765
...could've stayed at school.

688
00:51:06,085 --> 00:51:08,165
But we volunteered.

689
00:51:10,205 --> 00:51:12,325
Still don't have the fucking words.

690
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:23,525
Should you choose to depart, Tommy,

691
00:51:23,645 --> 00:51:25,925
either by your own hand
or someone else's,

692
00:51:26,045 --> 00:51:28,605
the person who would take your place
is me.

693
00:51:29,885 --> 00:51:31,045
Legally.

694
00:51:31,165 --> 00:51:32,805
Financially.

695
00:51:32,925 --> 00:51:34,005
Everything.

696
00:51:35,245 --> 00:51:37,045
I need to know there'll be something left.

697
00:51:38,245 --> 00:51:41,405
Well, you know, Lizzie, in my head,
I still pay you for it, so...

698
00:51:42,685 --> 00:51:44,285
...good luck with me.

699
00:51:51,925 --> 00:51:53,525
I have business.

700
00:52:18,565 --> 00:52:21,885
♪ Happy birthday to you

701
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:26,005
♪ Happy birthday to you... ♪

702
00:52:26,125 --> 00:52:28,085
Yeah, I wanna ask you some questions...

703
00:52:29,285 --> 00:52:31,445
...about the night you met Michael Gray.

704
00:52:38,845 --> 00:52:40,365
Make a wish.

705
00:52:40,485 --> 00:52:42,085
Yeah!

706
00:53:07,285 --> 00:53:09,285
OK, kids, come on, let's go to bed.
Quickly.

707
00:53:09,405 --> 00:53:10,805
- Why?
- Who's coming?

708
00:53:10,925 --> 00:53:14,125
That's the thing, Charles, we don't know.
We never know.

709
00:53:35,405 --> 00:53:36,565
Tommy!

710
00:53:39,325 --> 00:53:41,365
- Get out of the fucking car.
- Don't!

711
00:53:41,485 --> 00:53:45,085
Get out of the fucking car now,
or I'll open fire!

712
00:53:53,845 --> 00:53:55,885
If you're looking for traitors,

713
00:53:56,005 --> 00:54:00,205
there's one... with his ribs mashed up.

714
00:54:00,325 --> 00:54:03,445
The man's gone fucking mad, Tom!

715
00:54:03,565 --> 00:54:05,605
You did this?

716
00:54:05,725 --> 00:54:07,685
With one arm and a hammer.

717
00:54:08,765 --> 00:54:12,565
And a mighty pain... and a mighty fury!

718
00:54:15,525 --> 00:54:16,925
They killed him.

719
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:20,245
My son!

720
00:54:21,245 --> 00:54:24,765
They shot him and they put him
up on a fucking cross,

721
00:54:24,885 --> 00:54:26,565
and he's fucking dead!

722
00:54:27,605 --> 00:54:28,925
Who did?

723
00:54:42,005 --> 00:54:45,245
Only Johnny Dogs and his kin knew
where we were camped.

724
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,925
No, Tom. No.
I swear to God, I never told a soul.

725
00:54:48,045 --> 00:54:50,565
- Get the fuck away!
- I never told a fucking soul.

726
00:54:50,685 --> 00:54:53,445
How could you fucking do this?!
My fucking son!

727
00:54:56,565 --> 00:54:58,085
They fucking took him from me!

728
00:54:58,205 --> 00:55:01,605
My only... son!

729
00:55:01,725 --> 00:55:02,885
Johnny!

730
00:55:03,005 --> 00:55:04,565
Tommy!

731
00:55:04,685 --> 00:55:06,445
Your shoulder is shattered.

732
00:55:06,565 --> 00:55:08,885
If you don't get it fixed,
you'll lose your arm.

733
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:11,445
He's gone! Fucking killed him!

734
00:55:11,565 --> 00:55:14,485
Fucking son! My own fucking kin!

735
00:55:14,605 --> 00:55:15,965
Listen to me!

736
00:55:16,085 --> 00:55:20,405
How can a one-armed man
avenge the death of his son, eh?

737
00:55:26,165 --> 00:55:28,325
They crucified my son...

738
00:55:30,565 --> 00:55:31,725
...for you.

739
00:55:40,205 --> 00:55:44,445
Get away from my house! All of you!

740
00:55:44,565 --> 00:55:48,245
Get away from my child!

741
00:55:48,365 --> 00:55:50,685
This is my house.

742
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,965
And I don't want you back.

743
00:55:53,085 --> 00:55:55,165
I don't want you back!

744
00:56:13,605 --> 00:56:15,325
If you want to take on the Billy Boys,

745
00:56:15,445 --> 00:56:16,525
you need me alive.

746
00:56:18,805 --> 00:56:21,005
Everyone fucking needs me.

747
00:56:23,965 --> 00:56:25,885
Call an ambulance,

748
00:56:26,005 --> 00:56:28,685
or a man will lose his arm.

749
00:56:48,565 --> 00:56:50,125
Come on, Johnny.

750
00:56:50,245 --> 00:56:52,485
Come on.

751
00:56:55,085 --> 00:56:56,165
Tom...

752
00:56:58,525 --> 00:57:00,565
I'm no black cat, Tom.

753
00:57:00,685 --> 00:57:02,525
I know, Johnny. I know.

754
00:57:04,165 --> 00:57:06,925
In all the world, of all of the people,

755
00:57:07,045 --> 00:57:08,965
you alone I know I can trust.
