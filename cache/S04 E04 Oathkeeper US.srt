1
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:03,832
"My name is Grey Worm."

2
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,588
"I come from the Summer Ills."

3
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,298
"Isles."

4
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:18,888
-"Summer Isles."
-"Summer Isles."

5
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,065
I am from an island called Naath.

6
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:36,990
-When they took you?
-"When did they take me?"

7
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:44,455
-I was five years old.
-You remember your home?

8
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,585
I remember when
they rowed us away from shore.

9
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:54,132
How white the beaches were.

10
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,594
How tall the trees.

11
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,474
And I remember my village burning.

12
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,478
Smoke rising into the sky.

13
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,530
Do you remember your home?

14
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,744
Unsullied. Always Unsullied.

15
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:28,541
-Before Unsullied, nothing.
-That's not true.

16
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,880
Perhaps one day you will return
to the Summer Isles.

17
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,298
I don't want return.

18
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:44,307
-"Kill the masters."
-Kill the masters.

19
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,102
How are the lessons coming?

20
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:54,776
-Very well, Your Grace.
-Missandei is teacher good, my queen.

21
00:03:58,237 --> 00:03:59,530
You'll have to continue later.

22
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,534
It's time.

23
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,683
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

24
00:07:56,267 --> 00:08:00,146
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

25
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:41,437
Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa! Mhysa!

26
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,398
Remind me, Ser Jorah,

27
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,818
how many children did
the Great Masters nail to mileposts?

28
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,196
One hundred and sixty-three, Khaleesi.

29
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,949
Yes, that was it.

30
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,918
Your Grace, may I have a word?

31
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,300
The city is yours.

32
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,886
All these people,
they're your subjects now.

33
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:19,475
Sometimes it is better
to answer injustice with mercy.

34
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,646
I will answer injustice with justice.

35
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,185
What the hell was that?

36
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:49,357
That was me knocking your ass
to the dirt with your own hand.

37
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:56,238
You're a rare talent.
When you're fighting cripples, anyway.

38
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,201
You learned to fight
like a good little boy.

39
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,495
I'll bet that thrust
through the Mad King's back

40
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,537
was pretty as a picture.

41
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,082
You want to fight pretty
or you want to win?

42
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,876
-You talk to my brother this way?
-All the time.

43
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:10,961
He got used to it.

44
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,471
Do you think he did it?

45
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:22,515
No.

46
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:28,062
He hated the little twat, sure.
But who didn't?

47
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:34,026
And poison's not his style.
Or murder, for that matter.

48
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,322
You want to know for sure,
why don't you ask him?

49
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,829
You haven't been to see him yet, eh?

50
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:46,956
We're done for today.

51
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:54,046
Your brother ever tell you
how I came into his service?

52
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,590
You stood for him in his trial
by combat at the Eyrie.

53
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,342
Aye.

54
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:03,097
But only when Lady Arryn
demanded the trial take place that day.

55
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,474
You were his first choice.

56
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,727
He named you for his champion
because he knew

57
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,230
you would ride day and night
to come fight for him.

58
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,775
You gonna fight for him now?

59
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,369
To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad.

60
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,206
Four walls. A pot to piss in.

61
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,919
I was chained to a wooden post
covered in my own shit for months.

62
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,759
-Is that supposed to make me feel better?
-Maybe a bit.

63
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:49,059
-I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
-It's complicated, yes.

64
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,730
-So how is our sister?
-How do you think?

65
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,857
Her son died in her arms.

66
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,193
Her son?

67
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,029
Don't.

68
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,994
You know what's coming?

69
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,039
My trial for regicide. Yes, I know.

70
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:15,294
I know the whole bloody country
thinks I'm guilty.

71
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,755
I know that one of my three judges

72
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,965
has wished me dead
more times than I can count.

73
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,134
And that judge is my father.

74
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:27,181
As for Cersei,
well, she's probably working on a way

75
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,808
to avoid a trial altogether
by having me killed.

76
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,187
Now that you mention it, she did ask.

77
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,524
So, should I turn around
and close my eyes?

78
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,733
Depends.

79
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,944
Did you do it?

80
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,199
The Kingslayer brothers.
You like it? I like it.

81
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,246
You're really asking if I killed your son?

82
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,332
Are you really asking
if I'd kill my brother?

83
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,129
How can I help you?

84
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,924
Well, you could set me free.

85
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,260
You know I can't.

86
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,013
Then there's really nothing else to say.

87
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,641
What do you want me to do?
Kill the guards?

88
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,643
Sneak you out of the city
in the back of a cart?

89
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,854
-I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
-Sorry, I'd forgotten.

90
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,982
I'd hate for you
to do something inappropriate.

91
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:21,402
Inappropriate?
You're accused of killing the king.

92
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,488
-Freeing you is treason.
-Except I didn't do it.

93
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,407
Which is why we're having a trial.

94
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,784
A trial.

95
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,079
If the killer threw himself
before the Iron Throne,

96
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:36,000
confessed to his crimes, and gave
irrefutable evidence of his guilt,

97
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:40,379
it wouldn't matter to Cersei.
She won't rest until my head's on a spike.

98
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,922
Not just yours.

99
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,135
She's offering a knighthood
to whomever finds Sansa Stark.

100
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,678
Sansa couldn't have done this.

101
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,264
She had more reason
than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms.

102
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,267
Do you think it's a coincidence she
disappeared the same night Joffrey died?

103
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,268
No, but…

104
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,730
Sansa's not a killer.

105
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,359
Not yet, anyway.

106
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,166
Where are you taking me?

107
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:22,463
I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa.
She's waiting for us at the Eyrie.

108
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,631
You'll be safe there.

109
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,604
Did you kill Joffrey?

110
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,190
Did I kill Joffrey?

111
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,235
I've been in the Vale for weeks.

112
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:50,240
-I know it was you.
-And who helped me with this conspiracy?

113
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,203
Well, there was Ser Dontos.

114
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,622
You used him
to get me out of King's Landing,

115
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,457
but you would never trust him

116
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,292
-to kill the king.
-Why not?

117
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,836
Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.

118
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,674
-Then perhaps it was your husband.
-No.

119
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:11,011
-How do you know?
-I just do.

120
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,724
You're right.
He wasn't involved in Joffrey's death.

121
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,102
But you were.

122
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,815
Do you remember
that lovely necklace Dontos gave you?

123
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,860
I don't suppose you noticed
that a stone was missing

124
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,529
after the feast.

125
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:31,865
The poison.

126
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:38,580
I don't understand.
The Lannisters gave you wealth, power.

127
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,416
Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal.

128
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,419
A man with no motive
is a man no one suspects.

129
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,422
Always keep your foes confused.

130
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,007
If they don't know who you are
or what you want,

131
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,969
they can't know what you plan to do next.

132
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,849
I don't believe you.

133
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,520
If they catch you,
they'll put your head on a spike

134
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,646
just like my father's.

135
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,899
You'd risk that just to confuse them?

136
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:11,029
So many men, they risk so little.

137
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:15,909
They spend their lives avoiding danger.
And then they die.

138
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,415
I'd risk everything to get what I want.

139
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,668
And what do you want?

140
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,050
Everything.

141
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:37,514
My friendship with the Lannisters
was productive.

142
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,391
But Joffrey,

143
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:44,897
a vicious boy with a crown on his head,
is not a reliable ally.

144
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:49,026
-And who could trust a friend like that?
-Who could trust you?

145
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:55,365
I don't want friends like me.
My new friends are predictable.

146
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,201
Very reasonable people.

147
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,287
As for what happened to Joffrey, well,

148
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,540
that was something
my new friends wanted very badly.

149
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:09,254
Nothing like a thoughtful gift
to make a new friendship grow strong.

150
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,801
I can't believe you're going.
Leaving me alone here with these people.

151
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,806
The time has come, my dear.
There's nothing more tedious than a trial.

152
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,558
Except perhaps these gardens.

153
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,646
If I have to take one more
leisurely stroll through these gardens,

154
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,689
I'll fling myself from the cliffs.

155
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,110
-Have you been to see Tommen yet?
-No.

156
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,532
Have they even agreed to the match?
No one tells me anything.

157
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:40,994
I wasn't originally meant to marry
your grandfather Luthor, you know.

158
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:45,541
He was engaged to my sister,
your great-aunt Viola.

159
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,211
I was to be given
to some Targaryen or other.

160
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,798
Marrying a Targaryen
was all the rage back then.

161
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:59,012
But the moment I saw my intended,
with his twitchy little ferret's face

162
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:02,140
and ludicrous silver hair,
I knew he wouldn't do.

163
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:08,647
So, the evening before Luthor
was to propose to my sister,

164
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,483
I got lost on my way back
from my embroidery lesson

165
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,777
and happened upon his chamber.

166
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,446
How absentminded of me.

167
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:21,618
The following morning,
Luthor never made it down the stairs

168
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,788
to propose to my sister
'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk.

169
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,749
And once he could,
the only thing he wanted

170
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,002
was what I'd given him the night before.

171
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,590
I was good. I was very, very good.

172
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,971
You are even better.
But you need to act quickly.

173
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,017
Cersei may be vicious,
but she's not stupid.

174
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,061
She'll turn the boy against you
as soon as she can.

175
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,939
And by the time you're married,
it'll be too late.

176
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:55,319
Luckily for you, the Queen Regent
is rather distracted at the moment,

177
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,321
mourning her dear departed boy.

178
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:01,700
Accusing her brother of his murder,
which he didn't commit.

179
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:05,037
-Well, he could have done.
-He could have done, but he didn't.

180
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,915
-You don't know, Grandmother.
-But I do know.

181
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,211
You don't think
I'd let you marry that beast, do you?

182
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:20,177
-What? I don't understand.
-Don't you worry yourself about all that.

183
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,640
You just do what needs to be done.

184
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:27,893
Bring it through!

185
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:37,945
And again.

186
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,245
Very nice. Good.

187
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:50,123
A lot of wildlings fight
with a weapon in each hand.

188
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,671
First thing you want to do
is disarm them to try and even the odds.

189
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,269
Let's see what you can do.

190
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,274
-Olly, you just watch for now.
-I can fight.

191
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,362
-Have you ever held a sword before?
-I was the best archer in our hamlet.

192
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,366
-I was!
-I believe you.

193
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,412
We'll go hunting for rabbits one day.
Right now, watch and learn.

194
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:35,836
You two. Take it slow,
try and disarm each other.

195
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:05,824
You know how to fight.
You could have gone easier on him.

196
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,744
He wouldn't have learned
anything that way.

197
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,746
Lord Snow.

198
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,665
What do you think you're doing?

199
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,962
-Grenn and I were helping them.
-Grenn's a ranger. You're a steward.

200
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:22,132
Maybe you forgot that while you were off
with your wildling bitch,

201
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:23,467
but I didn't.

202
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:28,055
-Someone has to train them.
-And that someone isn't you.

203
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,474
Go find a chamber pot to empty.

204
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,103
Go on. Do it.

205
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,689
You traitor's bastard.

206
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:42,611
Give me an excuse.
Mormont's not here to protect you now.

207
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,417
Get back to work. Now!

208
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,921
I said now!

209
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:07,385
The bastard's well-liked. You're not.

210
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,388
What, you think I care
if they like me? We're at war.

211
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,389
For now.

212
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,892
But you can't be acting commander forever.

213
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:18,063
There will be a choosing.
The old maester will insist on it.

214
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:22,859
You might reconsider his request
to march on Craster's.

215
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,155
Let the mutineers take care of Snow.

216
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,492
Or you might be taking orders
from him the rest of your life.

217
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,470
A bastard, eh? Took you for highborn.

218
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:56,726
My father was highborn. My mother… wasn't.

219
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:00,772
Name's Locke.

220
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,943
Jon Snow.

221
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:13,160
-You fight well. What brought you up here?
-A sense of duty.

222
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,705
I wanted to do my part
for the safety of the realm.

223
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,713
I was a game warden in the Stormlands.
Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids.

224
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:28,717
I was stupid enough to get caught.
Chose the Wall over losing my hand.

225
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,554
Figured I wouldn't have to suck up
to any highborn cunts here.

226
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,974
Come on, get on with it.
What are you waiting for? Summer?

227
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,018
Guess I was wrong.

228
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,625
-You sent for me, Your Grace?
-Your Grace.

229
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,127
How formal of you.

230
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,507
How many Kingsguards
are posted outside Tommen's door?

231
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,136
Ser Boros is on duty tonight.

232
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,679
-Tomorrow I believe--
-So one?

233
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,892
You have one man guarding the future king?

234
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,896
I promise you, Tommen's safe.
We're protecting him.

235
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,357
The way you protected Joffrey?

236
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,444
Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?

237
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,072
-What?
-I've been wondering for months.

238
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,117
Ever since that great cow
brought you back to the capital.

239
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,038
-Why did she set you free?
-You know why.

240
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,957
She'd hoped I'd send
her daughters back to her.

241
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,799
-She hoped or did you promise?
-I swore by all the gods

242
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,051
that if her daughters were alive,
I'd return them to her.

243
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,011
So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.

244
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,639
I wanted to get back to you.

245
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:02,352
-Should I have told her to fuck off?
-You didn't mean it, then?

246
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:07,232
-You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?
-Catelyn Stark's dead.

247
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:10,360
So if I told you to leave the capital
right now and find Sansa,

248
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:14,030
if I told you to find
that murderous little bitch,

249
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:15,865
and bring me her head,

250
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,326
would you do it?

251
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,083
I know you went to see Tyrion.

252
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:31,089
That creature who murdered our son.

253
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:37,470
I had to see him.
I had to know for myself.

254
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:39,723
And?

255
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,810
He didn't do it, Cersei.

256
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:48,523
You've always pitied him.
Our poor little brother.

257
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:53,403
Abused by the world.
Despised by his father and sister.

258
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:55,864
He'd kill us all if he could.

259
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:02,120
I want four men at Tommen's door
day and night.

260
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,124
That will be all, Lord Commander.

261
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:42,660
Ser Pounce?

262
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,637
-How did you get past the Kingsguard?
-Kingsguard.

263
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,267
I don't think you're supposed to be here.

264
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,646
Mother doesn't allow me
to have visitors at night.

265
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:15,318
I'm not a visitor, Your Grace.
Word has it I'm to be your bride.

266
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,451
Did you know that people
in arranged marriages

267
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,954
often never meet until their wedding day?

268
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,668
Before we decide
to spend our lives together,

269
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,089
we ought to get to know one another.
Don't you think?

270
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,009
Yes.

271
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,721
-But if my mother found out--
-It can be our secret.

272
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:52,063
If we're going to be man and wife,
we'll have a few secrets from her, I hope.

273
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,192
So, Your Grace…

274
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,195
Yes?

275
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,282
Tell me a secret.

276
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,543
-Hello. Aren't you a proper fellow?
-That's Ser Pounce.

277
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,297
Very handsome.

278
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:23,428
Joffrey didn't like him.
He threatened to skin him alive

279
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:26,723
and mix his innards up in my food
so I wouldn't know I was eating him.

280
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,224
That's very cruel.

281
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,187
You don't strike me as cruel.

282
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,356
No.

283
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,776
-I don't think I am.
-That's a relief.

284
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,030
Because you know
what happens when we marry?

285
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,741
We say our vows
in front of the High Septon.

286
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:49,579
-And after the ceremony, there's a feast--
-When we marry, I become yours. Forever.

287
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,209
It's getting late.

288
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,670
I should go.

289
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,673
May I come and visit you again?

290
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:05,637
All right, then.

291
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:15,563
Remember, our little secret.

292
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,435
"Ser Jaime Lannister."

293
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:58,481
"Knighted and named
to the Kingsguard in his 16th year."

294
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:03,403
"At the sack of King's Landing,
murdered his king, Aerys II."

295
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,114
"Pardoned by Robert Baratheon."

296
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,076
"Thereafter known as the Kingslayer."

297
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,954
It's the duty of the Lord Commander
to fill those pages.

298
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,585
And there's still room left on mine.

299
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,034
Valyrian steel.

300
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:57,373
-It's yours.
-I can't accept this.

301
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,334
It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword.

302
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,587
You'll use it to defend
Ned Stark's daughter.

303
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:08,343
You swore an oath to return
the Stark girls to their mother.

304
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:12,555
Lady Stark's dead.
Arya's probably dead, too,

305
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,767
but there's still a chance to find Sansa
and get her somewhere safe.

306
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,978
I've got something else for you.

307
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,499
I hope I got your measurements right.

308
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,253
I'll find her.

309
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:47,757
For Lady Catelyn.

310
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:53,805
And for you.

311
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,146
I almost forgot.

312
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,483
I have one more gift.

313
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,324
-I don't need a squire.
-Of course you do.

314
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,661
-He'll slow me down.
-My brother owes him a debt.

315
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,204
He's not safe here.

316
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,456
You’ll be keeping him from harm.
It's chivalry.

317
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,791
I won't slow you down, ser.

318
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:32,677
-My lady. I promise I'll serve you well.
-See? He's a good lad. You'll get along.

319
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,016
Compliments of Lord Tyrion.

320
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,019
His ax from the Blackwater.

321
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,152
What are you waiting for, a kiss?

322
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,864
Ready the lady's horse.

323
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:06,294
They say the best swords have names.
Any ideas?

324
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:13,968
Oathkeeper.

325
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,607
Goodbye, Brienne.

326
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:52,799
Come on, move.

327
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:54,759
Please?

328
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,951
I should never have taken her away.

329
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:23,746
-She wasn't safe here.
-She's not safe out there.

330
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,583
I should have known. You told us
there were wildlings south of the Wall.

331
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,461
If they're raiding the smaller villages,
Mole's Town could be next.

332
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:33,506
-Well, Castle Black could be next.
-I should go back for Gilly.

333
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,299
We have orders.
No one's to leave the castle.

334
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,094
I remember when you disobeyed orders
and rode south to help Robb.

335
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,304
And I remember who came
after me and brought me home.

336
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,518
I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me.

337
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,565
When you told me about Bran
going beyond the Wall,

338
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,525
all I could think about
was getting my strength back

339
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:53,901
so I could go and find him.

340
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,780
I wish I could have convinced him
to come back with me.

341
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,826
I tried. Really, I did.

342
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,455
How fast could they travel?

343
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:10,543
A crippled boy being pulled
on a sledge by a simpleton?

344
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,669
I don't know.

345
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,046
They'd pass wildling villages.

346
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,091
They could try
to find shelter at one of them.

347
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:21,137
The wildlings have joined up with Mance.

348
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,640
Every village or sheltered place
will be deserted.

349
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,645
Except…

350
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:34,775
Craster's?

351
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,113
-You think Bran might have found--
-Snow.

352
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,160
I don't mean to interrupt.
Thorne wants to see you.

353
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,082
Your foray to Craster's Keep…

354
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,210
I'll sanction it.

355
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:58,799
But I won't order anyone to go with you.
Volunteers only.

356
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,552
Thank you, Ser Alliser.

357
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,398
Brothers.

358
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,579
I'm going beyond the Wall
to Craster's Keep.

359
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,125
I'm going to capture the mutineers
holed up there or kill them.

360
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:36,253
I'm asking for volunteers to come with me.

361
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,257
There's 60 miles of wilderness
between here and Craster's

362
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,135
and Mance Rayder has an army
bearing down on us,

363
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:45,554
but we have to do this.

364
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:50,309
Our survival may depend on us
getting to these mutineers

365
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,435
before Mance does.

366
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,105
They know the Wall.
They know our defenses.

367
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,984
If Mance learns what they know,
we're lost.

368
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,405
But if that's not enough,

369
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:04,740
then consider this.

370
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,827
If the Night's Watch are truly brothers,

371
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,955
then Lord Commander Mormont
was our father.

372
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,961
He lived and died for the Watch,
and he was betrayed by his own men.

373
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:20,297
Stabbed in the back by cowards.
He deserved far better.

374
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,759
All we can give him now is justice.

375
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,887
Who will join me?

376
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,732
I can't let a recruit
come north of the Wall.

377
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,400
Then let me say my vows.

378
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,820
If it's a fight you're heading for,
then you need men who know how.

379
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,543
Thank you, brothers.

380
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,178
No, don't.

381
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:55,518
Don't, please. Please don't.
Ow! You're hurting me.

382
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:05,694
Karl Tanner from Gin Alley

383
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:12,493
drinking wine from the skull
of Jeor fucking Mormont.

384
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,711
Any command for us, Lord Commander?

385
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:24,672
What's that?

386
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,008
Fuck 'em till they're dead?

387
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,719
-No!
-Did you hear that, boys?

388
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,098
Fuck 'em till they're dead.

389
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,439
Rast.

390
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:51,740
-Go outside and feed the beast.
-We should kill that thing.

391
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:58,539
You should shut your fucking hole,
ugly little cunt.

392
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:05,462
You look like a fucking ballsack.
Ugly. Look at your stupid cunt face.

393
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:09,175
I could piss in any gutter
and soak five of you.

394
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:13,846
Know how much they paid me
to kill a man in King's Landing?

395
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,640
Seven silvers.

396
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:21,228
They told me a man's name
and that man never saw daylight again.

397
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,647
None of them cocksuckers got away from me.

398
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,196
Haven't lost a fight since I was nine.

399
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,574
Maybe it's time.

400
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:39,288
What do you think, eh?
Maybe you're the man.

401
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,125
Eh, cunt?

402
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,379
I wouldn't stand a chance.

403
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:53,260
-None of us would.
-I was a fucking legend in Gin Alley.

404
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,305
A fucking legend!

405
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,767
I would take any knight--
any knight, any time.

406
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:04,396
Fucking cunts in steel plate.
Fucking cowards.

407
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:16,242
-A gift for the gods.
-A gift for the gods.

408
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,327
A gift for the gods.

409
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:23,040
-What the fuck is that?
-Craster's last child. A boy.

410
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,708
What am I supposed to do with him?

411
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,670
What did Craster do with 'em?

412
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:30,422
Kill 'em before they could grow up
and do the same to him?

413
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,133
All right.

414
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,973
Don't need another mouth to feed.

415
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,517
-Hand him over.
-He didn't kill them.

416
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,478
-He offered them.
-To who?

417
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:45,813
To the gods.

418
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:48,816
The White Walkers.

419
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,527
-A gift for the gods.
-A gift for the gods.

420
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,113
-A gift for the gods.
-A gift for the gods.

421
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:57,032
-A gift for the gods.
-A gift for the gods.

422
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,492
Shut up!

423
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:05,916
So…

424
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:10,546
if it worked for him…

425
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,634
Let's give the Walkers what they want.

426
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,060
Rast is headed that way.

427
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,274
Pink-eyed fuck.

428
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,738
You thirsty?

429
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,301
Fuck!

430
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,045
Hodor.

431
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,012
Do you hear that?

432
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:15,105
-Is that a baby?
-It's coming.

433
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:17,941
I'm going out there.

434
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,527
-No, we need to stay together.
-I'm going.

435
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:06,114
-Bran. Bran.
-Hodor. Hodor.

436
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,784
-Bran, what happened?
-Summer, he's hurt.

437
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,827
-They've caught him in a trap.
-Who?

438
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,997
I didn't see,
but they have my brother's wolf.

439
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:17,334
They have Ghost.

440
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:26,176
They're Night's Watch. Look.

441
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:28,971
Jon might be here.

442
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,015
If Jon was here,
why would they put his wolf in a cage?

443
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:41,650
They might have been Night's Watch once,
not anymore.

444
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,319
-We're not safe here. We need to go.
-No.

445
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:49,283
-Bran, we need to go now.
-I'm not leaving without Summer.

446
00:47:56,623 --> 00:48:00,168
-Can you remember where the cage was?
-The east side of the keep.

447
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,172
If I'm not back soon, we'll meet--

448
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:06,800
Hodor.

449
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,107
Hodor.

450
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,945
Hodor. Hodor.

451
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,159
Hodor.

452
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:36,913
If I was your size,
I'd be king of the fucking world.

453
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:49,926
Help him up.

454
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,077
This is nice.

455
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:17,871
Fine leather.

456
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:24,586
You're no wildling. Important. Highborn.

457
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,256
Who are you?

458
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:40,310
You see, where I come from,

459
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:43,063
a commoner like me
slaps a little lord like you,

460
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,148
I'd lose my right hand.

461
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:48,860
But we're a long way
from home, aren't we?

462
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:56,493
And the two of you,
fancy-looking folks north of the Wall

463
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,120
creeping through the woods.

464
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,373
Isn't that a bit odd?

465
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:07,337
I like your curly hair.

466
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,883
My mom had curls like that.

467
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,721
Beautiful brown curls.

468
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:21,601
Why'd you drag a crippled boy
all the way up here, huh?

469
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,899
See, you haven't played this game before.

470
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:31,153
A highborn hostage,

471
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:33,864
that's valuable.

472
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,658
But three of them,

473
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:40,162
that's a lot of mouths to feed.

474
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,331
-What the fuck's wrong with him?
-Come here.

475
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:47,377
No, please. Please, let me help him.

476
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,171
-Who are you?
-Please.

477
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:52,132
-Who are you?
-I'm Brandon Stark!

478
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,718
I'm Brandon Stark of Winterfell.

479
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,097
It's Jon Snow's brother.

480
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,227
It's Meera. It's Meera. I'm right here.

481
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:08,482
And I thought this was gonna be
another boring day.

482
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:15,447
I'm right here.
