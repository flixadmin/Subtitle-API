1
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,749
Why?

2
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,036
Why is this still under discussion?

3
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,028
I don't like him.

4
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,589
I don't care who he knows.

5
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,154
We're supposed to trust
him with our products.

6
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,955
Big man.

7
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,713
Big Generalissimo!

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,713
Big fry cook is more like it.

9
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,310
The "Chicken Man."

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,473
You will do what you want.

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,712
But you have my vote.

12
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,439
Never trust a South American.

13
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,992
Dirty, dirty people.

14
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,877
He broke my toy! He broke my toy!

15
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,032
He was just having fun.

16
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,075
You'll get over it.

17
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,073
No! I hate him! I wish he was dead!

18
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,789
Grab your old uncle a beer,
would you?

19
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,515
No, no. A cold one.

20
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,753
This is what you wanted.

21
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,510
Your brother dead. Right?

22
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,559
You're going to have to
try harder than that...

23
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,197
...if you want to save him.

24
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,275
How much longer do you think
he has down there?

25
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,475
One minute? Maybe more? Maybe less?

26
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,718
Family is all.

27
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,794
Finish him.

28
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,118
Too easy.
