1
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:25,750
<i>Beloved countrymen,</i>

2
00:00:25,917 --> 00:00:29,378
the New Liberalism party
is the only force in Colombia

3
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,923
that is not afraid of narcotraffickers.

4
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,426
"There are
three ways the narcotraffickers...

5
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:39,639
- try to weaken extradition."
- try to weaken extradition.

6
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:41,099
- "Bribery..."
- Bribery...

7
00:00:41,182 --> 00:00:42,976
"intimidation through violence..."

8
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:45,061
intimidation through violence...

9
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,230
- "...and extortion."
- and extortion!

10
00:00:48,522 --> 00:00:52,568
- "A dark and terrible scourge."
- A dark and terrible scourge.

11
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,695
What are you doing?

12
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:57,073
Just making sure he gets it right.

13
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:01,995
You wrote it, you should know.

14
00:01:05,039 --> 00:01:07,834
- Mm.
- Look, I brought you this.

15
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:09,336
What's this?

16
00:01:09,418 --> 00:01:14,132
Clean socks.
Your wife dropped them off before we left.

17
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:17,635
How's Galán doing?

18
00:01:18,886 --> 00:01:21,097
All right.

19
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:24,684
I wish he didn't focus so much
on extradition of narcos.

20
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:27,561
There are other things to mention.

21
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,315
Galán's got some balls.

22
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:34,986
Brave men have a way of dying quickly.

23
00:01:35,153 --> 00:01:40,950
Well, then, you don't have to worry...
do you?

24
00:01:43,953 --> 00:01:45,330
Aah...

25
00:01:46,247 --> 00:01:47,540
Pass me the socks.

26
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,094
First thing
is that we get you out of Bogotá.

27
00:03:23,177 --> 00:03:25,596
- OK.
- There's an orphanage in Cumaral.

28
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:28,766
It's out of the guerrilla zone
and away from the narcos.

29
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:30,184
And then what?

30
00:03:31,352 --> 00:03:32,686
We get you a passport.

31
00:03:34,563 --> 00:03:37,525
From another country, we can depose you
about Escobar and the siege.

32
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:42,322
You may have run away from your country,
but I'm not running away from mine.

33
00:03:55,543 --> 00:03:57,586
This is about keeping you alive.

34
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:02,383
Do you sleep with all your informants?

35
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:07,305
I'm not your responsibility.

36
00:04:11,892 --> 00:04:15,855
If Pablo Escobar finds you...
he'll kill you in a heartbeat.

37
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,860
Not if I kill him first.

38
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,782
Yeah, she's a live hand grenade.

39
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,910
She's the only witness we got that
can tie Escobar to the palace massacre.

40
00:04:29,994 --> 00:04:32,413
Hard to bring her in when
she gets turned over to the Colombians

41
00:04:32,497 --> 00:04:34,915
and she gets disappeared.
Are you ready for that?

42
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:36,209
No.

43
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:38,085
So what's our options,
since we have none?

44
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:40,046
Well, we keep her in hiding
until things cool down,

45
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:42,048
and get her immunity
in exchange for her testimony...

46
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:44,425
Are you gonna get us immunity?

47
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:47,011
We are going to jail
if we get caught with this woman.

48
00:04:47,094 --> 00:04:49,974
Well, the next time your wife decides
to bring home a human hand grenade,

49
00:04:50,014 --> 00:04:51,807
how about she hands it to you?

50
00:04:54,352 --> 00:04:56,312
Are you fucking her?

51
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,148
Sleep with a communist?

52
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:02,193
That would be downright un-American.

53
00:05:06,531 --> 00:05:08,782
Any intel to support the DEA theory

54
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:11,911
that Escobar is behind
the Palace of Justice siege?

55
00:05:11,994 --> 00:05:13,454
No, ma'am.

56
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:16,499
Agent Peña claims to have an informant
that can testify to that effect,

57
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:18,334
but he hasn't brought him forward.

58
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,711
In my book,
there's only two of them that know that.

59
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,174
And one of them is Elisa Alvaro,
girlfriend of Alejandro Ayala.

60
00:05:25,383 --> 00:05:28,428
The other one is Ernesto Sobrino,

61
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:33,724
a radical priest who gave shelter
to M-19 fugitives in Los Altos <i>comuna.</i>

62
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:36,060
Is one of these people your informant?

63
00:05:36,227 --> 00:05:40,356
Ambassador, this is...
unofficial wiretap information.

64
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,734
We, uh, intercepted
a discussion between narcos.

65
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:46,404
What? Which narcos?

66
00:05:47,488 --> 00:05:50,074
- Sounded like Pablo Escobar.
- We're almost certain.

67
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:52,535
It was, uh...
It was hard to tell.

68
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,995
The... connection was bad.
They were calling from Panama.

69
00:05:55,162 --> 00:05:56,914
- Panama?
- They know Galán's gonna win

70
00:05:56,997 --> 00:05:58,958
and they know
that he'll support extradition,

71
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:01,877
and they're not gonna sit around
and await being sent back to the US.

72
00:06:02,044 --> 00:06:05,423
Ambassador, word is Manuel Noriega
is providing safe harbor for the narcos,

73
00:06:05,506 --> 00:06:08,217
and possibly shipping points
for their cocaine.

74
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,470
They're moving
their drug operations to Panama?

75
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:13,097
That's horseshit, Peña.
Excuse me, Ambassador.

76
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,017
On one hand, you're saying Escobar's
in bed with left-wing communists.

77
00:06:17,101 --> 00:06:19,312
Now you're saying
he's in bed with Manuel Noriega.

78
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,897
You can't have it both ways, son.

79
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:26,611
Ambassador, Manuel Noriega has helped us
fight communism all over Latin America

80
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:27,861
for the last two decades.

81
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:32,283
I take great offense at any attempt
by the DEA to smear his good name.

82
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:35,662
<i>I couldn't help but laugh.</i>

83
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,746
<i>Right wing, left wing...</i>

84
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,292
<i>For Manuel Noriega,
it was all about the money.</i>

85
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:45,921
<i>When Bush was head of the CIA,
Noriega pretended to be a commie hater</i>

86
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:50,926
<i>so the US would ignore the fact that he
was heavily involved as a drug trafficker.</i>

87
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,763
<i>When Noriega realized he could
make even more money shipping his drugs</i>

88
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,309
<i>by siding with communists,
he switched teams.</i>

89
00:06:58,392 --> 00:07:02,480
<i>So, we invaded Panama,
and arrested "Old Pineapple Face."</i>

90
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:05,149
<i>But, that was later.</i>

91
00:07:05,232 --> 00:07:09,320
<i>For now, the trusted friend and ally
was a right-wing CIA asset</i>

92
00:07:09,403 --> 00:07:12,740
<i>who was taking money from Bush...
and right from the narcos.</i>

93
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:22,458
<i>Pablo had knocked off half the Colombian
Supreme Court to fight extradition.</i>

94
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:25,378
<i>And now, he was offering
to pay off Colombia's national debt</i>

95
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:26,671
<i>in exchange for a truce.</i>

96
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,632
<i>Guess he missed home.</i>

97
00:07:46,482 --> 00:07:50,152
Look at this
shit. We are spending millions of dollars,

98
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:54,532
and can't even get a decent meal anywhere.

99
00:07:54,615 --> 00:08:00,162
Listen, the problem isn't the food,
the problem is Noriega.

100
00:08:00,287 --> 00:08:03,708
First chance he gets,
he'll sell us to the Americans.

101
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,125
You guys stay calm.

102
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:08,289
Once we reach an agreement with the
government, we'll be back in our homeland.

103
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:13,050
Pay the Colombian
national debt for amnesty?

104
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,095
I'd rather go live in Spain.

105
00:08:16,178 --> 00:08:20,641
I say we go back and fight.

106
00:08:20,725 --> 00:08:23,894
No, sir, none of that.
War is bad for business.

107
00:08:23,977 --> 00:08:26,272
We will negotiate with them
as Pablo agreed.

108
00:08:31,026 --> 00:08:35,030
Look, Gustavo,
none of this would've happened

109
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,157
if he hadn't started
killing politicians and judges.

110
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:39,577
Tell me what we are supposed to do, then.

111
00:08:39,744 --> 00:08:42,830
Do you want to sit here
and cry over spilled milk?

112
00:08:43,497 --> 00:08:44,624
You know something, Pablo?

113
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:50,963
Sometimes, I think you kill these men
because they won't let you in their club.

114
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:53,882
You better watch your mouth, asshole.

115
00:09:12,025 --> 00:09:16,280
The Colombian government
has refused our amnesty offer.

116
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:20,618
Get used to the food, gentlemen.

117
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:24,580
It's not safe to go back home.

118
00:09:48,103 --> 00:09:50,606
They've rejected our amnesty deal.

119
00:09:53,942 --> 00:09:55,820
We may have to stay.

120
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,034
I hate this place.

121
00:10:05,162 --> 00:10:07,331
We can go someplace else.

122
00:10:07,414 --> 00:10:10,835
I hear Switzerland is very beautiful.

123
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:13,253
In Switzerland,
we are nobody, Pablo.

124
00:10:14,338 --> 00:10:17,758
What good is having all the money
in the world if you can't go home?

125
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:29,812
If we go back...
I'm going to have to fight.

126
00:10:37,945 --> 00:10:40,531
Do whatever is necessary,
my love.

127
00:10:52,376 --> 00:10:54,336
<i>So, there it was.</i>

128
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,715
<i>The decision that would
change Colombia forever.</i>

129
00:11:02,845 --> 00:11:05,055
You're way ahead in the polls.

130
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:09,226
In my opinion,
the outcome is decided.

131
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:12,563
My question is... why do you
keep getting involved with the narcos?

132
00:11:13,814 --> 00:11:15,691
I want a country at peace.

133
00:11:16,734 --> 00:11:18,485
And if I don't do it, who will?

134
00:11:19,361 --> 00:11:20,988
You're backing them into a corner.

135
00:11:22,364 --> 00:11:24,283
I'm wearing a vest.

136
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,411
I'm afraid that a bulletproof vest...

137
00:11:27,494 --> 00:11:30,915
isn't enough to ensure
that you have a future.

138
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:36,629
Don't worry, my friend.
There will be a future.

139
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:53,562
<i>Luis Carlos Galán
took the stage in Soacha on August 18th,</i>

140
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:57,399
<i>against the advice
of his campaign manager, César Gaviria.</i>

141
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:09,369
<i>The bullets entered just below
his vest and he was dead within minutes.</i>

142
00:12:09,453 --> 00:12:12,456
<i>For a brief shining moment,
there was hope...</i>

143
00:12:13,415 --> 00:12:16,043
<i>extinguished by the pull
of an assassin's trigger.</i>

144
00:12:18,045 --> 00:12:23,509
<i>To mourn Galán's death, every hut in the
countryside lit a candle in remembrance...</i>

145
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,639
<i>and in the cities, thousands took
to the streets in a march of the silent,</i>

146
00:12:28,806 --> 00:12:32,225
<i>a mute protest
against the violence of the narcos.</i>

147
00:12:33,894 --> 00:12:38,357
<i>With Galán's murder... came the end
of hope for a peaceful future.</i>

148
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:45,031
Let's speak clearly, brother.

149
00:12:48,283 --> 00:12:49,952
Galán's dead.

150
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:52,663
You had him killed, didn't you?

151
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,042
You didn't tell us shit,
and you killed him, you son of a bitch.

152
00:12:56,124 --> 00:12:58,836
- I want to go home, Fabio.
- Home?

153
00:12:59,003 --> 00:13:01,463
Why are we going home?
So they can capture us?

154
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:07,720
All this shit you talk about partnership,
and then you do this on your own? Huh?

155
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:16,520
Galán was the only threat.

156
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,315
There is no one left to challenge us.

157
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,859
And you know why, Fabio.

158
00:13:22,818 --> 00:13:25,863
Because no one
has the balls that we have.

159
00:13:28,532 --> 00:13:30,784
Going home.

160
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,540
<i>Pablo was right.</i>

161
00:13:36,623 --> 00:13:39,292
<i>Who would have the balls
to fill Galán's shoes?</i>

162
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:44,798
That unique honesty.

163
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:47,968
As the people now rise
and call for justice,

164
00:13:48,176 --> 00:13:52,056
I pray to God
that this sacrifice will serve at last...

165
00:13:53,473 --> 00:13:58,020
as motivation for society
to react and bond...

166
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:03,442
to support the government...
and institutions...

167
00:14:03,525 --> 00:14:08,196
while also demanding
a more effective leadership,

168
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,284
one undeterred by the hitmen,
the hijackings,

169
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:15,913
or any other manifestations of violence.

170
00:14:15,996 --> 00:14:19,083
My father, Luis Carlos Galán,

171
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,418
will be remembered
for awakening the Colombian people

172
00:14:21,501 --> 00:14:24,630
to the danger of the narcos.

173
00:14:26,548 --> 00:14:30,844
The assassin's bullets...
will not stop what my father began.

174
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:35,933
As he fell,
another rises in his place.

175
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:39,895
I want to tell Dr. César Gaviria...

176
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:43,983
in the name of the people of Colombia,
and my family...

177
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:49,696
that we entrust my father's ideals to him,
and that he can count on our support...

178
00:14:49,905 --> 00:14:53,951
to become the president
Colombia wants and needs.

179
00:14:56,912 --> 00:15:00,457
Dr. César Gaviria, save Colombia!

180
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:05,879
Gaviria! Gaviria! Gaviria!

181
00:15:12,136 --> 00:15:17,099
<i>Dr. César Gaviria...
the new hope of Colombia.</i>

182
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:21,187
<i>If he took Galán's position on
extradition, the narcos would declare war.</i>

183
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:25,065
<i>If he didn't,
the country would become a narco state.</i>

184
00:15:34,074 --> 00:15:35,450
Phone!

185
00:15:37,327 --> 00:15:39,746
Let it go to the answering machine.

186
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:47,838
The machine's full.

187
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:50,090
I wish it would stop ringing.

188
00:15:50,174 --> 00:15:53,635
It's your friends.
They're calling to offer support.

189
00:15:55,345 --> 00:15:58,724
Or opinions about what I should do.

190
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,145
Why can't you run
without backing extradition?

191
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:11,278
- I wrote those speeches.
- Yes...

192
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:14,031
but do you even believe in them?

193
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:19,619
I don't know what I believe.

194
00:16:21,288 --> 00:16:24,041
I don't want the narcos having free reign.

195
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:29,255
But I don't want the United States
involved in our affairs.

196
00:16:30,297 --> 00:16:32,049
So say nothing.

197
00:16:33,884 --> 00:16:36,178
That's the best way to stay alive.

198
00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:53,695
Gentlemen.

199
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:58,117
Fernando, cheer up. Have a drink.

200
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,077
We're going home!

201
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:07,417
- How are you? Hm?
- Fine, my love.

202
00:17:09,336 --> 00:17:10,921
What about you?

203
00:17:11,004 --> 00:17:12,047
Give me one.

204
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,550
Margarita, right?

205
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:17,594
Let's see.

206
00:17:19,763 --> 00:17:21,765
- Son of a bitch, that's good.
- Right?

207
00:17:21,848 --> 00:17:25,644
Thank you.
Listen, I've got a question for you.

208
00:17:25,727 --> 00:17:27,938
Why are we going back?

209
00:17:28,855 --> 00:17:31,317
We're walking into a world of shit.

210
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:34,527
Relax, brother.

211
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:39,116
Spain's too far away
to protect our interests.

212
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:42,702
We have a better chance
of influencing Pablo at home.

213
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:48,083
We need to be close by.
Relax.

214
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:50,294
Don't you get it?

215
00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:55,548
He's only comfortable at war.

216
00:17:55,757 --> 00:17:58,051
He's taking us to the slaughter.

217
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:27,747
How's business?

218
00:18:27,831 --> 00:18:33,379
Fucking Noriega is charging us a fortune,
but we got 175 tons to Miami.

219
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:37,757
Gacha's Mexican routes
are opening up Los Angeles.

220
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:42,388
But do you know what matters most
for our business, Pablo?

221
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:47,309
That the situation at home stays calm.
Know what I mean?

222
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:48,643
Sure.

223
00:19:03,491 --> 00:19:06,203
You should have
consulted with me about Galán.

224
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:10,416
You would have tried to talk me out of it.

225
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:11,875
Yes.

226
00:19:14,211 --> 00:19:15,545
I would have tried.

227
00:19:18,131 --> 00:19:21,260
The amount of money we are losing
is because of that bullshit.

228
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,265
Are you listening?

229
00:19:27,474 --> 00:19:29,517
Look at those peaks, Gustavo.

230
00:19:35,482 --> 00:19:39,486
I'll die...
before I ever leave Colombia again.

231
00:19:47,035 --> 00:19:48,620
What's happening, Carrillo?

232
00:19:48,703 --> 00:19:49,996
Thank you for coming.

233
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,748
I understand the narcos
are back from Panama.

234
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:53,625
So you practice your English with me?

235
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,211
Because these men
aren't cleared, and if we speak Spanish,

236
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:57,712
it could get back to Pablo.

237
00:19:59,547 --> 00:20:02,509
So I started this to monitor
Pablo's <i>sicarios' </i>communications.

238
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:05,178
SAT phones, landlines, you name it.

239
00:20:05,262 --> 00:20:06,596
I've got dozens of wiretaps,

240
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:09,641
but I've only managed to seize
about ten kilos in the last month.

241
00:20:09,724 --> 00:20:12,852
Probably because I've listened
to my own men tipping the narcos off.

242
00:20:12,936 --> 00:20:14,456
So I've had to start surveilling them.

243
00:20:15,272 --> 00:20:17,899
I listen to them
tell their girlfriends they're afraid...

244
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,568
cry to their mothers
when one of our men gets shot down.

245
00:20:21,903 --> 00:20:24,990
But every once in a while...
I hear them trade secrets with Pablo.

246
00:20:26,283 --> 00:20:28,368
Do your bosses know you're doing this?

247
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,662
I trust them even less.

248
00:20:31,538 --> 00:20:33,290
Most of my men are from here,

249
00:20:33,373 --> 00:20:36,668
where they can get to your mother,
your aunt, your cousin.

250
00:20:37,461 --> 00:20:42,132
How do I fight... when my soldiers
are already working for Escobar?

251
00:20:43,716 --> 00:20:45,677
Well, do they have to be from Medellín?

252
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:55,061
Yes.

253
00:20:55,145 --> 00:20:57,230
I definitely like the red one best.

254
00:20:58,064 --> 00:21:00,484
- Really?
- Mm.

255
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:01,985
I prefer the gray.

256
00:21:02,944 --> 00:21:05,738
Red is the color of the party,

257
00:21:05,822 --> 00:21:09,617
and it makes you more...
sociable and close to the people.

258
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:12,787
- That's important.
- Mm.

259
00:21:14,664 --> 00:21:17,125
I wonder what Luis Carlos
would have chosen?

260
00:21:18,835 --> 00:21:22,047
You know, we should
also hire an image consultant.

261
00:21:22,964 --> 00:21:28,845
We have to make you more appealing
to the youth, give you a more modern look.

262
00:21:29,012 --> 00:21:30,930
Now you are going to give me image advice?

263
00:21:31,014 --> 00:21:32,849
I'm just thinking about the polls.

264
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,852
Anyway...

265
00:21:37,812 --> 00:21:42,692
Galán had professionals at his side,
but which could he trust?

266
00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:44,570
Hm?

267
00:21:44,652 --> 00:21:48,031
And you know perfectly well
that you can trust me, right?

268
00:21:48,114 --> 00:21:49,575
Mm-hm.

269
00:21:51,493 --> 00:21:54,371
Well, what are you going to choose,
red or gray?

270
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,924
Luis Carlos said something to me
before he died.

271
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,302
"There will be a future."

272
00:22:12,805 --> 00:22:15,016
Now let's see what kind of future it is.

273
00:22:21,648 --> 00:22:23,691
We worked together in the ministry.

274
00:22:23,858 --> 00:22:26,194
The idea that
he's a presidential candidate

275
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,572
shows you our sad state of affairs.

276
00:22:29,989 --> 00:22:32,158
I need to know which side he is on.

277
00:22:33,368 --> 00:22:36,288
He speaks with
the Foreign Press next week.

278
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:38,331
They'll certainly ask his position.

279
00:22:38,415 --> 00:22:41,126
Don't worry, Pablo.
He'll be easy to influence.

280
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:42,628
- No, I disagree.
- Why?

281
00:22:42,835 --> 00:22:46,506
I did an interview with him once,
when he was an economic advisor.

282
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:50,093
I found him sitting in the parking lot
in his beat-up Renault,

283
00:22:50,176 --> 00:22:55,641
eating a bag of apples...
and reading economic reform textbooks.

284
00:22:55,848 --> 00:22:58,518
He was testifying to the cabinet
and wanted to be ready.

285
00:22:58,602 --> 00:23:01,938
He's a bookworm, not a leader.

286
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:04,316
- No... No...
- No, no, no, you're missing my point.

287
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:06,359
- No.
- He's not an oligarch.

288
00:23:07,569 --> 00:23:09,446
He's from modest circumstances.

289
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:11,448
Like you,
he's worked for everything he has.

290
00:23:12,616 --> 00:23:14,909
You have to be careful
with people like that.

291
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,338
I want you to deliver a message.

292
00:23:27,714 --> 00:23:29,799
We've made a lot of money.

293
00:23:29,882 --> 00:23:35,347
What we have to decide is do we stick
with Pablo... or chart our own course?

294
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,644
We should talk to our friends down south.

295
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:45,315
No, no. It's not time. No. Mm?

296
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:48,193
Whatever you say.

297
00:23:48,276 --> 00:23:49,861
Have you seen Marina?

298
00:23:49,944 --> 00:23:51,530
She told me she was
going to buy a new brush.

299
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:54,366
You know your sister.

300
00:23:54,449 --> 00:23:58,745
Her shopping expeditions take weeks.

301
00:24:05,168 --> 00:24:07,504
You have no idea how much
I wanted to go down on you in Panama.

302
00:24:07,587 --> 00:24:08,921
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

303
00:24:09,005 --> 00:24:12,425
I could tell that you really wanted to.

304
00:24:12,509 --> 00:24:15,011
- Come here, baby.
- You are very patient.

305
00:24:15,094 --> 00:24:16,388
Yes, of course.

306
00:24:17,347 --> 00:24:20,350
All your people were there,
your brothers...

307
00:24:28,816 --> 00:24:31,570
My brothers are driving me crazy.

308
00:24:34,531 --> 00:24:35,657
- You know what?
- What?

309
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:38,201
They can go fuck themselves.

310
00:24:38,326 --> 00:24:40,620
If they want to,
they can go live in Spain...

311
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:43,540
but you're staying here with me.

312
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,758
Let's not hide anymore.

313
00:24:53,383 --> 00:24:55,802
Not anymore.

314
00:24:56,844 --> 00:24:58,096
All right.

315
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,642
What do we do about my wife?

316
00:25:06,062 --> 00:25:07,855
Ask Pablo to do us a favor.

317
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:12,527
Just like he took care of Galán,
he can take care of your wife.

318
00:25:20,827 --> 00:25:22,287
You...

319
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,832
are very evil for such a young girl.

320
00:25:30,712 --> 00:25:33,256
You've moved up, Fernando.

321
00:25:34,882 --> 00:25:40,305
From government minister
to Pablo Escobar's errand boy.

322
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:44,434
I guess the pay is much better.

323
00:25:45,226 --> 00:25:47,103
I'm not doing this for the money.

324
00:25:48,062 --> 00:25:52,734
What country sends its own citizens
to an iron tomb in the United States?

325
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,320
I understand your dilemma.

326
00:25:55,403 --> 00:26:01,284
Speak out in favor, you're seen as a US
puppet and you might not win the election.

327
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:05,789
Speak out against,
you anger the US...

328
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:09,835
and are criticized by our media
as a shill of the narcos.

329
00:26:09,917 --> 00:26:13,421
César, I was thinking I would love
to dedicate a program for your campaign.

330
00:26:13,588 --> 00:26:17,342
It would be an honor for me,
and would benefit us both.

331
00:26:19,385 --> 00:26:20,804
What a great idea.

332
00:26:21,638 --> 00:26:24,307
You guys are really shameless,
aren't you?

333
00:26:25,475 --> 00:26:29,270
- How do you sleep at night?
- César, it doesn't have to be this way.

334
00:26:29,437 --> 00:26:33,191
If Luis had been as smart as you,

335
00:26:33,274 --> 00:26:35,401
perhaps we could have avoided
this horrible tragedy.

336
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:39,322
We could have had peace.

337
00:26:39,489 --> 00:26:40,740
Easy.

338
00:26:45,745 --> 00:26:46,913
Get out.

339
00:26:48,164 --> 00:26:49,957
Read Pablo's letter.

340
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:53,169
Maybe you will have a future.

341
00:27:05,473 --> 00:27:08,852
They just picked up
that commie priest, Father Sobrino.

342
00:27:08,935 --> 00:27:12,814
He's gonna talk. And when he does,
I hope you DEA boys understand

343
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:14,566
what's important in this hemisphere.

344
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:18,069
Well, how about you, uh...
clue us in?

345
00:27:18,152 --> 00:27:21,656
Drug dealers, I mean, bad as they are,
they want your money.

346
00:27:22,448 --> 00:27:23,783
Communists want everything.

347
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:29,288
I don't know about you, Peña, but I...
I like to own shit.

348
00:27:29,497 --> 00:27:30,749
Right.

349
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:33,418
Good talk, Lou.

350
00:27:33,501 --> 00:27:36,504
- Very, uh... enlightening.
- Yeah.

351
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:38,673
Oh...

352
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,678
This... priest?

353
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:48,015
If it comes out that he was your informant
and you protected him...

354
00:27:49,141 --> 00:27:50,901
I'm gonna make sure
you're tried for treason.

355
00:27:57,149 --> 00:28:00,486
<i>Peña had to figure out
how to get fake papers for Elisa.</i>

356
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:03,364
<i>So he did what he does best.</i>

357
00:28:03,573 --> 00:28:06,534
Let me guess: it's a very
sad and complicated situation

358
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,160
involving you and a beautiful local.

359
00:28:08,244 --> 00:28:11,998
You got your nails done.
It's... It's your color, Colleen.

360
00:28:13,249 --> 00:28:14,793
- What do you want, Javier?
- It's simple.

361
00:28:14,876 --> 00:28:17,336
I just need your signature...
right there.

362
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,840
You want me to create an embassy ID?

363
00:28:20,924 --> 00:28:22,717
- Who is this woman?
- What I want you to do

364
00:28:22,884 --> 00:28:25,762
is sidestep a little bullshit bureaucracy
and help someone stay alive.

365
00:28:27,263 --> 00:28:30,057
You really think I'd be asking you
if it wasn't important?

366
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:31,851
She's my informant.

367
00:28:31,935 --> 00:28:34,353
And she could be the key to bringing down
the whole Medellín cartel,

368
00:28:34,437 --> 00:28:36,564
so come on, Colleen,
whose side are you on?

369
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,874
Cousin, what happened?

370
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:57,251
Where were you?

371
00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:00,046
- In the office.
- In the office?

372
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:01,255
Yes.

373
00:29:02,089 --> 00:29:03,883
Is that where you were?

374
00:29:07,136 --> 00:29:08,638
That's weird...

375
00:29:09,597 --> 00:29:12,934
because I called
and they said you hadn't been in all day.

376
00:29:13,142 --> 00:29:16,896
I don't know which office you called,
but I was there.

377
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,482
They're seizing everything, Pablo.
All the accounts...

378
00:29:19,565 --> 00:29:22,109
We knew there would
be a reaction with Galán, right?

379
00:29:22,318 --> 00:29:24,195
Yeah.

380
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:26,155
Relax, Gustavo.

381
00:29:27,615 --> 00:29:30,409
Relax, because everything
will calm down later.

382
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:43,214
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna kill us both?

383
00:29:43,297 --> 00:29:46,425
- You afraid to die?
- No. Are you?

384
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:57,186
- Put it out.
- Where were you?

385
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:59,105
Put it out, Pablo.

386
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,067
Put it out, Pablo!

387
00:30:11,034 --> 00:30:12,326
Are you with me or what?

388
00:30:15,121 --> 00:30:16,998
And when have I not been with you?

389
00:30:21,044 --> 00:30:24,005
From the beginning,
it has been you and me.

390
00:30:26,883 --> 00:30:29,427
I cannot do this without you.

391
00:30:33,806 --> 00:30:36,225
Are you doubting my loyalty, Pablo?

392
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,438
No.

393
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:47,153
But I'm having serious doubts
about the Ochoas.

394
00:31:10,843 --> 00:31:13,304
<i>Gaviria read Pablo's letter.</i>

395
00:31:16,182 --> 00:31:18,309
<i>The terms were simple.</i>

396
00:31:18,517 --> 00:31:22,271
<i>He promised peace
if the narcos were left alone...</i>

397
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,317
<i>and if not...
he promised all-out war.</i>

398
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:36,786
<i>Carrillo with his wiretaps
knew a storm was on the horizon.</i>

399
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:40,790
<i>Pablo became his duty
and his obsession.</i>

400
00:31:41,415 --> 00:31:43,876
<i>He came to recognize Pablo's voice,</i>

401
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,879
<i>his sleep patterns,
what he liked to eat,</i>

402
00:31:46,963 --> 00:31:50,466
<i>his tastes in art,
his love of silk sheets,</i>

403
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:52,010
<i>and his favorite music.</i>

404
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,482
<i>He would die
for the love of his wife</i>

405
00:32:06,565 --> 00:32:08,085
<i>when you'd hear him over the airwaves.</i>

406
00:32:12,404 --> 00:32:15,700
<i>But did she know
how easily he ordered his men to kill?</i>

407
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:19,495
<i>He came to understand
that Pablo spoke in code.</i>

408
00:32:19,662 --> 00:32:21,039
Time to thin the herd.

409
00:32:21,122 --> 00:32:24,416
<i>"Cattle" were judges
or politicians who supported extradition.</i>

410
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:26,418
But did we score a goal?

411
00:32:26,502 --> 00:32:28,420
The reporter, right.

412
00:32:30,756 --> 00:32:33,051
Let's make sure
we score a goal on him as well.

413
00:32:33,134 --> 00:32:35,261
<i>A "goal" was a targeted assassination.</i>

414
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:37,222
Come on, come on.

415
00:32:37,304 --> 00:32:39,807
<i>If you spoke out against him,
you were dead.</i>

416
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:42,018
<i>- The list grew by the week.</i>
<i>- </i>Ooh!

417
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:46,313
<i>Guillermo Cano, editor of </i>El Espectador,

418
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:48,774
<i>and his reporter, Luis Camacho.</i>

419
00:32:49,483 --> 00:32:54,239
<i>Jaime Rodríguez, the former head
of the anti-drug squad before Carrillo.</i>

420
00:32:54,321 --> 00:32:56,782
<i>The drumbeat went on and on.</i>

421
00:32:56,866 --> 00:32:59,577
<i>For Carrillo,
the war had already started.</i>

422
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,579
<i>But he just couldn't trust his army.</i>

423
00:33:01,662 --> 00:33:05,124
You are aware
that I can end your military career?

424
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:06,959
- I don't give a fuck.
- Excuse me?

425
00:33:07,043 --> 00:33:09,962
Horacio... don't give up.

426
00:33:10,838 --> 00:33:14,508
You've always been the leader
of the persecution of Pablo Escobar.

427
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,719
Is this how you show your appreciation
for all we've done?

428
00:33:16,802 --> 00:33:18,846
This operation
could be a failure before it starts.

429
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,224
I'm not here for fun.

430
00:33:21,307 --> 00:33:22,987
What's gonna happen
is the defense minister

431
00:33:23,017 --> 00:33:26,437
will give you credit for the evidence
that we found at Hacienda Nápoles.

432
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,566
So... then if you resign,
I will look really bad.

433
00:33:30,649 --> 00:33:32,777
Is that what you're doing?
Is that what you want?

434
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,987
Horacio...
you remember when were cadets,

435
00:33:35,071 --> 00:33:39,784
we never thought they would call us
to lead the country's most important unit.

436
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:43,704
Horacio, as your friend...
I'm asking you to think about it.

437
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:46,332
Rodrigo, I don't even know who Pablo pays.

438
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:48,709
It could be any of us three.

439
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,464
- Horacio, please.
- I've put my family at risk.

440
00:33:53,547 --> 00:33:57,093
If there is going to be a war,
I need the right tools.

441
00:33:58,427 --> 00:34:00,054
All right.

442
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,388
Perfect.

443
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,059
Then tell me what you need.
Hm?

444
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,938
Incorruptible men.

445
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:11,857
<i>And that's how the Search Bloc came to be.</i>

446
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,999
<i>But Carrillo
wasn't the only one recruiting soldiers.</i>

447
00:34:34,255 --> 00:34:37,175
Hey, punk.
Are you all right?

448
00:34:37,258 --> 00:34:39,344
- Sure.
- Come here.

449
00:34:40,928 --> 00:34:44,182
<i>La Quica and Poison
had kids deliver packages.</i>

450
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:45,808
<i>And if they didn't look inside,</i>

451
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:49,687
<i>it meant they could be trusted
to deliver anything from cocaine to...</i>

452
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,023
<i>well, anything else.</i>

453
00:35:07,663 --> 00:35:09,248
How are you, son?

454
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,877
- How are you?
- Good.

455
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,856
I have to kill that son of a bitch.

456
00:35:35,607 --> 00:35:40,196
Carrillo's a cop.
You can always buy a cop with money.

457
00:35:40,279 --> 00:35:43,741
- I've tried, believe me.
- Then offer more.

458
00:35:44,325 --> 00:35:49,288
Or I can loan you Navegante.
He will do whatever I ask.

459
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:54,377
That's true.

460
00:35:55,378 --> 00:36:00,674
It's silver or lead.
That's the choice for that bastard.

461
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:05,763
Speaking of lead,
I'm getting a shipment of weapons in.

462
00:36:05,846 --> 00:36:07,681
Uzis, grenades...

463
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:13,687
If I could find a nuclear weapon...
But now I'm negotiating a fucking missile.

464
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:16,857
- A missile? No fucking way.
- Yes.

465
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,234
- Boss.
- Eh?

466
00:36:18,317 --> 00:36:21,737
<i>This is crack cocaine,
seized a few days ago</i>

467
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,989
<i>by drug enforcement agents,</i>

468
00:36:24,073 --> 00:36:27,285
<i>in a park just across the street
from the White House.</i>

469
00:36:27,493 --> 00:36:30,746
<i>And our message
to the drug cartels is this:</i>

470
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:32,457
<i>the rules have changed.</i>

471
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:34,833
He's bullshitting, right?

472
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,213
He's smoking that shit.
I guarantee it.

473
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:44,009
Motherfucker.

474
00:36:46,178 --> 00:36:48,180
Mm...

475
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:57,189
Mrs. Quiroga told me
the neighbors on the block took a vote.

476
00:36:57,273 --> 00:36:58,565
They want us to move.

477
00:36:58,774 --> 00:37:03,154
But we have guards stationed
outside the house 24 hours a day.

478
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:04,780
That's what scares them.

479
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:09,827
Come here.

480
00:37:11,745 --> 00:37:14,290
It won't always be like this,
my love.

481
00:37:39,148 --> 00:37:40,774
- Rodrigo.
- Hello, Horacio.

482
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,776
- Everything OK?
- May I speak with you?

483
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,445
Yes, sure. Come in, come in.

484
00:37:46,238 --> 00:37:48,032
<i>Let's talk about the incorruptibles.</i>

485
00:37:49,783 --> 00:37:51,202
I'm listening.

486
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:02,588
I've been instructed to tell you that
if you cease and desist your operations,

487
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:06,175
you will receive
a one-time payment of six million.

488
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:10,012
Horacio... that's US dollars,
not pesos.

489
00:38:12,764 --> 00:38:14,433
Instructed by whom?

490
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,312
I think you can guess.

491
00:38:20,523 --> 00:38:21,648
Say the name.

492
00:38:21,815 --> 00:38:23,484
You know who.

493
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:26,153
Say the name, Rodrigo.

494
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:32,117
Escobar.

495
00:38:37,831 --> 00:38:41,752
Don't look at me like that, Horacio.
I've always cared for you.

496
00:38:41,835 --> 00:38:46,215
I'm making this suggestion to save
you and your family from terrible grief.

497
00:38:48,634 --> 00:38:50,719
This man has tentacles.

498
00:38:50,802 --> 00:38:53,639
I'm surprised
he hasn't killed you already.

499
00:38:55,558 --> 00:38:56,683
Get out.

500
00:38:58,977 --> 00:39:00,563
Horacio, please...

501
00:39:09,071 --> 00:39:10,197
Horacio...

502
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,207
Take care.

503
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:30,426
I was driving to the church.

504
00:39:30,509 --> 00:39:33,262
Was with my buddy, John.
He was my best man.

505
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:37,349
We were late.

506
00:39:37,433 --> 00:39:40,478
It was fucking blazing outside,
110 degrees.

507
00:39:40,561 --> 00:39:43,730
Whole bridal party was there
sweating their balls off, I'm sure.

508
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:48,569
And all of a sudden, I stopped the car.

509
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:50,696
Please don't tell me
you left her at the altar.

510
00:39:51,614 --> 00:39:53,574
I don't know if she actually
made it to the altar.

511
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:59,746
Well, you saved her
a lifetime of hell.

512
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:03,501
Yeah, she forgave me. Eventually.

513
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:07,087
- Married a stockbroker from Dallas.
- Hm.

514
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:10,048
Randy... I think.

515
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,721
Trust me, she's better off.

516
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:22,186
What if Father Sobrino talks?

517
00:40:24,062 --> 00:40:25,606
He's gonna talk.

518
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:57,929
It's about time, Navegante.

519
00:41:01,433 --> 00:41:05,312
Sorry I'm late. I couldn't came before.

520
00:41:06,021 --> 00:41:07,398
What do you got?

521
00:41:08,774 --> 00:41:10,817
Gacha's going tonight to Cartagena.

522
00:41:15,447 --> 00:41:17,199
I can help you get him.

523
00:41:17,282 --> 00:41:19,868
You said you had information.
You didn't say Gacha.

524
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,372
I guess is your lucky day.

525
00:41:30,629 --> 00:41:33,131
- What's the informant's motivation?
- Could be money.

526
00:41:33,298 --> 00:41:36,677
The reward for Gacha is one million US.
I'd say that's pretty good motivation.

527
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:39,597
He spends his life on the run
if we don't catch him.

528
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,600
- Something else going on with this guy.
- It's worth taking a risk.

529
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:50,023
Peña, you go to Cartagena.
Solely in an observational capacity.

530
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:53,736
We want this man captured alive,
if possible.

531
00:41:53,819 --> 00:41:55,153
Murphy stays here in Bogotá.

532
00:41:55,362 --> 00:41:57,615
Gaviria's press conference is tonight,

533
00:41:57,698 --> 00:42:01,535
and I wanna be sure whatever
he plans to say, he gets to say it.

534
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:05,289
Yes, ma'am.

535
00:42:05,372 --> 00:42:07,666
That's a beautiful dress,
Ambassador Noonan.

536
00:42:09,918 --> 00:42:12,838
Come on, Father. Ah, yeah. Talk!

537
00:42:15,758 --> 00:42:18,510
Huh?

538
00:42:22,514 --> 00:42:24,475
Huh?

539
00:42:24,683 --> 00:42:27,728
More? You want more?

540
00:42:27,812 --> 00:42:31,189
No! No more, please! No more!

541
00:42:31,273 --> 00:42:33,400
No more!

542
00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:35,986
Ah, he's all yours.
He's ready to talk.

543
00:42:36,945 --> 00:42:38,113
Father...

544
00:42:39,615 --> 00:42:42,493
how did Elisa Alvaro get away?

545
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,004
She left with the American woman.

546
00:42:56,047 --> 00:42:59,050
Murphy's wife.

547
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:04,640
I just don't understand.
How'd you get involved with communists?

548
00:43:04,723 --> 00:43:06,725
Have you actually met a communist?

549
00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:09,186
Yeah, I have, actually...
and she lied to me.

550
00:43:09,269 --> 00:43:11,104
Well, I'm not a communist, Connie.

551
00:43:11,313 --> 00:43:14,733
I'm fighting against poverty,
corruption, injustice and greed.

552
00:43:14,941 --> 00:43:17,444
But I guess Americans
don't have the same problem.

553
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:18,821
Don't we?

554
00:43:18,904 --> 00:43:20,447
It's not the same.

555
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,783
Look, I just wish
you'd been straight with me.

556
00:43:24,242 --> 00:43:25,494
I'm sorry.

557
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:27,538
Perhaps I should go.

558
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:32,543
You can't just go.
Look, if they find you, they'll kill you.

559
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:37,548
I fell in love with a man...
with a good man.

560
00:43:37,631 --> 00:43:40,217
And I was hoping
to do something good.

561
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:45,222
But instead, I fell into something...
else, something more violent.

562
00:43:47,015 --> 00:43:49,142
Yeah, that makes two of us.

563
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:56,525
I'll see you when I get home.

564
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:04,282
Here, Elisa's ID.

565
00:44:04,366 --> 00:44:07,452
- What am I supposed to do with that?
- Take her to Cumaral.

566
00:44:07,536 --> 00:44:09,037
My contact there agreed to hide her.

567
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,539
While you go to Cartagena?

568
00:44:10,622 --> 00:44:12,750
I can't believe this shit.

569
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:15,544
- Who made this?
- Brother, what do you suggest we do?

570
00:44:15,627 --> 00:44:17,087
Jump out of a window?

571
00:44:19,548 --> 00:44:20,841
Look, she's...

572
00:44:22,843 --> 00:44:25,345
- She's important.
- To who?

573
00:44:26,304 --> 00:44:27,598
To us.

574
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:39,777
I take care of Elisa...
you better fucking get Gacha.

575
00:44:48,201 --> 00:44:50,203
Finally, a romantic date.

576
00:44:51,204 --> 00:44:52,831
It's been a long time
since we've been alone.

577
00:44:52,915 --> 00:44:58,420
Mm. Just you, me...
and our bodyguard.

578
00:45:01,339 --> 00:45:05,051
Like the old days when we were young
and your father watched us.

579
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:08,639
- Mm. My father adored you.
- Yeah, right.

580
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,619
Garcia...

581
00:45:45,884 --> 00:45:48,178
Hello? Yes.

582
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:53,809
Yes.

583
00:45:56,645 --> 00:45:58,188
But he's all right?

584
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:02,526
All right.

585
00:46:19,084 --> 00:46:20,878
Ana?

586
00:46:31,972 --> 00:46:33,015
Ana?

587
00:46:42,315 --> 00:46:43,525
Ana?

588
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:48,906
Ana!

589
00:46:52,076 --> 00:46:56,371
A little bird... came into the house.

590
00:46:56,454 --> 00:46:58,082
I'm helping it out.

591
00:47:09,342 --> 00:47:10,510
What?

592
00:47:15,807 --> 00:47:17,851
There was an assassination attempt...

593
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:22,397
on Colonel Carrillo.

594
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,774
Did someone die?

595
00:47:24,983 --> 00:47:27,402
One of his men.

596
00:47:29,487 --> 00:47:31,740
It must be terrible,

597
00:47:31,823 --> 00:47:34,034
the position you're in.

598
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:37,412
I want you to know
I think you are very brave.

599
00:47:40,248 --> 00:47:44,002
I'm not brave. Not like Galán.

600
00:47:45,211 --> 00:47:47,297
That fear keeps you alive.

601
00:47:48,882 --> 00:47:51,426
That's what none of them understand.

602
00:47:55,263 --> 00:47:58,809
I will support any decision you make.

603
00:48:06,232 --> 00:48:10,028
<i>It's been said that
nothing gives the fearful more courage...</i>

604
00:48:10,904 --> 00:48:12,948
<i>than another's fear.</i>

605
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:21,581
<i>Luis Carlos Galán
had made a decision that cost his life.</i>

606
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:26,503
<i>And now, it was Gaviria's turn.</i>

607
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:31,633
Welcome, American press.

608
00:48:31,716 --> 00:48:34,719
Tonight, I have the great pleasure

609
00:48:34,928 --> 00:48:38,807
of introducing candidate César Gaviria.

610
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:02,706
It has long been
our government's policy...

611
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:10,338
to deal with every man equally...
in the eyes of the law.

612
00:49:12,423 --> 00:49:13,717
So...

613
00:49:34,196 --> 00:49:35,739
Colombians say...

614
00:49:37,657 --> 00:49:40,202
God made our land so beautiful...

615
00:49:41,286 --> 00:49:43,788
it was unfair to the rest of the world.

616
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:47,667
So to even the score...

617
00:49:49,169 --> 00:49:54,758
God populated the land...
with a race of evil men.

618
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:03,183
<i>The primary impediment
to a free and uninhibited future</i>

619
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:09,231
<i>is the violence and terror
that currently grips our beloved country.</i>

620
00:50:10,648 --> 00:50:15,403
A violence initiated by these evil men...

621
00:50:16,487 --> 00:50:18,907
will be brought to justice...

622
00:50:21,367 --> 00:50:23,494
in the name of decency...

623
00:50:26,081 --> 00:50:28,583
and in the memory of Luis Carlos Galán.

624
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:31,211
<i>We will extradite.</i>

625
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:36,466
<i>This decision...
will not come from fear.</i>

626
00:50:37,717 --> 00:50:41,387
It has come from a clarity of judgment...

627
00:50:42,388 --> 00:50:46,268
free from the cloud of terror
that surrounds us

628
00:50:46,351 --> 00:50:47,811
and obscures our view.

629
00:50:50,438 --> 00:50:54,943
I can say only one thing to Colombians
in these times of peril:

630
00:50:59,364 --> 00:51:01,992
There will be a future.

631
00:51:07,205 --> 00:51:10,041
Thank you.

632
00:52:00,508 --> 00:52:01,759
<i>Hello?</i>

633
00:52:02,927 --> 00:52:05,180
You think you're hot shit?

634
00:52:05,263 --> 00:52:07,640
You should change your satellite phone.

635
00:52:09,517 --> 00:52:10,935
Who is this?

636
00:52:11,019 --> 00:52:14,605
<i>Your mother's in Rionegro
with that tub of lard you call your son.</i>

637
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:19,027
<i>And your wife was at Carrera 11 today,
shopping for clothes.</i>

638
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:22,155
You bastard son of a bitch,
you think that...

639
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:25,075
What, you think because you're a cop
I'm afraid of you or something?

640
00:52:25,158 --> 00:52:28,412
<i>You know where my family is, fag,
well, I know where yours is, too.</i>

641
00:52:28,494 --> 00:52:30,496
<i>- Don't forget that.</i>
- Gonorrhea bastard son of a bitch.

642
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,749
Why don't you take money
like everyone else?

643
00:52:32,832 --> 00:52:35,585
I could have had you living like a king.
But now, guess what?

644
00:52:35,668 --> 00:52:41,091
Time to kill your dad, your mom,
your kids, your entire family,

645
00:52:41,174 --> 00:52:43,385
and you should be smart enough to realize

646
00:52:43,468 --> 00:52:47,972
I have each and every one of them
under watch, you fucking bastard.

647
00:52:48,056 --> 00:52:50,558
<i>Not everyone's for sale, Pablo.</i>

648
00:52:50,641 --> 00:52:53,478
<i>You just keep hiding,
and I will find you.</i>

649
00:52:53,561 --> 00:52:54,938
<i>Don't know when...</i>

650
00:52:55,146 --> 00:52:56,940
but I will find you.

651
00:52:57,732 --> 00:52:59,401
And when I find you...

652
00:53:00,402 --> 00:53:02,195
- I'm going to kill you.
- <i>I'm going to kill you</i>

653
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:04,697
and your entire family,
you son of a bitch!

654
00:53:26,094 --> 00:53:28,179
It's war, then.
