00:58:30,481 --> 00:58:32,309
How long did you interview
Arthur Fleck for?

944
00:58:32,613 --> 00:58:33,875
About two hours.

945
00:58:34,049 --> 00:58:35,442
About two hours.

946
00:58:36,704 --> 00:58:38,402
It was actually 89 minutes.

947
00:58:39,707 --> 00:58:42,623
Tell me,
how can you say for certain,

948
00:58:42,797 --> 00:58:45,017
that Arthur isn't mentally ill?

949
00:58:45,844 --> 00:58:48,977
How can you be so sure
after just 89 minutes,

950
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:51,502
that this "Joker"

951
00:58:51,676 --> 00:58:55,723
isn't a distinctly separate
and split personality from him?

952
00:58:55,897 --> 00:58:58,204
That that's not who he is.

953
00:58:58,378 --> 00:59:01,642
Well, I also reviewed
all the test results.

954
00:59:01,816 --> 00:59:06,473
Psychological tests,
neurological and medical tests.

955
00:59:06,647 --> 00:59:09,607
And in my view,
it's just a performance.

956
00:59:09,781 --> 00:59:10,999
[crowd murmurs]

957

[Ms. Stewart]
Did you read the records

958
00:59:12,523 --> 00:59:14,612
from the
Department of Social Services...

959
00:59:15,917 --> 00:59:19,617
...that show that when Arthur
was seven years old,

960
00:59:19,791 --> 00:59:21,793
they returned him
to his abuser's home?

961
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:26,058
- His mother's home.
- [pen scratching]

962
00:59:26,232 --> 00:59:28,234
[doctor] I did, yes.

963
00:59:29,366 --> 00:59:32,325
[Ms. Stewart] And when you
interviewed him for 89 minutes,

964
00:59:33,326 --> 00:59:35,937
did you ask him
why Social Services

965
00:59:36,111 --> 00:59:38,505
didn't believe
the horrific stories

966
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:41,552
a seven-year-old boy told them

967
00:59:41,726 --> 00:59:44,381
about the physical
and sexual abuse he suffered?

968
00:59:44,555 --> 00:59:46,165
[faint, echoing laughter]

969
00:59:48,994 --> 00:59:51,910
No, I...
I didn't ask him about that.

970
00:59:52,084 --> 00:59:53,738
[Ms. Stewart] Hmm.

971
00:59:53,912 --> 00:59:56,697
So you want us to believe,

972
00:59:57,742 --> 01:00:02,921
that after spending just
89 minutes with Arthur Fleck,

973
01:00:03,095 --> 01:00:07,186
and reading through
his records and tests

974
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:10,755
from the same government
agencies that abandoned him,

975
01:00:10,929 --> 01:00:12,583
you want us to believe

976
01:00:12,757 --> 01:00:16,151
that you can say
with absolute certainty

977
01:00:16,325 --> 01:00:20,808
that Arthur doesn't suffer
from any serious mental illness?

978
01:00:21,809 --> 01:00:24,986
That he didn't need
to retreat into fantasy

979
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,641
and create another identity

980
01:00:27,815 --> 01:00:33,778
to protect that scared,
vulnerable, seven-year-old boy

981
01:00:33,952 --> 01:00:36,911
from all the trauma and abuse
he suffered?

982
01:00:37,956 --> 01:00:41,525
And that that identity
didn't come out again,

983
01:00:41,786 --> 01:00:44,658
when he was
attacked and tormented

984
01:00:44,832 --> 01:00:48,096
by three drunk bullies
on the subway?

And it's up to the jury

November 17.

Let the record show,

1016
01:02:01,692 --> 01:02:04,651
November 17th
is the day that Mr. Fleck

1017
01:02:04,825 --> 01:02:07,524
stabbed Randall Kleinmanhoffer
to death.

1018
01:02:08,568 --> 01:02:14,487
The very same day that he shot
and killed Murray Franklin.

Now, I know it's not

1022
01:02:23,061 --> 01:02:24,279
[Mrs. Kane] Yes, I have.

1023
01:02:24,453 --> 01:02:27,108
And in your opinion,

1024
01:02:27,282 --> 01:02:30,677
does this sound

I knew his mother a little bit.

1256
01:15:55,002 --> 01:15:57,265
She was really sweet
to my daughter.

1257
01:15:58,571 --> 01:16:00,138
[Dent] And Ms. Dumond,

1258
01:16:00,573 --> 01:16:03,620
why is it that you didn't want
to come here and testify today?

1259
01:16:04,664 --> 01:16:07,972
And why did you initially
ignore our subpoenas?

1260
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:11,889
Well,
after Arthur did what he did,

1261
01:16:13,369 --> 01:16:15,327
the press wanted
to talk to me about it.

1262
01:16:16,415 --> 01:16:18,156
And then I was a character

1263
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:21,289
in that awful TV movie
they made, and...

1264
01:16:22,116 --> 01:16:22,986
- [whispers] It was awful?
- Then all these people...

1265
01:16:22,987 --> 01:16:24,467
No.

1266
01:16:24,641 --> 01:16:26,991
...supporters, I guess,
like the people outside,

1267
01:16:27,165 --> 01:16:31,299
started showing up
at my work and harassing me,

1268
01:16:31,691 --> 01:16:33,476
blaming me for what happened
to Arthur.

1269
01:16:35,782 --> 01:16:38,176
So I was afraid for my safety
and for my daughter's safety.

1270
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:39,743
We moved out of the city.

1271
01:16:40,308 --> 01:16:43,616
Well, then why did you
finally decide to comply?

1272
01:16:43,790 --> 01:16:45,790
Because I should have
called the police that night.

1273
01:16:48,186 --> 01:16:50,106
Then maybe all those people
wouldn't have been...

1274
01:16:52,059 --> 01:16:53,844
Maybe they wouldn't be
dead now if I did.

1275
01:16:55,759 --> 01:16:58,196
Thank you. No more questions.

1280

He told me he was having
a bad day. And then he left.

1281
01:17:16,301 --> 01:17:18,695
So, he never hurt
or even threatened

1282

[Sophie] No.

1285

[Sophie] I did.

[Ms. Stewart] And did that seem
like the same man

1287
01:17:32,273 --> 01:17:34,362
who was sitting
in your apartment that night?

1288
01:17:35,015 --> 01:17:38,758
Did he sound the same
or even look the same?

1289
01:17:39,324 --> 01:17:41,848
No, I mean, he was...
he was wearing clown make-up.

1291

[Ms. Stewart]
And while Arthur's mother

1292
01:17:46,331 --> 01:17:49,421
was being so sweet
to your daughter,

1293
01:17:49,595 --> 01:17:51,510
what was she telling you
about her own son?

1294
01:17:55,862 --> 01:17:57,255
Um...

1295
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:01,607
She told me that there was
something wrong with Arthur,

1296
01:18:01,781 --> 01:18:04,175
and that he lived
in a fantasy world

1297
01:18:04,349 --> 01:18:07,265
and that he had this laugh.

1298
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:09,572
[Ms. Stewart] She told you
it was a "dumb laugh."

1299
01:18:09,746 --> 01:18:11,835
<i>That's what she called it.</i>

1301

[Sophie] Yes.

1302
01:18:16,666 --> 01:18:18,266
[Ms. Stewart]
What else did she tell you?

1303
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:24,325
That she made up a story,
when he was a kid.

1304
01:18:25,326 --> 01:18:27,415
So that he would feel
better about it.

1305
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:28,808
So that he would stop crying,

1306
01:18:28,982 --> 01:18:30,810
so that he wouldn't
kill himself.

1307
01:18:31,768 --> 01:18:33,204
What was the story?

1308
01:18:33,987 --> 01:18:36,860
[Sophie] That he was put
on this earth to bring joy.

1309
01:18:38,514 --> 01:18:40,594
Something like that.
It's why she called him "Happy."

1310
01:18:41,299 --> 01:18:42,255
[Ms. Stewart] And?

1311

[Sophie] And she...

1312
01:18:44,998 --> 01:18:46,870

he based his whole life

1313
01:18:47,044 --> 01:18:48,959
around this made-up story.

1314
01:18:49,133 --> 01:18:52,005
He was a street clown,
and he wanted to be a comedian.

for doing that?

1317
01:18:57,141 --> 01:18:58,882
[Sophie] She just thought
it was ridiculous

that he thought
he could make people laugh.
