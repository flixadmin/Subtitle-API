and that's why
I have to do this job,

626
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,521
I'm not, okay?

627
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,899
I don't need a deep, personal
reason to hate metas, Allen.

628
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:05,403
I just need to see
person after person transformed,

629
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:08,239
given these
extraordinary abilities,

630
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:10,366
and watch them
be squandered.

631
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:13,327
Robbing banks, hurting people,
spreading fear.

632
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:16,663
It's just...
well, it's not just a crime.

633
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,540
It's an absolute waste.

634
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,876
I mean, can you imagine

635
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:22,962
what it would be like
to have those powers?

636
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,922
I mean, I would be
helping people.

637
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,383
I would be improving
the world.

638
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:32,972
I guess I wasn't one
of the chosen few, was I?

639
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,514
- That's it?

640
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,475
You're mad at them
because you weren't chosen?

641
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,019
Sorry, I mean,
I'm just saying,

642
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,897
it can't be easy
being a meta-human,

643
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:45,818
having your life...their lives
change in ways that,

644
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,904
you know, neither one of us
could possibly imagine.

645
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:51,240
It's got to take
some adjusting.

646
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:53,826
- Right.
So now you're defending them?

647
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,661
- Well, no, I mean, I'm...
I don't think that...

648
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:59,623
- This internship thing
we're doing is completely over.

649
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,461
- Whatever.

650
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,301
Transformers are the key.
- No, I agree...

651
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,094
- Anytime the monster's
shown up,

652
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,180
any nearby have exploded.
- They blow up.

653
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,056
- Car alarms keep
malfunctioning too.

654
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:19,810
- Car alarms, transformers.
What is the connection?

655
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,645
Yeah, we'll get there, fellas.
We'll get there.

656
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,481
We just got to keep trying.

657
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:26,524
- Maybe someone's pulling power
out of the transformers

658
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,402
and using it
to power the monster.

659
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,237
- Power...
yes, the monster.

660
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:34,325
That's...ah, you just beat me
to it, San Francisco.

661
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:36,369
- [chuckles]
See, that can't be it, H.R.

662
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,786
- Can't be it...
- 'Cause we would have detected

663
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,413
a surge in the power grid.
- We did not.

664
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:40,831
- Not if it was
broadcast power

665
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,333
or something
like a portable Tesla tower.

666
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:45,044
- A portable Tesla power.

667
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,712
- Tower.
- Tower. That's what it is.

668
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:49,507
Nice. Mm, mm.
Teamwork, hmm?

669
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:51,967
So PS, where I'm from,
on my Earth,

670
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,635
we call that a problem solved.

671
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,054
I'm gonna go for coffee.

672
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,473
On my Earth, the coffee
was wiped out by blight.

673
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:59,433
- Blight, yeah.
- Can you imagine?

674
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,561
- He didn't really do
anything, did he?

675
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:04,813
- Thank you.

676
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:06,190
Took me a while
to realize it,

677
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:07,983
but he's just resaying
everything

678
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,776
that we're saying
in a different way.

679
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,987
- No, he did have
the idea for the rope.

680
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,655
- Ah, ah, reverse inception.

681
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,449
He made you think he had
the idea for the rope,

682
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,159
but he didn't even tell us
how to use it.

683
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:20,120
- Okay, well, we're not gonna be
caught off guard again.

684
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,705
We should vibe him.

685
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,581
- It'd be my pleasure.

686
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,545
- Hey-oh.

687
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,547
- Hey, baby girl.
- Hey.

688
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,340
- You've been hanging out here
a lot lately.

689
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:32,883
- Yeah, well, there's
a lot of scared people

690
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,843
with this monster
running around the city.

691
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:36,636
- Oh, we'll get him.
We always do.

692
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,638
- Oh, yeah? Is that a quote
I can use for my article?

693
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,890
- No.

694
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,559
- All right.
It was worth a try.

695
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,438
Dad, you know Wally and I
are all right, right?

696
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,231
- What is that
supposed to mean?

697
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:52,278
- We just don't want you
to not do things because of us.

698
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,365
You know, we just want you
to...find someone.

699
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,075
- I'm not having
this conversation with you.

700
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,618
- Dad, that DA
is totally into you.

701
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,329
You should go out
with her.

702
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:06,542
- Iris, I don't need you
to be Cupid.

703
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:07,751
I got my job.

704
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,129
I got you, Barry, Wally.
I'm good.

705
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,424
- I know Dad and
that's great. I just...

706
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,217
Now that I'm falling in love
with someone,

707
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:17,886
I just want you to have
the same thing.

708
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:20,514
- Joe? Alert every task force
and sniper unit.

709
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,266
Tell 'em to load up.

710
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:24,310
- I should get
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

711
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,936
- What's up?
- Albert thinks

712
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,396
he's figured out
the creature's next target.

713
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:28,772
- Well, if there's ever
an opportunity

714
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,066
for a 40-foot monster
to wreak havoc,

715
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:33,235
it's gonna be where people
like to gather.

716
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:34,694
2nd Street Promenade.

717
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,405
- Well, let's end this.

718
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:37,990
- That's what I intend
to do, Detective.

719
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,244
- Where'd he go?
- Doesn't matter.

720
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:43,579
I don't need him.

721
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:45,414
- What do you mean?
What do you...hey, dude.

722
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:47,333
Come on, you can't just go
through his stuff; that's not...

723
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,376
- [scoffs] I'm not
going through his stuff.

724
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,378
See, this is what
I'm talking about.

725
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,380
What even is this?

728
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,804

00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,515
What are you doing?

730
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:03,849
- What are you doing?

731
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,185
- What?
- Who are you really?

732
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,270
We know you're hiding
something.

733
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:12,358
- You've been burned,
twice...

734
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,360
by a man
with the same face as me.

735
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,821
I imagine it's hard to trust
after something like that.

736
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,615
- You think?
- I do think.

737

So play...

- What narrative?

747
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,723
- Narrative.

748
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,601
I'm writing a novel.

749
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,395
"The Tales of H.R. Wells."

750
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,104
Catchy, I know.
[laughs]

751
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:55,192
- Wait, I'm sorry, you're
a scientist and a novelist?

752
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,777
- Yes.
- Wow. That's perfect.

753
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,446
- Thank you.
That's exactly right.

754
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,448
I'm a scientist and a novelist;
I run S.T.A.R. Labs,

755
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,242
and also I'm an author
of science-romance.

756
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,743
That's my niche.
Write what you know.

757
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,704
And I thought,
"Well, what better opportunity

758
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,581
"than to come
to another Earth and pen

759
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:12,209
yet another best seller
about my adventures here?"

760
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,461
- Why didn't you just tell us
this in the first place?

761
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,255
- I guess it didn't
seem relevant,

762
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,923
and also,
I didn't think

763
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,259
you guys were gonna
rifle through my belongings.

That's all it is.

I'm a scientist

Do you think you can
trust me now,

767
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,267
or is that not something

768
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,810
that you have
on this Earth, trust?

769
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,854
- Trust?
- Oh! [laughs]

You scared
the dickens out of...

It's back.

- Yeah, you've missed a lot.

937
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,688
- More of an advisory role
for me, but I was there.

938
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,524
I remembered how we...you don't
think that's something?

939
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,067
Let me present you
with a scenario.

940
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,401
You're confronted
with something,

941
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,736
a threat that
you've never seen before.

942
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,822
You don't know how to stop it.
Who does?

943
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:42,659
That's value to you.
Let me prove my worth to you.

944
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:46,038
If I fail, I will "pfft"
right back to my Earth,

945
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,622
but if I succeed,
I will have succeeded

946
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:51,835
not just in redeeming myself
but also...

947
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:54,212
will have done some good
with my life.

948
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,922
- You know, you're lucky
we're pretty big

949
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:57,632
on redemption
and doing good here,

950
00:36:57,674 --> 00:36:59,926
so I think you can...
I don't know...

951
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:02,137
stay for a few weeks,
try to prove yourself,

952
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:05,849
but if not, "fyoo,"
back to your Earth.

953
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:07,308
- Thank you.
- Hey,

954
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,227
no more repackaging.

955
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,729
- Word is bond.

956
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,439
- That...just no more that.

957
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,527
- All right, H.R.
- Okay.

958
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,490
- Where you been?

959
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:25,994
- I actually went
to visit my mother.

960
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:27,162
- Your mother?

961
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:29,122
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, boy.

962
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,041
Why?

963
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:36,295
- To see if we could work
through some of our issues.

964
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,882
And I think we might actually be
on the road to recovery.

965
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,845
- When it comes to family,
you got to do whatever it takes,

966
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:47,682
'cause one day, you might not
be able to do that anymore.

967
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,937
Glad you're back.

968
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,605
- This is home.

969
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,245
- I nearly killed
a kid tonight.

970
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,707
The monster
we were chasing,

971
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:14,667
it turns out it was
just a hologram,

972
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,837
operated by a
15-year-old boy.

973
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:20,381
Flash came to save
the day.

974
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:26,679
And he saved me
from doing something...

975
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:27,889
- I heard.

976
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:30,142
- You know what's sad?

977
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:34,187
That kid, he's just acting
'cause he's scared, you know?

978
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,772
He wants everyone
to be terrified

979
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:39,317
and to run away from the monster
so he can feel powerful.

980
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,613
I know what that's like.

981
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,073
- How do you mean?

982
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:46,908
- I come from a pretty
wealthy family...

983
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,245
[laughs]
Back in England.

984
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:53,456
It's a long line
of generations of old money,

985
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,458
tradition...
nonsense, really.

986
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,419
And I was the heir.
I was their firstborn son.

987
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,879
I was supposed
to inherit the lot.

988
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,632
But I was the odd duck...
[laughs]

989
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:03,925
Who would rather
go in the garden

990
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:08,013
and collect samples
of insects...

991
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:12,600
[laughs]
Rather than learn how to tie

992
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:13,977
a Windsor knot

993
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:17,230
or which fork
to use first at dinner.

994
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:19,899
Yeah. No, I wanted more.

995
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,693
You know?

996
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,195
I came here to do
the one thing

997
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:25,071
that they couldn't
stop me from doing:

998
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:28,700
becoming a scientist...
becoming a great scientist.

999
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,785
And then just as I got
to the top of my field,

1000
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:34,706
poof. The world
changes overnight.

1001
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,126
Meta-humans.

1002
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:40,419
I don't know a single thing
about meta-humans.

1003
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,881
I don't know how they talk.
I don't know how they walk.

1004
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,382
I certainly don't know
the first thing

1005
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:48,220
about stopping them, so...
rendered useless.

1006
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:51,472
I suppose that's the monster
that I'm running from now:

1007
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:55,227
just feeling powerless.

1008
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:58,188
- Yeah, I feel the same way
some days, Julian.

1009
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,400
I lost my mom
when I was a kid.

1010
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,902
Lost my dad recently.

1011
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,321
It's a scary world.
People die.

1012
00:40:06,363 --> 00:40:11,034
Trusts are betrayed.
Things change.

1013
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,661
But change can be
a good thing, you know?

1014
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:18,791
It can bring new experiences,
new opportunities, people.

1015
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,877
You can treat 'em
like a potential enemy

1016
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:24,172
or like a new friend.

1017
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:28,718
Just trust that everything's
gonna be okay.

1018
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,845
- Yeah, maybe you're right.
[chuckles]

1019
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,896
You can stop.

1020
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,522
You can stay.

1021
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,901
I was really wrong
about The Flash,

1022
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,028
so I could be wrong
about you too.

1023
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,867
Good night, mate.

1024
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:54,077
- Julian?

1025
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,999
You want to get a drink?

1026
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:03,295
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'd like that.

1027
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:07,048
