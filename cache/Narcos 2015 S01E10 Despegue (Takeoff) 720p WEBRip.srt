1
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:35,892
- Agent Peña?
- What's this?

2
00:00:35,893 --> 00:00:37,394
It's from upstairs.

3
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:39,647
Oh, I get a card.

4
00:00:41,356 --> 00:00:44,233
Oh, CIA.

5
00:00:44,234 --> 00:00:46,945
"Congratulations,
Central Intelligence Agency."

6
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:50,239
This is, uh... this is blowing up
a little bit more than we expected, no?

7
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,158
Well, hopefully,
the son of a bitch rots in jail.

8
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,662
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
We gotta transfer him first.

9
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,247
- I forbade you to leak this.
-  How do you know it was us?

10
00:00:57,456 --> 00:00:59,917
- Escobar has a lot of enemies.
- 'Course it was you.

11
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,670
Whoever did this, it doesn't really
matter now. What's done is done.

12
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,673
Ambassador, like you said, this is
a Colombian matter. What do we care?

13
00:01:06,674 --> 00:01:09,550
I'm filing a report with the
Board of Personal Conduct in Washington.

14
00:01:09,551 --> 00:01:11,470
- Ambassador--
- Good, report to Washington.

15
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:13,972
'Cause if something isn't done,
every American down here

16
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:17,017
associated with the government
is gonna look like a fool, including you.

17
00:01:17,018 --> 00:01:20,938
I wasn't finished. Until further notice,
you're both suspended.

18
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:22,564
Go home.

20
00:04:39,303 --> 00:04:40,595
Ahh!

21
00:06:12,646 --> 00:06:13,688
Hm.

22
00:06:23,073 --> 00:06:24,158
Success.

23
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,080
Sure, it cost me a suspension,
but who cares?

24
00:06:30,914 --> 00:06:33,458
I just call it a week's paternity leave.

25
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:38,129
I was ready to crack a beer
and watch Escobar's endgame on TV.

26
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,756
See, because of me and Peña,

27
00:06:40,757 --> 00:06:44,135
the Colombian government
was sending in the army.

28
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:46,680
Not the cops,
but the fucking army.

29
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:52,018
There was no way that Escobar
was getting out of this one.

30
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:55,355
But, then again, in Colombia...

31
00:06:55,356 --> 00:06:58,066
nothing goes down
the way you think it will.

32
00:09:59,998 --> 00:10:03,000
The car was
outside the garage, still idling,

33
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:04,335
the keys still in the ignition.

34
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:07,296
- I've called his phone 20 times.
- Did you call embassy security?

35
00:10:07,297 --> 00:10:10,091
- No, I wanted to talk to you first.
- Good. Don't.

36
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,426
What? Why not?

37
00:10:12,427 --> 00:10:16,514
Nothing. I just... I don't wanna
ring any alarms before I check things out.

38
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:19,017
- What are you guys up to?
- Connie...

39
00:10:20,143 --> 00:10:22,395
Just try to relax, OK?
I'm sure everything's fine.

40
00:10:22,396 --> 00:10:25,022
I'm gonna take care of this.

41
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:29,235
I'll find out where he is, all right?

42
00:10:29,236 --> 00:10:31,572
Look, I'll make you a drink.

43
00:11:57,907 --> 00:11:59,700
What are you doing back here?

44
00:11:59,701 --> 00:12:02,621
- I forgot my socks.
-  I want you out in five minutes.

45
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,751
Son of a bitch. These Colombians
are knee-deep in a shit storm.

46
00:12:08,752 --> 00:12:10,170
We gotta talk.

47
00:12:11,546 --> 00:12:12,838
Back here.

48
00:12:15,676 --> 00:12:17,635
What? You get a hooker pregnant?

49
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,804
I think Agent Murphy got snatched.

50
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:22,306
I checked all area hospitals,
police stations.

51
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:23,974
We were pursuing leads
on the Cali cartel.

52
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:25,934
It could be related to that,
or it could be Escobar.

53
00:12:25,935 --> 00:12:27,894
Did you report it
to the Regional Security Office?

54
00:12:27,895 --> 00:12:30,022
If I tell the ROS,
it becomes a five-alarm fire,

55
00:12:30,023 --> 00:12:31,816
and whoever has him
might panic.

56
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:35,027
If it is Escobar,
he's dead already.

57
00:12:35,028 --> 00:12:38,905
Well, can you check your sources?
See what comes up?

58
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,202
Jesus Christ.

59
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:44,705
Let me see what I can do.

60
00:13:52,647 --> 00:13:56,983
Checked my sources with the Colombian
military. Nobody knows jack shit.

61
00:13:56,984 --> 00:14:00,529
So no indication Escobar had anything
to do with Murphy's disappearance?

62
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,656
It's time to sound the alarm.

63
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:06,035
Just hold off for a couple of hours, OK?

64
00:14:06,994 --> 00:14:10,623
We call out the troops,
he ends up dead like Diana Turbay.

65
00:14:10,624 --> 00:14:12,876
Thanks.

66
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,131
Mm.

67
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:23,937
Mm.

68
00:22:55,231 --> 00:22:58,524
Where have you been?
You don't even answer your phone?

69
00:22:58,525 --> 00:23:00,445
Sorry, I've, uh...
I've been working on it.

70
00:23:00,653 --> 00:23:03,197
What the fuck does that mean?
Doing what?

71
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,829
I'm sorry.

72
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:13,374
Just trying to hold it together.

73
00:23:17,795 --> 00:23:20,047
God, I just wanna go home.

74
00:23:21,882 --> 00:23:23,759
I want my husband back.

75
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:36,105
- Do you think he's alive, Javi?
- Yeah.

76
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:43,029
No.

77
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,699
You're just not sure he's dead.

78
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,219
Now what?

79
00:31:46,428 --> 00:31:48,346
I'm sorry, Ambassador.
We have a situation.

80
00:31:48,347 --> 00:31:49,807
Damn right we do.

81
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:52,643
Hey, partner.

82
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:57,271
Remember how I told you
that no one in their right mind

83
00:31:57,272 --> 00:31:59,358
would ever kill a DEA agent?

84
00:31:59,566 --> 00:32:02,360
Well, to be honest,
after they snatched me,

85
00:32:02,361 --> 00:32:04,612
I'd forgotten that, myself.

86
00:32:04,613 --> 00:32:09,116
But then, I calmed down and realized
that if they wanted to kill me,

87
00:32:09,117 --> 00:32:12,286
they would've blown my brains out
right in front of my house.

88
00:32:12,287 --> 00:32:15,207
This... was something different.

89
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,921
I figured this was Escobar
knowing that they were coming to get him,

90
00:32:21,129 --> 00:32:24,508
and grabbing
a get-out-of-jail-free card: me.

91
00:32:25,968 --> 00:32:27,219
Sit.

92
00:32:28,762 --> 00:32:33,391
Man, you fucked up. You think
that they're gonna make a trade for me?

93
00:32:33,392 --> 00:32:34,893
No. No!

94
00:32:34,894 --> 00:32:39,189
They're gonna storm that bullshit fuckin'
prison and blow his fuckin' head off!

95
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:51,325
I'm sorry
you were taken against your will,

96
00:32:51,326 --> 00:32:55,873
but I knew you wouldn't meet willingly,
given your last meeting with Navegante.

97
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:03,838
Mr. Herrera, I'm glad to see
your Cali cartel is doing so well,

98
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:05,549
but you've made a huge mistake.

99
00:33:06,341 --> 00:33:07,927
I don't see it that way.

100
00:33:09,219 --> 00:33:14,306
I know you like whiskey, but I'm taking
the liberty of making you a cocktail.

101
00:33:14,307 --> 00:33:18,437
I just learned how to do a really
interesting passion fruit daiquiri.

102
00:33:18,645 --> 00:33:21,146
That's wonderful,
but I don't want your fuckin' daiquiri.

103
00:33:21,147 --> 00:33:24,693
You're free to leave anytime.
We are a long way from Bogotá.

104
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:28,153
Fine. I'm leaving.
I'll show myself out.

105
00:33:28,154 --> 00:33:31,408
I thought you might
like to see some pictures I have.

106
00:33:47,215 --> 00:33:53,262
Several weeks ago, a wire tap caught you
calling Colonel Horacio Carrillo

107
00:33:53,263 --> 00:33:56,976
to ID a location
where Pablo's sicarios were gathering.

108
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,979
Two hours later, they were dead.

109
00:34:03,315 --> 00:34:06,735
Along with an innocent woman.

110
00:34:16,495 --> 00:34:17,746
OK.

111
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:22,374
Poison will be at La Dispensaria

112
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:24,294
at around midnight with his crew.

113
00:34:29,842 --> 00:34:31,885
Who's your contact at the embassy?

114
00:34:32,094 --> 00:34:34,638
Did you know she had two kids?

115
00:34:34,847 --> 00:34:38,599
What do you think our newspapers
will think of that?

116
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:44,815
Our government doesn't take too kindly
to American-backed death squads.

117
00:34:46,025 --> 00:34:48,442
I could blackmail you
with these pictures.

118
00:34:48,443 --> 00:34:51,154
You'd lose your career at the DEA,

119
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:55,784
go to jail...
maybe here in Colombia.

120
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,536
But don't worry.

121
00:34:58,537 --> 00:35:00,955
I won't ask you or Javier Peña

122
00:35:00,956 --> 00:35:04,084
to cross any line
you haven't already crossed.

123
00:35:05,711 --> 00:35:08,921
So you think the DEA and Cali cartel
would be a good match.

124
00:35:08,922 --> 00:35:12,257
There are many,
in every segment of Colombia,

125
00:35:12,258 --> 00:35:15,011
who have been persecuted
by Pablo Escobar.

126
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,138
The families of Moncada and Galeano,

127
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:20,265
the families of judges and police...

128
00:35:20,266 --> 00:35:23,687
people with resources
who need to be unified.

129
00:35:23,896 --> 00:35:25,771
They want vengeance.

130
00:35:25,772 --> 00:35:28,567
- And you'll help them get it?
- With your help.

131
00:35:33,072 --> 00:35:35,699
I can't make any commitments right now.

132
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,118
But I can tell you this:

133
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,664
When Pablo goes down,
and he will go down...

134
00:35:43,665 --> 00:35:46,667
you'll hear a knock at your door,

135
00:35:46,668 --> 00:35:49,088
and it'll be me.

136
00:35:55,802 --> 00:35:58,388
You haven't tried my daiquiri.

137
00:35:58,597 --> 00:36:01,224
That Herrera's a pretty good host.

138
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:05,186
Makes a mean cocktail, gives you
door-to-door service right to the embassy.

139
00:36:05,187 --> 00:36:07,730
- What did Herrera say?
- What'd he say?

140
00:36:07,731 --> 00:36:09,149
What'd he say?

141
00:36:10,442 --> 00:36:12,317
You fuckin' gave him that information.

142
00:36:12,318 --> 00:36:15,114
He's got pictures on me,
he's got tape on me, Javi.

143
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:20,619
Answer me.

144
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:24,455
- What?
- Did you give that shit to Herrera?

145
00:36:24,456 --> 00:36:27,750
- Do you think I would do that to you?
- Are you playing with Cali, Javi?

146
00:36:27,751 --> 00:36:30,544
That your version of "all in"?

147
00:36:30,545 --> 00:36:34,591
I got one goal: get Escobar.

148
00:36:36,551 --> 00:36:38,470
That's not an answer.

149
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,057
Who gave him the fucking photos?

150
00:36:44,392 --> 00:36:46,145
Hey.

151
00:36:56,071 --> 00:36:57,989
See you around, Jav.

152
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:00,659
I'm gonna go call my wife.

153
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:40,897
- All clear!
- All clear!

154
00:41:41,106 --> 00:41:42,566
- All clear!
- All clear!

155
00:42:31,948 --> 00:42:35,160
It's OK... it's OK.

156
00:42:35,368 --> 00:42:37,078
It's OK.

157
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,248
Steve...

158
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:43,418
I just wanna go home.

159
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,096
This is home.

160
00:43:14,449 --> 00:43:18,536
Less than an hour
after Escobar escaped La Catedral,

161
00:43:18,537 --> 00:43:22,873
word had spread all over Colombia
that war was coming again.

162
00:43:22,874 --> 00:43:25,376
But this time would be different.

163
00:43:25,377 --> 00:43:28,504
This time,
there would be no surrender...

164
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:31,340
no negotiations...

165
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:33,009
no deals.

166
00:43:33,968 --> 00:43:37,597
This time...
we were gonna kill him.

167
00:43:41,267 --> 00:43:47,023
Escobar said, "Better a grave
in Colombia than a cell in the US."

168
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,109
Well, guess what, motherfucker?

169
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:53,279
That works for me.

170
00:43:57,876 --> 00:44:05,876
doubled subs eliminated by sixsnobs
