1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,274
Last season on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,709
Star City's seen better days.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,279
They built a wall.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,874
Star City is a wall-free
zone once again.

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,394
Restoring the
Glades won't be easy.

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,597
The four of you are the
heroes that this city needs.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,871
We're stepping back.
We're leaving Star City.

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,190
What now?

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,919
A crisis is imminent.

10
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,440
What does the
multiverse require?

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,159
We seek to prevent
the inevitable.

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,640
What are you not telling me?

13
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,359
I've seen your future, Oliver,

14
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,318
inexorable and unavoidable.

15
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,118
I have watched you die.

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,519
Among the many misconceptions
humanity holds dear

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,718
is the fallacy that all
beings are created equal.

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,472
In truth, there are
those who are greater.

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,113
They are called heroes.

20
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,198
But even among heroes,
there are different echelons.

21
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,878
The highest belong to
those known as the paragons.

22
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,520
And they are the only
hope of all creation.

23
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,910
Oliver?

24
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,110
Hi, Mom.

25
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,510
Ohh. Ohh.

26
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,159
I missed you so much.

27
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,029
Oh, my beautiful
boy. My beautiful boy.

28
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,591
Your room is
exactly as you left it.

29
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,196
I never had the heart
to change anything.

30
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,832
I can't tell you how
great it feels to be home.

31
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,191
Oliver, it's really you,

32
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,910
Hi, Malcolm.

33
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,070
Welcome home.

34
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,158
Ok, what--where's--
where's Walter?

35
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,553
He sold his shares
of the company

36
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,159
when the Gambit went down.

37
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,396
Okay. Okay.

38
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,670
What'd I tell you?

39
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,829
Yachts suck.

40
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,875
I knew it. I knew you were
too stubborn to be dead.

41
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,470
Tommy.

42
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,434
Come on, man. Why
are you looking at me like

43
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,591
I'm the one who's
been gone a decade?

44
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,319
I just missed you.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,990
Where's Thea?

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,719
Sweetheart, um, why
don't you settle in?

47
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,632
I mean, you must be exhausted.

48
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,950
Yeah, but I'd like to see Thea.

49
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,598
Oliver, when you and
your father disappeared...

50
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,158
it wasn't easy on her.

51
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,874
She took things really hard.

52
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,317
And there is this new
drug called vertigo.

53
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,993
-I swear to you-- Tommy.

54
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,190
I tried my best to look--

55
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,395
Tommy, it wasn't your fault.

56
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,560
What wasn't his fault?

57
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,555
Thea, on her 18th birthday...

58
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,433
she overdosed.

59
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,832
Raisa's famous chicken marsala?

60
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,478
I used to make this
for William all the time.

61
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,590
Who's William?

62
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,870
Oh, I know.

63
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,395
He was, like, your
Wilson on the island, right?

64
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,630
Something like that.

65
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,350
How did you manage to
survive by yourself all that time?

66
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,469
It's a long story.

67
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,757
So, uh, things you missed

68
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,479
while you were gone.

69
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,712
1 got married and
divorced twice.

70
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,473
Ah, let's see. What
other gossip did you miss?

71
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,551
Our parents getting married.

72
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,553
It's, um-- -Complicated.

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,674
Oliver, I know this
must all be a lot.

74
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,517
Well, mom, my apologies,
but I actually am a little tired,

75
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,591
and I think I'm gonna
head up to my bedroom.

76
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,318
Thank you for dinner,

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,990
Hey.

78
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,799
Your bed has been made.

79
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,954
And there are fresh
towels in the bathroom.

80
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,430
Thank you.

81
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,318
I know the changes
must be overwhelming,

82
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,395
and you must feel like you're

83
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,039
on a different
planet or something.

84
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,390
You could say that.

85
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,311
It couldn't have been easy
all those years on that island.

86
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,673
Sounds like it
wasn't that easy here.

87
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,114
Now, you're not the same
man as when you left.

88
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,592
And don't take
this the wrong way,

89
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,360
but I get the sense that it's--

90
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,634
it's for the better.

91
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,274
I'm not so sure.

92
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,638
Mom, when we were growing up,

93
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:24,038
if you had to leave me
and Thea to protect us...

94
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,273
would you have done it?

95
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,716
Oliver, whether right or wrong,

96
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,120
everything I've ever done
was to protect my children.

97
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,191
It's all a parent can do.

98
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,994
And someday, hmm,
when you have children,

99
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,350
you'll understand.

100
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,997
Mom, I'm so sorry.

101
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,549
Ohh. Ohh.

102
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,074
Everything's okay.

103
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,076
You're home. You're safe.

104
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,954
Close your eyes, sweetheart.

105
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,713
Get some rest, okay?

106
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,314
All right.

107
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,395
You have failed this city.

108
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,270
Hyah!

109
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,350
Stand down.

110
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,474
Oliver,

111
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,960
what the hell are you
doing on my Earth?

112
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,114
Showoff.

113
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,755
Jealous?

114
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,233
Nostalgic.

115
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,757
It seems Adrian and I
have the same design sense.

116
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,071
If by that you
mean Felicity, yeah.

117
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,439
But this is my bunker.

118
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,155
Chase?

119
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,357
He's one of the
good guys, literally.

120
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,315
And you're helping
him in Star City.

121
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,120
Starling City. And
he's helping me.

122
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,557
We make a pretty
good team, actually.

123
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,553
Not that kind of a team.

124
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,351
So how much small
talk do I have to endure

125
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,552
before you tell me what it is
exactly you're doing on my Earth?

126
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,834
Yeah, it's along story.

127
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,590
Why don't you
start by telling me

128
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,114
what you were doing on Lian Yu?

129
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,432
You know, if you wanted to
pretend to be back from the dead,

130
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,034
you could've just
showed up in town.

131
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,355
I wasn't given a choice.

132
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,956
I was sent to your Earth,
and I arrived on Lian Yu.

133
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,676
Sent? Sent by who?

134
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,717
You get him to tell you
the truth yet, pretty bird?

135
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,675
And nothing but.

136
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,036
Seems Mr. Queen
survived the Gambit

137
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,238
and has spent the last 12
years on an island called Lian Yu.

138
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,119
That means "purgatory"
if I'm not mistaken.

139
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,193
It still doesn't explain
what you're doing

140
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,634
running around in my hood.

141
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,359
I needed an identity
to work under,

142
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,033
and yours seemed convenient.

143
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,750
Sorry.

144
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,354
What were you doing
at Queen-Merlyn?

145
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,119
Not killing those scientists,

146
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,554
if that's what you are implying.

147
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,552
Well, I'm using Laurel's
equipment to compare

148
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,950
the metallurgy of your arrows
to the ones that we found

149
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,952
in those men and
women, so we'll see.

150
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,799
Speak of the devil.

151
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,670
Literally.

152
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,150
The Dark Archer?
Name's a bit on the nose,

153
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,390
but it's descriptive.

154
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,312
Dark costume, jade pendant.

155
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,470
It's Malcolm Merlyn.

156
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,472
-Yeah, we thought so, too.
Ruled him out months ago.

157
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,438
It's Malcolm Merlyn.

158
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,637
And he killed those
scientists for a reason.

159
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,115
Where are you going?

160
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,840
I'm gonna have a
conversation with my stepdad.

161
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,079
It never ceases to impress--

162
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,469
humanity's capacity
for invention.

163
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,234
Hmm. Infinite number of worlds,

164
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,870
and not a single one where
man fails to emerge from caves

165
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,152
and hold dominion
over the Earth.

166
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,310
What are you doing here?

167
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,073
Reminding you what
you are doing here,

168
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,594
which does not
include interfering

169
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,114
in the events of this Earth.

170
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,270
I have no intention
of interfering.

171
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,511
Are you not here to
confront Malcolm Merlyn

172
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,440
with your suspicion that
he is the Dark Archer?

173
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,030
Well, I went to Applied
Sciences last night

174
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,679
to retrieve the
dwarf star particles

175
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,274
just like you asked me to.

176
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,716
You make it sound like a trifle.

177
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,997
Those specific particles
can only be found

178
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,798
on this Earth
out of a multitude.

179
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,510
My point is that when I arrived,
Malcolm had already stolen them.

180
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,950
You know what might help?

181
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,157
If I actually knew
why I was after them.

182
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,994
That I have tasked you
should be reason enough.

183
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,877
Or have you come to doubt
your commitment to this mission?

184
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,110
No, I have not.

185
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,912
At Harris Consolidated, we see the
wall coming down as an opportunity.

186
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,276
For the criminals of Star
City to rob the Glades blind?

187
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,510
To reunite the city.

188
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,393
I don't think people in
the Glades got that memo

189
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,551
‘cause last I checked,
crime's up 300%

190
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,989
since the wall went down.

191
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,039
There's an old saying--
there are 3 kinds of liars:

192
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,871
liars, damn liars,
and statisticians.

193
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,109
You're focusing on the Glades
to the exclusion of Star City

194
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,040
while net, there's been a
citywide reduction in crime.

195
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,398
And we have the vigilantes who
brought down the wall in the first place

196
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,550
to thank for that.

197
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,678
Hear that, guys? We're famous.

198
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,798
Really? 'Cause it sounds
like we got a long way to go.

199
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,710
Which is why we're
here, to make sure

200
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,757
nothing happens to Mr. Vasquez.

201
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,270
Whoa. And where do
you think you're going?

202
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,919
Movement outside.
Gonna check it out.

203
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,110
Negative.

204
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,350
Don't break perimeter.

205
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,919
Relax. It'll take a sec.

206
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,354
Just like Pennytown.

207
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,079
What was that, Mr. Harris?

208
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,871
Uh...oh. I--I was just saying
that the unification money

209
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,714
put into Pennytown
prevented a potential disaster

210
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,917
because we
listened to each other.

211
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,670
Well, she is either
ignoring you, William--

212
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,069
For the second time this month.

213
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,475
or the comm systems are failing.

214
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,869
For the fifth time this month.

215
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,791
It's a new era.

216
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,558
Growing pains are
to be expected. Heh!

217
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,157
Mia, do you copy?

218
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,269
Excuse me, miss.

219
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,240
Mr. Vasquez doesn't want any
guests wandering the property.

220
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,916
This neighborhood just--
just isn't safe anymore.

221
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,549
Sorry. I just, uh,
wanted a look around.

222
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,750
Mia--

223
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,752
Allow me to escort you back in.

224
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,160
We recently completed
a total IT upgrade.

225
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,273
500 miles worth of
high-capacity fiber optics

226
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,192
married to an
underground server farm.

227
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,671
Is something like that
for Applied Sciences?

228
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,317
We had a small
incident there last night.

229
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,879
Very unfortunate.

230
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,675
The police are investigating.

231
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,956
Oh, that's too bad. I
hope no one was hurt.

232
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,433
So do you think it had
anything to do with the, um,

233
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,557
the Dwarf--Dwarf Star Project?

234
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,875
How do you know about that?

235
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,111
Oh, the internet. Heh!

236
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,191
1 didn't know you
had wifi on Lian Yu.

237
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,398
No, no, no. I wish. I stayed
up late at the house last night,

238
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,034
doing my research, catching up.

239
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,318
Well, the press coverage
hasn't been particularly kind.

240
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,397
Everyone wants to make
the Dwarf Star Project

241
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,278
out to be something sinister,

242
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,598
but it's just an alternative
energy source project,

243
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,398
completely benign.

244
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,077
I suppose everything's
a matter of interpretation.

245
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,279
Now, do you think that
someone could show me

246
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,839
to the most important
room on this tour?

247
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,519
And, uh, what would that be?

248
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,473
The bathroom.

249
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,555
It's supposed to be red.

250
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,670
Excuse me.

251
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,391
Nothing. Sorry. I'm
looking for Felicity Smoak.

252
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,638
Ha ha! Like Felicity
Smoak would slum it in IT

253
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,154
instead of running Smoak tech.

254
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,470
0h, good for her. Sorry.

255
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,036
Who does run the IT department?

256
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,160
There you are.

257
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,189
Malcolm Merlyn, you
have failed this city.

258
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,869
I--I--don't know what
you think I did, but I--

259
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,310
Aah!

260
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,633
-0h, God.
-Get out of here!

261
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,755
Oh, no.

262
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,070
So that's your story.

263
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,474
An archer in black flew
in and attacked The Hood.

264
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,070
Hmm?

265
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,159
Well, who is he?
Why did he do that?

266
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,756
1 don't know. Find
him, and you ask.

267
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,431
First there was an attack
on Applied Sciences.

268
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,519
Now there's a war between
two masks in your own office.

269
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,670
And your point, Sergeant?

270
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,593
My point is that I highly
doubt this is a coincidence.

271
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,239
Well, obviously not.

272
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,679
Somebody is clearly
targeting my father's company.

273
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,033
Right. Except
from his statement,

274
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,759
your father claimed The Hood

275
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,155
was targeting him.

276
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,229
It's funny. He doesn't
usually go after the good guys.

277
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,517
All right. Interview's over.

278
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,353
Anything else you
need, Sergeant Drake,

279
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,189
you can either go through
me or Mr. Merlyn's attorney.

280
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,478
Perfect. I needed
something to look forward to.

281
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,709
She's got a point.

282
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,951
It's a lot of drama
for the past 24 hours.

283
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,634
Maybe we should reconsider
Oliver's welcome home party.

284
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,473
No, no, no, no.
It'll just look like

285
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,994
we're trying to
cover something up.

286
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,919
Yeah. And I missed tequila.

287
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,470
Oliver.

288
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,393
I want you to meet John Diggle.

289
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,837
He'll be accompanying
you from now on.

290
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,438
Er--no. Sorry. No. I don't
need a babysitter, Mom.

291
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,520
No, this is
something that I need.

292
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,870
Yeah.

293
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,278
So what do I call you?

294
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,756
Diggle. Dig if you want.

295
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,036
Sorry, Oliver. Fool me once.

296
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,878
- How did you find me?
John] It wasn't easy.

297
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,117
It was like you disappeared
off the face of the Earth...

298
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,511
until Felicity figured out
that it was only our Earth.

299
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,837
Still, John, it's not like
you can just charter a jet.

300
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,115
Cisco let me borrow it.

301
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,154
And now if I'm done
answering your questions,

302
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,355
I have a few of my own.

303
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,272
Can't talk about
it. Can't or won't?

304
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,555
You know, Oliver,
it's interesting

305
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,233
that we're revisiting
when we first met.

306
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,676
You going at it all
alone is like deja vu.

307
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,070
I thought you and
I were past that.

308
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,835
This is new. It's bigger.

309
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,674
And I'm not going to ask
you to take the risk it involves.

310
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,638
Oliver, that's the thing
about being brothers.

311
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,800
You never, ever have to ask.

312
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,874
Can you just believe me
when I tell you this is different?

313
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,074
Yeah. Felicity told
me. Some godlike being

314
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,915
talking about the
end of the universe?

315
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,473
What didn't she tell me, Oliver?

316
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,678
A crisis is coming, John.

317
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,954
He's seen what happens.

318
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,473
He's watched me die.

319
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,873
Thank you for not making
a fuss about coming back in.

320
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,630
I wouldn't want
you and your friends

321
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,870
to miss out on the party.

322
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,515
Don't engage the Deathstrokes.

323
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,710
They're a distraction.

324
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,353
Guys! No one
listens to the tech guy.

325
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,554
Fine. I guess I'll do it.

326
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,434
William.

327
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,790
You okay?

328
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,150
Yeah. Mia, you okay?

329
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,910
They took Vasquez.

330
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,673
The Deathstroke gang.

331
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,109
Screw them.

332
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,714
Who's the one
playing security guard?

333
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,270
He knew who I was.

334
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,750
He knows who we all are.

335
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,910
What? How?

336
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,875
He's my brother.

337
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,397
I Balla per me...?

338
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,754
I We learn to dance;

339
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,992
I But we're swimming
in a black hole ;

340
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,869
I Pretty girl in
the red dress...

341
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,794
Well, hello. You will
be pleased to hear

342
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,474
that I made sure the bar
was stocked with pinot noir.

343
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,150
I'll be right back.

344
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,158
I Balla per me bimbo bianco }

345
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,512
You know, the
party's back that way.

346
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,200
I don't have time
for this, John.

347
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,430
Oliver...

348
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,555
has it occurred to you that
whatever happens in this crisis

349
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,836
happens because you push
the people closest to you away?

350
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,673
So you're in a forward area.

351
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,959
Somebody throws a grenade
right into the middle of your platoon.

352
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,670
What do you do?

353
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,989
Ijump on iit. I
contain the blast.

354
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,389
That's what I'm doing.

355
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,590
I can't prevent whatever it is
that's going to happen to me,

356
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,640
but I will be damned if I'm
going to put other people at risk.

357
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,713
And I will be damned

358
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,470
if I just let you go gently
into that good night.

359
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,989
Okay.

360
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,229
All right.

361
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,396
You always fall for this move.

362
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,832
Wow. That Lian Yu must
have been one hell of a place...

363
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,389
Oliver.

364
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,439
So were you ever really gone?

365
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,477
Because it looks like
you've been running around

366
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,119
in a certain green hood.

367
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,158
Like you've been running
around in a black one?

368
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,359
Heh. Ah, Ollie, you never should've
gotten yourself involved in this.

369
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,430
Hope I didn't hurt you.

370
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,310
Leave us.

371
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,195
So I've been thinking it over,

372
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,192
and you really were on Lian Yu,

373
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,794
because if you had been here,

374
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,877
you would've been
protecting our sister.

375
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,719
So the question is,

376
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,835
why are you running
around in The Hood's hood?

377
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,913
Doesn't matter. -Yes, it does!

378
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,670
The Hood is running
around this city, thinking that

379
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,992
he's saving it, and
nothing can save it.

380
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,077
You don't understand the cancer

381
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,198
that has taken over this city.

382
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,635
Oh, my God. This
is the Undertaking.

383
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,109
You stole the dwarf star
particles because you want...

384
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,593
to destroy the Glades and
get vengeance for Thea.

385
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,754
How could you know that?

386
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,599
And what happened
to you on that island?

387
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,714
What happened to you
while I was on the island?

388
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:12,312
While you were gone,
this city has been rotting.

389
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,040
It can't be saved!

390
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,835
That's not true, Tommy.

391
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,273
I have seen Starling
City come back

392
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,953
from darker moments than this.

393
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,190
It can be redeemed.
You can be redeemed.

394
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,796
You don't understand
what I've seen.

395
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,272
You don't know how
I found our sister.

396
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,391
Every time I close my eyes, I
see her body lying there, cold,

397
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,470
on a dirty floor.

398
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,238
So I swore that I would get
vengeance on the Glades

399
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,834
for what it did to Thea,

400
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,992
and I am not going to
let her down. Not again!

401
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,958
That's not gonna make
you feel better, Tommy.

402
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,316
I don't care about
feeling better.

403
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,311
I just want the
Glades to suffer.

404
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,754
You're a better man than this.

405
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,470
That was a different me.

406
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,194
Good-bye, Oliver.

407
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,915
Tonight was a disaster.

408
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,070
You mean you were.

409
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,277
♪ never would've gotten past us
if you hadn't abandoned your post.

410
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,714
Oh, you think this is my fault?

411
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,473
What I think is that you
need to stop going rogue

412
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,114
and start acting like
you're part of this team.

413
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,238
Hey, guys, can we save
it for the Deathstrokes?

414
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,596
Speaking of your evil brother
and his masked maniacs,

415
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,398
we're gonna talk
about that, right?

416
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,871
Wrong. What do you got?

417
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,351
Nothing good. Ever since we
brought down the wall, your broth--

418
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,751
the Deathstroke gang has
really upped their game.

419
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,275
They've amassed more territory
and power than ever before.

420
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,510
Unintended consequences.

421
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,910
Yeah. But that doesn't explain
why they went after Vasquez.

422
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,952
Vasquez is one of the
Glades' wealthiest citizens.

423
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,232
Maybe the Deathstrokes
plan to extort him.

424
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,073
Yeah, that or they're
planning to ransom him off.

425
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,356
Either way, this guy's screwed
if we don't find him soon.

426
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,555
Way ahead of you.

427
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,438
Satellite imaging indicates
that the Deathstrokes

428
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,637
have assumed control of the
old Galaxy One headquarters.

429
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,955
It could be where
they're holding Vasquez.

430
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,793
If he's even still alive.

431
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,873
There's only one way
to find out. Suit up.

432
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,474
Let me guess. When Mom and 0.G.
Team Arrow anointed us version 2.0,

433
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,995
you expected things to
go a little better, right?

434
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,313
I'm sure they had
their growing pains, too.

435
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,829
I know that working

436
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,559
and playing well
with others is still

437
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,758
a new concept for
you, but do you think

438
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,196
you could just follow
Connor's lead this one time?

439
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,600
I mean, the guy is a
Knightwatch agent.

440
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,478
He eats, sleeps, and
breathes tactical operations.

441
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,358
Yeah. And our target
is his own brother.

442
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,314
I believe that fate brought the
four of us together for a reason

443
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,475
just like it did our parents

444
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,313
when they decided
to save this city.

445
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,910
Now it's our turn.

446
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,109
We don't want to
mess it up, do we?

447
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,830
How'd you find me?

448
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,753
-Tracking your shoe. Really?

449
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,910
Just kidding. That
was the way I found you

450
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,195
last time this
happened, remember?

451
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,676
Yeah. Yeah. It's not the only
history that's repeating itself.

452
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,876
Tommy's planning his
very own Undertaking.

453
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,960
Don't worry. We'll stop him.

454
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,955
John, I appreciate the assist,

455
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,559
but I still have to
do this on my own.

456
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,631
Right, because you think
you have to die, right?

457
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,989
No. I know I'm gonna die.

458
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,753
And I know that I don't
have to accept that.

459
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,074
If I let you help me, you will
get hurt or you will get killed.

460
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,514
And it will be because of me.

461
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,557
You don't know
that. «I do know that.

462
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,392
Because everyone else in
my life is either dead or alone.

463
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,197
Look at the Earth that we're on.

464
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,994
I've been gone 12 years.

465
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,390
My mother's alive.
Tommy's alive.

466
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,590
Laurel's alive.

467
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,315
Thea is dead.

468
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,433
And, yes, Tommy's alive.

469
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,959
But he's trying another Undertaking
with Rene and Dinah helping,

470
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,511
who, if you haven't noticed,
are very bad people here.

471
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,193
Oliver, this world isn't better.

472
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,555
It's much, much worse.

473
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,029
You know why?

474
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,869
Because you weren't in it.

475
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,075
I've known you long enough to
know I can't talk you out of this.

476
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,954
You better have a good plan.

477
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,396
Oh, look who it is, and
you brought a friend

478
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,034
to my secret bunker.

479
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,390
I've been here before.

480
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,749
Oh, great. You're here, too.

481
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,038
Uh, Adrian, this is John Diggle.

482
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,350
He's my...bodyguard.

483
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,909
You need a bodyguard?

484
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,680
He's not a bodyguard.

485
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,714
And I thought you
didn't need our help.

486
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,993
I've been wrong before. The Dark
Archer stole dwarf star particles

487
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,272
and is planning to use them
to level the Glades tonight.

488
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,475
And you know that how?

489
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,630
Because I was just with him.

490
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,272
Tommy Merlyn is the Dark Archer.

491
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,030
Are you sure?

492
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,796
He blames the Glades
for what happened to Thea.

493
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,596
If you wanted to level
an entire neighborhood,

494
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,074
how would you do it?

495
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,994
I'd use an Earthquake machine.

496
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,151
That sounds like
science fiction to me.

497
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,520
And Merlyn stole
dwarf star particles,

498
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,399
which would make
for a very real weapon.

499
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,634
Overlaying the blast radius
with a map of the Glades

500
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,871
should allow us to
pinpoint its optimal location.

501
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,080
He's like you, Curtis, and
Felicity all rolled up in one.

502
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,669
I could only narrow it
down to 4 square blocks.

503
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,753
So we split up, find it on foot.

504
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,831
No, we don't. Thea
died in the Glades.

505
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,678
We find out where,
we find Tommy.

506
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,069
What are you, some
kind of psychic?

507
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,151
Maybe I'm just 10
steps ahead of you.

508
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,000
4587 Burke,

509
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,231
favorite hangout of the
Glades' worst drug dealers.

510
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,515
Good. That's where we head.

511
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,155
Suit up.

512
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,992
Tommy could be anywhere inside.

513
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,720
Start at the ground
floor. Work our way up.

514
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,710
Let's do this.

515
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,114
You should've
stayed on that island.

516
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,438
Back on my Earth, you
had a better teacher.

517
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,314
You don't have to do this.

518
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,519
I was thinking the same thing.

519
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,429
This is not what Thea
would have wanted.

520
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,991
That's funny. You know
what she used to say?

521
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,954
The dead don't want anything.

522
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,430
It's one of the
benefits of being dead.

523
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,994
Tommy.

524
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,075
You can't. If's encrypted
by my personal code.

525
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,914
You can't break it in time.

526
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,030
You can.

527
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,917
I know how devastating
it must have been

528
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,960
to lose Thea because
we're only as good

529
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,915
as the people we
have in our lives.

530
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,557
I lost people, too, Tommy.

531
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,554
lost people closer to me

532
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,279
than I could possibly
explain to you.

533
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,992
Every one of those losses
brings with it a choice

534
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,437
between darkness and light.

535
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,633
Make the right choice.

536
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,120
Are you gonna kill
thousands of innocent people,

537
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,751
or are you gonna be
the man I know you are?

538
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,351
That was a pretty good speech.

539
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:34,231
As agreed. The dwarf star
particles that power Merlyn's weapon.

540
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,710
Thank you.

541
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,712
And now you're gonna tell me
what you're gonna do with them?

542
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,430
Not destroy a city. Don't worry.

543
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,591
You're from a parallel
universe, aren't you?

544
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,873
The Hood from another reality?

545
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,310
How did you know that?

546
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,075
Bruce Wayne once told me that
if you eliminate the impossible,

547
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,234
whatever remains, however
improbable, must be the truth.

548
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,674
Well, as The Hood
from a parallel universe,

549
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,989
may I offer you some advice?

550
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,760
Change "The Hood"
to Green Arrow.

551
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,110
Trust me.

552
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,799
Why do I get the
sense that you guys

553
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,713
won't be sticking
around for a victory drink?

554
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,269
We have to get back
home to our Earth.

555
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,951
This city's lucky to
have a hero like you in it.

556
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,719
Wow. That might be the nicest
thing you've ever said to me.

557
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,635
Thank you.

558
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,034
You take care of yourself...

559
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,750
both of you.

560
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,910
You okay?

561
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,229
I'm alive.

562
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,954
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

563
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,838
Well, it's a
temporary thing, John.

564
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,195
Oliver, you don't know that.

565
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,392
And I don't know this
Monitor, but what I do know,

566
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,434
that no one's fate is sealed.

567
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,511
-He saw me die.
«In the future...

568
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,751
which means we
can still prevent this.

569
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,955
Oliver, you're
not alone in this.

570
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,439
Well, not anymore.

571
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,510
Thanks for having my back.

572
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,877
Always. Now, can we go home now?

573
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,031
Just one more thing 1 got to do.

574
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,954
We'd better find Vasquez fast.

575
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,235
Where to, William?

576
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,993
Top floor, southwest
corner office.

577
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,798
And JJ's got at least 4 friends.

578
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,598
The second I walk through
that door, JJ's gonna try

579
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,080
to run a sword through my chest.

580
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,913
But that should keep
him occupied long enough

581
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,593
for you to rescue Vasquez.

582
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,956
Whoa. You're using
yourself as bait?

583
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,753
Yeah. And it'll
work, too. Trust me.

584
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,872
Whatever you
want, I'l give it to you.

585
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,430
Please stop.

586
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,110
The codes.

587
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,155
This better be everything.

588
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,391
Itis. I swear.

589
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,150
Okay.

590
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,794
What's up, JJ?

591
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,434
Miss me? Kill his ass.

592
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,310
Come on. Let's
get you out of here.

593
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,598
You think that you
can save this city?

594
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,231
1 got news for you.
1 own this city now.

595
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,355
I am so sorry, okay?
I underestimated him.

596
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,954
It will never happen again.

597
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,151
No, it won't,
because from now on,

598
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,799
we're gonna do things my way.

599
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,310
Hey.

600
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,629
You okay?

601
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,595
I don't know.

602
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,631
I haven't known
anything since Thea died.

603
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,270
I understand that.

604
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,755
I don't know, Ollie.

605
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,829
Just I--I can't
shake this feeling...

606
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,755
that our sister would
still be alive if you had--

607
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,397
if you'd just been here.

608
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,833
I've made my own mistakes.

609
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,472
Oh, God.

610
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,670
Tommy, are you ok?

611
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,509
Don't worry. We're
gonna get you out of here.

612
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,994
I am so sorry.

613
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,190
I have to go.

614
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,830
Mom?

615
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,555
Bye, mom.

616
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,315
I'love you.

617
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,870
I love you, too.

618
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,590
Hey.

619
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,879
I'll see you at the house.

620
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,070
Okay.

621
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,114
-All good?
-Let's go home.

622
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,910
What's going on?

623
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,077
My computer went down!

624
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,033
Oh, good. You're still here.

625
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,430
What's going on?

626
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,749
The city's under attack.

627
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,910
By who?

628
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,037
We have to get
the hell out of here.

629
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,474
- And go where?
- Home. Cisco's device.

630
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,357
Oliver? “Mom?

631
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,395
Dig, you got to go. Go now!

632
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,235
What's happening?

633
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,593
Oliver? Oliver!

634
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,315
Laurel, come on.

635
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,839
Greg, move your head.
