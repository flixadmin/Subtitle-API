You're right.

331
00:28:09,736 --> 00:28:12,307
My motivations are entirely impure.

332
00:28:21,256 --> 00:28:22,940
Doesn't make me wrong.

333
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:31,825
You told me yourself
I can't fight enemies within and without.

334
00:28:31,896 --> 00:28:36,379
So when enemies without come knocking,
I need the city of Meereen behind me.

335
00:28:36,456 --> 00:28:37,867
I have no choice.

336
00:28:38,896 --> 00:28:40,261
Everyone has a choice.

337
00:28:40,616 --> 00:28:42,300
Even slaves have a choice,

338
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:43,941
death or slavery.

339
00:28:44,536 --> 00:28:46,425
So what else can I do, hmm?

340
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:49,861
Marry me instead.

341
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:56,023
Even if I wanted to do
such an inadvisable thing,

342
00:28:57,536 --> 00:28:59,379
- I couldn't.
- Why not?

343
00:29:00,096 --> 00:29:02,064
You are queen. You can do what you like.

344
00:29:04,296 --> 00:29:07,266
No, I can't.

345
00:29:07,936 --> 00:29:10,746
Then you are the only person in Meereen
who's not free.

346
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:25,625
And I know I'm here to serve my queen
and not give advice,

347
00:29:26,936 --> 00:29:28,779
but can I make one more suggestion?

348
00:29:32,696 --> 00:29:33,697
Of course.

349
00:29:37,616 --> 00:29:39,345
On the day of the great games,

350
00:29:40,216 --> 00:29:45,143
gather all the Great Masters and Wise
Masters and Worthy Masters you can find,

351
00:29:46,416 --> 00:29:47,781
and slaughter them all.

352
00:29:51,496 --> 00:29:54,943
I am a queen, not a butcher.

353
00:29:59,736 --> 00:30:02,819
All rulers are either butchers or meat.

354
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:12,463
OLENNA: You there.

355
00:30:12,696 --> 00:30:16,417
Where would I find
the High Septon, or High Sparrow,

356
00:30:16,496 --> 00:30:18,578
or whatever bloody fool name he's got?

357
00:30:19,016 --> 00:30:21,906
It's not as good a name as Queen of Thorns,
I'll admit.

358
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:28,100
You should have the decency
to stand when you speak to a lady.

359
00:30:28,176 --> 00:30:30,417
You should have the decency
to kneel before the gods.

360
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:32,546
Don't spar with me, little fellow.

361
00:30:33,576 --> 00:30:34,577
(GROANS)

362
00:30:36,016 --> 00:30:38,383
For me, it's the knees.

363
00:30:38,856 --> 00:30:40,585
- You?
- Hips.

364
00:30:41,096 --> 00:30:42,097
Ah.

365
00:30:42,656 --> 00:30:46,547
A man of the people. Is that your game?

366
00:30:46,816 --> 00:30:50,423
It's an old game. Dull and unconvincing.

367
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:51,947
A man of the people

368
00:30:52,616 --> 00:30:55,267
who does Cersei's dirty work for her.

369
00:30:56,296 --> 00:30:58,298
The people always do the dirty work.

370
00:30:58,376 --> 00:31:01,505
Spare me the homilies.
I can smell a fraud from a mile away.

371
00:31:01,816 --> 00:31:02,977
Useful talent.

372
00:31:03,056 --> 00:31:05,900
I'm here for my grandson and granddaughter.

373
00:31:06,016 --> 00:31:10,783
Your grandson and granddaughter
swore sacred vows and lied.

374
00:31:11,816 --> 00:31:14,057
The Father judges us all.

375
00:31:14,496 --> 00:31:17,818
Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen.

376
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:21,500
If you break his laws,
you will be punished.

377
00:31:23,056 --> 00:31:24,501
Don't you walk away from me.

378
00:31:24,576 --> 00:31:26,704
You don't give commands here.

379
00:31:26,776 --> 00:31:28,221
What is it you want?

380
00:31:28,896 --> 00:31:30,136
Gold?

381
00:31:30,576 --> 00:31:33,341
I'll make you the richest septon
who ever lived.

382
00:31:33,536 --> 00:31:34,537
(CHUCKLES)

383
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,182
What, then?

384
00:31:37,456 --> 00:31:39,424
I imagine this is strange for you.

385
00:31:40,496 --> 00:31:45,502
Everyone you meet has a hidden motive,
and you pride yourself on sniffing it out.

386
00:31:46,776 --> 00:31:48,585
But I'm telling you a simple truth.

387
00:31:49,096 --> 00:31:50,621
I serve the gods.

388
00:31:50,896 --> 00:31:52,819
The gods demand justice.

389
00:31:53,096 --> 00:31:55,383
How do they communicate their demands?

390
00:31:55,856 --> 00:31:57,062
By raven or horse?

391
00:31:57,136 --> 00:31:59,787
By the holy text, The Seven-Pointed Star.

392
00:32:00,496 --> 00:32:03,898
If you don't have one in your library,
I'll give you my own.

393
00:32:03,976 --> 00:32:06,502
I've read The Seven-Pointed Star.

394
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:10,900
Then you'll remember the passages
concerning buggery and perjury.

395
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,219
Your grandchildren will be punished

396
00:32:13,296 --> 00:32:17,938
in the same manner
as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.

397
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:22,817
Half the men, women, and children
in this foul city break the sacred laws.

398
00:32:23,216 --> 00:32:26,265
You live among murderers,
thieves, and rapists,

399
00:32:26,336 --> 00:32:31,740
and yet you punish Loras
for shagging some perfumed ponce,

400
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,978
and Margaery for defending her brother?

401
00:32:34,136 --> 00:32:35,467
Yes.

402
00:32:35,776 --> 00:32:38,382
The gods' laws must be
applied to all equally.

403
00:32:39,136 --> 00:32:41,184
If it's equality you want, so be it.

404
00:32:41,296 --> 00:32:45,221
When House Tyrell stops sending our crops
to the capital,

405
00:32:45,656 --> 00:32:47,499
everyone here will starve.

406
00:32:48,256 --> 00:32:50,577
And I'll make sure
the hungry know who's to blame.

407
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:52,062
(CHUCKLES)

408
00:32:53,896 --> 00:32:56,467
Have you ever sowed the field?

409
00:32:58,736 --> 00:33:00,306
Have you ever reaped the grain?

410
00:33:01,976 --> 00:33:03,501
Has anyone in House Tyrell?

411
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:08,498
A lifetime of wealth and power
has left you blind in one eye.

412
00:33:10,696 --> 00:33:11,902
You are the few,

413
00:33:13,096 --> 00:33:14,666
we are the many.

414
00:33:16,336 --> 00:33:19,863
And when the many stop fearing the few...

415
00:33:32,256 --> 00:33:33,906
(DOG BARKING)

416
00:33:34,136 --> 00:33:35,422
Lady Olenna.

417
00:33:47,696 --> 00:33:51,257
CERSEI: Starving yourself won't make things
any better for her, my love.

418
00:33:54,456 --> 00:33:59,223
She's in a prison cell,
and there is nothing I can do.

419
00:34:02,896 --> 00:34:04,500
I am the king!

420
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:07,739
The queen is in prison,
and there is nothing I can do!

421
00:34:22,256 --> 00:34:24,145
No matter who you are,

422
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:27,660
no matter how strong you
are, sooner or later,

423
00:34:27,736 --> 00:34:30,342
you'll face circumstances
beyond your control.

424
00:34:30,976 --> 00:34:35,106
Events you couldn't possibly have
anticipated or prevented, even if you had.

425
00:34:35,296 --> 00:34:37,537
You cannot blame yourself for fate.

426
00:34:38,456 --> 00:34:39,867
Your father,

427
00:34:41,096 --> 00:34:42,507
your brother, your grandfather...

428
00:34:42,576 --> 00:34:45,182
I was Queen of the Seven Kingdoms,
and what could I do?

429
00:34:46,016 --> 00:34:47,780
Hold them as they left this world.

430
00:34:48,616 --> 00:34:50,425
Kissed their heads after they'd gone.

431
00:34:51,016 --> 00:34:52,859
I'll call in the army.

432
00:34:52,936 --> 00:34:58,500
I'll take back the sept,
and kill every last one of them.

433
00:35:00,376 --> 00:35:02,743
I'll start a war if I have to.

434
00:35:02,816 --> 00:35:06,263
You know as well as I do who the
first casualty of that war would be.

435
00:35:11,456 --> 00:35:12,662
I love her.

436
00:35:16,336 --> 00:35:17,701
I love her,

437
00:35:20,656 --> 00:35:22,101
and I can't help her.

438
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:41,659
We must be strong for those we love.
We cannot give in to despair.

439
00:35:42,416 --> 00:35:44,783
I will speak with the High Sparrow.

440
00:35:45,336 --> 00:35:46,576
There must be something he...

441
00:35:46,656 --> 00:35:48,465
Let me talk to him on your behalf.

442
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:52,863
The king cannot sully himself
negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.

443
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,260
You will try to help her?

444
00:35:56,536 --> 00:35:59,779
I'll do everything I can
to win her freedom and her brother's.

445
00:36:00,016 --> 00:36:02,462
Your happiness is all I want in this world.

446
00:36:04,016 --> 00:36:05,222
I know.

447
00:36:05,536 --> 00:36:07,061
No, you don't.

448
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:12,140
You can't possibly.

449
00:36:14,136 --> 00:36:16,264
Not until you have children of your own.

450
00:36:17,496 --> 00:36:18,986
I would do anything for you.

451
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,140
Anything to keep you from harm.

452
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:27,978
I would burn cities to the ground.

453
00:36:29,936 --> 00:36:31,620
You are all that matters.

454
00:36:33,536 --> 00:36:34,776
You

455
00:36:36,056 --> 00:36:37,296
and your sister.

456
00:36:37,856 --> 00:36:39,699
From the moment you came into this world.

457
00:36:40,896 --> 00:36:42,227
My boy.

458
00:36:45,096 --> 00:36:46,621
My only boy.

(DOOR OPENS)

460
00:37:02,256 --> 00:37:06,545
Prince Doran hopes this satisfies your
concerns about the princess' well-being.

461
00:37:13,576 --> 00:37:14,941
You looked different when I left.

462
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:17,864
You had more hair.

463
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:19,417
And more hands.

464
00:37:21,336 --> 00:37:23,782
- How's Trystane?
- He'll be all right.

465
00:37:23,856 --> 00:37:24,857
I'm sorry for that.

466
00:37:25,056 --> 00:37:26,467
It wasn't supposed to happen that way.

467
00:37:26,816 --> 00:37:28,261
Why is it happening at all?

468
00:37:29,696 --> 00:37:31,619
Your mother's worried about you.

469
00:37:33,456 --> 00:37:36,187
Threats have been made.
Dame's too dangerous for you.

470
00:37:36,536 --> 00:37:38,618
- I've come to take you home.
- This is my home.

471
00:37:38,696 --> 00:37:39,822
This has been my home for years.

472
00:37:40,096 --> 00:37:43,703
I didn't want to come here, but she
told me to. I did what she said.

473
00:37:43,776 --> 00:37:46,541
I did my duty,
and now she's forcing me to go back?

474
00:37:46,616 --> 00:37:49,586
It's for your own good.
These are complicated matters.

475
00:37:49,656 --> 00:37:51,943
No, it's not complicated at all.
It's simple.

476
00:37:52,016 --> 00:37:55,907
I love Trystane, I'm going to marry him,
and we're staying right here.

477
00:37:55,976 --> 00:37:57,740
- I don't understand.
- Of course you don't.

478
00:37:58,216 --> 00:37:59,377
You don't know me.

BRONN: (SINGING) Brothers, oh, brothers,

But what does it matter
For all men must die

He's got a good voice.

We're lucky he's a singer.

If he were a fighter,
we might have been in trouble.

It's against my code to hurt a woman.

490
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:47,539
It's amazing how many men we beat
seem to have this code.

491
00:38:47,656 --> 00:38:49,226
I wouldn't say you beat me.

492
00:38:49,976 --> 00:38:51,023
How's your arm?

493
00:38:51,176 --> 00:38:52,507
Wonderful.

494
00:38:53,336 --> 00:38:55,942
Wouldn't feel right to leave Dorne
without a new scar.

495
00:38:56,616 --> 00:38:58,141
(SCOFFS) You think you're leaving Dorne?

496
00:38:58,616 --> 00:39:00,027
No great hurry.

497
00:39:00,496 --> 00:39:03,022
Dornish women
are the most beautiful women in the world.

498
00:39:03,616 --> 00:39:04,617
Thank you.

499
00:39:04,696 --> 00:39:07,540
I said Dornish women. I didn't say you.

500
00:39:10,256 --> 00:39:12,736
I'm not the most beautiful woman
you've ever seen?

501
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:17,260
BRONN: I've seen quite a few women
in all the Seven Kingdoms.

502
00:39:17,896 --> 00:39:20,581
Name one more beautiful than I am.

503
00:39:22,576 --> 00:39:24,226
Well, now,

504
00:39:24,616 --> 00:39:29,338
in King's Landing,
there was an absolutely gorgeous...

505
00:39:33,936 --> 00:39:35,062
There was a what?

506
00:39:37,736 --> 00:39:39,738
In King's Landing, you were saying?

507
00:39:40,496 --> 00:39:41,543
Was I?

508
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,577
There was a woman more beautiful than I am.

509
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:47,427
Was there?

510
00:39:47,736 --> 00:39:49,898
My memory's not what it was earlier.

511
00:39:53,576 --> 00:39:54,737
How's your arm now?

512
00:39:55,256 --> 00:39:56,587
You seem concerned with it.

513
00:39:57,096 --> 00:39:58,586
You must really like me.

514
00:39:58,696 --> 00:39:59,857
(LAUGHS)

515
00:40:07,376 --> 00:40:09,856
And how about your head?

516
00:40:14,856 --> 00:40:16,506
My head.

517
00:40:17,256 --> 00:40:18,701
My head?

518
00:40:19,656 --> 00:40:22,466
You don't even want to know
what's going on in...

519
00:40:24,016 --> 00:40:25,302
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

520
00:40:32,616 --> 00:40:34,141
Your nose is bleeding.

521
00:40:37,456 --> 00:40:40,141
It's nothing. It's the dry air.

522
00:40:43,616 --> 00:40:46,904
My dagger was coated
with a special ointment from Asshai.

523
00:40:48,056 --> 00:40:49,785
They call it the Long Farewell.

524
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:51,987
It takes time to work,

525
00:40:52,776 --> 00:40:56,576
but if a single drop
makes contact with the skin,

526
00:40:56,656 --> 00:40:57,657
death.

527
00:41:06,136 --> 00:41:07,979
The only antidote.

528
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:15,417
Who's the most
beautiful woman in the world?

529
00:41:16,856 --> 00:41:18,187
(QUIETLY) You.

530
00:41:19,976 --> 00:41:21,501
Sorry? Who?

531
00:41:24,016 --> 00:41:25,017
You.

532
00:41:26,976 --> 00:41:29,343
Don't drop it.

533
00:41:39,176 --> 00:41:41,144
(GASPING)

534
00:41:43,096 --> 00:41:45,098
I think you're very handsome as well.

535
00:42:30,096 --> 00:42:32,542
- I'm sorry about the locale.
- No, you're not.

536
00:42:35,496 --> 00:42:36,907
It felt like the safest place.

537
00:42:37,496 --> 00:42:39,658
Not for your clientele, clearly.

538
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:42,737
It was an establishment like no other.

539
00:42:44,096 --> 00:42:46,098
The sheer range of appetites catered to.

540
00:42:46,376 --> 00:42:48,105
Desires that didn't even exist

541
00:42:49,096 --> 00:42:50,586
until we invented them.

542
00:42:51,096 --> 00:42:54,100
You've always been rather impressed
with yourself, haven't you?

543
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,101
The past is the past.

544
00:42:58,456 --> 00:43:01,858
The future is all that's worth discussing.

545
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:04,981
The future of House Tyrell.

546
00:43:05,136 --> 00:43:07,707
Don't pretend to have any concern
for my house,

547
00:43:07,776 --> 00:43:09,505
my grandchildren, or me.

548
00:43:10,136 --> 00:43:12,025
I should have known
you'd return to the capital

549
00:43:12,096 --> 00:43:14,622
as soon as things started to go wrong.

550
00:43:14,696 --> 00:43:16,903
- I promise you...
- I promise you, Lord Baelish,

551
00:43:17,336 --> 00:43:18,826
that our fates are joined.

552
00:43:19,216 --> 00:43:20,706
Together we murdered a king.

553
00:43:21,216 --> 00:43:24,265
If my house should fall,
I will have nothing to hide.

554
00:43:25,576 --> 00:43:31,583
And if I should meet with some accident
here at your broken little flesh market,

555
00:43:32,536 --> 00:43:35,062
they'll never even find what's left of you.

556
00:43:36,296 --> 00:43:37,661
So...

557
00:43:38,336 --> 00:43:39,986
Do you deny a part in all this?

558
00:43:40,656 --> 00:43:43,227
Cersei summoned me to King's Landing.

559
00:43:43,936 --> 00:43:45,017
I dared not refuse her.

560
00:43:45,296 --> 00:43:46,946
And what did she want?

561
00:43:47,056 --> 00:43:49,662
A piece of information she knew that I had.

562
00:43:50,216 --> 00:43:53,140
Neither silence nor lies were an option.

563
00:43:54,136 --> 00:43:55,581
But I have other information

564
00:43:56,496 --> 00:43:57,861
of which she is unaware.

565
00:43:59,376 --> 00:44:02,220
And as you say, our interests are aligned.

566
00:44:04,456 --> 00:44:05,742
I have a gift for you.

567
00:44:06,376 --> 00:44:07,707
What kind Of gift?

568
00:44:08,056 --> 00:44:09,706
The same kind I gave Cersei.

569
00:44:11,496 --> 00:44:12,941
A handsome young man.

570
00:44:27,176 --> 00:44:31,659
YEZZAN: Many worthy fighters have died
trying to make it to the great games.

571
00:44:32,376 --> 00:44:35,346
When most of you worthless scum
join them in death this afternoon,

572
00:44:35,416 --> 00:44:38,340
it will represent a significant rise
in your station.

573
00:44:38,816 --> 00:44:41,581
But if you do happen to triumph here,

574
00:44:41,656 --> 00:44:45,900
you will fight at the Great Pit of
Daznak itself, in front of the queen.

575
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:49,862
So whatever happens,
the gods have smiled upon you today.

576
00:44:50,616 --> 00:44:54,701
This is the day your lives
actually start to mean something.

577
00:44:57,216 --> 00:44:59,264
You and you. You.

578
00:45:01,296 --> 00:45:02,457
You two.

579
00:45:04,896 --> 00:45:06,261
You, you, and you.

580
00:45:07,536 --> 00:45:08,742

Prepare yourselves.

583
00:45:26,736 --> 00:45:29,137
Sitting through the great games
will be bad enough.

584
00:45:29,216 --> 00:45:32,106
For generations,
in the days leading up to the great games,

585
00:45:32,216 --> 00:45:35,584
it has been customary for our ruler
to make the rounds of the lower pits

586
00:45:35,656 --> 00:45:37,977
to pay the fighters there
the honor of her presence.

You honor us all.

Stand there.

593
00:46:01,616 --> 00:46:03,778
Stand straight. That's the fucking queen.

for the queen to stay

We did everything we could
from the moment they took your brother.

But I fear the Faith has
left reason behind.

you're not very good at those, I'm afraid.

Perhaps that's why your son was
so eager to cast you aside for me.

645
00:51:20,976 --> 00:51:22,262
You're upset.

646
00:51:23,016 --> 00:51:24,620
You're not thinking clearly.

647
00:51:25,256 --> 00:51:27,463
I'll visit again when you've had a chance
to calm down.

648
00:51:27,616 --> 00:51:29,539
I don't want to see you again.

Leave.

653
00:51:44,456 --> 00:51:45,742
Yes.

654
00:51:46,496 --> 00:51:49,784
I'm afraid I must.
My son needs me now more than ever.

655
00:51:50,576 --> 00:51:52,419
Get out, you hateful bitch!

661
00:52:36,496 --> 00:52:37,577
Thank you, Boake.

662
00:52:45,056 --> 00:52:46,546
- You saw her?
- Yes.

663
00:52:47,016 --> 00:52:49,223
- And?
- Her accommodations seem sufficient.

664
00:52:49,296 --> 00:52:50,502
What happens to her now?

665
00:52:51,856 --> 00:52:55,383
Well, she and her brother are both
being held under fair suspicion.

666
00:52:56,096 --> 00:53:01,387
A trial will be held for each of them
to determine if they're guilty of any acts

667
00:53:01,456 --> 00:53:05,177
that might constitute
a violation of the tenets of the faith.

Who will stand judge?

669
00:53:07,096 --> 00:53:11,306
Seven septons, as it was in all trials
before the Targaryens.

670
00:53:12,696 --> 00:53:13,857
Will you be one of them?

671
00:53:14,536 --> 00:53:15,901
I will.

672
00:53:17,896 --> 00:53:22,299
If one or both of them were to
confess before the trial...

673
00:53:22,376 --> 00:53:24,140
Then they will be shown the Mother's mercy.

674
00:53:25,416 --> 00:53:27,384
And what does the Mother's mercy entail?

675
00:53:28,376 --> 00:53:30,344
It depends upon the situation.

676
00:53:30,856 --> 00:53:33,666
The acts themselves, the
degree of contrition.

677
00:53:33,736 --> 00:53:35,579
Thank you, High Septon,

678
00:53:36,616 --> 00:53:39,096
for bringing them
whatever justice they deserve

679
00:53:40,416 --> 00:53:41,781
in the eyes of the Seven.

680
00:53:46,496 --> 00:53:49,181
Did you know this chapel is
one of the oldest structures

681
00:53:49,256 --> 00:53:50,382
in King's Landing?

682
00:53:52,216 --> 00:53:53,980
I think I may have heard at one point.

683
00:53:54,656 --> 00:53:56,704
Baelor built his sept around it.

684
00:53:58,696 --> 00:54:01,176
But men worshipped here long before him.

685
00:54:02,456 --> 00:54:04,026
Who carved this altar?

686
00:54:04,976 --> 00:54:06,944
- Do you know?
- I'm afraid I don't.

687
00:54:08,336 --> 00:54:09,747
No one does.

688
00:54:10,616 --> 00:54:13,938
There's no name on it,
or anywhere else in the chapel.

689
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:18,338
No, the people who built this place

690
00:54:18,776 --> 00:54:22,303
didn't inflict their vanity
on those who came after them,

691
00:54:22,896 --> 00:54:26,821
the way Baelor did with that great
gilded monstrosity up there.

692
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:27,897
Hmm.

693
00:54:28,456 --> 00:54:30,106
Their faith was clean.

694
00:54:31,776 --> 00:54:34,461
Strip away the gold and the ornaments,

695
00:54:35,296 --> 00:54:37,503
knock down the statues and the pillars,

696
00:54:38,576 --> 00:54:40,101
and this is what remains.

697

solid, and true.

699
00:54:57,336 --> 00:55:00,419
The Tyrells' finery will be stripped away.

700
00:55:01,416 --> 00:55:05,978
Their lies knocked down.
Their true hearts laid bare for all to see.

701
00:55:07,936 --> 00:55:09,745
And so it will be for all of us.

702
00:55:10,696 --> 00:55:12,778
High and low alike.

703

What will We find

704
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,183
when we strip away your finery?

705
00:55:25,696 --> 00:55:28,427
A young man came to us not long ago,

706
00:55:29,776 --> 00:55:31,619
broken in body and spirit.

707
00:55:34,176 --> 00:55:36,338
He had so much to strip away.

708
00:55:38,416 --> 00:55:40,180
So much weighing him down.

709
00:55:42,056 --> 00:55:45,219
But piece by piece, he unburdened himself.

710
00:55:46,656 --> 00:55:48,226
Let go of vanity,

711
00:55:48,856 --> 00:55:50,938
pride, sin.

712
00:55:53,736 --> 00:55:55,625
Now his soul is so light,

713
00:55:56,376 --> 00:55:59,585
he will float through
the seven heavens like a bird.

714
00:55:59,976 --> 00:56:00,977
Hmm.

715
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:08,863
And he has much to say about you.

Are you out of your mind?

I am the queen! Let me go!

Look at me.

727
00:57:08,056 --> 00:57:09,501
Look at my face.
