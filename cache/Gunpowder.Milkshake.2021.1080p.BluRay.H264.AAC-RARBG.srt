1
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:28,950
There's a group of men called "the firm".

2
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:34,205
They've been running things
for a long, long time.

3
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:41,328
And when they need someone to clean up
their mess, they send me.

4
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,572
- Sam.
- Nathan.

5
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:46,114
- Where are you?
- At home. Sewing.

6
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,615
Meet me at the diner.

7
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:52,282
Why?

8
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,957
How much trouble am lin?

9
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,790
An extra scoop for my favourite client.

10
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:05,990
Thanks, Rose.

11
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:16,415
15 years earlier

12
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,116
I put in an extra scoop
for my favourite client.

13
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:22,826
- Thanks, Rose.
- I'm sure she won't be long.

14
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:26,700
You clearly don't know
my mother very well.

15
00:03:40,042 --> 00:03:42,658
Hey, stranger. Can I lighten your load?

16
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,115
I'm not carrying today, Rose.

17
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,914
Guess there's a first time for everything.

18
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,447
- She's over there.
- Thanks for keeping an eye on her.

19
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,824
You said you'd be here in 30 minutes.

20
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:17,373
I'm a few minutes late.

21
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:19,577
Three hours.

22
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,618
You're bleeding.

23
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,040
Just another day at the office.
Did you bring it?

24
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:44,081
- Anna may sure can pick them.
- It's loaded.

25
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:45,407
Good girl.

26
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:53,125
Listen, I have to disappear for a while.

27
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:57,072
- Then I'm coming with you.
- You can't. Not this time.

28
00:04:57,792 --> 00:05:01,114
Nathan will be here soon.
He'll take care of you while I'm gone.

29
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:04,041
- I don't want to go with Nathan.
- I'm doing this for your own good.

30
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,867
I'll stay in the library with Anna may
and the others.

31
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,789
It's too dangerous.

32
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,831
What's going on?

33
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:21,242
- It's complicated.
- Tell me. I'm not a kid any more.

34
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,831
No, you're not.

35
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,290
You haven't touched your milkshake.

36
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,290
I didn't wanna drink it without you.

37
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:20,033
How long will you be gone?

38
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,665
I have to make a quick phone call.

39
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,081
Stay here.

40
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:44,748
Evening, gentlemen.
Can I lighten your load?

41
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,619
- Get lost.
- Hey.

42
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,164
Hello, little girl.

43
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:23,750
Mommy says I'm not allowed to talk
to strangers.

44
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:28,656
This mommy. Looks a lot like you?

45
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:36,576
Only bigger and more stabby?
Got my father's blood all over her?

46
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,914
I don't like you.

47
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:55,160
Enough games. Where is she?

48
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:58,623
Go kiss a pig.

49
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:07,161
Tell me where she is.

50
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:14,998
Close your eyes, baby girl.

51
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:36,875
Mom!

52
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:31,998
Evening, darling. Can I lighten your load?

53
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,950
- I'm clean.
- Regular clean or diner clean?

54
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,825
- Forgot about this one.
- Course you did, sugar.

55
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:58,790
Boy. These girls are worse than the stasi.

56
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,163
You hurt?

57
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:07,035
- Just another day at the office.
- Wow. You sound just like your mother.

58
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:12,698
- I don't have a mother.
- Well, you sure have her temper.

59
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:17,200
- What the hell happened tonight?
- Bad intel.

60
00:10:17,292 --> 00:10:20,250
You said four or five idiots
with peashooters.

61
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,664
Yes. And?

62
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,286
For Christ's sake, child.

63
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:34,659
This was supposed to be a low-profile gig,
not a bloody massacre.

64
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:39,289
- Next time I'll just let them shoot me.
- Next time just do what you're told.

65
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,325
Remember who you're working for.
As long as they're happy...

66
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:47,909
And you called me here, oh, so urgently,
just to remind me of that.

67
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,331
No.

68
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:54,578
Your talents are needed pronto.

69
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,120
Somebody stole from us.

70
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,370
Who's crazy enough to steal from the firm?

71
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:05,700
Somebody who doesn't know
who we really are. An accountant.

72
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:07,999
From the clean side of the business.

73
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:11,951
- How much did he take?
- Enough to earn a visit from you.

74
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:13,327
We need that money back.

75
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,242
Good girl. I'll text the address later.

76
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:22,409
And get rid of those stone age
firearms you carry.

77
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,956
But I've had them for years.

78
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:27,409
Find an open vendor and get yourself
some clean boomsticks.

79
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:31,785
We can't have you linked to that war zone
you left behind, now, can we?

80
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,413
Did you know about this little endeavour
my son had on the side?

81
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:54,117
Sorry, uncle. I had no idea.

82
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:20,623
Where's the shoe?

83
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:22,907
What shoe?

84
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,697
The shoe that is not currently covering
my son's left foot.

85
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:30,330
The one that looks exactly like its twin,
the right one. That fucking shoe.

86
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,033
- I don't know.
- Well, find it.

87
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,491
Found it, mr mcalester.

88
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:06,287
Nobody tells his mother about this.

89
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,870
We'll tell her he ran off with some girl.

90
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,244
I get it.

91
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,575
Now bring me the heads of the men
who killed my boy.

92
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,870
Hello, dear. What can I do for you?

93
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:05,116
I need to exchange some books.

94
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:10,536
Well, that's nice. Not a lot of people
your age read nowadays.

95
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:15,405
- Do you have a card with us?
- No, but I'd like to open one.

96
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:20,119
Wonderful. What kind of books
are you interested in?

97
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:24,205
Mostly smaller ones. A few heavies.

98
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,411
Well, you won't find them there.

99
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,491
Those are our children sections.

100
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:33,202
The enchanted forest.
And the never ending ocean.

101
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:36,452
They sound like fun.

102
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:45,083
Have we met before? You seem so familiar.

103
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:50,030
I'm embarrassed to say it's been
a while since I visited a library.

104
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:53,784
Well, that's no way to live, dear.

105
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,745
Let's get you into a good book.

106
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,698
Come.

107
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:35,491
Anna may, this lovely young lady wants
to open an account with us.

108
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,164
Well.

109
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,081
Madeleine should have told you

110
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:45,489
that we don't accept
new readers without a reference.

111
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:49,030
- Madeleine had a hunch.
- Fudge your hunches.

112
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:52,037
- If you pardon my French.
- Technically not French.

113
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:55,083
- Always literal.
- Of course I'm literary. I'm a librarian.

114
00:15:55,167 --> 00:16:00,207
Yeah, be that as it may.
Florence, dear, would you join us?

115
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:05,624
I'm afraid we need a tie breaker.

116
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:08,905
Madeleine thinks this girl needs
to do some reading.

117
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,322
I told you I had a hunch.
There's something very familiar about her.

118
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:17,457
Hunch shmunch. I, on the other hand,
think we should dispose of the body

119
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:21,114
and then have a long talk about
our onboarding protocols.

120
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,494
You know I can hear you, right?

121
00:16:24,292 --> 00:16:28,706
Hush, girl. Don't be rude.

122
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:31,158
Turn around, hon.

123
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,290
And take off your hat.

124
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:54,364
- What did she say her name was?
- She didn't.

125
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,039
That's odd.

126
00:16:56,125 --> 00:17:01,370
Well, girl. Cat got your tongue? Speak up.

127
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,744
It's Sam.

128
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:09,496
- Scarlet's kid?
- Yeah.

129
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,120
I knew it. Never forget those eyes.

130
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:17,077
We haven't seen you since
you were yea high. How is your mother?

131
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:19,158
I haven't seen her in 15 years.

132
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:25,868
Well, that's something
we both have in common.

133
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:31,908
My, my, my. Little Sam.
We hear about you all the time.

134
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,707
You've made quite a reputation
for yourself.

135
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:38,284
Come here. Give auntie Madeleine a hug.

136
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,448
Why come back now?

137
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:50,324
I needed clean guns, and...
I guess I needed an excuse.

138
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:57,283
Nice collection.

139
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,822
And you take good care of them.
Let me guess.

140
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:05,206
You're the sentimental type. Romantic.

141
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:09,285
Sentimental types
don't last long doing this. So, no,

142
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,787
I don't think I'm the sentimental type.

143
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:15,697
Tommy tomahawk.
I looked everywhere for him.

144
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:17,999
Yeah. Sorry about that.

145
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:22,997
So, you're an idealist.

146
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,665
Nope. Maybe I don't have a type.

147
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,197
- Everybody has a type.
- Everybody.

148
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:32,489
Maybe I'm the professional type?

149
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:36,656
Old school. No women, no children type.

150
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:43,245
- Women are fair game.
- Gender equality. Very progressive.

151
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:48,748
- She's a feminist.
- Fine. You get to live.

152
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:54,157
We'll make these disappear and get you
into some new, clean books.

153
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,911
You'll need a Jane Austen.

154
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:00,577
A Charlotte bronte.

155
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:04,074
And a Virginia woolf.

156
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,116
And an Agatha christie.

157
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:15,873
For reading.

158
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,373
Please.

159
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,707
I need to answer this.

160
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:44,832
You need to walk away and thank god
I'm not in a killing mood.

161
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,490
I got no choice.

162
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,074
- No!
- Enough!

163
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:30,248
Playing hard to get?
Not very smart, moron.

164
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:34,872
Not unless you want me to send
your little Princess back in pieces.

165
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:39,452
You have exactly 60 minutes to bring the
money to the gutterball bowling alley.

166
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:44,161
A minute late and she'll be celebrating
her ninth birthday with the worms.

167
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,366
Sixty minutes.

168
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:53,080
Please. It's my daughter.

169
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,243
Fuck me.

170
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:04,782
I'll get the doctor.
Guns go in the cookie jar.

171
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,447
Hey. Haven't seen you in a while.

172
00:23:15,542 --> 00:23:18,784
And you've brought a new friend.
What the hell happened?

173
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:23,039
I happened. Just fix him.
I need him on his feet in ten minutes.

174
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,663
He's not going anywhere.
Not in ten minutes.

175
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:36,530
- Maybe not ever.
- So what can we do?

176
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,369
We? Well, you could start
by not shooting people.

177
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:43,622
Please. My Emily. There's no time.

178
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:45,869
That's it, just relax. Take it in deep.

179
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,950
- Is that laughing gas?
- Well, duh.

180
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:55,162
Just patch him up. I'll be back soon.
He'd better be functional.

181
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:02,783
She's really quite annoying, isn't she?

182
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:09,911
Who am I talking to?
The guy that she shot in the stomach?

183
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:18,324
- Is it done?
- There's a change of plan.

184
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,324
What are you talking about?
What does that mean?

185
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:24,329
They kidnapped his little girl.
That's why he stole the money.

186
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:27,534
If I don't get to the gutterball
in 15 minutes, they'll kill her.

187
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:31,072
Sam, you're not thinking straight.
Just bring the money back. Now!

188
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:35,035
I just need half an hour. I'll release
the girl and bring you back your money.

189
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:38,575
Okay, listen to me, Sam.

190
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:41,864
If you screw this one up,
they will give the kill order.

191
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:45,246
And I won't be able to stop them.

192
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:50,953
She's just a little girl.
I can't leave her to die. I'm sorry.

193
00:24:51,042 --> 00:24:54,205
- Don't you dare hang up on me, young lady.
- I'm sorry.

194
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,998
Fuck!

195
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:14,497
Go to the gutterball.
Try to reason with her.

196
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:16,198
Bring back the money.

197
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:18,448
Wait.

198
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:26,156
Now, when I say reason with her,
I mean no guns, no knives.

199
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,083
She comes back alive. Understood?

200
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:30,748
Yeah.

201
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:36,076
And for god's sake, be careful.

202
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:38,407
And remember who you're dealing with.

203
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:44,366
What the hell are you waiting for? Go.

204
00:26:00,042 --> 00:26:03,364
One of the men Sam killed was
Jim mcalester's son.

205
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:09,660
Are you sure it was mcalester's kid?
Yes.

206
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:13,908
The board is on its way.

207
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,162
God damn it, Sam.

208
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:03,155
Who the fuck are you?

209
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:08,074
Just someone who has your money.
I want the girl.

210
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:10,249
Where's daddy?

211
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:13,325
He had an accident.

212
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,244
He sent me.

213
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:19,789
You want your money or not?

214
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:45,289
The girl got to this point alive,
but if you as much as sneeze

215
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:49,493
without my permission,
that could be easily rectified.

216
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:52,074
- Got it.
- Good.

217
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:55,284
Now, see the locker behind you?

218
00:27:58,708 --> 00:28:01,165
Weapon and phone go in the locker.

219
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,115
Along with the clothes you're wearing now.

220
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:05,449
Slam the door shut and it will lock.

221
00:28:05,542 --> 00:28:08,454
Go to the westfield mall
across the street.

222
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:12,785
You, the suitcase, the new clothes
and the little girl's phone.

223
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:16,657
Seriously?

224
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,957
Ten minutes.

225
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,365
Hello, Sam.

226
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:45,285
- Bonehead.
- Hey, Sam.

227
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:49,448
Boneheads.

228
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:53,999
I really don't have time for this.

229
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:59,032
Nathan's worried about you.
Doesn't want you to do anything stupid.

230
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:03,539
So why don't you hand over the suitcase
and nobody gets hurt.

231
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:04,740
Counter offer.

232
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:08,451
Go back to Nathan.
Tell him you tried but I roughed you up.

233
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:13,162
You can beat each other up
for added realism.

234
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:18,038
- That's funny.
- What, no guns today?

235
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:22,915
Nathan doesn't want you hurt.
Not too badly, anyway.

236
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:25,664
That is so sweet.

237
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:28,874
I'll try not to kill you too.

238
00:30:21,542 --> 00:30:23,578
Who the fuck is she?

239
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,616
Ground floor. Video beast.

240
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:11,326
- Cutting it close.
- I had a few hiccups.

241
00:33:11,417 --> 00:33:14,659
We saw what you did with those hiccups.
How do we know you're not a cop?

242
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,617
Can a cop do what I just did?

243
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:22,997
- I just want the girl.
- Then we'll get along just fine.

244
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:28,077
There's a shopping cart behind you.
Put the suitcase inside.

245
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:37,787
Push the shopping cart towards us,

246
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:40,457
and we'll push the girl cart towards you.

247
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,285
One.

248
00:33:45,708 --> 00:33:47,039
Two.

249
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:51,494
Three.

250
00:34:00,542 --> 00:34:03,909
It's okay. You're safe.
I'll be right back.

251
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:13,996
We're all stinking rich,
you magnificent bastards.

252
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:16,074
Stop the fucking car.

253
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:18,749
Fuck!

254
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:42,824
You greedy traitor!

255
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:04,500
No!

256
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:17,869
Fuck.

257
00:35:57,333 --> 00:36:00,496
- Anything broken? Are you bleeding?
- No.

258
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:05,953
- Bleeding on the inside?
- How can you tell? It's inside.

259
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:11,031
You're probably fine. Let's go.
Try to keep up.

260
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:26,655
I see you morons have found my stash.

261
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:31,244
This some good shit, doc.
You should be very proud of yourself.

262
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:35,369
This is not a toy.

263
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:38,120
It's for medicinal use only.

264
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:49,865
So, who fucked you up like this?

265
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:55,823
A girl.

266
00:36:57,458 --> 00:37:00,370
So a girl made the three of you look like
you're from the walking dead?

267
00:37:00,458 --> 00:37:03,291
I've never felt pain
like this before, doc.

268
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:05,741
She got us good, doc.

269
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:09,579
I don't think I'll ever walk again.

270
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:12,617
Well, there must be an epidemic,
because I got a guy in the next room

271
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:14,539
who's got similar symptoms.

272
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:18,291
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

273
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:21,333
A girl fucked him up too.

274
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,036
Keep talking, doc.

275
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:33,655
- You're bleeding.
- It's just a scratch.

276
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:38,289
It can get infected.
Worms will get in there and lay eggs.

277
00:37:38,375 --> 00:37:40,411
Then they'll have to cut your arm off.

278
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:44,786
That's what they teach you
in school these days?

279
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:46,911
Discovery channel.

280
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,412
Well, thank god
we're going straight to the hospital.

281
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,823
- Is my daddy there?
- Yeah.

282
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:58,951
Is that why he didn't come? Is he sick?

283
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:00,747
He...

284
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:05,947
It's okay. You don't have to lie for him.

285
00:38:06,042 --> 00:38:09,079
He never comes when he says he will.

286
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:18,700
Here. Just let me help you.

287
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:24,623
Thank you.

288
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:27,782
Sure.

289
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:33,871
- Are you sure it's her?
- Yeah. She dropped off some guy she shot.

290
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:36,620
Said she's gonna come back
and pick him up later.

291
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:41,623
- And the money?
- Well, she had it last time we saw her.

292
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:43,619
Then get it back.

293
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:47,155
She still getting the vip treatment?

294
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,704
- Do whatever it takes.
- Alright, alright, alright.

295
00:38:58,792 --> 00:39:01,499
Now that's what I call a work benefit.

296
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:17,949
Just stay behind me, okay?

297
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:40,532
Come on.

298
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,828
I'll get the doctor.

299
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,865
She's here.

300
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:53,164
Shot in the shoulder.

301
00:40:58,458 --> 00:41:00,915
Maybe you should take your break now.

302
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:10,374
So, my payment?

303
00:41:13,542 --> 00:41:15,783
Transferred to your account.

304
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:20,114
Now, what's the plan, doc?

305
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:28,665
Once I stick her with this,
she'll start losing control of her arms.

306
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:33,323
After 60 seconds or so,
she's a sitting duck.

307
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,332
What's wrong with you?
Let me do this right.

308
00:41:55,417 --> 00:41:57,282
It's just a scratch.

309
00:41:57,375 --> 00:42:00,538
Well, scratches get infected.
That's how you lose an arm.

310
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:04,290
Yeah, I heard.

311
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:12,364
What happened to him?
Someone shot him.

312
00:42:12,458 --> 00:42:14,574
I hear that's pretty lethal.

313
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:20,118
- Let's fix this.
- Don't. I'm good.

314
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:25,783
- Trust me, you'll need this.
- I said I'm good.

315
00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:31,204
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

316
00:42:33,708 --> 00:42:36,165
You motherfu...

317
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:39,616
Sixty seconds!

318
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:42,074
Sixty seconds!

319
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:51,249
Sixty seconds.

320
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:55,117
Come on.

321
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:03,498
Listen, I need your help.
Some bad men are coming to hurt us.

322
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:05,244
The ones who killed my dad?

323
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:08,621
I promise I'll explain later,
but right now I need your help, okay?

324
00:43:08,708 --> 00:43:12,121
- Okay.
- Good. Grab the biggest knife.

325
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:14,039
Careful of the sharp end.

326
00:43:18,792 --> 00:43:20,248
Okay. Now grab the tape.

327
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:26,409
Excellent. Tape it to my hand.

328
00:43:29,542 --> 00:43:31,157
Thirty-six.

329
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:35,790
Thirty-two.

330
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:45,957
Now tape the gun to my other hand.

331
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,081
Careful. It's loaded.

332
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:51,783
Fifteen, fourteen...

333
00:43:55,417 --> 00:43:57,658
Round two, bitch!

334
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:03,156
- Boneheads?
- Better get ready!

335
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:05,786
Thank god it's just you three.

336
00:44:05,875 --> 00:44:08,992
You know, for a second there I thought it
was someone dangerous.

337
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:14,281
The only reason you're still alive
is because Nathan wanted it that way.

338
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:17,117
Now, just take my finger
and put it on the trigger.

339
00:44:17,208 --> 00:44:22,783
Well, it's over now.
I'm gonna tear you into little pieces.

340
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:26,322
- And I'm gonna love every second of it.
- Yeah, that's great.

341
00:44:26,417 --> 00:44:29,580
Can you hold that thought?
I'll be right out.

342
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:42,199
You're being very brave, Emily.

343
00:44:42,292 --> 00:44:46,706
I need you to do one last thing for me,
and then go and hide. Okay?

344
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,160
Okay.

345
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:15,365
Hey, bonehead.

346
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:52,708
Emily.

347
00:47:55,667 --> 00:47:57,953
I need you to come grab the phone.

348
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:13,698
Come on.

349
00:48:17,792 --> 00:48:19,953
It's okay. Just pick it up.

350
00:48:26,792 --> 00:48:31,991
You are a goddamn rock star.
Put it on speaker.

351
00:48:33,917 --> 00:48:35,748
Someone better start talking.

352
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:42,159
That was a... jerk move,
sending the three stooges after me.

353
00:48:43,042 --> 00:48:46,739
- You left us no choice, Sam.
- There's always a choice.

354
00:48:46,833 --> 00:48:51,076
Well, then, we can still figure this out.
Just bring the money back.

355
00:48:51,167 --> 00:48:54,830
It's gone. The suitcase was blown
into a thousand pieces.

356
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:05,199
That's really unfortunate.

357
00:49:05,292 --> 00:49:07,658
So now what?

358
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:12,449
You're no longer under our protection.

359
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:18,744
In your little massacre earlier tonight,
you killed the wrong people.

360
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:21,245
Including Jim mcalester's son.

361
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:26,030
But I was sent by you, by the firm.

362
00:49:26,125 --> 00:49:28,081
It doesn't matter.

363
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:33,161
This is business, Sam,

364
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:36,992
and you landed on the wrong side
of the balance sheet.

365
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:38,869
So...

366
00:49:39,875 --> 00:49:41,991
It needs to be rectified.

367
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:47,412
How's this for business?

368
00:49:48,125 --> 00:49:53,165
If I get out of this alive,
I'm coming for you.

369
00:49:54,417 --> 00:49:55,782
All of you.

370
00:49:57,417 --> 00:50:00,375
I would expect no less.

371
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:03,619
Goodbye, Sam.

372
00:50:28,583 --> 00:50:31,780
- Yes?
- Mr mcalester, this is Nathan.

373
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:34,537
I'm the head of the hr department
here at the firm.

374
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:35,705
What do you want?

375
00:50:35,792 --> 00:50:39,159
To prevent an all-out war between
our two fine organisations,

376
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:43,118
we would like to offer you the woman
responsible for your loss.

377
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:45,494
So you had nothing to do with this?

378
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:49,246
I can assure you this is not how the firm
conducts its business, sir.

379
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:53,576
It was an unsolicited action
by a very troubled individual.

380
00:50:53,667 --> 00:50:59,742
I'm sending you her last location.
I hope this is satisfactory, sir.

381
00:51:00,417 --> 00:51:01,907
For now.

382
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:07,871
Take everybody.
Don't come back until it's done.

383
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:37,450
- It's a text message from Nathan.
- What's it say?

384
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:41,996
"I'm sorry, child.
I can no longer protect you.

385
00:51:42,958 --> 00:51:46,405
I left you a package to help you
survive the next few days.

386
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,207
Take it and disappear.”

387
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:51,619
Then there's an address.

388
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:54,539
That's close by.

389
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,240
What if it's a trap?

390
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:15,825
Can you press the button?
We're parked on minus two.

391
00:52:42,458 --> 00:52:46,872
Just remember, you were spared thanks
to an eight-year-old girl.

392
00:52:46,958 --> 00:52:49,415
Eight and three quarters.

393
00:52:51,292 --> 00:52:54,864
Sorry. Eight and three quarters.

394
00:53:05,708 --> 00:53:07,664
Are you a serial killer?

395
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:10,323
What?

396
00:53:11,375 --> 00:53:12,410
No.

397
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:15,958
- Where did you learn that expression?
- History channel.

398
00:53:16,042 --> 00:53:19,864
Well, I am not a serial killer.

399
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:23,701
But you kill people. Yes.

400
00:53:23,792 --> 00:53:27,740
- So that makes you a killer.
- And you've killed more than one.

401
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:29,573
That is serial.

402
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:34,079
It's more complicated than that.

403
00:53:34,917 --> 00:53:38,284
Serial killers are, you know,
mentally unstable.

404
00:53:38,375 --> 00:53:41,037
They kill people out of a compulsive urge.

405
00:53:43,458 --> 00:53:45,289
So, then, why do you kill them?

406
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:49,323
For money?

407
00:53:50,542 --> 00:53:54,330
Again, it's complicated.

408
00:53:57,458 --> 00:54:00,450
Look, I'm gonna need your help
for a little longer.

409
00:54:00,542 --> 00:54:02,062
Because your arms are still paralysed?

410
00:54:02,125 --> 00:54:04,366
Yes. After that, I'll get you
to your mother.

411
00:54:04,458 --> 00:54:07,291
- She left a long time ago.
- To your grandparents, then.

412
00:54:07,375 --> 00:54:10,492
- They're dead.
- Uncles? Anything?

413
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:22,833
We'll figure it out, okay?

414
00:54:23,792 --> 00:54:28,456
- Okay.
- So, here's an unrelated question.

415
00:54:29,417 --> 00:54:30,953
Do you know how to drive?

416
00:54:32,375 --> 00:54:36,448
Let's go over it one more time.
Left. Right.

417
00:54:36,542 --> 00:54:40,205
I've got it already. D is for drive.
R is for reverse.

418
00:54:40,292 --> 00:54:43,955
And you get to do the easy part,
stepping on the gas and brakes.

419
00:54:44,042 --> 00:54:46,704
Don't be a smartass. Turn the key.

420
00:54:48,667 --> 00:54:50,578
Put it in drive.

421
00:54:51,417 --> 00:54:52,623
Let's go.

422
00:55:12,292 --> 00:55:14,328
That's it. Straighten up.

423
00:55:15,667 --> 00:55:18,955
- I'm driving.
- Yes, you are.

424
00:55:26,917 --> 00:55:29,954
Emily. Don't worry about the bullets.

425
00:55:30,667 --> 00:55:32,328
Reverse. Now!

426
00:55:35,042 --> 00:55:36,953
Hard left!

427
00:55:38,917 --> 00:55:40,532
- Put it in drive.
- Yeah.

428
00:55:43,042 --> 00:55:44,782
That's it.

429
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:47,699
Hard left. Go!

430
00:55:53,875 --> 00:55:56,708
Get ready. Hard left.

431
00:55:56,792 --> 00:55:59,124
And another hard left.

432
00:56:13,208 --> 00:56:16,245
Okay. Put it in reverse.

433
00:56:20,458 --> 00:56:21,868
Hard right.

434
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:26,540
Put it in drive.

435
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:32,535
Hard left.

436
00:56:33,375 --> 00:56:35,206
Put it in reverse.

437
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,331
Quick, kill the lights.

438
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:07,868
Okay, be quiet. Duck down.
That's it. Get down.

439
00:57:19,042 --> 00:57:22,239
Okay, put it in drive.

440
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:25,824
Then close your eyes.

441
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:40,532
Keep her straight.

442
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:46,740
Keep it straight.

443
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:55,869
Are your eyes still closed? Yes.

444
00:57:55,958 --> 00:57:59,530
Good girl. Put it in reverse.

445
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:30,497
- Can I turn on the radio?
- Go nuts.

446
00:59:28,167 --> 00:59:30,874
Emily. Doorbell.

447
00:59:52,375 --> 00:59:55,037
Didn't I teach you to always
guard your back?

448
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:06,789
Hi, mom.

449
01:00:07,958 --> 01:00:09,164
Hi.

450
01:00:18,958 --> 01:00:20,914
Is this...

451
01:00:22,917 --> 01:00:26,535
- Am I a grandmother?
- God, no.

452
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:33,997
Hi. I'm Emily. I'm her apprentice.

453
01:00:34,083 --> 01:00:37,871
- What?
- Emily. Come.

454
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,870
- That is a hell of a story.
- Hell of a night.

455
01:01:07,833 --> 01:01:10,825
Try wiggling your fingers.

456
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:14,080
- The feeling should come back in no time.
- Yeah. Already started working.

457
01:01:14,167 --> 01:01:15,282
Excellent.

458
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,786
You look really good. Are you eating well?

459
01:01:21,875 --> 01:01:23,115
Cut the crap, mom.

460
01:01:24,542 --> 01:01:26,954
Where have you been for the last 15 years?

461
01:01:27,875 --> 01:01:29,206
Around.

462
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:33,990
Watching you.

463
01:01:36,167 --> 01:01:37,907
Making sure you're safe.

464
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,036
Great parenting.

465
01:01:40,125 --> 01:01:42,707
Glad to see you taking an interest
in my career.

466
01:01:42,792 --> 01:01:46,034
- I never wanted this life for you.
- And how's that working out for you?

467
01:01:50,792 --> 01:01:54,159
I wanted to stay with you and your aunts,
but I couldn't.

468
01:01:54,792 --> 01:01:56,157
Why not?

469
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:00,411
Because I fucked up.

470
01:02:06,292 --> 01:02:08,123
I fucked up.

471
01:02:09,583 --> 01:02:11,494
I was young when I had you.

472
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,912
I left London and followed your father
here, and when he died...

473
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,786
When he was murdered.

474
01:02:19,833 --> 01:02:23,530
When he was murdered. You were a baby.
I had nothing.

475
01:02:23,625 --> 01:02:25,661
No money. Nowhere to go.

476
01:02:26,458 --> 01:02:28,665
I knew Anna may from your dad's work.

477
01:02:30,042 --> 01:02:31,998
She and the other aunts took us in.

478
01:02:33,292 --> 01:02:37,114
- The best years of my life.
- Me too.

479
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:44,117
Fast forward 12 years and I find out
who shot your dad.

480
01:02:45,458 --> 01:02:50,122
The Russians? The Russians from the diner?

481
01:02:50,208 --> 01:02:53,621
Once I knew, I couldn't let him
walk around enjoying life,

482
01:02:55,292 --> 01:02:57,032
knowing what he did to us.

483
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:04,040
But he was in bed with the firm.
So there was a price to pay.

484
01:03:04,125 --> 01:03:06,912
Once I killed him,
there was a Mark on my back.

485
01:03:13,542 --> 01:03:15,328
I couldn't take you with me.

486
01:03:18,208 --> 01:03:19,618
I couldn't risk your life.

487
01:03:23,292 --> 01:03:25,999
So I made Nathan promise to keep you safe.

488
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:31,456
I guess that's over.

489
01:03:34,708 --> 01:03:38,075
There isn't a day that goes
by I don't regret pulling that trigger.

490
01:03:38,167 --> 01:03:40,749
But back then I couldn't help myself.

491
01:03:45,083 --> 01:03:46,948
I'm sorry.

492
01:03:58,958 --> 01:04:02,655
- Does the kid know about you and her dad?
- No.

493
01:04:04,917 --> 01:04:06,657
But she's smart.

494
01:04:07,667 --> 01:04:11,364
- She'll figure it out.
- What happens when she does?

495
01:04:28,375 --> 01:04:30,787
I think there's a bad man outside.

496
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:37,956
We have to get out of here.

497
01:04:42,583 --> 01:04:45,325
- So, what's the plan?
- Can you press the lobby button?

498
01:04:45,417 --> 01:04:47,999
- What plan?
- Come on. You always have a plan.

499
01:04:48,083 --> 01:04:50,699
What is it? A secret escape route?
A warehouse filled with guns?

500
01:04:50,792 --> 01:04:53,158
- I called us an uber.
- Are you kidding me?

501
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:54,410
- Nope.
- An uber?

502
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:55,643
What the hell are you talking about?

503
01:04:55,667 --> 01:05:00,036
I know you. You make plans, and then
you make plans to make other plans.

504
01:05:00,125 --> 01:05:04,698
You're frothing at the mouth.
It's unbecoming.

505
01:05:25,583 --> 01:05:27,539
Get them!

506
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,322
Don't feel bad. Could happen to anyone.

507
01:05:35,417 --> 01:05:38,705
- My hand is still paralysed.
- Yeah, course it is.

508
01:05:38,792 --> 01:05:41,625
- It is.
- I know.

509
01:05:52,292 --> 01:05:55,864
Right. After you, ladies. Come on.

510
01:05:55,958 --> 01:05:57,869
Hurry up.

511
01:05:57,958 --> 01:06:01,530
- Where does that go?
- Fucking narnia. Go. In. In!

512
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:03,206
Fine.

513
01:06:15,708 --> 01:06:19,656
- No plan?
- Now is not the time.

514
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:21,286
Out of my way.

515
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:28,741
- Need help, ma?
- No, thank you.

516
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:35,409
I think I'm quite capable of disposing
of one idiotic grate.

517
01:07:11,375 --> 01:07:15,618
That freezer is a mess.
It's completely unacceptable.

518
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,662
- Come on.
- Are you kidding me?

519
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:29,581
- We have to go.
- Go where?

520
01:07:29,667 --> 01:07:31,407
Obviously your plan was to end up here.

521
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:34,207
- That was a long time ago.
- Mom.

522
01:07:34,292 --> 01:07:36,999
- I am not going in there.
- Mom, listen to me. We need weapons.

523
01:07:37,083 --> 01:07:38,869
We need a car. We need a safe house.

524
01:07:38,958 --> 01:07:43,452
- I'm not sure they'd even let me in.
- Only one way to find out.

525
01:07:52,667 --> 01:07:54,578
Hey.

526
01:08:09,125 --> 01:08:11,787
For the record,
I still think this is a shit idea.

527
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,036
Madeleine?

528
01:08:32,833 --> 01:08:36,325
Girls, I think I see a ghost.

529
01:08:40,792 --> 01:08:42,703
- Hi, Madeleine.
- Hi, Scarlet.

530
01:08:42,792 --> 01:08:44,532
Florence.

531
01:08:46,792 --> 01:08:51,240
- Hi, Anna may.
- No. No, you don't get to talk.

532
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:55,208
Because you're a ghost
and ghosts can't talk.

533
01:08:55,292 --> 01:08:58,910
- You know how I know that?
- Can we do this later?

534
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,744
Because if ghosts could talk, they would
say something before disappearing.

535
01:09:03,833 --> 01:09:06,825
Or at least leave a note. But they can't.

536
01:09:06,917 --> 01:09:10,080
So, ipso facto, you're a ghost.

537
01:09:10,792 --> 01:09:12,498
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck you!

538
01:09:12,583 --> 01:09:14,915
Language, Anna may.
There's a child present.

539
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,743
- Fine.
- Fudge you.

540
01:09:18,833 --> 01:09:21,870
- Fudge you.
- Fudge you.

541
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,662
And why is there a toddler in our place
of business?

542
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:33,992
- The short version?
- Please.

543
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:36,745
Well, her father was killed
and she has nowhere else to go.

544
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:42,032
I was downsized by the firm and they fed
me to mcalester's endless supply of thugs.

545
01:09:42,125 --> 01:09:43,740
And you decided to come here?

546
01:09:43,833 --> 01:09:46,018
I'm sorry. Shall we come back
at a more convenient time?

547
01:09:46,042 --> 01:09:47,782
Maybe you should.

548
01:09:47,875 --> 01:09:51,948
It seems like whenever you come here,
you bring a war with you.

549
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:58,368
Bringing your problems...
We need to table this for now.

550
01:10:02,125 --> 01:10:05,037
Seconded. Let's go down.

551
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,447
Go and take Emily. I'll buy you some time.

552
01:10:28,542 --> 01:10:30,624
I think I should stay.

553
01:10:33,417 --> 01:10:38,741
No. I screwed this up.
I'll clean up my own mess.

554
01:10:40,208 --> 01:10:44,497
We'll meet at the diner once
I've finished them off. Go.

555
01:10:45,875 --> 01:10:48,161
Please.

556
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:51,369
Come.

557
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:56,041
Sure you don't need help?
I could use the target practice.

558
01:10:57,458 --> 01:11:01,781
Anna may was right.
Shouldn't have dragged you into this.

559
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:16,290
- I'm staying with you.
- No. No, you're not.

560
01:11:16,375 --> 01:11:19,117
You're going with them to the basement
where it's safe.

561
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:21,699
But you need me. I'm your apprentice.

562
01:11:21,792 --> 01:11:24,750
Okay, listen, Emily.
The bad men are coming.

563
01:11:24,833 --> 01:11:26,994
I really need you to go with my mom.

564
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:30,450
- No. I wanna stay with you.
- You can't.

565
01:11:30,542 --> 01:11:33,454
- But why?
- Because...

566
01:11:36,833 --> 01:11:42,078
- Because I killed your father.
- You're lying.

567
01:11:42,167 --> 01:11:44,283
You just wanna get rid of me.

568
01:11:46,083 --> 01:11:50,907
Your dad, he stole
from some very bad people.

569
01:11:52,083 --> 01:11:54,324
And they hired me.

570
01:11:55,792 --> 01:11:57,657
And I shot him.

571
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:12,083
Come on. Let's go.

572
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:24,451
- I need weapons.
- Try the self-help section.

573
01:12:57,208 --> 01:12:59,620
- I have to go help her.
- And you needed my permission?

574
01:13:02,667 --> 01:13:06,580
Look, I'm sorry I couldn't give it up back
then and just stay here with you.

575
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:19,538
You're human. You screwed up.

576
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:23,288
I can only imagine how painful
it was leaving her behind.

577
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:38,824
Leaving us all behind.

578
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:41,540
But she grew up to be a fine woman.

579
01:13:49,583 --> 01:13:51,494
I never wanted this life for her.

580
01:13:58,792 --> 01:14:00,202
Maybe it was meant to be.

581
01:14:00,292 --> 01:14:03,204
Or maybe she wanted to be
just like her mother.

582
01:14:13,708 --> 01:14:15,824
I missed you.

583
01:14:25,375 --> 01:14:27,661
We kept these ladies for you.

584
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:38,449
Just meet us at the diner.
Come back in one piece, okay?

585
01:14:38,542 --> 01:14:40,954
Both of you.

586
01:15:54,792 --> 01:15:56,453
Fuck!

587
01:16:41,083 --> 01:16:44,575
- Is anything broken? Are you bleeding?
- I'm fine.

588
01:16:44,667 --> 01:16:46,874
Bleeding on the inside?

589
01:16:47,583 --> 01:16:51,451
- I think the rest of them are coming.
- Would it kill you to say thank you?

590
01:16:52,375 --> 01:16:56,994
- You can still go, ma. I'll cover you.
- And miss all the fun?

591
01:17:03,667 --> 01:17:05,623
Women who run with wolves.

592
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:09,786
Awakening the giant within.
Ammo?

593
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,831
How to win friends and influence people.

594
01:17:30,208 --> 01:17:32,870
You really should have stayed away
from this line of work.

595
01:17:32,958 --> 01:17:36,906
Are you kidding, ma? You left.

596
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,492
Killing people was the only thing
I knew how to do.

597
01:17:40,583 --> 01:17:44,075
Okay, maybe in retrospect it wasn't
the best environment to raise a child in.

598
01:17:44,167 --> 01:17:45,623
You think?

599
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:50,496
- But it made you who you are.
- At least we can agree on that.

600
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:06,947
And you are a strong, smart,
incredibly impressive young woman.

601
01:18:09,167 --> 01:18:12,534
There's not a single person on earth
I'd rather kill people with.

602
01:18:13,917 --> 01:18:15,327
Thanks, ma.

603
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:19,868
And so strong. You can't be eight
and three quarters.

604
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:20,958
I am.

605
01:18:21,042 --> 01:18:22,998
You sure you're not 28 and three quarters?

606
01:18:31,792 --> 01:18:34,989
Anna may. Madeleine. Come and see this.

607
01:18:45,625 --> 01:18:49,197
We're not leaving.
Scarlet's still a librarian

608
01:18:49,292 --> 01:18:52,659
- no matter how much of an asshole she is.
- Language.

609
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:55,537
So these... jerks.

610
01:18:55,625 --> 01:19:00,949
Jerks up there just made the biggest
mistake of their lives

611
01:19:01,042 --> 01:19:05,035
when they stepped into our library
and threatened our own flesh and blood.

612
01:19:05,125 --> 01:19:08,617
They're not gonna push us around anymore
and they're not gonna scare us off.

613
01:19:08,708 --> 01:19:10,744
This ends now.

614
01:19:10,833 --> 01:19:13,540
Madeleine, finish getting the Van ready.

615
01:19:13,625 --> 01:19:18,369
Florence, you and I are going up there
to defend the herd.

616
01:19:18,458 --> 01:19:23,077
We're gonna bring the sky down on their
mother-fudging heads.

617
01:19:23,167 --> 01:19:25,283
- All in favour?
- Aye.

618
01:19:25,375 --> 01:19:28,697
- Aye.
- Aye.

619
01:19:31,292 --> 01:19:32,907
Motion carried.

620
01:20:37,417 --> 01:20:41,205
You think you have a chance here?
I have an army.

621
01:20:41,292 --> 01:20:44,989
Oh, yeah? Well, I've got my mom.

622
01:20:52,125 --> 01:20:56,539
- I wish we had some more time, ma.
- It's quality, not quantity.

623
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:01,286
Chin up.

624
01:21:01,375 --> 01:21:02,831
Why don't you just come out?

625
01:21:02,917 --> 01:21:06,034
And I will put a bullet through your head.
Nice and quick.

626
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:09,206
Why don't you go fudge yourself?

627
01:21:12,042 --> 01:21:15,409
If you make me work for it, I'm gonna
shoot you in the stomach.

628
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,786
Then we'll have some real fun together.

629
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,956
Hey, dumb-dumbs.

630
01:21:39,167 --> 01:21:41,704
Hey, idiots, catch these!

631
01:22:35,958 --> 01:22:39,701
Idiots to the left. Morons to the right.

632
01:22:39,792 --> 01:22:42,989
The rest of you knuckleheads
stay here and kill those two.

633
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:44,081
Put these on.

634
01:23:53,167 --> 01:23:57,365
I'm gonna make a little noise,
so play it loud.

635
01:23:57,458 --> 01:23:59,414
Can you do that for me?

636
01:25:54,125 --> 01:25:57,083
Sam! Reload.

637
01:30:42,042 --> 01:30:44,454
You got something in your hair.

638
01:30:48,458 --> 01:30:50,494
It's a tooth.

639
01:31:08,833 --> 01:31:10,824
Hey.

640
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:17,540
He took Emily.

641
01:31:19,917 --> 01:31:22,499
I couldn't save her.

642
01:31:22,583 --> 01:31:26,246
It's okay. We'll get her back.

643
01:31:39,833 --> 01:31:45,123
It was nice having a kid
in the library again.

644
01:32:33,917 --> 01:32:37,739
There's little joy in life for me.

645
01:32:37,833 --> 01:32:41,121
And little terror in the grave.

646
01:32:41,208 --> 01:32:44,746
I've lived the parting hour to see

647
01:32:44,833 --> 01:32:48,451
of one I would have died to save.

648
01:33:12,833 --> 01:33:17,156
Well, that was exciting.
Been a long time since I killed someone.

649
01:33:17,250 --> 01:33:19,662
Let me talk to Emily.

650
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:25,199
You know, it's a real tragedy what happens
to poor orphans in our line of work.

651
01:33:25,292 --> 01:33:27,408
You know? It's really quite sad.

652
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:31,866
What do you want?

653
01:33:31,958 --> 01:33:33,994
My uncle insists on meeting you.

654
01:33:34,083 --> 01:33:40,124
He says skinning you alive will
let him work through his grief.

655
01:33:40,208 --> 01:33:42,199
That's not too much to ask, is it?

656
01:33:42,292 --> 01:33:48,697
If I come to you, Emily goes free
and everyone else is off the table.

657
01:33:53,125 --> 01:33:55,241
Okay, we have a deal.

658
01:33:55,333 --> 01:33:58,405
The diner. Can't wait.

659
01:34:00,125 --> 01:34:01,331
We gotta go.

660
01:34:01,875 --> 01:34:05,413
Hey, you can't just hand yourself
over to those animals.

661
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:09,118
They can't bring their guns into
the diner. It's Emily's best chance.

662
01:34:09,208 --> 01:34:13,076
- It's a suicide mission.
- Well, someone else got a plan?

663
01:34:16,083 --> 01:34:19,246
I don't right now, no.

664
01:34:20,583 --> 01:34:22,915
But it's you, mom.

665
01:34:24,875 --> 01:34:26,740
You always have a plan.

666
01:34:27,542 --> 01:34:28,873
Sorry.

667
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:36,286
Then I guess this is goodbye.

668
01:35:12,292 --> 01:35:15,955
- They're waiting for you, honey.
- Thanks, Rose.

669
01:35:36,583 --> 01:35:38,574
Did they hurt you?

670
01:35:43,792 --> 01:35:45,874
It's been a long day.

671
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:48,957
But it's gonna be over soon, okay?

672
01:35:50,458 --> 01:35:51,743
Okay.

673
01:36:02,875 --> 01:36:04,911
You're a special kid, Emily.

674
01:36:06,625 --> 01:36:09,287
I wish I had more time to get to know you.

675
01:36:25,458 --> 01:36:28,905
I'm Jim. Samantha.

676
01:36:31,958 --> 01:36:37,908
You know, Samantha,
I've always considered myself a feminist.

677
01:36:39,458 --> 01:36:43,280
When my first daughter was born,
I was over the moon.

678
01:36:44,417 --> 01:36:46,908
Painted half the house pink.

679
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,868
It was all unicorns and lollipops.

680
01:36:52,583 --> 01:36:54,995
And my second daughter was born.

681
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,412
And the third. And the fourth.

682
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:02,115
Girls.

683
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:06,492
Always whispering at the dining table.

684
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,912
Always giggling in dark corners.

685
01:37:13,125 --> 01:37:15,286
I love my girls,

686
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,286
but I don't understand them.

687
01:37:21,333 --> 01:37:23,289
Then my son was born.

688
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:27,457
It was different. Simple.

689
01:37:30,625 --> 01:37:32,661
We understood each other.

690
01:37:34,083 --> 01:37:36,324
I wasn't alone any more.

691
01:37:43,583 --> 01:37:45,414
I khow

692
01:37:47,292 --> 01:37:50,455
it was just a job to you

693
01:37:50,542 --> 01:37:53,375
and he was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

694
01:37:55,292 --> 01:37:57,408
None of that matters

695
01:37:57,500 --> 01:38:00,947
because you took him away from me.

696
01:38:04,958 --> 01:38:08,371
I'm gonna do terrible things to you,
Samantha.

697
01:38:09,542 --> 01:38:13,455
You are gonna suffer more
than you thought even possible.

698
01:38:14,458 --> 01:38:19,532
Because you have made me a stranger
in my own home again.

699
01:38:20,708 --> 01:38:27,580
For what it's worth,
I am very sorry about your son.

700
01:38:28,625 --> 01:38:30,957
Thank you, Samantha.

701
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:35,707
Just let the girl go.

702
01:38:36,667 --> 01:38:38,032
Not yet.

703
01:38:41,542 --> 01:38:45,990
- We had a deal.
- And I am a man of my word.

704
01:38:46,083 --> 01:38:49,325
I will set the girl free, unharmed.

705
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:54,492
But only after she's watched
what I do to you.

706
01:38:59,125 --> 01:39:01,116
Please.

707
01:39:02,708 --> 01:39:07,532
Please, I will do anything.

708
01:39:07,625 --> 01:39:12,073
Don't start begging yet.
There's plenty of time for that.

709
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:15,706
How y'all doing? Can I get you something?

710
01:39:15,792 --> 01:39:17,032
No, we're just fine.

711
01:39:17,125 --> 01:39:19,332
Maybe some more coffee or apple pie?

712
01:39:19,417 --> 01:39:23,706
If I have to tell you no again,
there will be consequences.

713
01:39:32,042 --> 01:39:34,203
Hi, sweetheart.

714
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:39,539
- Hi, mom.
- Guess there was a plan after all.

715
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:57,072
- Guess so.
- Why don't you take Emily out of here?

716
01:39:57,167 --> 01:39:59,078
It's no place for a kid.

717
01:39:59,167 --> 01:40:02,364
Stay out of this, ladies.
It's not your fight.

718
01:40:03,083 --> 01:40:07,406
There's no more standing on the sidelines.
We all need to pick a side.

719
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,707
Right, ladies?

720
01:43:50,958 --> 01:43:53,415
Emily.

721
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,492
I'm so sorry I killed your father, Emily.

722
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:33,371
- If I could take it back...
- I know.

723
01:44:34,333 --> 01:44:36,824
But you tried to save him.

724
01:44:37,708 --> 01:44:39,573
Still.

725
01:44:40,292 --> 01:44:42,374
And you saved me.

726
01:44:46,958 --> 01:44:48,698
Thank you.

727
01:44:49,458 --> 01:44:53,246
Besides, I know you just pulled
the trigger.

728
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,117
I know there was someone else
who told you what to do.

729
01:44:57,667 --> 01:45:00,409
Who sent you to my father?

730
01:45:10,583 --> 01:45:13,700
There's a group of men called the firm.

731
01:45:17,292 --> 01:45:21,581
- It's a girl scout.
- Get rid of her.

732
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:24,706
No, wait.

733
01:45:25,208 --> 01:45:29,030
They've been running things for a long,
long time.

734
01:45:30,375 --> 01:45:32,582
They make all the rules

735
01:45:33,750 --> 01:45:36,036
and change them when it fits their needs.

736
01:45:41,458 --> 01:45:43,449
They think they're untouchable.

737
01:45:45,917 --> 01:45:49,114
They think they can get away
with anything.

738
01:45:50,333 --> 01:45:53,405
But they won't, right?

739
01:45:55,750 --> 01:45:58,867
No, they won't.

740
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:01,990
Not any more.

741
01:46:07,292 --> 01:46:10,864
Well, well, well. What do we have here?

742
01:46:10,958 --> 01:46:15,907
- I'm selling cookies.
- Really? Where are they?

743
01:46:17,833 --> 01:46:22,953
You're the little girl that I've heard
so much about, aren't you?

744
01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:31,868
They think so little of me, they sent
a child to do their dirty work?

745
01:46:31,958 --> 01:46:33,664
I'm insulted, frankly.

746
01:46:42,167 --> 01:46:44,328
"Look into your heart?"

747
01:46:52,250 --> 01:46:53,740
Fuck me.

748
01:46:56,833 --> 01:46:59,700
- Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear.

749
01:46:59,792 --> 01:47:03,284
We're both alive and well.
And that's the way it's gonna stay.

750
01:47:03,375 --> 01:47:06,742
Come on, Sam.
You know that's not up to me.

751
01:47:06,833 --> 01:47:10,030
You get one chance to end this now.

752
01:47:10,125 --> 01:47:13,913
Years ago my mom screwed up
and pulled the wrong trigger.

753
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,787
I'm not making the same mistake.

754
01:47:16,875 --> 01:47:21,118
That little girl in front of you
will have a future.

755
01:47:21,208 --> 01:47:25,907
Go back to the partners and tell them we
know where they work, where they live.

756
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:30,494
We can kill them a hundred times over
without them ever seeing us coming.

757
01:47:31,667 --> 01:47:36,616
Tell them they were only spared
because of an eight-year-old girl.

758
01:47:36,708 --> 01:47:38,619
Eight and three quarters.

759
01:47:38,708 --> 01:47:43,702
Sorry. Eight and three quarters. Got it?

760
01:47:43,792 --> 01:47:45,077
Got it.

761
01:47:45,167 --> 01:47:50,912
Now, close your eyes and count to ten.
Slow.

762
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:58,575
One, two, three,

763
01:47:58,667 --> 01:48:04,367
four, five, six, seven,

764
01:48:04,458 --> 01:48:08,121
eight, nine...

765
01:48:10,792 --> 01:48:12,748
Ten.

766
01:48:35,875 --> 01:48:38,582
- Can I drive?
- No.

767
01:48:40,167 --> 01:48:42,909
Can I turn on the radio, then?

768
01:48:44,667 --> 01:48:46,623
Go nuts, baby girl.

769
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:53,073
Right, folks, time to hit the road.

770
01:48:53,167 --> 01:48:56,739
Take care, and see you on the other side.
